Rhodey rolled his eyes. “ Of course he knows you little brat.”
Natasha took the blanket and handed it to Tony who accepted it. “ There’s your answer.”
So Steve and him had always had problems. He would admit that. He would also admit that he was maybe the instigator of most of, not all of them mind you, their fights. It’s not that he wanted to argue with Steve, it was just tempting. But they had simmered down a bit after defeating Thanos and such and were able to work better together. They didn’t argue as much and the need to try and kill one another wasn’t there either.
“Listen you two...”
“ Or I’m just that good,” Tony said smugly and he snuggled between the two soldiers.
“ I’m trying to to be a gentleman.”
Going to die tonight. They were going to kill him.
Tony Had walked back to his room with the two super soldiers following close behind him. He threw himself on the bed as Steve and Grant looked at him from where the doorway.
“ Oh god...” tony whispered. He heard Natashas panicked voice in the background. It was all white noise.
Maria sighed and kissed Tony on his forehead.
Tony sighed. “ Something tells me I’m going to regret this.”
Tony gave him a questioning look.    They were finally back in Tony’s room  where the could have some more fun and this is when they decided to have a meltdown. Like really? Is this what they were going to have a panic attack about? After all the shit they have been through in their lives they chose this?
Tony Gave him a sheepish smile and pushed his hair back from his face and over than face piece of his deactivates suit.
“ Do you feel attracted to him?”
Tony looked at him, confused. “ Yeah. I’m Iron Man,” he said  like it  was the most obvious thing in the world. Or universe. He was Tony Stark, no matter what universe, he was always awesome and always a genius.
“ shut it you,” Steve reprimanded playfully as Bucky drew up the Blanket to their shoulders.
Tony whined.
He never seen Steve shirtless before in his world. If he did, he was sure he would have turned bi. The man looked like an Adonis.
Bruce walked into the closure and locked the door with a small clock. Winghead stiffened and looked over Tony’s shoulder. He growled in warning as he dug in talons into the dirt.
It dinged again.
“ So...” Tony began.
“ Didn’t have to.”
Barnes opened the door to his office and manhandled him inside.
For fucks sake the guy asked him he he had any incontinente issues besucase of his age and needed  what Steve called “ alternative adult underwear.” He did not need a freaking diaper. He could piss and shit just fine.
Peter ended up going to Harry’s party. Ned was there too but he lost him shortly after arriving when he went to talk to some girl from their chemistry class. Peter didn’t mind, he really didn’t want to be around anyone any way. He was just here for the free alcohol. Peter looked down at the red plastic cup in his hand. How much did he have already? He couldn’t remember. He shrugged and downed the entire cup before heading to the dance floor.
Grant just chuckled.
“ What’s that supposed to mean?”
“ Just warming up.”
Peter gave Harry a strange look. “ Webbing.”
His hand was plastered securely to the ground with what looked like a web.
“ Well if you’re fine, I advise you stop flirting and get your ass out of there. “ Clint shouted back.
“ What is the point of having me here? I’m not apart of your team, I’m from a different universe.” Tony said.
“ Open it up.”
“ I have to agree with Steve on this Tony. It’s probably not the best idea. We can do something else. I mean, we don’t mind lying for it.”
Tony was going to respond back when he heard yelling. They both turned to the entrance of the gym to see Bucky and Natasha trying to restrain an old man wildly waving a cane as Steve tried to duck behind Clint.
“ Nah I rather drop off my girl.”
Morgan just laughed.
Steve nodded and swam closer to where he could pull himself up onto the beach. Howard ruffled his hair and laughed when Bucky nudged him out of the way so that he could be petted instead.
“ You’re so cute in the morning but we have together up.”
“ Please let me explain. You remind me a lot of the Tony that lived in this universe. We have a scientist, a Reid Richards, you may or may not know him but he is big into the multi-verse as he calls it. He believed that there were multiple universes where there different variations of ourselves, some with small differences  and others with other major differences,  where he lead different lives based on the different choices we made. I think you are from one such universe where you are similar to our universe’s Tony but have obviously led a harder life. You are much smaller and skinner for one. You also seemed a lot sadder. Steve got worried about you and sneaked into your room last night, he said he heard you crying and that was when he called me. I thought he finally lost it, telling me there was a Tony in the penthouse crying because he is scared and sad he left his home. I thought he was nuts. He’s had a rough couple of months. He loved our Tony and he seems to live you as well. Wether it is because you remind him of someone else or if he truly loves you for you I don’t know, but either way he seems totally invested in you and wants to know more about you.  He would not have called if he did not care. All these people here would not have tried to make you comfortable if they didn’t care. If they wanted to use you they would have done so by now. They would have thrown you in the lab and made you work. Sam wouldn’t be trying to crack jokes and Nat wouldn’t be getting to defend you. I know that for a fact.
“ How the hell did gothic Jesus get in?” Sam asked.
“ Am I Home?”
Harry sighed. “ Come on Pete. You need to sleep..”
“ Hear that Stevie? He wants to see his friends.”
Harry: you’re probably asleep by now. I just wanted to say goodnight:)
“ Their kind tend to treat both their mates equally and often engage in sexually activities together.”
“ Glare at me lol you like but you know that you cannot just up and leave.”
“ You stubborn bastard.” Tony growled as Steve tried to flip him over and onto the sand. Tony held on and continued to try and open his mouth. He wanted to strangle the bastard for being so hard headed.
“ It’s not like you are any better. I’m trying to figure out why Ms. Potts still sticks around with a bastard like you when she could obviously work for someone better.”
“ Why do we need chairs?” Bucky asked as he stroke the hair of a red headed woman on his lap.
“ Shit, Petey-pie you know how to pick him. Dad freaking hates him. Does he know his son goes to your school?”
“ I hope they kick your ass if you say that,” Tony huffed.
At that moment Tony squealed in delight as he grabbed his tail. And hugged it to his chest, oblivious to the world.
“ I don’t know what to say Tony. I mean I’ve never had to deal with mermaids before.”
“ Hey it was a hell of a vacation. I have no complaints even if the reason was kinda screwy,” Rhodey laughed.
Bruce chuckled and tapped Tony’s thigh.
Tong dragged him off the bed and dressed him the the spares clothes he had bought for him ahead of time. He forced the man to sit in the couch while he made him a sand which. Tony glared at him as he looked at him with a dopey loves truck look. He already hated this fucker. He sent. A quick text to steve to come out to the pent house. The things he did for him, god why was he such a. Hopeless
Pietro just shrugged and continued to eat his cereal.
“ Loud and clear boss.”
“ Well is that it?,” Steve grabbed him roughly but he refused to wince as his sharps claws dig into his skin, “I’ll be more than happy to return you.”
“ Yes. I already said that Tony.”
“ Tony?”
“ Trust me my ass thinks different.”
Steve thrusted harshly into Bucky pushing him forward into Tony. Bucky began to move his hips in a relaxed pace, however, the pattern was often interrupted with the strong thrusts from Steve. Bucky whined and looked between Tony and Steve.
The last part came out as barely a whisper.
Tony shrugged. “I’ve been injured before.”
Tony scowled. His tower was state of the art thank you very much.  “ I don’t know Nicki, maybe because you enjoy tormenting me? It would explain all those god damn meetings I have to attend.” He retorted.
Beck sighed.
He was awarded with a whack on his head form behind. He turned to see Winghead with puffed out cheeks, tail beating the water angrily. The toothbrush he took earlier was on the ground.
Tony heard his phone go off. He sighed and answered it
“ Is it ready?”
“ Maybe  you poked him wrong.”
“ I think you hurt his feelings jack ass.” Clint snickered over the coms.
“ Doll want me in there as well?”
“ Wow. You would compare life to porn.”
Tony smiled, “ Protects against cavities.”
Peter entered the dining area in time to see Steve in his Captain America apron placing a plate of pancakes on the table. The rest of the family was there. His  Papochka and dad were already at the table with the former in his SHIELD uniform and the latter in a fancy business suit.
With that Tony ran into his room and closed the door behind him. He lanes into his closet and pushed the far wall which gave away to a passageway. He was going to need to talk to Steve for a bit.
Bucky strode into the room when the super soldiers returned. He walked up to Sam and kissed her firmly on the lips with a smile.
“ Tony?”
The balding man glared at him.
“ It’ll be safer back here for you.” She explained.
Stony fic where Tony is in love with Pepper but she grows tired of him so doesn’t allow him to court her anymore. So instead he marries Steve to make pepper jealous. Endgame stony. It’s a series. Last time I read it there were two stories. In the end of the first story Tony runs out from Steve to see Pepper and steve becomes sad  as he realizes the Tony may not love him. The second story, Tony realizes he loves Steve and becomes jealous when Bucky shows up after fighting in the military. Tony becomes upset the Steve spends so much time with him and starts a fight with steve regarding this. This is like a two part series. And at the end Steve and tony end up together.
“ Are you alright? I was worried about you.”
The man turned to Tony with a smile. He was younger looking than Howard and wore a black business suit. “ My name is Morgan Stark and I am Howard’s younger brother and your uncle. That is our brother Greg, the youngest out of the three of us.”
Steve smiled.
Steve smiled. That was all he needed.
“ You’re so tense...and little.. you definitely haven’t been fed appropriately, we will have to fix that.” Steve said softly as he continued to knead his traps.
“ What do you want a DNA test or something?”
Bucky. Steve. Nat.
Harry: not judging. I’m just curious. I heard he was pretty busy. That was all.
Tony chuckled.  “They can’t be that bad.”
“ No shit. He pummeled the living day lights out of ya.” Clint said.
“ Well we can always try more cardio,” Steve suggested.
“ He was a mutant. He had ice powers. And he was Eighteen so he is technically an adult.”
“ My, my look at that pretty face. And that mouth. It wild loom so pretty in my cock later.”
He seemed a little disappointed at the lackluster welcome and pouted. Tony couldn’t seem to find it in himself to care much.
Tony placed his hands on his perfect chest. Oh yes it was definitely perfect. He moved his hands upwards wrapped his arms around Grants neck.
Steve scowled. “ And what did they call you?”
All the Avengers has gathered and were watching the show below of Tony being pampered and integrated into the strange pack rituals of there resident mer-people. He watched as the blonde mermaid braid the hair of one of the brunettes. They all seemed to be involved in some form of grooming including Steve who had began to braid Buckys hair.
“ You idiotic son of a bitch.”War Machine greeted.
Tony felt Grant move from his spot and suddenly felt hands rubbing up and down his sides.
“ Because you are cold hearted and calculating. “
“ Come on the guy brags of the people he slept with in the past. I’m pretty sure he won’t mind. “
“ Oh, Winghead, that is a very interesting scewdriver. Thanks so much.” Nat mocked in a deep voice.
Tony saw a quick movement from the corner of his eye and watch as Winghead dashed to the pool. Before Tony could say anything, he was already in the water. The shrieking has ceased and Tony looked up and was taken aback. Winghead was kissing the siren.
“ And to boot it’s with someone who wasn’t even supposed to be in the line up,” Bucky chimed in.
Steve turned toward Pietro glaring at him.  “ And do I need to worry about you?”
“ What the fuck was that?! I can’t even feel my legs.” Sam whined from his spot in the couch. After training until 3 pm, the team was dismissed and they dragged themselves to the common area.
“ God Steve.”
Tony sat on the couch and took some of the offered food.
Steve just nodded as he stood up with Tony cradled against him. Tony just pointed as he crossed his arms.
“ Ya see him and now we need to go. You are already late for you’re meeting,” Bucky Drawled.
Another one went out. The results were no better.
Steve sighed. “ Listen I fucked Up. Like all this is new to me still and I know I can’t blame it on being shocked or anything... I care for you. You mean a lot to me. I like going to the arcade with you, I like having lunches with and I like to talking to you. These past few weeks that you haven’t talk to me have been hell.”
Tony gave Nat a glare as her grin grew.
“ I was talking about the females. I specifically said females. I don’t know how his grace will feel about this.” Motioning to Tony in utter disgust.
Tony gasped and arched his back.
Maybe it’s the coffee.”
Settle him down.
“ Fuck! You’ve never kissed before have you?” Tony said frustrated.
“ Just a new environment. It can be overwhelming for anyone.”
“ I’m picking whatever I want.”
Steve leaned down and kissed his forehead. Tony wanted to scream if he was given a chance to recover, Steve wouldn’t let him go anytime soon. Steve covered Tony and pulled on some pants before sitting at the edge of the bed to look at Bucky.
“ If you want another one, I’m not exactly opposed to it.”
Winghead let out a grunt followed by a few clicking noises.
Steve groaned.
“ About what.”
“ Are you shitting me? You think I need a support human?”
Tony looked at him bewildered. No, this was not right. His friends were still in that hell hole. He needed to save them! It wasn’t like they could just skip over them. These were living breathing things, ...people.
“ I built the arc reactor in a cave while towing a car battery around. A cast is nothing.”
Tony eyes them both. “ So this little stunt is because we got caught? Big deal.”
Tony turned around and glared, “ No we are not talking about your dads dick unless you want that dick inside me.”
Rhodey shook his head. “ It would make sense for Tony to want to do that though. I mean he did have a hard time in that cave. Maybe he thinks that you two will be there to make it better. I mean he knows you would probably be extremely gentle with him Grant or he wouldn’t ask. Would probably make him almost feel he is re-writing his own memories with something more pleasant.”
“ What pass?”
“ Did Wade ever text you back,” Ned asked during gym as they walked the track.
Tony chuckled.
Tony sighed as he absorbed the information. “ And I’m just some sort of replacement right? I mean I look like the guy he was in love with.”
“ Wouldn’t he have been happy to see you? I mean you were and probably still are his best friend.” Sam asked.
“ Stark!,” Natasha called out. Tony looked over the creature’s shoulder and saw Clint with an arrow now notched in his bow and Nat aiming a gun at the creature. Tony yelped when he felt a wet tongue on his face followed by a nuzzle to his neck.
Peter just wished that he could be with Wade like that. He wanted to show him how much he loved him. He wanted to be serious with Wade. He knew omegas Wades age wouldn’t have this problem. Why should he?
Tony nodded.
Tony gave an indignant  cry and and throws himself on the bed.
“ It’s a good thing we are here. You know to introduce him to everyone.”
Peter was going to respond when the teacher interrupted  and began going over some material.
I was a wreck afterward, but I couldn’t take off time to grieve as my higher ups wouldn’t allow it since we had lost two specialty agents and we weren’t married. It was six months later that I was told I was going to do a solo rescue mission. At that point I didn’t give a shit of whether or not I would survive. I was still hurting pretty bad from Reilly.
Tony opened and closed his mouth but now words came out. Why was he here? Why was this man here in his office? Why were his friends working with him.
“ Ummm.... he doesn’t do to well in public settings. He’s very shy. I think he will not handle it too well if we move our relationship along that quickly. I think it will be better to ease him in a bit. He just has a lot of anxiety.”
“ So when he cuddles with you in the couch it’s not because he thinks his is in a serious and committed relationship?”
Tony eyes widened comically and blushed. Could his father not embarrass him.
The blonde blushed. “ Bucky shut up,” the blonde snapped.
“ You just seem real tired and you did the same problem twice.”
He looked equally surprised. “ I can’t believe it,” he whispered, “ They told me that you looked like him...: but I didn’t think the resemblance would be this uncanny.” He was close now. Tony didn’t realize how close he had gotten. His hands hovered by his sides as if he wanted to touch him to confirm he was real but wasn’t sure if it would be appropriate.
This can’t be the future, could it? They would have at least remembered him. And then there’s the fact that Nat was still alive. This could be a dream. A very, very realistic dream. Maybe he accidentally drank or ate something weird. He always got strange dreams whenever he ate Chipotle or drank tequila. Maybe it’s just one of those times.
Winghead looked at him curiously. Tony just smiled back. The bastard had no idea what was coming.
Frank ushered Tony forward and dropped his leash into Stevie’s awaiting hand.
The other Steve, dressed in a Hydra version of the Captain America uniform, looked at Tony, a small smile on his face. “ I know how important this lab is to you. I won’t ever purposely destroy it. This asshole however,” he turns To glare at the other Steve, “ he was just fine leaving you in Siberia.”
Tony laughed. “ Are you sure this wasn’t some dumb frat bet? To sleep with an old omega?”
“ Maybe i should skip it so I can have an extended vacation- ow! Really Nat?” Bucky Yelped as he rubbed his shin.
Rhodey raised an eyebrow and looked at Tony. “ “When did you start sleeping with Steve?”
“ What should I do about his erection? I feel like he doesn’t get off when we have sex and I’m worried. Should I wait till Bruce comes back? Or do you know of anything? I m worried that it may be some health condition ya’ know? What happens if it’s a blockage down there and he can’t get it up?”
“ French women?” Loki asked.
Harry sighed. “Peter put your clothes on.”
“ I can return the favor if you want.”
“ Buck...”
Tony looked at the screen at the figure curled up on the floor. God damn it. The only time he feels guilty...
Any further conversation with Sam was over for now.
“ God, so big. Oh god Steve.”
“ Good boss,  five more minutes until download is complete.”
Steve heard a loud gasp as he saw the face of a beautiful
Tony raises his hand and gave a thumbs up. “ I’m fine!” He yelled.
Wanda glared at him, giving him a challenging look.
“ Ok Tony. We can keep Bruce here if that  makes you feel comfortable.” Bruce rolled his eyes, resigning himself into one of Tony’s therapy sessions, “As you pointed out, it is important to solve any tension within the team, especially among team leaders, so that we can have a stronger and more cohesive team.”
“ I don’t know what that means.” Tony said exasperated.
“ Wall, please.” Tony said breathily. Steve nodded his head. He quickly Undid his pants and underwear and kicked them off. He grabbed the bottle of lube that was beside Tony, not questioning how it got there. And slicked himself up before pushing his cock into Tony. Tony gasped and reached out and grabbed onto his shoulders and wrapped his legs around Steve hips.
“ I love you too.” And he meant it.
Maria was rocking Tony gently, trying to further coax him into slumber. The boy really needed it. He probably would sleep for the next week.
“ Yeah yeah keep growling punk. That never fucking works on me. I have to report to you that the older Stark decided to throw a vase at Clint after he refused to tell him that you were currently fucking his son.”
“ how about we just focus on you now? Huh? And wreak that little right asshole if yours?” Bucky said in a husky voice as a finger traced the puckered hole. Tony squealed and cuddles back into Steve who had now wrapped hisEld around Tony.
Tony nodded. “ That’s fine.”
Tony just stared at him.
“ Would you have believed me? Would you have believed me that I knew an entire pod of mer-people and that they helped us win World War II?”
Tony had been so shocked that he had accidentally  dislodged Bucky from his lap, causing him to whine pitifully before clamoring back on his lap.
“ Does that mean we should return him?” Bucky asked with a faux innocence.
Tony raised an eyebrow at him as Steve blushed. “ Define be with.”
“ Not bad for an amateur, but I’ve heard better.”
Steve looked down. “ I don’t know...”
Tony Laid back and Steve began to crawl over him gingerly.
Tony looked down and saw a grainy photo of a shape that looked very similar to Winghead’s.
“ I can answer that. I was apart of a war. There were things things called Infinity Stones and I used them and they brought me here.” Tony said.
“ Well we will both participate. I mean I have to put it in you. There’s no way you won’t participate.” Steve said with a confused look.
Tony nodded in agreement.
“ You Mr. Rogers are a menace.”
Wade: I no. I have a plan. Will find you.;)
Beck sighed. “ What’s wrong with the way we do things now? Is it really that boring? I mean we had sex against the window. I think that was hot. Didn’t you?”
Steve face palmed himself. “ You guys are giving me a migraine.”
When they finally stopped, Tony was starting to feel pins and needles in his legs. The doors where opened and one of the men dragged Tony out. He looked around and saw a gravel driveway leading to a large estate. The lawn was healthy green and well cared for. The perimeter of the area was enclosed by a stone wall. Above the wall he could sea a thick sea of dark green trees.
Bucky whined again and gave him a wolffish smile.  His wagged his tail and pawed the ground again. He shrunk in on himself as if to make himself non-threatening and small, but that was not going to fool Tony this creature in front of him killed his own mate. He was dangerous. Tony could only hope he would kill him too so that he could be with Steve and spare the rest of the Avengers.
“ Ummm.... I don’t know, ... your grace.”
Steve sighed. “ He doesn’t remember me. He only sees me as a rival.”
Tony grunted as he felt his body being moved up and down on the bed.
Steve grunted. The next time he bought a hooker, he will make sure to get one that didn’t complain.
“ You never mentioned this when you said you needed help.” Pepper snapped at Fury.”. You could have gotten Tony killed! “
“ Like yeah, Dad. He has white hair.” Wanda agreed.
He didn’t really want to do this. But they were so insistent and it was one against two very persuasive puppy-eyes super soldiers.Grant had a bruising grip on his hips as he continued to thrust forward.  Tony could hear him grunting and the sound of his dog tags jingling.
The knocking got louder and Tony opened his eyes. He looked aprons confused and saw that he was on the ground and leaning against the wall with a blanket wrapped tightly around him.
Tony pushed Steve again and kissed him again.
“ And what makes you think I’ll go?” Nat asked.
Steve turned around to face the reported and began to speak.
That night Tony had time to prepare himself again before Steve came in. He was currently resting on the pile of furs that served as a bed. He was sitting up with a book in his hands. It was about the culture of werewolves. Nat has given it to him so that he could learn about Steve and his pack.
“ Captain! Captain America! Do you believe in gay rights and support the LGBT community?”
He followed him as he watched him travel to the buffet table of desserts.  The man looked excitedly at the display. A dark skinned man pulled him away and seemed to be reprimanding him as Tony sulked. It was probably because his last cholesterol panel was less than stellar and had the tendency to eat sweets before anything nutritious.
“ Should I call the rest? I think they would like to meet the others. No really has been able to since they are so flighty and kinda aggressive.”
“ You don’t need to antagonize him.”
“ Fuck Steve, we got an hour... ahh.. make it quick,” Tony moaned as Steve nipped his bond mark.
“ Shut Up,” Steve groused as he grabbed a fabric napkin and tossed it at Bucky.
“I-I think you should...” he turned away.
“ Sorry I’m late, the donuts took longer than expected.” Steve was speeding walking in with a
“ Ahh...ahhh. Oh... god... Hurry Grant.” Tony whined as Grant continued the thrust into him. He has already came three and was a little too sore to be wanting a fourth time.
“ Courting?!” Tony spluttered.
“ Hey you might as well ask for one the next time you are there which may be sometime this week.”
Tony could feel him smiling against his shoulder.
“ Ok. Same thing with Tony. He has to be attracted to someone to have a crush on them. And he’s attracted to you because he has had a crush on you since he was little.”/p>
“ Nat is that you?”
‘Come on, cum already,’ Tony thought.
Tony snickered at that.
The TV automatically came on.
“ Bite me. I’m an adult and can do what I want.”
“ Dad! That was unnecessary. You have bipolar too.”
Tony raised an eyebrow. Was that the reason why Steve took a private call before he left.
“ Yes really.”
After assessing him. Dr. Strange turned to him, “ Any health conditions or mediations  I should be aware of?”
The attempt of a romantic dinner was obviously not going to happen tonight.
Tony smiled and nodded.
“ Fuck! So good babe. God! Your cock is so big!” Tony started moaning and wailing wantonly.
Here is my first one shot. Hope you guys like it! Please leave your comments:)
Peter laughed. Bucky smiled.
Steve smiled down at Tony. He had pretty eyes that twinkled every time he was happy. He wondered if Tony knew his eyes did that.
Peter thought about it for a second about  Harry’s recent offer.
She held his face in his hands and let out an exasperated sigh, “ Look at this giant little face! Does no one know how to cook you a proper meal here? Good thing I brought some food.” He roughly grabbed him by the arm and began to lead him out of the gym. For such a small woman she was incredibly strong and that scared Tony. He did not want to be on her bad side.
“ Of course, but remember I’m a wanted man.”
“ Clint, Don’t antagonize the new guy. I’m pretty sure you know the answer.” Scott said.
“ Do you want get it over with already? I have a full schedule of staring at the wall after you leave.”
“ Anthony, I have much better things to do.”
Peter turned to him, but before he could say anything Harry interrupted.
“ I’m sorry my dear but I can’t have people questioning my authority it can lead to unrest.”
“ Love you too, babe. Fuck... fuck he harder. Fuck me until I can’t walk.”
Peter giggled when he saw how much longer the sleeves where than his arms. Harry shook his head. At   Least he would be dying for someone as cute and sweet as Peter when Stark finds out where is son is and whose clothes he is wearing.
“ Are you sure this is alright? I mean I don’t want to hurt you.” Steve asked, voice laced with concern.
Tony shook his head. “ No. very bad idea. It will freak him outs. “
“ You fucking told the press basically that you hate gays.”
Clint grumbled and glared back at Steve.
“ What do you mean by that Steve,” he asked slowly. Grant had now taken to the bed, head between his knees with his hands firmly gripping his hair. He was whimpering pitifully.
He felt Iron Man begin to piston his hips faster. “ Come on baby. You’re almost there. Come for me.”
They have learned a lot of new information. So Tony decided to make a mental checklist.
“ See Stevie! He has friends. He may be a little happier with some friends.”
Peter: because I order it every time
“ It doesn’t matter Tony. He still goes to high school. He is a child.”
Clint groaned. “ Make him shut up. He hasn’t shut up since we left the park.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“ Heard? They basically shouted it in the middle of the conference room,” Wanda drawled.   “ I don’t think there was anyone who did not hear it.”
Steve smiled shyly.  “ I was hoping we can watch a movie. The kids are already in bed so they shouldn’t interrupt us.”
“ See watch me,” Tony instructed.
Tony stared at him with a. Raised eyebrow.
If grinding felt this good, he could wait until penetration. It would be awesome.
Tony look between the blonde and the man named Buck. What was going on? Why would it be important to introduce him to everyone?
Bruce shrugged. “ We are about the find out.”
Steve sighed. “Lock him up with That Rhodes servant. Tell
Steve leaned down and kissed Tony’s temple again. “ Just tell him love, he’ll become annoying if you don’t. “ Steve said gently.
Then all went black.
“ They are werewolves, one of which thinks I’m his new pet.”
“ They were supposed to be operatives right? That’s what I read in the files from Shield.”
“ One more?,” Tony asked.
“ Steve nodded.
Strange waved his hand and a chair appeared out of thin air. He sat down and crossed his legs, making himself comfortable.
“ You wear red, white and blue.”
Steve his Irons Man’s Shoulder, causing him to grunt. “ Enough! I don’t want them to hurt you! And guys stand down. I’m fine. He wasn’t hurting me.”
“ Stevie, listen, I know what you are thinking.”
I would love to hear your feedback! Let me know what you think! And what you would like to see for a Strange and Tony relationship. Also, I’m looking for a Steve x Tony story where they or in Vormir looking for the stone and Steve pushes Tony off the cliff and begins to cry. Tony was begging Steve not to kill him because he had a daughter. Please let me know if you know the name of it.
“ Hi, Steve. We were all worried about you. You aren’t in trouble. We just want to get you home.”
Peter sighed as he saw the alpha run to his group of friends, who were laughing and pointing at him.
“ He honestly loves you. Everyone here does.”
Tony massaged the appendage to fullness.
“ Yes, just go ahead and pout. Let’s see how far that gets you.”
“ We are here because Rhodey came with Sam.”
“ The Captain And Commander we’re indeed rigorous in their training today. Even as a god, I felt strain of their regimen.”
“ I’m not sleeping with him.” Tony said frustrated.
And with that Tony sprinted to the losing deck before either super soldier was able to stop him. Maybe he can release some frustration on a bunch of villains.
‘ And I would look equally good naked on the bed,’ Tony thought. He could just imagine how he could rock Steve’s world. He wouldn’t be looking at another piece of ass for the rest of his life.
Winghead just purred in response.
Winghead blushed and hurriedly scurried  a distance away from Tony and offered him another fish, not looking at him in the face.
Howard continued to glare at him.
“ It’s not decent. You shouldn’t be dressed like that.”
Tony worried his hands as he sat of the kitchen island as Steve cooked. He had been in the bed next to steve the night before and couldn’t sleep, with the fear that he was going to be killed in his sleep.
Steve leaned down and placed a chaste kiss on his temple. He then reached forward and grabbed a pastry, handing it to Tony.
Howard turned and glared at him. “ And why not? As his grandparents, we have the right to see him.”
“ Well they tend to clench so deliciously tighter when they are scared and struggle.”
Behind them stood a blonde man around Tony’s height, dressed in jeans and a shirt. He was idly shaving his nails with an Emory board while the other two fought. Tony noticed the collar on his neck and knew he must been a human slave.
“ Your grace, I had a different idea for tonight.”
Sam rolled his eyes. “ It was a joke and besides” he turned toward Tony, “ Once you go black you can never go back.” He gave Tony a sultry once over and a wink. Bucky and Clint were both wheezing at this point.
Tony smiled and reached for it. Thank god for small mercies.
Tony gulped. “ Nothing ma’m”
“ GET OUT! GET THE FUCK OUT!” Tony shouted and threw the bottle of scotch at him. Steve ducked to avoid being hit. Steve looked up and saw Tony turned away, his shoulders shaking as he sobbed.
“ When did I get here?”
“ Steve hand me a beer,” Grant asked. Steve tossed him one and sat down next to him with his own.
“ So Tony is captures right? You Grant are like an evil Hydra prick but then Tony changes your mind and then Stevie here comes rescue him and then the both or you save him. Then he rewards you for your service,”
They panted heavily and Tony looked up into Steve’s eyes and smiled, “ I love you.”
He noticed the mermaid loved to cuddle a lot. Whenever Tony was eating, he just curled around him and start to purr. He wasn’t sure of it was a mermaid thing or a Winghead thing. Whatever it was, he made sure he had constant contact with Tony.
“ Aren’t you going to say hello to me too?”
His sisters were already at the table. Sarah was his half sister with blonde hair and blue eyes and the oldest of the girls at age 8. Winnifred was his other half sister and six years old with brown hair and blue eyes. Maria was his full blooded sister and had Tony’s brown hair and doe like eyes. She was four years old and smiled happily at Peter as he walked in.
“ I don’t know where you are going with this.”
He looked around as he went and noticed it looked very similar to Central Park, except... it seemed cleaner.  He kept walking. He noticed some people where giving him odd looks. He pulled his hood up and kept his head down. He didn’t need to be recognized as an outsider, that would only cause trouble.
“ Hey,” replied back.
“Oh! Oh god!” Grant muttered. He gripped Tony’s hips tighter, trying to move him along faster. Grant began to moan loudly.
Instead of hitting the ground, he felt himself collide with something midair. “ Got ya,” Grant said as he swung through the air from a grappling hook.
“ I asked if you needed any help carrying your books.”
“ I know I did. But I can’t find it.”
Tony shook his head. Why the hell did he have to deal with this?
“ I’m glad to see you’re awake. My name is Dr. Strange.”
Bucky sighed and looked down at his plate, saddened by his sons behavior.
“ It’ll be easier for us if I’m in my stomach.”
“ It’s not you fault my love. Don’t ever think that.”
“ I think I’m a little too old for you.” Tony said all most dismissively.
Bucky smiled. “ You won’t want that to happen darling. You would miss my dick to much.”
“ Really?”
Stephen Strange gave him an unimpressed look. “ Nice to see you too. I guess Mr. Banner was not lying about there being another Stark from an alternate reality.”
“ Come on lets cuddle for now. I tired and I don’t feel like talking right now.”
“ Probably is. I never met him, but he seems indestructible.”
“ Steve you got to stop this, you are getting out of control.”
Steve nodded. “ Just be careful. I don’t want you to get hurt.”
“ Anyway the first phase is just home crying a whole lot, listening to Tony’s favorite heavy metal music and movies on repeat while curling around Tony Armani suit.” Bucky explained.
“ He means that we are embarrassed babe. Not by you. By the fact that we got caught. And you know...”
“ So you know Tony and I are intimate.”
Tony was cut off when one of them grabbed him roughly and pushed him up against the wall with his arms held securely behind his back. The other one quickly walking in and locking the door behind him.
Steve smiled. “ You’re a sweet bitch, but that’s fine.”  He flipped Tony over and pulled him up by his hips. “ We werewolves have been doing this for centuries and we enjoy it very well, I think you will too.”
“ Yes. I’m a sorcerer remember?”
“ God your so beautiful...so smart...so perfect. “ He placed a soft kiss behind his ear and kept moving his hands up and down his back.he felt Steve lean in and rub his erection against his ass. His hands traveled upwards again and he began to massage his shoulders. Tony closed his eyes shut.
“ Well, He would have been a good choice.”
The silver haired boy chuckled,” I’m guessing you have a different view on that then his majesty.”
The Slave-master advised.
Tony peppered kisses on his groin and licked a strip on the front of the sweat pants. Tony withdrew his hand from Grant and pulled down the front of Steve sweatpants and underwear to pull out his erection.
Peter shook his head. “ Can you just hold me for a bit.”
“ Tony, you forgot to sign some papers again.”
“ Harry!”  A group of girls squealed as they walked by. One of the girls, a pretty blonde, walked up to them and latched onto Harry’s arm.
“ Ahh! My bambino! I miss you so.” Maria exclaimed.
Tony glared and was about to respond when Steve growled. “ What the fuck is wrong with you? I don’t want him euthanized!”
Tony Stark: Beloved Friend, Teammate and Lover.
He bent down to read it and hoped.
“ Tony you scared us to death.”
“Why the fuck are you here?” Tony growled.
Howard explained.
“ Do you like like me as a teammate or like me as you want to fuck?” Both blushed and turned away. Tony guesses that was the answer.
“ Have you heard anything about Steve? He hasn’t come by yet.”
“ Can you three just leave? I got this under control!” Iron man snapped.
Steve tilted his head and gave him a confused look. “ What do you mean?”
Tony tried very hard not to sigh as the current bane of his existence strolled in with Bucky in tow.
“ I thought all people like you dress like that. You know fags.” Steve wished he hand t said it the minute it came  of his mouth.
Like dealing with him.”
“ Yes it is. You want to look at the merchandise before you buy.”
“ I swear I didn’t know that was your wife! I wouldn’t have flirted with her if I knew!”
He glared at Quentin over his shoulder, “ Mark my words Beck, hurt my son and I will end you. “ he growled.
Clint flicked him off. Bucky chuckled as he went into the kitchen. He came back with a pop tart.
“ What would you like to drink?” He called out.
Just a short chapter. I’ll be bust coming next month and I don’t know when I’ll be able to write again. I hope everyone enjoys this new chapter.
The elevator stoped and gave a soft ding. The elevators slowly opened. Tony gasped at the sight in front of him.
Tony didn’t respond.
“ Tony...” Steve gasped. He moved up his ministrations twirling his tongue around the head of Steve’s cock. He released in his mouth not too long after that.
“ And he was against me in your little so called ‘Civil War.’ Of course I wouldn’t want to be alone with him. He will always take Steve’s side and will be bias. You need to be here to Monitor and stuff.”
“ Your home is very beautiful.”
“ No. but I have done anal and I’m about to blow your freaking mind.”
‘ Yeah, That fucker.’ Tony thought. But he just smiled. “ No, I’m think I’m good.” Lately he has been bringing up His age more and it was starting to piss him off.
“ Your welcome.”
“ But, honey,” Tony whined. “ Help me. Pretty please.”
“ We like you.” Steve spluttered out.
“ I know,” Peter said as he returned the kiss.
Tony looked at the crazed look on his face and cuddled further into Sam for protection. She stroked his hair to comfort him.
“ Your older than Poppa.”
Iron man traded his lips with a metal finger. Steve opened his mouth and let him push his fingers in.
“ Do they go to your school?”
“ Well I asked an expert and we went to you know.”
The man walked up to Steve and showed him the paperwork.
“ Stevie are going to take Tony down to the lab today?” Bucky asked.
“ Tones, I know you have been under a lot of stress lately, maybe it’s time for a break. We can go to your Malibu house today if you want. The Air Force will let me go if you need me. They are willing to please you as long as you supply them your goodies.”
Tony rolled his eyes. Damn. He didn’t want Steve to find out. Strange placed a soft kiss on the crown of his head and pulled back.
Also I am looking for a Peter x Tony fanfic. Tony starts talking dirty to him in bed and insults him. It Hurts Peters feelings but he doesn’t say anything as he doesn’t want to upset tony. Please let me know if you know the name:)
Bucky kissed Tony’s cheek.
Tony grumbled and went back to his shake.
Tony patted the area next to him.
Tiny looked at her startled. “ He tried to kill you?”
“ What not getting enough action at home and have to live vicariously through the two super soldiers?” Rhodey quipped.
Grant just ripped it open when it seemed like the zipper wasn’t giving away.
“ Howard.” Maria calles again.
“ Well if you want we can go skinny dipping later.”
“ Yes. And he also told me that you not Steve wouldn’t intentionally hurt Tony even though you both had before.
“ He’s already happy,” Steve retorted.
Caution.
“ You mean Google.”
Tony almost missed the sound of the cap opening and the finger that was tracing his hole. He stiffened slightly bunt just enough to get Steve’s attention.
“ I know what it is,” Tony hissed.
Great. Now he has to play along.
One such advice that was semi-beneficial was how Tony could only have sex once a week due to his age. He said it was bad for his heart to get too excited especially with his already weakened heart and that the rough rutting if a werewolf can hurt his hips as age makes human bones fragile.
Steve smiled and wiggled to the other side of the bed.  He laid in his side and allowed Iron Man to spoon him from behind.
Tony wanted to roll his eyes. He would be happy if the guy knew how to be a proper fuck.
Tony sighed. “ I don’t know. Grant is afraid he will snap his neck if he sees him. He is still-“
Bruce sighed. “ I feel like this is going to come bite me back in the ass.”
“ Phil this is the one I’m interested in I appreciate an answer.”
The minute Tony entered he was embraced by larger arms. He felt Steve nose his neck and his hard on rub up against him.
Steve smiled. “ Very.”
“ Well.... um... I thought he was beautiful and- um.... it was very uncomfortable to move,”
“ Come on, you know I have plenty of experience. Why don’t you try to do like  do a role playing thing but with like Hydra?”
“ But Brucey Bear, I need this. We need this. Steve and Grant are always fighting and you did such a great job with with me and my issues, you need to must help. Think about the team. How can we function as a cohesive super hero team if we can’t stop arguing and attacking one another.”
And that wasn’t the worst of it. No, of course it wasn’t. The blonde bastard now decided that he would prevent Tony from going outside and that is where he now found himself.
“ Father!” It yelled.
Bruce sighed. “ I am saying to treat him nicely. You don’t have to return his feelings but don’t treat him like crap. Remember the other guy really likes him. And right now he is feeling a lot more protective of him.”
“ What happens if he is a trained liar?” Sam asked.
“ Sounds like a dream come true.”
“ He’s Norman Osborn’s son.”
Grant hung up and put he phone and placed it on the sink counter.
Tony closed his eyes and leaned into the touch. “ I want you too. I need you.”
“ I can your grace.”
Peter was in 1st period Spanish when he heard his phone go off.
“ I know. I know Tones, but Christ mermaids really? Have you asked Strange?”
“ Wait... you’re human?” Clint asked in awe.
Tony opened a bleary eye. It was bright and then he saw...
He gulped. “ I... I wanted to start a real relationship with him. I was tired of just the brief kisses and the flirting. I wanted to love him and court him properly like he deserved. I asked him to meet me. I was going to tell him I was leaving Hydra for good. I went to his Tower and...” the Commander fell to his knees and began sobbing, covering his face. “ He shot him! My best friend killed the love of my life! He called him a distraction and killed him!”
“ He’s an overprotective and controlling bastard,” Tony growled as he tore into another doughnut and munched angrily.
Peter sprung upward when he felt the cold water douse him.
“ Morgan thinks the same. He was texting a lot yesterday.”
It was not long after that they all fell asleep.
“ Hmmm.”
“ Hey we can watch a movie if you want. He said you were going to show me that space movie.”
“ What if i don’t believe you, hmm? You Just so conveniently kept all of this from me.”
“ Never heard of it. Maybe it’s normal in his culture. Because you know humans all come from different cultures and beliefs. Did it feel good?”
“ ... So tonight we are here with Mr. Johan Schmidt from HYDRA.”
“ Hey, I’m desperate here. I’m tired of getting my ass handed to me. It’s been three weeks already and it hasn’t gotten any better. “
He focused back in front of him when he saw Steve moving slowly closer.
Tony looked at him perplexed. “ Why did you think it was Rhodey.”
“ So good for me babe. Love you so much.” Steve panted.
“ I just thought it was some weird kink. I didn’t really think much about it.”
Bucky huffed. “ Yes I know you don’t like to be disturbed when you’re in the middle of a fucking session with your little pet.”
He readjusted himself and pulled Peter onto his chest, holding him close.
Steve nodded and followed Bucky’s Lead.
Peter looked down at his paper and Harry was right. He sighed as he scratched through one of the duplicates.
“ Loki?” Tony asked softly.
“ Well I guess I can tell you about myself,” he gave Tony a little flirty smile, “ I have been here for a bit and I was able to research your team Tony. And-“
“ Oops,” Pietro said.
“ Stop you two,” Maria admonished as he directed Tony to his sit,” It’s family time. Stop being so disagreeable.”
Steve’s bottom lip trembled and his eyes watered.
He walked over to Tony and kissed him. Tony smiled into the kiss.
“ I’m only going to say this one more time, hands up” Bucky snarled
“ I know that,” Strange replied calmly, “ But maybe, just maybe, life would be better here. I know you will miss your wife and daughter but think about it, all of a sudden you appear from the dead? And that is saying if this works. Traveling dimensions is dangerous Tony. Who knows what will happen if we send you back. If you want to go back I will help you. Just give me until the end of the week. I have to do some research. This is a very difficult area to Ben for the most experienced practitioners of magic.”
“ You better behave. If you so much as step a toe out of line I’ll will beat the shit of that red head you like so much.”
Bucky just shoved him  forward. “ Move it,” he growled.
There was a knock at the door. Tony turned around and saw his team.
Nat gave him an indifferent look and walked down the hall to where the Quinjet was. The trio followed not to far behind.
“ I’m close too. I’m almost there. So close.”
“ Are you serious? It’s so obvious that he is using you Dad,” Wanda exclaimed.
“ As in what?” Rhodey asked.
“ Is something wrong Tony?” Steve asked as Tony pulled himself away.
Tony shook his head. “ No, I don’t think he will take to well meeting you right now.”
“ So that just gives you the right to snap his wrist in half.”
Wade sighed.
“ Good to see that you are well young sir.”
Tony bit his tongue to quip back at him before speaking again.
Christine eyes widened and pressed and hand to her ear.
“ ‘Are you free this Saturday?’”  Morgan read.
“ Is this supposed to be your new side piece?” He asked calmly.  Clint bursted our laughing.
“ Maybe I should just-“ he was interrupted by a phone ringing the Star Wars theme song.
“ And 22 years your junior. And that was just last month.
“ Of course Director, but don’t you think it’s the country’s best interest to know if there is another super powered person in our midst? Especially one who attacks school children?”
“ Boy, quite your mumbling. I sent you to the finest private schools so that you may master that English language. No speak properly. And secondly nothing is wrong with Dr. Strange. He was one of the finest surgeons in the world. May you could learn a thing or two from him.”
Sam was laughing. “ Man I already like you!”
“ Tony. Don’t call your father that.  He is your father.”
“ But he was never formally arrested or incarcerated. Is that correct?”
Peter get Wade begin to stroke his cock. He made shallow thrusts into his hand.  Wade licked his lips and kissed him again. Peter lost track of how long they kissed, feeling himself drifting into bliss.
Tony sighed. “ Next time, don’t panic like that and please explain yourself.” Grant kissed his cheek and murmured in agreement.
Sam sighed. “ It was long time ago but I loved him. I still do. We were supposed to get married. He had even picked out a ring and was going to ask when we got back stateside, but he never got the chance.
Hi, thanks for all the lovely comments and I hope to continue hearing from you all.
“ That’s what I thought too Wanda.” The red Head whose name was Nat said.
Tony rolled his shoulders and readjusted his robe. It was show time. He opened the door and walked out into the bedroom. Steve and Grant were still dressed and in the bed. They looked up at him with wide eyes. Tony smirked.
“ Ok so since you are the expert, now tell me how do we fix this problem?”
Harry turned toward Peter. “ Peter?” He questioned. The girl glared at him.
Harry frowned a bit. “ Yeah i understand. It’s important to have some family time. I know your dad must be busy a lot.”
Steve just rolled his eyes. Tony states around the room and it definitely didn’t look anything like the pristine room of the Captain America from his world. There were bottles of every known alcohol known to man scattered aliens the floor, discarded articles of clothing, cigarette butts and.... was that a male blow up doll? Tony stares at it, a little frightened by the the fact it resembled him so closely.
Nat was full out laughing by now and Bucky gave her a strange look, but seemed to enjoy her happy state.
Steve places Tony down on a puppy pad. It wasn’t like he wasn’t potty trained, but he did make a mess when he ate.
Sam sighed. “ It’ll probably be easier to start from the beginning. Do you know the Falcon project? The one from the Air Force?”
“ No preferably doggy style and make the target obvious.”
Thanks for the support so far. I’m looking forward to your comments.
Bruce sighed and motioned Tony to sit on a nearby chair. Tony sat down and Bruce sat next to him.
“ Great.” Harry gave him a bright smile.
“ James, my boy!” Morgan called.
Tony continued to walk until he climbed the steps and had entered the enclosure. He didn’t see anyone until. Tony heard a happy squeal and looked at the rock island in the middle and saw Wingheads tail as it disappeared into the water. And before he knew it he was pulling himself onto the beach. He was chirping happily and quickly made his way over to Tony. He butted his head against his good leg and rubbed his body against him. This close, Tony wasted his reddened eyes. If he wasn’t wet, he was sure he would have seen tear tracks as well.
Steve laughed and shook his head in disbelief.
“ Got ya!” He shouted. The figure in front of him disappeared into a mist.
“ I don’t want you to do anything like that to my friends and family.”
Peter sighed.
“ What are you doing here? I thought you needed to teach a class at Hogwarts or something.”
“ So this role playing, its normal?”
“ What are you doing here?”
“ He’s the team doctor.”
Tony looked at him, waiting for him to continue.
“ I just came to check on you,” he said nervously.
Tony felt Someone stroke his hair and gently call his name. The voice was too deep to be Pepper’s and Rhodey would just shake him violently awake instead. He just wanted to burrow himself further into the blankets, so that’s what he did. Fuck this voice. He wants to sleep.
“ Im leaving. Stay here if you like,” Tony snapped As he headed toward the elevators. A blur of white rushed passed him and nearly knocked him over. When tony looked up he saw Barnes there whining and jumping from one paw to the other impatiently.  God he was really regretting this already.
and positioned himself behind him.
“ Just try.”
“ See? We are getting along. Now let’s watch the game.”
Quentin fell to his knees as he felt something Sharp pierce threw his calf. He heard Peter scream in the background but before he could look up he felt some it grab him by his collar and throw him to into the far wall.  Quentin tried to get up and summon a spell to retaliate against the intruder but he was back in the ground as he felt someone deliver a swift kick to his ribs. And as his head hit the wall again, he felt himself losing consciousness.
“ Peter?”
Peter sighed, “ Terrible. They somehow found me and literally crashed into Wade’s living room. I am grounded indefinitely.”
Steve gave a low growl and pulled Tony to his chest. Tony nearly dropped his pastry as he was suddenly jostled.
“ So... I’m having This party this weekend. It’s at the family mansion, it’s like 30 minutes outside the city.”
Tony looked up and saw a balding man in a business suit. He never saw him before.
Wade nodded. “ I can do that.”
“ It’s stuck”
“ We Aren’t planning anything. We just wanted to help with your suit. Ultron is not going to hurt you. He helps us.”
“ What does it matter to you?” It wasn’t rude, but the maliciousness in the tone was palpable.
The team you and the asshole version of myself” Steve huffed at the jab,” lead together. Steve here went to the army for the allies and was given the serum. On the other hand, I was recruited to Hydra with Bucky. But we were never really in combat and when the Axis powers lost the war, it was decided we were to go under cyro until we were needed. We both woke up several times, we weren’t brainwashed as much as like your version of the Winter Soldier. We were placed on full active duty when the Taskforce came about-“
Quentin looked at the hovering drone.
“ How do you know,” he asked.
“ Your grace deserves someone unsullied by others. And he is quite a handful. I don’t want his grace to be disappointed in my establishment.”
Tony groaned as Bucky thrusted his tongue into his open mouth.
“ Don’t worry. The feeling is mutual.” Steve snapped.
Tony smiled and nodded. And he did just that.
“ I knew it was fucking you, You bastard! Now get the hell of my son before I throw you off,” Howard snarled.
“ I think you are mistaking  that smell for the chicken. “
Steve just hummed in confirmation as he pulled away and began to undo Tony’s pants.
“ You were fucking ogling the Victoria Secret models on TV!”
Tony turned up the volume.
“ So... your kids....what school do they go to?”
The baby made a face
“ This is not funny. What type of friend are you? You are supposed to sympathize with me. And then help me solve this problem."
The door opened and Tony wanted give an exasperated sigh when he saw who it was.
Sam sighed.
The two are in silence for a while, Tony enjoying the homemade meal. He needed to leave. Who knew what this Steve would do. The one in his universe almost killed him and they were friends. This one was a stranger and probably wouldn’t have any quarrels with offing him.
“ I can hear you moping from across the jet, punk.”
They both nodded and obeyed.
“ No.”
“ So you can claw me from the inside?” Tony seethed.
Tony nodded and promptly disconnected the call.
“ What did you think you were getting lucky today?”
Nat began to rock him gently and hushed him.
Winghead leaned forward to rub noses with him .
“I’m glad you could eat with me.” Steve started.
Tony got used to the other Avengers over the next few days. He learns that Schmidt is often easily annoyed and that Clint loves to play prank on him. The most recent one included sending him some Hawkeye themed porn. Tony had to admit that the Hawkeye look-a-Like knew what the hell is was doing in bed. He had to give the man props.
Tony began to turn heel when he felt a tug on his pants. He looked down and saw Bucky grabbing onto his pant leg, he whined pitifully as he looked up at him with large puppy dog eyes that should not be in any humans face.
They both opened their books as the teacher listed Off the questions and instructed the students to work together. It really wasn’t that much. Peter could probably get it down quite quickly by himself.
“ I thought I told you to go back to work. He is from a different universe and not your nephew.
The middle of the room was what held his attention though. It seemed to be a large pit filled with blankets, pillows and furs. He guessed it was the bed. He sighed. He really wanted a mattress.
Steve chuckled. “ Whatever you say. Trust try and order something healthy ok? Pepper mentioned something about you not eating properly again.”
Peter laughed as he lightly pushed on Morgan’s shoulder. “ Stop being vulgar. And no I didn’t. We are just classmates.”
“ Look Rogers-“
Maria smiled politely and shook the hand that Peggy offered.
Steve chuckled.
He circled around his hole again. Gently rubbing. He felt his finger softly breached it. Peter jumped and pushed Wade off of him.
“ Of course I am! I mean that is the only explanation. I was fighting Thanos one minute and the next I am listening to you talk about Dr. Oz. If I’m not dreaming I must have ate something really shitty yesterday. I knew I shouldn’t have trusted Rhodey to cook.”
Bucky rolled his eyes. “ No, like regular exercise. He’s older and he’s at risk for health conditions. He also is not as flexible as younger humans. He can do some yoga with Nat to make sure he doesn’t pull or tear a muscle. And I recommend exercise. You should also watch his diet, limit like sugar and such. It can be fattening. They tend to get floppy and fat as they age. You don’t want to see anything jigging other than a a large set of tits especially  when you you are mounting him. Trust me it’s such a turn off.”
“ Did Steve Tell to you about your friends again? I know he wanted to spend some time with you after breakfast and took you away.”
“ Yeah, He is interested in me alright. He has a freaking kid. And aren’t they dangerous ? What happens if they sing?”
That night when tony was in bed he felt Steve get in behind him and pull him to his chest. Steve kissed the back of his neck and placed another kiss behind his ear.
The red head rolled her eyes, “ Yeah, like he is going to hold you accountable. We run you on a conservative platform Steve. This is not that platform.” She said, motioning between Steve and Tony.
“ Well I’m glad is not as a lover.”
“ Bucky!”
“ Have a good day!” Tony calles after him. Peter just waved at him as he hurried to class.
Sam rolled his eyes.
Nat rolled her eyes. “ He is trying to be friends with you and you keep pushing him away. What is wrong with you?”
“ You’re now fun Stevie. Look you made him frown. Just get him his Friends. I’m pretty sure he will reward you handsomely.”
Steve stopped mid step at the sight before him. The man was laid out in his desk, feet on the ground and knees parted with his hand in between his legs, playing with his hole.
Peter pushes him off of him again.
Wade nodded as he pulled Peter’s jeans and underwear off. Once he was naked wade spread Peters legs. He grabbed a packet from his back pocket. He opened it up and poured the lube on his fingers.
Steve pulled back. “ What took you so long?”
“ I don’t care how it looks like. I want it to stop.” Tony growled. “ Would you two quit it?” He snapped. Both whined and gave him sad puppy dog eyes.
Tony nodded.
“ Scotch?” Tony turned a bit to see the blonde man coming over his shoulder.
It explore his mouth as Steve fumbled with his belt and the buttons on his jeans. Tony carded just fingers through Steve’s hair and urged him to lay if body on his own.
“ May I Have some please?” He begged.
“ Well then get creative because this is for Tony and Sam.”
Steve gulped.
“ Don’t you dare lecture me now. All do you leave.”
Hi! Here is another update. Hope everyone enjoys it!
Tony chuckled. “ They’re teenagers.”
“ Yeah, fAt ass, I didn’t gain ten pounds.”
“ Exactly. Now please kindly remove your face from down there.”
“ Ohhhh. What did he say?”
The Commander scoffed. “ No. he was much too smart for that, but he knew I loved him. But I sometimes like to think that he loved me as well and in a different life I would have the honor to call him my beloved. Well then again, he probably wouldn’t want me to call him that in public-“
Tony looked up and saw Steve. He was standing now. “ How-“
“ How much do you think you need to find someone more capable than him?”
Tony waved him off. “ It’s Fine...I just need to rest.” He rush toward the elevator.
“ You know that I’m just a consultant right? And I believe  I already told you my hours and I am pretty sure we are outside of those hours”
“ It’s still polite.”
Hi. It’s been a while since I’ve updated. Please leave  Your comments, I love hearing from you. Also please read my other fic The (Not So Little) Mermaid.
Steve sighed and walked up to the bed. He gently grabbed Tony and turned him onto his back.
Tony looked up at him. Steve looked back at him. He was no longer smiling. He joyful visage replaced by the serious demeanor he associated with missions: the face of a strategical leader. Tony has hoped he wouldn’t be trying to flirt and expect a response so soon.
“ It’s fine. You don’t have to do this.” He said as he took Tony’s his out of his pants and quickly buttoned up. “ I honestly want you for you and not as some sex thing. I don’t want to start off our relationship with you giving me a hand job on your couch.”
But he can’t. Steve’s his best friend who’s absolutely clueless.
“ And there is my handsome nephew!”
“ Did he tell you that you look like Tony Stark?”
Tony cried out as he came. Steve following right after with a grunt. They laid there panting heavily when a loud series of thumps came from the side wall.
Steve closed his laptop and looked up with a blush at Tony. He looked at him curiously, waiting for an answer.
Winghead stopped singing and glared at the two.
With that Tony steered Peter away from a very startled looking Harry. Peter mouthed sorry at him before looking forward and getting into the car.
“ Winghead time to go home.”
Tony gave Rhodey a look for confirmaron. His friend just nodded. Oh hell no.
“ Fuck!” Tony yelled and doubled over as a shrill cry pierced through the air. “ I thought you said this was going to protect me!” Strange was already in front of him hands placed in a defensive position.
“ yeah I guess.”
“ He doesn’t have a concussion right? I mean he seems with it.” Tony was hovering around him, his robe shut tight.
Steve just nodded and left.
“ I didn’t do anything with them!” Steve blurred out and faced Tony.
“ You bastard.”
“ Excuse me?” Tony asked incredulously.
Well at least he could be with his friends.
Tony reaches down between them and began to push up Steve’s shirt until his hands were under the piece of clothing.
“ Babe?,” Tony Asked.” Kinda expecting a good dicking here.”
“Oh my, you’re a bit grouchy today. Maybe you should take a nap.” Steve chastely kissed his temple. What the hell? Did he think he was two or something? He was a fucking adult, god damn it! He did not need a nap.
“ Come on Cap, show me.”
Steve gave a breathy chuckle and pulled Tony’s pants and underwear in one go.
“ Do you mind if I walked with you?”
They all laughed at that when the door opened and a servant  dressed in blue walked in. He gave them a short bow and said that their graces are requesting their presence for lunch.
If Peter were less drunk he would have commented, but this was his 10th or maybe 19th drink. He didn’t remember. And he metabolized alcohol differently. He was still able to get drunk but it took a bit. He knew he had to be somewhat drunk. His head felt cloudy and the room tilted a bit at times when he turned his head a certain way.
Pepper took a deep breath and looked at Tony. “  Um... I just wanted to make sure you woke up in time for your meeting. But I think it would be better if you found him some more clothes. “
“ How do you usually do this?”
“ No. you are being very mean right now. You could have hurt Nat. You are going to think about what you have done.” Winghead hissed and crawled back into the water.
Peter sighed and showed him a text.
“ So is there a Hawkeye in your universe?” Clint asked, suddenly curious.
Steve sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. Shit he was angry.
“ I’ve missed you too. You have to come back Tony.”
“ Really? Do I need to straighten them out for you? You know I will.”
He was then led to a room where Steve sat on a plush couch.
“ Friday, can you here me?”
Tony whirred around to face him, jabbing a finger to his chest. “ Listen asshole, I don’t care what Mr. Fucking L’Oréal cover model says, I’m not that fucking old!”  He snapped, it was just too much. Steve looked at him wide eyed and Tony felt someone grab him by the back of his coat and throw him to the side. Bucky was standing over him with a few of the other men, an array of swords and guns drawn.
Steve laughed and gave him a wet kiss on his cheek.
“ What the fuck are you doing to my son!”
“ Pulling pranks on your team members is team bonding.”
Steve flopped them over, putting Tony on his back and began to thrust wildly.
“ Yeah, His friends with the twins and he gets in more trouble then them. Man I remember when they were all so sweet. Remember when Loki would cry every time we watch Bambi because his mom died and someone would have to sleep with him because he thought they would die too?”
“ Rogers, you don’t have to.”
Tony is taken to the Stark’s estate in upper New York to avoid the press. Apparently there had been a mob waiting for him at the tower. They wanted to see this new Tony Stark.  Of course they did because  no matter what universe, people where still fucking nosey as hell.
Bucky gave an exasperated sigh. “ Stevie, can you move your royal ass? He’ll be here when you are done now come on.” Bucky grabbed Steve by his shirt collar and began to move him to the door.
Steve glared.
Nat just raised a well groomed eyebrow as if asking Bucky if he was sure he wanted to challenge her.
“ You better get out before I throw you out. I don’t want to see you again.”
“ So... what do then call you? Do you have like a super hero name?” Tony asked.
“ What happened after that,”. Bruce implored.
“ What?” He asked confused. Tony lowered his eyes and looked back up at him.
Steve gave him a dopey smile.
“ That asshole wrecked my dads car collection and almost killed us when he shot at us when he thought we were some terrorists. You ducking assholes! I’m outta here!”
“ Oh god...oh god...Tony.” Steve chanted in a raspy breath. And like Tony anticipated, Steve came quickly with a shout.
So maybe he didn’t need saving.
“ He won’t intentionally kill you. If that is what you were wondering. He has developed a strange infatuation with you. Since you went off the grid he has been trying to track you down.  He has a while murder board thing going on in his office. It’s really creepy.”
“ I don’t know what you are talking about. “ Tony said as he picked a sugared pastry.
Steve pulled back and grabbed the lube and squirted some onto his hand. He kissed Tony’s knee before placing a lubed up finger on his hole. He rubbed it for a good while until some magical timer went off inside his head and inserted one finger slowly up to the knuckle. Tony never asked how Steve decided it was time to add a finger or whatever. The entire process of fingering him could honestly be  a lot shorter but if this makes him happy then so be it.
Bucky didn’t respond. Howard pulled his hand back, earning a whine from Bucky.
Steve rolled his eyes as he held onto Tony’s cast.
“ I see you are having fun.”
“ Come one Grant. Give it to me.” Tony panted. That was when he get a sharp thrust from below him. If Steve hadn’t been there to hold him and if Grant hadn’t had him in a bruising hold, he probably would have been flying off.
“ I’m not stalking Buck. I’m just doing to recon.”
“ I really don’t think it’s a good idea...”
“ Anything, including my look alike that nearly killed you with his shield.”
Steve had then fingered him with lube coated fingers and watched as he came apart.
“ Sex. He hasn’t had sex in a while.” She clarified.
Tony rolled his eyes.
“ He’s lucky he isn’t thrown in the Raft.”
“ I’ll like to see my friends.” Tony said softly. Might as well try.
The two men, one a tall, muscular brunette and a other willowy blonde.  Tony wanted to scoff at the names of the two men. Even away from work he was followed by people named after Shield agents.
Apparently Pepper has done nothing but raged on when she saw what Tony was up against. He was glad he brought her along. He could always count on her.
“ If you’re anything like your son, then I think it will take a whole lot more to kill you.”
Harry was responded by a soft snore.
Peter have a sheepish smile and nodded his head.
“ Please drop the topic. I swear you only brought it up to torment me.”
“ It’s nothing. “ Steve said hurriedly. For some reason he really didn’t want to hurt his feelings. Before he wouldn’t have cared but now, he felt guilty for the hurt look that was on his face. It was like he had some inkling of an idea as to what Steve said.
“ Yeah. That’s fine.”
Rhodey gave him a weird look once he had settled down. “ What gives you that idea?”
Nat has for some reason taken a strong liking to Tony. She would usher him to sit at the breakfast table and make his breakfast, even going as far as cutting up some of his food like Steve occasionally does. She would also brush his hair, with some brush that always appeared out of thin air. She loved to ply pranks on Barton and even had prank wars with him.
“ Hey, squirt. Ready to go?”
“ What school are you going to?”
Frank eyed him dangerously. Tony lowered his head, “ Sorry your grace. I spoke out of turn.”
“ Mama,” Tony said happily and kissed her on the cheek.
Hi here is the next chapter. Hope you like it:) please leave your comments. Also please give ideas for additional stories:)
“ It is. Teaches everyone how to live together.”
“ Call the fire department. Ow! Nat,”Clint said petulantly.
“ Jesus Christ. I know where there is going.” Tony muttered. He turned on his stomach and looked over his shoulder.  “ Come at me big boy. Show me what you got.” Tony said as he wiggles his ass. Steve huffed a laugh
Steve shifted oddly. Tony looked at him strangely and looked downward.
“ Hey it may work, they’ve been giving Stark goo goo eyes  up til now.  He just needs to spread his legs and- OW! Nat that hurts!”
“ Good,” Morgan said.
“ Already babe? You can come. It’s fine baby,” Tony cooed.
“ No.”
“ You can sit next to me.” Tony turned and saw Bruce motion to the open seat next to him. Tony have a small smile and nodded before taking his place.
“ Well I guess that’s my cue. It was nice meeting you Peter.” With That he turned away and walked down the hall.
“ You are such an idiot.”
“ I didn’t know what you would like, so I could one of each,” Steve explained.
“ Easier said than done Katniss.”
“ I’m sorry Steve. I couldn’t help. I’m...”
Steve shrugged and lightly tugged on the leash. “ Come along, you need a bath.”
Tiny glared. “ I’ll have you know that I am quite well off.”
“ And you’re done talking to my son.” Howard said as he nudged Steve a bit away from Tony.
They laid quietly on the bed as Steve went back to his reading.
“ How about you just take off my pants and get to it? I’m horny and I already stretched myself before I got here.”
“ I’m just going to the store, what’s the matter with that?”
Steve scowled. “ Don’t speak like that in front of our guest. I’m sure Thor has taught you better.”
Pietro just shrugged.
“ The other me.. The one from your universe. I’m not Rogers. I’m Steve! I’m Commander Hydra. I am nothing like that poor excuse of a copy.” Steve was shouting at this point, towering over Tony who had slinked back instinctively.
Tony sent out a blast at him and his partner quickly. It wasn’t enough to kill them, just knock them out for a little bit. He raced forward to the vault and began to tinker with it, and it wasn’t long before he was able to break in. The stones were in a case already which Tony placed in his bag. Next to it was the head piece for what Howard had called the Superior Iron Man suit. Tony shrugged and placed the head piece in his bag as well. He was going to need all the help he could get.
The man didn’t even acknowledge what he said the asshole.
Don’t you think I know that?!  Everyone here is just like how I wish they were in my life. But I have a daughter. I have a family back home.” Tony snapped angrily.
“ Bruce,” He whispered from behind a corner.
Please comment and tell me how you like it. I’ll be working in chapter two and I was planning on making it graphic.
“ So I finally got you Spider man.”
Steve immediately rolled off him and wasat his side with Grant. They both fretted over him, asking if he was alright and if he felt like he was injured anywhere.
“ The you will have to be the one to lay down some ground rules for him. Tell him what’s what.”
“I know. I just had it right-aagh!”
Maybe Tony will talk to him if he brought him some flowers. It also worked for Bucky when he pissed off some dame.
“ Can i have a llama then?”
“ When is Honeybear coming back?”
So Stephen Strange was an asshole. Tony was just reminded of that again the minute he stepped into the conference room. God he hates this man.
of the night?” Steve growled.
And dad.”
“ Thank you Ms. Romanoff. As I was saying there is a fire at the nuclear plant down town. They believe 50 workers are trapped at the scene. The QuinJet is ready. Good luck.” And with that the screen went blank.
Steve growled.
“Fine,” he growled.
He moaned and growled and he thrusted his hips forward.
Steve looked up. He had undressed and settled himself on the bed as Tony got ready.
“ What’s wrong Solider? Cat got your Tongue?”
“ And to what pleasure do I owe your visit in the middle
Bucky nodded. “ It’s because you are so stressed out and you still get panic attacks. I’m looking for your best interest.”
Thanks for your support so far. I hope everyone enjoys this update.
“ My name is Harry by the way.”
“ Hey Penis Parker!”
Tony gave a small frown, “ Doesn’t matter. I like a variety of doughnuts.”
Fury turned toward him. “ You are not going.”
“Ahhh. I thought you looked familiar! Your Norman’s boy. My son And I better get going. I just wanted to make sure you weren’t holding him up. You know us Starks: always busy. “
Afterwards he kept telling me how grateful he was and how lucky he was that I was there. I thought it was some weird like respect thing and that he was just happy to be out of that hell hole that he had been locked up for a month. I also was pretty sure it was for show since we were in front of quite a bit of military personnel.  I had told him not to worry that it was my honor and I left early that evening on the first flight out to my post in Germany.
Tony wrapped it around himself and sat on the bed in front of Steve’s stomach.
“ Yeah. The guy I so happened to fire because he was a lunatic and not to mention one of Spider-Man’s enemies just so happens to want to be in a relationship with you. Don’t you think that’s a little suspicious Peter?” Tony snarled.
Steve sighed. Looks like it was going to be one of those days were Tony would be in bad bad mood. He undid his boots and jumped in bed, pushing Tony more toward the center.
“ Trust me I know. But for sirens they take it very seriously and killing ones ownmate or potential mate. He is pretty depressed. He hasn’t eaten since you were dragged out and for the first few hours he was  calling for you. Not that you would be able to have understood, they speak a different language than us.  He has also waited by the door for you hoping that you would come back. And now he is curled up on his little beach, not eating and crying.”
“ It’s like when you buy a new dog and your old dog gets jealous.” Natasha mused.
The Red Skull turned to him. “ I’m presuming you met him before?”
“ Yeah... it was one of my minors at MIT.”
Tony could only grunt in response. Or scream whatever Steve interpreted his noises as.
Bucky glared back.
“ Yeah i could just imagine. But he’s hot though. I would totally sleep with him.”
“ Only because I want to punch you if I talk to you too long.”
Sarah squealed in delight and started rambling on, Tony joining in.
Man with brown eyes and a well trimmed facial hair.
Somehow they made it to the kitchen where the two Steve’s, well a Steve and a Grant, were glaring at each other.  Tony has decided to make some lunch. A simple chicken piccata ( Yes, Steve. I can cook. I’m not totally helpless). That somehow lead to a screaming match between the Cap and the Commander with the Commander stating how Cap does nothing but demean and insult Tony. Tony had to eventually tell them to shut the fuck up or he was going to kick them both out. That somehow seemed to work and they just  kept quiet and glared at one another.
“ Bruce, What is that thing? That is not just something you see everyday walking down the street or in this case swimming in the pool.”
Tony had taken off his pants and spread his legs wide. He popped open the cap and liberally coated his fingers. First he circled his hole with a single finger, getting himself used to the simulation. Tony felt his respirations slightly increase. He pressed it in slowly, gasping once his finger breached his hole. He circled it around slowly. It’s been a while since he had to do this. It hasn’t exactly been on his top ten list of things to do.
Tony was station to pant as he reached up and curled his fingers into Steve’s hair. “ P-pick me Up,” he panted.
Bruce shook his head. “ That I can’t answer. I don’t know what goes on in the little blonde head of his and I don’t want to know. But he does care for you.  It doesn’t help that you look like the guy he had a crush on, but i think he does genuinely care for you. It’s just that he is terrible at flirting and anything with romance. He is geeky and kind of awkward with these things, but he does mean well.”
“ But...he looks so... old.” Loki said.
James just glared at his for a minute, the red hand print still on his cheek.
“ I think I can add a little fun to your night what do you say?” Tony said as he began to lightly stroke over Steve’s clothed crotch. He didn’t know what other guys like but this seemed a good place to start.
He told Tony that he had some work to get done but he would be back later to have lunch with him. He fussed with him for several minutes, making sure his clothes were wrinkle-free and that his hair was nicely combed before giving him a kiss and telling him to have fun and to ply nice with the others.  It reminded of very much of a worried mom sending her child to school.
Steve looked at him with raised eyebrows.
Tony loaded his plate with food and began to eat. Tony let out a moan when he tasted the chicken. He did not expect that.
“ We need to complete a full wellness check on him to make sure that he is healthy and does not have serious medical conditions going on right now.” Bruce explained as they dressed up in wet suits outside of Wingheads enclosure.
“ You’ll be very happy here.”
Tony smiled. This was his opportunity.
“ Bucky it’s me Steve.” Steve said as he tried to approach. Bucky growled louder.
“ piccola mia, mio tesoro“ sHe cried and she wept into his shirt.
Clint just stuck his tongue out at him in response.
He went to the chair opposite of him, but Steve moved quickly and pulled the chair under the table. It took all of Tony’s will power not to roll his eyes. Of course he would be a gentleman. Tony sat down on the offered chair and let Steve push him back in. Steve then hurried to the kitchen.
Meet them.” Tony said scandalized.
“ That will be fine.”
“ Maybe he is just taking a shower,” Steve suggested.
“ Please tell me you are shitting me. I’m am not going through that shit again.” Clint moaned.
Steve shook his head and laughed.He was going to be a pain in the ass.
“ shut it you,” Steve reprimanded playfully as Bucky drew up the Blanket to their shoulders.
“ Oooohhh, busted,” Clint teased as he hopped onto the counter.
Throughout the day.
Clint chuckled in the background. “ Maybe Steve wants to be Tony’s daddy too!”
Peter gave him a sheepish look. Of course he won’t text back. He had a boyfriend. “ Sorry i for busy.”
“ I’ll think about it. In the mean time, I think we should talk about this year’s gala for the foundation. “ tony said, wanting to get oof the subject. Winghead will not do good in meeting his parents. Or his father may have a heart attack when he meets him. Either way, it was what to avoid it at all costs.
“ I’m fine.”
He reached behind him and grabbed onto Iron Man’s buttocks encouraging him to push down and rub against him.
Steve didn’t respond as he stared at him as he reached under the band of his boxer briefs. Steve threw his head back with a soft moan at the contact. Tony takes his fingers softly along the pubic hairs until he got to the area of his final destination. Steve gently paced a hand over his.
“ I do.”
Tony nervously walked up to the table.
“ Look at that.” Bruce motioned to the hologram. “ Come on Tony. Just help him out a little bit. He will be happy to know you are okay.”
Tony could see a plethora of guards following them in his periphery.
“ Well I only got one hole.”
Steve pulled out gently and rolled to his side, pulling Tony on top of him and bringing a tired Bucky closer to him.
Also I am looking for a Peter x Tony fanfic. Tony starts talking dirty to him in bed and insults him. It Hurts Peters feelings but he doesn’t say anything as he doesn’t want to upset tony. Please let me know if you know the name:)
Tony just smiled and nodded. “ Sure. That would be nice.”
“ Friday, how is the upload coming?”
“ Why don’t you just fuck him and get him out of your system?”
It had been three days since the incident. He hasn’t even been back down there. He doesn’t want to see any of the fuckers.
“ I don’t know. Maybe he would like it? He’s only
Bucky sighed. “ I don’t think you will be killed... just...just wait and you will see.”
“ Just let the man eat your pussy- ow!” The man who was arguing earlier said.
“ Just remember he loved you and wants the best for you.”
“ Hey. I don’t mind.”
“ What do you want to drink with dinner tonight?”
“ And What are you doing?”
Tony frowned. “ Stephen there is something I need you to help me with.”
“ Morning beautiful.” Tony’s musing were interrupted by the smiling man in front of him.
“ you got the lube?”
A knock sounded on the door. “ Tony, honey, I need you to hurry up. We will be late for breakfast.”
It’s because of Commander Rogers that I was able to be accepted into their tight knit family and adopt to my life I. this universal plane.”
Winghead had a few clicking noises again
“ But did she say when they were coming here?”
“ My name is Steve Grant Rogers, born in July 4th, 1920. I enlisted in the US army and became a Captain. I later joined Hydra in August of 1946 after the war. My code name is Commander Hydra or Commander for short.”
“ It won’t. I’ll let you picked.”
Steve eventually left Tony some when he dropped his off at what he called the “ Play room.”
“ Is he in there?” Steve asked.
“ Tony has a bloody nose.” Steve tried.
“ Excuse me?”
Steve chuckled and carried him to bed.
“ And why the fuck should I believe what that quack says? He is a looney tune!”
Tony wanted nothing more than to shoot the damn were wolf. The fucker was like an energizer bunny on crack running around his apartment, sniffing everything before shifting back to his naked human  form and rubbing his balls on everything. He had crossed the line when he had began to enthusiastically hump his bed.
Bucky was a trouble maker and therefore a pain in the ass. He would often gang up with Sam and Clint to make everyone’s life a living hell, especially Schmidt. They had somehow gotten a hold of several armadillos and released it on the floor on which is office was located and they ended of wreaking havoc. This Bucky was a lot happier than the one Tony had met and quite the flirt. He was also Steve’s best friend  and seemed to want to help him in whatever way he can. Which apparently included helping Steve win over Tony. He had the unfortunate experience of overhearing a “ how to flirt session” between the too and how to pick up someone. It was really sad to see Steve try and practicing wooing someone. The man was completely hopeless.
Tony laughed when he felt Steve embrace him and brought him to his chest. He felt Steve grind up against him.
“ No way in hell Barnes.”
Breakfast didn’t get any better as Steve took it upon himself to decide that Tony didn’t need that much coffee in the morning.
He was jarred from his thoughts with a light ping from the elevator as the doors opened.
Tony gives him an indignant look, “ Excuse me? Are you saying that just because I’m a nerd I am not athletic?”
Steve looked at him in surprise.
“ Damn! Where the hell did you find him? Can we trade schools? He is hot as hell. I would totally give him the Morgan Stark-Rogers special. So did you ride that knot yet?”
“ What’s so funny?” He asked.
“ Yes, of course, because you need to show how impressive-ow! What the fuck Nat!” Clint yelped as he rubbed the back of his head.
“ Tony we have to take the stairs. Jarvis is disabled and the elevators are locked.”
“ Christ this place is a dump. How can someone sleep in here?” Tony blurted our.
“ Prepare that bath water for me please. I am going to put our new guest there. Put it at ocean temp.”
The door bell rang and Steve sighed. “ Come on!”
“ That... you don’t like them?”
Howard smiled at him and gave him a pat on the back. “ Always prepares and with a plan. You are a good man James.”
Harry gulped.  Harry lifted one arm to push Peter back. “ Peter... I don’t think- what the fuck!”
Peter softly pulled his Hand from Harry.
“ Avengers! Loki has been spotted in Central Park.”
They came five minutes later with large condoms for Steve, lube and an omega dam.
“ Yep. Yes I know what they are used for. Bipolar, anxiety, depression. He usually stuff. I’ve been off them for a week. I think I need to be back on them.”
“ Maybe my ass is magical,” Tony smirked.
“ It’s the responsibility of both partners. It makes it more enjoyable if both participate.”
Beck looked at Peters pleading eyes. This was going to be so embarrassing.
“ Gonna pup ya’.... gonna pup ya’ good.... my bitch....”
Tony held on to Bucky’s head as he felt his hips move on instinct. Steve pulled Tony’s head away form his mouth and began to assault his throat with kisses and bites. There would probably be love marks in the Morning but at this point he did not care.
Tony blinked up at him owlishly.
Tony gasped and covered his mouth. Shit that idiot was going to get killed.
Tony smiled and nodded, following Bruce into the kitchen.
Winghead whined and flopped down on the bed.
“ See, at least you can admit that you hate me and refuse to acknowledge me as you son.”
Tony sighed. “ I know.”
“Please we don’t have to-“
“ I didn’t want you to leave.” steve said a little louder.
Tony began to move slowly, pushing himself up and slowly letting himself fall back down. The first time, Tony gasped. Tony did it again and gasped in pleasure again. He started to pick up the pace and felt Steve’s hands on his hips to guide him along.
Out of all the people it had to be Clint who delivered the food, some spaghetti and garlic knots from Tony’s favorite restaurant. He just snickered surreptitiously and gave him a look that said he would be bringing this up later.
“ Pretty good. I’m still getting used to this place. Do you have Spanish first period, by the way?”
“ Never said you were. Tony I like you for you. You are smart, funny, caring... a bit crazy, but
He thinks that Tony must be in love with him since he went to go get him and that I’m too controlling of him and forcing to be with me.”
“ Tomorrow, I’m going to take you to breakfast.”
“ You beast! how dare you talk about my son like that.”
“ Behave. I swear you are worse than a child.”
Peter: Can’t meet. Still grounded:(
Tony squealed when he felt Steve rub against it again. “ Harder Steve harder.”
Pietro got up and began to walk to the elevator with Wanda following behind.
“ It is...kinda... everyone likes different things.”Steve said as he pulled himself  off of Tony.
“ Ok, that good. I would like to first discuss what goals you may have and what issues you would like to address.”
Strange suddenly petted Tony on the head. “ Don’t worry, I know. I can give you the meds and you can pick them up today at a pharmacy. It’ll be under a pseudo name of course.”
“ Yeah man. Just tell him you think he would look sexy. “
“ It was worth a shot.”
“ It can’t be that bad, to spend time with him if you have to,” Pepper said. Great now she was on their side.
“ I love you Tony and I don’t want to do anything that upsets you ever. You can always talk to me.” Steve whispered as he ground his hips into him.
Wade: So do you feel like Mexican today?
“ Shut Up. I know the rules about baseball.”
“ But people break up, we can...”
Tony looked up and saw Clint in a nearby tree.
“ I’m glad to see that my lab is still intact. I didn’t know what to expect if I left you two alone.”
“ He’s in my fucking pent house!” He moved out of the way to show Winghead on the floor with Pepper wiping the blueberry residue off of his hands and mouth. He cooed under the attention, as if he hadn’t had attacked her previously. He had happily smiled at Pepper and held out a handful of pie. Tony guesses it was a peace offering of some sorts. Either way, Pepper has felt comfortable enough to help clean him up as Tony made a call to Coulson.
He just nodded. He followed the rest of the group to the elevator that was to take them down to the training area.
It worked for that little girl on Game of Thrones. She kept repeating names right? And then she was able to kill them. Maybe it would work for him. It better work for him besucase he was about to go a while new level of ape shit on their asses.
Please leave your comments:) Also please help me find this fic.
He hoped he will be okay.
Bruce rolled his eyes and Sam just shook his head. They didn’t want to deal with his paranoia now.
“ Oh god! I’m sorry. I don’t know what I was thinking.” Tony said as he jumped up and tried to put some distance between him and Steve.
“ What’s your name?” He asked.
Schmidt nodded. “ So, if you would...”
“ I guess.”
“ Hands up, asshole!”
Tony nodded and took off his shirt and laid on his stomach, his face turned away from Steve. He heard steve drop what ever he had in his arms on the bed and felt an added weight get in the bed. Tony stiffened when he felt Steve straddle his waist and yet again when he heard a cap open. What he didn’t expect was a warming oil to be placed in his back. He startled at the contact.
“ Come on Pete. You gotta put them on.”
“Won’t talk to me.”
“It’s not safe out there.”
Steve rolled his eyes.
He got no response.
‘Yes,’ Tony thought, ‘ You have a fucking two by four as a cock.’ But for once he didn’t say what he was thinking.
“ So good. Bet you’ll smell even better after I mark you.”
Hi thanks for reading so far. Sorry about the wait, I have been busy. I hope you enjoy this chapter and I look forward to reading your comments. Thanks:)
Howard smiled, “ You haven’t change much in all these years have ya?”
Tony gave a convincing moan as he felt the dick slide against a bundle of nerve inside of him.
Both huffed.
He looked at Steve’s face and saw that he was blushing too. Yep. He said that out loud.
Steve sighed as he rubbed the bridge of his nose.
They were arranged in a line and Tony saw a large blonde man arguing with a man with shaggy brown hair that came to his shoulders. Based on their size only, Tony knew that they had to be werewolves. His thoughts were confirmed when he saw their sharp canines.
Steve yelped as his felt his body move backward.
Peter pushes himself away and up the bed holding his arms up so that he could be cuffed.
“ Well... its just that we wanted to I guess role play, but it made the both of us uncomfortable.” Steve mumbled.
“ yes.”
“Better yet, love affair in the Army barracks. You know it happened Steve! Yeah it was incredibly dangerous for homosexuals during that time and you guys could pretend to sneak around and stuff. He would love it. I’m pretty sure we could help set up a mock camp in his lab. And you could probably wear your uniform, I bet it would really turn him on.” Bucky suggested.
Peter sighed as he finally got a text from Ned. He had tried to look for him after first period, but apparently he was sick and was at home. There were also no new texts from Wade. He knew he was on a mission, but he still felt a bit lonely when he didn’t text him.
“ Yeah, yeah, fuck buddies. I know. But does he know that?”
Tony moaned loudly when he get Steve move across a rather sensitive area.
“ Now come on give daddy a kiss.”
The red head rolled her eyes. “ Idiot.” She muttered.
Tony pulled back and smiled. “ It would be really hot if you did me against the wall.”
Tony whined when Grant swallowed Tony whole and Steve inserted his fingers at the same time.
“ What are you talking about? Dad it’s consensual. He’s been touchy feely since I saved his ass and I’m fine with it. It’s consensual . I’m an adult and I can make my own decisions. “
“ I am sending SHIELD agents. You and Banner are to care for Winghead here. I got a report from Strange concerning the care of our new friend and he needs to be given some immunizations if he is to be kept with the others. And remember Stark you are not a true Avenger. You are just a consultant. Also, I don’t want to deal with the fallout if he thinks you just upped and abandoned him.”
Tony just nodded and followed Steve as he dragged Clint toward the elevator by his ear like an angry mother from the 40’s.
“ Oh god. You’re so bucking big. How are you this big,”
“ Well Dr. Oz said that DNA is very precise so this can be Tony.” The Red Skull told Clint.
“ Steves suite. Please hurry.”
“ Really? We always say stuff like that to one another. It’s just friendly banter.”
“ I’m pretty sure I can get it for fifty bucks on the street.”
Tony kissed the side of Morgan’s head and did the same to Peter.
“ Another hooker Stevie?”
“ Next on the list is just is just a reminder that the vacation time sheets will be available-“
im looking for a fic which was kinda dark all the avengers were in like a mental hospital and tony was their doctor im pretty sure it was no powers and steve pretended like tony was married to him or something and i remember a scene where they were all angry because tony was getting swapped for bruce? Not sure if this is enough but im pretty sure bucky was also in love with tony
“ That’s not safe.”
Tony nodded and she removed her hand from his mouth.
“ Well next time don’t hang out with Wade. You know why we are doing this.”
Steve kissed a patch of skin that was peaking over the collar.
“ Well, I told you and I already did my job so I am leaving. Coulson wanted me to relay the message. And as for your leg, if you can get Bucky, that’s the one that bit you, to lick it it will heal immediately. If not, good luck with it because then that bite will never heal And I think that he may be a little more likely to help you now, seeing how much Steve cares about you. Now excuse me, I have a movie night with Christine.”
Howard still looked pissed as all hell.
“ JARVIS, please turn on the thrusters.”
It was Steve.
“ You are really pissing me off,” Steve growled.
“ Winghead...” Tony Warned.
“ You are ridiculous.”
Steve smiled.
He continued his trek down the hall. The aged
“ What do you mean in a sense, Dumbledore? It’s obvious. He has his main squeeze who he is currently fucking and he wants me as the side bitch.”
“ How am I in the other world?”
Tony was about to open the door when heard heard someone scream in pain. Tiny hurried opened it and stopped short. Steve was in grey sweatpants and a white shirt and slippers and standing over Clint who was wearing what appeared to be a Hawkeye themed pajama set. Why someone would make an adult size kids pajama with little super heroes patterning all over the clothing was being him. Steve was giving Clint and murderous glare and was angrily tapping his right foot.
Bucky. Nat. Steve. He wanted to kill them all.
“ He does. Merman usually have two mates. So he was-“
Peter jumped over the last step, remembering that it tends to sink when you step on it.
“ I want you to decide how fast you want to go. This is all you.” Steve whispered softly.
Needs more support in his footwear.”
“ Mr. Stark don’t make us arrest you,” He said in a husky voice.
“ Well he was the original Iron Man.”
Tony turned and gave his best fake smile, “Nicki! So good to see you again.”
“ Christine suggested it. She said I should be more ‘charitable’”
Tony winced. This couldn’t be good.
Tony glared at him. “ That was uncalled for.”
Peter nodded enthusiastically
Rhodey laughed again. “ You will be bored within an hour and start trying to upgrade our planes. Not going to happen. I love you man but I also love my insanity and my job. And you on a base Wyler destroy them both beyond repair.”
Grant smirked despite the tight hold that Thor had on his throat.
Silence enveloped them once again.  Tony savored the taste of the chicken. It really was good. The Steve from his world never cooked and he was pretty sure that even if he did he wouldn’t be able to cook this well.
“ I don’t know, but something is up. “ Nat said.
Tony took off his clothes. He heard a choked noise from behind him. He turned his head with a raised eyebrow.
“ Now that that is settled, why don’t we continue to discuss your future as a Stark,” Howard said to Rhodey.
Tony lathered Steve’s fully erect cock.
“ She must have obviously done something to upset him.” Strange mused.
“ You say that now and then he will insult your man and then you will give a fuck and raise hell.”
“ Does he have a name?”
“ He is. But their species have a complicated reproductive system. To put it simply, they have some males that can bear children and some males who can sire children. The same goes for the females.” Strange explained, unphased by the scene.
“ Who bought you?” Tony finally looked around the room and noticed three other people. A brunette with haze eyes sitting next to a boy with silver hair   And a man with dark brown hair and brown eyes.
“ Umm, Sorry?” Steve asked confused. That was when Tony noticed his attire. Steve had on blue swimming trunks and was shirtless.
Clint growled and smacked repeatedly Bucky who ignored him. Tony just rolled his eyes and smiled, he thought he would never see the day where he was the most mature one in the group. Despite not knowing them and the crowd potentially being dangerous, he was already starting to like them.
Tony opened his eyes and panicked. He went back to the cave when they pushed his head underwater and he couldn’t breath. Tony cried out, afraid. He felt two arms wrap around him, he tried to pull away. But they didn’t let go.
“ Easy there big boy.”
Steve scrunched his eyebrows in confusion. “ A friend?”
“  And who died and made you the boss?” Steve grounded out at Bucky.
Romantic?
“ I’ll need to get up close to him to assess him better. I will use a counter spell so that his singing won’t affect me but it will be limited. And I will need to bring Stark. He will probably draw out your little resident,”Strange was still ignoring him.
“ What?” He asked. Was he missing something?
Tony slapped him. “ Don’t talk to him that way. He raised you and took care of you.”
The man scoffed. “ Well not in his case. Steve was really stressed and needed to burn off some energy and so I guess it seemed like a good idea, but he left shortly after she visited his room. It turned out he didn’t know where to put it and got frustrated and left.”
“ No.”
Once he was semi hard he took his handout of his pants and walked to Tony’s room.
Steve smiled sheepishly, “ I just wanted to see you tonight.”
“ We have discussed the inappropriateness of his behavior and we have disciplined him accordingly.”
“ Maybe he likes it too.”
Steve held still as he gripped his hips and held Tony still as Tony tried to squirm to get some friction.
With that Tony shashayed out of the room, knowing that Steve was looking at his ass. Tony knew he now had him wrapped around his finger.
“ So... last night,” Steve began.
Harry: there this movie coming out next weekend. It’s supposed to be good. It’s by that director that won that award last year. We can go see it after chem homework.
“ I understand the Wade part, but why the Harry part.”
“ I also asked what you usually use as food other than motor oil and coffee.”
It had been sometime since their last dreadful encounter and Steve wasn’t going to let this opportunity go. This was the first time he had the opportunity to actually talk to him.
Steve came over and Smoothed our Tony’s rumpled hair.
The car stopped and Happy announced their arrival.
It went on like that for some time. Then I was worried that I would become pregnant one day and I didn’t want to have his kids so I ended up getting a tubal ligation. That same day, he heard about Rielly and found out that when he was alive he had been apparently sexting each other and part of it was about anal sex. We never done it and we decided not to do it because it was uncomfortable. But apparently in the texts I had been ok with it.
Tony stayed in the bed for a moment before putting his shirt back on and stepping out of the room. He walked out and into the living room where he saw Sam.
“ I’m sorry my dear but I can’t have people questioning my authority it can lead to unrest.”
“ What now?” Tony snapped.
Tony heard the impact  of her landing. The creature lowered his body, as if he were defending Tony and turned his head back to hiss at Natasha. An arm was wrapped around Tony’s body and he felt himself become flushed with a very muscular torso. The creature growl and snarled.
“ That’s nice. Are you kids you know...”
Steve smiled at him, oblivious to the glare that was directed at him. “ I guess you aren’t a morning person, aren’t ya? But it’s time to get up. I need to take you for your walk.”
They both kissed Tony and snuggled into him, falling asleep quickly.
Steve rolled his eyes and threw a pillow at him.
“ Grant hang up.”
“ What do you want to give him? A girlfriend? Remembered what happened with Sharon? Tony went ballistic and she was human. A female demon would fight Tony back and tear my apartment apart.” Tony had apparently been extremely jealous when he saw Steve’s friend and had lost it, trying things and sobbing uncontrollably. He took him to a vet because of his behavior and was told it was because Tony saw him as a potential mate. Steve thought it was all bull until he woke up one morning with Tony riding his clothed cock.
Steve couldn’t be more glad that Loki had decided to get Thor’s attention today even though it had been quite disturbing. He hadn’t expected the smaller god to initiate a make out session with Thor in the middle of Time Square. But the battle left the Iron Man suit compromised which meant Tony had to take the elevator up to his workshop, giving Steve the
“ Oh thank god,” Pietro said in relief, “ Can you like help me with my homework then?  I’m like failing my class.”
Steve frowned. “ You got plenty of friends here. I’m pretty sure you’ll be fine.”
“ You’re just saying that because he hates your ass.” Rhodey teased.
“ And I’m telling you that you need someone. You are stressed. Even if it’s just for the night. Pick someone and I will leave you alone. Having a good romp can do wonders for the soul my friend.”
Bucky growled as he felt Natasha sigh into their kiss and slipped his tongue into her mouth. He urged her into her back and towered over her. God he loved her and what she did to him. He felt her grab onto his hair the way he liked and pulled a bit, causing him to fit against her. She knew how much he like that.
Everyone laughed at that.
Steve looked down the scope of his rifle at the brunette beauty he had been staring at all night.  He watched the man turn around and gave him privy to that tight ass.
“ Get undressed,” He panted.
“ Fine I’m sorry please continue.”
Lunch was just as he could have predicted a total fucking nightmare. Steve has bumped Rhodey off a chair to sit next to Tony. Clint had threw breadsticks at Sam. Then his father had to argue with his brothers. The worst part of the meal was them senile old men decide to reminisce about earlier times.
Tony raises an eyebrow. “ I think that tent in your pants says otherwise. You’re hard.”
All Tony wanted to be treated with right now is some Xanax and alcohol. Shit this guy was terrible at sex. He looked like a god and Tony would have no problem licking down his abs but damn. He really sucked at this. That blonde guy was not joking. This guy could at least shut the hell up. He sucked at sexy talk. Tony didn’t know what his angle was, but whatever it was it was a big turnoff.  Shit it was bad that his cock didn’t even get hard. And does he really need to call him a bitch? He’s not a fucking dog!
“ I’m spending time with Tony.”
“ This is Steve.”
Harry shook his head. He was never going to give Peter alcohol or allow him near it in the future.
‘Here it comes,’ Tony thought,’He’s going to bitch.’
“ This changes thing considerably. Tony, I think I could use your help. This country would be in your debt for whatever assistance you can provide us.”
“ Well I like the name Winghead, so I’ll keep calling  him that. You can call him whatever you want. I may just start calling him stubborn bastard instead.”
“ Well Bucky knows”
“ Huh.”
“ Maybe you can garner us a favor. Turn a trick with them, maybe they will take it easy on us next time or better yet not do this at all. Ow! Nat what was that for.” Clint cried out as he rubbed the arm that Natasha punched.
“ I’m good,” Tony said nervously.
Peter looked up at him. “What is that supposed to mean?”
Someone how did his suit or at least get Friday uploaded to the other one and then somehow figure out to get back to his own universe.
“ I-I can do this all day. Bring it princess.” He grunted out.
“ Fuck babe, so good.” Steve kisses Tony’s shoulder through his shirt.
“ Quite a bit actually.”
“ Its Commander Hydra.”
“ Peter where is your phone.”
Bruce nodded. “ Sure thing boss, no problem.”
Meanwhile Tony heard and soft clicking noise and a few seconds late the felt Steve trace his hole with some cold lubricant.
Steve sighed. “ If you get back your suit. You will leave. I mean. That was the only thing keeping you here right? And I’m pretty sure it won’t take you long to figure out how to use it to get you back home if it got you here in the first place. I was enjoying spending time with you and I didn’t want to stop hanging out with you.” Steve elaborated.
“ What do you mean? Wouldn’t you want to know why your teammate was acting like a total dick for the past couple of weeks with training? “
“ Hey there buddy.”
“Platypus be nice with Stevie. He wanted to take me out to have some fun. And I want him to be here. He’s being supportive.”
Before Steve could retort he saw Iron Man roll off the bed, his body shielding Steve, despite the fact the arrow was not aimed for him, as he dodged a familiar looking arrow.
He was very apologetic and kinda crazy afterward. He was like on high alert for everything, still is but was worse back then. He had even cut his hair like Reilly had it and dyed his hair dirty blonde like his so he could I guess compare to him. That was god awful. But he still occasionally cuts it like Reilly’s haircut when he feels a bit insecure I guess.
He waltzed into the room and headed straight to the bathroom. He had been looking forward to trying that jacuzzi bath tub. He undid the sash to his robe and let it fall. He turned on the water and the thrusters and jumped in when it was a decent height. He floated for around for a bit, letting the little jets push him this way and that way in the water. Tony held his breath and flipped over for a quick dive.
“ uh huh. I may just happen to decide to clean the place right before you finish your shift. I think I can clean the kitchen table just as you walk in.” Peter said huskily.
“ Don’t worry mom, he’s clean. He always wears a condom before he screws me. Hell we even use a dam when he eats me out.”
Beck placed a kiss on his soft brown curls. “ You are too sweet my love.”
“ You two that is enough. I will not have you two insult Tony.”
“ Yeah? Want faster?” Steve asked as he pistoned faster into Tony. Tony could hear the sound of skin slapping against skin at this point. ” Like that baby? Is that good baby?” he asked, voice raising.
“ I-I can explain.”
“ Peter.Your name will be Peter.”
The man with the dark hair shook his head. “We didn’t mean it as an insult. It’s just that Steve... well... he has standards I guess you can say-“
Bruce looked up from his plate. It looked as if he didn’t want any part of this conversation. He looked meekly around and swallowed.
“ Oh! I know them. Sorry I didn’t connect the dots.”
Harry: we can also try that sushi place that opened near school just last week if you like sushi. I know it’s not for everyone.
Coulson smiled as he walked backward to the elevator. “ We need to make sure he’s healthy. And if he’s happy, he will  maker better decisions and make healthier choices. Example not trying to escape Shield and trek across New York in the middle of the night.”
“ I’ll see you soon.”
“Hey,” He said as he lowered himself to the sand.
“ Morgan!” Peter exclaimed scandalized.
“ Huh, I didn’t know your Dad Could move that fast,” Clint commented.
Steve was looking away from him, blush prominent on his face.
“ And I don’t give a shit about my salary. Now both of you need to come with me. We have things to discuss.”
“ What the hell?” He muttered. He looked down and saw his suit in taters. So he hadn’t been drinking again or dreaming. There was a battle, there was Thanos and an entire army. He pressed on the nano housing and withdrew whatever was left back in, leaving him in his black tracksuit that thankfully obscured the nanites. He didn’t want to stand out, wherever the hell he was.
Tony pulled back and placed his own hands on Grants stomach. He can see Steve out of the corner of his eye, moving behind him and and grasping his waist. Tony began to move. He rose a little ways and fell back down, tearing the movement. Grant gasped when Tony went back to being fully seated in his lap.
“ You didn’t even know what I was going to say!” Tony whined.
Peter gulped before speaking again. “ So, uh, your new here?”
Tony smiled. “ Yeah. No problem.”
He ignored Tony and hissed at the intruder.
“What the fuck is that?” He said as he looked at Clint’s meal.
Tony cooed as he looked at his food and then turned to Steve , he waved a claws ow at him happily. Steve smiled and waved back. The one time he didn’t wave back had led to a crying Tony. Tony squealed and clapped his hands happily. He made grabby hands at home and whined.
Tony felt something akin to fury well up in him. Who dared to lay a hand on these children?
He slowly crawled up until it reached his nipple. Peter sighed at the contact as Harry played and teased the nub. He kissed Peters cheek and looked at him in his eyes.  He smiled as he gently stroked his cheek and played with his hair.
Tony wrapped the cloth around the sole of his foot the best he could. He had decided it was a brilliant idea to run his mouth again and like last the soles of his feet were beaten and he was separated from his friends. He sighed as he threw his head back and let it hit the side of the cage. And on top of everything he was crammed in this small metal cage with wrought iron bars where he had to crawl to get in.
He floated over back to the beach and helped Tony push himself upward before following suit.
“ And we have more pressing issues than your little gay exploration. Now come on.” With that she turned and walked away. Both men Groaned and followed her out.
“ I actually met him through a friend.”
“ I think I am better than this dipshit. I don try to hurt him and the minute I start to get intimate he decides to freaking clock me. And you know what is the worst part? We had agreed to stop fighting before this but he had to get all ticked off because Tony wants me more.”
“ Rhodey,” Tony whined, “ I called you for a reason.”
Tony gave a confused look. “ I am Tony Stark.”
Steve shook his head. “ How about this. I will order a side dish of the Alfredo with broccoli and you just have to eat a quarter of the plate.”
He tried to sit up.
“ Baby can you wake for me?” A husky voice asked.
Also I am looking for a Peter x Tony fanfic. Tony starts talking dirty to him in bed and insults him. It Hurts Peters feelings but he doesn’t say anything as he doesn’t want to upset tony. Please let me know if you know the name:)
“ Is it because you hate Spider-Man? “ Peter whimpered.
Bucky added another finger and began to jerk himself off.
“ Yeah, i guess it is. My parents are out of town and I will get the house to myself for the week. So I decided what’s the harm of throwing a party or something, you know?”
“ You two knock it off before we lock you back up again.” But glared at each other one last time and muttered a “ Yes, sir” and went back to eating their meal.
“Bucky stop antagonizing Clint,” Steve said.
“ Are you fucking serious?! How are you exactly ‘Steve’ if that’s your real name,” he spat, “ how the fuck do you k ow this guy.”
Tony turned to Peter, “ I’ll be picking you up today ok? Happy had some errands to run and won’t be able to.”
There were a mass of bodies, pushing and grinding against one another. He moved with the music, raising his arms over his head before letting them travel down his body sensually. He was a good dancer. He knew he didn’t get that from his pops, who was still a terrible dancer even after all these years. He got it from his dad. He even thought him a few styles like the waltz and some other moves.
The vampire groaned and flashed his teeth. He large hands were currently massaging the globes of Tony’s ass. He leaned forward and nipped at the exposed collar bone in front of him, making Tony winced slightly. And that was one of the reasons why he was a bigger nuisance to deal with than usual. He had been more nippy than usually, leaving bite marks and bruises littered  all over his body. “ Watch the teeth there, Dracula,”
Tony looked away.
“ I don’t know. I’m debating to moving to Cambridge with you when you go to MIT.” Tony said without looking up from his phone.
“ Yeah so that he wouldn’t die.” Tony said.
Peter nodded, a bit shy.
“ And ruin the slumber party? Never.”
“ But you know... former Hydra agent?”
“ But...”
“ Oh my fucking god! You are a fat ass! Holy shit,” He chortled.
“ Baby. I’m sorry. But that not the reason I don’t want to have sex with you.”
“ Mother she was legal and she consented.“
“ What? And your colors are better?”
Tony sighed and closed the album, putting it back on the table.
“ Dad,” Tony whined.
“Oooohhh, really?” Beck said with a small smile.
“ So you everyone up in the middle of the night besucase you had trouble getting it on?” Sam asked. Him and the rest of the Avengers were in full gear and gathered in medical. Well all of the Avenger’s minus Thor who was getting ice for Steve’s back. Steve had a few pillows under his back and had to offset his body a bit to the side so that he wouldn’t put pressure on it.
Tony glared at Rhodey. The asshole pretty much knew how it was going. He just wanted to provoke him. Tony took a deep breath and counted to three. He wasn’t going to give in to his anger today.
He just huffed and pulled himself further up the bed.
“ He has apparently uploaded this video. Please stay tuned.”
“ I’ll cook is something. What do you feel like Mac and cheese or just the Mac?”
