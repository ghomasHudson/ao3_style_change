It was a matter of suicide or a bottle.
He could see it, the moment Steve started to plan, after a pause, a moment to regain his bearing – and that, Tony could tell, was not Steve plotting something that would help, not at all, that was Steve planning an idiotic move akin to some kind of coup that he'd rather brand as a resistance, regardless of the fact that at some point he'd have either to surrender or get rid of the powers in place. A resistance, that sounded nice, didn't it? It sounded principled, justified, and absolutely great, except when it ended up happening against your own government and then the line between enemies and friends blurred so much you ended up convincing yourself you were the good guys, when really you were doing just as much damage as what offended you to begin with.
Steve had been missing something alright.
Tony was at a loss for words, which allowed Cap to continue, and...
Blood pooled behing his teeth.
“As a king I might not be in a position to comment, but I asked you, Tony, as a friend.”
Some people called it arrogance, he simply called it not letting people walk all over him – because if he did, he knew how the story ended, and that was with him being taken for granted and treated like shit every other day. Not everyone needed their survival skills the same way.
“No Randall Pierce persona this time, Stark.”
Tony couldn't say he knew the feeling, but there was always the possibility, the potential for him to have done something back when he still drank, something that he didn't remember. There were things he didn't remember doing, and the thing was, maybe they were of no consequences, but maybe they weren't.
“I could make you the same offer, you know.”
At first Tony wasn't an alcoholic – no one was, at first. At first he drank socially, at first he could stop whenever he wanted. At first it wasn't a problem. Then something happened, and that period when it wasn't a problem was gone. He wouldn't be able to tell you which drink was the one with which he'd walked the line, but he knew there was one.
When he woke up from surgery, there were two SHIELD agents outside – considering how much he contributed to the agency, an agency he had created, thank you very much, blame time travel for that, he wasn't really surprised – the doctor who'd saved his life, and Don Blake and Jan. No one else.
Well. That could be his anger talking.
But hey, approximations, and Steve's point still stood.
The problem, here, wasn't that Steve wouldn't believe him if he answered the question.
The most important, though, was probably the one screen where Tony's first encounter with Kang was being played over and over again. Anthony had no recollection of it, as the story on the screen confirmed – not long after he'd become Iron Man, Kang had walked into his home and had had a conversation with him, not that Tony had listened to any of it, and the time-traveller had then made him forget all about it.
Not that anyone would.
Even in the darkness, with only a few lights from the city outside, Tony could see Steve's stubbornness settling in, the man already convinced that there was a way out, a solution Tony hadn't thought about. And maybe he was right, maybe Tony had missed something, or maybe something would be invented soon that would make saving him possible, and that was why Tony would continue looking, but maybe he was wrong, maybe nothing could help Tony and nothing would be found to change that in his – admittedly shortened – lifespan, which was why Tony wasn't going to hope and be certain of his happily ever after.
He needed to do something.
He'd probably do it, too, if he survived this.
“Hell, if it would save everyone else's lives, I'd hand him the goddamn bottle myself, without thinking twice. At least that way he'd only destroy himself."
But it was the first time it was so evident, so permanent. Even back when people had known about his health issues, even after he had been on the verge of dying in public, it hadn't been what people saw when they looked at him.
Hopefully it wouldn't happen – at all – in the short time Tony had left.
His eyes fell on the open file as he turned to around, and he clenched his teeth.
V'ra leaned a bit closer.
He wasn't good enough anymore, and he acknowledged it.
The LMD, hands in pockets, waited until they were alone before asking:
“And, you see, because you do know the problems a cape has to deal with, and because none of them do stick with you in those problems, and because they don't consider you one of them, well. You have the outsider and the insider's view of the situation. So, I've got to ask: who else would make sure things are fair for both sides?”
Not that Steve would have said any of that out loud, no, but he'd have pinched his lips and set his jaw in that special way that told you exactly what Captain America thought of Tony Stark.
As it was, Tony didn't particularly care if an employee mouthed off at him, as long as they did it with a reason – and Captain America not appreciating his offer of friendship was a reason, even if it wasn't one he liked to think about. But that was the whole problem, wasn't it? Tony Stark was the walking stereotype of the worthless and disdainful millionaire to Steve, wasn't he? And there was nothing he could do about that.
Captain America was a good man, wasn't he? A bit too idealistic, and obviously way too optimistic about how this was all going to end, maybe, but a good man. And Tony might doubt that his offer would be met with anything but disdain, he might not believe that it'd do anything, but he had to try.
But Tony wasn't Iron Man, was he?
God, that hurt.
“Where was Tony during all that? Did he think, what, that he didn't have any responsibility here? That he'd... done his job, and that was that?”
Ah. No. Two things, he guessed. Brainwashing could do it, too. At this point Tony wouldn't be surprised if Steve thought that was the real answer.
Not that it was going to happen again, of course.
Spider-Man twitched under Steve's gaze.
Yeah, because there were two timelines.
He decided to give Steve a bit of a truth, a bit of a lie, just enough that perhaps, he'd make another theory out of it, of the real relationship between Iron Man and Tony Stark. Not that Steve'd get it right, because he never did, because he already had his blinkers on, but at least, he wouldn't be able to say he hadn't been given a hint.
But hey, Iron Man wasn't Tony Stark, thus Iron Man couldn't complain.
Maybe Steve should start looking into this – Tony would do it for him, but Tony was dead, and Tony wasn't on his side. That was, if anything, something he could do in the mean time, before he got an idea of what to do about SHRA.
Which one was the worst?
“Except, time passed, and well. I talked to Tony a few times, even during the fighting, and...”
After all, Tony was trying to be responsible here: he might not have noticed right away that he had crossed the line, but the moment he'd actually endangered innocents because he was flying drunk, he decided to stop being Iron Man. He didn't wait for the second time it went wrong, he didn't refuse to accept the truth. He could obviously not continue being a reliable CEO for SI, so he was stopping that too. What was the point of fighting for your rights to something when all that would come out of it would be more hurt for everyone else?
“I'd really, really like if we could work together on this one, Tony, but don't forget, I'm in your head. I know you're already overextending yourself between the Avengers and the company, and you're going to be busy trying to repel SHRA, or at least trying to contain it. I can't ask you to help me on that. So I'm just... I'm just going to make you forget about all that, and just deal with it on my own. I... Take care of yourself, Tony.”
Tony sighed, already regretting having decided to pass by the mansion – which he had apparently lent to the Avengers at the very beginning of the team, to the point that sometimes people he didn't even know looked at him funny when he came by his very own place, come on – as Jan asked him the question a second time.
Steve wasn't done, though.
Not quite what he'd said, but the slip was intentional, and of course Jan latched onto it right away.
Steve didn't look back to watch Iron Man's reaction – there wasn't much to see, with the armor on, anyway. And for all he knew, dream-Stark himself had paid the sniper.
Like the fact that they didn't actually have the right to claim themselves the best hands, to say they knew better all the time, without exception, and that of course if something happened they'd handle it themselves. Which was kind of ridiculous, actually, considering the Avengers had always more or less reported to higher authorities, at least when one of them had been involved in something dubious – or worse. Members had been pushed out when they'd done some problematic shit and didn't agree to even justify themselves, and some had even walked out by themselves when they'd thought they were endangering the team because something had to be done but someone would definitely pay the price for that. Steve should know, by now, that a level of cooperation was necessary for it to work – more than that, for them not to get arrogant. Wasn't it what he'd blamed Tony for, after the armor wars?
“I'm sure you'll make a fine leader, Captain.”
Or maybe not. Maybe he'd still end up alone in the end, but at least he was trying.
One from before Steve made it clear that Tony Stark wasn't worth his time, even less his friendship.
He was starting to defend himself, which never ended well, but he supposed there was only so much verbal abuse a man could take before snapping back. The problem being that Steve would probably use that as an excuse to escalate the whole thing. He always did that.
He'd keep an eye open, because the things he'd seen in this life... you didn't just dismiss the possiblity of time-travel, or premonitory dreams, but all in all, he didn't think there was much to it.
And Steve still didn't get it. He still didn't get that the whole point was that Iron Man did what he had to do so that Steve wouldn't have to endanger himself any more than necessary, so that other people wouldn't have to pay with their lives for what he could have prevented, so that other heroes wouldn't have to dirty their hands when it was absolutely necessary and when he could do it instead.
Tony sighed, and scanned the Helicarrier again, just in case someone had gotten closer or an enemy had started doing villainous things – it happened often enough, after all.
The man looked him over – again, as if to ascertain that his eyes weren't tricking him – and muttered that he didn't remember Tony looking like that – “that young, that...” – when he'd gotten him out of Afghanistan, and Tony had barely been twenty-three back then.
There was a terrible sound – the shield hitting the floor just the right angle, Tony knew that sound all too well by now.
No, that couldn't be right. Steve was going out with a girl named Bernie Rosenthal, for starters, and Tony knew that Cap didn't fool around, and certainly didn't pretend he liked someone just to dump them afterwards. Moreover, Steve had never indicated that he could like men too – then again, considering how the 40's were about that kind of things... Also, Steve totally had the right not to say it out loud for everyone to know if he didn't want to. Still, Iron Man was just an armor; Steve didn't even know what he looked like underneath – wrong, he did, but he didn't know he did, and that was definitely for the better – except for the eyes, and Tony knew for a fact that having the helmet on made his eyes look a few shades darker, so, not even the eyes, not really.
Steve took a deep breath, and.
“Adapting SHRA to the individual? That's... counterproductif.”
It didn't matter, because Steve wasn't finished.
“Well, Carol threw me out, and Pepper Potts almost did as much, when I asked them.”
T'Challa was taking care of the Red Skull in the background, while the hypocritical idiot spewed stupidities about “your kind” and whatever, as if not literally everyone fell into the same traps over and over again, as if, especially, nazis didn't – and wasn't that a laugh, when the Red Skull was always beaten back but never seemed to learn? – and Tony trusted the Black Panther to do the job adequately while he tried to, maybe, help Steve and Falcon stay alive.
Maybe Lockhart should have let him – after securing Jarvis, of course.
“I understand enough. Mr. Stark is... he's... he's ordering you to do this.”
Except that particular approach to their problem only worked as long as it was their relationship in the balance, just like not talking about the elephant in the room – Iron Man's loyalty to Tony – had only worked as long as nothing bigger than the both of them had come in the middle.
Steve took a step back, assuming whatever he was assuming right now – probably that Tony had been horrible to Iron Man while drunk, or something like that.
Steve looked horrified, tense, and absolutely unable to punch the problem in the face, as he turned Tony around and took a good look at the chestplate – assuredly wondering about what it hid, about the damage under the metal, about how much it hurt, and that was not something Tony would tell him because they couldn't change anything about it and they didn't need more people to worry about it. It was bad enough that he'd had to tell Pepper and Steve about the problem at all.
“What do you mean, unless I really fuck it up? I'm pretty sure they still execute traitors in this country. Seventy years in jail doesn't sound that improbable, considering.”
“Steve... A doctor would have to take the chestplate off to even get a look at my heart. And if I take the chestplate off, I die.”
“If you're not convinced, man, why are you still doing what he tells you to?”
Steve felt weird for a moment – on top of the pain, he'd learned how to ignore the pain a long time ago – and then he was on the ground – it was alright, he knew wounds, and frankly this one wasn't going to kill him unless they didn't get it treated, he was going to live and be told what had happened exac...
“Tony.”
Of course, he knew how some people saw him. He wasn't exactly surprised that not everyone was willing to even give him the benefit of the doubt, that some always and without fail believed the worst of him – ugh, Firebrand – and made up their opinion of him regardless of any facts.
“All the registration in the world isn't going to bring those kids back.”
It couldn't be that Steve actually believed Tony's bodyguard had gone rogue, could it? No, of course not. Steve had no faith whatsoever in Tony Stark, so he had to suspect “Iron Man” was in fact acting exactly like Tony wanted him to. Moreover, had “Iron Man” really gone rogue and turned against Tony – logistically impossible, of course, but let's work with the hypothesis, since Tony was trying to figure Steve out, and Steve didn't know – the Captain would more than definitely side with “Iron Man” against the evil, amoral Tony Stark.
“It still doesn't address the fact that you fell in love with me when you really shouldn't have.”
V'ra had inched closer to the energy wall as Tony spoke, avid to hear more – and wasn't it telling that he had to be in a cell on an alien world for people to be interested in what he had to say? Now they were barely a breath away – and, an energy wall away, but who was counting?
Good job, Rogers.
Tony shut down the connection.
The only reason he wasn't cutting the chase and not wasting anyone's time, even as he was convinced he would fail to control himself again, one day, was because he was a stubborn fool who thought he could do some good in between today and that moment to come, a stubborn idiot who refused to give up and disappoint people right now, even while knowing he'd just disappoint them worse latter on.
Don glanced at the others, at everyone who was here, just to make sure they were as alone as possible in those conditions, and let go of his arm.
He forced himself to jolt back, as if in denial, as the situation sank in and he came to the conclusion that, indeed, he could get away with being injured if he passed it off as an actual attack against “Tony Stark”. It didn't even have to be anything Avengers-related, because people did threaten him on a weekly basis – at best.
“I have a message for Iron Man.”
Was it...
Which didn't mean that he was necessarily wrong, but... Perhaps he had gone too far, occasionally. Perhaps, if someone had been there, on his side – but Rhodey had been, so maybe it was more of a matter of having more than one single person believing in you – he'd have seen that, he'd have found a better way.
Just before leaving, Fury added that, after the assassination attempt – it hadn't been an attempt, not when Tony was dead, not even if Steve wasn't, just an assassination – they wouldn't get the chance to free him again, so he should really, really think about what he'd say at his trial.
Time to what? Tony didn't ask.
“And what point would that be?”
Miss Potts opened the door for him.
Two days before a business partner that he didn't remember at all had joked and told him he looked like he'd found the fountain of youth, and asked when he'd commercialize it. It was telling, he thought, that a woman who didn't know him as more than an acquaintance could tell, when no one close to him had even commented.
And he wondered why Iron Man didn't want to tell him his secret identity.
Terrible trap, betrayal, how could you do that, Iron Man?
“I'm sorry I missed the chance to see your face.”
If he really wanted to help Carol, he'd be on his way to talk to her, as someone who had a history of alcohol problems, as someone who knew what he was talking about. Except, why would she believe that Iron Man was an alcoholic? And if he went as Tony Stark, why would she care what a stranger had to say?
But, as they all knew. Steve Rogers absolutely trusted Tony Stark, and they went bowling every thursday.
He knew the answer to that one, of course.
He bit his lower lip, hidden behind the faceplate, and felt tears rolling along the edges of his eyes.
“Not even Captain America and your fellow Avengers?”
“But, we both know you care about Tony more than anyone else.”
Without what? He just couldn't go on anyway, not like before, and even if he had to continue, if only to try and make sure he would make at least as much good in this world as he'd done bad, it would remain there; three lives, taken by his hand, as his mind had been taken away from him.
But this couldn't go on. Iron Man just couldn't always be here, especially when Tony Stark was supposed to be present too. Only a few days before, actually, Tony had almost given up being Iron Man – risking his life over and over again – and while he had come to his senses, there would eventually be a day he wouldn't be able to go on being the armored Avenger – if he wasn't killed before that, or if his heart didn't just stop beating either. Or maybe, just periods of time when he would need to take a break and not be Iron Man for a while – as much as Tony was the king of denial, he did know, rationally, that never taking a break would just add to the pressure until he couldn't take it anymore, and then good luck in helping anyone, or even in taking care of his responsabilities.
“I already tried once, Sam. I did, really. I tried to befriend Steve Rogers as Tony Stark, once upon a time, and I already know how that story ends. And maybe it's me, maybe I did it wrong, I don't know, maybe I'm the problem to begin with. Eitherway, I did try. I did, and it was exhausting, a failure, and not gratifying in the least. I'm not willing to try again. I'm just going to continue doing my thing, to try and be the best version of myself that I can be, even if it's not that good, even if Captain America doesn't approve, because I can't do more, and I can't afford to spend more time and energy trying to prove him wrong specifically.”
“Yes, Iron Man. He's been a good teammate and a good friend. So, thank you. I'd never have met him without you.”
Still, Steve looked mollified – enough to listen.
Iron Man was the one who got the heartfelt statements.
V'ra hadn't moved, herself, except for taking a step back, and now she was watching him as he stole a skrull's pants, one of his hands on one of their guns. She didn't look quite as assured as before, obviously, but she wasn't backing away. Wasn't attacking him either.
Tony had never bought out businesses only to break his promises and cannibalize them, he had never toyed with the line of what was legal and what wasn't just for the hell of it, he had never done anything that could land him in this category of assholes. And yet, here he'd ended up, as just that kind of asshole.
“Your face, no names, just... something, anything. Please.”
His first name. What was her angle?
As much as someone could be the boss of themselves, at least, and in the facts that Iron Man always followed Tony Stark's decisions.
“I see you all made it.”
Steve, somehow, managed to get even more withdrawn, even more hunched on himself. As if to keep himself safe from Iron Man's influence.
That, he didn't say outloud, because Steve wouldn't stand by it and Tony was not feeling like arguing about the fact that he deserved to die or suffer.
T'Challa, as it was, didn't seem like he had anything to object to that, or at least no direct answer available.
He couldn't hear very well when she spoke next.
Not as far as Tony Stark was concerned, did he?
Perhaps Steve was just surprised to see him up and about at this hour. It wasn't as if the man had had the opportunity to really notice things about Tony's habits – thanks God for small mercies, because if he had then Tony's secrets would soon be up for sale.
Tony, him, tended to go the other way – he knew how imperfect he was, but he still had to act, even with the knowledge that he could potentially be fucking it all up, because if he didn't and something happened anyway... He couldn't allow anxiety to freeze him. Even when he was right, though, he couldn't forget that no matter how rare it was, he could be wrong about that too.
People opened a way as they walked out, barely not uncomfortable at the sight of Spider-Man's costume – good thing Steve was in civies, really. People might still like Captain America, but he'd also gotten a few distrustful looks, which was, he guessed, fair, considering how some of those people might have lived in the buildings they had... in the buildings... around the Baxter Building. Before.
After all, if Steve Rogers thought he knew why someone did something, there was just no way it was for any other reason, was it?
Peter squirmed, and didn't look at Steve.
He had told Rhodey he had been wrong, but that was not the entire truth, if only because Rhodey's own life would have been put in danger, if anyone had seen that hint he'd told him about, that Tony Stark wasn't finished yet, and had wanted to interrogate him.
Not only was this something that would have happened – that had to happen, that he'd told them would happen, but of course since when did anyone listen to Tony Stark? – something that showed why they couldn't go on like this, but more than that, it was something impossible to spin into less of a catastrophe. There were proofs, there was footage, and while Nitro was obviously the most guilty party here, he also wasn't the only one.
Beautiful memories.
That is, not at all.
Tony could only be grateful to whoever had made him kill the ambassador – if grateful was even remotely applicable to the situation, which it wasn't – that they hadn't found the way to manipulate him so sooner, back when he still had the chestplate, back when he couldn't have done this without revealing himself to Steve.
He couldn't tell Steve that, could he? If he did, Steve might finally make the connection, and even if Steve didn't... Tony had seen what he thought of him when he'd understood that he was an alcoholic. He wasn't sure he could deal with Steve treating Iron Man like that too, not now – maybe not ever, but the point here was that he needed to be efficient, he needed to put an end to this, he couldn't afford...
On top of that, Misty wasn't quite as personally concerned as Carol or Pepper Potts had been, which meant she might actually tell him what was going on.
He wondered, for a moment, how petty exactly it would be if he took the helmet off, right now, right here, and looked Steve in the eyes, with a fake smile and the words “interesting theory, Steve. Tell me more.”.
“Randall.”
Once upon a time, Tony had believed Captain America to be overall perfect, with his only defaults correlating to trauma and not actually being defaults, but that was a long time ago. As time went by – more than anything else, as he was constantly confronted to Steve's unwarranted distrust and general hatred for Tony Stark – he had learned that Steve Rogers was very far from perfect. Mainly he could be terribly judgmental, unsympathetic, hypocritical, self-righteous, and he totally refused to admit it except on an hypothetical, abstract level – Steve didn't pretend to be perfect, but somehow, whenever his point of view was questioned, no, this time he was right... and if no one questioned him, he rarely ever considered being wrong until after the deed was done and the evidence glared him down. If the evidence even dared to glare him down. Steve knew he wasn't always right, but didn't really believe it.
Liar. Such a freaking liar. It was hilarious how much of a liar Steve could be, and still pretend he was a parangon of virtue.
“That's all right, Captain. You're only doing what you have to.”
If he could have brought himself to believe it, that Steve wasn't perfect, he probably wouldn't have been hurting quite so much.
“Of course you don't. Just like mutant-you wasn't a mutant. Which, for the matter, brings up the question of whether or not you actually don't remember House of M or if you simply convinced yourself you didn't remember it.”
“But he's... but he's...”
Steve wouldn't see it like that, surely, but it wasn't like Steve ever saw what Tony was trying to do for what it was worth. If Tony had to count on something to make him hesitate, it wasn't Tony Stark's generosity that would do the trick, he knew it already – Steve was already convinced he was a slimy, opportunistic bastard.
A trap. Right.
Handed the tissue box back to Steve, though it was hardly necessary.
Steve's answer was almost gritted out.
“I'm just here because it's not like any of his superpals are going to stand up for his innocence, despite the fact that if we don't contain this situation carefully, the consequences aren't going to fall only on Stark. Basically I'm here to watch you do all the work and glare at anyone who tries to get in the way.”
When Steve walked out of the marshals' transport vehicle, he was surprised to see – the same crowd, with more or less the same signs for or against him, the same people as far as he could tell, except for those who weren't exactly at the same place as he remembered, a white guy who was altogether not there, or at least not visible, a black woman he hadn't noticed the first time around, and with his eidetic memory that meant something – Anthony Stark himself, standing just before the stairs to the courthouse, with several SHIELD agents surrounding him and keeping the journalists at bay.
Then again, he also tended to get stubbornly pigheaded when he had all the energy possible, so.
Steve Rogers and Iron Man were friends. Always.
Maybe... Maybe he could make up something, a program that'd take everything he did in the day and put it in a summary that he'd go over at the end of the day, except he'd have to do it outside of Extremis, in case... in case he was the one responsible, because, as Kang's Tony Stark had demonstrated, there was always the risk that he was more or less conscious and therefore entirely able to undo any precaution he could make up.
Weird that he never put an automatic shutdown option in Extremis, it would come in handy in case of overwhelming suicidal urges. Or, you know, if someone tried to get him to do something terrible, to brainwash him into betraying everyone's secrets, to... Like, a thought, and lights out. No more Tony Stark.
Except Steve didn't tell him that he believed in him, that he was innocent, of course, Shellhead, don't be like that, we're going to deal with it, you'll see, everything will be fine.
“Why don't you come over here and stop hiding?”
“Well, okay. But I don't see how... Uh?!”
Steve looked a weird mix between rebuking and strangely... disappointed?
Seething.
The sound of a rifle shooting. A moment later – almost at the same moment – the burn of a bullet through his collarbone – right through, from his back to the front, and then out again – except...
“Shhh, don't say a word.”
Stark gave him a look – the one who said you were being obtuse, the one Tony didn't use to aim at him, because Steve had never warranted it, but now, now things were different, and...
Don let it go. Even if he didn't understand it all, he still respected that choice – mostly, Tony thought, because outing him against his will would do just as much damage to the team as not doing it – and Tony could trust him not to say anything, at least as long as it didn't become a threat to the Avengers.
Steve woke up in a world, lived out his life here, and when he fell asleep, he woke back up in the second world, and when he fell asleep again, he woke back up in the first, and again, and again. Whether it was the night, a nap, or being knocked on the head – what? It happened – he changed worlds as soon as he fell unconscious. As far as he knew, the past was the same for both worlds.
But it didn't matter that he couldn't hear very well, because the next moment all he remembered was that one of the mutates had dragged him off and they'd ended up shuffling far from the others, but now he needed to get back to them and make sure everything was alright.
He narrowed his eyes, already knowing the answer to the question he was going to put forward. He still wanted confirmation, though, because he could be wrong, it happened, and he acknowledged it, and also because if he didn't ask, people didn't care that they met his exact expectations – disappointment or not – as they liked to believe themselves above such pettiness or whatever. As if them being assholes was his fault for not having asked, as if they would have done it differently if he had.
Maybe Falcon would tell Steve, but for now it sounded more likely that the man was going to slowly realize that indeed, no one would be better off, at any point, with revealing that particular secret.
But he'd take his chance. Not because he believed it would work, but because he knew he could be wrong and that he had to try, just in case it worked – also, it'd allow Erica and Abe to have data and maybe refine the process; even if he didn't make it, it could be useful for others. No matter what the cost of that flimsy shimmer of hope could be to his mental state for his last weeks, no matter how tired he could get when faced with each problematic results, with each obstacle to overcome.
Her upper lip twitched, and she made a weird face that looked way too much like his weird face – even in her own form – for it to be reassuring.
Steve would never offer him a drink, would he? – if he did, Tony would probably do something equally cruel in return. Like, admitting at last that he was Iron Man, that he was dying, and that it was a damn shame Steve didn't want his apology. Then he'd leave.
Once the nurse left, he snorted at the piece of paper in his hand and looked Tony straight in the eye – difficult to stare someone in both eyes when you only had one yourself.
There were so many possibilities of questions, and some wouldn't change anything, because Steve would simply not believe the answers – whereas he might believe a lie, but that was obviously not the point – but some others could make it better.
He probably never would be enough anymore.
Moreover, that'd just antagonize him, and right now Iron Man couldn't afford to antagonize Captain America. He was trying to give him a chance – not even a chance to join him, to help him, but simply a chance to ask, to believe in Iron Man, even if he couldn't believe in Tony Stark.
It was alright.
Which was kind of surprising, considering almost everyone Steve had met since he had come out of the ice, and probably even before that, had wanted the same thing. Everyone wanted to be liked by Captain America – or at least not disliked.
The faceplate had fallen into pieces.
“But obviously... He walked out, he didn't take his responsabilities, he didn't stay at the helm, he... So it can't be a power-grab. If anything, it's him not dealing with what he's done, with...”
As the afternoon went on, Tony absorbed the defense lesson – really, it wasn't that bad, as Iron Man he had to be fit, and mostly it was all about adapting himself to a combat situation where he didn't have the suit and its power. Of course, Steve was, and would remain, more experienced in hand-to-hand combat, fitter, too, because hey, the best of human fitness, which was definitely not Tony's state. But Tony held his own, and managed to gather enough self-confidence that perhaps, he wasn't going to get himself killed right away when he'd go and tackle the Iron Man situation – he had occasionally had to rely on his fists alone, and he was still alive, wasn't he?
All of a sudden he felt like he'd ended up in a minefield and had no idea when or how exactly he'd gotten there. The obvious answer would be all the shit Carol and those who'd registered had gone through after Gyrich had taken the helm of SHRA, and before the Skrulls revealed themselves – Steve was a bit uncertain as to when exactly they'd gotten Gyrich himself, actually, but the consensus seemed to be that the real man had been in office for a time before he'd been taken too. The shit Tony hadn't been there to prevent, to make sure it didn't happen like he'd said he would while backing up Registration, the shit he'd walked out of.
Steve had barely walked out of the room – barely decided that he wouldn't, once again, listen to anyone else than himself, and that his principles meant he couldn't be here for T'Challa and Ororo's wedding, which meant that Tony would have to back out of attending too, since Wakanda was “neutral”, as if Tony didn't know where exactly Steve's side got their tech, and having Iron Man but not Captain America here would not go well with that stance – and here was T'Challa, calling Iron Man by his actual name. If Tony didn't know any better – and as it was, he couldn't actually say he did know better, only that he hoped, only that he wanted to believe – he'd think this was all a ploy to let Steve overhear them, to let him know – except Steve was way too stubbornly sure of himself to not storm out like he just did... then again, he was also just about petty enough to listen in and uncover Iron Man's actual identity, if T'Challa told him what he'd intended to do beforehand.
It wasn't like there hadn't been any hints. It wasn't like Tony Stark had a tendency to disappear when Iron Man came around – though, okay, occasionally someone else was in the armor, and that was obviously enough to fool most people, but Steve, Steve should have known, if he'd really known Iron Man as well as he thought he did.
Was he an instrument, in all of this, or the target?
Then again, superheroes were people too, and it turned out that everyone could disappoint Captain America – if he knew, which he didn't – and lie to him. Incredible. After all, superheroes were to be trusted, right, Cap?
And the fact that it did was the exact reason why Tony couldn't take Steve's offered “help”. Why he tazed Steve, in the end, and went on to do what he had started.
There hadn't been, and yet...
He patted Steve on the shoulder, trying for supportive, not-too-worried friend. Just so that Steve would pick up his general confidence – which, okay, was way lower than that, but they could manage to make it work, they could, if only they both worked on it – and maybe realize that not everything here was a witch hunt, that there actually were important points raised by Registration.
Steve was suddenly taken over by a weird, uncomfortable feeling, and he almost turned around to tell the ghost to shut up, except...
Tony blinked, and focused back on Steve. He was... He was happy to see him. Steve might not yet be his friend, not exactly at least – not that Steve knew, if anything – but there was no reason Tony Stark couldn't enquire on how the Avenger was doing, right? Especially after what had happened with Zemo. It was normal, decent human behavior, and...
...like he couldn't even fathom Tony Stark being a normal, decent human being.
Which was totally not the reason he hadn't come before – because, you know, he had come before, he just hadn't been welcomed – but would probably be enough of a fake excuse. Steve always seemed to swallow up anything Iron Man told him even when it was a blatant lie – “my employer Tony Stark” being n°1. It balanced things out nicely, in the end, with Cap not giving his civilian identity the benefit of the doubt at all.
Neither men could, of course, but they both knew what he meant. The arguments that had happened during the meeting, the arguments that were still going on when they'd left the “break”...
Not that he could, but.
He walked before Jan, in between her and Rogers, and stood his ground just as she had.
“No...”
Except for all the times Steve hadn't, of course. All the times he'd jumped on any assumption that made a terrible person of Tony Stark, even if by the same token it did shine poorly on Iron Man too, not even considering that, maybe, there was another explanation.
They didn't destroy Vision, because Vision wasn't trying to become the next Hitler and invade the world with bots every tuesday, because he was trying to do good.
Steve braced himself for the pain, and got up from the bed to take a look around. It hurt, yes, but, supersoldier. He could deal with a lot more than most people. Which meant that, yes, it hurt, but it was manageable.
It'd be terribly irresponsible of him, to himself, to SE, to Iron Man and to the Avengers, but it wasn't like he'd live long enough for it to become a problem.
It was good. It was.
Behind the mask, he gritted his teeth.
Yeah, Luke, that was the point.
Maybe, this time, Steve would understand what it meant to make a mistake for people like them.
A dry laugh of anger and disbelief escaped Tony's lips.
He had to try.
And, it was totally possible that Tony would enjoy locking himself up in his lab for a few hours, to distract him from all his other problems, just the time for Steve to get there. Just... to get his mind off the fact that, right now, perhaps, someone was using some of his most powerful tech to...
He didn't have an answer. He couldn't... Tony wasn't dead, if Tony was dead, they'd... Someone would have... But they hadn't, and... He didn't... If Tony was dead, they'd have told him. They'd have told him.
Never mind that Tony had stopped drinking, never mind that Tony had stopped trying to be Steve's friend, never mind all the things Tony – not even Iron Man, no, just Tony this time, just what Steve knew about, or, more likely, didn't want to know about in case it challenged his opinion of Tony Stark, millionaire asshole with no ethics and morals – had let go of because some things were more important than his own wellbeing.
“I'd be happy to give you a crash course in the defense arts, Mr. Stark. For starters, why don't you take a swing at me.”
“Your honor is safe, Iron Man.”
“Glad to hear it.”
Absolutely not interested in being friendly or on elaborating.
Steve was here, on the Helicarrier, eating a bagel “Iron Man” had gone and gotten him, while Tony himself just stayed in the armor and listened to the man sell his speech about reforming the Avengers – never asking Iron Man if he wanted to, just assuming that he did, because no matter how many times Iron Man told him he couldn't do it, not right now, not ever, maybe, because he'd lost his faith, because he was emotionally and mentally washed out, Steve never listened, he pushed, and he pushed, and he pushed, until the person he was wearing out without even meaning to just walked out on him or gave up and agreed. And it didn't matter that Tony could be just as freaking stubborn as Steve, because Steve didn't even listen to him when he said no, when he said he couldn't.
“Right.”
But the next thing Tony knew, his table had cracks and Steve's hands were the culprits.
“Master Anthony.”
He wasn't – he also wasn't ignoring the last part, about Tony being dead for him, not at all.
The fact that he could almost feel Steve staring at his back with a frown of distate hidden under his cowl was something he wished he could never think about again.
It had to be good enough for Tony, because there really wasn't an alternative that didn't end in a catastrophe at some point or another.
“Get out.”
“Nevermind that his standing for his beliefs wasn't enough to make the world right again.”
Kooning knew, that much was obvious. Even if Tony hadn't been monitoring his own hospital room after the Argonauts, he'd still know, just by the tone of his voice.
That Iron Man was free of the expectations people had of Tony Stark meant he could do all the things people wouldn't trust Tony to do, that he didn't have to worry as much about friends getting caught up into his superheroics – and, well, that he didn't have to be Tony Stark when he was Iron Man was a welcome advantage, admittedly.
Carol snorted, but gestured for him to go on.
Not that anyone would ever admit that.
Surprise on her face. Carol hadn't known. At all.
“Then there's you. I don't know why we're together on my end, and you don't know why on yours either. How did it happen? Not sure. We know how, but not why, and in the end that brings us right back to the 'how' being senseless. Not only you don't do one night stands, but I'm also everything you hate. I'm a shark, I tear into small and big businesses alike and I don't care who gets hurt in the process. My 'redeeming qualities' are my money, my brain and my good looks. If you look at what I did with my life, I'm trash, Steve, so why are you here, why do you care?”
“No, God, no, that's not what I meant. I... I just thought, beyond the body, I believed that it... It wasn't Tony, just Extremis. That Tony was...”
A glint of red and gold in the corner of his eye.
“I'm sorry, I know you want to help them, but you can't, not yet, if something happens they will know, and I only had enough material to make a sleeping clone of you, not the others too. But, Tony, I swear, we're going to stop Veranke, we're going to free them, just, you have to wait. Now, please, don't scream.”
As if.
What did she mean, Peter knew what had happened to Tony? SHIELD not saying anything was one thing, but Peter... Peter wouldn't.
Steve stopped looking at Stark, because he didn't want to outright call him out, yet still spoke loudly enough to be heard, and not only by the agents next to him.
For once, Cap didn't immediately sneer a “right” at him, and Tony waited, warily, for what would come next. Maybe Steve was just biding his time. Maybe he was keeping the sneer for later, for a comment that he'd think particularly well thought-out, except it would be so far out the window it would just make Tony long for a brandy.
Carol, though, shifted on her seat – not looking him in the eyes anymore. Better to address that first.
Because Steve believed in the world, and had the problematic tendency of refusing to help it when it failed to reach his standards – not literally, of course, because if protecting had to be done, he'd do the protecting, no matter the circumstances, but if it had to go farther than simple protecting and that didn't sit well with him, well. Sometimes Tony wondered if Steve would watch the world burn if it disappointed him too much, simply by pretending that it wasn't burning.
He took a step, held out his hand.
Misty almost choked on her beer, and Steve found himself patting her on the back awkwardly. If that wasn't an indication that yes, something was up...
But Steve didn't look particularly unhappy with mentioning Zemo, and it was more like he had been thinking of something else, something different, but puzzling – and perhaps unpleasant enough too – to warrant that frown on his face.
Steve glared at him as he pushed past and left.
Still. Regardless of what she felt about it all, there was something she'd said, and he needed to address it. Because Tony hadn't...
“I, ah... We slept together that night, and you gave me your number in case I wanted... in case I wanted second servings.”
Lie. He never “met” Tony Stark, but he guessed he could dissociate Iron Man from Tony Stark if he considered the creation of the armor as a meeting rather than an actual creation.
“That'll mean a lot to him, Cap.”
And he pushed the marshal out of the way just as he heard the shot – he took the bullet fully this time, no one for it to go through first, because Stark was over there with the SHIELD agents in the way, and it hurt just as much, except...
The ghost snorted.
The old fantasy of the helmet being thrown across the room, hurled at Captain America's feet, rose its ugly head, and Tony forced himself to stay still.
He was hurting all over. Extremis was reconstructing about half his internal organs, the bruising from Steve's blows, the nerve damage from Vision's attack. It wasn't visible anymore, not after the first hour of advanced healing, but inside was another matter.
Steve looked like he wanted to strangle someone at that – possibly Tony, though he wasn't quite sure which one of him.
Strange, who was also a cripple even if he didn't like being reminded of it – who did, really? – wisely refrained himself from acting like the doctor he was and saying that forcing on his heart like Tony was doing wasn't a good idea.
Not that T'Challa, King of Wakanda, had anything to fear in that regard. He wasn't, after all, concerned. He was a king, he wasn't American, and he had the power and the legitimity to deal with his own country's problems.
He really needed to find the man, and screw his head back on the right way, because... Because they couldn't leave it like that. They just couldn't.
Steve, most certainly, would, if he learned that his best friend Iron Man was really the man he couldn't even have a friendly conversation with, Tony Stark.
He barely had to wait; Steve's voice resonated oddly through the phone – not enough that Tony's throat didn't constrict suspiciously at the sounds he had missed so much. Definitely not a Starkphone. He wasn't surprised.
He was...
Her tone had been brisk and uncompromising, until the point where she'd just stopped.
Or had he?
Anthony was having doubts about whether or not that had actually been the “beginning” of Kang twisting him into someone he wasn't, mostly because the fact that it had happened didn't mean it had actually worked at all, and he hadn't been able to find any other interference from the time tyrant on the very advanced system that was checking over his whole life. Sure, something was influencing him, but he wasn't certain that thing was Kang's eloquence.
That was an understatement, if Tony had ever heard one. Zemo was literally responsible for Steve's stint in the ice. It was the villain's maneuvering that had gotten Bucky Barnes, Captain America's sidekick, killed. Without him, Steve and Bucky would have probably seen the end of the war – without him, Steve wouldn't be presently sitting in Tony's kitchen, and he might even be dead of old age by now, though it was possible that the serum would grant him a better life expectancy than most.
“I'm always busy, Director.”
Misty just stared at him for a long time. Stared at her bottle. Finished it. Signaled for a second one. Steve guessed she came here often enough, as the waiter brought another beer.
Except while he'd been thinking about the future they could have, Clarence Ward had been murdering her as one more way to slander Iron Man and Tony Stark's names.
Tony went to sleep on that disturbing revelation and a disturbing – but expected by now – wish for a glass of brandy, and woke up with a headache – apparently hangovers could be had from not drinking, too – and a hard on, remnant from a wet dream that he wasn't going to forget anytime soon – it involved a lot of panting, mostly, because the images were foggy, probably thanks to Tony's lack of experience with men, but that didn't make it any less memorable when he could recognize Cap's voice and his own in that panting.
“Hmm. So, Gyrich took over, mostly because some people...”
It all went back to one point, eitherway: Tony hadn't done enough.
Good point, though. This time Steve didn't think Iron Man was doing things he knew were wrong – incapaciting the guardsmen, murdering people, the exact same thing, right? – willingly, no, he just thought “Mr. Stark” had done it all alone. See, progress.
But Steve had plans, and his plans were about how not to bow down, not about what came next.
Tony chose not to comment, and immediately went for the reason of their meeting.
The interrogation point was barely audible at the end of the Rogers' sentence, and Tony got the feeling all the other people here were thinking the same thing except Rhodes and Jan.
Anyway, Tony being Tony – or rather, Iron Man being Tony, there wasn't an easy way, no matter what Steve believed.
“Though, I can't say I like the mechanical heart. Or the prospect of recharging it by electrocution, for that matter. How do you bear with that?”
“And the actual truth?”
And if he wasn't, then there still was an enormous problem because that meant that, somehow, someone or something had managed to influence him into acting drunk without actual alcohol being involved.
Barely listening at this point, he almost didn't notice Steve's next words – and in a way, he supposed it would have been better if he hadn't heard them.
Tony glanced at the Identicard, and kept a sneer to himself.
As with much of about all his attempts, though, he wouldn't be surprised if it turned into another one of those “at least I tried, unlike someone else, and therefore the failure is not my own” situations.
His neck cracked as he stretched, and the engineer went to do what he did best – handle crisis no matter the personal cost, until he couldn't anymore and he was the one breaking into pieces, rather than everyone else's lives and safety.
He wasn't sure that kind of influence over him could entirely fall in the friendship-only category.
The question had her startled, and a look of pain fell on her face, but V'ra quickly got her countenance back. She escaped his gaze by fiddling with the armor, apparently looking for the device the other skrulls had used to put it off-line.
“V'ra.”
Tony was still having trouble processing what had happened – a guy who could manipulate all molecules, really? What need did people have for science if that guy, who obviously had no idea what he was doing and might accidentally turn air poisonous on the entire Earth or something just as cataclysmic, existed? – when he heard Steve's voice and looked up. The Silver Surfer had somehow gotten them out of the maniac's crushing machine and on the floor below, and they really, really had to find a way to deal with the Molecule Man before he went all Galactus on the planet.
He'd take his chance, because if he didn't, then there wouldn't be anything left to try instead.
Sure, it wasn't like anyone would be arrogant to think they hadn't killed people they didn't remember killing, it was like, a basic reaction to that kind of accusations, but in the end, that didn't matter, did it? They were still dead, and he'd still done it, one way or another. It didn't matter that no one else would have reacted differently, because in the end he'd been wrong, and more people had died – Lemar, Karzai, he hadn't wanted them dead, but all in all it wasn't like they didn't deserve it, and surely a number of their troops too, but there had to have been idiots down there with them, people who thought they were doing what was right and hadn't yet been made guilty of anything, and all of them, all of them were dead, no exception, no second chances, just, dead.
But the thing was, Steve didn't like him, and so there was no point in pretending he believed Steve could be bought – a laughable theory in any version of the story, because Steve Rogers couldn't be corrupted, though he could be manipulated.
Steve might not like him, but he wouldn't let him open to attacks when directly asked, so Tony was almost certain he'd agree to this. Cap was a good man, after all.
It turned out that Jan too was having reservations anyway, not because she wasn't happy with Tony, but because it was too soon after Hank – something that Tony understood too well, as another of his reasons for breaking up with her was also that he felt slightly guilty even if he didn't, objectively, have any reason to be.
Okay, maybe a bit of an exaggeration. Things could always happen no matter the precautions taken. But it was true that the less precautions taken, the more things could go wrong. Steve had to know that. Rules weren't there to punish those who did nothing wrong, they were there to limit the power of those who did.
And people wondered why he didn't want anyone to know.
Steve tried to turn around as he headed for the breakfast his guards had left on the small table, so that he wouldn't have to see the ghost's – Tony's – face and reaction to that statement, but he still caught the subsequent rolling of the eyes.
Tony couldn't allow himself to reveal who Iron Man was, not even to Captain America – not because he didn't trust the man, but simply... Simply because a secret had to be kept secret to remain a secret, it was as simple as that. But...
Steve got a doopy smile on his face, then, it looked very weird and Tony was totally concentrated on Captain America being drugged – almost – out of his mind because the other thoughts available were mostly depressing and not something he needed right now. Or, like, ever, but that wasn't up to him, was it?
, his ass.
instead of telling him how good it was that he'd made anything at all, least something that actually worked just as well as what already existed – and Howard was right, wasn't he, because people didn't care for solutions that were no better than what they already had, because people wanted perfection, they wanted progress, and they didn't like waiting for it, it had to come right away, an ideal already, with no drawbacks and a nice bow on it.
Tony grabbed the file he had come for and left his office, a sour taste in his mouth and no one to blame for it.
There was the time, too, when someone – he couldn't see who it was, the screen was too dark, it had probably been at night, and anyway that kind of discussion happened often enough to him that it didn't pertain to only one memory – had told him he'd have to trust someone at some point.
It wasn't like Steve's promise to consider it would be kept, anyway, even if Tony honored his end of the bargain. Ending whatever compromise whenever Tony Stark got into the picture seemed to be Steve's preferred course of action, as experience had taught Tony over and over again.
A ruin left behind by the senseless betrayal of a friend they had failed to comfort.
The supersoldier, sure of himself and of the righteousness of his judgment, looked at Iron Man with a pleading look, for him to understand and agree, to say that, yes, indeed, Steve, you know better.
He had an idea, of course, but he still needed to ask, because maybe it was something else, maybe, hell, it was SHRA, but it was only a small part in particular that seemed so terrible to Steve, and then, then he might be able to talk about it, to get rid of it, if only Steve agreed to consider the rest of it...
“I gave my word to Tony.”
Not that Tony couldn't appreciate some manipulation for what one considered to be the greater good.
“Who is Iron Man?”
“What about you, Iron Man? You've always been... anonymous.”
Had Cloak needed to transport everyone in the middle of the city, instead of somewhere deserted?
Tony hadn't even come to see him after he'd come back.
Iron Man, on the other hand...
Steve's eyes fluttered open, and Tony could feel himself breathe freely again – worried, him? Ah! Obviously he had been. Not one month ago Happy's life had been threatened because of him, and now Steve was unconscious for days because of a deadly gas. They were all trying to give him a new heart attack, he swore – not that the mechanical heart would let it happen, not as long as it was charged, and, no, let's not think about that again, please. This was about Steve, anyway, not the moment to whine about his personal problems.
“You're Iron Man.”
Probably that Tony Stark had no business calling him, especially after how their last encounter had gone. He thought about apologizing, but it wasn't like Tony's word had ever been worth anything to Steve. It wasn't like Steve would believe he meant it.
It was the best solution, short of blasting himself in the head with a repulsor.
“You can... You can, uh. I have a bathroom. Over there.”
Steve didn't agree with Stark, obviously, but he couldn't deny that the ghost had a point. Principles mattered more, they did, he wasn't changing his mind on that, but perhaps he'd stopped seeing the consequences of his own actions for what they were at some point because there had always been someone to handle it all afterwards – as it was, Tony, and before him the army – because someone else had always been there smoothing things over, paying for the damage, making sure everything worked. Because Tony had always been behind him, in one way or another, and the moment he'd left Steve's back... Steve had had to deal with the consequences of his errors like never before.
There was a shrill in his tone, and wow, okay, while Tony was kind of happy for the obvious concern, he was also more concerned with the fact that that was what Steve thought of him, and he shouldn't be surprised anymore at that point, but it seemed that his friend could drag him deeper into evilness than Tony himself could think of on his own.
Cap, of course, wasn't finished.
Not at his friend.
This time he would just focus on the fact that, one way or another, Iron Man and the Captain would have to work together again, and no matter Steve's feelings on the subject, they would have to make it work. At least whenever their goals would happen to be the same.
“We're shapeshifters, we don't really care. And, sure, I'm most comfortable in my own body, but that doesn't make yours uncomfortable.”
That was it.
But, couple or not couple – and what did he know? Maybe they had finally gotten together – Pepper Potts had to know where Tony was. What he was doing. Why he wasn't there, with everyone, doing his part.
Steve glared at Tony's ghost-who-apparently-wasn't-Tony-Stark-if-he-was-to-be-believed – which Steve didn't, as a general rule, since Stamford – as the ghost – yes, ghost, suck it, Stark, for now that was how he thought of it – looked at his nails with the look of someone who knew they were getting on their unwilling audience's nerves, but still did it because it was “Important” – or so they said.
Because if he was right... Well. Tactically speaking, he had to know.
The only question was, were they going to be able to get themselves out, or not? Tony knew he could probably cannibalize his very cell into finding a way out, but that was without counting on the fact that he was dying and might not have the time to wait for the perfect opportunity or to make something useful out of completely unknown tech before cardiac arrest. The others certainly had the same kind of problems, if obviously not the exact same problems.
“I don't want to lose you either.”
Barely a second later, Steve turned around and noticed him – full name.
“I... I like to think I... know a bit about that. Not being able to be... someone you've... been, for a while.”
Tony stared at the young man, and somehow his raised eyebrow must have gone through the mask, because Peter squirmed.
“That means that sooner or later, the two of you... and the two of us... are going to end up on the same side. It might be wise to keep our disagreements confined to the civilian world. Might help keep people alive.”
Not wrong, but, Steve, and then what? They'd remain on the run forever and ever? If there really was a piece of advice to give Luke and Murdock, it would be to stick to crowded places, or at least to places where there would be people present to see whatever would happen, because even if Steve doubted Hill's limits – and, okay, she brought it on herself, and by association on Tony too, and wasn't that a riot? – he had to realize SHIELD would not gun them down in front of witnesses when they weren't even doing anything, at least not as long as Registration still had to pass. If he actually wanted to resist in public, it'd have to be by showing everyone that no, they weren't a threat, they could control themselves, and, more than that, they were trying to stay within the law, as long as said law wasn't completely out of it. Not by making them look like fugitives.
Peter took a step back, hands in the air, as if to assure Steve that everyone was alright.
And the fact that Hill looked like she was waiting for him to call her on that lie was giving him the impression he'd missed something rather important. Something enormous, even.
Steve barely looked surprised. He did look angry – at Tony Stark – for a moment, though, before going back to trying to cajole Iron Man into changing his mind.
Steve... Steve was different. Steve inspired people. Steve inspired people, and was a good man, a man with principles, a man who wanted to do good, who inspired others to do good. There weren't enough such people out there. Steve wasn't replaceable.
In the end, he had told Rhodey he'd rather have risked his own life than their friendship, and that was true. Except this hadn't been the real compromise here, and Tony hadn't told his friend that, because for some reason no one ever reacted well to being told that you'd rather risk your friendship than their lives – with the potential lives of a few others on top of it in this case, but eitherway.
Still.
Yeah, he'd tried that already.
Just not good enough to actually try and salvage it when it didn't go the way he liked.
“Don't say that, Master Anthony.”
It was obvious that whoever managed to make this didn't know a thing about what they were doing, except that it would take him out – no matter the damage – or maybe they didn't care. Wasn't it humorous, uh? Apparently SHIELD itself – who? Nick? Sharon? – supplied Steve, from the man's own words. Did he know what he'd actually done to Tony – to Iron Man?
Maybe she should.
“I honestly don't get you. You'd have to be blind not to see that Steve thinks the world of Iron Man...”
No question. Good. Easier to redirect.
“Of course you are.”
Fair enough. But every team had their own complicated structure, their own rules, and believe it or not, Logan knew how to be in a team – kind of, but still, just enough.
“Plans for tonight, Captain?”
There were other superhero teams out there, and even if he backed out, well. The others could still stay and do their thing, just, without his funding and his participation. For now at least.
But he'd have hoped that a child, one whose parents he knew and met occasionally, as Tony Stark as well as Iron Man, would know better. Wouldn't see him as that kind of bastard.
But this wasn't about Tony right now, was it? It was about Jarvis.
Unless, of course, they knew those were monitored by someone, at least. The point wasn't to make everyone unmask.
As if the problem was going to go away if they ignored it stubbornly enough.
Steve never brought up the past problems between them. Iron Man, who wasn't supposed to be the old Iron Man, even if it became obvious that less and less of his friends actually believed it as time went by, didn't say anything either, as he wasn't supposed to know the exact intricacies of the “old Iron Man”'s choices and actions.
Before Wilson could say anything along the lines of “but he could surprise you” or how Steve was a great man and not like everyone else, he added:
Misty gave him a look – and, yeah, he guessed, considering Tony had been the one in charge first, and Tony was a superhero, well, it was, awkward enough a point, but. The next one had been Gyrich, and they'd all seen – not Steve, he'd been busy being dead and reliving all the events of his life, but he'd seen the results – what kind of catastrophe that had been.
“Peter, I think Cap needs to rest right now. All he has to know is that he's safe, and he's going to get better. Okay?”
“I have no idea what you mean.”
Him not taking responsibility anymore wasn't selfish. You didn't accuse someone who had no hands of being selfish for not cooking you your meals. He simply couldn't take responsibility. Him still taking responsibility, when it was obvious that he couldn't handle it anymore – that would have been selfish, egotist, self-centered.
Steve's words made it all too clear.
It took him a few minutes to take a breath, calm down, and force a smile on his face – not that the mask didn't keep it invisible, and the voice modulator would keep his tone covered, but Steve seemed to notice him being tense even in armor at the worst times – after he left the reunion with Hank, Reed, the President of the United States, and basically the whole Cabinet, and obviously Hill's choices and Steve's acrobatics had been half the conversation.
Not that it would decide anyone who didn't want to turn off the Supreme Intelligence to do it, because the whole point of the Avengers was that though there was a “hierarchy” of sort, everyone would still end up doing what they thought was right if they were convinced of it hard enough. But this was a way of reminding everyone who wasn't on Steve's side that he too had years of Avenging under his belt and knew what he was doing, just as much as Steve did know what he was doing, and hopefully, it would bring the others not to be blinded by the Cap Charisma and to believe in their own instincts, in their own conclusions.
“It's Iron Man, Steve. War Machine and I used Kang's own door into time at the Mansion to go and get him from... from before Kang got his clutches into him.”
“From what the newspapers were saying, Magneto got him right in the heart, but that might have been their usually melodrama. Anyway, Tony's injured, badly, and Howard Stark is insulting Magneto, which is not the way to do it when you're in a suit of metal, and Magneto's about to go on a rant about how it's Stark Senior's own fault that now his son is dying before him. Except, except, Tony's looking down at his injury, wide-eyed, blood dripping from his mouth, like he can't believe it, and, no, stopping looking at me like that, Carol, of course I'm extrapolating, the news weren't that informative, but that's not the point.”
Breathe. He composed his face, made his stance carefully blank of any emotions, of any strain – Iron Man was the one who had woken up from a nightmare, from blood on his hands, from the murder of an innocent man in which he had been used as a tool, this morning, not Tony Stark. Tony himself didn't have a reason to be in this state; sure, some tension, some displeasure, anger, even, at the events, at the way he'd have to deal with it, at the fact that someone had died, but Tony wasn't the one who had been used – false, completely false, because Tony was the one in the nightmare, Tony was the one who had blood on his hands, the armor was just an armor, the blood on it didn't matter, the blood, ultimately, was on Tony's hands, and Tony had been the one who had drunk himself to sleep the day before, not Iron Man, but no one knew that.
The sensors on the armor told him Steve was currently squeezing the gauntlet.
Tony didn't point out that he was the one who had gone and broken one of the bylaws to help, to save lives, so there really wasn't a need to convince him of this. He didn't point out that laws existed mostly because following rules made for better efficiency, and that better efficiency allowed the Avengers to save more lives. He didn't point out that establishing a precedent because it was necessary could lead to team members not taking any bylaw seriously anymore – after all, why would they if there never were any consequences?
Next to him, Steve seemed to have reached the same conclusion, but not for the same reasons.
He didn't smile, he didn't say a word, but he did shake his hand.
It was rare for the entire team to be so indisposed at the same time, though. They'd probably see the message soon enough, and even if they didn't, well. It wasn't like Mallen was being discreet. Tony's message basically consisted of a resume about what he'd seen – almost no readings, not with the way the armor had been battered – and his destination, that Tony had figured out thanks to the map Mallen had graciously circled in red – seriously, who did that? Was he worried he'd forget he was going to D.C.?
Iron Man had cost Tony a lot, but in the end, it had always been worth it – even if sometimes it didn't feel like it right away. But now...
Steve almost said something.
Thor took Tony Stark aside for a talk, but had no need to speak, for Tony had already made his mind earlier.
Steve almost smiled, but there was a bland look behind it, visible even under the cowl. Cap was only being polite, he was only helping out, because that was what he did.
Just looking at the other man told him it wasn't a conversation he wanted to have.
Not that he, personally, did.
Tony wasn't quite sure what Steve had thought about it, because that was the thing, wasn't it? When you kept a secret: you knew what it meant, but other people always came up with their own explanation if you hadn't been careful enough to think one up beforehand, and Tony hadn't.
Tony cracked a smile from behind the helmet, and prepared himself to do the same with a joke, which would hopefully be better rendered to his audience.
They ended up in a small pub where no one – not even the staff, which was a bit problematic, but right now Steve didn't care – paid them any attention.
Wait, what?
What had Hill said?
“You could be lying.”
He tilted his head, looked at Steve – for real, this time.
Must be nice. No one would ever do things because Tony – or even Iron Man – told them it was the right thing to do. When they did, it was either because it benefited them, or because they'd thought about it and come to the conclusion that, indeed, it was the right thing to do. Not because he'd said so.
He'd just fallen asleep in his hospital room, and now...
Steve could leave, though. The Guardsmen were all out, and no one else knew he was here – Tony intended to go and wipe the recordings that weren't focused on the prisoners before leaving, which he would be able to do if Steve agreed to just leave it, but would most likely be useless and impossible if he persisted.
Steve smiled at him, completely oblivious to all the truths that made his ambitions impossible.
“No, it's okay. It's just that Mr. Stark was just here, asking me the same question, and he... and I...”
Still. He had to give Steve a chance – or a dozen, really, even though the self-righteous prick would probably never come to see it that way.
Strange's house. Which meant Strange had finally decided to intervene. Good to know he was on their side. Could have decided to step in sooner, really. It would have saved them a lot of effort. Maybe it'd have changed the way of the fight, too.
“But he does what he does because he wants what he wants and screw anyone who gets in his way. He wants everything and everyone to be under his control, exactly as he pictures it. That's why he's doing this, hunting down his technology. That's why he's making you do this. He's not stable. He's a flawed man. He's a drunk looking for a new addiction, and he's found it. Control. And he's never going to stop. He's not capable of it.”
And also meant he personally knew whoever this was.
But...
“It wouldn't happen. And still, there's the problem of way too much red tape, of administration, of, of...! Everything that was wrong with Registration!”
“If you had been his friend, Captain, you'd have considered the fact that maybe he was doing what he did for a reason. You'd have given him the benefit of the doubt. You'd have tried to work with him first, instead of immediately deciding that he was 'selling out', as you said. You'd have cared enough to listen. And more than that, you'd have worried about the bullets you would have known he was taking for you. That, regarless of his smile. Because if you'd been his friend, you would have known that a smile from Tony Stark was no guarantee of his free will.”
It probably had something to do with the fact that – unlike usual, when he could hide it under his clothes or with make-up – the deep bruise on his face had no actual explanation for a businessman who did not endanger his life every now and then – actually, it was more like every tuesday and friday, but eitherway, now and then.
He still pushed the marshal out of the way, because that was the right thing to do, no matter the price to himself, no matter...
Eitherway, Steve needed him to move, so.
“Why exactly did you offer me a spot, Iron Man?”
Tony had made a sound he would never admit to have made as he had been flipped over, and so was very intent on focusing on basically anything else. The fact that Steve looked so damn content with himself, for example. Punk.
He found Charles first.
“Why do you think I wasn't...”
“Of course you can potentially make me talk, Skrull. It doesn't mean you will succeed in doing so. It doesn't mean you would like what I have to say.”
Steve, however, didn't tell him about Zemo, or anything about the day's battle, and just frowned at him. Unsure of how to read that, thinking that perhaps, yes, in the end, no matter whether it was Iron Man or Tony Stark asking, Steve just didn't want to talk about it, he reached for Steve's hand, hoping that the pressure he could thus offer, if not the human contact, would be enough to convey his concern.
“My name is Tony Stark.”
That Tony had gotten Iron Man into a mess he couldn't deal with alone, and now he was asking for the Captain's pity and his help to get Iron Man out of said mess. After all, Tony wasn't good enough to know what he was doing, was he?
“He wants me to like him. I think. I don't know. I don't understand him.”
Selfish.
Not that Tony was very conscious for that part. You know, same old, same old. Extremis tearing itself apart, the pain, the death, the unwanted survival. Steve starting to bash the armor in as soon as it stopped hurting enough for Tony to register what was happening.
At the same time, he had heard about what was going on with Steve, and his – he didn't want to call Steve his friend, because it was obvious that Steve didn't think as much of Tony Stark, but – friend, while entirely able to do the job without his shield, would still be more efficient and better protected with a shield. Steve had things to do, and a shield would make it easier.
He heard the Falcon's voice behind him, muffled through the glass, but still he heard it, the man was probably screaming something – and damn it, if he made it and Steve didn't wake up before him he'd have to track down Sam Wilson and have a chat with him to convince him not to say a word.
Tony contemplated – sure, because contemplating made it sound like he was being so in control, so at peace with the situation, and in truth, he really wasn't – keeping the smile on his face this time too, but it was too late. Unlike the first time, there was no way he was misreading that particular answer. A bitter taste in his mouth, he let the smile fade, and even let some of his hurt show – that, on the other hand, wasn't quite as voluntary. He had decided to be honest about his feelings with Steve, at least as long as he was trying to be his friend, at least so long as there was a chance...
Sighing behind the mask – and he really, really wondered what that sounded like, actually – Tony looked at the city too.
And Tony understood, of course.
Not in those words, of course.
He didn't stop to look back at Steve's face – like he could have done if he had, say, any hope that he was wrong, that Steve would be concerned with Tony Stark.
Not that Tony could actually feel anything as Steve decided to use him as a punching ball – not after the “scrambler” and its effects.
Cap had not stopped staring at Tony, not even after the armor had reappeared right back on him – again, thank you Wanda – to the point that Tony was almost certain the supersoldier had purposefully decided to stay at the end of the queue they were making, just so that he could stare at Iron Man's armored back.
Steve never tried, either, he just judged Tony and decided that as a consequence, anything Tony did was wrong – but that was partly Tony's fault too, wasn't it? Because he wouldn't tell Steve why he should trust him; not that Steve would, though, even if he trusted Iron Man. In the end, all it would do was that Steve would trust Iron Man even less than he did now.
And then Peter would call him Cap again, and Steve would feel obligated to acknowledge Peter's alias again, and then...
After a moment of silence, Steve carefully started walking to the bed – probably to come and sit next to Tony, he had to have heard about what had happened, or at least some of it, and Tony had asked Pepper to call him after he'd crashed her house in search of help, he had to want to talk about it, to make sure Tony was alright.
“The part about how some people throwing a temper tantrum might have given the good citizens of this country the impression that we fought only for ourselves?”
“What everyone heard was that superpowered people could do whatever they wanted, because of course they know where is the line, and when they cross it the others would step in. Except, what happens when no one steps in, Steve?”
He never worked for the money, though it could be considered a comfortable advantage, and it was a necessary tool to constructing anything worthwile.
Not that he'd back down from handling this catastrophe as best as possible, if they refused his conditions, because in the end he was trying to do as much damage control as possible, even if it ended up being at his personal cost – which, let's be honest, was a given. But one day, perhaps, he might not try anymore, and the fact that they couldn't know if and when it would happen was enough of a threat in itself.
“I'm going to step down, obviously, offer an apology, and discreetly look into whatever happened. Weird things are happening lately, the Avengers are investigating too.”
But of course, Steve could only see one side to this story – his own.
“Your question, Steve.”
Fake-Fury dismissed Dugan, and Tony did not take his helmet off – in a SHIELD Helicarrier, with spies everywhere and the certainty that most of them didn't like him?
He'd have to start looking for a suitable replacement for Director of SHIELD if Nick didn't make a brilliant comeback in the next few months. Which meant he also needed to take care of the Kooning problem – get him out, or get him in line, or at least make sure he wouldn't be able to dangle the next director the way he was trying to do it with Tony himself.
It wasn't even a lie. Cap was a good leader, and had proved it many times. But Tony Stark had never been on the field with Steve, he couldn't know that, not the way Iron Man did.
Of course Steve had caught on. Quickly. Steve was far from being an idiot.
How could he have let Gyrich at the helm, how could he...
Still, Steve had reasons to be angry – always taking everything personally, as his attempt to step down from chairmanship from earlier demonstrated.
But never let it be said that Tony hadn't given Steve all the chances he could muster up.
Steve sighed, looking frustrated – not with Iron Man's roundabout statement, but seemingly more with his own inability to get Tony where he wanted with just these words.
But that didn't matter, did it? Steve would have been happy, and not here trying to make sense of a new century, of several decades lost, of friends deceased.
Tony had the phone in hand already, yet he couldn't help but stare at it for a long time before actually calling Steve Rogers.
He understood.
Cable was the first one who noticed, and moments later the two teleporters – Wiccan and Cloak – were put to sleep by his side – nothing dangerous, nothing inhumane or whatever Steve would think of it, but they needed to talk and it wasn't like Captain America would let him say a word if Tony – Iron Man – didn't force his hand.
Which. Obvious enough. It could have been about the Maria Stark Foundation, he supposed, but as it had never stopped founding the Avengers – okay, the New Avengers hadn't gotten money, for obvious reasons, but the Mighty Avengers had, and now that they were all back on the good side of the law it wasn't a concern anymore – there wasn't exactly a reason for him to be here.
See, Steve wasn't actually Iron Man's friend. If he had been, he'd have no problem being Tony's friend, too. Tony couldn't help but wonder about who exactly Cap expected Iron Man to be, about how disappointed he'd be if he was finally shown that it wasn't Iron Man at all, if one day, Tony had to destroy this idea of Iron Man that was in Steve's head because it was the only way to do what was right, even if Cap wouldn't be able to see that.
Of course there was always the issue that mind control came in various flavors, all of which didn't fall under the kind of threats he could protect himself from, but hey, no one ever accused him of not taking on a challenge.
Steve finished his pizza, a sour taste in his mouth, before asking – because he still wasn't clear on what had happened exactly for that to end up this way, for SHRA to need a new head, because...
When he walked into the room, Steve already had a smile the approximate size of Texas on his face, having almost certainly heard him approach.
Honest, perhaps, in his contentment at getting away from Tony Stark, thanks to Tony Stark's own suggestion of a – bogus – excuse.
Tony looked back up, and then he saw the doubt on Steve's face, he saw...
“A point to your presence, or are you just there to tell me I should go to sleep?”
“Tony Stark?”
It wasn't like Tony wouldn't have let him keep his identity secret, had Steve not wanted him to know, had the situation allowed it. It wasn't as if someone knowing something about you entitled you to get the same information about them.
This time it was Kooning, supposedly looking at him with a smile but really stealing glances at the suitcase. It was empty, of course – save for a faceplate that wasn't even metallic, but would do the job nonetheless. Not like he could get there with the armor put away.
And then he saw Tony's – Stark's eyes.
The night was dark, and not far away, Happy was in a coma at the hospital.
What was one life worth next to hundreds or thousands of others?
They were probably the only ones.
Tony may or may not have tried to hide behind Don when the others had arrived, and Steve had definitely made a face – shocked, disbelieving, possibly angry – when he'd eventually caught a glimpse of “Mr. Stark”. The next question had been “What are you doing here?” because he could obviously not process the fact that Iron Man was apparently “that Tony Stark”. Swordman and Vision had shared a look, looking like they'd rather not intrude on whatever had Captain America looking like he'd swallowed a lemon, but unable not to react.
He winced behind the faceplate, all too aware that people generally didn't understand exactly what they were engaging themselves to whenever they said that kind of things to him. What he meant by that. What it might cost them, too, and in the end they blamed him, because it was easier than to admit that they had made a promise without thinking it through.
Instead, he looked back at himself, just to check that yes, indeed, the armor was still there, complete, and that his superpower of denial hadn't invented this particular fact.
Tony didn't answer right away, not certain how to say it.
Peter winced around his third cookie.
“I told you this was going to happen, T'Challa. I told you, and you called me and the others arrogant. Then I told them again, and they called it distasteful. Now? Now it is happening, and maybe it wouldn't have gone that far if you'd been willing to do something about it the first time I told all of you about it. You wouldn't get your hands dirty, but now they are asking for an arm, and if we don't give it to them, they will have our heads.”
Basically, almost all the mutants in the world were depowered.
For that he'd have to admit that maybe there was a reason to all of this, an actual truth behind the fact that heroes could make avoidable mistakes, and that wouldn't do, would it?
“I'd like bygones to be bygones. I know I don't deserve another chance...”
Then again, dreams didn't always make sense. Because this one had been unexpectedly realist didn't mean it hadn't had flaws.
They ducked into an alley, and Peter climbed up a fire escape, soon followed by Steve, in order to get out of sight if someone finaly decided to come and go after them.
Steve had always defined himself by Captain America, for as long as Tony had known him. Even the moments he wasn't Captain America were defined by his not being Captain America, in a way. He had woken up in the future without much else left than his superheroics and the identity the army had crafted for him; for a long time, downtime had been about finding who was Steve Rogers, when Captain America wasn't on the job. Later, he had become Nomad because he didn't want to be a Captain America that represented, even unwillingly, a corrupted leadership.
The door opened at that exact moment, revealing Hank in civilian clothes, but with an unknown device in his hands, a dark look on his face.
Another gulp. It mattered even more, didn't it, that it was a secret from Steve of all people.
Tony was dying – again, by now he knew all too well what that felt like, he could tell.
Raised eyebrows, an actual invitation for an answer.
The difference was that back then, leaving the Captain America alias behind had been a choice Steve had made for himself. This time he had been forced out of that role.
It almost started another panic attack – he'd have to take the helmet off, didn't he, hell, he needed to, he needed to wipe off the snot and the tears and maybe his sins while he was at it, and then Steve wouldn't want to help him, he wouldn't, and even if he did he wouldn't trust him enough to actually listen to him, and that was fine, Tony deserved it, but there was still the matter of finding out if there was someone behind all this, someone who'd still be dangerous even if Tony was taken out of the equation, and...
How many had not made it to the files, how many had died without a name, without a mention, because, because – because they hadn't been the targets, because there was no one to – or, who actually could – identify them after Iron Man had incinerated them, just because they were in the way?
Asked.
Eitherway, Iron Man. What could Steve be meaning with that question, exactly? The quiver in his voice indicated it wasn't just about getting Iron Man's new number. Something was bothering Steve, some...
It made him think of Steve, who scowled at the Tower but still accepted it as a HQ – since, you know, they needed one – while complaining about the fact that it wasn't the Mansion, completely disregarding the possibility that maybe “Mr. Stark” just couldn't take rebuilding it once more, just to see it being reduced to rubbles again and again. That maybe, the Tower wasn't a means to “lord it over people”, but simply a practical option in NYC that wasn't emotionally charged with pain and misery.
He'd have gone and proposed to the government an armor that only worked within the Vault – he'd have even upped the raw power of the thing, if they had asked for it as a compensation – but there was no way they'd accept that, not now that they already had the armors – which, too, had already been used against the West Coast Avengers when Quicksilver had decided he wanted revenge on anyone and everyone who had ever so slightly “wronged” him. If Stane hadn't sold the government the copies of the Guardsman armor...
“Do you... Do you really think he's wrong?”
It wasn't even a lie.
Still alive.
Steve looked up from the table, looked him in the eyes – well, manner of speaking, but.
It was John Walker, of course, who said what they all thought. US Agent, who answered to Washington just as much as to the Avengers, if not more. Firepower wasn't leaving Tony's mind any time soon, as it was.
“Hi, Captain. This is Tony Stark.”
She'd said that last word at Steve, but he was too busy trying to stay awake to answer.
Then his face took on a bitter expression, and Steve obviously forced himself to answer something he absolutely didn't think and that as a consequence sounded just as hypocritical as it in fact was.
“You should ask your friends, Captain.”
“Yeah, well. Here I am.”
Fake-Fury squinted his eye at him, checked a device in his pocket, and looked back at Iron Man.
Second, Franklin seemed to know a little too much on other points, because somehow Tony and Steve's made-up histories had involved them being in a relationship – which had tipped Tony off that something wasn't right with the world, because it just didn't make sense, and perhaps he wouldn't have seen it so soon if there hadn't been that one glaringly obvious problem. And yeah, Tony was definitely in love with Steve, and Steve had a crush on Iron Man, but Tony Stark and Steve Rogers were not – had never been, would never be – in a relationship.
His eyes settled on Clint and Steve, two of the blondest guys in this dive.
He didn't say any of it, of course.
Only one way to end this nightmare.
Peter's eyes – his lenses? How exactly had he made a mask that widened around the eyes exactly? – went wide, and the younger man tried to look away, except that would mean looking at the gathering crowd instead, and while they weren't being hunted down anymore, Steve didn't think his friend would be very comfortable with squirming under the attention so openly yet.
After all, that would mean this wasn't about Steve himself, or Tony Stark and Iron Man's unbelievable loyalty to the man – right back to Steve, who, as a consequence, came in second, and wasn't that inacceptable?
Except that might shut him up for a while, but that would also completely anihilate any chance of Steve ever listening to him, so – not that those chances looked bright right now, but he had to try.
Alone at last – Tony kind of wished he could have kept Clint around, after all he was a friend too, and... but this was between the two of them.
Did Iron Man like Mr. Stark? He didn't, per se, hate him. “Mr. Stark” wasn't what he'd call a bad person... But he didn't quite like him – or, more accurately, he didn't like being him. He valued “Mr. Stark” as you'd value a great tool. And no matter how he could spin that answer, it was obvious that Steve could twist it back into a number of meanings, all of them bad, either for Tony Stark or for Iron Man. Given that Tony Stark was already on the man's shit list, and Iron Man wasn't, Tony knew which one he'd rather tarnish with his answer.
His teeth hurt. Too much grinding them together, probably.
Emma Frost and himself standing outside the institute where Marianne Rodgers had been admitted after she'd lost her mind, and Emma telling him, without judgement, but as a warning that it could happen again if he wasn't careful in his choice of companions and the possiblity that they'd have unmastered psychic powers,
“I was there, Tony. I was at the hospital. I heard that poor woman pleading with you, begging you to...”
“No no no no no, Tony, stay with me, stay with me, don't, wait, I can help you, I can...”
“You know this is wrong, Shellhead.”
His phone – phone-app, he guessed, what with him having Extremis now – rang, and Tony blinked.
“Mr. President. Secretary Kooning. Director Hill.”
Susan sneered at him.
“Eleven days, five hours, and eight days before that, four hours.”
“Cap.”
“Yeah, I... I felt when you... with your mouth...”
It could have been worse. It could always be worse.
“Director down! I repeat, Director Stark is down!”
Mostly, it said that Tony Stark had no business asking about how Steve was.
The marshal Steve asked for the wristband – Tony's ghost too, as it was – gave him a pitying glance alongside the wristband, and Steve had no idea why.
Steve wasn't finished, though, and with each word of how much he didn't actually understand a thing, he made it all the more clear that he had never believed in Tony. Not as Tony Stark – a given, at that point – and not as Iron Man. Or else he wouldn't be assuming that Iron Man could be forced to do anything “wrong” against his will, or at least not that he'd do it unless the lives of innocents were in the balance. Which, you know, was potentially the case.
The casino had been an exercice in frustration, that was certain, but everything felt like that these days. People demanding his trust and respect, and failing to deliver back, even as they claimed to.
Nick wasn't going to let it go, was he?
“I mean, I'm planning to denounce the act publicly, of course. If you stand up with me we might change a few senators' minds, but I think it's best to assume at this point that the SHRA is a done deal, and we need to start running the resistance.”
Tony thought about turning around to face his lover and show him that no, that wasn't what he was going on about, but by the end of this conversation Steve would have a decision to make and he couldn't influence him like that.
There was a lie – more than a simple omission – somewhere in there, and Steve couldn't quite find which part was it. China implied the Mandarin – it generally did, when Tony was mixed up in it too – but the supervillain was being handled by the chinese superteam right now, and Steve would have heard if Tony was with them. Moreover, even if he'd been badly hurt, it wouldn't have prevented him from coming to see Steve after his return.
Nothing.
Of course the identity he'd set up to feed to SHIELD back during his armor wars was to be brought up again. Not that “Randall Pierce” wasn't dead and buried after he'd faked “Iron Man”'s death, but yeah, he got the point.
Not yet.
She squinted at him, head tilted, and seemed to find something – facial expression? Stature, perhaps? – to justify a positive answer.
A shield, though, even an adamantium one... Sure, he couldn't stop Steve from doing whatever he wanted with it – not even using it against Iron Man himself, if it came to that – but he trusted Steve's intents, and it wasn't like there was any tech worth stealing in it, even if it was wrestled out of the Captain's hands.
Tony was also going after his stolen designs, which was also probably going to come back and bite him in the ass, because it was the right thing to do.
Let's try again.
Just as Steve's back-up blundered in – yet another proof that either Steve had lied, or he didn't have quite the grip he thought he had on his troops – Tony caught a look on his face. Understood that, of all things, Steve didn't see why Happy mattered, why they should feel concerned over his fate, not when “Iron Man” wasn't on his side to begin with, not when he'd been “betrayed” by his “best friend”.
Then again, it was entirely possible that some of the supers on their side with technological skills beyond what Steve could comprehend – Tony had been one of them, once, but Tony wasn't on their side, and Tony was dead – had all tried to go after the SHRA database the moment they got the opportunity, just to take it down. Except it hadn't been taken down, it had... Its access had been restricted to lawful inquiries – what did that entail, actually? A warrant from a judge? An order by the President? A decision by the Director of SHIELD? What did a lawful inquiry of the SHRA database mean, Tony?
Perhaps Captain America would want to be his friend – if he didn't, who would?
So back to square one.
Steve gnashed his teeth – that sounded either terribly naive, coming from a Tony-Stark-lookalike, or extremely logical, if not for the fact that Steve wasn't that naive as to think any of the people who'd engineered Registration could actually respect anything about Steve himself.
When Tony spoke, it spilled over his chin and the lower part of his helmet.
The door slammed open, Tony saw someone who looked a bit like Agent Vera Lockhart pull a gun on Hank and shoot, except she was green and – oh, skrull – tears were flooding his eyes, except they were pink – crimson? – and he couldn't see right. One of his knees collapsed under him – left – and next thing he – didn't, because he was almost out at that point – knew his hand banged against the floor.
No one knew who was behind the mask, who risked their life every now and then to save the world or stop the costumed assholes endangering their life, but weirdly enough, the only ones who were bothered by that little fact were the authorities who occasionally demanded for Tony Stark to give up Iron Man's identity – probably because it would be easier, then, to keep them in check should the need arise.
What assured them all that the inquiries would be justified, Tony?
Tony, at first, let his inner fanboy be completely awed by this sudden and unexpected event. Captain America was alive, and that was incredible. His childhood hero – the one imaginary friend he had had whenever he felt more alone than any child should feel in the mansion – was alive, and right next to him, and...
And if Steve couldn't see that...
The fact that this was true for people who weren't his enemies at all, who were supposed to be his friends, even, or at least his allies, was not a comfortable fact.
Steve wasn't sure that was going to last.
“Yeah, that's it, Avengers reports.”
Also, Tony was – vaguely, sure, there were things going on as always, especially after Temugin and the manhunt for Tony that had ended up reflecting on her, and how she hadn't liked him asking about Happy first thing in his call, but him loving her didn't mean he'd stopped caring about everything else in his life and at the time Happy's life had been in the balance, just... just like, him loving Steve didn't mean Iron Man would shrug off his responsibilities each and every time Steve didn't like it – taken right now, and the fact that Steve's crush was totally mutual did not erase his feelings for Rumiko. No matter that both relationships seemed to be doomed right now – but, maybe, maybe Rumiko just needed a little time, and...
“Not right now. I can't... I have a meeting in ten... I mean, Mr. Stark has a meeting in D.C. I have to be there with him. But after, okay? I can go supersonic or suborbital; I'll be back in New York fast. Two hours. I'll meet you. Where?”
He had to stop himself from standing up from his chair and take a step back as Steve leaned in to mock-whisper all his lack of trust and belief in Tony Stark in Tony's own ear.
“He can be a kind man, a generous man.”
Steve blinked – how had Stark known? – his eyes stuck on the man's face.
He put a hand on Peter's shoulder, trying to be comforting – or something; Steve wasn't feeling particularly comforted himself, but he could try for Peter.
He didn't wait for an answer, and maybe Steve would think him arrogant or whatever, but at least that way he didn't get to tell him he minded, or worse, to lie through his teeth and say he didn't, out of politeness – because then lying wasn't a problem, was it?
No point for him to expose the hundreds of reasons why he might not trust her. She'd thought of those too.
He wasn't sure if the fact that he warranted a joke was good, or if it just meant that this was what their friendship was now reduced to – what it had always been, a traitorous thought whispered.
As he wasn't answering, she continued on.
Steve's voice sounded weird to his own ears, as he considered the possibility that...
Where the hell had Tony disappeared to, anyway?
Steve's answer was tentative, then, and infuriatingly understanding when it really wasn't about that.
Captain Freaking America.
And it wasn't what Steve needed – let's be honest, Tony couldn't give Steve what the man needed, because what he needed didn't exist, not as such as Steve needed it, but he could give him the next best thing and hope it would be enough.
He'd have liked to say it didn't hurt. Then again, there were many things he would have liked to say didn't hurt, but life just didn't work that way.
“Come one, I have to play shooting target on the way to my trial. It would be a damn shame if I didn't reach the stand, after all.”
“And you didn't tell us about it?”
Then Captain America's voice rose up again, and sounded vaguely flat, as if he was trying to control his tone, not to let anything be heard of what he felt about that.
If Tony Stark failed once, it wasn't a fluke; it was a proof of his inadequacy.
Which left Steve with Fury – and Stark.
Tony looked one last time at Steve before leaving.
Yes, that was what he'd do. He'd make the most of both situations to end SHRA in both timelines, with things he wasn't supposed to know but still would, thanks to the diverging timelines.
Disgusting.
Cap was going to wrangle it out of him, if Tony let him, wasn't he? And Tony just couldn't have that. He needed to think, and be very careful with the way he was going to stir the conversation now. He stopped looking at his friend and started staring somewhere indefinite inside the helmet, because it was easier to think without the blue eyes of justice and honesty peering into his soul.
That was the thing with Tony: you never knew if he was being sarcastic or serious, mostly because both were somehow true at the same time.
If Tony had needed one more reason not to divulge his secret identity, well – not that it mattered much, now.
Tony did not point out that Fury's report were clear enough on the fact that, well – Bucky Barnes had been an assassin long before whoever-it-was-this-time had gotten their hands on him. Steve didn't need that reminder, and there was the matter that killing during a war and for the good guys – presumedly – was not the same thing as being a hitman. Not that Steve usually made much of a difference between the two, but then again, Barnes had always been special.
Steve looked at him, reached for his shield, and put it on the table between them.
He offered her a self-deprecating smile, a shrug, and one last comment before leaving.
“Why do you care, Steve?”
“Would you say Mr. Stark knows you pretty well?”
There she gave him a look – the I-know-agents-and-I-know-superheroes-and-I-know-you-won't-but-you-still-should look – so Steve nodded again, dutifully.
What was that question? He couldn't even begin to untangle how he'd be able to gather any kind of hint on how to behave as Tony Stark around Cap from wherever this conversation would be going.
Steve had the shield in hand, expecting – what? An enemy? Maybe that wasn't so bad an assessment. Tony wondered if Cap knew already, if... He imagined that shield falling down, a cutting edge – speed, people – against the armor's neck.
Steve obviously had no idea – again, Tony's fault here – what it was that he was promising here. An usual problem with secret identities, as it was.
Steve looked like he wanted to tell him all that, but he couldn't, because – because he thought it was true, except, not really, did he, not as far as...
Except that, even if Steve hesitated, it wasn't like Iron Man could explain anything, could he?
He looked back at Misty, and finally asked one of the questions he couldn't get himself rid of.
One of the very first – in chronological order – reasons why he had recently been frozen to 40 K, had had his nervous system – which had already not been the original one – been rewritten into a new function, and had spent some weeks reliving all his memories.
Unsurprisingly, Steve's expression suddenly turned sour. Eyes squinted, just a little, barely enough to be noticeable, but still, Tony was right there, in front of him, and Tony spent half his life reading people's reactions, of course he could tell. The curb of his mouth moved just enough to let disdain show – Tony was well acquainted with that facial expession, the one that said you had done something wrong and there was no respecting you for that, he used to see it often enough on his father's face.
In other words, it was terribly sad that no one noticed, but at the same time, it was good that no one did, because if they did they'd become suspicious and that wasn't something he could afford – not right now, while he was vulnerable, when he had no idea how to counter, and in a more general manner not never either.
“It doesn't matter who's in the Iron Man armor. What is important is that I control him.”
Steve might be onto something, there, a way to numb everything better than alcohol had ever managed. A complete, definitive desensitization.
Peter – Spider-Man looked around – definitely not at Steve – visibly ill-at-ease with the proposition.
Tony dragged himself across the room, towards Steve – he could see Falcon being chained up, but, more importantly, safe from the red gas for now. Steve, however, wasn't.
And what?
“Alright, I just... Well. Thanks for having looked out for Warbird. She might not feel like it right now, but you've done her a favor. She can't get better if she doesn't admit she has a problem, and obviously she isn't admitting anything right now, so someone had to point it out for her.”
The problem, apparently, was that Steve didn't believe Tony Stark when he told him Iron Man was acting of his own volition even when that volition was the same as Tony Stark's, and he didn't believe it either when Iron Man himself told Steve the very same thing. And that, obviously, wasn't something Tony could fix. Steve would believe what he wanted to believe.
Tony gritted his teeth, and refrained from taking a step back. Talking about his alcoholism with Steve was not on today's agenda.
Misty snorted.
“Maria asked me for the names of people she thinks are likely to resist, and unfortunately I gave up Daredevil and Luke, so our priority should be to get Luke to safety first, especially because of his family. Jess and Dani need to be somewhere secure. The rest of the team can move out later. We've got two weeks. We can find them safehouses SHIELD doesn't know about."
Maybe not as an actual hero, but... just as someone decent.
It wasn't like things weren't problematic with Rumiko. She'd probably get over him soon enough. She deserved better than him, anyway. She deserved someone who didn't have so many commitments they could barely spend any time with her, someone who didn't put her in danger just by knowing her. Someone who weren't endangering themselves every saturday and didn't make her wonder if she was going to see them again each time they parted ways.
Not exactly.
They'd talk about his weigth on Steve's furniture another time. They had – Tony had to talk.
“I... It's not that... Look, things happened, and I... I just didn't feel comfortable on the team anymore.”
The asshole, at least, hadn't had to rely on an armor chestplate to stay alive – he wasn't sure the asshole had been happy, for all that, mostly because he couldn't remember how the asshole had felt, how he'd thought, and why he had done what he had done.
Not that they were talking about Steve here.
"It's all the same thing with him. Don't you get it?"
So, the goddamn newspapers.
He was going to let his friend delude himself, and because there were never enough experienced superhero teams out there, he was going to do everything that needed to be done for it to work behind Steve's back, instead of listening to him explain why miracles existed and how they were going to deal with the real world, because that was what Tony Stark did; he made things work.
He paused a moment, then reached for the console, already planning how to get rid of the records for this particular conversation in case Kang came and had a look at his control system.
He knew what she was saying, of course.
“You know what I didn't have, on Hala? You at my back.”
Just another proof that Iron Man was a broken mask, now, though.
“I... you... you... You saved me?”
Tony hadn't ordered the hit, Tony hadn't killed Steve, but if what Misty was saying was true...
Okay, no, definitely not friendly. Something was rotten in the state of SHIELD, and Tony was most likely going to end up dead or dissected – not that he was a particularly interesting human specimen, but who knew, maybe they'd changed their mind since last time.
They were shaking hands, then, and it was the end of it. It had always been the end of it, when it came to Tony Stark and Steve Rogers.
“Tell them the truth. Something happened, and I've been tested clean, but obviously I'm compromised so I'm stepping down. No one is going to believe it, but here at least they won't be able to find proof of an actual cover-up, because it isn't one. Anyway, that's what I do, don't I? I step in when someone has to, I hold the fort so that things can get better, so that they don't fall into pieces right away, until something goes inevitably wrong and I take the blame. It's not like it's new.”
Steve, of course, wasn't done.
Jen arched an eyebrow, and supplied:
He cleared his throat.
Because he needed to be useful.
“You say the resistance is me, but... Registration, you know that's you, too.”
For now, though, Steve was licking his lips – perhaps the ghost of a smile, but so tentative and forced that it was unrecognizable.
“And as we both know, you are not a mutant who makes himself into what he says he is, not in this reality.”
What had he done to be deemed unworthy of even bringing Captain America news about his friend Iron Man's well-being?
He could have gotten away with it had it been a minor cut or a small ecchymosis, something that could happen to anyone if they, let's say, walked into a door or something, but it wasn't the case here.
They sat. He couldn't help but notice that Steve seemed tired.
“You think?”
Jan grimaced, then sighed.
A squint, and a scowl.
After all, if he died, he wouldn't care either way.
Well.
Carol blinked at him, put down her piece of pizza. Frowned.
It got worse. Because it went too far, and still got farther and farther into insanity, the Thunderbolts were turned into a task force unlike never before, and Tony, still not Director of SHIELD, couldn't do a thing to stop Hill – still Director of SHIELD – from using them whenever she thought it necessary. 42, the Negative Zone prison, was objected to by Peter and Cap's forces in general.
His smile simply fell a bit short instead.
He had a responsibility to all the people he employed, and in this case, it came first. Especially as he couldn't bankroll the Avengers if the company went down and stopped alimenting the Maria Stark Foundation – he still was the main source of cash and influence for the Foundation, and this time there really was a lot to repair – because he hadn't been able to focus on it – then he'd have failed both the people working for him and the Avengers. Sometimes you had to make a choice, to save only one thing, rather than none at all because you tried to do too much.
“I care about you, Shellhead.”
Slow, start with baby steps, Stark.
The look Steve gave him was full of resentment, and Tony wondered if the man even knew it.
He especially didn't like the fact that Stark's death had basically validated everything SHRA denounced – it had cost a man's life, therefore it was a concern.
Jen winced as she reached for pizza, and Tony – Iron Man handed it over.
It was painfully obvious that Steve would never have agreed to what Hill was proposing – first of all because she didn't have the authority to do it, not yet, and even then he'd say no out of principle – but the situation would have been salvageable if she'd just said something about what a shame it was, and left him leave peacefully. But no, she'd had to go and try to get him arrested too – to get him killed, maybe, if he resisted too much – and now Steve had jumped off the Helicarrier and gone underground, which was a stupid, stupid move, and entirely understandable.
“From what I've understood, the timeline from which you plucked me out was aborted by the timestream as it was essentially this past with only one intervention from the future, a future that couldn't be if the past had actually changed. All that, Jan, means that I may be your Tony Stark, as in exactly the same Tony as the one you knew ten years ago, but I'm still missing those ten years. I've basically been catapulted ten years into my own future, so no, I don't know anything about what older-me did or didn't find out about Kang's plans. He... I mean, I managed to give myself some intel on this future-present we're in, but then it was too late and all I have is an incomplete guide into being Tony Stark, Nowadays Edition.”
He sighed, and the chestplate dug into his stomach painfully. The Prometheus armor had not been designed for continued use, he'd have to look into that and make it more user-friendly.
The choice was easily made.
A pause, then, and the sound of a glass being put down.
“You've been shot on your way to your trial, if you recall. The bullet went right through Anthony Stark's skull before going through your collarbone. We had no issue treating the wound itself, but the little blood and brain matter the bullet took with it and into your body was another story, which ended up in a infection that took us some more time to deal with. Everything seems to be back in order, though. I'd still like you to be careful and inform us if anything, and I mean, anything, seems out of place. Between the serum and Extremis, we'd rather not have any surprise.”
“Does it matter?”
“I want you to consider something, Steve. I'm black, and I'm a woman. Two facts that statistics will tell you make it very hard for me to, not only live, but be someone in this country. And yet, I used to be a police officer, until my injury got me out of the field. I didn't leave because I'd lost faith in the system, you see, I left because I couldn't do what I was best at anymore. And yes, I'm aware that regardless of individual merits, the police is generally not as fair to women or African-Americans as it is to white men. Still, I was a police officer, and I believe in what I did back then. Why? Because, the system might not have been perfect, but I could make sure that my part in it was right, and because we need a system. Or would you argue that, because black people are more or less discriminated against, we should not jail the ones who are guilty of crimes as some kind of twisted balance?”
He imagined being the man who broke Captain America.
But Steve himself didn't seem to fully know what he was trying to say, so Tony cocked his head, as if to encourage him to talk, just in case.
Because of course she wasn't.
Though, skrulls.
Instead he just laughed, again – not bitter this time, just sad.
Afterwards, when Steve and Tigra were busy talking with someone or another about what had happened, and the Silver Surfer had left, Don Blake grabbed Iron Man's arm.
The supersoldier locked eyes with him.
This was going to be fun – not.
Steve frowned.
And here came the part they both knew not to be true – though, as always, Tony really, really wanted Steve to prove him wrong.
The man looked away, and yeah, he was starting to get it.
“How do you feel about time-travel, Tony?”
Anthony watched the monitors as Kang had told him to, his attention unfortunately drawn to the moments of his life he liked the least, from the worst betrayals to the small reaffirmations that no one actually cared that much, not enough to stand by him, not enough to give him a chance, not enough to even try and understand. The times he hadn't been enough, too, and in general all the times he'd suffered.
He'd learned long back that when people asked him what he thought, they didn't actually want the truth, they wanted to hear what was the most convenient for them and what they cared about. Sometimes the truth was it.
In another version of this story, Tony mused, a version in which Steve actually liked him, he'd probably be convincing himself that he was giving this new shield to his friend so that Steve'd think about it twice before getting in his way. Not actually change his mind about all this, just, a moment of hesitation. Enough for Tony do what needed to be done – or, perhaps, but that sounded far-fetched, even in a version of the story in which Steve was his friend, enough for Tony to get the chance to explain, for Steve to propose an alternative that Tony hadn't thought about, because as often as he was right, he was also open to suggestions about how to do something better.
So he pushed the door.
Tony hadn't killed Steve, and if Misty was right, Steve had all but killed Tony.
Iron Man, on the other hand, had very often been subjected to criticism, if only for being Tony Stark's employee. And even there, Tony could protect himself, he could publicly defend himself – or, if the need came to be, he could “change” Iron Man's pilot.
Impossible.
Not only did Steve not even consider him – Tony Stark – worth anything, but he didn't even seem to think that other people could have another point of view than his own on him. After all, Steve Rogers was always right, wasn't he?
He woke up again in the version of the story where Tony was dead – for him – and yet there was a ghost of Tony Stark haunting him.
It was alright. Same old, same old.
Not for long, and only because they hadn't expected it, because Tony wasn't exactly in the best state right now, what with the imminent heart attack and everything, but screw it if that had ever stopped him before.
“We don't need a salary, or tech, or connections! No more politics, just us. No UN. No governments. All that, we never needed it.”
He wondered how many of the Avengers actually believed he had been violent towards her.
Tony had known for some time that Captain America wasn't perfect.
“You're asking yourself these questions, Tony, and I think that says a lot about who you can be, about your values and your intent to be better.”
He took a steadying breath, and went back to it. Steve wanted an explanation, didn't he? Well, he'd get it – not that he'd believe anything of it, not that he would believe anything that didn't basically say “gosh, you're right, Steve, I have absolutely no self-esteem and even less of a capacity to make choices for myself and while we're at it did you know that Mr. Stark as a very nice ass?”.
Of course, he could have walked very violently into a door.
Tony wasn't here either, though.
When he'd called Nick and told him to put him in a cell at Fort Leavenworth, he hadn't thought it necessary because he was a threat, but because he needed to clear his name in order to be able to go back and stop whoever was actually doing the killing. Fort Leavenworth, because it was analog, and he wasn't going to give his detractors a reason to doubt that yes, he'd been jailed all along.
Not that he would.
He was grateful to her, of course. He was terribly grateful that she hadn't left too.
Tony froze, as he eventually came to a conclusion he really didn't like, pushed to it by his friend's words.
Steve visibly gulped, and pushed the box of tissues harder into Tony – Iron Man's hands.
“Your name?”
That was the only time Tony could remember Steve ever apologizing to him, as it was.
“With all due respect, Mr. Stark, it really is an Avenger matter. I'd prefer not to discuss it with you.”
Ah, right. That would give them – whoever they would be – access to a successful Extremis subject. Not good. Add in some self-destruct capability, then. His remodelled DNA crumbling on itself right after death. Nothing valuable left.
Steve, blinking, didn't disappoint;
“Great. I'll go assemble the team.”
Someone, he supposed, was making sure that it wasn't being abused, something that Stark himself had promised them all, something that Stark hadn't seen to.
Steve wondered if, maybe, this was also to keep an eye on them, because...
He couldn't give Steve everything he wanted to know, but... He could at least say that.
And that, once again, did not make the tiniest lick of sense.
But he couldn't go back in here, now, could he?
Skrull-him caught his – admittedly weak – attempt at a punch with his – own – left hand and put the right one over Tony's mouth to prevent him from speaking.
The ghost sounded almost condescending as he answered that particular statement.
Still, he didn't see how to tell Steve that without getting punched, and anyway he'd promised – he should have known better, really, because obviously Steve would manage to ask the one question no one wanted answered, not even Steve himself, no matter what he thought.
And sure, the man probably needed time to process, but still.
Peter was the first one back, and, of course, the first thing he saw after “Oh, Cap, you're awake!” were the newspapers on the table, the pictures of Tony Stark's reports of death, and the one of Bucky at the scene, gun still in hand, caught on CCTV.
Apologizing, he could still do, but...
Hilarious.
He was lying to Captain America. Nothing new.
Not that Tony would actually argue, because Tony was dead.
This wasn't the moment to make it about himself, Tony knew – it was never the moment, really, but sometimes you just needed to ask, you needed to make it about yourself if you didn't want to break into pieces, and Tony really, really tried not to, but he couldn't always, and... This time he needed it.
Steve noticed the movement right away, as he'd been waiting for it.
Steve found it a bit weird that Jarvis would leave just because the Avengers hadn't been able to tell it wasn't him – it didn't sound like the old butler at all.
Anyway.
“I'm breaking you out, Tony, so shut up, please, if you don't want the others to come here and find us. Just... Stay silent, for now, I promise I'm going to explain later.”
He decided to work past it. If nothing else could convince her, he'd have to rely on his actions. He'd have to prove himself, like he always did.
He observed his “friend”'s reaction, trembling a bit in anger inside the armor, ready to defend himself, again, from any kind of verbal lashing that was about to come, there was no other possibility, not with the way the Captain looked like he was going to go for the throat, when...
Well on the way to being in love, though. And just that was enough to send him down the bottle one more time, with her words simply confirming what he already knew: he wasn't worth anything – not anymore, maybe never before.
It would be perfect, just the right thing to say... If it was true. But Steve had already done his part, by helping Tony Stark, and it was obvious that no, he didn't have Iron Man's back, not inasmuch as Iron Man wasn't only Iron Man, but also the man standing here, and that Steve clearly disliked that man.
Peter turned to look at him – at Iron Man – with furrowed eyebrows.
“That... The chestplate is the only thing keeping you alive?!”
“It's really him. They brainwashed him. Wiped his mind. Made him into an assassin.”
“You like Mr. Stark a lot, don't you?”
“Tony is...”
Tony imagined taking the helmet off, right here – that was becoming a recurring potential scenario, he had to be careful not to actually end up doing it – and asking Steve how exactly he intended to do that, how he intended to help him with his problem.
Just enough to get it once he wouldn't be on drugs anymore and his mind worked full time again.
Supposing that, next time – was there really a point denying that there was going to be a next time, after everything? – he'd go back to himself to be able to do something about it.
Tony didn't believe in God anyway.
He thought about confiding that maybe, he had gone a bit overboard at the end, with the mandroids and the guardsmen.
There was a bit of a scuffle with an alien who turned everyone but Captain America to stone, but mostly everything went right after that. Steve seemed to like Iron Man, and that was better than anything else so far.
Tony Stark, useless at last.
Cap and the others had managed to evade the quicksand bog created by Dormammu before the demon got himself sucked into the Evil Eye, thanks Wanda, by the way, so when they'd made their way to Thor – Don Blake – and Iron Man – yeah, yeah, Tony Stark, old news and all that, could you not stare please, and why are you looking at me like that, Steve? – they'd found them not yet back into their other identity. In other words, Tony's armor was still who knew where, and Thor wasn't back to being Thor because his hammer had disappeared too.
He'd been doing paperwork – again, always, more and more – when Janet had busted his office's door open, her anger barely contained and plainly visible on her face, about to ask for answers.
That was the thing, with the Avengers. Usually when you got an alert you dropped what you were doing, whatever you were doing, to respond, but sometimes you couldn't for the simple reason that you were already busy fighting the good fight, or you hadn't slept in three days and weren't in a state to contribute, or...
Eventually he decided to enter the place as he was – not in the armor, not as Iron Man – because this might be the last time he ever saw Steve and even if Steve hated him he didn't want to die without one last face-to-face.
Steve was starting to understand that the best way to make the ghost stop talking – at least on a particular subject, if not entirely – was to simply not answer.
He had no idea what they'd looked like, all the people who'd died in Iraq only a few hours ago, by his hand – by his armor, his personal weapon, his creation, everything that was supposed to make him able to protect people. When he'd gotten control back, most of them had just been charred remains – sometimes still fuming, and was the armor smelling of burned flesh, like after the Carnelian ambassador?
Tony took the helmet off, and looked her in the eyes.
Tony thought about asking if Steve had even considered the possibility that perhaps “Tony Stark” had given him the adamantium shield even while knowing that he'd get in his way. He thought about looking Steve dead in the eye, and asking him if he truly believed Mr. Stark to be idiotic enough to think Captain America could be bought. He thought about asking Steve to follow that train of thoughts right here, before him and out loud, just to see where exactly that brought him.
“I know that.”
Checking on his internal clock – literal in this case – made it obvious that yes, Tony, you haven't slept in four days now.
But Steve wouldn't do it, would he?
He watched as Steve took a deep breath – schooling his features into an encouraging expression, something that wouldn't let his confusion show and would make it all about Tony, just Tony, even if it really wasn't.
Peter intervened, Steve made a spiteful answer about “principles” in a way that made it entirely obvious to anyone who actually listened that it wasn't, in fact, principles he was talking about, because while safety was a concern and anonimity a luxury in a world of heroes and villains, neither were freaking principles.
“Cut the bullshit, we both know you do every goddamn thing that Tony Stark tells you to!”
The fact that Tony knew the exact difference between brainwashing and mind-control – a brainwashed person didn't have to be under constant orders, because they'd been led to believe with all their soul, heart and mind that they were in the right, whereas mind-control failed the moment you let it down – and both from personal experience should have been terrifying.
“I'm sorry, I'm going to try and not pry too much. So, back to what I was saying. There are skrulls in about every group of power here, Hydra, SHIELD, some superheroes, political leaders, I don't know who they all are, but we're everywhere. For now, they're just sleeper agents, most of them, but when the plan will come into motion, we're all going to have to report. I'll borrow your face when I have to, but I promise I'm just going to pass myself off as a random human woman in the meanwhile.”
“You're talking about thousands of people giving away their secret identity, the fact that they have abilities. It's enormous. It's a lot of trust you're asking for, regardless of whether or not you have the right to ask for it. The access to the database has to be heavily restricted. I can build you a system that'll recognize a superhero without giving away their name to the officer checking on them, but you have to make sure that the person at the head doesn't have unrestricted access either. And if you still want me to head it, then there will be no records of Iron Man's identity. The head of SHRA answer to you and only you, in order to be able to defend the ones in their care.”
If he winked, knowing that the eyeslits were large enough to show it – and he really needed to work on that, or else one of these days someone would recognize him just because of that, he was really surprised no one close to him ever saw it, then again it probably had to do with the fact that those who'd look Tony Stark in the eyes tended not to linger on Iron Man's, and
Cap certainly meant it, when he said he had his back, but that alone didn't make it true. Steve had that image of Iron Man, perfect and unblemished, without any of the depth or of the hurt a real person had, and listening to him, it was like Steve was in love with the idea of Iron Man, with the abstraction of it, while demonstrating that he would never actually be able to even appreciate the man behind the mask.
“Not really. Not all superpowers are useful to an officer of the law. Not every superhuman want to be a superhero. Some are not under our jurisdiction, on top of that. If they are willing to strike a deal, if I can give good enough a reason not to start an open war on all sides, it is in your interest to let them be, or at least to consider them reserves rather than soldiers. Take Thor, for example, or any of the other deities out there. If they come to the USA and we try to apply SHRA to them, we will be torn to shreds. However, they can generally stand as visiting foreigners, even diplomats, and thus be exempted.”
Instead he let his smile falter and his hand tremble for a second, then visibly withdrew on himself.
Tony froze. He could tell him right now, about the things they were considering – not for SHRA, but for what might come after, if they didn't get what they wanted – to force Steve to realize how different it really was, how important this was going to be, how grave it might become.
He couldn't help but wonder if Tony was there because he was worried about what might happen after what Steve had said earlier... or if Stark was there because he'd commissioned the sniping and wanted to be here to make sure things went smoothly, considering Captain America seemed to know something.
“Yeah, that's what I remember too. But think about it, Steve. It doesn't make the slightest lick of sense. You don't do one night stands, and I don't do men. Still, here we are.”
Misty took a step back and grinned at him. She looked tired.
Time to face the music.
Two seconds later, he was doing his best not to throw up on the rapidly diminishing crowd as – what was happening, what... oh. Falcon had gotten him and was trying to carry him out of there, Sam was here, despite the marshals shouting at him to get them down or they'd shoo...
“What... What's going on? Killed who?”
For now.
He could let Steve lie to him, as the man pretended to agree, as they shook hands, because it would never get the time to actually become a lie in acts.
“I just told you I walked into a door, Janet.”
Not good. Steve tended not to want to consider the less shiny sides of living in the real world – instead of an idealistic one – when he didn't have the energy to bear with it.
Since theatrics were a luxury that often did the job, Tony brought the mask right next to his face, hiding the left half of it under “Iron Man”, before stating what he had come to say.
Tony wasn't asking for much, or at least he didn't think so. All he wanted was to spend some time with Steve.
Maybe. After all, while entirely aware that things did tend to go wrong every now and then, Steve still managed to somehow believe everything would go alright and to have faith in people.
Which, considering, she probably knew.
The ends justified the means, right?
For the first time since he'd woken up in a hospital room with a ghost of Tony Stark that no one else could see, Steve realized what exactly those words entailed – thinking back on it, there had been other times, too, but he hadn't seen it.
“He gave up your name to SHIELD. Your secret identity.”
He called Steve, again.
Which, okay. Not what he had expected.
Because it would mean it was Tony's own fault, but what would it matter, anyway, if Tony was dead nonetheless, if...
“We're a close-knit community, Captain. What happens when someone fucks up and no one wants to admit it?”
He didn't want to know how he sounded, his voice distorted by the armor, but he guessed it didn't quite matter, because as usual Steve would interpret it however he wanted.
“Stark.”
He watched them with caution – she looked like Jan, except, older, and he knew Jan didn't have an older sister, and he was tall and black and looked at Tony as if he couldn't really believe he was seeing him here, like that, or whatever.
They were hidden behind the trees, now, and skrull-Tony had his armor by his side. As for Tony, he was observing the – seemingly – SHIELD agents who were doing whatever they were doing in here – and now that he thought about it, this all sounded a lot like the Deltite plot, and God he wasn't ready for another mess of that kind, especially not with skrulls instead of rogue LMDs. Where there even any real SHIELD agents here, or had they all been replaced? Maybe they didn't know their orders weren't legitimate?
Theoretically he could probably knock him out, but...
“I... I believe the ends justify the means, and I know you don't... I mean, I guess, you never have.”
Turned out, Tony didn't die, arrived on the scene first, and didn't have to explain why Tony Stark had died right after Iron Man took a beating to anyone – though, obviously if that had happened he'd have been in no position to explain anything to anyone, except maybe to other dead people, but he didn't really believe in an afterlife, so.
“What happened, Nick?”
But, he guessed, at least now he had a perfectly functional body again – none of the ailments his three selves had had had remained with his return from Counter-Earth, weirdly enough. No hightech neural system, no damage to his liver, no failing heart, not even scars. Not that he expected it to last long, knowing himself and his tendency to almost die and end up with a crippling injury.
The Illuminati – they hadn't called themselves that yet, only he did it, but that was essentially what they were – had decided to go and bring a little warning to the Skrulls – the Kree, at least, weren't hell-bent on stealing their planet, even if they didn't generally care much for Earth and its inhabitants. Of course, that had gone pear-shaped, but Tony wasn't particularly surprised here – everything always tended to get worse before getting better, and they had gone in without proper intel, so, there was that. And sure, you could call them arrogant for making that decision, but at the same time, was pretending nothing was wrong and the Skrulls weren't going to come back like goddamn ostrichs all that better?
“Any of my friends could tell you I don't invite them home unless I am in a sexual or professional relationship with them, and even then I tend not to unless I have no other option. Sure, it could mean I don't actually have friends, and that I am an untrusting, egomaniac bastard. Or maybe, you could wonder about the fact that Avengers Mansion was, after all, my home, much more than any house I actually live in, and that every last one of you Avengers were invited in. Maybe you could take into account, not only what you perceive you did and I didn't, but also what I did and everyone fails to notice.”
“Dead. Again. What, did you think Extremis would save him from a headshot? It didn't. Now we're trying to make sure his death wasn't for nothing, so I'd appreciate if you didn't get yourself killed anytime soon.”
“Well. You've made your choice, then.”
Another detonation down there shook Steve through the bones, and when he looked down too, despite the hole in his collarbone and the frankly awkward fact that Sam was going to have to put them down soon because Steve was just too heavy, he saw that everyone – the SHIELD agents, the marshals – were looking somewhere else, at Stark, who was...
But Susan wasn't Pepper, and she had no right to say this.
Eh. Steve would probably think this was all about him, about how he'd betrayed him, about how he'd needed him and Iron Man wasn't there, was on the opposing side. And as always, he'd fail to see that this was a two-ways road. Because Tony needed Steve's help here, he needed him to make sure this wouldn't go overboard, he needed him to steady their weight on the balance of power, because people couldn't ignore Captain America.
“Hank, why are you her...”
He also didn't seem to understand that they did need the rules, because it wasn't just the Avengers this time, it was everyone, and everyone included the guys who had a tendency to leave bodies in their trail, the ones who wanted to do good but really had a problem up there, the ones who didn't care about doing good but worked for the higher powers because it was easier than being a supervillain – or, you know, a minion. People Steve frowned at generally, but got away with tolerating because they weren't part of the team, because they weren't their responsibility.
He was in a rather rundown place, if clean enough, and the windows were borded up. There was Steve's uniform folded on an old chair by the door, as well as other clothes on the back of that chair, and a roll of bandages on the nightstand. He could hear voices from behind the wall, but right now he couldn't focus enough on what they said, let alone recognize then, supposing he even knew the people who were talking, which wasn't a given.
“So trust us. Trust the Avengers. You're one of us. Be one of us. You can do the actual right thing. This is what you have to do. Don't let him make you take the fall for this.”
Which was, wow, so freaking untrue Tony didn't even have an answer to that. How many times exactly had he responded with such an accusation, even when he thought Steve was in the wrong, and Steve hadn't been the one to initiate it? How many veiled insults, in Steve's words, towards Tony Stark – and the fact that Steve didn't know he was Tony Stark didn't matter, not on this point, because what had Tony Stark ever done to deserve such contempt from Captain America? Tony might not think he was worthy of Steve's admiration, but that didn't mean he had no right to some kind of human decency and respect.
Several skrulls – scientists? guards? maybe both – were standing on the other side of the energy wall, and Tony wondered what exactly they were planning to do. Leave him to die on his own? Try to interrogate him, to get him to do things for them – that had worked so well in Afghanistan, hadn't it? He wasn't a very “interesting” specimen of the human race, so they were unlikely to try and dissect him – though, at the same time, he was perfectly “baseline”, to a point where it was kind of surprising, how anyone could be so genetically bland? So in a way he was a very good standard to base their studies of the human race off. Which wasn't a positive way to think, but Tony had never been particularly positive, and generally didn't pretend to be.
Tony wanted to laugh – not because it was funny.
Tony snorted – did not linger on the fact that, indeed, very few would be the people not to believe he'd fallen off the wagon again, and certainly Steve wouldn't because Steve never did. Wanda had offered to accompany him, so she could say he hadn't been drunk, but apart from her...
Though the last one was still tempting, in all honesty.
He took a deep breath, passed a hand through his hair, pushing away the headache that was coming – he couldn't hear the gulps of scotch at the next table, he couldn't smell bourbon from the glass the guy behind him had in hand, he couldn't see the color of the beer in Steve's mug through it, but he could imagine it just right, and it was like he could, like he just had to extend a hand and everything would be back to the good old days, with a brandy and a smile as everything horrible in his life fadded away for a few hours.
Or, to be precise, almost all of it, from when Tony was twenty-three, to this day, almost eleven years later. But who was counting – who cared what fraction exactly of Tony's life Steve represented?
He was back to wondering, how many things had he done that he didn't remember, were there any other crimes to add to these murders, that he didn't even know about it.
Letting Steve see for himself.
Well. Iron Man still had to answer to Tony Stark's schedule, which was why he interrupted Steve as the man was reading his newspaper.
“Don't answer that, please. I... I get it. I'm sorry.”
It... It gave Tony hope – he could already envision the hard crash that particular hope would bring, because that never failed, did it? But he had to go on believing, to continue hoping the best of people, even while he couldn't afford not to be pragmatic about it – because if he didn't, what was keeping him from not charging his chestplate this time around and let himself be done with it? Why was he so intent on being a responsible person, on not dumping all of his responsabilities, if it wasn't in the hope that something good would eventually come out of it?
He grabbed her arm – the left one, flesh – and immediately noticed as eyes turned towards them, locking on his hand – locked on her arm. He let go, but she'd stopped – for now – and he stood up, too, because he had to...
So, Tony managed not to even greet the Avengers himself when he offered the mansion for their headquarters, using his Iron Man persona instead to extend the invitation, and only after that did he officially “meet” them. It was better that way: the less they saw him, the less context they could associate him with that would remind them of Iron Man... the less likely they were to discover anything – Jarvis probably caught on after a few months, but that was because Jarvis knew him better than anyone else who was still alive, because he was one of the rare people who actually wanted to believe in Tony, and it wasn't like the old man ever said anything. Jarvis, moreover, and unlike some other people, seemed to understand that whatever Tony's reasons were, he didn't have to explain himself to anyone about it.
Liar.
It didn't help when Steve agreed.
Tony put his hand only a few milimeters away from the energy wall, palm and fingers splayed as he'd do against a wall of glass. He could feel it sizzling, hot against his skin.
It was better to be in a good mood when attending anything that could be seen as vaguely political or business-related, and meeting the Carnelian ambassador was definitely that. The day started well enough, and should almost certainly end the same way.
Ah, well.
Captain America was a good man, and for him Tony would break his own word – for entirely selfish reasons, actually – and get himself involved in the Avengers' lives. Or, at least, in Steve Rogers'.
The woman squinted her eyes at him, but she didn't look upset by his statement, unlike the other skrulls who looked positively fuming at what they surely thought of as defiance.
"But I guess it doesn't matter what I think because when it comes down to it, you always pick him."
But he could never know. For what Steve knew of the situation, it was only a joke, and Iron Man was simply complaining about Steve not trusting his judgment on his employer. No big deal.
“Sorry.”
Hank pointed the device at him, and while it didn't look like a gun, it didn't look like a water pistol either. A green dot was blinking in Tony's direction, faster and faster, until it blinked out, as if disappointed.
The Director of SHIELD looked back at the president, leaving Tony to wallow in self-pity for about five seconds.
It shouldn't be one, at this point.
But he guessed, no matter the outcome, if he died, Steve would rather have tried – saving Bucky, keeping the dream alive – even if it didn't actually happen, because... Because he'd have tried his best, then. If it didn't happen it wouldn't be his fault.
“They might like Iron Man, Mr. President, but what you have to understand is that most of them despise Tony Stark more than they like Iron Man. The PR campaign would go well with the normal folks, but it would be a disaster in the superpowered community.”
“I was barely awake, I was completely lost and you were... You were you.”
Right?
He didn't even want to try and explain the few things he could, not anymore. He was tired of always saying the same things and never being heard – because obviously Steve didn't believe him there, not even when he was saying the truth.
Tony snorted.
Steve scowled, but at least didn't say anything about how selfish Mr. Stark was being right now, refusing to do what he'd always done and just make it happen. Had Iron Man mentioned it, though, then he'd have heard something about how they didn't need Mr. Stark's help – completely ignoring the fact that Iron Man's armor was entirely thanks to Tony Stark's good will, of course – because one way or another Tony always got it wrong, didn't he?
That maybe, some of the people on Steve's side would go over to SHRA, just because their need to help would be more important than their own liberty.
The fact that Steve still called him “sir” was enough for Tony to remember that Cap didn't actually care for Tony Stark, and was reacting so only because he was afraid of being rude – more likely, even, because he didn't want to sound like he didn't believe in Iron Man.
But Tony wasn't going to let him finish that.
Oh, actually, it was like he was talking about Yinsen here. He could work with that. What did Tony Stark think about his encounter with Yinsen – that he didn't deserve to be the one walking out of there, that he should have found a way to get both of them out, not just himself, because who needed a tool that could save itself but not those it was supposed to serve?
He couldn't help thinking of all the things that kept him awake at night, he couldn't ignore all the ways his creations, his actions could backfire, but he couldn't either not do anything. The worry, the guilt, the disgust at everything he had ever done possibly being turned against its purpose, the doubt would eventually prevent him from thinking clearly.
That was what Tony was aiming for, to bring Iron Man back, so...
Once again, Steve had his little, absolutely-not-questionable plan to take Iron Man out. Nothing better than to do the whole scrambler ruse again, except this time without ruse and with Vision's assistance instead.
“Is it mind-control? Is that why you've been doing... things... you wouldn't normally do? Or... Is he holding something over you? Can we... Can we help?”
Whitney had left. SHIELD, an organization that he had helped on so many degrees, had been trying to manipulate him and take over SI. Cap hated Tony Stark. Bethany hated Iron Man. Tony Stark could never afford to make a mistake, because when he made a mistake, people lost their job. Iron Man could never afford to make a mistake, because when he made a mistake, people lost their life. Both of him had to keep in mind all the ways he could potentially fail at something, while remaining aware that there was always a way he might not have thought of, lest he became overconfident and got someone's life ruined, or got someone killed – and he had failed at that, hadn't he?
He didn't quite get what Steve was sorry about – what he knew for sure was that Steve couldn't be sorry for what he actually should be sorry for, and that the only things he could mean here were things he didn't have to be sorry for, because that was how this shit worked.
Logan squinted at him, at Steve, and back at Tony – Iron Man.
She squinted at him all the time it took the nurse to make sure Steve was alright, which, considering Steve wasn't telling her that Stark was right here even though he should be dead, was probably fair.
Tony frowned, made a non-commital, questioning sound, and already knew that he couldn't say yes, because all that would result in would be them all dying together as Sentinels laid waste to the super community, and accidentally the rest of the country as collateral damage.
The approximate moment it started, Steve would later suppose, was the morning of his trial. If he were to try to recall the exact situation of that morning, here was what it would look like: things being as they were, he'd woken up in the apartment / cell in Manhattan he'd been kept at after the first week in the Raft, after Stark had come by and stood as Steve had spewed the ugly truth at him, not even taking the helmet off.
No, he didn't know that. If he did, he wouldn't be doing it. Yes, it was a compromise, a precaution, but Steve was naive if he thought some things weren't compromises of some kind. Option A, Tony let his tech out there, and someone used it to kill people or otherwise destroy their lives, Option B, he went and got it back, at the cost of his reputation and a few bruises for the Guardsmen. Tony knew what he was ready to sacrifice, and it wasn't the lives of innocents.
Still.
Misty shrugged, and drank some of her beer.
Steve wasn't finished, though.
They shook hands, and as they did, Steve added:
He just hoped he wouldn't keep putting her into that situation, but even that he couldn't be sure of.
He looked at Steve, jaws aching as he gritted his teeth, the armor reporting scans of hundreds, thousands of victims, and that was just in the vicinity. How could he not understand, how could he not see it?
But no. Steve didn't make a move, and this time it wasn't because he was moping.
They were wearing SHIELD uniforms, but one of them – at least – was a skrull and Tony just didn't understand why a skrull was wearing a SHIELD uniform for a long moment of confusion – was it, perhaps, one of the expats who actually liked the Earth? There was one in London, he thought, so it was a possibility, but...
The look she gave Steve made him shut up – it was like he was entirely missing the point, like it'd be goddamn funny if it wasn't so horrible, except Steve still didn't know what this was all about.
Unable to escape.
“Your people cloned Thor, and he killed Bill Foster, and you think maybe you haven't gone too far yet?”
What was Steve sorry for, though?
What he knew was that he needed a way to differentiate realities the moment he woke up, which was why he took a gold wristband for the world in which Tony had died for him, and a red one for the one where Tony had died because of him.
If...
Or would Steve argue that kid deserved to be free, and therefore it didn't matter when Carnage ate them for breakfast because they were in over their head?
Tony looked at him quizzically, but didn't say a thing.
Maybe Tony should just consider that one way or another, when Steve was convinced of the evils of whatever-what-was-going-on-this-time, he never stopped to consider that maybe he wasn't right about everything – and, before anyone commented, no, Tony did consider such possibilities, he just usually ended up back to the first conclusion and so didn't change his course of action so often.
“This is exactly why there needs to be an Avengers team. If the old Avengers don't want to, if they can't, then let's try these new ones. Like we always have.”
Misty tilted her head to the right.
It was pretty obvious that the marshal wasn't the actual target – well, okay, someone might be gunning for him personally, but given the circumstances it was more than likely that Steve, no, Captain America, was the actual target – and if Steve was going to be gunned down, he'd rather there'd be no collateral damages.
Which was why Steve was now standing in Pepper Potts' office, as the woman was staring him down even from her chair, as if she couldn't quite figure out why he'd even want to be here.
Not good for not antagonizing Steve, that. Then again, it wasn't like the man didn't do his own part of the antagonizing well enough.
Steve's next words sounded a bit – wobbly was a weird qualification for this, but wobbly it was.
“Yeah, you heard it right. Sapiens Tony Stark says he's fine, he's alright, he's not injured, he's not going to die, and next thing you know, he is fine, he is alright, he isn't injured, he isn't going to die. Turns out no one knew, but he was a mutant, and no one had ever noticed, because he'd been telling everyone that he wasn't one, he'd been telling himself that he wasn't one, and apparently his mutant power was to affect himself into being exactly what he said he was.”
This time Carol forced herself to smile – it felt razor-sharp, aggressive – as she stood up.
He vacated a whole factory, put it on fire. He burned several of his favors and arguments for this last chance to convince the others to work within the system instead of bringing them in without giving them a chance – he wasn't sure he could ever offer another official chance if Steve refused that one, though that wouldn't stop him from managing to talk in secret if he absolutely had to, except he had a hundred spies on his back, and an agent at his side almost twenty-four / seven, and losing them the time to talk would mean losing some credit too, and he'd need at least some left for his global amnesty once this would come to an end.
More outraged at the thought that Iron Man could doubt his morals – hypocritical, considering that he'd been doing the same to Iron Man and Tony Stark for the last decade – than concerned at the fact that, maybe, one of the people working for him might have decided to go ahead and not abide by the Steve Rogers Book of Rules. Probably not even considering it.
But this was the last try, the last chance before it was too late, before it got worse and Tony had to resort to more problematic solutions – on both sides of the equation, because there wouldn't be an offer left, and there wouldn't be a clean solution.
He took a step away. Didn't stop looking at Steve.
And now... Now Tony was in a room with the President of the United States and Nick Fury, feeling like he had the worse hangover in history, waiting for the results of the test that would say if he was actually hangover – and if he was, then there was an enormous problem because he hadn't drunk a thing and either someone had made him forget or he was losing time again, which wasn't something he wanted to repeat.
