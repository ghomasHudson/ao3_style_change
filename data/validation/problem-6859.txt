Pepper eyes him, but doesn’t refute it, just pulls up the first form on her tablet, and passes it over. “Come on,” she says, “the sooner we get done with this, the sooner you can go back to tinkering.”
“Look who just came in,” Tony says, loud enough to be overheard, but low enough that it doesn’t seem entirely intentional.
“You’re still you,” Tony replies. He’s not sure if the question was meant to be rhetorical, but it’s not like he can let that go. “You weren’t always Captain America. You weren’t always a soldier.”
Tony tips his head to eye Steve over the tops of his sunglasses. It’s possible Steve has been a little judgmental of Tony’s ever-present sunglasses in the past, especially at night, but now he’s rethinking his stance on them, and wishing he had a pair of his own. They clearly have their uses, such as dealing with a mob of photographers. Their fake dates that first week had been nothing like this. “You look ready to bolt,” Tony tells him frankly.
Steve hadn’t asked who or what Clint had lost, but he’d tucked the drawing he’d done of Clint that night under his door the next morning, and the last time he’d been to Clint’s apartment he’d seen it tacked up on the fridge.
It lasts forever, and no time at all, Steve hot and close enough he’s almost completely blocking the light of the arc reactor, reaching a hand down between them to jack Tony off in time with the rhythm of his hips, kissing him through it until they lose all finesse, and Tony can’t do anything but hang on.
Rhodey claps him on the shoulder, joviality a little forced, but not as much as it had been earlier. “Then let’s get you hitched.”
Tony barely refrains from rolling his eyes. “Thank you,” he says instead. “Is Steve in the hall, yet?”
“I always pay attention,” Tony retorts, realizes too late how that sounds, then breathes an inner sigh of relief when Steve just rolls his eyes.
Thor is now looking at him like he’s lost it, and that is not at all comforting. “Did you not make a proposal that was accepted by Director Fury?”
“I don’t know if I should be getting out my checkbook or trying to sign up for Basic,” Tony says, figures someone’s got to say something to prevent this being completely unbearable.
Coulson passes another folder to Natasha, and starts piling the rest together again while he answers. “You’re going on a date tomorrow to make it obvious you are, in fact, dating, in such a way that the press will think they’ve caught you out. The information will be leaked on Friday that you are, more to the point, engaged, to be followed that evening by another date, minus the subterfuge. The wedding on Sunday will be small, quiet, and tasteful, and when the press finds out on Monday that it has already happened while they were chasing their tails trying to find every public image of the two of you within shouting distance of each other, that is exactly what they will hear. The wedding pictures will be sold for charity – ONE Campaign and the Trevor Project appreciate your donation. From that point on, you will be very much the picture of a honeymooning celebrity couple. You will appear at every benefit and society opening and charity gala holding hands with smiles on your faces. If anyone asks, you are blissfully happy. And everyone else,” he looks around at everyone, “is blissfully happy for you.”
“We just wanted to congratulate you both,” one of the women practically purrs, sidling right up into their collective space.
“I admire what you’re trying to do, here, Cap,” she says, no pretense at small talk. “We all do. Taking one for the team. It’s a noble thing you’re doing, and it won’t be easy. Tony is a handful, though if anyone can handle him, it would be you.”
A burst of laughter from where Tony’s been chatting with his own makeup artist almost makes Steve snap. It’s infuriating the way Tony just turns it on and off, refusing to even make eye contact with Steve, then smiling and joking with the girl doing his makeup like there’s nothing wrong.
Tony feels his hand twitch instinctively to cover the arc reactor, and forcibly drops it back to his side, taps the screwdriver against his leg, instead. “That wasn’t a request for compliments, actually. That was. This is. Not a good idea, Steve.”
“I don’t want to distract him, though,” Steve says slowly, wondering if that’s the problem, “not if he’s got work to do.”
Tony doesn’t say anything, for once, just nods encouragingly. He also doesn’t let go of Steve’s hand, but, oddly enough, Steve doesn’t really mind.
“Jarvis?” Steve asks, only a little hesitant, as the doors slide closed. “Where is – where is everyone? Are they all back?”
“You enjoyed yourselves?” Mr. Cooper asks, and he’s grinning, raises an eyebrow in Steve’s direction, and Steve realizes how hot his face is.
Steve gives him a wry smile. “I didn’t love feeding time for the piranhas,” he admits, “or the way they think it’s acceptable to ask such invasive questions in a public space like that – or anywhere, really, but especially in a place where they shouldn’t be to begin with. But I had a good time in spite of that, and I hope having to make a hasty exit didn’t ruin it for you.”
It’s less than five minutes to get the last of the passengers out of the train, clutching their belongings and moving in tight knots, though only a few of them shriek when the rats get too close. At least one of them is taking video, and several others have their phones out, clearly trying to get pictures. Tony is unimpressed.
“Don’t miss me too much,” Steve says, feeling determined now, as he carefully tries to disentangle his limbs from Tony’s. Then, because he can’t pull off pet names the way Tony does, but feels like he has to do something, he presses a kiss to Tony’s cheek.
Tony shakes his head at both of them. “I’m glad you’re not evil, Pepper-pot,” he tells her. “We’d all be doomed.”
“Yes, ma’am,” Steve replies automatically, but he continues to sit there for a long moment after Ms. Potts and Tony head for the elevator, taking deep, slow breaths. He’s not sure why the idea of going to get a marriage license is all of a sudden making him tense up. He knew what the plan was, and it’s not like the legality of it is going to change anything, anyway. It just seems oddly
Right by the windows is an easel that’s already been set up, a single sheet of paper attached, with a note that just reads, “Don’t worry about your laundry.” A complete set of charcoals is lined up on a tray next to it.
Even though he knows it would be rude, he’s a little tempted to pull out the little notebook he keeps and sketch, just for something to do with his hands. He’s not nervous, exactly, just uncomfortable, and as much as Tony’s constant movement seems to be a regular source of irritation for whichever unfortunate is sitting next to him in meetings, Steve understands having trouble just sitting still. Especially when he’s uncomfortable.
The ringing of his phone – loud in the stillness of the studio – is startling enough that Steve almost jumps. He fumbles the phone out of his pocket, and swears. It’s Coulson. Steve definitely should have checked in hours ago. He wonders if they debriefed without him, or if they were waiting to hear from him.
Coulson’s mouth does the twitchy thing again. “Were that the case, I’m sure an exception could be made.”
It’s Rhodey’s turn to huff. “All the brilliant minds on your do-gooder team, and at SHIELD, and at SI, and no one can come up with
interested, and it makes Steve wonder about more than just kissing, if that would be as good, what Tony might be like if they didn’t have an audience.
Steve almost asks if something’s wrong, but Natasha is unlikely to share unless she wants to, and, really, the thought that he might be able to get away from the spotlight dance and whirl for a bit and do what he
“Doing all right?” Tony has shifted a little so he has a better angle on Steve’s face and the scrutiny from such close quarters is disconcerting.
“I didn’t know you had a bad side,” Mr. Cooper replies, and it sounds to Steve like more than simple flattery. “But I know publicity shots when I see them. What did you really do? When it wasn’t a romantic dinner for twelve, not counting the cameras.”
“Good,” Tony confirms, glad for the voice modulator as his own voice comes out a little croaky. He’s not sure they’ve even been this close when they were actually dancing, just a handful of the times he’s kissed Steve in public, and now is really not the time to be thinking about that. “They’re not giant by alligator standards,” he says, jumping back to the previous subject just for something to say, and, “Hang tight, here we go,” as he lifts off and heads for the –
“No,” the answer is immediate, the word dropping from Tony’s lips automatically. Then, just as quickly, almost on top of each other, “Yes. Not. No. Nothing.” Tony forces himself to sit straight even as his spine tries to curl, wanting to roll himself up into a ball and maybe not move ever again.
“What?” Tony says again. He was at least half expecting a fight, but he also thought he knew what they’d be fighting about.
“I.” Steve stops, not quite sure how to answer that. “I’m moved in?” It comes out as more of a question than he meant it to.
Pepper nods and continues. “Dr. Banner is, of course, already there. Natasha and Agent Barton are welcome at any time. Unless SHIELD objects to its agents living off-base?”
Tony quirks an eyebrow, but doesn’t protest, just taps something else rapid-fire into his phone and tucks it into a pocket. “After you,” he says, pushes the door open before Steve can stop him, and doesn’t even look surprised when the alarm doesn’t go off. “I disabled it,” he says, like it’s nothing. “It’ll kick back in in a couple minutes.”
“Yeah,” Steve steps into the room. “Nice weather. Bagels?” He puts the bag on the bar, glad he got the full dozen, and relieved he hadn’t pushed himself hard enough to be sweating much.
Tony blinks. “Not you,” he says. “Other people. If you’re going to sleep with someone, they need to sign that, so they don’t blow the cover off this marriage thing we have going on, or accuse you of cheating in the press, or whatever it is they’d come up with.”
, because he’s pretty sure Pepper would have found out and put a stop to it if it were anything actually cruel, but for all he knows, someone bet Steve he couldn’t actually pretend he liked Tony, and this is the culmination of several months’ worth of effort. It seems unlikely (Rhodey would probably say
Tony does not seem to have the same trouble figuring out what to do. He steps right up into Steve’s space and brushes a kiss to his cheek before pulling out his own chair and sinking into it, smile firmly in place.
“Nothing fancy, but please find something that’s not covered in grease.” Tony can see her judging him out of the corner of his eye. “And maybe take a shower, so
But Steve looks up when Tony comes in, marks his place with the flap of the cover, and puts the book down.
“Drop me there?” Steve asks, points towards the Bethesda Terrace, which is a little more open on top than he wants, but at least is a bit higher up.
Midway through June, Tony takes Steve to a baseball game, and doesn’t realize until they’re at Citi Field that it’s Father’s Day. Not that it should matter, they get people coming up to them any time they’re recognized, asking for autographs or photos. The fact that the ballpark is full of families celebrating mostly just means more kids, which is usually more fun and less awkward than adults, anyway.
. This closeness with another person, the semi-frantic push-pull of it. He drags his fingertips along Tony’s spine, feels the shiver that elicits, the way Tony pushes even closer, wants more of that.
“I.” Steve stops, frowns again, and realizes they’re having two different conversations. He thinks. “The
Tony’s forehead crinkles. “Wrong?” he asks. “Are we talking generals, here? National, international, intergalactic? You’ve got to give me more to work with, here. Are you hearing noises? Feeling weird tingles in your brain? Growing numbness in your hands or feet? How about –”
“Let me?” Steve says again, and it’s a question this time. “I want to.” Like Tony’s going to say no.
“Right,” Steve nods. Gives himself a firm mental shake and releases Tony entirely, stepping back himself.
“I’m not,” Steve repeats, a little more firmly. He won’t be, anyway. Nothing to worry about, after all.
“Scotch on the rocks,” Tony confirms, only the slightest widening of his eyes betraying his surprise that Steve remembered. Steve really does need to be better than this.
“There will be an after,” Steve insists, tips their foreheads together. “I’m going to take you out for dinner,” he says, voice gone soft.
Ms. Potts gives him another smile that doesn’t make him feel any more comfortable, then glides off in the direction of her own office.
“Thank you. Could –” Steve cuts off at the sight of Ms. Potts waiting for the elevator. “Ms. Potts. Hello.” As if trying to navigate a conversation with Jarvis wasn’t awkward enough.
“Wonderful.” Tony holds out his arms for the suit, letting it wrap around him. He takes half a second to breathe, letting himself relax for just a moment as the faceplate comes down and the HUD lights up, and then he’s off, launching himself from the platform and circling down the runway into the hangar.
would support the denial of anyone’s basic rights makes him nauseous. He’d been so thrilled earlier, watching videos from Chicago, and even while he’d been doing that, people had been claiming he was morally opposed to the very thing those videos had been celebrating.
Steve pauses halfway through tying his laces. “Half-four? You mean four-thirty? In the morning? How long did he sleep?”
“Sorry, J. If he tries to pay rent, tell him all expenses are covered by his contract. The others don’t pay for anything, he’d figure out soon enough he wasn’t, either, and then just get pissed all over again.”
this is how these things always end up. It’s what got them shackled together in the first place. Somehow, though, he’d started to think they were past this, that maybe they were starting to actually get along. Tony’s even enjoyed some of the time they’ve spent together, and not just because Steve’s nice to look at, especially when he’s all spruced up.
loudly. But this, this walking along, lost in their own thoughts, nowhere specific they have to be – even if it’s because they’re stalling – no one they have to save, it’s just. Nice.
“Right,” Steve nods, not really in response to Tony’s words, but decisively, anyway. “So.” He isn’t really sure where to go from here. Maybe best to ease into casual conversation. “I saw the photos. From last night. They were. Something else.”
“What? Why?” That sounds suspiciously like a fight waiting to happen, and Tony has a bet going with himself on how long he can go without wanting to break his fist on Steve’s face. He’s pretty sure it would be longer than he can go without wanting to kiss him, and he’s got a little lip-biting action next time he kisses Steve for the cameras in the pot if he makes it to forty-eight hours.
“Don’t be such a wuss, Iowa,” Steve sounds like he’s trying not to laugh. “They were twice this size where I grew up.”
“Right,” Steve tries not to look either too impressed or too disapproving, and steps past Tony into what turns out to be an alley.
“I wouldn’t put anything past them,” Ms. Potts tells him frankly. “Phil’s been better about it than I’d expected, but he’s been a bit more of a family man than a company man since the invasion. And there’s only so much he would be able to do to head them off, in any case.”
Steve frowns. “Yes?” he doesn’t mean for it to come out a question, but it lilts up a bit at the end anyhow.
Steve startles, looks up, so close they’re sharing air, and Tony will never know which one of them moved first, but they’re kissing.
If they had been anyone else, Steve’s pretty sure there would have been a mad dash for the door. As is, Natasha and Clint are silently gone in seconds, and Banner and Tony have vanished out into the corridor – Banner asking Tony something about the lab – before Steve has even made it out of his chair.
“If it would make you happy –” she starts, but stops at the look on his face. “Tony, is it really that awful already?”
Bruce hums down the line again. “Movement patterns and growth radius suggest two cars down from Hawkeye, towards the back of the train. I can’t tell from here if it’s science or magic.”
“Can we discuss surveillance above ground?” Natasha’s voice is dry as dust. “Those of us not encased in metal would appreciate the fresh air.”
“I want – Steve,” Tony pulls his hand from between them, hooks his thumb into the waistband over Steve’s hip and tugs. “Get these off,” he tugs again.
Pepper flicks him in the shoulder. “I mean it,” she says. “You’re taking me to breakfast tomorrow morning for dealing with all of this, and I except you to be at least somewhat rested and fully clean.” She gives his oil-stained clothes a pointed look.
“Your chariot,” Tony offers a hand, lets Natasha balance as she steps up onto one of his boots and slings her arms around his neck.
“I was just curious if you were paying attention,” Steve admits when he stops quietly wheezing. “You could have been building the next Helicarrier, for all I can tell.”
“Very good, Sir.” Jarvis goes silent, but continues putting footage up on the HUD for Tony to flip through. It’s not particularly pretty.
Pepper gives him another long look, appraising in a different way. “It will be okay,” she says, soft, but serious.
That makes Clint laugh. “If you say so, Cap.” He doesn’t dispute the gossip rag comment, Steve notes.
“It had nothing to do with the fact that he was male,” Tony snaps, then shuts his mouth again. This isn’t Pepper’s fault.
and the sound of cursing from under the car, and then the music cuts out and Tony rolls into view on a creeper, clutching his head. He squints up at Steve. “What the hell?”
“Sir is with Ms. Potts in the living area of the penthouse,” Jarvis’s reply is prompt, but Steve is pretty sure he’s not imagining the chill to his tone. “Dr. Banner is in the penthouse kitchen. Agent Barton is on the deck. And Agent Romanoff is in the gym. Would you like to go somewhere other than the penthouse?”
There’s a slight rasping noise that might be computerized laughter, but when Jarvis speaks, his voice is as dry as ever. “Of course not, Captain.”
Hours later, and the fight still rankles. Steve knows part of it is how wound up he is these days, the pressure of always looking happy whenever there are cameras around. And there are
,” Pepper says, raises her voice just enough that Tony knows it’s no use trying to ignore her, “to remind you that the fundraiser on Sunday night is black tie, and you are not allowed to leave either before or during the speeches. This is your first official event as a couple, we need to give everyone ample opportunity to see what an adorable and adoring pair of newlyweds you are.”
It’s more and less than Tony thought Steve would know, at this point. It’s not like he ever talks about Obie or Trent if he can help it, but with Obie, at least, he thought Steve would have had a more thorough briefing from SHIELD. “As per usual,” Tony tells him as coldly as he can manage, “you’ve latched on to information you think is complete, and run with it. That may have been the way to do things in ye olden days, but we like to use our brains, now.”
“It’s not the tape, Tony, and you know it.” Pepper really does know him too well. “It’s the pictures, it’s the article –”
Steve manages not to jerk back in surprise, but it’s a near thing. His hand comes up, palm catching on Tony’s shoulder, and it might be to hold him still or push him back, Steve doesn’t even know himself, but Tony’s already pulling away, settling back down onto his feet, slightly smug smile making his lips curl. Steve, still a little thrown, realizes Tony had gone up on his toes to reach him, and finds himself smiling back.
And that’s just it. Tony snaps. “I was thinking about someone besides myself!” he hisses, faceplate retracting so he can give Steve the full power of his glare. He shakes his own arm at Steve, because if the chomped-on armor is what he’s so pissed about, well, Tony got it preventing him from becoming alligator chow. “I was thinking about you, you jackass. Not that you’d recognize what that looks like, anymore. You don’t give a damn about anyone here, don’t bother to get to know anyone, or let anyone get to know you. Is there even anyone who knows you well enough to care about you?”
There’s a slight scratching noise – Jarvis’s solution to rolling his eyes. “Had you wanted to change access permissions for Captain Rogers, sir?”
“Anything you say, Panda Bear,” Tony waves him off, rolling his eyes, and turns back to the schematics he’d been fussing with before dinner.
he thinks acidly, then firmly stomps on the thought. It’s not like it will help. He needs to figure out what he’s doing here and now; tomorrow can be dealt with when it happens. He squeezes back, only a little hesitantly, because he can see what looks like very real concern on Tony’s face, in spite of the glasses, and while he’d rather be miles away, that’s not an option, and he certainly doesn’t want to cause a scene.
“On your eight,” Barton’s voice is exactly the sort of casual Tony’s come to associate with a steady stream of flying fatalities. “Ready for pickup.”
Tony sighs and pushes himself to his feet, goes to pour himself a healthy measure of bourbon. “Don’t be in a snit,” he says, swallows half the drink in one go. “It’s not like I planned this. I didn’t get up this morning thinking, ‘oh! I know! I’ll piss Fury off today and marry a national goddamned icon to fix it!’” Tony empties the glass and pours another. “This is not,” he stares at the amber liquid for a moment, swirls it around, but doesn’t drink. “This is not going to be easy. I am aware of that. I know my track record. I know
Pepper eyes him for a moment, lips pursed, but nods. It’s true enough, at least for a certain value of true. Something else will catch the public eye, something more recent, and in a week, everyone will be fussing over that. Trent can crawl back to whatever hellhole he’d crawled out of sixteen years ago, and Tony can go back to pretending Trent McPherson never existed.
The board definitely thinks it’s all thanks to Steve, Pepper had been right about that all those months ago. They’re not exactly wrong, either, though it’s less Steve’s positive and grounding influence and more the fact that Tony can only handle being so close to what he wants, but can’t have, for so long before he needs to find somewhere to go where Steve won’t follow, and increasingly so, that’s not his workshop.
“Will it matter if I remember it?” Tony asks, moving where she tells him. “You’re just going to knock me on my ass either way.” They’ve only done this a few times since she moved in, but it’s been enough to teach him that she’s not going to go easy just because she’s miles better than he is. He’s gotten fairly good at falling, though, which is something he never really learned with boxing, or the various other forms of hand-to-hand he’s tried before. He gets the impression no one was quite willing to bruise his ego, let alone the rest of him. Natasha does not have that problem.
Now, Tony lets Steve lever him out of the limo and onto the red carpet, photo-ready smile looking too comfortable on his face. As soon as Tony is fully visible, the flashes go from familiarly annoying to blinding, and the hum of voices shouting for their attention swells to a mind-numbing roar. It takes all of Steve’s training not to flinch, or duck back into the limo, or just take off down the street on foot.
The smirk turns a little sly. “Now,” Tony says, steps right up into Steve’s space, tips up onto his toes again, “now, we go get takeout to bring home from the nicest place on Pepper’s list, and let them think whatever they want to think about that.” They’re so close they’re almost kissing, and it’s more distracting than it should be.
“If that’s sorted, then we’re all done here,” Coulson says, picking up his pile of papers in one hand, and his breakfast plate in the other. “See you all in a few days.” He puts the plate in the sink, and then vanishes down the hallway to the elevator.
Tony jerks back, feeling a little like he’s been slapped. “You don’t know the first thing about it.”
He pulls around the side of the building to park his bike, throws the kickstand, and heads back out to the sidewalk, taking a deep breath and letting it out again slowly before rounding the corner.
There’s a flurry of motion as everyone finds plates and knives and passes the little tubs of cream cheese around. Ms. Potts manages to tuck the folders she and Coulson were flipping through into her impressively large purse before any food gets on them.
There’s a noise from the doorway – a throat being cleared – and both men turn to see Pepper standing just inside the room. “Much as I hate to break up this touching display of manly affection,” she says, dry as dust, “it’s time to go.”
The sight of Steve laughing, and the hand the woman has casually rested on his arm, make Tony feel a little sick, and he tells himself very firmly he is not allowed to be jealous. Steve should be talking to people, making friends. Tony knows he’d dated at least casually before they’d had to become New York’s It Couple, had made one or two passing comments about how dating now was a little like being on the Star Spangled Show all the time, with how much more lax everything was. And now that the constant scrutiny has eased up, it would make sense that Steve would want to start getting out there again. Maybe find someone closer to his own age. If he hasn’t already been seeing someone discreetly, anyway, and that’s another thing Tony has been pointedly not thinking about.
“Sir is in his office.” Jarvis’s response is prompt as always, but Steve still thinks his tone is a little cool.
They don’t speak again until the waiter has returned with what was indeed wine and left with their orders.
Steve echoes him, then, “Are you okay?” and, not even waiting for an answer, “This maybe isn’t the best place for this. Can we –?”
if it’s just for show, and he knows it isn’t going to last forever. He can feel the vibrations of Steve’s laugh, and maybe it’s a bad idea, maybe he’s just digging himself deeper into a hole, but he’s going to do whatever he can to keep Steve this happy, or happier, for however long he’s given.
“Why don’t we just help each other out?” Steve says, all in a rush. He’s so red now Tony can almost feel it, they’re so close, but he looks determined.
It’s the work of only a few minutes to find a niche that’s only partially blocked from view. It should be awkward, Steve thinks, but Tony pulls him in close, and one moment they’re standing there, frozen, Tony watching something over Steve’s shoulder, and then he’s breathing out, “Vultures are like clockwork,” and the next moment they’re kissing. Really kissing. Steve had thought they’d been kissing for the cameras for months now, but this. He’s never kissed someone like this outside of a bedroom, before. This is teeth and tongue and ruined hair and scant inches from public indecency.
Tony swallows, throat suddenly dry. He knows it’s just lust, but he wants to keep that look on Steve’s face for as long as he can.
The hail-like shower of pennies falling from the Empire State Building cuts out as abruptly as their sources say it started, leaving behind cracked windows, dented cars, and more bruises than Tony wants to think about. Luckily, there haven’t been any reports yet of anything more serious than a concussion and a few sprained ankles from people running in panic.
“I appreciate your concern,” Steve says, as sincerely as he can, because Tony’s still watching him like he’s trying to decide if Steve is about to break apart, but also because it’s true, and Steve’s gradually becoming convinced that not only will Tony continue to brush off deserved apologies, but he’s unlikely to accept straight out gratitude, either. That being the case, Steve’s going to have to find other ways to fix things, and letting Tony know that Steve recognizes what Tony’s doing for him, and being better about doing his part at these dog and pony shows, is as good a place as any to start.
Steve can’t help but roll his eyes a bit, and is pleased when Ms. Potts’s smile shades into something a bit more genuine.
Steve has to force himself not to tense up, has no idea what to say. Mr. Cooper’s looking at him, now, like he expects something exciting or sweet, when, in reality, Steve hadn’t seen Tony except for at dinner. He had spent most of the day at SHIELD, and the rest split between the gym and the library. From what Tony had said at dinner, he’d spent most of the day in his workshop or meetings. None of that particularly screams
,” she says, voice quiet but with an edge he’s heard before so rarely he can count each time on one hand, and have fingers left over, “anyone at all, gives you any grief about this, I will personally ensure they regret it until the day they die.”
“The indomitable Pepper Potts,” Fury doesn’t even sound sarcastic. “She’s impressively effective. I wouldn’t piss her off, even if I were you.” The look Fury gives him seems significant, but Steve can’t quite parse it.
Steve doesn’t even get any words out this time, just opens his mouth, and shuts it again when Coulson keeps talking.
Tony scoffs. “There is no relationship. The body armor has nothing to do with my suit,” he points out.
“Right.” Tony heaves himself to his feet and follows Steve out of the room, abandoning his still-full glass on a table as he passes.
” is still ringing in his ears. It had been accompanied by a warning glare, much like the one she is currently sporting, and Steve
She doesn’t even give Tony a chance to argue, just takes him by the elbow and steers him back inside.
“Happy as clams,” Tony agrees blithely, refusing to take the bait. He knows what she’s thinking, but it’s too late to do anything but carry on.
“Because the masses cannot mind their own business and your previous paramour was a bag of scum,” Thor sounds like he’s reciting. “My love and her companion, the fair Darcy, explained it.”
Tony rolls his eyes expressively at Bruce, who just raises an eyebrow. “I’ll tell him. Jarvis, get the kids up to the hangar when they’re suited up.” He salutes Bruce, and the screen goes dark as he heads for the landing pad and a suit.
track record. And this is going to suck as much for him as for me, and I’d rather not have my inconvenient teenaged crush paraded around making things worse for both of us. I need you to have my back on this, J.”
Tony snorts as the elevator doors glide open and he steps out into the penthouse. “As well as they ever do. The team will likely all be moving in over the next couple days, not positive when, exactly, except for Rogers – he’ll be here within a few hours. We’re getting married.” He collapses down onto one of the couches, just for a minute.
“Congratulations,” Rhodey says, automatic, then, “Not the point. Just because you manage to stay on good terms with almost everyone you’ve ever slept with does not mean they do not leave you a wreck when it ends. They may not see the messy ball of engineering misery they leave behind, but I do, and I hate seeing that happen to you. I know I wasn’t always the most supportive of the way you slept around before, well,” Rhodey’s gesture manages to encompass the arc reactor, the armor case by the door, and everything that happened in Afghanistan and since, “but at least you were careful, and I didn’t have to worry I’d get a call in the middle of the night and find you on the dangerous end of a genius binge, wondering what was so wrong with you that nobody cared about you unless you paid them or built them.”
“I should –” Steve tries, because he should probably go handle press, too, as much as he hates it, and as much as he doesn’t actually want to go smile with Tony for the cameras, but Rhodes interrupts him, as well.
“Do we need to be here for this?” Clint asks, and Steve had almost forgotten the whole team was there.
There’s the sound of a brief squabble, out of which Barton’s “Shotgun on Cap’s bike!” comes through loud and clear.
“Sir slept for approximately three-quarters of an hour earlier this morning, twice that some three hours prior –”
“I wished also to inquire if my services would be required for the upcoming celebration. My dear Jane has explained your marriage ceremony to me, and I understand it is common practice for your comrades to stand up with you as you pledge yourselves to one another.”
Tony laughs, can’t help it, and Steve blinks at him, startled, and his grin breaks out full force. It’s nothing like the bond salesman smile. Tony feels his breath hitch, forces a cough to cover it, and reaches for his wineglass again. He is so fucked.
Fury meets Tony’s glare for a long moment, then nods once. “You’re good here. I’ll leave you to it.” And he sweeps out.
Tony grits his teeth, because Steve fucking would. “Reroute it back to his account, or donate it to an art school in his name, or something. Even seventy years of military raises wouldn’t cover this,” Tony gestures sharply at the room around him, the penthouse, the Tower, the view of the city from the center of Manhattan. “Not that he’d know that. Let him figure it out, if he cares that much.” Tony rubs both hands over his face. “Fuck him, anyway,” he tells his palms. “Get everything I want, do I? That explains so much about this situation. Must be those latent masochistic tendencies Dr. Whatsisname kept going on about.”
Tony hums noncommittally and turns back to his repairs. Pepper’s told him this at least once a week for the last ten years, he can’t imagine she actually expects him to change now.
more than a crush, but I don’t. I don’t really know him, do I? I think we’ve proven that quite often enough with the way we butt heads. I built him up in my head to be this… I don’t know. My father always.” Tony stops. Swallows. Changes tack. “Every time I think I know what he’s going to do, or how he’s going to react, he does something different. He’s human as they come, and sometimes that’s so disappointing I just want to break something, because he was the one thing I had –” Tony stops again. Takes another deep breath. “Sometimes it’s disappointing, but sometimes it just makes him real in a way I never could have imagined, and I don’t know what to do with that. I can’t figure him out. Maybe this will give me the chance to, and he’ll lose some of his sheen. Or maybe it’ll just desensitize me to his existence.”
“We’ll wait for you outside,” Rhodey says, and gives Pepper a little tug to get her moving when it looks like she might say something else.
Tony makes the very firm decision not to care, and lifts his arms to let Steve skim the shirt up and over his head, then grabs the waistband of Steve’s pants with both hands and uses his leverage to tip them over onto the bed. It’s worth it, skin to skin when Tony pulls Steve down on top him to kiss, drags one hand up the smooth planes of Steve’s back to tangle in his hair, gets the other between them, fingers pressed to the hot line of Steve’s cock through his underwear. The angle is awkward, Tony’s wrist twisted almost painfully, but the noise Steve makes sends a hard shudder down Tony’s spine, and he arches up a little, his own dick against the solid muscle of Steve’s thigh, and
, and there’s still fighting to be done, and I don’t know how to do anything else. The First World War killed my father before I ever knew him. The Second World War killed me. I don’t know some days if I’m even awake, and the things she showed me were just as real as anything else, and just as fake.”
Thor eyes him for a moment, head cocked to one side. His exuberance seems slightly dimmed. “Might I ask your intentions for this marriage, Captain?”
Tony makes a face at her. “Come on, Pep. Of all people, Coop knows it doesn’t mean anything. It was a fun ride, but neither of us wanted to stay on. Flirting with him is like flirting with Rhodey. Comfortable and harmless.”
“It’s not about me,” Steve goes on, “but before SHIELD fell, we found out some of what Hydra had done. Or what they claimed they had done. And I don’t know if it’s certain but I think. The accident that killed your parents,” Steve pauses again, and Tony goes still. Whatever he’d been bracing for, this wasn’t it. “It wasn’t an accident. Hydra was behind it. And I think it was the Winter Solider.” There’s a slight hitch to Steve’s voice, but he swallows and says, more firmly. “It was Bucky.”
bed. He’s not on the Helicarrier, either – the air quality isn’t right for it and he can’t hear the engines at all – but he can’t think for a long minute where else he would be, and for half a second he has the horrifying thought that it’s happened
The sound Fury makes isn’t agreement, but it’s not quite disagreement either. “You and Stark might have very different ideas of what kind of boat you’re sailing.”
. This is nothing like what he’d pictured the lead-up to getting married would be, in the hazy moments when he’d allowed himself to think about it at all, as a vague ‘someday’ sort of thing. He’d thought. Well. He’s known for nearly a year now that he was never going to have what he’d spent most of his life thinking, and he hasn’t had many new thoughts on the matter in that time. And those he has had, well. They were nothing like this, either.
“Sir has had two smoothies, a slice of Veggie Delight pizza, half a carton of chicken lo mein, and a number of cups of coffee which I am expressly not allowed to divulge,” Jarvis reels off. He sounds as distinctly displeased as Pepper. Tony really needs to do something about that.
Tony doesn’t say anything, just nods and stares down at the coffee in his mug, as though not entirely sure what he’s supposed to do with it.
“Anything new?” Steve asks, has been spending more time around Tony in his workshop, and has realized Tony’s work can be fascinating, even if only half of it makes sense. Steve’s started to get the impression most people don’t even understand that much, and he wouldn’t say it out loud, but it makes him feel a little smug.
“I guess.” Steve hadn’t thought of it like that, before. He doesn’t really think of the Tower as home, but he hadn’t thought of SHIELD or his apartment that way, either, and the Tower has become more home to him than either of the others, even though he hasn’t even been there quite two months.
Pepper’s hand on his arm startles him, and he jerks to look at her, grimaces at the look on her face.
“If it all goes to hell tomorrow, I didn’t want missing this to be another regret,” Steve’s voice is a rumble through both of them. “I couldn’t not know,” he breaks off, tries again, “I needed you to know,” he gives up, rocks his head back and forth against Tony’s like he’s shaking it.
Tony gives her a smile he knows she won’t buy. “I know,” he says. Then, because it’s clear Rhodey and Pepper are both waiting on him, “I’ll catch up? I just. Need a minute.”
Fury rolls his eye expressively. “If you want Stark’s history, put in a request with archives. If you can’t find it there, ask
“She was a spitfire,” Steve adds unnecessarily, and then abruptly doesn’t know where to go from there, has too many different directions.
Tony’s not quite sure what his face is doing, but Pepper’s expression abruptly shifts more towards sad.
“Nor should you,” Pepper agrees, “But that doesn’t mean you can’t let him see what you’re really like when you’re not trying to pull his pigtails, and let him figure the rest out on his own.”
“Of course, Captain.” Jarvis’s voice is still cool and judgmental, but the elevator starts to move. The doors slide open again as soon as the car stops. “Your apartment, Captain. There are fresh linens in the bedroom and bathroom, and the kitchen is stocked with non-perishable goods. Sir left instructions that you should notify me if you require anything further, either as regards furniture or smaller items.”
Pepper sighs. “I know it’s not romantic now, and the marriage is only going to be real in the legal sense, but for all intents and purposes you two will be dating for the foreseeable future. At the very least, you will have to learn to get along when you’re not actively fighting a common enemy. Who knows where else things might go?”
“Yes, that’s right,” Pepper answers for Tony, which is probably for the best, since Tony’s not sure what he would have said. “I’m not sure how anyone would find out if they weren’t living together, but these things always seem to get out somehow.”
Steve nods anyway. “We were meant to leave in less than a week. They didn’t seem to think that would be possible.”
If Steve thinks about it, he’s fairly certain he’s reading too much into it. Or maybe he’s just being plain stupid. Tony hasn’t given him any indication he’d been starting things up again with Ms. Potts when they’d been pushed together for this show marriage, and it’s the kind of thing that would have been handy to throw in Steve’s face during a fight. Still. He makes a mental note to find out why they split up, hoping it’s a less complicated process than confirming they really
“I’m also sending you a few other files. They’re older. Eyes only. And I’d highly recommend you take a look at them at your earliest convenience.”
Steve doesn’t say anything for long enough that Tony risks another glance up at him. Steve is just sitting, cradling his own cup and watching Tony. When Tony meets his eyes, he nods, like he was waiting for it. “You, too,” he says, though Tony’s not sure for what. Maybe Steve also needed a distraction. A task.
“Heaven forbid,” the dryness of Jarvis’s tone would give Pepper a run for her money. “I merely felt it might do you some good to know Captain Rogers is currently giving himself what appears to be a pep talk, and Agent Barton provided one as well before he went to join the others in the event hall.”
“You thought Howard killed your mother?” there’s something in Steve’s voice, horror or sympathy, maybe, or something in between, like the very idea is heartbreaking.
“May I ask towards what these enquiries tend, Captain?” There’s a slight edge of something Steve can’t quite place in Jarvis’s voice.
“No,” Rhodey shakes his head, but he keeps his eyes on the tie. “This is worse than a crush. You had a
Given the vast number of children around, Steve has clearly been trying to reign it in, or at least keep it clean, but Tony’s close enough to hear the muttered imprecations. He’s maybe enjoying it more than he should.
“Non-Disclosure Agreement?” he reads aloud off the top of the first page. “Why do I have to sign this?”
Startled by the sudden sting, Tony looks down again. The metal of the suit just below where Steve is holding him is warped, looks a little like someone put it in a grinder. “Jarvis?” Tony doesn’t think it hurts enough to be particularly serious, but it’s possible that’s the adrenaline talking.
“You’re also stalling,” Pepper informs him tartly, gives him a little shove. “Now go. Jarvis has the address.”
“It’s going to be everywhere,” she says, voice crisp, pure business, a perfect copy of every time she’s ever needed Tony to sign something, approve something, every time he’s shown up in the media for any number of reasons and she’s had to issue a statement for him. Tony appreciates it, and tries to ignore the way her expression still hasn’t changed. “It’s just online right now, but it will be in print by tomorrow, latest. He can’t talk about the lawsuit without going back to jail, and he can’t make something else up without someone digging and finding out the truth, so he’s going to avoid that, but the rest of it, well. It’s pretty obvious it’s not a recent thing, but it’s still going to get a lot of airtime. You’ve never been known to have serious relationships, certainly not with men, so there are going to be questions.”
“Don’t be stupid,” Natasha tells him tartly. “If he hasn’t done it by now, he’s not going to. The fact that you used to make weapons isn’t new information, he had it before he ever met you.”
“Not long,” Steve’s makeup artist replies, checking his phone. Steve should probably remember his name, but he can’t quite bring himself to reach for it. “Someone should come for you any minute now.”
Carefully, Steve brushes a hand along Tony’s forehead, like he’s pushing his hair back, his other hand sliding down to rest on Tony’s shoulder. “I think I’d like to see where this goes,” he says at last. “You make me so angry, sometimes, but I think. I think this could be worth something. I like you,” his smile is a little wry. “Probably figured that out, what with,” he drops his hand from Tony’s hair to touch his mouth, and it takes an effort not to lick at his fingertips. “But I do. Like you. And when you and Pepper first split, I thought, maybe, but there was so much going on, and now. Well. I think, right now, sleep, we’ve got to, while we can. But after. After, I’d like to try.”
Tony can see that, he thinks. He can also see the look on Steve’s face, and while he’s glad the other man is opening up, he thinks maybe this isn’t the place for this specific path down memory lane. “Did you have fun taking art classes?” he asks instead, “Did she get her wish? Or was it just a lot of fruit baskets?”
He wonders what Tony would do if he gave him a drawing, if he’d stick it on the penthouse fridge, or if he’d just laugh. Not too long ago, Steve would have leaned towards expecting mocking, but now. Now he thinks maybe Tony wouldn’t know how to respond, might think
Even though he knows Thor doesn’t mean it that way, Steve still bristles. He feels like he shouldn’t be surprised that Tony might have said something like that, but it still makes something in his stomach clench. He’d thought maybe they were getting along.
“Oh, is that all?” Steve can’t help the gentle tease, and feels something warmer than relief in his stomach when Tony just rolls his eyes, taking it for what it is instead of getting defensive the way he would have a few months ago.
“I wish you much felicity of your union,” Thor finishes, and Tony realizes he’d missed some unknown portion of Thor’s speech.
Tony is not going to listen to another lecture. Not now. “You were dead,” he says, and Steve’s mouth snaps shut so hard Tony can hear his teeth click. “Dying. All of you. But I wasn’t. I was the only one of us still standing. And it was my fault. I could have stopped it. I
Steve is already nodding. “Keep Hulk out of it while we have hostages in an enclosed area. Do we have numbers?”
And then Steve’s laughing with him, and still holding his hand, and, really, it might not have been perfect, but Tony is pretty happy with the results.
There’s an elevator waiting inside the Avengers’ private entrance, and Steve steps into it with a heavy feeling in his stomach. Even though he’s aware the fight was mostly his fault, and he knows he shouldn’t have gone off the way he did, he’s still upset. Tony’s words still rankle, and he can’t shake the feeling of horror he’d been hit with when he saw that alligator’s jaws crunch down on the Iron Man suit, when he’d heard the screech of teeth on metal and seen the arm buckle, when Tony had been thrown headlong into the tunnel wall, and when Steve had seen all the damage afterwards, when they got back up into daylight. Tony’s refusal to take his concern seriously was just the final straw. Steve’s still not sure if he can face him without yelling again.
Steve can feel the spot he kissed – warm, hot, almost, but not unpleasantly so – and he has to actively stop himself from putting his hand to his face to touch it. He sits back down a little more heavily than he’d intended, and winces at both the jolt up his spine and the creak the chair gives in protest.
“This is what we get for doing our jobs instead of providing gossip fodder every evening,” Tony had muttered into Steve’s ear about an hour in, when it already seemed like the glittering hordes had made up a schedule to prevent them from getting away easily. “Remind me of this next time I think it’s a good idea to go on a business trip right before you go running off with SHIELD.”
It’s become habit to kiss Tony like that when he’s walking away, but only ever in public, mostly at the ridiculous events they’re still expected to go to regularly. He’s never done it in private before. And while he’s been wondering what it would be like to kiss Tony without an audience, he hadn’t really been thinking about kissing him like this, a kind of comfortably casual intimacy. He’d been thinking more about the way Tony kisses him when the paparazzi clamor for it, tipped up on his toes like that first time in the park, or tugging Steve down by his tie. Or that time at the gallery, the feel of Tony pressed close from shoulder to thigh, the taste of Tony’s mouth under his. What it might be like to be able to lean over on the couch, the way Tony’s been sprawled all evening, just slide on top of him and kiss him breathless, maybe get a hand in his hair, mess it up further. Steve shakes himself, pushes himself off the wall he’d somehow managed to slump against, and finishes the trek to his room.
“But we lived at SHIELD,” Clint reminds him, sitting next to Natasha to tug on socks and shoes. “Or, at least, Nat and I did. And you had a place here, if you needed it. This was our home gym. We used the training rooms here all the time. Now we’re all over at Stark’s, and we’re only here, what, once a week? If that. It makes a difference, the mindset you’ve got when you’re in a place.”
Rhodes just rolls his eyes. “You say that like I haven’t been dealing with him for decades,” he points out.
“I guess we should be glad they’re not giant, the way the rats and pigeons were,” Tony says out loud when Steve appears, stepping out through the glass doors and striding purposefully over to where Tony’s waiting.
“Morning,” Barton says around a mouthful of eggs, impressively managing not to spray food in all directions.
“I’m just saying,” Tony doesn’t bother trying to keep the grin out of his voice, “you’ve got cameras everywhere else, or at least access to someone else’s cameras. No eyes in the sewers, though. All sorts of nefarious things could be going on down here, and you’d never know.”
Tony opens his mouth, shuts it, cocks his head a little like he’s sizing Steve up, and Steve is about to snap at him, when Tony sighs. “Look,” he says, tone much softer than Steve had been half-braced for. “You might not be tired, but I am.” Steve blinks at that, isn’t sure he’s ever heard Tony offer up any hint of weakness before, and realizes, with a start, that this is Tony trying. “If you don’t want to go now, that’s fine,” Tony continues. “But I thought it might be easier on us both if I just called Happy and had him take us somewhere – we can sneak out the back and avoid the press. They’re going to be taking pictures of us later, anyway, no point in dealing with them again now. SHIELD can handle their questions about the rats.”
“Seriously, ask Natasha about the legal stuff. Or even Pepper, she likes you, and can probably de-legalese the whole thing for you if you want. And she’s got plenty of experience dealing with my less than savory exploits, so she can give you a full rundown on the best way to play off anything. Either way, they’ll be more help to you than I would be. And I’ve got a thing, in the shop, I’m in the middle of it, so you go back to sleep, or drawing – you should show me what you’re always doing in that book, by the way – and I’ll go. Do my thing. In the shop.”
It’s well past midnight when Tony shuffles his way into the kitchen in search of caffeine. The reactor-based water filtration system he’s been working on still isn’t functioning the way he wants it to, but his notes were starting to blur. He needs either coffee or sleep, and sleep is almost never the answer.
“Sounded a lot like it,” Tony points out. He feels like he’s been on edge for days, thinks probably they all have been, and everything’s even closer to the surface with Steve. The fight outside that afternoon drove that home as much as anything else. Talking to Fury helped, he thinks, but he’s still not sure which way he’s going to have to jump.
“And then, we’ll see.” Close as they are, Tony can only see the edges of Steve’s smile, but he can hear it just fine.
“Well,” Natasha considers him for a moment, pausing her work, before taking up her task again with extra vigor. “We don’t live here, anymore.”
“I wouldn’t dream of imagining otherwise, sir.” There’s another pause. “The Captain made his suggestion in spite of knowing your regard?”
Steve’s touch is gentle, but confident, and Tony doesn’t want to know where he learned to do this, if it was before he drove a bomber into the Atlantic, or after he woke up in a brave new world. In this moment, it doesn’t matter. All that matters is Steve slowly taking him apart, fingers deep and mouth everywhere but where Tony wants it.
“It wasn’t meant to be –” he starts, stops, thinks back to all the women he’d seen Tony flirting with tonight, every night, every time they go out to one of these events. He knows Tony comes home with him every time, holding hands and smiling for the cameras, but there have definitely been periods in the middle there where Tony has vanished from the main rooms, especially lately, now that things have settled down a bit. “Have you been making time with all those ladies you meet?” he asks, tries not to bristle, but he’d thought. He’d thought. “Is that why you’re bringing this up now? You feel guilty you’ve been sneaking off and wanted to make sure I was going to do the same?”
Steve frowns again. There’s something not quite right about that, but he can’t put his finger on what. “Yes?” It lilts up a little, even though he hadn’t really intended for it to be a question. “I know it’s early, but I thought we could walk after. It’s not far from the park. And we haven’t gone out in almost a week. I know we’re supposed to be visible.” Steve makes a face of his own.
“I think someone’s getting cabin fever,” Clint’s grin is much more natural. He swings his legs, kicking his shoes against the floor like a kid. “Any chance Fury will let you off your leash long enough to come play? They’re putting together strike teams for a handful of missions, and I’ve never been to Bogotá.”
“We know you’re not homophobic, Cap,” Natasha tells him, “doesn’t mean people won’t say what they want about you to further their own ends.”
Rhodey gives him a wry grin. “Could have fooled me,” he says, tone light and only a little forced. “You certainly look the part.”
know? No, he’s not that good of an actor, to be able to hide something like that. But the others? He’s going to have to figure that out. Make sure no one thinks it’s serious, and, more importantly, make sure no one says anything about it to enlighten Steve. Tony’s pretty sure he couldn’t handle that.
“And it’s just that easy for you?” Steve isn’t sure why he doesn’t just agree, it’s just dinner, and he would definitely like to get it over with, but there’s something under his skin right now, and Tony’s insouciant attitude rankles even more than usual.
The familiar clack of Pepper’s heels against the floor has a calming effect for about half a minute. “This is a bad idea,” Tony announces. “Tell me you don’t think this is a bad idea. Because I think this is a bad idea.”
“Let me,” Steve says, hands wrapped in the bottom of Tony’s shirt, and, for a wild second, Tony almost tells him no, leave it, because the literal peak of human perfection is standing in front of him, and he can flaunt the reactor all he wants, but the scars are a different story. Steve’s seen him shirtless before, though, has seen him
Without warning, Steve reaches out to catch Tony’s hand, and tugs Tony firmly against him. Tony just manages not to flail, has to brace himself against Steve’s chest, instead.
“Welcome home, sir.” Jarvis’s voice is clear over the speakers. “There are eight new articles since this morning, two primarily regarding the newest StarkPhone, one debating the current effects of your previous relationship with Mr. McPherson, and five concerning the Avengers. Your appointment with Dr. Currin from Research and Development has been postponed, new date pending. An invitation has arrived for the Sidewalk Angels benefit next month; as per Ms. Potts’s approved list I have sent your acceptance and added it to your calendar. And the diagnostics for the GranCabrio are completed. I trust your meeting at SHIELD went well.”
“Of course, sir,” Jarvis responds promptly. “Are there any other permissions you wish to assign with this newest influx of housemates?”
to himself with a slightly pinched look, and wasn’t sure he could blame him for it. He wouldn’t really classify either of them as adorable. That seemed more appropriate for puppies and small children than two grown men, in love or not. And he was not going to touch the
Steve fiddles with the remains of his breakfast, hoping to catch Tony on the way out, but Ms. Potts, who had been having what looked like a very intense conversation with Natasha, swoops in, looping her arm through Tony’s, and steers him out of the room and farther into the apartment without a glance in Steve’s direction, leaving just him and Natasha in the kitchen. He glances at her, about to say he’ll see her around, and blinks at the way she’s watching him, face its usual blank mask, but somehow managing to give off more Don’t Mess With Me vibes than usual.
“Steve,” Tony starts, stops, tries to remember why he’s here, while Steve’s expression shifts slowly into a scowl at the interruption. Not a great beginning. “There are clothes for you for the interview tomorrow,” he says at last, when no better opening presents itself.
“Careful with this one,” Fury says, looks back up at Steve. “I haven’t worked this hard to keep him up and running to watch him go down over this. And his father would never forgive either of us if you broke him now and I hadn’t done anything to prevent it.”
“Mr. Stark here is all set,” the girl with Tony says, “so Dan and I can get out of your way, give you two a minute alone.”
Tony huffs, but waves a hand for Jarvis to put the call through. The blueprints Tony’d had up slide to one side, replaced by a video screen with Pepper’s face, already scowling.
Tony blinks. That’s really not what he was expecting. “I’m glad?” it comes out as more of a question than Tony meant.
of you, now, to make this work, and just because he’s Captain America doesn’t mean he’s infallible. So let me know if you need me, okay?”
Tony’s face is trying to do something, but he’s not quite sure what. He’s not sure it knows, either, and it’s still tingling a little, but at least he can feel it. “You just told me Hydra killed my parents – that your now missing, previously presumed-dead best friend probably killed them – and I just had a panic attack on the floor of the house that belongs to a family I didn’t know existed, where we’re hiding from a genocidal robot I accidentally brought to life while trying to save the world. I’ve been better.”
Two days pass after the wedding before Steve sees Tony again. He wonders a few times if Tony’s avoiding him, but Steve can also admit he’s maybe avoiding Tony, so it’s hard to tell. The wedding itself was a bit of a blur, the reception even more so. The only really clear memories Steve has are of kissing Tony after their I do’s – which just made him think of that first time, in the park, and he’s not sure if he’s pleased or put out that Tony’s reputation has clearly been well-earned – and of dancing together at the reception, apologizing for stepping on Tony’s toes which only made Tony laugh, and trying not to squint through all of the camera flashes. The five million pictures that appeared in every print publication and all over the internet the next day make it look like he had a pretty good time, though, so he guesses that’s something. He’s still not sure who half the people were, or how Ms. Potts and Coulson had gotten them there without news of the event leaking ahead of time.
In spite of Pepper playing time-keeper, Steve’s already there, easy to spot the moment Tony clears the entryway, even sitting in the back, in a quiet, not-quite-secluded corner of the restaurant. He sees Tony a moment later and rises, takes an aborted half-step forward, like he’s going to pull Tony’s chair out and thinks better of it, and ends up standing almost at parade rest while he waits.
Then there’s the sound of inarticulate hollering coming both over the comms and through the air, and pigeons scatter as Tony comes barreling in, the suit like a battering ram, repulsors blazing.
apartment unless the whole team is involved, and now he’s there, in their common living spaces, every time Tony is. Mostly, though, it’s just… pleasant.
Tony grins again, and keeps grinning as he blasts another rat. “What do you see, Widow?” he asks, watches as Steve neatly vaults in through the open car doors to join Natasha.
Steve shrugs. “I don’t, usually. I have to be pretty relaxed to hit that point. Dr. Erskine warned me about my body needing less sleep, and the SHIELD doctors said something about adrenaline levels that I didn’t quite follow when they were running tests back when I first woke up.” He shrugs again, a little self-consciously this time. “The general consensus seemed to be it had more to do with comfort levels than exhaustion, but it does usually mean a good night’s sleep, whatever the science jargon comes out to.”
“Or you could just let things go,” Steve points out, and he’s half-joking, wondering where Tony will take this next, but Tony stiffens, almost imperceptibly, and the smile seems a little more frozen on his face.
“For a given definition of ‘eaten’.” Jarvis somehow manages to sound bland and long-suffering at the same time. “Sir had a smoothie at approximately half-four this morning.”
“Good. Jarvis, if you could send me the names of whoever it was trying to contact Tony, I’d appreciate it. We’ll have words.” Her smile reminds Steve a little bit of Peggy when she was preparing to make someone feel like an idiot. It’s oddly comforting.
Tony blinks, and then his grin settles into something almost fully natural. “Would you prefer ‘Sweetcheeks’?” he asks, tone innocent.
It’s soft, and sweet, and Tony’s not sure he’s ever been kissed like this. It’s a little awkward, both of them leaning in, sitting on the floor, legs jammed uncomfortably, but Steve’s got both hands framing Tony’s face now, tilting his head to a better angle, and Tony’s got one hand sliding across Steve’s shoulder and up his neck into his hair, feeling him shiver, while he braces the other on Steve’s hip, over the pajama pants borrowed from sources unknown. The thought makes Tony laugh a little into the kiss.
Ms. Potts does something with her phone. “I got it. Thank you.” She looks up at Clint and Natasha, who are still eating by the counter. “Why don’t you two sit, and we can get started?” She pulls up a seat for herself next to Steve while Clint and Natasha array themselves opposite. “Tony?”
And then they’re in the event hall. Tony will remember afterwards that it really looks like a wedding, with flowers and fancy chairs and everyone dressed to the nines. There’s music playing from somewhere, and Rhodey and Barton and the officiant are all standing at the end of the aisle, under some sort of decorative arch. The only thing he really sees in the moment, though, is Steve, standing next to Barton, and watching Tony.
“Maybe let her know we’re not donating anything else of Steve’s? And the cleaners should be notified, so they don’t send his things directly to Maria’s along with mine.”
“Captain Rogers has not yet been to his private apartment,” Jarvis replies. “Nor has he enquired about it. My understanding is that he is meant to live in the penthouse with you for the duration of your marriage?” the end comes out as a question.
“I know. I know.” Tony heaves a put upon sigh. “We both made the mistake of bitching each other out in public, so we both get to pay the price. Poetic justice, you think?”
“Tony wouldn’t thank me for it,” Ms. Potts continues, still watching Steve like she’s not sure what he’s going to do, “but you need to know that he’s breakable.”
“A menace to society,” Steve agrees sadly, hanging his head in shame. It doesn’t do much to hide the wicked glint in his eyes, or the way his mouth keeps trying to twitch back into a grin. “I’ve been told.”
Dummy’s claw closes delicately around Steve’s hand and he shakes it up and down, before whistling brightly and tugging Steve towards the far end of the workshop, where there’s a row of brightly colored sports cars. A pair of legs in what were very nice slacks only a few hours ago stick out from under the third car from the end. Dummy lets go of Steve’s hand, clicks his pincers, and rolls off, somehow managing to move with dignified purpose.
It’s another couple innings before the paparazzi find them. Tony’s mostly surprised it took that long, gave up on questioning
Steve glances at Tony, but the other man is watching Ms. Potts, munching steadily on the bagel in his hand, seemingly unperturbed.
“That I was not to enlighten Captain Rogers as to your genuine regard for his person,” Jarvis says, only a little stiffly.
There’s a brief moment of silence that makes Steve feel, not for the first time, as though Jarvis is judging him, and finding him wanting.
Steve feels himself smile in response, and they stand like that for several long seconds, until someone coughs. Steve feels himself flush, and he pulls away hastily.
It’s flattering, more than flattering, the way Steve won’t let go, doesn’t stop kissing him all the way up to their floor, and even then can’t seem to pry himself away long enough to get from the elevator to Tony’s room, keeps reeling him back in to kiss him again every time Tony steps back, pushes him against the wall halfway there.
, which just isn’t fair. “We’re married, Tony,” he points out. “And we’ve been necking in front of every camera we’ve seen for months, now. I’m pretty sure anyone who is concerned about you ‘besmirching a national icon’ –” and he actually has the gall to use his free hand to put finger quotes around the words, Tony bets Barton taught him that “– thinks it’s already happened.”
The agents follow Steve inside and up the stairs to his apartment, waiting politely as he jiggles the key a little in the lock before it turns. He doubts any of the locks in Stark Tower need any extra coaxing to open, can’t even remember seeing any actual locks the few times he’s been there, everything just slid open automatically.
“That’s it,” Tony wraps an arm firmly around her waist. “You’ll be more comfortable if you’re holding your own wrist, so you’re not trying to get a grip on the armor, but I’ve got you locked, so you don’t need to hang on at all, if you don’t want to.” He looks up to see Steve watching them. “Any advice from the pro?” he asks, because he’s flown with Steve more often than anyone else at this point, and Steve looks like he wants to say something.
Something breaks inside Tony’s chest at the same time he feels something else release. He grabs Steve’s hand out of the air with both of his, and Steve’s sharp inhalation is loud in the stillness. “I’m here,” he says, opens Steve’s fingers from the fist he’s made to press his palm hard against the center of his chest, right over the arc reactor hidden under his clothes. “I’m real. I’m solid. We both are. Feel it?”
Tony looks away, picks up a spare strip of metal off his desk to have something to do with his hands. “I haven’t actually seen him since the pigeon thing in Central Park,” he admits. “I thought I was – it doesn’t matter. He yelled, I yelled, it was a whole big yelling thing. Rhodey came in before it got nasty.”
“Charming is also acceptable,” Pepper allows, and Tony has to actually turn around to scowl at her. She smiles blithely back. “Everything’s going well. The wedding photos were a huge hit. You’ve been trending on Twitter since Monday.”
Tony rolls his eyes. “You’d figure out a way around it, if you really wanted to. Go ahead with your suggestion.”
Steve gets the shield up just in time to deflect a repulsor beam away before it scores him. He opens his mouth to curse Tony out, because
Back at street level, SHIELD agents have set up a perimeter, keeping the civilians away from the grates the alligators had been trying to get out of. Tony peers around, trying to figure out where the media vultures are congregating while the other three hand off their night vision goggles for cleaning. Spotting the press holding area, Tony heads in their direction.
“It seems like the best option,” Steve nods, flush fading a little, but face serious enough that Tony doesn’t even suggest he might be joking.
“Stark’s a good guy,” Coulson says, as if that might be a concern. “Brash and reckless, but good. You know that.”
“I missed you.” For a minute, Tony doesn’t realize he’s the one who said it, but Steve’s stopped walking, and has turned to stare at him, eyes wide and dark in the shadows around them. May as well go for it, he thinks. It’s probably truer than anything else he could say. “While I was gone, when we thought we were done. I thought about you, and I missed you. But I missed you before that. When you were gone. I didn’t know how to tell you. And that stupid phone –”
“We could tell them we’re getting married,” Steve says, realizing as the words come out that he’s not just thinking it, and that. That was not something he’d actually meant to vocalize.
The crash of the gauntlet hitting the ground makes them both jerk back. Tony slams into the table again, and swears.
Pepper sighs again, then clears her throat and straightens her shoulders. “Go shower,” she says, stern again. “Put on clean clothes. Go to dinner. Hold hands with your fiancé. Try not to kill each other. Captain Rogers will meet you at the restaurant, but you are to come home together. Several someones will take pictures of you inside on their phones and upload them to the internet, so look cozy, but no need to overdo it. Paparazzi will be outside waiting for you when you leave, so look like you’re pretending to be casual. If you can get caught by the press letting go of each other as you walk out the door that would be ideal, but the timing might be tricky, and there are a lot of factors with that sort of thing.”
“Hey, Jarvis. What’ve you got for me?” Tony watches the elevator doors close and leans against the wall as he is carried upwards.
“She’s used to cleaning up Stark’s messes,” Fury reminds him, which is both as unhelpful as everything else he’s said since he sat down and unflattering to boot.
“No,” Steve shakes his head. “Bucky and I went to games sometimes, when we could, but he liked it more than I did. He stepped out for a while with a girl who played, and liked to go with her. Must’ve been in ’38 or ’39. I don’t remember why she was down here, but she went back to Canada eventually, and that was that. Bucky moped for weeks.” Steve looks a little sad, himself. He’s been talking more about people he remembers, seems to be finding it easier, and Tony’s happy to listen, likes learning the ins and outs of anything Steve will tell him, but sometimes Steve’s face makes his chest hurt in ways he can’t quite blame on the reactor.
This is one of those moments, Tony thinks, that he’s glad he’s been trained to having cameras in his face since he was old enough to talk, because he’s pretty sure his expression doesn’t change at all, in spite of the chaos raging in his head, or the way it feels like something large is tap-dancing behind his belly button. Steve, utterly unflappable in uniform, still seems to be having trouble adjusting to the more intrusive questions he gets as Steve Rogers, and although he’s certainly better than he was five months ago, he’s currently looking a bit like someone hit him in the face with a Ferrari.
“People aren’t usually this interested in me,” Steve tries to explain, and it’s true, most of the Avengers fade into the background when the press comes calling. Tony’s always the one front and center, even if they’re all attending an event like this. Steve is just starting to get a taste of what it’s really like, and it’s already making his head spin. He should maybe be a bit less quick to jump on Tony for slacking when he shows up late to clean up or debrief because he’s been handling the reporters.
Steve stiffens a little and frowns, then remembers that Thor hadn’t actually been present for either the initial meeting that had landed them in this mess, or the planning sessions they’d had afterwards. “I had thought someone would have told you, but this isn’t a real marriage,” Steve explains. “There have been issues with public approval, and Tony and I. Well. We haven’t always been the best at keeping our disagreements in our own kitchen.”
“That is DUM-E,” Jarvis’s voice is pitched to carry under the music. “He is unused to strangers in Sir’s private space.”
Steve tries on as vague a smile as he can manage, and nods, hoping he’s not agreeing to anything outrageous. He’s thought more than once that Tony’s testing him, or making fun of him, but lately he’s wondered if that’s just him being paranoid.
Tony sidles along the counter. “Sounds like a plan. Have a good night. Let Jarvis know if you need anything.”
“Perhaps the overhead lighting would be preferable?” Jarvis inquires. “Or natural lighting from the windows? Sir believed you would appreciate the curtains he had installed, however, if you are so inclined, the opacity of the glass may be adjusted to suit your needs.”
“Because you’re so good at just letting things go,” Tony says, something much sharper in his words now, and it hits Steve in a way he hadn’t been expecting, hard, right in the chest.
Rhodey heaves a very put-upon sounding sigh. “Give me that.” He turns Tony around by the shoulders and takes the strip of demon cloth from Tony’s hands.
Steve blinks. “You’re welcome,” he says automatically, isn’t quite sure what to make of anything right now.
It feels a little like he’s taking advantage, but this whole thing has felt a little like he’s taking advantage, and Tony just. He’s
Fury’s mouth twists into something that might be a frown. “Not that I doubt the impressive abilities of Ms. Potts, but smoothing over your dumbass drunken mishaps is different from convincing the country that Cap here doesn’t want you burned at the stake, or whatever bull they’re all spouting at the moment.”
“I’m going to start actually killing these things,” Tony sounds like he’s speaking through gritted teeth.
“I know,” Tony tells him, firm as he can. He opens his eyes. From this close, he can see every one of Steve’s eyelashes, fanned against his cheeks. He tips his chin, presses a light, chaste kiss to Steve’s lips. “If we do this right tomorrow, if this works, afterwards, we will sit and figure this,” he gives a little tug to Steve’s hair, “out. But if it doesn’t –” he hates even saying it, they’ve all been pointedly not allowing the possibility of disaster. Further disaster. He swallows. “If it doesn’t, no more regrets.”
“Clint said he’d be my best man,” he tells Thor, almost absurdly grateful for the fact now, though he’d been a little underwhelmed when Clint had initially called
“Go,” Pepper gives Tony a little shove. “Save him. Save you. Get out of here. Smile nice for the cameras outside.”
“Jesus Christ, Tony.” Steve’s hand slides down Tony’s spine, comes to rest where the dip of his waist hits the swell of his ass, and Tony shivers, thinks about pushing back into the touch, but twists back around instead. Steve’s eyes go dark as he tracks Tony’s movement, only the tiniest sliver of blue still visible around blown pupils.
Tony twitches, the movement only noticeable because Steve is still mostly pressed against him, but the smile he turns on Steve looks almost real, and that throws Steve more off balance than if Tony had pushed him away. “No promises,” Tony replies, the corners of his eyes crinkling as his smile grows.
Briefly, Tony contemplates just staying in the shower. But Pepper has proved more than once that something as minor as Tony’s nudity will not keep her from doing her job, and he’s not really up to fighting with her sans pants, right now.
“Rhodey agreed to come along and play extra air support,” Tony announces breezily as they all troop onto the jet and Natasha heads for the pilot seat to take them up and out.
Steve snorts, can’t help it. “To show off,” he mutters, then, before Rhodes can say anything else, “Thank you for your assistance this morning. I know you’ve decided not to join the team, but we all appreciate the extra hand.”
That’s only slightly disconcerting, Steve thinks, wonders what else Jarvis controls. He’s about to ask when Tony appears from the direction of the bedrooms. He looks a little surprised to see all of them in his kitchen, but he doesn’t say anything, just heads for the coffee machine, grabbing a mug on his way.
“See you out there,” Steve says, soft, over his shoulder, and then Tony watches him walk through the doorway. He can’t help the way his gaze skims down Steve’s shoulders and back, sticking for a second on his ass, and down his legs, then back up right before the door swings shut.
“Even not flaunting it in front of the press?” Clint persists. He glances at Tony, then at Ms. Potts. “He doesn’t really do subtle.”
“Voice recognition: Captain Steven Grant Rogers,” Jarvis says, then repeats, slightly slower this time, “Please enter access code, Captain.”
(who were mostly just hoping to get photographs and autographs instead of clearing out, like they were supposed to) when they got above ground after they left the tunnels, and then again when they’d arrived at HQ for the debrief. All he really wants to do is go back to his apartment and curl up with a book or a sketchpad for the rest of the evening. He has to remind himself he doesn’t have an apartment, anymore. And he can’t even go shut himself up in his room, because he and Tony have to go out and pretend they’re in love so everyone can gawk at them. It all makes him want to hit something.
Steve meets him in the hallway. “Jarvis says giant rats?” he’s unbuttoning his shirt while he walks, and it’s more of an act of willpower than it should be not to look.
“Captain!” the boom of Thor’s voice almost makes Steve jump, and he twists to see the other man standing in the doorway behind him.
Steve turns automatically, but he has no idea who Tony might be talking about, realizes after a minute that there probably isn’t anyone.
“And I still think there must be another way,” Rhodey says for what must be the millionth time now. “Marriage or leaving the team aren’t your only options.”
“Tony,” Steve sounds relieved. He pulls away a little, sitting back on his heels, and Tony realizes he had been crouched on the floor, leaning over him. Which is a little odd, because Tony’s pretty sure he had been standing just a moment before, and now he’s sitting on the floor, with no recollection of how he got there.
The way Natasha has been looking secretly pleased every time Steve tosses an arm around Tony’s shoulders on the couch when they’re watching movies, or when she sees Steve following Tony down to the workshop, makes Tony a little uneasy, and the speculative looks he’s gotten from Coulson and Barton have him wondering if there’s some kind of SHIELD betting pool that Steve’s in on, but no one bothered to mention to Tony. He’s not exactly sure what they’d be betting
“Bleeds off the poison,” Tony explains, and Steve can’t tell if he’s being serious or not. “Gets it off your chest, so you’re not just holding it all in and stewing.”
“Goodnight, Tony.” Steve leans down to kiss Tony’s cheek on his way by. He makes it halfway back to his room before he stops dead, and replays the moment in his head.
“Sorry, Captain,” Jarvis’s voice seems like it’s coming from everywhere and nowhere at the same time, even though Steve
There’s a silence that’s a little too long to be anything but judgey before Jarvis responds, “Of course, sir.”
Dan and the girl shut the door behind them, and Steve’s already rounding on Tony the moment the latch clicks.
They’ve been spending more time together, it’s true, but not nearly so much that Steve couldn’t be going out with someone under the radar. That could be another reason he’s gotten more tactile, to make sure no one goes looking in another direction. Natasha was probably very thorough when she briefed him on the necessity for a non-disclosure agreement, and Steve’s just the kind of guy who would take it a step further, to make doubly sure he was still seen as the good Boy Scout he is, and to prevent any extra cameras from being thrust in his face.
“No,” she hands another pen to Steve. “The places you need to sign are all marked,” she tells him. “Do you need us to go over anything?”
Eventually, Steve brings two steaming mugs over to the table and sets one down in front of Tony, nudging the now-cold coffee mug out of the way. “Here,” he says. “It’s a lavender chamomile with honey.”
“There’s a lot you don’t know,” Fury tells him, but it doesn’t sound like an answer. “Nice drawing.” Fury taps the sketchbook.
“He managed to keep McPherson a secret for a decade and a half,” Natasha points out. She sounds vaguely put out about it, like it was a personal offense.
“Happy’s bringing the car around,” he says when they reach the short hallway at the bottom, leans against the wall by the emergency exit door, tapping something out on his phone. “Pepper’s texting us a handful of restaurants nearby to choose from – what are you in the mood for? Sushi? Steak? Shish kabobs?”
There’s an amused snort over the line that could be anyone, but Tony’s not paying attention, because, “They’re coming from
“Of course, sir.” The server flips one of the appropriate glasses over and pours a sample for Tony, who automatically tries it and waves for the man to continue. He recites the specials as he pours, provides them with menus, and vanishes as silently as he arrived.
Colonel Rhodes is waiting in the hangar with Tony and Banner. Thor comes in on Steve’s heels, and Natasha and Clint are only a minute behind.
Steve’s smile widens into something a little more pleased. “Good.” He reaches across to where Tony’s hand is resting on the seat and squeezes gently. “Happy five month anniversary.”
It doesn’t work. Tony can feel the frantic pace of his heart under the vibration of the reactor, even as he almost chokes on every other erratic breath. He can’t seem to steady either.
“You can ride on the back,” he hears Steve offer, and the sound of Barton’s grumbling follows Tony and Natasha up into the air.
“What’s this about?” Tony asks when Pepper doesn’t immediately say anything, just clicks her nails unconsciously against her clipboard.
“Agent Coulson was very specific,” Agent Godfrey tells him, and then moves off to start wrapping plates Steve doesn’t even remember buying.
For several long minutes they stay like that, Steve collapsed mostly on top of Tony’s chest, nose pressed to the side of Tony’s face, breathing heavily.
Banner looks up from whatever he’s discussing with Natasha and sees Steve standing in the doorway. “Morning, Cap. Good run?”
Fury eyes him speculatively for a minute, then leans his elbows on the table. “This isn’t going to be easy,” he says, and it’s not soft, Steve’s not sure Fury knows how to speak softly, but it is quiet, a low rumble of words. “What you’re doing with Stark,” he clarifies, “it’s not going to be easy. But it’s what we’ve got.”
Tony grins involuntarily, and slides into the seat next to her. When he looks away he finds Rogers watching them, a small frown creasing his forehead. “Problem?” he asks, raising an eyebrow, and Rogers starts, like he hadn’t even realized he was staring.
“May I suggest you speak only when prompted, sir?” Jarvis interjects. “I believe your usual ‘anything else’ might not be appropriate for your wedding ceremony.”
Tony gives her a look he hopes conveys how absurd that is. When she just continues to watch him, he shakes his head. “I’m not fifteen, Pep. I don’t need impossible daydreams to get me through.”
“– find a way to spin this,” Fury is saying, and Steve realizes the conversation has continued without him. “If we’re convincing enough, this whole thing ought to blow over, and we can go back to dealing with
Steve isn’t by the bar anymore, and Tony’s heart drops, thinking maybe he’s actually gone home with the woman he’d been with before, but then he spots him not too far from the door to the terrace, smiling politely at several young socialites who have clearly decided to try to adopt him.
“These are actually fairly average sized for alligators,” Natasha remarks, and Tony turns to give Steve a smug look before remembering he’s got the facemask down.
Natasha drapes her towel over the bench, and starts in on her hair with a comb, but she’s watching Steve. “Is it a bad thing that the Tower is feeling more like home?” she asks after several minutes.
“I’m not the one living in the building with the sentient elevators,” Steve points out, following, and then bites the inside of his cheek when he remembers that’s not true anymore.
There’s a brief rush of air between them as Steve pulls back, the rip of the condom wrapper, and Tony slits his eyes open, watches Steve’s face as he lines up and pushes in. Tony thinks maybe Steve was right not to listen when he said he was ready the first time, thinks,
“The news of your engagement has leaked,” Pepper continues, comes to stand close enough that Tony is forced to turn to look at her again. “The photos of you and Captain Rogers making out in the park went viral –”
The look on Rhodes’s face is a little odd, and Steve doesn’t know him well enough to hazard a guess at what it might mean. “This is about par for the course with people he likes,” he says eventually. “You just need to remember he usually does things for a reason.”
Twice, Tony has wandered into the living room late in the evening to find Steve watching movies on low volume, and wound up watching with him. They barely talked either time, even after the films ended, but Tony doesn’t think the silence was pointed.
building weapons again, and what the relationship is between this body armor and the Iron Man armor.”
Tony bites back a retort. It’s such bullshit. Of all the things he knew he was giving up with this – his privacy, his sanity, his sex life – he hadn’t considered this, that he wouldn’t be allowed to relax with an old friend.
“Captain Rogers,” Ms. Potts smiles, but it looks like Tony’s paparazzi smile. “All well on your,” she twiddles the fingers of the hand not holding her tablet in the air, “SHIELD thing?”
“Right,” Tony says again. “Okay. Well.” He’s out. He glances at the coffee pot, which is finally full. “I should,” he gestures in the direction of the coffee.
It lasts forever and no time at all. They part to breathe, but don’t separate more than a few inches, foreheads together, breathing the same air.
Steve eyes him for a minute, gaze sweeping up and down the suit as though looking for a handhold, then does as he’s told, looping an arm across Tony’s shoulders, and gripping tight at the curve, slinging his other arm around the front and catching his own wrist to close the circuit. “Good?” he asks. His face is so close, Tony can almost feel his breath misting across the metal of the faceplate.
“It wasn’t her secret to tell.” Tony had been more than a little surprised by the whole thing, a little pissed he didn’t know, maybe a little hurt, but he’s had time to think about it, now, and he understands.
“This is all a little unconventional,” Tony says as they settle, waves a hand that seems to encompass everything, the chairs, the audience, the cameras. Steve’s not entirely sure what he means, it looks a lot like all of the other sets they’ve been on recently, and the handful he’d been on before that, in the year since the Chitauri invasion, before everything with him and Tony blew up.
“Rather than simply cancelling the donations of Captain Rogers’s formalwear, perhaps it might be beneficial to discuss the nature of the situation with him. He might be more amenable were his permission sought in advance, and an explanation given.”
Now he knows, at least, that Steve hasn’t been messing around on him. It sounds foolish even in his own head. There isn’t anything to mess around on, that was the whole point of the NDA. Not only has Steve not been indulging the uses of an NDA, though, he hadn’t even known it was an option, and Tony would swear he remembers Natasha saying she’d handle it and the rest of the paperwork, back when she and Pepper had been sorting out the pre-nup.
Tony thinks about moving, about sitting up again and trying to watch the end of the movie, or about getting off the couch and going to sleep in his bed, but it seems like too much effort. He’s tired, and Steve’s warm against him, and it’s somehow comfortable having Natasha’s legs on top of his. Figuring they’ll wake him when the movie is done, or if they’re uncomfortable, Tony closes his eyes again, and slips back into sleep.
There’s another pause. “I don’t understand,” Jarvis says. “I was given to believe your regard for the Captain was genuine.”
Rhodey huffs out a breath, and crosses the space between them, puts his hands on Tony’s shoulders. “I mean it, Tony. I am here for you. And if he can’t be bothered to at least try, I will come right back out here, and kick his ass.”
“Don’t,” Steve warns, still feeling on edge, and, because Tony is apparently in an obliging mood, he just grins a little wider and doesn’t say anything else until they hit ground level.
“Yes, of course,” Steve nods, sees the out for what it is, notes how naturally Tony pulled it off, wonders what he would have done if Steve had done more than just tense up. “Scotch on the rocks?”
Steve doesn’t even really have to think about it, just nods as she comes back into view. “That would be great. It’d be nice to be doing something useful.”
Natasha appears around the half wall that had been the compromise when she’d refused to either use the women’s locker room on the lower level by the regular gym, or accept her own private locker room next door, insisting that just because she was female didn’t mean she had to be separated from her team. Clint had been the only one to protest, on the grounds that she always stole his razor, but had caved when Tony had made them both matching razors with some sort of special spring to make the swivel better. Steve’s pretty sure Natasha has still been stealing Clint’s, just on principle, but the things are somehow self-sharpening, and Steve doesn’t want to get in the middle of that. Steve is also pretty sure Tony’s company started reproducing the razors – minus the self-sharpening part, since, according to Tony, that’s nanobot technology and “the market is not ready for that jelly” – and selling them to the hairy masses.
“What do you want?” Steve’s voice is rough, ragged already, and his fingers are tracing patterns over Tony’s skin – hips, sides, across his stomach – like they have a mind of their own.
For several long minutes, neither of them says anything else while the coffee machine gurgles and the kettle starts to hiss.
“Mm,” Pepper hums in agreement, focus shifting for a moment off to one side in response to the soft chime of an alert. “I have to go – I have a meeting in a few minutes – but I thought you’d like to know that I also got a call from the manager at Maria’s this morning. The suits you and Captain Rogers wore for the premier last week both sold in time to make the mid-month donation. She said the directors of two of the shelters have already called personally to say thank you. It sounds like it meant a lot to a lot of people to have some extra funding for Valentine’s Day, if you want to pass that on. Maybe soften the blow when you tell him about the wardrobe bans.”
call-out. Not that Steve wants anything to happen that’s bad enough to need the Avengers, but he also really doesn’t want to stay at this thing, charity or not.
And Steve. Steve can’t do this. Tony’s got the beginnings of what looks like a truly magnificent black eye, and a trace of blood running down from a cut across his cheekbone, and Steve doesn’t even know how these things happen when the man is wrapped in metal from head to foot, but he just. Can’t do this. “You couldn’t just stay where you were goddamned told?”
. You might think you’ve got nothing besides being a soldier, right now, being Captain America, but you’ll figure it out. You’ve got friends and people who want to care about you if you’d just let them, and your whole damn life ahead of you, and you can do anything you want. But none of it will mean a damn thing if whatever I saw up there comes and we’re not ready for it. Bruce got it. He might not always like it,
“I can see that,” Tony gets out, and he can feel the laughter bubbling up in his chest, can see Steve making a valiant effort to contain his own smug amusement.
Instead of going directly into the hall, Pepper steers them into the staging room next door. Steve, Barton, and a woman Tony doesn’t know – but assumes is there to perform the ceremony – are waiting inside.
“You said I haven’t seen your dark side,” Tony reminds him, “and maybe it’s not my right to. But if you expect us – your
“It was an idealistic thing,” Steve explains, still clearly trying to sound serious. “Intellectual abilities and control over irrationality and animalistic impulses.”
“Not sure anyone else wants those details,” he says, gives a very obvious wink, and Steve is abruptly aware that Tony’s hand is still on his thigh, warm through the thin material of his slacks. It gives him a very intense sense memory of the way Tony had kissed him before dinner, palm cupped around the back of his neck to draw him down, and again afterwards, when they had to run the gauntlet of press outside the restaurant.
she’s behaving like someone who wants to get back together with her ex, but it’s not like he has a lot of experience in that arena. The thought makes something knot uncomfortably in the pit of his stomach. He’s not sure if it’s his business.
“I haven’t really talked to him since the wedding,” Tony mumbles, starts fiddling with the bit of metal again.
Steve’s fingers itch to check Tony’s skull for damage, but he’s pretty sure that wouldn’t go over so well. He stands up and puts his hands in his pockets. “We have a dinner reservation at eight,” he says. “We’re meant to be photographed, I believe.”
Together, they head out of the conference room, and Steve lets Tony lead them past the main bank of elevators to a hall at the back of the building, and through a door marked “Maintenance.”
“Everything’s moving along well,” Coulson continues. “The wedding seems to be in hand. We’re scheduled for Sunday afternoon. Colonel Rhodes has been granted personal leave time, but won’t be able to get here until Saturday night. In the meantime, we’re going to continue the subtle approach, and let the public do the work of putting everything together.”
Something clenches in Steve’s stomach at the look on Tony’s face. It’s not something he’s ever seen there before, even on other nights they’ve run into each other post-nightmare. This isn’t the last vestiges of panic, or the need to fix something, or prevent something from happening. It’s loss tinged with guilt and the inability to get away from what should be over and done. Steve knows that look.
Without intending to, Steve tightens his arm a little further, tries not to cough at the face full of perfume he gets as the woman leans up to kiss the air by his cheek before doing the same to Tony.
“Look,” he says, quieter now. “I can’t imagine what you’ve been going through, but not a single one of us is judging you for having a hard time. Being in a war zone is enough to mess anyone up, without almost dying and waking up in the future. We all know that. But you have to understand that we are all dealing with our own lives, our own losses, and you don’t get to decide what information deserves to be kept secret, just for you, and what everyone else has to share with you. It doesn’t work that way. If it’s about you, if it’s to do with you, then you have every right to want to know about it, but what Bruce and I were trying to accomplish – what we
“Yes,” Tony nods, and he’s still watching Steve like he’s not quite sure what to do in this situation – which must be a first, Steve thinks, maybe a little uncharitably – but is game to give it a go. “She gave the PR team a statement, it should be going out around now.”
“No more flying fatalities,” Tony quips, and Steve has to suppress the urge to throw his shield at him. He’s not sure why he thought anything was going to change.
Tony manages not to bury his face in his hands, realizes only Jarvis can see, and gives in to the urge. “This is a bad idea,” he tells his palms.
anything, and Steve’s somehow all up in arms about it. It has been a while – which in and of itself is pretty amazing, especially given how much time they’ve been spending together lately – so maybe they’re due. Maybe it’s just built up pressure. But Tony finally tunes in to Steve snarling something about showing off again, and his own irritation with everything starts to boil.
Tony scoffs. “Is that what I know? You looked like you were going down, I came in to help. Maybe instead of shoving that stick farther up your ass, you could say thank you.”
The eye roll is clear in Steve’s voice, but all he says is, “When we’ve got everyone out, you and I are going in.”
“We all had trouble sleeping sometimes,” Steve continues, and it’s easier than he thought it would be, to talk about the Commandos. “And sometimes it wasn’t safe for us all to sleep. So we’d keep each other up, or just pass the time. It was a good way not to think about other things. Where we were, what we were doing, what we still needed to do. We were better off than a lot of units, but we had our share of being cold, wet, and hungry.”
“Let’s walk,” Steve says impulsively, feeling a little foolish, but also a little like he might scream if he has to go sit inside somewhere and be surrounded by people. “I know we have to – go on a date,” the words feel decidedly odd in his mouth, but that’s his life now, he supposes, so he’ll just have to get used to them, “but can we just.” He doesn’t want to say
“Ms. Potts,” Rogers is part way around the table, standing awkwardly, like he’d jumped to his feet when they’d walked in. Tony wishes he’d been paying attention to have seen that.
“You want me to come downstairs to your workshop and just. Talk to you?” Steve asks, wonders if he missed something important, or just Tony’s tendency to ramble when he’s uncomfortable.
“Drop me on the roof of that car,” Barton points to one of the middle cars. “I’ll try to clear some space from there.”
“Your… you,” Tony gestures at Steve, trying to encompass his Steve-ness. He’s probably not particularly successful. “You look like your old propaganda posters, minus the stars and stripes.”
“Don’t,” Tony stops her, and this is more important than any justified but ultimately useless argument he was going to try to make. “Don’t do that. It wasn’t working. And this has nothing to do with us. I’m just glad we figured ourselves out early enough that you weren’t dragged into everything with –” he cuts himself off, doesn’t want to finish that thought. “That you won’t be dragged into this,” he says instead. “Any more than you have to be, anyway.” He offers a wry smile.
Steve goes through the forms quickly, signing where instructed, then passes the lot over to Tony to do the same.
“That’s already gone,” Tony says, thinks maybe this at least will be okay, Steve approves of charity.
Tony doesn’t need to look. He’s seen all of them, had spent half the night looking at pictures and reading comments before he managed to fall asleep, and he’s well aware of the image he and Steve presented, had known when he’d pressed back into Steve’s space what it would look like to anyone watching, taking pictures.
not to leave sweatmarks,” Tony hears Barton say as he retreats down the hallway, followed by a muffled thump and a curse. He rolls his eyes again, even though there’s no one to see this time, and pointedly does not slam his bedroom door.
. I’ve already wasted enough time hunting your Americano-drinking ass down.” He gives Steve another significant sort of look, turns away, then back again. “Oh, and Cap?”
Happy’s waiting with the car by the time they make it outside, and Tony slides into the backseat with a feeling of mixed relief and disappointment. He’s glad for the clean getaway, but he’d actually been really enjoying himself, what with the novelty of being outside for something fun, the hotdogs and overpriced cheap beer, the excited kids, and Steve almost fully relaxed for once, one with the yelling crowd. It had been a completely different experience from the stuffy boxes full of board members and potential business associates that Tony’s been used to at sporting events.
He nods, anyway, because Steve’s watching him, waiting for a response, lets his legs fall open, lets Steve make himself at home between them. He wants to watch, wants to seal this safe in his memory, but he can’t quite take the visual on top of the physical sensations, wants this to last.
“That’s.” Underhanded, maybe. Evil, certainly. “Fair,” Tony goes with, because it’s that, too. He’s a little bit dreading it, but the slightly masochistic part of him is also looking forward to seeing that ass in whatever Pepper’s cooked up. The woman does have an eye for that sort of thing. The suits she’s had Steve in these last couple weeks have looked unfairly good on him, to the point where Tony’s pretty sure he hasn’t dreamt this regularly about a person he wasn’t sleeping with since his MIT days.
Steve ducks back into the train car. “Widow and I are going to go over this car, see if we can find something. Iron Man, Hawkeye, run another sweep of the tunnel.”
“I shall make a note for Ms. Potts,” Jarvis’s voice is particularly dry. “Minced superhero insurance.”
“You have been granted clearance to any level,” Jarvis says crisply, which could be a yes, Steve thinks, though Jarvis’s voice sounds almost. Disapproving? He’s not sure a computer can be disapproving. The doors swish open again and Steve steps inside. They snap closed right on his heels, and the elevator drops, Steve’s stomach jumping with the descent, before coming to an abrupt halt. He’s pretty sure the trip up hadn’t been quite so swift, but given the way Tony flies, he’s not particularly surprised he’d design an elevator that plummets like a carnival ride.
“I do deserve congratulations, don’t I,” Tony says airily, squeezes Steve a little tighter, somehow making it a show while feeling more comforting, grounding. “Landing Captain America is the coup of the century. Speaking of,” and he turns more fully into Steve, “get me another drink, Apple Jack? Pretty please?” Tony bats his eyelashes outrageously.
Pepper’s eyes crinkle just a bit at the corner with a hidden grin, and Tony suppresses a sigh. Good thing he’s not used to a quiet life.
Pepper shows up in the lab to summon Tony back to the conference room. Not that Tony doesn’t appreciate the soothing balm of her presence, but it’s a rather underhanded trick, sending her in. He would have shown up on his own. Probably. If he’d remembered. As it is,
Tony doesn’t pretend to misunderstand. “I don’t know,” he says honestly. “It feels,” he gropes for the right word, “natural? Not – weird?”
Natasha asks, “Iron Man, a lift?” at the same time as Bruce points out, “There is no shotgun on Cap’s bike.”
“Takeout,” Tony says again, releases his handful of Steve’s jacket and carefully smooths it back against Steve’s chest.
“Don’t worry,” Coulson says from behind him, and Steve turns back at the door. “We’ll get it all sorted out soon enough, fix the situation, and then it will just be a waiting game.”
care about the team. It’s possible Tony only said what he did because Steve pushed him into retaliating, but Tony’s cavalier attitude towards his own well-being is enough to drive a saint to extreme measures, and no one who has known him has ever thought Steve a particularly laid-back person. He hates it a little that they still fight. He’d really hoped getting to know each other better would help. Until today, he might have even said it had. But now he’s less sure. He does know that, whatever else might be true, Tony would never intentionally do anything that might endanger someone else, especially someone as close to him as Colonel Rhodes, and it was unfair of Steve to have said such a thing.
“What are you doing?” he asks as softly as he can, twitching again as Tony’s palm curves over his hip. There are people everywhere, and he’s pretty sure they can all see where Tony’s hand is.
“I’ll let you know how it goes,” Rhodey promises, ready to head out. “And you call me if you need me. I know you’re a married man and all,” he neatly dodges the wrench Tony chucks halfheartedly at him, “but if things get dicey, I can be here in a couple hours.”
By the time Rhodey takes off after dinner on Thursday, his suit has been completely overhauled, and he’s got the body armor prototypes Tony had gone over with Pepper and Coulson before the wedding. They’ve been tweaked and SHIELD-approved, but the military wants to try them out themselves before they get put into production.
“It’s the store that sold our suits,” Tony tells him, hand tightening in a warning, “to help support several of the city’s homeless shelters. I told you last night they’d called to thank us, remember?”
is now convinced our dear Captain is full of judgment for anyone not flying the straight-and-narrow. We needed to troubleshoot. He suggested we tell people we were arguing about picking out curtains, or china patterns, or wedding venues, and the Powers That Be decided we would have to
, doesn’t ask if he’ll still be thinking about it tomorrow, or the day after, just lets himself have this. He pulls Steve closer until he drops down onto his elbows, arches up to kiss him until everything goes out of his head except for
think his life has turned into a 90s teen movie, he does feel like he’s waiting for a punchline, or for the other shoe to drop.
Ms. Potts hums. “He should be. I left him with several contracts I need his opinions on, and a few others he doesn’t get an opinion on, but has to sign anyway.” Her smile now is sharp, and Steve is reminded that this is the woman who has kept Tony Stark in line for over a decade, and has won the not-even-grudging respect of both Nicholas Fury and Phil Coulson. “Did your gear need work? Or did you just need to fill Tony in?”
Tony makes a face. “If I’m not, it’s my own damn fault. Cap’n Crunch is too perfect to cause any problems.”
He’s been doing this more than he maybe should of late, slipping outside while Steve’s otherwise engaged, though usually it’s with groups of people. Tony’s certainly glad for Steve’s sake that Steve is doing better in crowds, but he’s also glad for his own. He hasn’t had to be less vigilant, exactly, but it’s been nice to be able to get away for a few minutes, to get a breath of air, or even just to use the restroom without worrying Steve might have a panic attack. He hasn’t asked Steve what it is about being in the Captain America uniform that makes bright lights and loud noises okay, when he has so much trouble in any other kind of suit, but, well. He figures that’s PTSD at its finest, and he certainly can’t throw stones there. If Steve wants to talk about it, he will. Tony wouldn’t be surprised if he had, with Barton or Natasha, maybe. Tony thinks they’re all probably better at dealing with their various traumas in armor. He certainly is.
Steve flinches, and looks down, startled, like he hadn’t realized Tony had been clawing him open. “Don’t worry about it,” he says, looking back up at Tony. “It’s fine. Are you. How are you?”
It’s one of the shorter battles they’ve fought, but brutal, made worse by the close quarters. Tony’s not familiar enough with regular, everyday alligators to know if they’re always this vicious, but he’s pretty sure they don’t usually attack en masse in the wild.
“Speculation only, at this point,” Ms. Potts tells them. “Which is good. The idea is for things like this –” she waves at the images still floating above the remains of everyone’s breakfast “– to look somewhere between a slip-up and lucky camera work. None of the major sources have put these two sets together, yet, it’s all just the usual fuss over Tony, heightened by the fact that it’s a known Avenger he’s in public with.”
Steve gives himself a bit of a mental shake, and nods. “Think we can get away with it?” he asks. It sounds so tempting to not have to go sit in a restaurant somewhere and pretend they want to be playing footsie under the table, but he knows their timeline, and he doesn’t think he has the energy right now to sit through being chewed out for messing anything up.
“I didn’t propose!” Steve interjects, rather more loudly than he’d intended. Thor looks startled. Steve’s a little startled, himself, but this is ridiculous.
None of it seems important, with Tony pressed up against him, one hand locked in his hair, the other braced at the small of Steve’s back, keeping him close. Steve has tangled his own fingers in Tony’s short hair, and somehow managed to untuck Tony’s shirt without meaning to, palm sliding up over the smooth skin of his back. It’s easy and wonderful and Steve has
“It could be,” Pepper agrees. “But it’s not. It’s an Independence Day Gala. It is also your husband’s birthday, and even these parasites won’t mind if you sneak out early. They probably expect it. So go, sneak. Watch the fireworks from home. If you’re going to spend the evening thinking, may as well do it there.”
“I’m ready, I’m ready,” Tony feels like he’s been ready for ages, feels the strain in his muscles from trying to keep still, trying not to thrust up or push down.
Only a little pointedly, Steve takes over, starting with a rapid rundown of what they know and sliding right into a game plan, such as it is. Everyone nods, including Tony, but the Iron Man facemask is already down, so Steve’s not positive he’s been listening. At least Rhodes has his mask up.
“Oh,” Tony frowns. “No.” He digs through his drawers for socks and underwear. “He lives here, now, so he should be able to come and go.”
The rest of the photos are clearly paparazzi shots from when they left the restaurant. There wouldn’t be anything particularly remarkable about them out of context, but in conjunction with the pictures from inside, it’s more noticeable how close together they’re standing when they first come through the door, the hand Tony had placed at the small of Steve’s back, and then the careful distance between them when they’d seen all the photographers.
“This is common knowledge,” Thor points out, and he looks a little amused now. “And I was informed of the nature of the agreement upon my arrival. I was given to understand, however, that it was your proposal, and –”
The barista calls Steve’s name and he goes back to the counter to pick up his drink. When he turns around again, Fury is sitting at his table. Somehow, Steve is not surprised.
“I see nothing unusual, sir,” Jarvis adds. “Whatever was causing the change appears to have ceased.”
“Don’t,” he cuts her off before she can say anything. “Top of my list of things I don’t need you telling me about is Steve
Steve vacillates for a moment. He was hoping Tony would be gone or in his workshop, and the others would be in their private quarters, or not in the Tower at all. He can’t even get to his room or the library without going past someone. “Is there a – a conference room, or somewhere else I could go to be alone?” he asks carefully.
There might be something to it all, Steve thinks as he slides under his sheets, more than just the fact that he hadn’t so much as kissed anyone for months before that first for-the-cameras kiss with Tony. He’s pretty sure he’d have to be blind not to realize how attractive Tony is, and now he’s got more of a handle on what Tony’s like behind all the flash, it seems almost logical that he’d develop some kind of an interest. And Tony’s seemed not
“What?” Tony’s not sure where Steve took such a sharp turn. “No one’s throwing anything out. What’s the point of that? They get sold. Far better price for things only worn once, particularly from red carpet events.”
“So you just throw everything out? After wearing it once?” Steve’s on his feet now, the sun turning his hair into a halo around his head, like some sort of angel of angry righteousness.
War Machine drops Clint into a tree, which seems as good a perch as any. Banner vanishes somewhere, possibly to try herding fleeing locals to safety until SHIELD can muster out. The two armors take to circling, using repulsor beams to take the giant birds out, or at least keep them contained. The jet remains aloft, and Natasha joins the effort to keep the birds in the park.
“That’s my line,” the words slip out of Tony’s mouth without his say-so, but it makes the corner of Steve’s mouth tick up just a little.
Steve freezes for half a second, because they’re still airborne, but then Iron Man shoots past him, one armored arm hooked around Banner, and out into the open air. War Machine, Clint in tow, is next, and then Thor is offering Steve his hand, like they’re heading out onto a dancefloor.
would end up living there, excepting the size of the clothes and the toiletry brands. It’s like some of the corporate apartments Steve has seen on missions in the last year.
“No,” Steve has that look on his face that means he’s decided not to ask. “Whatever you’re having is fine.”
not follow a goddamned order, but you dragged Rhodes with you, got yourself injured for no damned – and what about him? – are you proud of yourself?” and Steve wasn’t going to start yelling in public, he wasn’t, but he’s been bottling up his frustrations for over a week now, and he’s got a head full of steam and he just. Can’t. Do this.
“Tell me you’re okay with this,” he says, voice soft, and Tony’s embarrassingly grateful that Rhodey’s eyes are on his work as he loops the bow tie around Tony’s neck and carefully knots it.
This is what always happens, he thinks. Everything’s fine right up until it’s not. Tony will say something not at all intended to be incendiary, Steve bites his head off for it, and Tony goes for Steve’s soft spots. He doesn’t even mean to do it – doesn’t usually mean it at all, not these days – but he hates when people try to push him around, and he learned young that the best defense is a good offense. Take them out before they can take you out. And Steve can get right under Tony’s skin faster than anyone since his dad died.
“We should be good, but thank you,” Ms. Potts replies, putting all the papers neatly back into their folder.
