“What, being an Omega or worse yet, being converted from an Alpha to an Omega by one of his closest friends?” Her green eyes are burning into him now, mug held steady to her lips as she blows on the hot surface. How she’s so unshakeable as she brings down Steve’s world is beyond him.
“I’m Tracy. I was a betrothal baby. They grandfathered us in, you know. My alpha was much older than I am. Something like twenty years? I was given to him when I was sixteen, the age of omega consent in my state. Maybe someone else would have been fine with it. Sometimes I think I just complained too much about things.” Angela puts a hand on Tracy’s arm as if to say that what she said isn’t true.
“Son, he’s already the kind of omega that people, and other omegas, look up to. That’s not a battle you’ll be able to fight with him.”
Sam laughs, deep chuckles that sound like they’re emanating from deep within his belly. “You’re outta luck there. Let’s go.”
Tony comes out wearing an understated heather grey suit with large, light blue plaid lines, and a powder blue shirt with a light blue silk tie. It’s a good contrast with his navy suit. He notes that Tony is wearing what looks like Keds or plimsolls, and Steve almost opens his mouth to say something about it before Tony levels him a look as though he knows exactly what Steve is going to say.
“I’ve loved you for so long, and I want to love you for longer. Would you do me the honor of becoming my husband?” Tony sucks in a breath before it spills over him.
The campfire wavers in the distance and he takes another drink. God, it’s gross. Some kind of flavored Brandy.
“Then if that’s the case, I’m going to rut you like an animal.” Before he can blink, Steve is on him, arranging his body into lordosis, using his super strength to flip Tony right around and prop him ass-upward. Steve’s display makes his already full stomach swirl with anticipation, something like terror, and guilt. Steve wants to take it slow, to
Tony had always expected that finding the right scent would feel like Spanish Inquisition. He’d feel attacked, trapped by some aggressive scent that reminded him of home, of Howard.
He feels the pop more than hears it, but hear it he does. Steve is not so much a fool that he doesn’t know what it is.
“It’s a brave new world out there. Why not try something new?” Iron Man tilts his head consideringly.
“I’m not your friend, so hear me when I say this. I know he’s out there, and we’ll find him. Dead or alive, we’ll find something.”
“Tony, I’m not the husband you deserve. You should have so much more than me.” Steve gestures, open handed at Tony, despairing. He feels as if he’s on the edge of a frozen pond, forced to go forward and not knowing how thick the ice is. He doesn’t really understand what Tony is trying to say.
He considers what he can do to convince her otherwise. Resistance was something he never expected to see. But he’s a strategist, in the end.
They both stare at him, their own brand of uncertainty lurking in their eyes. A mere thirty minutes ago, Bucky was buried balls deep inside of Tony. A mere hour ago, Steve was filling him up, promising him pups. The images are pasted to the back of Tony’s eyelids and seared into his brain. His throat clicks as he opens his mouth and closes it again.
“Why shouldn’t the guy let off a little steam?” Tony says in reference to Banner. Never let it be said that Tony isn’t willing to do death defying feats worthy of a hero, because Cap looks like he could bite his fingers off as he shoves Tony away.
Tony mulls it over, Steve pestering him for answers. When he realizes just where Loki is going, he feels ice cold fear grip him. Pepper. Happy.
“How do you want it sweetheart? Rough? Yeah, you want it to hurt, don’t you.” Tony is mouthing up and down Steve’s neck as he whines at Steve’s question. Taking that as further permission, he grabs Tony’s legs and hauls him up, arms under Tony’s taut thighs. They walk like that to the couch where Steve drops Tony unceremoniously to the cushions. He looks down at his prey, and Tony gazes back at him, eyes dilated, with a growing smirk of delight.
. It’s torture being impaled on Steve’s cock like this without any extra stimulation, and he reaches for his own cock, trying to ride the arousal he feels at his ass being so full of Steve. He can’t even contemplate what it will be like to have Bucky in his mouth at the same time. It’s so much.
“A proper omega? Tony Stark is one of the smartest men alive, omega or not, and he fulfills our contracts for SHIELD’s technology. Contracts that should be being fulfilled as we speak. Instead, I’m here, cleaning up your fucking mess. Forget this. You’re coming in for reeducation. This won’t stand. Not with me, not with your team. I’d say that I won’t tell them about this, but they’ll find out anyway. I don’t want to be there when they do.” Steve’s gut is lead, and he thinks he may have done something horrible. He doesn’t know what a false heat is, but stress-induced heat is a more obvious namesake. He was just trying to do the right thing, and he doesn’t know how or why it hasn’t worked, but it hasn’t. He knows that. He just thought he had more time to figure out a different solution or otherwise convince Tony that what they were working on is important. Tony is simply being stubborn about learning.
“Such a good boy. So pleasing, sweet for me.” Steve is gutting him with rough, deep strokes. It rocks him, his mind as pressed as the pressure inside of him. This was like nothing he’d ever thought, or believed could happen. The pleasure was a peek he was falling over again and again.
“Arm still giving you trouble? You should just let me make you a new one.” Tony drops his wrench onto the desk behind him and gestures for Bucky to bring the arm with outstretched hands.
“Tony?” The other man immediately stops and turns to where Steve is, looking hunted. His eyes narrow and he wipes sweat off his brow as he stands there, waiting. Steve offers the plate then, without saying anything, and Tony slowly comes towards him, sweet scent muted by the clean smell of sweat and hot metal. As he stands before Steve, he can see the bags under Tony’s eyes and a pallor to his face that concerns Steve.
Like it’s some sort of dream, Steve drops to one knee, gazing at Tony from underneath his blond lashes, blue eyes like the heart of a storm waiting to crest over Tony’s heart.
He looks longingly towards the fire and decides that he should try to go left or right to circle back around to the campsite. But the minute he moves forward and left, the wolf turns and makes to block his path, almost like he’s a herding dog.
The Iron Captain is built for so many things that it doesn’t know what it wants to be. It’s as eclectic and strange as its pilots: glutted with power, but fast as lightning. Built to endure, but outfitted with delicate components that inevitably ended up wrecked. State of the art reactor tech, but the oldest drift tech in the stable. The kind that was unforgiving, and required perfect balance between its pilots. They are the only pilots who can stomach its rigorous mental requirements.
“Steve?” Quiet, lost, Natasha barely hears Tony’s voice above the murmuring that’s rising throughout the room.
“Where’d you go pumpkin? Get back here, and bend over like I trained you to do for me. I want to use my fuck toy.” Steve obliges, getting up and turning around, reaching his hands behind him to spread his cheeks and reveal his hole. While he’s here with Tony, his ass belongs to him. That’s been made clear.
The gym welcomes him, the musky scent of sweat and exertion settling in his nose. He meets Bucky’s soft grin, the Alpha wolf’s pointed ears and fluffed tail hypervigilant as always.
His half-Omega recovers quickly, tongue darting out to drag across the top lip and back down into his parted lips. Lips that so rapidly have captured Steve’s attention.
“So good. Beautiful, the way you take me all the way in. Going to knot you, breed you, and keep you full. So full of me. Ride me, sweet omega. Be a good boy.” Tony groans at Steve’s words, and his face relaxes into a delicate expression of longing, as fragile as new ice. Tony rides him then, bouncing himself up and down on Steve’s cock like he was made for it. Steve reaches for Tony’s erection, helping his omega along so that his own orgasm, which is sneaking up on him rapidly, is timed with Tony’s.
“Thanks, Tony.” It gives Tony a little boost of confidence—but only just—because as soon as Bucky turns around, he bristles like a dog. Steve responds in kind, their bodies tense and faces closed with anger. Bucky struts out like he owns the place while Steve stays on the couch, compact, with his hands clenched on his knees.
He tries to feint right, but the wolf doesn’t take it, and walks forward again, this time not stopping its movement at all. Tony, who is terrified out of his mind by this point, decides that he has a better chance of running back to the fire.
“Did you have any plans for today?” Steve asks, hoping he can get Tony to spend some time with him. Maybe Steve can bring him food or other things he wants. He wants to primp Tony’s nest for him. What if he went back to the store and got more blankets. Would Tony like that?
“Tony?” Steve scents the air, super soldier senses so much stronger than the average human. “Why’re you drinking? Did something happen?”
Tony is strapped to the gurney, the clumsy rolling of it distracting him from pawing at his oxygen mask.
When Steve returns, Tony will be in heat. He’ll want and need Steve. He goes to his room, sits on the edge of the bed, and keeps his phone on ring, looking at the screen for what feels like every other second.
“That’s a very roundabout way of telling the story, but letting you have your narrative doesn’t conflict with our end goals.”
If he was being honest, it disturbed him. Tony shouldn’t be nearly so vulnerable, so available already. Steve is so afraid that he’s undermined his own goals by taking advantage of Tony. He wants a person, a mate, not an automaton who agrees with whatever Steve wants.
Tony’s hole is oozing slick now, and he’s canting his hips back in askance. Steve leans over him on all fours, the head of his cock gliding against Tony’s wet thighs.
“Steve,” he says, and then comes untouched, knot swelling between them. Steve grunts and follows after, the fluttering of his cock as he empties himself into Tony a counterpoint to the tender stroking of Tony’s face that Steve is engaged in.
Of course, that’s when Nat strolls in, right on time to throw a spanner in the workings of Steve’s inner turmoil.
“How can you say all that after how you’ve seen him treat Pepper? He’s been the best he’s ever been these past few weeks. He’s cooperative with the team, nonviolent, sleeping, eating, smiling. If this isn’t who he’s meant to be, then you go right ahead down there and tell him whatever you think is going on. Just go.” Nat is still, preternaturally so, before she starts to move back, eyes still wary on Steve.
He wants the right to towel off the blood from Tony’s battles, to gentle the Omega with firm hands at his hips and Tony keening with need for Steve, his Alpha.
Steve leads him down the hall, straight to his bedroom door. If there was a point where Tony should balk, it’s right here, but he follows Steve into the room, letting his wings squeeze in behind him without an iota of grace.
Steve now suckles at Tony’s softening cock, seemingly content to let it roll on his tongue, seeking out the ridge of his head and the slit at the top. He’s licking the heat away, which sits in the peripheral of Tony’s consciousness, waiting for the next wave to ride in and seize him up in feral need. The only thing—the only thing keeping it back is the obscene suction of Steve’s lips and mouth. It hollows him out, sends everything that’s left of him down to a single point of contact. His worse nature being pulled in, lulled, and placated. Tony hates that this is the only time he can think, and even still, his face scrunched in pleasure, tears at the corners of his eyes as he cries and whines for Steve.
It wasn’t like he was betraying Steve with Bucky, but it felt like that. Like Steve had some prior claim on Tony’s affections. They’d known each other longer, even if Steve wasn’t really his to have and wasn’t interested in someone like Tony.
“Better get that. Can’t go to battle without our moral and upstanding Captain America.” It cuts him, the insult, and he scrunches his feelings down inside further. He’s messed this up again.
“As much as you want me.” When he bumps his cock against Tony’s hardness, the other man gasps, breath a puff on Steve’s face. Steve reaches out, grasping Tony as he pulls the other man into his embrace, the bones of Steve’s hips bracketing Tony’s. The narrowness of Tony’s waist is its own sweetness, and he thinks about Tony bare before him, impaled on Steve. Steve, inside him, consuming him and polishing until all what’s left is a shining star of destruction that’s all Steve’s.
“You did.” Tony traces the seams of the new uniform they’ve given Steve. It has a star on it. Tony likes that.
It was fine for so many years. I’m in my late 30s. I never wanted for anything. My husband signed for my birth control and expensive heat suppressants so I could do my job traveling doing software installs for a healthcare company. My money paid for all these things, but as with everything, you need your alpha’s permission to use your own money if you opted for a joint account. And even then your alpha can close down your individual checking account without you present.”
He can’t see the fire anymore, and he isn’t exactly sure of where he is, but he knows it’s deep into the forest.
Steve continues his efforts to remove Tony’s clothes while Tony lays there in a daze, wondering how this is at all happening. Soon, he’s completely naked and vulnerable, slick coating the insides of his thighs while he tries to hide his erection from the two alphas.
The claws dive in again, less coordinated this time, and Tony briefly thinks that the Kaiju is dying before he has the twisted desire to be wrapped up in the creature’s hand, to be tossed out to where
There’s a slight shift, and the Vendorian gives up the game, sloughing off its disguise and changing into a chittering, thin cephalopod-like alien with six tentacles writhing all around it, along with the one that’s inside Tony.
“I tried filing for divorce, but the judge issued a marital estoppel because I was pregnant. It said that because I agreed to the marriage, and the life of the fetus was potentially in jeopardy otherwise, I couldn’t go back on my marriage claim. There was no way to escape. I had no money, no job, and here I had this baby that was going to be born into this, this life. David wasn’t a bad alpha, a bad man. I know that. He was doing what he thought was right. But what he did, it’s wrong. I don’t regret being pregnant, but I lost my entire life.”
“I got hit with the spell that changed me back, remember? I am the only authority that matters, Cap. This is my world, you’re just living in it.” Tony’s eyes are dark with menace as he replies. The newer suit he has coils and vibrates around him, angry. Steve suspects it’s connected to him biologically, and he wonders if Tony knows that it’s an easy way to read his emotional state.
“I don’t either.” Bucky stands and offers his hand to Tony, not willing to be one-upped by Steve’s demonstration. It spurs Steve to get up as well and approach. They both gaze down at him, and Tony switches back and forth between their beautiful faces. This is probably the worst idea in the history of bad ideas, but Tony can’t help it. Wanting both of them and getting both of them has led to him needing to keep it.
“Uh, kind of been wondering the same thing about you.” Now Tony knows he has a smug look on his face. He’s practiced looking down on people in a mirror. You can’t properly make someone feel like shit otherwise. He hopes it’s working.
“I’ll help.” They work silently, not side by side, but close enough. It’s peaceful, and he has more of a chance to catch Tony’s attention. Steve isn’t usually this reckless, but the circumstances make him feel like he has no time to lose.
“Look, you have caloric needs that far exceed my own. I can live on coffee and peanut butter. When I can’t cook something, what do you think is going to happen? Hmm? I’m not going to starve. I already don’t need to eat much. It’s your price to pay. Besides, company luncheons are a thing. I’ll be just fine.” By god this omega is insufferable. Everything Steve tries to do, Tony finds a way to get around and make light of how important these behaviors are. A proper omega would clean, cook, and generally be amenable to their alpha. But here is Tony, defying all expectations right out of the gate. Steve is almost impressed if he wasn’t outraged.
“Conversation was invented to conceal reality. In case that was lost on you, we talk in order to lie. So I don’t want to hear it.”
The shower is hot as Tony vigorously rubs the soap over his body, grabbing Steve’s favorite shampoo to use in his hair. He’s never gotten dressed so fast, stumbling into his pants and falling back onto the bed as he struggles to pull them on. He only hesitates for a moment before grabbing the letter, some instinct saying he should carry it on his person. Spurred on, he races to the kitchen, the pads of his feet smacking against the floor as he bounds through the hall, skids on the rug in the entryway, and leaps forward into the room, finding it—
“Hey, so I’ve got a emergibeacon on me, so don’t think to cross my limits. My ass is yours for an hour, no marks, no pain. I’ve got embedded protection, so no need for condoms. We good?” Tony has a hand on the door as he observes the Andorian. The guy seems to be a little out of it, but he clearly had enough presence of mind to accept Tony’s offer and walk all the way here, so it can’t be that bad. After, they can go get the part they need. Tony has to go get their credit chip first, anyway.
“Yeah, you’re missing the point. We’ve done away with monarchy, so even if you manage to find a fancy chair to sit on, it’ll never be a comfortable one. You may not lose, but you won’t win. And maybe we can’t beat your army, but really, it’s all down to you. Because if we can’t protect the earth, you can be damn well sure we’ll avenge it.” Loki is stalking ever closer, his face twisted with quiet fury, staff clenched tightly. Tony knows what’s coming. He hadn’t seen what it had done to Barton, but he’d read the reports at this point and seen enough of Selvig to be concerned.
Steve wakes up as normal, patting Tony on the head before getting up to make coffee. It leaves Tony forlorn in their bed, counting in an unknown measure how close he is to hearing what Steve has to say for himself. The truth is as difficult to lay hold on as air. It’s squirming, unidentifiable to Tony, and he doesn’t know if he wants to see it or carry it. As if looking it in the eye will turn his life to stone.
“The results of your personality test matched you with service Alphas category. I’ll admit, initial—more topical—assessments would have put you in the Omegan impudent category, and thus the more dominant Alpha, but as it turns out—” sex-ccountant clearly had deeply personal feelings on Tony’s image, and as the beta droned on, paging through the fuck-boring paperwork that contained more about Tony than he would ever reasonably allow to stay in their hands, Tony felt the soft sting of the drunken surreal becoming reality.
“What made you decide to stay being an Alpha?” His words were rushed, spilling as if he couldn’t get them out fast enough. Once they’re in the air, Steve wants to dissociate from them; he can’t own them. He considers running away now without waiting for the answer, but Bucky has stopped his movements and has set his piercing dark-blue eyes onto Steve.
The man, who is a Norse god called Thor, which Tony would think is some kind of SHIELD conspiracy except for the existence of his brother, Raging Bull, offers to take Loki to the Helicarrier, following the trail of the Quinjet. The Captain agrees and then looks at Tony after Thor flies off with his brother in tow.
“Always such a good boy. Must be why SHIELD likes you so much. Maybe they’re the ones I should be thanking for sending you my way. If only they knew what you got up to while you’re captured by Iron Man.” The gauntlet is soft on his head as it strokes his hair, the clicking of the fingers together pulling at the strands ever so slightly.
“The Avengers. Just a little name we call ourselves. But hey, it includes your brother, the demi-god, a super soldier, a man with breath-taking anger-management issues, and a couple of master assassins. I mean, look, your Caligula style party sounds like great fun, but it’s our job to rain on any parade that encourages playground bullying and could end life on earth as we know it.”
“I won’t antagonize them if they don’t go on about how they need the Iron Man suit for things like ‘peace’ and ‘deterrents.’ They plan to weaponize my armor—” And that was the crux of the matter. In the minds of the military, humanity is nearing a final, glorious stage of Darwinian evolution, in which mankind and guns emerge from a shared chrysalis, unconstrained by conventional morality. Nevermind the “free guns for me, but not for thee” approach always seemed to backfire.
“You should be grateful I opened him up for you. He took three fingers and looked so good doing it.” Bucky sneers at Steve, arms crossed, his face triumphant.
“JARVIS, delete all evidence regarding my little trips to and from the suit.” He steps into it, feeling integrated with himself once more. Iron Man is what belonging feels like.
Steve hears a siren song, pulling him to the depths of an ocean of pleasure, and it molds around him like liquid heat. Steve must rise, to meet his omega at the edge of Tony’s need, and beyond it.
“He can take care of himself. He’s a billionaire. He could eat out every day of the year and never put a dent in his money. So what’s the problem if he does?”
Tony turns and walks towards his room, already starting to unbutton his jacket and his shirt. They get inside and Tony disrobes quietly, without fanfare or any shyness.
Other names are swimming in his head, but he doesn’t want to look. Doesn’t want to know for certain that their lives were as sad as Brenna’s or Colleen’s.
Tony shrugs the shoulder under Sam’s hand. “Anything that gets me closer to my prize is a win in my book.”
The button on his jeans pops open and being the loose pair that he keeps around the workshop, they slink down his hips and make for the floor.
“Fine, I’ll clean up, but since you’re sick, you should stay in bed.” Steve crosses his arms and leans into Tony’s space, using his alpha stance to make Tony back down. Tony doesn’t respond at all in the way he expects.
The huff of breath on his neck and the solid weight of the wolf on top of him stay consistent. Tony scrunches his eyes shut, waiting for the thing to snap at his neck and break it, or otherwise just dive right in and start eating him.
“Going to head down then?” Nat says as Tony’s mug is being rapidly drained of coffee as he tilts it back further and further into his mouth.
. Steve was his Captain, his dominant, and it agonized him now to have gone against Steve. A close second thought was that there was something wrong with his mind.
Steve gives him another once over, eyes going down to his chest before flicking back up to Tony’s face.
“Thank you, that’s kind of you to do this on such short notice. I just want to know what happened to them.”
” Tony pops off Bucky’s cock, unable to resist an alpha command. “There’s my darling. I’ll give you everything you need. All of it. I care about you so much. I’m so sorry for not showing you sooner.” Steve hauls Tony up and out of Bucky’s lap, looping Tony’s arms around his neck and standing up from the bed. Tony feels the open air at his back, and realizes that Steve is going to fuck him standing up. There’s something about that that makes him quiver, knowing about how strong Steve is and how much he’s wanted the man ever since he met him on the Quinjet. Steve is so
“Are you serious right now? You put me in the hospital. I’m not going to be chummy with a person who does that.”
“Don’t compliment them. They’ll get ideas.” His wings shudder in an undignified huff, like they heard him speak, and didn’t like what Tony had to say.
“Tony, you’re a good friend, but wait five minutes and you can go be shameless in the tower,” Bruce says, a wry smile on his face.
for Bucky. When Bucky first came, he was scrambled, lost, but slowly he had come around to display a wry sense of humor, a teasing and mischievous manner. It sat in the counterpoint to Steve, who was always sweet and kind, when he wasn’t deadpan or tight with worry.
“I’m a SHIELD shadow, and part of the Avengers Initiative. Once we knew you were ill, I was tasked to you by Director Fury to help.” Tony’s ass, that’s all she’s there for. He’s about checked out of this, but relishes condescending to the person who lied to him and to Pepper.
“The fuck you are. Give me what I want Steve.” Tony pulls out, and it’s more painful than when he’s pressing in, Steve’s muscles grabbing onto the metal as it slides out with a sickening squelch of lube. Steve hears the suit dismantle and feels the warmth of Tony’s cock press at his entrance.
“Yours.” This is a promise. It’s the beginning for Steve, of all the things he’s going to have with Tony after this. It makes every action, every second guess, all the waiting on Bucky, his confrontation with Nat, the disappointment of their past, bearable. He can carry these things for Tony, as an act of love. Tony doesn’t have to know the cost of their happiness. That is for Steve and Steve alone. And such is love, Steve thinks.
Steve exhales, shaking his head and closing his eyes, hands pressed hard against the side of the counter. He’s adrift now. The fear that all his plans have come to this, to be caught out by Nat, or even Tony, and so soon, feel like ruin.
“Get to it, sport.” Bucky is toweling off his hair that’s limp with sweat before he drags the rag down his arms and chest. At one point, Bucky had been a beta, but Hydra had changed all of that. Very recently, Bucky had had a surgery to help correct some of the issues with the change that Hydra hadn’t seen fit to do.
He makes a bowl for Tony with some bread on the side and heads down once more. It seems that Tony hardly ever leaves his workshop these days, and Steve wonders if that’s where he feels the most safe.
Which, Tony has never been less glad to be proven right when Rogers shows up on a late afternoon, JARVIS kindly informing Tony that Steve was loitering with his bike outside. Tony sends someone to direct him to the garage while he makes himself scarce.
“Hmm. good point. Ok fine, you can come, but Maria and her little dog and pony show stays the fuck away from me.” There’s more grumbling, but there’s not much SHIELD can do on his private property. They beam back up to their ship and leave a quiet and staid Captain America in their place. He wants to know what it would take to ruffle those feathers. He’s certainly done it before, but it’s been so long since Steve Rogers has been his youthful and serum’d self, Tony’s forgotten how to act around him.
He listens to the gentle sounds of Steve’s sleep as he outwaits the sun. He wonders what it could possibly be, and he invents reasons that are worse than the last, culminating in a twisted feeling that Steve was somehow conducting an impossible affair. Which Steve would never do, so Tony is left with no explanations that make any sense.
Steve petted his wings, hands dragging down the soft pinions before he swept back up to the top to start over again. Tony let out a shameless groan before freezing in place. He’d closed his eyes, but now he’s snapped them back open to meet Steve’s.
“I’m not officially a pilot right now. And I’ve got to wait for Steve.” The other techs and scientists walk by, their eyes sliding off of the pilots as though they’re greased. Traitors.
“You’re a baby-faced, no-nothing soldier from Brooklyn when it was a shit-stain. You think you and your newly dropped balls are going to stop me doing what I can? Because see, I haven’t forgotten that you may technically be a grandpa, but project rebirth puts you at the terrible twos you overgrown toddler.”
Steve thinks that even if Tony weren’t Howard’s son, he would stick around anyway just to contain the damage that Tony has done to his life, for the sake of everyone in Tony’s.
that he’s a cat, that he’s supposed to love the sun and its warmth over his skin. After all, Tony has Steve for that. Steve, who is—
“Look, how can you have a peaceful military industrial complex? Well, it may be difficult if you can’t trust anything the military does and the entire concept of weapons buying peace is a lie created by unseen overlords of endless deceptive power. Usually I never have to say the last part, but everybody understands what’s happening.” Tony wondered if Obie would have been charged for kidnapping, with all the contracts he ensured were fulfilled. They’d probably treat him the way the catholic church treats pedophiles: pay everyone to shut up and shuffle onto the next company where he can underhandedly sell guns to terrorists again, justifying the use of extreme force and superior weaponry from, you guessed it, the military.
Steve’s mind grinds to a halt. This is exactly like Iron Man told him. Every part of him cries out to refuse Tony, to say he’s not worthy. That he doesn’t want to be Tracy’s husband who just wanted the heats as if they were his by right.
“Ok, well if you’re going to be you, do it well, then. Don’t give them room to complain, and don’t complain to me when it explodes in your face.” He wasn’t worried, because he was going to verbally hog-tie Stern and any witnesses he called to the stand, and not in the fun way.
“Ok, it’s going to be ok. We’ll get through this. We have to. Oh god.” He tenses up with feeling, gazing into Steve’s beautiful blue eyes. Have they ever been so crystalline? Whatever this is, it’s turning Tony into a bad poet. He needs to rein it in, but whatever this is, insists on running up and down his spine like little pinpricks over his skin, and spurring his ever-rising libido into action.
When Steve looks back, he’ll wonder why he didn’t think of this sooner. How long had this been haunting him without Steve knowing the shape of the specter?
, and Tony wants so badly to hate hearing it. To be rewarded for being Omega, the very thing he’d tried to avoid. But with Steve so close, so
“—but I always—” It’s dizzying, getting hit repeatedly. He wants so badly to go to his knees, let Steve take the rest out on him, to give him what he deserves for not being able to control himself. He knows Barnes isn’t truly guilty, he just doesn’t care anymore. Deep down, the greater insult is that Steve has chosen someone else over him. After everything they’ve been through, Tony means next to nothing. He broke the Accords to go help Steve, for nothing.
“As I was saying, Tony, it’s lovely to see you out in full force tonight. On the cusp of heat and no alpha in sight. You need a hand sweetheart? You always loved it when I helped out.”
Steve takes his time, dragging his fingers across Tony’s tightening scrotum and up against the shaft to the swollen glands. His hands still have their calluses and he drags them roughly along the curve of the head while Tony moans, wanton. Steve traces a vein on the underside of Tony’s cock with his tongue before drawing back up to the tip. There’s a pearl drop of liquid waiting at the slit, and Steve laps it up.
Things don’t improve from there, but Tony thinks it’s still a fair equilibrium. The worst times are when they complete a mission.
“I wasn’t ready. I was on the cusp of a promotion and another raise. My job was my life, and it meant everything to me. But David, he wanted what he wanted. So he cut off my birth control, my heat suppressants. I tried to get him to reconsider, but he wouldn’t. I tried to avoid him during my heat, but he was there, and I just… well, I couldn’t say no in that state. So I was pregnant within three months.”
Steve understood why the man had done what he did, even if he wasn’t pleased with the results. If Steve had been in a similar position, he maybe would have thought of this solution, though he definitely would not have implemented it. Respect for the dead was the first reason that came to mind.
“Found a missing hiker’s tent once, but the animals had gotten to the body. Wasn’t much left. At least it was enough to make an identification. So maybe you’ll have some luck and find that!”
“Man, you both are real downers. I can’t believe I made out with you guys.” It’d been years, but Tony had gotten a few drunken kisses with Rhodey at MIT. And well, there was Pepper, obviously. Those had been the good days, before Afghanistan, his impending heat, and the Avengers took a giant crap on his perpetual good mood.
, like someone stroking fingers down his spine and ending with the tips hovering over his entrance, circling the bundle of nerves there.
“Come on, let me go you giant fluffy asshole,” Tony says, growling to himself. He takes a deep breath and holds it tight. This whole situation feels unnatural, the light of the moon making the forest feel frozen in time, the eerie silence of the land lending to the timeless sensation. His thoughts are skipping everywhere, like a stone across a pond. He needs to get to the fire. He needs to run. He needs to get
“No! No, it’s not his fault. He didn’t do anything! It’s me. I—I don’t want to talk about it, but I’m sorry. I’m no good.”
It left him with a baseless, floating anger. He snapped at Steve for most of the day. Steve, who took it without comment, so wise to Tony’s ways that it made Tony want to rage for how
“Nat, please. This isn’t something I went headlong into without being willing to be there for him at the end.”
For this reason, Steve has worn his kevlar vest and all of his protective gear. Sooner or later, Rhodes would have accosted him, and he wanted to be ready.
for his desires. Did God say he was sorry for creating humans? No. God made promises to his people, albeit foolish ones. Tony is anything but a fool. Why guarantee deliverance when you can monetize redemption? Salvation by subscription in the form of Extremis.
I decided to add a little bit more to this for people who asked for Tony's friend's reactions. They are not happy. :)
“You can’t tell anyone. No one.” Steve all but growled at his demand. Coming out would protect Tony from the illegalities of his decision. Since no one had ever circumvented the law before, and if he did bond eventually, there was no conceivable way to prosecute him should he leave this basement with Steve’s mating mark. It was, for all intents and purposes, a good solution.
“He wanted a super-soldier, a weapon. He got one.” Tony groans at the admission and pulls Steve on top of him.
Tony looks thoroughly debauched, and his gaze is heated on Steve, eyes following his every move. There’s the push-pull of Tony’s muscles under his symbiote suit that draws Steve’s eye, and he brings his hand up to run his fingers down Tony’s pectoral muscles, dragging ever so gently with his nails while he still clutches at Tony’s face. The symbiote shudders, liquid wrapping around Steve’s hands and trailing up his arms, coming to rest over his chest as it starts to tweak his nipples. Steve pants, bringing his mouth back to Tony’s as they meet in a clash of teeth and tongue.
“We’re not finished yet,” Thor reminds them. And yeah, there’s still Hellboy up there to contend with. In Tony’s freaking tower, if he hasn’t escaped yet. Though where Loki would go is beyond him. His army is gone, Thor is here, and he certainly can’t go back to dear old dad.
When Steve reaches around to unbutton him from his pants, he brushes the tip of Tony’s cock, and Tony lets out a soft cry, his whole being a greedy mess, needing and needing. Everything focuses to where Steve’s fingers glance at his flesh, each touch a prickling shock of arousal. More slick gushes out of him. He’s ready, ready, ready. And here Steve is taking his time. Doesn’t he want Tony? What if he doesn’t. He’s got to be better. He will be.
“Steve, please?” The request shudders through him, rolling up from his stomach to his throat with sweet desire, and before he can stop himself, he agrees to Tony’s request.
“Love you, love you so very much, I promise I’ll be there. I’ll be with you and for you. You only have to want it back, and everything I have is yours.” Somehow, Steve is coherent enough to speak to Tony, lowly and wanting, as Tony lays gasping and writhing on Steve’s knot. The spasms from Steve’s cock drive Tony into frenzied thoughts of
“Our life is not a lie just because it started with circumstances that aren’t like anyone else’s.” It’s not. The things that Steve feels for Tony are real. They crawl through his veins, keep him up at night. He dreams of Tony, of their life together and how much he wants to love his Omega to pieces. Wants to take him apart and put him back together the way he deserves. It’s beyond instinct or lust. Steve considers being with Tony an act of worship.
Instinct was a cruel thing. It was the prerogative of Omegas to kneel, submit to an Alpha. Tony couldn’t stop himself.
“Oh, ok.” Steve gets up and follows Natasha out the door. They don’t run into anyone at all, and for that Steve is grateful. They climb into a SHIELD issued Cadillac and Natasha takes to the streets, dipping and winding through traffic as though she drives every day. New York isn’t normally a place for cars. Steve certainly had never driven one until he got into the army.
“He’ll go under conservatorship, and likely another Alpha in his life will take responsibility for him. It wouldn’t be your concern.” This omega shouldn’t be his problem at all. To wake up to this has been worse than he can imagine. Yes, everyone he knows is either dead or quite old, but to be shackled to a pale shadow of his past through Anthony Stark? Anthony, who represents everything he despises about omegas. Vain, flighty, self-obsessed, loose, addictive in personality. It’s too much.
“You won’t be getting my knot, for any reason. I want nothing to do with you in that manner.” Tony has the grace to look appalled, as if he can’t believe that Steve would deny him this one thing. But Steve was wise to how addiction worked. You can’t feed the flames. You can’t fuel the very thing that makes an omega a problem to begin with.
“Just let me take care of you right now. I’ve got you, babe.” Steve licks at his wet cheek and picks Tony up, holding him close. Bucky steps away and leads them back down the stairs to Tony’s room. At least, that’s where Tony thinks they’re going.
Bucky is no better. His stillness, Tony realizes, is his tell. The quietude of the Soldier reveals that Bucky isn’t certain of his footing here. Even as he too is dressed in a sleeveless black shirt with his military styled pants that he usually wears for the field, when he’s most definitely in charge. Bucky did take the time to put on boots, which only add to his stress-induced state of preparedness.
Mainly, that Bucky, as an Alpha, needed to be able to knot. Invasive, expensive, and profoundly painful in its recovery, Bucky had chosen to undergo the procedure to become a full-fledged Alpha.
“Omega bodily fluids taste better when it’s time for heat. I suppose to get our alphas to like it better. The more orgasms an omega has, the more chances for conception. In heat, the orgasms contract the cervix just that little bit to let a lot of come pass by. Sorry for the biology lesson, but I figured you deserved to know,” Tony says after a time.
Impatience takes over Tony, wanting Steve to be the one doing this for Tony, and so he snatches up the plug and draws it behind him, pressing the hard tip to the perfect slot of his hole. Pressing in, he feels the telltale ache, the harsh stretch of it, and Tony lets out an unconscious mewl. It pops in easily, and Tony whimpers, pushing it all the way in with one smooth glide and a shout of Steve’s name.
“Steve— Alpha, please, yes, ready, ready, so ready.” Tony mumbles his consent, his mind in torpor while his skin sings for Steve’s touch. Steve lays a steadying hand on his ass, thumb spreading his already wide-open hole, before dipping the head of his cock into Tony’s ass, clipping the rim with the ridge of his cock.
Bucky stiffens all at once, and before Tony looks up, he knows it’s Steve. Only Steve could make Bucky act like he’s on red alert.
“And you don’t even like her Pep! Look, I kept Iron Man safe, Pepper. And I’d lie again to Christine and Stern if I had to, that’s all that matters.”
He reaches Central Park and meets up with Black Widow and Hawkeye. Both operatives are sheathed in black and stoically silent, but Natasha, the Black Widow, hooks him up with the comms system, and Clint, Hawkeye, informs him of what the situation is on the ground. They’re trying to get the slime contained in a SHIELD approved containment unit. This is just a herding operation, as it doesn’t seem like the slime is sentient beyond its food search.
.” Steve’s Alpha command is strong, and it shuts him down as he takes a step back away from Loki and tilts his body towards Steve. Fuck, that was powerful. He’s going to need to work on something to moderate his response to Steve specifically.
Soon he stands in front of the mirror, the marks on his skin alien without the scent of Alpha on him. He’s already thinking that the Alpha was just something that happened to him, like a car accident, or a plane crash. You get up, you recover, you move on.
Tony cries, and it sounds so sweet from his lips, that Steve wants to chase it down, and he does so, moving back up to Tony’s mouth.
Tony was a liar. He hid his identity. And Tony had killed people, with his negligence. He didn’t listen. Cap didn’t even
He can feel a phantom Steve petting him now, and Tony starts to purr just a little bit thinking of how gentle Steve’s claws are in his hair, how he strokes Tony’s ears—even the pink interior—and rubs at the base of them, so kind. And Tony
Even this one time, this one moment of giving in, no matter that SHIELD had ways of making them forget, Tony would know in his bones he had given in. He’ll figure it out.
“You don’t need to invade SHIELD’s privacy to know what to do. It’s obvious what he’s doing. He’s trying to wind us up. This is a man who means to start a war, and if we don’t stay focused, he’ll succeed. We have orders, we should follow them, and in doing so, we’ll maintain the upper hand here.” Sounds like an argument from a grade-A ass kisser. It’s clear that the good Captain has never been on the receiving end of how systems inevitably and inherently betray people. No matter the good intentions of those running them. And Fury isn’t even in the same category as good or well-meaning.
“Rogers, I don’t want you to think that I don’t care about what you were trying to do. But you have to ask. It’s straight out of my childhood fantasies to watch you defend me from another alpha. It really is. But in reality, things are so much more complicated.” Tony looks at him, desperate for him to understand what he’s trying to say. Steve thinks he gets it. It’s Tony’s choice to deal with the world how he needs to. It’s Steve’s job to be supportive and focus on Tony, and Tony’s needs.
“Is this where you tell me you’ve murdered someone and need help moving the body? Because we aren’t that close.” Iron Man chuckles at his own joke and kicks at the ground, dislodging some gravel.
Steve leans over once more, and kisses Tony as though Tony might break while he starts to fuck into him with something akin to reverence. He is Tony’s first. There may be others after, not if he can help it, but that feeling, the sweet popping of Tony’s flesh, is all his.
But soon that’s over, and Tony is eying him up as a contender. Alphas can’t really help it, and Tony and Steve have been in a dominance fight since day one. Tony is twitching now, hips shifting on his chair and his lips vibrating with unspoken words. Likely insults, knowing Tony.
“A sore loser, I never would have guessed. How’s about, we take the cube, and you take Loki back to wherever he crawled out from, hmm? Until then, stay out of my way. Tourist.” He mumbles the last line and turns to leave, repulsors on partial thrust.
When Steve finds Tony trying desperately to make his bed, it’s almost funny, but for the look of sheer fury that Tony is giving the sheets, and then directing at Steve.
“You know, I put an awful lot into not offending people, considering how bored I am,” he mumbles back at Bruce. “Fine! Just meet me at the tower when you’re done with your spiritual journey to find yourself!” Because what else is Steve doing? Zen and the Art of Motorcycle maintenance? Oh god, what if he has a split personality and that’s why he’s being nice? No way to tell.
Tony cries, tears leaking from his eyes, when Steve reaches down to pluck at the head of his cock, his slick having dripped down to coat him entirely. Steve twists at his cock, hips a rhythmic plunge into Tony’s depths.
“Look at you. So fucking messy. JARVIS, take a picture.” Hot shame rushes through Steve. He knows his face looks like a disaster. Tony will clean it up later, a hot cloth dragging across his stubble, prepping him to be found by SHIELD just in time, but for now, he looks as broken down as he feels. Wet, humiliated putty in Tony’s hands.
He’s been discarded like a bad dream, shed like a snake’s skin from Tony’s life. In the end he is left with the things that he has done.
Sometime during the night, he gets a text from Fury telling him to come in tomorrow at 0800 hours and expect to be there for four. Steve thinks that’s fair, though he doesn’t know what he can learn in four hours time. But he knows he wants to learn. There has to be practical knowledge these days on how to manage omegas that he’s just not grasped as of yet. Hopefully, there will be time to figure those things out.
“Want to fuck that pretty mouth of yours,” he says, hoping Tony is amenable. It is so very pretty, and even more gorgeous wet with spit and red from use. He wonders if Tony can take his entire length. He wants to find out.
He remembers Steve’s face after he fell from the sky, the sudden interest. The way Steve had stared at him across the table during their shawarma.
Captain America was supposed to be the good guy, a bastion of self-control and righteousness. Seeing the man succumb to his baser instincts for
“Well. I had nothing to lose. I’m twenty one now, and I got out a half year ago. Thankfully the alpha isn’t contesting the divorce. I guess he loses interest in them when they’re past pubescent age. He has another betrothal that he purchased that he wants to make good on. They’re commodities you know. There’s about three years worth of betrothals left before they’re all gone and done. Alphas like to buy and sell them.”
. He instinctively turns and runs, a little voice in his head crying that this is the worst of ideas.
“Shut it down Dr. Selvig.” Tony looks into Selvig’s bloodshot and blue eyes, and sees both a scientist excited for the possibilities and a terrified human hiding just underneath that. Powers of the sceptre aside, Tony thinks that it’s possible Selvig could be of some help, but he doesn’t have time to find out.
“Also, we had a statue fall in the garden. It’s too heavy for me to lift, if you wouldn’t mind giving me a hand?” Father Jacobs looks at him consideringly, as if Steve would refuse.
“JARVIS, electricity to subsystem B5, ping the server to test the latency while running five hundred thousand tasks on the processor.”
It’s not that he thinks anything is wrong with Alpha-Alpha relationships, but there’s something off about them, together. Moments when Steve could smell the arousal on Tony, and himself, but they never quite tipped over that fathomless edge. The business of Alpha-Alpha partnerships is difficult, anyway. It’s bad form to assume that a worked up Alpha means they are attracted to another Alpha. Steve gets worked up sometimes too. Though he doesn’t know why he sometimes imagines Tony under him, pliant and sweet like an Omega.
His heart aches. He’s so confused and twisted up. The idea that all this was going on in his neighborhood, on his doorstep, the entire time. It almost defies comprehension. But Edith has no reason to lie. No reason to know him or tell him what Fury and Nat want him to hear. She’s just this harmless old omega. Sweet tempered, even if her dreams of being a singer are not ones he’d condone. Even so, her alpha spanked her, just like he had with Tony, and he feels something ugly curdle in his gut.
“I suppose you know where to find one?” Steve, who has already inventoried the kitchen, does. He pulls it out and exchanges the spatula for the fork. Tony then carefully maneuvers the eggs into scrambling, making sure to get all the yolks broken up.
“That’s fine then. You can do it under my rule. It’s more power than you have right now, anyway.” He lives to see the outrage on Tony’s face as it passes through, his eyes widening in the blip of a second before they narrow in anger.
“You make these promises, but I’m not sure I should believe them. I’m better than ‘good enough.’ I am better than ‘try.’ I deserve good things. And you have been the furthest from good. I want you to leave.”
He wanders away from them, dissatisfied with everything. His parents are breathing down his neck all the time, and he just wants to
Steve was silent, leaning against a broken piece of concrete that didn’t have rebar sticking out of it. They weren’t cramped, given that the elevator they’d been in had smashed down into the sub-basement where all the boilers were kept. Usually, these sub-basements had tunnels leading out, but with the suit mostly out of order, and the structural integrity under question, they couldn’t risk digging anywhere. Their team would get them out. It was just taking them forever to do so.
As fierce as Captain America is considered to be, for some unfathomable reason, it never seems to translate to Steve Rogers, omega. Out of uniform, he might as well be translucent next to Tony when it comes to these hoity-toity parties. Steve never minds. Steve is reliable, patient, enduring. He’s Tony’s anchor when it gets to be too much, and Tony wonders how he ever lived without the man.
“I have an eidetic memory, so.” Tony called him an abuser. He’s like Sean. Rory. Conall. That’s what Tony thinks of him. Steve is abruptly so disgusted with himself, he feels his dinner rush back up. He clutches at his stomach, feeling defensive.
“Maybe. But through God, all things are possible. You owe it to yourself, and to him that made you, to try to move forward. Don’t get me wrong, that’s hard. It’s a long road, and it’s lonely. Which is why you have to walk with god. And if not god, you have to walk with someone or something. Do you have anyone to talk to?”
“Stalling me won’t change a thing.” Tony doesn’t know if it will, but he has to think that it’s better than nothing that Cap and assassins make it here sooner rather than later.
“In the red room where I was trained, where I was raised— they have a graduation ceremony. They sterilize you, glands and all. It’s efficient, and for Omegas, our hormone levels drop, but not to beta levels. The underbelly of the Omega nature is that we are the fiercest, over Alphas or betas. An Alpha must incapacitate instead of kill any home invader in the United States. But Omegas can kill to protect the home, and the law will never prosecute. Deep down, society doesn’t want to acknowledge that Omegas reign supreme in capacity for sheer violence. So in the Red room, they take the one thing from you that matters more than a mission, more than a mate, and leave only the rage behind. It makes it easier. The killing. The hiding. You still think you’re the only Omega on the team who has issues with their designation? You’re not alone Tony.”
“And you think I gave up all the goods to my company? Oh no, the best security is one that isn’t on the general market. Look, I’m going to just get started, and prove right now that I don’t even need to sign a thing.” Tony grabbed the first package and tore it open. It hit the edge of the table and tumbled down like dirty laundry. The scent of sour yogurt permeated the room.
“And how would you know that? You’re not SHIELD, or a soldier. What are you?” Cap comes forward, and for a moment Tony thinks they’ll pass each other by, that Rogers will move out of the way of Tony’s pacing. But he doesn’t, and Tony shuffles in front of Cap, the other man peering down at him, trying to parse Tony.
. And I sure hope it’s not a super zombie, because that would really suck a fat one.” Steve doesn’t know these references at all, but he figures out the meaning of the latter.
“Steve!” The cry is torn from his throat, useless and muted by the groans of the jaeger and the Kaiju.
him. Steve whispers something in Bucky’s ear as they start to move, and Tony is so sickeningly jealous he can’t watch. How does it mean nothing at all, that Steve has touched him, fucked him, and yet it’s Bucky he’s walking away with it? Tony is never good enough.
“No, both of you stay out of it. His argument is with me.” Both Clint and Thor stand down, Thor muttering about honor and battle.
“It felt too good, the changes, to stop them. Did I make the wrong decision Steve?” His Tony is open and vulnerable as he looks at Steve. What’s unspoken is heavy in the air between them: Steve’s hand in Tony’s transition.
It turns out that what Tony decides is best is to immediately get out of bed and make his way to the workshop. Steve meets him in the hallway and for a moment thinks to stop him, but remembers what the doctor said.
“You did excellent work, Stark.” The Captain goes out of his way deliberately to tell Tony he did a good job. As if he can make up for every other thing outside of their working relationship. But Tony can see that Steve isn’t all the way there, that he’s just doing this by rote. And Tony hates false platitudes. He already lives in a world of materialism and fakery.
“I heard you the first time ass-hat.” Tony’s shoulders are dropped into a curl as he starts to stagger off. Steve stops him on a dime.
“That’s the joke he made. I suppose you’re right then. I should ask him what he needs. But then if he can’t cook at all, how is that a compromise? That’s just giving in to him. And he needs to learn.”
“You’re not leaving! I don’t care if you have Iron Man as a bodyguard, you’re staying in the lab where it’s safe.”
“Listen. I’m one of the richest men in the world. I can buy my freedom, bucko.” Something about the way Anthony says that makes Steve recoil. Maybe Howard never intended for them to be together, but Steve can imagine that he certainly didn’t think his son would turn out like this. Anthony is nothing more than a fop with expensive and dangerous tastes. Exactly what happens to omegas when left unchecked.
Because Bucky likes the future, even if Steve doesn’t, and Bucky likes Tony—or, well, Tony likes to think Bucky does. He likes to hope.
All of his dreams are spinning out of control, slipping through his grasp. The worst is that Tony isn’t going to be ok, and if it’s anything he wants, it’s Tony’s security and happiness. Steve doesn’t think he can listen at any more doors during Tony’s rut as the man loses temper. He thinks about what could happen, the people Tony could hurt, and how much Tony could injure himself. It kills him.
It’s a clusterfuck of epic proportions, Aldrich finagling a personal meeting with Tony through one of Tony’s own board members. It’s before lunch, which Steve always brings in on Tuesdays, and it makes Tony watch the clock fastidiously as Aldrich drones on.
“What game, sweetheart?” Bucky looks bewildered, and Tony blinks but continues on with his protests.
“Sleep now?” He has to reign it in, maintain control. He’s the alpha, the one who should keep it together. Yet all he feels are the jagged edges of his self-mastery grinding and sanding themselves into dust.
“Well Tony, every time I almost die, I feel so alive. Why would I ever want to be more careful? So yes, I’m propositioning you. For more than just me. I want you to be part of Hydra. Our goals align, and I think you’ll enjoy the mayhem of taking over the planet.” Steve toasts his glass and gives Tony a sly smile.
“Stark so help me, one more crack—” Hell, ignoring Cap seems to work even better than giving him the time of day.
. It’s your hubris. Not your principles. You don’t have a problem telling people to accept your authority no matter what state you’re in.” Tony pulls the glass away from his mouth, looking infuriated. His mouth works a couple of times before closing.
They make it to the couch, and Tony awkwardly sits to the side with his legs crossed, back facing where he thinks Steve will want him.
“Yeah, that’s it, beg for it. So gorgeous when you’re needy like this.” Bucky leans over Tony and his eyes glitter with what must surely be desire. Tony could stare into the depths of those eyes forever. The idea that he might get to flutters inside his breast like a trapped bird.
“I know you can, sweetheart.” The alpha kisses the top of her head and brings his arm up to wrap around her.
They had made love, in the end. Endless, passionate, encompassing. Their bodies were aching with use, the flex of their muscles a sweet pain to both of them. Steve’s cock was almost oversensitive and numb, and Tony’s insides couldn’t be much better. A contradiction to be sure, but that’s the closest description to what it felt like.
“Hello, I’m Trevor. This is Angela and Mary.” The male omega holds out his hand, and Steve, not knowing whether he’s bonded or not, takes it by instinct before realizing he should have maybe checked to see if the man was bonded. For some reason, it doesn’t hold as much weight in his mind anymore whether an omega is bonded or not, and if he should touch them. He figures the omega can decide for himself whether he wants to be touched.
“Yeah, sweetheart. Meet you down there soon?” Gently, he prises Tony’s arms off, holding the other man’s hands in his own and circling his thumbs over the delicate skin before letting them fall.
“Swing up Park. I’m gonna lay ‘em out for you.” He twirls by and trusts that the Quinjet will be there, and thank Thor it is, because he was about ready to try and plow through a building all on his lonesome.
“I’m sorry Tony, Bruce is gone for the day. So are Nat and Clint. It’s just me.” Steve sounds a little bitter as he says that, and Tony imagines that Steve wishes Bruce were here too.
“It’s not just you anymore that’s at stake. SHIELD can’t abide by a scandal, and you are scandal-prone. If you—” Fury starts.
Tony has a burst of fear at being held down and he instinctively struggles. Steve, equally reflexive, presses down on Tony to prevent escape. Smartly, Steve had also hooked his legs over Tony’s heels, prepared for the kicks that Tony would have delivered, if he’d been quick on the uptake. As it stands, he loathes the lack of control even as his body screams that Steve has the right of it.
Instead, he feels like when she died, she took with her the piece of Tony that she’d claimed for herself. He’d never gotten it back. He needed to get it back from her, but he very well couldn’t reach into the grave to scoop it out of her dead body. No, she had eaten it, and now she would never divulge her contents again. Whatever journey her sad soul took, that piece of him went with.
An Omega’s tears will drag all of this to a halt, unless they’re from pleasure. The scent of sadness is an automatic turnoff for most Alphas, including Steve. And he can already scent the fear in Tony, which is almost too much, to begin with.
” Steve presses in with one finger up to the last knuckle, before twisting it out again. He plunges it in once again, catching the rim on his way out and in. He loves watching Tony suck him in, his hole greedy and wanting.
Steve is whispering endearments, filthy and profoundly sweet. He talks about the warmth of Tony’s cunt being made for him. How sweet Tony will look pregnant with his children. And Tony wants that, wants Steven’s cum, his children, wants his very being to be the earth to Steve’s sun.
He wants to ask her more questions. To get to the root of all of this, but he finds himself stilled by respect for her, and also at a loss for words.
“I appreciate the position you’re in, where you couldn’t make demands of Tony at the time, but things are different now, going forward. He should be able to manage running a home, and at the same time he should hire more people to do what is necessary at SI,” Steve says, holding his hands out in front of him to show he means well.
“No, see, I’m the only one who is going to get drunk at any point today. As drunk as whoever it was when they decided all this was a good idea, because it certainly wasn’t just you who put this party together.” He gestures at the ruined living room of the penthouse.
In the car, Sam drives with eagle-eyed precision in and out of New York traffic. After five minutes of silence, Sam slows to a stop at a red light and cocks his head toward Tony.
“Yes, but not in that way. What is the point of letting this happen to me if there’s no purpose at the end of it! I want– I want–” Tony can’t finish as he stands up and slams his hands down on the table behind him, eyes clenched shut.
On the way back home he says two runs of the rosary, which takes up the entire time it takes to get home. He enters the tower with anticipation. He’s going to apologize to Tony. First he’ll make him a nice meal, and then he’ll bring it down, and he’ll say that he’s sorry. He’ll never lay a hand on Tony again and that he hopes Tony can give a friendship between them a real chance.
“I’m getting away from myself. Conall was difficult to please. He liked his dinner at six o’clock sharp, and if it was off, he’d take his hand to my behind. That’s always a sensitive place for omegas, and it was humiliating! Imagine, me, a grown omega, taken over an alpha’s knee! But he wasn’t a very forgiving man. Oh, out in public he had me leashed and collared, no matter that I despised the thing. And you can bet your bottom dollar that in private? He was a right menace. The spanking was just—well I don’t like to come out and say it, but it’s an awful thing to do to an omega.”
Cap gives out the orders and Tony snatches up Barton as he’s told to monitor the perimeter. He’s not the only flyer, but it makes the most sense having him be the whale-wrangler.
But, he knows he should talk to Tony. Tell him his theory. Though if he does, and Tony says no, what then? Steve can’t tolerate failure, and he’s fixated onto this idea now. It’s not even for Steve; it’s for Tony’s sake.
“You liked it, I liked it, it’s enough. We’ll talk later ok?” And Steve is gone, leaving Tony feeling a wreck, standing there in a pool of his pants and underwear.
“Ok Nat, that pregnant pause was in its first trimester by the time you opened your mouth. So what’s the deal?” Tony is on alert now, and Steve feels a chasm opening up in his chest as he accidentally knocks the bowl he’s dumping ingredients in before catching it. Clearing his throat, he glances at Tony from underneath his eyelashes as he continues to add milk to the batter.
Tony kisses Steve like he can’t not kiss him. He devours the very air in Steve’s mouth, licking into him, eager to reach teeth and tongue. When Tony finds it, he sucks filthily on the Alpha’s tongue. He wants to devote his whole mouth to worshiping Steve, and the very thought of licking the precum off Steve’s leaking cock before he buries it in Tony’s throat makes him shudder.
Tony hums, noncommittal. The less he talks to the Captain, the better. When he reaches the helicarrier, he’ll shuck his suit off and have JARVIS take over. That way, when Tony Stark does meet the Captain, he can ensure that he controls the stage. Tony is good at this. But what is he not good at?
Otherwise, Tony seems to be vibrating with energy. Steve will have to make sure he works out to burn some of that off, because they won’t be engaged in anything together that will help. It makes him wonder if he should offer Tony his body to help with the instability omegas feel when they’re undersexed, but he thinks the other changes will be sufficient to put a damper on Tony’s more promiscuous behavior.
“Steve, I want you to soothe me using my gland, and stop hiding your hard-on for me, I can smell how much you want me.”
“Yes. He’s—Father, he’s so frustrating. He doesn’t do anything I tell him to, and everyone I talk to about it seems to think it’s my fault that he—well, he ended up in the hospital with a false heat. And I’m ashamed I didn’t see that he was that stressed, but I don’t know what to do to get him to be the omega he should. You’ve seen him, I presume. How he acts. I just, I know this is a confession, but I’m in need of guidance.”
“Some of us here, we help through the heats, as best we can. We don’t have a knot, but it’s better than nothing. We don’t need alphas.” Trevor is glowering at him now, as if he’s specifically offensive to them.
Steve reaches over and cups Tony’s cheek, drawing him closer, ever closer. Tony crawls with it, letting Steve guide him, limbs dragging over the bedding and coming to rest straddling over Steve’s lap. Steve keeps his hand gently glued to Tony’s cheek as they breathe in each other’s recycled air. Back and forth, steamy and warm in Steve’s lungs.
“See? Done. No signature, no problem, thank you for your time and goodbye.” He stalked out, snatching the stack of papers that contained more information than the average person’s facebook, ready to face the wrath of his assistant.
“I’m getting to it. The current laws at the time deemed omegas to be property. That was only changed in around 1963, though omegas still didn’t have the right to vote on their own until 1967. At that time, suicide rates went down to 200,000 in 1964 and 145,000 in 1968, with lifetime attempts at a stable 750,000. So better, but still not great.
“Alrighty. Let’s say I accept this offer. I mean, it sounds fun, ruling the world. What do you want from me? Why the hell do you even need me anyway?”
What if it’s always like this between them? If the wounds that Steve has inflicted on Tony are too deep for Tony to reconcile, then what of their relationship? Steve isn’t sure that this can be a one time thing for him, not anymore. He
But it’s Steve who is looking down at him with a paralyzed expression, his lips parted and eyes wide.
It was coming on strong now, like a cancer of the soul where the only chemotherapy was going to be a good dicking down. Tony wondered how this was his life. How in all this modernity he hadn’t been able to find a way to circumvent a most basic biological system in order to give himself a choice in all this. Now he was here, standing outside an ugly door with security code that would take him into what was presumably a sex dungeon that, shudder, Fury had probably overseen the putting together of. Soon after, a random alpha was going to show up and ask for his consent, and Tony wasn’t sure if he wanted to give it.
The armor fell to pieces around him, and Tony had never felt more ready to be whole, to be complete.
“No, you’re a good man who’s made a mistake. A bad, long term mistake that you should really look into not continuing anymore, but just a mistake.”
“Steve.” Just his name, and Steve pauses, looks back at Tony. The other man has disheveled his own hair with a fist clenched into it, eyes still inky with repressed lust.
. He can’t take advantage of Steve. Even though he very much wants to. But telling? That would be even worse. Because if Steve rejects him, which he will, then the team will suffer the consequences.
“I’m currently courting an Omega, and I wanted to establish care with a clinic.” Dr. Nowak is good. So good, that it had taken months to get an appointment at the clinic in the first place. He has a follow-up two weeks from now, when he’ll have Tony with him.
He lays Tony out before him on the bed on his stomach and rubs Tony’s wet hole with a free hand. Tony keens, whining and pushing his ass up into Steve’s hand, squirming.
Tony sits at the island counter, new fork in hand as he cuts into the food. He starts eating as quickly as possible, making Steve want to slow him down. But he’s learned at this point it’s better to pick his battles.
Inside, it’s eerily quiet, the twin headsets tilted and languishing against each other, taunting him. Tony boots up a screen and snatches one of the helmets, donning it as he goes through the routine of turning on the training routines. The neural load is supposed to be unbearable for two people, but more than ever, Tony believes Steve is waiting for Tony to find him, inside of their bond.
“Ok, fine. So the things that aren’t good about this situation right now, is, well, one of them is I’m drunk.”
“I had a handle on that. I don’t need you to defend me.” Tony is looking up at him with well-disguised upset. If Steve didn’t know what Tony looked like when he was pissed, he might not have seen the way Tony’s eyes twitched and his mouth got tight.
“I’ve always wanted you– Wanted to kiss– that impertinent– mouth.” He spoke between nipping kisses, teeth rough on Tony’s lips. Tony could only keen into Steve’s hot mouth. He would be so good. He promised himself. No more sarcastic comebacks, unless Steve wanted that.
For which Tony was expected to be suitably grateful. But he wasn’t going to be. He’d been ready to accept the Encephalitis due to heat inflammation that would surely put him in a coma, if not, give him brain damage beyond recovery.
“Then I guess we’re ready to start our new life together.” Tony barrels past Steve and out the door into the hallway beyond. Steve follows after him.
Steve acts as though he didn’t hear a word Bucky has said, and Tony chokes a bit as another convulsion of Steve pours more into him.
He wishes Natasha were here. They work well in counterpoint to one another, gathering information and tech that will possibly bring them all back to earth sooner rather than later. This is the kind of situation where Tony thought they would have been out of here months ago, but as time drifted by, things got more desperate than stable. Now Natasha hires herself out as a mercenary, along with Clint, Steve, and the Hulk. It’s more important that they earn money to afford tech for the spaceship they’re rehabbing than do this task. No, tech and trading for tech is Tony’s purview, and there’s one single way he’s found that works best to loosen lips on where the best stuff is found and how to make it cheaper: prostitution.
“Yeah, gonna pin that up in the workshop. Jack off to it later today while I think about my metal cock, splitting your ass open. Maybe I’ll take a nice video. You always hate that there’s evidence, but you never stop me, do you? You like it too much.” Iron Man is right, as always. Steve is mortified by how he’s gotten here, and what
The bandage on his arm is miniscule, and he resents the implication that something so small, an insignificant needle, can upend his plans to find out exactly who he spent his time with. He doesn’t remember driving to the building. Or even leaving his lab. The heat he expected, but the unintended side effects are that his memory from the weeks previous are also spotty. He’d known that would be the case, but experiencing it is something else.
In the aftermath, Tony could almost argue that it’s peaceful and that it’ll all be ok. That there’s nothing to solve. He gulps and starts to leverage himself up, pushing Bucky off his chest and pulling himself away from Steve.
He should have been embarrassed, his slick hole exposed to Steve’s purview, leaking cock red and used against the pillows underneath him. But he’s presented so many times now that there’s no point in shame. Steve seems to enjoy it; he likes to spread Tony sometimes and watch his cock sink in and out of Tony’s sopping heat.
“First off, I’m not touching anything related to me being a proper omega. Fuck no. Second, how is it me, the victim here, that has to inform you, the abuser, what he’s done wrong and when he’s done it? You should know. I shouldn’t have to tell you. And honestly? You’re crossing the goddamn line right now. Your apology is shit. It’s ‘I’m sorry,’ full stop. Not ‘I’m sorry, but,’ or ‘I’m sorry, however,’ and not even ‘I’m sorry, although.’ It’s just that you’re sorry. That you shouldn’t have done it. That you were thinking this other thing, but it was wrong. That you won’t do it again. And the question that if there’s anything you can do to make it better, along with the commitment that you will do that thing. That’s what an apology looks like Steve. Learn it.”
The war had taken all of the time he would have had to learn how omegas worked, how they functioned. He’d only had a singular view that omegas were as unattainable as they were vapid.
He stomps back upstairs and sets the plate down hard on the countertop. It thankfully doesn’t break this time, but Steve almost wishes it would.
Looking down at his elongated cock, he reconsiders that maybe it’s just a fantasy. It doesn’t have to be real. Tony is an Alpha and Steve is an Alpha and they will never be. He fists his dick then, feeling the tell-tale puff of his knot under his knuckles as he begins to jerk his hand forward. Tony is hovering outside of his consciousness, waiting for a way in, and Steve lets it happen. Lets Tony slither into his seams and deposit himself there.
There’s fires, cars, and smoke for miles, and surrounding him are the milling people who collectively take up the call that Steve figures means ‘food.’ It ripples through the crowd of them, echoing off buildings and reverberating back towards the creatures that stand before him.
“You’d think that people who get up to helping us designated deviants hump it out would do this over drinks and dinner. Is this an ambush, Pepper? A forced meet cute where I’m expected to be overwhelmed by the amazing scent of coffee and dick?” There was also the tiny, insignificant problem that he was dying. Yet, he didn’t feel guilty in the slightest that his bucket list did not include enacting a tragic harlequin novel by spending his last heat with the perfect Alpha. The end of the story would not be magical, containing a healing dick that abruptly rid him of palladium poisoning. Best to let Pepper have this though, he knew.
A click behind him has Tony turning. The door had blocked it before, but Tony now has an excellent view of a camera pointed at the bed, a red light blinking at him.
“Bucky, I– I have some questions.” There’s no need to corner Bucky; they’ve been friends for so long, and with Bucky on the mend, there’s more between them than there had been when they were so young and in the midst of war. Yet, he corners him anyway after a training session.
“So you did something stupid, and you’re here to try and un-stupid yourself. What’d you do?” Trevor sounds accusatory.
“It’s not about what he deserves. Not for me, you, or Tony. It’s about what he wants, Steve, and that’s something you can’t provide him with.”
“Nope.” Steve thinks of their tryst earlier and feels a stirring of lust for the man in front of him. The man who is doing his best to save a world that Steve doesn’t even understand quite yet. Sometimes he thinks he’ll wake up again the next time he sleeps and he’ll be back in the plane, but when he sees Tony, he feels grounded.
It’s late now, sometime after ten when he gets back to the tower. His feet lead him to Tony’s workshop yet again, and from the door, he can see that Tony is sprawled out on his couch, arms askew. Steve goes back up to grab a blanket and takes it back down to the workshop. As he approaches Tony, he hears the other man mumble in his sleep. It’s...sweet.
“I’m a Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. I think I’m qualified enough to say that he should have held his fire.” Tony can feel Cap’s breath on his forehead, they’re so close, and he can’t help it. His nostrils flare and take a drag of the air, hoping to catch Alpha scent, but Cap’s wearing the good suppressants, and he only gets a whiff of beta. And Cap— Cap returns the favor, tilting his head and leaning forward. Tony is frozen, his inherent drive as an Omega pressuring him to
“It’s premature, but I think Tony’s brain thought it was drifting with a second person… all the time. So naturally, his brain wouldn’t take the full neural load until his partner dialed in. This is
“Personality overview. ‘Mr. Stark displays compulsive behavior.’ In my own defense, that was last week. ‘Prone to self-destructive tendencies.’ I was dying. I mean, please. Aren’t we all? ‘Textbook narcissism?’ In an Omega? Well, agreed. Okay here it is. ‘Recruitment assessment for Avenger Initiative. Iron Man? Yes.’ I gotta think about it.”
biology. He was– he identified as an alpha. Not omega. Absolutely not. No matter if Steve was about to put him down and mount him, he would always be Tony Stark, alpha. And further, maybe he’d always cherished the idea of finding a romantic partner, not someone who looked down on him like Steve.
“I would take a deeper look at the assets, however. Those won’t go with you if you instigate divorce, though you’ll be left with a settlement out of it, and not an insignificant one.”
“Ride me then. Show your alpha how good you are,” Steve says, curving his arms back to rest under his head and watching Tony with hooded eyes. Tony sits up, hands pressed against Steve’s stomach, as proud as though lit from the inside, expanding and bright with triumph. Steve knows that Tony’s hole is fucked open, waiting for his cock, and Tony obliges, sliding down him sharper than a blade.
Steve walks around for a while, noting everything that’s changed in his neighborhood. The butcher shop on the corner is now home to a 7-11 convenience store. There’s a new building right next door that looks less modern than Tony’s building, but still has some of the elements that Steve has only found in this day and age. One thing that remains, however, is the church he and his Ma used to go to. The Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary looks a little more modern with its lights and the school next to it, but it’s still the same church. He remembers Reverend James Carroll, who was always kind to him.
“Can I mark you?” Steve asks, tentative. The idea of Tony wearing his scent has his cock twitching, ready for more whenever Tony will allow it.
“—after your twenty-two spankings.” Tony stops and throws out a hand to steady himself on the wall before turning around and leaning against it.
“Let’s get this over with.” At that, Rhodes blasts his repulsors at Steve. And Steve just– takes it. Feels his nerves frying under the fire, rabidly painful. Penance is something you do when you’ve sinned, so instead this is payment. For using Rhodes’s trust to gain access to what he wanted. The cost going into it was always a known quantity.
“Yeah Cap? I’ll be honest, this is a dream come true for me. If I had a camera and less of a moral imperative to preserve your dignity, I’d have so many pictures of your all-american ass and cock right now. But I’ve been good. Don’t you think I’ve been good, Steve?”
But, amazingly, there’s also a sense of relief at the idea that it’s just sex. The wolf doesn’t want to rip him to shreds, or it already would have. Tony can always get back to camp and clean up the bite mark. It may be dark all around him, but he’s sure that he can just go the direction he came from and find where he’s supposed to be. Hope curls through him, and he tries to shunt all the other sensations he’s experiencing away. He just has to endure. No matter how sick and wrong this is, it
“Yeah, he does that. He’s a good man.” Steve thinks of Tony in his workshop, working away on software like this.
“You’re going to have to make me Steve. Make me, I dare you!” Steve closes the distance, which is smaller than he suspected, and grasps at Tony’s shoulders. Tony grabs his arms, holding tight to the tense biceps underneath.
“Hey, it’s no worry, Tony. It’s not your problem, and we’ll figure it out eventually. Hopefully sooner rather than later.”
“Well, I can help with that. Father Jacobs, we can take it from here.” Father Jacobs pats him once on the arm and leaves, leaving Steve alone with these omegas who are examining him speculatively.
“We get it Cap, you care deeply about the things that you care about. But it’s not my fault you won’t completely move into the tower like the rest of the team where we train. Keep staying in your shitty Brooklyn apartment, but don’t call it my problem when the best workout you get is destroying SHIELD property.”
“Fury isn’t going to be mad if I don’t make an appearance. He’ll understand.” Tony tries to back up, dragging his feet on the ground as the other two pilots begin to drag him.
“Shh, that’s right, you’re so good, my perfect omega, so perfect.” Tony keens, and Steve watches tears leak out of the corner of his eyes. “It’s ok, I’ll take care of you. I’ve got you.” Steve doesn’t want to remove his hands from Tony’s shoulders, so he leans down and kisses the tears away, one and then the other.
He pays cash for the blankets and pillows. He doesn’t want any trail leading to these purchases. Bottled water, other snacks, and ample towels join the mix of soft things Steve buys for his Omega’s nest. Other than that, Steve meticulously washes each item, using the least scented laundry detergent he can find that’s designed for Omegas and their sensitive skin and nose.
“Come join me in the nest. I’m going to sleep here tonight and the next, until the heat comes. I’ve been running cold the past few days and it’d be nice to feel warm again.”
What comes out of the hole is like that first initial fear Tony had when he saw the fossil. And it gets worse from there. The metal plating on it should preclude it from flying, but it operates as if swimming through the air is as easy as water.
“This is the one I picked because it’s as humiliating as you swearing all the time is. The punishment fits the crime.”
“Thank you for sharing Angela,” Natasha says, breaking him from his thoughts. He can smell the fear in Angela, but the determination as well. Trevor sits silent at her side, his hand on her shoulder.
The ceremony is done in a small room at SHIELD with a two-way mirror and a justice of the peace. Gray walls surround them and seem to enclose them in a muffled and stuffy manner. Tony is there, his back rigid with tension, neck bare and exposed. He’s in the same crumpled three-piece suit he was in yesterday, as if he couldn’t bother to put on new clothing for this.
“Edith is one. As you probably guessed. But the other two are Brenna and Colleen. I knew them, back when I lived in Brooklyn Heights. Brenna… died of a suicide and Colleen was institutionalized several times. They were so brave, and I never knew.”
“These things aren’t reacting to tranquilizer darts effectively at all. I’ve got it hit with the stuff we would use to keep Cap knocked out and it’s hardly making a dent.”
It’s while he’s sitting there that he notices the smell has changed. Tony has undone his tie and is scratching at his neck, right over the gland.
“Sir.” A disembodied voice comes from the ceiling and Steve ducks slightly as if something might come swooping towards him.
He pulls off and stares at the wet hardness before he refocuses on Tony’s face. The man is open-mouthed, breathless. Unfortunately, his face isn’t red with exertion and otherwise, there’s no sweat clinging to his brow, which is furrowed with concentration.
Anger, like putrid bile, rises in his throat. He’s enraged at Fury, at this fucking bureacratic machine that has never cared for its heroes, at himself.
“We have contracts for production of armor and vehicles, not bribes! Now, that whole thing with Christine Everhart?”
Steve approaches tentatively, looking for a way to speak with the man. Thankfully he’s telegraphed his intentions well enough and the man he’s now sure is a priest makes his way over.
“You don’t know. You don’t know how I am,” Tony protests. He wants Steve so badly, it aches. He knows that Steve isn’t
Steve comes to stand in front of Tony, who is holding his body tense, glass clutched in hand as he sips from it.
Is it so wrong that he wants more than a furtive handjob in the locker room? He doesn’t deserve it, but his heart aches for it to be more.
“Well, I don’t have any other explanation for it. But it’s no matter. I’m going to take some stabilizers, knock it out of my system.” It’s matter of fact and Steve clenches his fists.
“No. There was a cellist, I think.” He knows. Tony plays pensive nonchalance, unwilling to engage with Cap more than necessary.
Because that’s the crux of it. Anthony is everything Steve has been taught that an omega without guidance is, and that’s a problem. Steve grasps at his face, rubbing circles under his already bagged eyes. He’s been going over this for a week now.
Tony first goes for the eggs, cracking them on the counter in a messy crunch that leaves flakes of shell all over, including in the eggs themselves. Then he doesn’t use oil in the pan, using a fork to mix the eggs up, which Steve knows scrapes the non-stick off the pan itself and into the eggs.
The mug clattered to the floor, handle cracking off and tumbling towards toe-kick of the island. There wasn’t much coffee left, but what was remaining had Jackson Pollack’d the entire side of the cabinetry, brown little streaks racing their way down to the bottom.
But it doesn’t seem to matter, as he watches his limbs thin out, his fingers retract up into stubby toes while his organs rearrange themselves. His bones don’t seem to break so much as shrink, which makes him think there’s some sort of magic involved, rather than biological process. He’s always hated magic, because it’s not real. This shouldn’t even be real.
“It’s too late. She can’t stop now.” Selvig is turned around, and Tony can see the offshoots of sparks stemming from the machine before them. It would be beautiful, fantastic, if it were only the science to be concerned about. Spinning in place, the electric arcs look as though they’re getting stronger and more focused.
Now that Tony had time and distance from the events in New York, he knew the look Steve had given him over shawarma was the full force of America’s disapproval. Steve didn’t like the way Tony handled missions. Didn’t like it when he got injured. Always found time to try and bother Tony, as if he had a homing beacon for wherever Tony was.
“Don’t make a scene. I’ve been fine without you for years. I’ve dealt with the Tiberius Stone’s of this world as long as I’ve been alive. Why would you assume you knew better than me? What is it with you and your abiding sense that you always know what’s best for me even though you never ask?” Tony sounds congenial and casual as he hisses these words at Steve. No one else can hear them amongst the crowd, and Tony keeps smiling as if everything is alright.
“Show some respect.” The Captain is apoplectic, and it’s glorious. Tony swears he’s seconds away from stomping and gesticulating. Or maybe he’s one of those guys that gets even more self-contained. Tony doubts it. He thinks Cap wants to tussle. A stray thought about how fun it would be to be pinned by all that power invades his mind, and he tells his inner Omega to shut its trap.
“I needed something on one of the other floors, and I stopped by to see Pepper.” Steve doesn’t know why he feels such relief. But the idea of Tony going and meeting another alpha, or anyone to be immoral with, leaves him feeling out of sorts. Tony is
“Gonna fuck you full of my cum. Know you need it. Want to get you ready for me.” With that, Steve dives for his body again, and Tony is sure that he’s going to disappoint him with using his tongue when Tony
“Oh, Stevie. You have to talk to him.” The devastated look on Bucky’s face causes Steve to look out the window of the diner towards the tower.
“It’s almost over Steve. And honestly, I really don’t want to hear it from you. Can you just come, please?” Tony does not want Steve here, at all. But he doesn’t feel like he has a choice. He feels warm all over, but maybe that’s just nervousness at how stupid this whole situation is. Another thing the Orion woman mentioned was that you just can’t trust anything that came from a completely different evolutionary branch than yourself. STIs were more treatable and easily identified in humanoid to humanoid transferences. You can trust a tentacle as far as you can throw it.
Once again, a conversation that should have resolved this between them, made better, has driven a wedge in once more.
“He was an idiot.” Rogers brows furrow, and he looks hurt in a way that encompasses more than the conversation. Like he wants to get along with Tony but doesn’t know how.
“I get it, yeah. You wanted to help. To be a part of something. And the world kept telling you that you couldn’t. Couldn’t join the army. Couldn’t have a normal life. Couldn’t help nor save your mother. And that got to you. It’d get to anyone. But what you don’t understand is that you’ve always been strong despite those things. The most important strength has nothing to do with our bodies, not really. It’s what we carry with us that helps us endure the hard times. And I think somewhere, you forgot it wasn’t about your gender. Do you think that’s about right?” Steve’s throat is dry and he feels once more like he’s about to cry. He’s punished everyone around him, every omega, for the fact that he felt weak. He survived Erskine’s experiment when he was an omega. It had nothing to do with his gender. It never did. His being alpha may have changed who he would be with ultimately, but it hadn’t changed him. What he’d done to himself, the things he’d chosen to believe, they were ultimately the culmination of every injustice his weakened body had heaped on him. And instead of being strong, Steve had broken, and began to believe something false. He felt so stupid. Craven, even. How could he justify this to himself any longer?
“I’m so selfish Steve. You’re going to find that out. But just remember that you wanted this, before you knew anything else.” Steve gazes up at Tony, who looks inscrutable, distant. Steve just wants him to come back down to earth, to where Steve dwells, if only for a moment before he becomes the sun Steve orbits once again.
And then there’s Steve. Steve, who he loves, who has hurt him but has come back and achieved Tony’s forgiveness. They’ve spent so much time together, knowing each other so intimately before they ever had a romantic moment.
When at least, Steve loses his iron control, he sinks home into Tony’s greedy ass, eliciting a groan from Steve and the barest of whimpers from Tony. Steve snaps his hips, once, and slowly withdraws to snap them again, and Tony’s heat croons, dark and sweet, that this is the way of things. His base, Omegan desires, Steve’s cock rutted into him, a hole to be used, a womb to be bred.
But Steve wasn’t looking at him. No, Steve was focused on the front of Tony’s pants, where Tony suddenly realized he had a full-on erection straining to escape.
He’s also going to go through Tony’s closet, but that can wait for another day. In the meantime, when he gets inside, he explores the tower. It’s huge, sprawling, and unnecessary. But there’s nothing Steve is going to do about it, given that Tony only takes up a small portion of the penthouse itself. Steve also moves his clothes into the room next to Tony’s, which is a meager amount. But he doesn’t need much.
“Weird? Yeah, well, yeah, weird like.” Pepper backed away and wiped at her face, looking downward in awkward embarrassment.
“I… made a mistake, and my husband ended up hospitalized. The team—the team isn’t on speaking terms with me for the most part.”
“Um, I feel foolish talking about it. I mean, I feel just as horrible as those alphas in your stories. I don’t know where the line between them and myself begins and ends,” Steve says.
It’s easy, drifting off like that as he listens to the soft grunts and huffs of breath of the man behind him. Tony is looking off to the right, towards the door when he shifts position to the left to get more comfortable.
Bolstered by Tony’s response, Bucky presses just a bit closer to Tony and begins to rub in earnest. Tony can feel the heat emanating behind him, and he tries not to think about how close Bucky is.
Steve wants to go back into the ice. He wants to un-fly the plane. He wants to go to Brooklyn, find Edith, and take her away. If only he had known. But he hadn’t wanted to see, not at all. All the fine pieces of his conscience grate and grind at him. Conall had been a firm man, someone he’d not necessarily looked up to, but Steve had thought he was a good one. One of the good ones. Steve hadn’t known what lurked underneath that surface. That he’d lay a hand to his omega to hit. That he’d take his omega against her will.
“Want your— children, Steve. Want you— to fuck them into me.” The words are broken by Steve’s thrusts. Steve feels almost helpless as he nails Tony once, twice, and three times before he pushes in as deeply as he can go, and
“You want me–like that?” Even after everything, his Tony is still so insecure that it makes Steve’s heart ache. Tony was never so vulnerable as an Alpha, but being Omega shouldn’t make Tony feel so down on himself, which means that Tony always felt this way. Steve is going to dedicate so much of his time to building his precious Omega up so that these utterances are a distant memory. Tony should be treated with reverence and cherished.
“Tony,” he bites out. “And I’m fine. Go.” Cap gives him a longing look of regret, before jogging off somewhere in the maze of the helicarrier. If Rogers is the type to have remorse, he should have thought of that before he treated Tony like a stereotype from the 40s.
“Doctor Banner… Put down the sceptre.” As he looks at Banner, he thinks maybe the Star Spangled man might be right. Tony the Omega is selfish, self-interested, wealthy and spoiled. He hasn’t yet changed the world, or made up for delivering death to lesser developed nations on a near daily basis. Hasn’t made up for trusting Obie. For being so— so him, that not even Pepper would forgive his lies to himself and others.
“All yours Steve, make me yours. Yours, god!” He doesn’t know what he’s saying now, but he knows he will die if Steve isn’t inside him. He’ll shrivel into space, a black hole eating everything he is until he’s nothing.
Honestly, he was surprised they got it all in here on time for the event. Seeing the same old routine of decor and dresses made Tony feel like somewhere, someplace, Loki had never happened.
He clenches and unclenches his hands. Steve is still somewhere in the building. He could go get him. He could run out and find his Alpha, tell him he didn’t mean it.
“So you’re going to take his choice away?” Bucky’s voice is flat, and Steve knows he’s treading on unsteady ground. What Hydra did to Bucky was awful, but at the end of it, Bucky has come out stronger and more balanced than the man he once knew in the 40s. It’s more than a silver lining; Bucky is free. Like Steve was made free when Erskine used the formula on him.
“My story is a bit more complicated. I’m Angela, by the way. My alpha at the time didn’t start off as bad as all that. He never forced me to do anything. I worked; it’s not illegal for me to have a job, but all the money I made went to a joint account with him. I never saw a dime of it. But I didn’t need to at the time, you know?”
“Fuck you.” Tony spits at him, a glob of saliva landing on Steve’s cheek. He drags it off with his fingers and licks them clean before diving for Tony’s mouth. His lips are heaven, pillowy, even in their narrow tightness. Tony can’t hide what a lovely darling he is from Steve, even when his sass is at its utmost level. Enraptured, he pulls back to look at Tony’s blown-out pupils and heaving chest. Fuck, his lover is beautiful, all velvety skin and fight.
“Natasha? It’s Steve.” He paused, waiting for her to say that she didn’t want his call or that he was barking up the wrong tree, whatever it was that he wanted.
Steve is left trying to think about how things have changed so much. He’s so tired of everything that’s new and loud in his ears and eyes. He doesn’t want to think of Tony, but when he finally pushes those thoughts away, he feels cold inside.
“Yes, Sir.” Tony doesn’t ever remember programming JARVIS with disappointment, but that’s what he thinks he hears in his AI’s voice.
When JARVIS unlocks the door, it immediately opens and Steve strides through with a momentum that makes Tony think he was pacing just outside it.
Tony is a splintered mess under him, tacky and drying cum over his abdomen, and he’s also the most gorgeous thing Steve has ever seen in his life. Tony is his now, precious, and cared for, loved beyond reason.
He’ll have Tony, whole and complete, whether Tony puts up a fight or not. He wants to swallow Tony whole, to consume every bit of what he squeezes out of his mate. All he needs is time.
The wolf nips him on his ass and Tony cries out again, trying desperately to hold back, but finding it impossible.
They all go stock still when they see him, their eyes watching him as if he’s going to make some kind of stray movement towards them.
“But what if I didn’t.” He says in a tone that might be better suited to someone being held over a fire. She shakes her head.
“But you are. Clothes, on.” Tony glares up at her from his place on the floor. But Natasha takes no shit, stomping over to his closet and wrenching the doors wide open, tossing a clean shirt at him along with some socks, boxers, and a neatly folded pair of pants. Pants that Steve had folded.
“Selling parts.” Andorians are also short and sweet speakers, never adding anything unnecessary. Did Tony mention he loves Andorians? They’re mostly human-looking, except for the fact that they’re blue with white hair and have two antennae that peek out from the top of their bangs. Tony has long since gotten over insignificant differences such as the color of someone’s skin or whatever weird things they have on their face. Not to mention the variety of dick and vagina he’s seen. It’s enough for a lifetime and has quite possibly made his sexuality broader than any one human has ever been before.
He was still going to have to get him back though for crashing his birthday party that had mostly been filled with people he couldn’t give a rat’s ass about. Hashtag Let Iron Man Pee. It had been an urgent mystery that wasn’t going to solve itself! Yet the look on Pepper’s face as he made a fool of himself, of Iron Man, in front of a crowd of coked up strangers wasn’t leaving his brain. Granted, Tony had spent some time out of the suit, to give credence to the narrative that he wasn’t Iron Man. But it was too opportune to not give himself a little present in the form of pretending, just for a moment, that everyone was in on his little secret.
It’s probably his alpha instincts. Instincts he never knew he had. He realizes now that so much of being an alpha was never taught to him, because he had never been born an alpha. His mother was a beta, and his father an alpha, but he died in the war. If his father had any complaints about marrying a beta woman, his mother kept that to herself. As for Steve, he doesn’t see how he could be with anyone but an omega now, with anyone besides Tony.
“You’re becoming Omega. I want you, as my mate. They think that I should be more interested in seeing you go back to being an Alpha than this–opportunity.” At Steve’s words, Tony’s whole demeanor shifts. His eyes gloss over and his lips part as he takes a step back.
A thread of guilt intrudes on his conscience, because he also wants Bucky, and it feels like a betrayal to how he feels about Steve. But he can’t help it. Steve makes him feel a light, effervescent happiness, like bubbles in wine held up against the sun. Bucky leaves him feeling like he’s dying for love, like god for a repentant sinner. He’s no closer to making a choice than he was before this all started.
“Nat—” He doesn’t know why he says anything at all. The truth is falling down on him, and he feels miserable for not seeing Nat sooner.
That’s not what’s happening here, however, and he steels himself before biting down on the firm piece of flesh. He feels it pierce and a rush of copper stains the inside of his mouth. Tony doesn’t make so much as a whimper.
Tony clutched his head, the dull ache of the poison doing what it did best. Ache. Combined with the feverish warmth of pre-heat that rippled across his skin and a whopping hangover, he didn’t feel connected to the world. Like Rhodey’s actions didn’t matter. Nothing mattered. However Rhodey attained the suit, it was best he had it.
“Even when we get home?” Just because Tony Stark has been missing for months, doesn’t mean that the journalists won’t trot out his latest mistakes as soon as the Avengers get back to earth. Steve would have to go through that, and no one wants to be associated with Tony Stark’s past.
“Hold on.” He fires into it, hitting a newly created opening into the whale’s thick flesh. It explodes, The carapace-like shell falling off the body. The Hulk howls as Tony lands next to the other Avengers.
“Rhodey this place is awful. I hate bugs. I hate dirt. And my phone isn’t getting any signal.” He passes the whiskey to Rhodey, who leans over to take it with a curve of his lips and a soft grunt.
“Oh, I see! Tony just did it to himself. Those omegas. Stubborn. Don’t know their own minds. Right?” Even Steve can see that this is a trap. He just doesn’t know what Clint is trying to say, and he’s getting mad that his values are being twisted into something they’re not. He cares for Tony, even if it’s just the way an alpha can care for an omega.
!” It’s warm inside of him, hot, burning. Deep in his core, he’s being stretched, warped. Pressure has been building, like a flood against a dam, and he’s tight with anticipation for it. Finally, finally, it releases, sweeping him in a torrential haze, so strong it makes him spasm and twitch, arching his back towards Steve.
Slowly, Steve detaches from Tony, hot and slick cock sliding out from between his lips. It’s then that Steve swipes a gob of his own cum, and rubs it into Tony’s gland. It’s soothing, sealing the bite in with scent. Tony can’t imagine what he smells like to others, but right now he knows he smells perfect. A beautiful mix of Steve and him.
“We’ll be seeing you soon, Tony,” Steve says, mischievous intent written on his face, and the two alphas leave the room, elated.
“Fuck.” Tony grabs his lab coat, and his shoes and runs barefoot out of the room, leaving Steve behind.
“Such a good boy for me. Now, you’re going to be so good, and come for your Alpha when I say.” He pulls out his fingers and uses the wet saliva to lubricate Tony’s nipples, leaving them cold points stuck in the air as his hand moves down to Tony’s stiff cock. Once he grips Tony in his hand, he pushes in all the way, the rim of Tony pressed up around the base of Steve’s already puffy knot.
“I’m here for you, Tony. I’m always here and I’d do anything for you. You won’t ever have to live in a world of inconveniences. Not while I’m around.”
“I’d like to speak to Captain America alone.” Fury eyes Tony, using a slight alpha tone. Steve sends affirmation along the bond, while Tony feels trepidation at what they’ll ask Steve to do.
“I wouldn’t cheat. I may have few other rules in life, according to you, but I wouldn’t be unfaithful as a mechanism for getting out of this marriage. It would cost me a pretty penny to divorce under those circumstances. And it’s not bad enough to warrant that, yet.” Tony shakes his head and brings his hands up to cover his eyes and run them down his face. “Can we be done with this, please.”
. Which looks good on him too, that chiseled jawline with high cheekbones emphasizing the granite-cut shape of his nose and crinkle in his brow. As he’d said, perfectly symmetrical. Blond. Gorgeous. Tony can’t resist. But he’s going to have to try, because Captain America is turning out to be Captain shitty-attitude.
“Tony hasn’t been around, has he?” She narrows in on the subject with the precision of a blade, no non-sequitur about the weather or the team. He’d give anything to have anyone else walk in, but once again everyone is either gone on a mission or in their respective favorite locations with no reason to come up to the kitchen.
“Tell me Tony, have you fantasized about this? About taking my knot?” Tony’s aborted breath is all the answer he needs. Yet, it’s important that Tony acknowledges this, so Steve lets the pregnant pause stay, waiting.
“So I have to marry this omega? You’re certain?” It’s been a surprise to everyone, including Steve, that Captain America is alive and kicking and able to fulfill contractual obligations.
“Well, I suppose it never would have worked out. I’d have to upgrade from Louboutins to Stewart Weitzman’s if you stay as my CEO?”
Tony goes back to laying down, and Steve cleans up the dishes, coming to settle in the nest with Tony, scooting close, but not quite all the way to him. He doesn’t want to spook Tony, who seems melancholic and aloof now.
Steve shifts then, his head towards Tony’s feet and vice versa. In front of him is a clothed Tony, erection straining at the fabric. He relieves him, unzipping and pulling down his pants as Tony’s cock springs up near his face. It’s also a nice shade of pink, and Steve nuzzles at the base of it, tongue darting out to lick at Tony’s balls underneath.
Of course, that’s when shit goes off the rails. And Tony had loved thunderstorms as a kid! The ship shakes from a bolt of lightning, and Tony just knows that it’s not a regular storm. When something slams onto the top of the quinjet, he figures he better let it in before it peels open the jet like a sardine can.
“I’d ask if you’re ready, but, well.” Bucky tilts his head as his lips curl. Then he’s looking down at himself, cock in hand as Tony watches him guide it to his entrance. It’s a fat cock, thicker than Steve, but just a tiny bit shorter. It’s going to batter his prostate as effectively as Bucky’s fingers, he can already tell.
“P–please, can’t–can’t breathe! I’m leaking, and it’s so warm, Steve!” Tears are trickling down the sides of Tony’s face as Steve leans down and wipes them away.
“Tomorrow I’ll be distributing Extremis for free wherever I am. Catch me on Castro Street!” The cheer that goes up from the audience fuels Tony. He has to admit that he deserves the adulation of the masses.
He scoops it up, constricting Tony’s jaw with the other hand, pressing and pressing until Tony opens and he piles the cum back in before closing Tony’s jaw again, pinching his nose and waiting. The sheer panic in Tony’s eyes hurts him, but this is part of the process. Tony needs to swallow, to take Steve in.
“I got out though. After years of Conall punishing me for something or other by tying my leash to the bed and tying my hands behind my back. More fool he, I’d been slipping that leash at home since he got me to marry him. He used to be kind, Conall. He used to like me singing. But after we went home, he told me that my voice was for him, and he didn’t want anyone else to hear it. So I stopped, but for church. And even then, he didn’t like that either. It was the church that helped me get out, you know. They knew people. People that could help.”
“I’ve never seen anything like it, he has antibodies that are gobbling the virus up. It’s accelerating from an hour ago when there were fewer of them. He’s going to heal completely, I think. The virus is lodged in the nerve cells, but this could send it into remission. I’d give him something to stimulate the virus so it can be completely killed, but I think he’ll stay in remission indefinitely.”
“Let’s say you’re right. You think I should be doing something other than what I am with my Extremis.” Tony stays where he is, lingering over the bottle of liquor.
“I’m Father Jacobs. Not sure I’ve seen you here before. Welcome! Is there something I can help you with?”
“I would make the world for you, Tony. I saw what they took from you, and I took it back.” The earnest light in Steve’s sunrise-blue eyes wraps around him, heavy and indolent. They each move in tandem, Steve swinging his body around the island and Tony meeting him as his chair scrapes at the ground. They don’t clash so much as seal together like the reverse of a flower’s blooming, the petals of their bodies slotting so perfectly into alignment.
“God, you’re terrible at stories. I’d prefer to get laid.” Tony chomps down the moment he realizes what he’s said. His whole body tenses and he turns his head jerkily towards Steve, trying to take back what he’s just said with his eyes.
“You need three solid meals a day, and while one is from work, you are also expected to make something for yourself in the morning. If you wanted to make more than that for both of us, I won’t stop you.”
If Tony had asked for his knot for treatment would Steve have given it to him? Yes, he thinks he would have. And it bothers him that it wouldn’t have been a hardship for him to do so.
Tony flips the paper over, knowing full well there’s nothing on the other side yet nonetheless feeling as if he has to follow the motions of investigation lest his eyes water and the tears fall.
He pulls off and rolls to his feet, leaving Tony’s legs spread and his cock looking debauched with saliva. It lays flat on his stomach, twitching and shiny, the swollen head leaking a lazy stream of precum.
It makes a pretty picture in his head when he imagines Steve pressed up against him, lips working at his neck. Finally Steve starts to shift, his large body spreading out more comfortably on top of Tony’s. Steve must not trust him yet, not that Tony disagrees. He responds by pressing his ass into Steve’s hardened cock, whining.
“I will. And thank you, again.” Steve feels like a burden he’s been carrying has been lifted. The catharsis is profound. He hasn’t apologized to Tony yet, but he feels like he can. Like things can possibly be okay.
Thor confirms his suspicions that messing with powerful objects nets you powerful enemies while Steve states the obvious questions. Nick defends himself with altogether lame-ass excuses about having his hands forced, something, something deterrents. Yup, as if someone personally stuck their hand up Fury’s ass and used him like a puppet to make a weapons program.
Contrary to outside expectations, Tony isn’t so narcissistic that he doesn’t pay attention to what’s around him. Sunny San Francisco is his today, and tomorrow? Who knows. He could be in every major city. But to do that, he’s got to deal with SHIELD. Which is not a problem, at least it fucking wasn’t until SHIELD used the cosmic cube to bring back a young and unfairly beautiful Captain America into working order once more.
. So perfect and amazing, and everything Tony has ever believed him to be. How could Tony not care for him?
Steve has been solicitous. An endless stream of protein bars have been held to Tony’s mouth while Tony sat in Steve’s lap, pinioned by Steve’s knot. The wrappers line the floor along with the empty water bottles.
Tony pauses, examining each of them. Steve is wearing his too-tight white shirt and running pants combination, looking oddly out of place with his bare feet. His muscles ripple as he clenches his hands together and there’s a tweaking movement in Steve’s jawline that Tony registers as similar to the anxiety that Steve displays when they’re in the field.
