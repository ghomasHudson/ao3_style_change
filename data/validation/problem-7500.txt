Translation for Tony's Spanish line: “No, hey mom, I'm hanging up. This guy's really hot. Yeah—bye, mom."
“If his flights match the pattern of disappearances and TODs, I’ll get you a list of places he’s been to,” Tony waved off Natasha’s perfectly reasonable point. “Let Steve ask him about the same destinations on their dates; any indication that he’s traveled to and from the city in your time frame, you’ll have enough to pull his travel records.”
“Rangers, of course,” Steve replied, “they often choke, but they’re good to watch.”
Over at his desk, Bruce was too jittery to find any peace, with or without his enormous mug of Mellow Fellow green tea. He shuffled papers around, watered his desk plants, and skimmed work related messages with unseeing eyes before giving up and crossing the room from his feng shui appropriate half to the half Tony had littered with health risk violations and vulgar 21st century memorabilia.
Steve blinked at him, stunned. Then, after a long, pregnant silence, he snorted loudly to himself and facepalmed, hiding his face and muffling his laughter in one big palm.
“Then what are you waiting for, sweetheart?” Steve asked, breathless in his excitement. He didn’t dare laugh, because what if he was wrong? Hell, what did it matter? “You won’t know until you answer it.”
“How about, I’ll ask you a question,” Tony said with a simple, matter of fact tone. “And for every answer you get right… I’ll take one piece of clothing off.”
“Why’d you stop there?” he wondered when Steve let him keep his t-shirt on. He kicked off his boots and trailed Steve into the kitchen, where he accepted the cup of hot tea Steve pressed into his hand without question.
“Why’d you want to be a schmuck like them?” Maria asked without missing a beat.
The next morning, Tony found Steve dressed in his uniform and sitting on his couch, stress knitting. Eight or nine thick, woolen socks of varying colors already littered the coffee table, and it looked like he was working on to a checkered blanket when Tony found him.
“Chief, who the fuck is digging through my stuff and what the hell is going on?”
“Am I dreaming?” he had asked first, still daring to hope he was wrong.
uh but what about
Jane long, silent stare made it clear just how unimpressive his lack of attention was.
“Mine,” he hissed against Tony’s ear with Tony’s earlobe captured between his sharp teeth, punctuating his claim with a forceful snap of his hips. “Don’t you forget.”
When Steve shook his head no, Tony briefly excused himself to find a bite to eat.
Miriam turned her attention to Channing and, without shame or apology, said, “Darling, I’m 72… I don’t know about dancing and songs, but I am sure you are highly admired.”
“Where is Tony?”
“I’m glad you called, Steve. I had a good time last night.”
Loose-limbed and naked but for his swim trunks, Steve should have been the worst distraction imaginable. But as much as Tony wished he could join his husband in the hot water and powerful jets, Steve’s presence was also a comfort to Tony’s impatient excitement. He could work and at any minute glance up assure himself that Steve relaxed peacefully, assure himself that Steve was contended and smiling.
, consequences be damned.
“Wow,” Steve murmured, brows furrowing a little in concern. “Everything alright?”
“Let me take you for a coffee, Tony,” he said, keeping his voice soft, a gesture of intimacy and a measure of precaution so his voice wouldn’t carry on the wind. “Celebrate the new job. This weekend?”
Steve’s first coherent thought was that Tony really did smell nice. He groaned softly then, and when Tony whispered kindly-worded apologies and praise for what Steve had done, Steve decided to kick it up a notch, from confused groaning to plaintive moaning.
And finally, after decades of dreaming about debauching his hero to study his magnificent alien cock - for science, of course - Tony had the chance to live out that dream with
“No, mom, of course not,” Steve eventually said with a tired sigh. “Just, no money talk, and—please, mom. No questions about family planning. We’ve only been dating four months. But I’ll talk to Tony tomorrow, okay? We’ll see if we can’t find time for dinner sometime soon.”
His phone call momentarily forgotten, Tony sat up straight at his desk. “What did the good doctor say?”
“Patiently!” Steve called back over his shoulder. “What grown man can’t wrap a birthday present?” he muttered to Tony, who snickered quietly in his amusement. “Anyway, sweetheart, just—if it’s not a good time, we can reschedule. Or, you really don’t have to do this. Not the field trip, not the mother.”
He spent thirty seconds deciding on whether or not to wear his belt buckle. But in the end, Steve had said he liked it, so he couldn’t resist.
“For lions, that’s what matters,” Tony said with a smile. “But what is important to any animal depends on many things. For lions, the males need to be strong, but that’s not true for all animals. Male birds, for example, have evolved to dance and sing, to build nests, and to have beautiful feathers, like the peacock. What they have in common is why they do it: they want to have babies, they all want to be dads.”
“If you desperately need to, you can fuck them; get it out of your system,” Tony said with a dismissive wave of his hand. “But not in our bed! And only once.”
Steve took a deep, calming breath. “My name is Steve,” he said. “Tony’s worked all day. I can help.”
Steve should have let him go, but somehow, that was no longer a choice he was willing to make.
“Leave the cleaning with me,” Steve reiterated, “and I’ll make the rolls.”
“I haven’t accepted,” Steve said in calm, measured words. “I don’t know if I’m right for the job. Rhodes has been on the team longer, and Barton can see everything, from anywhere on the field, he’d be great—”
As soon as he reached them, Tony leaned into Steve’s space and softly whispered hello. “So, was it a good surprise?” he murmured playfully, and went willingly when Steve pulled him in for a slow, indulgent kiss.
Howard gave Steve an unimpressed once-over when he stepped out onto the porch.
Behind him, the morality box buzzed to life again, but Rumlow ignored it and turned to look at the four cops approaching him instead. They carried glow sticks, and Brock tilted his head thoughtfully as he considered their soft blue tint. Electronic stun batons.
Tony had forgotten something back at his place and promised to meet up with Steve as quickly as he could. They were going to dinner; he asked Steve to wait for him at the bar, relax after a long day. Steve had been given a key when he checked in at the desk, but he had no interest in seeing the room without Tony. Instead, he handed his things off to the concierge, who were kind enough to take his duffle and his portfolio up to the suite. Tony had said he wouldn’t be long, so Steve took his advice to sit at the bar, where he could enjoy the calm and nurse his beer until Tony got there.
“We might as well go looking for her,” Tony replied, and Steve’s smile burgeoned into a soft laugh that left Tony’s heart doing silly things. He could feel his cheeks warming so he quickly turned his attention away. His phone was the first thing Tony saw, so he picked it up and pretended he needed to look at the map.
“Can’t believe it took me divorcing my wife to find you,” Bucky laughed wetly, then quickly stepped back to scrub at his eyes with the back of his hands. “Fucking hell. This—”
Steve was moving on to the kitchen, where a good camera could be positioned to record the dining room, when Bucky called him back.
“Never could I have imagined your legendary accomplishments could be true, Steve Rogers, but now you are before my eyes and there is no other truth. With your help, I have no doubt we will soon apprehend the cruel maniac,” Tony rushed to say between his gulping breaths, “it is only a matter of time before we all can witness you blow him off!”
“Mellow apologies for my lack of physical disposition, Captain. I have an entire city to govern, it is frightfully consuming business.”
Steve watched with a somewhat glum expression as Tony undid his belt and started on his pants. Those were all the duties he wanted to be in charge of. “I kind of wish you could keep that belt on,” he admitted with a wry smile.
Steve reached up to tuck some of Tony’s hair behind his ear, then gently cupped his cheek, as if all he wanted was to hold him steady and cherish the look of him. Moments passed in silence between them, and Steve’s open reverence  had color rising in Tony’s cheeks, until Tony could no longer resist the urge to duck his head and hide his blush. But Steve wouldn’t let him get away with hiding; he swept his thumb over Tony’s cheek, urging him to look up, then pushed up to meet Tony halfway as he pulled him in for a kiss.
“Uh, Stark? He—”
Tony lasted all of five minutes without his phone.
Sharon took a deep breath and tried to stop herself herself from saying anything regrettable.
“If that’s how you react to flowers, babe,” he whispered hoarsely against Steve’s panting lips, “show me what you can do with me.”
“And definitely don’t get smart.”
But 007 was a professional, and unlike his Steve, who had barely lasted a few minutes their first time together, Bond was still actively unraveling Belova. If she was on her second orgasm at the start of the performance, Bond had yet to even the score in the twenty minutes Tony and all around him had been listening. The realization left Tony huffing a laugh of relief and rolling his eyes at his damn lizard brain. Bond was a professional, an accomplished assassin and a willing whore for the crown. There was no question which man was better, not for Tony: he would choose his Steve any day. The way Steve treated Tony made him feel special and adored, a desirable, intoxicating lover unlike anyone Steve had met. And he did it without the lies and tricks that Bond used to attract the men and women he bedded.
Steve’s sudden urgency alarmed Tony into reflexive action. Without thinking, he pulled the car to the side of the road and switched on the hazard lights. They were still only minutes from Pierce’s offices, and Tony opened his mouth to ask what had happened, if perhaps Steve had forgotten his gloves or if he was suffering another panic attack at the thought of a repeated prison sentence. As before, Steve held his tongue, and without a word, he climbed out of the vehicle.
He blindly walked around his office to grab his computer bag when the door gently closed behind him.
He deposited the human in his sleeping nest when he first got home, unwrapping him from the blankets he had carried him away in like a birthday gift. The sweat had dried from his skin or been brushed away by the bedsheets while Steve carried him, but Steve couldn’t resist staring at Tony’s naked body with a possessive hunger now that he was first laid out before him. With gentle hands, he squeezed and caressed Tony’s inner thighs, marveling at how easily he reacted and obediently spread his legs. Steve brushed his fingers over the delicate skin of his balls, rolling them tenderly in his hand as he mused over just how something so fragile, and much smaller than Steve’s fist, could be so potent and valuable.
Tony took a deep breath, then slowly let it out through his nose. “I don’t mean to blame my actions on others. This was my fault, I know that. I can only promise that there is nothing and nobody that could make me make that mistake again. I don’t know how to prove it to you without a chance to show you, except to say, on Rhodey’s life, I will not keep important things from you again.”
“Was that why you laughed at me?” Steve hissed, sitting up straight to use his height and size advantage to glare down at Tony with all his raging resentment. “When we got out of Dr. Odinson’s office—”
“Don’t even think about it, Rogers,” Tony warned him as Karl cleared his throat and prepared for the next question.
“First class, but I couldn’t get two aisle seats. You’re sitting next to each other,” she said without so much as pausing at the change in topic. “I called ahead to confirm a luxury four-wheel SUV. I requested a Range Rover, but it will depend on what they have. It is Kansas, sir.”
Tony squeezed it in return and brought Steve’s hand to his lips, pressing a kiss to his knuckles.
“Tony, Clint’s worked all day, you’re on hay duty with me.”
He only meant to deliver the plate then go back to get his own food going, but Tony was frowning down at his phone in a way that made Steve want to distract him. He had no interest in the phone, but he couldn’t resist sneaking in close to indulge in a moment of intimacy, first pressing a loving, unhurried kiss to Tony’s shoulder, then trailing a few more up his shamefully unblemished neck. Tony curled his free hand around the back of Steve’s head, holding him close and threading his fingers through Steve’s hair while Steve nuzzled into the soft junction of his neck and shoulders.
“I don’t… I really don’t know if I can do that, mom. I don’t know what I’d do without you,” he whispered unevenly, swallowing back against the lump in his throat.
Six more MDKs.
They made it to Tony’s studio. Steve had stood there in the little space that served as Tony’s living room, bedroom, and dining room while Tony filled a pint glass with water for the fresh cut flowers.
After all, a kingdom could flourish without a king, but not so without compassion. After a lifetime of work and raising her own children, Agneta had left her childhood home and learned a new language for the benefit of children far away.
“What the hell...” he started to ask, and Steve followed his line of sight to a massive pet walking beside its equally massive owner, covered in curved, jagged spikes, not unlike prehistoric shark teeth.
What had he been thinking? Steve was a good man; a man Tony should have been thrilled to date given half a chance. And here he was, actively trying to push him away for a column.
Fury’s expression twitched, but he said nothing. Hill, on the other hand, spoke without compunction.
“Only breakfast,” Steve admitted.
“Tell me,” he whispered between kisses. “Should I be jealous?”
“Fine,” Steve finally conceded with a sigh. If this was going to be a serious conversation, he could play along. “What’s your definition of death?”
This man would make a good father. This man could be it for Steve.
“Steve, darling, I’m telling you, I’ve been dreaming about those buns all week,” he admitted with a small pout and big, pleading eyes he shamelessly batted for full effect. “Please?”
“Well, yeah,” Tony answered easily, as if it wasn’t a remarkable matter; as if Steve was being weird for thinking it was remarkable in the first place. Then, he changed the subject by saying, “She said the cars are that way, come on. We’ve got a long drive.”
“Got it.”
Tony kept his hands to himself in the end, and did his best to keep smiling at Steve. “Thank, um. Thank you, I know it’s a busy day, and—”
“Is this really necessary?” Tony muttered quietly, avoiding Steve’s stare of disbelief.
“What do you think?” Tony asked as calmly as he could, though his excitement was so overwhelming that Steve could practically feel him vibrating from two feet away.
“Yeah, no, we’re definitely cutting you off for the night,” Tony decided without waiting for the answer, and he reached to gently pry the most recent cocktail out of Bruce’s hands. “Let’s—let’s get out of here, alright? Get you some fresh air, walk a little.”
“The private stairway to his office is this way, there are no cameras there. And if you see security, push me into the wall and kiss me.”
“Is that going to be a problem?”
His partner stared back at him, jaw slack and paler than he had been seconds ago. “Tony Stark,” he breathed, horrified. “Extinguished lives are ‘minor blunders’? How could you—”
“What’s going on today, Happy?” Steve had to ask once he got settled in the backseat. “It isn’t my birthday, or Tony’s birthday… it’s not our anniversary or Valentine’s. What am I missing?”
“It’s the first website that pops up when you Google gay sugar daddy,” Tony said, his words slowing the more he thought about the complication Sam brought up. “I’ll see if Preston was a past or current member on other services.”
“Sort of,” Jane said quietly, watching him carefully as if trying to decide if it was really him. Ironically, it wasn’t until Steve turned his back fully that she smiled knowingly. “Yeah, that’s him alright. He works with Thor at the hospital.”
, the guy can’t be far away. I’ll be right there, I’m just around the corner.”
Steve exhaled slow and steady around the wet and flushed head of Tony’s cock, sending a shuddering thrill of excitement through Tony’s body. Between the warm and tender sensation at the head of his cock, the rough manhandling of his drawn-up balls, and the deep, steady thrust of the thick canister, it didn’t take Tony long to come again with a choked-off cry and an aggressive thrust of his hips.
As the judge turned to ask whether those were acceptable terms, Natasha turned to confer with Mrs. Hansen. It didn’t take her long to make up her mind and reluctantly nod in agreement.
“You know… if you came on last week, we’d talk about your upcoming movie,
“Still can’t stop thinking about you on that bull last night,” Steve said quietly in the silence Tony had created. “You looked so happy. Don’t think I’ve ever seen you happier. How come you stopped competing?”
“Bears?” Tony blurted out, a little confused (and a lot amused). “What exactly do you think lives out here, Steve?”
“That is the smell of Christmas!” Steve said with a big grin, stirring the pot until it came together in a hot syrup. “Honey and lemon. We’ll fry the balls once you’re done with them and then we give them a turn in this.”
as his body accepted the full girth of intrusion. As Tony’s body finally relaxed around his fingers and tried to draw him deeper into his body with every thrust, Steve occasionally curled his fingers to tease Tony’s prostate with a light touch that left Tony gasping for air and cursing Steve with increasingly senseless expletives.
“And I will be faithful to you and only you, for as long as you will have me,“ Stephanie promised in return, and then carefully, if cautiously, she pressed her lips against Tony’s in a slow, tender kiss.
“What of the city? The survivors, the citizens, what do they need?”
“Turn on the lights, Steve,” Tony repeated in a commanding tone that had Steve biting his lip. “You come back here and fuck me, do whatever you want with me. Fill me with your come. But whatever you do,” he growled, pausing to be sure Steve was hanging on his every word. “Tonight, you keep your uniform on.”
“You are on private property,” another voice barked at them, “announce yourselves!”
“Your Honor?” he said in a sudden rush of excitement. If they could invalidate the prenup, they were back to fighting for equal division of assets and joint custody—what Tony had described as a best case scenario only hours ago. “May I approach the bench?”
“Do me a favor, Jarvis,” he murmured while skimming the remarkably eye-catching page designs. “Check security and tell me if those girls are in the building.”
He couldn’t wait to be home, but in that moment, it felt exciting to share a new experience with Tony as it happened. Except, of course, Tony was surely sound asleep in Consone, and so Steve wished him a good morning, and sent the video to start his day.
Tony knew nothing about Bond or where he kept his ledgers. It didn’t matter how many slow, shallow lines and figures she carved into his chest, Tony didn’t know. He’d never even seen Bond, he’d only spoken to him over the phone.
“Longer than you were tall then,” Rhodey recalled, as matter-of-factly as he could after three whiskeys in his system. “But whatever, doesn’t matter: while Howard’s tying the rope around the biggest ranch hand they had, Tony grabs some rope and gets in the damn river. And I’m telling you, that animal was scared; thunder, lightning, water level was rising—”
“What do we have here?”
“I’m coming, keep your pants on,” Tony drawled and climbed the stairs. Even if it wouldn’t last, he could enjoy this for what it was, right?
Tony wouldn't have much strength to stand after that, if to even stay awake. When Steve was finally done with him, he'd help Tony get fixed up as best as he could, drape him in an overcoat and take him back to his hotel.
“Now?” Tony echoed dubiously, and behind him, Natasha’s brows climbed up her forehead in surprise. “Did you pack nicer clothes with you?”
Steve couldn’t stop smiling. “I won’t see Charlie until the end of August,” Steve promised with a touch of mischief in his excitement. “You didn’t hear it from me, but maybe… maybe, you know. You’ll have something from me by then. Something even better.”
“A John Legend?” Tony repeated in case she’d misheard, but when she didn’t look any less confused, he cast around for a way to explain. “Impressive in every way, but never threatening.”
“Captain Steven G. Rogers, this imaginative display of barbaric intention was uncouth even in your time,” Pierce said with a tired sniff, “not all men lust for murder—”
“I expect the house to be spotless when I come home,” she told the three of them. “You’re adults. Divide the chores among yourselves.”
Steve’s buoyant excitement was infectious, his hope and optimistic vision for their future together so innocent and complete that Tony almost bought it, hook, line, and sinker.
“I am your king,” he said, speaking as simply and as calmly as he could while trying not to get any more of the sewage in his mouth. “I am home, and I need your help.”
“Alright, you got me. The truth is, your mom called today. She demanded that I find you, seduce you… she needs you to put a damn baby in me, stat.”
“Is a lot for anyone,” Steve filled in, gentling his words in counterpoint to Bucky’s anger. “Come on, let’s get inside.”
Steve hauled him off his feet and bodily threw Tony over his hip. With a shriek of gleeful surprise, Tony landed on his back, bouncing and laughing and reaching for Steve impatiently, and Steve wasted no time stalking after him on his hands and knees. Whispers of laughter still slipped past his lips as Tony pressed up to kiss Steve senseless, and the moment he could, Tony wrapped his legs and arms around Steve’s body to urge him down, eager as he was to feel the pressure of Steve’s mass weighing him into the mattress.
“Econ for Tuesday, art assignment due Monday, that’s almost done. Comm isn’t due until Wednesday, that one’s pretty straight-forward, but I have a test in French on Friday.”
Jane’s eyes grew to be the size of saucers, and she covered her mouth with both hands before a peep of excitement escaped her.
“It’s gonna suck, but it’ll be worth it,” Steve said to comfort him the only way he could. “You’ll be gassy and you’ll dream of food without ever wanting to eat anything ever again, because you’ll always be so full you can’t take another bite, but I heard they’re scaling you up in post, so it’ll really look great.”
Steve bit down on his lips before he either laughed or cried in her face while Tony explained that they were part of the Governor’s party. The woman completed their order, and instructed them on how to reach the glass dome and the Governor’s regular table from there.
Tony attentively watched so many familiar expressions flicker across his face—adoration, sadness, contentment—and something he couldn’t quite place that approached rueful amusement.
“Or detecting,” Bucky dropped in a stage whisper, and Rhodey fished a peanut M&M out of his snack jar and lobbed it at him. Bucky, predictably, caught it in his mouth.
He returned to Steve’s bed, and laid his head down on Steve’s pillow. It occured to Tony that soon Steve’s smell would only be a distant memory. Sleep abandoned him, and instead Tony hugged the pillow more closely, determined to indulge in every moment they had left.
“974 dollars?” Tony choked out, staring up at Steve in shock. The pure, unmitigated guilt of all the sacrifices Steve must have endured to afford this hit Tony like a punch in the gut. His heart was racing and his stomach was turning inside out, but before he could speak, Steve gently covered Tony’s lips with his hand.
“I’m agnostic!” Thor shouted back from the safety of his apartment.
Steve turned to Tony after a long conversation with Bucky and Natasha. “How’s your hand, Tony?”
Steve’s chest stuttered as he tried to take a deep breath, his breath audibly rattling in the quiet hall. “What? What does that—what happened?”
“I think my fragile ego can take it. Don’t expect me to put out on the first date just because you’re paying, though,” Steve added primly. The thieves took off across the street, and Steve slipped around the corner, smoothly pocketing his phone to fire off a tracker after the van using the multi-purpose epipen Q-branch had armed him with.
She returned his smile and wished him luck before leaving Steve to his business. Steve looked into his cart and took a steadying breath.
Obliging as always, Steve closed Tony’s shirt over his wounds, then grabbed Tony’s phone. Like all standard MI6 phones, holding down the 0 signaled an alarm and request for safe extraction. Tony just didn’t understand how Steve knew.
“I don’t know, but I think so?” Steve swallowed uncomfortably. He set down the couch and sat down on it near Tony, leaving a respectful distance between them. “I don’t have much experience. Besides kissing, I mean. But mom didn’t have serious problems, and I’m more human than dad. I have his strength and his senses, but not—I can’t fly, I don’t have heat vision or freezing breath. I don’t have x-ray vision. I can bleed.”
“Are there more puppies?” Steve wondered, and Tony immediately seconded the question. “If there are more puppies, yes, more questions.”
His hero grinned, giving Marple a last scritch behind her ears before straightening. “How about a coffee?”
Steve frowned to himself. The receptionist hadn’t said anything about dinner being brought up. He tucked a twenty under an empty glass on the bedside table then went to answer the door.
“No! That’s what anon—”
“Wait. Other animals commit rape, too?”
“You think you’ve got enough space for another puppy dog?” Georgie wondered, though it turned out to be a rhetorical question as a fat, black and white puppy with whirlwind energy was brought out for Tony.
“That’s the last thing I want to do,” Steve told him matter of factly, and in the two seconds it took Tony to climb into the loft, Steve had - true to his word - dropped his pants and climbed under the covers.
Steve blinked at the bottle in his confusion, but he accepted it anyway. “Your emergency stash?”
By the time Steve got out of his first class, his phone had blown up with messages from people who were only now catching on to the news. He deleted the voicemails Brock had left and skipped the one message from his ma for a more private occasion. There was a solid chance he might cry, and that was the last thing he needed to do in public.
“Yes, sir.”
Whatever change Tony noticed in Steve’s posture the moment he realized what was going on, he stumbled back, howling with laughter. The voice modulator, wherever it was, worked so well even his laugh was unrecognizable to Steve’s ears, but the way he laughed - the way he moved, his shameless half-dance, half-wiggle to have gotten one over on Steve - was so patently him Steve’s knees almost gave away with relief.
are ignoring her and you know she can reach me if it’s important. I am not your secretary, Steve.”
“Is it true you have operated an airplane, Captain Steven G. Rogers?” Jane asked as soon as the car doors sealed around them. “Were you up amongst the stars?”
Anybody else, and Steve would have been so happy.
Warm, lube coated fingers stroked over his spit-slick hole before slowly pressing in, first only with one gentle finger, but as he pressed enough lube into Tony’s body, Steve eased a second finger into him. In every other way they lay motionless, back to front and breathing together. Deprived of his sight, Tony’s world narrowed down to the two long, thick fingers thrusting in and out of him, patiently scissoring and stretching him open. Like this was all that mattered. Steve was devoted to his task, unhurried and thorough, despite how Tony whimpered or begged for him to get on with it, to hurry up.
His bedroom was depressing. The bed was obscenely large and low to the ground, and from his bedsheets to the only rug on the floor, everything had been decorated in some shade of grey. Steve dropped his knitting supplies on the bed and sat his bottle of water on the nightstand to inspect his closet. To his surprise, two more police uniforms already hung in there, along with a few conservative robes and kimonos for everyday use. There were towels and linens and extra blankets in the drawers, but besides the delicate, silk house robe, Steve couldn’t locate anything approaching sleep clothes or even underwear.
“With you,” Steve corrected, more quietly. Then, his expression warmed and a satisfied smirk curled his lips as he added, “Correct me if I’m wrong, but I don’t remember you ever giving up on anything that easily.”
“Computer, fiber-op Governor Alexander G. Pierce’s office and inform them of our intention to meet with the Governor,” Tony instructed the dashboard computer. “We wish to follow up on yesterday’s incident at the museum.”
“Mr. Rogers—”
“Yes, sir,” Steve agreed immediately, and this time he grabbed Sharon by the elbow and dragged her towards the door with him. “Two weeks. I’ll have it done.”
“Then why don’t you put me in my place, soldier?” Tony purred, then, as if by magic, he assumed the posture and presence of a self-made ne’er-do-well with a taste for purchased affection. “Forget the boyfriend experience, darling: if you give it to me hard and fast right here, right now, I’ll give you five big ones. All you have to do is make me come before anybody finds us.”
The resulting compromise was simple: Tony agreed to let Bucky and Steve figure out how to share Steve’s floor, and the team supported the addition of two new apartments - one for the twins, and one for regular visitors (like Sam and Scott and Hope and even Loki, of all people).
Tony picked his head up and gave Steve an uncomfortable, questioning look. “You know that’s… backwards, right?”
Tony laughed in his delighted surprise, and he stretched out on his belly over the flatbed. Without looking away from Steve’s face, he eased the head of Steve’s cock past his lips, wasting no time in slowly, carefully, easing the length of his hard cock down his throat. Steve was too thick to swallow to the root, but Tony did his best; it wasn’t until he felt Steve’s fingers in his hair that he pulled off.
Taking his words as the primal compliments they were, Steve shamelessly preened over his minor victory of reducing Tony to a state of incoherence. Almost unnoticed at first, Steve slid his fingers over Tony’s spot more boldly, more consistently, and before Tony knew what had happened, Steve’s firm massage of his prostate sent shivers down Tony’s spine and his head rolling back with pleasure.
He blinked up at the body seated at the foot of the bed. Howard? It couldn’t be. Steve and Bucky had been pallbearers at his funeral. He remembered Maria weeping, he remembered the service.
But caught as he was between the conscious and unconscious world, Tony could only lie limp and take it at Steve’s measured pace. Tony wept for begging, so desperate to free himself from the sweet, aching tension that teased and tempted him to near lunacy.
Whether someone had told Steve about his insistence on being back that night, or if he simply felt the same, he re-settled his arms around Tony’s middle to press in closer, unwilling to let him go yet.
, he needed to be used, to be bruised. To
His faith in his Queen was rewarded soon after her thirty-fourth birthday when they received news that her latest pregnancy had advanced into the twentieth week. After so many unlucky years, they were finally expecting a healthy baby boy.
“Unless the defendant attempted to contact every single one night stand and sperm donation in order to determine if a child resulted from those unions, I don’t see how he has parental claim over this child. Why this sperm? Why now? And for that matter, if any sperm emission is cause for parental rights, all acts of masturbation where his sperm was not seeking an egg could be termed reckless abandonment.”
Slowly, focusing on Steve’s hands, his thick cock, and the quiet words he whispered in Tony’s ears in encouragement helped him lose himself in his fantasy. Removed from the real and present threat of the crowd around them, he started to feel out their rhythm more confidently, experimenting with different moments to squeeze around Steve’s cock until he learned what had Steve thrusting up involuntarily. A moan spilled from Tony’s lips, and he felt as much as he heard the crowd shuffling impatiently around them.
Tony’s pinched look of irritation fell apart as he openly stared. “What—wha—I, I said seven, I thought you’d be naked. Uh, ready! Steven. Wait, that’s not your costume, is it?” he asked in minor alarm.
shit, but it is my shit—”
“Legend says there is a Last Chief,“ Clint told him, mashing the boiled turnip into oozing paste between his teeth. Tony frowned down at his own food and carefully put his fork down. There went his appetite. “She was foretold to unite all men and Women with compassion, but the Great Chief of Old turned her away into the wild as a child to prevent the prophecy from being completed.”
“Aren’t you a Fed now?” Sam said to interrupt the brewing fight. “Even if we wanted to, this isn’t your jurisdiction anymore.”
Tony didn’t know what to say. He had lost an operative, once. It wasn’t a double-oh, though somehow, he imagined that didn’t mean a damn. Watching it happen from a distance without any power to help, living in someone’s ear while they were hunted and killed - it was an experience he didn’t wish on anyone. The horror had nothing to do with titles or designations.
For a second, Steve’s gaze drifted to Tony’s ass where he was still trussed up on the counter, thighs on lewd display and Tony’s heart rate picked up with the exciting thought of Steve plugging him back up so Tony would spend the rest of the evening full of Steve’s come.
Steve groaned quietly, but eventually articulated himself with a subtle nod in the affirmative.
Tony breathed him in deeply as he settled into Steve’s easy comfort. “You did not look confused. Where were you?”
The request was unexpected, and Tony frowned to himself before glancing at Steve again. He turned the car on autopilot so that they could speak more freely.
“Hands in the air!” someone shouted, and for the first time in his life, Steve recognized the distinctive sound of two cocking rifles, something he had only previously heard in film and TV.
The answer was obvious, despite the festering voice of jealousy couldn’t help but point out how beautiful the landscape around them was. They turned off the highway mere minutes ago and already they had lost sight of civilization. Of all the reasons Benedita (or anyone else) might want to bring his handsome boyfriend out somewhere so secluded and unspeakably beautiful, how many would leave Tony happy?
It took him much longer than it had Steve, but soon he heard it, too. Footsteps. Many footsteps.
Sure why not
“You and me,” the giant growled down at Steve. “Outside, right now.”
After three years of marriage, Steve’s face and chest still flushed at unexpected flattery. It was easily one of Tony’s favorite pastimes.
“You started it,” Steve pointed out without compunction. “Accusing me of such, such atrocities on foreign soil. Can’t let that slide, Tony, I just can’t.”
Tony’s ‘final preparations’ sounded really touching at first, and out of morbid curiosity, Steve almost wanted to read what Tony had written for him.
With a smug chuckle and a playful jangle of the keys, Steve tossed him the keyring. They pulled into traffic and let the radio fill the silence. Steve knew he’d have to tell Bucky something about what he’d learned about Tony and the nurse, but how? There was no way to separate what Tony had done from the important details, and Bucky was already suspicious of Tony. Steve still didn’t know how to feel about what he’d learned. He didn’t need Bucky on his case right now.
Can’t believe you got away with a teen rating tbh
There were strict rules against the sharing of hormones in the human world, especially on duty. But Steve knew how to get the job done without opening his mouth. He let his eyes slip shut, and instead let Tony’s soft breaths, grasping fingers, and the twitching, instinctive jerks of his hips guide his movement. Unhurried, and ever so tender, Steve nuzzled up the length of Tony’s cock as it grew thicker and firmer. Tony cried out, and his hips stuttered up helplessly, desperate for friction, and Steve took immediate advantage then to press the blunt head of the canister back against the rim of his hole. This time, it took less force to ease it in, and in return, Tony eagerly squeezed around in, drawing it in deeper to his body.
To his right, both the girls were lifted onto the cushioned platform as well. Their masters didn’t seem to linger beside them like Steve did, and Tony watched them both settle down to rest, all without looking away from him in return. Maybe they hadn’t seen male humans for as long as Tony hadn’t seen their kind. How ironic that this would be how he saw a naked woman in person for the first time.
“Tonyy,” Steve complained with an insistent little wiggle of his hips. “‘s
“Tony sent me his first finished page, signed and framed,” Steve said with a thoughtful smile. “That’s been hanging in my house for a few weeks, in my office. Whenever I look at that zombie girl with pus-filled eyes eating her screaming ice cream cone, I think of you,” he told Tony with a fluttery sigh of romance.
Natasha stepped away from the group and without a thread of fear in her voice, she said, “We’re here for Rumlow.”
“I’ve missed you and your kisses all day,” Steve confessed as they parted for breath, and he could feel Tony smiling happily in return.
“Can it please reach a few feet somewhere else?”
“Something’s up,” Bucky was the first to point out.
Steve opened his mouth to answer when the intercom buzzed to life.
“I understand you want to go there, Steve, but isn’t it a tough school to get into?”
“Believe me, we told them.”
Tony tried not to outright laugh when he took another look at Bucky. “They’re really something else, you know that, right?”
Steve raised his brows, looking anything but impressed. “You mean the ones you can’t eat?”
After so much time apart, the excitement of undressing Steve was on par with how badly Tony missed him, full stop. He didn’t want ‘newly unfamiliar’ anymore, he was tired of ‘reacquainting touches.’ Steve had been an extension of himself in the same way that Tony understood what he meant with the simplest look or gesture. He wanted his partner back.
“Not necessarily,” Steve admitted with a shrug. “But it makes me qualified to try. And, I suspect there are things you’d like to say to me without an audience.”
he resisted shouting, and instead settled for a gentle, “You’re right, Brock. I completely agree.”
“I know
“I—I like everything,” Steve said quietly, still silently praying they’d just get to the house without vaulting the car or hitting a cow. “Red velvet is fine.”
“Agneta, I bring you supper. May I enter?” Tony said to announce himself, holding the platter of food and water in front of him.
After weeks of nightmares fueled with anxiety over how his husband fared at home, sleep finally came to Steve peacefully.
“We got this,” Tony reminded himself and Steve once their second to last appointment stepped out of the room. “Just one more. 12 more minutes.”
“We will follow your lead,” Thor said in agreement, draining his stout with two big swallows. “To better hunting grounds!”
Tony looked up at him, wide-eyed. Tears were bright in his eyes, but his lips curved up with a hopeful smile of disbelief. He didn’t move or speak for so long Steve assumed Tony had mistaken his words as a hallucination, and he was just about to say something when Tony touched his forehead to Steve’s.
Bucky stared at him for a while, and when he spoke, the only thing he said was: “
“He’s not wrong,” Steve agreed slowly, and he leaned in closer to brace his weight against the chair Tony sat in, boxing him in between his arms. “Neither of those are your strongest suit.”
“It works for you,” his mom reminded him with the patience only mothers seemed to know. “Relationships are bigger than one person, you know that. You’re not trying to find someone to fit your life: you’re building a new life, together.”
Steve eased himself onto the couch with care, but before he could reach his pillows, Tony was there to help. “It’s just a mild sprain, Doc. I’m sure I’ll live.”
The two hopeful dogs obeyed Tony without any compunction, wagging their tails and desperate for validation, but Steve had many reservations about what Tony’s words implied.
“Maybe Cap isn’t trading in the Shield for an apron yet, but I was not joking about the relationship,” he said before Tony jumped to any conclusions about his opinion on Cap’s sexuality. “There’s no reason for all mainstream superheroes to be portrayed as straight, and if I can be part of representing the heroism and courage of a marginalized community, I’m there.”
He spent himself twice more in Tony before pulling out, stretched out beside the young human with a bone-deep exhaustion. Sometime between Steve’s second and third orgasm, Tony had come so hard that he had lost consciousness, and Steve now pulled him into his arms again, cradling him to his side under one arm while he tugged the covers free with the other to pull over them both.
As if seventeen pounds would change Steve’s answer. As if he hadn’t already adjusted his own weight training to anticipate a partner in his own weight-range.
Even though Tony hadn’t looked away from him once while Steve talked, that last admission left Tony wide-eyed with color rising in his cheeks. “Really?” he breathed in disbelief.
But Steve knew all too well that a man without a real, meaningful place in time had nothing. No past, no present, and certainly no future. Who would want to share his future? People dreamed of finding someone to love and support to the very end, and Steve had no end to give. He didn’t look a day over twenty, and whoever loved him would be doomed to live for years beside a constant reminder of the youth passing them by.
“Captain Steven G. Rogers, you are fined ten credits for a violation of verbal morality statute 1-1-3.”
“Answering ‘why’ you wish to marry may help you answer ‘when.’ However, neither why nor when is as important as whom,” Tony said slowly and with care, “and to me, Orfeo, it sounds like you are very certain of whom you wish to marry.”
With a little effort, every step became easier than the last. She usually fell in beside him once Tony found their normal pace, but today his pumpkin muskrat sped up to maintain her two-to-three foot advantage. Tony didn’t think much of it until he reached to pet her and she darted out of reach.
The gun he kept.
Carol took the time to think about what she said before responding. “There is only one thing a Stark doesn’t have in infinite supply, Steve,” she reminded him. “Time. Tony went out of his way to spend as much of it with you as he could. James said it was more likely a business thing.”
“That’s not how surprises work.”
“Hey, easy, darling,” Tony finally interrupted Steve’s quiet ramble. Steve pressed his lips together in a line, quieting himself, but Tony started combing his fingers through his hair again. “Would you look at me? Please?”
“Ohh, yeah,” Tony murmured in reply, still sipping on his whiskey green tea. Or, green tea steeped in whiskey, because that’s how Bruce preferred his whiskey. “Thought so, too, but… y’know, couldn’t ask for her number in front of him.”
They worked in silence for some time, and Steve had moved on from Tony’s legs to the plush fleece blanket and soft cotton linens draped around him when Sharon stood up to stretch her back.
Months, and he hadn’t even managed to ask her out for coffee.
Then, all at once, Tony straightened in his excitement and his face split with a victorious grin. “Got it! You’re in, here,” he said and turned the computer to Steve.
, but Steve only grinned against his pleading lips.
“Tony, you hungry?” Bucky asked Tony, pushing a menu at him. “You eat, right? Steve usually goes for the wings, but I’m telling you, get the shepherd’s pie. Natasha likes the pork belly pot stickers, if that’s something you go for...” he added, leaning in close to point it out on the menu.
Steve took Tony’s hand in his own and gave it a gentle squeeze. “Tony,” he said in a firm, patient voice. “Take a breath. You’re overthinking it. I just want to know if you’re a nervous flier or not.”
Tony whined and pouted in protest. “What do you mean, ‘this one’?”
He couldn’t have predicted that mountain of a man, or how aggressive he was, but he shouldn’t have discounted the possibility. And Steve—irritated, but dutiful Steve—who clearly was as unhappy with Tony’s behavior as the violent giant, had still gotten up to defend him.
Again, Tony nodded. “Been working on, um. This bug. Since… Wednesday, I guess.”
“Hey, no, Steve,” Tony said in a gentle, sympathetic tone that made Steve want to crawl to a confessional and repent. “He’s happy as a clam, alright? I’m sure you made his day. Thanks for doing that, I know it’s late where you are, and—it just means a lot. Thank you.”
“Don’t joke about that, Steve. They are the best, I couldn’t even get an interview with them,” Tony said under his breath, turning back to the task at hand.
Tony grunted quietly and let go of Steve’s shoulders. His legs were so sore they could crumble any second, but this was too important. One careful step after another, and soon Tony led them out into Wayne’s office.
Even galaxies from home, bureaucracy took an eternity. Once they had turned in their paperwork, Steve took them around to a waiting hall where benches of all shapes and sizes were installed for those waiting their turn. But when Tony first moved to sit, Steve took him by the hips and turned him around so Tony knelt on bench with his hands braced flat against the backrest.
The phone vibrated in his hand as the call came through. He watched it buzz for two, three, four seconds as he braced himself, cleared his throat, then connected the call with a swipe of his thumb.
“Steve, did you hear what I said?”
Steve pushed himself up to sitting, and he smiled back down at Tony. “You got yourself a deal.”
“Hey, why don’t I help you with that?” Clint told Steve as he walked around the dining table in the kitchen, pulling out a big serving plate and grabbing a second pan off the rack to take over half of Steve’s work. “How’re you doing them? Scrambled?”
“That I did,” Steve replied just as easily. “We were going to lose Delito to Viking, and I wasn’t going to let that happen.”
Tony frowned at the suggestion that he was wrong, and in a habitual defensive gesture, he crossed his arms over his chest. “Listen to her say what?”
Tony pursed his lips in a clear effort not to pout. “Easy for you to say,” he muttered mutinously. “You’re even better now, your muscles have new muscles
Bucky blinked at Steve, then peered at Tony. “As in, Howard Stark?”
Steve, however, didn’t seem to understand. He followed Tony into the room and watched everyone else filing in and taking the available seats. When nobody acknowledged that they were two seats short, he pointedly turned to look at Tony.
“I didn’t know he was gay,” Jane admitted, audibly miffed. Before Tony had any reason to feel jealous or angry at her for wanting to hog all the beefy blonds, she quickly clarified, “if I’d known, I’d gotten you his number months ago. But I’m glad you met him!” she added with a bright smile, both relieved and excited. “Was he nice?”
“Power!” Steve shouted at such a loud volume that Tony startled into silence. The morality box buzzed as it fined Steve three credits for excessive aggression in the workplace.
Ha, the irony.
Without a word, Tony squirmed in the tight confines of Steve’s arms enough to reach into his own front pocket where he’d stashed a single packet of water-based lube. Steve smirked down at the little pillow and its convenient twist-off top, but if he had any thoughts about Tony’s presumption that they’d have sex in their short afternoon together, he didn’t share it.
As if Steve didn’t already feel like shit for cancelling on his friends. Sam spoke before Steve had a chance to defend his decision.
“The best one I’ve got,” Steve admitted with a self-deprecating laugh. “And what does that tell you about my priorities?”
“Tony, I’ve read passionate haikus about your testicles. Call me Steve.”
“Next time, listen to me and wear the safety gloves—”
Only, not everyone there had family and friends.
“Steve, you’re scaring me,” Tony admitted quietly. He took a seat on one of the beautiful velvet wingback chairs in Steve’s sitting room. “I’ll be right here for as long as you need me to be here, okay? Don’t rush. The last thing you need is to hurt—”
Tony smiled at his question. It wasn’t the proud, beaming smile of Tony presenting his insanely realistic disguise, or the excited, scheming grin of Tony plotting to sneak himself past enemy lines. This was the bashful smile of a boy who was still new to having friends who actively looked out for him.
He’s meeting a woman at Blue Ribbon
Both Steve and Tony turned to stare at Clint in their surprise. It took a moment for Clint to realize the silence was unusual, and he turned back to eye them both in return.
“I—holy
“Mr. Tony,” Naser said a little bashfully, tugging on his sleeve and pointing at a poster advertising that lions were only a few yards away. The poster showed the lion lazing in the sun in the middle of his pride. “Are they all like, the lion’s girlfriend?”
Steve closed his fist around Tony’s hard cock, stroking it absently in wonder. “God, Tony. You’re so close,” Steve whispered, his earlier inclination to stay in character forgotten. He gathered the copious precome slick over the head of Tony’s cock, then removed his hand to leave Tony’s cock untouched and throbbing with need. Tony watched Steve rub his fingers wet with his precome, and while it clearly wasn’t a replacement for lube, that first touch of Steve’s two fingers breaching him and smearing his own precome deep into his ass drove Tony out of his mind.
“Yes.”
“I’ll accept your apology if you have a drink with me,” he replied, even grinning a little when Tony blinked back at him in surprise.
“Hey, how many times do you need to hear me say it before you believe me, Tony? What’s on your mind?”
The folder contained ten days worth of photographs of Steve. He knew, because the pictures were dated - ranging from his first public appearance at the General Assembly, to his televised debate with climate change deniers earlier that day.
Tony stared at his own reflection in the bathroom mirror and tried to will himself calm.
After all the pampering and the treats Tony had spoiled Steve with today, Steve was ready for him. Gone were the sleepy legs and the groggy mind. He put Tony down long enough to sweep him up in a bridal carry and walk them to the bedroom. But Steve hadn’t really had much time in the suite before Tony knocked on the door, and while Tony nibbled and licked at his ear and offered no help whatsoever, he carried Tony into the office and then out to the jacuzzi overlooking Central Park.
“He has been helping me adapt to the new world and understand what happened,” Steve was telling Bucky and his ragtag crew. “Their culture is more conservative, so please call him by his last name, Stark.”
Steve shrugged as he typed out his reply. “Who knows? It’s Tony. All he needs is some drone and he can watch us remotely.”
“I find that convenient and hard to believe,” Howard drawled.
had been slathered on a wall in public for innocent eyes to witness.
Steve concentrated only on the tip, turning the wet, warm suction of his mouth into a precise and dedicated pressure that left Tony sobbing with the need to thrust up into his mouth for more gratification, more friction. Steve anchored Tony’s hips firmly on the couch with one hand, where he massaged the base of Tony’s cock with his lube-slick fingers, even stroking slow, firm lines along the thick vein at the underside of his cock to help stave off the inevitable.
“Christ,” Tony muttered, smoothing his hand gently up the length of Steve’s thigh. “You are something else… fuck, alright, hold on, what was I saying?” he muttered to himself, kneeling up on the bed finally to join Steve.
“Steve? Darling, what’s wrong? You alright?”
“You are not wrong,” Tony eventually said with a deliberate calm.
“Tony, maybe you should stay? If you—”
Three hours turned into three and a half, and it was nearly nine o’clock when Steve finally made his way up to his suite. A part of him felt terribly wasteful for sleeping at a hotel in the same city as his own amazing bed back home; staycations with Tony were one thing (splurging felt reasonable then), but this time it was only him. Steve didn’t care for opulence and majesty. The Plaza couldn’t compete with the bedsheets at home that still smell like Tony, and for all its glamour, it couldn’t hold a candle to the home they shared with all Tony’s touches and belongings that still made Steve smile in their days apart.
He left with a volunteering brochure and a lighter heart. A basket of muffins wouldn’t change the world; it might not even change the night. But already Steve could feel his priorities shifting with his cleared up perspective on the world around him. This whole mission to get Brock back was getting out of hand, and Steve needed to get him away from the toxic people always surrounding him so they could talk alone.
“Why?” Sharon wondered, angling the computer towards Steve in quiet encouragement to come back and look himself. “Does a tutu make you less of a man?”
Then again, maybe he wasn’t.
Among the hopes and dreams Maria shared in her letters, there was always one unwavering constant: her confidence in her son. She had no doubt that Tony would become a remarkable man, a man who would do for the world what his father had done for their people.
By the time Steve caught up with Tony, they were standing in what he could only presume was Tony’s living room. It wasn’t the designer home he expected, but a comfortable space filled with an enormous couch and numerous mismatched armchairs. There was no TV as far as Steve could see, but bookcases covered every inch of wall space, stuffed with books. His home even smelled of books, that soothing musky scent of old books mixed with sandalwood. Steve would have been happy to spend a few hours perusing Tony’s library to find a book to share one of those armchairs with.
Attachment: 1 Location.
“They feel good, shouldn’t be a problem,” Steve decided. Once he was satisfied with the way they looked, he finally looked back at Jan. “I’m in the market for an engagement ring, expedited to Oklahoma. Masculine; noticeable, but not gaudy.”
Tony laughed a little breathlessly, but he was almost too sore to even manage that pain-free. “Darling, you’re hot as sin, but if you think I—”
“Speak for yourself,” Tony petulantly mumbled into Steve’s shoulder without leaning away from his cozy cuddle. “I’ve got a hot as fuck boyfriend who wants to have kinky sex with me and now I have to wait—”
“That reminds me,” Tony said after eighty thousand seconds (or something like that; Steve lost count around four), breaking eye-contact first. “I got some Italian sausages that could work as a filling, too.”
“They’re acting shady, sir,” Steve seconded before Fury took Tony’s head off. “They don’t look like any government employees I’ve ever seen.”
Steve stared at Sharon, wide-eyed and breathless.
The day had even started out better than usual: while he’d been out tending his turnips, he had spotted a lost water-snake caught in the swamp water. He’d managed to pull it out without injury. With its scales removed and both heads cut off, it was almost two pounds of edible meat. Food for a week, if he smoked it right.
Jane cut him off with a single, cool look. “Point him out.”
As if he had no doubt all that military money couldn't tempt Tony to continue the same destructive path. As if there was something inherent about Tony that couldn’t be bought.
“You wish. It would have been a pleasure to win that game,” Bucky promised, though ironically, his answer only seemed to satisfy Tony.
He watched Tony stare at the photos of Steve’s progressively worsening health. He listened to Jim and Natasha explain what Tony could so clearly see evidenced in the photographs, sharing a report from Bucky outlining Steve’s declining health. He watched Tony’s shoulders hunch inward and his eyes water.
With those words, he spun Tony to face the other way, and before Tony really knew what was happening, Steve had cleared off a corner of the workstation with a sweep of his arm. He lifted and bent Tony over the countertop, leaving Tony scrambling on the balls of his feet while Steve knelt behind him and pulled down Tony’s harem pants.
He never had a particular hygiene routine until he and Steve got serious. Whether he did it intentionally or not, Steve got Tony hooked on taking long, warm baths after working in the workshop. Those baths were always improved with Steve’s hands and Steve’s laughter, and if he turned off all the lights and pulled the curtain, Tony could pretend that he was back in their suite at the Commonwealth, nude except for his dog tags and soaking in the tub as he waited for Steve to walk in through the door to join him.
“Captain Steven Rogers, if there is anything I can do to right this wrong,” Steve heard the Governor say to him, and absently he shook his head. He had been wrong. There were multiple shadows moving through the shadows.
His phone rang from his jacket pocket, and Tony reflexively started patting himself down to find it.
It wasn’t until Steve squeezed Tony in his safe, strong arms that Tony dared to believe it was real.
Steve stared at him for a beat, racking his brain for anything to say besides
This time, Steve seemed to hear him. The combative ferocity in the Captain’s expression faded into a quiet determination that bordered on looking defeated, but eventually he nodded in the affirmative. Tony turned back to the steering column and engaged manual drive again.
From across the desk, Stephen blushed. “That’s, I mean, who doesn’t?”
“‘s Bost’n,” he mumbled as he twisted onto his side with a sigh and a sleepy yawn. He looked tired, but determined not to give in to the seductive promises of sleep.
His soft spot for Tony Stark was undeniable, but he’d never imagined his life to bring him here, standing in Tony’s townhouse with Tony in nothing more than loose, threadbare jeans, a t-shirt, and flannel shirt with his sleeves rolled up. Watching him walk away was a study in Tony’s natural grace and Steve couldn’t bring himself to look away. His was a hopeless case, a lost cause, and still he felt like the luckiest man in the world.
“I,” Steve growled, “am going to kill you.”
As if summoned by his obtuse sulking parade, Pepper marched into his office and dropped a small stack of important files on Tony’s desk.
“I have to go,” Steve choked out, then quickly hugged Tony’s jacket to his chest. “Jacket. Drinks, go.”
The display indicated that the canister was more than 50 percent filled. A decent load, but nothing particularly noteworthy.
“They should be,” Tony said, though he sounded a little confused himself. “At least the dogs—”
by me. You are a monster—just because you have no semblance of a life outside of this office, you, you get your thrills, your power-hungry need to control everything, by pushing us around. You think you can treat all of us like your own personal slaves! And you know what?” he added, “I feel sorry for you, because you know what you’re going to have on your deathbed? Nothing, and no-one.”
“Your client is James Buchanan Barnes,” Steve said with meaning, as if it wasn’t an obvious fact. “I, uh—I don’t know how to say this, but I promise it isn’t about the case. I think your client is my friend,” he tried to explain. “I want to see him, please. As a friend, nothing more.”
“Hey, sure. Come in,” Tony said then, shaken out of his stupor by those four unhappy words. He stepped away from the door to let Steve come in, but he paused in the hallway. Steve could see the question in his eyes as clear as day, but this wasn’t the time for intimacy. There was too much between them.
Steve let him have a few moments of silence after he’d spoken, giving Tony the space to think or continue if he needed to. “You care, Tony,” he eventually said, his voice quiet but firm in his confidence. “You’re right, sometimes you need to manage it, compartmentalize. But caring is not something to hide from. It’s astounding, all the work you’ve done to help us. This is information we would never have known without you, be proud of yourself. I know I am,” he promised. “I think you’ve handled yourself very well. And not to mention, your Overdue Ritual preview helped me when I couldn’t find any peace.”
It was alright. Not sure it’s right for me.
would be filthier than anything Tony had ever lived in.
Tony’s transition from discomfort and pain to overwhelming pleasure happened incredibly fast. He squirmed and whimpered helplessly as his body struggled to give itself time to adjust, but Steve’s grip was merciless. He held Tony firmly in position as he fucked into him hard and fast, pounding into him chasing his own orgasm without any outward concern for Tony’s pleasure.
Tony had arranged for their preferred suite at the Commonwealth well in advance, but a last minute meeting with his committee meant Steve arrived with hours to spare before Tony showed up. He treated himself to a long, warm bath before trying anything else. Sharon (and Carol, who quickly had noticed something was up and demanded to be let in on the secret) had approved his plan, but there was still the slightest chance that Tony wouldn’t like it. The last thing Steve wanted to do was ruin their first Valentine’s Day, or send some weird signal like he was bored or unappreciative of what they already had.
Tony was laughing or possibly crying against Steve’s chest as they stumbled through the scattered mid-morning crowd, and while Steve held him close to his side with one arm, he also turned to wave goodbye to his fellow Hufflepuff as the train rolled by.
“Oh my god, we haven’t even gotten to the shoes yet,” Tony moaned through gritted teeth, then took a deep breath and tried again. In his most reasonable, rational voice, he said, “Remember why we’re doing this, Steve: there’s a man - or a group of men - out there, taking advantage of young men’s dreams in order to
“...Batman? What? No, Steve: I love Superman.”
“I haven’t,” he started to say, then abruptly stopped. One more steadying breath, and another. He could do this. It could be as short as three words, just three short words. Tony rubbed his fingers over Steve’s scalp gently, soothing him rather than urging him on.
Steve frowned a little and tried not to stare. “Is flying not legal?”
He turned around in his seat to face Maria. She pulled a wicker chair over, and sat down to look him in the eyes.
“If I’m free, that’s—”
They watched him separate her from her friends with conversation; they watched her smile and laugh at what he said, and it wasn’t long before she was blushing and tucking a lock of her hair behind her ear.
“Don’t tell me what to do, tell me how to
“This isn’t me,” Tony explained—Steve hadn’t managed to ask a question, but somehow, Tony seemed to have guessed right.
Sharon sized him up in a second. “No, I do not.”
He stood out like a sore thumb.
“You described your mother as a town gossip,” Dr. Odinson spoke over him, “and your father as neglectful of both yourself and his wife.”
“Tony, sweetheart,” he heard Steve whispering, and his lips curled up at the heady and endearing combination of Steve’s deep, spicy musk mixed with the cedar and citrus scents he long associated with home. “Your plan worked: Foster is onboard again, I’m free for the night. We can go see your friends.”
“Upset?” Steve shot up in his seat and interjected before Tony could finish. “Why would I be upset? New York as I know it is gone, my friends are long dead, and I’m stuck in a post-apocalyptic fascist Stepford dystopia surrounded by brainwashed pacifists who have outlawed
On his phone, Steve watched the feed from his most recent addition to the Delft tourism industry - a planted camera in a decorative little ceramic Dutch slipper done up in Delft blue. For the second night in a row, there seemed to be no unusual nighttime movements in the overpriced tourist shop.
“You look like Cupid hit you with a semi-automatic,” Bucky drawled. “But I guess it can’t be that serious, right? Cause you haven’t introduced him to anybody yet. I know, because I get to meet him first. Official best friend duty, I vet the new boyfriend.”
is,” Chief Director Fury snarled, “you need a steward. The conditions of your parole are full reinstatement into the NYPD and immediate assignment to the apprehension of Brock Rumlow. On the recommendation of your steward at the end of your parole it will be determined whether you can be granted gold class status as part of returning you to an equal class which you enjoyed at the time of your sentencing.”
“You didn’t look worried when we first met, and your English was flawless,” Steve whispered, almost to himself, and Tony predictably leaned closer in his curiosity to hear more. “First day, you were something else, talking with everyone on the crew, the cast. I watched you—”
A lifetime of experience shone through in Clark’s small, bittersweet smile. “I know what you mean. You deserve no less.”
“So I hear,” Clark said calmly, but something about his tone raised a warning flag. Steve only had a moment to brace himself before the game was up. “Bruce called this morning. He wanted to know why his godson was snooping around his personal business.”
“It’s working out, good,” Tony managed, clearing his throat one last time. “How’s he doing on the dates?”
The sudden shift in weight almost knocked Tony off-balance, and he clutched Thor tight for the balance to maintain his precarious position beside the bed. Ironically, the added strength of the hug seemed to be what Thor needed, and he finally let go, sobbing freely against Tony’s shoulder while Tony tried to be patient, rubbing Thor’s back for comfort and resisting the urge to roll his eyes.
“Yes, you did, angel: James Buchanan Barnes. Bucky,” she reminded him. “You two were inseparable until you were six years old.”
Steve groaned at the memory. “Twelve. He barely broke a sweat.”
Like a moth to the flame, Tony wrapped his fist around Steve’s thick cock and immediately began stroking him from root to tip, wetting his palm with Steve’s precome to help lubricate his touch.
Silence cut through Blue Planet II and a beautiful shark froze on the screen.
She acknowledged him with a quiet hum as she looked up what seats were padded, and then which were center ice.
Sharon buried her face in her hands and muffled a miserable groan. A conversation with herself followed; Steve couldn’t make out what she said, but when she looked up in the end, she had clearly lost the argument.
“Then
Tony frowned a little at Steve’s drawn expression, as if he wasn’t entirely sure what to make of it. “You want me to go?” he asked after a minute. “If you’re… if you need time.”
Steve pursed his lips and looked back in defiance. “I’m not answering that unless you’ll reward me with puppies.”
Tony blinked his eyes wide open and stared back in surprise. “What? But, it will be my first time,” he couldn’t help but say. He wasn’t sure when the idea of bottoming had turned from a daunting concept to a rite of passage, but if it wasn’t for Steve’s comforting touch, Tony would have felt very wronged.
There was a quick rapping on the door, which gave them just enough warning for Steve to stand up and for Tony to sit up in bed before Maria stepped into the bedroom. She had two big shopping bags in one hand.
Tony shuffled into his room, doubled over with silent, wheezing laughter.
“If I’m not intruding,” Tony said, a small smile audible in his voice. “Yeah, I’d like that. Send me the address.”
“I, I was wrong, I was so wrong,” Steve agreed, “after last night, after you took care of me; Tony, please. I didn’t know what I have, I didn’t appreciate you. I was frustrated and couldn’t see how, how generous and kind you are. Please, Tony? Give me another chance.”
Tony did his best not to draw too much attention to the casual touch, and instead made a show of pouting up at Steve. “You don’t remember? It was only last week, Steve. Batman Returns? You stood up for me when Andre the Angry Giant got in my face.”
“This rehabilitation program,” Steve said, apropos of nothing. “How did you say it worked?”
Bond was quiet for a short period, probably moving through unsafe space. After a minute or two of radio silence, Tony heard the agent gleefully whisper, “Why, what’d you put in it?”
A shaky smile wobbled across Tony’s face, as if he wasn’t sure if he should laugh or cry again. “You were safe in Berlin,” he whispered in accusation. “It gave me comfort, knowing you were safe in Berlin. Whatever happened to me, you would live.”
He pulled a short woman with a spear off of Tony, punched her in the face, and tossed her aside. “Tell me.”
“That smells divine,” Tony seconded and watched as Steve’s pleased smile grew even brighter.
“Not quite, sir,” Steve said, brushing biscuit crumbs off his hands before putting his cloth napkin away and giving Howard his full attention. “I work for a global—”
“Impressive. What do you do?” he asked while they wandered up to the counter to order. Steve hung back a little, familiar enough with the menu not to have to read it.
“Mmmno,” Steve mumbled in reply. “Jus’sleepy.”
The bedroom had a nice view of the Royal Hospital Garden, but once Steve’s shirt had come off, Tony didn’t seem to care about anything other than Steve. His eyes briefly lingered on the body Steve had honed over the years before stalling on the large bruises that covered Steve’s right side from hip to shoulder.
“I asked her to find someone who could evaluate property.”
They finished with the computer and took the stairs back down to ground level. Tony’s resolve lasted until the 47th floor where he finally promised not to jump into sacrifice plays and demanded to be let down. They rejoined the party long enough to show their faces to the right people, then got out of there before their luck ran out.
Steve wouldn’t have it. Sometimes his blowjobs were slow and tender, the tribute of a devoted man at the altar, thorough and gentle with his exploring fingers and soft lips. He would take his time, laving the length of Tony’s cock with the flat of his tongue, or hold Tony still as he softly sucked on the head of his cock and massaged his inner thighs until Tony wept and begged to come.
Steve couldn’t move, he couldn’t find his words. For the people of Consone who looked into the sky, they would see their king coming to their defense. They would know they were not alone. Their enemies would never know if five jets followed the king or five hundred, but even alone the king would fight, and vengeance followed in his wake.
Without a word, Tony raised his left hand - the one closest to Stephen - to bring his attention to his naked ring-finger. Stephen retaliated in action, too, bringing out a printed shot of Tony’s most ambiguous and controversial Instagram post yet.
Steve took a deep breath and tried to calm his tingling nerves. Focus on the present. Tony was still on the phone with the judge, so Steve used Tony’s distraction to his advantage to really look at the man whom he’d evidently married the night before. Even naked Tony was a striking man, confident and composed under pressure in a way Steve could only aspire to be. Shameless and helplessly smitten, Steve drank in the sight of his newlywed husband. In profile, Tony was a dream - from the elegant silhouette of his nose and lips, to the perky round shape of his ass. From the back his lean body revealed its strength in the shape of his thighs, his calves, and his sinewy shoulders, but it was from the front that he was truly breathtaking. Steve could have lost himself in those eyes, in the sinful promise curling his smile. Given half a chance, Steve could spend hours on his knees to see all the ways Tony’s lips exposed his passion further.
Steve couldn’t remember how he got to the garage or any of the drive until he took the wrong turn on a one-way and realized what he was doing. With a quick touch on the break, a change in gear, and a turn of the wheel he swung his Porsche around in the right direction, barely aware of the chaos he left in his wake.
“Twenty life sentences, because of you. I dreamt of your pretty face every day on the ice, of pulling your pretty eyes out of your skull and snuffing your life out by pissing on your brain.”
The next thing he knew, Steve felt the edge of Bucky’s bed bump against the back of his thighs. He controlled the fall by sitting with Tony in his arms, but while Steve was careful of where he placed his hands, Tony wasn’t. He pushed forward before Steve settled, pushing him off balance and rolling them into bed with Steve’s body draped over Tony’s and their lips were inches apart.
“I missed you, too, Sparky,” he teased, intentionally turning his head to mouth at Steve’s plump bottom lip with every word. “We’re not exactly in a state to invite more injuries. Let’s wash up and take this to bed, hm?”
Apart from the slow, hypnotic circles Tony was rubbing into his aggravated lower back, neither of them moved.
The first time, Steve did not last long. In fact, he barely registered the satisfaction of fully seating his cock in Tony’s body before his orgasm barreled through him like a storm, merciless and consuming. His mind returned in stages, and it wasn’t until some minutes later that he realized he was still fucking into Tony’s body, chasing his second orgasm before he had recovered from the first.
Tony’s embarrassed laughter escaped in a soft squeak of amusement. “Anything you haven’t figured out yet, Steve?”
But then next morning Steve would again wake up to find he was alone. Tony had snuck out of bed in the morning before Steve got up. And all in one breath, Steve's heart would sink, devastated to again lose Tony without so much as a chance to beg him to stay. He’d be so busy with his own racing thoughts that he wouldn’t realize Tony was sitting on the bedroom floor behind the nightstand, hunched in on himself and mostly hidden by it. Because here they go again, him and his feelings for Steve, and Steve still had a fight next week. He'd have to stand there and stomach watching Steve beaten down to god knows what state again.
More importantly, he was someone Tony knew he could rely on. There was nothing Steve hadn’t done to be at Tony’s side, and whatever else Steve could have said, Tony already knew how he felt.
Steve’s heart ached to see his husband so pale. He reminded himself that it wasn’t unnatural to get sick; everyone caught a cold or the flu at some point. It was nothing to be so worried about. But all Steve could think about was how he’d never seen Tony’s lips so chapped and so nearly white.
kissed,” he told her in a lowered voice, shy and excited and anxious all at once. “Yesterday. We were both half asleep, I didn’t think it was real… I hope it was? I can’t tell if he wants to take it slow, or if he doesn’t want anyone to know at work or what, but he was distant and weird today. We were digging through records and interviews on Wayne and he just… he would barely talk to me. How does it even work in Kansas? Do they still wait for marriage? I don’t think I can do that, but then it’s Steve.
Tony hummed down the line, and Steve could just imagine him smiling. He always liked to imagine Tony smiling. “Are you still thinking about living with your mom?”
From somewhere deep in his heart, deep in his bones, Steve could feel himself growing warm with the thrill of seeing Tony when he least expected it. “Sweetheart—Tony, what are you doing here?” he asked with a broad smile that he just couldn’t suppress.
He wandered past the excitable Girl Scouts hopping on the glass panels built into the floor that revealed the ongoing archeological excavation of 21st century Jersey City, and senior couples marveling at the use of ivory in the antique weaponry. Rumlow smirked to himself as he walked through time, passing decades of advancements in weapons technology by moving from one display to the next. Here, the sighting system of the 1980s; there, the portable threats posed by pocket-sized explosives developed in the 1990s. The digital revolution of the mid-2000s soon followed, and with it, the information wars of the early 21st.
“Move away,” Bucky clarified impatiently. “Go to LA, Chicago; I don’t know, wherever else you can do whatever it is you do.”
“Did, um,” Steve started to say as his eyes caught on the golden ring on Tony’s hand. His question seemed redundant now, but he needed to ask it. “Did we get married last night?”
Steve opened his mouth, but only a helpless gust of a laugh escaped him. “It’s a really long story,” he hedged, floundering as he tried to think of a short summary. “I thought I loved a guy who only wanted to marry someone serious, so I worked hard and got into the same law program he did. Got all the way to Harvard Law School and realized he was a dickhead this whole time.”
“You don’t know the half of it; there’s tons more in the car,” Steve confided his existential dismay to his best friend before turning to his partner. “Are we ready?”
“To do what?” Tony pressed, but Steve only grinned and shook his head.
Tony snickered and turned a corner. It was a dead end, a little corner where a potted ficus lived and the hallway ended in a five foot window with Victorian arches. Steve turned to see if they’d missed a step when Tony crowded into his personal space again, backing Steve up against the window.
“We will be meeting Mrs. Hansen in thirty minutes,” she told them as they took a seat around the oblong conference table. “What questions have you thought to raise?”
“Nice! Buns you can fill with anything you want, like Tony.”
“I made it,” Tony said simply, plugging Steve’s USB in and waiting for it to connect. “Graduation project, actually. Hey! Looks like you lucked out, Steve. It’s not dead,” he added with a big smile. “Got the key on you?”
Without a word, Bucky threw on the siren and punched the gas.
“As often as I can,” Steve admitted with a smile even stone-faced Maria couldn’t resist returning. “Falling in love is the best feeling, everyone deserves to experience it.”
“Not really,” Steve managed through gritted teeth. He was finishing his second Sno Ball when it dawned on him that his chills were fading away, which was the same time he realized he’d been shivering since he sat down—maybe even longer. He huddled further into his blanket for warmth, desperate for comfort.
Tony continued sucking leisurely on Steve’s fingers and moaning his delight with every subsequent little roll of Steve’s hips as he chased every last pulse of euphoria, filling Tony with his come, marking and claiming Tony for his own. The satisfaction and high of being fucked left Tony so blissed out he arched like a lazy cat after Steve, completely disconnected from the urgency of their situation.
Tony chuckled at whatever sorry sight Steve must have made. The sound of his quiet, rumbling laugh warmed Steve somewhere deep inside, and tired as he was he couldn’t stop from smiling in return.
Steve agreed and watched Tony leave. It took Steve an embarrassingly long time to realize he was staring after Tony even once the door had fallen shut behind him. Thoughts moved like cool molasses through his sluggish brain as he tried to pull together a plan of action. He needed a quick rinse after his flight, no question there. Jeans were always good, casual and classic. And October in New York was an excuse to wear clothes for warmth, as opposed to LA where ‘fall’ was still an abstract concept.
I can now happily (uh) say that, if enough people like it, there is definitely further to go with this one. After all, Steve's only just gotten Tony registered as his, and his new toys haven't arrived. Just saying.
“Kiss me, Tony, I beg you,” Steve sighed with palpable affection, “put me out of my misery.”
you can grow a full beard? Mine comes in patchy still, like I’m fourteen or something—”
Wednesday morning, Steve’s alarm rang at 4:45 like it always did, and Tony whined into his pillow about it like he always did. Steve smiled fondly and rolled closer to Tony to press a soft kiss to his forehead.
“I need my chief priest, Steve,” Tony answered in a firm, deep voice that washed over Steve in a feverish, full body shudder. “I need my sacrifice.”
“I admit your tweeting privileges were not on my mind at the time,” Steve drawled, and with a hopeful expression held the phone out to Tony in an unspoken request. Tony stared at him for a beat before rolling back to his pillow and leaving Steve to handle the conversation solo.
“Ashley Olsen!” Tony called out before Steve even opened his mouth. Steve probably should have laughed, or congratulated Tony on his point, but instead he cleared his throat and sat up straight. It was about to get serious.
Steve melted just a little bit, but his smile was as brilliant and warm as sunshine. Tony could feel his own cold, sheltered heart thaw with happiness.
“For fuck’s sake, is nothing—” Steve stopped mid-sentence and turned to look for the buzzing morality box. After a brief pause, he excused himself politely and marched to the dutiful machine that had printed his most recent fine.
“He was feeding my pony sugar and oats,” Tony stage-whispered from Steve’s right, unwilling to let Clint have full control of the story. “I was racing that day, he sabotaged me.”
Tony didn’t say anything, but Steve felt how he shifted in bed, adjusting his position so he could plant one foot on the mattress next to Steve’s shoulder. With newfound leverage, he pulled out of Steve to thrust back into his body with greater force, until he was pounding into Steve like an animal.
Eventually, Steve looked back at the slippery figure beside him and said, “I will be in touch.”
Steve laughed, blushing despite himself. “We actually do have exciting plans coming up for the holidays, I think we’ll be fine. We finished up the house in Portugal, so we finally have a place big enough to host family and friends for Christmas. We’ve been wanting to do that for a long time, because usually we spend a few days with my parents then go to Mexico with Tony’s. This will be the first time we’re all together in one place, and we’re inviting our close friends, too—we’re really excited.”
Alone at last, he played the video.
“Couldn’t feel better,” Steve lied with a grateful smile, not that he could help himself from playing along. “Unless you’re searching for a willing patient, in which case…”
Luckily, Steve had already turned back to his notes on his own laptop, so he was the only one around the table who missed the way Tony openly mooned over him, deeply fond and miserably crestfallen at the same time.
Eventually, Tony choked on air and stumbled forward with awkward, heavy feet until he could finally get his shaking, eager hands on Steve’s oiled up pecs, his pronounced biceps… and then swept his hands down Steve’s broad frame to curl over the lace around Steve’s narrow hips.
“What do you mean you have no further witnesses?” Hansen hissed at Natasha, furious at the unexpected turn of events. “Call me to the stand.”
“I couldn’t tell—all I heard him say before the FBI packed him up in a car was that he didn’t do it, he was just getting breakfast burritos or something.”
For reasons Steve couldn’t explain, it always amused him to hear how much Tony hated Boston - whether it was the Patriots, the Red Sox, or the Massholes themselves, it always warmed his heart. “I love you, too, Tony,” he whispered against Tony’s smiling lips, chasing every word with short, playful kisses. “Vegas or Atlantic City, you choose. I don’t care.”
But Steve had no time to play coy. He had no time to waste.
“Of course, I should explain that back then I thought I was being a good girl,” she eventually continued with her perfectly normal story once the laughter had calmed, and Tony seemed to have come up for air at exactly the wrong time. With tears of laughter still wet in the corners of his eyes, he waited with bated breath to hear how that sentence might possibly end.
, Steve didn’t say. He had no voice, no words worth sharing. He was simply too late. All he could do was nod along, wave good-bye, and pretend it didn’t hurt.
Bucky cringed as something else occurred to him. “What do you think our chances are that he hasn’t noticed we found the goober?”
“He’s not from around here. He’s lived here for a few years, but he’s from a small town. Somehow, he said he loves the big city, how alive it is. That when he’s homesick, he still manages to find things that remind him of home in little bodegas, mom and pop restaurants.”
A train was knocked off course in an explosion near Kensington Palace that left sixteen wounded and two dead. A ferry destined for Tower Bridge safely passed its most likely target and made little noise at the bottom of the Thames after the informed captain evacuated all passengers in a dinghy and sunk the boat.
Tony was silent for a beat. “No. Nothing serious, why?”
“Wake up, everybody! The cavalry is here,” the man announced, plucking his sunglasses off with a decided flourish. “That’s right: the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or the FBI. You might have heard of us. I am Special Agent Hammer, Justin Hammer. I need Captain Carter and I need Detective Rogers. Which of you charming locals can—”
Gravity reversed itself and Tony’s head was lost at sea.
But for so long, Pierce had insisted that cleanliness was crucial to their survival. Cleanliness, vigilant hygiene practices, and strictly monitored exchange of body fluids had rescued their entire civilization from the brink of collapse. Engaging in a practice as unclean and questionable as willfully entering the sewers could disqualify Tony from gold status. More importantly, it could permanently disqualify Bruce from his license to conceive.
“That was not how my mother did it,” Steve told him in a whisper. “Tony, I’ll follow the rules in the Palace. I’ll be quiet about people cleaning up after me like I’m a bedridden child, I’ll give up my privacy. But nobody - not your ancestors, not Queen Elizabeth, and not even you are going to tell me how to connect with people.”
“What? Just cause we’re in rural Oklahoma doesn’t mean I can’t enjoy advanced astronomy.”
This had already gone on too long, and despite his extensive training and veteran experience, Steve was at the end of his self-restraint. While Tony nuzzled and moaned into his neck, Steve draped his heavy arm over Tony’s body to cup the full, round cheeks of his ass in each hand. He rolled them so he lay on his back with Tony snuffling on top of him, and finally free to indulge in his long-standing curiosity, he treated himself to spreading Tony’s ass and kneading the meat of his ass, exploring the different ways he could make Tony’s soft panting hitch in irresistible, moaning sobs. Steve worked his way closer to his hole, inch for inch, until finally all he heard from his pet was hoarse, mumbling encouragement; as Tony instinctively spread his legs the closer Steve got to the crack of his ass, the more encouraged Steve was to reach forward with his slicked up fingers and press two, then three fingers forward to learn what that divine, warm body felt to inhabit.
“Of course I’ve considered that,” Steve whispered miserably. “But if I am not bound to the Chief, she will not release you and Tony. And she will punish you for abandoning the mating.”

The loaded weapons were turned up to the sky then quickly holstered as the soldiers realized who stood before them. Steve raised his hand to show his appreciation, and when he spoke, he addressed them all.
“Didn’t you say he liked the tree house in upstate New York?” Rhodey wondered sometime after inhaling his large chocolate malt. “Can you go back there?”
Steve didn’t acknowledge his response at first. He gazed up at Tony instead, as if searching for an answer other than what Tony had given him. Tony found himself unable to look away. Gently, he curled his fingers against Steve’s cheek, sweeping his thumb reverently over Steve’s temple.
“As my friend, I require that you read it and spare me the burden.”
“I don’t think the Chief would risk upsetting her future bride,” Stephanie muttered, but still she peered at Clint like she really, really hoped Talia had not lied to her. The potion took a little time to take effect, but once it started, the transformation was almost immediate. Clint lay whimpering in a heap on the floor, in too much pain to move yet, so it was Stephanie who helped get the long tunic over his head and his arms, tugging it down in place to at least maintain his modesty until he could put the pants on himself.
“Oh? Well, he’s barely mentioned you,” Bucky drawled, and Steve cut him a tired look immediately.
In the gasping silence of the bullpen, Steve thumbed through the substantial stack in his hands. With a quiet hum of satisfaction, he waved the tickets at Tony and gestured for the bathroom. “See you in a few minutes.”
He gathered up his courage and opened the door.
Carol looked from Tony to Rhodey and back again. “He’s making a good case,” she told Rhodey quietly. “Steve’s never left the country, and he loves all of those things.”
Given Steve’s relative obscurity and the minimal information available about their relationship, the media lost it when Tony first stepped out with a wedding ring. He’d been on the red carpet at Gotham Hall for a charity auction for Carol’s foundation when the first photographer caught the golden shine on his ring finger.
“Perfect,” Steve praised him, and it was almost enough to make up for the contentment he’d now been deprived of. “All eyes will be on you, Tony. You’ll be the star of the show.”
Steve keyed them in and took his luggage on his way in. “You’re not going?”
Distantly, he felt Steve’s frenzied thrusts grow more fervent until Steve no longer held back his power, driving into Tony with enough force to rattle the bed frame until finally, buried deep in Tony's raw, aching ass, Steve filled him with his come. Steve didn't stop fucking him, pumping his come deeper into Tony, soothing the last lingering trace of emptiness within him. High in his afterglow, Tony's grasp of consciousness began to fade, and the last thing he felt before the world turned to blissful sleep was the touch of Steve’s lips brushing against his ear with a whispered promise of love.
Steve took one look at him and decided it wasn’t worth it to articulate a counterpoint. He got up to collect their plates, but Tony quickly got to his feet and did it instead.
He could practically hear the question mark on Tony’s expression. “You didn’t like the BU theme?”
“Don’t underestimate him, he’s got a clever disguise,” Clark said with a wry quirk of his lips. “I just never understood how he kept up with being Bruce.”
Tony glittering peel of laughter drowned out Steve’s low, embarrassed whine. “I’m hanging up on you right now!” Steve cried in a half-hearted threat. “School is
“Been wanting to tell you all night,” Tony whispered hoarsely between rushed kisses, rolling his hips up against Steve’s body. With only two layers of fabric between them, it was so easy to feel Steve’s interest pressing against his thigh. The thought of Steve’s cock free and so nearly exposed drove Tony half out of his mind.
The Graekol had moved on to discussing the typical reasons why private harvests often failed to deliver the safety and dependability of industrially harvested products, and Steve listened attentively even as he held Tony by the hair and leisurely rocked his hips to fuck Tony’s throat. He paused now and then when he hadn’t felt Tony exhale for some time, holding Tony’s face down against his crotch until Tony made a big show of breathing in and out through his nose so Steve would resume his thrusts.
They pushed away the furniture and got situated on the floor. Between the boxes of food and drinks, Tony created little stacks pairing lecture notes with assignments. He had gone through the trouble of drafting summaries for each stack that highlighted the main concepts covered, the relevant formulas and charts, and the question types Sima favored in the assigned work.
“Even if I did, Wayne is the likeliest suspect,” Tony muttered between bites. “Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. Can you think of a narcissist in Gotham with better connections?”
“It’s 1 AM, Tony. Pace yourself, this isn’t a sprint,” Steve said, his mouth twisting awkwardly.
“Same,” Tony admitted, dropping the poker face to smile at Steve. The whole situation still felt insane, but Steve smiled back in a way that left Tony feeling buoyant and excited in a way he hadn’t felt in a long time. “I’m looking for a guy who’ll stick around, bring me pizza every once in a while, and lovingly squeeze my ass.”
When Steve’s hands squeezed into Tony’s jeans and squeezed his cheeks in large, greedy palmfuls, Tony stuttered forward against Steve’s chest with a gasp of surprise. Steve hadn’t fucked him since Tony moved, but the way he spread Tony’s ass and pulled at his hole with his strong fingers, it was clear Steve knew him well enough to guess Tony’s treasure chest had come into heavy rotation in their week apart.
Tony opened the door barefooted and dressed more casually than Steve had ever seen him. It was hard not to stare.
“There’s rocks in Mississippi with better sense than the two of you,” she shouted back, tossing the pan and ladle back on the counter. “Your brother’s home for the first time in seven years, and this is how you welcome him?”
Tony barely had time to yelp before Steve lifted him into his arms, pivoted to the left, and jumped into bed. They landed in a tangle of limbs, Tony on his back halfway under Steve’s bulk, laugh-giggling in his surprised delight. Steve crawled even closer, until he could nuzzle into Tony’s soft throat and Tony’s body was almost entirely under Steve.
Without warning, Steve took Tony’s thigh in hand and hefted it over the corner of the counter Tony was bent over, spreading him open to where his asshole was exposed from the stretch of the position alone. Tony struggled to even balance his weight on his toes, his sandal slipping on the cheap tiles so easily. Tony had no reliable way to hold himself up and no leverage to move. He was entirely at Steve’s mercy.
By dawn, Tony had strong-armed CCTV in a South African den of iniquity so 008 could move unseen into the AWB’s unsavory annual auction. He was waiting on the results of the facial recognition software to bounce through the CIA and Chinese intelligence when he Sam called his name.
His impression of an infatuated Tony was cut short with a yelp when Sam pried the bottle of vodka away from him.
As one, the pint-sized stampede took off, each pair of little feet running to their designated seats. With minimal groaning and complaining, the students dug out their workbooks and their pencils, eager to show just how well-behaved they could all be.
Jim must have been holding Tony’s phone, because most of it was of Tony - talking to Rhodey or talking to Steve between intermittent conversations with strangers in the marketplace.
“You lasted longer than I did,” Steve told Tony before he took his palpable embarrassment out on his soon-to-be-ex-friend. “I couldn’t help it, I told my friends about our date an hour ago. I had a really great time with you, Tony.”
Steve squeezed the heel of his boots into the legs of his chair to contain his reaction to Tony’s oh so casual admission that he was into men. He cleared his throat, willed the blush from his face to the extent that he could, and carried on.
Steve leaned in close while Tony still had his fingers over his ears. He pressed a kiss to Tony’s shoulder in a silent expression of affection.
Steve shrugged. “I have a perfect GPA.”
“Call Barnes’ references before the end of the day,” Steve changed the subject again. “He’s competent, but I am not confident in his ability to multi-task or lead a team. Call me back with a report by voicemail tomorrow morning; otherwise, move on to that what’s-his-name out of Princeton. At least he’ll have a network to stand on.”
“And you knew about your assistant calling me derogatory names, and you did nothing about it!”
“Are his walls any good?” Clint asked with deadpan delivery. It took Tony a second too long to understand what he meant. “This whole sharing an air vent thing is—”
. It was before I knew this project was taking off, and I approached the book as a story about an isolated man who returns after World War II, where he has seen the worst of humanity, and instead of finding the love and life he loved and wanted to protect, he is now facing problems that he is powerless to effectively address. To a great extent, that speaks to Cap’s experience, and thinking through Pollock’s perspective was meaningful in capturing his isolation, so, that was how the story first came to me. And I like my books as books, you know what I mean? As paperbacks with paper pages, because I, when I read, I like making notes in the margins. I like flagging the parts that stand out to me, for whatever reason. Now, Tony,” he added with a small sigh that should have been exasperated but verged on exceedingly fond. “When Tony learned that Peter was signed on to this project, he sent Peter my book. With all my old notes about how Russell’s experience could help frame Cap’s perspective, and apparently that connection to Cap helped Peter find Arvin’s place in all of this. Which is great, it was all for the better, but that certainly was not to my credit. And, you know, he still hasn’t given me my book back,” Steve finished with a wry expression.
When Steve was next distracted ordering a third round of rum and cocoa, Tony quietly asked Natasha to arrange for the artist of the tobogganer kings ornament to make them a full collection of all ornaments depicting himself and Steve. If he were lucky, it would not take the artist long, and Tony could hide them on the tree in their private drawing room to surprise Steve. He and Steve had already agreed on only exchanging one handmade gift for Christmas, so if he could get it on the tree (instead of under it) before Christmas Day, it wouldn’t count.
“How much of that did you hear, Rogers?”
“You’re not free,” Bucky hissed in undertone, but it must have been quiet enough in the bank that his voice carried.
With enough insistence from his mom who didn’t want him to depend on his looks as a career, he grudgingly prioritized an education over photoshoots and runways. NYU wasn’t a cheap school, but once he got there, everything seemed to fall into place. His schedule was flexible enough and New York offered enough local work opportunities that he could model and study at the same time; he had time for his friends, time for his mom, and best of all, thanks to one fateful campus event, he’d found the man of his dreams.
“You look a little pale.”
“If I ever get a chance to explore social media
“You don’t get what?”
Tony could feel his face warming. Whether Steve noticed or not, the devious edge in Steve’s expression faded into a genuine smile, and with a quiet confidence that seemed to come so naturally, Steve said, “Even billionaires could use puppy therapy, Tony.”
“Sorry, what?”
Bucky’s voice woke Steve out of his happy little daydream, stealing him away from coveted, intimate memories of Tony in his bed earlier that morning. He looked up from his phone where he’d been scrolling absently through photos of Tony ‘trying’ (and failing) to make a pavlova the other week, as if sitting on the front steps of your building and staring at pictures of your boyfriend was a perfectly normal passtime.
“Tony, where are you going with this?”
“Call me Steve. Thank you for seeing us on such short notice,” Steve replied while Tony tried to get over his cough.
Like so many nights before, Steve nestled up close to his man, made space for himself between his arms, and turned so his back was pressed flush against Tony’s chest. He counted Tony’s slow, even breaths, pressed his relaxed hands to his lips in a good night kiss, and slowly drifted to peaceful sleep.
Whatever else existed in the room - floors, rugs, tables of any kind - was impossible to see. There were books and pages strewn on every available surface, the books held open with various fruits and improvised paperweights like bottles of wine, potted succulents, and candlesticks of countless shapes and sizes.
“Good, thank you for sharing with us, Tony,” Dr. Odinson said after jotting down some notes. Then, he turned to Steve. “And then you, Steve. Tell us about yourself and your family.”
Tony shoved the headset on and tried not to let his pride taint his first interaction with the one and only 007.
“I’m so proud of you, Tony,” Steve smiled when he saw that his fingers came away without any traces of bleeding, and he pressed a soft kiss to Tony’s sweaty, panting chest. “You’ll sleep so good for me now, won’t you?”
“This conversation never happened!” Sharon hissed through her teeth, and right before opening the door to H’s office she soundlessly mouthed, ‘I’ll be there!’
Tony took a moment to realize what Steve had said, then turned and stared at Steve in muted disbelief.
“You’re up early,” he mumbled, his voice still husky with sleep.
Wide-eyed and unblinking, Tony stared at the ring boxes.
“Hang on,” Steve said without thinking, and went to tug the door open real quick. “Almost ready, shoes.”
He looked so worried that Tony couldn’t help the truth from spilling out of him. “I’m an asshole,” he confessed with quiet words. “I’m an asshole who can’t plan ahead, keep track of time, or—”
“We’re not married, but Steve’s my only partner. We’ve been together for five years,” Tony had said while swallowing down as much of his vitriolic contempt as he could stomach. “Even if I wanted to, he doesn’t leave me with enough energy to entertain another man.”
It’s a date
came to mind. It's short and pointless, but I hope you enjoy!
Steve slammed the door shut and slid the deadbolt home. From the other side of the door, Howard hammered on the door and demanded to be let in, and with every passing second he seemed to grow angrier and louder.
If looks could kill, Steve’s phone wouldn’t have survived its untimely interruption. He couldn’t have one minute of peace? With a finger between the pages to keep his place, Steve poked at his phone to see what was so urgent that someone would email at eleven o’clock at night.
“Then let’s see if we can’t even the score,” Carl said with a smile. “For point two… the initials are, AO.”
Justice would be served.
Then, with a playful, smirking grin at Tony, Steve moved down the length of Tony’s body until Tony’s thighs rested against his shoulders and Steve could nuzzle the base of his cock. Steve was barely doing more than mouthing at the base of his cock and laving the hardening length of it with his tongue, but in his surprise, Tony arched off the bed and groaned deeply in his pleasure.
“Don’t project your weird fantasies onto me, Romanov,” Tony accused half-heartedly. “Wayne’s a looker, sure, fine. I’ll give you that. Richer than the devil. But he’s that worst kind of shady piece of shit. I know his kind; my dad was his kind. He’s too wealthy and has enough people in his pocket to keep getting away with any crime he likes. He’s got a dark side, I can just feel it, and I’ll expose him if it’s the last thing I do.”
“Aw, sweet child, and there I went making a ruckus,” she said in an even quieter voice, as if to make up for the earlier clatter of her pan. “For what it’s worth, darling, that makes two of you.”
Steve pressed his lips into a thin line in his effort not to frown.
Steve pressed a soft kiss over his chest, then pushed himself up on an elbow to meet Tony’s eyes again. “What if I want to suck your dick, Tony? Eat your ass out?” he asked, speaking slowly and clearly and without breaking eye contact. “What if I want to fuck you? Give you a reason to remember our date on Monday.”
“Technically, hydrangeas are bushes,” Steve said—not because it mattered, but because they finally had something neutral to talk about. “They change color based on the acidity in the soil, and I don’t know what’s going on in this country but they’ve got the most beautiful hydrangeas I’ve ever seen so I thought, you know… maybe we should, uh. Do this instead?”
, Steve dared to think when he peeked over his fingers and saw Tony laughing at Bucky’s exaggerated eye-rolling.
The door was solid wood, but the way it rattled under the force of Howard’s rage left Steve wondering if maybe he could have handled that better. Howard looked livid, and this certainly wasn’t improving his temper. Soon he’d wake their neighbors, or even Tony might come down to see what the commotion was about, and then what would Steve say?
Tony smiled up at him and pressed a little kiss to Steve’s shoulder. “I’m not just rushing home for you, darling,” Tony told him as they walked hand in hand to the bar. “I miss Pepper and I miss Rhodey. I’d like you to meet them. If nothing else happens here tonight, all the better.”
That was when Tony noticed their reflection in the mirror. Clear as day, he could watch himself and Steve—he could watch Steve fucking him, taking him apart, like his very own private viewing channel. There were recent scratches across Steve’s chest and over his shoulder, contrasted clearly against the red blush coloring his skin. Tony had no memory of scratching him up, but he felt a surge of pride and lust in the knowledge that the marks were his. A flash of shameless desire overcame him with this new perspective of their position, the obscene display of how he’d been folded in half and spread open for Steve’s taking. Heat pooled behind his cock, and he thrust up instinctively, but there was still no mouth, no hand, no heat to find satisfaction in. Tony had never come without touching his cock before, and he was so close, so desperate for release; the way Steve’s thick cock filled him with every thrust, the slow, punishing burn of his rim, all of it was enough to bring Tony repeatedly to the edge of release, taunting him with both pain and pleasure, but never enough to push him over.
Tony tore off the ticket from the morality box and added it to the growing collection on his desk. “Steve Rogers, it would take me a long time to explain, and I promise to do so at the earliest opportunity. Until then, Captain, I am your steward, and I cannot help you assimilate unless you place your faith in me.”
Steve paused, at a loss for words. There was no right way to say goodbye. “I have to get back to dinner, Tony. Enjoy your weekend.”
“Did… did I interrupt your sleep, Steve Rogers?” Tony asked despite his fear of Steve’s answer. Had he misjudged the situation so terribly?
The question caught Tony on a whim, and with a devilish smirk, he couldn’t resist saying
“And who’s going to cook the meal?” Steve muttered, pushing a hand through his hair. “All I know how to make is breakfast food. What am I going to do, romance him with cinnamon buns?”
“I think,” Steve said eventually, then pursed his lips as he tried to talk and think at the same time. “I’ll—alright, I think I can work with that. When do we need to leave?”
Steve had felt larger than life somehow, an unbridled spirit unlike anything Tony had experienced. Sure, he was a far cry from Mr. Right, but Tony would have loved to have known Steve better as a friend. He refused to accept that Steve’s was one of the nineteen lives claimed in the attack.
“This is Mango,” Georgie continued, “he is a sheltie and corgi mix, and he’s fourteen weeks old. It says here that his favorite food is not mango; good clarification, that.”
“Say no more,” Sam said in a clipped tone, and there it was. The proverbial kick in the teeth. He should have just braced for it, let them rip into him and move on, but Steve held up his phone to show them he had absolutely no messages waiting on his lock screen.
“You know I can’t do Italian—”
“Single, no family,” Tony answered without pause. “Pepper is the only one, she’s my everything. I’ve worked with a few collaborators in the past, but not for those books, and never the same person twice.”
“Why did you get a Ford truck?” Steve asked in a careful tone—a tone that hopefully didn’t make his simmering anger too obvious. “I don’t want to drive a cheap truck.”
“You can handle it,” she promised. “In fact, here are the two cakes; go through them, find the ingredients. If it’s not here, it’s in either fridge. I’ve got other business to sort out, but I’ll be back in half an hour, so you just get us started on all three, alright?”
“Chief, Code 1-8-7,” he reported, his voice frail and unsteady in the sudden crush of anxiety. “Murder-death-kill. Sir.”
Maybe Steve shouldn’t have been so touched that a machine missed him (hell, maybe he should have been creeped out?), but he gently rubbed Dum-E’s arm in greeting. “I’m happy to see you, too,” he said quietly. The whisper of a human voice caught Tony’s attention, and he sat up in his confusion.
“What evidence she has for claiming he cheated and that he was not sober while they were apart,” Maria said first.
Over the past seven months, Steve had learned to cope. He couldn’t even lie to himself yet about moving on, but he was at a place in his life where he could hang out with his friends without missing Tony beside him. He could hear the songs that he knew Tony liked without wanting to cry, and he could remember the good times without resenting the present.
“You made that decision for both of us. Why didn’t you talk to me? Rhodes said you’d known about it for months, why—you never treated me like I was dumb or incapable, so why this? Why was I not qualified to be a part of this decision, Tony?” Steve demanded—begged—to know. “There was nothing we couldn’t do, if we worked together.”
knew he was too small to pick fights with assholes.”
Tony pressed his lips together before he continued doing what they had agreed they (he) wouldn’t do. He needed time to brace himself for the truth, but eventually he nodded his understanding and said, “I didn’t make any plans for our anniversary.”
“And you think I’m upset? We can fix this,” Steve said softly. When Tony looked up, Steve was smiling back at him. “I’ll iron it, what’s—this won’t take two minutes.”
“But you’re the Great Chief now, the Last Chief” Tony said slowly, almost afraid to ask his question. “Yours is the most powerful magic in the world.”
Steve frowned at her and tried to decide on whether to cross his arms or plant his hands on his hips this time. “Tutu is not lingerie.”
“He said he’d keep the search live for two more weeks,” Tony continued after a beat, clearly unbothered by Bruce’s threat. “So now I have two weeks to write a fluff piece women will like.”
“They don’t last as long as American soap operas, that novela lasted thirteen months,” Tony said as if he hadn’t just been mauled and rescued from a three pound puppy. “But I was only 17 when I was introduced on that show, it was my first professional role.”
An hour later, Stephanie took them to a clearing where the sun shone. She lifted the discombobulating haze from Tony’s mind, and, when her dragon took to resting far enough away from them, the fear of being scorched or eaten alive lifted from Clint’s thoughts. They could sit together around a small fire, drink from the clear spring water Stephanie generously shared, and speak of what was to be.
“First of all, your knees are too swollen for anyone else to fit in your dumb pants,” Tony replied, raising his fingers as he counted out his arguments. “Second, who would that be, anyway? Sharon? She deserves better than a booty call, and how would she help your top heavy ass up the stairs? Third,
He had only written two words after that, but they were enough to send a shivering thrill down Tony’s spine.
“My biological ‘dad’ went to prison when I was six,” Clint told him while they wedged the potatoes and halved the bell peppers, only pausing when necessary to make air quotes with his fingers. “I had a brother, Barney. He was old enough to work, so ‘mom’ let him stay at home. When mom found out,” he continued, this time with a smile on his face, “I’d been here almost a month? They’d treated me the same as Tony—chores, allowance, schoolwork. But when mom caught on, she took Tony and me out to Sedona. Two weeks; she spent three to five hours a day in spa treatments while Tony and I did everything we couldn’t do at home. Water parks, balloon rides, helicopter tours. Took horses out to the Grand Canyon, learned how to make bows and arrows ...until Tony tried to rope a buffalo, and we were invited to never leave the resort grounds again. Got my first facial the next day,” he finished with a big grin.
“Why haven’t you told me who that ring belongs to?” Tony asked with a downward twist of his lips.
James Rhodes, Tony’s best friend and - most importantly - the man responsible for Tony’s security. Had Steve’s worst nightmares come true? Had Tony worked himself sick? Had another demented soul made an attempt on Tony’s life in Steve’s absence? The icy chill of terror clawed down Steve’s back without mercy, and in his sudden panic, Steve sat up and groped with wild, uncoordinated hands for the phone.
A variety of framed artwork decorated the scant wallspace available between the arched, floor to ceiling windows, everything from vibrant oil paintings to charcoal sketches of figures in motion. Healthy plants of all shapes and sizes added an inviting warmth, turning the unnaturally attractive apartment into a home.
He took a seat on the other end of the couch and accepted the second of two Sno Balls out of the box. It was still wrapped in its plastic wrapper, and Steve tried to resist the smile of breaking it free. When had he last eaten something so unhealthy and delicious?
“…no you don’t.”
Steve’s brows climbed up his forehead in surprise. “Just like that?”
Tony looked like he had more on his mind, but with those words, the wind knocked out of his sails.
“Could we look at the juvenile menu?” Tony asked before Steve had a chance to answer, and the young woman quickly complied.
As their lips eased apart, Steve still held Tony’s face in his hands with his thumb brushing over Tony’s cheek. Unable to resist, he leaned in for one more kiss. Then quietly, even playfully, he whispered, “If it pleases Your Majesty, your tired, old fiancé would like to sleep so he can wake up tomorrow and exist one day closer to being your husband.”
Luckily, it was BU’s reading week ahead of their final exams, so Steve made the trek out to Cambridge to see Tony after six long days apart.
“He’s smarter than all of us combined, Carol, he—”
“Wait, no—let’s not jump to conclusions!” Tony decided quickly before Steve finished his offer to play the failed boyfriend. He pulled out what had been Jane’s chair recently, indicating for Steve to get comfortable. “Please. Order anything you like, it’s on me. And hi, my name is Tony Stark.”
“Down boy,” Bucky cautioned him.
“Mom, you seen my green sweater around?” Clint wondered as he walked into the kitchen, noticeably calmer about his morning predicament than either Howard or Tony. “I can’t find it anywhere.”
“I could be.”
” Clint cried indignantly, stomping wildly in his distress.
By the second day, Sam and Bucky not only got the right paperwork signed, but they badgered GayArrangements executives to the point that they sent Tony all the necessary data before lunchtime. Using the algorithms he’d developed the night before, Tony (1) identified accounts that were plausible matches to the other victims, then (2) pulled all respective matches of the four victims and (3) cross-referenced them to generate a comprehensive list of the sugar daddies that all four victims matched with (regardless of whether either of them unmatched later).
“Welcome back, thank you for being here!” Stephen smiled at him, both professional and encouraging in his expression.
“This is good,” Tony murmured under his breath, only loud enough for Steve’s ears. “I trust you, Steve, I still do. Anything changes, I’ll let you know. Okay?”
Steve watched as Tony’s eyes lit up in understanding, and to his right, Bucky’s whole face fell. If Steve was right, he had married a minor.
“No: why don’t
With his mother’s words in mind, Tony and Steve had found a way to be friends. Steve had called in December to wish Tony a merry Christmas. Tony had called Steve in January to tell him he’d been invited back to CERN in the spring for experiments he couldn’t complete without the Hadron collider.
Steve had already lost count of how many mornings he’d slept in and missed his train, and subsequently  gotten to his classroom with only fifteen minutes to spare.
“Dad, this is not the time—”
“We live in a cottage in a swamp,” Clint announced in the silence. “A stinky-ass swamp where two sewers dump into the river.”
If he was going to spend this damn weekend missing Steve, then he could make damn sure Steve knew what he was missing in return.
“Dad, stop being such an asshole,” Tony snapped, and grabbed the pen out of his hand to sign first. He went through it carefully, making sure he didn’t miss anything, then handed the pen to Steve. “Here, darling.”
He trailed off with a dodgy look, which told Tony he’d unintentionally toed into non-neutral territory again. But Steve asked for twenty minutes and it was nice to talk to his best friend again, so Tony scrabbled for another safe question.
This close, there was nothing Steve could hide from him. Tony lifted and rolled his hips over the growing bulge in Steve’s jeans and watched, mesmerized, as Steve’s eyes fluttered closed for a beat and his lips parted in a soft gasp of unexpected pleasure.
Just got the call for a meeting today. Might care more if I knew you were in it.
“Buck,” Steve said in a low, warning tone, and he eyed Bucky’s fresh pint and three empty glasses. How quickly had they downed their drinks? Tony was still smiling and cheerful, but there wasn’t a doubt in Steve’s mind that Tony wanted to make a good impression—hell, he’d gone out of his way to get Natasha a birthday present. The last thing Tony needed right now was Steve’s beer-happy friend prodding him with awkward, immature questions.
Tony shifted down in bed the few inches he needed to kiss Steve’s lips, a slow, gentle slide of their lips together. With firm pressure on Steve’s shoulder, he turned them over so that Steve was on his back, and Tony could rest his chin on Steve’s chest.
Tony would know without Steve having made a sound: he'd know what it means to punch into metal like that. He'd be so angry with Steve; impressed, but so angry. The second Steve has his belt and has given his speech, Tony shepherds him out to the locker rooms, and throws everyone - including the medic - out. But once they're alone, he wouldn't say a word. Tony who always talks a mile a minute and is never slow about telling Steve what problem he's got, wouldn't say a word. Steve would probably be scrambling to explain himself and tell Tony why he had to, or why it was worth it, or offer any kind of explanation for defying his manager's call, and the forceful shove into the lockers rattled him almost as much as seeing Tony drop to his knees at his feet, wasting no time pulling Steve's cock out of his shorts, letting his balls hang over the elastic all pushed up and swallowing him down before Steve knows what's happening.
“You’re applying for my internship next year, aren’t you?”
“Fine,” Fury said impatiently. “The government won’t work faster than that anyway. In two weeks you’re either married, or you are resigned.”
If Tony only knew the consuming excitement he stoked in Steve every time he spoke Cimbri. Steve made it about a third of the way into the video before he had to stop. He had been away from Tony for too long, and the temptation to take matters into his own hands nearly overwhelmed him now.
“I guess you can keep it,” Tony said with a quiet sniff, but as soon as Steve smiled back at him, he couldn’t hold back his own answering smile. Steve never shied away from reminding Tony how much he mattered to him, and Tony never tired of hearing it. Without fail, his heart felt like it would beat out of his chest from happiness
Steve blinked once, feeling so blindsided and so confused he didn’t know what to say. All he could do was give Tony a critical once-over, but he couldn’t understand where, exactly, Tony was trying to lose weight.
” Steve blurted out in his shock. “What kind—what?”
“That means a lot to me, Tony. I really never thought I’d hear that, from anyone, and every time I hear it again, it somehow means even more,” Steve admitted, offering Tony the cup finally and doing his best not to let Tony escape the conversation in his obvious embarrassment. “So, yeah. For a long time, I blamed you, but it’s… I wouldn’t change what happened now, even if I could. In whatever backwards way, I have you to thank for this. You had no right, but you did it elegantly and kindly. Nobody could have done it better. So, I guess… thank you.”
Tony blinked wildly at the question, visibly struggling to think. “They were written years apart,” he said so quietly Steve could only wonder if Tony realized he was speaking out loud. “They’re all best sellers, but… I wrote Fathers in History in 97. Sweeping Tide, 2003; Treasure Trail, 2016. Different cities, different… different settings, orientations. I wrote Fathers in History in LA, Sweeping Tide in New Orleans, Treasure Trail in, in Nashville. I can’t think of anything that ties them… except me?”
Eventually, Tony knocked back the last of his drink and cleared his throat. “Yeah. Yeah, we broke up. Two weeks ago,” he added and tried to smile. “Time to get over it, you know?”
“I’ll forget about you hiding from my twenty year old horse, if you’ll forget I ever said that,” Tony muttered all in one breath.
Steve stared down at the menu in shock. Unlike the unreasonable combinations of the regular menu, the children’s menu sounded delicious.
“Shh! Listen to me: if I die tonight, I’ve left you instructions. They’re in my journal, it’s in the office on top of my laptop.”
, is out in theaters now. Please welcome back to The Late Show, Tony Stark!”
“Here, sit,” Steve said before Tony had to respond to Bucky’s transparent jab. He shifted from one stool to the next, letting Tony take a seat between himself and Bucky. “Drink?”
“No, I just got out of the shower. Come in,” Steve stepped aside to hold the door open. “Kitchen’s right through there, help yourself to anything. I’ll be ready in just a minute.”
“Tony?” Stephanie whispered, confused. “Tony, are—did they hurt you? Did they touch you?”
Steve chuckled quietly despite his attempt to look upset by Tony’s nonchalant march through a downpour. “Warm up first,” he tried to say without returning Tony’s smile, “and maybe later you’ll get lucky.”
He had to remind himself that they were not here for leisure, or for Steve to find his place among the wrong people. They were here to catch a villain, and to stop him before he hurt others.
“What can I do?” Tony asked in a whisper, doing everything not to add to Steve’s problems. “You are welcome to stay, if you like. There’s a guest room; a warm bath? A shower?”
“My mom betrayed me,” Steve answered at the same time as Tony said, “He has a crush on Sam Heughan.”
Steve was going to be sick. He needed to get away from these loudmouthed vigilantes, but there was no easy way past them. He tried to wrap his arms over his head to block them out, but they were so loud and so close. It was finally Carol who started ordering them to take a step back and to give her and Steve some space. They meant well, but they were a little dumb as a herd.
“I couldn’t sleep,” Steve admitted in a whisper, careful of his tone even though Patrick happily snored in his bed on his half of the room. “It feels so strange. In three months, I’ll be an adult. A real adult, with a job and bills and… I don’t really know what else adults do,” he finished lamely, shrugging to himself. “But I’ll have to figure it out.”
Bucky laughed so hard he honked, while Tony glared daggers at his friends.
Experience had taught Steve that honesty in its entirety was never a safe option. Tony was forgiving, and Tony was kind; he was protective and he made Steve feel safe, but whether he knew it or not, Tony knew too much about Steve. Already he had more emotional ammunition than other one-night-stands and Johns had ever enjoyed against Steve in the past.
Steve couldn’t believe his eyes. He had expected something more straightforward, like doing his homework problems together, not learning the whole class from the ground up. When Tony had found the time to even approach this kind of organization for
wearing a fucking tutu. Tony would laugh me out of the city!”
Paulette laughed, stealing Steve away from the memory of giddy euphoria in Tony’s eyes as Steve chased his pleasure in Tony’s slack, satisfied body, and bringing him back to the present.
The tunnels of the sewer system were vast, unclean, and inhospitable. What the Scraps had done by laying down plans to create space where there was none, then filled it with families and little business fronts, was nothing short of the miracle Tony had been told of New Yorseylvania all his life.
“The scenes the killer took from? All three cases fall into the specific ‘so spectacular it had to be commemorated’ category. I don’t know how he would have know. I’ve been reading them out loud, I’m trying to compare them to see—even Pepper’s helped, and we think there may be a change in tone that a very careful reader might detect. I’ve convinced myself, anyway, that they could tell the difference between imaginary and real, but what I can’t figure out is how anyone can separate ‘real and planned’ from ‘real but improvised’,” he admitted with a frown. “I’ve been trying all afternoon, but I’m at the point where words don’t look like words anymore. I thought maybe you’d have more luck? All the real and staged scenes are here on the table. Everything printed is ‘real and improvised’, and they’re all arranged around the books or series they belong to.”
What mature, reasonable option did Steve have but to give chase?
“Weather in California,” Tony mused, so lazy and content that he couldn’t quite find the energy to fully snark. “How bizarre.”
“The computer identifies a trade or skill most suited to your genetic composition and selects one by cross-referencing all services projected to best serve society at the time of your release,” Tony explained again. “It takes into account your hormonal predisposition, your predisposition for certain injuries, your projected height—”
“Be silent, Steve Rogers,” Tony said under his breath while Bruce was not yet far enough away to be out of earshot. “The risk is too great, I will not allow it. I descend first.”
“They would not dare touch you, my love,” Tony murmured, his voice still deep from sleep. His curls swept around his hair in a whirlwind of bedhead, and as affectionate and playful as he was first thing in the morning, he meant every word that he said. “Coulson has Pepper’s highest recommendation. Not even I have that.”
Steve pursed his lips at Sharon’s question and looked down at his outfit. “What’s wrong with it?”
“Does he still fit in Bucky’s clothes?” Tony wondered, ignoring Steve and directing his question to Natasha. “He wears smart clothes sometimes.”
“If you’re interested,” Steve said more carefully. “I’m happy to tell her we didn’t work out—”
, it connected across Steve’s left temple and the force of it threw Steve into a wall. Tony lunged to catch him, but Steve was too dazed, off-balance, and already falling; Tony didn’t stand a chance. They crumbled together an uncoordinated heap, with Tony cradling Steve in his arms.
Tony blinked at him in shock. Steve had already left the table and marching away when Tony managed to stutter, “But—Steve Rogers, why? What is happening—”
“Would that come in in time for you—sorry,” Steve said suddenly as he finally caught himself being far too much of himself. He cleared his throat and tried a bashful smile. “Sorry, that’s shop talk. We can talk about something else?”
Steve was negotiating with himself about which salad he should make and which calzone said salad would be better with when suddenly a muffled cry caught his attention. He spun around and hurried back to the hallway where he’d last seen Tony—and sure enough, there he was, just where Steve had left him, and paler than Steve had ever seen him.
“It’s just an adhesive, it washes off,” Tony promised, but when Rhodey narrowed his eyes, he smiled a little nervously. “I think. I made it! It will work.”
Steve pressed his thumbs into Tony’s ass to stretched his fingered hole wider still. After the recent concentrated baiting of a prostate orgasm he’d been denied, Tony still saw the world through a haze of impatience and lust, but none of it seemed to matter to Steve. Tony held his breath and watched the uncharacteristic, single-minded hunger in Steve’s eyes—not for Tony, as it almost always was, or for Steve’s own pleasure, but for Tony’s ass.
“You wouldn’t.”
Near the turn leading away from the press he happened to run into Carol herself. Her Marvel Initiative connected young and working age refugees with work-study programs and in-demand training opportunities that provided them with the practical experience and skill sets necessary to become independent, and self-sufficient Americans across the country. Tony had been onboard from day one, and it was one of the few annual events Steve never missed.
“Mine,” Steve murmured against Tony’s lips as they eventually slipped apart. Tony hummed softly in reply, chasing Steve’s lips with one more quick, but eager, kiss.
In soft, careful words, Tony asked, “Do you want to talk about it?”
It was only meant to be a peck, but Steve couldn’t resist getting his arms around Tony and pulling him into his lap to give him a hungry, filthy kiss worth coming back to continue. When he finally let Tony pull away they were both panting for breath, and Steve could barely tear his attention from Tony’s swollen, spit-slick red lips.
“Shut up, man. You’re black. Don’t make it a race thing,” Bucky groaned, “
Tony made a face. “How many points are there?”
“She’s—”
Tony filled his mouth with three thick fingers, almost choking with the effort to swallow them all to the last knuckle and bobbing his head on their full length. The wet, slick heat sensation of Tony’s mouth stirred the inevitable pressure coiling and building behind Steve’s cock. He worked their length with his tongue, sucked on them eagerly.
Steve took a moment to brace himself. This morning, facing the world had felt impossible, but he’d done it anyway and it hadn’t been half as difficult as he’d imagined.
People had sex every day, all around the world. Anal sex was common enough - many women even, who had a clear alternative, were open to it. But with a man like Steve… well. Tony had his doubts.
“Better than sending pictures of strangers’ vaginas,” he muttered, only partially invested in the conversation. “Opened or otherwise.”
“You’re serious,” Tony marveled in a whisper after an agonizing silence. “You have feelings for me?”
“And you think I don’t know how to be happy?”
“Bruce Banner, if the immeasurably vile Johann Schmidt, heinous traitor Brock Rumlow, or self-serving Zemo committed half the atrocities recreated by 21st century cinematic masters, we should lionize Captain America for his extensive efforts to save civilization, not—not penalize him for minor blunders.”
“Never gotten a boner smelling home before.”
“Our preeminent Governor Alexander G. Pierce has sanctioned any and all resources in our power to stop and capture this maniac,” he told them. “Six Lieutenants MDK’d within tick tocks. He has intimate knowledge of our vehicles and our weapons, and enough information about our city to disappear. I ask you: what else is there to do ‘in our power’?”
“Where,” Steve demanded to know, but Bucky wouldn’t look away from the news on the TV to meet his eyes.
It was a perfectly respectable Tuesday morning and his brightly colored, vibrating, top of the line
Senior in college.
“Easy, Sparky,” Tony rumbled with a deep, throaty laugh. “Tonight’s my night, isn’t it?”
“Sir,” Tony said to Fury quietly, attempting to sound and act deferential despite his desperate need to get back on that terminal. “Is the doctor’s conveyance still in the parking lot?”
Steve did as he was told, but he couldn’t help but stare. He’d never met a male manicurist before. “You?”
The phone rang in his hand for only a few seconds before Tony picked up.
“What? Those are terrible initials,” Tony started to complain, but before he finished his sentence, Steve snapped in with, “Gregory Peck!”
“Remember what the Captain said: we have two days,” Steve reminded his partner as he gathered up his coat and gloves. “Let’s find the man who sent that letter.”
Tony stared at him in open shock, but he couldn’t seem to move. “What does that mean?” he finally asked, only loud enough to be heard in the silence between them.
At first, Steve only knew to nod in reply. He had expected this kind of reaction in the moment at Dr. Odinson’s office, when he first shared his practiced rationale for why he wanted to be with Tony. Now, in a more intimate and unstructured context, he wasn’t so sure what to do with Tony’s unexpected vulnerability.
“Here you are… jogging on the beach, or auditioning for Baywatch? We’ll never tell. And what’s this?” Graham whispered in a deep rumble. He had stopped at a candid photo of Tony in his running tights, wiping the sweat off his face with the bottom of his shirt. The photo was taken at an angle, nearly at profile, and it showed off his strong thighs, a teasing flash of his abs, and most importantly, highlighted the perky, generous curve of his ass.
Tony’s mortified heart stopped beating.
Their server was immediately there with their waters, and Steve ordered the same burger Tony was there to eat. It almost felt like a normal dinner with a friend, until the server left and they were left together in their silence.
Steve took a small step closer and looked down at him with a smile. “Will I need to carry you up the ladder, my prince?”
After another beat of silent reflection, Sarah seemed to make up her mind. She smiled and nodded in understanding. “What’s your plan?”
“Steve Rogers!” Tony said with a smile warm in his voice. “I have been waiting for you.”
“Steve Rogers!” he heard someone shout as his body shook. “Steve Rogers, I demand you wake this instant, you are frightening me and I cannot help you if you continue to sleep!”
The man let Tony balance against his arm while unlocking his door, and it took him a minute to realize Mr. Perfect was patting Marple with his free hand. He shrugged inwardly; at least one of them enjoyed Mr. Perfect’s love today.
Bucky stared at him for a long minute. “I’m not drunk enough for this conversation.”
From his side of the office, Tony perked up and attacked his computer terminal with newfound vigor.
Except watching it live, that look wasn’t the tawdry, lascivious glance the picture made it out to be. Even with that wailing voice of jealousy crying for dominance in his heart, Steve easily recognized the bid for support in Channing’s eyes when he glanced across at Tony, and the reassurance offered by Tony when he smiled back.
The next morning Steve got to the station with a spring in his step and a smile bright enough to make heads turn. It had been difficult to leave Tony that morning, nestled as he was in his cozy blankets. Snuggling closer and indulging in Tony’s languid kisses and sleep-warm body would have been heavenly. But they had a new angle on the case, and if there was one thing Steve needed to do - for Tony and for himself - it was to clear Tony’s name once and for all.
“Then, why don’t you stay, Tony? We have a lot to talk about.”
Was it possible to love Tony more than he already did?
When Tony woke up the next morning, Steve was already awake and watching him.
“No, my pet,” Steve promised. “They won’t ever touch you again.”
“I work in Lumine, my family is from Viole. It is a village not so far from here,” he explained, and Tony took a seat to listen. “My mother could not come, and my girlfriend wanted to come see me, but I told her to stay in Viole. I do not want for her to see me… like this,” he finished half-heartedly, gesturing at his face and upper body. Orfeo had clearly been thrown by the blast, and while his injuries were not severe or life threatening, he had many bruises and a number of minor stitches.
“You look,” Steve started to say as he trailed after Tony like a duckling. His sentenced hung in the air between them, unfinished until he could think of an honest conclusion. You look hot? You look hotter than ever? Take me to bed or lose me forever?
Steve turned to look at him at that, hesitant but amused. “The P-word,” he whispered in clear surprise.
Before their exams, Dr. Siharulidze would leave a graduate student in charge of observing the classroom for certain hours after class for those undergrads who needed the space to work on their final projects. Sharon was bringing out her pens, and Steve guessed she’d chosen to do one of the parts of her midterm project in ink. It wasn’t his favorite, but then again, if he was as good as her with the ink, maybe he would have liked it more.
“Steve, Stark’s saying that if we want to meet, we should do it somewhere no-one will recognize us. I mean,” he paused, and Steve could hear a thud in the background. Then, sounding very awkward in his attempt at cryptic-casual, “I mean, why don’t you join us? We’re at Tony’s place, just ...hanging out?”
He wasn’t on a job, and he wasn’t on a deadline: this time, Steve was showing off his pet for the audience. With a twist of his curled fingers, he had Tony shuddering with a breathless gasp, and when a third and fourth finger pushed in, enough sweat and precum dripped from Tony’s willing, desperate body that a number of people in the audience were already moving closer.
The audience cheered, and this time, even Miriam shared in their excitement.
“Captain Steven G. Rogers, cease this madness!” Fury bellowed. “If you wish to see another day of sunshine, I strongly recommend that you enhance your calm and lower your weapon at once.”
“Why does his body have so much… volume?” Bruce asked without thinking, presumably expecting Tony to answer. But when he glanced at Tony, Tony was in the process of pulling at the clasps and ties of his uniform jacket. “Tony Stark, what are you doing? Have you no sense of decorum?”
With that Tony turned to kiss Carol on the cheek, wished her luck with the last of the carpet, and promised he’d see her ‘on the other side’.
“Would you like me to pick up groceries on the way back?”
“Unforgivable,” he murmured in agreement against Steve’s wet lips. “You should take off your shirt so I can see how wrong she is.”
Shuri wished him luck for the day, and Tony reminded him that he loved him dearly before Lila blew him a kiss and turned off the recording.
Lila had to go to bed after that, but the rest of them stayed in the kitchen for hours, repeating the whole process over wine. They raided the kitchen pantry for dried fruit and more nuts that they could try in new combinations. The next batch they made with limoncello and dried fig and powdered with confectioners sugar, and they gobbled it down like wolves until their stomachs were too full and the sugar crash hit hard. Happy, warm from wine, and stuffed to the gills with sugar and fried dough, they begged off to bed and left round three for another day.
“Take him to see the roof top view from the Empire State Building at sunset.”
Steve looked like he was going to ask a question when a sudden flash of light startled them both. Tony turned and Steve looked up as another flash went off.
“Like hell you do.”
“Aw, sorry, mate, that isn’t it,” Karl said sympathetically, and as Tony instinctively turned to look at Steve in confusion, he heard the name of the last song he would ever have guessed.
He slipped out of the van unnoticed, locked it back up, and headed into the pub for a drink of his own. Steve wasn’t letting the ratty crew out of his sight until he was sure they were headed to London, and besides, they were treating everyone to a free pint. An ironic perk of the job.
“Everything I needed to know.”
Their waiter brought their salads around first, and he hadn’t forgotten Tony’s two side plates. The conversation was briefly derailed into casual chit chat over the food as they each took some of kale and quinoa salads, but once the waiter was well out of earshot, Tony gave Steve a little kick under the table and asked, “Can you talk about it?”
Clint frowned and crossed his arms over his chest, clearly very unimpressed. “That ain’t fair! I want the best cinnamon rolls, too.”
Steve reminded himself that there was nothing inherently wrong about spending a Sunday afternoon having dinner at a high-end oyster bar with a beautiful woman. He reminded himself that Tony was under no obligation to tell him about every detail in his life.
One of them whined, another one growled, and Tony tugged on Steve’s hair for more.
“So good for me,” Steve praised him in a whisper, easing the fully loaded canister out of Tony and letting it fall to the mattress. He braced Tony’s legs with care, gently lying them out on his bed and rubbing his sore thighs out, even slipping two lubed fingers around and into his hole to be sure there was no bleeding or tearing to worry about.
His admission burned through Tony with a devastating shock and a bitter validation at the same time. Tony
By the time Tony and Bucky made their way back to Steve, Natasha was nowhere to be seen.
“I have to think about my future, Steve. I care about you, and believe me, I never expected to be doing this. But one day you’ll look back on this and agree that breaking up was the right thing to do for both of us.”
This time, Steve defied his expectations. Instead of disgust, or heartache, or even pity, Steve’s expression was thoughtful.
“I,” he stammered, but ironically, he couldn’t think of anything to say.
“Our computer’s algorithms are more effective and efficient than one meat-eater’s suspicions,” Fury replied with a low, dangerous bite in every word. “It has considered every feasible scenario in order to calculate his next target. Do not project your own inclination for violence onto others, Captain Steven G. Rogers. Just because you fail to contain your primal urges does not mean that he cannot.”
Tony’s life flashed before his eyes - his childhood rolling colorful fruit chewies in sodium alginate with his mother, who taught him chemistry was for more than medicine, or his teenage years hiding books on combustion engines or Bruce Lee laser discs from his father, who couldn’t understand why his son was so determined to scare all chances of mentorship away. He lived and died in that sole heartbeat. Like the celestial refuse that occasionally streaked across the sky, the obscene mass of Captain Steve Rogers was hurtling down the ladder at an alarming speed.
“First thing I could I moved ma out to California. She’s… the cold hurts her bones, you know. She’s doing okay; she’d love to see you,” Bucky couldn’t help but add with a smile. “The kids are with her for now. She thinks we’re on vacation, none of them… at least Maya let me have that. I can’t tell her, not like this.”
“Steve, you have to count on Hawley kicking you out tonight. There’s a good chance she’ll take this personally, and I wouldn’t blame her. It’s unusual to take on first-year students, and this… this is not the press what she expected.”
“You look great, Tony. It’s good to see you,” he managed in the end, like a coward. But Tony still turned to smile at him.
“The irony is, I couldn’t really run in Atlanta. I don’t know how they got that picture of me, I got maybe a dozen uphill sprints a day and I was done. That’s a five minute window. You see, we don’t have ‘weather’ in LA. Once you’ve lived there too long, you forget what humidity even feels like. And Georgia doesn’t mess around, their humidity is something to fear. Actually, funny story. Uphill sprints are fine for a workout, but it doesn’t clear my mind like running does. So while we were there, I got a membership to this pilates studio. Usually, I could only go to those random mid-afternoon classes when they didn’t need me on set. Except, it turns out those mid-day classes were designed for… well, the more mature demographic. I called it ‘pilates for the elderly and me.’ But there were these three beautiful, fun-loving ladies who’d come to every class; they’d lived in Atlanta their whole lives, known each other since middle school, the Nixon era, something like that. And they, they took me in. They’re my Atlanta family now.”
“I’ll find something. Thanks, Happy,” Steve replied, and with a sweep of his finger he called up the media control panel on the backseat console. In no time he had the sixth episode of the Last Days of August pulled up, and as they crawled through the Manhattan afternoon traffic, he caught up on Jon Ronson’s podcast.
“Put him down, come on!” Sharon told them, and Bucky quickly let go so he and Steve could hurry over to where Carol and Sharon were waiting.
“What if I am bad?” he breathed, hating the words even as he spoke them. “What if I ruin our honeymoon?”
“Do you want me to call a cab?” Tony glowered with an accusative shove of his fork.
Steve said something under his breath, but came back to the bench eventually and clicked and scrolled around to appease her, until something genuinely caught his eye. He stopped, his fingers hovering over the mousepad like a predator at the ready. Carefully, he glanced at Sharon without turning his head as if to see if he’d been caught, but she was too busy pretending to check her nails to let him know she was watching like a hawk.
“I’m not far,” Tony promised, and sure enough, they were around the corner right in time. “That’s me,” he explained, pointing out his brownstone. “Across the street and up the stairs.”
“That’s why I think it's time for us to—”
His cheek was smushed against the firm couch cushion, contorting half his face. Clearly, Tony was too comfortable to care, and Steve couldn’t stop smiling up at him if he’d wanted to.
“You were
“And what, go in there shirtless?” Steve asked dryly. “That’ll sure attract the right crowd.”
With a quiet sound of understanding, Tony raised his voice to say, “I’ve been going over my stories with Pepper this past week, and I think—I can’t be sure if it’s even noticeable to others, but there may be something else connecting the specific scenes the murderer used for his crimes. I can come down to the station and explain, I can be there in forty minutes, maybe thirty—”
“But all this time—”
“Off the clock. Call me a consultant,” Tony said, a touch calmer. “Steve, whoever this is, he’s escalating and you don’t even know his motives. Eight to ten months between each of the first three victims, now four months between the last two? If he hasn’t crossed state lines yet, it’s only a matter of time. You need me.”
He returned to bed with the pouch, and the lube and condoms Steve had brought with him. Before getting back in bed with Steve, however, Tony started to undo his own shirt.
A whisper of wheels and gentle beeps approached Steve from behind, and he turned in time to see Dum-E barreling down at him, top-speed. The robot twirled around him in a blatant display of delight, chirping loudly with every spin.
Tony and Channing seemed equally understanding of the college-age logic while Rob, at the other end of the couch, felt the need to point out: “With a
“I am very confused by what you think my type is,” Steve observed quietly, struggling to form any rational response. “But, I can fuck them all once each? That’s allowed?”
“Why did you even keep coffee in the house when I was little?” Tony complained between one delicious cup of coffee and the next. “You knew it would stunt my growth.”
“Platinum? Titanium?” Tony asked with a slight quiver in his voice, losing himself momentarily as Steve made his way down to his nipples, humming in the affirmative all the way. “Gummi? Ring pop?”
“No-one but her,” the man said with a small shake of his head. “I cried a lot, gained twenty pounds. She even took the dog, man. So I got a loan and picked up this place, with an apartment upstairs to call my own. It’s been alright since, just… lonely, you know? I miss that dog. A week before his third birthday, too.”
For someone who was bracing himself for some 20th century midwestern courting ritual, Tony couldn’t believe what he was hearing. All he could do was nod and hope Steve understood.
“Eat. You’ll feel better,” Clint said, shoving a plate with a packed cheeseburger and grilled potato wedges in front of Steve.
From that early age, his mom had impressed on him that as different as people could be, wherever they came from - rich or poor, foreign or local - all people sought and cherished the same principles: love and respect. Steve didn’t have to change the world, but if he recognized people’s fear and insecurities through their anger and offered love and respect in kind, he might change the world for one person.
“He has to stay,” Bruce countered before Steve had a chance to speak for himself. “We just arrested our leader, our savior. What will we do? How will we live?”
“Hey everybody! My first guest tonight is an actor who’s been in the business less than three years and he’s already a household name. You know him from
“How hungry are you? I’m too tired to sit,” he announced when Tony naturally made for the dining room. “Bedroom?”
Steve thought nothing of following the medics carrying Tony away until Bucky grabbed him by the arm and turned him around. Instinctively, Steve reached for the gurney to keep the medics from carrying Tony away from him while his back was turned.
Steve straightened and spun to face Natasha with well practiced charm. He found her standing close enough that the scent of her perfume filled his senses, a spicy, intoxicating spell he could find himself falling under given half a chance.
Steve turned towards Tony and nodded in acknowledgement. He finished the fight he was caught in by snatching the two villains by their throats and clobbering their heads into the wall. Around them, the Scraps were winning the fight, and Steve stepped over dead and unconscious bodies alike to reach Tony.
robbed
“Happy to be here, thank you for having me,” Tony replied, addressing both Stephen and the audience.
Tony visibly deflated, but he contained whatever groan of disappointment before Steve could hear it. “If Coulson feels it is necessary, it must be so. But I will speak to Pepper about amendments to your schedule on your first official engagement.”
He watched in silence from the sidelines as Bucky comforted his ward, helped Steve through his grief and even helped him find his smile again. The Scraps gathered around them at Bucky’s request, introducing themselves to Steve with genuine smiles and eager handshakes.
Steve was silent after the woman’s explanation, then in irritated bewilderment, he turned to Tony with a shrug, as if to say, ‘so what?’
much worse.
Tony growled at Bond’s easy flirting. Engaging with him wasn’t worth the headache. “I’m running the remote tracker now,” Tony told him in a tired voice. “Stand by. Confirm current location.”
“You… are not married?”
“I’m here and I’ll never go anywhere or amount to anything because I’m going to fail. I’m going to
Carol could see his plan falling apart. She shook her head. “Maybe save this for a one-year anniversary? That doesn’t sound like something you wouldn’t want to rush.”
He hadn’t handled it so well. Tony had shot up in bed, he had shouted at Steve - not in anger, but out of fear. Back then, he could never have imagined that his strong, happy, and safe Steve still suffered nightmares from his time in the war. Steve told him later that he’d been back in the trenches with his dad that night. Maybe his feet had been cold in his sleep and it had triggered the memory of his cold, wet feet in worn out combat boots, maybe the wailing winds reminded him of the men too young for war.
If he stared at the page long enough, the words stopped having meaning and just turned into cock soup. Here a cock, there a cock, everywhere you look there was cock. Having a crisis over cocks was not appropriate for a Tuesday mid-afternoon at the library, not by any stretch of the imagination. All around him students were working on perfectly reasonable activities, like typing up term papers, or making notecards.
“I had a long day, I’m getting dinner and falling asleep to whatever stupid shit the TV is playing. The last thing I need is jet lag,” he added with a little shake of his head.
They rode back to Steve’s place and up the elevator in silence, but the moment the door closed behind them in the apartment, Tony spun on his heel to face Steve.
“It won’t be. It can’t be,” Tony conceded quietly, instinctively curling his fingers into Steve’s soft shirt in case he tried to pull away. When Steve didn’t try to distance himself, Tony dared to glance up from his tempting lips to hold his gaze as he slowly drew him closer.
For Tony, it had started as a comforting, loving gesture. In all the time Tony had known Steve, Steve had been respectful of his boundaries. So in the months leading up to their marriage Tony would often invite his visiting fiancée into his bed, or take matters into his own hands and crawl into Steve’s.
But instead of obeying his demands, he only got a quiet laugh in reply and a squeeze of his shoulder. “Tony, we got less than an hour before we’re live on the Today show, we can’t—we don’t have time to—”
As the third canister was pulled out of his body, the cock sleeve again was lifted from him and replaced with another, and the process repeated round after round, one orgasm after another, until Tony’s orgasms were dry and both women had been inseminated multiple times.
Steve needed a second—and a quick glance at the headboard—to remember where they were. “Appears so,” he grinned, far too delighted. “I helped put it together, too. Are you impressed?”
________________
“You’re not alone, Steve,” Tony promised, gentle but unyielding. “You are not alone.”
“Tony, you can’t think that way,” Steve tried to remind him, but Tony wouldn’t have it. The blood had drained from his face, and he only seemed compelled to stand by the power of his surging guilt.
Steve stopped and immediately backed off. “I don’t know what that text says, Tony,” he said in deliberately gentle and calm voice, “but, if it’s Carter, she’s my assistant. She happened to be with me when we first met. She, she’s the one who calls you that,” he clarified in his own defense.
If he was going to end up with anyone, who better than captain fucking america?
And it wasn’t an emergency, was it? Steve looked at the beautifully decorated wicker basket next to him with its assortment of 24 enormous muffins. He was at Harvard Law School, in the finest clothes, all because his mother loved and believed in him, and his professors had been there when he needed them.
Tony snorted quietly at the dumb joke and smacked Steve on the arm, though he was still too comfortable and comforted in Steve’s arms to move away. “Jokes like that will be the reason why I’ll be asleep when you get back tonight.”
He glanced over at Phil, the closest familiar face in the group, and asked, “What’s going on?”
“It’s been four months, how’re you still so gross? Fuck you both.” Bucky groused loudly, and since they were at his stop, he trudged down the stairs while giving them both the finger. “Call me when you’re over the honeymoon phase bullshit!”
The video began with Tony and Jim in a marketplace unlike anything Eisenturm, and Steve recognized Fiorera’s Saturday market in a heartbeat. The voices in the background and the jaunty, uplifting music of the fisarmonica brought him right back to happy memories walking through the market with his mother. Unlike the markets in Machtberg where most people arrived with purpose and attentively perused groceries and wares, old marketplaces of Terrini were a site for socializing with friends near and far.
In the surrounding commotion of arresting Pierce and containing Rumlow, it was Bruce who first rushed to help Steve with Tony. “We must put pressure on the wound—”
“Let’s; you haven’t led me astray yet,” Tony reminded him happily. “Can’t wait to see you tonight, boo.”
“And did you get the seats upgraded?” he asked, concluding the previous conversation by starting a new one.
Tony was about to answer him, but Steve bowed his head to take his lips in a tender kiss. Tony moaned with surprised delight and eagerly responded, deepening the kiss with a sudden needful hunger until Steve experimentally rocked his hips forward; a whimper escaped between them as Tony’s mouth fell open in surprise, and Steve swallowed it with another kiss, and another, soothing Tony with a string of worshiping and playful kisses as he gradually, carefully, built up to a slow, shallow rhythm.
The shrill scream rang through the air like a lovesick bullhorn. Tony turned, slowly and calmly, because after all, he was Tony Stark. Tony Stark laughed in the face of danger.
