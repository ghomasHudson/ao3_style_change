Steve sits up and turns over to the edge, head in his hands as he takes a moment to push the nightmares back. Tony’s all too familiar with the feeling.  “It’s fine, Tony,” Steve replies. “I’m grateful.”
Steve laughs a little bit.  It’s still subdued, but it’s real. “Emotions,” he replies, shrugging.  “I think we’re both bad at them.”
"It's a bit too large here," Rhodey muses. "Feels like I am rattling around your old mansion." He takes another sip of coffee.
Steve chuckles softly, and Tony turns his head back into the pillow. Soft fingers card through his hair. “I thought you wanted this casual Tony. I was trying to not make any assumptions.”
“Rule number one,” Vision utters with a grin, and then a loud cheer comes across the comms, and Tony realizes that he had been basically on speaker phone.
Steve doesn't say anything as he puts the corn he's been slicing from a cob in a bowl.  The silence that fills between them isn't tinged with anything.  It feels like the moment after a fight, when they look at each other, sweaty and sometimes streaked in blood.  Happy to both still be here, relatively okay and making it to another day.
“I miss you,” Tony whispers brokenly to the woman standing in front of him. It feels ripped from him, and it aches even more knowing that she can’t hear him since it isn’t the memory version of him that says it.
They both reach out and Tony wraps his arms around them, securing them on his feet the best he can while locking his arms in place as he comes to a near stop and then rocketing upwards.
Tony hadn’t been sure T’Challa had known what he had done.  Not all of it.  He nods shortly.  “I’ll think about it.”
She laughed her delighted laugh. The one she gives Jarvis when he picks her up and spins her around. "Oh
Once he has every surface, he takes the time to wipe down the fridge's handles. It's to get the handprints off the stainless steel, and he doesn't think about the fact he could be wiping away of Nat's moody periogies by the dozen that is either made in utter silence or quiet humming. He adjusts the magnets Clint uses to display the portraits of the Avengers he got as "fanmail".
“As an eighteen wheeler taking out McDreamy.”  He throws his hands up when all he gets back is a head tilt and the noise of the lenses adjusting. “Seriously?  Your aunt doesn’t watch Grey’s Anatomy?”
“So, I’ve been working with Dr. Perez in robotics.  I got interested in the prosthetic unit when I met a mentor had almost lost the use of his legs in an accident,” Peter starts, gripping the tablet tightly.
T’Challa nods to the swath of bandages on his right.  “This is because of that battle, isn’t it?”  Tony shrugs the best he can before wincing.    “Then you should have told me you were compromised before we went into battle together.”
The second sheet comes off, and his mother looks like she’s asleep except for the dull bruise under her throat. The lines of her face look starker in the morgue’s light. She is still when he is so used to her in motion.
Steve comes in late every day in some variation on a military uniform.  He doesn’t say much about what he does. Just asks Tony about his day, avoids questions about giving away too much, just reminisces about the times before the Civil War.  He remembers highlights. Not all the details.
The other object neatly skims the bottom of his boots, and Tony shoots it, just to break up the organic matter  before it rains down on the people underneath him. “Who threw that Fry?” He asks, as the screen zooms in on Thanos.
He tries to borrow some of that calm, that balance, that T’Challa exudes.  The same calm he finds from time to time when he feels like he is bobbing above the water that is the onslaught of the last five years.  The moments have gotten fainter, he knows, since the moment Wanda waved her hands around his head, but that isn’t when it began.
Tony shouts, “Pause it FRIDAY” as he covers his eyes and grasps for a chair. He can’t find one, so he slumps to the floor.  The open lab feels too small, like it is closing in on him and his throat
"You just talked to me yesterday Pepper. What the hell?" He protests, even as his hands grip the back of her blazer tight enough to wrinkle.  He knows she could complain if she wasn't doing exactly the same thing.
The dark headed man isn't satisfied. "Isn't it dangerous to have misplaced the Hulk? Should the public be panicking?"
But then again, Steve’s name at the wrong moment had made her go silent and stare out the window for hours in the 90’s, so Peggy isn’t one to let go of grief easily. Sometimes, Tony wonders if he inherited that trait from her, or it was something he compounded with Howard’s propensity for dwelling.  Or maybe a little of both.
It’s been eating him alive the entire time it’s been doing down.  Now’s just a little worse than before.
Steve studies him for a long time before replying, “You’ve been the man left behind a lot, haven’t you Tony?”
“I know the feeling,” Tony says, ironically.  He fidgets and puts his hands in his pockets. “God it’s like I forgot how to be around you in the two years, even though I didn’t do that when I was sort of comatose and half dead for 300 years in ice.”
Tony doesn’t ask, and Steve doesn’t offer anything about his time before the ice.  Of course Tony knows things, went to bed on really good nights with stories from Peggy about Steve.  How he rushed into a base ill prepared, only really focusing on saving his best friend. Tony inherited enough memorabilia to create a Smithsonian exhibit dedicated to Captain America and the Howling Commandos.
They will go out and get burgers or other food and Tony will tell him something, light up while he explains and Steve will sink into the feeling of Tony's undivided attention.
If there is an ‘after everything’, but Tony pushes away the thought, because he doesn’t have time to entertain it now.
Tony contemplates the green board for a moment before turning his gaze back to his father.  He can see Mom watching the scene intently.  Her eyes are on both of them, dominoes abandoned completely, while Jarvis and Ana consulting over the unfinished game.
“Tony,” Bruce says softly.  His entire frame is hunches, and he’s clutching the chair like it’s the only thing hold him up.  “Not okay Tony.”
“Am I not?” Tony asks, and something complicated passes over Daniel’s face.  It’s too fast and Tony isn’t familiar enough with the emotions on Daniel’s face to follow it.
Tony takes a moment to gather where he is.  He had gone under remembering the old hurt of missing Aunt Peggy.  It’s been a constant ache that has been with him for the last five years.
“I used to know how to break something down and put it back together,” Tony says.  He has the replicator like food thing broken down into pieces in front of him. Some are twisted and bent, others are carefully ordered and organized.  He feels the glass all around him, and when he shifts, he feels it underneath his feet as well. Cutting in.
When Tony doesn’t feel like he’s going to drown today, he turns to Yinsen, who is watching him closely.  “Again?” he utters, voice raw.
All of a sudden, he hears the whale echos as it slams into him.  Tony feels the breath knocked out him for a second, alarms blaring as Friday says “boss” in an increasingly stressed tone.
Steve leans on the kitchen counter, and Tony watches it light up.  The display shows off different household systems, waiting to be tapped and opened for more details than the simple dashboard views.
Later - Tony watches the Peter video more often than he would like to admit to.  It’s a reminder of his mistakes, he tells himself, FRIDAY, Rhodes.  He has to be aware to keep himself from slipping.
Steven's taken the second guy out viciously and is running across the room to the man on the table, panicked.  "it's not him.  It's not him," Tony repeats as Steve comes to a stop and reaches out.
Hands promptly appear in the air, and Tony leans around glancing at the faces in the crowd. His lips press together briefly, before pointing, "You. Jennifer is that you? Still with CNN?"
“There’s no good way,” he whispers as Steve’s fingers trail down his nose until he stops right before his fingers brush Tony’s lips.
is doing research for SI at this time and has been communicating his location through his reports back to his research team. Okay, who is our next contestant?"
Tony waves around the tower, “I literally have labs all over New York you can pop in and call for Friday to come do the hard work for you.  It is absolutely not useful to learn it by hand and you’ll ruin your eyesight.”
He wakes up in the Compound’s medical wing.  Too stiff bed underneath causing new aches and pains.  His vision goes in and out for a while, and he’s not sure how long it is before he can finally make out where he is and who is there.  Rhodey, always faithful, hunched over in the chair, arms on his knees and forehead pressed against his fists.
He stays in his seat, watches the news and people give differing opinions about his motives, his face, his everything until Peter comes bounding down the stairs, chattering loudly with Bruce and Rhodey.  Vision fades into view.
Natasha asks how long it will take to call the others to arms, and T’Challa spins the ring on his finger until his nail hits an edge on the smooth metal and the band lights up for a moment before pulsing silently, a royal purple.  He nods to the bay window behind them, and they watch as people begin to file into buildings and then out.
He stands and wobbles.  Bruce stays in his chair, carefully not projecting his study of Tony as he moves.  "I think I need some food," Tony chuckles ruefully, running a hand through his hair and throwing it into greater disarray.  "Blood sugar must have plummeted because it had to be a normal hour if you're here."
“You think?” Tony bites back before taking a step forward, hands out of his pockets as he choregraphs his movements slowly.
It looked all too similar to his face when Hulk had roared him back to life.  Frenzied and harried, like he didn’t know where he was, maybe even who he was.  But he was alive, and he wasn't sure if he regretted it or not.
The door opens, and he hears Steve call out.  When he doesn’t respond, he hears Steve’s hurried footsteps in the apartment before the come to a stop in the entryway of the room.
Peggy takes the glass with a familiar smile.  “I can’t tell you Tony,” she says before taking a sip.
“You aren’t having any issues with the cool down system?” Tony asks as he pokes Spidey in the side of the neck with a stylus.
“It’s your place cucciolio,” she says, soft as she leans close.  “Is it not my place to try and protect you, even if you are older than me?”
He moves in his seat, shifting side to side, nervous energy rattling around in him.  “Do you...do you want to grab a burger?”
She glances over her shoulder to the lean man steadily covering them with fire.  “It’s a long family secret and a longer story, but you didn't exactly paradox everything with the time travel and spilling all your secrets to the old folks.  It’s just gave the rest of us enough time to prepare.” She levels him with a determined look, “You thought our family would take the warnings and do nothing?”
Steve pauses and looks at Tony, really looks. Tries to see if there is a hint of anything in Tony's eyes. But he's just standing there, waiting.
He keeps circling through scenarios until he can find one he can live with.  One that others will live in.
[2] Variously spelled koushari and koshary - a nourishing vegetarian dish of rice, lentils, macaroni, garlic and chickpeas, brought together by a spicy tomato sauce and topped off with fried onion from Egypt
He looks like he’s aged decades in the two years since they last talked.  His hair is shorn short, trying to hide the beginnings of the gray he is sporting. Tony knows his own face doesn’t show the time.  The doctors think his aging has slowed with Extremis down to a sixteenth of the speed it should be.
He makes eye contact with Fury’s single wide eye and shrugs, “Yeah Death with a capital D, welcome to the future where Captain America is alive and Death is a person, being, thing.  Whatever. But he wants to take out a lot of people to make Death fall in love with him or something, and if it has all six of the infinity stones, long story not enough time, but we need to stop him.”
He reminds himself of Howard, sitting back and watching all his favorite people interact.  Carefully held away and boxed into his work, only coming to join the festivities once his tumbler had been emptied three times or coaxed relentlessly by one of the others.  Tonu waves away the thought. There is no time for weepiness. He’s grieved for these people already, and is careful to make sure not to slide anyone else into their carefully curated boxes in his head.
an’t tiny Steve hide a single emotion in his entire body?  He understands why Barnes followed him to the end of Siberia. “I’ll go back to the barracks.  I was just wanting to ask about the procedure for tomorrow.”
Tony leans and falls back a little and then dips until he lands at the back of his original pack he brought to Wakanda plus Wanda.  They pause as he the helmet snap back before walking with them. It’s silent for a moment before Tony says, “So I’m guessing you were talking about me before I landed.”
The destruction, knowing how it ends, watching his teammates get batted around like they are nothing, makes some long forgotten anger bubble in Tony’s gut.
She thrives, even when her gaze goes distant for hours at a time. She offers to bring him in. That his face and his planning capabilities would be useful, good even, with this.
Howard rolls his eyes, “You’re four and we can already see you take to everything like a fish to water.  Don’t limit yourself kid.”
,” Ana would say.  Hands out at the end of the day, and Tony would run until he crashed into her knees.  She would kiss his forehead as he clutched onto her, and Jarvis would be standing back, the smile he always wore when Aunt Peggy kissed Uncle Daniel on his lips.
"You," Pepper pauses for a moment.  And Tony closes his eyes against what he knows she is going to say next.
Tony laughs long and hard this time before turning around.  “Now I know you’re bullshitting with me.”  He’s grinning, and Steve hates it because Tony’s so confident in this truth, that he doesn’t even see how he could be wrong.
Tony is startled at the flash of happiness that burns through him at the offer.  “I would like that.  I have few friends these days.”
He glances at them for a second, but Thanos throws him across the battlefield. The being makes a fist and Steve waits for it. Waits for the power stone to pick him up like a rag doll, but nothing happens. Thanos roars and Strange is already moving, stones disintegrating before him.
They had stood there in that silence, quiet and echoing between them.  The other guy had been right there in the back of his mind, unlike in the recent months.  Fighting for his attention.  He screams wordless things, emotions behind them almost enough to bowl Bruce down.  Bruce buckles under the weight of it for a moment, under the onslaught of devastating echo of loss that reverberates inside his head for a few moments.  There are memories that aren't his in the forefront.  Tony with the helmet off, grinning at him in the training room, joy of a good fight coursing though him.  The sheer adrenaline pumping through his system in the desperate scramble to catch Iron Man in Manhattan.  The red lifting from his vision in the middle of Johannesburg, people rushing away and screaming - but there is red and gold - Iron Man is there. Relief.
we needed rules so we could color inside the line instead of outside of it. we needed to figure this shit out so it wouldn't be enforced on us and I tried
Steve walks out, hand on the doorknob as he closes it, and the yanking makes Tony stumble.  “Hey,” he calls, grabbing a nearby table to hold himself upright. “Come back real quick.”
“Without telling anyone,” Rhodey adds.  Peter is sitting on the couch in civilian clothes, eyes wide.
“I believe all your ‘children’ consider you their mother,” Vision retorts mildly.  “Dr. Banner is my father in this scenario.”
Steve hums for a moment, before quietly telling him the story about some kids who tried to pull everyone in earshot into singing "Let it Go".  Steve had had to hurriedly look up the lyrics before they set their eyes on him.
It degrades from there, Clint trying to figure out the number and the missions.  She doesn't give a firm answer to anything, but Steve catches the look Tony throws at her before he disappears to do
Where the stone had been before is a hazy red glow, and Tony looks to the ground where Wanda is steadily walking through the masses coming at her, throwing the left and right.  Her hands are red, and when he zooms in, her hands looks steady.
“He needs someone covering him.  Falcon is usually his back up, but this whole thing gives the vibe that they are just spread thin,” Rhodey notes.
Steve pulls back after they hit the wall and checks to make sure that this is okay, that this is what Tony wants. Tony chuckles before bending down and kissing him breathless again.
T’Challa is covering Tony’s font, like a final defense, Wanda hovers over his right, one hand trained on him and keeping up a forcefield and the other throwing balls of energy at anyone she can catch.  Vision is phasing in and out of the enemy and calmly pushing the rest back on his left.
That's the thing about faith, he’s learning. You carry it with you like a flickering candle, holding your breath so you don't accidentally blow it out.
Tony turns to the Datapoint and points.  Dad follows his finger the disassembled computer.  “You know I’ve been looking in how to do this for a year?”
"Is that a Black Widow joke?  Oh my god, JARVIS tell me you have that recorded," Tony cries as he looks to the ceiling.
“I spent every summer looking for you in Antarctica, and I never found you.  Do you know how much that killed me, getting the call? 300 hundred years you missed because I couldn’t find you in the ice.”  Steve runs a hand through his hair until it’s all over the place. “You lost time with everyone because I couldn’t find you.”
“About what?” Tony questions tranquilly.  “I don’t know of a single reason why I should be apologizing to you.”
Steve leaning on the island, watching for the moment to step in, a mug of something warm in his hands.  Eyes sometimes turning back to Tony.
Tony meets his father’s gaze before looking away, leaving the topic there.  “What about the arc reactor?”
“Breathe,” he murmurs, and his voice breaks, higher than it normally is.  “Breathe Tony.  You aren’t dying.”  The first sob bubbles up and breaks past his lips, but he gamely swallows the rest down.
T’Challa smiles.  “You were honest with me, and I knew it cost you much to give me that much knowledge.  I want to be honest with you.”
He puts a small device on the vest and shrinks it until it’s too small to view on the screen.  Lang tosses it to the ground, and there is small flare of fire, but it is quickly put out by the dirt.  The superhero shrinks himself and the camera loses him from there.
“Why do you take his compliment and not mine?” Tony shouts, faking outrage as he begins the trek upstairs.  The projection follows them, but is muted.  Spidey is waving fervently as he tells a story.  Vision is subconsciously leaning forwards as he listens. “Do you like him more?”
“Have you gone to see her?” Tony asks, when Steve nearly finishes the sketch.  He’s barely an arm length’s away from Steve, who noticed the closeness a while back but continued drawing.
Clint had laughed, low and bitter and Steve feels like he had the first time. Like he had cracked open Clint's chest and reached in and twisted his heart.
"Is there a question in there?" Tony asks idly. His gaze swings around the room. "I know you have one straight from Jameson's mouth, because let's be honest, that's where this is coming from. Triple J over there. I'll make this short. Yes, I am helping Spidey because he needed an upgrade if he was going to stand with me, because seriously, you can't stand with me and not look cool. It's a requirement."
James Barnes, his mind has to continually chant the name to keep those other words at bay, stands in the glass container.  The frost has been carefully wiped away from his face.  He is momentarily struck by the peace on the man’s frozen face.
Two day later, Tony goes back into the study he has spent the last month working with JARVIS to walk him through things.  He is silent as he cleans up the components he had been breaking apart, equations scribbled out again and again on paper, notes he has scattered from different projects.  It takes two hours but he organizes the place until it’s gleaming, barely anything out and a trash bag filled with everything he doesn’t understand.
They laugh. They live.  And Tony feels like he can breathe for the first time in a long time.  Like something isn't hanging over him.
Steve replies, “I do” in that calm Cap tone that always surges Tony with warmth and the knowledge they are going to make it out of this just fine.
So he sits in his corner of the Jarvis’ living room tonight while his Mom, Ana and Jarvis talk.  The glance back at him every few words until Jarvis brings out the dominoes, and it becomes a high stakes game of Muggins that turns even the mild tempered Jarvis vicious.
He's taken to painting in the early afternoons, carefully missing Tony in his flurry of SI meetings and far too few naps. The lab is quiet, and the light is good. Steve loses himself in the process until the door opens and Tony comes in and settles into work, lightly playing music or talking to FRIDAY.
Tony sighs.  “I should have known you would have noticed with your always planning Captain face, but yeah you’re right.”
He’s cut off of the blaring noise of a news alert.  Everyone looks at the screen, as a blonde news anchor says, “There has been an attack in South Sudan. The civil war has been escalating since 2013, two years after the country established independence, when the Vice President and a majority of the new government’s cabinet.”
Tony waves his hand.  “Yeah go do what you need to.  I’ll be here.  Pretending to be a starch instead of a Stark.”
“Sounds like this will get you that money to fund your drinking problem you keep threatening him with,” Rhodey replies.
waves, one after another.  Tony still feels like a mess of emotions on a good day, so he wonders sometimes what Steve feels back, the few times he’s asked, hesitantly, “Can I?” before putting a hand on his chest.
"I can't promise you anything you won't believe Peter, but I will be there.  For the next step, and the one after that, until the last ones.  I will be there for the moments in between.". Peter's eyes meet his.  "You carved yourself into my heart Peter.  I can't not be there, even if you wanted me gone.  I'll carry you always."
Even for him, it sounds like science fiction, but what Tony is quickly realizing is that everything he imagined before is limited when it comes to the future.
It hangs for a moment, and Tony’s eyes are dark and searching. Steve takes in a deep breath and reminds himself to be honest because Tony deserves that.
Peter relaxes at that, but Rhodey meets his eyes over Peter’s head, eyes serious.  Tony knows.  He doesn’t need the reminder.  He pulled his punches before. These guys...they didn’t.
“The Chitauri?” Natasha finishes as she steps closer into her partner’s space.  Their shoulders are basically touching. “Yeah, they look pretty familiar.” Natasha tilts her neck, a casual stretch that leans her closer to Clint, and she murmurs something in his ear before tilting the other way.  Wanda watches them with a curiosity and a sheen of red still in her eyes, and Vision watches her.
He smiles, soft and slow. “I wouldn’t have likened you two to have come from a similar stock. But I can see it.”
She looks up in the mirror, face young and eyes heavily lined.  “Oh Tony,” she whispers. “I wondered when it would be my turn.”
He leaves them, leaves the embrace and the hurried whispers, because they deserve that moment. It’s not his to share in.
Rhodey calls it his lack of socialization as a child with other children.  Tony calls it ‘hazards of being his friend’. Steve had called it ‘leaning on each other’.  He still doesn’t know who is really right.
He gets thrown under the weight, and Tony has to adjust, FRIDAY hitting the boosters as he tries to untangle his body from the loose armor that is trying to catch on him.  Fry takes control of the suit after he fails for a moment, and then another, and an alarm screams that another large object is hurtling towards him. She thins out the armor enough Tony can almost feel the sun on his skin as he pulls his arms out and then kicks off the whale head, flipping while the nanobots rush out from the arc reactor, rushing to cover him again, layering the suit thicker before rebuilding the boosters and hurtling him backwards.
They have entire timelines mapped out.  The stones are labels in his mother’s handwriting with photographs of the cube, readings and other things.  He follows the papertrail they have penned up, mapping out the beginnings of a plan to do something.
Out of the dust, Thanos stands.  He is bleeding sluggishly from his temple before the red spiderwebs begin to try and heal him again.  Tony feels winded, and there are power warning in the corner of his screen.
And Tony had.  There had been lobbyists to find, influence and fund.  Senators to get on his side to make changes that didn’t begin at
He has some ideas in the back of his mind about it.  What he wants to focus on. “It’s just something to work through my grief,” he admits. “It’s not that great.”
Bruce finds the nearest camera and tips his head in greeting.  “The pleasure is all mine,” he responds.
Maybe there is a way he can simplify it down to a way where it can slip under the clothes for users. Looking like an accessory instead of a crucial piece to the lives of some people.
"No General. I did not tell Captain America about your under the sea prison. How would that conversation even go? You had me monitored while I was there, after I left, and I wouldn't be surprised if you had all of the NSA manpower pointed at anything with my name on it."
But that’s all Steve hadn’t seen in that moment in Manhattan.  All he caught sight of was the similarities to Howard. Maybe it was a little smoother around the edges, but all Howard Stark.
Tony straightens. "Doctor Banner is working on some research at this moment, and he cannot be reached for comment."
It leaves an empty feeling in his gut, before Tony steels himself.  He can figure this out. He’s been figuring things out for a long time now.  He can solve this problem too.
Tony drags out the next roll of his eyes, but he can’t help the fond smile from spreading on his face.  “Unfortunately, not everyone is as idealistic as you Steve. And two generations would not change that.”
It doesn’t come because he flies out an open back half.  Tony comes to a halt and check the ground, not seeing anyone looking in his direction.
“It’s a long story,” Steve replies.  Tony can feel his hand going in circles on his back, quietly trying to sooth him.
I won’t come looking for the Cap squad.  But if we meet again, I can’t help you Nat.  You need to make sure they know that.  I can’t help
Tony stands there, in the midst of his crushed hopes, and takes a few steadying deep breaths before straightening his shoulders and heading back upstairs.
Tony had had to laugh at that.  A sudden and sharp laughter that rang hollowly between them.  “Be an optimist Lightening Boy,” he had said to Thor’s solemn face.  “Maybe only a quarter really.”
Her grin is bright and eager, “You get that from both of us.  You never saw that in your father, because you are too similar I think, but he wanted to save as many people as he could.”
This Peggy is sharp, like the woman Steve sketches from time to time with fondness and ease.  She is jagged around the edge, still working on being tempered by her recent tragedies and anger with how the world works outside the war for her.  But in this moment, she’s relaxed, shoes off and jacket across a chair as she leans back and reads.
Tony shrugs, eyes listing down. “We don’t kiss usually,” he states. “We actually kind of avoid doing that.”
If Tony focuses, he can hear what sounds like himself singing, but in a choir of voices that all sound similar to him.  He has to close his eyes and be still. But he can hear it. It feels like something he has remembered and forgotten a few times.  He takes in a breath and thinks on that and realizes, it’s more than a few.
“My prime directive is to provide any insight about your health, mental or physical when necessary,” she returns promptly.
I lied.  It took 2 weeks.  But hey, some kind of plot is beginning to appear!! So this isn't 100% a self indulgent character study of Tony and his relationships with other people.  (That's another lie.  We all know it's an incoherent study of Tony Stark mascaraing as something with plot and purpose.)
"Love you," Tony whispers. It's been seven months since the hospital room, but hearing the words still make Steve's heart pound.
Rhodey chimes in, “Why are you saying that?  Where are you?” There is some grunting on his line for a second, and across the bottom of the screen, a miniature of War Machine’s armor blinks red sharply, then yellow and then eases into a soft green.
Howard squeezes him again before stepping back.  His eyes are dark and serious, and this is the man Vanko had spoken about.  The ruthless businessman the generals had always spoken fondly about. “I’ll take care of it.”
When he catches her eye, he knows she knows anyway, like Natasha probably does. He just shrugs. "Keeps me busy," he replies, soft.
Tony nearly laughs, “Of course Agent Agent survived.  I’ve got a damn time traveling gem in my head. What else would make sense?”  But instead of laughing, he opens the briefcase and sees the five and a half other stones nestled in it.
Tony leaves, grin too bright, looking like he does when Steve catches him in the news.  A reporter badgering him with questions about the Avengers and the clean ups after fights, SI's stock’s latest tumble, or about the latest lady in his life.  The one he uses when he’s about to lie or fake his way through something.
Rhodey is calm, a lighthouse in a churning storm. Always has been and always will be. "Who knew what?"
Bruce still knows he is the intruder in this relationship.  He is the one who has settled into Tony's lab, Tony's projects, Tony's home.  He knows with every searching look from Rhodey, the casual way Tony doesn't make any assumptions on his opinion without asking, careful to have an answer before continuing.  He knows with the way Spiderman dances around the two of them, ready to jump in if needed, even as he peruses the nanobots projects.  He knows in the way Vision carefully explains things that has happened in the last two and half years, filling in the gaps and silences that linger in the Tower.
But then they settle and become a low level hum in the back of his head as he hears his own voice whisper in the back of his head,
T’Challa is studying him, and the urge to stand has Tony out of his seat in a moment.  “I don’t apologize for taking them in and helping with the escape,” the king says.
He heads back to the table and picks up a StarkTablet.  Bruce follows as he continues to the screen, changing the display until it show a directory of files for his different files.
“Who do you think will be the last one standing out of us?” Steve asks, eyes dark with grief, still.
His father runs his hands over the pages before spinning it around.  “What do you think?” Tony glances at it for a moment, making sure it looks familiar.  “It looks like you are on the right path.”
They had been the person they tried to stick spaghetti against when talking about idea.  They had had so many discussions on theoretical concepts like time travel, alternate seminarians.  The never ending rants about magic.  There had been discussion about the future they wanted to craft.  The lives they wanted to live.  Secrets, dreams, wishes poured out from their hearts.
He opens his eyes, colors brighter and glowing he can tell.  The entire field has stopped moving, and Thanos is snapping his fingers.  The gems embedded in his hand dim with every failed snap.
It’s like a sigh of relief, a burden off his shoulders to admit it, before the look in Tony’s eyes comes rushing back as he pounded the shield into his chest. The fading of his trust, his faith, anything he had held for Steve.
“He smiled more when you came into the home,” JARVIS returns.  “He began to balance his life and spent less time training and chasing after the next ‘bad guy’ as he likes to say.”
Tony’s on edge, half out of his mind with pain, drifting as conversations go on around him.  He’s barely aware of he’s on the plane because he’s still reeling. Extremis is gone. There are Skrulls walking around in the skins of his friends.  Jessica Drew isn’t Jessica.
He puts the board aside and straightens, spine cracking as he over compensates for his hunched posture for too long.  He discards his goggles, and turns off the light he had on before tracking Bruce’s movements.
The sound of a gunshot has Cap ducking behind the wall of the abandoned stand.  He’s crouched near the group on the group.  Some twitch, but no one moves.  There are five more rapid fire shots, and Cap works on locating the sniper in the metal gleaming from the bright wind chime like items hanging from the roof.
Rhodey turns.  “You keep talking, and I’ll stop this.”  He pulls back his hands from Tony’s feet, and Tony whines, thrusting his sock clad foot in Rhodey’s face.  Rhodey just stares him down, and Tony can feel himself slumping on the couch.
Tony then dives into 3D printing plans, begins to break down holograms, trying to figure out how each layer is build on the next until he gives up, and tries to come at it from another angle.  Starts with a vase and tries to build it up into a viable 3D form.
Steve turns his head and when they meet his, Tony's breath catches for a moment.  He looks so tired and grateful, blue eyes dark with so many things.
Some intern said the hulk was a mindless idiot and he wouldn't listen to anyone say anything otherwise
There is a purple giant standing back, watching as one by one his armored soldier things throw themselves against the forcefield and get flung backwards.  “Is that?” Clint murmurs, hands absently twitching before he grabs onto both of his arms and clings tight enough the skin dimples under his grip.
"Yes, I brought in a few extra guns to a fight. At the time, only 2 participants had not signed the accords, Black Panther and Spiderman. His Majesty T'Challa of Wakanda shipped a signed copy to the UN after the Germany incident, so we have Black Panther covered now. We are working with Spiderman on his concerns around giving his information in a manner that can be used against him in the future. This is one of the current topics the UN is looking into with the current revisions of the Sokovia Accords." His smile never wavers.
He holds his arms open, carefully choreographing his movement for a hug.  Tony steps into it, and he can feel Steve’s pull on his sweater, the tight grip.  He still smells like paint, like he did in the old days. Tony takes in a deep breath, nose buried in Steve’s neck and quiets his thoughts for a moment.  Doesn’t add weight to the moment, just exists in it.
Tony finds himself telling T’Challa stories of Rhodey, walking and retiring from the military.  Vision who has decided to try and cook through the entirety of the Joy of Cooking to some’s horror and other’s delight.  Bruce and their quiet work on nanobots, and Spidey who they both agree with either be mortal enemies or best friends with Shuri and they must never meet.
His eyes go back to the screen, ignoring the cozy scene of the rest of the team crowded around the tablet with JARVIS narrating the various footage or information in front of them.
Tony waves the data away.  “Go through former data and video, take into account body language and average times for moods to disapparate.  Make sure to check for the alcohol variable.  You may need different data sets.  This is all normal.”
before he tries and begins to fight the stone, turning incrementally. Thanos’ eyes widen for a moment before they sharpen.  He tightens his fist, and Tony’s scream nearly covers the rolling thunder. “You’re going to die,” Thanos assures him. “And it will be painful.”
He knows that look now.  Tony saw it enough time on faces that weren’t just his father’s.  Tiberius Stone.  Justin Hammer.  Obie.  It’s like Obie always said. He has the stamina of an Olympic swimmer when it came to software and hardware.  Howard could swim decently enough, but it was a struggle some days.
Tony had grown up in a family who held secrets close to their chests.  He still looks back and wonders if they hadn't been spies, former soldiers, and wartime inventors, maybe they would have taught him to be honest.
They spend many quiet moment together after that initial week in the apartment.  Tony reading quietly in between meetings with a therapist. Steve by his side every moment.  Carefully watching him, not letting him out of his sight.
He tosses the tablet on the couch. Rhodey is leaning forward, empty bottle absently moving. His eyes are dark, gaze heavy. "What?" Tony says, a sharp edge in his tone. He swallows back anything else, because Rhodey doesn't deserve this. He won't hurt him any more than he already has.
He lingers at the table before she urges him to “finish so I can see what you’re doing”.  Tony trots out, stolen towel under his arm as well.  He checks to make sure the towel isn’t one of Ana’s embroidered ones before placing down the glass and towel on the ground.  He grabs the tongs, using them to grab the board one handed while he uses his free hand to rinse the board off onto the towel.  The goop sloshes off from the board, which is clear of copper and now the sickly green color of his snot when he is ill, except for the complicated design on the front.
Steve's eyes are heavy with confusion, and Tony hates talking about it so he just places a hand on his chest, over the arc reactor.
But when the kid bounces into the compound and sees Tony leaning casually in the kitchen, drinking some coffee, he goes, "
"I will let you know if Colonel Rhodes needs your help boss," FRIDAY responds, patience clear in her tone. "I have also begun the process of opening the Tower apartments back up to the usual personnel."
“No,” Steve smiles, gently.  “You can come this way.” He leads Tony down a hallway, and the lights come on every three steps ahead of Steve as he heads.  Effortless elegance in how the systems anticipate his every move. Tony wants to know how it knows. Is it a house AI or something new?  Have they discovered a new level of application for neural networks for house so they are living breathing things.
He uses the same device as Lang to neutralize the vest and handcuff the would be bomber to a railing.  Wilson takes to the sky, jabbering to the communicator, and poking the screen covering his forearm.
He stays awake longer than he wants, but the blankness in his mind keeps the panic at bay until he falls back under.
"Oh thank god boss. The autopilot is offline, and I was about to resort to calling Miss Potts and having her yell at you into moving."
"And I've loved them when they were gone too.  I've learned how to love in softer ways, less burning the world down, you know?"
(He forgets for a split second every morning, while his brain moves from sleep to online.  Sometimes, he thinks,
They stay in that moment for a while, just staring.  “Steve?” he finally asks again. This time he reaches out, because he has to.  Can’t just
When they enter the simulation room, the rest of the team is playing with the goodies Tony has been working on. JARVIS must have shown them the armory next door.
Honing back in on Tony, Steve catches the waves of regret that pass over his face before settling.  It’s part of the new Tony, the quick release of negative emotion.  It still never seems to throw Steve off.  He keeps waiting for the second wave to sneak up on them both and bite him
"No," Tony responds, "But I wanted to know what to expect when it did happen. I wanted to make sure I was prepared for the challenge."
Steve tilts his head and looks askew to him.  “Not exactly what you’re talking about,” Tony adds.  “But when people don’t see you or know you.  It’s hard.”
He leaves it out there, waiting for Tony to scoff or say something light hearted and move past the moment and never acknowledge it again. Steve carefully doesn’t look to the door, doesn’t look for an exit. Plants his feet and stays.
Steve starts laughing as he places a bookmark in his book before placing it on the bedside table. It's something that Tony loves, that he leaves pieces of himself around, trying to press the permanence of this relationship into Tony's life, like he isn't pressed into the very essence of his soul.
, Tony mouths.  He thinks of all the unsaid things, all the tangled memories and dreams.  He doesn’t know what is real any more.  What is him versus the stone.
Even though there is a football field of distance between them, Tony can hear it clearly, like the words are being spoken right in his ear.  A shiver takes over his body, and Tony knows that isn’t him. It’s the stone.
“Don’t ask if I’m okay. I think we both know the answer to that one.” And Tony kind of grins, just a little hard around the edges, face not so friendly and expression not as welcoming. But Steve doesn’t leave, just stands there. Holding the line.
That doesn't mean he isn't picking up on things as he observes the group, as he watches Tony.  He's got the beginning of a hypothesis, the bare bones of an idea, but he's waiting, before he explains it to anyone.  Wants more facts.  Wants more proof.  Wants to be wrong.
Tony’s throat doesn’t catch, but he has to swallow down a few memories, some other choice words, along with one question.  Instead he just says, as fiercely as he can, “Assemble.”
“Mom?” He breathes, taking a single step forward and then another until he was right in the doorway of her room.
But he doesn’t give in, just wraps the other hand into Steve’s hair, and yanks, pulling at the spikes and trying to pull them closer, intertwine them in ways they in the only ways he knows how. Steve’s other hand drifts further down, down the curve of Tony’s spine, fingers trailing until they curve around his ass, gripping on tight enough that Tony goes a little breathless for a just a moment.
Tony clears his throat and goes back at the gauntlet.  It seems small in his hands.  Too small.  “FRIDAY, reach out to the UN panel to see if they want us engaged.”
He looks back at Clint, who is looking at Natasha with a face of someone on the edge of something and grins quietly down to Tony’s face.
It’s like there is a white noise in his ears that keeps his mind blank, because Tony knew this was coming.  Had an inkling, just a feeling. Has had it for months. He just pushed it back, thinking if he ignores it, it isn’t happening.  It’s worked for him so far.
He meets Steve’s smile when he spots Tony coming back in with one of his own.  Slips into his role as standing by Steve and knows that nothing will ever be the same.
Tony can't wait as Rhodey contemplates him and the question. He grabs the washcloth and begins scrubbing down the counter. There is a knick in the quartz from when Natasha slammed a knife to keep Bruce from stealing vegetables as she made salsa, eyes smiling enough to match Bruce's actual one on his face. He turns and flips the dish washer on, running his fingers across the ding in the door from when Thor bumped into it.
There is something about this this that makes something deep in him scream, and another piece of him is calmer in the knowledge that is where his path was always going.  That all of this, his entire life was an eventuality.
Tony is gasping for air, breathless as he says Steve’s name like it's the last thing he will ever say. Tony loses all speech the second Steve pulls back, fingers readying Tony with only spit and not enough time, but he wants this to hurt, wants this physical reminder that Steve is here, Tony writhing under him.
T’Challa is at his side for most of it, an advocate for all the options, a steady voice when his falters - the ally he gratefully welcomes.
He makes a grab for the pillow, and Tony moves it before his fingers can touch.  Rhodey makes another grab, and they end up wrestling over a decorative pillow with a whale on it for a good five minutes.  Vision strolls by as they fight, throwing different nicknames at each other, and murmurs something to FRIDAY.
Tony turns back. "Nah. Aunt Peg would have shot him in the family jewels and then I would never have been here," Tony says with a smile makes up for what it lacks in authenticity with wattage. "He met Mom while she worked in the early days of SHIELD. Fell in love, had me, died in a crash crash."
more than the bleeding. “Snipers eyes, Red. I see better than you do."  He coughed, and there was too much blood.  "You’re just going to have to trust me on this one.”)
Tony stumbles upstairs, one day after the first Avengers team up, but before Hydra was everywhere, and Steve had been glued to the TV, watching some entertainment news on Neal Patrick Harris and his family.  Tony got some food and a drink before he realized Steve hadn’t moved the entire time he’s been banging around in the kitchen.
"She's already enlisted you hasn't she?" Tony asks after a moment of silence.  "Fuck, I give up.  All my kids like you more than me."  He takes a sip of his smoothie.
A lightning bolt comes from the sky and Thor directs it to Thanos who has the gauntlet outstretched, and the blue fades to nothing against him.  Thor throws another, and then another, and yet another, all the while, Thanos calmly neutralizes each one.
Then Tony will throw out a joke and Steve will smile and forget the face, forget the questions.  Just be happy to exist in the space with Tony.
“Just a small skirmish downtown with the wrecking crew.  You’d think we could get them to just stop.”
Tony's mouth opens, closes, and then opens again. "How…" He can't get any more past the lump in his throat.
He unscrews the lid and downs the whole thing before coming up for air. Vision is still staring at him when he looks back. "You're a reminder," Tony admits. He spreads his arms, indicating to the room at large. "Rhodey. Rhodey's been around for ages. And yes, the legs, those sting. But you're a reminder of everything."
I crammed so much crap in into this chapter to just get it done and over with.  Hopefully the next chapter won't take 3 months.   Also this is now a series with a side stories thing called //commented out.  I have a few things I want to cram in there eventually that i missed in this chapter in my rush to get it done.
“Do you think about burning it all down sometimes?” Tony asks, drink in hand staring out at the skyline. Natasha’s barely in the room, but she knows it’s meant for her.
“We’ve made contact with an actual alien?” Peggy’s voice rings out around the room.  Tony blinks, and looks down in horror to make sure he is clothed, because Peggy Carter seeing him naked is one of his worst, most pervasive nightmares.
Bruce nodded absently, turning the idea over in head own brain slowly, mulling on the idea too.  "You were too," Vision added.
“Of course you are,” Steve says, looking at the silver fingers around his wrist, and the sheen of the metal.  Almost a year old, and it looked brand new.
Rhodey picks up where he left off, and when Tony glances over at him a few minutes later, there is still a big grin on his face.  “You suck,” Tony pouts.
He sits for scans.  He answers questions and tests with machine’s scanning his brain.  His answers are stuttering, and he has to reach for some when he knows they used to be easy before.  Steve holds his hand every single time, and Tony’s knuckles are white as he grips it. His mind is racing with different scenarios, each one worst than the next.
Reaching out, he takes the handy water bottle in hand and takes a sip before continuing. "At this time, I have had no contact with any Avenger that is not Colonel Rhodes or the being named Vision. Also lay off Spidey. He's a decent guy who just wants to help."
Steve never explains what he draws. Never really talked about it with Tony. He’s seen the canvases in the shared space, but they...they have never discussed it. Tony’s looked at him, curious, but Steve always feels something in his throat seize when he tries to put words to what he is doing.
He takes shallow breaths as the suit adjusts piece by piece until everything is locked in place.  Tony grabs the case and heads out the open window before anyone, including himself, can stop him.
He looks down at his hands. "I'm sorry," he says to them. "For not saying anything, Siberia, all of it."
"Wait, a crocodile?" Tony repeats, and he watches as Steve's brow furrows before looking at the kid, with his wide arms and explaining how he stumbled across this doctor turned human sort of crocodile in the sewers.
He sighs.  “That is on me.  It will always be on me.  I just wanted to make sure no one else had to live with that.”
Steve smiles, but it looks like it takes too much effort.  Like he is straining something. “It’s been a hard few years.”
Natasha is leaning heavily on Cap's chair, watching him. Sometimes he feels like she can split him open like a watermelon and can count all his thoughts and secrets like they are seeds in his pulpy flesh. He waves at the ceiling when it gets too much.
“You don’t get it,” Tony counters, furious, because this is what could screw up everything.  “You will screw this up. You need to step back and leave this alone. I’m doing what is needed here.  This is inevitable.”
It actually looks like one of his boots but if the metal was skintight.  It’s even painted red and gold.  Tony’s lips quirk.  He know Peter catches it.
One year later, they are both back there, and Tony is the one tracing the names on two separate, but touching, tombstones.)
Tony whose eyes are heavily lidded but open. A smile softly blossoms before he takes Steve’s hand in his and Steve helplessly smiles back.
Maria beams.  “Exactly.” Then she leans closer, and he can see the lines around the edges of her eyes.  “Now, I’ve heard you needed some help gathering some gems. I’m quite in the need of some adventure darling.”  There is something edged in her smile that he has never seen before in her, but it’s something he’s seen in the mirror.
Tony had looked at him, uncertain and that had made Steve even more worried.  “I honestly don’t know.”)
Tony races through what is going on here.  He had extended Peter an offer to work at SI on a permanent basis last week after he finished graduating next week.  He, Peter and Pepper had had long discussions on this topic before, about the careful balance between secret identity and the closer you were seen to Tony Stark, Ironman and CEO.  So it wasn’t a surprise or anything.  But there was something in the lines of Peter’s face that made him look… “Did you go to Gwen’s grave today?”
Tony carefully looks to his right and sees the gap there, what is missing, and repeats, “I can still feel it.”
Instead, he keeps to the shadows more, no suits out and about.  He plays the other side of this game, like this, with the comms and support and leaving out new types of gear in the locker room that "isn't really a locker room come on Tony".  He does the clean up stuff, the philanthropy thing.
Tony is sitting in the open area in the Tower, in diffidence to Rhodey and his request that he keep Tony in his eye line since Tony (
“A shield of armor around the world,” he huffs.  Sharon clocks it, but doesn’t look away as she takes out another enemy.  She is steady, but the grim set of her thinned lips give her away, like Peggy’s had always given away her feelings.
“Judging my alcohol choices, are we Captain?” Tony queries, taking Bucky’s seat beside him on the couch.
Then he reads The Time Machine and is discussing it one evening as Jarvis completes dinner and Ana supervises when Maria comes in.  Her face is devoid of make up, hair pulled back in a braid, and she looks tired. “Mama,” he says, and she smiles softly, wearily before sitting at the table with them.
Something seizes in Tony.  Something old breaks again, differently this time, and Tony knows their days are limited now.  That in two decades, both will be dead at Bucky Barnes’ hands. For the first time, he pauses, opens his mouth, and then stops again.  Because he wants to tell his father something, say,
Across the room there is a progression of sketches of younger versions of Natalia being trained by the Asset trail into a painting of Black Widow and Winter Soldier and  and on different sides, bullets hanging midair, before ending in a statue of them fighting side by side - Nat and Barnes.
There is a chair with an open sketchpad on it.  Tony glimpses the familiar A symbol before he turns back to the room.  There is a steel table that he wanders towards, putting the briefcase down.  He looks back up to see the team gathered in the room still a good distance away.  T’Challa stands a few feet away, Steve at his side.
There is dead silence in the room, and Fury’s mouth is hanging open.  Peggy’s lips are thinned and Coulson, well Coulson looks like he is about to kneel over of a heart attack a few decades too early.
Howard had whispered things to her, and Tony still, even with the stone, doesn’t know what he said, but it was probably something said in the same tone as Sharon speaks to him now.  She tries to not sob his name as they both shake “Hey kid,” he says, and if feels like it has been carved out of him, keeping his voice this steady even as he feels like he has nothing left to give in him.  He’s running on fumes. “I’m still here kid. I’m not leaving you alone. Not yet.”
Tony still holds his breath when Cap sees the next group coming for him and looks around for a way out.  He sees the wall and starts running towards it, yelling something only the people on the other end of the communicators can hear.  He jumps, uses the wall as point to push off of, and lands behind the group, taking them out as he can.  He grabs a metal sign from a nearby abandoned food stand and tosses it. Cap takes down three more guys with that move.  He punches the fourth guy, and the group is down.  He straightens, saying something in the communicator again.
(He wraps all his feelings up and puts them aside.  This isn’t his moment. Isn’t his place or turn, or whatever.  He doesn’t matter here. Not right now.
They circle, waving at him as he slowly descends.  It takes a moment, but he sees all the former weaknesses they’ve worked out over the years in the gym and through simulations.  He meets their eyes and sees the sincere belief they are who they are. That he’s there to help them.
Tony juts his chin out, asking her what he has everyone else, and in the back of his head he hears a quiet,
Another yell is in the air, and Thor somehow summons lightning inside the building to take down one of the water wielding robots and an electrical flavored one. Both burst.
Jarvis looks back, and Tony can see a glimpse of the older Jarvis in his smile, the one who survived Howard and Maria and even Ana. "We're more than that Master Anthony."
Some days, Tony thinks of the sitting room, Ana and Jarvis and Maria chattering and Howard watching them all at once behind his glasses.  He sees similarities in how the Avengers curl together in how Peggy wound around Maria and Ana, giggling like they were schoolgirls and not hardened spies.  Soft, fond looks between some of them as they watch the others like Ana and Jarvis. Mild exasperation in Daniel’s eyes.
Bruce makes a disapproving noise in his throat.  “I want a lot of things.  But right now, I want you to let me share the burden.  I’m here Tony.”
He's about to duck out, back to the new schematics he's looking at for SI.  A new chip because Pepper had been complaining about negotiations with other companies and supply chain dynamics.  He had filed it away because she had been so frustrated in those weeks leading up to their break up, and now working on it stings faintly, but it's still something to solve.  Something he
Tony’s grin is slow and soft, but it’s there. And Steve can’t help but dart in and kiss him, kiss that smile larger, until Tony is laughing into his mouth as Steve wraps his arms around him, hosting him up.
He turns, and catches Sharon’s eyes full of things left unsaid.  Of Rhodey beyond her, Peter, and everyone. He takes a single step, and then another before she rushes him, pulling him close.  “Tony,” she whispers, and he remembers his father leaning over his mother once, as she was bleeding out on a couch and Peggy tied to piece her back together.
He grips his water bottle until it creaks and begins to walk to the door.  “They miss you,” he hears offered behind him.  “All of them except Lang.  They tell stories about the compound from time to time.”  There is a pause.  “James is apologetic.  He knows what he did and wants to take responsibility.”
Steve is across the battlefield, faintly blue but dissolving quickly.  He stumbles as the gem’s influence disappears, and Barnes keeps him upright, watching his fried carefully.  Tony looks down and sees the green glow begin color his skin again, backs away quickly from Sharon, trying to keep her away from it.
Tony suspects it wasn’t exact science.  It was someone playing God with two angry kids, and there is enough evidence to support the fact that they survived is a miracle that 83 others didn’t get.  It’s isn’t really science. It’s the same sort of science that brought Frankenstein’s monster to life. It’s chance. An actual miracle.
Tony whimpers, curling into himself a little, counting the breaths he takes in between clenched teeth before unfolding and catching Bruce’s worried gaze.  “I’m glad it’s you looking into this,” Tony utters, too tired to be anything but honest.  “I tried and I tried, and I can’t find anything to make this work.”
“I heard a rumor there was some interesting work with the interns and the StarkTablet.”  Tony smiles at the sea of curious faces. “Also I should probably be here to encourage the masses, make them smarter by just existing near them.  Give them a story for when the call home and talk to mom and dad.”
Instead, Tony’s silent as he stares out the window as they sit on a balcony in the hospital’s rooftop garden before saying, “Sure.”)
He sits up, finally, and there is Peggy’s smile softly beaming down on him.  He reaches up to touch it, and his fingers slide through the image.
He stays there standing for a long moment before sitting down and flipping through his sketchbook, past pictures of Tony bent over the suit, studies of his oil covered hands, Tony’s feet against the table as he dictates corrections to an algorithm to JARVIS, and settles on a new page.  Steve catches Tony looking his way again, careful consideration of how Steve has settled in, the way his legs are crossed, and if he’s comfortable before smiling and turning back.
"You do people?" She asks, curious. Steve goes to the stack of canvases in the corner, and presents her with one he had done for one of the numerous parties they had held in the Tower. Her and Natasha chatting with some of the others, her arm is linked with a suit clad elbow, Tony, he knows. They both know. But he's not in frame. Not painted.
“Not really, “ Tony admits.  “Your arch nemesis has the president's ear and has played his cards right that the UN adores him for catering to their whims.  He had had his claws into the Accords from the beginning, and with it gaining power along side him, I thought that I had enough time to expose his doucheyer sides and get him removed and our own guy leading the charge.”  He pauses before pushing off the wall.  “I thought I had more time.”
"Tony? Dear what is wrong?" She crosses the room in a heartbeat and folds herself beside him against the window seat. Shadows play across her face, making her cheeks look gaunt and older than she is in this moment.
There is something in T’Challa’s face that spasms as he crosses to Tony’s position in long strides.  “You inspire a different feeling in me, Tony,” he says sincerely.
Tony tilts his head and smiles at Steve, even though it feels like he’s empty inside.  Nothing else left to give. “I just thought you should know. I thought you should know it’s not something you should worry about.  I’m not going to cling to you because you are the only thing I have left in the world that I know, because I realize I don’t really know you anymore, and it’s not really good for either of us that I stay here.”
Tony plays it up, slumps and calls out, "But I thought you loved being flown around!" even though they both know she had hated it.  He whirls to Steve and says, "You like it when you fly with me, right Steve?"
Steve has never been more sure of anything in his life. The knowledge that he loves Tony is something so deeply ingrained in his being that it feels like it’s a part of his bones, his very marrow. With every beat of his heart, he hears it sing
Tony has also mastered the skill of ignoring Steve in the long months after Germany and Siberia.  T’Challa’s wandered away a while back.  Steve is leaning against a wall, using it to support him, used to watching Tony work.  Tony flicks his eyes to him, calculating the distance before going back to the tablet.  It’s far enough.
The horror, as it dawns on Thanos in the weird slow motion world they are in, is worth it as he snaps his fingers.
"Always boss," her tone is warm and sincere, but Tony want to believe but can't because JARVIS used to say that, and he's gone now. "What about the shield?"
When they all used to hang out in the manor, laughing at each other.  Movie nights and casual gatherings before it all started to go sideways.  The old days filled with scenes of Jan and Hank kissing, always in easy reach of the other.  Wanda’s bright smile and hand in Vision’s. Thor’s laughing face, two hands around a bowl of popcorn.  Steve lobbying for a black and white movie, carefully trying to hide his grin as he reaches for -
Tony opens his mouth to say something and suddenly there is light in his eyes and he blinks and then,
"That looks like too many nights I've seen recently," she comments finally. Steve cleans the brush he was using to depict the lit up skyline through those floor to ceiling windows instead of doing something dumb, like trying to hide the picture.
Steve then throws his eyes to Natasha who is watching all of them, up above on the catwalk. Her smile is small and soft, like the few times Steve had caught her unaware of him watching her back in DC. Right after the snap.
But the voices screaming in the back of his mind reaches a fever pitch as she turns to Tony, who looks up from his place on his knees.  “I’ve reaped Gods less interesting than you Tony,” Death laughs, dusting itself off and straightening. “I’ve been waiting for this moment with baited breath.”  It’s eyes feel like they are peering deep into him, counting and weighing his every sin and saving grace. Like he’s being counted for the price he will give before the slaughter.
(Steve gets cagey sometimes when Tony asks him about friends.  Tony doesn’t push it. Doesn’t push much. Is too scared if he pushes too hard he’ll lose this too.
Jarvis used to know the answer to how to clean out stains when Tony made them. He would carefully explain every step as Toby watched as oil, fruit juice, scotch just disappeared from shirts or surfaces. Ana would distract him after, with stories about Hungary and the letters she receives from her cousins and nieces and nephews. Tony doesn't remember any of the lessons or stories. He aches where the reactor used to be as he scrubs a little harder. Effort, he does remember, was always something Jarvis emphasized.
[1] (Greek) Psychopomp means “guide of souls”  they are beings of some sort (depends on the religion) whose responsibility is to escort newly deceased souls to the afterlife. They exist to guide and provide safety during the passage, not judge.
“Seeing as this is an unrecognized nation by the UN, I do believe this is one instance where the Avengers will be requested to not engage,” FRIDAY returns.
The Captain is moving as quickly as he can, tearing through the soldiers with little regard for their own health and safety, unlike the lectures he used to give about minimal public damage and injuries to others when they were going after targets.  After D.C. and Sokovia, they were trying to keep as low a profile as possible.  He and Widow get to Falcon about the same time, and they block their discovery from view of the camera.  Red Wing hovers nearby, vigilant about the sea of moaning or unconcious people around them.
if he’s honest.  It’s more physical than it was when Steve died, but Tony’s barely holding onto everything in his two hands right now - metaphorical or real.
“I like my head,” Tony adds, when the gazes come to him.  “If it could stay were it is, that would be nice, but I won’t hold everyone to such high expectations.”
Steve pats his armor before walking towards the showers as well, and Tony watches him go for a beat,
Thinks about his mother’s hands tight on his, the crush of hugs that were too tight and cut off his already restricted air.  Thinks about the names he has been known by his entire life. Thinks about the heavy gaze of words left unsaid. The weight on your chest when you finally let them out and are waiting for the response.
“Oh,” Tony murmurs.  The house is bright, and there is singing in the back of the room.  Italian, just like his childhood memories, and the faint music of the piano.
Jarvis had been the same, always on their other side.  A secret smile and a small sweet in his pocket. They had said spoken novels in their actions.  They didn’t need to hear him say it again.
“Okay so we’re talking miniaturized robots in your bloodstream, in your bone marrow, wherever, targeting abnormal cells,” Tony waves a carrot stick as emphasis for his point.  There is a sim running between him and Bruce in the kitchen.  They are both snacking under Vision’s watchful gaze as he works on the snack platter.
T’Challa chuckles, hopelessly fond, and Tony can’t help but like the girl, or her brother, a little more.  “Do I even want to ask what you did, or are you going to tell me?”
“What about the vibranium treatments that Wakanda is providing?” Bruce asks, eventually.  “That’s all I can see anywhere.  The technological advances they are providing.”
She is silent for long enough that Steve glances her way. "Be careful," she urges. "With both of you."
He and Bruce go up the stairs, leaning heavily on each other as they laugh over the video FRIDAY replays of Spidey saying hi to Rhodey.
Ana smiles, and it’s beautiful, despite the sallowness of her skin.  “With all those adventures you went on with young Agent Carter, yes you should have gone a long time ago. But,” she pauses.  “The good Lord allowed us all of that time.  We should be grateful we had so much.”
He catches Bruce’s, looking for some accusation, some anger, something.  He catches sight of something worse - endless grief written in every line of his feature.  “I know you were working on those Accords longer than you would admit.  Politics never move fast.”
fault or if this is Tony.  The real Tony.  The one who isn't running a show, isn't holding everything together by sheer will.  The one who doesn't have to be "on" in every moment.
"Fry shut down the simulation," Tony breathes in, and it rattles around in his chest.  He can still feel Ana’s warm on his skin and the smell of her rose petal perfume in the air, even as the simulation fades.
He turns the comms off, leaves the tracking program running and the camera's trailing the car to the airfield, but he turns, already sketching ideas in the air to FRIDAY who begins to shape them into something that looks like an in ear comms system, rattling off facts about what's on the market.
Tony’s still itching, still gearing for a fight, and his fingers jitter at his sides, just twitching up and down. “Go away Steve,” Tony says, quiet and dark.
“I am too,” Tony admits, quietly.  “And that was before the whole performance earlier today.  I know what it looks like if we lose, and we can’t. But I don’t want to lose anyone.”  He smiles, a little weakly at Peter. “I asked this of you three years ago. You didn’t ask for this fight.  You didn’t know what you were getting into. A job doesn’t cover what I’m asking you to do here, so if something happens, and you need to go.  I want you too.” He tightens his grip on Peter. “You don’t end here kid. I need you for the next one, and the one after that. You don’t die here, okay?”
Bucky had looked him in the eye, after, and said, “You need to make your peace in order to live.”  His eyes had gone darker, and his voice had become stilted, like it had been, before Tony had neutralized the threat of the Winter Soldier.  “This is going to eat you alive Steve.”
Comments, kudos and bookmarks are love.   Thanks for reading and sorry this isn't a chapter, but I think it's something pretty neat!  :)
They stay like that for a long moment, before Tony pulls back as he starts shaking as the tugging begins again, a soft reminder.
When he collects himself, Steve is ushered out of the room by a blank faced doctor who explains Tony was pulled out of the ice 6 months ago - frozen and unexpectedly breathing.  Extremis has been repairing his cellular levels over the last few months as they slowly defrosted him. He’s been the last six weeks in a coma until they had someone interface with  Extremis and program some wake up protocols.
“Do you know what was one of the first things I did when I got back?”  Steve asks. And Tony watches him, jaw firm and strong. “I went looking for you.  I fought the idea that you were dead. You had thought I was dead, and I was just lost in time.  I wasn’t dead, so you couldn’t be. I looked for five years before I had to admit you were dead.”
Because when he peeks through the doors, his mother, younger than he remembers, is sitting at the piano.  Her hair is darker than he can ever conceive it had been, except in pictures he has kept locked deep in the manor in New York.  Her face isn’t lined, and her eyes are closed, lifted to the sunlight.
, he thinks furiously as he pushes down his fears, thoughts and emotions threatening to overtake him.
It’s familiar, how he slots into Tony’s side and how the words fall from his lips, “We’ll get him back. We’ll get them all back.”
Steve glances back at the painting and sees the curve of Tony's smile. The eased lines on his forehead as he gazes out. It's the same way Tony looks at him now, has always looked at him. He shrugs at Tony. "I think I was too stuck in my own head."
Rhodey turns, sauce in hand, and spots the blue and red costume.  With a shout, he nearly drops the pot, but Vision catches it out of the air.  Spidey waves sheepishly.  Rhodey, without greeting him, starts yelling obscenities through the floor to Tony.
They almost don’t make it, and when they get back Steve can’t stand back any more.  He watches Tony across the room during the party, and he knows it makes Tony uncomfortable because Tony carefully avoids looking at him.  Steve can’t help it, keeps looking back to make sure Tony’s still there, because he almost wasn’t, and Steve can’t handle that.
She adds, just loudly enough for T’Challa, and by accident (or not) Tony, to hear, “You need to stop collecting broken men.”  She, then, smiles at Tony as she pronounces, “Not that he isn’t my favorite of them. He just needs some educating.”
Tony leans in close to Peter right before the barrier goes down.  “Remember kid,” he quickfire says. “This makes you a 100% genuine article Avenger now.”
," he cries.  "Steven, I thought we were friends!  You know I have a compulsive need to fix terrible technology."
Daniel’s fierce in his response, “You’ve done nothing Tony.”  He sits down on the edge of the coffee table and leans in, until their foreheads almost touch.  “None of this has to do with you,” he says quietly. “We’re tired and fighting against the clock.  Maria doesn’t mean to take it out on you, but she’s frightened and scared and wants to make sure you’re safe.”
They stay there for a long moment before Tony pulls back.  He feels Steve’s lips, rough and chapped, against his hairline for second before dismissing the thought.
He gets comfortable (in the routines, in looking for Steve and finding him looking at him already, in so many small things) over the months that slowly down the line, and then gets uncomfortable with that.
There is a garden with holograms, like statues but electronic.  There is one of the first group of Avengers, and he stops in front of it.
“What do you mean ‘you don’t want to know’?  You only say that sort of shit when you are hiding that you’re dying or something,” Rhodey retorts before taking to the air near him.
“You’re half Italian,” she grins, like this is a secret between them.  “It means you have love and pasta in your blood, and everyone loves pasta.”  She winks and they both laugh until there there are tears in his eyes.
"You gonna ask?" Tony asks him, once.  The chip is handed off, the treadmill pieces are being built in the lab, and now he's poking around trying to find another project.  So instead he's hijacking Steve's comms during a low level "whatever this new division of SI, er, the Avengers thing because you know,
“This is how we show we care,” Bruce returns.  “We take care of you too.  You can’t just take care of us, and not think we’re going to try to take care of you.”
Jarvis reaches for the tea kettle before she takes her head.  Instead he goes to the scotch and pours her a few fingers before handing the glass to her.  Ana pokes Tony and he turns back to her confused.
He turns back to Peter and the quickly shortening distance between them and the border and the tenseness growing under his arm.
He gets that, then tries to move into the organic and inorganic matter mix that this century has decided to embrace wholeheartedly.  It’s the mixture of chemistry and biology with a side of engineering that gets him.
They are halfway to New York when Carol says, “We’ve discovered another contingent down in Antarctica.”
He can’t get rid of the image that is in the coffin with Steve’s body, slowly sinking to the bottom of the ocean as his air runs out.  So he ends up in the living room, coffee mug in hand, watching the sun as it rises while wrapped up in blankets.
These stones, these gems, they aren’t final. They are magic and bound to rules and something. Wanda has said as much before, in the rare moments when she was willing to discuss her powers.
There is a moment where he thinks about closing his eyes, leaving now and not disrupting it.  But he thinks about his mother and her soft eyes, and the way it felt like she already knew.
Bruce had studied the magenta being whose eyes were focused on the distant horizon. "I've read your profile.  You could check it out if you wanted to."
“He’s in love with you,” Clint says, back when there are only six Avengers. No Compound, not Ultron, no Civil War. Those early days when they are just settling into something.
Wanda is curled into a chair, a cup of tea in hand. Scott is stretched out on couch near her, Sam leaning over the back of it watching her. Barnes has taken a spot against the wall, and Steve is peering at the mess behind her on her right with Clint on her left. But in the doorway stands T’Challa, who only looks at her with a heavy air.
"Did you not see that show back there? I was your dog and pony in that show. You guys need to step up your media presence. Do you need training? I know some lovely PR people who would love to get their claws into you and your organization."
He walks up to it, eager, hoping it’s functional.  Maybe he can interface with the suit through Extremis.  He hasn’t been able to use it since he woke up. The doctors think it’s because technology has evolved beyond the initial parameters of Extremis and it can’t adapt.
“He never slept much,” Rhodey admits, and that’s about all they can get out of him.  Steve doesn’t try because he knows he’s being iced out.  He saw that one coming months ago.
