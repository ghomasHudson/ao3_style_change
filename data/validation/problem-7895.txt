"I told you my name a long time ago," Tony whispered.
Tony exhaled hard and thrust up a a little into his hand, the head of his cock pushing beautifully through the circle of Steve's fingers. Tony was clearly trying to coax him into something slightly faster and tighter; he seemed to like it a little tighter than Steve did. "You've definitely got all my attention, gorgeous."
impressed that that wasn't a sex joke," Clint, who had not even been in this conversation, called from the couch.
So Steve doesn't ask.
Ghost lifts one hand from the keyboard and gestures at the computer screen, where a file-copy progress bar is displayed. "What does it look like, Captain? Information wants to be free." Over the private comms, Tony makes a noise somewhere between a laugh and a sob. "Late-stage capitalism is a blight upon humanity. And rumor has it -- accurately, I might add -- that Stark's computer systems still contain weapons designs, even though he hypocritically says he's out of the business. The public deserves to know the truth, and Stark deserves to suffer. I'll make him pay. One fewer billionaire in the world."
"Tony, are you okay?"
Steve's not even upset anymore, at the memory of his failure. He feels like he can't be upset about anything anymore. But he still thinks Tony should know. "I'm sorry about that," he says, once more, gesturing vaguely at the rest of the world. "I didn't-- I didn't believe in you." He'll do better next time. He will.
"Nothing," Steve lied.
He wipes his mouth off on the back of his hand and answers the question Steve didn't ask. "It's called Hanahaki disease," he rasps. "Ever heard of it?"
Steve's starting to feel distinctly overdressed. "One second."
Very belatedly, Steve realized what Tiberius must have meant, calling Tony the number-two richest man in America: Tony had once been number one. Steve had known Tony was rich, of course -- how could he not have known? -- but he didn't pay much attention to gossip. And it wasn't as if Tony had ever drawn attention to the fact. Not like Tiberius had. Here they were, celebrating his wealth. Steve didn't know what to say to that.
Tiberius was
"Like this?" Steve rumbles.
The interview aired at seven o'clock. He didn't bother to watch it. He already knew what it was going to be, after all He folded up pants, shirts, every spare uniform. Toothbrush. He was definitely going to need to bring that. He'd filled two suitcases already.
Tony shook his head. "Not the way I count it." His gaze went distant. "When I was seven, my father sent me to boarding school. I was soft, he said. I was sensitive. It would toughen me up. It took me years to figure out what he'd actually seen in me. What everybody saw in me. I was a kid. I didn't
What the hell. Why not?
Steve nodded -- obviously understanding what he wanted electrical access for, good -- and held up a hand in the direction of the rest of the team. "Everyone just stay put for a minute!" he called out. "Iron Man needs to check something."
"Shh," Steve breathed. "Shh, no, it's okay. I promise. Nothing to be sorry for. It's all okay." His voice cracked. "I'm just-- I'm just glad you're all right. That's what's important, okay? We'll figure everything else out later. I'm here to take you home. You're coming home with me, okay?"
He didn't finish his sentence, because he'd found Tony. Tony was still on the other side of the room, and somehow Tony was
"Ooh! Are we cheating on your boyfriend? How exciting!" Far from sounding guilty, Tiberius just sounded... curious. Intrigued. And, oddly, approving. "Honestly, Tony, I'm impressed. Didn't know you had it in you. You used to be such a goody-goody about this kind of thing."
"I am," Tony insists, and then he relents. "Okay, yeah, that spot's still not great, and the nerves there are still a little weird. But that's the worst spot. You can go at least that hard everywhere else and I'll like it. I promise."
Iron Man's indrawn breath is so loud that the filters pick it up and blur it into even more static. "Steve," Iron Man says, sounding almost anguished. "Steve, you're wonderful, and you have no idea how much I-- but the armor doesn't-- it can't all come off-- I can't--"
He waited, but Tony didn't even try to offer to take the couch again. Yeah, that was another one of those bad signs.
He's too slow.
abs."
"Nope," Steve says, confidently. "The only thing in you is, um. Me."
He doesn't feel like he thought he would, when he imagined this ordeal being over. He thought he'd feel relief, satisfaction at the world once again going the way it should, and of course the contentment he gets from taking care of Tony after a scene, even if this is nowhere near anything like sn ordinary scene. And he feels that but... muted. Blunted. A veil is drawn between the things he wants to feel, and the things he does feel.
There are EMT shears in the top drawer of the nightstand, and Tony's comfort is worth far, far more to Steve than the cost of a couple hundred feet of rope. Steve's confident with rope, but accidents do happen, and the shears are angled and blunted, to make it difficult to cut skin. He's never had to use them before. He doesn't have to go far to get them, but Tony's face falls again when Steve stops touching him, even though Steve's only a few feet away.
"Where am I?" Steve demands. "How did I get here?"
Then Iron Man sits down. Next to him. The couch doesn't creak as much as furniture usually does when it's subjected to the armor, and Steve can already tell he's ditched the gauntlets and boots, under... whatever he's wearing.
And that was the other thing about Steve: he didn't know. He had no idea that Tony was the man under the armor.
But Tony's nodding. "I'm okay," he says. "You get dressed."
was queer. Tony thought this was Steve showing him kindness, showing him acceptance, showing him that he actually wasn't homophobic, showing him that he was the sort of thoughtful straight ally who was trying hard enough that he was reading gay literature. And, sure, if Steve had been straight, that might even have been something he would have done. But he wasn't straight.
Tony's laugh was rueful, and he scraped his hand down his face. "If I'd known, though--"
"Or you could vote for people who represent your beliefs. There's still a socialist party, you know," Steve says, cheerfully. "A lot of 'em, actually. I bet you're not even registered to vote." He clicks his tongue. "People these days, honestly."
"Probably," Steve agrees.
"And I'll be here if you want me here, okay?" Steve said. "I'm not leaving. I promise."
Steve opened his eyes. "What's the problem, then?" He knew what the problem was too -- did he ever -- but Tony had said that like he also had the solution. Steve was very interested in that.
The eggs finished cooking, and Tony slid them out onto the plate, added salt and pepper, added the toast, and then, with a flourish, placed the plate on the table in front of Steve.
Oh, hell. That-- that sounded like a pretty classic trauma response. Steve had seen it in a hell of a lot of people, in his line of work. But not usually in Avengers. This was probably above his pay grade. But Tony wanted him here, Tony didn't seem to want anyone else here, and he sure as hell wasn't going to abandon him now.
He knows that even if Tony had thought of it, Tony never would have said it first. He wouldn't have presumed that Steve wanted to. This has to be Steve's choice. Steve's offer.
? You want to suck me off more than you want to--"
Steve just smiled up at him, out of words.
The news got worse.
The noise Tony made was a hideous, choking sob. "God, I wish it had been a lie. I wish he'd just kept fucking lying to me." Tony's voice was raw. "Steve, he
"Oh, probably," Tony says, airily. He lifts his head. His eyes are bright. "It's just that your birthday is so damn convenient for him, isn't it?"
Tony was smiling again, which was when Steve realized, too late, that what he'd said made it sound like he'd meant to agree to Tony's offer.
She let him go, but held him at arm's length for a few more seconds, inspecting him before letting him go.
"Of course," Steve said, and he meant it. "Anything you want. Here, here, I'm right here--"
"Oof," Tony said, softly. There was still a trace of a smile on his lips.
Eyes unfocused behind the mask, Iron Man stares off into the middle distance. He's quiet for a long time.
Anger and jealousy tangled and slid through him, and the fight was gone, and all he could see in front of him was Tony's smile, Tony's red wet mouth, Tony who
"You can't think like that." Steve's throat was tight. "There's someone out there for you, Tony. There
"Still not seeing how this is your fault," Steve says. He smiles. He can't forgive this. He doesn't know.
Yeah, no, okay, he was moving on. Thor, despite having super-strength, was also out of the running, for the simple reason that he'd found the box and said he hadn't known whose it was. If it had been his box, he would have just taken it and not said a word to the rest of them, end of story. Thor had always at least liked him, ever since the early days, so maybe Tony could understand him having a crush -- but, logically speaking, Thor had already excluded himself.
"Wait."
He hadn't talked to Tony after reading his mission report about the Sentient Armor. Tony hadn't seemed to want to talk about it, and Steve hadn't had any idea what to say. It was starting to look like he should have said something anyway. God, it was like the goddamn Carnelian ambassador all over again.
It's more than a little undignified when he tries to get the cup on, but the upshot is that he's not hard by the end of it. He buttons his pants, buckles his belt, pulls an undershirt on, lets the mail shirt settle on his shoulders. It's when he's sitting down to struggle with his boots that he realizes the clanking from Tony's side of the bed has stopped entirely.
He looks away, but he can't look away for long. Tony is petting his hair, gingerly, as delicately as he can while still wearing gauntlets.
Tony had always liked giving him things, hadn't he? Tony had always liked knowing he was getting what he wanted. And now he was getting Tony, and it made both of them happy.
"How long?" Steve's voice is a croak.
Steve held out his hands. "He was lying, Tony. You know that. Every word out of his mouth was a lie--"
Tony kissed Steve's cheek. "I love you too. In the interests of full disclosure."
And he didn't have the faintest idea what he could do about it.
Steve grinned back. "I have to say I was pretty fond of the, ahem, extenuating circumstances," he said, and this time he got to see Tony blush.
"About anything," Steve says. He might as well offer everything he can. Maybe he can't battle Iron Man's demons for him, but he'll give him everything he's got if it will lift his spirits even an iota. "Do you need money? I have money."
"I don't care about
Tony's finger came to rest, very lightly, over his hole. And that was all Steve needed. That was everything.
"Hi there," Tony whispered. His nose bumped Steve's.
Oh, he
One hour, forty-five minutes.
was Nick Fury.
"It just so happens," Walders said, "that we have another guest on this program." She turned to the camera. "This evening's very special guest is ViaStone CEO, Tiberius Stone."
"Look," Tony murmured. "Here I am. I made it, okay? I made it through all that. that. I survived. I'm right here. Not going anywhere. Here, here--"
He'd kept an apartment in Brooklyn for a few years. He'd briefly considered Manhattan, but the Lower East Side had changed so much. It hadn't felt like home anymore.
"We are definitely X-Raying you first thing when we get home," Tony said. "No one wants to break and re-set anything."
Help was eight floors down, and the elevators weren't working. Help wasn't going to be here in time.
Tony looked him up and down in a way that somehow made him feel even more naked. It was wonderful. Tony's smile was sharp. "They're all incredibly impure," Tony drawled, a little too casually, like he was testing whether this was okay by saying it.
Of course Steve liked
There was another pause, and then, somehow, the strangest transformation happened. The scowl disappeared from Tony's face, and he looked... apologetic? What was going on?
God, Steve almost wished that were the truth, if only because it would have meant that Tony would finally have acknowledged that everything going wrong in his life right now was Tiberius' fault.
"Like, uh, footie pajamas," Iron Man continues. "As you can see. So I thought, well... it might be nice to be able to... wear a little less metal around you." He sounds hopeful.
Iron Man is clearly out of words. Maybe they don't need that many words for this.
"Yeah," Steve said. "Yeah, Shellhead, I think that'd be a good idea."
Steve was starting to get a very clear picture of how Tony's relationship with Tiberius had gone. He didn't like it at all.
Tony backs away as fast as he can. "I'm sorry," he manages to say. "I have to go. Urgent. Uh. Restroom. Be back soon."
"Yes, you." Steve's nerves are still singing with tension, but he manages to smile. God, he hopes Iron Man says yes. "Is there some reason I shouldn't ask you?" There is, of course, the most obvious answer. "Are you-- are you not interested in me?"
"Hey, Shellhead?" Steve asked. His eyes danced with amusement.
Tiberius' mouth opened and shut. His cleverness seemed to be decreasing by the second; his arguments were gone, and he was reduced to raw, impotent emotion. "Do you know what you did to me? Do you understand," he spat, viciously, "how much I
"Steve--" Tony began, and Steve knew exactly what Tony was going to say, because Tony was the kind of guy who'd stand up for everyone else, and especially for him.
And then the drive disappears. Ghost has probably slipped it into his cloak.
Mr. Stark's never used his first name before.
Steve needn't have worried. His body knew exactly what it wanted to do. He slid his palms a little lower down Tony's back, a suggestion that Steve knew he needed permission for. "Tony, Tony," he gasped out. "That's so good, Tony. You feel so good. Can I-- can I please--?"
"You promise?" Tony echoed.
But Steve just lifted his head and smiled back. "I've always wanted to make you happy, Tony."
"Great!" Jan says, brightly.
"Tony?" Steve ventured. "Is something wrong?"
"What is it?"
"It doesn't matter," Steve said, softly.
Tony was so close. He was almost there.
"Eh." Tony raises his hand and tips it to the side. "Yes and no. The outer layer of the armor hooks into a second piece, and that's the part I have to wear. Not this. On the field, if I were unconscious, you might have tried to strip the whole thing off me, and that would have been... bad, so stressing that the chestplate couldn't come off was the simplest way to go, then. But the outer armor is just armor." He taps his metallic shoulder with one finger. "When I was redesigning the armor, after I got home, I wanted to be able to wear the chestplate under ordinary clothes. Still can't let anyone touch me, or they'll figure it out, but at least I can fit into a button-down shirt. And that's what's really important, right?"
"Because it's the truth," Steve said. He didn't know that there was another answer. "And because I know you. Because I love you, and I want you to be happy more than anything."
Steve found himself chuckling. "For all you know, I'm an Iron Man fan. Which I am, actually. Big fan."
"Oh, my manners!" With an abashed smile, Tony finally dropped his hands entirely, and then he gestured at Steve. "Ty, this is Captain America. Cap, this is my old friend, Tiberius Stone."
And that's when Iron Man
He pulled Tony close and kissed him again. Tony started to smile back, in between kisses.
"No," Steve said, dryly. "I don't believe anyone's ever accused me of that."
Steve frowned. "I was pouting?"
He already knows what's coming. But he's done lying now.
He felt like he was trying to come out of anesthesia and someone was holding him down in it, metaphorical mask still pressed over his mouth. It was like his awful, treasured memories of drunkenness, but there was nothing good about losing himself here. He couldn't keep track of his brain from one thought to the next.
The mystery item was heavy for its size, probably solid stainless steel, and cool in his palm. The shape of it was familiar when he closed his hand around it, bulbous on one end, then narrow, spreading out into a flat flanged base, perpendicular to the rest of the object. Plug, definitely. Well, that was disappointing. A real pity. Tony wasn't going to be able to tell much about the owner from that.
But honestly, he was just here because he... liked Steve. Maybe Steve wasn't ever going to know exactly how much Tony liked him, but that was fine. He didn't need to know. It wasn't like he could ever like Tony back. But that was all right. That was just how it was. And, anyway, Steve was his friend, and that was fulfilling enough. And that was really why he was here. It had been a shitty week -- a shitty few weeks, really, if you counted Bethany leaving him three weeks ago, which Tony certainly did -- and, well, he just wanted to be around Steve. It was as simple as that. Being near Steve just... made him feel better. It was like magic, except actually good.
Tony had found anger again, somewhere within him. "I don't know what your problem is," he said. He laughed, a short bark. "I mean, I do know what your problem is, actually." He looked Steve up and down. "You're jealous."
Tony--
Yinsen puts his hand on Tony's shoulder. The touch is a comfort until Tony starts thinking about how it might be the last time another human being will touch him there; the chestplate will cover everything. But this is what he has to do.
That was what Mr. Stark had said, too, but he doesn't need to tell Iron Man about that conversation.
"Then are the Avengers accused of closing ranks around him, or are we not?" Steve demanded. He couldn't keep the asperity out of his voice. "You can't have it both ways. If you don't think he's affiliated with the Avengers, Ms. Walders, then you can't imply that I'm shielding him because of it."
Steve still couldn't think of a single thing to say, but he supposed there was no getting away now. He stepped inside, and that was when Tony actually saw all of him. Including the splint.
"Oh," Tony said, the fight gone out of him. He looked like he wanted to hit himself in the face. "That-- that wasn't in the history books."
Steve's gaze darted to the door leading to the master bathroom. "Do you want me to, uh, change elsewhere? Getting out of this getup isn't very... dignified."
Steve concurred. How on earth could there have been anything else? What were they going to dig up this time?
If Tony was okay with it, then he supposed he was too. "Whenever you're ready."
Tony raised his head and grinned. Steve was cool where Tony had been kissing him, his mouth slick and wet against his skin; he was hot where Tony was still touching him. The contrast was amazing. Steve wasn't sure his body could hold much more sensation in it, filled to the brim with feeling. And Tony was gentle, so gentle, deliberate and careful, coaxing yet more out of him, keeping him on just the right side of too much.
They know each other far, far too well. This is why they can't be Avengers together anymore. As soon as one of them opens their mouth and says something, it's like this. Tony's under his skin. He's always been. It used to be a good thing.
He's dropping.
There was an obvious answer to that. Steve didn't like it. Tony was going to like it even less.
Sure, okay, he was stalling for time, but also his repulsors weren't quite done charging.
"I trusted
The applause was thunderous.
It wasn't as if they hadn't already loved each other, after all. This was just... more.
Steve's heart is pounding. "If you're saying what I think you're saying, I, uh. I don't have a ring."
"No, no, no!" Steve shakes his head. "Don't even think that. For one thing, what you have, you earned. I didn't exactly have to work hard to look like this. And for another, well, you're real handsome."
"Now we wait for rescue," Tony said, "and since I'm pretty sure you're stable enough to move, I'm not going to feel guilty about doing this."
, not really. She wants Tony. Tony is clearly the ideal choice for this mission. It's one of Tony's villains, in Tony's building. And, unfortunately, Jan really, really can't have Tony. It would be bad enough if Steve went on his own and left Tony alone -- but how the hell can Steve fight Ghost by himself? Tony needs to be there. But Tony is absolutely not in a fit state to step onto a battlefield. Steve isn't even sure Tony can stand up on his own right now.
He turns and practically runs away.
"You did," Steve agreed. He tilted his head in the direction of the nightstand. "The book's still there if you'd like to try reading it some more."
The terrible voice inside his head suggested that it was just because he didn't like jerking off left-handed.
Steve can't say anything to comfort him. Not here, not like this. Not in public. Tony's suffering and there's nothing he can do about it.
On the rare occasions when he'd thought about
Tony was standing there, braced against the closed door. He looked like he'd gotten some sleep since Steve had last seen him, but that was the only positive Steve could name. His jeans were ripped, his t-shirt old and faded, the design flaking. Tony's eyes were narrowed sparks of blue flame, his face flushed dark, his body rigid with tension. Sweat beaded in the hollow of his throat. One hand came up to rub at his breastbone before dropping back to his side.
Tony looked dubious. Steve didn't blame him. Of course he thought that was a little strange. Everything was different, these days.
"You can't talk me out of loving you," Steve murmurs. "You can't. I'm already here. You've got me. If it hurts, then it hurts. But I don't think it will. I'm yours. For as long as you want me."
Tiberius' eyes widened. "You're lying. They can't be here."
Behind the mask, Tony's face was hot. "Of course," he said, possibly a little too weakly. "I'll let him know. No problem."
Steve obligingly slid his hand down. "You could just tell me your name, you know," he murmured. "Save your strength, Shellhead."
"Thanks," Tony murmurs. He's still got the faceplate down.
Even as he said it, he didn't know if he believed himself. Tony was asleep. It was like some kind of fairytale. An awful one. Helpless, he reached out, and he traced two gloved fingers over Tony's cheekbone, down the side of his face to his sharp, stubbled jawline. Tony still didn't stir.
An unsettling thought occurs to Tony. "It's not-- it's not
Tony doesn't want to hear anyone say the word
It's a joke. Innocuous. But it does bring up the issue of what Tony is wearing. Or isn't wearing. On the one hand, Steve doesn't want Tony to think Steve is expecting something more... risqué... out of this experience, because it's not like this is a pretext for seduction. On the other hand, Steve doesn't actually know what
Tony's reply was low, his voice rough with desire. "I was going to say the same thing." He was smiling, smiling like he was never going to stop.
Tony raises his eyebrows. "Happy now?"
He'd probably have dropped anyway, the way the scene had ended, but he's definitely dropping now. Steve knows Tony. And he knows it got worse when Tony finished suiting up. When he flipped the faceplate down. When Steve had to stop touching him.
Steve wants to hold him. He's not sure Tony wants him to, anymore.
Mr. Stark still isn't saying anything. His mouth is hanging open, his eyebrows raised; he's making abortive attempts at speech, but nothing is emerging. Eventually his lips press together and open again, shaping the silent word:
Steve wondered which of Tiberius' crimes Tony was planning to report. He had a lot of choices.
Steve's heart soars at the thought that Iron Man returns his love, but the rest of his words are a shock of cold water. Iron Man can't really believe that, can he? He can't want to be alone, can he? He can't think that that's how things ought to be.
Tony's always been hot for armor. So sue him. He's pretty sure that's not a secret to any of the Avengers. He does appreciate the inherent eroticism of stripping a man out of a nice suit of plate armor. Not that Steve's wearing full plate, but it's definitely enough to get Tony going.
Well, Steve definitely wants to talk.
Tony smiled a little wider. "Thank you. Thank you for telling me."
That sure wasn't anything Tiberius had been known for. He'd clawed his way to the top on a pile of bodies -- more literally than most people knew. He'd been charming, but he'd also been cutthroat. Ruthless. That was the impression he'd given Steve, in the media and in person.
Yes, God, yes. Tony had been hurting for years. Maybe his entire life. When Steve had been selfish enough to think that he could offer Tony something he might want, he'd dreamed of being good to Tony. He'd dreamed he could give Tony a day, a week, a month, a year of being happy. A lifetime, while he was dreaming it. Tony would always know that he was loved.
Also, come to think of it, Fury wasn't even in charge of the Ultimates. Not anymore. He really couldn't make Tony do anything.
Maybe Tony and this Tiberius fella weren't very good friends? God knew Tony was generous with his affection. For all Steve knew, they were just acquaintances. Former classmates. Fellow businessmen.
"I believe you," Steve murmured, between kisses. "Tony, we don't have to-- I don't want to do anything you don't want to do, okay? The offer doesn't expire."
"I take that back," Jan said. "You're both equally crazy about each other. You always have been."
This is getting worse and worse. Also, Tony does not have FDR's dates memorized. "So that means that today is...?"
It wasn't the best Steve could have hoped for, but it wasn't the worst either.
They'll get there. Eventually.
, I'm so sorry--"
He wasn't that much of a saint. Of course he wanted more. But-- "You don't have to," Steve said, hesitantly.
said you weren't any good, but I bet you're still great. Because I sure as hell believe my friends. I don't believe him. Not for a second."
"I know," Steve echoed. "It doesn't bother me."
He couldn't shake the feeling that he'd just ruined everything he had left.
"Thar's where you're wrong," Tony said, grinning, but he obligingly moved away a little, to give Steve room to wrench his boots off. "I feel I should inform you that everything you do is sexy, and that includes the time I watched you nearly drink paint water instead of coffee."
A laugh rattles out the suit speakers. "I, uh," Iron Man says. "I've never seen a doctor about it."
Surprised, Steve blinks. "That's... the exact opposite of the word people usually use when talking about parenthood."
The newspaper's masthead looked familiar. Steve had seen the name in the news relatively recently. ViaLine had bought it a few months ago; the Daily Bugle had run several grumpy op-eds about journalism being beholden to corporations, which Steve remembered because he'd thought it was ironic coming from a newspaper that itself seemed to be beholden solely to J. Jonah Jameson's need to print libelous articles about Spider-Man.
As if Steve's going to say no. "Of course I do."
Steve had never been particularly good at accepting these limitations gracefully, himself, but there were a hell of a lot of more pressing reasons why he wasn't feeling like an especially good person right now.
So the doctors get a few papers for medical journals on this strange new curiosity, with Tony's identity neatly redacted, and they check up on him about once a year. They can't do anything for him.
"Tony, you don't owe me an explanation--"
"Shh, it's okay," Tony murmured, as he brushed cool fingers over Steve's cheekbone; he was still chuckling, a little. "God, the blush on you, huh? You're lovely," he whispered, and then he laughed again, delighted. He was
"Shellhead, no--"
Tony looked away. "Maybe you should start."
Steve stared levelly right back. "Would you?" he asked, softly.
isn't... exactly something I can promise. Not right now. Maybe not ever. I don't know. I definitely can't promise
He liked the thought of that.
"Mostly not," Steve said, which was true enough. "Mostly just upset at the thought of you being in mortal peril and not telling anyone. Do you think you could maybe let me know about that next time?" He knew the answer to that was probably no. "Can you at least tell me you're not still having heart attacks?"
of falsifying evidence, when they'd set the whole damn thing up. "As I said, the monitoring was in real time, transmitted directly from the armor. There was no possibility of tampering. The opportunity didn't exist."
Mr. Stark snorts in derision. "You'll never be able to touch him, you know. How can you settle for that?"
He shuddered. The armor creaked. Sometimes he wished he remembered that kind of information a little less well. He'd probably have been a happier man.
Steve watches as Tony struggles into his underwear. He's gone soft now; there are still lines pressed into his hips and thighs from the pressure of the rope harness. Steve's trying not to think about sex. Tony stands up for the half-second necessary to get his briefs on, then wobbles and sits down heavily.
"Oh?"
"Uh," Tony said. "Sorry."
"I wish I could," Steve said, his tone just this side of mournful.
Captain America would want him to stay alive. Captain America would want him to keep breathing.
Then the door to Steve's room opens, and Tony is standing in the doorway.
"It's not, though." The words were slurred frantically against Steve's shoulder. "It's really not okay."
And here it was, the truth, straight from Tony's mouth: Tony didn't want him. Tony would never have wanted him.
Steve grinned back. "Same to you."
, so of course you mean it. I just-- I just didn't know that was something you did."
All Tony needs to do is survive, Steve tells himself. It would be nice if there were no property damage. It would be nice if Ghost didn't steal whatever he's here to steal. It would be really nice if they could take him down so he doesn't harass the rest of the world for as long as the Raft manages to keep him in a cell. But none of that is
"Yeah," Tony admitted. "But--"
"I'm sorry," he says. He hates when he doesn't know things that everyone else now does."I don't know what you mean."
, a man who already knew exactly how to do what he liked for him. Steve had known he wouldn't be able to measure up. It had been yet another reason why he'd been so sure that this would stay a fantasy. But now it was real, he'd acted on it, and he had to deal with it.
Tony does not expect to be alive by the next time the Illuminati need to meet. "Sure."
The knot of tension in Steve's stomach loosened. Jan said it was okay. He trusted Jan.
Tony breathed out hard and sharp. "Fuck. You sure don't pull your punches, do you?"
"Anything," Tony says, instantly, breathlessly, practically tripping over the the words in his haste. "Anything you want, I swear. Just don't hurt him."
When Steve stands up and turns around, he's more than a little surprised to find that Tony is standing. Tony's arms are outstretched and his feet planted wide on the floor, like he's not balancing right. The faceplate is still pushed up, and that means Steve can see the faint, but pleased smile with which Tony is regarding himself very well.
. But it turns out that there's one fewer person in that relationship than I thought there was. I'm still upset that you don't like
Maybe he'll never see Tony again, either.
"One more letter. Listen carefully, please." Tony's voice is unsteady. It's kind of an odd request, as Steve is sure Ghost is hanging on Tony's every word. Tony clears his throat. "Octothorp."
Everyone in the room knew who Steve was, of course; there were a few people trying not to look like they were staring at him, because even in this crowd Steve still turned heads. It was hard not to notice a guy in red, white, and blue. Steve Rogers, former commercial artist and ex-soldier, had no reason to be attending any kind of party with Tony Stark. But Captain America was one of Tony's friends. Captain America had every reason to be Tony's guest. So he was here in uniform and everyone else was here in black-tie. He didn't mind it all that much; he'd done this countless times before. He was used to standing out in a crowd.
Tony's hand promptly cupped Steve's balls, caressing him, and, God, that was so good. He was almost there. It was what he did for himself, a lot of the time; he'd always liked the feeling, and now it was driving him closer and closer to the peak, every scrap of sensation in him focused just
He hated magic. He hated magic so very, very much.
Terrified, betrayed by the universe, Steve's face went bone-white in an instant. The pressure of Steve's fingers let up, but that wasn't a problem, because Tony wasn't going to make it out alive anyway. And then Steve was scrambling, making his way up Tony's body, lifting Tony's head out of the rest of the helmet with his sticky, blood-soaked hands, cradling his head tenderly between his palms. That felt nice. That was good. Tony liked that.
Tony wasn't for him. It would be wrong to think about him like this. Not now that he knew Tony didn't want him, had never wanted him, would never want him. Tony wouldn't have wanted Steve to feel like this about him. It was wrong. It was a violation. And Tony was happy, now. Tony had found someone. Steve needed to be happy for him. He needed to put this behind him. He needed to get over Tony.
Tony felt his arm move; he wasn't the one lifting it. That was Steve, he realized. Steve was holding his hand. He could see Steve fumbling with his belt pouch with his other hand, tapping something out on his identicard.
Steve knows it's bad when he's standing here wishing that Tony had the self-possession to lie about how he felt.
Apparently so.
Steve holds up his hands before Iron Man can get too carried away. "Nothing like that! You were great out there, like always." The golden faceplate tilts, as if Iron Man is trying to modestly avoid well-deserved praise. "I meant more of a, um. A personal question."
Steve can't help but laugh. Iron Man -- Tony -- always makes him laugh. "And how do we tell who's winning?"
It was a charismatic smile. Steve didn't know why Tony had named a D&D attribute for him that wasn't Charisma, because this guy was dripping with it. He knew how to work the room, all right. He was lively, his body language was open, and he was leaning forward, still, just a little, making eye contact with Steve. Even though Steve was consciously aware of all the tricks -- he'd had to learn them himself back when the Army had decided that Captain America needed to be better at PR -- he still found that he couldn't quite look away. Stone was damn good at this. Steve supposed that you didn't become the richest man in America if you didn't know how to charm someone out of their money.
"You can't-- if you-- if you take the armor off, I
Steve does not. Of course.
That was all a fantasy. Fantasy Steve liked him like that. Fantasy Steve liked kink like that. Once, just once, Tony had allowed himself to construct a truly luxuriant fantasy, to picture himself showing this side of himself to Steve in all his unsullied innocence, introducing Steve to this beautiful world of pleasure and pain, to everything he'd never known about himself. He'd imagined Steve looking up at him, languid and trusting, letting Tony wrap the softest cotton ropes around his wrists, thanking him for showing him all these amazing new things, promising to stay with him forever.
Steve didn't think this meant Tiberius was a Skrull. Even though Steve had never been good enough to consistently spot a Skrull, the Skrulls were better at not letting anything slip. Their highest priority was not getting caught. No, this was all human, and this was definitely not right.
"Oh," Tony said, softly. There was pain in his eyes now, real pain. "Oh, I see. No, no, you're right. I understand. That makes sense. I'm so sorry."
." His mouth shaped the obscenity very precisely, in a way that made it clear who he was quoting.
Iron Man laughs his familiar staticky laugh. "All right. Go for it."
"Eh." Tony wanted to shrug; the armor wasn't going to let him move his shoulders. "I was proud of it then, but I've made so many more improvements to it now. That old stuff is just... kind of embarrassing. Even setting aside the one with the nose armor."
Yeah, Tony had definitely taken the bait -- hook, line, and sinker.
trying, "but I can assure you--"
--and he had about half a second to realize that there was a third bolt, before it hit him.
God, he wanted to, but he couldn't. He couldn't tell her that he'd caught Tony kissing Tiberius Stone. He couldn't tell her that it was eating him up inside because Tony was with Tiberius, because Tony wasn't with him, because that would have required explaining that they all three of them were queer, and that wasn't his secret to tell.
That's a lot like what Mr. Stark said about Iron Man, the last time Steve saw him. He wonders if they're talking about the same things.
Steve wanted to ask Tony if he'd also like to remove some clothing -- he very urgently wanted to see a whole lot more of Tony -- but, of course, Tony had already gone over all the reasons he didn't want other people to look at him these days. Steve absolutely still wanted to look at Tony -- the scars didn't matter to him, not in the slightest -- but the idea obviously bothered Tony, and Steve wasn't about to be the jerk who ignored that.
After several minutes of wrangling the entire team into the second Quinjet, Carol deposited Steve unceremoniously into the seat next to Tony. It was sweet of her.
"I wasn't going to say coffee, actually." Tony's smile was more than a little awkward. "I think it's a little too late in the evening for that. Or black tea. Herbal tea would be lovely, thanks."
"Ngh," Steve said. "Yes. Please. More. You can-- you can-- you can hit my cock, if you want."
Tony's nod is practically frantic. "You know how I told you that the bondage, with the rope, was like you touching me all over? This is like that, but it's
"I love Iron Man with all of my heart." Steve's voice rings out. "And he
"That's what I like to hear." Tony was unbuckling his belt, one-handed, with agonizing slowness, loosening the end of the strap where it tucked under the buckle. "I spent so long designing your uniform, you know," he said, a not-quite-idle observation. "Nice to get the chance to finally take you out of it." His other hand came up and slid over Steve's thigh. Not quite indecorous, yet, but definitely more than a friendly gesture. Steve still couldn't feel much through the fabric, but the intent definitely counted. "Is this what I'd do, in your fantasy?"
Tony's hand finally, finally closed around Steve's cock, lightly, not even moving, and Steve moaned, struggling to not give into the urge to just thrust into Tony's hand.
"Hey!" Steve said. "What's up, Iron Man?"
"Oh, I will," Tony assured him. "But I'll work up to it."
"Oh, that's not a problem at all!" Jan said. She held her arms wide, inviting. "You can come home with us! Plenty of room in the backseat for you."
Steve looked at him with an amount of earnestness that was threatening to break Tony's heart. "I trust you."
Tony smiled back. "Definitely."
Tony wasn't out. That much was plain to see. Tony had been one of Steve's closest friends for a decade, and Steve hadn't had the slightest hint that Tony was anything other than straight until an hour ago, and it sure hadn't been because Tony had told him. If he hadn't walked in on Tony and Tiberius, he wouldn't have known. He didn't think Tony would ever have told him. Steve couldn't blame him; it wasn't like he'd told Tony about himself either. And it had been very clear that Tony's orientation wasn't public information. Tony definitely hadn't given him permission to tell people. And it didn't seem like something Tony was at all proud of being, as awful as that thought was.
. "Sometimes I have chapped lips."
Tony breathed in and out raggedly, noisily. "So it's over. It's going to be over. I'm on my way to Ty's right now. I'm almost there. I'm going to tell him everything I know. I'm going to break up with him. He's not going to get to do any of this to me anymore. It's done. And I never want to see him again in my life." Tony's voice had risen, strident, defiant, but then he quieted down again. "I don't know if you're still at the mansion, or if you're already gone, but I'm not planning to take long. I should be home in about an hour." His voice wavered. "And if you-- if you can find it in your heart to forgive me, I think tonight I could really, really use a friend. And I'd-- I'd really like it if that friend were you, but I understand if you don't want that. But if you do, I-- I-- that would be really good." He paused. "I'm parked at Ty's now. I'll be home soon. Take care."
"You have no idea what it's like," he hissed. "It's been you and me, Tony, you and me, first and second, from the day we met. But you were first. You were always first, Tony, and I was always second. But you're not first anymore." His eyes had a bright, wild gleam, as if he were in the grip of a fever. He was sweating. "Not anymore, Tony. Because I've finally won. I'm better than you and I'm richer than you. And I'm smarter than you, now. I've fucked you, because you were stupid enough to let me, and I've fucked you over, because you were stupid enough to let me do that too. Your reputation is in tatters. You've lost."
Tony looked up at him now, seeming to realize that they were doing politeness backwards. "Thank you," he said, solemn and earnest. "Not just for the tea, I mean. For-- for everything. You've been... if I said you've been
Steve's jaw was tight, and Tony knew Steve was thinking the same thing he was. "Whole lot of holiday shoppers there this time of year," Steve said.
Jesus, if Steve had been going to panic over the fear that Tony was coming onto him, wouldn't he have panicked at some point during the hour or so that Tony had spent desperately holding him?
Steve was faster than Tony, because Steve was always faster than Tony, and Tony was carrying a fair amount of additional weight. So Steve was back on his feet, shield in hand, standing between Tony and Mordo while Tony pushed himself up. Tony was grateful for the protection. He wasn't actually sure how well vibranium was going to hold up against magic, but it was a nice gesture.
Tony hadn't really known how to approach the matter of their relationship in his explanation. He hadn't said anything. "Sure," he says, only a little wary. "We're good friends."
Of course, the part of the plan Tony wasn't thrilled about was the part where he, personally, was fighting another goddamn magician. It was just a few months ago that he'd been trapped with Doctor Doom in Camelot, and that had been enough magic to last him for the rest of his life.
Learning things about Tony that Tony hadn't wanted him to know had definitely become one of the repeating themes of the past week.
"No, I want you to," Steve said. "Absolutely." He still looked a little wobbly, maybe still a bit uncertain, but Tony couldn't exactly offer him the bed to sit down on right now.
"Yeah?"
"I thought Ty was safe," Tony said, pain and betrayal in his eyes. "I'd known him for years. We were best friends when we were kids. I thought I knew who he was. I thought if anyone was going to hurt me, it wasn't going to be him. He couldn't be another Sunset. He couldn't be another Indries." His laugh was harsh. "God, I'm such an idiot. How am I this stupid? How am I
"Um," Steve said.
was a hell of a word. And invoking Steve's service was a low blow if he'd ever seen one; it intimated that they'd agreed to behave themselves, when Tiberius had done no such thing. It wasn't as if destroying Tony's reputation was protected by the Geneva Conventions.
once he figured out exactly how Steve liked it, and if Steve had realized that five minutes ago he would have just told him that was how he knew Tony was going to be good, because, God, didn't Tony already
After a few minutes of animated conversation with a sergeant at the barrier, Steve hefted his shield and jogged back to rejoin the rest of the team. Somewhere, in the crowd behind the barrier, a photographer's flashbulb went off. Tony tried not to cringe. Oh, Jameson was going to
, like he thinks he's done something wrong here. His eyes are glimmering with tears. The bad kind of tears. "It's all right," he tells Tony. "You're all right. You did everything right. I've got you, okay? I've got you. I'm right here, see? I'm not going far. Just to the other side of the room. I'm not leaving. I promise."
What the hell was happening?
"It'd be fine by me," Steve says, and he can see the tension in Iron Man disappear, like a magic trick; metal creaks as he finally lets himself move. "I'm just happy you're here, Shellhead." He smiles again. "You want to come sit with me, see if you feel any better? We don't have to talk about it. I promise."
Why hadn't he performed a basic scan of the warehouse on the way in? The thought entered his mind as he fell, as he realized he was probably going to hit the floor before he was flight-capable.
, Steve thought, shivering a little -- but it didn't really allay Steve's fears.
He turned the page.
wrong. Maybe I was built wrong." His laugh sounded like another sob. "Half the tabloids think I'm already drinking again. And I keep thinking, well, I can't possibly make the world think any
"I was looking for my best friend, actually," Steve says. "Maybe you've seen him around."
"Duane Freeman can go
"Technically," Tony begins, with an exquisitely-precise tone that Steve has heard out of Iron Man's mouth during countless Avengers meetings, "you didn't give me a heart attack. Stress cardiomyopathy is actually an entirely different phenomenon that happens to present with similar symptoms--"
?" Nose scrunching, he tilts his head to the side like he's the damn RCA dog, and, okay, maybe Jim Morrison is an acquired taste for someone who was last listening to Bing Crosby.
"Cap," he said, his face a rictus of pained horror. "We're, uh. We're not together, remember?"
"I thought that was the idea," Tony shot back, and he couldn't help laughing. God, this was
joke.
He untangles his fingers from Tony's hair and pulls out of Tony's mouth, lifting Tony's head away from his cock, since Tony can't move well enough on his own. Steve's panting, achingly hard, trembling with pent-up desire and frustration, but even with his hands shaking he manages to gently settle Tony back down on the bed. On his side, with a pillow under his head so he won't hurt himself. Even with the alert going, that has to be his first priority. He has to make sure Tony won't be harmed, because Tony's entrusted himself into his care tonight to such an extent that only Steve can help him now. Tony can't really do much for himself. So first and foremost, Steve has to ensure Tony is safe.
"Your mouth," Steve said, far enough beyond shame to beg for it. "Please-- you said-- and if you still want to--"
Then Tony remembered the Iron Man plug.
Steve can make a good guess, but he has no idea what the protocols actually are. He does need to know. And Tony's employees aren't bothering to explain it to him, because they probably figure that the explanations are Iron Man's job and that Captain America is the sidekick tonight.
"Nothing anywhere close to what you were planning to do to me," Tony said, calmly. "When you were trying to ruin my mind there, at the end, I hit you back. The cerebellum's such a finicky little part of the brain, isn't it? Don't worry, the muscle weakness should only last a little while. Hours. Maybe a few days, tops, on your legs. DreamVision really shouldn't permit that. I know you assured me last week that the hardware version in production was perfectly safe and wouldn't allow the user to come to harm. It's a shame that someone disabled the safeguards on this prototype unit, isn't it?"
"Yes," Steve says, simply.
"What?" Tony managed to say.
"It's over," Steve told him. "It's all over now. I know it was bad. I know you must feel awful. But you have nothing to be ashamed of. You didn't do anything wrong. I know he hurt you. But he's never going to be able to hurt you again. And you'll never have to see him again."
Steve squeezes his eyes shut in misery.
And if Steve's goal here is also to make Tony feel good -- well, they don't have to go about it the same way, do they? That's what Tony was saying. Steve gets it now.
So he couldn't say anything to Carol. It would have been nice to be able to confide in her. He would probably have felt better for it. But he absolutely couldn't.
"You love me," Tiberius implored him, one last argument. "I know you love me. I know you've always loved me--"
"Hold them both in one hand," Tony said, and Steve carefully took them, mimicking the way Tony was holding them, and then he took the multimeter in his other hand. Good. "Keep your hand on the rubber part; don't touch the metal. Then just, uh, shove it in."
Then Tony's twisting under him, rolling Steve off him, a move Steve's pretty sure he taught Tony on the practice mats a few years back. Tony's eyes are bright, his smile irrepressible. He flips Steve onto his back and crowds up against him, halfway atop him. Tony's shoulder bumps Steve's jaw and Steve gets a face full of warm, slippery muscle and the scent of lavender and metal.
He and Tony hadn't had that kind of Serious Talk yet, but he was pretty sure it was coming. And he was pretty sure Tony was just as besotted, so he liked to think he knew what Tony was going to say.
He lifts the faceplate. Underneath, his face is blotchy, tear-stained. But he smiles. The smile is a little strained, and Steve realizes he's trying. This is Tony trying with absolutely everything in him to hold it together, just a little longer.
Steve had whispered so many dizzying words in his ear, endearments and promises. And he says them again too, this morning: "I love you, Tony," he murmurs. "I love you so much. I'll love you forever."
It did, actually. Steve breathed out, shakily. Sure, it still stung a little, thinking about how Tony hadn't trusted him. But he knew how easily Tony would believe the worst of himself. And it was easy to see how he'd dismiss Steve's attempts to tell him otherwise.
Strangely, Mr. Stark's eyes widen in surprise, as if that was the last possible reaction he'd expected from Steve. "Glad?" he repeats. His voice is high, infused with a degree of emotion that Steve can't quite comprehend. Why is this so important to him? And why
What was he supposed to do now? How was he supposed to fix this? He needed to figure out what to do. Fast.
Tony sighs and shuts his eyes. Right. Back to work, Avenger. Time to face Steve again.
Tony hisses between his teeth, plucks the packet from Steve's fingers, and rips it open himself. "Give me your right hand."
The ride home was pleasant, as it always was with Jan and Hank, and it was a little past midnight when they got home, when Steve finally made it to his own room.
The world around him seemed unreal, insubstantial. He couldn't hold on.
"I'm not gay," Steve said, helpfully but also extremely confusingly, and Tony turned around. "I looked it up, and I think they call it
What was Steve supposed to do, tell Tony he was easily manipulated? Oh, Tony was going to love hearing that one.
"I should have figured out you were the one who needed a vibranium alloy, though," Tony said, ruefully, "so don't give me all the credit." Time for the other question that had been eating at him all night. "Where'd you get all this?"
"Cap!" Iron Man yells over the comms. "Duck!"
He wonders what the hell Tony wears when he thinks someone else is actually going to be looking; he suspects he might not survive the answer.
"Captain?"
"It absolutely doesn't change anything," Steve repeated. "You're my best friend, Tony. I care about you."
Oh. Right. There had been a point to this exercise other than failing to come out to Tony.
Eddie sniffs a few more times and stops crying. "A present? For me?" His eyes are wide now with excited curiosity, and not with fear. "Really?"
Steve's gaze unfocuses; he's not entirely in his own head, and Tony's seen that look on the faces of so many telepaths. He's checking. After a few seconds, he shakes his head, and Tony's stomach unclenches.
"Okay," Steve agrees. It's technically not a lie. He's not calling a hospital right now.
," Tony breathed against his lips, between kisses, and it looked like any way he kissed Tony was fine by Tony as long as he kept touching him while he did it. He could do that.
When he'd woken up this morning, Steve hadn't imagined that by nightfall he'd be attempting to answer the question of exactly how much he should try to lie to Tony. He wasn't a good liar. He knew that. And he definitely wasn't any good at lying to Tony. But he couldn't tell him the whole truth.
He should have made the bed. Changed the sheets, probably. They were fairly clean, he thought, but it was the principle of the thing. On the other hand, Tony was probably tired enough that he could pass out on any flat surface, and it wasn't like Tony was going to consider the state of his sheets a dealbreaker.
So Steve wrapped his arms around Tony and pulled him close, as they kept kissing. He wasn't that much bigger than Tony but he was sure he could still manage to make Tony feel safe. Tony was mostly on top of him again, the whole length of his body pressed against Steve's, their legs tangling. Steve slid his hands over Tony's back, and Tony moaned encouragingly into Steve's mouth as Steve's hands once again reached Tony's ass.
This was what Steve got.
There's no way Tony's doing this without getting to watch Steve pound him. He has to see Steve like this. He
"Not the Avengers," Steve said, quietly. "The Invaders."
But because Steve is Steve, Steve scowls at him and says, "Shouldn't you be in bed?"
"Besides," Tony added. "You did say you liked my hands. So I thought you might like the opportunity to appreciate them."
Today had just gotten a whole lot more interesting.
"Okay," Steve said. "Then I'm going to head out. See you around."
Then Tony jerked his head across the room. "And as for you, Ty, you've definitely met an Avenger before! Jan and Hank are right over there!"
into him. There's a heavy weight, dropping suddenly onto his back, and as the drive skids just out of reach Steve twists his head back to try to take stock of the situation -- and there's nothing. There's no one there.
"I can't ask you to be celibate--"
That's more like it. "
"You're smart," Steve began, and Tony started at that, like he hadn't expected, of all things, a compliment. "You're the smartest man I've ever met. For my money, you're the smartest man in the world."
It was clear that Steve didn't know. That he didn't think it would mean anything to see Iron Man's face, because Iron Man couldn't possibly be someone he recognized. Well, he was about to find out how wrong he was about that. They both were.
"It'll be good for your image," Fury told him, like he was actually serious. "It'll make you look responsible. Mature. Faithful. Stable. You'd probably be happier, too. Having someone to come home to."
"He asked if I was dating you," Tony said in horrified realization, and, yeah, he'd caught up now. "I remember that I had no idea why he thought that, and he-- oh, God, I'm an
"Hey, Shellhead?" Steve offers, as gently as he can, because he doesn't know what else to do except be kind, and hope that's what Iron Man needs from him. "You want to come in? Door's always open for you."
"That's so nice," Steve breathed. Tony glanced away from the sight of his fingers in Steve's ass, to check Steve's expression. Steve was smiling dazedly into the pillow.
He dodged Carol's first two jabs, and when the third went high, he ducked in, came up, and hit back, a solid right cross to her midsection at what was about half strength for him. It would probably have stopped an ordinary human, or at least slowed them down, but hitting Carol was a lot like hitting a heavy bag if the heavy bag also laughed and made Army versus Air Force jokes in between punches. She was
Tony just grinned back, like Steve had told him the world's best secret. "I'll look forward to that, then."
Steve knows what he has to tell Tony now, even if it's not something he particularly wants to discuss. "But that wasn't what happened tonight. You weren't helpless at all. You did something."
Besides, he'd known Tony was queer for over a week now. And surely Tony should have seen by now that Steve wasn't in the throes of some kind of gay panic. Tony knew him better than that. Tony knew how many friends Steve had had who'd been queer, didn't he? Tony definitely knew about Arnie. Arnie had been Steve's childhood best friend, for God's sake. And he'd never treated Arnie any differently, not even back in the thirties when almost anyone else would have looked down on him for who he was. Arnie had been his friend, period. So Tony should have known, at the very least, that it wasn't homophobia. And they'd talked about this. They had.
"I could, though." Iron Man repeats the offer, a little less hesitantly. "I would. If you wanted me to." He blows out a breath; it whistles through the mouth-slit. "I did mean it when I said I wanted you. Quite a lot. You just can't-- I'd rather you not try to reciprocate."
"The good news," Tony added, with a flash of a smile, "is that the rescue beacon still works, so with any luck the rest of the team ought to be showing up in the other Quinjet in a couple of hours. Now, stay still and I'll go hunt for the first-aid kit."
Steve takes a deep, trembling breath. He can say this. Iron Man likes him. It's okay to ask. "So," he says, "would you-- would you be interested in a second date?"
A hideous connection clicks into place inside Steve's head. "You have a heart condition."
Something in Tony's face softens when Steve says
This was what Tony had meant. When he'd been talking about making charges stick, about his word against Tiberius', he'd meant this.
Steve settles himself in front of the computer, clicks on the search bar, and starts typing.
Subjectively, Tony's getting hard. Fast.
"Yeah, but that's passive," Tony retorted. "To pick it up, you'd have to actively be monitoring for it and looking for my position, and you'd never--"
"Can I... keep going?" Steve asked.
If he could have told his past self about the future, he was sure his past self, poor and cold and hungry and lonely, would never have believed that
Anyway, that meant it was ViaStone's paper now. Which meant it was Tiberius' paper. Steve wasn't really surprised.
"Of course not," Steve assured her. "I wouldn't be a superhero if I didn't love it, would I?"
"Now, then," Tiberius began. "You've said that you believe I owe Mr. Stark an apology for... defaming him?" He raised his eyebrows, inviting Steve to quibble with his word choice.
Steve doesn't know what he's supposed to do. He stands there. He waits. He counts time by the pounding of blood in his head.
"Hi, honey," Tony said. "You want any help with that?"
, was there?
"Yeah," Tony says, hoarsely. "That's actually part of the, um. Problem. Say, could you tell me the name of the president?"
If Iron Man couldn't ever get off on it, or if Iron Man just didn't want someone to touch him -- that would be one thing. Iron Man would be offering all he wanted, and then Steve might consider it equitable, because they'd both be fulfilled, one way or the other. But if Iron Man can't have what he wants, then Steve would be leaving him hanging, and that's obviously unfair.
Steve supposed that made some sense. Tony probably felt like he owed him. And it wasn't anything Tony wouldn't have done for any other teammate in need, surely. And Steve would have done it for anyone else too, just the same. That meant it had to be all right.
"I'm offering," Tony said, with a still-weary smile, "because I love you to pieces even if you did kind of fuck this one up, sweetheart. Also, it's a lot better than the other option."
Steve hadn't said the word
So Tony didn't know that Steve himself was queer, but that-- that was different. Wasn't it? It wasn't like Steve had ever actually been with a man, and he knew his inexperience could hardly make him sound convincing to anyone at all. Or, for that matter, appealing as a romantic prospect. There wasn't a kind way to gain experience, either. Even though Steve was single now, now that he and Connie had parted ways, he could have dated a man if he'd wanted to. It would have been cruel of him to string along someone he wasn't really interested in, or to make someone else an experiment for his bisexual curiosity. It wouldn't be fair to them. Other men were attractive, sure, but no one else was Tony. And, anyway, it hardly mattered, because Tony didn't like men and therefore Tony certainly didn't like him and that was the end of it.
"I know," Steve said, and for Jan's sake, he even tried to believe it.
"Say," Tony added. "While we've got you here, would you consider letting us in on what your ultimate goal here is? Did you just want to ruin Christmas?"
Steve bites his lip. "Not really."
Iron Man's eyes are bright, and he laughs another static laugh. "It's so kind of you to assume I'm a gentleman, Winghead." And he steps just a little closer. It's enough.
"Is that something you want too?" Tony finally asked.
Steve squints at him, because that doesn't make any sense. "You said you couldn't take that off."
Tony's gaze snapped to his, and he looked like he wanted to cry more. "That's the problem, actually. You were-- you were there a lot."
Then Mr. Stark looks him straight in the eye. "What about as his boyfriend?"
He was usually so much smoother than this. Hell, he had a reputation. But Steve clearly didn't want the reputation, or else he'd probably have asked Tony Stark.
"Ride along with Starsky and Hutch!" Tiberius said. Oh, that was a TV show. Steve had heard of that one. "Any world you want to be in, DreamVision can take you there."
Quickly, he rolled off Steve, but he didn't go far -- he just pressed himself up against Steve's side and then he reached out and cradled Steve's face with both hands, as if he could impart the strength and fierceness of his opinion by touch alone.
"I don't know about that, Shellhead," Steve says, in as kindly a manner as he can. "I happen to like all your feelings a lot. And it's just me here. You can like whatever you want and I'm not going to judge you for it. You can like this. I'm glad you like this." He smiles. "After all, I like holding you. I'm glad there's something I can do for you that makes you happy."
The rest of Steve's feelings didn't matter. Tony needed this.
Iron Man makes a quiet clicking noise. Steve supposes that must be agreement.
"Believe it or not," Fury said, "your teammates care about you. They asked me to step in." His mouth thinned. "I got the impression they thought you might take it more seriously if it came from me."
"Yeah?"
"Me too." Steve's voice was hoarse. "There's also the part where until last week I thought you were straight, so I definitely wasn't going to tell you how I felt. And then I found out you weren't straight, but it really wasn't a good time to tell you that I wasn't either."
And then Tony sat up, threw his arms around Steve, and leaned into him, hard.
Daring, Steve runs his fingers over Iron Man's wrist, up the inside of his arm, as Iron Man exhales hard and shudders in unfeigned pleasure.
They'd finished sorting through the rubble in the basement in record time. Tony's armors that he'd hidden away and refound before the whole Sise-Neg thing were still there, even if most of his workshop was toast. The computers were all broken, screens smashed in by the Wrecker's crowbar -- but the Masters of Evil hadn't, thank God, made it to the mainframe, and at any rate Tony had tape backups, which turned out to also be intact.
"I'm sorry!" Steve blurted out, suddenly finding words all at once, and, even worse, all the words wanted to come out of him at the exact same time. "Oh my God, Tony, I'm so sorry, I had no idea that you were--" He had no idea how to end that sentence. He stuttered, started over. "It was just that yesterday you said you'd go out to brunch with me today, and you didn't answer my messages, so I thought I'd come over and see if-- I can't believe I-- oh God. I am so, so sorry."
The clerk is squinting at Steve. He's out of uniform. He's nobody. She has no idea who he is. He's the mystery man marrying Tony Stark. He kind of likes that.
So he waited. He definitely did not think about Tony naked. Tony wearing his clothes. Tony in his bed. It was like a decade of his dreams coming true, except, in the most important way, it wasn't.
That was his cue.
Heading across the room to the other side of the bed, he finds the end of the rope binding Tony's arms together, tucked up between his shoulders, looped through the back of the harness to secure it. He undoes the knot holding the arm tie in place, pulls it out of the harness ropes, and the whole thing starts to unravel.
"Guessing you like it gentle, huh?" Tony asked. "Didn't know a guy could get this wet. Also guessing you don't, uh, need much in the way of lube," he added, and Steve's cock twitched in Tony's hand.
But it wasn't like Steve really knew what drove men to kill themselves, did he? And he didn't know the business details, not like Tony and Donahue probably did. Maybe Stone Incorporated had been wounded so grievously by Stark Industries that there'd been no way for the company to recover even after Howard Stark's death. That could have been the case.
"Best man I know," Steve repeats, obligingly.
"I believe you when you say you want to," Tony admits, "but, like I said, you know more about me than most people do, and I wasn't kidding about the shrapnel. It's, uh. It's not actually all that pretty, underneath the armor. Not anymore."
"Yes?"
Oddly, the permission actually helped. "Mind if I, uh, think about you now?"
He could feel the blood still flowing. How did he have that much blood in him? How did anyone?
Yep, he was definitely on the good drugs.
"Oh!" Tony said, brightly, earnestly, turning to Steve. "Everything's okay now. Ty explained it all to me. It makes perfect sense, you see. I just didn't get it before."
The helmet tilts. "Okay." Tony's voice is barely audible through the filtering, a whisper of agreement.
doing it.
, Captain. It'd be
, he told himself.
"I don't know." Tony shrugged. "I thought he might have. He met her. I don't know if you ever talked about any of it with him. You were working with him, a little after. I don't think you were speaking to me when it started. You were upset about me trying to date Jan. You, uh." Tony inhaled sharply. "You definitely weren't speaking to me when it ended. That was definitely my fault."
"So that's a no," Tony concluded, acidly. "No mercy for them. So tell me, Ty, why should I have any mercy for you?"
a story for all those medical journals and history books.
Tony would probably like that, wouldn't he? It wouldn't be the best blowjob Tony had ever had in his life, no -- Steve harbored no illusions that his own abilities would currently live up to his own fantasies -- but surely Tony would enjoy it.
meant for Carol lately. "Did she-- what did she--"
, Steve, I promise--"
. It was wrong to out someone who didn't want to be out. And it was wrong to treat it as a weapon, to make being queer into something filthy and dirty and damaging. Which was absolutely what the press would do, if they found out. And it would be all Steve's fault. Steve would be no better than those he fought against.
That wasn't at all what Steve had expected to hear. "Really?"
He just needed some time alone. Time to clear his head. He'd be better. He'd get better soon. He had to.
He wouldn't have said it if he didn't think he could do it, Steve reminds himself. And Steve trusts Tony's judgment. Even here, even now, even when he's like this. Tony knows his own limits well enough to be able to say no when he doesn't want something, or Steve wouldn't have done any of what he's done with Tony tonight. And, sure, this isn't sex anymore, but Tony's saying yes to it. That has to mean something.
The doors open. The lights are dim; the red glow of the emergency exit signs is the brightest thing in the room. This floor is a maze of filing cabinets and hastily-abandoned cubicles. The stairwell in the far corner is visible from here. Steve steps forward, and then reconsiders, turns, and gently tugs Tony out of the elevator by his wrist before the doors can close.
Then Tony blinks and draws himself up with a clatter of metal, and Steve supposes he was listening after all.
Steve didn't want to take it from him, either, since it was obviously comforting him, but he did slide the drawstring bag he kept for this purpose over the shield. It was the world's most unconvincing backpack.
He has a point. He's a genius. Of course he has a point. "I'll do my best," Steve tells him.
. They're the ones who hurt you. He's the one who hurt you. That'd be like blaming a murder victim for walking into the knife."
"I guess that answers that," Steve says. "Definitely not dead."
"It's not about the pizza." Steve takes a breath and steels himself. "Look, I don't know what your financial situation is like, and I didn't want to say anything before, but-- the way I was raised, I learned to help people. We didn't have a lot, when I was growing up, but if there was someone you knew, someone you cared about, if they needed something -- well, you tried your best to help them out."
"Anyway," Steve said. "It wasn't about that. I just-- I just figured you didn't want me looking at the scars on your chest. That was all."
," Steve says, maybe a little too harshly, because Mr. Stark flinches in response. "He's an Avenger, just like the rest of us. Sure, I wish he'd told me before now about his health -- but that doesn't change anything. He's clearly perfectly capable of fighting alongside the team. As team chair, I can't ask for anything more."
Tony's face was open, earnest. He dug his thumb into the join of Steve's neck and shoulder, working out a knot there that Steve hadn't realized was there.
Oh. This was where Tony wanted to start.
"Good," Steve said. "Glad we could clear that up."
"Tony--" Steve begins. He doesn't know what to say -- has he ever known? -- but he has to say something. Because this isn't right. This isn't like that.
Abruptly, Tiberius sat back down, landing heavily in the chair. He was staring at Steve. He'd stopped smiling. His eyes were wide, and for an instant, just an instant, Steve glimpsed the emotion behind all the masks: fear.
. Maybe even
"That's the test?"
. "The invitation said nine. I already asked Happy to pick me up from here at 8:30, so if you want to meet me out front then...?"
Tony's smile now was a little steadier. "Yeah. Yeah, he does."
"A fact that most people know about the Avengers is that Tony makes our gear," Steve began. "He does. But I'm not sure that most people understand what that means on a day-to-day level."
Steve spreads his fingers wide and puts his hand against Iron Man's, matching the length of their fingers, flattening his palm against the glassy bump of the repulsor. Iron Man could hurt him with a flick of his wrist, but he won't. Steve knows that in his soul. He thinks that's one of the reasons they understand each other. They both know how to hold back their strength, in their own way. How to be careful.
He lets his hand settle on Tony's upper arm; Tony exhales in a long shudder and his eyes fall half-shut, heavy-lidded with pleasure. He's smiling. Steve wants to paint him.
He stroked Tony's cock a few more times, faster, tighter, and then he realized Tony was tapping the back of his wrist, trying to get his attention.
"Hey!" Tony called out, indignantly. "That's cheating!"
Stark Tower is scrupulously well-maintained, and the elevator ride is silent and smooth. The only reason Steve knows they're moving at all is that the little red numbers on the wall keep ticking up.
"Did you splint me with one of your greaves?"
Steve was clearly never going to suspect him of being world-renowned playboy Tony Stark now.
Steve signs his name next to Tony's. He lets out the breath he was holding. This isn't the ceremony itself, sure, but this... it feels important. This is real. Official. This is where their life begins.
So Steve hasn't asked Iron Man, and he wouldn't dare ask Mr. Stark. Iron Man clearly must feel that Mr. Stark's safety is important enough to him that it's worth protecting him personally. That's an attitude Steve can respect. He definitely understands and approves of the impulse to do good in the world; it's why they're superheroes, after all. He just wishes he had more time with Iron Man.
. The very thought makes him want to cringe.
Tony's breath rattles in Steve's ears and yeah, he's still crying under the armor. There's a quiet sob over the comms. Something inside Steve clenches up. Tony's still suffering, and he still can't do anything about it.
"I'll say," he muttered.
Steve didn't know until tonight that Tony uses his armor to keep him upright, but he's not surprised, now that he considers it from this angle. It sounds like a thing Tony would do. He always wants to look fine from the outside.
"Well," Steve said, like he'd put down a heavy weight all at once and didn't quite know what to do with himself now. "That's good. That's really good."
Some of the color is starting to come back to Tony's face, but he still looks like hell. He looks away from Steve, staring at nothing, and for a split second he looks so
and, wow, his cock really liked that idea. He squirmed a little. He was pretty sure his cock was smearing more pre-come on Tony's leg. He was pretty sure Tony was aware of that. "I, uh. Maybe."
And she'd meant it.
Tony's hand caressing his wrist--
Iron Man just watches him, silently. Steve doesn't understand what the problem is. Is he too proud to take Steve's money? Does he not want to tell Steve the reason he needs it so badly? He doesn't have to tell him that. It's not Steve's business.
"Nah, I'm fine for right now," Tony says. "Maybe in the morning, though, yeah. I mean, we still have the whole day off tomorrow, right? And I think Jan ought to give us extra since it's not like we got the night off. What with Ghost."
? It didn't make any goddamn sense. It had to have been him behind it. But what in that footage had been worth killing for?
If that wasn't why Tony was balking at intimacy, if Steve didn't remind him of Tiberius, then why? What was the reason? Was it just too soon? Steve knew he had an unfortunate habit of rushing headlong into romantic relationships. But then, so did Tony, so really, that seemed unlikely to be the reason.
And now, here, like this, Tony's not holding anything back. He can't. He spent the last of his energy dealing with Ghost. There are no polite facades. No masks. There's just Tony, who is sad and scared and reliving a fight that's already over every time he shuts his eyes.
"I'll have to make sure the villains get the memo," Steve says, and he realizes he's grinning back. "I'll let them all know to lay off."
This is not the most dignified position he's ever been in, and he feels a little silly swinging one leg over Tony and coming down kneeling, one leg on either side of him. The towel between them slips out of the way as Steve settles, and that's much nicer. He's a little off-balance and his hands end up on the outside of Tony's arms as Steve slides forward. He's putting more of his weight on Tony than he meant to, leaning further forward, pressing up against Tony's back.
like you," Steve repeated. It wasn't really repeating himself, though. Maybe it was more important, this way. "And that's the truth."
"Tony," Steve gasped. "Tony, Tony, yes, perfect, thank you so much, I love you, I've always loved you," he breathed, and he came.
"I know," Tony said, with a faint smile. "And that means the world to me. It really does. You meant a lot to me when I didn't even know you, too. When I was having a hard time, I'd-- I'd tell myself to be brave like Captain America." He chuckled. "I still do, sometimes."
"I'm going to have to decline,"  Tony said, thickly.
After that, the food arrived, and Steve was touched to see that Tony must have spoken to someone with the catering, because they'd given him the chicken
Tony smiled and lifted his water glass in Steve's direction, an impromptu toast. "To friendship, then?"
"Yeah," Tony said, hoarsely. "Yeah, you do. But you felt real in the dream, too."
tell." He licked his lips, a convulsive motion. "You know everything else. Anyone else, I'd have to explain the drinking, or my father, or-- or the queer thing, and you know already. And honestly, I don't think I'm brave enough right now to come out to anyone else. I didn't even manage to tell you, did I?"
"Can you help me out of this?" Tony asks.
The heat of Steve's hand on his face faded. Steve wasn't touching him. Steve had let go. Probably to do what he said he was going to do, if Tony let him. It was cold without Steve there. Tony thought about crying some more.
Captain America --
"You're wonderful," Tony says, in the same soft tone. "I mean that." He smiles, a tiny little ember of happiness. "I love you too."
Steve never noticed. He never knew he was supposed to notice. He's been so stupid. His throat is tight, and he hears himself make a soft noise of anguish and embarrassment.
Maybe that was still how it was. Maybe that was how it was inside Steve's head.
Tiberius smiled like a snake. "Not quite, Tony. You've forgotten I have
Steve dropped a kiss just under Tony's jaw. "Let's see if I can get you feeling even better. Fewer clothes, you said?"
"I thought what I was doing was pretty clear, actually." Steve kept his voice as level as he could, and he rose to his feet.
The room was silent. Jan looked down at the paper Tony had left, and then back up at Steve.
Then Steve was hoisting him over his shoulders like a sack of flour. He stretched Tony across himself, Tony's whole torso balanced all along Steve's shoulders, with his legs dangling down one of Steve's arms and his face pressed into the star of the uniform on Steve's upper arm, his own arms dangling one on either side of Steve's body. Steve grabbed the arm that was on his front with the hand that had been bracing Tony's knees, pulling them together so that he was, more or less, holding Tony's hand across his own body. Steve's fingers were scraped and the leather of the gloves was rough. It was weirdly intimate.
He got in a couple more hits, and Carol staggered backwards. Nothing Steve could do to her could actually hurt her, but if he was fast enough he might be able to get her off-balance enough to hit the mat, because she was still lighter than he was. Weight was pretty much the only thing he had going for him.
"You could. Um." Steve's throat is desert-dry. "You could get a little more comfortable, if you wanted. I wouldn't mind."
"I know," Tony said, and hope flared in Steve's chest, but then Tony kept talking. "But the thing is, Ty's never lied to me either." He half-smiled. "I know you believe what you're saying. So one of you has to be wrong." His throat worked. "And I don't think it's him."
Mr. Stark slowly settles back into his chair. "Okay," he says, very softly, and Steve can't help but feel like he's said something wrong, though he doesn't know what. "If you're certain."
. This is probably another LMD."
Steve does not spar frequently with Vision, for precisely this reason.
"Well, yeah." Tony scowled and didn't let him finish the sentence. "You've never been all that fussed about me changing in front of you before. And as far as I can tell, there's only the one thing now that's new. It's an easy conclusion to draw."
"I don't have proof," Steve admitted, "but I'm going to be very, very surprised if it turns out he didn't hire Radioactive Man to murder that news crew. Meaning that someone can definitely lean on Chen Lu. Who, incidentally, tried to kill
But this is bad. This is really bad. Jan doesn't want
Iron Man, of course, isn't at the debriefing, and Steve hopes to God that means he's getting medical care somewhere. He hopes someone who knows about the armor -- there has to be someone else who knows -- can help him. Maybe Mr. Stark is helping him right now, Steve thinks, hopefully. Mr. Stark designed the armor. He has to be able to fix it. To save Iron Man.
"Oh, no, no, no! It wasn't like that," Steve said, quickly, and thank God, Tony looked a little better again. "We were sparring. I threw a bad punch. It was an accident."
Tony's biting his lip again. "What if I wanted to?" he whispers. "What if I wanted to say it?"
Tony noses Steve's jaw and presses kisses to his throat. And then he stops.
How did it keep getting worse? It shouldn't have been possible for it to get worse. But Steve had thought that when he'd pulled Tony out of DreamVision, and it looked like the universe really enjoyed proving him wrong.
"Oh, is it?" Steve asked, amusement glinting in his eyes. It was a little bit of a dare. Clearly everything always was, with Steve.
But even if Iron Man's not really a robot, the problem Steve has isn't actually entirely
They were still holding hands, and Steve squeezed Tony's hand right back. "You better."
He couldn't see how this was better than not telling him. He'd never seen how this was better. Did Tony think Steve was going to be okay if Tony had a massive heart attack in the middle of battle, a heart attack that Steve would have had no idea was even a possibility? Was it going to be better if Steve didn't know it was coming? Was that somehow going to hurt Steve less? How was keeping it a secret going to help anyone? He'd known Tony was Iron Man for five years, and it wasn't like Tony hadn't had health problems after Steve had found out. Had Steve ever asked him to leave the team, back then? He didn't think so. He'd known who Iron Man was. He'd still wanted him on the Avengers. He always had. Did Tony not believe that?
"Maybe I'll come down your throat," Steve muses, and the thought of it makes him snap his hips a little more firmly. Tony moans enthusiastically in response and that-- wow, that really does a lot for Steve, knowing Tony wants to swallow. Steve's always liked that, and Tony wants to give him what he wants, doesn't he? Fire rushes through him, burns hotter. "Make you swallow it all. You'd like that, wouldn't you?" Tony moans again in wordless agreement. And then -- oh, oh,
Anguished and heartsick, he looked around the room again, trying to make sense of the situation. It didn't look there had been any kind of struggle, which made the whole thing even more confusing. He knew Tony wouldn't have gone willingly. Even the most charismatic smooth-talker in the whole world wasn't going to be able to get Tony in bed after everything Tony had found out about Tiberius. But he hadn't fought him off. So what the hell had happened?
knew that. Maybe they didn't know that Tony was Iron Man, but they definitely knew that Iron Man and Captain America were inseparable -- and, for that matter, that Tony and Captain America were pretty good friends, as well. What did it matter if Tony didn't love him like he wanted Tony to love him? What did it matter if he was never going to know what it would be like to kiss him? What did it matter if he was never going to be the fella Tony took home with him? What did it matter if he was never going to learn how it would feel to wake up at Tony's side every morning?
"Oh?"
Tony loved him. He knew that. Of course Tony loved him. The whole damn
Bound, Steve tried to shrug, but both his shoulders moved as he twisted. "Not much of a choice. The cheap stuff breaks on me. Never holds up with how hard I need it."
"Maybe I'd like to see if I can improve it," Steve returns.
That changed the situation here, all right. Now Steve definitely didn't understand what was going on. It was possible, remotely possible, that it could all have been a coincidence. That would mean that the whole fight was real. It was unlikely. But if it had been a setup, that meant that Tiberius either specifically wanted Iron Man dead or just didn't care if he died. And neither of those options were good. There was no way Tiberius knew Tony was Iron Man, because obviously he wouldn't have been trying to kill him. It wasn't like he wanted Tony dead, after all. But if he was the one behind this, then he definitely didn't care about Iron Man's life.
"Oh," Iron Man says, and then, in an entirely different tone, "
He heads in the direction of the row of elevators. Five seconds later, he realizes Tony isn't following him. He turns back. Tony's just standing there staring.
Tipping his head against Steve's shoulder. Tony chuckles. "Tell 'em they can reschedule."
. In very human, filthy, kinky ways.
An exhausted smile twitches across Tony's lips, and then his brow furrows. His eyes narrow slightly, his gaze intent. Even like this, Tony's observant. Tony's focused on him, and he's doing a better job of it than Steve is. "Steve, are
If the universe was being kind to the Avengers, then hopefully the guy was camped out in an abandoned warehouse in one of the outer boroughs. Not that Tony especially enjoyed Quinjet flights to Brooklyn at combat speed, but at least that meant that for the most part, civilians would be kept out of it. It was far better than, say, Midtown Manhattan. Even an easy fight there got about ten thousand times more difficult when they had to manage that much potential collateral damage.
It was probably silly of him, but, well, he was upset and he was lonely and he could get by on very little sleep if need be. So he'd decided he wasn't going to sleep until Tony was asleep. Once Tony had finally relaxed enough to sleep, Steve could content himself with the thought that Tony now felt safe and secure, and Steve wouldn't need to keep watch. And then he could sleep. He'd already turned off the light, in readiness. The only illumination was from the streetlights outside.
"Can you--" Tony began again. He cleared his throat. "I'd, uh. I'd really like to see you. If you'd like that."
He says it like he wants it to be a joke, but they both know it isn't. Tony's still not in great shape to be alone.
"You should have seen the crash, though," Tony continued, tying the bandage off and moving to Steve's elbow, and that was when Steve realized that Tony was trying to distract him. "It was a spectacular landing, if I do say so myself." He half-smiled. "I like to wake up every morning and ask myself what I can do to make the Aviation Safety Reporting System cry today. I think we make up half their crashes every year, between the suits and the jets."
that felt good. The sensation was a little blunted through the heavy fabric of his uniform, but the weight and warmth of Tony's body was exactly right, a presence he'd longed for for years. Tony kissed him again. He gasped against Tony's mouth; he couldn't quite stop himself from twitching his hips up against the lush curve of Tony's ass, looking for more, looking for everything and anything Tony would give him. He braced his hands on Tony's lower back, holding him steady, right where he needed him. He would have felt selfish, greedy, but not for the fact that Tony moaned, wordless and delighted, breaking the kiss to drop yet more kisses over Steve's face, desperate and uncoordinated, like all his focus had finally turned inward, like he was finally daring to reach for something he wanted, for himself.
Tony's chin came up, and he watched Steve in silence.
He slid the book out an inch or two, tipped it into his hand, and straightened up. Time to find out.
Steve got his boots and socks off. He didn't bother putting them anywhere organized, and, barefoot, he sat back on the bed. Tony promptly leaned into him like the fifteen seconds they hadn't been touching had been an eternity. That was about how Steve felt too, honestly.
Steve has no idea what's going on. "I respect Iron Man's privacy," he says, bewildered; maybe if he explains this, if he explains how he feels, Mr. Stark will see the truth. He's not going to hurt Iron Man. He's not going to demand anything from him. "I don't need to know everything about him. He doesn't have to tell me anything he doesn't want to tell me. I know everything about him that's really important."
"I promise," Steve repeated. He smiled softly. "I know what I'm getting into, eyes open, and I still want this. I want you. I do know you, you know."
. Molten metal was sloughing down half of Tony's faceplate, blocking one of the eye slits and half of the mouth.
"I love you too."
But it's not like he could go to a dungeon, anyway. Even out of uniform, even with a secret identity, he's too recognizable these days; there aren't
"You're the one with experience," Steve said, happy to follow Tony's lead. "What would you like?"
This was probably too intense for a first scene. Neither of them had ever been normal, though, and Tony certainly wasn't planning to start now.
"Sorry about the noise," Steve said, and then he emptied a clip into four different beekeepers, who lay groaning on the floor in agony.
That wasn't exactly how the saying went, he knew. He didn't exactly have the spare brain cells for witty repartee right now.
Steve realizes he sounds far too panicked than he should for such a simple question, but his mind is rapidly filling with scenarios of how awkward that would be. He can't ask Iron Man's boss, a titan of industry with far better things to do than cater to Steve's every whim, to interrupt his own breakfast to call Iron Man up here just so Steve can ask him
Iron Man seems to notice the fraying state of Steve's nerves; beneath the mask, his blue eyes widen in concern. "Cap?" he asks. "You all right there? You look a little... overwhelmed."
Amazingly, Iron Man can actually spare some time for him during the day, and even more amazingly, they end up in the East Village for a late lunch. Iron Man can't eat in the armor, but he insists there's a pizza place that Steve absolutely has to try.
Steve would have put him, conservatively, at about 72 hours awake. That would be what he'd have expected if Tony hadn't slept since before the news story had broken on Wednesday morning, and that looked about right. Steve, unfortunately, had a lot of experience determining exactly how exhausted Tony was at any given moment. It was one of his least favorite professional skills.
Tony flipped Steve's phone shut and set it on the nightstand, atop his copy of
"Anyway," Iron Man says. "Much as I wish I could stay, it's past my bedtime. Have to leave before I turn into a pumpkin, and all."
Steve wonders what else Iron Man wanted to say.
"I love you," Steve said, because there wasn't really anything else he could say, was there?
network, Tony -- talked about how she thought you were responsible. And my guess is that if Radioactive Man hadn't died, the story would have still been that you'd hired him to take Tiberius hostage because you were upset about the Whiplash story, and that you'd set the fight up. That was what they started with, you know, while the fight was happening. I don't think you heard that part. You were a little busy at the time. But Tiberius has been trying to pin the entire thing on you, from the get-go."
The workshop door is closed, and Steve can hear the faint strains of music on the other side. Mr. Stark said it was all right, Steve tells himself. Mr. Stark said he could come by anytime if he wanted to talk.
The blue eyes behind the mask are quizzical. Iron Man's probably wondering what Steve wants with him. "What do you need? Did you want to talk tactics? Because, I mean, I thought that fight went pretty well, but if you--"
Steve's not used to having
. At first I thought maybe you were putting it on for me, playing it up a little, to make me feel better about how I was doing, because you knew I wanted to hear it...?"
Embarrassment, it turns out, is an interesting emotion to have while not technically being alive. Steve glances away and expects the heat of his shame to warm his face. Then he realizes that that's not how it works without a heartbeat.
"Flatterer."
Maybe this is what hell is like.
"Now you have a great deal to think about, hmm?" Mordo's voice sounded like he was a very long way away. "I believe it is time for me to make my exit, Avengers. Farewell. Or perhaps... fare poorly."
It was convenient of him to split it all up by gender, Steve supposed. It put Tiberius in a category of his own.
For the first time, the past feels like another life, when he calls it to mind. "Depends how much you were wearing," he says. This conversation is surreal. He never thought he'd be telling anyone about this. "They used to say you had to wear three items of clothing of the appropriate sex, or they arrested you. Don't know if it was a real law, but that was the excuse. It was usually what they hauled the queens and the butches in for, when the bars got raided."
Steve was silent for a while, and Tony began to wonder if he shouldn't have said anything.
He goes through the debriefing afterward as quickly as he can, all his thoughts focused on the man sitting next to him, and soon enough the meeting is adjourned. The other Avengers start to leave and that, unfortunately, includes Iron Man.
Steve sat up, moving slowly, to let Tony know he hadn't interpreted the question as urgent, the way a call to assemble would have been. "Yep. Still awake."
Also if Steve wanted to destroy an entire planet right now, Tony wouldn't be able to stop him. The current power play has a slightly higher power rating than usual.
There's a burst of static as Tony clears his throat. Sniffs. Tries to compose himself. "I don't need to call anyone," Tony says, slowly, brokenly, a terrible confession. "That won't be necessary. The plans are-- they're-- they're on a networked account. Private. But I happen to know the password."
That, Steve noticed, wasn't the same thing as saying yes. "I know," Steve said, softly. "I know I've seen the scars. But I also know you never wanted me to. And if it's going to make you the slightest bit uncomfortable or worried at all, to have me looking at them again, I don't want to do that to you. The scars don't matter to me, but it's not my opinion that counts. It's yours. So if it matters to you, then I'd like to respect that." That was something Tiberius had probably never said to Tony. "It's okay to draw a line here. I want to give you exactly what you want, and that also means nothing you don't want."
"Steve."
"Had enough of him, have you?" Iron Man asks, and there's a strange note in his voice.
Eddie extends a hesitant finger and points at him. "You're red."
It had been a long time since he'd primarily lived somewhere that wasn't the mansion. And it wasn't as if he didn't have anywhere else to go -- he still had an apartment, after all -- but the issue was more that he had a whole lot of belongings to figure out what to do with first. He'd always considered himself a person who hadn't been tied down to material things; when he'd joined the Army he'd had only what could fit in his pack, and when he'd woken up in the future he'd had nothing. He still thought of himself as that fella, a lot of the time. So it was a surprise to find out that he owned so much
Steve holds him tighter. "And look," he says. "I'm still here."
-- his uniform is outfitted with more sensors than it looks like it has from the outside. Tony can have Steve's vitals on his suit HUD all the way through a battle. But Steve can't exactly do the same for Tony. The best he can do is leave the private comm line open, with a set of band-pass filters that he's spent a long time customizing, with Tony's help. He can hear Tony breathe, and that's nowhere near all the data he wants, but it's all the data he's got.
Steve thought about the ride here, about Tony's hands wrapped around his waist, his thumb dipping ever so slightly inside Steve's belt. He thought about what he'd wanted. Maybe it hadn't been all right to want it then, but it had to be all right now, didn't it? And it was selfish, maybe, to ask for this -- but Tony had said, he only got one first time. And Tony had asked for something he'd wanted, and Steve had given him it, so surely it was all right to ask for this.
He thinks about Steve telling him he loves him and blinks back tears.
At least Tony thinks he can armor up by himself. He's not okay, no -- but then, Steve already knew he wasn't. He shouldn't be disappointed. Everything in him is sinking. But he should be expecting this. Tony's not okay, but he's doing the best he can.
Tony looked like he was never going to stop smiling. "I know we already established I wasn't dreaming," he murmured, "but now I'm starting to wonder again." His voice cracked. "I just-- you're here and you want this and you
The scales of Justice moved slowly, but two hours later, Steve was confident that they were finally beginning to tip in the right direction.
"I will explain everything later," Tony says. "I promise."
Tony smiles and presses his lips against Steve's. Steve doesn't have the coordination to kiss him back, but that's fine, that's great, because Tony's tongue is sliding inside his mouth and, oh, that feels nice, and then Tony's fingers tighten over the head of his cock and that feels even nicer, and then Steve's coming, helplessly, his cock jerking in Tony's hand, waves of pleasure washing over him like he's been denied for days and not hours, coming and coming, hot between their bodies.
," Steve breathes. "Oh, that's lovely."
So was this. It just didn't feel like it.
And now Tony was in even more danger.
And this time Tony caught him at it, because he clapped his free hand over the fresh mark on his collarbone like he wanted to hide it, which was when Steve also realized that he knew exactly what was going through Tony's head.
Then came a set of nipple clamps -- surprisingly not vibranium, but then, Tony figured that made sense if no one had to struggle against them --and then a blindfold, and also a fairly sizable ball gag. Whoever wore that gag was probably a man, judging by the jaw size that could accommodate that, but, again, Tony didn't know if that was the box's owner.
He felt awkward as soon as he'd said it; it wouldn't be hard for Tony to read something into that phrasing that he hadn't actually intended to say. But he also couldn't truthfully say that he didn't want it to be true, because he did. But he couldn't let Tony know that. Except at some point soon he'd have to, wouldn't he? Otherwise he'd be-- he'd be taking advantage of Tony. The thought made him sick.
"All right," Steve said. "We'll table that for later, then." He'd try to solve one problem at a time. "Do you want something to eat or drink? If you want food I haven't got much here that doesn't come in a can, sorry, but someone somewhere will definitely deliver."
"Oh?" Tony asked. He must not have thought Tiberius' remark had sounded mean; he grinned back.
Mute, Steve nods.
And then one day, Steve comes down for breakfast and finds Mr. Stark in the kitchen.
. Steve didn't deserve this.
"I do have some news," Tony said, because he always, always wanted to make Steve feel better. "Not a lot, but it's better than nothing."
"You were willing to marry Natasha," Fury pointed out, mildly. "I don't think you're that picky."
Tiberius sagged back against the bed. Then he glanced over at Tony. And oddly, he was smiling. It was a tiny smile, cruel and cold. This was the real Tiberius Stone. "The authorities won't believe you, you know," he told Tony. His voice was smooth. Oily. "You have no proof. None. It's your word against mine. And which of us is in the media's good graces these days, hmm? You know it's not you."
favorite," he adds to Eddie, as he eventually manages to peel the sticker off without removing his gloves.
Tony fishes the single-use lube packet out of his coat, takes the coat off, folds it over the nearest chair -- he wasn't raised by wolves, thank you, and this is a Van Dyne original -- flips the lube packet onto the table, and waits.
was drunk. I was definitely very drunk. But I'm not sure he was. I don't think he'd drunk anywhere near as much as I had. Or as much as I thought he had."
They could just go on with their kinky sex life, enjoying their Iron Man butt plug, and they were never going to know that Tony knew about it. That was how it was going to be. It didn't matter how he felt about it; they should get to keep their fantasy life as private as possible. This was the closest he could get to making that happen for them. He had a secret identity. He was good at keeping his mouth shut.
Steve's goddamn perfect eidetic memory let him quote back every one of Tony's words, let them cut him open anew.
"You're going to want to put the news on," Wanda said. "Right now."
Tony's business decisions were torn to shreds. The last time he'd faked his death. All the companies he'd lost or given up. The news painted a picture of a man desperate to regain his wealth and status, a man who would be willing to take down Donahue just to make himself look better. A man who'd commit murder.
-- is only saying this because he's upset, because he's scared, because he's trying to push Steve away. But knowing that doesn't make the words sting any less.
It was a full-strength punch that he'd never, ever have used on a baseline human. Some part of him suspected that most of the time he'd consider it vaguely unchivalrous to throw at a woman. But he knew Carol could take it.
Steve's cock twitches hopefully.
As it turns out, he doesn't end up seeing Iron Man until that afternoon. And when Steve does see him -- well, the immediate circumstances aren't exactly conducive to romance.
"That's a good thing, right?" Steve asked. He hoped it was good, in Tony's mind. Being queer. Tony hadn't seemed to be a big fan of it last week. But then, maybe he'd changed his mind.
"I didn't mean it was
It's a bit of a contradiction, given what Steve is actually here to do, but whoever said that humans made sense?
"It was supposed to be impossible," Tony continues. "I was the only one. The disease never lets you fall for a dead man. And you were dead, we all thought you were dead, and I never knew how any of this could be happening."
The air in front of Mordo's midsection glowed green, and Tony hastily killed his left-hand repulsors, hooked his gauntleted fingers into the back of Steve's shield harness, and threw them both sideways, just in time.
Steve glares back. This isn't going right at all.
, that's-- that's a hell of a thing."
"He knows I'm Iron Man now, by the way." Tony's voice was very carefully devoid of emotion. "I didn't tell him. It turns out there's a fair amount of telepathy, of a sort, involved in DreamVision." His words were halting. "And it's not exactly... consensual."
Thirty seconds later, his diaphragm is spasming in agony, and there's bloody mucus and white magnolia petals all over his pillow, and he is never, ever, ever going to jerk off again, oh God--
"I'm okay," Tony whispered. That was what Steve needed to hear, and it was true. "I'm okay, I'm here, I'm safe. I'm not going anywhere without you."
He saw the flaw in Tony's logic. Maybe not the way Tony would have -- after all, he wasn't Tony -- but he felt it, instinctively, like a tactical plan with a hole in it. It didn't feel right.
Three more. Only three more. He was certain of the people he'd already eliminated. That meant that it absolutely had to belong to Monica, Dane, or Steve. Neither Monica nor Dane had been there today. That would be the easiest explanation for why no one had stepped forward to claim the box. And either of them made a hell of a lot more sense than... Steve.
"I wasn't kidding about having more than one round in me," Steve gasped out. "So if you really don't want to swallow, you should probably... not," he added, reluctantly.
Tony reaches out and takes his hand again. He places Steve's hand firmly on his other arm, next to the cuff that the gauntlet rolled into.
He looked away from Tony. He looked around the room. He tried to think. He stared up at the skylight, then down at the squares of illumination spreading across the floor.
Steve nods. "I'll do that."
Steve stroked the line of Tony's spine, down and up again, as far up as his neck, not daring to move past the collar of his shirt and touch him skin to skin. He couldn't in good conscience tell himself that that would be only for Tony and not for him. So he didn't. Besides, Tony had said he'd hit his head earlier, and Steve definitely didn't want to poke any tender spots again.
He should have told him. Not about the part where he had feelings for Tony, because of course Tony didn't want him, but he should have at least come out. At least then Tony would probably have stopped accusing him of homophobia. It was Steve's fault, that this was happening like this. Steve was the one making it possible.
He hopes like hell he's not lying to Tony.
So Ghost's tech is all still working, and he's probably in the middle of taking whatever he wants to take. But if he's disabled the cameras, it probably means that he's not expecting company right now, and he's either still visible himself or whatever he's doing would leave obvious traces on camera. And that means that, if Steve can see him, he still has a chance of catching him.
"All right," Steve said, a voice of pure command. "Avengers, assemble."
Tony shivers again underneath him, and, yeah, Tony likes this, all right. Steve manages not to rock up against him at that thought. He has some self-control.
"I bet," Steve said, gently. "And I was fine with that one too, wasn't I?"
Steve found he was grinning back. "That's why I said it, Shellhead."
"No, no, that's really okay!"
Tony couldn't quite see Mordo from all the way over here, but the light being cast from the far end of the floor was distinctly unnatural, and the crackle of barely-perceptible magical energies was making the hair on the back of Tony's neck stand on end.
"I'm really glad you're still here." Steve's voice was shaking, choked up. He didn't think he'd ever felt this small. "I'd have missed you a lot if you-- if you were gone."
Steve's smile was shy. "Good to know it's not just me." He glanced back at the probes. "Now what?"
Tony hummed softly to himself, as if he'd found something about the banal threat somehow intriguing. "I've actually been to Hell, you know," he confided, and, wow, Steve really had to pay closer attention to some of those mission reports. "You get to visit a lot of interesting places in this superhero business. I met my father there. He had some similar words for me. And I punched him in his goddamn arrogant face and left him in Hell, where he belonged." He leaned in and smiled sweetly. "Someday you're going to join him there."
Steve had been hoping Tony would be a little more forthcoming than this, but Tony had been the one who'd brought it up in the first place, so he didn't seem to be unwilling. It was as good as Steve was probably ever going to get.
Tony was holding him tight, because of course he was. What else was he supposed to do? Steve's uniform was too thick for him to register anything other than pressure, but Tony was most definitely right behind him, his chest up against Steve's back, crowding closer when Steve slowed down. Steve couldn't feel the warmth but he could imagine it well enough. If Tony hadn't been wearing a helmet, if the air had stilled around them, Steve would have felt the heat of his breath on every exhalation. Tony's hands were at his waist, exactly where they ought to have been; nonetheless, Steve was very aware of Tony's touch. Tony's grip was strong, firm, and perfectly decorous; Steve might even have called it professional. It didn't stop Steve's imagination from working overtime, though. Currently, as they sped across the Manhattan Bridge, he was thinking about dancing. It wasn't even sex, which was probably pathetic, but he knew Tony was a good dancer. If Tony danced with him, Tony might hold him like that. It was one item on a long, long list of things that weren't going to happen.
Ghost's triumphant laugh is muffled by his faceplate. "Is that all you've got, Captain? Really? That's not going to work." He pauses, thoughtfully, and his head tips in Tony's direction. "And you, Iron Man? Not even going to join in today?"
And Tony did. Exactly as Steve had asked, exactly as tight as he wanted it. Steve was beginning to suspect that one of the reasons everyone else had liked sleeping with Tony so much was that he was, as a general rule, incredibly responsive to good feedback. It was a fact Steve had figured out about Tony early on, somewhere in the first few years of being Tony's team chair, but somehow he hadn't anticipated that Tony would be exactly the same in bed. And this meant that of course Tony was going to be
"Say," Steve says, "you ever thought about taking a turn at this?"
Steve remembered what Tiberius had said about Tony's father. Did Tony think Steve would think less of him because his father had hurt him?
"Oh, longer than that," Steve said. Tony was trying to speak, but no sound came out. "I definitely loved you -- you and Iron Man, I mean -- before that. And I, uh. I thought you were very handsome." His face was getting hot again. "And I'd just learned that two of my best friends were the same best friend, and you understood me, like no one else did, and you were so kind, and I loved you so much, and I knew right then that... that was it. You were it. Didn't know what I was going to do about it. Didn't think I was going to do anything about it. But I knew."
Tony looked genuinely surprised, like he'd never in his life thought that Steve would want to pretend to be anything other than the noblest paragon of virtue, even in a game. His eyes went wide. "A
Stephen blinks at him in incomprehension. "Yes? I thought that was the point."
an engineer.
"Yeah," Tony tells him. "Yeah, go, go, go, fuck me, give it to me hard. I know you want to." He pauses, takes a breath, realizes he has one last thing to clarify. "On my back, though."
Steve spends his morning run lost in a haze of daydreaming, counting down the minutes until he can finally see Iron Man, planning every word of his speech. His feet carry him back to the mansion, through the gate, through the door, past the foyer, into the kitchen, where Iron Man-- where Iron Man--
There's a distant, muffled static noise. "Just me," Iron Man calls back.
Her grin went wider. "Sparring," she clarified. "That kind of fighting." She lifted her hand from Steve's arm, mimed a few punches, and then straightened up, tilting her head back to look him in the eye.
He wasn't sure the words made sense, but Tony nodded like he understood what Steve meant, and he squeezed Steve's fingers again before letting his hand fall away. Awkwardly, Steve removed his hand from Tony's shoulder. He wished Tony were still touching him. He couldn't ask for that.
punch wrong, huh?"
For a few seconds, Tony was silent, his gaze passing over Steve's whole body, his brow furrowed in an expression of intense scrutiny, though Steve had no idea what Tony was looking for. Then Tony grinned and said, "Actually, I think you're still at least fifty percent Captain America right now."
"That's a myth, you know," Tony said. "As long as you're getting better, which you are, you're allowed to sleep."
He's still hot, Jesus, he's still
Eddie giggles.
Outside, the night was as quiet as it ever got in Brooklyn; it was probably coming up on four in the morning now. The streets were empty of people; even the cars were infrequent. There was an odd kind of serenity here, a calmness. Steve wondered if Tony felt it too. If maybe it was making Tony feel safer. He hoped so.
Steve's lips thinned. He couldn't make himself say it.
He'd tell the truth. It was all he had.
Iron Man laughs, and the sound is almost sad. "That's because you're trying harder than anyone has in my entire life. And even so, there are things you don't know about me. Things you wouldn't like if you knew them."
The spell went wrong. He knows who he needs to talk to.
This wasn't good.
But this afternoon he was looking for comfort, and he ran his finger across the shelf until he found the copy of
Steve's mouth twitched. A tear clung to his chin. "Good," he murmured. "That's good. I'm glad it feels nice. I like touching you too. Always wondered what it would be like if I did, you know?"
"Not that, either," he says, as softly as he can, and then he dares more. "Just this."
Steve wanted to hug him. But Tony was all the way on the other side of the couch, and Tony was clearly done with touching him for the evening. "You can't blame yourself for that."
It was all in Steve's hands now. Literally. But that felt right, too, more right than anything had in years.
He knew exactly what the lies looked like. He knew what hiding it looked like.
. The last thing he remembers is 1945. You
Regardless, Steve's certainly not going to tell Iron Man either, not if Mr. Stark hasn't. It wouldn't bring anything good. And the last thing he wants to do is hurt the man he loves, especially now that he knows he loves him.
Tony half-smiled. "It's fine. It's definitely not the worst thing that's happened to me in the last-- how long have I been here?"
Steve was wrong about Tony. Tony can
definitely going to need practice, and somehow I'm thinking that won't be a dealbreaker for you."
Tony was smiling again, but the look in his eyes was still strange, something lonely and sad and--
"Steve!" Tony was calling from behind him. "Hey, Steve, wait! Hold on a second!"
"And how hard's that?" Tony drawled, because he was damned if he wasn't going to have some fun, making Steve talk about it.
Iron Man's eyes are even more dazzling than the chandelier above them. "Maybe you wouldn't. I did some research. It started out as the Yiddish Art Theater, for plays. It was a movie theater for a few years back in your day but I worked out that you were probably in the Army by then, or close enough. And then it was a regular theater again, and now it's a cinema again. Shows a lot of arthouse films."
He set his cell phone in its charger, and he kept packing.
He squeezes Tony's shoulder again, and slowly, slowly, so slowly that Tony has plenty of time to stop him if he wants to -- he starts to move his hand up Tony's shoulder, to the side of his neck. His thumb brushes Tony's jaw.
Steve's hand is in his pocket and he's pulling out... oh. His phone. The date and time are on the lockscreen, of course, but the background--
The coffee's good. Mr. Stark always buys good coffee. Steve suspects it's also very expensive.
Iron Man steps out from behind a set of shelves, bowl of popcorn in his hand, and he's wearing-- well, Steve isn't exactly sure what he's wearing. Some kind of coverall. It looks like long underwear, or a child's set of pajamas, but obviously in an adult size. Like a union suit. Steve doesn't know if they still have union suits. Maybe they've evolved into this. The fabric looks soft, cozy. It's covering his entire body, save for the helmet, even right down over his feet. He's wearing gloves on his hands too, made of a similarly soft-looking fabric; they're the only separate pieces on what is otherwise a one-piece garment.
Tony must have been in a bad way, if he was flat-out asking. Of course he was in a bad way. He was crying. But Tony almost never asked for things like this, even when he was sad, like he thought it was a terrible imposition. And of course Steve knew Tony had a whole lot of reasons to feel extremely upset right now. But there was a difference between knowing that and seeing Tony go to pieces in front of him.
He didn't regret what he'd done. It had been the right thing, to try to stand up for Tony, to try to tell the world that Tony was innocent and that Tiberius was to blame. He already knew that in whatever version of his words they aired tonight, he wouldn't come out well. He'd seen firsthand how much Tiberius could warp the truth in just one conversation, and he knew that with several hours of lead time and a team of professional editors who probably lied about reality for a living, they were absolutely going to eviscerate Steve in the version of the interview that they were going to broadcast.
, Steve realized, sickened. It had been hurting him. He'd been hurting all along.
was a ritzy mansion on the Upper East Side.
in years. Maybe ever.
That was also nice, but Tony was the one who was leaving. Tony was leaving, he suspected, very soon now.
Steve's eyes open immediately. He props himself up, squinting into the light of the corridor beyond Tony.
His feet carried him all the way across the mansion's first floor and into the library. He'd always liked the library. It was quiet, serene, lit by sconces, full of comfortable, overstuffed furniture. He'd liked it from the beginning, because at first to him it felt like it probably hadn't been a room that had changed a lot since his day. Familiar. Known.
He rushes down the corridor into the sub's tiny head, shuts the door, rips his helmet off, and he doesn't even make it to the toilet or sink before the flowers start. They're roses, this time, falling into the curved shell of his helmet as he slumps to the deck. The petals are a striking blood-red, coming out of him in single petals at first, then clusters -- and then, finally, a damning full blossom.
Steve's brow furrows. "How do you know my name?" He does put his fists down a little. Maybe it's the American accent.
. "It's very interesting that you should say that, Captain," she murmured.
The triumphant smile on Tiberius' face was rapidly disappearing. His lower lip quivered, and his eyes went wide. He took a deep breath. "
"Good," Tony said, and he swung out again, harder.
Iron Man laughs. "Am I?"
He fetched a glass and filled it with tap water.
Steve likes that he makes Tony happy.
. Do try to keep up."
Oh, Tony's been complimentary about his hands, in certain specific contests. Other people have said similar things to him in bed. But there are some things that get said in the heat of passion and never outside of it, and so Steve's assumed that there wasn't anything particularly noteworthy about his hands. There are a lot of ways someone can satisfy their partner, and no one's ever expressed a preference for his hands specifically, more than any other part of him. He's had no reason to think he's uniquely gifted.
"I can ch-- I can ask Mr. Stark to change it," he offers, hastily, as if he were the one who had done it, as if he thinks he's made some kind of mistake here. "If you'd rather have something else, I mean."
Just as Tony had promised, Tiberius gave a press conference saying exactly what Tony had said he would say: Tony had visited Donahue at Tiberius' request, and to the best of Tiberius' knowledge, Tony was not responsible for the death of Whiplash. Steve had watched it on the five o'clock news, seething quietly.
"Yeah?" Tony asked again. "Anything else you'd like?"
Steve held Tony tight. He stroked his hair. His shoulders. His back; The fabric of Tony's borrowed t-shirt was wrinkled and bunched between his shoulder blades. "I love you," Steve said, fiercely. "I love you so much. It's not a lie. It's real. It's always been real."
They don't get the chance to play like this often, so Steve's determined to spoil the hell out of Tony. And Tony loves rope. Steve's got him trussed up with several long lengths of cotton rope -- crimson, because they both know how good Tony looks in red. The chest harness had to be modified a little to avoid putting pressure on the charging port for Tony's heart; the loops of rope branch around his breastbone, wrapping around his sides, doubling back on each other to sketch out intricate geometric shapes. Tony's skin is dewy, golden in the lamplight. His muscles ripple. He's bound. Restrained. He's lying on his side, which is necessary because the leg harness forces him to bend his knees all the way back; Steve's tied his ankles to his thighs, more or less. Tony's flexible. And he likes it. Steve watches his thighs quiver. God, he's beautiful.
Even if now, that seemed to be a thing that Tony had forgotten.
Steve frowns. "Soon?"
Steve didn't let him finish. "Yes. Whatever you're thinking of, the answer is yes. It's the thing I want the most. Absolutely the most out of everything."
"Do I
." There was a very, very small smile on his face. The smile of a victor. "So I'm asking you if you have reason to think that Mr. Stark believes I'm defaming him. It's a simple question. Why are you here, Captain? Did he ask you to come? He didn't, did he? Because he doesn't believe I'm doing anything wrong. Isn't that right?"
Steve had thought -- naively, perhaps -- that Tony would be content to let him take the lead. He was delighted to be proved wrong, as Tony turned his face against Steve's hand, kissed his palm, and then began kissing slowly along Steve's upturned wrist, his lips trailing delicately over Steve's inner arm. Steve heard himself gasp, a wordless little sound. There was a familiar surge of heat gathering within him, the beginnings of arousal. What was unfamiliar was the fact that he didn't have to suppress it, repress it, wish it away, pretend it wasn't happening. It was all right, now. It was all right to be here, like this, to want a man, to want Tony. It was better than all right, even -- Tony would want to know. It would make Tony happy to know that Steve was enjoying this.
"That's-- it's not--" Steve said, and he couldn't even say what it was. He could feel himself tense up, frustrated. He had been so much braver inside his own head. He should have been better than this. He'd never had this problem with women, but then, that was different, wasn't it? The world taught you how to deal with it when you wanted women. You could think about what you wanted. It was permitted.
He couldn't say that.
Tony licks his lips and smiles wider. "S'going
Steve unclenched his fists and inclined his head. He could be pleasant. He could do this. "I've never made any secret of my friendship with Tony Stark, ma'am," he said. His voice was tighter than he wanted it to be. "As I've said, he's one of the best men I've ever known. Since the day I woke up decades in the future, Tony has been immensely kind to me. Just as he is to everyone. He's done so much good in the world, and I'm honored to be his friend. And the same, actually, is true of my friendship with Iron Man."
"Bareknuckle okay?" he asked.
But he still knew the truth, even if no one else did. And it mattered that he'd tried. Even if it wasn't going to change anyone's mind, it was important that he'd done it.
His awareness of the world narrowed down, focused; the only sensation that mattered was the heft and weight of Tony's cock on his tongue, filling his mouth.
After taking another sip, Tony set the glass down on the counter next to him. The sound had a ringing sort of finality.
"It's okay," Steve says, gently, knowing the words are inadequate, but he doesn't have anything better. "It worked out. We made it. No one died."
smile that made all the blood in Tony's body start heading south. "I'm counting on it."
Iron Man looks down at himself and makes a soft, mechanical clicking noise, and when he speaks, his voice is choked with emotion. "Just what I've always wanted."
Steve wanted to object to something about the wording of
Tony let his hand slide down from the back of Steve's head to the scruff of his neck, pulling the cowl back with it as he went, a deliberately dominant move that was presuming a hell of a lot, but it looked like Steve could use it. Steve sure didn't seem like he wanted to stop him anytime soon. Tony wasn't going to let his brain dwell on the thought of Steve, wanton and needy, because they clearly still had a few things to talk about first.
"We did." Tiberius agreed. He smiled a crooked smile. "You know, I imagined what you'd be like before I met you. I imagined you'd be decisive. Confident. A natural leader. A worthy opponent. And then I met you. You were
might be the one being proposed to.
Tiberius waved a dismissive hand. "Oh, them? They don't count. You know that. I already knew them. Our sort of people, and all."
? What the hell? He was here baring his heart and Steve didn't even think it was the truth?
But the words won't come, and something inside him is raw, keenly-edged. He doesn't want to talk about how Tony saved him precisely because Steve failed him. And Tony had been in the state he was in in the first place because of Steve. Steve was the one who'd dragged Tony under and left him to drown.
? The bed's right there." He points with a jerk of his chin. "Please. For me."
And Iron Man kisses him.
He pulled his hand out, opened his fist, and saw gleaming red. Huh. He revised his materials guess: plated stainless steel, obviously. Well, red was an interesting color choice and certainly one of his personal favorites, but-- oh.
someone else, am I?"
Tony's eyes are bright. "Maybe if you wanted to give me a massage with the armor on."
"Isn't it?" Tony said, mirthless. "You were right there for the detailed review of my nonexistent talent in the field of gay sex." He winced. "I know, I know, don't talk about exes in bed. Rule number one."
Steve didn't even feel bad about his unexpected clumsiness, both because Tony was laughing joyously, smiling down at him, and because the motion had caused Tony to reposition his weight in a way that Steve liked a hell of a lot. Tony was solid; he probably weighed twice as much as anyone Steve had ever taken to bed. It was an interesting feeling, not being so much bigger than the person he was with. It was new. He found he liked it.
"A couple hours," Tony says, with an apologetic smile. "I'm sorry, I got distracted. Here, here, come on up."
His hair caught in the light from the room above, shining golden, and then he turned, face in profile, then full-on, pale blue eyes roving over Tony's body, and something in Tony's drug-addled mind finally clicked.
Tiberius was still squinting at Steve. "Have we met?" he asked, frowning, like he was trying to place Steve's face in his memory and hadn't quite made it. "I don't remember you from the party."
"They said it's not unusual that the tumor would recur after three years." Tony's looking into the distance. He sounds like he's reciting a mission report. "The good news is, they do think they can operate. They think they can probably get it all. I hope they can get it all. Otherwise, well." He grimaces. "You know."
"Whatever you want me for," Tony said, thickly, and then he stopped for a good twenty seconds because his brain hadn't figured out how to finish the sentence. "Whatever you want me for, you're going to want me to be able to think straight. Asshole."
The casualty list hit the news just before midnight. Radioactive Man was missing, presumed disintegrated in the explosion. There had been four people in the SSN van, including ViaStone's executive director of programming, a man named Milo Stevens.
He inclines his head. "Thank you."
for his parents' death. Ty resents me. He's resented me for years. He holds me responsible. And everything he's been doing, I guess, is getting revenge. The news stories. Radioactive Man. Getting... close... to me, so he could hurt me even more. So he could manipulate me. So I'd trust him and he'd ruin my life the way my father had ruined his father's life. It makes sense. It makes so much sense. I've been so blind, all these years. And I'm so very sorry for not believing you. I owe you so many apologies."
He thought maybe Tony had figured at least some of it out, because Tony had stared up at him in unmitigated awe while delicately petting the edge of the shield and then asked him twice if he was serious.
, Tiberius had sneered.
"It's okay," Steve said, hurriedly, "it's all okay. Here, let me get that IV out for you--"
"A brand new day," Steve echoed, and he reached up and took Tony's hand in his and, yeah, Tony could live with that.
The offer of reprieve didn't seem to be what Steve wanted; Steve just shook his head. "No, I'm okay. I said I'd help, and I'll help."
"No, no! You don't need to do that. Really, you don't need to bring him into it." The words are awkward in Steve's mouth, and he wonders how Iron Man isn't sick of him yet. Iron Man spends so much time around Mr. Stark, after all; surely he must expect someone more suave than Steve?
"Good, good," Tony says, softly. "Now come here."
"I'll just go," Steve said, still miserable, turning back toward the door. "You can forget about the box. Burn it. Crush it. Melt it down. Whatever makes you happy. I don't need it."
"No, it's fine," Tony said. He couldn't really bring himself to care. People had definitely believed even flimsier stories from him. "Just let me know how many photos there are of me being strapped to a gurney in only my underwear."
There was probably a good explanation. Maybe they'd just crashed the party.
Sure, Tony had a point. It made logical sense, when Steve worked it out. All the parts followed. He could see why Tony believed it. Tony liked logic. But it just didn't feel like the right thing to do. Steve didn't know how relationships worked where Tony came from, but where Steve came from, the bare minimum of being in a relationship with someone was not broadcasting unsubstantiated murder allegations about them as the top story on your cable news channel.
Oh. He really thinks Steve cares about a few scars? Clearly so.
"On me," Steve mouths silently, and he steps onto the floor. Behind him, Tony's footsteps are as silent as they can be -- which isn't very silent, because this isn't a stealth armor -- and the door creaks closed.
"I know," Tony says, softly. "I know." Tony's still shaking, even in the armor. "I actually don't have all that much more in me right now," he adds, like it's paining him to admit. "And I know it's not quite over yet. You think you can do all the talking when SHIELD gets up here?"
No. Tony can't do this. He
-- but still. "I don't think you have a lot of time to take me up on it."
fifth metacarpals." Oh, Hank had had some words for him about that one.
Ghost disappears.
He was going to solve this. This was just like any puzzle. He was good at puzzles. He could solve this one too.
That was all very sweet, and it did go a long way to making Steve feel better, but that couldn't be right, could it? Tony had definitely loved Tiberius first. He'd said so. Steve frowned. "You can't have," he said. "It was him. Wasn't it?"
?" Shocked, Steve couldn't help the echo that tumbled out of his mouth.
"Oh, good," Steve said, groggily. "Think I might."
"You are," Steve says, with absolute sincerity.
Iron Man's breath is loud, ragged. "You can't mean that," he says. It could be a fight, but Iron Man's not fighting, not the way he says it. He says it like he desperately wants to believe it.
"Is that okay?" Tony panted out, and he started to lift his hand away, like he was worrying Steve didn't like it.
"I just," Tony said, hesitantly. "I just thought I saw Ru over there."
Tony has already said yes. Steve just wants him to say yes again, because, well, this is another one of those new things. He'd like to be sure he has permission.
Steve frowns. "He couldn't go to a doctor?" Wouldn't Mr. Stark want his own bodyguard to have the best care money could buy?
"Sixty-seven years," he breathes. He holds out one hand in front of him. Turns it over. "I don't look old," he marvels. "I don't feel old." Tony knows Steve is probably wondering if it's the serum. He also knows that this Steve isn't going to volunteer anything about the existence of the serum.
"Yes and no," Tony said. It seemed to Steve like there shouldn't have been any room for equivocation there. "It wasn't really up to me." He took a breath. "Okay. So there were two heart attacks, total. The first one happened when Whiplash hit me with that lightning. I passed out in the suit, fell out of the sky, smacked into the pavement in the middle of Miami. It was a great night." He smiled sadly. Steve stared at him in horror. "Sometimes I wonder if this was why it all turned out the way it did." Tony sounded contemplative. "My armor came alive, and the first thing it felt was my pain. Imagine you've never felt anything at all, anything in your entire life, and the first thing you feel is a heart attack."
Steve couldn't think about that right now. He had no idea what he would tell Tony. He was too jittery and restless to settle down and think. But he had a few hours. And right now he just needed to calm down. Collect himself. Regroup. Prepare.
The shield rattles against two walls of the upper corner behind Steve, to his left, then flies across the room, sinking as it heads down toward the opposite corner on the far end of the room, diagonally tracing out the hypotenuse of an imaginary triangle whose sides are the walls and floor. His shield's spinning so fast that it's barely more than a silvery blur.
is the one who's prepared. "And there's probably some oil in the top drawer there." He rolls onto his back and throws an arm in the vague direction of the nightstand. "You'll be able to tell which bottle is the appropriate lube. Don't worry." He's grinning in earnest now.
Tony froze. "Why he didn't--
would be, these days. "You don't have to work for Mr. Stark if you're just doing it for the paycheck. I can help you out. I can make your life easier, if you'll let me."
Tony nuzzles his cheek. "Do I look like I'm being coerced?" he asks. "I like when I can be good to you. I like when I'm... what you need."
Tony gave a soft chuckle, and when Steve turned to look at him, he was smiling -- smiling in a way Steve might have even called
Steve should have known what to say. He should have had some Captain America speech ready for this moment, something eloquent, with well-chosen words, the sort of speech that would reassure Tony that he had every confidence in him. Instead, his mind was empty of all thought. His hands were trembling.
Also, Jesus, he's so hard he can't think of anything else.
. Oh, no.
Of course. Of course Tiberius had done that. Goddammit.
"Shellhead, what's the matter?" Steve asks. "Come here."
"Are you," he chokes out. He can hardly speak. "Are you leaving me?"
"Something wrong, Cap?" Hank asked.
There had to be something. There had to be. He wasn't giving up.
, Tony. This is what I meant. I'll back you all the way. You're an Avenger. It doesn't matter what lies they print. They're wrong. I trust you. And I want you on the team. There's no one else I'd rather have at my side. It's as simple as that. Okay?"
The gratitude in Tony's eyes was, frankly, heartbreaking. That was probably not the word Steve should have used. "I'm not," he said, and Steve breathed out. "Not anymore. The new heart took care of that. And as far as I can tell, it's going to keep taking care of it. It got that right."
if Tony were in danger. He wouldn't have to try too hard with that one at all. And Steve was the only person, he would bet, who knew Tony was doing this in the first place.
"I don't think he's my date," Steve said, trying to smile, trying to make a joke of it, trying to ignore the awful ache in his chest when he said it. "But he sure did leave me for another man, all right."
Tony licks his lips. "I've never really had a choice before," he says, softly. "Not about this. But if I get a choice, then I pick you."
Nine a.m. was happy hour somewhere. And if it wasn't, who the fuck cared?
He doesn't think he does anything different but Tony must sense it in the way he holds himself, because Tony slides his thumb over Steve's cheekbone like it's a reward. "There you go," Tony says, his voice infinitely gentle. "There you go. Just like that. You feel so good. You're doing such a good job. A perfect job."
"So you say." Tony's face was still flushed. "So, no," he concluded, on a sigh. "You don't smell like him all." Tony didn't seem to want to say his name. Steve didn't blame him. "These days he's wearing Clive Christian No. 1," he added, which meant nothing to Steve but clearly meant something to Tony. "The bottle's got eighteen-karat gold and an actual five-carat diamond on it. Costs a fortune. He spends a whole lot of money on that kind of stuff. He'd probably bathe in the blood of virgins if he could get away with it." Tony's nose was wrinkled in distaste. "He's... showy. Conspicuous. Wants everyone to know he has more money than God. He's always been like that. You probably noticed. That's not-- I'm not like that. You know I'm not like that. And I don't like that. I've never liked that. I'd never, ever confuse you with him. And I'd much, much rather be with you. I've-- I've always wanted you. Always."
