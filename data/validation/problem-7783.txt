Tony leaned back, pulling the man’s uniform down till the heavy fabric pooled at his feet. He helped Steve step out of his boots and suit then, leaving him standing there in just the pale blue panties. “Lovely,” Tony breathed, taking a step back to admire Steve.
“But Obi,” Tony retorted, eyes fiery then. “That creature is hurt, he needs-”
They did not say a word as they reveled in their bond, their closeness unparalleled. They knew in their hearts and minds the hardships and challenges that would come their way. But Tony and Steve knew that they would have each other.
“Alright,” Tony said, looking at the blonde. Along with Steve’s PTSD and Tony’s anxiety, they both knew about each other being plagued with nightmares. “If you change your mind though, you’re welcome to the bed as well. I promise I am not a bed hog,” he said with a chuckle.
“Well, one quick call, would probably brighten the man’s day. You know he hates those meetings.” Steve knew she was right. He and Tony had only texted each other a few times since he had left. The lack of contact was killing Steve, and he felt it was killing Tony too. He checked the time; it was 9:30pm in New York. So it was 6:30pm in California where Tony’s meetings were. If he waited till 11pm or so, Tony should be done with his meetings and finished with dinner by then.
“I love you too, Steve.” And man, did he truly mean it. Seeing Steve smile back at him showed how much the man knew it too.
“I understand you,” Steve said, his voice extremely soft. He brought his hands to his laps, clasping them and looking down reticently. The man stared at him in awe, mouth agape when Steve spoke.
Sitting up some, Tony looked at Steve with a shocked and elated expression. Steve's oxygen mask was off, and the blonde smiled tiredly, his blue eyes still sparkling though. "Hi Tony," Steve said, his voice raspy.
“That sounds like a great idea,” Steve remarked once he forced himself to pay attention.
Once Tony quieted, his hips finally stilling did Steve pull off of the brunette’s spent penis, his lips making a faint ‘pop’ as he did so. The super soldier gently cleaned Tony’s softening length, any residue of precome wiped away with Steve’s pink tongue.
I finally after a million years figured out how to embed an image! Here is a sketch request I had done by K-atnight on tumblr!
Steve watched Tony pinch his nipples in between his fingers, tugging at them and causing them to turn a deeper shade of pink. He held a hand in Tony’s hair gently, pushing his ass back in search for the man’s cock. “Want you, Tony,” Steve moaned, closing his eyes then as the brunette stilled his hands on his chest.
Thank you to my beta who had to deal with all my self doubt and continued to encourage me.
“Oh, God,” Steve breathed, pushing back and wishing Tony would quit being such a tease. “Please, Tony.”
“That’s gotta be a steelhead, huh?” Tony questioned, eyeing up that gigantic fish. It was a beautiful one, its body filled with colorful lines of greens, pinks and blues.
“Captain America...Steve Rogers,” Fury began, standing and walking around the desk to face Tony. “The man doesn’t know anyone in this day and age...” The director explained. “Thought you might be able to be someone he could talk to. Being Howard’s son, someone Rogers used to know.
“A lover’s quarrel is never an easy on,” the janitor said, adjusting his glasses and putting the broom into his rolling cart. “Best go get back in his good graces.” Tony exhaled loudly, moving out of the closet and closing the door.
“Uh huh, sure Steve,” she replied, unconvinced. “I have eyes, you know.” Natasha was always so damn observant, of course she could see Steve’s helpless pining.
And then, as the pain of his injury worsened, and his strength began to fade, and the seamen closed in, a masculine voice called out amongst the chaotic shouting around him. Steve was afraid, but the presence of that dark-haired man, with large eyes that showed genuine concern seemed to ease the utter fear that twisted in his chest.
Steve gave a few more gentle tugs to his reddening nipples before letting go and leaning out of camera shot. Tony’s brows rose, confused as to what Steve was doing. He understood, though, when he saw Steve holding a bottle of their lube in his hand. Steve flipped open the cap, squirting an exuberant amount of the lubricant on his fingers. Tony would love some of that right now, he had to admit.
"This is my choice, Tony. Being with you is the biggest gift I have ever received. You being my soulmate, and you
“Good, and I really liked doing that to you,” he said, combing his fingers into Steve’s damp hair.
That night, Steve went to bed wearing a lingerie garment Tony had given him before he had left. It was a wonderful light grey nightie with a combed cotton, jersey knit bodice that molded over his chest perfectly. The skirt of the gown was a wonderful silky, soft pink that billowed voluminously down to the blonde’s upper knees. Not only did the lingerie look absolutely stunning on Steve, but it also was a friendly reminder to super solder to not get caught up with worry about Tony’s love for him. How could he even humor the idea that Tony had fallen out of love with him when he had given Steve such a wonderful gift.
“Oh, Tony,” Pepper started, folding her arms across her chest. “I ended things because you couldn’t give me your heart. Because you don’t see where your heart truly lies, where it will always lie,” she reiterated from their last conversation. “Don’t you dare try to turn the tables on me.” She stared him down, her blue eyes fierce.
Tony’s eyes were locked onto the sight of Steve cleaning him up with his pretty pink tongue. “So perfect, Steve,” Tony murmured, lifting a hand to comb it through Steve’s damp blonde hair. “Just like that.” He could feel Steve shudder when Tony guided his head over a new spot of wet release on his chest. Tony had been storing these little quirks about Steve in his mind for a while now, the way the super soldier tended to fall into a pattern of obedience during their play time. It was definitely a conversation they needed to have later.
“Yeah, sure sure, I’ll have my people call your people,” Tony remarked to the man who was still talking like his life depended on it. With that, Tony moved through the crowd of black suits and expensive gowns as he headed towards the blonde. He couldn’t help but smile as he neared the man, seeing Steve in a dapper uniform, wearing his medals as he sported his hair in an old-fashioned style was enough to make even Tony’s belly flop with nerves.
“Mhmm,” Steve answered, leaning up to suckle on the underside of Tony’s chin.
“Hey, Stevie,” Tony said, leaning in for a quick kiss before swiveling his chair so he could face his boyfriend. “I see you got your Easter basket.” He took in the sight of Steve in the new lingerie garment, his eyes taking in every fine detail. Steve stared at Tony the whole time, watching the man’s reactions as he perused over Steve’s frame. He took the initiative to turn around so Tony could see the back, and when he heard the brunette take in a sharp breath, Steve smiled proudly. He had hoped for that reaction. It was only a moment before he felt Tony’s hands on his bare back, slowly trailing them down to his waistline.
“Uh-uhn,” Steve rushed out in almost a whine, cupping a hand over his mouth immediately. He was pretty sure Nick heard him, though.
“Yeah, just a little,” Steve replied, the heat in his belly coiling at the thought of how much he was pleasing Tony, and they hadn’t even gotten to the love making yet. “You know I like your touch back there, though.” Steve said as Tony stood up. “So it’s really a win-win for both of us.” Tony nodded to that, his hands massaging each of Steve’s ass cheeks with calloused hands before he nudged his beloved boyfriend towards the bedroom.
“I only wish to give you all that you deserve,” Tony admitted and Steve could detect a hint of sorrow in the man’s voice. Steve knew Tony struggled with the fear of never being good enough. It made Steve’s heart ache knowing it was because of Tony’s childhood mostly that scarred him so heavily. Steve dragged a thumb across the pink pillow of Tony’s bottom lip, the brunette closing his eyes at the affectionate touch.
“This is new, for both of us,” Steve started, looking down a moment. “But I’ve never been with anyone.
It took Steve a moment to come to, the feeling coming back to his body. He saw Tony smiling at him cheekily, as if he was holding back a laugh.
Natasha laid her head on Steve’s shoulder, taking a big breath in.
Steve came hard, ropes of white shooting out, only to hit the mirror in front of him. Tony continued to pump his fingers inside him, but with less fervor than before. His fingers were gentle then, caressing Steve’s loose hole, allowing the muscle to clench around them delicately as the waves of Steve’s orgasm calmed. He laid against the man for a few minutes, feeling the cool metal casing of the arc reactor pressed against his skin.
Yeah, ‘cause maybe then you’d want me just as much
With a heavy sigh, Tony looked up at the ceiling, as if it would hold the insight he needed. Putting himself in Steve’ shoes, he could see how his actions would have made Steve feel as if Tony wanted nothing to do with him. Especially because they confided in each other about a lot of things. It would have made anyone feel a sense of self-doubt, even Steve. He needed to make things right with him, to apologize. Not for their argument, because he was still miffed about Steve being reckless. But for making the man feel like Tony didn’t want to be around him and for being so distant. Even if Tony had good intentions for it, that didn’t change how he made Steve feel.
“Hey, at least I’m not 100 years old.”
It was Steve who began their cadence once again, shifting his hips and clenching his thighs as he lifted himself up, only to slide back down onto the man he loved.
“So, what cars did you work on back in the day?” Tony asked as he cranked a spark plug loose.
“Please fuck me,” The blonde whispered, eyes falling closed as he begged his lover to appease him. Tony grinned and answered by lining his heavy erection with Steve’s hole. Instead of slipping inside the other man though, the genius tapped his length against the blonde’s entrance teasingly, watching Steve’s body wink and flutter, desiring to be filled.
Six Weeks Since the Injury
“Yes, uhn-Tony,” Steve cried out, taking all that Tony gave him. It was only a few more thrusts and strokes from Tony when Steve’s body arched back, hole clenching around Tony’s arousal, fist tightening in the man’s hair.
“Will you lay on your stomach for me, babe?” The brunette cooed, his hands reaching slightly beneath the waistband of Steve’s panties, squeezing at the super soldier’s bum. The blonde abided, humming gleefully as he turned over, rump up in the air rather temptingly.
Steve closed his eyes as Tony kissed his body, knowing Steve’s sweet spots like a memorized equation. The super soldier leaned over and placed a sweet kiss on Tony’s dark, slightly disheveled hair, breathing in the masculine scent of his love. Steve more than wished to be able to hold Tony, to touch him with loving, tender fingers. But he knew his boyfriend really wanted his wrists to stay retrained, and the blonde was happy to do that for the genius. Steve knew that there wasn’t a single soul that he trusted more than Tony, especially when it came to giving someone control over him.
But as the blonde straightened his posture once more he found himself to be rather light headed and nauseous. He held his head in his hand and tried to take a few deep breaths. Natasha saw him there looking woozy.
His boyfriend’s moans were muffled, and Steve lifted his head a brief moment to get a glimpse of Tony biting the cushion, his forehead pressed to the back of couch, eyes shut tight. Steve nibbled at Tony’s entrance a few more times, brushing his wet teeth along it before moving back and standing to his feet, legs shaky.
“You’re obviously gonna dump me,” the brunette said, exasperated, as if it was obvious what Steve was trying to do by video chatting out of the blue.
All of the Avengers knew Steve was upset, knew why the super soldier sulked around all week and moped like Eeyore when he loses his tail. The headlines were everywhere;
“J.A.R.V.I.S?” Steve called to the A.I.
“Steve, you gotta switch the screen, I just saw your face the whole time.”
“Yes, Steven?” Tony said casually while he continued to knead at the other pec and nipple with his fingers, rasping a nail over that glorious pink bud.
“Hey,” he whispered to Tony, smiling kindly at him. “I get it, I understand your worries and concerns, my love,” Steve said. “But I trust you, Tony. I know you would never hurt me. You are too selfless to think of yourself before others.” The genius gave a shaky breath. “Look at me, Tony,” Steve requested quietly. The brunette finally did then, and the blonde continued on. “I promise if you do anything I don’t like or am not okay with, I will say ‘lavender.’ Alright?”
After a pause, Tony put lube on the next two beads that were a bit bigger than the first. With a hand on Steve’s hip, his palm moving over the blonde’s warm skin, Tony pushed the second and then the third bead into Steve’s body. It wasn’t until the fourth bead that Tony could feel a bit of resistance as he guided it into his love.
“Now I’m even more nervous than before,” Steve mumbled bending down a little so she could reach his hair with more ease.
Once they were in the tower, Tony set the blonde down and stepped out of the Iron Man suit, still wearing his dress clothes. Steve didn’t hesitate to wrap his arms around Tony and pull him flush against his chest, looking down dotingly at the brunette. “Have I told you that I love you lately?” Steve asked, kissing Tony lightly on his nose, causing the brunette to giggle.
When his boyfriend switched up his strokes and angled his hips, Steve could feel the swollen tip of the man’s penis nudge against his prostate, making white lightning surge through every fiber of his being. The overall sensation from both his and Tony’s hands, as well as the man’s large cock was overwhelming, everything heightened and sensitive.
“S’good,” Steve managed to whimper, his hands grabbing at the pillow he held, twisting the poor fabric tightly, the seams pulled taut. The brunette could see all the tension in his lover’s body, the way his shoulders shook, how his thighs clenched and abdomen rolled against the cushions under his hips. Tony knew Steve was fully aroused once more.
Whatever invisible barrier that had made Steve nervous dissipated then, the blonde hurrying to the door and maneuvering the baskets in his hands so that he could punch in his authorization code. When the door unlocked he pushed his way into the heavy drum bass of what would be now called classic rock. He made his way to his love, placing the baskets on a semi clean work table before hovering over Tony and peering his head down till it was blocking the man’s view of the suit piece. He, unintentionally, startled Tony who flinched and looked up at him, a charming smile breaking out on his face, his round, chocolatey eyes crinkling at the corners.
When 7pm rolled around, Steve took the subway to Brooklyn once more, finding the apartment complex that was listed on Tony’s letter. He quirked an eyebrow, pushing open the glass door and making his way into the lobby.
“You know I do,” the super soldier assured him, placing a hand affectionately over where Tony’s fingers had stopped on Steve’s tricep. God, how that made Tony’s heart flip with fondness, hearing Steve’s pure love and trust he had in Tony. How honored it had the genius feeling. With little direction, Tony maneuvered Steve till the blonde was sitting, straddling Tony’s chest, his back to the brunette.
Tony could see Steve inching back against him, wishing for his finger to breach his rim and begin filling him up. The genius decided to give the man what he wanted, pressing part of second finger into the super soldier easily. Tony grinned at the inhaled gasp Steve took at the sudden pressure, his hole clenching around it.
But as Steve got older, technology and science progressed, especially during the turn of the century the idea of soulmates and soul bonds were seen as medieval or rather juvenile. If there was nothing to prove such bonding energy existed, how could it be so?
Continuing on then, Tony pushed the sixth bead into Steve, who sighed at the now pleasurable pressure within him. He could feel the toy now deeper in his channel, the ecstasy building up the coil in his belly. His erection was fully swelled, the white precome seeping from the fat mushroom tip.
“Given your fancy sunglasses and your New Yorker accent, pretty obvious,” Jerry laughed lightly. “But you both look like those Avenger guys,” he added, looking to Tony, handing him and Steve their bags of goods.
“Want you too, love,” Tony breathed as he licked the underside of both of Steve’s pectorals, making another love bite on the super soldier’s chest, this time biting that velvety nipple. Steve arched his back when the brunette’s teeth sunk into the firm muscle and hardened flesh, his voice a raspy cry as he felt his body fall apart. His orgasm seemed to come out of nowhere, though by the way Tony touched and kissed him, the blonde wasn’t all that surprised. Steve’s mind floated, his muscles one by one relaxing back into their natural state, his breathing fighting to even out.
“Yes, Tony,” Steve replied, looking back the best he could to see his wrists tied beautifully, the red bow’s satiny fabric loosely tied so the blonde’s wrists would not chafe too much.
“Hey, Steve,” Bruce greeted with a small wave, clasping his hands in front of him then.
“Steve, come for me, baby. Please,” Tony rushed out as he started stroking himself once more, his finger inside him pushing in and out.
Still, that didn’t mean he loved him romantically. It was a strong bond between friends. Which was why when he saw that beast snap its jaws shut around Steve, his stomach dropped and his chest became tight. He thought he was about to lose someone else near and dear to him. He couldn’t believe Steve had done that. Well, that wasn’t true, the man jumped out of quinjets and planes without parachutes. Yet, Tony felt entirely helpless in that moment, as he hovered in the air, just watching. It was only when Steve was falling that Tony refocused, flying down as fast as he could to catch the man. He wasn’t sure if Steve realized it, but it had been a close one. With the blonde’s weight and momentum, he just about took Tony down with him when he caught him.
Steve thought he forgot to breathe, inhaling sharply when he heard approaching footsteps behind him. He turned abruptly, seeing Tony leaning in against the threshold of the doorway.
“How bad is it, Doc?” Tony asked with an easy smile as Bruce laughed lightly, securing the cotton tourniquet with a pin.
Tony was absolutely beside himself as he neared the edge. He was reclined in the chair now, his head slumped forward as he gazed at Steve. He’d only looked away when the beauty of Steve giving him wonderful, wet bliss became too much, and he closed his eyes, steadying himself.
Stepping into the bedroom, heart pounding and cheeks flushed, Steve found Tony sitting on the bed, the top buttons of his white dress shirt undone, his shoes and socks off. He had his head down, looking at his phone, a few dark strands of hair shading his big brown eyes.
"What was so special about that statue," Tony inquired after a moment. Steve felt a bit of embarrassment waft over him again, but he quelled it as much as he could.
He heard Tony say “so good,” over and over before Steve felt the man’s lips kissing up his spine, settling on the nape of his neck. That was what seemed to drag him down to earth, all of his beloved’s languid kisses. Steve turned his head, opening his eyes to see Tony smiling down at him, petting his sweaty blonde hair.
Opening the sleek grey box, he had discreetly placed in there before he and Tony went out, Steve rifled through the tissue paper to pull out a silky fabric, light as air. It was a deep purple slip, made for men but still feminine and delicate in appeal. An inch black lace trim embellished the slip around the sweetheart neckline and hem. Slipping the fabric over his head, Steve let it fall around his taut and muscular frame, the hem swishing gently against his upper thighs. The garment also came with a pair of panties the same purple silk as the slip, a small black satin bow nestled at the back of the waistline. He turned to see himself in the large mirror by the porcelain sink, taking in the hard contours of his muscles and how it balanced with the beautiful soft fabric that draped over them. He couldn’t help but smile at how he looked, the fabric barely covering over the plush curve of his bum.
“My mother would tell me about the stars.” Steve said, wistfully. “My favorite tale was of two stars in particular. Those two, right there,” Steve explained, looking to Tony before pointing up and slightly to the left of where they sat. “She told me that those were the souls of two warriors from hundreds of years ago,” Steve said, smiling lightly at the memory. “You see, they were both from rival clans, Brayan was from the East, and Ferris from the West. When there was threat of foreign invaders, though, the men had come together, joining forces and becoming inseparable friends. They fought side by side, protecting all those who were defenseless against the attackers.” Steve looked to Tony who was just watching the blonde intently.
After he was dressed, Steve exited the bathroom to allow the steam to escape. Grabbing the sketchbook in his suitcase, the super soldier headed to the desk to have a seat. He wanted to sketch the creek they were fishing at earlier. Tony got off the phone shortly after, not saying a word, hearing him enter the bathroom then. Maybe he did make the man upset when he walked out in his towel. Steve tried not to take it to heart or think about it too much, he’d done that enough over that month of Tony being distant. He focused on his sketch instead, starting with the beautiful oak and maple trees that lined the far side of the creek.
“Oh, okay,” Steve replied. “Did you want to talk about anything?” Tony just shook his head with a neutral smile.
“I am beyond happy that you are home with me now,” Steve spoke after a brief silence, the streaks of sunlight shifting on the bed, the curtains swishing gently from the air conditioner kicking on.
With the muscle of Steve’s opening loose and wet, Tony hooked his tongue roughly inside the super soldier, the hand that was working at his perineum reaching further to grasp Steve’s arousal, stroking the shaft quickly.
“I think you’ll love it even more here in a moment,” Steve said once he lapped up every last bit of the chocolate on Tony’s chest. He smiled cheekily, peering down at the brunette before he removed the man’s damp boxers. Grabbing up the bottle once again, Steve poured chocolate sauce underneath Tony’s navel and upper thighs, only to then drizzle some on the man’s erect penis.
“God I’ve just missed you so damn much, my love,” Steve breathed, his chest heaving as he gazed upon his boyfriend. The super soldier trailed his hands over Tony’s arc reactor and to his chest, thumbing at the man’s ruddy nipples as he spoke.
“You’re afraid that you’re going to get rejected. Tony Stark, possibly getting shot down,” Rhodey smirked. Tony only glared at him before throwing a balled up napkin at the other man. “Come on, Tony. Ask him. What’s the worst that could happen?”
Once they were in Queens, the creature was still on a rampage. If Loki was supposedly dead, Steve wondered who could be behind this.
But how they were now, having Tony comfortably warm against him, Steve could feel a need begin to blossom deep within his belly.
“What is it?” She asked softly, drifting one slender finger under Tony’s chin before gently raising his head until his chestnut eyes met her blue ones. She smiled sweetly, reassuringly. It was a smile that Tony was once rather familiar with, once reserved only for him.
He was moaning? Tony hadn’t even realized those noises were his own. “Come on, Steve, play with yourself. Wanna see you touch all of those beautiful muscles of yours,” Tony challenged, smearing the precome around his swollen tip. He knew Steve loved when he did that during sex. He noticed a fine sheen of sweat beginning to glisten on Steve’s body as the man took his other hand and started to fondle his testicles, squeezing and pulling at the sac while stroking himself quickly. He watched Steve’s head fall back against the pillows that propped him up, his mouth parted, eyes shut as he just felt the sensations of his own hands.
“Gorgeous,” Tony whispered. “You’re just so perfect.” And Steve, through all his heated lust and arousal blushed at the compliment. Steve reached a hand up to guide Tony down against him, loving the feel of the arc reactor against his own chest.
"And it is my oath to you, Tony," Steve whispered, his voice filled with emotion. "My soulmate."
“Uhn, T-Tony,” Steve moaned sweetly, his free hand moving to pinch and pluck at one of his pert nipples, his fingernail scraping the bud, making the blonde bite his lip.
That following morning there was an Avengers training session that Tony clearly forgot about as he strolled into their gym with a mug, the mug Steve gave him, full of coffee.
“Alright, what’s up with you man?” Rhodey asked him, taking a bite of his burger.
“He goes for the gusto with everything he does,” Steve replied with a light laugh as he peered at his other friends across the room. He heard Tony hum in agreement watching the others as well.
They stayed like that briefly, Tony still in Steve’s lap, their arms warped around each other, relishing in their loving touches. Steve started things up again though, his hands finding their way down to the hem of Tony’s shirt, his fingers slipping underneath to trail light touches up Tony’s taut back. He pulled the fabric over the brunette’s head, leaving him bare chested as well, the cool glow of the arc reactor illuminating their frames.
Steve had never felt anything quite like this before. Even when he and Peggy kissed, it wasn’t the same as this, what he was doing with Tony now. Everything about their kiss was tender and sweet, affectionate sighs or a soft moan escaping them as they focused on each other.
“Sam stopped here to tell you that his last lead on Barnes turned up empty,” she said sadly, and Steve couldn’t hide his disappointment.
Steve was beside himself with pleasure, though he wished Tony would relent and breach him fully with his tongue. He could feel the man hum, the vibration against his skin making the blonde release a strangled whine. Steve felt his boyfriend take hold of his hips then, wrenching Steve back, burying his face between his cheeks and finally sheathing his tongue within the blonde. The warm slickness of it brushed along his channel walls, Tony’s lips nudged against his wet rim.
Tony could feel Steve’s desperation after a moment, the blonde meeting Tony’s strokes a bit frantically.
They laid there a while longer, both too spent to move or clean themselves up. Steve finally moved, lifting his head to look at Tony’s slackened features, his swollen lips parted, eyes gently shut. When he went to pull away, they both hissed, their skin sticking together from both Steve’s come and the residue from the chocolate on Tony’s chest. Once Steve peeled himself off of his love did they both laugh tiredly.
“It’s a rather calming hobby once you get the hang of it,” Bruce explained while opening a gift from Thor.
“Alright,” Steve said, burrowing into the soft cotton fabric. I’ll be sure not to wake you when I come in,” he added before watching the genius enter the house quietly, so not to wake the other guests.
“It will be,” he agreed, nestling his cheek in against Tony’s and holding him close. “You’re amazing,” he whispered, and he meant it entirely. Tony was one of the best things in his life, and he’d be sure to remind the man of it every single day.
“Have a good night, Tony,” he offered, before turning on his heel and disappearing down the hallway. There was a fresh ache of sorrow and disappointment that swirled in Steve’s belly, mixing with the butterflies that perpetually fluttered there when he was with Tony, even while they fought.
(See the end of the chapter for
The days had come and gone, and soon enough, it was Christmas Eve, the city still bustling with merriment and festive decorations. Steve was in his quarters, wrapping the last of the small gifts he got for his teammates. Religious opinions aside, all of them agreed that exchanging gifts Christmas morning would be a nice gesture towards the normal life they wished they had, or used to have.
Tony laid in bed that night, the glass of scotch he brought with him still full as it sat on his bed side table. He was wide awake, eyes open and staring at the ceiling as he mulled over all of Pepper’s words. He couldn’t wrap his mind around the fact that she believed he loved Steve. It was preposterous! They were good friends, both of them straight. How could something blossom between them? It wasn’t possible.
“Oh, I guess you hadn’t told her yet,” Tony added.
It took a minute for Tony to respond, his head swimming with heated lust. “Umm, no it’ll be fine. C’mon Steve, want your tongue on me,” he said, shimmying on the couch a little. The blonde smiled, uncapping the bottle and slowly pouring it, the chocolate sliding out and falling onto Tony’s chest in long linear patterns as Steve moved it around. When he felt there was enough coating the genius’s defined torso did Steve put the bottle aside, leaning back down to lap at the chocolate.
“You like it, don’t you, love?” Tony said, his breath puffing against Steve’s skin. Tony sucked at the skin once more, breaking the blood vessels to give Steve a love hickey on a bum cheek. He glided his hands up the backside of Steve’s thighs as the blonde held his knees to his chest, being so good for Tony before he went to work giving equal attention to Steve’s other cheek. He bit at it, pulling at the skin with his teeth, relishing in every obscenely gorgeous sound his blonde lover was making above him. “Yeah, yeah you do like this. Like how easily I can take you apart Steve.”
“I bet she’s beautiful,” Steve said, a small pout on his lips.
“What’s this?” Tony asked in interest, lifting the garment up completely to reveal Steve’s lingerie panties. “Well what do we have here?” The brunette took in how the purple silky fabric strained from Steve’s growing erection, a damp spot forming from the leaking head. “Aren’t you just full of surprises tonight,” Tony said with a wink, tracing a finger over the curve of the man’s aroused penis still hidden under the fabric. Steve gasped, hips stuttering forward for more friction. “I think you should keep this slip on while I fuck you tonight,” Tony stated, looking up at Steve. “Would you like that?”
“So, what’d you get,” Bruce asked Tony, sidling up to the genius out of nowhere. Startled, Tony looked to the quiet scientist, clutching the box like a vice to his chest.
“Nope. Not when your tongue’s deep inside me,” Steve said lowly, smirking at Tony then. The brunette laughed, patting Steve’s bum before turning toward the door.
“Yes,” Steve said immediately, grabbing the bottle up and looking at it. “I want to put it on you though, if that’s alright.” It was such a sexy thing to do, he thought, to worship Tony this way, to love him this way. He wanted to taste the man’s skin laced with sweet chocolate, the thought alone making his already hard erection ache.
Tony had drove them to a quaint Bed and Breakfast a few miles south from where they were fishing. “I had J.A.R.V.I.S reserve two rooms for us,” Tony said, pulling onto the dirt road that led to the farmhouse style home.
I got a girl crush
“Okaaay,” Steve said finally, bringing Tony out of his quiet observations.
With Steve making all the beautiful noises above him, Tony went back to work, licking a stripe with the flat of his tongue over the blonde’s opening, holding it there a moment.
“God, Tony,” Steve huffed out as he pushed back, searching for his love’s finger to fill him. “Want you in me,” he choked out, looking back at the brunette with a lusty gaze. And hell, if that look right there didn’t go straight to Tony’s already hard erection. He really couldn’t wait to take Steve, but seeing the man all hot and bothered really made him ache so sweetly. Playing with the man’s rim with the rough pad of his finger, Tony spread Steve’s cheeks with the other hand, watching as his rosy pink hole tried to clench around him.
I want her long blonde hair, I want her magic touch
Tony teased him with little bites to his nipples and muscular pecs before finally kissing up Steve’s neck and to his lips. Steve smiled up at the brunette when Tony hovered over him, feeling so blissed out in that moment. “Since you haven’t been with anyone,” Tony started, licking Steve’s plump bottom lip, his one hand caressing at the blonde’s side, feeling the dips and peaks of his serratus anterior muscles. Steve shook his head, leaning up to nip at his beloved’s lips. “You’ve never experienced a blow job, then?” He grinned cheekily.
Tony considered it a blessing in disguise that there was an urgent matter at the tower. Tony had dreaded going to Steve Rogers's apartment even if he felt bad for the guy. Seeing Steve Rogers, Captain America, standing like a sculpted statue, tall and muscular. He was everything Howard had raved about. Tony wasn’t able to handle that truth as well as he'd expected. Steve rogers, Captain America was what tony was not...was what Howard compared tony to. Captain America, the hero he'd looked up to and loved as a kid was merely just a man, a success story for his father's genius mind.
Every gala event was the same; flashing lights were blinding, fake smiles revealed bleached teeth, and the abhorring small talk was enough to make Tony want to beeline it for the bar every time. He was somewhat used to it all by now, having to attend balls and events like this gave him some form of immunity to the shallow veneer.
"Knocked out cold, Steve," Natasha added. "We've managed to get the docents and other employees of the museum to mark off this room until you were feeling alright."
“Holy shit, Steve. Yes, it’s alright,” Tony replied, slightly annoyed. “Let me feel you, baby.”
“I can think of a few ways that I could assist you with that,” Steve said, pinning Tony between the elevator and his body, kissing him heatedly. He pulled away once the elevator dinged. “I’ll be here waiting for you when you get back. Maybe even wearing that silky slip you love so much,” Steve winked when Tony stepped into the elevator.
“You’re killing me, Steve,” Tony breathed, and the super solider giggled, still teasing at that sweet spot of the brunette’s. He kissed it and suckled at the skin, creating an intense suction. He could hear Tony let out a whimper, his fingers trailing down the flowing chiffon fabric that made up the bodice of the nightie, and slipping his hand underneath. He could feel his lover’s dull nails dig into the muscles of his back, and it only encouraged Steve on, giving a small nip to the purpled flesh before pulling away to admire the love mark.
“Oh, yeah sure,” Tony said, smiling weakly. He wasn’t over Steve saying he was interested in someone. Not just interested, in love with someone. What was he going to do now? Pine silently? No. Tony Stark
Steve wanted to be defiant, to knock this evil man to the ground and figure out his escape. But Steve knew better than to act impulsively in this situation; he couldn’t do much with a wounded hip and revolver to his head. He also couldn’t risk his pod, or the mission he had set out on.
“Yes, but I’m a mess,” Steve countered, pulling back to point to his torso. “And that’s not even mentioning my ass,” he grinned.
“I tried, Sir, but he insists. You were apparently supposed to meet with him today.”
Once more, Steve tried to imagine the toy inside him, nudging closer to his prostate and fitting snuggly against the sensitive walls of his entrance. He thought of how the obscene image of the remaining beads looked hanging from his backside, and Tony looking at all in approval, seeing the blonde absolutely ruined and desperate for more of Tony’s sensuous touches.
“Bend forward some for me baby,” Tony said, his free hand gently pushing between Steve’s shoulder blades, encouraging the super soldier on. “This may be my favorite lingerie number of yours, love,” Tony added softly, his fingers slipping under the eyelet lace straps that clung to the muscles of Steve’s strong shoulders.
“It wasn’t your fault, Pep. I-I just wish I could do something to make you stay. To prove to you how much I love and care about you,” Tony said, his own eyes pleading. He wrapped an arm around her small waist, just needing to have her close, as if that would keep her with him, making her stay.
“Steve, I wanna try a new position,” he suggested. And before Steve could pout, Tony continued. “Just for your second orgasm. I won’t come till I face you, I promise. I just, wanna try something a little different,” Tony said, smiling sweetly at Steve.
Steve's feelings for Tony are getting harder and harder to hold inside.
So, I guess if this story followed the movie timelines... it would kinda take place between Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron.
“You won’t,” she replied quickly, regaining her composure before pulling away slightly from their swaying motions. “I’ll always be your CEO, as well as your dear friend. You’ve always been my family.”
"I think I have a soulmark," the brunette admitted, clasping his hands together and looking away.
Steve, with a happy swirling of anticipation in his chest, headed out toward his living room where Tony was working on some numerical formulas on his Stark Pad. The genius had been busy the last few days with multiple conference calls as well as webinar meetings. So, the blonde decided that this would be a perfect way for his wonderful boyfriend to relax and not worry about things for a while. Plus, with Tony being so preoccupied with work, they didn’t have any romance time, and that needed to change.
Tony smiled faintly, a hand reaching up to brush a snowflake from Steve’s cheek with his thumb. The man’s calloused digit was somehow tender against his warm, blushing skin. He saw Tony open his mouth to speak, only to be interrupted by Natasha scolding her fellow spy in the background.
“You’ve got to go meet with Fury. He’s expecting you.”
“What did you say?” Steve asked weakly. His ears must have been deceiving him. Tony smirked, still cupping his chin.
pine. “She needs her oil changed. Think you can manage that?” Tony forced a chuckle as he got up from the roller seat.
Steve took a pillow in hand, wrapping his arms around it and laying his head in the crook of his elbow, the fabric cool against his heated skin. Each caress was leaving the super soldier keening, but it was when he felt Tony’s tongue graze his opening that Steve thought he was going to lose his mind, his body exploding with tingly goosebumps.
can take the red and gold pole,” Steve started, inspecting the pole he held in his hand like he knew what would make it a decent pole. “But I’ve always wanted to fish. I don’t know, I would hear people talk about it growing up as well as now. And, it just sounds so nice and calming,” Steve explained, looking to Tony then. “Also, since you touched that hat, now you have to wear it while we fish,” Steve teased.
The bow of the massive ship glided through the calm ocean water with ease as the sun rose high in a clear sky. Tony Stark walked along the ship deck, a pile of notes in hand. They were heading back to America, his body and mind more than eager to be back on solid ground. Their trip to Europe was two weeks long, the majority of the time meeting with Hydra Energy, a company that specialized in alternative power and energy creation. The brunette inventor definitely had his reservations about the company that nobody had really known of. It was 1886 however, and America was rather isolated from the rest of the world, so Tony could understand why American companies had not dabbled with this particular business.
Steve breathed quietly, eyes still closed as he felt his boyfriend’s lips and tongue caress his shoulder. He hummed happily, turning his neck the best he could to kiss Tony’s sweat laden temple. “That was nice,” Steve whispered, his voice gruff.
“It sounds like your asthma just emerged from the depths,” Tony commented, and he shifted his hand off of Steve’s inner thigh, only to accidentally hit Steve’s groin in the process. The super soldier let out a small gasp, and he could feel his swelling erection start to become a bit painful.
Steve’s eyes had been closed briefly, and when he opened them, he saw his love watching him, his dewy brown eyes captivating. That look alone was enough to make Steve catch his breath, even after all they had done.
A mermaid, no, a
"It means I have a soulmate too. And I know who it is," Tony explained, pinching the bridge of his nose in frustration.
And that terrified him.
“You’re welcome,” the man responded, the one side of his mouth curving up. “I am sorry for what happened. I still have no idea what their intentions were when they hoisted you out of the sea,” Tony said with a shrug of his shoulders. “But I hate to have you here unsupervised.”
So, wearing his best clothes, because no matter what Steve told himself, he had to look his best for Tony. He unsurprisingly found the man in his lab, looking exhausted.
“This is new,” Steve said in a happy tone, turning his head some more to kiss his love.
“You enjoy that?” Tony asked, his voice a little raspy.
The inventor found his advisor in his quarters, writing fervently when Tony opened the door unannounced.
Steve merely whimpered out a moan, a pathetic, desperate sound as the heated desire roiled within his belly, swarming in his chest like monarchs that had wings of fire.
He chickened out after that though, acting like nothing had happened between him and Steve. He’d seen him since then of course, but he never brought up that moment, and neither did Steve. And so, he let it go. It ate away at Tony though, wanting to just tell Steve the truth, and get the weight of it off his shoulders. It was when Steve was down in his workshop a few days after the snowball fight that Tony knew his time with the man was soon to run out.
“Thank you, Natasha.” And Steve really meant it, looking at her sincerely.
The brunette saw his lover smile naughtily up at him, knowing he was being quite the irresistible tease. “Even with your wrists bound you still manage to catch me off guard,” Tony chuckled, taking a deep breath. Steve only giggled innocently, his smile bright and full of love. Tony snickered too, resting a hand on Steve’s rosy and warm cheek. The genius took a moment to revel in the image of Steve splayed on the sheets, his muscles stretched with his hands bound above him, his chest rising in the anticipation of what was to come.
“Did I do well with picking out this lingerie?” Tony asked softly, using his fingertips to trace random patterns along the silk covering Steve’s rump.
It was Tony who finally pulled away, resting his forehead on Steve’s, catching his breath. “Holy shit, Steve. You’re so fucking lovely,” Tony breathed, a small chuckle escaping him as he drifted a hand into Steve’s hair.
Something had stirred within Tony the night he and Steve shared that bedroom. He didn’t mean to react the way he did, when Steve had walked out of the bathroom in just a towel. In Tony’s defense, anybody would be caught off guard if someone was practically nude and sauntering by. Seriously, that white towel was tiny, the owners of that B and B should really consider getting larger ones.
“You’re my everything,” the blonde whispered, “the man I want to wake up to every morning, and the man I want to hold as we fall asleep together.”  Tony closed his eyes at Steve’s words, a smile on his lips.
Pepper appeared then, opening the glass door with a smile. Lifting his faceplate, Tony greeted her with his own cheeky grin. It was the first time they’d seen each other since the party. And seeing her standing there, her hair unruly from sleep, her eyes puffy from tiredness, she still took his breath away.
Steve latched his hands on the headboard, his body bent in half as Tony maneuvered him however he wanted. His erection leaked steadily as Steve found Tony’s open mouth to kiss him frantically. He clenched his body around Tony, hearing the man huff out a groan, and he rammed into Steve with all his might. Steve moaned with Tony, their voices ringing into a melodic tune of pleasure. Looking between them, Steve watched Tony’s thick length pull out of him, the fat head teasing his loose wet rim a moment, time standing still.
“Mhmm,” Steve mumbled, resting his cheek on Tony’s chest, his muscles and bones feeling like jelly.
“You know you wanna come for me, Steve,” Tony said with a sharp breath, teasing the tight nipples on the other man’s pecs, only to then trial his fingers over to the strap on one of Steve’s shoulders, feeling the soft scratch of the delicate lace under his fingertips. Tony then slid it down till it fell around Steve’s large bicep, the neckline falling with it, and Steve hummed, head tilting back against Tony’s shoulder. He could smell the man’s sandalwood body wash from the late showers Tony often took when he lost track of time down in his lab. It ebbed off his tawny skin in subtle wafts, comforting Steve in ways only Tony could.
“N-nothing. I’m fine,” Steve said, his breathing a little winded.
“You’re so beautiful,” Tony said softly, his eyes large and gleaming as he looked at his love. Steve could feel all the love and adoration Tony had for him in that gaze of his. Steve sealed his lips with the brunette, his eyes shutting tightly, feeling the sensation of their mouths meshing and their tongues glazing over the other. He barely felt the genius’s hand trail down his back and to his bum until the man squeezed the super soldier’s bum. Steve hummed delightedly, brushing his cheek against Tony’s as he wiggled under his beloved’s hand.
Steve wakes up in a room alone only to be surprised by a meeting from Tony.
“Soon, love. Soon, and you’ll be screaming my name while I fuck you,” Tony replied, almost growling predatorily as he nuzzled in the crook of Steve’s neck, kissing it and nipping at the thick tendon. Steve made a pleasant sound at that, tilting his neck for easier access.
“I guess so,” the blonde woman said, looking up at him. “Speaking of trust, and honesty, I’ll admit my name isn’t Kate,” she chuckled then, extending her hand. “My name is Sharon, Sharon Carter.” Steve went to shake her hand with a warm smile. Her last name struck him then, and he paused their handshake midway.
“How come?” And he shrugged. “Steve,” she said in an authoritative tone before standing back, happy with his appearance finally.
“I wasn’t being self-righteous,” Steve countered, taking a step closer to Tony, his defenses rising even higher. Tony held his gaze, the man’s brown eyes, usually warm and comforting, now harsh and unwavering.
“Wait,” Tony stopped him before the man put the fish back into the stream. Reaching for his phone in the pocket of his waders, Tony opened the camera. “Say cheese!” Steve did just that, holding the fish up and beaming a pearly smile. Tony snapped the shot, looking at it in approval before putting his phone away. “Told you, this one had to be one for the books.”
Steve and Tony froze, staring wide eyed at each other like deer in the headlights before coming to their senses and bolting to wash the evidence of their tryst from the table.
Steve looked down to see Tony’s tight fist around his penis, and when he bit into his behind, Steve’s body hummed with lust. Tony kept stroking him, nipping at his other ass cheek before moving the panties down to his ankles. Steve bucked his hips into Tony’s fist only to pull back and be met with Tony’s tongue licking up the fissure of his rump. Steve’s knees bowed out from the sudden pleasure of it. Thankfully he was near the bed, and he caught himself as well as Tony grabbing a hold of his hips.
Steve looked at his wrists then, seeing a piece of the silky ribbon around one of them, the fabric fraying at the end where it tore. He looked back at Tony and they both snickered.
Steve’s breath caught as Tony toyed with them through the silk, and loved every minute of it. The cool softness of the silk heightened to the rough masculine touches of Tony’s fingers, the man rolling the buds between his fingertips skillfully.
But Steve had been on the cusp of crying from the ripe pain of all that they’d done as well as still enjoying being under Tony’s gaze. With his hands still held down by Tony’s, Steve’s body constricted, muscles straining at that unmistakable sensation of his prostate being stimulated.
Tony took the wash cloth from earlier before helping Steve turn onto his back. Slowly, he wiped the white come that was drying on Steve’s stomach, cleansing the skin before gently wiping his softening penis, being careful not to add too much pressure. Tony understood the sensitivity of Steve’s body right after an orgasm.
Tony sat there, twirling a screwdriver in his grip as he stared at nothing in particular. It had been two weeks since Steve and his mini vacation. And though Tony had other matters to worry about, all he could think about was that trip, and Steve.
“I do,” Steve answered. Tony smiled at that, his hands coming up to rest on Steve’s sides.
Steve looked down at his chest as he brought his other hand up to massage both nipples at the same time. Tony could see the precome on Steve’s fingers smear one of the pebbled peaks as he massaged the flesh, glistening in the lamp light. It was so dirty, so unlike Steve and so fucking hot. The blonde worked both nipples with his fingers, swirling them in quick circular motions before teasing the underside of his pecs. Steve tried holding back a moan, failing completely as he ran his palms up and down his nipples, the feather light touch probably just enough to keep him on edge.
“And I love you, Steve. And that is never going to change,” Tony replied, his gaze affectionate.
“You’re gonna get into trouble with him if you keep busting his chops like that,” Steve said, kissing Tony’s hair.
It was only a few days after that, that Tony decided it would be best that he actually find a change of scenery, the lab looking more and more like a medieval dungeon with each passing day. He figured fresh air might do him some good.
Walking up behind Tony who was sitting on the couch and now talking to someone on the phone while discussing his business shenanigans, Steve wrapped his arms around the guy’s neck, nuzzling into it and breathing Tony’s masculine scent that mixed with his cologne. Placing small kisses on the man’s skin, Steve drifted his hands up and down over Tony’s chest and belly, slowly finding their way under Tony’s shirt to feel his warm skin. Tony was in the midst of talking, and Steve heard him stutter out his words, turning to see Steve’s blue eyes piercing into his brown ones.
“I saw you in the headlines,” The super soldier explained. “With a woman, walking a-and laughing with her,” Steve went on, unable to withhold the quake in his voice. Tony’s eyes softened, hearing Steve’s thoughts and worries.
“Nothing, Brucie,” the inventor lied, hopping off the stool and moving towards the door.
The genius wrapped his arms around his love’s meaty shoulders, a hand playing with the fine hairs at the nape of Steve’s neck.
Steve rolled his hips back and forth, his hole catching on the meaty crown of Tony’s cock. Each brush against his beloved’s skin ignited sparks of lust that resonated through the blonde’s ass, to his erection and up through his chest.
The blonde pushed their breakfast plates and mugs away, bracing his palms on the shiny, dark stained wood table as Tony hugged him from behind, his cheek and chin nuzzling between Steve’s scapulae.
Pepper paused for a moment, stilling their movements as she thought over her reply. “No,” Pepper admitted, squeezing his bicep affectionately, picking up their dance once more. “I can see it in your eyes, Tony. That connection, that spark, when you’re with him, that’s where your heart truly lies. Tears formed in the corner of her eyes, the sight causing the chambers of Tony’s heart to shrivel.
“Wish we could be like this all the time,” Steve said softly, his entrance relaxing some from Tony’s gentle caresses. “Love having this between us, Tony,” he confessed, looking up at him. The brunette smiled, a soft chuckle on his lips.
Giggling, Steve shimmied a little to help get them situated, though it wasn’t the easiest thing to do with his hands tied.
“Of course, Captain.” Steve nodded as a way of thanks before slowly, and a bit dejectedly heading back upstairs to over analyze all that he’d done to cause Tony to avoid him like this.
“I can pay for my room just fine, Tony,” he told him, trying to whisper.
Walking back up to the truck, Tony wrapped an arm around Steve’s shoulders, shaking him lightly. “Alright let’s get some food and then get some sleep.”
"Well, you never had a soulmate before either so," Tony smirked, making Steve chuckle. "But, we have a choice, Steve. Regardless of biology, or the power of the cosmos or what have you. Do you know what you want to do?" Tony asked, his expression earnest.
“I appreciate and accept your apology. Thank you,” Steve said, looking to Tony with a close-lipped smile. And it was then that Tony knew that they would be alright.
The brunette flopped against him after the last spurt of his release filled Steve’s entrance. Tony was clearly spent from all of their play, as well as holding himself off till now. Steve unlaced his hands from his love’s to softly stroke Tony’s cheek and shoulder as he laid his head in the crook of Steve’s neck.
Once everything seemed to be back in order, the dark wood table gleaming and spotless from Steve’s precome did they rush out of the communal area and towards one of the elevators. Tony stopped in his tracks though, only to turn and jog back, remembering Steve’s discarded satin panties that had been abandoned under the table.
“That ‘beefed-up golden boy’ is Captain America, Stark,” Fury remarked, voice stern. Tony didn’t say anything, wanting to get up and walk away. He was a busy man with more important things to deal with.
“Go ahead, Steve. Come,” Tony whispered in his ear as he hooked his two digits deep inside the blonde, spreading them wide within Steve’s entrance. Steve looked at himself in the mirror, watching as he fucked himself on Tony’s fingers relentlessly, wanting only to be filled up completely. It was that explicit image displayed before him, with Tony staring at him in the reflection, that pushed him over the edge.
“Prove it,” Steve challenged, smirking at Tony in the mirror. That seemed to sober Tony up then.
Steve could not help but to yank his beloved close, meshing their lips together sweetly, the love flowing between them coursing through their veins. The blonde raked a hand through the genius’s hair, his mouth sucking at the brunette’s full bottom lip as heat began to kindle in his lower belly. It was not surprising though; they’d been away from each other for far too long. Steve’s longing for Tony had been a tumultuous sea of worry and self-doubt. That feeling of a smooth gold band on his finger let all those concerns fall away though, only for relief and pure happiness to spread and take root within him.
Instead, the man was rushed beneath the deck of the ship while the older man, whom he heard a crewmember call, Obadiah, walked towards him with a pistol. The merman knew what such a weapon could do, and so he sat still, regardless of the fear and pain that pulsed within his body, regardless of the blood that seeped from beneath his scales.
“I’m gonna be stressed out after this meeting, you know? Might need to find a way to relieve it,” Tony said, clicking the elevator control.
Then again, from what he’s found out about Tony’s past reputation, the man had only been with women. And he really couldn’t hold that against Tony, Steve hadn’t been drawn to a man before Tony came into his life. So, to say the least, Steve’s chances were greatly marginalized.
It was as if the couple could not be close enough together. Leaning forward as they continued to kiss fervently, Tony guided Steve back against the unkempt sheets, the blonde’s nightie bunching up at his hips. Steve went back easily, his knees moving up to bracket the brunette’s sides, his feet hooking at the divot in Tony’s lower back.
“I do,” Steve whispered. “They just like to sell papers. I’m sorry, my love,” Steve breathed feeling beyond silly in that moment.
The obscene noises that left Steve only made the genius’s need for him that much more urgent as he got himself into place behind him.
In a flash though Tony had him on his back, the brunette between his legs. He said not a word as the genius slid his erection back into the super soldier, hiking his knees over his shoulders. Steve grunted when Tony reentered him, his hole now sore. Oh, but how could that matter when the love of his life, the man that was his future was gazing at him, as if he was the rarest gem in in the world, the most beautiful man alive. Tony captured Steve’s lips, his tongue exploring Steve’s mouth messily. The blonde hummed against the genius’s moth, licking at the man’s ruby, kiss bitten lips. Holding the back of Steve’s head in a masculine hand, Tony rocked his hips into the man, pulling out completely. Steve could hear the wetness of their bodies coming together, envisioning Tony slipping inside his glistening reddened hole. All of those visages as well as the love that pierced into his chest and heart every time Tony sunk into him fully had Steve becoming hard once more. It hurt, his fourth erection straining, his ass sore from what it had been subjected to. And yet, Steve could feel warm tears slither down his cheeks and temples as they fell into his hairline.
They took a few breaths together, steadying themselves. Tony moved back then, pressing a little kiss to Steve’s nose. “I truly do love you,” he said, sitting back and nudging himself between Steve’s legs once more. He used the hand that wasn’t coated in lube to spread the blonde’s legs, pushing his one knee to his chest. “Can you hold your leg up for me, babe?” Tony asked, and Steve hooked an arm around his knee, keeping it up so that he remained wide open for the brunette.
“Shall we officially exchange our baskets now?” Tony offered, heading to where the blonde had placed the baskets earlier. Steve let out a sound of dismay, but followed the man like a puppy at his heels. He tried to calm his arousal, but Tony could get him hot bothered so damn fast.
“I-I umm,” Steve sputtered out, and Tony scoffed.
Tony never gave it much thought when it came to his and Steve’s love life. But the genius liked being in control just as much as Steve enjoyed being controlled. There was something thrilling, Tony thought, about the way he could have the blonde on the edge of ecstasy, waiting for the that last touch from the genius to send him over the edge. Tony loved being able to give all of that to his boyfriend as well, knowing it was one of the few places that Steve could be himself truly, to let down the Captain America persona and just be an artist from Brooklyn. When Tony thought about that, it humbled him.
“Brayan,” Steve said, laughing lightly.
“Oh, yes, Tony,” Steve whispered, stretching under Tony, his muscles shifting beautifully.
“They had others in different colors,” Steve said. “There was a red and gold option,” he snickered.
"Girl Crush" By Little Big Town
“Oh, yeah. Well, I wasn’t planning on coming, but there is going to be a tribute and speech to Peggy.” Steve shrugged and smirked. “Didn’t want to miss something else with her.”
“You’ll always have me,” Steve remarked, kissing the top of Tony’s head. “And I’m never letting you go, either. Not in this life, or the next.” Tony hummed against his skin, kissing a pectoral before picking his head up to look at Steve. “Also, I think we need a shower,” Steve added, laughing lightly.
“No, it’s not a bad time at all,” Tony said quickly, grabbing hold of Steve’s bicep when the blonde turned to leave. “Sorry, I’m just tired today, and have a lot on the mind,” Tony added, using every bit of strength to not squeeze his hand around Steve’s bulging muscle.
“Are you really thanking me for sex, Steve?” Tony asked, laughing weakly as he gently pulled free from the blonde.
shall we do about this?” The super soldier asked, winking up at his beloved before leaning down, dragging his teeth over the edges of Tony’s covered length.
“And one for Rogers,” Steve added, taking out his own wallet.
“Nap?” Tony questioned with a chuckle, his head tipping up so he could look down at the other man. “I don’t think so…not yet anyways,” Tony answered then, tilting Steve’s own head up so that he could kiss him sweetly, his tongue finding its way into the super soldier’s mouth. How alluring and yet odd to taste himself on Steve’s own tongue.
Steve headed toward the communal floor regardless, not worrying about being caught wearing his frilly nightie. Natasha and Clint were on a field mission, Thor was either in Asgard, or with Jane. And Bruce was in South Korea, working with a woman by the name of Helen Cho. So, it was just Steve and Tony.
Pressing his chest to Steve’s back, the brunette nuzzled his cheek into the crook of his beloved’s neck, inhaling deeply and closing his eyes, feeling whole once more with Steve in his embrace.
It was hard for Steve to not look at anything but himself, having to close his eyes for a few moments and allow his heightened senses of touch to conjure up the image of Tony absolutely ravaging him. The man’s fingers were like that of a musician, and Steve was his instrument, making the blonde sing in pure ecstasy as he arched into Tony’s touch suddenly. He wanted more, needed Tony to continue caressing his body with his skillful hands.
Steve’s sentimental thoughts left him then when he felt Tony start to slowly thrust into him, the tight drag in his channel sending ecstasy through his veins. His erection jerked under the slip, the fabric wet where the head leaked profusely as Tony rocked into him. Steve pushed back eagerly, wanting to feel full from his boyfriend’s gorgeous cock. He tilted his head up to find Tony’s lips, darting his tongue out to lick at the seam. When Tony opened his mouth up Steve licked into it, swiping his tongue against his love’s and basking in the heat there. Steve continued to kiss the man headily, simultaneously slipping his arms completely from the lingerie straps, and pushing the fabric down around his waist, exposing his pecs completely.
The genius rested his forehead on the nape of the blonde’s neck, breathing deeply as he focused on all the pleasures that took hold of him. He felt the tightness of Steve’s body as he penetrated him, the warm, damp skin of the super soldier’s muscular back flush against his chest. Tony took in the scent of the man he loved, an enticing aroma of sweat, spice and sandalwood. The lust of their intimate moments was always ethereal and unlike Tony had ever known… but the love they shared would always be the most sacred and cherished sentiment he and Steve could give each other.
It was Steve’s turn to moan, head falling back and eyes closing as Tony took what he wanted, marking Steve with hickeys and bruises. They’d be gone by afternoon, and yet Steve loved how Tony could mark him this way, claiming Steve as his.
Tony didn’t say anything, his shocked expression speaking volumes as it was. The doors opened to Steve’s quarters then, and he exited the elevator, turning to look at the brunette one more time.
The joy that hummed through the room as Thor, Clint, Natasha, and Bruce opened their gifts from each other was energizing. And though he was sad that Tony decided to not join in, Steve was truly elated. They were all rather surprised to find out that Bruce crocheted, each of them getting a warm blanket.
“We could always just hang out here. I don’t mind,” Steve suggested, taking a sip of his own coffee.
“I guess that’s true,” Tony agreed, his nerves relaxing after he and Steve got on the same page.
“Oh,” Steve said, brows furrowed and his heart sinking. He wasn’t going to deny it, that had hurt more than he wished. He looked back to see Tony, his back still to Steve. “Does anyone else have restricted access?” He then asked.
“Tony, I swear to God,” Steve bit out, his face flushed, body trembling with restraint. “If you keep teasing, I’m not gonna last.” Steve finished, trying to get Tony to speed up the process. Not that he didn’t enjoy what Tony was doing to him. Steve just didn’t know how much more he could take before he orgasmed. And they hadn’t even gotten to the best part.
“Impossible,” Tony countered, chuckling lightly.
“God, you’re so enchanting…so gorgeous,” Steve whispered, his eyes closing then while he caressed Tony’s warm and sweaty skin. The genius murmured something Steve couldn’t quite catch, though he had a feeling the brunette wasn’t really forming words to begin with.
"I'm really not feeling the workout today guys," Tony said with a yawn. Steve noticed the man looked rather tired. Maybe he did not sleep well.
He took the stairs to his own floor of Avengers Tower, quickly showering and slipping into his knit pajama bottoms, hoping that sleep would give him some reprieve from his whirring mind. The Fates must have been against him that night, for he tossed and turned, thinking about what Tony and Pepper were more than likely doing in the floor above him. Steve pouted, flipping the pillow over and nuzzling into the cool fabric, thinking of how Tony would be loving his girlfriend, devoting himself to her as he caressed her soft body, and kissed her lips. The luxurious silky sheets would slide over her body as she sighed in the pleasure Tony provided.
“I love you more,” Tony replied softly, dropping his hands and leaning back in his chair once more.
“Why don’t you open it,” Tony cooed, encouraging the blonde. “Then you shall see.” Steve did not understand why Tony was being so ambiguous, but he complied, curiously unlatching the hinge that secured the lid. Opening the snuffbox revealed a deep navy, velvet cushion, a simple gold band set atop it. Steve didn’t speak for what seemed like an eternity, his blue eyes wide, the gleam from the ring glinting in his irises.
“Thanks for this, Tony,” Steve said as they packed up their gear, the sun setting low behind the colorful trees.
So yeah, Tony had loved Captain America, but certainly not Steve. Especially when he turned out to be nothing like how his father described him. Then again, Tony had come to know Steve, where Howard only knew Captain America, his perfect experiment. He was grateful for that, though. Because though he at first hated Steve for being stubborn, and righteous and a stick in the mud, he had come to appreciate those qualities in him. Howard didn’t know the little things that made Steve who he was. He didn’t know that Steve hummed to himself while he sketched, or how the blush on Steve’s cheeks would flood down his neck when he was embarrassed or caught off guard. And he never knew how Steve’s eyes would light up every time he discovered something new. Howard never knew Steve the way Tony knew him, and Tony wouldn’t have it any other way.
Tony eyed him a moment, smirking. “That’s a generous offer, but what would I owe ya for that cup of coffee?” He asked, reaching for the steaming mug of liquid gold, only to have Steve move it out of his boyfriend’s grasp.
Reaching his own hand down, Steve palmed and teased the growing bulge in Tony’s jeans, the brunette groaning as he rocked into Steve’s touch, wanting more. Steve indulged him a little while longer, watching the brunette’s expression twist with pleasure. God, Tony was gorgeous, his eyes closed, his dark lashes thick as his mouth parted in ecstasy, breathing heavy.
When he felt Tony’s cock was substantially coated with the slick gel, Steve released his boyfriend, shifting himself over Tony’s length. Tony helped guide him, lining Steve’s ass up with his erection. “Wait, Steve. I barely opened you up. I don’t wanna hurt you,” Tony said, a finger rubbing at the man’s opening, the pad of it barely slipping inside.
Leaning up then, Steve licked and suckled at the chocolate that covered Tony’s lower back, his tongue caressing each bump and divot of the man’s spine. Tony sighed, fisting the cushion back as Steve got closer to his rump.
quickly?
“Wow, how surprising. You and your bias.”
The blonde met his thrusts, though it took him a moment to find his rhythm. Once he did though, he closed his eyes and felt it all out, taking all that Tony was giving him.
“Well, guess we’re sleeping on your floor tonight,” Tony replied as they started for the elevator.
The blonde observed how Tony’s face twisted in pleasure, his breath warm on Steve’s cheek as he panted and softly moaned with each pulse of his hips. The angle of Tony’s thrusts sent a wave of ecstasy through the super soldier’s body, his hard cock drooling and jerking between the men’s bellies.
“Anything.”
“I know that you love me. And I love you.” Her voice was soft yet broken. “But we both deserve to be happy. And I know now, after years of trying to understand what it was we could do differently to make our love work,” she trailed off then, looking down at the ground. “I know now that it isn’t something we can fix. You can’t fix something that never worked in the first place.
The super soldier allowed his kisses to be sweet and innocent for just a fraction of time before he slid his tongue into Tony’s, feeling the wet glide of his boyfriend’s own as well as the slippery enamel of his pearly teeth.
Tony was pretty sure he knew what that stirring was, as much as he wanted to deny it. It was there, though, and in that moment, with Steve sleeping on him, a hand curled into Tony’s shirt, that the brunette could feel himself falling in love with not Captain America, but Steve Rogers.
“What’s the status, J?” Tony called out as he straightened the two wine glasses that were placed next to a chilled bottle of wine.
“So close, Steve,” Tony said in a strangled voice, closing his eyes a moment. He could hear the slick wet noise of Steve’s fingers pumping inside himself, and when he opened his eyes once more, he saw the glistening lube shining on Steve’s loose pink rim.
After the Attack on New York, Tony found himself constantly in his lab, anything to keep his mind from thinking about the aliens, gods and devastation that plagued him every moment of his life.
Comments and Kudos are always appreciated. I would love to know what you all think about the story so far?
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Tony asked, his voice shrill. Steve didn’t answer him though, continuing to stare straight ahead. “God, you’re so fucking stubborn, Steve.”
“He saved millions of lives and helped the Allies win the war...” Fury continued on, basically throwing Steve Rogers’ profile at the brunette. Tony pursed his lips together and took the papers irritatedly in hand. He looked at the picture of a man he had idolized growing up, the man he had wanted to be...the man who had all of Howard’s attention.
Steve’s thought left him when Tony pulled down his underwear, just enough to free up his erection that was well engorged, the white precome bubbling. Steve sighed at the relief from the pressure that the briefs were subjecting him to. His length twitched though in excitement as Tony took in the sight of it.
Steve was breathing heavily as he worked his body open, the pleasure of his own hand heightening the flame of heat inside him. A finger was eventually pushed inside and Steve arched against the pillows at the sudden pressure and stretch of it all. The super soldier’s head fell back, his mouth open as he reveled in both the physical sensation as well as that possessive gaze Tony was giving him. Knowing Tony was enjoying the view, watching Steve play with himself, caused the super soldier’s chest to swell with pride and his erection to harden completely at the provocation of it all.
Steve’s orgasm left him as limp as a wet towel…the blonde’s breath grew louder and quicker as he neared the metaphorical edge, his body sparking with tingling heat until a sharp cry left him. He came hard, his release dramatically spurting out in white, pearly ropes onto Tony’s bare belly and even onto the waistband of the genius’s trousers.
Fanart by Kelslk on tumblr of Steve and Tony's first kiss XD
“Uh, Steve,” Tony said, swallowing thickly and quickly shielding the man’s back side with his body.
“You okay, Cap?” He heard Tony ask, interrupting his thoughts.
Grabbing Steve up in his arms, he smiled mischievously. “Well maybe we should finish up our date now,” Tony offered. And before Steve could say anything about debriefing, Tony blasted off into the air, holding Steve securely as he flew.
Steve couldn’t help but to roll his eyes at the genius. “Lavender, Tony. Geez, we haven’t even done anything yet,” Steve sighed, his voice giving away his slight impatience. He knew Tony was being conscientious and caring, but Steve was ready for the man to get the show on the road.
was cute? If it was anyone else, he’d think they were slobs. But not when it pertained to Steve of course.
Steve reeled the pole back behind him slowly, holding down the button at the base. He cast then, only for the line to fall barely two feet in front of him, water splashing all over his waders and chest.
“Nothing major,” Steve said simply. “So, can I help you at all with your car? I’ve done some maintenance on old cars and bikes in the Army.
“I thought I’d leave that up to you. Since it was you I was being the asshole to,” Tony replied, grabbing up his coffee cup.
“Mhmm.”
The genius laid more kisses on secret spots that absolutely drove Steve wild; the soft skin behind the blonde’s ear, along the skin of his neck. And Steve openly moaned when the brunette scrapped his teeth along the super soldier’s serratus anterior muscles.
Steve always wanted to find his sense of belonging. And he thought he’d find it in the army, thought he would have found it with Peggy after the war. He surely didn’t think he would have found it when he woke up in a foreign century, his old life ripe in his mind though it was decades away.
“Thanks for the breakfast, Tony,” Steve said, winking and licking his lips, making it clear he wasn’t talking about the omelet and bacon. Tony laughed, a mischievous glint in his eye as he stood up, hooking his arms under Steve’s and pulling him up to stand as well.
I got it real bad, want everything she has
“It’s not about Pepper.”
Steve nodded, breathing heavy once again while he slipped the straps off his shoulders. Tony helped him along, sliding the fabric down Steve’s breathtaking body till it bunched around his hips.
Thanks to my beta for being wonderful.
“Really well, actually,” Steve replied, adding a ladle of batter to the pan.
Lathering his hair, Steve could hear through the hum of the shower the brunette’s voice, deep and resonating. How nice it would be to have Tony in here with him. Steve imagined they’d wash each other’s hair, Tony’s thick, dark tresses white and soapy in his fingers. They would take turns washing each other’s bodies, their skin taut and slippery. Steve’s hands would glide over Tony’s sinewy muscles as his hands trailed down his back…
Steve did as he was told, scooching up till his head hit the plush pillows. Tony crawled up toward him predatorily, and Steve’s penis jerked to attention for the third time that day, thinking of Tony owning him, claiming him that way.  Tony knelt between his spread legs then, pushing his knees up to his chest. “Hold them open,” Tony instructed, and Steve obliged eagerly, hitching his arms under his stockinged knees, splaying them wide open for Tony, who hummed in approval of the view.
“I may not have ever had a blow job, but you never gave one before,” Steve said slyly as Tony slid his hands up Steve’s muscular thighs and to the elastic waistband of his underwear.
“I wasn’t going to ask you this yet,” Tony began then, slipping his hands free from his boyfriend’s. “But maybe it is exactly what we need right now…” Tony rose off the bed then and headed for the living room, only to return a moment later.
“I never thought that you wouldn’t,” Steve breathed. Tony smiled and slid a few digits down the deep crease where Steve’s pecs met. He moved his fingers on down his boyfriend’s belly, where Tony traced over each crest and valley of the blonde’s abdominal muscles before the genius paused at his love’s navel. He could see Steve relaxing, his gorgeous frame sinking into the plush fabric beneath him.
“Good, let’s see how many more of those we can get out of you tonight, huh?”
“Sir, I was saying Captain Rogers was entering. And since you were mumbling under the car, I assumed you said ‘okay’,” J.A.R.V.I.S remarked sassily. Tony just rolled his eyes yet again.
“Shit, Steve, you’re heavy,” he huffed, pushing his hands against him.
The super soldier snickered into the genius’s mouth, moving his ass forward more, being a terrible tease as he made it so that his rump was just out of reach of Tony’s cock. He nibbled at Tony’s bottom lip, pulling at it between his teeth.
But, Tony couldn’t will his feet to move, his worries exceeding the yearning to see his friend. So, he plopped back down, thunking his head on the table in defeat.
“You’d have chewed me out if I’d have done that, had ignored the plan and put my life in danger,” Tony explained.
“No, I actually haven’t,” Bruce replied, sipping at his tea.
He weaved about the city, swooping low and flying close to the Hudson River, the water spraying around him. Tony let out a gleeful laugh, taking to the sky and soaring like Icarus, as close to the sun as he could. Here, Tony wasn’t labeled a genius, billionaire, philanthropist…and he guessed now playboy. Here he was just Tony, a guy who liked to tinker.
“I can go find a motel, Tony,” Steve offered before the man merely shushed him.
Tony was too late, and when that slimy alien wedged a foreign metal spear into the super soldier's chest, Tony felt every pain the blonde did.
Steve wondered, though his confusion didn't show on his features.
"A soulmark?" Bruce said in a mixture of awe and disbelief. "Tony, that's amazing. You know how rare that is anymore. Hell, it was seen as a myth until recently," Bruce continued moving closer to the other man.
“I hope not,” Steve replied, ducking inside the dome and closing up the panel. “How’d you do this?” Steve inquired, looking out of the glass in awe. “Wait, don’t tell me, I won’t understand a word of it,” he said quickly. The genius could only chuckle at that.
Only when his fingers grazed one of Steve’s knuckles did he realized he was actually reaching for the man’s hand. Quickly, Tony grabbed one of those abandoned popcorn kernels on Steve’s leg, and popped it into his mouth. Steve moved his eyes away from the television then, looking quizzically at Tony when the brunette had touched him.
“How did he arrive here?” Tony asked quietly, his voice calm as to not frighten the merman. None of the crew answered, their eyes diverted. “Well, clearly he didn’t just jump up here to get a look at you sorry lots,” Tony added, his tone now laced with annoyance.
“Well apparently in this area and season, it’s a good place to catch steelhead,” Steve said, looking pleased with the pole he chose.
"I-" Steve was left speechless, not knowing what this would mean for them. He knew what he wanted...he wanted Tony. But he was afraid of what Tony would say in response. He may yearn for Steve, but that doesn't mean Tony would
“It can be overwhelming.” Steve heard a soothing voice say, and he turned his head to see Tony walk up next to him. “Though Thor was always one to go for the gusto, when it comes to parties.”
“We’ll manage,” Steve grumbled happily, wrapping his arms around Tony once more, flipping him so Tony was on his back and Steve was straddling his thighs. Steve yanked Tony’s boxers down, watching the man’s thick erection spring out of its confines. “Mmm, can’t wait to have you fuck me senseless,” Steve said gruffly, reaching into his nightstand to grab a lube bottle.
Then he woke up almost 70 years later, with a date he never would be able to have with his beloved Peggy. It still pained him to think about her and the memories they shared. Hell, he had an issue with dwelling on the past in general. He didn’t mean to, didn’t mean for those thoughts to take away from him being in the present with Tony. Tony knew though, had understood why the memories harbored on Steve constantly. The man never berated him, never told Steve to just “get over it”, and that made Steve fall in love with him even more. Yes, he couldn’t deny the love and adoration he had for the man.
When Tony slowly undressed him the rest of the way, a pulsing heat flickered within his belly, his body reacting to the simple intimate act of being stripped down. Under the brunette’s gaze Steve wasn’t sure what to do, ringing his hands a few times before letting them fall at his sides. He couldn’t help but feel rather grubby though, he didn’t have time to clean up before they went to their bedroom.
Steve wore a dark green, velvety underbust corset, that was trimmed in an ivory lace. Tony took in how the lace trailed along Steve’s gorgeous, firm pecs, the scalloped edges brushing against his nipples teasingly. The sight alone caused heat to flood Tony’s southern regions, and he hadn’t even touched Steve yet. The genius’s eyes traveled down the blonde’s torso, loving how the fitted boning of the corset hugged Steve’s muscles. He finally rested his eyes on the matching green lacy undies the super solider wore, his semi-erect penis peeking between the rosette styled pattern of the lace.
“Oh my,” Steve huffed out as Tony continued to tease him. The blonde saw the wet spot from his precome dampen the cotton fabric, along with Tony’s saliva. The friction felt like heated lust though his veins, everything maximized because it was Tony, the man he was in love with.
Steve took them to an empty hallway, opening the first unlocked door and shoving both of them inside. It was dark and cramped, and it took Steve a moment to find the light switch. Once he did, the yellow glowing bulb hummed above them, revealing that they were in fact in a janitorial closet.
“Mhmm,” Steve mumbled, closing his eyes and pushing back into Tony’s hands, wanting more of that touch. Tony obliged only quickly, slipping his hands under the shorts to give each cheek a firm squeeze and place a kiss at the small of Steve’s back before standing up and moving away.
An alarm sounded then, and it was a high-risk Avenger blare. "Guess this'll have to wait," Tony said as they both left their personal matters behind and readied to depart for the threatened area.
The merman smoothed the cloth over his hip as tenderly as possible, biting his lip at the burn of the rough cloth catching on the stiches. The merman was not sure how he could get out of this room, let alone the ship without help. The narrow table he was on was a long way down for a creature with a tail. He would have to use all his upper body strength to crawl back to the deck. His tail was mostly pure muscle, but it did little good when out of the water.
Steve was moaning now on a continuous loop, thrusting back against his lover, wishing for Tony to fill him up the best he could with his skilled tongue. The feelings collided with the emotional thoughts that swirled inside his chest, and Steve couldn’t think of anything past them. Not like he’d wanted to even if he could.
Steve, who had his eyes closed for quite some time finally opened them, looking at Tony with complete trust and love. He tugged at his hole, hooking his fingers up and hitting his sweet spot while he brought his other hand down and stroked his weeping cock a few more times. With a sharp intake of breath and a strangled cry, Steve came hard, head falling back against the pillows, mouth parted beautifully. Thick ropes of white come shot up his abs and torso, a few droplets finding their way into the hollows of the man’s clavicle.
“Taste so good baby,” Tony mumbled against Steve’s lips, biting at his pink mouth delicately. The super soldier pulled back just enough to grab Tony’s shirt and yank it over his head, tossing the fabric behind him and quickly delving back in. The brunette’s arc reactor glowed and hummed between them, Steve’s one hand cupping its metal rim. Steve had missed hearing that lovely sound while he was away, missed that constant reminder that Tony was here with him, alive, warm and absolutely enchanting.
Hearing Tony’s dulcet voice say such a gentle command put Steve on the edge of succumbing to a monumental and pleasurable fall. Especially with the brunette’s digits hooking deeply inside of him, hitting that sensitive sweet spot, all the while thumbing at the slit of Steve’s penis which dripped with prerelease.
The weeks went by as they always did, consisting of work, Avenger missions and the occasional movie night with his teammates. Things between him and Steve were absolutely fine, they were great actually. Steve would be in Tony’s lab like always, or Tony would be sure to attend the team’s training sessions every day. Even when during one of their sparring matches, when Steve ended up pinning him to the mat, and straddling his thighs, causing Tony to have rogue, yet very naughty thoughts, he buried them away, knowing that soon these feelings for the super soldier would all just fall away.
With wide eyes Tony looked down, noticing a problem down below. That was not good.
Steve felt the bed dip slightly when Tony got in too, and the brunette tossed the covers over them, though Steve stuck a leg out. “I over heat easily,” he explained when Tony quirked a brow at him.
Tony stilled his hands then after a few moments, laughing lightly as well before he smoothed his palms over the fabric on Steve’s firm tummy. He took that time to just gaze up at Steve, feeling incredibly lucky having the man just like that. He’d never thought he would ever know what it would feel like to have his best friend also be his boyfriend. But now, Tony couldn’t imagine it any other way.
“What the hell are you doing, boy?” Obadiah Stane bellowed, pulling Tony to his feet. He saw the younger man’s torn glove and bleeding hand and he huffed exasperatedly. “Get him to the infirmary and have him cleaned up,” Stane barked, guiding Tony to their traveling doctor who had been on the deck as well, curious about the commotion.
“Well you’ve also got a refractory time like no other. How many did you have the last time?”
“Okay, so he and I are extremely good friends. Big deal,” Tony said, trying to wave it all off, attempting to sooth Pepper’s heart and mind so that their relationship could continue on. “Plus, he’s a guy, Pepper. You of all people should know that I don’t swing that way,” Tony chuckled lightly, his one hand caressing up her back to feel the cool metal of the zipper sewn on the back of her dress. Pepper knew he was right, too. She had been around him enough to know that he had bedded multiple women, loving their enticing, soft curves. It wasn’t that he had something against same sex relationships, he just personally never found himself sexually drawn to male before.
“Y-you look rather dashing tonight,” Steve commented then, fixing his Eisenhower jacket. “No smudge of grease in sight.” And there was that adorable easy smile on the man’s plush lips. Tony wanted to wipe the blonde’s smile off with a passionate kiss.
It was then that Steve shifted away from Tony’s finger only to spread his bum cheeks with his hands and lined himself up with Tony’s cock, chocolate trickling down the length of it.
“Pretty sure I can assume that.” Tony thought about how Steve hadn’t really shown any interest in anybody. And anyone who knew just a smidgen of history on America’s first superhero knew about Steve and Agent Peggy Carter’s virtuous yet tragic love. Besides that, Steve was reserved when it came to his romantic interests, at least when he was with Tony.
Tony pulled away, pressing kisses down Steve’s neck and shoulder before eyeing the man’s chest. Wrapping one hand around Steve’s erection through the silk, Tony stroked him teasingly, figuring the feel of silk rubbing on his cock would feel pretty fantastic. And by the sounds Steve made, he didn’t think he was wrong. The brunette brought his other hand up further to tweak one of his boyfriend’s nipples, circling the dark pink nub with his fingertips as he continued to stroke Steve. He still rocked into Steve shallowly, not wanting to come before he and Steve were face to face. He was using every ounce of self-control to refrain from pounding into his love. It was a fucking challenge.
“I can’t lose you in my life, Pepper.”
Steve could barely think as he laid his head in the crook of Tony’s shoulder and neck, wanting to feel every part of the man as he pounded into his ravaged entrance.
“Well, I guess that’s true. And I really appreciate the attempt,” Steve said, giggling lightly as he watched Tony work.
“Tony?” He heard Steve call.
“Just take the phone call, Tony,” Steve said faintly, his messy blonde head popping up to look at Tony between his legs. “Just to get it over with.” Tony saw the man’s point, but that meant if he talked to Fury his throbbing erection would have to wait longer, and that wasn’t fair. Then again, Tony was a fantastic multi-tasker.
When he fell asleep, Tony figured that was the end of everything, him checking out Steve’s physique didn’t amount to anything. Anyone with eyes could see that the man was fit. But then, when he woke up to pee, only to walk back toward the bed and notice Steve was gone, Tony felt his chest tighten. He knew what had happened; Steve had a nightmare, and knowing that the man was outside alone, trying to recover by himself chipped away at Tony’s heart.
He opened his mouth to ask Steve what he had been up to lately, if he had been working on any art projects only to immediately close it when he watched Steve strip out of his shirt. Ummm…that was unexpected. Not that he didn’t enjoy the view or anything.
Steve is stuck on the ship, and Tony is filled with a conflicting thoughts and emotions.
Steve was in his room, changing into his uniform. They were called in for a mission, their first one in about six weeks. There was an unknown creature wreaking havoc in Queens. Strapping on his fingerless gloves and securing the shield to his back, Steve headed out to the landing pad where the quinjet was.
He merely sighed. “Do you think he noticed?” He asked in a whisper when he heard the water to the shower shut off. Natasha just shook her head.
The inventor quelled those unwanted, deviant observations before reaching the chamber that held the merman. Tony placed a hand on the brass handle, took a breath and opened the door.
"Feel nice?" Tony asked, already knowing so, he could feel his soulmate's sensations.
The genius couldn’t get enough of watching Steve fuck himself on his length, the man’s muscular body roiling with heat. How the blonde moved so beautifully on him, his abdominal muscles stretching under sweaty, flushed skin, his thighs clenching each time he lifted his ass off of the brunette before slamming back down onto him. And Tony was in awe when Steve arched into his touch as he plucked and scraped a nail over that sensitive nipple. He would never tire from a such a sight.
“This is so wonderful,” Tony whispered, and Steve placed a soft kiss to the back of his boyfriend’s neck in response, resting his cheek there. They then took turns washing each other, Steve maneuvering around to face his love before gently massaging his fingers into Tony’s scalp, the shampoo creating white soapy peaks in his hair.
Feeling and seeing were two rather different sensations. Seeing himself react to Tony’s sensuous touches was even more arousing than Steve expected. He could see how his body responded so easily to all that his boyfriend did to him. Knowing that Tony knew just how to please him, and make Steve feel like the most precious thing in the world was something the blonde never took for granted. He’d never forget how caring of a lover he had.
“I swear Steve, you and your hidden kinkiness is gonna be the death of me,” Tony replied, voice low and full of lust. He wiggled his boxers down then, letting them pool at his knees before sliding his Stark pad into his lap, giving Steve a clear view of his face, chest and hardening penis.
“Why don’t we get you out of those jeans, baby,” Steve breathed, unbuckling the man’s belt. “You’ve been so thoughtful, I should return the favor, don’t you think?”
“It’s not fair how pretty your penis is, Steve,” he added, nuzzling close and breathing against the mushroom shaped head. Steve was beyond flustered with want and frustration from Tony’s teasing. He was tempted to just pull his underwear back up and give himself release on his own. But then Tony’s mouth was on him and the super soldier immediately clutched at Tony’s silky hair, his body bowing at the overwhelming sensation of the genius’s warm and wet mouth gliding over his erection.
Tony needed to come, but he wanted Steve to fall apart first. So, as he continued to stroke the blonde’s heavy cock, Tony twisted his wrist, only to drag his nails ever so lightly around the engorged shaft. He could feel Steve’s body tense up, his breath catching before he orgasmed for the third time, spilling into the brunette’s hand and down his thighs as he cried Tony’s name. It was like music to the genius’s ears.
Leaning back in his chair, Tony tossed the tools on his work table and combed his non-injured hand through his unruly dark curls, huffing a breath and staring off at nothing in particular.
He watched them, as their two bodies became one, and he sighed Tony’s name like a mantra. He saw Tony’s eyes close then, the man gritting his teeth as he continued to pound into Steve’s sensitive ass.
“Tony, please,” Steve pleaded, his voice a whisper. He wanted Tony to penetrate him with tongue then, something Steve never thought he would ever want, or admit openly. But it was Tony, his boyfriend, the man that he loved fully.
Steve couldn’t form words in response to Tony’s rather rhetorical question. Tony knew all too well what Steve liked and didn’t like, and nipple play was right up there with what the super soldier loved most.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m glad,” Tony replied, guiding Steve to a sitting position. “Can you stand up, alright?” Steve nodded, and did just that, standing on tired legs, his defined, muscular thighs straining a bit. Tony wrapped a hand around his waist and walked the beautiful soldier to an arm chair positioned near the windows. Tony had been sure to have J.A.R.V.I.S tint them so nobody could see inside.
He was happy to have shared that with Steve, and he could tell the man was feeling a little better afterwards, his nightmare not so fresh on his mind. Tony had gone to bed, expecting that this time, that would be it.
Steve however saw in the NEWS clips that Fury showed him during that catch up session on the last 70 years, the philanthropy work Tony had done with his Iron Man suit. Steve had also read in Tony’s profile that he had recently begun focusing his life’s work with providing to the people, and not militaristic weaponry. Still, there was something about the man that Steve didn’t care for.
“It’s not the worst I’ve seen,” the smaller man said, finishing up the dressing of his friend’s wound. Bruce turned and began cleaning his medical tools then. “What are you thinking about, Tony?” Bruce asked after a silent pause, rinsing a scalpel in a water basin. Tony looked up and took a deep breath.
For about three weeks the blonde was still rather bed ridden, the alien metal taking his toll on his body even with the super soldier serum. He could move around for short periods of time, but for the most part, he was resting. Tony made sure Steve was as comfortable as he could be, and by the six-week mark, Steve was making an almost full recovery. He still got tired frequently and had to take frequent naps, but, the wounds were healed, his breathing was easy and not a chore for the super soldier.
Steve took a few moments to find his composure, his body gaining its feeling once more. He pressed a kiss to Tony’s chest before bringing his hands up to start undoing the man’s belt and zipper.
“What’re the chances you got a small mirror laying around?” Tony asked over his shoulder as he rummaged through Steve’s dresser. He quickly settled for Steve’s Stark pad, switching the camera around so it faced Steve when Tony settled back between the super soldier’s thighs. “This should do the trick,” Tony said then with a smirk, angling the device till Steve could see it clearly before leaning it against his knee.
Tony wouldn’t deny that feeling his skin against Steve’s was absolutely earth shaking, his arousal overly sensitive. But when he saw his precome stick to Steve’s rim, the white thread breaking off a moment later, it was then the genius’s desire for his boyfriend could not be ignored.
“What? Sorry, I didn’t realize you hadn’t asked her out yet,” Tony said in defense, trying to ignore the fact that his and Steve’s chest were brushing against the other. He backed up a mere inch before his back hit a broom.
"You sound upset by that," Bruce gently said, clearly noting Tony's mixed emotions.
“That wasn’t your fault, you must know that,” Natasha replied quietly, looking to Steve then.
“Hi, Tony,” Steve said smiling, a sketchbook and charcoal pencil in hand.
Quirking an eyebrow then, Steve went to the door, opening it slowly, not even thinking to check the peep hole. This would be the first time since the day a SHIELD agent took him to this apartment, that Steve had a visitor.
Nightmares can always bring two people even closer together.
I might add a third chapter of when Tony comes home? Any suggestions??
“What’s wrong?” The mermaid asked, poking Steve’s muscular side. The merman snickered before sighing; Natasha knew him well.
During the party, Tony went through the motions of entertaining the guests, a false smile plastered on his face. He never thought he’d dread a party until then, his mind preoccupied with the conversation he and Pepper were supposed to finish later. He just wanted to get it over with, followed by a tumbler full of a strong alcohol. No preference, just booze.
The brunette waltzed up to Steve, closing the distance quickly. He handed Steve the bookmark, their fingertips brushing as the super soldier took it. That touch made Steve immediately grab at his mark on his shoulder, and he noticed Tony flinch too, the man twisting his face up in what seemed like pain.
In the bowels of the spacious ship was a customized laboratory, where a handsome inventor, Tony Stark sat, fiddling with metal and tools. He was on the brink of a new invention, something that was a little different from his usual weapon design and engineering. He was soldering two metal pieces together when small, yet confident footsteps approached the door. There was a knock before a tall and lean woman waltzed in, a leather file in hand.
The brunette kissed him back softly, his beard pleasantly brushing against his chin. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s bare back, pulling him close as he deepened the kiss. Tony’s warm tongue caressed his own, tasting his teeth and the soft flesh of his cheeks. Enthralled in their kissing, Steve barely realized Tony was standing them both up, his hands blindly unzipping the fly of the super soldier’s uniform.
Once he felt that Steve would be more than ready, Tony coated his erection with lube and lined himself up with his love’s opening. Steve felt the other man nudged up against his backside, and so, he brought his one leg up and bent it at the knee, bracing his foot on the bed for leverage.
Later that night Tony finally fixed the problem with the algorithm for the arc reactor energy project. But as Tony set to work switching Stark Tower over to clean energy, everything that would make up the future chapters of his life would shift. And the next thing he knew, he was heading off to Germany to square off with some alien god who had an ego even greater than Tony's.
Steve realized with Natasha staring at him expectantly that he never answered her. “Oh, no of course not” he said quickly, readjusting himself on the couch cushion, tucking his feet under him while she perused the channels and movie selection. They settled on a Disney film, something to bring back a childhood innocence lost long ago. He sent a quick text to Tony, asking if he could video chat him tonight. Tony had replied with an ‘of course!’ a smiley face attached, causing Steve to smile dotingly at the message screen on his phone like a besotted teenager.
Steve high tailed it to his bathroom, quickly stripping from his tattered suit, eager to step into a warm shower. As he lathered up his hair, Steve’s mind was stuck on Tony. He just didn’t know what to do about him anymore. He really needed to preoccupy his mind with other things other than Tony. Thankfully, he had a plethora of paperwork to go over from this mission. It would be just what Steve needed.
Natasha and Sam headed off to the giftshop once their tour was over, and Steve meandered behind, lost in thought. He noticed an exhibit room dedicated to Captain America, probably on loan from the Smithsonian. There was a picture of him on the main panel, looking stoic in his Captain America uniform. Steve remembered that picture being taken, and all the takes they had done until Steve looked like the overly masculinized figure they'd wanted for the propaganda
“Uhn, yes,” Steve uttered like a mantra, as the heated coil in his stomach wound itself taut.
Looking back to the reflection in the mirror, Steve met Tony’s eyes, liquid pools of warm amber as he moaned so sweetly in Steve’s ear. Knowing that he could take the genius out of his head for a little while always made Steve feel absolutely wonderful.
He worked his way down Steve’s back, licking and biting at the man’s sides, the blonde’s pleasurable sighs spurring him on. He mouthed at the silky fabric that covered a small area of Steve’s broad back, shifting it up then to kiss the warm skin. When he reached the man’s ass, he pressed a kiss to the top of each plush cheek, slipping a finger down the cleft till he found Steve’s entrance. He could hear the moans coming from Steve, the anticipation bubbling within him as Tony teased the tight flesh of his opening.
Steve’s legs fell open even more, his body already exhausted as Tony finally pulled his fingers out of him, only to slick up his own aching erection. Steve lifted his head and watched him, Tony’s breath hitching at his own touch. Steve could only assume that Tony too was ready to fall apart.
It was then that the elevator pinged, the doors opening to Tony’s lab, and Steve had the sudden urge to head right back from where he came. No, he wouldn’t let his emotions consume him, he was better than that. He’d give Tony the food and coffee, ask if all was well and remain casual. He could do this.
They showered together, both men taking turns washing each other’s hair and bodies. Tony quickly dressed in slacks, button down and blazer while Steve dressed in lounge sweats and a form fitted t-shirt. “You know, it isn’t fair that I have to go be responsible and meet with people while you get to stay here,” Tony pouted, walking toward the elevator.
“Oh, it’s time for Peggy’s tribute,” Steve whispered excitedly. “Come on.”
Steve looked toward the bed then, imagining Tony laying there with him, curled up in each other’s arms, just talking about things and perhaps giving an occasional kiss.
“Let me show you just how thankful I am for you,” Steve whispered, his breath a faint puff against Tony’s mouth. Tony’s own breath was a soft sigh, and he closed his eyes, the perfect invitation for Steve to close the small space between them and press his lips to his lover’s.
The man was not awake, and the sight of the super soldier, his friend... his soulmate like that overwhelmed Tony terribly to the point he had to sit down and remember how to breathe.
“You bet I am. Figured we’d be getting to this part of our relationship soon enough. Might as well always be ready,” Tony remarked, nestling himself between the super soldier’s legs.
Tony eased off Steve then, reaching next to him for the lubricant. Popping the cap open, Tony squeezed what was probably an excessive amount onto his hand. “Spread your legs some more for me, Stevie,” Tony murmured, watching the soldier comply. Holding onto one of his boyfriend’s hips, Tony prodded gently at the man’s entrance, slathering the lube there. The one finger went in easily, and Tony pumped it inside Steve’s warm channel a few times, prepping him for a second digit. “Steve, open your eyes.”
He was ready to start on sketching the creek itself when his phone rang. Searching for it in the pockets of his jacket, Steve saw that Natasha was attempting to video chat with him.
Once the film ended, it was a little after 11pm. Natasha had fallen asleep as the credits rolled; and though Steve asked if he could help her to her room, she kindly declined and curled up on the couch, fetal position. Covering her up with a blanket that was folded over the back of the couch, Steve headed toward his quarters to shower. He wasn’t sure how long Tony would be able to chat for, or if the man would be too tired. But Steve had an idea in mind. Something that would be new for them as a couple. And if he knew anything about Tony, Steve was pretty sure the man would like the idea.
“What a pleasant surprise,” Steve said, walking up next to his love. “I never thought I’d see you up before 10 am,” he joked, pressing a kiss to the brunette’s temple, and Tony chuckled. “What spell did Loki put you under to cause you to wake up early and test out your culinary skills?”
He got his answers when they ended up in a fishing shop in western Pennsylvania, and Steve was staring at the fishing poles that lined the one wall in deep and utter confusion. “You’ve never fished before, have you?” He asked Steve, picking up a fisherman’s hat, furnished with colorful lures.
Tony made a strangled noise, digging his nails into his thighs as he watched Steve acting so damn dirty. And the way he looked, so innocent as he did it nearly made him come undone. “Holy shit, Steve,” Tony said when he was able to use his vocal chords again. “What’re you trying to do to me?” he asked while grabbing up the lube once more.
The blonde found a mug with Tesla on it, with a saying “I liked wireless before it was cool.” Steve hopped Tony liked the novelty, cliched mug as much as the super soldier did.
“Hadn’t orgasmed like that in a while,” Steve admitted, chuckling lightly as he pressed his cheek in against Tony’s then. Tony laughed lightly too. Holding Steve close to him.
He guided Steve back to lay on his bed, making sure the man was comfortable.
“How could I
“I would be okay with that,” Steve finally said, leaning in to kiss Tony on the lips before trailing a line of open mouthed kisses down his jaw, appreciating the coarse hair there. “Let me be good for you,” he added before he felt Tony lift his chin up with a finger then, staring intently into Steve’s eyes.
“Take me apart, Tony,” Steve said, his voice husky and deep. He gave Tony another heady kiss, barely pulling the brunette’s bottom lip between his teeth, nipping and pulling at it. “I want you to do everything to me.”
Steve traced his hands over Tony’s shoulders, and over his clavicle before slowly drifting the pads of his fingers over his chest. The brunette humming in delight when Steve brushed his nails over the ruddy, pebbled flesh of his nipples. Steve smirked, flicking his gaze to Tony’s and continuing to drift his hands down, sliding his palms along the tawny skin of the man’s lean stomach before hitting the belt and waistband of the genius’s dark wash jeans.
He hadn’t realized though, that his quietness and distance was doing exactly what he tried to avoid. It was Steve confronting him in the elevator that popped the bubble Tony was trying to secure himself in. When he saw the sense of hurt and betrayal cross Steve’s face when he called Tony out on his actions, his heart sank. He felt like a total asshole for making Steve feel that way, his close friend and teammate. Tony had tried so hard for his and Pepper’s break up to be just between them, to keep others from getting hurt. And yet, he fucked things up again, hurting Steve in the process.
“Thank you, sir,” Steve replied, shaking the man’s hand. With that, Jerry told them where the better places for fishing were as well as where there weren’t as many people, and the two men headed out towards the streams.
“Yeah? You want it harder, baby?” Tony huffed out, his eyes squeezing shut, his head tipping back while Steve tightened around him. Their bodies melded together as they made love, sweat forming in random droplets on their skin. The genius’s arc reactor lit the planes of Steve’s strapping back, the divots cast in shadow as the crests of muscles glowed in a pale blue light. He opened his eyes to see how Steve arched and shuttered as he reached his third climax of the evening, his soft moans pleasant to Tony’s ears.
Tony looked at him finally then, eyes an indiscernible mixture. “I’m just trying to keep you safe and comfortable, Steve,” Tony said, his voice soft yet assertive. “I know what you want, and I am giving that to you.” The genius took a breath. “You just need to be patient with me, Steve, and let me be over cautious,” he added. “Because if I wasn’t, and I ended up lost in the moment or hurt you somehow…” It was there Steve saw the fear cross Tony’s eyes, heard the emotion in his voice. Steve remained quiet, the sensuality of the toy and ribbon a distant thought as he saw Tony’s own glimpse of vulnerability. “I’d never be able to forgive myself if I put you in harm’s way due to my lack of responsibility or care for you,” the genius continued, taking his eyes off of the super soldier and staring at his own hands.
Each moan and sigh the blonde elicited brought a plethora of emotions to the genius. It made his heart flutter and his southern regions wish to come to attention. But more than that, it made Tony feel otherworldly, his love for Steve coursing through his veins like a river rushing through an uncharted wood. The super soldier made him feel alive. Knowing that a man like the Steve loved him just as much back, as well as confiding and trusting in Tony with his heart, mind and body, the genius would always be completely floored and grateful for it. Because a life without Steve wouldn’t be a life worth being a part of, he figured. It may be overly sentimental, but that was how much Steve meant to him.
Thank you to my beta!
“We don’t have to use them,” Steve said quickly, and the brunette looked up to see Steve’s cheeks flushed deep red. Tony truly hoped the super soldier didn’t get a case of overthinking and embarrassment. “I know it’s different and significantly new for what we are accustomed to,” Steve went on, looking at his hands and shifting his wrists underneath the ribbon. He let his words hang in the air, not sure what Tony was thinking in that moment.
He toured the aisles of the gift shop, which was smaller than the one in the Smith. Natasha had a few things picked out, Sam was eyeing up a print of a Renoir he had admired earlier in the museum. The super soldier saw a bookmark with a picture of a Grecian Statue, the man standing in contrapposto, his chest bare, his robes fashion to cover his nether regions. Steve felt drawn to it however, from both an artistic standpoint and the familiarity it brought him. The man reminded him of Antonius.
Stepping out of the shower, Steve swaddled a fluffy towel around his waist. He realized then, that he forgot the change of clothes he sat out on the desk in the bedroom. That wasn’t a big deal though, he and Tony have seen each other in their skivvies before, when changing after a mission and the like. As casually as he could, Steve walked out of the bathroom and past Tony on the couch to grab his clothing. He heard the brunette stop mid-sentence on the phone, and Steve turned to see the man staring at him, his cheeks red. Tony’s eyes rose to meet Steve’s, and he quickly looked away.
“I’ve been wanting to ask you something, my love,” Tony started, laying a hand on one of Steve’s still clothed thighs. When Steve just looked at him, Tony continued. “When we have sex, I have noticed that you seem to take great pleasure when I act more, assertive…” Tony trailed off, trying to gage Steve’s expression. The blonde’s cheeks were pink, and his eyes looked down. “Is that something we can talk about?”
“Dude, you’ve been acting so distracted lately. I know your breakup with Pepper was what, three, four months ago? But you gotta keep living life. You know she is.
If you couldn't tell already, I love writing a not so tech savvy Steve XD
In the penthouse of Avengers Tower, Tony sat on his big couch, looking at the gift bag Steve had given him earlier. He had not opened it yet, and he felt a strange nervousness in his gut as he slowly took out the wrapped object. Tony was a bit flabbergasted by Steve's gesture, and he ignored the giddiness he had when the man came down to his lab. Steve never came down there, and thought they were cordial, the brunette constantly felt a yearning to be closer to the blonde. It confused Tony, though a part of him was thrilled. When he saw Steve enter earlier that day, and they made eye contact, that tingling in his shoulder strengthened, but he didn't itch at it, not wanting Bruce or Steve to notice.
“Gorgeous, breathtaking,” Tony cooed, rubbing at the straining ring of muscle, creating a plethora of sensations within Steve’s body. The super solider bit his lip as he gazed at Tony’s fingers playing with him before he leaned his head back against the pillows, the image in the camera setting him on edge.
Ever since the Avengers moved into the tower, Tony had secretly yearned to be closer with Steve. For them to be friends. And though they have grown since the battle of New York, it still didn't seem to be enough for Tony.
“Well, I always figured mythical creatures had to be influenced from some sort of truth,” Bruce admitted with a small shrug. “Still it does not seem real; it is rather shocking.”
"Mr. Stark, correct?" Steve started before Tony cut him off.
“Oh my,” Steve whispered, shifting his legs just a bit as he angled his neck to get a better view. He stopped his adjusting when he heard a small tear above him. He’d put too much strain on the binding on his wrists. But he was rather curious to know what his body looked like, stretched open by the sex toy.
“You’re so wonderful, Steve,” Tony breathed, voice gravelly as his body slumped against the chair. He combed a hand through Steve’s hair, appreciating the softness of it. Steve purred in delight at Tony’s touch before he slipped the man’s boxers and pajamas back up to their proper place around his hips.
“Don’t harp on me about being reckless,” Steve finally snapped, practically punching the elevator controls. He was in desperate need of a shower, his face grimy, his blonde hair a mess, his suit needing some heavy mending done.  And Tony, who followed him into the elevator car was equally debauched, though his armor he had left for decontamination wasn’t as heavily damaged.
It wasn’t the morning light that crept into the room that stirred Steve from his slumber, but the warmth of strong hands against him and the subtle press of an arc reactor into his back. The super soldier opened his blues eyes, taking in every touch that Tony was giving him before smiling and closing his eyes again. He’d almost considered it all to be a dream, until Tony shifted behind him and kissed Steve’s neck with light kisses, his facial hair scratching pleasantly at his skin.
I wanna drown myself in a bottle of her perfume
A week later, Steve was off to the makeshift, new S.H.I.E.L.D headquarters Fury had been slowly building after the one infiltrated by Hydra fell. He wanted to talk with Nick about recruiting Sam and Colonel James Rhodes to become Avenger teammates. Steve obviously had witnessed Sam’s fighting tactics as well as his honorable heart. He’d be a perfect addition as The Falcon. And Colonel Rhodes had experience as the Iron Patriot for years and was Tony’s right hand man. He clearly would be a remarkable choice.
The workshop was quiet. No loud music filled the room, just the faint whirring of DUM-E as he maneuvered around the random mechanisms and armor that littered the floor space.
“Am I such a tease?” Tony challenged, voice husky as he took hold of Steve’s sides and flipped them, Steve on his back as Tony loomed over him. Steve smirked, scooting himself up to the plush pillows at the head of the bed. He hiked his slip up till it draped right above his naval and spread his legs wide.
Sitting them up, Tony practically sat in Steve’s lap as he toyed with the hem of his boyfriend’s shirt. In no time at all, Tony hiked the cotton fabric over Steve’s head, discarding it to the floor, allowing himself to take in his fill of Steve’s naked torso.
“T-oh-hony!” Steve laughed, trying to move away from his love’s playful torment. His giggling quickly turned into a low moan of bliss when Tony nosed down Steve’s neck, licking and biting at the creamy skin that molded over his Adam’s apple and clavicle.
“You made a mess of my mirror,” Tony remarked, grinning like mad then. Steve tilted his head to see, chuckling then.
Thanks for reading! Hope you all enjoyed!
“What?” Tony was genuinely confused. “What are you talking about, Pepper? I’ve never been in a serious relationship before you, never loved anyone before you.”
Tony’s one hand that was wrapped around Steve’s back began its way down, till it rested upon the swell of the blonde’s luscious rump. “I would love nothing more than to take you, love,” Tony said, smiling sweetly, his hand massaging the skin of Steve’s behind, causing the super soldier to hum at the bliss of it. He had always liked when Tony gave his ass attention during their kissing spells in the past, and Tony knew just how much Steve liked it. The brunette always made Steve feel so wonderful and lovely, as if he was something sacred. Even when Steve’s self-doubt crept in, whether it was about Avengers matters or personal things, the man would give the insight Steve needed to find his inner peace.
“Month,” Steve clarified with a yawn.
“Did you like watching me?” Steve asked while he pulled on his underwear and shifted his screen while he too found his way under his sheets.
When the Battle of New York was over, Steve moved to Washington DC, working at S.H.I.E.L.D headquarters with Natasha, visiting Peggy and meeting a fellow vet while doing his usual workout routine every morning.
He went to put his phone back in his pocket before stopping himself. Tony instead decided to scroll through his camera roll, and found a picture of him and Steve, the blonde giving a childish smile and blushing while Tony pressed a kiss to the man’s cheek. It was a few weeks since they started dating, and he already was acting like a love struck teenager and taking selfies.
“Tony,” he said, leaning a hip against the wall next to Steve. The brunette folded his arms across his chest, glancing at the floor boards. “Tony Stark.” Steve nodded, remembering the name “Stark” on the side of the ship earlier.
“Hey, Nat,” Steve greeted her with a smile when her friendly face popped up on the screen.
“Hi, Steve,” she replied, smiling back and waving at him. “How’s yours and Tony’s honeymoon?” She asked, and dammit, did that make his cheeks warm.
“Nor can I,” Tony agreed, taking a deep breath in then.
Tony found Steve helping a young boy into an ambulance, giving the boy a soldier’s salute before the medics took over. He turned to see Tony, giving him a tired smile.
Steve stroked himself with a snug fist, spreading the flowing precome around his shaft. “Mmm, you taste so good, love,” he heard Tony say before feeling the man’s lithe tongue work its way deep into Steve’s body. Envisioning Tony back there was such an obscene image that Steve felt the coil in his belly about to burst. “I love how red your skin gets when I play with it for a long time,” Tony added. With each stroke of his hand, and with Tony’s dirty talk and sensational tongue, Steve moaned loudly, sounding extremely desperate with each ticking of the clock.
Steve took in Pepper and Tony’s body language, his heightened hearing catching snippets of their conversation. They both looked sad as Steve tried to make out what it was they were chatting about, knowing in the back of his mind that it was none of his damn business. Still, he heard Tony say ‘it wasn’t your fault,’ and Pepper saying ‘I’m sorry.’ Maybe they had a fight? That would have explained why Tony was in a far less quirky mood tonight. Tony then wrapped his right arm around the fair haired woman’s waist, pulling her in close as his left hand held her dainty right hand gently.
“I’ll charm them with my good looks,” Tony called as he cast out.
Steve had his eyes closed while he allowed Tony to cleanse his body. The dampness from the cloth left a coolness on Steve’s skin, sending a pleasant chill through him. He felt Tony’s hands drift along his bum, smoothing the delicate fabric over it before squeezing each cheek in his palms. Steve felt his breath leave him in pants, his head falling forward. God, he loved Tony back there, his nimble fingers exploring all of Steve’s masculine body.
When he had the strength to sit up once again, Steve did, though still with great effort. He fought the wooziness that swirled in his mind, focusing on his need to get out of there and back to his pod. He surveyed his surroundings, noticing metal objects that looked like tools of some sort. Two soaked rags were pressed on his gills, which were along the underside of his ribs. The water allowed his gills to filter water into his body so that he could breathe with ease. Steve could see then that there was a white cloth wrapped around his lower abdomen, dots of crimson blooming the fabric. He gently pulled the mesh from where it covered his wound to see stitching there. The black thread had sealed the cut, though blood still encrusted the area a bit.
Blinking his eyes a few times, he saw the one side of the bed empty, the side where Tony would so often sleep on. The genius was in his own bed that morning, much to Steve’s dismay. Tony insisted though, for he was busy in his lab, figuring out a formula for something Steve didn’t care to understand. Tony had said he didn’t want to wake Steve when he came to bed in the middle of the night, though Steve assured him it wouldn’t be a big deal.
“Yeah, that and your humility really won me over,” Steve added, slowly sitting upright, feeling Tony’s come slide out of his ass. Tony chuckled, leaning in for one more sweet kiss from the blonde before getting up slowly.
The super soldier slipped under the covers of his boyfriend’s vast bed, which seemed even larger without his beloved in it with him. Steve pouted, looking over at Tony’s side of the bed. Grabbing one of his love’s pillows, Steve cradled it into his chest, pressing his nose into the cool fabric and breathing deeply. He could detect a hint of Tony cologne in the pillow case, where the genius’s neck would rest. Steve could smell along with the cologne, a musky sandalwood from Tony’s hair after he’d shower and flop into bed after a long day’s work of meetings or inventing. And as almost as an afterthought, the blonde’s enhanced senses could recognize that slight tinge of swear left over from Tony’s skin, usually when the genius was suffering a nightmare that Steve had to help Tony out of. Tony would wake up with wild eyes, pupils dilated as sweat laced his skin and his body assumed flight or fight mode. Steve would hold Tony and whisper calmingly to him that all was alright, that the genius was safe in Steve’s arms.
Heading down the hallway towards Tony’s bedroom, a bedroom Steve spent most nights in, the super soldier found another post it. This one reading ‘Just a little further.” Steve felt anticipation bubbling within him as he picked up sweet crunchy candies that trailed to his boyfriend’s bedroom.
“She’s had better days,” Sharon admitted, her eyes saddening at the dissolving state her aunt was going through. “She speaks of you often, though. If you’re in the neighborhood, I’m sure she’d be thrilled to see you,” she added, shifting a file under her arm.
“I’ll never get over how beautiful you are, Steve…never,” the brunette remarked, kissing Steve on his forehead before guiding the man back until he was laying supine on the voluminous comforter, sheets and pillows. Steve watched him with half lidded eyes, blue irises illuminated in the warm lamplight. Tony moved over him, gazing at the super soldier fondly and skirting his calloused hands up and down Steve’s arms. He pressed into the muscle of his biceps, massaging them before trailing down to Steve’s bound wrists, loosely grasping them.
“Pff,” Steve derided, smiling as he nudged Tony in the shoulder. “Probably the best of them all.”
, Tony. I’ve fallen in love with you,” Steve confessed. Tony could actually feel his chest tighten to the point he thought it would burst when he heard those words. “And I can’t explain it, why you’ve created these feelings I thought had died within me when I had gone under those 70 years ago,” Steve paused, taking a breath. “I’ve felt this way about you for a long time, Tony. And I’m sorry if it makes you uncomfortable or weirded out by it. But there it is,” Steve added, spreading his hands. “Take it with what you will.” Tony was lacking in the verbal department, everything Steve saying settling inside his brain.
“I’m pretty sure there’s nothing you could do that would make me uncomfortable, baby,” Tony chuckled, facing forward once more. The blonde just smirked, cheeks flushing at what he knew he was about to do.
They continued their chatter as they consumed their meals, Steve asking about Tony’s day and what meetings he had attended.
Steve had been out of the ice for a few days, and after a crash course of the last 70 years he had missed, he was placed into an apartment complex that was established by S.H.I.E.L.D.
“It is,” Tony replied, glancing at the apothecaries and medicinal herbs Bruce had organized along the shelves of his medical space. “And yet, Obie and the rest of the crew up there were acting as if they had merely caught a game fish,” Tony added, a look of bewilderment on his face.
“Oh, well I am sure you’re not complaining about that,” Natasha winked. And the blush on Steve’s cheeks deepened a shade.
, love?” Tony hooked his fingers inside him, tugging at his loose rim, wet and throbbing with need, causing Steve to gasp, his breath ragged, hole clenching around Tony’s lithe digits.
. He felt at peace with Tony, grounded in knowing that they were each other’s soulmates, through thick and thin.
The elevator doors opened then, leading out into the living area of his penthouse. Tony didn’t have anywhere to go, or anything to do for that fact. He wandered through the room aimlessly, wondering about his life, the Avengers, and what Pepper was doing right now. He’d seen her only sparsely, for business matters mostly. Tony walked over to the window, the grey skies reflecting his destitute state.
“You liking that, Steve?” Tony said, humming against Steve’s skin, his breath warm against one of the blonde’s nipples.
"I was so worried," Tony said softly. "I-I saw you dead, in a vision some hundred and fifty years ago," Tony added. "I was too late for you then, but Steve." Tony gently brought Steve's hand up to his lips, kissing his knuckles. "I am here now. And I will never in all that I am able, let anything happen to you again," Tony vowed. "That's my oath to you." Steve smiled weakly, his eyes glossy.
“Should I go into detail sir?” J.A.R.V.I.S asked, his tone laced with sass.
Tony stood there for a few solid seconds before clearing his throat and finally blinking. He felt the jealousy pit yawn to life as he watched the retreating woman make her way toward the front of the room. Tony went to leave then, needing to find Rhodey and not be in any proximity with Steve before-
He was absolutely thrilled with the turnout of the toy drive. So many children that probably wouldn’t have presents under their tree or a gift to exchange during Hanukkah or Kwanzaa now would have something to cherish. It brought back memories of his childhood Christmases. A small, feeble tree with heirloom ornaments adorning it would be huddled in the corner of their apartment. He would make his mom a handmade present and tuck it under the sharp pine needles. And his beautiful, selfless mother always scrounged up enough money to get him something special, like new drawing pencils or a wooden toy. When Christmas morning came along, Steve would hurry as fast as his sickly body would allow him to the living room to see a brown paper package nestled underneath the tree. Even though he knew other children received multiple gifts, Steve was always so grateful for his lone one. He knew there were families out there who were even less fortunate than him.
“I hope you like it,” Steve breathed before he turned and headed for the elevator, his chest tight. he felt like he was going to pass out as he pressed the button for his floor. he could hardly look at Tony then, as if he did, it would have revealed something to the brunette.
“You shouldn’t wipe down your chest, I like seeing you all dirty like that,” Tony said, winking at his boyfriend before pulling his boxers back up. He made a mental note to have housekeeping do some serious dry cleaning when he left.
“That will be all, Ms. Potts,” he remarked, giving a small, forced, closed-mouthed smile. He stepped away from the curb as Pepper’s car window went up, Happy slowly pulling onto the road.
“Hmm?” Steve said, standing back up, and turning to face the man.
Steve was a wreck above him, and for extra measure, the brunette gave Steve’s lovely rump a playful swat, leaving a faint hand print on the super soldier’s warm skin. Tony’s little spank was a surprise to Steve, and he gleefully groaned at the touch. It was harmless and barely made a sting.
“I’m not. She isn’t who-” Steve was trying to form a coherent sentence, his eyes owlish and pleading as he looked to Sharon.
“Well I’m good. Two fingers are plenty,” Steve said bluntly, shifting down and swirling his hips to feel Tony’s fingers still buried in him. His entrance was fluttering loose, the friction barely there. “I can take you just like this.”  Without a word Tony freed his fingers, grabbing the warming gel to coat his aching cock. When Steve went to turn on his back, Tony stilled him with a hand.
“Feels pretty good, huh?” Tony murmured as he listened to Steve’s blissful pants and sighs. “I can’t believe how snug you are, love,” he added, leaning back some to see how Steve’s rim hugged around his three fingers, excess lube seeping out.
It had been three years since they had met, and for three years, as the reality of their relationship became clear, they still fought their feelings.
Looking himself over in the mirror then, Steve smiled in approval, checking how his luscious bum looked in the thong. Tony loved his ass, and Steve wasn’t gonna lie, it was one of his best features. He also appreciated how the garter belt smoothed over his lower abs, enunciating his trim hips. And seeing how his muscular thighs and legs flexed under the soft sheer stockings was a lovely balance of masculine femininity.
The genius pulled the super soldier forward until Steve could rest his cheek on Tony’s shoulder so that Tony could unlace his boyfriend’s corset with ease. Steve breathed easily, sighing happily when Tony would press an unforeseen kiss to the blonde’s shoulder while he worked. Steve didn’t have the corset tied overly tight, and so, slowly but surely, Tony undid the laces at the bottom of the blonde’s spine and worked at loosening the thick, cream laces.
Steve was left standing there, still holding his soiled shirt as he watched Tony leave. That was a bit strange, he felt. But then again, as Steve thought about it more, he had found Tony to be acting differently the past month or so. It wasn’t that he was being distant or mean whatsoever. But he seemed to be rather capricious, his mind someplace else, like he was constantly mulling something over in his brain. After their conversation today, Steve figured Tony was acting that way because he had found a new love. When Tony admitted that, Steve felt his heart fall to the bottom of his belly, disappointment flooding through his veins.
Steve finally dropped his hand, pulling Tony against him and kissing his ruby mouth. The super soldier licked at the seam of his love’s lips until he was accepted in, and he darted his tongue into Tony’s warm mouth, tasting his tongue and teeth.
Tony and Steve kiss :D
“If I do anything that makes you uncomfortable, tell me. Okay?” Steve said, drifting his hands up the man’s sides. This would be new for them, the erotica of rimming. If this played out alright though, and Tony was okay with it, maybe in the future Tony would be the one rimming him.
He felt his boyfriend’s hands upon him once more, and Steve looked to see Tony lifting him slightly to put a pillow under his lower back. That was new.
Tony was sweating, trickles of perspiration sliding down his hairline and down his temples as he watched Steve’s body jar and quake while Tony fucked him. “Grab the headboard,” Tony grunted, shifting Steve’s legs so that Tony was holding them up with his arms and shoulders
Slipping out of his shirt then, Tony cradled Steve’s head in his hands, peppering little kisses all over the super soldier’s face. Steve giggled, his nose scrunching up from the way Tony’s beard tickled his sensitive skin.
“Oh, Tony,” Steve moaned sweetly, his hands falling to grab at the fabric beneath him, his fingers curling and uncurling into the sheets. He bucked up against Tony, letting the brunette feel how hard Steve was for him already, his erection pressing at the other man’s bare belly. The brunette responded with a low growl, nipping at Steve’s nipple as he began to massage at the other one with his fingertips.
“So, you don’t know who she is?” Natasha asked, and Steve shook his head staring at the wall on the other side of the room. “Since when does Tony Stark have a mystery woman? He never keeps his interests hidden,” Natasha continued. “Have you seen her around the tower?”
“Lift your hips for me, beloved,” Tony whispered, grabbing hold of the blonde’s waistline. Steve abided, angling his hips up so that Tony slid his pants down with ease. Steve also kicked his socks off, helping the man out some and leaving him in nothing but his grey briefs. Tony traced a finger on the underside of Steve’s foot, tickling him there.
Tony dragged his nose and lips across Steve’s chest, lapping at the other pebbled peak of flesh while he teased Steve, his fingers slipping between the cleft of the man’s ass, feeling the strap of the thong and gently rubbing it against Steve’s tight entrance. He could feel his boyfriend writhing underneath his touch, wanting more but also not wanting to get too close to the edge so soon. So, Steve pressed a hand in between them and stroked Tony’s erection through his boxers, causing the genius to gasp and rock his hips forward.
“You can,” Steve said, leaning down to lick a stripe up Tony’s belly and chest before finding his lips once more. “But I’m not done with you just yet,” Steve said, voice low, commanding as he suckled at Tony’s bottom lip while grinding his silk covered erection in against Tony’s, causing both of them to moan loudly.
“Oh, Steve, how you are everything to me too,” Tony breathed, clasping Steve’s hand between his own.
“I love you,” he said then, and he felt like he could never say it quite enough to Steve.
“Fuck me harder, baby,” Steve said, hooking his legs around Tony’s lower back, a heel pressing in there to urge the man on. The genius practically growled low, doing exactly what Steve requested. He angled his hips up and began to pound into his boyfriend relentlessly, Tony’s mouth finding its way to the crook of Steve’s neck, sucking at the skin till the blood vessels broke. The moans that left Steve were absolutely obscene when Tony changed his angle. When Tony bucked into Steve, he hit an extremely sensitive spot inside him, sending pleasure up through his body. It was a sensation he never knew existed, and Steve figured that it was his prostate Tony was hitting now with the tip of his cock. See, research is helpful. The bliss that washed over Steve was like waves of the ocean, gently swaying him until the water consumed his entire being.
“I think Nat and Darcy are going to the kitchen to grab a large decorated cake. Who bought it and
“That’s alright, Cap. But you’re more than welcome to stay down here. I’ll just be finishing up a few things on this beauty of mine,” Tony said, gesturing towards his car.
Men like that merely reminded Steve of the bullies he’d grown accustomed to back in Brooklynn.
“Well, this wasn’t exactly how I expected breakfast to go,” The brunette said, laughing lightly once more. Steve too giggled, maneuvering himself in Tony’s lap so that he could see the brunette better.
Tony was the first to regain his composure, pulling out of Steve, though still holding him closely. The brunette opened his tired eyes, noting the love bite on his beloved. He gave the mark a few soothing kisses, the genius’s tongue darting out and feeling the divots left onto Steve’s beautiful, pale skin.
Thrusting his hips up then, Tony found a new angle as he felt himself nearing the edge of everything. His body was aching, his thighs quaking as he found himself leaning heavily against Steve’s back. It was then, that he felt his love arch back, moaning loud enough that Tony was sure someone in the building could have heard it.
“Eh, tomorrow I’ll get the linens changed,” Tony chuckled and Steve hummed in agreement.
Looking into the bag, Tony saw a long item inside, and he pulled it out to see a bookmark. he assumed it was Steve’s, yet he observed the art piece, impressed with the figure's physique.
Steve was tired of trying though, and he decided to give up on it. He eventually didn’t try to hang out with Tony in his lab, or ask him to train with the rest of the team. If the genius was too caught up with whatever it was that made him so vile, then so be it. It took him a while, but Steve finally figured that it wasn’t his fault, and there apparently wasn’t anything he could do to help his friend. If Tony eventually came around to being his old self, Steve would still be there for him. But until then, Steve began creating a distance of his own. What made it all worse, though, were those stupid butterflies that fluttered in his chest and belly on the rare occasion that he did see Tony in passing.
Hopefully the image hosting website I used doesn't remove this gorgeous art!
“Do you trust me, Stevie?” Tony asked, two fingers tracing from Steve’s jaw down to the curve of the man’s neck and shoulder.
The apartment was sterile, barren and beige, lacking energy and life itself.
“I am one hundred percent on board with that,” Tony beamed. The brunette helped Steve put on a fresh, thick grey comforter then, something perfect for them to cuddle under during the frigid winter night.
You wanna touch yourself, love?” Tony asked, winded as he replaced his tongue with two fingers, slowly entering them into Steve. He spread his fingers, stretching his lover out without force or urgency; Tony didn’t want to unintentionally hurt his love.

"Oh, Steve," Tony said, sticking his free hand into his pocket, and the way Tony said his name made the super soldier's chest swell. Tony took out an object from his pant pocket and Steve realized it was his bookmark, and the blonde swallowed thickly. He had completely forgot about that before he gave Tony the gift.
Leaving the subway station, Steve found himself walking his old streets of Brooklyn, seeing all that was new and what had stayed the same. He’d visited the borough a few times since he had awoken in the new century, remembering the past. He was still looking for a place here, for when there was down time between missions. He knew it would be hard now, since he and Tony were co-leaders of the Avengers. It’d probably be best that he was at the tower and readily available.
“So sensitive, aren’t we?” Tony jested, biting his lip as he met Steve’s gaze devilishly. Steve only wiggled in response. So, Tony gave the man a little mercy and pulled his frilly panties down, springing the blonde’s penis free from its lacy restrains.
Taking a breath, he approached the clear glass doors, seeing Tony hunched over a table and writing formulas that appeared on a holographic screen in front of him. The typical, heavy bass of music vibrated slightly through the walls, and seeing Tony at work made Steve smile a little timidly, a blush tinting his cheeks. He did miss spending time with the man.
“What?” Steve asked, shock in his voice. “When did that happen?”
“Ready,” Tony asked, sounding winded as Steve felt the head of the genius’s arousal nudge against him.
“Are you okay, though?” She asked him, finally turning to look at him.
“God, that was so fucking hot,” Tony breathed, leaning into kiss his boyfriend. Steve giggled, sighing into the brunette’s mouth as their tongues caressed against each other.
“Fall back please,” Tony said in a more authoritative tone, kneeling then in front of the fear stricken merman. The sea creature flinched before eliciting a small noise that to Tony’s ears sounded like pain.
That smile and the midnight laugh she’s givin’ you now
“Oh,” Steve replied. “Well, it’s nice knowing another friendly face that’s on the same side. Someone trustworthy.”
Nibbling his bottom lip, Tony finally unwrapped the gift Steve gave him, and Tony couldn’t help but grin at the pun and Tesla. Tony’s heart pinched at the gift, and he was rather eager to use too. He washed it out and put it next his coffee maker for the morning.
“God, I’m getting old,” Tony said, stretching his back, which was aching now. Steve, still sitting on the bed, snaked his arms around Tony’s waist, peppering his back with open mouthed kisses.
“Sir?” J.A.R.V.I.S suddenly spoke, disrupting their intimacy. Steve’s body was lax, his chest heaving with each breath as Tony growled in annoyance.
“I guarantee you’ll fail miserably if you tried to set us up,” Steve laughed, looking at Tony with an easy smile. “Why do you ask though? Has someone new come along that you’ve grown fond of?” Steve asked then, and Tony couldn’t even lie to him. He looked up at the blonde and nodded, smiling sheepishly. “Oh, who’s the lucky lady? Steve inquired, smiling, though Tony could see that it didn’t meet his blue eyes. The brunette just brushed the question off. What would be the point of revealing his affections when clearly Steve was infatuated with another?
“You too, Stevie. Was this your best Easter EVER?” Tony asked.
Lacing his one hand with Tony’s, Steve placed an open mouthed kiss to the man’s knuckles. There was no smidge of doubt in his mind that Tony didn’t mean his words. Because Steve also knew his affection for the genius would never waver.
It didn’t take long before Steve was in sync with the genius, rocking himself forward and then slamming back against Tony’s pulsing hips. He moaned loudly, not caring if Tony’s igloo shaped haven wasn’t sound proof. Each thrust into Steve from the genius filled him, yet the blonde desired more, wishing to drown in Tony’s touch and presence. The blonde heard Tony moan breathlessly behind him, the brunette’s fingers digging into his muscles as they ascended toward their crescendo.
The last file he gazed upon was of Anthony E. Stark, Howard’s son. He resembled him remarkably, appearance and personality wise. Steve heard of this great Tony Stark, the mind behind an amazing contraption known as the Iron Man suit. Tony, like his father, was a genius and also had quite the playboy record, self-centered...
But by the fourth week of Tony relying on his feelings to go away, only to consider the idea that they in fact may not go away, Tony felt the panic rise within him once more.
“Ohhh,” Rhodes said, drawing out the word.
“Come baby, let me feel you,” The blonde whimpered out between raspy cries and moans, his mouth sinking to Tony’s neck. He sucked at that tawny skin, the blood vessels breaking from the pressure to leave a perfect love bruise.
“Oh, yes. I didn’t want anyone to see me as I made my way up here,” Steve explained, unzipping the hoodie he was wearing. He watched Tony watching him as he pulled the latch down, a deep navy garment slowly coming into view.
Maybe it was the footage he’d seen of Tony flashing a knowing grin, spewing sarcastic remarks and in the public eye during a recent court hearing that revealed how confident and cocky the brunette genius was.
Steve chuckled too, walking over to the area as well. “You’re just gonna come and make use of the coffee maker,” Steve teased.
“How is she? I haven’t seen her since before S.H.I.E.L.D fell.”
The best thing for him was to spend a few days alone in his lab. He could clear his head while he tinkered. Things would be alright.
“Hi Steve,” Tony replied, giving a half-hearted smile as he tried to walk past him and into the carriage.
happiness with the super soldier, and the knowledge of that happiness becoming a constant in his life was almost unfathomable.
Steve nosed his way underneath Tony’s aching erection and licked at the engorged vein, gilding his tongue from root to tip over the elevated ridge. The brunette’s beautiful whimpers and sighs of desperation only spurred Steve on as he kissed and sucked at each of Tony’s testicles, enjoying the slightly textured skin. He then licked at the seam down the middle of the man’s sac before he felt them tighten under his mouth. The super soldier immediately took Tony’s cock in between his lips once more, letting the shaft fill his mouth until his nose was brushing against the genius’s dark, trimmed pubic hair.
It was near sunset, the men catching a few small fish here and there as they tallied their numbers. Steve had three and Tony had four. It was a pretty close match, and they were about to call it a night when Steve’s bobber went under with an unexpected force.
The brunette gave the crown of his cock one more firm squeeze before tearing his boxers off the rest of the way. He grabbed Steve by his sides and flipped him onto his belly again, spreading Steve and grabbing at his ass roughly.
“Captain Rogers appears to be in his quarters, reading a novel,” J.A.R.V.I.S said, his voice echoing through the lab. Tony was tempted to have J.A.R.V.I.S bring up the camera feed of Steve’s room, but he refrained. He’d vowed never to nose into anyone’s privacy unless it was an emergency. Tony stood then, his half eaten sandwich in hand. A part of him wanted to go up to Steve’s floor, to tell him thanks for the food, maybe Tony would actually be okay with seeing and talking to Steve. Maybe he was making mountains out of mole hills; it wouldn’t be the first time he had done that.
At the front desk, an older man with a friendly smile was filling the minnow tank. He kindly showed both Steve and Tony how the fishing poles worked, probably judging them quietly for being so incompetent. Steve watched carefully how to tie the hooks and lures on, and listened intently when the man, who they learned was named Jerry, said what bait they should use depending on the fish they wanted to catch.
Steve was arriving that evening though, and the genius was excited to arrange this little treat for the man.
“But you never make me feel confined or smothered, Steve,” Tony added. “I hope I never make you feel that way.” Tony could never get enough of his love. Hell, he had his moments where all he wanted to do was work in the lab. But he’d drop that in a heartbeat for Steve. He watched the blonde’s features soften then as he took in Tony’s honest words.
“four? No, five, I think,” Steve admitted, his cheeks red as a cherry.
“Yeah, I know that,” Tony huffed, sounding annoyed. “Don’t you think I’d notice that detail?”
“I’ll be okay, just don’t touch me for a minute,” Steve tried to joke, though he sounded more whiney than anything.
“You seemed to have missed something,” Thor’s voice called, knocking Steve from his maudlin thinking. Steve looked back under the tree to see a cream envelope, his name scrawled out in Tony’s writing. He swallowed thickly, nerves heaping inside him. Steve was also shocked to think that the brunette had stationary laying around before wondering what the letter had read. Probably something along the lines of Tony wanting nothing to do with Steve.
“God, he’s adorable,” Tony said, reaching over to open up the one panel that acted as a door. “Are you lost?” Tony asked teasingly, a remarkable grin on his face as he looked up at his beloved.
“Wait, you said one hour…Stark?!” But before he could continue, Tony cut the line, chuckling into Steve’s shoulder. The blonde just sighed, patting Tony on the back.
“No, I haven’t. But what does it matter, Nat? Tony’s a socialite. He could meet up with her anywhere. It’s probably under wraps because he doesn’t want to be public about it yet,” Steve explained, the irritation surfacing in his voice. “It’s just getting harder and harder to contain my feelings for him.” Steve sighed, slumping his face into his hands as the redhead patted his shoulder.
Tony had tried to let it go, brushing it off as no big deal. He told himself it was because Pepper’s words were lingering in the back of his mind, about how he had affections towards Steve, nothing more.
“Shit, sounds a bit gruesome for a kid’s tale,” Tony commented.
“Would you just shut it for one damn second?” Tony asked, his voice soft, no anger in his tone. Steve looked at him with a surprised expression before drifting his gaze down to where their fingers intertwined. “That’s not why I got you this apartment and art studio,” Tony said, letting go of him then. He took hold of Steve’s chin and titled it so he met his eyes. “I did it because I knew you wanted a bigger art space. And because-” he saw Tony swallow thickly, his big doe eyes unwavering. “I’ve fallen in love with you too, Steve. And God, how I don’t want to see you move out of the Tower. Not one bit,” Tony confessed, his voice sounding a little shaky.
To most people, that probably was nothing. But to Steve, that was a significant amount of time. He hadn’t really been with anyone that long. Even with Peggy, they had tiptoed around their feelings for so long that the only thing that established their relationship was that cherished kiss she gave him before he leapt onto Red Skull’s plane.
The two men kissed for a while, their minds becoming lost to merely sensuous touch and sound. Tony eventually coaxed Steve to lay on his belly, the brunette laying on his side next to him.
“Anthony,” A gruff voice called out to the brunette, Tony turned lazily in the voice’s direction, his eyes still scanning over his documents.
During one of Steve’s explorations through the city, the blonde sat outside a local cafe, sketching a bit while sipping at a bold brewed coffee. He had a newspaper with him from that morning, though he had not read through it yet. He was in the midst of drawing the architectural landscape ahead of him when he decided to take a break and read the local listings. There was no rush, and Steve unhurriedly read the articles, some not so exciting, and others enthralling.
“What’d you have in mind?” Steve asked, attempting to get Tony out of those jeans, his fingers fumbling with the button and zipper.
“I am glad they made it this far,” Steve replied, setting the battered fabric aside then.
“What was that?” Nick inquired. “Nevermind, I don’t care. What the hell, Stark? You were supposed to be at the new S.H.I.E.L.D headquarters a half hour ago to discuss the new recruit program. And yet here I sit alone in my office.”
“C’mere,’ Steve mumbled, exhaustion from their love making as well as jet lag hitting him tenfold then. He pulled the brunette against him, the two of them snuggling affectionately under the thin sheet. “I love you, Tony,” Steve kissed Tony’s hair, looking up at the white string of lights above them.
Steve gasped softly into the heated kisses of his love, his erection straining and downright painful at this point. Wrapping his arms around Tony’s shoulders, Steve found himself rutting against the brunette’s hip, the need for release too great to stifle.
Steve rode his love a little longer before he laid against Tony, a hand cupping his cheek as he kissed him hungrily. Tony let out a frustrated whine, thrusting shallowly into Steve then, unable to get deep inside him with how Steve was laying on him.
“I’m happy to hear that. Because no one else can have you,” Tony remarked. Steve’s cheeks warmed at that. He liked Tony talking with such assertiveness, the idea of him being the brunette’s possession. Steve wrapped his hand around Tony’s back, his other hand holding onto the outside of the man’s thigh. Tony smiled down at him, his hands holding onto the back of the chair as he leaned in to devour Steve’s plush lips.
It wasn’t that they didn’t hardly see each other or anything, it was just hard having Tony away from him for almost a whole week.
“I do not,” Steve resented. “I wanted us to do it together.” Steve wiped down his body with some wipes he kept in his nightstand.
I wanna drown myself in a bottle of her perfume
When they made their way into the Byzantine section of the museum, Steve rubbed at the slight warm itch on his shoulder, right near where the muscle met his neck. He stopped in front of a gorgeous tempura altar piece as Nat and Sam went on. Steve thought of Stefanos and Antonius, and where their soul marks were.
“Alright, lavender it is.” Slowly, Tony leaned forward, his lips exploring over Steve’s faintly, and the blonde pressed his forehead against his beloved’s.
"He said you didn’t know anyone and that you could use the company," Tony replied plainly his dark eyes big as he looked up at Steve.
“Alright, either way, we need to stick to the mission. The residents in this creature’s path are our first priority before anything else,” Steve said, looking to Clint and Natasha. “Stark, analyze its strategy and pattern. Thor, find out its weak spots.” They worked out their tactics and strategy then, settling on one that they had used for similar situations.
“Just a little longer,” Steve cooed, turning Tony around so that he faced the back of the couch. The super solider slid to the floor, spreading Tony’s knees so that he could have clear view of the man’s entrance. Steve watched as the man’s hole, dark pink and waiting, clenched in front of his eyes. Steve wanted to taste it.
“I’m perfect,” he answered, bracing on his elbows and leaning in to kiss Tony. “You never make me feel like I’m anything less than perfect, Tony.” The brunette hummed at that, his dark eyes searching Steve’s calm blue ones. Steve needed to not get wrapped up in his head, even if his thoughts were about his love for Tony. He was here, presently with the sexiest, most handsome man in the universe! He needed to get it together.
“Thank you,” Steve murmured, leaning up then, turning his head to see his love.
THANK YOU FOR READING ALONG!
Tony assured himself this would all pass, and everything would be fine. This was merely just a bump in the road of his pothole filled, ‘roadwork ahead’ life.
Steve in his nightie, depicted beautifully by none other than Kelslk on Tumblr
Tony was on that brink of electric bliss, his movements jerking as his thighs quivered from exertion. Steve managed to grab a hold of the genius’s shoulder and pull him down, Tony losing his footing momentarily. The blonde kissed and licked at Tony’s lips, arching up against his boyfriend’s masculine chest, his dark facial hair tickling his chin. He threaded his fingers into the man’s dark tresses, tugging at it enough to yank another whine of ecstasy from Tony.
“So, what’s the good word,
The blonde fell back against the length of the couch, pulling Tony with him as they continued to kiss passionately. Steve could feel Tony continue to caress at his hardened penis, and he most certainly wanted to reciprocate the act, having Tony experience that sweet friction as well.
“Hi. Bruce,” Steve greeted back.
Steve held onto the man as if his life depended on it, thinking how he never wanted be apart from Tony for a week
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sorry Obi,” Tony said, brushing a hand through his thick dark hair. “Something doesn’t seem quite right. The statistics and information about their alternative energy is peculiar,” Tony explained, pointing to the documents that Hydra’s lead scientist, Arnim Zola gave him concerning their business. The younger man was trying to explain himself, but Obadiah ignored his worries and took a step forward, towering over Tony.
“Warriors down!” he heard Thor say, and Steve just shook his head and laughed as he and Tony sat up, brushing off the snow from their clothes.
Tony closed his eyes as well, the rise and fall of Steve’s gorgeous chest lulling him to sleep, the man’s heartbeat a relaxing, constant rhythm that reminded Tony of the calmness of the ocean waves as they sloshed upon the sand.
“Ahh! Steve!” Tony hissed out between clenched teeth, the sudden heat of his lover’s mouth intoxicating and overwhelming. He was going to propose Steve ride him, but the blonde seemed to have other ideas in mind. And Tony had no intention of telling the super soldier to stop.
“Love you most, Stevie,” Tony breathed, his voice pitching as the super soldier went to work unfastening the glass buttons that spaced down the brunette’s dress shirt. Tony didn’t say anything as he watched Steve’s fingers move, seeing the light of his reactor spill out once that black fabric fell away. The blonde leaned up, pressing his lips to the glowing blue face of the arc reactor. Though he could not feel the sensation of Steve’s lips on it, Tony still shivered, humbled at how it never bothered Steve, grateful for the way Steve loved all of him, metal bits and all.
“Oh,” was all Tony said, and he knew Steve didn’t bring up Howard to upset him on purpose. Though, in the beginning, before they had settled their differences and became friends, Tony was positive Steve brought up happy stories with Howard just to piss Tony off. It always worked too.
“Uh, Steve…what’re you doing?” Tony asked after a moment. And then Steve was shifting his own Stark pad, maneuvering it between his spread legs and angling it up.
“Do it. Fuck yourself,” Tony encouraged, eyes wide in both awe and lust, hungry for whatever Steve would do to himself. “Let me watch you please yourself, baby.” Steve looked at him, holding his gaze before smiling sweetly at Tony.
Steve moved with his boyfriend, feeling the way he pounded into him, loving the pain, loving all of it because it was Tony. He whined each time Tony rubbed against his prostate with the tip of his cock, his eyes pinned on Tony’s face.
After Tony worked the fifth bead in though, Steve felt a decent amount of pressure in his opening, catching him off guard by the slightly stronger sensation.
“Lavender?” the genius asked, making sure Steve was positive on his choice. The blonde nodded assuredly.
“Ah, come on, Tony,” Steve teased, lifting his hips so Tony could undo the clasps on the back of his thighs. “You’re a genius. Can’t manage to take off lingerie?” Tony just looked at him with a quirked brow, unlatching the final clasp, pulling the garter belt away and dropping it to the floor.
The room seemed to be 100 degrees hotter, and even the lightest of fabric of his nightie seemed too much. Steve lifted the garment over his head then, tossing it somewhere near the foot of the bed.
Stepping inside, Steve felt his mouth drop. It was the fanciest lobby he had ever been to in Brooklyn. He couldn’t imagine what the apartments themselves looked like. Steve pondered if this was Tony’s not so subtle hint that Steve needed to get out of the Tower and find a new place to live permanently. The genius knew that he was indeed looking for a place to stay at once and a while.
Steve sat his gym bag in one of the closets in his apartment before spotting a debriefing packet on his kitchen table. The blonde made himself a cup of coffee on the stove before settling himself in a chair to review the mission to retrieve the tesseract. There would be other members involved on this mission, Steve realized as he thumbed through the different profiles in the file. They were all rather fascinating figures. There was a lovely red headed woman who had an impressive record with SHIELD, as well as a man who could turn into a gigantic, green and muscular being.
Steve opened his eyes to darkness, alone in his bed. It was overwhelmingly hot in his room and he tossed the sheets off of him. He sat up, only to feel the painful arousal that throbbed under his pajama pants. Steve groaned, annoyed as he fell back against the mattress. That was one vivid dream, everything seemed so real. Steve bit his lip, breathing deeply as he tried with all his might not to shove his hand down his pants and ease the ache. He felt guilty of course for dreaming that, something so intimate of his dear friend. It wasn’t the first time he had these dreams with Tony in them. But they usually weren’t that descriptive.
“Okay!” Steve called, sliding under the car while Tony lifted the hood to reveal the engine. The genius too began his work, removing the wires from the ends of the spark plugs, only to grab his socket wrench to loosen them. Tony thought about Steve loving someone else once more. Well, at least he didn’t ask Steve out like Rhodey originally mentioned. Because then, he more than likely wouldn’t be sharing this moment with Steve. The blonde would have shot him down faster than a speeding bullet, only to then avoid Tony like the plague, and this wonderful friendship they had established would be all for naught. Tony couldn’t deny it left him sour, knowing he couldn’t have Steve the way he wished to, but at least he had him as a great friend.
"Is it Pepper?" Bruce went on.
Steve was practically speed walking away from Tony who had been scolding him since they left the debriefing room. Unfortunately, Steve couldn’t avoid the man when they both needed to use the elevator. Tony really should have more than one private elevator for the Avengers’ floors. He’d tried to be calm and collected while Tony’s fiery personality surfaced from the depths, but Steve was fed up with Tony calling him reckless.
“Uhn,” Steve moaned slowly, his knees falling open even more, biting his lip as he felt Tony’s tongue explore his length. What the man could do to him always left Steve breathless. He looked down to see Tony’s head bob up and down around him, the warmth of his mouth so inviting for Steve to thrust up into. He wanted more of that heat, as greedy as it made him seem. Steve grasped a hand in Tony’s hair, disheveling it as he stroked his fingers through it. He could feel the coil building within his lower belly, his testicles drawing tight as he neared climax. When Tony began to fondle his sac, his tongue licking his penis from root to tip, Steve lost it, his body tensing, eyes drawn tight as he came into his love’s hot mouth. He felt Tony swallow, drinking the warm ropes of come down as Steve thrusted a little roughly into his mouth.
One late morning, Steve awoke to Tony bringing him breakfast, the brunette smiling that pearly grin when he saw Steve awake.
“Hold on there, babe,” Tony said, his breathing light and airy. “I feel like we should talk about a few things,” he chuckled softly then, reaching for the container that held the intimate toy. “I can’t say I was expecting our love life to go down this route,” Tony began, biting his bottom lip and opening the box.
“What?” Steve asked, though he easily heard him with his heightened hearing.
“What is it?” Tony asked, his worried tone genuine. He could see that the blonde was upset, and Tony needed to know how to fix it. Steve sat up then, sitting cross legged on the bed. The brunette sat up too, waiting for Steve to speak.
Steve gripped Tony’s thighs when he felt his beloved’s lips and teeth on his behind, the sensation so wonderful it made the super soldier light headed, his cock drooling with pre-release onto Tony’s bare chest. He didn’t think his love would really care at all; Steve would clean him up after all was said and done regardless.
“Of course.”
Natasha made a bowl of popcorn, the two of them devouring it 15 minutes into the movie. Towards the end of the flick, Natasha had her head resting on his shoulder, her eyes eyelids heavy. It wasn’t late, but Steve hadn’t seen her all day. He wondered if she had a quick mission.
“I will,” Steve offered, his hands slipping under the fabric of Tony’s underwear, his fingers digging into the meat of each cheek before helping the brunette wiggle out of them. He threw them to the floor with the rest of their garments. “Besides, I have been doing some research on it, and-”
But when he opened his eyes once more and met Steve’s stare, looking so sweet and surprisingly innocent as he eagerly sucked his length and stroked him with a strong fist, Tony lost himself. A frantic groan escaped him as his orgasm consumed him, and Steve drank every drop of white release as if it was water, and he had been a parched man.
Eventually Tony went off to work on his projects, Pepper coming down at one point to talk of business matters. Yet, Tony's mind kept falling to the soulmate story, and if that meant he would have a soulmate all his own. It was as if his childhood self and the innocent hope he once had reappeared inside his heart once again.
Tony hissed out a groan, his fingernails digging into Steve’s sides. “Feels good doesn’t it?” The blonde asked smugly, watching Tony’s face wash over with ecstasy.
“Sleep well, Tony,” Steve whispered, laying a hand on one of Tony’s pecs.
“Yes, Tony,” Steve responded, his voice breathy and slightly winded from his climax still. Steve smiled tiredly when he felt Tony shift above him, the genius’s lips finding their way to Steve’s damp hairline. The brunette kissed the super soldier’s temple, his hands slipping down Steve’s neck and to the slope of his shoulders. Even though Steve’s body felt heavy, the blonde managed to lift an arm and place his hand on his beloved’s.
Tony quickly found himself in his lab, asking J.A.R.V.I.S to put up the specs for the incorrect formula.
“Fair enough. Though I am curious to know what your search history looks like.” Tony joked, rolling them over so Steve was on his back. “On a semiserious note. I know we are both clean,” Tony said, opening his bedside table drawer and grabbing out an unused lube. Steve didn’t miss taking in his fill of his boyfriend’s cock, appreciating how it was slightly tanner than Steve’s own, curving beautifully and dripping with precome. He also realized that though Tony’s penis was a little shorter than his, the brunette’s was thicker around, which meant Steve would be filled and stretched wonderfully by his boyfriend’s arousal.
