“In the fifteen years that I’ve worked at this inn, I’ve only seen him during the twelve days leading up to Christmas.”
As the images around him slowly began dissipating into ambiguous blurs of blue again, Tony looked up to see who had been calling out to him. It was Steve again, but instead of that unfamiliar uniform, his copilot was back in his drive suit, hand outstretched in Tony’s direction. It wasn’t some strange doppelganger this time, it was his Steve. He looked… shaken in a way Tony had never seen from him before, a mix of desperation and horror clouding Steve’s clear blue eyes. Finally, the cold that had tried to settle itself in Tony’s bones faded away, something that tasted like shame bubbling up within him as he came back to reality.
to stop doing that, it’s bad for my heart. Wait, you just said ‘it’s a curse’ and actually meant it.”
“Is this some sort of game to you?” He demanded, nostrils flaring and jaw clenched tightly enough that the sight of it made Tony’s teeth hurt.
“It’s almost four in the afternoon,” Steve tried to reason with him. “You should give sleeping like a normal human a chance for once tonight.”
“Damn, now I want a burger. Do you know if there’s anywhere in this backwards ass town that sells them?”
There wasn’t a purple human-sized cat tower, but later that week Tony did give Clint some new arrows, including an improved boomerang arrow.
He wasn’t sure how much time had passed when he eventually closed out his projects for the night (err, morning?). He had lost track while finishing up a couple of SI things that were due soon.
He opened his mouth to object again, but Steve stood up from the table and quietly walked towards the door. He stopped in front of the doorway and looked back over his shoulder at Tony, making eye contact with him.
“Though I’m not even good with the more durable ones, like gods or super soldiers, especially not when the super soldier has a habit of jumping from buildings or planes without a parachute. Or using themselves as a human shield.”
Knowing his best asset aside from his face was well… his ass, Tony turned his back to Steve and planted his feet rather far apart, then he twisted his back as far as he could to try to maybe get a bit of his chest showing, too. His balance was a little wobbly, but sometimes sacrifices had to be made in the name of art. He anchored his hands on his hips for lack of anything else to do with his arms (and perhaps the support was actually needed a bit). Yeah. Composition, that was an art thing, right? Dynamic angles and all that jazz.
“I prefer to give him his privacy,” was the innkeeper’s cryptic response as he walked out the front door.
There was a sharp series of knocks at the door that disrupted Tony’s thoughts, and he groaned and rolled over, pulling the sheets over his head in preparation for what he knew was coming next.
liked pizza.” Oh god, did Coulson just tell a joke? Forget ghosts, Tony had somehow entered into the Twilight Zone when he stepped foot into this godforsaken place.
He was already out the door by the time Tony called out, “I definitely would not be opposed to that.”
That was the man Tony had come to know over the course of the past few weeks. Rogers had been a little cold and distant at first, but Tony was nothing if not persistent, and he eventually wore down the shield Steve had put up to protect himself.
Steve became a little less nervous over the course of dinner, which tasted just as good as it had smelled, though Tony guessed it made sense that he would be a decent cook after taking care of his mother.
The next day, Tony cornered Steve in the small study that was down the hall. The man was reading a book that was so dog-eared it looked like he had maybe read it about sixty times. Tony sat down on an armchair directly across the room from him and decided to just leap right in without testing the waters first.
He could feel Steve move to get up, and he tried not to whine at the loss of contact and warmth once the other man was upright.
“I closed down the weapons division of the company, decided to focus on green energy and biotech— prosthetics, that kinda stuff, but we’re taking a massive hit for it. Much bigger than Pepper and I had calculated, so we’re trimming down any and all excess things to try to prevent layoffs. Ya know, liquidate anything unnecessary to help cushion the blow. For some reason, this is actually a Stark Industries property.”
“This could entirely change how we should be going about trying to close the damned breach.” He hastily ran a hand through his hair. “We’ve been going about it the wrong way this whole time.”
He flopped onto the bed, collapsing onto the surprisingly soft pillows. “Yeah, I’m gonna help him figure out whatever weird voodoo, lingering regrets, whatever is keeping him stuck here… Then he’ll like, move on or whatever, and we can sell this place, and I’ll never have to come back here again.”
Things had been going well, much better than Tony had admittedly expected. Their teamwork had been fantastic even when they had been tossed together in the middle of a world-threatening crisis, but now that the Avengers had lived together for a little over a year, their teamwork was, dare he say, flawless.
One evening they somehow all had managed to be around for dinner, so Steve helped Bruce throw something together for a rare team meal. Orion was perched on Tony’s chair when the man found his way to the kitchen, already doing his Puss in Boots impersonation and begging for handouts.
Subconsciously, Tony’s tongue darted out to wet his lips. “I’d be willing to give it a try, you know, if you are, too. For science.”
“...he’s got one of those, too. Better than the worthless junk vets use. For all his whining that he’s ‘not that kind of doctor,’ Bruce helped with it.”
“Here, can you make a face like this?” Clint showed him an image on his phone of a… samurai holding a cat.
“Huh? My what?” He cocked his head questioningly at Steve, but then he realized what the man had meant. “Oh! Pepper. Oh, no. No, she’s not my girlfriend. I mean, she’s the most amazing woman I know, and I love her, but she’s one of my best friends. And my personal assistant, though I keep telling her that she should be CEO instead of me.”
“Sure,” the man answered hesitantly, like he was still trying to figure out what the hell was happening.
“How reassuring.” He could practically hear Pepper roll her eyes. Maybe he really should work on more self-defense stuff like Happy kept bugging him about.
There was another one of those armor suits like he had seen in the first of Steve’s memories, though this time the person inside appeared to be a dark-haired woman. He supposed that was a bit less jarring than seeing his own face. A glimpse at a wedding program in one of the guest’s hand made Tony freeze in place.
Once the cookies cooled off, decorating didn’t go much better for Tony, despite having steady hands from all of the soldering and detail work he was used to doing on his projects. They were all turning out a little… wonky. Steve’s, of course, were all perfect, though he hadn’t really expected any less from the artist.
Honestly, the whole thing couldn’t possibly be good for Tony’s health with all the pounding his heart kept doing around Steve. He felt like he was going to develop arrhythmia.
Tony felt as if he desperately needed to change the subject to salvage the easygoing mood from a few minutes before. Things had been going a lot better with Steve since that morning, and he really didn’t want to fuck that up like he usually did with good things (and just when did he start to think of Steve as a good thing? Oh man, Pepper was gonna kick his ass).
“Oh! That’s— okay, yeah, no, that’s as nice as I thought it would be. Maybe nicer.” Steve felt Tony’s arms wrap around him as the shorter man buried his face into Steve’s shoulder. “Definitely nicer.”
Tony jolted upright in bed with a gasp, blinking the fuzziness out of his vision as he looked around his room.
Before Carol opened the door, she pointed in mock-threat at Tony. “You’ve got five minutes to look presentable or else I’m dragging you down to the mess hall in your sheets.”
Once he was up, Tony noticed that Steve had apparently at some point taken off his pants and was only in his boxers and that sinfully tight t-shirt. Holy
Steve ignored his attempted interruption. “Everything you’ve done… you’ve given me back more than I could ever have imagined. I know you’re worried about me.” He swallowed thickly before continuing, obviously pushing down emotions threatening to spill over. “I’ll be able to manage.”
before), but the assailant used his momentum to slam him against a concrete beam, the impact knocking the air out of his lungs.
Soon after, Steve returned with two cups of coffee. Forget super soldier, this man was some kind of super angel.
It was never any use trying to lie to Pepper. “A little,” he confessed with a sniffle. “I just… I thought we’d made a lot of progress, and we
Tony shot him an incredulous look. “Have you ever even had a pet? They’re like little gremlin children, except worse because they can’t communicate in human languages.”
Finally, they found something. A report about an accident at the lake in front of the house dated  December the seventeenth.
He didn’t seem to know what to do with that. In front of him was the true Tony Stark, caught slightly off guard with his masks down, looking at Steve like he was some sort of puzzle he’d been trying to solve.
While Steve was fixing his own breakfast, Bruce and Tony wandered in, having a fast-paced discussion about some theory they were going to test. Judging by Tony’s already empty coffee mug, the genius was emerging to refuel rather than actually waking up that early in the morning.
Steve wasn’t around the entire day, most likely still holed up in his room, and Tony guessed that technically ghosts didn’t actually have to eat or anything like that. It felt kind of wrong to be puttering around the house without Steve there with him.
“Yeah, no. That was an absolutely terrible idea.” Tony confessed as he all but fell over when he let go of the pose.
“Yeah, yeah. I’m a slave driver, I get it. No fun allowed.” Tony feigned annoyance at his bot while Steve burst into laughter at the whole scene. “I get no respect here, from my bots or from you.”
Tony fondly rolled his eyes at his friend, but he couldn’t help but respond with a crude joke about wanting the ghost to bust him, which earned a suffering groan from Rhodey.
Tony channeled his shock into pure determination to create his own Steve gingerbread man. Thankfully, they’d mixed up some yellow icing to use for the star-shaped cookies, so Tony carefully squeezed some onto a cookie, trying to replicate Steve’s swoopy hairstyle. He had just finished the gingerbread man’s pants when he felt Steve rest his chin on his shoulder to watch.
“Well, look who it is. Am I always—” Thor stops and takes in their current state. “Am I interrupting?”
“Do you live here, too?” Steve couldn’t help but smile at the cat as he brushed up against his leg. He’d never seen the little guy around the tower before, but it wasn’t like it would be that hard to miss such a small inhabitant in such a massive building. Hell, sometimes he went days without seeing Thor or even hearing his overwhelming presence in the tower.
Steve rolled his eyes again in fond exasperation, and Tony’s heart was pounding as they raced down the hallway together towards the command center.
“You know, I’m just going to talk even more now if that’s the reward I get,” Tony playfully grins at him, and Steve’s eyes crinkle as he returns the smile.
“You’ve got the whole country fooled with this wholesome image of yours. But I know the truth.” Tony punctuated his sentence with a half-hearted point in Steve’s direction. “You, are a little shit, Steve Rogers.”
The man in the form-fitting suit caught Tony’s attention more than the others. He was knelt next to the man in the suit, clearly at a loss as to what he should do. His movements, his shoulders… the man reminded him so much of Steve that Tony started taking steps forward without even realizing it.
“So, was that a one time deal or…?” He doesn’t finish his question, waiting for Steve to add in what he truly wants to hear.
He saved his work and flicked the monitors closed before awkwardly walking over to the side of the workshop where Steve was sitting with his sketchpad.
He’s almost afraid to look away. Afraid that if he does, it’ll all turn out to be just another dream, and Steve won’t be at his side when he looks again.
That afternoon, he and Clint teamed up to take their fluffy friend to get a check-up at a nearby vet and see if he was microchipped. Since they didn’t have a carrier or even a harness, Steve had to carry the cat the entire time, but to his surprise, he just settled in like he belonged there.
“Do you believe me now?” A voice called from the house behind Tony. He whipped around to find Steve waving at him from the doorstep.
The space was small, even more so with the dozens and dozens of boxes towering along the sides of the attic. He noticed Steve was having to duck down to avoid smacking his head on the rafters, and it was honestly kind of cute. Lots of things that Steve did were cute, and it was starting to be a problem for Tony.
Tony could hear the cat “mrrr” in response as he darted to his food bowl ahead of Steve, and he had to choke back laughter at the scene. He wasn’t sure who was being cuter, but Steve was definitely giving Orion a run for his money in Tony’s opinion.
“And well...” He shifted his weight back and forth for a second, awkwardly scratching the back of his neck before he continued. “With it being illegal and all, there weren’t really a whole lotta guys who would take their chances just to be with me.”
Once they reached each other, Tony threw his arms around Steve’s neck, and strong arms scooped him up, spinning Tony around in a crushing hug. When Steve set him back down, Tony grabbed him by the face, squishing his cheeks as the blond continued to smile adorably.
“So, uhh… does that happen often?” He asked, fiddling with his coffee mug that he’d set on the table.
It was the night of Valentine’s Day, and most of the other Avengers were out or just doing their own thing for the evening. Meanwhile, Steve was lounging on the couch in the living room with Orion asleep on his lap, watching whatever ridiculous romcom movie he’d come across while flipping through the channels.
“Okay, yeah, leaky Kaiju, kinda gross, but anyway— the breach could be causing a ripple effect with nearby quantum universes, and that’s why your horribly close encounter triggered these memories, most likely from the proximity to the Kaiju so soon after it had crossed through the breach.”
At some point while they were icing the cookies, the two men had devolved into randomly smearing the colorful icing on whatever part of each other they could reach. It was becoming something of a competition to see who could one-up the other. There were smudges of icing all across their faces; Tony could feel some of it drying in his facial hair, but he had retaliated for that one with a nice red glob on Steve’s cheek. At one point, they had pretty much forgotten about icing the gingerbread cookies entirely, and it had turned into some sort of playful tussling match.
Pepper laughed and said she would, then ended the call. Tony just laid there for a while, his phone still in hand, staring up at the ceiling.
And because Tony had truly excellent people skills, as he was frequently reminded by Pepper, he ruined the mood entirely with his next question.
Nice Shoulders Guy from the Photograph looked up at Tony, beautiful blue eyes staring directly at him for a moment before he focused on his food, which was only kinda unnerving, really. “Why are you here? There aren’t supposed to be any guests after the twelfth.”
And who else would be so full of energy and… morning person-ness before the sun was even fully up? It was wearing Tony out just to watch him.
“Jarvis, our butler, was always the one who put up a tree, but I went to boarding school, so most of the time I wasn’t there when he did it.” Wow, that sounded sad. Steve was definitely frowning now, and Tony thought it was endearing that the man seemed to be upset for him. “Don’t worry, Coulson swung by earlier and helped me pick out the tree. There was no way that was gonna fit on top of the Audi.”
And honestly, Tony was downright thrilled that Rogers had been picked to be his copilot. He was the only one who had managed to match Tony one-for-one in the combat room. Rogers never put up with anyone’s bullshit, from Tony’s endless teasing to any of the bullies within the Jaeger Program. Tony found himself naturally drawn to the man, and even though they butted heads occasionally, Tony was captivated by the man’s dry humor and his drive to protect the earth from Kaiju. He might have been a bit vocal about his opinion on who should be his partner, but Tony needed someone who would help keep him on the right path, and for him… Steve Rogers was that person.
The corner of his mouth ticked up as if Tony had said something funny. “I think it was the vase that was on the bookshelf actually.”
“It’s…” Tony started, with a tired sigh. “It’s a little frightening when something so small and… defenseless depends on you for safety.”
He should have known his day was about to get a lot worse when Pepper came into his office with coffee and doughnuts from his favorite bakery a few blocks away.
Figuring that the tone had changed enough to approach the subject, Tony decided to try asking about the incident with the art supplies in the attic. Surprisingly enough, Steve actually relented and began to explain how in all of the years that the curse had brought him back to the inn, he had never been able to touch his drawing set. Eventually, he‘d given up trying because every time his hand slipped through the cases, it stung just that much more.
And Tony missed this, missed Steve and how easy being around him used to be. Part of him hated how lately he constantly locked himself away in the workshop, but he had kinda committed to being an asshole about the cat, hadn’t he?
Without another word, Tony rushed out of the kitchen, coffee now forgotten, dragging Steve by the wrist. He managed to wiggle into his shoes without letting go of Steve but thought ‘screw it’ when he looked at his coat.
He made an attempt to explain it anyway, the mysterious memories he had seen in the drift, the subsequent nightmares, and the few theories he had been tossing around at that point. Rhodey and Carol listened intently, not offering any words of doubt despite the whole thing being (quite frankly) absolutely unbelievable. But that was just how the pair was, and Tony was forever grateful to have them in his life.
“Well, see, I’m not really a guest. Technically the owner, but hopefully not for much longer. Just gotta find an appraiser around here who won’t hightail it outta here at the first creak of a floorboard.” The guy had stopped shoveling food into his mouth, and his full attention was on Tony. Now it was definitely unnerving. “Normally there are people who take care of this stuff, but I think my PA is exacting revenge on me for accidentally almost subjecting her to an allergy attack.”
“Sure you are,” Steve teased him, but Tony could tell he was enjoying the attention from the was he was practically preening.
“You can keep telling yourself that all you want, but you can’t keep beating yourself up over something that happened seventy years ago,” Tony couldn’t help but snap back, annoyed at Steve’s martyr complex.
“Tony, no, I can’t ask that of you,” Steve protested, reaching up to gently hold Tony’s face with his hands. “You deserve so much more than just twelve days a year. Please don’t throw away your chance at happiness just for me. Don’t let this curse take your future, too.”
Of course Tony expected that Rogers would bring memories of his final mission with Barnes into the drift, but the man’s tone seemed to imply more than that. It left Tony feeling a bit unsteady under Rogers’s gaze, unable to even begin to parse what he could mean by his statement.
Eventually, the conversation wound down after a few hours, and Steve pushed his chair back from the table and got up, “I made you something.”
“So when was the last time you decorated a tree? The forties? Did they still use actual burning candles back then?” Tony asked jokingly as he handed another ornament to Steve carefully. The man didn’t get annoyed by Tony’s jokes as much anymore, instead just smiling at him exasperatedly, and it was doing funny things to Tony’s heart.
He let out a long sigh before answering the question. “Actually, I already knew they had never found… my body. Bucky had said there wasn’t a funeral, and that there wasn’t… a gravesite to visit, or anything.” Tony tensed at that.
He can’t even begin to parse all the emotions he’s experiencing in that moment; everything was all mixed up in one awful jumble that he couldn’t even begin to untangle. Grief and loss mixed in with the relief that maybe Steve was somewhere much better now, with something like love tying all of the pain and happiness together.
“Uh, hello to you, too, Tony? Is everything alright? You sound terrible.” Pepper asked, sounding concerned.
“That’s why I hole myself up down here so often.” He dragged a hand down his face as he looked around at his ongoing projects around the workshop. “I can make gear that’ll keep the team safer out on missions. If you were to get hurt when I could’ve done something to prevent it, that’s on me.”
“You drew this…” Steve quickly nodded at him, looking like he was about to overflow with giddiness. “This is incredible, Steve.”
It seemed that in the months following the Chitauri invasion and the Avengers moving into Stark Tower, Steve had been spending more and more time in the workshop lately. Tony hadn’t quite figured out the reason behind it yet, but he certainly wasn’t going to complain about having company. But drawing the bots and all of the other mechanical equipment had to get old after a while. Wouldn’t a more… organic subject be more Steve’s cup of tea? Like some trees or some shit. They totally had trees in the 40’s.
“No, it’s okay. I know I’m a stubborn ass, and I let my emotions get the best of me that day,” Steve waved it off easily, as if somehow reliving his death wasn’t that big of a deal. “Don’t blame yourself for it. It wasn’t nearly as bad as it can get.”
“Speaking of the future…” Steve’s expression changed, becoming more reserved, as if he were actually going to be cautious with his next words. Of course, because they couldn’t get through a single conversation without one of them ruining the mood, Steve’s next words were: “Why are you selling the inn? Surely you of all people don’t need the money.”
Hesitantly, Steve reached out and cradled Tony’s face in his hand, gently brushing his thumb over his cheek. When Tony looked back at him, tears were starting to form in those beautiful blue eyes.
“I’ve always been a smartass if you ask...” Steve trailed off and there was a distant look to his eyes, as if he was in another time. Well, that wouldn’t be inaccurate, would it? There was a heaviness to his smile, and things grew quiet between them for a moment.
Tony shared some stories about the bots back home, and Dum-E’s increasingly tragic attempts at making smoothies (“One of these days he’s going to poison me, I swear.”), and also fondly recalled some wild tales of the shit he and Rhodey got up to at MIT.
“Oh no, I know that voice.” Rhodey let out a long-suffering sigh. “Am I going to be giving a dead man the shovel talk?”
“Oh, shit.” He could hear Pepper frantically asking if he was okay as books started to tumble down, making a shit ton of noise as they hit the floor around his feet.
Steve rolled his eyes at Tony and wow, did he just get sassed by a ghost? You know, if they even did exist.
When they separated after a while, Steve murmured something about going to his room, so Tony went back to his own and immediately grabbed his phone to call Pepper. He worried about leaving Steve by himself after what had happened, but there was something important he had to take care of immediately.
“No, you don’t have to do that for me.” His voice was soft but surprisingly steady, all things considered.
“All that worrying will make you age early, honeybear. You’ve seen what it’s done to Obama,” Tony tried to lighten the mood. “I’ll be fine.”
“Hey, JARVIS, make a note to get some food and water for him down here. Just because I forget to eat doesn’t mean he needs to follow my example.”
“Steve, I swear to you, we will figure this out. I’ll keep looking for answers while you’re not here, and when you get back, we’ll figure it out.” The words were just pouring out of him, promises that Tony would do anything to keep. “Even if… even if we never figure it out, I’ll keep coming back to you. I’m not going to leave you here alone, I promise.”
The idea came to Tony one day while Steve was quietly sketching in his workshop as he tinkered with some improvements to Barton’s grappling arrows. He was beyond tired of having to catch that dumbass out of midair because of his taste for freefalling to his death, and like hell he’d have Fury on his ass for any Hawkeye pancakes.
Steve, who apparently had a talent for putting Tony at a loss for words, chimed in again. “To be honest, I don’t really have much of a personal connection to this place.” Tony couldn’t hold back a laugh at that, considering the man was literally tied to the inn through a curse. Steve gave him a small smile. “I mean it. All I did was help out my aunt around the place for the few years Ma and I lived here. It’s not like I grew up here or anything sentimental like that.”
“What can I say, I sympathize with strays.” Clint nonchalantly provided. “We can have shared custody, Steve.”
Tony was about to fire a comment back at her, but his mouth snapped shut and he left the room without another word.
At one point Steve picked up a little feathery bird toy he thought he saw the cat eyeing on the shelf, and Clint let out a dramatic gasp, “Are you trying to turn our child against me?”
Time, that wasn’t something that they had much of. Tomorrow could very well be his last day with Steve… unless he came back to the inn the next year.
“It was the 1940’s, not the 1800’s,” Steve finally answered as he stood up from the table, patience wearing thin.
Coulson shook his head as he finally sat down at the table with his breakfast, too. “Unfortunately, I don’t think I’d be capable of making this one up.”
it necessary? Tony didn’t really know anymore. He probably should have looked at the numbers closer before agreeing to this whole thing, but he hadn’t wanted to even deal with it in the first place. He really was bad about that, not wanting to deal with all the boring business and numbers side of S.I., just burying himself in his workshop and only surfacing when Pepper forced him. That was what landed them here in the first place.
Tony had been in the command center dozens upon dozens of times when pilots were preparing to drift for the first time, and the words coming across the speaker system were familiar as they went through procedures ingrained in his memory. The pilots’ suits were hooked into the Jaeger’s system, and Tony took a deep breath as the officer in mission control began a countdown until the drift was initiated.
Steve gave him a small smile, but he remained quiet and let Tony continue. He wasn’t really certain why Tony was sharing this information with him, but he absolutely was not going to take such a moment for granted.
The next morning, Tony was very groggily standing in front of the coffee maker, waiting for it to dispense the nectar of the gods that would help him get through another day when Steve surprised him by suddenly appearing by his side. Well, he didn’t really just
Steve had been relieved when Natasha had agreed to help him put the little gel caps on Orion’s claws to keep him from scratching things. He’d been worried about somehow accidentally hurting the cat during the process, but Natasha’s very specific skillset apparently included expertly trimming cat claws and putting caps on them.
Of course, Steve was already waiting for him there (because he was definitely the type to be early for everything, which would normally annoy Tony but instead it was just… endearing). The blond was wearing a nice dark blue dress shirt, and Tony couldn’t help but wonder where he’d been hiding
“There wasn’t a whole lot I could really do when I was young, couldn’t go outside as much as the other kids on account of bein’ sick all the time ‘n all. So I ended up drawing a lot. It was a nice way to escape even when I couldn’t go anywhere.” Tony had noticed that any time Steve started reminiscing about his childhood, traces of Brooklyn would start to come through in his accent, and he absolutely loved it. Steve probably wasn’t even aware it was something he did.
For some reason, Tony immediately felt his defenses go up reflexively. “Did you finally do your homework on me?” He asked, playfulness gone from his voice.
He was rediscovering the things that he loved that he hadn’t had time for back during the war, and also discovering new things that he loved in the present. New… people who he loved, too. Steve was grateful that their cat had given him a reason to spend more time with Tony and see sides of him that were usually hidden under layers of self-preservation.
As Tony blearily blinked his eyes open, his surroundings finally swam into view through the blinding morning light coming in through the windows. He was laid out on the couch in the living room of the house with a blanket thrown over him. Oh, and a killer headache.
He used his foot to kick open the front door of the inn, hands too busy helping to wrangle the tree across the snowy yard. His shoes were soaked through, he was covered in prickly, little pine needles, and he was starting to deeply regret picking out such a large tree at the lot in town.
“Yeah, well, even if you can be a bit of an ass, you’re at least self-aware about it.” Tony’s mouth suddenly felt very dry, and he closed the sketchbook before setting it down on the desk. “But you don’t deserve whatever this is— being stuck here.”
Rhodey quietly closed the door to Tony’s room before pulling over a nearby chair next to Tony’s bed and sitting in it. “So… what happened in there, Tones?”
“You just wanted to shut me up,” Tony pouts, sticking out his bottom lip. He definitely notices how Steve’s eyes quickly flick down to his mouth.
Pepper sighed again. “Just keep me updated then. I’ll let you know if I find an appraiser brave enough to face this terrifying... ‘hot ghost.’”
“This looks a lot like moping to me,” Carol joked as she gestured to Tony wrapped up in his bedsheets like a burrito, hair sticking out in random directions from rolling around for so many hours.
That was when Tony interjected. “Steve, if he died in the war, that had to have been seventy years ago. All this time and you haven’t kept looking for a solution…?”
It wasn’t often that all of the Avengers had breakfast together, but it did happen occasionally, and today was apparently one of those days. When Steve had returned from his morning run, he found Clint perched on top of the refrigerator, eating cereal. He nodded in greeting at the archer as he got a carton of orange juice out of the fridge.
There was a pounding in his chest, mixed with a fluttery pitter-patter, and his mind kept drifting to Tony and his breathtaking smile, and…
“It might be a little too late for that,” he admitted, worrying his bottom lip with his teeth. He knew she was right, but there wasn’t a whole lot he could do about it now.
There was a group of oddly dressed people worriedly gathered around a motionless figure in some sort of mechanical suit on the dusty street. Tony squinted as he took in their appearances; a man with a flowing cape, another man in a form-fitting suit that was a bit… patriotic and star-spangly, and a creature that looked like Frankenstein’s monster on steroids.
When Steve’s lips finally met his, it was like fireworks, though maybe that was just the sound of the siren blaring throughout the Shatterdome. His lips were softer than Tony had imagined, and Tony wanted to get lost in Steve’s gentle touches forever, he wanted
He looks a little bit older, another reminder of those five years. For someone who’s been in a coma for the past five years, Steve still somehow manages to look good. Tony is trying to keep his eyes from wandering too much and doing his best to not focus on the wires still attached to Steve’s body. They’re a terrible reminder of what was happening to their beloved captain while everyone had thought him to be gone.
Then there was a brilliant flash of light as a beam emanated from the armor’s chest and blew off the Winter Soldier’s arm, causing him to collapse to the ground.
Tony looked a little dazed before he turned back to his worktable, and Steve was almost certain his own face was red as he made his way over to the couch in the corner, where he’d left behind a sketchbook the last time he visited Tony. Orion followed him and hopped up onto the couch beside him, suddenly transfixed by the pencil moving as he drew, swatting at it occasionally.
have a cheeseburger, multiple ones, at that. Hey, did they have cheeseburgers back when you were alive?” It was painfully obvious Tony was getting on his nerves, but really that was just encouragement to keep going. “Possibly the greatest invention of all time, food-wise at least.”
“Are you hungry, angel?” Steve asked, even though the answer was obvious by the way the cat was pacing the kitchen.
Steve looked downright nervous, even though Tony had literally admitted his own sexuality just minutes before. Tony hated that the world had ever made Steve have to hide that part of himself.
What he had seen in the drift, the memories of him and Steve… it just couldn’t be them. He racked his mind all through the night, but he couldn’t remember meeting Steve before a few weeks ago when he arrived at the base. Though, it felt as if he had known the man for an entire lifetime.
Dum-E quickly returned, cat toy in claw, and gently waved the fuzzy, jingly rope on a stick in Orion’s direction, beeping curiously as the cat’s attention immediately locked onto the toy. Orion leapt down off the table to start swatting at the toy as Dum-E kept it
“There’s other books?!” Steve repeated his question, his voice tinged with something that sounded like a mix of excitement and urgency.
Eager to not let his plan completely fail, Tony switched gears on his tactics. Oh yes, this one was fool-proof.
At least he wouldn’t have to wander into town to get anything. The town looked like it had crawled out of a Hallmark movie where it was Christmas year round. It made Tony kinda twitchy just to drive through it. He certainly couldn’t imagine Howard here, but he might vaguely remember his mom mentioning it once or twice. Maria had been enamored with the idea of celebrating Christmas in a quaint town away from the bustle of the city, but Tony wasn’t sure if his parents had ever even stepped foot in this godforsaken town.
Thankfully, Steve left it at that, instead choosing to change the topic of conversation. “Ya know, you were right about Buck. He’d kick my ass if he caught me blaming myself for his death.”
The last thing he could remember was kissing Steve in the dining room, and— oh… Steve. The man must have carried Tony up to his bedroom, and he tried not to dwell too long on the images that line of thought provided. He rubbed at his eyes wearily to chase away the last of the sleepiness, and then he saw the drawing from Steve laid neatly on his bedside table.
The man’s posture had gone rigid, so Tony chanced a look in his direction and was met with an icy cold glare.
But he had to admit, the Tower somehow felt… warmer since the cat wandered in a couple weeks ago. Sure, the Avengers had already been well on their way to becoming really good… roommates before then, but it seemed like the fluffiest resident had become a sort of rallying point for them, giving them something else in common besides punching bad guys and having a shit ton of emotional baggage. Tony even thought he caught Natasha smiling the other day, and he wasn’t sure if he should run for his life or not.
Despite the rapidly growing uneasiness, Tony continued forward until he came to the source of the noise, and there was that hot-rod red armor again at the center of it. Whoever was in the armor this time was… fighting two other people, a man with dark, messy hair and a metal arm, and… the star spangled man from the other memories. Tony felt as if he were frozen in place as he watched the violent struggle, unable to tear his eyes away from the scene playing out before him.
“I’d be more concerned if you didn’t have any problems, Tony.” The exasperation in her tone bled more into fondness than irritation. “Also, you’re lucky that Phil let me know you were okay otherwise I really was going to call the police. I thought I was going to be responsible for sending you to your death!”
Steve definitely couldn’t help the way he heart always sped up every time Tony said anything remotely possessive in regards to him, even if it was just a joke.
They had found themselves in a stalemate; Tony almost had managed to wiggle through to smear more icing across Steve’s face, but the man’s muscles were definitely not just for show. He’d managed to hold Tony back for a while, but they’d somehow become twisted together, faces close with Tony’s right arm trapped between them.
He tried to avoid all of it for a while, just waiting for the initial excitement and fuss about the new fluffy resident to pass like it inevitably would. Eventually the ball would drop, so Tony waited, and he waited, but it never did. Seemingly, all of the Avengers were incredibly fond of the adorable little cat.
For a moment, Tony thought Steve was going to continue to argue with him, but instead his anger deflated a bit, his shoulders dropping. Neither of them pushed the subject further, but they didn’t return to the easygoing atmosphere that had been between them before.
“I thought birds and cats didn’t get along,” Tony continued. “Watch out, Tweety Bird, he might try to eat you.”
“Well, it’s a little hard to dismiss something you’ve experienced firsthand,” he said with a nonchalant shrug. “Besides, stranger things have happened.” Steve cocked his head curiously, and Tony had to bite his lip and try to ignore how much the action made the blond look like a golden retriever.
It was much easier to sort through the attic since Steve was actually able to touch the boxes and their contents, unlike the newspaper Coulson had brought them. Tony wasn’t sure what kind of small talk to make while they worked, so he took his chances and asked about Steve’s best friend.
Tony parked his car next to what he assumed was the drab SUV that belonged to the appraiser he was supposed to be meeting. He supposed he was a little bit late, but only by like half an hour or so. The Audi had
It felt like Tony was constantly coming across Steve being sickeningly cute with the cat. He was starting to run out of words to describe how goddamn cute it was to see 6-feet of super soldier all bent over and talking in a baby voice to a cat, having full conversations when no one else was around. And it was
“Being handsy is much more fun.” Clint winked and gave Bucky’s arm a squeeze before backing away and getting his phone’s camera ready.
The man gave the little cat the strangest look, as if he was almost wary of him. “That’s a cat, right?”
When he turned to meet eyes with the former pilot, the expression on his face wasn’t exactly the friendliest, but Barnes also didn’t look like he had come to kick Tony’s ass, at least. There was an awkward beat of silence between them.
Nearly out of ideas, Tony rushed over to the couch and pulled the blanket from the back of it, then took a breath, hoping that this would work. He threw the blanket over Steve’s shoulders, and… it actually worked. The blanket didn’t just fall through him, instead, resting over his broad shoulders like a cape. Tony carefully arranged the blanket so that it was covering as much of Steve as it could, even pulling it up over his head like a makeshift hood.
“It sure is great,” Tony agreed, way too amused at the way Steve was blushing and pointedly not making eye contact with him. The man hadn’t tensed up, and he hadn’t rushed to put any distance between them, so Tony figured he could take that as a good sign.
“What’s the big deal?” Steve scoffed incredulously at Tony. He closed the distance between them and quickly reached past him to close the case, but his hand just passed right through it.
They eventually parted, mostly because Tony still needed to breathe, unlike certain people who weren’t held back by humanly restraints like needing oxygen. The second he was able to catch his breath, he clung tightly to Steve, gripping onto the man’s arms as if he would disappear if Tony let go for even a moment. There wasn’t a clock nearby to check, but he knew midnight was drawing ever closer.
Immediately, the man in the patriotic suit was upon him, straddling the armor and punching him repeatedly. The helmet that the man was wearing concealed much of his face, but it only took one look into those fierce blue eyes for Tony to confirm his worst thoughts. It was Steve.
“Not really.” The blond made that cute scrunchy face at Tony, and he had to physically resist the urge to pinch his cheeks or something. Tony flicked some flour at him instead, a light dusting of it stuck to Steve’s shirt.
He was amazed as he flipped through the pages, taking in the drawings and sketches that adorned the paper. There were mostly life studies, portraits of various people who must have been Steve’s friends or family. He recognized Bucky among the sketches, and there was a fair-haired woman who Tony could only guess was his mother, judging by her features. He thought he might’ve seen a photo of her among the ones in the hallway, too.
Before he can get a glimpse of the face of the man wrapped up in an American flag, Tony saw the face of the figure on the ground and stopped dead in his tracks. It was…
There was an awful clatter as Steve tossed his plate into the sink. “Why the hell are you still here?” he demanded, turning around to glare at Tony. The anger etched on his face resembled his look from their argument that morning, but with something that might have been a flash of pain lying under the surface.
He found Steve in the kitchen, assisting Coulson with the clean-up from breakfast. Tony picked up an apple from the bowl in the center of the table and examined it closely before lobbing it at the back of the ghost’s head. It made contact, and Steve whipped around to glare at him.
Afterwards, they called shelters and other vets in the area, but no one had reported a cat by his description missing. Which pretty much meant this was happening for real.
After they finished with the clean up, Steve stopped Tony as they were about to part for the night at the bottom of the stairs. He shifted back and forth on his feet as he seemed to be looking for the right words.
mode. Tony wanted to just grab his face and kiss the tension right out of him, and he definitely shouldn’t do
Thankfully, his words finally started working again, and he cleared his throat. “Yeah, I went into town and got a tree, you know, to decorate. So put on some clothes and come help me with it. Or not, we can do shirtless tree decorating, too, though it might be a bit prickly.”
It was still a little weird whenever their hands made contact, or rather… didn’t make contact. Although it wasn’t nearly as cold as that night Tony had found him in front of the fireplace, it was an unwelcome reminder of Steve’s circumstances, so Tony tried to hand him the ornaments in a way that kept it from happening.
, haven’t you?” The archer added with a sly grin. “No more weird referring to the little guy like he’s some sort of object.”
“One time that I unfortunately will not be forgetting, despite my best efforts,” Rhodey added, pointedly, before getting back to the main issue. “So, how friendly are we talking?”
Steve opened his mouth, about to say something, but in that moment, the Kaiju siren started blaring. The two men both froze for a split second, eyes going impossibly wide as they stared at each other before they launched into action.
And that was when Tony finally emerged from his workshop and found them sprawled about the living room. He stopped dead in his tracks on the way to the kitchen when he spotted the orange ball of fluff curled up asleep on Bruce’s lap.
But after the whole thing with the ice and then the sketchbooks, Tony was starting to want to just spend more with Steve. He knew it was probably a bit selfish of him, but he couldn’t help it. With every little bit that he learned about the man, Tony wanted to know more. And hey, maybe getting to know him could be a way to break the curse? Like some Dr. Phil emotional journey or something. At that point it probably wouldn’t hurt to try, at least.
He laughed as he pulled away from Tony, but as he did so, his mind was flooded with the newfound knowledge that Tony fit perfectly into his arms, like two puzzle pieces fitting together. Unsure of what to do with that information, he just… awkwardly patted Tony on the shoulder and took a step back.
Steve reached behind him to pull the blanket off the back of the couch and then stretched it out across them. Orion grumbled in discontent at being jostled during the process, but he quickly fell back asleep once Steve stopped moving. “I thought you had some sort of gala or fundraiser thing to go to tonight?”
Tony ducked his head and pretended to be extremely interested in the box of ornaments in his hands. “Most people just find me to be… a lot.”
“How’d you end up here in Whoville anyway? You don’t really sound like you’re from around these parts, but your accent doesn’t come through enough for me to pinpoint it.”
His lips were soft and pliant, and Tony lost himself in the gentle press of Steve’s lips against his own. It started tender, as if Steve wasn’t sure if Tony truly wanted this, and oh, he
“We could use a friendly little guy like you at the VA,” Sam commented while some of them were gathered in the kitchen. Orion was headbutting his hand for ear scratches.
After that day, Steve started spending more time in Tony’s workshop. It had been something he’d done occasionally before what he had been mentally referring to as The Realization, enough so that Tony had given him his own access code and told him that he was welcome anytime Tony was down there working.
Steve was watching amusedly as Clint was attempting to teach Orion a few tricks, and it was going surprisingly well. According to Clint, the success was in thanks to his circus background.
He doesn’t really listen as Thor and Steve are catching up, though he thinks he hears the god congratulate the two of them on finally pulling their heads out of their asses. Tony’s too busy running back through his moment with Steve repeatedly, feeling entirely too much like he’s dreaming.
“We’ve formed a truce,” Clint answered. “But if he ever turns coat, I can seek higher ground than he can reach.”
There was a small, yet brief smile on Steve’s face as he turned to Tony. “So you did your research?”
Did ghost clothes even get wrinkled? Or was he wearing stuff that existed in the real world? Cursed ghost physics were weird.
“I tried prying info from Coulson about it, but he won’t confirm. Just said ‘It’s classified. Director Fury had an encounter with a highly dangerous lifeform.’” Tony mocked Coulson’s tone perfectly and then nodded in Orion’s direction, which just made Steve laugh more.
“I have no idea, honestly.” He could feel his brain going into overdrive from the proximity to Tony. He was sharing a blanket. With Tony. Also, it just so happened to be Valentine’s Day.
“Don’t ‘Tony’ me with that look on your face. I can’t be held responsible for any promises I might make under pressure.”
“There’s an appraiser who can meet with you this week, and we possibly already have an interested buyer lined up.”
As Thor pushes the escape pod into Earth’s atmosphere, Tony turns to Steve and tries to will himself into ignoring that their godly teammate can probably hear their entire conversation now.
Tony spent the rest of the day following Steve around the house and asking him various questions, trying to get a feel for the situation the man was in. It wasn’t like he had anything better to do until Pepper found another appraiser, and technically he was on “vacation” anyway. The only problem was that he wasn’t really getting very helpful answers from Steve.
“Ever since…” Steve wavered for a moment, clearly having difficulty finding the right words. “Ever since that last fight, I’ve been having dreams. Sometimes they’re nightmares, sometimes not.”
Wanting to no longer be the subject of conversation, Tony directed a question towards Steve. “Did you have anyone before…?” He trailed off, finding himself a bit uncomfortable with acknowledging Steve’s death the closer he became with the man.
“...of course he’s a cat. What the fuck else would he be?” Tony retorted, but Fury just gave him a dubious look.
As they separated, Steve leaned his forehead against Tony’s, still gently cupping his face with one hand. Tony tried to remember what words were.
“You know,” Tony’s brain was kicking into overdrive suddenly, trying to come up with a solution. “Search and rescue has come a long way since then. I can probably find a team to come in and search the lake for…” He gestured vaguely, the words not wanting to come out of his mouth. He didn’t want to think about the possibility that all that physically remained of the man in front of him was lying forgotten at the bottom of a lake. “Or I could design something… Something that would be able to scan the bottom and find, find you.”
“Tony.” Steve turns his seat towards Tony and puts his hand on the shoulder of the armor. He looks into Steve’s blue eyes and isn’t sure if the poor lighting is playing tricks on him or if Steve is close to tears as well.
The ghost stormed out of the attic without another word, leaving Tony at a loss for whatever the fuck just happened. Suddenly feeling drained, Tony slumped against the nearest stack of cardboard boxes, not caring that he was getting covered in dust.
Thor made eye contact with Orion, seeming to ask for approval before nodding for Clint to continue with the question.
“Fine by me. I think I’ve had enough of this place after seventy years.” He playfully grimaced at the house.
At least they’re together at the end. Part of him had always hoped his final moments would be with Steve.
A couple days after walking in on Steve feeding the cat, Tony was deep in his thoughts in the workshop. He was trying to devise handholds on the suit that his less aerially-inclined teammates could use (and enemies couldn’t) for stability while getting a lift.
His team had become a family right before his very eyes, but somehow he hadn’t even realized it until that moment.
“Is that one me?” he asked, deep voice sending vibrations through Tony in a way that had him suppressing a shiver.
“Good morning, Mr. Stark, how are you feeling?” Coulson was in front of the stove, cooking some bacon that smelled mouth-wateringly delicious, and maybe some other food, too.
“What? No! That’s not true at all,” he tried to defend himself, but internally winced when he recalled that was almost exactly what he had said originally.
Apparently that night was the beginning of a new habit of Orion sneaking away from the communal floor to hang out with Tony in the workshop in the middle of the night when most of the other residents were asleep.
It felt wrong to leave Steve’s belongings in the attic just to gather dust again, so Tony carefully brought them downstairs to the study, arranging the easel near the window.
A Kaiju’s enormous claws were ripping through the conn-pod, and Tony whipped around and reached his hand out to check on Steve, but the pilot next to him was… Barnes. The pilot was screaming in agony as he clutched his left arm, shredded metal and electrical sparks showering around him.
Not wanting this to become a pattern, Tony decided that maybe he should perhaps apologize for whatever transgression he clearly made in the attic. He knocked on Steve’s bedroom door a couple times and called his name, but there was no reply. He tried to turn the doorknob, but it was locked. Closing his eyes, he let his forehead
Tony rocketed off the front porch and ran as well as he could through the snow to meet him halfway. When Steve saw him, his face lit up with a smile almost as blinding as the winter sun.
“So… you can touch pretty much everything else in this house, that’s older than me at least, except for the things that matter to you the most? That’s pretty fucked, honestly,” commented Tony, a grimace screwing up his face.
They stared at each other in silence for a moment before Steve moved like he was about to close the door without a word.
“Did you sneak away from everyone to come down here?” Tony asked the cat as he sniffed the oil-stained gloves that had been haphazardly tossed onto the table earlier in the night. “You’re a regular ninja, sneaking everywhere, aren’t you?”
Slowly, Tony took the piece of paper from Steve and stared at it. It felt like the same type of paper that was in Steve’s old sketchbooks, and there was a drawing of a Christmas tree on it. It looked a lot like the tree they’d decorated the day before…
Steve, who was apparently having similar thoughts, as Tony watched Steve’s gaze dart down to his mouth and the way the man almost seemed to lean in just a fraction closer.
The kitchen was silent for a moment as the rest of the team stared at the god seated at their kitchen table, munching on his poptart like he hadn’t said anything of significance.
He suddenly grabbed Steve’s arm, like he needed an anchor in that moment, and the man just raised an eyebrow at Tony, clearly waiting for him to continue. He let go and pushed off the bed suddenly, inadvertently jostling Steve a bit, then started pacing in the tiny quarters as he quickly launched into an explanation, gesticulating wildly as he did so.
He took in the way that Steve was looking at him, so openly adoring, and finally leaned forward to close that gap and bring their lips together in a soft kiss.
He finds that he can’t quite voice the actual words. That alcohol didn’t burn away or dull the pain of the loss, and wearing Steve’s jacket couldn’t even start to mend the hole in Tony’s heart. The way Steve is looking at Tony tells him that he doesn’t have to say the words; that he understands without them.
“Sitting room,” Tony huffed out, scrambling to reposition his hold on the trunk of the tree as they squeezed it through the doorway.
He was kinda out of ideas, aside from calling in an “expert,” and that really… really was not something Tony wanted to do. He didn’t want anyone poking and prodding at Steve and his life recklessly (he had already seen what his own slight carelessness had done). Steve had managed to come out of it that time, but Tony didn't want to take any chances as their deadline loomed.
“Might be hard, but I think you can probably stick to it,” commented Coulson, the corner of his mouth ticked up in a small smile. Tony groaned when the pun dawned on him. “It’s been a while since we’ve had a tree at the inn. I’ll go get the boxes of ornaments; they’re probably buried so deep in the attic it’d take you all day to find them yourself.”
They spent the rest of the day sorting through the various books in the study, looking for anything that might be even remotely important to Steve and his life, but they kept coming up short. Ironically enough, most of the information they found about the town and its happenings were from even before Steve’s time. As they worked, Tony kept thinking back to the moment from earlier when Steve had bared so much about the pain and guilt he carried with him regarding his best friend. Tony wasn’t sure what he had done to earn the man’s trust that quickly, but he was amazed at the truthfulness of that moment. That surly exterior Steve donned seemed to be his only defense against everything he’d been through. He couldn’t imagine what it must be like to go through this for seventy years, how incredibly lonely the man must be after so long. Maybe he shouldn’t poke at him as much, though something about having Steve’s attention on him, furious or not, was strangely thrilling.
Considering how much Tony hated being told not to do things, Steve had basically just asked him to open up the case, pretty please. He gingerly lifted open the lid to the case, and in his peripheral he saw Steve halt to a stop.
A loaded silence had settled over the two men. Tony continued to stare at the faded newspaper in front of him rather than find out what Steve looked like in that moment.
They managed to maneuver the tree through the hallway with little to no collateral damage (no one was going to miss that potted plant) and quickly set the tree in the awaiting stand in the corner of the sitting room. Coulson untied it and started fluffing out the branches, needles scattering across the wooden floor.
Steve actually laughed at that, the light returning to his eyes as his posture straightened a bit, too. Tony felt like he could breathe a bit easier now that some of the tension had faded from his copilot. He rested his chin on his hand, listening intently as the man began to explain more freely.
And then Tony was alone with his luggage, sitting on the edge of the decently comfortable mattress in his guest room, with absolutely no idea what he should do next. Food, maybe? He puttered down the stairs to the kitchen and rifled through the contents of the fridge and pantry until he had put together a sandwich. Was Tony the only guest? There sure was a hell of a lot of food for just one person over the next few days.
“Right. Well, that’s significantly less nice.” Tony pulled himself away from Steve a bit reluctantly, taking time to admire how red Steve’s lips were now. “Come on, let’s get suited up.”
“Yeah, that’s her. It was always hard to get her to sit still long enough to do a decent portrait, but she let me do more after she got sick.” Steve’s voice was doing that faraway thing it did sometimes, but when Tony looked up at Steve, he didn’t have that lost look in his eyes. There was adoration there instead as the man smiled down at his mother on the paper.
Before Tony’s sleep-deprived brain could parse what Bruce had said, the door opened again, and Bruce left without another word. The cat wiggled down out of Tony’s arms to follow him, trotting behind the scientist with his tail straight in the air, leaving Tony alone with his thoughts.
“Oh, I’m fairly certain those belong to Mr. Rogers.” Coulson gestured towards the rest of the house. “I’ve never asked him, but a few pieces of artwork around the house have his signature on them. They’re quite lovely, aren’t they?”
“I think I can manage,” Steve interrupted, giving Tony a challenging stare. He wasn’t sure why the man was getting quite so worked up about a little cat.
After getting off the phone with Pepper, Tony dragged himself out of bed and headed downstairs with the goal of injecting caffeine into his veins. Oh, and maybe finding Steve, too. He poked his head into the kitchen, but no one was in the room. He started to turn to go check Steve’s room but decided he should probably have some caffeine to prepare himself for whatever kind of conversation they were about to have.
“And this just so happens to be an easy loose end to cut,” Steve added, sounding relatively calm, which surprised Tony a bit.
seen that one.” He seemed to ponder something. “Most of it, at least. I might’ve fallen asleep before the ending, but it’s not like l didn’t already know how it’d end.”
“Okay, here’s a knife.” He accepted the knife from Clint because there was no point in questioning the man.
Steve leaned back heavily in his chair and dragged his hands down his face, concealing it from Tony.
Coulson had the audacity to look amused. “That was Steve Rogers… the spirit who haunts the inn every year around Christmastime.”
As Phil was grabbing his own things to leave, Tony attempted to make small talk. “Why are you heading out so quickly? Hot date?”
He acted like a callous asshole to hide his true feelings and then promptly retreated back to his workshop.
Of course, when Tony finally made his way to the mess hall, there were only a few stragglers still milling about from the morning rush, and Steve wasn’t among them. Tony tried his best to ignore the conflicting mixture of relief and disappointment within himself as he got some coffee. He had just finished filling a cup with what remained of the luke-warm coffee this late in the morning when a looming shadow fell over his shoulder. The sudden presence caused him to startle with a bitten-off curse as some of the coffee sloshed out of the cup and onto his hand.
“Probably.” There was a hint of ruefulness in his expression, his brow furrowed. Tony wanted to reach out to Steve and gently smooth out the lines.
“Well, he was kind of an asshole at first, but I think there might be some Casper in there under the scowl,” Tony explained, a bit of affection somehow finding its way into his voice at the thought of Steve.
“Are you absolutely sure I shouldn’t be calling the cops right now? I’d really rather not be on the phone with you when you get murdered.”
They had dinner together again that night. It wasn’t like Tony specifically planned to be in the kitchen around the same time that he had noticed Steve liked to eat. It was completely and entirely coincidental.
“When we moved here, my aunt always had a tree decorated for any guests that stayed around Christmastime. Ma and I had never gotten one to decorate after Da passed, but I helped with the one here.”
Steve pulled away suddenly, large frame shaking with laughter, and Tony wished for probably the fifth time that evening that he could ask mobile JARVIS to record Steve’s laugh on his phone without it being weird and ruining the mood probably.
“So, I take it you met Mr. Rogers last night?” He asked as he placed a plate of bacon and eggs on the table in front of Tony.
“Okay, just- just checking. I wasn’t sure if it was like a heat of the moment thing because we were dying or—” Apparently, Steve has decided to make cutting his rambling off with kisses a new habit.
He asked Pepper if she could possibly find a way to delay. There were still a few days left before Christmas Eve, and maybe he and Steve would be able to break the curse before then. Tony just couldn’t let this happen to him. He’d call the whole thing off and keep the damn place if it meant Steve could have those twelve days of peace every year. Hell, the stupid place could be a vacation home or something.
Pilots brought a lot into the drift with them; Tony wasn’t going to let whatever feelings he had developed for Rogers make him naively hopeful about the whole thing. They were going to see everything: the good, the bad, and the really fucking awful. There was no hiding from each other, and no point in attempting to either, as it would just make their connection unstable.
“When I got here, he was running out the door looking like, well... like he’d seen a ghost,” Tony explained wryly. He heard Pepper sigh heavily on the other line.
“I think…” It took Steve a second to find his words. “It still is my life. Sometimes it doesn’t feel like I died, but then something will happen that reminds me, and I don’t always react too well.”
She pretended to ponder it for a moment. “No, heels don’t go too well with cobblestone streets,” Pepper joked, a bit of mirth shining in her eyes.
A silence had fallen over them as Steve appeared to be combusting thanks to Tony’s compliments, so he decided to fill it with the first thought that came to mind.
On the way to Steve’s quarters, Tony nervously chugged the bland, cold coffee until he found himself standing outside of the door, fiddling with the empty cup and trying to build up the nerve to knock. Finally, he just reached out and knocked before he could psyche himself out. In the twenty-something seconds it took for Steve to open the door, Tony considered abandoning the attempt at reaching out at least five times.
“...shit.” Clearly, his little demonstration had the opposite effect he had hoped for, and Steve slammed the door shut as Tony scrambled back up the porch steps.
“Oh.” Steve said, smile turning wry. “Well, that was very kind of whoever did it. Maybe it was Coulson, I should thank him when he drops by again.” The tone of Steve’s voice told Tony that he knew exactly who had cleaned it.
“Well good morning, little buddy!” Steve cooed at Orion, who was just barely tall enough to rest his chin on the table while he sniffed, his eyes wide and doe-like in what he’d heard Clint describe as his Puss in Boots face. “You want some eggs, cutie?”
“Aw, man. I really did not need that kind of imagery, Tony,” he complained. “So… this is for real? Not some kind of weird roleplay thing you’re dragging us into?”
As he was about to round a corner into what appeared to be the kitchen, a man stepped into the room and Tony nearly jumped a foot in the air at the sudden entrance.
Steve just toyed with the corner of his book, a wry smile on his face. “Don’t really think I’ve got much of a say in it.”
The man nodded silently at Coulson but hardly acknowledged Tony’s presence as he went about the kitchen, making himself a plate of food to eat. It was a bit difficult for Tony to tear his eyes away from the man, he was very err,
Steve nodded, then turned and met Tony’s eyes, his gaze full of certainty. “I… knew I had to meet you somehow. That it was the only way I was going to find any answers about what I was seeing.”
“What? ...What?! Are you like— oh my god. Steve.” Tony’s hand flew to Steve’s neck as he checked for a pulse. “You… you have a pulse. How—”
“The inn hasn’t shown any profit in the past several years due to a decline in visitors and a noticeable increase in…
He pushed forward and landed a massive glob of bright blue icing across Steve’s chin and bottom lip. Immediately, Steve let go of Tony and jolted a step backwards.
“Okay, Marley. Yesterday’s little game of twenty questions wasn’t all that productive, so I think we should start researching your past a bit.”
out of nowhere; he probably walked in like a normal person, but Tony was just not capable of processing his surroundings yet.
When they reached the gate at the property line, Steve took a step in front of Tony and turned to face him, mere inches away from the invisible boundary the curse had created. There was so much hope in his eyes, and Tony’s heart felt like it was going to pound straight out of his chest. Finally, he released Steve’s wrist, and the man took the final step backwards.
“Damn. I think he’s a bit out of my weight class,” Steve commented distractedly, his focus now on his sketchbook and a drawing of Tony he had started on.
As Tony closed the door with a soft click behind him, he could have sworn he saw a flash of movement through the front window. Without a second thought, he sprinted outside, bare feet be damned as he threw open the front door and stepped out into the cold.
was that?!” Tony was proud that his voice only broke a little bit. He slumped back into his seat at the table and pulled the blanket back around his shoulders to fight off the lingering chill from whatever the hell just happened to him.
“He made quite a ruckus on his way out,” Coulson commented. Did everything he said have to sound so… weirdly contemplative? “Though, that tends to be how most of them leave,” he added with something of a chuckle.
About that time, though, Clint appeared seemingly out of nowhere and started petting the cat. “Hey, when’d we get a cat?”
Tony let out a big sigh and shifted in bed so he was sitting upright and facing his friends. “Honestly? I can’t even begin to understand it myself, let alone explain it.” Rhodey’s eyebrows shot up at Tony’s admission.
“Well, covering the basics is always a great starting point,” Tony began, waving his hand as he spoke. “So, why the twelve days before Christmas? It’s kinda past the time for spookiness, unless you really are going for the whole ‘Ghost of Christmas Past’ thing. In which case, I have to say that I am definitely not Scrooge in this scenario.”
“We’ve always known the breach is some sort of portal the Kaiju use, but we’ve always assumed that they were coming from somewhere in space, right? But what if they’re not? What if the portal connects with a different universe entirely? And your visions, our dreams, they’re just some sort of leaky by-product of the invasion.”
“Like… three minutes, maybe.” Steve tapped his pencil against his bottom lip, and Tony couldn’t take his eyes away. “And that’s a generous estimate.”
Steve’s nervous shuffling caught Tony’s attention, and he realized he should probably say something at least.
“—but you’re not going to get any real answers until you talk to Rogers about this,” he finished. Tony rolled his eyes and slumped further into bed.
“Who’s going to make sure it’s up on its shots? Make sure it doesn’t wander somewhere dangerous? Feed it regularly? Empty its litterbox? You sure as hell won’t catch me—“
before clattering to the floor. The man was staring at him with a rather impressive deadpan, and Coulson was ignoring both of them with an even more impressive amount of professionalism.
Tony couldn’t hold back a laugh at that, but it came out all wet and emotional-sounding. Hearing his own voice so raw was like opening the floodgates, and he averted his gaze from Steve as he felt his eyes start to water a bit. So much for holding things together through this.
“Hey, Tony.” Steve greeted him as he got out the ingredients for his hot chocolate. “I didn’t know you had a cat.”
And Steve was making that face he always did whenever they argued, where his jaw went tight and he switched into
Steve left the room without answering him, and a few moments later, Tony heard a door slam down the hallway. Well, that was probably enough of an answer for now.
They took the elevator up to the communal floor, and Steve watched as the cat sniffed around the couch for a moment before climbing up on it to find a place to curl up. Steve made his way over to the kitchen to make some hot chocolate to warm himself up faster, and Tony happened to be in there getting some coffee.
One day Steve and Clint were watching television in the living room, and Clint spotted Bucky carrying Orion around and started cackling with glee.
“If you want information like that, you’d probably be more likely to find it at the town’s library.”
Tony finally gave up and let go of the sheet, knowing he wasn’t going to win against Carol Danvers in any contest of strength or bullheaded-ness. “I’m not moping,” he muttered.
“I fucked up,” Tony confessed as he slumped into a chair. Instead of commenting, Phil waited for him to continue.
shoulders, wow, he really had been tiny). After taking a moment to appreciate Steve’s bright smile in the photo, he turned back to Actual Steve, who was giving him a questioning look.
“Yeah, I used to go on morning runs a lot, but it’s a little harder with all the snow.” Steve chuckled. Apparently Tony had said some of that out loud.
“Why not? Isn’t that how all the masters do it? I’m no Greek god, or Norse god for that matter.” He paused, suddenly feeling more self conscious. “Actually, let’s not bring up Thor’s muscles right now.”
“Wait,” Tony paused in his search to stare at Steve. “Is that photo downstairs of that frail kid actually you?”
He lost track of how long they sat like that on the floor, Steve pulled tightly to his chest. At some point, the fire had faded to mere embers, but Tony stayed there, holding Steve until the shivering subsided and the color returned to his face.
“I’ve seen you cook! I didn’t think you’d be this bad.” Steve hid a laugh with the back of his hand. “It’s not even that hard.”
He could hear some faint noises coming from further inside the house, so carefully, he made his way in that direction, much to the dismay of Happy’s voice yelling inside his head for Tony to turn around and go back outside. He probably should’ve brought his security guard with him, but what was going to get him in this Santa Claus town? Ghosts?? Happy deserved some time off, anyway.
“You’re planning on selling the inn?” The man quickly turned to Coulson, eyes gone wide. “Is this true?”
The way Steve’s eye crinkled when he smiled at him entirely too fondly had Tony’s world going sideways, and god, he needed coffee, and he needed it five minutes ago because he cannot deal with whatever Steve was trying to hand him. Wait, Steve was trying to hand him something.
They shared stories while they were eating, joking and laughing through all of them. Steve told him about his adventures growing up in Brooklyn with Bucky, and Tony couldn’t believe that stick of a boy in the old photos used to get into alley fights like it was going out of style.
“Contrary to popular belief, my life hasn’t exactly been sunshine and rainbows either,” Tony felt the need to counter with, then gave a firm nod as he added, “We’ll be fine, Steve.”
“You know I just can’t help myself,” Steve replied dryly as Bucky plopped down on the couch next to him and offered his hand out for Orion to sniff. Without hesitation, the cat uncurled himself from Steve’s side to investigate this New Person. There was a soft smile on Bucky’s face as the cat headbutted his hand, demanding to be pet, and Steve couldn’t help but feel the usual swell of happiness and relief at having his best friend back.
“You don’t even have feathers.” Steve rolled his eyes at Clint’s antics and dropped it into the cart anyway.
“Hey, hey.” Clint hopped down from the fridge and leaned against the edge of the table. “Can you ask him a question for me?”
He loved watching how Tony interacted with Orion, loved watching him get completely engrossed in his work to the point of tuning out the rest of the world. Steve wasn’t exactly sure what to even call whatever was happening between between the two of them, but he had hope that maybe someday it could be something more.
Steve stood up, and immediately Tony was worried he had overstepped some sort of boundary, but then he pulled up another chair facing the couch and sat down with his sketchpad.
Steve had seemed a little different since their conversation that morning, too. He wasn’t holding himself as stiffly as before, like the tension had faded from his shoulders. He was also starting to relax more around Tony and show what was apparently his true self — a smartass with the driest sense of humor. Tony was absolutely living for it.
“Ms. Potts called me, concerned about your well-being because you told her there was an intruder, and then hung up after there was a loud crash. She was about to call the police, but I assured her that the situation was under control.” Tony was really questioning Pepper’s definition of “lovely” as Coulson explained.
There wasn’t anything to look over for S.I., so Tony wasted an indeterminate amount of time looking at cat memes to cheer himself up. He sent a few of his favorites to Rhodey, who replied with the classic “hang in there” motivational cat. Briefly, he considered calling his best friend, but thought better of it, not wanting to get all emotional on Rhodey. He’d save that call for tomorrow when he’d really need it.
“Did he... have a home before us?” Clint’s tone was uncharacteristically serious, his usual nonchalance nowhere to be found.
Once he was able to tear his eyes away from Steve looking absolutely gorgeous, he realized there were candles on the table, and music softly drifting from the record player in the corner. The food was already set on the table, and it smelled delicious, and Steve looked lovely, and it was all so much that Tony was at a loss for words.
“I didn’t want to see him mope around; it’s bad for the country’s morale,” Tony muttered before he left the room without so much as glancing at Steve.
Tony leaned against the bannister of the stairs and smiled warmly at Steve. “Dinner sounds fantastic.”
“Aw, come here, sore loser. I’ll get it off,” Tony offered, holding out his icing-free hand. Steve eyed him cautiously before stepping closer to him, probably trying to gauge if Tony was plotting against him.
Steve nodded, something that looked a lot like determination finding its way to the surface. “I promise.”
“At first, the dreams were just flashes, and I didn’t think anything of it with everything else that was happening then. But they continued for months, getting more and more detailed, and that’s when I recognized…” Steve trailed off, becoming quiet again.
Steve cut him off with a kiss that was so full of longing, yet so soft and tender, like he was trying to memorize Tony’s lips with his own. Tony felt Steve’s strong arms wrap around him, pulling him flush again the taller man’s broad chest. It was like Steve was trying to put everything he couldn’t say into that one moment, and Tony melted against him, trying to take as much of it in as he could.
He tossed and turned as he attempted to find some sort of relatively comfortable way to lay as he stayed in bed way past the acceptable time at the Shatterdome. Tony had hardly slept at all that night, plagued by nightmares that weren’t his, of Kaiju coming through portals from
When it came time to knead the dough (apparently that was a thing that had to be done with gingerbread, Tony was learning), Steve rolled up his sleeves, and Tony did his absolute best to not drool over the man’s forearms. It was… quite a sight. Steve shot him an amused look when he noticed that Tony hadn’t been able to pull his eyes away.
“Posed mostly nude for someone? Surprisingly, no, the opportunity has not presented itself before.” He shifted his weight back and forth, waiting for Steve to maybe tell him what to do with himself.
“I don’t know! I just woke up in the snow by the edge of the lake, and I came running to find you as soon as I realized it.”
“Tony.” His beautiful blue eyes were bright with affection, and Tony started to lose himself in them. “I’ve been trying to get your attention for the past ten minutes.”
Thor in particular loved to play with Orion using the little mouse shaped laser pointer, loudly declaring the cat a “most valiant warrior” as he darted around, smacking at the little dot as it zoomed around on the floor. A time or two, Thor had tried pointing the laser at someone’s feet to see if Orion would still smack at it. The one time he had been brazen enough to try with Natasha only resulted in the most blank expression on her face, as if she were daring Thor to do it. His warm laughter quickly faded as he directed the laser pointer away from her.
Tony recalled how much he had been drawn to Steve Rogers; keeping track of the pilot’s encounters with Kaiju, perhaps more so than was strictly necessary from a Jaeger engineering standpoint, and that was before he had even met the man. After Steve had arrived at the Shatterdome, Tony had only gravitated towards him even more, but maybe there was more to it than the “crush” Carol and Rhodey had teased him about.
Never one to back down, or notice when he really should stop while he was ahead, Tony kept going. “The thing that’s keeping you here… Could it be the guilt you’re carrying around about Bucky’s death?”
Asking the Avengers to move into his tower after the Chitauri attack was the worst idea Tony Stark had ever had in his life, and it had some pretty stiff competition from his wilder days.
When Tony sat down at the table across from Steve, the man looked up and shot him a grin. “Did you clean my stuff? I found it in the study earlier.”
He thinks about responding with some witty joke, but this… this is truly it. This is his last chance. A chance he never even thought he would get, especially after losing Steve on A-Day.
Other than a few awkward occurrences with Tony, most of the Avengers warmed up to the cat just as quickly as he did to them. Steve tried not to focus on how Tony seemingly tried to avoid the newest resident. They mostly let the little guy run around the communal floor and Steve’s room, but Steve suspected that sometimes the other Avengers catnapped Orion to take him to their own rooms, too.
The cat gave a “mrrr” in response as he easily hopped onto the table, taking the same spot he had the previous time, settling down to watch the bright screens as Tony worked on something for SI.
Steve considered his words for a moment. “Well, we’ve already gone through the entire study, and you sorted through the archived papers yesterday, so I’m not sure what else that leaves to be investigated.”
“Hey Marley,” Tony called out to him as he entered the room. “Do you brood by the fire often? Is this a habit I just haven’t noticed?”
For a moment, he was almost self-conscious about the scars on his chest surrounding the arc reactor, and the damn reactor itself, but he knew there was no way in hell that Steve of all people would judge him for it. Too much all-American goodness and that stuff. And it wasn’t anything he hadn’t seen before, modesty was a thing of the past after SHIELD’s decontamination chamber.
“Do you think…?” He asked, searching Steve’s eyes like the answer would somehow be in their clear blue depths.
The god murmured something to the cat, who lightly bobbed his head as he seemed to be listening intently to him. Steve watched as the cat meowed back to Thor in response and wondered when the hell his life became so weird that this was somehow wasn’t even out of place.
He gracefully stretched his lithe body further across the couch and draped his arm over the side of the couch. “Rogers, paint me like one of your French girls.” He hesitated. “You’ve seen that one, right?”
“For science,” Steve let out a low chuckle, his breath ghosting over Tony’s lips as he reached out and tilted Tony’s jaw up.
Orion looked up at Tony as he continued to talk to him, slowly blinking as he appeared to actually be listening.
dark bags under his eyes and his hair mussed and sticking up in ways that Tony was trying desperately to not find endearing. And there was an oppressive wave of exhaustion coming off of the way the man was holding himself.
Helping him move on… that had supposedly been the goal all along, right? Only at some point, Tony had started wishing that it wasn’t going to happen; that he could tell Pepper to call off the sale and just spend every Christmas with Steve at this stupid inn.
Then he noticed an easel tucked away in the corner of the attic, covered in layers of cobwebs. It looked like it had been there even longer than the storage boxes. He got curious and moved closer to check it out.
“‘Morning, Sleeping Beauty.” Well, he might as well just jump right in. “Sorry if I wasn’t supposed to look at these, but I did, so.”
“But part of me is almost relieved that I haven’t seen him since then… because I don’t want him to be stuck like this. I don’t want him to be stuck here, and especially not over there.” His eyes were glazed over, like he was lost somewhere else in that moment.
“It isn’t,” he calmly answered, face giving Tony no hints as to what the man was feeling. “I know that much.”
A rueful laugh, laced with self-deprecation, escaped from Steve at that. “I’m well-aware. Sometimes I think it’s what I deserve for not being at his side. We grew up together, I should have served alongside him in the war.”
“There isn’t anything to solve. We tried before, and it didn’t work.” Rogers deflated a bit, his anger subsiding before he shuttered his emotions off entirely. “You should just leave.”
Tony was staring down those blue eyes that were so full of fury, like a gathering storm, when something seemed to snap in them. Tony barely had time to curse his own foolishness when the man surged forward, and Tony braced himself for whatever kind of punch was likely heading his way, only for an intense iciness to rush right through him instead, leaving him shivering and standing alone in the room with Coulson.
He hurried down the stairs and when he didn’t find Steve in the kitchen, he went straight to the man’s room, calling his name as he opened the door. And if Tony wasn’t really thinking when he barged into the room without knocking… then his mind went
Of course, Tony immediately got up from the table and hurried down the hallway to see what Coulson was talking about. Sure enough, there was a framed drawing hanging on the wall that he had walked past at least a dozen times without ever giving it a second look. The drawing depicted a cityscape, and it felt oddly familiar, though Tony couldn’t quite place it. Maybe Brooklyn? That would make sense, considering Steve grew up there. Who knew if any of these buildings were even still standing today.
Well. The odds say they’re going to die here, so Tony is spending every moment he can memorizing Steve’s face.
With a heavy sigh, Tony began explaining his concerns for Steve. Some thoughts had been plaguing him since the incident the night before, and now he was worried about what would become of the ghost if the inn was sold. What if the new owner tried to turn him into some sort of tourist attraction, or something like a specimen to be examined? There was a sinking feeling in Tony’s gut at the thought of Steve’s few days in the world every year being as torturous as wherever he was during the rest of the year.
“Well, it worked,” Steve chuckles. Tony can’t help but laugh too, even if the entire moment feels a bit surreal. Surely he’s just having some sort of near-death hallucination or something… though Steve still hasn’t moved away entirely.
Realization dawned on Tony after a moment. “Oh, hey. You’re the guy from the photo in the hallway,” he commented, vaguely pointing in the general direction of the photograph collection down the hall.
“It appears to have snuck in while Captain Rogers was entering the garage,” came JARVIS’ unbothered response.
Tony looked at Steve and was met with the whirl of emotions flickering in his blue eyes. “Promise me you’ll try again before you leave?”
“Oh, uh, I’m from Brooklyn.” There was a small smile on Steve’s face as he started to explain. “Ma and I hadta move out here to live with her sister when she got sick. I couldn’t manage to take care of her by myself
When he reached the bottom of the stairs, he noticed a soft flickering light coming from the sitting room, so he went to check it out. Steve was sitting on the floor, hunched over in front of the fireplace, a few logs burning meagerly.
“You sound like you think it’s about as great as the time I surprised you with a board meeting.” She always could see right through him, even when she wasn’t even looking at him. “Did something happen?”
Steve took a step closer, and Tony’s back connected with the door as the man ducked his head closer. “You think?”
“I probably haven’t been going about things the best way either. This isn’t some sort of equation to solve, or some sort of treasure hunt with a chest of gold or some shit to find at the end, it’s your life.” He stopped for a moment, thinking. “
His self-consciousness seemed to kick back in after that, and he cleared his throat awkwardly, trying to look anywhere but at Steve. “Okay. Tony Stark Oversharing Hour is over.”
Tony rolled his eyes exaggeratedly. “Yeah, sorry. Next time you come back from the dead, I’ll try to remember to put some clothes o— oomph!” His sentence was cut off by Steve scooping him up out of the snow, hoisting him up with strong hands under his thighs.
One morning Tony had wearily trudged himself up to the common floor to get himself from coffee. He hadn’t even checked what time it was, but the light coming through the windows looked suspiciously like the sun rising. Of course, who else would be awake at this ungodly hour other than the good Captain getting ready for his morning run?
“Tony,” he starts again, scooting closer on the edge of his seat. He reaches up to hold Tony’s face as best as he can given the armor. His thumb gently caresses Tony’s cheek, wiping away a tear streak left behind. “I love you, too.”
A heavy sigh escaped Steve as he sat down on the edge of his bed, shoulders slumping as he ran a hand through his hair before answering. “It usually doesn’t, but I was… having a bad day. Sometimes it feels like I slip back… there. I catch bits and pieces of it occasionally; the cold, sometimes I feel like I can’t breathe.”
Memories that just couldn’t be his started flashing through Tony’s mind, almost like some sort of discordant newsreel of a life he didn’t remember living. They all felt so real, so visceral. The overwhelming force of it all caused Tony to lose his balance, his head throbbing painfully from the onslaught.
It was just the two of them for dinnertime that evening, as Coulson had left at some point after the debacle at breakfast. Before making his own food, Tony watched as the ghost somehow was able to interact with almost everything in the kitchen. It was fascinating to watch, and not entirely just because Rogers happened to be a bit easy on the eyes.
Listening to Steve recount his childhood made Tony feel strangely guilty. He had always had whatever material possessions he could have ever wanted, but the one thing that was always missing during Christmas was his parents. He would have gladly traded it all to just be with his mother for the holiday.
. He had just started punching in the code again when he saw movement in his peripheral. He whipped around to face the large shadow at the end of the hallway, bumping into a bookshelf as he turned, jostling the contents of its shelves.
Tony had collapsed onto the nearest couch as soon as the tree was stable. “Think I found my New Year’s resolution: no carrying trees, of any sort.”
“They almost feel like… visions, sometimes. As if they’re of things that could have happened, or maybe have happened someplace else. Either way, they feel like memories that don’t belong to me, like seeing the lives of other people wearing my face.”
Steve gaped at Tony. “Wow… I never thought that was something that could ever happen.” There was an awed smile on the man’s face, but an underlying sadness in his eyes. Tony wondered if Steve had ever loved anyone… Sometimes he forgot that the person in front of him had died so young, deceived by the weariness with which he usually carried himself.
“Every thirteenth of December he shows up,” Coulson began explaining as Tony just stared at him, disbelieving. “When I first started working here, we still booked guests during those days, but with the number of complaints and the strain it put on him, it clearly wasn’t worth it, even for the holiday traffic. A few years ago I started blocking off the thirteenth through the twenty-fourth to give Mr. Rogers some privacy.”
“And that’s supposed to be a bad thing?” Steve raised an eyebrow at him. “I’ve only known you for a little over a week, and you’ve already done so much to try and help me. From what you’ve told me, it sounds like you really care about how your decisions impact others, too.”
“It’s not an exact replica. Smaller, probably more lightweight, and generally not so clunky because it’s not the 90s anymore.” Tony started to explain without any prompting. “It’s got a few purposes. Tracking, in case he somehow gets out of the Tower or gets catnapped. It’ll help Jarvis know when to open doors for him on floors he has access to; if he waits in front of a door for at least five seconds, it’ll open for him. That way he’s not just cooped up or at our mercy all the time.”
“What?” Tony’s reaction didn’t really surprise Steve, but it still bothered him enough. “Tony, no, it’s freezing outside and it’s snowing.”
“Worth it, to be honest. Also, ‘boyfriend?’” Tony paused, pretending to mull it over. “I think I like the sound of that.”
“I was your favorite?” He ignored the way he heart thudded in his chest. “Who do I have to challenge to win back the title?”
Instead of waking up, Orion grumbled and shifted in his sleep, putting his paws over his eyes but resolutely not budging.
Steve had already been fond of Tony. The man was not only his closest friend after waking up from the ice, but he was also his perfect partner on the field. Somehow though, hearing him talk about protecting the cat and the team endeared their resident genius to him even more.
“Think of it as a vacation of sorts,” she added, clearly knowing she was going to win this argument like she always did. “It’s been a while since you’ve taken one.”
Orion and Fury had a weird staring contest of sorts before Fury gave in and cautiously pet him, having determined there was no threat. Life at the Tower was generally weird all the time, but seeing Director Fury hesitant around a small housecat of all things really took the cake that week.
When Tony commented on how much Steve had been drawing lately, he’d replied wryly, “Trying to make up for lost time.”
Tony gripped Steve’s hand back, thankful for at least being able to do that. “Can’t say I quite understand your reasoning, but yeah, sure.”
The two were inseparable, Rogers and his grumpy cat, and it would have potentially made Tony maybe just a little bit jealous if he wasn’t ninety-percent sure Barnes was in a relationship with one half of the Black Hawk team (Tony just wasn’t certain
The following morning, Coulson stopped by with some boxes of archived newspapers from the town’s library, so Tony and Steve spent the day sorting through the papers and looking for anything remotely useful. Well, Tony sorted, and Steve supervised because his hand phased right through the first newspaper he tried to pick up.
Tony’s brain skidded to a halt. He honestly hadn’t thought of what to say if Steve brought up the fact that he had cleaned the cases and easel.  When it started moving again, he decided to attempt nonchalance. “Me? Nah, I wouldn’t know what to do with cleaning shit— had a butler growing up.”
Tony was sure he had the most petulant look on his face, but he was really starting to regret hiring someone who actually made him do his work and was entirely immune to his puppy-dog eyes. Pepper’s resistance hadn’t weakened over the years, either.
He watched as Steve sat on the corner of his bed, the mattress dipping under his weight, and his shoulders slumped as though the weight of the world was pressing down on him, like he had the day he arrived at the Shatterdome. The way he folded in on himself made the man look so… small, as if Tony was finally seeing the real man behind the facade of one of the most successful jaeger pilots in history.
“Like an intruder bashed me over the head,” he grumbled as he poured himself a cup of coffee before taking a seat at the kitchen table.
Tony couldn’t see whoever it was coming from, but the man’s voice had the quality of someone who spent too much time at the bottom of a bottle of whiskey (not that Tony would ever know a thing or two about
“I don’t… have anything for you though… I couldn’t even manage to break the damn curse.” He carefully put the drawing down on the table, sensing he couldn’t keep down the negative feelings that were rising up. “I couldn’t even do
. The man’s back was turned to Tony, so he just kinda blankly stared at it and holy… those shoulders were something else. The white shirt he had on was doing its absolute best to stretch and cover those shoulders. His hair was a pale blond color styled in a way that seemed a bit old-fashioned in Tony’s opinion. Finally, Nice Shoulders turned around, and Tony was able to get a good look at his face as the man sat down across from him at the table. His expression was a bit surly, but it didn’t negatively impact his handsome features, which seemed familiar…
Tony let out a painfully bitter laugh at the realization. What was this, some kind of fairy tale bullshit? Had the curse on the handsome prince been broken by true love’s kiss?
If someone were to ask Steve why Tony’s relationship with the cat mattered to him so much, he didn’t think he’d be capable of giving an answer. Or at least, not a truthful one. He was just starting to parse it himself and still couldn’t really put his finger on it. All he knew was that he
“So, what? Do I need to be looking for an exorcist instead of an appraiser? Natasha probably knows someone, actually.”
A call from Pepper woke Tony up much earlier than he planned to be awake considering the kind of night he’d had. He fumbled around on the bedside table, struggling to find his phone as the ringtone was making his head pound.
Tony slowly made his way down the stairs, brandishing the fireplace poker in front of him with one hand, his phone in the other with Pepper still on the line. He made it all the way to the security system in the dark hallway and hadn’t seen or heard anything else.
Orion was so sound asleep that his little mouth had fallen open, and he was softly snoring. Tony couldn’t help but smile at how sweet he looked completely at peace like that.
“Uh, wow, okay. I’m hurt by that accusation, Steve. One, false. Two, what happened to all those nice things you were saying about me earlier? You think I’m the kind to
what he had been feeling the past few weeks. Well, Bucky had always said that Steve wasn’t the best at dealing with his own emotions.
“No, no, it’s fine. I just heard something downstairs.” And then he could hear the sound of heavy footsteps on the creaky floorboards in the hallway. “Okay, maybe I should go check it out.”
What? This… nothing like this had ever happened. Tony would have remembered it, if not whatever destruction had been wrought upon the city, then definitely Steve’s Uncle Sam get-up.
Steve took over on mixing the cookie dough, and he started telling Tony about how he learned to bake while helping out at the inn around Christmastime, how his mother had taught him family recipes when she was feeling well enough. Tony loved the look he always got whenever he talked about his mother, though sometimes he felt a little bittersweet when it reminded him of the warmth his own childhood had lacked.
He shucked off his jeans and then just stood there, unsure of what to do now that he was all but presenting himself to Steve. Jesus Christ, this was a bad idea. At least he had left his boxers on; it was a bit too chilly in the workshop to be quite that brave.
“Any confessions to make?” The glint in his eyes was somehow challenging and hopeful at the same time.
“I guess after Pepper left… I just assumed you guys would be next. But you’re still here, God only knows why, and there’s even more of you now. Just judging by my own track record, I should’ve bolted like months ago. But I guess I’ve come to terms with the idea that you all are actually sticking around, so now I’ve gotta make sure you don’t up and die after I’ve finally decided I kinda sorta am fond of you.”
When he stepped through the front door, Steve let the brunet down and took Tony’s hands in his. “I think… all this time, I was waiting for you to find me,” Steve said before kissing the tip of Tony’s nose.
Finally, Steve met his eyes again, a determined look in them despite the blush that still tinged his cheeks. “Tony, anyone would be lucky to have you.”
“Pepper, I know I say this all the time, occasionally facetiously but most of the time genuinely, but you are the absolute best.” He let out a breath of air in relief. “Get yourself something nice from me for Christmas.”
Steve? abruptly stood up from the table, chair screeching across the floor at the sudden movement. His surliness had turned to outright anger, and it was directed right at Tony, who did well to resist squirming in his seat.
As he made his way over to the elevator, Steve noticed movement under one of the cars and knelt down to check it out. When he peeked underneath, he was met with two big yellow eyes and a fluffy orange face staring back at him.
“What? Why not?” Tony gave him a questioning look and reached out to flick open the latch on the top case anyway.
“Steve, you do know you’re not actually bulletproof, right?” Tony narrowed his eyes at Steve, exasperated fondness in the lines around his eyes.
He woke up the next morning after tossing and turning all night feeling like utter shit with a splitting headache. He supposed he deserved it, though, so he shuffled down the stairs to the kitchen to drown his pain in coffee.
Tony tried to channel the confidence and nonchalance he had whenever he was charming a room of socialites, but somehow it was so much harder with just Steve. Throwing caution to the wind, he pulled his t-shirt off over his head and tossed it over the side of the couch.
The winter sun blinded him for a moment, but when his eyes adjusted to the brightness, Tony could see a familiar form trudging through the snow towards the house. He had to blink a few times and maybe pinch himself just to be sure, but—
“Chill, guys, I won’t catnap your baby.” Sam raised his hands in surrender and rolled his eyes at their antics.
Steve gestured over to the cat, who was now stretched across the arm of the couch as if he owned the entire tower.
“You’ve never done this before, have you?” Steve mused, looking strangely fond at Tony considering his current state of… lack of clothing.
“Yeah, well, you know.” Tony waved his hand vaguely at everything spread out on the table in front of him.
This was one of Steve’s memories. Faintly, Tony can hear a voice saying something about being out of alignment, but there was another flash of blue before he could call out Steve’s name.
Steve stared him straight in the eye, his blue gaze practically frozen over with contempt now. “More than you could ever know.”
Except the main source of that warmth wasn’t the blanket, but perhaps the body heat radiating off of the super soldier who had somehow squeezed himself onto the couch behind Tony and had an arm draped sleepily around Tony’s waist.
“Wow.” Clint looked somewhat impressed at the sight of the cat peacefully curled up in Steve’s arms. “He sure likes it there, but I don’t think anyone would blame him for that.” Clint wiggled his eyebrows at him, but Steve steadfastly ignored his teasing.
“Look, it was wrong of him to just leave you like that without any explanation, but sometimes he’s just not… great with people, or dealing with… things.” Tony raised his eyebrows as the former pilot started rambling a bit. “Stark, just go talk to him. He’s holed up in our room being all mopey, and you’re both being stubborn.”
“Just some bare minimum Wikipedia browsing and maybe perusing some government files.” Tony lied, waving his hand dismissively. “This isn’t about me.”
