“...it’s perfectly natural for a child to think of their favorite superhero as their soulmate,” Anthony can hear the doctor say to Momma and Howard. “And Anthony’s fixation on Captain America is quite common.”
Bucky placed his hand on Steve’s shoulder and squeezed. He smiled softly at his friend. “Thanks, Punk.”
He looks up and twists his body toward the source of the noise. He finds Peggy Carter standing just within the periphery of his vision.
“They’re our equal in every way,” Granny McDonald chimed in, coming into Steve’s room with a bowl of hot soup in her hands. “They’re meant to be with you forever and ever.” She set the bowl on the table beside his bed and settled down into the rocking chair they kept by his bed to listen.
Cap chuckles, a smile that doesn’t reach his eyes on his face. “Now how did you know that?” he asks, a gleam in his eyes.
“Anthony,” she says gently, as she takes a seat on his bed beside his knees. He lifts his eyes up to her face, knowing that when she uses his full name, it means that the conversation they will have is Serious and that he needs to listen. Despite the pain, he’s determined to obey.
“Thanks, Jarvis,” Anthony replies, stretching a little, before wincing with a new pain in his tummy. Aunt Pegs gives him an apologetic smile, one corner of her mouth lifting slightly before it’s gone.
His father looks down at him with annoyance. “Not this again,” he says with a low growl. “How many times have I told you, Anthony? You
It was Steve’s duty not only as Bucky’s superior officer, but as his friend and brother to write to Winifred Barnes, who was practically another mother to him, and break the news to her that her son had died for his country. Even though he sent the letter days ago, Steve doesn’t remember what he wrote; he was numb the entire time and had written it almost mechanically. By the time the letter was handed off and on its way, Steve sat back in the rickety wooden chair at his desk, the whole thing leaving a horrible taste in his mouth, and he knew it wasn’t because of the glue used to seal the envelope.
Anthony listens carefully, holding his breath. Ana’s shoes click down the hall as she leaves without another word, much to his relief. He crawls out of his large bed and goes to the giant toy chest at the end of it, where Jarvis had laid out his day clothes the night before. He doesn’t bother using the toilet or brushing his teeth; his entire focus set on pulling on his clothes. It takes effort to stay upright, especially with the pain stabbing him in his belly, but he manages to do it.
“Please?” Anthony adds, wiggling his fingers in a grabbing motion and looking up at his butler with what Ana calls his ‘Bambi eyes’. Jarvis shakes his head with a laugh, lips cracking in a smile, and steps towards him.
But then just as quick, the feeling passes. The warmth from the alcohol that had been working its way through his body is burnt out, evaporated like all the water in the air of a fire. He’s left behind feeling heavy and even more aware of his surroundings than he was before. His heart crushes in his chest.
The doctors are there to greet them. He’s led into an office where Aunt Pegs helps him take off his clothes, replacing them with a hospital gown. He sits on a cold metal table with white paper on it as the doctors poke and prod at him, pressing on his tummy and making it hurt more. Anthony squirms in the itchy gown while Aunt Peggy stands behind him with a frown on her face, her eyebrows scrunched together. He scowls at the doctors, and answers their dumb endless questions with either yeses or nos. They stick a needle in him to take out some blood, and he does his best not to cry; Aunt Pegs calling him brave once it’s over makes it worth it.
It’s times like this, standing in the ruins of another town, far away from his perfect church in Brooklyn, that make Steve wish he can’t see details and colors so clearly.
He blinks again, but just blinking isn’t enough to make them disappear - it’s like staring at the fucking sun; the spots are burned into his retinas and aren’t going to leave even with an eviction notice. Bits and pieces start to come back from years before, and he feels like he’s piecing together shredded paper.
Aunt Peggy chuckles, her shoulders relaxing slightly. “It’s important they take it out, Tony,” she says as she continues rubbing his back.
“Is that your best impression of a fish, Rogers?” She’d asked with some amusement as she put her wristwatch back on.
“Would you like a lollipop, sweetheart?” asks the receptionist, interrupting Anthony’s snooping. She’s about the same height as his mother, with reddish-brown hair, and dressed in a green dress. She smiles kindly down at Anthony, holding out a couple of different colored lollipops in her manicured hands.
” she starts, her voice soothing like the lullabies she sometimes sings in Italian to him, “when he was Captain America, no one knew he was - because during the war, he was a superhero, and superheroes don’t tell anyone who they are. They keep their identities a secret, don’t they, my dove?”
the story of Joanna and the Mark would be what his brain decides to focus on in his time of trouble. He almost laughs.
Anthony immediately clamps his mouth shut and stiffens. He lowers his eyes to the floor as Aunt Pegs holds his pajamas out in front of him, shielding him from Howard’s view.
That first church he saw as a child with his Ma had been gargantuan. Inside was all polished dark wood, with arched rafters that stretched high and held up the ceiling. Tall stained glass windows lined each wall, and the pews gleamed in the candlelight. People, of all shapes and sizes, from young to old, were dressed in the finest clothes they owned. They sat in groups, some of them chatting amiably with each other, and a few with their heads bowed in prayer.
“You have me,” Rhodey replies gently. “You have Stane. You can always call your aunt, Tones, reach out for yourself. And you have your soulmate - your Swatch - ”
“Only socially,” Tony says without the usual smirk, the age-old quip familiar and spilling off his tongue easily. The joke falls flat as the doctor doesn’t glance up.
love Peggy. Not exactly like a soulmate, but he does love her, and he feels like it was close enough to matter.
He stares at the balloon as it sways slightly, and continues to watch as it turns around, until Anthony catches sight of curly white words wrapped around it. ‘It’s Your Birthday!’ it reads. He tears his eyes away from the balloon, until he notices the striped beige wallpaper behind it. Anthony squints at it, the niggling in the back of his brain telling him that he’s
Suddenly, there’s a soft warmth against Tony’s lips, and he distantly tastes something like vanilla before it’s gone.
Steve laughs at the memory of Bucky’s face now. He would have laughed at the time, if not for the fact that he had been so terrified by the uncertainty of what his lifelong friend would say that he could have died of a heart attack.
He opens his eyes and blinks blearily, his brow furrowed in concentration as he takes in his surroundings. He stares up at a pastel ceiling that’s way too high above his head. He sits up slowly, remembering that the pain in his tummy was worse whenever he tried to sit up - except now he doesn’t even feel any pain. His hands rest on the floor, and he stares down at the polished, gleaming wood under his palms. He recognizes the pattern of stains on the hardwood floor beneath his fingers, but his brain feels fuzzy and he isn’t as quick to place
“It’s...fine.” Steve said with a forced smile. He had aimed his tone to be reassuring, but looking back, he’s sure he wasn’t successful. He felt like his skin was suffocating him, and he had wanted to claw out of it. "I'll just sleep in the barracks."
There’s a pinched look that comes over Cap’s face, like he’s been hurt. It confuses Anthony for a moment just before the hero says, “Happy Birthday” with a shaking smile.
Gorgeous blue eyes swim in front of him. He blinks blearily, his vision clearing after a second. The eyes belong to an equally gorgeous face. A pale man’s face, with a square jaw and strong chin combo, cheekbones like cut diamonds, a slightly angular nose, soft blond hair that hangs just over his forehead in disarray, and pouty pink lips. A bright white light backlights him, making his golden hair gleam with an ethereal glow.
“So what’re we supposed to do?” asks Morita. “I mean, it’s not like we can just knock on the front door--”
There’s a noise in the destroyed pub, almost like a cry of agonized pain, and it takes a moment for Steve to realize that the noise had been ripped from his own throat. He never knew he could feel such pain before; the grief he’d felt for both his mother and his adopted grandmother seem insignificant in comparison. But it’s the first time that Steve’s
Once the doctor leaves, though, his family holds his birthday party in his hospital room. He stays in bed, gleefully unwrapping each gift, taking care not to rest any of them on his tummy, which is still in some pain. He presents all the birthday cards to Aunt Pegs so she can hold them. He thanks each person for their gift extra enthusiastically before his aunt even has a chance to give him a pointed look. It’s decided that they won’t have birthday cake, but they’ll save it for later when he can enjoy it. Anthony’s disappointed but glad all the same.
before he turns around and kneels down in front of Anthony again. The warm smile is back on Cap’s lips. “Here you go,” he says, holding the toy out for Anthony to take.
When Johnson’s glassy eyes had focussed on the tent above him, and when the realization of where he was hit him, his face fell and his eyes looked like the light had gone out before they quickly welled up with tears. Steve hadn’t yet seen a man break apart before, but Johnson shattered like a glass window after meeting a baseball. His chest heaved as he gasped for breath, and his face was streaked with a flood of tears that wouldn’t stop. His voice broke on a sob, and his hand clenched the gray sheet over his stomach; he sounded like he was in pain.
“Don’t you dare say that,” she growls, her voice cutting like steel. “If anyone deserves a soulmate, Steve Rogers,
“When’s the last time you left the science labs, Tones?” asks Rhodey with an amused shake of his head. “There’ve been student demonstrations for
Steve takes a walk. He leaves from the civilian entrance, the one that goes out onto one of the busiest streets of London. He’s expecting the cool air of the city and relishes it. But the minute he steps outside, the smell of burnt brick assaults his nose and the taste of gravelly ash coats his tongue.
yourself,” she continues. “Allow Barnes the dignity of his choice.” She huffs and readjusts herself in her seat. “He damn well must have thought you were worth it.”
The memory sneaks up on Steve, slowly drawing him close and he sinks into it willingly; like laying back onto a comfortably well-worn chair after a hard day. It’s like he’s back to that night; watching himself weave through the group of soldiers and dancers, and going to stand at Bucky’s side.
no problem!” Steve whispered indignantly, gripping the stick he’d been whittling and his pocketknife so tight, he was seconds away from snapping both in half. “Okay? There’s none! I’m just not attracted to her, and you’re making it out like we’re
She takes one of his hands, red nails flashing briefly in the light, and lays her other hand on his back to rub circles. Her eyes are warm as they stare down at him. “The doctors and I spoke. You have what is called appendicitis, which means your appendix, an organ in your body, is the cause of your pain and they have to take it out.”
crying. But losing Bucky is a strange and staggering new experience for Steve. He wishes he could cry. Bucky deserves that much: to be mourned properly.
It felt like his insides had been cut loose, and they had fallen to his feet in a heap. Steve couldn’t breathe, and for a moment it was like he was asthmatic again: struggling to draw in air. It took all his focus to stay standing upright instead of falling to the ground. He took a deep breath. “How bad?” he croaked, his fists clenched at his side to ground him.
Tony remembers, vaguely, of seeing that same color on a wrist, and a conversation at a kitchen table in a brightly lit room.
Rhodey’s arms completely envelope him in a hug. Tony’s nose presses into the skin of his friend’s throat as he's held securely.
It’s the magnitude of bodies that convinces Tony he needs to step away, be by himself for a while to cool off; he’s feeling so hot and sweaty all of a sudden. As he makes his way down the hall, he takes sips at the big bottle of scotch; relishing the burn down his throat while he passes by people grinding against the wall and making out with each other.
for making me laugh. The Blitz took place during 1940-1941, so it wouldn't have made sense that the bar in CA:TFA had been bombed since the movie takes place during and after 1943. Despite the history, I opted to follow movie canon.
why this hug feels familiar, and it’s pretty depressing he didn’t realize it earlier. But then again, he hasn’t been hugged this way in a
He knows it’s selfish, especially when he thinks back on all the battles he’s been involved with as Captain America, watching as men younger than him were blown to bits right in front of him. Or when he’d liberated prisoners of war and saw with his own eyes men who were tortured and starved, or when he’s in the trenches and knows that there are soldiers who are having limbs amputated in medical tents all across Europe while he’s busy trying to bring down Hydra.
Anthony nods his head, staring down at his toes, gripping his shirt tightly in his hands. “Howard Stark. He’s my father,” Anthony murmurs.
“Hello darling,” Aunt Peggy greets him as she leans forward and gives his ankle a reassuring squeeze.
friend that doesn’t require a charging station - to believe his story about dreaming that Captain America was his
Sure, he’s had hugs from Rhodey before, but those were mostly bro-hugs: made up of back pats, and three seconds of arms wrapped around each other. But this - this one is different. Yet, it feels oddly familiar after a half-second of contact, and Tony isn’t sure why.
“Tell me more about this ‘Steve’,” the doctor said, looking down at Anthony over the frame of his glasses.
So no, he didn’t really hate being Captain America. Not until the cost of putting on the stars and stripes meant losing Bucky. He hadn’t...he’d never factored that as a possibility: that he could lose Bucky while he was out there with him. That wasn’t supposed to happen. What good is it being physically capable of anything, when he can’t even save his best friend?
A giant, dark wood hutch stands against the far wall ahead of him, cluttered with framed photos, a few awards, and some medals resting on its three shelves. A couple steps away from the hutch is a glass display case that’s taller than him filled with bright comic books. But it’s the space separating the two pieces that captures Anthony’s attention, causing his jaw to drop.
It’s a long time before the tears are squeezed dry from his eyes. Once he’s done, he settles back into his chair, hands limp on the table’s surface, and legs sprawled out underneath. He feels like a towel wrung dry: limp and lackluster, while all at once feeling numb and raw inside his chest and lungs. The grief settles onto his shoulders, becoming a part of him now, almost like a birthmark in a secret place: something private that only he can see whenever he wants.
“Yeah. Yeah.” Steve nodded his head jerkily, his throat dry as he tried repeatedly to swallow and gather words.
shatters the silence. Alarmed, he quickly lifts his boot away. But instead of crushed bones of an animal or a person like he had been expecting, his eyes meet a shattered pane of glass. Steve's heart clenches at the sight of the cobwebbed, ashen shards on the dusty floor.
He looks over at the door on his right, that leads into the room where the doctor is talking to Momma and Howard. It’s open a crack, and if Anthony leans forward enough, he can just see the blonde curls that make up the back of his Momma’s head.
Tony frowns, and lifts his left dark braceleted wrist in response. “That’s kinda rude to ask, isn’t it?”
Steve stopped whittling outright. Frowning, he angled his head to stare at his friend in confusion. “What date?”
Marching through the small town behind the regiment of soldiers that the Commandos had been travelling with, his own team behind him, Steve’s thoughts kept going back to Brooklyn. It’s so easy to replace the remains of these destroyed places with his own neighborhood, and imagining that it had been the church he and Bucky would go in place of what had been burned to the ground behind him. For these people, the church must have been the center of their whole world, just as Brooklyn had been his.
He had still been colorblind at the time, only able to see reds and greens, often confusing yellows and blues, so he hadn’t known that when the sun hit the glass just right, bright light projected bursts of brilliant color onto the faces of the men and women gathered together. It hadn’t been the few colors he could make out that drew him to them, anyway. What had captured his attention was the compositions of the windows themselves. He was transfixed by the thick, dark lines that wove their way through each character and each pane of glass, yet instead of separating them, united them. The details amazed him the most: the delicate lines in a person’s hair, the bunched fabric in an arched knee, the smooth texture on a cup. The play of shadows and light, the reverence displayed on a person’s face, the gesturing of their hands--all of it left him awestruck.
Steve blinked down at his friend. He’d very rarely seen his friend so solemn that it was often a shock in these rare moments that Steve considered them precious examples of the trust Bucky had in him, and treasured every one of them. Because of it, Steve was compelled to agree. “I promise, Buck. I promise I’ll try.”
He stops walking. A crumpled sign on the ground in front of him amongst a pile of ash blocks his path. Curious, he crouches down and runs his hand along the front of it, scraping off the blackened dust.
Even though they were both Markless, their attitudes about it were completely different. Bucky was more cynical about soulmates, whereas Steve was more optimistic. Instead of looking down at his blank wrist and wondering with hope in his heart and a smile on his face what his soulmate would be like, Bucky sneered derisively whenever he was reminded of it. Whenever Steve spoke excitedly about the subject of Marks or soulmates, Bucky would make a face or roll his eyes, but he always listened to what Steve had to say and even had a word or two to contribute, but mostly didn’t enjoy talking about Marks or soulmates.
Even though he’s Markless, it doesn’t make Steve bitter. Not always, anyway; only on the worst days does he feel any sort of anger. But on the good days, he’s optimistic. Either way, the fact that he’s Markless doesn’t diminish the comfort he gets from rubbing the band he keeps on his wrist, or his enjoyment of rereading the passage about Joanna from the Bible, or change the way he feels about himself.

Also me: But this is an AU already?! And the outline stuff's already different?? Ah fuck it let's break things.
Anthony gazes down at his wrist, smiling, waiting for a colorful Mark of his own to magically appear.
, neither gave him the time of day--what had bothered him was was that they were Markless. Before Bucky had shipped out, Steve and him would always get into an argument over it.
“Hey Tony, want some company?” asks a sultry voice as Tony passes. He doesn’t even spare them a glance.
Once there’s a lapse in spewing, Tony spits into the toilet with disgust at the whole situation. He manages - barely - to lift his cheek off the lip of the toilet and turn his head to look at his companion. The voice turns out to belong to a black guy - older than him, probably in his twenties - the sides of his head shaved and a small afro of hair above his forehead. He’s wearing a red jacket, obviously trying to look like Michael Jackson in that one video. He has a hand on Tony’s shoulder.
a Christian church--it might have been a temple, for all he can tell. There’s no roof above his head, or any walls left standing to box him in. There’s only small indications of what it had once been--a few blackened slabs of wood left standing, like ribs poking out of the charred earth. Black ash covered the ground, mingling with the dry brown dirt, shattered glass, and rubble where there had once been an altar.
. It’s touching, really, that all these people would offer their best wishes and prayers to Steve, but...
Steve isn’t worth it, is the thing. His life isn’t worth Bucky’s death. If given the option to exchange his life for Bucky’s, Steve wouldn’t hesitate. He’d choose Bucky over himself every single damn time.

“That’s all that means, honey,” Sarah cut in with a small smile, turning back to him. “Anyone without a Mark just means their soulmate hasn’t been brought onto this Earth yet.”
The sun shines through the stained glass window of his bedroom, sending bright bursts of blues and pinks and yellows onto the hardwood floor. Birds are singing, and from that same window he can see the clear blue sky peeking through the clear unpainted glass. He rises slowly, feeling a little groggy, and tired, but most of all hot, almost like he’s sick. There’s also a pain in his tummy that makes him whine softly, clutching one of the larger pillows on his bed tightly to his stomach, curling into his knees and tucking his toes in tight.
Anthony peeks into the keyhole of the door. His father stands with his back to his aunt, a glass of his special drink in one hand. At the sight of it, Anthony immediately remembers the hard slap Howard gave his cheek after drinking a few glasses of the stuff. He cringes, and shifts, biting his lip to keep from crying out for his aunt.
At his New Year’s Eve party the week after his parents’ car accident, there is a sea of people bobbing up and down in time to the loud, thumping music that makes the walls of the Malibu mansion bounce. The glittering lights of the disco ball suspended from the ceiling of the entry room stains the skin of the partygoers purple or green. When Tony looks out on the dance-floor, everything’s so distorted: faces are twisted and doubled, sometimes tripled. Instead of individual people, he sees a literal monster made up of multiple heads and limbs convulsing and moving to the music.
“It’s very important, and only a very special person can do the job,” he says very seriously, his barely-visible eyebrow lifts underneath his helmet. “Think you can do it?”
“Oof!” She grunts eloquently as she catches him; wrapping him up completely in both arms. “Tony!” She exclaims with a bright grin as she lowers him to the ground, kneeling down in front of him, her brown eyes shining.
As for Steve, he wrote only one letter, and he would much rather not write another one like it. Though Bucky was a trouble-shooting sniper and a member of the Howling Commandos, he was also Sergeant Barnes, and Steve is Captain Rogers: his superior officer. Even though he had offers from others to take over the horrible privilege of writing Bucky’s family about his death, Steve refused them all.
“I’ll tell you in the morning,” he promises, and Anthony can feel the rumbling of the words against his cheek. “I promise. For now, go to sleep.”
. They would have been pleased with him; they wouldn’t have been able to help their bragging about him and would take every chance they got to embarrass him when he would return home on leave.
“Not alotta them agree with you,” he quietly informs him. “Most woulda already taken ‘vantage of the sitch - ” Tony frowns in concentration. “Sitchu...sit..”
He blinks, looking around at his room in confusion, wondering why he’s awake before the pressure gets worse and he realizes that he has to pee.
Steve lifts a hand, placing it on top of Bucky’s and gives it an answering squeeze. The thought is only a small consolation; they both know that it won’t be the last ruined church that they will march past that day.
“It’s the same color as Ana’s eyes,” Anthony murmurs quietly to himself, then looks back up at his guardian. Anthony squints, leaning forward slightly to look into Jarvis’s eyes, and after a moment his own widen in realization. “It’s like
“I’m really not bothered,” Bucky said seriously once a comfortable silence settled over them. “I don’t care if you like dames, or guys, or if neither of ‘em float your boat. You’re like a brother to me, Stevie, and I love you. I’m with you till the end of the line.”
This had horrified Steve at first, especially when Bucky would drag him along on a double date. It wasn’t the fact that the dates were women--it wouldn’t matter if they were
“Haven’t you noticed that about ninety percent of the student population don’t wear soul bands?” asks Rhodey.
Tony blinks, the question out of left field. “Yeah,” he replies, “when I was a kid. It happened on my fifth birthday.” His eyebrows pinch together. “Why?”
“Don’t you dare apologize,” she says sternly, but there are still traces of heartbreak in her voice. “I wouldn’t trade the time we had for the war. Now, no more tears, hm? You’ll make my mascara run.” She lets out a wet chuckle.
sexes, Steve still firmly believes in waiting for the right partner. No matter how much time may pass before he meets his soulmate, he’s determined to wait. He doesn’t know what will be between their legs, but he
The doctor turns back to Tony, and picks her clipboard back up. “Now,” she says with a sigh. “I have a few questions left that I hope you won’t mind me asking. They’re just routine, and you don’t have to answer if you don’t want to, or if they feel invasive.”
Peggy reached a hand out and laid it gently over his wrist. Steve could swear he felt tingles run up his arm at the contact. He lifted his gaze and met her golden brown eyes.
Flinging himself down onto the cramped settee, the bottle of scotch threatens to spill before he rights himself and his grip. Sprawling his legs out before taking a swig, he stares up at the wood-panelled ceiling, his vision swimming. Distantly, he notes that his chest hurts, and is aware enough to raise his hand to rub the center of it, unfortunately releasing his grip on the bottle, which clatters to the floor.
Tony thinks before blinking in realization and laughing; he laughs so hard he can feel tears streaming down his face.
,” Momma says in relief, leaning forward to grip his tiny hand in hers. Howard gives a disapproving frown from behind her, but he plasters on another one of his fake smiles when he catches Anthony looking at him. The hardness in his eyes remain.
“Oh. Er,” Tony starts, wrinkling his forehead in thought. He remembers how cold the operating room had been, and the immediate warmth that engulfed him in the dream almost as soon as he went to sleep on the table. “It was toasty. Nice.”
“You know you can always talk to me about anything, right?” he asks gently, and Tony feels like that stupid kid puking his brains out at that frat party all over again.
It wasn’t long after their conversation that the doctor had asked Anthony’s parents into his office and Momma told him to wait out here for them.
He stares at the large map, so big that takes up the entire wall across from his seat, as the words are tossed around him. He glances down at the photographs scattered around the table that their intelligence agents were able to gather. Mostly he just watches the familiar faces of the people he cares about gathered around him, thoughts and plans swirling around in his head; each one he turns over to examine before letting them go. He focuses his attention back to his team: Howard Stark, the Colonel, and Agent Carter.
were you thinking?” Rhodey finally explodes, and Tony would feel relief if it weren’t for the fact that his best friend is
Anthony glances around the room, an idea forming in his brain. He sees more posters of Cap; in each one he’s in a different action pose, shield on his arm and a myriad of colors around him. Anthony fidgets as more and more evidence begins to point to his idea being correct. There’s another glass display case that faces the entrance of the room, it’s taller than Anthony can ever reach - it almost touches the ceiling! - with dozens and dozens of toys inside.
He stares down at it, his brow furrowed in confusion. He raises his head to look at her. She gives him a pointed look, with comfort in her brown eyes, before she turns around to follow the rest of the team out.
“What other explanation is there?” Aunt Peggy asks, staring expectantly at him. “He couldn’t have known.
His body heaves as he spews chunks of what may have or may not have been nachos and cheese, and a yellowish looking liquid that makes Tony think
at him. Rhodey throws his hands in the air and starts pacing the large hospital room, taking on the characteristics of a caged lion.
The night air had been crisp, clean and clear, nothing like the dry stuffiness of the pub Steve’s sitting in now. He and Bucky could make out every star above their heads in the inky black-blue of the night sky, and the moon shone so brightly that they could see without a fire. It was something they had never been able to experience growing up in the glowing lights of New York until they had been sent across the world to fight on the battlefield, and Steve still thought it was the most amazing thing.

thing,” starts Rhodey, and Tony can tell from his tone that he’s building towards something. “Considering everything else you manage to toss out the window.”
Jarvis holds his left arm out for Anthony to look at, and uses his other hand to pull one of the chairs closer to sit down next to him. Anthony wraps his small hands gently around Jarvis’s wrist, careful not to hurt him. He stares down at the swatch of green, with the same attention he gives his Cap comic books. It’s the shape and size of a quarter, just an inch below Jarvis’s palm. It looks like someone took a crayon to Jarvis’s wrist and completely filled in a circle, but it’s a neat swirl of color. Not wobbly, or even a little bit out of an invisible line. Perfect.
His grip on the controller never wavers. He wonders at his soulmate’s future. At the future they’ll have without him.
One of the doctors comes back into the room, and quickly explains - in small words that make Anthony frown in offense - what they’re going to do. Soon more doctors file in, fluttering around the room like sea green butterflies as they go about their tasks. They lower Anthony’s bed, so that he’s lying flat on his back and staring up at the bright fluorescent lights. They wheel him out into the hospital hallway, where he’s pushed past Aunt Pegs and the Jarvises.
“Hi,” greets Anthony shyly, his hands at his sides, squeezing his pajama pants tightly. He stares up at his hero, awestruck that
“I was back on my family’s cottage,” Johnson explained, a pained smile on his lips as tears continued to flow. “It was out in the country and we’d go there every summer. And he was there. My Freddie--oh God!” His face crumpled in agony. “My Freddie! He’d died! He’s gone! I’d seen it with my own eyes: he was blown up in The Blitz--”
Besides, how do I explain to a child that the reason he saw Captain America - the reason he saw his soulmate - is because he’s
Anthony raises an eyebrow at her. She lifts her finger and points to something that he can’t see without turning his head.
Cap nods curtly as he rises on his feet. Once he’s standing again, he looks down at Anthony like he’s the best thing ever, his eyes bright. He holds out his left hand to Anthony and offers a smile. “Wanna come with me?” he asks.
The doctor nods, a few strands of her dark hair pulling free of her ponytail as she writes down his response on her silver clipboard. Tony resists the urge to squirm.
“I never said that, Buck,” Steve said in exasperation. “I said I see your point in Markless people finding happiness in each other, and that

“It means that you can’t tell anybody,” Howard interjects sourly. Momma’s eyes flick over at Howard and the corners of her lips turn down.
; no more than burnt up and scattered ash on the ground, and that’s what hurts the most, what makes Steve feel like he’s been eviscerated.
A sharp pain stabs Tony just above his eye that makes him groan loudly. He leans his forehead against the cool porcelain of the toilet. “Gimme a minute an’ I’ll let you know how that goes.”
that you’re alright, we will have your party.” Her tone doesn’t allow argument, even as Jarvis speaks into the phone behind her.
“No one told me, if that’s what you’re wondering,” Bucky assured. Steve had, and felt a brief relief at the reassurance. “You remember Eugene Lebowitz? You would make moon eyes at him whenever we were together, and when his family moved away, you moped around for about a month.”
He had looked quickly away. His heart thudded against his chest, and sweat broke out along his brow. He counted to ten before he tried to speak again.
They sat there, allowing the quiet stillness to settle over them. Bucky sat up, the gravel crunching underneath him as he redistributed his weight. Steve’s shoulders tensed, his spine going rigid. He dropped the stick he’d been whittling between his legs, and snapped his pocketknife closed.
Tony’s best friend stands in the corner, the flourescent light of the room unflattering on his skin. His chiseled arms are at his sides, his olive green T-shirt stretching the width of his shoulders, jaw tense, and staring at Tony with hard, accusatory eyes. He raises one eyebrow, and somehow he looks more imposing than Obie
There’s no time to waste after the conference ends; the Commandos immediately exit the room, going to gear up and ship out. Steve’s just preparing to follow when Peggy stops him in his tracks.
Adrenaline spikes through his veins as he runs past Allied soldiers and members of Hydra alike; he’s hyper-aware of the fighting going on around him, but it’s nothing except flashes of movement in the periphery of his eyes. He doesn’t stop for breath unless he’s forced to, and it’s in those moments that he’s able to really see the soldiers that are turned into literal dust around him. He’s almost hit a few times, but it’s thanks to Howard’s shield that he’s been able to deflect the shots fired at and around him.
The doctor’s brow was furrowed by the end of the story. “I see,” he said, but Anthony’s sure he doesn’t see at all.
Peggy’s eyebrows were drawn together, her eyes soft with regret. “There is nothing left of the building.”
, or whatever the hell you want to call the stupid thing!” He rips the black soul band off his wrist - one of Howard’s gifts to him, he thinks distantly - and shows his best friend the pale empty stripe of skin.
It’s almost like being colorblind again, back when his world dreary and bleak. When he had emerged from the pod after Project Rebirth had been successful, in between his deep lungfuls of air--something that he only did when he had an asthma attack--he was astonished by the amount of
“Sorry,” he says, putting his latest project into a folder titled Wherefore Art Thou Mark?, and shoving it aside for later. “Could you repeat that?”
that the man wasn’t there before, but he can’t think of how he wouldn’t have noticed the man entering the room.
<A gray mark,> she whispered, switching back to Gaelic as she took both Steve and his Ma’s hands in hers, <means that their soulmate has died.>
Steve’s breath catches in his throat at the sudden memory of his mother. He closes his eyes tightly, the tears still flowing. Of
Now he hates the shield. He hates the burden of it. He hates that he’ll never be done. He curses what he’s done to himself; that he boxed himself into a corner by his own sense of duty and responsibility. He’s given this one chance to be
,” his momma continues, “but Steve died to protect people. And the best way to keep Steve’s memory alive is to honor what he did for us, and to do that, we have to keep his name a secret.
“Aunt Pegs!” Anthony cries in delight once he catches sight of her. Before he can think better of it, he takes off into a running leap, and springs into his aunt’s waiting arms.
“A Mark is a patch of color on a person’s left wrist,” Jarvis explains, nodding down at the color in Anthony’s hand. “It helps a person find their soulmate.”
“Steve Rogers, you are treating me like your personal secretary,” she huffs. “You can thank her yourself--”
“Why should my having a Mark change the way I feel about myself?” Peggy challenged gently, leaning forward and staring into his eyes intently, her grip on his wrist tightening. “Having a Mark shouldn’t change how one feels about oneself. I love myself as I am without the help of a soulmate. I know my value, Rogers. I don’t need the opinion of a soulmate to validate it.”
“Yeah, champ, don’t do that again,” Howard says with a chuckle, reaching over and giving Anthony’s hair a tussle that makes him cringe at the contact. “Had to cancel a very important meeting because of you. Obadiah won’t be too happy about that.”
But he could hardly blame them their disappointment. After all, a guy can only take so many 4Fs before it began to make him feel desperate for a chance. He would have gotten a kick out of their reactions, though: super soldier wandering around Europe with a team of the best men he knew, chasing after Hydra. It sounds like the kind of science fiction he’d read as a kid; something straight out of
There’s a comfortable silky sensation that’s wrapped around him but it doesn’t block out the cold air, and there’s something hard underneath his head. It feels entirely too different from where he just was, where everything was toasty warm and comfy, and where he felt safe in Cap’s arms. He opens his eyes.
adult in the neighborhood. He braces himself, for what is no doubt going to be the skinning of a century.
Markless is viewed as a pedophile. Steve knows it isn’t fair; no one gets to decide when their soulmate will be born, and speaking as someone without a Mark, he would much prefer to have a soulmate already alive than not even conceived yet. As much as Steve hated wearing a band over his left wrist, back in New York it was easier to give people less ammunition to use against him when he had so many health issues and a stiff wind could knock him flat.
,” Cap says - he forgot! - smiling. He reaches a gloved hand out and ruffles Anthony’s hair, making his heart do a funny dance against his ribs. “You’re a sharp kid, Anthony.”
Before he was nine, he hadn’t known anyone else who was Markless until Bucky had helped him out in their first fight. Steve doesn’t even remember what it had been about anymore, but they’d managed to drive the bullies off, until it was just him and Bucky alone in the alley. Bucky had looked down at Steve and smiled a bloody grin. Then he stretched out his left hand to help Steve up, and Steve was startled to see a wrist that was just as blank as his own. They’d been best friends ever since.
Whenever he allows himself to think about it, Steve can’t imagine a life where he’s married to a woman and still attracted to men. The whole thing fills him with confusion. Before he understood that he wasn’t like normal boys, the idea of someone being his other half, being a person who would complete him, made him so excited; he couldn’t wait to meet them.
He wants to tell Rhodey, he really does. The last person he’d had conversations concerning his Mark with had been Jarvis - a slice of agonizing grief cuts through Tony at the thought of his deceased butler/father figure, but just as quick is gone again - in addition to the therapist his parents sent him to as a kid, and he could use another person to support him.
excited! Even though Jarvis said his parents won’t be back from their trip in time, he’s still happy.)
“Thankfully not, but the city took quite the beating. Many people have been left homeless due to it.”
Steve’s eyes catch on one of the soldiers as they approach--Horowitz, Steve thinks absently. He and his companion, Edwards, are beside one of the more ruined buildings; the entire place is nothing but blackened ash and collapsed plaster, a door the only thing left standing. They’re quietly conversing--about what, Steve can’t be sure. Horowitz turns to Edwards, his shoulders beginning to shake. Steve’s ears pick up sniffles.
He sobers suddenly at the thought of them listening to him describe days like yesterday: standing in the church, picking up pieces of charred wreckage to look for survivors, and in the end finding only a ghost of a town. Even the thought of them knowing that on his travels, he is constantly witnessing the destruction caused by war. His chest aches; they would have been saddened by this war. It’s best they’re gone now, he reasons, then they don’t have to see what the world’s become.
“You did - ” Rhodey blinks at him like he was just slapped across the face, and there’s hurt and betrayal in his eyes. The look makes Tony’s stomach churn before it’s immediately replaced with burning rage. “What did you think was gonna happen when you mixed
“Yeah I guess not e’ry teen genius gets to go to M’T,” Tony slurs, closing his eyes as he lays his head back down onto the rim of the toilet seat.
Jarvis went to all the trouble of getting everything ready: from decorating for the party, arranging for Anthony’s favorite foods to be prepared, to picking up Aunt Pegs from the airport -
to Captain America. Much like with their parents, children aren’t aware that their parents have an outside identity that’s separate from what they are to their children. It’s more often than not that they will call him ‘Captain’ or ‘Mr. America’, or sometimes use his whole title.
The walk down was dimly lit by the lights above, and he only passed a few people on his way. It had felt strange to be walking down the long corridor towards a place he’d never really been before except in passing. Of course he knew where the barracks were, but because he was Captain America, he had his own place to call his own. After months on the road at a time camping with Bernie, who played Hitler in the USO show, and then weeks with the Howling Commandos on their missions, he’d always been grateful to have his own space.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Rhodey grumbles. “You have standards - you like your girls with a little bit of brains.”
It doesn’t stop him from wondering about the nameless person he has yet to meet that is meant for him.
His heart sinks to know that he isn’t stuck with Bucky now. His heart feels heavy with an ache that makes him scratch at his chest. His head hurts something fierce with a pounding that feels like his head will burst, and there’s a pang in his chest that becomes too much and he’s struggling to breathe. His skin feels like a suit that’s two sizes too small, suffocating him and scratching at him. His wrist where his Mark should be begins to burn, and Steve claws at his soul band, expecting to find a swatch of color--
It isn’t long before his thoughts circle back to The Train. Steve keeps running it through his head. If he’d been quicker to get up after being knocked into the side of the train, if he’d done his job and knocked out that Hydra goon right when he saw him, if his aim wasn’t off, if he hadn’t been fooling around and
Without walls to obstruct his view, Steve can clearly see the terrain of what’s left of the tiny town.
Staring at the wallpaper is a good distraction for one or two minutes as he sits just outside the doctor’s office, but not for much longer. The chair he’s in is so tall, that his feet dangle over the edge. Cap sits in the chair beside him, legs outward and back straight.
Steve looks around the room, at the sleeping forms of soldiers lying in their beds. He envies them their peaceful slumber. His nightmares have been plaguing him for days, tainting any wink of sleep he’s been trying to get.
Steve clasped his hands over his bent knees, pausing in his whittling. “She does, doesn’t she?” Steve asked. “Too bad she’s English.” He said with such seriousness that Bucky laughed.
“Of Brooklyn Heights, New York,” Steve confirms, a small smile tugging on his lips. “And tell her I’m sorry. I’m sorry I’m not…”
He huffs a laugh. “What’ver you say,” Tony says groggily, shifting his legs underneath him into a more comfortable position. The guy’s hovering beside him, hands close but not touching him.
There had been a smile on Jarvis’s face, but now it drops, and he lowers his eyes, eyebrows scrunching together. Anthony frowns in confusion; wondering why Jarvis looks like he’s in pain. Then, just as quickly, the look disappears and it's replaced with a smile. But this smile isn’t like any of Jarvis’s other smiles, the ones that make Anthony’s insides feel warm and happy - it’s like Howard’s: forced and
“Soulmate?” Anthony asks, brushing his thumb tentatively against the patch of color, expecting it to come off like paint - but it stays exactly where it is.
They had been sitting side-by-side, talking about nothing until a comfortable silence settled over them. As Steve was whittling something from a stick with his pocketknife, Bucky spoke up again from his sprawl on the dusty earth.
“Soulmates, I know,” Bucky said with a disgusted grunt and a roll of his eyes. “Weren’t you the one who was just saying that you didn’t believe in that mumbo-jumbo anymore?”
the striped wallpaper. There are wrapped presents, big and small, scattered around the room that make it look a lot smaller than it did before he went into surgery.
No matter how surrounded he is, Tony is achingly aware of how alone he actually is. Frowning, he takes a sip from the bottle of scotch he happens to be carrying, the burn down his throat momentarily dulls the pain.
that they’re in Trouble, and a shield strapped to his arm and little white wings on his blue helmet.
He turns around and takes in Howard’s Captain America room. Even though he knows that he’ll get in trouble for being in his father’s room, the familiarity of it soothes him. Spending all that time in the hospital had been scary and exhausting, and it’s so nice being in a space without bright blinding lights in his eyes, or nosy doctors poking him and asking him a bajillion dumb questions, or dressed in any itchy hospital gowns.
“The marks aren’t gray, sweetheart,” his Ma replied with a kind smile. “They come in all sorts of colors--beautiful, beautiful colors--until they turn gray.”
“Not attract--” Bucky sputtered, as though the very idea were impossible. “Why not?” He asked, offended on Peggy’s behalf. “What’s wrong with her? Don’t you
“That’s a wonderful name,” says Cap, with a reassuring smile that makes the nervous knot in Anthony’s belly ease, and his heart pound harder. “How old are you, Anthony?”
Steve was silent as he mulled this over. “But someone who could love you unconditionally? Doesn’t that--”
She stares down at the ground. Her back is to Anthony, and she must make a face because Howard takes a sip of his drink.
“But not all Marks are gray,” Granny McDonald began again, in English this time. “They only go gray when a person’s soulmate dies. When both soulmates are alive, they come in all sorts of beautiful colors. That’s how soulmates find each other: the colors of their Mark will match the other’s. My Albert and I had green ones before he passed.” She touched the green band on her left wrist in quick acknowledgement.
The puzzle slowly begins to come together, and it’s like fog clearing, making Anthony’s eyes widen. The white ‘A’, the colors of his uniform - then he sees the large round shield strapped to the man’s left arm. Even though Anthony can only see the inside of the shield, he
Steve catches the shield thrown to him and runs down the corridors of the Hydra base, chasing after Schmidt.
“Cap, we gotta get going,” Bucky says, interrupting Steve’s thoughts. Bucky’s boots crunch loudly on the splintered wood as he navigates his way towards Steve.
since I last saw you!” She runs her long fingers through his dark, unruly hair. She has that wide-eyed look adults get when they haven’t seen him in a while. “And so handsome!”
“I wouldn’t,” he tries before the words get tangled up. Then he tries again. “You don’t deserve to get a gray Mark because of me.”
“Wha’s with the disgust?” asks Tony, before he shakes his head. “Wha’ver man. I’ve sucked enough of your guys’s dicks to know y’don really care whose lips are on your cocks, s’long as I don’t talk to you tomorrow - ”
But then Aunt Peggy’s hand lays gently on Anthony’s forehead, he feels the coolness of her wedding ring pressing against his skin, and her delight is instantly replaced with an expression of worry. “Tony, you’re burning up!” She cries, eyebrows furrowing. “Are you alright?”
“Steve,” she said gently. “There are plenty of things I value more than a soulmate. A Mark doesn’t bring respect or validation. Even if I had a Mark, I’m still a woman, and would still be treated as less than a man.”
“Anthony, you can’t tell anyone that Steve is Captain America,” Howard tells him as they’re driving in the car. Howard’s face is pinched and he has a frown on his face.
The plane descends quickly into a nosedive, the wind whistling past Steve’s ears as he hurdles towards the water. He’s falling so fast that the momentum is making tears well up in his eyes. At least that’s what he tells himself. Steve can’t help but glance at his red gloved wrist; imagining a beautiful swatch of color underneath. He would always rely on the color palette in his head to dictate his Mark’s color, and any situation he found himself in, he’d pick a different color.
Tony stops fiddling with a circuit board at Rhodey’s desk. He blinks, then turns in the chair to look at him, screwdriver in hand. His best friend’s sprawled out on his twin-sized bed, studying one of the annoyingly large textbooks that he refuses to let Tony buy him to save the financial aid dollars.
Howard scoffs but does as suggested. The door closes softly behind him, and Anthony lets out a breath of relief as Aunt Pegs turns back to face him.
Anthony’s eyes focus on Jarvis at the sink as he gets ready to clean the dirty dishes from lunch. The sun streams in from the small kitchen window, its rays licking the floral curtains and lighting up Jarvis’s face with a golden glow. Jarvis’s wristwatch is at his side on the red brick counter and his shirt sleeves are rolled up. But there’s a dark spot on his butler’s wrist he’s never seen before.
Tony stares down into the disgusting muddy mess inside the toilet bowl, studying the lumpy mysterious chunks before lifting a heavy hand onto the silver knob and flushing it. His head pounds painfully between his temples, and somehow the latest conversation he had with Ana before he left the Malibu estate swims through his mind.
After undressing and preparing for sleep, Steve climbed into bed, flinging the gray itchy blanket over his legs and laid his head down onto the flat pillow. He had finally found a position that could have been loosely called comfortable with his back to the door of the barracks. He was just closing his eyes, when the door banged open and the loud, obnoxious voices of the soldiers filled the room; their voices reverberating off the curved, concrete walls.
“There you go,” says a deep soothing voice, and there’s a pressure on his side. A hand rubs around and over his back in circular motions as Tony continues to vomit. “Let it all out, tough guy.”
“Look for any survivors!” he yells out, once the Commandos get closer and Bucky’s at his back. “Search everywhere!”
Steve winces slightly; Winnie Barnes’ hot temper is notoriously famous in Brooklyn Heights. She has scolded many a kid
“Dunno,” Tony shrugs, twisting the screwdriver between his fingers. “Just seems like the kinda thing that people would care about.”
Unable to help himself, though, Steve quickly glances back over at them again. Now separated from each other, the only point of contact between the two men is Edwards’ hand clutching Horowitz’s left wrist. In between Edwards’ gently stroking fingers, Steve manages to catch a glimpse of the orange soulmark on Horowitz’s wrist beneath his army-issued soul band. Steve’s going to have to make sure Horowitz and Edwards have some time alone together once they’ve passed through this town; they deserve that much.
There’s a long, drawn out silence before Anthony feels a gloved hand grip his chin gently. He lifts his head up at the contact, and stares into Cap’s eyes. They’re not like before; instead of warm and gentle, they look bright and determined - like he’s going into a fight.
He keeps walking. He doesn’t care where, just away. He lets his thoughts wander, as he passes familiar streets and strangers straggling out in the grim daylight. He’s never thought of London as a home, Brooklyn will always be his home. But after being transferred out here, the city had almost felt comforting and familiar after being away so long in the fight. Coming back to London after being gone for months at a time, felt almost as good as coming home to his Ma after a long day of doing everything and nothing with Bucky. That’s how it had felt now during the war: that they were doing what they always did, only this time with guns and destruction instead of sticks and baseballs.
“No,” Johnson croaked through his tears, shaking his head, his hair scraping against the poor excuse for a pillow. He screwed his eyes shut. “But I’m reliving the worst kind of pain.”
The first Mass he’d ever attended was the first time in months that he’d been well enough to get out of bed. Once his Ma had finished taking his temperature and found him healthy for the day, she’d thrown her hands up in the air, and with a smile on her face, loudly proclaimed it an Easter miracle. She’d then promptly bundled him up for the cold and took him to the nearest church. It was a tall, muddy red building with gray spires and three dark arched doors in the front. When he and his Ma had stepped inside, his mouth fell open--the church was enormous and he felt smaller in comparison.
“Only Jarvis, Momma, and Howard call me Anthony, Cap,” Anthony explains sleepily. “I like being called Tony.” Darkness begins to creep in around him, the edges of his sight going gray.
Obie stares at Tony, disappointment clear in his blue eyes and lips turned down in a frown. It’s too much like how Howard used to look at him that Tony glances away -
It’s just as he’s allowing himself to relax that a creeping feeling comes over Anthony. It’s like a spider slowly walking up the back of his neck. His skin gets prickly, breaking out into goosebumps all along his arms underneath his pajama sleeves. He clutches his hands together and glances down at his toes. He’s being watched.
“Yeah,” Tony says with a sniffle. He can feel Rhodey rubbing circles into his back. “Knowing my luck, mine would hate sex.”
Anthony shakes his head. “Howard won’t let me play with his toys,” he answers, forcing his hands down at his sides. “He says they’re not for me.”
He feels the guy flinch beside him, and the hand immediately yanks away from his shoulder like he touched something hot - which, Tony’s vain enough to admit, isn’t a
“Steve’s my best friend,” Anthony told him simply, “he’s the best person I know apart from Jarvis and Aunt Pegs.” As he said this, he held his Captain America action figure tightly.
“Someone's here to see you,” Ana says, drawing Anthony’s attention. Her whitening orange hair in its usual pinned up Victory curls, but there are more than a few fluffy tendrils dangling undone. She gives him a soft smile.
Steve just wants to be left alone. He wants nothing more than to crawl under the blankets of his bed, curl up into a ball, and stay there forever. Ever since he came back from the Alps, he hasn’t been able to sleep a wink. All he’s been able to do is stare at the ceiling in the barracks. It’s gotten to the point that he can actually see shapes and patterns in the rough-textured wall.
Truthfully, Tony would rather dunk his head in a vat of polluted water than have to face Rhodey, but he knows he’s only delaying the inevitable.
On long trips such as these, Steve likes to watch the countryside pass by as they drive down the long stretches of road. Steve’s sprawled in the back of the truck, trying to sleep, except after seeing the destruction of the church and its small town yesterday, sleep still isn’t easy. He itches for his sketchbook so he can draw everything good he’s witnessed: from the goofy expressions on Dum Dum’s face, to the sparse trees of the passing countryside, to Bucky’s slouching figure in sleep. Ever since it became one of his favorite pastimes, drawing’s served as a cathartic for Steve, as a way to banish the dark things he remembers by committing them down to paper. It’s once he’s put down the pencil after a long stretch of sketching, that he can really sleep.
Tony feels like he’s been electrocuted, he’s so startled. But at the same time the fact that the dream - no,
He’s reaching for the switches of the radio when her voice comes back in. She speaks and there are tears laced in her voice.
Steve turns the envelope over in his hand, and his breath catches in his throat at the return address marked
So he’d lied. It came out of his mouth easily, like a practiced bit of a soliloquy. And he has to snort at himself, because he should’ve known better. Ana always
“No ma’am,” he’d reply, making his eyes as wide as they could go so that she’d have pity on him and leave him be. (She often did too when he gave her that wide-eyed look.)
he is Markless. Steve, in his worst moments of self-pity, can’t help but be jealous of his fellow soldiers that have gray marks. Despite losing their soulmates, they had
he had as a kid matches up to his drugged up hallucination feels like he’s managed to get a spark plug slotted into place, but the entire engine’s still not working right for whatever reason. Is Captain America - Steve Rogers, because that’s not classified information anymore; hasn’t been since ‘82 - his soulmate? And if he is, why doesn’t Tony have a Mark?
He doesn’t hide anything from her as he looks at her head-on. He’s sure he looks like hell: eyes red and puffy, his demeanor withdrawn and introspective as he sits loose-limbed in his chair. He can’t find it in himself to care.
“I didn’t mope,” Steve defended, a self-conscious blush staining his cheeks. Eugene had been his first crush, of course he moped.
If he’s honest with himself - and Tony makes it a point of being brutally honest with himself - the mansion hasn’t felt like home since Howard and Aunt Pegs stopped talking to each other two years ago, which ended her visits to the place altogether. It hadn’t gotten better when Ana died last year. It hasn’t gotten better since Rhodey got deployed to where-the-fuck-ever, leaving Tony alone again for
“Sir, you have to stop talking now,” the doctor whispered, leaning over Johnson so the soldier could hear him, the warning clear in his voice.
Steve’s heart aches in his chest. After his and Bucky’s conversation, he had allowed himself to imagine a life with her. It would have been nice. Maybe not the stuff of epics, but nice regardless. He wonders idly if they would have made it.
Anthony’s mouth drops open, his breath catching in his throat, and his heart feels like it just dove off a diving board and did a cannonball into his stomach. His hands sweat as they clench to the shirt of his pajamas, and his toes curl tight, but he hardly cares: Captain America stands tall and big, and only a few feet away from him.
A whine spills out of Tony’s throat, and the man makes a noise that Tony’s too sleepy to decipher. He’s too tired to care what hot guy thinks of him, so he clumsily slumps back down onto the floor, eyes closed. Sounds drift in and out that he’s aware enough to hear, but he can’t make out what they are. Then his shoulders are shaken relentlessly before they’re let go.
of, all he can see is hues of gray and black. Above him the sky is gray with swirled smudges of black as dark as charcoal. Steve isn’t sure if the clouds are actually gray with threats of rain, or if it’s because of the fire that he and the Commandos hadn’t arrived in time to stop. The grass at his feet is burned away and covered in ash, turning it black and dull. Even the Commandos, in their camouflage clothes, match the bleak scenery in their faded and worn appearance.
For a while, neither of them said anything. It was five minutes before Bucky took a deep breath and spoke again.
Cap’s blue eyes widen incredulously and he blinks in surprise. “H-Howard?” he asks, his voice gravelly like he’s got a frog in his throat.
to him, praying over him when his illnesses took a turn for the worse, or sitting still at his bedside for hours as he tentatively drew them-- he’d wouldn’t even
The doctor nods, her cool pink brow crinkling. “And now?” she asks, expectant, like everything hangs on his next answer. Tony tips his head in confusion and she hastens to explain. “Your friend had to revive you, Mr. Stark - you weren’t responsive at
The operating room is huge, and bright, and completely white. He can’t really see anything; the lights are shining right in his eyes and it hurts to look. Even with his eyes closed, he can feel the brightness prick painfully into his eyes. He can make out a sliver of each doctor’s face in between the surgical masks and the hats they wear. Beside him, there are a bunch of shiny silver instruments that remind Anthony of Howard’s car tools.
As if on cue, another wave of nausea hits Tony, and he turns his head quickly into the toilet bowl and retches noisily. The guy - Rhodes - resumes silently rubbing circles into Tony’s back.
The ambulance people let Aunt Pegs ride with Anthony to the hospital, and Jarvis and Ana follow closely behind in one of Howard’s cars. Once they arrive it’s all a whirlwind of activity - he’s rushed in on the stretcher with Aunt Peggy running at his side.
“We’re arranging another housing situation for you, but it’s taking longer than we anticipated.” She hurriedly explained, trying to assuage any worries he had, which is pretty laughable, all things considered.
The conversation died out a long time ago, most of his team dropping off to sleep, and Steve doesn’t want to disturb them of their forty winks just for entertainment. He sits back and watches the blurring foliage on the trees, and the yellow fields bereft of cattle or sheep that they pass. The road is uneven, and the truck jitters with each rock it hits. The potholes are the worst; every once in awhile, the truck bounces hard as a tire falls in, making the men inside fly a few feet and jostle their supplies.
After consuming his soup, he’d been able to sleep peacefully that night. But after that night, he’d always beg for Granny McDonald or his Ma to tell him the story of Joanna again, and he’d rub his wrist, eager to see what shade his Mark would turn out to be.
“We’ll be right here, Tony,” Aunt Pegs says, warmth in her brown eyes as she walks on the right side of the bed, her heels clacking on the linoleum floor, with the Jarvises following on his left.
Most of the soldiers that he and the Commandos encounter on the battlefield are either Markless, like him, or have Marks on their wrists that have turned gray. Hell, the only reason Dr. Erskine's nomination for Project Rebirth was approved in the end was
That’s been his biggest issue. He hasn’t been able to sleep properly in days. The cot is lumpy, his pillow is a rock and the blankets itch on his skin. The flat he and Bucky had shared in central London was by no means Buckingham Palace, but it was certainly better than the shack they shared back in Brooklyn; it was practically an exotic getaway compared to the tiny place they had before they even entered the war.
Tony frowns, the words floating around in his brain. He’s distantly aware of the Good Samaritan’s hand still on his shoulder. “If yer lookin’ for a BJ or som’thing, you’ll have to wait,” Tony tells him flatly as he wipes his mouth on his shirtsleeve.
These days he doesn’t mind, and it wouldn’t offend anyone here even if he did go out without a band on.
Time is a strange thing when a person’s grieving; it just doesn’t pass the same way like it did--before. Everything seems to slow down, and pass a person by all at once that it’s been easy for him to lose track of how many hours he’s lain awake at night until the sun’s coming up, or he hears the bells signalling everyone to get up and start another day. Steve’s been feeling like he’s standing away from life, feeling so disconnected with the rest of the world that it’s as though he’s watching a newsreel about a foreign country; he can hardly care.
She lays a hand over his, making a lukewarm feeling spike through his Mark. “You won’t be alone,” she says with conviction.
Steve gives the radio a curt nod. But as he pushes with all his strength against the controller, holding it as tightly as he can, he thinks again about his soulmate. He honest to God
have a Mark, but what Peggy did for him was to help him realize that it shouldn’t matter if a person had a Mark or not in order to love someone else. They just had to be themselves and hope for the best, but remember their own value and worth first. That encounter had cemented Bucky’s belief that Markless people can find happiness in each other, and when Steve told him this, Bucky only smirked and patted him on the back.
“Howard,” Anthony starts, looking up at his father, lifting his chin up defiantly. Howard stares down at him in amusement, with a raised, expecting eyebrow. “You know that Captain America toy that throws its own shield?”
to be an expert, Howard!” Aunt Peggy exclaims, her eyes flashing dangerously, her arms uncrossing and her hands curled into rigid fists at her sides. “I admit, it’s hard to raise children on your own, especially with an organization to run on top of it! I try, and I make mistakes, but at least I
The man is so tall, he’s an inch or two taller than the hutch, and Anthony has to raise his chin just to see his face. He’s dressed in a dark blue uniform with a bright white star in the center of his chest, and vertical stripes of red and white on his tummy. He has a matching blue helmet on his head with a white ‘A’ in the middle of his forehead, and wings of the same white painted on the sides.
After the lights went out, and everyone was laying in their beds, it was quiet for a long time as Steve tried to find peace. He had finally managed to shut his eyes, and he had evened out his breathing to sleep. Then he heard Bucky’s scream and images of the train, the cold, flashed through his mind, and the smell of burnt skin filled his nose, making Steve sit up in bed, breathing heavily and back slick with sweat. His fists had clenched the sheets and he squeezed his eyes shut, trying to banish the images from his mind.
When Steve was eleven, he began to have funny thoughts about men. It wasn’t until he hit puberty that he first laid eyes on a bluesy. One of his pals, Joey, had shown him and the other neighborhood boys a book he’d taken from his older brother. It had pictures of girls doing improper things to guys, and while the eyes of the other boys were riveted on the buxom blonds, redheads, and brunettes drawn on the pages, Steve’s eyes were glued to the robust men.
For Steve, it’s not about having a Perfect Person Meant For Him to spend his life with, but a partner. Someone who will always be in his corner; have his back and support him through thick and thin. Someone who won’t flounder at the sight of him because he’s Captain America, nor flinch at being around danger all the time--because Steve’s life
Peggy paused, took a deep breath and closed her eyes. “I get lonely just like anyone else, yes,” she said softly. When she opened her eyes, that flame of ferocity glowed bright. “But people who share Marks don’t always equate happiness, Steve. I can’t rely on a dot to be my fairy godmother who will magically appear and solve all my problems with a wave of her wand; life doesn’t work that way.”
He gets out of bed quickly, throwing the covers aside before landing on the hardwood of the floor, and quietly opens the door to his room. He wanders down the dark corridor, and goes towards the bathroom where he does his business.
Steve sees a lot of men like Johnson out on the front: men in the service who either have gray Marks, or shared a Mark, or found their soulmate in their brother-in-arms like Horowitz and Edwards, or like Steve’s fellow Commandos: Gabe Jones and Jacques Dernier.
Though he’s confused, Anthony gives a slight nod, gripping the toy tightly against his chest. “Okay,” he agrees.
He can't cry. And that hurts. Or it would hurt, if Steve is able to feel anything. There’s nothing except a numbness throughout his body that’s left him feeling bland and flat. If he could cry, that would mean being able to feel again. He feels this loss acutely in his chest, and it’s nothing like he’s ever experienced before. When his Ma died of TB, and Granny McDonald died of influenza, he’d cried so hard for them both that he would launch into a coughing fit. He hadn’t been able to
“I’ll be right back, darling,” she assures, kissing his forehead quickly before she follows the doctor out.
He stares down at his Markless wrist, imagining the myriad of technicolor that could appear on his skin at literally any given moment, and wondering which one he would prefer to have to look at for the rest of his days. But looking down at his wrist and trying to decide which color he’d want is like trying to imagine what the actual color of those stained glass windows were back when he was colorblind--he knows it's something he can't comprehend. Even though he’s attracted to men, and is more than aware of the looks he gets in his new body from
“I had to go to the bathroom. I didn’t want to wake anyone up, besides I didn’t need help to go,” Anthony explains quietly, as Jarvis helps him into his huge bed.
Growing up in the tenements, he was surrounded by people, and the only thing they had in common was their heritage and the hope to build a better life in America. Aside from his Ma, he’d gotten all his education on their religion from the oldest member of the McDonald family that lived with them: Grandma Elizabeth. She’d been a feisty bitty lady with gray hair who sometimes spoke Gaelic and treated him no different from her own grandchildren. Steve’s mouth still waters at the memory of her delectable kerry cake. She had fed Steve’s love of good storytelling by reading passages of the Bible and telling him stories of each saint when he was stuck in bed.
She takes a deep breath, and Steve waits. The beat of silence stretches, and Steve wonders if the connection was lost.
“I swear I’m not going to do anything to you,” his companion assures. “I just don’t feel right leaving a kid alone to puke in the bathroom. Especially a bathroom at an
There’s one man in particular that sticks out in Steve’s memory, from one of his earliest battles on the front; the memory often surfaces in Steve’s mind when he tries to find respite. Lieutenant Johnson had a gray Mark on his wrist, and his heart had stopped before the doctors had managed to bring him back to life on the operating table.
It takes so much effort for Steve to hold back his tears. He folds the letter carefully, and places it into a pocket on the hip of his Captain America uniform, straightens his back and walks out of the War Room, after the Commandos.
, and so much has changed. Whenever I tried to work on this chapter, nothing felt right and I'd be forced to put it back down again. It's only with hindsight I know that the stars were not in position. Finally this chapter's done and I can move on to the next portion of this story!
say something,” the man pleads, in a startlingly low tone of voice. His thick eyebrows pinch together in concern and genuine worry as clear as day shines in his eyes.
“You just tell your dad that Steve says you can play with the toy. If he argues, just tell him…” The small smile on Cap’s face grows bigger, and he breathes out a laugh. “Tell him I said not to fondue around - he’ll understand.”
He marvels at the gifts and the larger, more colorful balloons before his eyes settle on Aunt Peggy. She’s sitting at the foot of his bed, frowning down at a magazine in her hand; Ana and Jarvis occupy the two chairs on his left, both slumped in sleep.
“That bleeding soulmate story is true,” Johnson whispered quietly as his face was smoothed of the wrinkles of discontent he’d had before.
Horowitz’s shoulders are shaking, with his arm covering his face; trying to stop the flood of tears. Edwards silently moves closer to him, and Steve sees the inquiry on Edwards’ lips. Horowitz cries so hard that he’s hiccupping and can’t give much of an answer. Edwards can’t do anything but rub Horowitz’s back comfortingly, murmuring words to him that Steve resolutely isn’t going to hear.
Tony frowns, his head pounding painfully in time with the muffled bass outside the cramped tiled bathroom. He waves a hand at the guy. “Y’don have to stay. Jus’ leave your name an’ number at the door an’ I’ll get back to you.”
“It’s just,” Bucky heaved a sigh, as though it was difficult trying to get the words out and they weren’t cooperating. He ran a hand through his dark hair. “It’s gotta be lonely being Markless and queer,” he said at last. There was so much seriousness in his blue eyes as he evaluated Steve, that Steve couldn’t help but be mesmerized. “You deserve to be happy, Stevie, more than anyone else I know. And with Peggy, if there’s even a
“I need you to contact Winifred Barnes--Bucky’s mother,” Steve clarifies. “Please tell her I said thanks for the letter--”
Almost immediately after he hangs up on Obie, Tony organizes a party that takes up the entire week leading up to his parents’ funeral.
“Not afraid I’m suddenly gonna try and turn you for the other side?” Steve said, trying to tease, but worried about what the answer might be nonetheless.
Once he’s dressed, Anthony stumbles down the corridor of the mansion until he makes his way into the foyer. He places a hand on the rough floral wallpaper for balance, his other hand pressing against his side. He keeps his eyes to the floor, watching where he steps in case he trips on the rug or stumbles.
“I see,” Jarvis says with a hint of a smile as he tucks the blankets around Anthony’s body while he settles against the huge and comfy pillows.
It took Peggy Carter punching Hodges in the face on the first day of basic training for Steve to finally begin to understand what Bucky meant. Steve had been impressed by everything she did during Basic. Even while being stationed in London after he quit his bond-selling days, as Steve got to know her better, he had more and more cause to admire Agent Carter. He’s continually inspired by her displays of ferocity, the dangerous glint in her eye whenever anyone gives her shit sends shivers running down his spine. His knees get weak at her sharp mouth and her shrewd mind. On the whole, Peggy Carter makes him feel awed and terrified of her all at once.
It isn’t until he reaches the small steps leading into the foyer that he takes his eyes off the floor, glancing up at the sound of the heavy door to the house shutting. Jarvis has just stepped through, his light brown suit neat and tidy as he talks happily to a woman beside him in the grand entrance. She stands tall, with a grace that comes from knowing
“Steve,” Peggy said gently, her brown eyes warm with empathy. “Your and Sergeant Barnes’s flat was amongst the buildings that had been bombed last night.”
Bucky’s blue eyes had been the last thing Steve saw as he watched, helpless, as his friend fell into the ice below.
Anthony steps over to the display case until he’s standing right in front of it, careful not to press against the clean glass. He knows where to look, up and up and up until he spots a familiar toy. The toy puts a smile on his face when nothing else in the room could, and makes his insides warm with a surge of happiness. It’s Captain America standing with a set to his jaw, and his eyes staring off in the distance, looking ready for a fight. Both of his arms are pointed inwards, with his shield strapped to his left one. On his back is a button that makes the magnet connecting the shield to his arm disconnect and twists Cap’s waist at the same time, momentum of the movement allowing the toy to throw the shield.
There is pain in her voice, and Steve wishes more than anything he could be by her side and comfort her. But he has a job to do.
Me: I need to follow these movies as closely as I can!!1! But how do I include all these movies I missed???! Aaldjflsdjafldhfdlajdfsls
Steve frowned down at his own blank, bandless wrist. “Does everyone have a Mark?” he asked, rubbing his empty wrist self-consciously.
He’s just heading back to his room when he hears voices. He scrunches his eyebrows together in confusion, recognizing them as Howard and Aunt Peggy. He turns his head towards the sound - it’s coming from Howard’s study. Fear fills Anthony at the anger in their tones - until he hears his name mentioned. Despite the fear, there is an undeniable curiosity underneath to find out
A funny tingling wriggles around in the back of Anthony’s brain, like it's trying to remember something. But he still feels a little foggy, and he can’t do much else but stare at the man in front of him while his brain tries to figure it out.
“You’re being very brave, angel,” Ana assures him, the corners of her mouth turned up in a small smile.
He blinks and squints his eyes hard. He scans everything in the mansion’s kitchen, trying to get the spot to go away and leave him and his Captain America action figure alone.
everyone to know what a good person Steve is, and that he’s glad that he knows Captain America - he’s
He can’t be still as Ana helps him dress in clothes that Jarvis had gotten from the mansion - he’s just so excited to leave! When he’s all ready, he takes Aunt Peggy and Momma’s hands in his own and they walk him out of the hospital. Howard, Jarvis, and Ana trail behind them. Anthony has a big smile on his face as he walks with his Momma and Aunt in tow out into the nearly deserted parking lot. They look on in tired amusement, shoulders slumping forward slightly and eyelids half open.
But he knows how rare those are, and despite him and Rhodey being friends for three years now, people have used Tony for longer periods of time and for a lot less, and he doesn’t want to ruin this precious friendship thing they have. Besides, even
Tony sniffs as he pushes himself off the door, wiping his nose with the sleeve of his black jacket before shrugging it off and letting it drop onto the floor. He decides what he
He blinks a few times, but the spot stays on Jarvis’s wrist. Anthony pinches his eyebrows together and squints at it - it’s green, but not as dark as the spot he was seeing before.
Steve’s heart clenches painfully at the thought. His own religious upbringing had been unorthodox, but he had always felt an appreciation in the passion others had for their religion. The hatred behind the destruction made Steve’s blood boil and clench his teeth in anger. He didn’t care what they practiced: nobody’s sole form of comfort in a time of war deserved to be destroyed right in front of their very eyes.
sacrifice myself just so that you could die at twenty-one over something so stupid!” the man’s voice snarls. But then his voice warps, changing in pitch, becoming higher.
“Which means, um. I can’t get drunk.” The silence rings out around them for a moment. “Did you know that?” he asks, turning his head to glance at her.
“I’ll be right outside,” Rhodey tells him and Tony nods in acknowledgement. Then Rhodey shuts the door behind him, finally leaving Tony and the doctor alone. Somehow, the absence of his best friend and his uncle make it easier to breathe.
Leaning against the oak door, Tony’s head thunks against the hard surface before he lifts the heavy lids of his eyes. Forehead wrinkling in confusion, he blinks at the sight of his father’s furniture and desk pushed against the far wall opposite the door. This is
He lifts his head and stares blankly at her; what a question to ask. But Peggy’s tone had changed. It isn’t patient or gentle anymore, but it’s like steel. It sounds more like her: determined and resilient.
Beside him, the heart monitor’s beeping slowly speeds up. Tony squeezes his eyes shut, throat clicking as he forces himself to take a deep breath. Or as deep a breath as he can, with an oxygen tube in his nose and the pain in his ribs; he hurts so much, he feels like one giant bruise.
, Steve realized--with some sadness on her face. Granny McDonald gave her hand a comforting squeeze before letting go of both of them.
Anthony nods in understanding. Then a sharper pain hits him, and he shuts his eyes again, his hand squeezing hers. “Okay,” he allows weakly once the pain has passed. “Once they take it out,
Steve sits there quietly, allowing fragments of memories to filter through his mind, like he’s turning pages in a photo album, turning them this way and that to be examined. Not feeling one way or another about them.
Jarvis chuckles, but doesn’t pull away. Instead he leans forward, his head bowed like they’re sharing a secret. “Because the veins in your left arm lead up to your heart, it’s theorized that your soulmate will also be the one to have your heart.”
“Shh, Tony,” Aunt Peggy hushs soothingly as she strokes a hand along his cheek, her calloused fingers warm against his skin. “I’m going to stay a few more days, and we will do whatever you want.” Anthony smiles in relief. “But it’s
left of the people who had lived there; nothing about their lives, or their struggles, or even who they had been. It’s all gone. It’s strange to even think that there had even
“But God, I could smell him again,” Johnson whispered, a watery smile on his face and his eyes still closed, imagining his soulmate in front of him. “It was like he rolled around in freshly cut grass; the smell just clung to him. His kisses always tasted like lemonade--”
Steve was confused at the conversation starter, but he couldn’t help but feel bad for the Londoners. “I’m sorry to hear that,” he said with sincerity. “Were there any casualties?”
Cap chuckles at him, his smile ticking up in one corner of his mouth, and Anthony gives him a soft smile in return. He feels as big as an air balloon -
He shut his mouth with a snap. “But,” he tried, “you’re a gorgeous dame.” She raised an eyebrow at him. “I, I mean woman,” he stammered. “I just. I don’t understand.”
The sunset is beautiful over the Atlantic, and Steve can’t help but take a moment to admire the swirls of orange and pink that streak across the sky. Even the icy wind blowing into the
“Unlike other children his age, Anthony has given his hero a name. He seems quite fond of using ‘Steve’ as a substitute, and to be quite honest, I’m having trouble understanding where that manifests from. Are there personal ties to that particular name?”
One doctor with big eyes and a freckle by their left eyebrow puts a mask over Anthony’s nose and mouth, telling him to count down from ten. Before he even reaches five, he’s fast asleep.
Steve laughed outright. “I think they’d have been more impressed by her character,” he said. They would have definitely bemoaned the fact that the fierce tenacity in Peggy was displayed in an English rather than an Irish girl, but there wasn’t a doubt in Steve’s mind that the two most important women in Steve’s world would have liked Peggy Carter regardless of her country of origin. “She’d have set ‘em straight.”
He’s never seen The Stork Club in the light of day before, but under the circumstances he’s understanding that it isn’t up to its usual par. It’s dusty and grimy and black, the insides of the building spilling out onto the cobbled street, looking mangled and dejected in the light. He can still smell the smoke from the bomb that had landed a week ago. Outside, the sky of London is a dreary gray smudged with black; it always seems to get that way after a bombing, no matter what part of Europe he’s in.
“It’s not forever, my love,” she assures, her hand squeezing his, the bracelets on her wrist clacking together. “One day, everyone will know how special he was. But until then, we have to keep protecting people, like Steve wanted. Now, can you keep that a secret?”
Steve can almost hear the heavy challenging sigh she would take, which had always been a clear indication that he was about to receive the lecture of a lifetime. He holds his breath in anticipation.
“What about the plane?” He can barely make out her British accent; it sounds so tinny on the speakers of the radio.
“So what’s the problem, Steve?” Bucky asked, impatience tainted his tone. “She likes you, you like her. Why’s it so wrong for you two being Markless and being together?”
Steve had shaken his head at his ludicrous friend; he’d never understand Bucky. Why would you want to be with anyone else when God had Marked someone meant just for you?
Before he can say anything, Rhodey’s on his left, smooth hands brushing along his sides, making Tony jump. Rhodey delicately wraps his arms around Tony’s waist, careful not to jostle the IV drip in Tony’s right arm and all the important wires connected to him. His friend gently pulls Tony into him, so so slowly that Tony can pull away at any time. He doesn’t; he’s stock-still, with his breath caught in his throat and eyes wide in surprise.
In fairness to himself, she doesn’t look anything like how he remembers her: cheerful and vibrant, larger than life. Instead, she’s grief-stricken. At the funeral her bright eyes were dim with sadness, her lips nude without her vermillion lipstick and the years of laugh lines apparent in the corners of her eyes and lips. She’s gotten smaller since he last saw her at Christmas; her face is pale and careworn, and her once-bright auburn hair has turned almost completely white, only a few strands of the original color peeking through.
A smile that’s better than the last one appears on Cap’s face and it just makes Anthony’s heart dance harder. “Well, then they
It’s so warm and toasty, like slipping into a bath that’s the perfect temperature; he can feel the air dancing along his skin and he just feels so
There were no objections. Everyone went their separate ways, each of the Commandos looking weary and ragged, like they could fall dead asleep where they stood. Before they left, each of them came over to Steve and paid their respects. They either gave him a squeeze on the shoulder, or a pat on his back, accompanied with a sad smile, but never said a word. They didn’t have to. He’s grateful to them for it.
“Are you hurt?” The doctor asked. His voice was calm, but his body belied it: his eyes were wide and frantic with worry, and his hands hovered over his patient, unsure.
the shield when you press a button on his back! But Anthony still loves this one because it’s A Special Gift that his Aunt Pegs gave him a week early for his fifth birthday. So it’s
There's not much room for a sketchbook in his pockets, though, and there's even less he can do to divert himself from his demons while they’re on the road.
Tony averts his eyes from his friend’s face, afraid of what he might find there. He blinks rapidly, trying to staunch the flood of tears that are threatening to spill. Silence reigns heavily over them as neither move an inch.
laugh! They take a couple of steps together, when suddenly the excitement that had filled Anthony is zapped from him, leaving him feeling exhausted. He yawns big and loud, and covers his wide mouth with a hand.
He laughs. “S’okay,” he assures, patting Tony on the shoulder. “I’m not in a hurry to get back out there.”
Steve sighs heavily and gives up trying to nap. He opens his eyes and watches the scenery. After a few minutes, his eyes stray from the passing countryside and flick towards Jones and Dernier, who sit huddling together in the back of the truck. They’re speaking to each other quietly in French, Jones’s dark fingers tracing over Dernier’s maroon Mark. Dernier smiles contentedly at the contact and Steve has to look away. He’s not a prude, but it doesn’t make him feel any less embarrassed at catching them in such a private moment. It probably doesn’t help that he covets stolen moments between soulmates, and out here on the front collects them like a kid with marbles.
Anthony’s not worried, though: he knows that his brain is a little tired, but once he wakes up, it’ll be in proper working order. In the meantime, he wriggles his toes experimentally, pleased that
as gorgeous and self-assured as you would already have a Mark,” he explained, self-consciously rubbing his blank skin.
“You think you’re all done puking now?” asks his toilet-mate, with the barest hint of concern in his tone.
His parents are quiet. “Yes,” Howard finally says. “His godmother and I had a friend named Steve that died in ‘45. She talks about him a lot, especially to Anthony.”
has to finish. He’s never resented being Captain America; not really anyway. Throughout the USO show, he’d...grudgingly tolerated his “title”. He felt silly doing the song and dance number, and everyone slinging the name around as though it meant something; Peggy got it right when she’d asked if being a trained monkey was his only other option to being studied in a lab. It wasn’t until he rescued Bucky and the rest of 107th that he realized that he could use the name. He could turn Captain America into something he could be proud of; a tool to be used to stand for something.
He turns his head and studies the room around him. It looks a lot different now that there are giant balloons and flowers filling up the small space and blocking the ugly paintings on the walls -
attention he would’ve noticed it was a trap, if he’d brought someone else with him instead of Bucky--
Tears stream down Tony’s face and it’s the longest they’ve ever hugged in their friendship, even longer than the one he gave Rhodey when he was dropping him off at the airport, hoping it wouldn’t be the last time they’d see each other.
Momma have told Anthony that he is not to get out of bed without someone to help him. Despite it being the middle of the night, Anthony has to go to the bathroom and he doesn’t want to wake anyone up. Besides, he’s
The plane ride back to the SSR London branch was hell on everyone. It was long and turbulent, and Steve and the rest of the Commandos had been packed together as tight as sardines in a can, surrounding him on all sides. Even though his team had succeeded in apprehending Zola, the obvious loss to their party brought the mood down on an otherwise successful mission. No one spoke, everyone was withdrawn and introspective, Steve most of all.
Before Anthony can respond, the doctors reach the doors where his guardians can’t follow, and he’s reminded of the urgency of his situation; that he has a bomb in his body that’s ready to explode. He watches as the three most important people in his life disappear behind the metal of a door that slowly swings shut after the foot of the bed has passed through.
Anthony blinks out of his stupor and finally meets Jarvis’s eyes. He’s staring down at him, relaxed and waiting with a small smile.
to get away; he couldn't bare to spend the week like he'd planned stuck at the mansion with his family, especially not with the tension between his Aunt Peggy and Good Ol’ Dad so thick in the air Tony could choke on it.
He curls up into a ball, facing the door of the hospital room as he waits. He scrunches his eyes shut tight, trying to block out the awful pain in his tummy. It feels like it has quadrupled during the examination. He focuses on taking even breaths: in through his nose, and out through his mouth. When he hears the familiar
“Don’t worry, doc,” Obie assures, giving her one of his patented Obadiah Stane Smiles™️ that doesn’t reach his eyes and is fake as hell. He glances over at Tony, his eyes promising a lecture on accountability that Tony’s probably going to zone out of almost as soon as it begins. “I’ve got to do damage control anyway. Rest easy, kiddo.”
Steve’s head whipped around so fast, his neck should have snapped. Bucky’s smirk and shining blue eyes met his confused expression. “Y-you do?” Steve asked instead, and Bucky nodded. “How--” he had taken a huge gulp of air while speaking, and nearly choked on his words. He paused to clear his throat, then tried again. “How did you know?”
like a secret,” says his mother, turning back to look at him with a smile that she always has when Anthony says something right.
Steve wasn’t naive: he knew how queers were looked down upon, and treated, especially in his neck of the woods. But no matter how hard he tried in the beginning to banish the images of men from his head, and think about girls in the same context that he thinks of men, it was
“But don’t you get lonely?” Steve asked. “Doesn’t that appeal to you? A person made just for you? Who would
“I know that - don’t be stupid, honeybear,” Tony says, the endearment just slipping out. “It’s just not easy for me.”
The letters are another issue.  Despite the mission that took Bucky’s life being highly classified and need-to-know, it didn’t stop people from talking about him and the mission itself after Zola was captured. The first one came a day after Steve bunked in the Barracks, and they haven’t stopped. They arrive in droves; sometimes in Mail Call, Steve is the only one who gets anything. He got some thoughtful, simple condolences written by his fellow soldiers who had heard the news, a few that were longer, almost like reports from SSR agents, and even a very thoughtful letter from
Anthony stares back down at the Mark. It’s like a glob of paint, but doesn’t have any cracks or peels where normally paint would start to wear away; it doesn’t even show skin through it! It’s like a giant mole on Jarvis’s skin that happens to be warm green, with flecks of blue and a swirl of yellow added in. Anthony furrows his eyebrows as he stares down at the color in concentration; he's seen it before, but he can’t remember where…
Once they made it back to London, and Steve had seen to it personally that Zola was in the hands of the SSR, he decided the team needed a break. He called a meeting and simply sent them all on leave to get their heads on straight.
But despite all this, sometimes late at night and in his darkest moments, Steve isn’t sure his soulmate will ever come. He’s one part terrified that he’ll be ninety before any swatch of color appears on his wrist, or worse that a swatch of bright color will appear, but in a matter of seconds will fade to gray without him ever knowing their name; because he’s heard stories of that happening where a soulmate will die at childbirth. He isn’t sure which prospect is worst; both seem equally terrifying. So when he’s alone in his tent at night, he’ll take off his band, lie in bed, close his eyes and run his fingers over his wrist, and all the while pretend it’s someone else who’s stroking his wrist. Then in the morning he’ll put his band on, push all the doubts and fears he has for his soulmate to the back of his mind, and be Captain America for another day.
At night it was hard to experiment with his body while living in a crowded house, but whenever he had a moment to himself, Steve closed his eyes and tried to conjure bright red lips and curves that went on for days. But the red lipstick would smear away and become mustaches, and the curves would harden, and the outline of cocks would appear in trousers. Instead of painted nails attached to delicate and soft hands, images of calloused fingers and hands bigger than his own pushed their way into his head of their own accord.
Guiltily, he had gently touched the golden band around her wrist, and briefly wondered what it was like to watch a bright Mark turn gray.
Steve turns back to the shattered glass on the dusty ground, the memory of the Virgin Mary’s peaceful expression swimming through his mind at the sight. Instead of blue or green or red, the glass shards that stare up at him are all a dull and dirty gray from the dust and ash in the air.
“Once upon a time,” Sarah began, and Steve tried stifling the cough building up in the back of his throat so he could listen. But his Ma was patient by nature and waited for him to get his breath back.
“Oh, Tony,” Jarvis whispers with so much sadness in his voice that it leaves Anthony very confused. Jarvis wraps his arms around him, holding Anthony tightly against his chest.
It didn’t take him long to reach the barracks, and it was still empty considering the time of day. One of the officers had been down there at the time of Steve’s arrival--probably had been told what to expect if his gushing was any indication--and had pointed Steve to a cot that no one was using at the far end of the room. He nodded his thanks and claimed it for his own.
The Captain America toy that Steve made him promise to take care of is standing proud on the wood, with a red ribbon tied around his waist in a fancy bow. Anthony can’t help but grin at the sight of it as he wriggles down into his blankets and closes his eyes.
The guy frowns, his full lips pulled downwards into a pout and furrows appearing in his forehead. “Fuck you man, Michael never goes out of style,” he says, big eyes that are like rich soil after a rainstorm evaluating Tony.
For a while, they don't say anything. His best friend stands at the foot of the bed, his big eyes staring at Tony like he’s trying to solve the mysteries of the universe and if Tony could just cooperate, he’d get to the answer faster. But Rhodey knows him - has known him since Tony was sixteen and trying to be the big man on campus - and he knows that he only has to wait the two point five minutes it takes before Tony reaches that point where he
He’s only been in this room one other time, and that was only because Howard had wanted to show Anthony pictures of him and Captain America standing side-by-side, proud to see his son taking an interest in his old war buddy. It hadn’t been until Anthony had played with the toy that throws its shield that Howard had shouted and yelled and forbidden him from coming into the room ever again. Weeks later he had relented, saying Anthony could go into the room anytime he wanted, but Howard made it perfectly clear that he was never ever
So now Anthony sits and waits. He doesn’t really understand why he’s here at all. Last night he had been on another mission with Steve, looking for a jewel that could turn back time, and it had gone successfully. He had gone to bed last night and was in the middle of sleeping when Howard’s shouting woke him up. He doesn’t understand
me, Tones,” Rhodey says with exasperation. “I’m your friend - I care about what happens to you, idiot.”
Rhodey just gives a nonchalant shrug that makes something inside Tony settle. “Alright,” he says simply before going back to his textbook.
His right hand travelled to his left side, towards his left wrist where it wrapped around his gray Mark possessively.
After his parents are buried in the cold ground, there's an endless stream of parties. It’s all a blur of alcohol, dancing, and a parade of hot women and men, some with Marks, some without, that enter his bedroom. The next morning either he kicks them out, or they leave only to go to the tabloids - not that he cares, he doesn’t have it in him to care. There are bottles of alcohol littered around the house that servants whose names he doesn’t bother to remember clean up the next day.
Granny McDonald gave him a warm, reassuring smile. <A stór,> she said his nickname in Gaelic affectionately, “that just means your soulmate hasn’t been born yet. She’ll probably be much younger than you if a Mark hasn’t come by now.” She gave Sarah a smirk that he couldn’t grasp the meaning of.
She’s dressed in a brown coat, looking elegant and colorful in comparison to the black grittiness around them. Just as the English are known for their stiff upper lip, Peggy’s standing straight and tall: red lipstick applied, balanced in her heels, and dark hair perfectly coiffed. The only thing to belie her strong demeanor is the sadness in her brown eyes she allows him to see.
Anthony blinks. He owns Captain America comics, a few toys and even has posters, not to mention different pairs of pajamas with his hero printed on them. He’s drawn countless pictures of himself and Cap battling Hydra Nazi bastards and fighting bad guys. But he’s never noticed how
Granny McDonald gave him a warm, reassuring smile. “That just means your soulmate hasn’t been born yet."
Momma turns all the way around in her seat until she’s facing Anthony. Her lilypad green eyes are serious, dark blond eyebrows going upwards, and pink lipstick perfectly drawn on her lips. One of her golden earrings catches in the light and it momentarily shines in Anthony’s eyes, making him squint up at her.
The background is a dark, muddy brown color that reminds Anthony of the few rainy days he’s seen in Malibu. The flowers are big and a dark yellow, greenish color with thick curly branches, and sharp-looking thorns. There’s a seam right in front of Anthony’s face where the pattern doesn’t match up at all: it looks like one of the flowers is split in half, the one on the left much lower than the half on the right.
Howard had even started shouting at Momma, but this morning his mother had come into his room and told him they were all going for a drive. They drove him to an old building and that’s when he met the doctor. Anthony had tried to explain he was feeling fine, but nobody would listen and he still doesn’t get why he’s here.
“My aunt and uncle think so!” Anthony exclaims, excitement vibrating inside him. “Jarvis says I am too!”
of his aunt’s shoes, his eyes snap open to see her standing in the doorway, her red lips pulled down into a small frown.
Anthony blinks away, scrunching his eyebrows together. In all the comics he’s ever read, Cap never told anyone who he was; even the
And so Anthony explained about his last birthday, how he met Steve and how Steve had made him promise to take care of the toy that he’d been given.
The doctor nods again, and jots that down. “Okay,” she sighs, sounding satisfied for the first time since they started as she closes her clipboard and lowers it to her side. Her dark eyes flick up to meet his, and with the seriousness of an undertaker says, “Normally this goes without saying, Mr. Stark, but I think for you it bears spelling out: do
“Mr. Stark?” the doctor asks, and Tony looks up from his musings. She’s got an eyebrow raised, watching him expectantly. “Did you remember something?”
Homes are a pile of bricks on the ground, storefronts are blasted out onto the street, the cobbled road is littered with giant holes. Steve takes a deep steadying breath, feeling disoriented. It’s like being back out on the front again: the familiar sight of burnt buildings and smelling the charred remnants of brick and plaster in his nose that he had become accustomed to. But experiencing it in London? It’s almost like two memories overlapping each other, creating an alternate reality.
Steve adjusts his glove, brushing the place where his Mark should be as he does. It seems Steve is going to Hell no matter what kind of life he leads.
There are soldiers all around him, which Steve is already used to and doesn’t have a problem with normally. They’re all nice men, but that’s part of the problem. They tiptoe around him, and treat him like he’s made of glass. No soldier’s ever treated him like something that could shatter; not even when he was ninety pounds soaking wet and had a list of health issues as long as his skinny arm while doing his stint in Basic. Under normal circumstances, Steve would have been furious, but nowadays he can’t find the energy to care. Sure, they leave him alone when they see him coming, but Steve knows by now when he’s interrupted a conversation about himself. His superiors are all respectful, but whenever he sees them, they practically tsk at him in sympathy. At least in their flat, Bucky had known when to leave Steve alone to sulk and when to kick him in the head to get him up.
he wants to say, but instead replies, “It was warm. Like getting into a bath that’s the right temperature - comfortable.”
He only managed to get into art school after she had died, and he’s sure she’d have been pleased about his going, despite the short stint that it was. “The first Rogers to go to college,” she would have said, her face beaming with pride. She’d known he wanted to follow in his father’s footsteps by becoming a soldier in the 107th, and it wasn’t a secret that she disapproved of his choice in career. Regardless, she encouraged him to fight for himself and told him to always stand up no matter how many times he was pushed down.
Scattered memories of the two of them: holding hands, Jarvis giving Ana flowers, kisses exchanged and wrists touched briefly flick through his head before they’re gone just as quick, and Tony feels numb.
“What’s the point in soulmates anyway?” Tony asks with a scoff, staring down at his stupidly empty wrist. “Why do we put so much into something that’s just gonna cause us pain? My parents were a Match, did I ever tell you that? They were a Match and their marriage wasn’t exactly the love story for the ages. It wasn’t like the end all, be all, Match - that honor went to Ana and Jarvis.”
once Tony got here because Howard immediately announced that he and Mom had to leave for business, and then their car wrapped around a tree, and -
Anthony drags his eyes away from his favorite toy, his own reflection catching his eye. He’s dressed different. Frowning, Anthony glances down at himself, and the smile on his face grows bigger until he’s grinning: he’s wearing his favorite pair of Captain America pajamas. All over the PJ’s are mini Caps running with an angry face that lets the bad guys
His eyes flick to the picture in his compass. Black ones stare back at him, and he laments that the grainy newspaper-printed photograph doesn’t do those beautiful honey brown pools any justice.
Steve frowned down at his own blank, bandless wrist. “Does everyone have a Mark?” he asked, rubbing his empty wrist self-consciously.
At seven, the same age he’d been when he discovered his church, Steve’s mother had told him about soulmarks and soulmates. It had been one of those times he had a nasty bout of pneumonia and he was so cold. That was when his Ma had first told him what ended up becoming his favorite story from the Bible.
He pauses, wondering quickly what he can say. “That’s a little tougher to explain,” is what he settles with. Suddenly Steve remembers the letter at his hip. “I need you to do me a favor, Peggy,” he says urgently.
Huffing in grim amusement, Steve picks the table up off the ground and centers it a few feet in front of the bar and the exploded once-upright piano. He searches again through the wreckage, digging through ash and brick, raising dust into the air that would have once made him choke and cough, but now it just makes Steve grit his teeth against the taste in his mouth. He doesn’t stop until he finds a perfectly preserved chair. It receives the same treatment as the table; Steve cleans it off as best he can until he’s satisfied. Then he drags it over to the table and sets the small glass and the liquor bottle he found atop the surface of the table before he sits down.
Anthony avoids the creaky floorboards under the rug as quietly as he can, and tiptoes closer to the heavy door to Howard’s study. He leans his head against one of the wood panels and listens.
He looks up from his pants and sees a very large man standing next to the hutch, holding one of the black-and-white pictures in his hand. Anthony blinks, surprised that he hadn’t even heard the door open, or the man’s big boots squeak on the polished floor. His brow furrows in confusion. He
This will be it, he thinks. He’ll be able to drink again, just like he used to with Bucky. He’ll be able to down this glass and feel drunk and stumble his way home. Bucky will catch sight of him at the door and shake his head at him, laughing; radiating warmth and delight--
When the doctors inform them that Anthony can go home, it’s very dark outside and he’s sure that it’s way past his bedtime.
“What’s your name, son?” the hero asks, his right arm draped over his knee and eyes meeting Anthony’s.
Anthony’s heart feels like it’s stopped in his chest. His mouth drops open in complete surprise, breathless at the thought of going on an adventure with Cap. Quickly, before his hero gets the wrong idea, he nods eagerly and practically lunges to take Cap’s hand; his big fingers gently close around Anthony’s small hand.
Instead of saying so, or snorting in derision, he says instead, “I’m going after Schmidt.” His voice brooking no argument. “I’m not gonna stop until all of Hydra is dead or captured.” He thinks it gets all the things he wants to say across to Peggy loud and clear.
There’s a heavy silence; the gravity of the situation pushing down heavily, almost like having an elephant sitting on their lungs. The radio crackles with static, but it’s another moment of quiet before either of his friends speak.
on accident. The air is heavy, but it’s not with anticipation, instead it’s with a resigned confirmation: the damage has been done.
After five or six fingers of the stuff, trying to preserve the liquor for as long as possible, he stares listlessly at the ash in the air as it dances around the green liquor bottle, waiting for the alcohol to take effect. He takes another shaky breath, beginning to feel the drink. Steve becomes aware of the blood rushing through his veins, the alcohol travelling to his brain, making him feel light-headed and flushed. Steve looks down at his hands, his vision going hazy. He quirks a smile.
“James Rhodes,” he answers, smiling down at Tony, his eyes sparkling and Tony doesn’t think that’s because of the dingy lighting from above the sink. “I’d shake your hand, but you might puke on that too.”
Steve smiled at him gratefully before turning away. They sat in silence for a long time, just sitting there and watching the stars.
But the doctor has moved on. “Perhaps what Anthony needs is a new environment. When does he begin school?”
“It’s just easier to keep it on.” He finally decides, his shoulders hunched and everything inside him tensing, ready for anything.
There’s a giant silence in the hospital room that feels big and important, and Anthony doesn’t understand why.
Johnson smiled like he knew a coveted secret. “You don’t know my Freddie,” he said, his voice slurring as he was pulled down into sleep. “He was ne’er one fer waitin’.”
, instead of Captain America, there would be no confusion. He barely knows his mother, let alone his father - let him know his ‘soulmate’.”
Shocked, his head snaps up at the building. He can see right into the inside of the pub. The entrance to the bar has been completely blown away; it looks like it exploded from the inside out. There’s pieces of the ceiling on the ground, long planks of wood dropped haphazardly onto piles of brick and rubble, broken glass from the windows strewn all over the street.
They’re all so determined, but even they see the impossibility of their situation ahead of them. They have no idea what comes next.
chance of happiness with her, or with any other dame you come across, please promise me you’ll take it. You’ll try.”
“You know it doesn’t bother me, right?” Bucky asked, softness gracing his face for the first time in what felt like forever since Steve found him in Zola’s lab. There was a gentleness in Bucky’s light blue eyes, and a small smile was on his lips.
Bucky’s face was crinkled in delight as he said, “Sarah and Granny would kill you if they knew you were sweet on an English gal.”
Rhodey raises the wrist of his left hand and gestures at it, and Tony catches a brief glance of brilliant golden yellow before his eyes snap to Rhodey’s face. He can feel his own face burning with a blush, his shoulders tense in embarrassment at having looked in the first place. “Your Mark, the swatch of color on your wrist, the one that identifies who your soulmate is - your
“Would you two mind giving us a moment alone?” the doctor asks, resting her clipboard on the edge of Tony’s bed as she turns to Obie and Rhodey, her glossy raven ponytail flicking across her shoulders with the movement. “Once I finish these evaluations, you can come back.”
But of all the things Steve learned about Peggy, he never in a million years expected her to be Markless. She always wears a wristwatch in place of the customary soul bands, but on one occasion when he was down and had confessed to her that he was nearly twenty-five and still didn’t have a Mark, she had stared at him a while, a pensive expression on her face. Then she wordlessly took off her watch and showed him her wrist.
than with the same-sex thing,” says Mr. Righteous, anger coloring his tone. Call Tony drunk - oh wait, he is - but he actually believes him.
Steve’s always had trouble imagining heaven, despite the sermons and depictions of cloud-wreathed angels he’s seen over the years. He doesn’t have any doubts about this, though; hell is on earth, it’s in the trenches, and it’s all around him.
He had been stunned to see a wrist as bare as the one that greets him every day. He stared at her, and she smiled softly.
“Howard - ” both Momma and Aunt Peggy begin with a warning in their voices. But Anthony beats them to the punch.
He designs weapons, he drinks, he fucks, he fixes up classic cars in rare moments of peace, and he doesn’t sleep.
“That, and the fact that you screamed ‘I’m Tony fucking Stark’ at the top of your lungs just before you puked on my shoes.”
<I can take care of him, Sarah,> Granny McDonald reprimanded disapprovingly in Gaelic when she came to check on Steve and found him on his Ma’s lap.
“In the vision, the man was in a field of some distant land she did not recognize. She knew that the vision was of the life after, for this man in front of her was at least ten years younger, and there was a young woman with him in the field with wild hair the color of honey and eyes the color of the sky. When Joanna told the man of what she’d seen, he’d burst into tears. The woman in her vision, the man explained, was his wife who had died long ago. When Joanna removed her hands from his wrists, a gray spot appeared on his left wrist.
at least, work the way they’re supposed to. He stands carefully, rising up until he’s standing straight. He lifts his eyes above the floor.
Then there’s that one other thing about the situation that sucks: challenged beliefs or not, he may be labelled as a genius for being nineteen with two Master’s degrees, but in the eyes of his peers he’d be
Steve’s heart stutters in his chest. It’s almost like Mrs. Barnes is right in front of him, scolding him: her dark hair pinned back, ice blue eyes blazing and pointing at him with a stern, white coated finger from the flour she was using to bake.
He looks around through the rubble, everything is gray and black and it’s odd compared to the bright, colorful-filled memories he has of the place in his mind. He finds a miraculously intact table that he dusts off with his handkerchief, running the cloth carefully in each decorative carving in the wood. He’s never noticed before until he clears the dust off and he’s running his thumb along the smooth wood that the decorative curls and intricate cuts in the wood are roses.
He blinks in confusion. How did she even know he would be here when he hadn’t even known where he was going? He doesn’t understand why she came out to find him in the first place. She’s probably very busy at the SSR--why would she waste her time with him?
His own left wrist catches his eyes. He stares down at the blank space, studying the faint green veins that travel underneath his skin with no bright spot of color to obstruct it. Seeing the empty space makes Anthony's tummy feel funny, like it's swimming around in his chest. It’s like when he sees other kids with something he doesn't have.
He hears her approach him slowly, aware of how mindful she is of where she steps as though she doesn’t want to disturb the destruction. Steve just picks up the bottle of liquor beside him and pours himself another useless drink.
Steve looked around the medical tent to make sure no one had heard, but all the attendants were busy trying to save lives and didn’t care about the admission Johnson had made.
He doesn’t dare to smell the air again to check for the telltale sign of an incoming storm, for fear of taking another wiff of charred wood, hair,
is the only thought that manages to break itself through the haze of alcohol just before Tony pushes his face back into the toilet bowl and retches again.
He steps inside, going straight to the bar; the destruction around him is so familiar to him now that it’s almost soothing. He only has to move a few things that stand between him and his goal, his hands are stained black and gray from the dust by the end of it. Once he’s able to approach the bar, he looks through the collection of liquor. There are mostly shattered bottles, and pieces of glass on the ground behind the counter of the bar. He finds one bottle that’s intact, and when he dusts off the label to find out what it is, he discovers that it’s half-empty.
He can’t help himself. Anthony grins at Cap and reaches out for it - then Howard’s angry face flashes through his brain, there and gone again. The smile drops from his face and he pulls his hand away quickly.
Steve stared at him a moment, Bucky was always like a puzzle to Steve: something to be pieced together and to figure out. He had been ever since they were kids.
“Four - I mean, five,” informs Anthony, lifting up a hand to show Cap how many that was on his fingers because adults liked when he did that. “It’s my birthday today,” he explains so Cap won’t be confused.
“Howard,” Aunt Pegs says, turning her head to regard his father. Her voice is soothing and encouraging. “Why don’t you go, and leave Anthony to me?”
“You just get some rest,” he murmurs as he continues to walk, rubbing Anthony’s back soothingly like Ana does sometimes. Like his aunt did earlier.
Steve exhales shakily. Resignation settles into his bones, and he stands up from the rubble, hands clenched into fists at his sides.
Steve hunkers down further in his seat, crossing his arms over his chest and resting his head against the truck. The landscape is beautiful, and reminds him of the paintings he’d seen in books about the Louvre. The only sort of landscape he’d been able to practice drawing when he had been younger had been the packed and crowded neighborhood of Brooklyn Heights. He has to admit, looking back, that there had been points of interest in those works: a clothesline with drying white sheets and shirts and socks, the old men with their push carts, fishmongers working the oyster food stalls. He remembers the bustle and noise and the awful smell of Brooklyn and smiles, missing his home so hard there’s an ache in his chest.
“Are you Captain America?” Anthony asks even though he already knows the answer. He fidgets slightly.
“No, Anthony, not everyone has a Mark,” he explains, gently taking Anthony's small wrist in his large hand, his touch just as careful as Anthony’s was. “A person gets their Mark when their soulmate is born. The fact that you don’t have one only means that your soulmate hasn’t been born yet.”
as she says that, and Anthony manages to hold in a gasp at the sudden pain he feels; it’s like a band that’s wrapped around his heart is tightening.
“Jarvis,” Anthony begins quietly, fidgeting under the covers. The butler hums in acknowledgement. “Why did Howard say that Captain America was my soulmate?”
“She was in her home, on a warm summer’s day, and there, reading at the fire, was a young woman she had known long ago. But this young woman had died when they were both young. Joanna, coming out of her vision, told others what she had seen. One man didn’t believe her, but when she touched his hand, Joanna had another vision.
“Agent Carter,” he had greeted. Usually seeing Peggy sent butterflies fluttering in his stomach, the very real possibility that he might make a fool of himself in her presence always made him uneasy. But at the time he was exhausted, and he just wanted to collapse onto his bed and be away from the world for a while.
have been, Howard,” Aunt Pegs says patiently, shaking her head. “Howard, Anthony he...he said ‘not to fondue around’. You
It had only been a week or so before The Train had happened. They were camped out in one of the forests, and it had been late into the night, the two of them keeping watch while the rest of the Commandos were fast asleep five feet away from them.
She’d had an early shift at the hospital in the morning and Steve could tell his Ma was exhausted, but she sat up with him anyway despite how hard he tried not to disturb her. She had laid beside him in bed, taken him up into her arms, and told him the story.
He slowly moves his head across the pillow. At the end of the trail, he finds Momma dressed in a light blue pantsuit sitting on a chair beside him. Standing directly behind her is Howard in a light brown suit.
His years of work paid off when he was accepted into art school, where he learned about the French impressionists, the Italian masters, not to mention discussing the rising popularity of Mexican artists Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, or debating which was the more impactful art movement: romanticism or cubism with some of his fellow classmates. It was from those artists that he began developing his own style. God, he had loved school. He spent hours in the library, poring over each of the art books, filling up sketchbooks with his own interpretations of famous works of art and the students who studied around him.
Neither Ana nor Edwin know, and I doubt Maria has ever heard you speak his name, much less tell that story.”
He knows she would have been absolutely floored by his transformation, except that she would have hated the repeated lying he’d done in order to try to get into the army to prove himself, and the risk he’d taken for his new body. At the same time, he wonders what Granny McDonald would think about this. She’d probably swear at him in Gaelic and smack him upside his head.
Once the bells have started ringing, urging everyone to get up and when he’s able to get out of bed, Steve walks around headquarters. But everywhere he turns, eyes full of pity meet his and that’s what snaps Steve: it’s the pitying looks of his commander, and the courtesy of the soldiers and the agents of the SSR, and the barracks themselves that makes him leave.
But thinking about the future he could have had with this wonderful woman only brings him back around to his soulmate, the soulmate that had never come. All his life, he’d thought of soulmates as the final puzzle piece that completes a person, when maybe that just isn’t the case. He had thought that soulmates were like a pair of trousers that were tailor-made to fit someone, but when he thinks about it now, that isn’t ever what he’s wanted out of true love.
Cap chuckles as he drops Anthony’s hand. He bends down, gently lifts Anthony by his armpits and pulls him up into his big arms. Even though Anthony knows how strong he is, Cap cradles him gently; like something he doesn’t want to lose.
Cap’s bright blue eyes shift from studying the picture to Anthony and widen. Anthony’s heart pounds hard in his chest.
“I will personally see to it that she gets your message, Steve,” Peggy vows soberly, her voice as resilient as ever. “What else can I do?” she asks.
Aunt Peggy glances up and away from the magazine briefly to look at him, before flicking her eyes down to the magazine again. She whips her head up, her tired expression immediately clearing away into a relieved smile.
“What can you tell me about that?” she asks, her pen held high. The movement draws Tony’s eye from her poised left hand to the soul band on her wrist: a jade bracelet that glitters in the light.
“Go back to bed, you need the rest,” Sarah had whispered kindly. Granny McDonald frowned but decided to go make soup for him instead and hobbled away.
Cap lowers the shield to the ground, leaning it gingerly against the hutch, and steps slowly towards Anthony until he’s looming over him. He crouches down until he’s on one knee, at eye-level in front of him.
“Jarvis, what’s that?” he asks, pointing a finger; momentarily distracted from his mission, and leaving Cap alone in the wild blue jungles of the strange new world.
“Once upon a time,” she started again. “A long time ago, in Jerusalem, which is far, far away from here, and covered with sand and so so hot; a young woman named Joanna had been washing her clothes in the village’s well when she found a gray spot on her left wrist that hadn’t been there before. She scrubbed and scrubbed and scrubbed, but no matter how hard she tried, the spot wouldn’t come off her skin. Then she had a vision.
Anthony,” Momma soothes, her hand sliding down her seat to touch his hand. “One day, they’ll know. But for now they can’t know because it’s classified.”
“Jarvis, can a Mark be on a person’s right wrist?” he asks, releasing the butler’s arm and starts swaying his already dangling feet.
“I know you didn’t, darling,” Aunt Pegs quietly reassures as she helps him step into his Captain America pajamas, because he was insistent that he wear them tonight. “It's nobody’s fault - these things just happen.”
. It doesn’t matter anymore. The small talk doesn’t last, though; Steve knows she’s smart and will catch on to what he’s doing. It’s only a question of how long he can get away with it. As it turns out, not very long.
The doctor nods with finality and leaves. A second later, Rhodey comes through. Tony fights the very strong urge to fling himself out of the hospital window, and stays resting against the pillows.
Anthony shrugs as best he can. “I just want my party, Ana,” he replies matter-of-factly. She laughs and it reminds him of the tinkling of wind chimes.
“Do you remember anything while you were under? Smells, tastes, sensations, etcetera,” she elaborates.
“I’m fine, Aunt Pegs!” he quickly reassures her. “I - ” A sharper pain hits him in his tummy, and he doubles over, clutching his stomach as he releases a grunt.
Steve pauses as he comes up to a pile of rubble, a tumble of stones and chalky dust with no way around it to the far end of the church. Slowly, he lifts his leg and swings it over, using his back foot to balance on top of the precarious bricks. When he lowers his boot to the ground, a sudden loud
Doubt overtakes him, and he wants to scoff at the absurdity. It can’t possibly be true, that there was even such a thing as soulmates. But just as he finishes the traitorous thought, Johnson’s voice cuts through as he whispers
“I need you to take this,” he puts the toy in Anthony’s hand, curling his small fingers around it. “And I’m
“This was the one place they could go to for some relief from this hell--to escape from the horror that was in their lives. Now it’s gone.” Steve closes his eyes, obstructing his view of the destruction. “They have nothing now.”
Rhodey arches a disbelieving eyebrow. “Since when do you care about social niceties?” he asks seriously.
“Uh,” Tony says intelligently, sweat breaking out along his forehead. He lifts his right hand - with the finger monitor attached - to wipe it away.
“Yes, please,” he answers, and she hands him one. “Thank you.” She gives him one last smile before the phone rings at her desk and she leaves him alone. Anthony unwraps the cherry red candy and sticks it in his mouth.
