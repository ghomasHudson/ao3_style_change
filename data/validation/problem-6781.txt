It wasn’t the act of a gift, itself. Tony had spent almost his entire life being showered with shiny and expensive things. But Steve knew those things meant nothing to him. They were all empty, tokens of fake admiration and false loyalty.
Steve watched his men ready up, the sounds of guns loading and boots lacing up a familiar sound. One that he hadn’t heard in too long.
Looking closely, Steve could see the heavy rings that hung under Tony’s eyes, contrasting with his tan skin. It surprised him how young Tony looked like this, the lines of age and stress smoothed away in his relaxed state.
This situation with Rumlow was a test run, to see how his new business partner operated. Pierce had been a little skeptical with The Monger’s plan, but so far, it had wielded nothing but results. Rumlow was dead, a definite inconvenience, but the upcoming profit would be so much sweeter than the losses.
While Tony had definitely gotten better at balancing SI, the Avengers, and home life, sometimes there just weren’t enough hours in the day. Pepper was constantly hounding him and the R&D department for ‘the next big thing’. He would never regret walking away from making weapons, but because of it, Tony was always trying to impress and maintain the investors he had left. SHIELD, of course, was relentless; Fury and his goons continuously on the prowl for new tech. Clint went through arrows like crazy, Natasha could always use more charge in her Widow Bites, and the armor could regularly stand to be better. Tony had learned he couldn’t afford to ever leave his armor functioning less than one hundred percent. He never knew when the world would need saving; he never knew when he would need to protect his family. And speaking of family, Steve may or may not have convinced Tony that adopting a baby was a sane thing to do. While Peter was the absolute light of his life, even he still needed some Tony time.
Steve leaned his head against the inside of the door to their house. The last thing he needed was to tell Tony that they needed to move again because people were getting suspicious.
Both men whipped around, Tony startling with an added jump. Across the room sat Natasha Romanoff, idly picking at her nails.
Tony frowned, obviously not happy with the answer, so Steve stood, his lips meeting Tony’s easily. “Thank you for telling me,” he whispered before leaning back in for another kiss.
The smaller man relented, walking towards the stairs like a kid walking to the principal’s office. Steve stopped to give a final glance to Bucky, and man worrying his hands together, distressed eyes watching Clint’s retreating figure.
He hopped out of the car and looked around, trying to pinpoint anything that was out of place. But the rundown buildings just stared back silently, refusing to give him the answers he wanted.
Tony was about five seconds from jumping in himself when Barnes broke the surface again, chest heaving as he gulped down huge gasps of air. Before Tony could ask him anything, the man disappeared again, only to push Steve’s limp body above him. Tony reached out instantly, pulling The Captain up onto solid ground. He placed Steve under him, a shaking hand pressing against the blonde’s clammy neck. If Barnes heard the ghastly sob that left Tony’s throat when he was met with a weak pulse, he didn’t comment.
A sharp knock on the door pulled him from his thoughts. “Ah, Commissioner,” he said as Fury slipped through his door.
“Laugh it up now, buddy. Just tell me who you work for. Is it Hammer? Killian? It’s Hammer, isn’t it? Look, I know your boss is an embarrassment to the human race, but you’re among friends here, you can tell me. I promise not to laugh,” Tony drawled. Now Hammer? Hammer he could deal with. Hammer can't manufacture a reliable weapon, let alone find reliable henchmen. The only threat Hammer posed was the potential of someone getting a picture of the two of them out in public together. He wasn't about to have another debacle with the local rag magazines, insinuating that he and Hammer were secret lovers. He already had to deal with it every time he went into Pepper's office, his assistant taking continued pleasure in his pain by having it framed on her desk.
Steve pulled his eyes back on the road, losing himself in his own head. What was the plan? With the last three sites empty, odds were not in their favor for this next one. There were no obvious signs left by the thieves anywhere else – how was he to track them? Tony could probably hack something close by and get them a lead. But how long would that take? Were they already too late?
,” Tony grumbled. He made a mental note to talk to Happy later about adding more trackers. One's that couldn't be found by blue-eyed mob men.
“You think your dad didn’t tell me about this place?” Obie laughed. “Howard and I came here all the time for night-caps. Your mother didn’t like us drinking in the house.”
“Well, you’ll be happy to hear that the police finally caught up and found the secret underground base in the sewers. They’re out there right now scouring the whole system looking for people.”
Steve sucked in a deep breath before typing in his code to open the lab. The doors opened without delay, answering the first question on Steve’s mind. Tony was upset, but not at lab access upset yet. Unsurprisingly, it did nothing to quell the turmoil inside him.
He felt the jet touch down, and Steve’s shoulders slumped, the weight of the mission and journey home slipping away. Like with any other job they had, there was always a feeling of instant relief when they landed. A feeling of
But Tony didn’t have eyes for him anymore. He stared off onto Steve’s shoulder, a hand reaching forward to pull a small rock that had gotten lodged from his tumble.
He walked up to the door, pulling his sidearm out of the hem of his pants to shoot the lock off. He heaved open the door, grunting at the resistance, the metal door creaking open.
Bucky moved to put a hand on his shoulder. “Yeah, buddy, you’re a dead man. Should’a left you in the warehouse.”
Steve quickly slipped the condom on his cock, lining up behind Tony. Steve couldn’t help but look down in awe at Tony, slowly trailing a hand down Tony’s cheek. His chest was heaving, his lips absolutely swollen.
for God’s sake. How could he have been so stupid; if he would have just used his brain, he could’ve put two and two together.
That’s why, sitting in the empty cafeteria, Clint tightened his grip on the knife he smuggled in. Tony Stark was bad news. Clint knew it, Steve knew it, everyone knew it. Why Steve was even bothering to put up with the man had Clint’s head reeling. Dealing with Tony Stark was basically asking for a one way ticket to hell.
Another pain hit hard in Steve’s chest. After all that he'd already done, it still hurt Steve every time that Tony didn’t expect anything in return. Like he didn’t deserve it. That somewhere out there, someone had told Tony that he wasn’t good enough. That he wasn’t worth it. Steve was going to change that.
“And neither are you,” Barnes snapped. “This isn’t you messing around with scrap in the basement, this is serious! That thing is going in your chest and is supposed to keep your heart beating. Don’t you think that risking your life would require a little more planning?”
"And you pushed it with a threat to my crew," retorted Steve. "You can't expect me to be in a very cooperative mood."
Finally alone, Steve was left with his thoughts. He bit his lip before reaching down for his phone. He dialed the number quickly, happy to find it picked up on the first ring.
Bucky frowned. It was more sleep than he got yesterday. His body was finally acclimating to this hell hole, finally accepting his current situation.
He reached back into his pocket, pulling out his phone. His second explosion at the Avengers base had been confirmed, but he still had his last card to play.
Steve watched as the all-knowing eye give him a once over, scanning him slowly, before slipping back over to the left, looking at one of the chairs that was faced away from the door.
he wanted to say. Something told him that she would not be amused. “Yeah, of course,” he replied instead. “Just make sure that the wire doesn’t touch the socket wall. Pretend you’re playing Operation.”
He could sit there and be furious about his current life, but it sure beat what he thought was going to happen. Steve and Tony, they’d gotten them all out, they’d gotten them all out
He waited until Stark’s suit reentered the building. He tapped a code into his code, sitting back, ready for the finale.
Sure enough, Steve rogers peeked over the couch with a slight blush on his face. “Uh, sorry. I didn’t…. oops?” Steve trailed off, rubbing his hand on the back of his neck.
Bucky caught Natasha’s laugh over the receiver. His chest clenched, his fingers twitching to reach out for her, when he knew she wasn’t there. Her laugh had always been his favorite thing.
He was a hit, of course. His Midwestern snark and easy smile were addicting, getting him a permanent spot in the family. It was Bucky who had finally approached Steve about putting Clint in the field, doing more dangerous ops. Before Steve could object, Bucky pulled out two slim hearing aids.
Clint couldn’t help himself. He swept Tony up into another hug, sighing in relief when Tony’s arms squeezed him back. “I’m still here, buddy. I’m not going anywhere.”
Steve walked over to the man, flipping him over. Taking out a small pocket knife, he cut through the man’s jacket, revealing his prize. Four blocks of silver taped to his victim’s back shone back up at Steve. He pocketed the bars, strapped his shield on his back, and began the cleanup process.
“Well, I’m down some coffee and a perfectly good window, so I’m not really sure how I benefit here,” Sam chuckled.
“This is Campbell,” she said, pointing to the armed agent behind her. “He’ll be heading in with you.” The man nodded at them, but said nothing, already taking off towards his designated entry point. “Time to move,” Hill added, but stopped them before moving. “Stick to the plan,” she pressed. “You said it yourself. HYDRA is too dangerous to be messing around with.”
"You may not make the same mistake twice, but that doesn't mean that you didn't make a different one." Tony reached into his pocket and pulled out his phone. "Tracker's built in."
Seriously, you guys deserve it. I could not (and still can't) believe all the positive comments left on last week's poll. With a story this long, sometimes it's hard to keep everyone on board and engaged, especially since it's a work in progress. Seriously, you guys are fantastic; it's such a blessing to be on this journey with each and every one of you.
I get my hands on just one of those babies and we’re in business. I reverse engineer the thing, and boom. We’re walking around with the best weapons on the market.”
. Your work on gamma radiation is unparalleled. Also, I’m a huge fan on how you basically turned into a rage monster and singlehandedly dismantled Ross’s military network.”
“Of course,” she replied. “There’s an east entrance right over there,” she added with a point of her fingers. “I’ll take two of my men through there, while you and Barnes head through the back, accompanied by one of my own.”
Natasha looked across the studio and saw a few other moms still milling about with their daughters. Natasha cursed under her breath, making a steady retreat to her office before one of the women – the dreaded Mrs. Barkley – caught her eye. If she had to listen to that woman bitch about her daughter not getting enough attention in the class one more time, it would not end well.
After the man had gone down, a quick knock to the head and he was out cold. Which seemed nice at the time, but Tony was anything but patient. Waiting for the man to regain consciousness was like watching ice melt. This man could provide the answers both he and The Captain were desperate for. If this was just some antsy mob that got too cocksure, or if HYDRA really had returned from the grave. Tony hoped for the former.
Barnes moaned appreciatively, slamming the now empty cup down against the counter. “You’re supposed to be on bed rest,” he said smugly. “No coffee for you.”
Steve and Tony shared a look. That definitely didn’t bode well. “Well, we’re not,” Steve started, carefully, as if trying not to spook a wild animal.
. I don’t care if you think this is God’s punishment, or another second chance; just accept that it’s happening. It’s time to get your head out of your ass. You’re not alone, Stevie. I’m still here, we’re all still here. And, well, I don’t know about the rest of the team, but I don’t plan on going anywhere, anytime soon. We
“I think you can pull it off,” Tony refuted. “I’ll pay you a thousand bucks if you go golfing with that and use it at least twice.”
The stroll to his office seemed shorter than usual, Steve’s brain frantically thinking of something to say, anything to say, that would make this easier for Clint. But there was nothing. Any stability that he had found over the last few months were to be destroyed, brought crashing to the ground by Steve.
“Dad has some property in South Carolina, a lake house. I’m sure it was at my mother’s instance; she was always trying to get me outside.”
Steve smiled, looking down at the brunette that was still passed out, seemingly pressed as tightly against Steve as possible.
Steve hummed happily, greedily dipping into Tony’s mouth, wrapping the smaller man up in his arms until Tony pulled away from air. The brunette dipped back down, snuggling into Steve’s chest.
Steve snorted and pushed back on his knees. “How you’ve managed to convince the world that you’re a suave playboy is beyond me.” Steve crawled off the bed and stepped back over to the end table, Tony unable to pull his eyes from the thick length the bobbed between his legs with each step. The drawer was opened again, and Steve pulled out a condom.
Tony sighed. “Yes, I’ll try and put in a few more hours. Just give me time. That’s all I’m asking for. I need time to figure this out.”
Tony’s mind hissed. He cursed inwardly, hating himself or thinking that. He owed Yinsen everything; there was no way he would have survived the blast without him.
He threw open the door, almost tripping over a pair of bodies. For a moment, Clint saw red, thinking them to be bodies of other Commandos. Looking back down, Clint was relieved to see that they were Hammer’s men.
Barton pulled him up from the chair and over to the door. “I don’t understand. They never mentioned you,” Loki continued. He and Pierce were no where close to friends, but they had a mutual respect for one another. But where Loki was illusive and vague, Pierce was narcissistic and proud. He couldn't help but boast about his achievements. How he had been the one to rise HYDRA back from its grave, and how he would be the one to finish Rogers off for good. But yet he hadn't mention anything about Barton. Something like this would have been their crown jewel.
Tony felt Steve tense, but he was the one to dart up in surprise. “Coulson?” he asked with a sliver of hope.
Pepper nodded, and started to usher Stane out of the room. “It was nice to meet you,” she said passing Steve. Steve returned the pleasantry before turning back to Stane.
Bucky looked back over at him, his eyes wild and red rimmed. “Wanna know why we were there when the bombs went off? Because I wouldn’t let us leave. Wanna know why Stark knows your name? Because I called out for you. Wanna know why you almost drowned? Because I
“I’m sorry, Mrs. Hogenson,” Steve sighed. “But our liability is spelled out in paragraph seventeen. It states clearly that- ”
It was simple. Where the common room was full with the latest tech, Steve’s walls were filled with tall bookshelves, and was that? Yep. Tony had outfitted Steve with what looked like the best art supplies on the market.
And then Tony was walking past him, not to the bedroom as Steve had hoped, but down the hallway to his lab, stopping only to grab the bottle of whiskey on the way out. Steve just stood and watched him leave, unable to turn his eyes away from the defeated slump of the brunette’s shoulders.
Tony sighed, looking down both sides of the street. He took off to the left, hoping to find some solace.
He had been tasked with helping citizens get back to their homes safely after the rest of HYDRA had been cleared out. That’s when it happened.
While Steve had thought that would be the end of it, he found himself face to face with Clint three days later.
The small girl huffed, shoulders dropping in defeat. “Again,” she said despairingly. “I shouldn’t be doing this without the barre. I’m not ready.”
Grabbing the shield on the ground, he covered his head, as well as throwing his past self over his shoulder, running into the night.
he whispered in a rough voice. Before Tony could respond, the mob boss was crossing the room in large steps, engulfing Tony in a hug.
It was when the fire started to show colors of red and blue that Clint managed to panic even more. Head snapping to the left, he could see trucks with siren lights approach the group. Clint jumped up, trying to pull Steve with him. “Steve! Come on, Steve, we gotta go! Get up, get up!” It was instinctive, his body finally accepting the command to attempt something as familiar as running from the cops. Anything to do,
“HYDRA was and still is the greatest threat we’ve ever faced. We lost a lot the last time. Now, I will spend each and every breath that I have left in me to make sure that it won’t be like last time. But I can’t play God; there will be things that even I won’t be able to stop no matter how hard I try. That being said,” The Captain continued, “if anyone, and I mean anyone, does not want any part of this, you have every right to leave. I can get you some cash, get you somewhere safe, get you out. No one here, especially not me, will think any less of you for wanting to leave; you have each proven yourselves more than enough. Any takers?”
Phil pressed forward one final time to give Clint a lasting kiss. “I love you,” he whispered, calming voice sending a shiver down Clint’s spine. “Now go, get out of here,” he said, pushing Clint’s phone back into his hands. “And when I call you later, you sure as hell better answer. Got it?”
“It’s one thing to put them there, it’s another to say they were there the whole time,” Fury countered. “To the rest of the force, the physical files don’t exist. Why?”
Clint rolled his eyes, grabbing everyone’s discarded mugs to bring them to the sink. Steve came in behind him, placing the leftover coffee cake on the counter. He paused, giving Clint a soft look. “It really is good to see you,” he said. “And, I know what I said, but- ” he sighed. “I’m glad Phil’s here. You deserve to be happy, Clint.”
Clint startled awake, lungs taking in huge gulps of air. His hands trembled as he brushed away the tears stinging his eyes.
Leaning down and grabbing at Barnes’s only arm, Tony pulled him up into a fireman’s carry. “Come on now, Barnes. You need to stay alive for me to blackmail you about this later.”
Tony could hear Strange murmuring to the nurses in the other room, no doubt checking over Barnes one final time, but Tony paid them no mind. His eyes zeroed in on the briefcase, Tony moving quickly to snatch it up.
Clint looked back at his house but could feel his body still tight as a coil, vibrating with anger. He turned right, opting to walk through the surrounding woods on his property, trying to calm down.
Steve’s hands trembled as he poured another glass of whiskey. It was quiet, the only sounds coming from the bottle hitting the glass tumbler.
Tony scoffed, running a hand through his hair. “You’re joking right? Like you’re having a laugh. You really can’t expect me to not tell the family that you’re not dead!”
“Besides,” added Bucky. “Pierce is still running the NYPD. You think that he’ll let you leave if you go waltzing in there? I understand you want to do everything to help get Tony back, we all do. But getting yourself thrown in prison is not gonna help anyone.”
“Come on.” With another tug, he spurred Steve farther to the rear of the club, finally reaching the Loopers headquarters. Outside the office door, other Loopers were standing around, trying to listen to the conversation on the other side of the door.
Sam shook his head but dutifully backed towards the door, stopping the music from drifting out of his phone as he walked by. “I’ll be back later,” he promised to Steve before slipping outside. A heavy silence weighed between the two that were left, Steve feeling his heartbeat pick up. He hadn’t seen Hill like this. Not since Fury died. Well, Fury didn’t really die, so that face could mean anything. Somehow, that made it a lot worse.
“Clint, we gotta get out of here!” Bucky cried, tugging harder at his friend. The cops were getting closer, hands reaching down to draw their weapons.
There was only one time that Clint was grateful that HYDRA existed. He wouldn’t have met Phil without them. Sometimes, Clint wishes that they never met, and that Phil was off living some apple pie life with some cellist or something like that; Clint knew he was a danger to Phil. But if anything, Phil was more stubborn than Clint. He wasn’t leaving Clint; wasn’t taking no for an answer. He knew that from the beginning.
“Yes ma’am,” Steve answered, twiddling his thumbs. He and Bucky had been in her office for the better part of two hours, slowly explaining everything that had happened between his crew and her boss. It was excruciating, but it needed to be done. Tony had told Steve that he trusted Pepper with his life; if there was anyone that could help them find Tony, it was her.
“Get me out of here,” the voice behind him snapped, scoffing when Clint forced them to a stop instead. Perching the two of them around the corner, Clint pulled out his gun, peeking back out ever so slightly. “What are you waiting for?” the other man hissed.
Steve’s hands left his body long enough to unbuckle his pants pushing them down around his knees. Tony could see the outline of his erection, pressing tightly against his underwear. Tony’s mouth watered and moved to follow suit quickly, shimming out of his pants as quickly as he could.
The fireman nodded. “Oh course.” The fireman started to walk back towards Stark Industries, his hand slipping into his uniform checking that his pistols were still in place. The fireman grinned.
“However, I think this job was a reminder that we aren’t as invulnerable as we like to think. It’s been a while since we faced a threat such as HYDRA. We can’t keep running around with our heads in the sand.”
The large blonde crossed the room, not even hesitating to engulf her into a strong hug. “Where the hell have you been? Jesus, I’ve been going out of my mind trying to find you.”
“No life signs detected, Sir. With the structural integrity at only forty-two percent, might I suggest you evacuate the premises?”
“It’s just something that will have to tide us over until Tony and I come up with a better plan,” said Steve. “We’ll be able to keep tabs on each other, even though we’re… not at home.”
“We don’t need to do anything!” Tony shouted, hands shaking violently. He was twitchy, bouncing between each of his feet and hands wringing his wrists nervously, as if the thought of an argument was sending him into a conniption. “Let’s just move on, and- ”
Steve slammed his head one of his captors, taking him down. A swift kick and a snapped neck, brought down the second. Before the last man could pull out his gun, Steve charged, beating him to a pulp.
Since then they had more than a few donations, a simple thank you from their loyal listeners, but it was never anything substantial. Not that Steve ever minded; he knew that their podcast was a small fish in a very large pond that was the world of broadcasting.
He landed with a thud, the harsh jump pushing the air for Steve’s lungs. He groaned as he felt his right knee landed the wrong way on some debris.
But not Pepper. She never had a single hair out of place, both literally and figuratively. With her standing next to Tony, it was a constant reminder that maybe his dad had been right. Maybe he was worthless. But he could see now that he wasn’t meant for this. This, being here in these clothes, in this room, with these people? It was all fake. It was as if he had been walking through a dream – one that was not his.
Tony looked up at Steve, smiling softy when Steve pulled him into a kiss. “I’m not going anywhere. Not without you,” Steve said against his lips.
The man was huge; if Tony listened closely enough, he could probably hear the clothes straining, trying to contain his bulk. The room was dark; the only light coming from a flickering bulb, but Tony could still make out the steely blue eyes that pierced him from across the room. Tony repressed a shudder. He was an intimidating man, sure, able to bring any business man to his knees in seconds. But Muscles over there did not sit well with Tony. Not that Tony would ever give him the satisfaction of knowing that. This wasn’t the first time Tony had ended up in some dank and smelly room, waiting for some second-rate criminal to try and strike a deal with him.
Rogers tried for years to help get the two out of the city, to get them a better life. Lord knows they deserved it. But the two were stubborn, sticking with their degrading jobs, barely meeting their rent.
Obie was silent for a minute, shooting an unreadable expression at Tony. “What, like arc reactor technology? That was a publicity stunt, Tony. We haven’t made any advancement in that field in over thirty years. Isn’t that right?”
Bruce would never forget the look of pure terror on the mothers face as she pulled her child away. It was just the reminder Bruce needed to prove he was still a monster. The thing families cower from.
Phil could barely see Fury through his half lidded eyes. Even if Fury hadn’t mentioned their location, Phil would have been able to figure out that he was drugged out of his mind. Honestly, it was a miracle that he got a full sentence out of his cotton mouth.
Clint shut the office door and walked down the back stairs towards the holding cells. He almost didn’t want to find what was down there. They had put Delmar back in the interrogation room handcuffed to the chair, but God only knew where he ended up after Steve was done with him.
What didn’t make sense was why Pierce had been spreading the news like wildfire. “Why would he report this to the NYPD? The information collected is priceless.”
Who were they? Steve got closer, looking over decomposing flesh and rotting bodies, clearing showing that they were anything but fresh.
“Come on, Cap, it’s a thousand dollars! Think of all the pizzas I can order with that kind of money.”
Clint ran over to her, searching for injuries. “Thank god, you’re ok. You are ok, right? I mean, should I call- ”
“We really do need to stop meeting like this, Officer Coulson,” Tony said, his voice carefully even.
His team always thought it was the physical drain that made Bruce so glum after a mission. But it was the emotional toil that burned deep inside him.
Also, get ready! The reunion is happening soon! (Honestly, I might be more excited than you guys; those boys need some serious lovin' and finally have their moment to kick some ass.)
He sprinted into the last turn of his run, trying to burn the last few calories before reaching the door. Which, of course, caused him to face plant into someone leaving the tower. That someone being Tony Stark.
Matthew Drumm tapped a broken melody on the side of the van he was leaning against. He had been waiting hours for Hammer’s field men to come back from the job, hopefully with The Captain and Stark in tow.
Steve didn’t waste any time delving his tongue into Tony’s, relearning the engineer’s sweet taste. He caressed Tony’s face as he leaned in for more.
Tony blinked, not even realizing that he had shut his eyes. “Well, I’m on a lot of drugs. It’s a miracle I even made it over here.” Upon hearing Clint’s small laugh, Tony reached for a hand to help him up. “I’ll just, uh, head on back to- ”
The conversation was scarily similar to one he gave to Bucky, pulling him away from liquor bottles and letting the man weep on his shoulder, still mourning the loss of his arm. Steve swallowed the memory back down.
Steve knew what Tony could potentially become. But he wasn’t going to let that happen. Not to Tony. Steve said he would protect this man. Steve would save this man. Make sure Iron Man will never exist. Change the future.
“You know, I don’t think you will. I think you’ll lie again.” Tony was pushed further into the barrel.
“I do trust you,” sighed Steve. “It’s me I don’t trust. Look at all the shit I’ve caused already. I didn’t tell Tony who I was, I left you in that warehouse. How long before I make the wrong decision again?”
It wasn't until Bucky caught him trying to teach himself ASL that Steve finally revealed Clint to the rest of the team.
"The same reason you told them your name," Tony replied with a soft, knowing smile. "You asked me earlier, what we were. But, I don't know how to quantify this. All I know is that I don't... I-I can't..."
That wasn’t right. Howard was dead. But he was dead, right? But Steve? God, Steve can’t be dead. Was Steve in the fire?
The Captain hummed. “It makes sense. They need a way to build up their numbers somewhere. What do you think?”
Thor’s face turned grave. “I do not think you should interrupt him. He’s having a chat with Hammer.”
Clint flew back up the stairs and breathed in relief when he saw the rest of his team in the briefing room. Not even caring for formalities, he burst in and grabbed Tony, pulling him back to the stairwell.
They exited through the restaurant’s entrance, Steve frowning at the darkened room. “Where’s Yinsen?” he asked.
“And what about the rest of us?” Sam asked quietly. “What if Fury throws the whole lot of us in prison?”
“Excuse me,” Pepper interrupted. “You better not be dragging him into another mess of yours,” she said with a frown, her arms crossing.
Clint had been trying, they all were. Trying, doing anything to keep them all from drowning. Sam was a constant presence by Steve’s side, Bruce always making sure that Bucky was taking the meds that Dr. Strange had given him, or that everyone was eating. Clint always had men on watch, even had Thor reach out in his own networks to keep them in the loop.
“Think of this as the best way to keep us safe,” Tony placated. “Witness protection was only ever an option because we know HYDRA doesn’t end with Pierce. There’s a whole network that we haven’t unearthed yet, and once Pierce is out of the picture, they’re going to be gunning for us. At least this way we’ll be out of New York and living on the FBI’s dime,” he smiled.
Barton sighed. “I really don’t have time for this.” The man reached into his mouth, pulling out a white false tooth.
“No, no, no,” Tony started, shaking at Barnes’s shoulders. “What you need is to stay awake, okay? Help is coming I promise, just stay with me a little longer.”
Both men drank in silence, enjoying each other’s company. Who would have known Clint Barton, the man whose life had been ripped apart by Loki’s schemes would still toast to him in the end. Thor smiled softly at Clint.
Steve nodded, silently preening when he caught Stark’s impressed gaze. “I know it’s not a lot, but I need you to hit the streets. Start at the warehouse and make your usual perimeter; take people with if you need. Talk to your sources, bribe people, I don’t care. Find this man.”
“Yea, sure, I’ll give you a bottle for the road.” Tony made a move to shut the door, but the woman slipped inside.
“I’ve never been more sure about anything else, Pepper. I have a responsibility to see this through. For my family.”
"But it was some of your followers, wasn't it?" Pierce asked. "It wasn't either of us, so it had to have been you who put out the personal hit."
“Oh, I’m sorry,” Bucky answered. “Forgive me for not being peachy enough after being smacked awake. Which was for what reason, again?”
After what seemed like an eternity, Stark turned to face Steve with a grim expression. “Weapons dealer?” he asked in a strained voice, pointing over at Thor.
Tears slipped down his cheeks now, as Tony had stopped trying to rein them in. “No, please. Don’t do this.
“You’re not focusing. Come on, you’re making this too easy,” chided Bucky, throwing Steve to the mat yet again. Each time his body thudded against the ground, Steve stood up with that much more anger, trying harder and harder to hit Bucky. His large muscles were straining, sweat stinging as it dripped into his eyes. Bucky kept throwing around a few more snarky comments, never hitting back, just using enough force to throw Steve back down to the mat.
Tony walked over to the office door, pressing his ear against the old wood. When he didn’t hear anything, Tony opened the door slowly, the creaking echoing in the silent room.
He stood up slowly, leading the group from The Captain’s office back out to the main meeting room where over half of the table was covered in computers that Tony had dropped off almost two weeks ago. Tony sat down behind one the computers, the screen flickering to life. “I put a tracker in the files I leaked. That way we can trace the computer being used to access the files.”
“I know,” Clint comforted, bracing a hand on Steve’ shoulder. “You didn’t mean it. You know that. More importantly, he knows that.”
Before he knew it, the car was stopped again, and Obadiah was back outside, standing in one of the harbor’s shipping warehouses.
“Well, you kept moping around! What did you expect me to do?” Steve watched as Tony hesitantly place a hand along Bucky’s back, patting it awkwardly. Bucky tensed, as if finally catching up with what predicament he was in, and jolted back. Steve could barely contain his laughter as he watched his friend sputter. “I, okay, well, that-that’s, um, great? I-I’m just gonna- ” he broke off, running out of the lab.
Steve dropped his hands away from his face to look at Thor. He hadn’t even heard the other man come in. Who knows long he had sat there.
Fury froze in his seat, his eye never leaving Tony. “Stane. Obadiah Stane,” he repeated slowly. “As in your current CFO, Stane.”
“I don’t mean to bother you, but I’ve been up and down this neighborhood all day, checking all the houses.”
Phil's voice was steady, calming as it always was, but it didn't help Clint this time. He knew that Loki already had a head start on them; if he was able to get the entirety of The Commandos chasing a whisper to a condemned firehouse chained to a wall, who knows what he could do when he was walking free. “Go faster,” Clint hissed to Bucky.
The other brunette let out a long sigh, pinching his nose between his fingers. “Fine,” he relented. “Two hours. No more than that.”
Steve clenched his eyes shut tightly. "There wasn't anything you could have done," he whispered, voice wavering in pain. "You couldn't have known that was going to happen."
There stood Sam, gun in hand, face beat to hell. His eyes swept over the carnage in the room. “Have fun?” he asked with a bloody smile.
“And they are,” Tony added, looking back at Bucky. “I’ve already scanned through the FBI servers. Everyone’s fine.”
Steve swallowed. “He’s in critical condition, but he’s stable. He’s out of surgery now, but who knows when they’ll let me see him again.”
Tony clicked decline, however, quickly turning his phone’s sound off. The real world could wait a few more minutes. He shot The Captain an embarrassed look, trying to push himself farther in the cushions of his chair. The Captain gave him nothing but an odd glance, causing Tony to flush harder.
Growing up in a house full of women had been difficult; he’d become the man of the house when he was just seven. His father had died overseas, fighting – he still remembers his mother’s face when she told him. Remembers the tears down her face when she whispered,
Steve woke up alone. Reaching out to the other side of the bed, he felt Tony’s side was cold, meaning Tony had been up and about for a while.
Rumlow tried to catch his breath while simultaneously trying to make himself more presentable in front of his boss. “Sir, you’re not going to believe what I just saw.”
“Well, I’d like to think you could manage the meaning of the word ‘no’,” quipped Tony, not even looking up from whatever he was working on.
Steve had Clint spy on potential problems all over Brooklyn, which he did with near perfection. Each of his reports to Steve were filled with overwhelming data. And when Steve found out he knew how to handle a weapon? Steve knew he needed this man for the Commandos. Steve will never forget the day Clint pulled out a bow and arrow and hit a bulls-eye at each target at the range.
Pierce leaned back in his chair. Loki was a loose cannon; there was no way that he could possibly trust the man. On the other hand, Loki could be the step to get him back out in the game. Now that the lead with Coulson is gone, HYDRA was stagnant. Rogers and his crew were hanging on by a thread. He couldn’t afford to put their demise off any longer.
“I was handling it just fine,” Steve retorted, loading in the new bullets. “Maybe you came back because you knew it was your fault. Guilt’s a bitch, isn’t it?”
Steve peered back through the glass, seeing nothing but darkness. It really did look like no one was home. Without thinking, Steve snapped a fist out, punching into the thick glass, creating spider web cracks all over the door.
“No, no, I’m fine. Steve, look at me, I’m alright.” He pulled away slightly just so he could look up at the blonde, trying to give him a winning smile.
“Get us to your people. Bruce will know what to do.” The car lurched as Barnes threw the car into drive, the three men finally leaving the frozen river behind.
Tony spun around to face the older man. “Well, I’m just assuming you were yelling at me for something.”
“Because you do know that I’m not technically your boss,” Steve continued. “Buck, you can take a break from this if- ”
Fury hummed. “Then you’ll forgive me that I’m so confused. Because when I called Ms. Potts, she couldn’t remember the name of the officer that she talked to or the exact date that she talked to you on. So either she’s not that bright, or you never talked to her.”
It hurt, of course. Having Tony Stark on board for good would be a huge game changer for Steve and the crew. But Tony had never gone monogamous with a single mob before; Steve knew it was a lot to ask.
A piece of falling debris crashed net to him. Tony couldn’t help but shudder, remembering the last time he was in exploding building did not end well for him.
“You don’t think,” Clint started, ice forming in his veins. “You don’t think they killed him in front of Steve, do you?”
And wasn’t that a relief. Once the dots started connecting between these murders – originally considered to be accidental deaths – it seemed like law enforcement was running around like a chicken with its head cut off, struggling to find and clues on the murderer or even reasoning as to what they’re angle was. “I’m glad,” Steve offered. “Those families will finally get the closure they need.”
Not even waiting for an answer, Clint charged through the back room. While he didn’t know exactly where Steve was, the screams that were coming from the rear door was clue enough for him. Clint burst through the door, watching as Steve’s hands were just curling around Hammer’s throat.
Tony scoffed. “Fine. I know where I’m not appreciated.” He stuck a hand out that Sam immediately shook. “Catch you later, Wilson.”
And there it was. Out in the open. He had been made. It wasn’t like Phil thought he could keep the secret forever. He knew that someone would find him out one day. He had only prayed that Clint would have been as far away as possible when it happened. He hoped that when he’d get incarcerated, that Clint would be safe.
Tony’s head turns hard, staring at Steve. “You drew these?” he asks incredulously. “I told you I was an artist.”
Tony leans down to kiss Steve. “Are you sure you’re ok? You hit your head…” Steve gives him a peck. “I’m fine. Let’s go to bed.”
Steve is practically cackling, holding his stomach and rolling on the floor as Tony stands over the chair, staring at his handiwork. The chair is somehow backwards, half of the legs going in one direction and half going the other.
He nods again. “Alright. Drink your coffee while I get everything ready.” He snags a cushion from one of the chairs at the breakfast nook and sets it next to a chair. Tony takes his place, setting his mug on the table and then kneeling on the cushion. His heart pounds. Should he be naked? Should he look down?
Tony wakes the next morning with Steve’s arm around his waist. He’s so warm. Their skin a little sticky from sweat and the night before. The night before…
Swallowing, Tony nods. “We’ll take it easy. No kneeling.” Tony’s heart lurches. “Unless…that’s what you want?” Tony licks his lips. This man, this random stranger he’d met in a dive bar, has been a better Dom in one night than Tiberius had been in six months.
Steve groans, hands grabbing tight at Tony’s ass. He uses his grip to continue the grinding, and finally kisses Tony on the lips. Tony kisses back hungrily, quickly bringing his tongue into play.
“It’s perfect,” Tony tells him as he steps into Steve’s arms. Steve kisses him gently. “Happy birthday, baby.” Tony flushes. Usually he’d make some snarky comment, but Steve is being so genuine. “Thank you.”
Before he can make his way over, his path is blocked by a hulking figure. He’s practically puffing his chest out in a tight, black t-shirt. “Well, aren’t you a pretty thing?” the man asks, smirking. Steve scowls. “Ooh a feisty sub. You’d be fun to break.” The man reaches to touch his face and Steve swats him away. “Not a sub,” Steve growls.The man’s eyebrows raise in surprise. “Come on, sweetheart. Don’t be like that. I’m Brock. Let me show you a good time.” He makes a move to touch him again. Steve grabs Brock’s wrist and twists it behind him. Caught off guard, Brock yelps. “I’m. Not. A sub,” Steve repeats, making his voice drop low and letting his Dom nature slip seamlessly into his tone. He shoves Brock away, who turns on him, practically snarling. As Steve raises his fists, Bucky steps between them. “Back off, man. We don’t want any trouble.” Brock makes to protest, but Bucky silences him with a level glare. “Whatever,” Brock scoffs.
He follows the hallway to the master bedroom. It’s a bit rustic, but homey. The bed is large and plush, with warm blankets. The bathroom is attached. It has a shower, but also a huge tub that Tony is certain they’ll want to use.
Tony grabbed Steve’s arm and dragged him to a private car he’d hired with a few taps on his cellphone. “Tony? Where are we going?”
Steve follows Bucky into the club. He nibbles at his lip ring. Dating hasn’t always gone well for him. He gets stood up, ditched. People think he’s a sub, or that he’s not Dom enough. Bucky goes to grab them drinks, his combat boots clunking heavily and the chain on his pants jingling. Steve takes the opportunity to look around. He’s had a few subs, but he hasn’t found the right kind. He’s not quite sure what he’s looking for yet.
“Green.” Tony tries to keep his voice even, but he wants this, wants it so bad. “Alright.” Steve walks to the living room and Tony crawls after him. “Get on the couch.”
Rummaging through the luggage, Steve pulls out Tony’s ring. It’s coded to Steve’s fingerprint. When he brushes his fingers over it, it opens. He clamps it around the base of Tony’s leaking cock. He’s also pulled out their silk restraints. He puts Tony’s wrists in them, pushing them over his head.
“Oh? Well then I’m sure you won’t want to hear about the robotics exhibit at the Museum of Science?” Steve looked up at her, eyes wide. “Nat, that’s perfect!” She smirks, sipping her tea. “Of course.” Steve types frantically on his laptop. “Thank you, Nat!”
They’re panting into each other mouths as they grind against each other. Tony feels a little silly, straddled against Steve and grinding like a teenager. Even so, they haven’t gotten very far yet, so this is a welcome change.
“There is a severe design flaw in this chair.” Steve laughs harder. Tony’s face turns red. He throws down the instructions and the allen wrench. “I give up! JARVIS order some real furniture.”
“Though, it’s pretty funny. I was going to ask you to this same gallery opening,” Steve says as he steps closer to Tony. Tony’s posture stiffens. He can’t be seen mooning over a Dom. He can’t think of anything to say.
The car came to a sudden stop. The driver said something and Steve slipped out from underneath Tony, opening the door. Tony gave chase. He needed Steve to block his bulging erection from anyone who might want to snap a picture.
He fucked up. God, he fucked up so bad. He didn’t mean to hurt Steve, the only Dom who’s ever been good to him. “Steve, please-“ His heart starts pounding, the room starts to spin. God, he can’t breathe. He can’t-
Sarah doesn’t know if he’s compensating, but he seems happy with his loud music and his odd looking friends. She loves him all the same.
“Next time,” Steve had promised. Despite costing a measly $3, the burgers were heavenly. Steve had three, which didn’t seem to surprise the waitress, and even Tony finished his burger and fries. He might have…forgotten the last time he’d eaten. Leave it to Steve to know Tony that well.
Steve pulls back first, panting slightly. “I really like you, Tony. Could we do this again sometime?” Tony nods, fingers still clutching Steve’s shirt. Steve leans over to kiss Tony’s forehead. “Good night, Tony.”
“Don’t be sorry,” Steve says. He kisses Tony’s temple, then rolls out of bed. Tony feels suddenly cold. He pulls up the blankets. “Hungry?” Steve asks.
“Would you like me to feed you?” Steve asks. He’s shirtless, which gives Tony the chance to look more at the mix of colors and designs that extend down one arm and the ribs on the other side. Steve’s sandy blonde hair is a bit mussed, his bangs floppy in front of his eyes. He’s skinny, bones poking out, but he seemed to have handled himself just fine the previous night. Tony’s face feels hot at the rush of memories.
Tony stares at him. “You…I thought you were being coy in the bar! You don’t know who I am?!” Steve bites back a laugh. “Should I?” Tony runs a hand over his face. “You’re in Manhattan. In a huge tower. With a man named Tony.”
“Yes,” Tony says. He responds so beautifully, opening his mouth slightly in invitation. It takes all of Steve’s self-control not to make Tony suck his fingers in the middle of the bar.
Steve stands. “JARVIS ignore him. Tony, we’ll figure it out later. For now, let’s get a burger. I’m starving.” Tony huffs softly. “You’re always hungry. Come on, big guy. I know a great place.” Tony puts an arm around Steve’s shoulders, patting as they walk out the door, leaving the “chair” for later.
Swallowing hard, Tony nods slightly and resumes his position. He distracts his brain with math in his head, thinks about anything but the itch in his muscles. Steve checks in every so often, making sure that he’s okay. Steve’s gaze never wavers and Tony is definitely blushing as his eyes rake over Tony’s form. He’s half hard already, thinking about Steve’s hands on him, what he must look like to Steve- aroused and silently begging for Steve.
Tony relaxes into the warmth and Steve’s strong arms around him. Tony’s birthday may not be the most important, but he has to admit, he doesn’t really mind his birthday if he gets to spend it like this.
The first time Tony saw Steve speak French was when he watched footage of his fight with Batroc. Steve’s challenge, On va voir, sent a shiver of lust down his spine. The rasp to his voice, the excellent pronunciation… Plus, Tony had “A Fish Called Wanda” level of attraction to polyglots. Could you blame him? Everything sounds sexier in a language you can’t understand.
Steve sets his plate of toast and fruit on the table, sliding into the seat. He sips his coffee, reading the newspaper that Tony never reads. Tony breathes steady and slow, remembering the exercises from his therapist. “Color?” Tony looks up. “Green.”
Tony’s body feels tingly as he remembers his request. “The whole weekend,” he croaks. Steve smiles. “Thought you might say that.”
“Whatever you like?” Tony says, but it sounds more like a question. Steve frowns, moving his hand away. “Tony,” Steve urges. Tony looks a little helpless. “Um, I don’t…I don’t really like a lot of pain. Spanking is okay, but I don’t want to be scratched or cut or burned.” Steve rewards his honesty by moving his hand up Tony’s thigh. Tony’s breath hitches. “Don’t like being called mean things. No videos. Like bondage, not blindfolds or gags.” Steve smiles, hand trailing to trace the seam at Tony’s groin. “Good, anything you’d like especially tonight?”
“Want to see you,” Tony blurts. He seems to think better of it, turning his face away. Steve rubs the outline of Tony’s cock, relishing in how it twitches and hardens. “What do you mean, baby?” Tony’s fingers clench at the leather seats. “Want to be facing you when you take me, want to kiss and touch you. Don’t want doggy style.”
“B-but I want to do things!” Steve smiles, kissing the top of his head. “Then we can do those things. Little steps. Would you like to try something tonight? Or stop?”
Tony’s phone chimes as the board members exit the conference room. He sighs, expecting it to be Pepper.
Steve grasped Tony’s wrists, pinning them to the bed above Tony’s head and pushed in. Tony wailed, muffled by Steve’s mouth on his. So hot, so big and already thrusting inside him. Tony gasped for air against Steve’s mouth, moaning as Steve quickened the pace of his thrusts.
Tony strolls toward Steve’s room in the tower. He’s just moved in, officially, finally having relented to Tony’s constant pestering to give up his place in Brooklyn. Because it’s not charity, Steve, it’s more convenient. And he may just want to have Steve closer.
Steve leans closer as he sets the dishes on the table. He’s teasing, just slightly, but enough to make Tony crave his touch already. Steve points to a pillow at the side of the table. “Kneel.”
Those words always sent him over the edge. Steve declaring his love in French made Tony cry out and spill onto his stomach as Steve followed.
Tony snaps to attention. “Hey Capsicle. Just checking to see how things are going.” Steve frowns at the…table? Tony can’t quite tell what he’s trying to put together. “The Internet said that these Ikea things are good starter furniture.”
They kiss as soon as the door closes. They come together like waves crashing, hands and mouths everywhere. “Tony,” Steve sighs. He’s trying to be firm. He has plans, but Tony’s mouth and tongue on his skin is hard to ignore. “Tony, I want you to kneel for me.” Tony stops his onslaught. He swallows and nods. “By the bed, please.” Tony goes, kicking off his shoes and shedding his jacket to kneel more comfortably. Steve didn’t ask him to, and he finds he likes the way that Tony’s making the rules. He’s not challenging, just taking the freedom Steve is giving him. “Hands behind your back.“
Tony opens his mouth, waiting. Steve runs the head along his lips, hissing as he finally slips into Tony’s awaiting mouth. Tony runs his tongue along the head, prodding at the slit. Steve, as usual, will start slow. He thrusts shallow and slow, letting Tony’s throat acclimate to the thick weight of Steve’s dick.
“Are you hungry, baby?” Tony flushes at the nickname. “Yes, Sir.” Steve breaks off a piece of toast and holds it to Tony’s lips. Tony takes it into his mouth, humming at the taste. Steve continues to feed him, sometimes giving him a chance to drink some coffee or water.
They’ve been dating for a few months by the time Tony invites Steve up to his place. Tony’s hands shake as he turns the key. There are lubes and condom in his dresser drawer, the product of his research. He should have everything they need.
“Where are we?” Tony asks as Steve pulls out of the gas station. “We’re almost there,” Steve answers. Tony watches the greenery pass by until Steve makes a turn onto a small dirt road. He leans forward in his seat and catches glimpse of a secluded cabin.
Tony smiles up at his boyfriend. He’s had a lot of firsts in the past few days. He’s glad they’ve all been with Steve.
The subs being drawn may be in the thrall of subspace. Their expressions convey complete trust, adoration, openness, even love. Tony steps closer. They all look so happy. Some have marks. One has a hand on their cheek, cupping their face. How can they be so happy? How is it that they get to live and enjoy being a sub? While he-
“I have work,” Steve says finally. Tony sits up. “Work! Yeah, of course you do! I’m sorry I didn’t mean to keep you!” Tony scurries out of Steve’s lap. Steve sighs, standing up slowly. “Don’t worry. I still have time. It’s just a longer commute to Brooklyn from here. Gotta catch the train.”
“Not like it wasn’t amazing,” Tony says with a laugh. Steve chuckles too and kisses Tony’s forehead. “Want to take a bubble bath?” Tony laughs softly. “Knew you were gonna ask. Candles?”
Pepper answers questions about SI, giving Tony the chance to slip away from the cameras and the artists silently begging him to buy their work, help propel them into the spotlight. So far, he’s not really impressed.
They were not going back on the Quinjet with the team. They were not going to debrief with Fury back at SHIELD. No no no.
“S-Steve,” Tony chokes out. Happy lets him pass, and Steve rushes to him. “Hey. Tony, Tony, listen. It’s me, it’s Steve. Can you look at me?” Tony’s eyes won’t focus like they’re supposed to, but he manages to look at Steve. Steve gives him a watery smile. “That’s good. Good job, Tony. It’ll be okay. Can you hear me? I need you to breathe with me. Can you do that?”
The air is a little chilly, but the thrill of Steve’s orders is quickly warming him up. He pads across the wooden floors of the hallway into the kitchen. Steve has whipped up some pasta and a light salad. He’s still fully clothed and Tony feels the warm sensation of embarrassment and excitement curl in his stomach.
“You know, Tony, we’re in Paris. Maybe we should take a vacation… It will give me the opportunity to speak French as much as possible. You’d be hard all day, on the lookout of the Eiffel Tower, when I ordered our lunch… then I’d take you back to our hotel and fuck you? Aimerais-tu cela?”
“Anything,” Steve says, leaning down to kiss the top of Tony’s head. “I want us to be alone. And I want to go under.” Steve looks down at his lover. He caresses Tony’s cheek and smiles gently. It’s been a while since they’ve done it, and really that’s the only thing that Tony wants. “Sure, baby. I’ll make some preparations.”
When the couple disembarked, they were on each other again. Unfortunately, the elevator was fast enough to prevent any real action. They fast-walked to their room, laughing and hushing each other softly.
Texting back, he replies, “Sorry. Can’t tonight.” He hits send, hating the clench in his gut. His phone buzzes. “Aw that’s too bad :( Another time?” Tony shoves his phone into his pocket. He can’t bear to reply.
Steve, clever bastard that he is, figured it out eventually. They were alone, cuddling on the couch and watching a movie, which just so happened to have French. During the confession scene, Steve turned to Tony. “Love confessions sound so much more beautiful in French, don’t they?”
“No one’s ever touched you like this?” He takes Tony’s cock into his hands. Tony gasps, his back arching slightly.
“As much fun as tonight was, I’d like to take you out on a proper date.” Tony sits up quickly. “You’re joking.”
They’ve been dating for a few weeks now. Tony has to repeat that to himself every now and then. He has to ask JARVIS and make sure he’s awake, not living in some fantasy world where he can take Steve on dates, hold his hand, call him dear and sweetheart and beloved.
Steve’s warm, big hands begin to wash Tony’s hair. He massages the shampoo in, taking his time and making sure to be gentle. Tony tilts his head back to let the bubbles rinse off.
Tony tried to hide the blush creeping to his face with a big gulp of coffee. He ended up choking, nearly burning his mouth on the scalding liquid. Steve raised an eyebrow at him, and Tony scampered away, mumbling excuses.
Tony nods, nestling between Steve’s powerful thighs. He takes Steve’s cock in one hand, gasping when Steve hisses out a moan. He leans forward to give the head a tentative lick. Steve moans again, a little louder this time. It encourages Tony, who leans forward to lap at the head and take it into his mouth. He’s never given a blowjob before, but Steve tastes amazing. His scent is a little musky and the weight of his dick on Tony’s tongue feels heavenly.
Steve fumbled for the key card and Tony took his chance. Wrapping his arms around Steve’s waist, he began to rub at Steve’s erection through his pants. Steve’s breath hitched slightly and his hands trembled as he struggled with the door. Throwing open the door, he dragged Tony inside.
Steve Rogers is a good boy. He’ll make a good Dom to someone someday. He may get into fights every now and then, but he’s not a bully. He has a big heart and the best intentions. Sarah Rogers knows this. She worries about him, because his asthma can get pretty bad and he never really did grow big like his father. He got his father’s stubbornness though… which is why she knows better than to argue with her son when he starts changing his appearance.
They drift to sleep, wrapped up in each other’s embrace. Tony’s last thought before sleep takes him is how much he loves Steve.
Finally, finally Steve tells him to relax. His body aches pleasantly, so he stretches. Steve is on him in a second, pressing their bodies together. Tony moans into Steve’s mouth, opening his mouth for Steve’s tongue. “You were so good for me, Tony. I know that was hard.”
“Bedroom, please…I’ve wanted you for so long…” Tony flushes, stiffly walking to the bedroom, leading Steve by the hand. The bedroom door shuts behind them, and Steve is on him again, kissing and licking into Tony’s mouth. Tony moans softly, clinging to Steve’s shirt.
Tony remembered that one. Naughty. His retort was lost as Steve leaned down to bite and suck Tony’s nipples. “Please, please Steve,” Tony begged, yanking at his shirt. Steve wrenched off their clothes, throwing them behind him. “Tu veux que je te baise?”
Tony trembles as Steve pushes in. They’re both trembling, both overwhelmed for a moment. “Fuck, fuck, Tony, can I move? God, you’re so tight. So sweet. Wanna fuck you.”
“OK, baby. I’m going to get up and take off my pants. Is that ok?” Tony nods and Steve laughs softly at his eager expression. Steve’s not hard anymore, after seeing Tony cry, which makes it easier to tug off his pants and boxers in one quick tug.
Steve pets his hair, pushing the sweaty strands out of his eyes. “You were perfect. I’m going to get us some water and a washcloth. Okay?” Tony nods, a goofy smile on his face. Steve is so good. Takes good care of him.
Steve shifts behind Tony, grumbling sleepily. Tony gasps as Steve’s morning wood presses into his backside. Steve noses at Tony’s neck.
Steve smiles and runs his hand up Tony’s thigh. “Tony…” he coos. Tony turns back to him, eyes dropping to Steve’s roving hand. “Weren’t we in the middle of something?” As Steve’s hand begins to rub at the front of Tony’s pants, Tony definitely remembers what they were doing before they were so rudely interrupted by the chair.
“Oh yeah? Then why has it taken you all day to put together a…desk?” Steve laughs, the sound sweet in his ear. “It’s a chair.”
Steve steps closer, letting the towel fall to the floor. Tony’s arms open automatically to let Steve embrace him. Steve kisses Tony’s neck, then licks a drop of water from his heated skin. Tony shudders.
Tony hisses, his whole body tensing suddenly. Steve stares at him, then his whole face closes off. He folds his arms over his chest. “I’m sorry? Are you embarrassed to be with me? Is the great Tony Stark too good for a skinny Dom with tats?” His voice is a little too loud for Tony’s taste. He hushes Steve, grabbing his arm. “Please! Keep your voice down! It’s not like that!”
Steve licks his lips as he sits up. “You’re mine,” Steve growls. He straddles Tony, his hard cock jutting out. Steve wraps a hand around his own cock, stroking fast and hard.
“I want to fuck your face,” Steve rasps. Tony gasps, nodding fervently. Steve bolts up, nearly tearing off his clothes. Normally, Tony would want to touch and undress Steve himself, but they haven’t done this in a long time and Tony can’t help himself as he pulls Steve toward his face.
Steve had insisted on a burger from a mom and pop diner he’d found while on a run one day. For some reason, $15 burgers seemed “overpriced.”
After Afghanistan, Tony usually spends his birthday in the lab. Pepper and Rhodey may drag him up for an intimate meal, maybe a small gift. When they’re too busy for that, they give him a call, which he always answers. But that’s really all he needs. It’s never been about him anyway.
“I’d like you to be naked this weekend, unless we go out of course. So take your clothes off. If you get cold, I have a blanket for you. I’m going to get started on dinner. You slept the whole ride here and you need to eat. When you’re done, come join me in the kitchen.”
Steve stands up, the concern evident on his face. “Tony, Tony it’s okay.” His hand is warm on Tony’s shoulder. “Breathe, breathe baby.” Tony blinks back tears. He didn’t realize his anxiety was acting up. He takes several shaky breaths.
“Well, I couldn’t not get you a birthday present.” Tony stares at his boyfriend incredulously. He doesn’t fight the smile. “Thank you.” Steve grins back at him and parks the car.
He nods, curling into Steve’s arms. “It’s alright. You’re alright. I’m here.” Steve looks to Pepper. “Do you know him?” Pepper nods, mouth still agape. “Let’s get him home.” Pepper helps Steve pick him up while Happy clears a path.
He shakes hands, smiles for photos, tries to be sincere about some of the strange pieces of “art” hanging on the walls or scattered about the small Brooklyn space. He nearly steps on a cascade of doll heads that have been laid out as part of some creepy sculpture.
Tony is numb. His reputation is ruined. He lets himself get moved to the car. Steve sits in the back with him and holds him while he cries.
“Go inside and get your bearings. I’ll bring in the bags.” Tony nods, taking the key Steve offers, and steps into the cabin.
Tony walks back into his bedroom. He turns around and Steve is standing with a towel wrapped low on his hips. Water drips down his chiseled chest and abs. Absentmindedly, Tony licks his lips.
“Not yet, Tony. Don’t want you to come until I’m inside you.” Tony moans, ankles crossing as he writhes. “Do you need the ring?” Tony nods. He won’t be able to hold back otherwise.
Steve dresses, pulling on his platform shoes and throwing his leather jacket over his shoulder. He leaves his number on the kitchen counter, scrawled onto the newspaper with an ink drawing of Tony’s face.
Tony sits. Steve praises him, like he did last night. He shouldn’t need aftercare. It wasn’t really even a scene. And yet, Steve is petting his hair and praising him, peppering little kisses on his shoulder and neck.
Before he knows it, they’re in front of his building. “Good night, Tony,” Steve says, squeezing Tony’s hand. “G-good night, Steve.” Tony waits for a moment, but when Steve doesn’t say anything, he begins to pull away. “Tony, wait!” Steve looks so earnest and a little nervous. “May I…kiss you?” Tony flushes and nods, stepping toward him.
Eventually, Tony’s conscious sneaks back in. He turns over as he blinks blearily, nuzzling into Steve’s chest. “Mmmm…hello.”
Steve recovers slowly, reaching down to pull Tony upward. Tony straddles Steve’s hips and Steve reaches for Tony’s cock. “May I?” Tony whines softly. “Yes.” Steve grasps Tony’s cock firmly, stroking slowly at first to let Tony adjust. No one has ever touched him there before. “Look at you… so hard from sucking my cock…you’re so perfect, Tony.”
No, of course not. These people didn’t mean anything to him. They weren’t his friends. Especially not their boss.
He sighed again, staring at the alley in front of him. It was his usual spot, behind a closed down factory. It came with the added convenience of the still working furnace. It was an easy disposal of the body once he was done.
And suddenly it was like a spell was broken because Steve made a broken noise before, much to Tony’s amusement, climbing onto the bed with him. Laying a thigh carefully on each side of Tony, Steve leaned over the brunette, shaking hands clasping his face like a treasure. “Tony,” was all Steve managed to get out again before he descended, lips colliding against Tony’s. It was so sweet, soft even, but Tony could feel the desperation barely hiding behind each kiss.
Pepper dug her fingernails into the side of his neck. “You are walking a very thin line, mister, so you better watch it.”
And it needs to be dealt with.” The Captain pushed Tony away, the metal chair he was tied to rocking unsteadily from the force.
“You want to know why he’s so good?” Clint nearly shouted.  “It’s because he’s on the good side of over half the mobs in Manhattan. You’re playing with fire, Steve. He’s too dangerous.”
A sheen of sweat had covered Clint when he reached what was left of Tony’s floor. The door had already been blown off its hinges, but there was wreckage everywhere. The last thing Clint wanted to do was to step on something to shift the rubble to much that could end badly for both him and Tony.
Clint thought. The Avengers were used to dealing with aliens and gods seeking world domination. Now they had an insane cult of regular humans trying to drag them through hell and to their annihilation.
Bucky swallowed his own tears because nodding sullenly, finally walking out the door. He barely had it shut before Clit’s sobs started to echo through the hallway.
Steve sighed in defeat, looking at where Clint was sitting quietly at the bar, cleaning his gun. It wasn’t as if this wasn’t the plan – Steve knew that he had to tell Clint as soon as possible – but it didn’t make it any less hard.
Obie just waved him off. “Anything for you, my boy. Now, you know how this works. The board it going to be pretty pissed, but I’m sure they’ll forget it ever happened if you come in with a shiny new toy for them to play with.”
Steve obliged, swinging the door open, breath immediately getting caught in his throat. Past the wooden entryway was a surprisingly spacious room, walls adorned it a rich blue, accented by bright scones. A large desk, probably mahogany knowing Tony, lay facing the pair, lush chair sitting behind it. A personal bar sat atop plush rugs, nestled nicely between a long couch and matching armchair. The wall along the left side was left oddly bare, while the back was consisted of one giant bookshelf, the wall to Steve’s right made entirely out of glass.
“Awesome,” Tony grinned. He stepped back and wiped down his flight suit, as if this was a completely normal situation that definitely shouldn’t be raising Steve’s blood pressure.
Steve followed his lead, standing up. “I’ll, uh, see you tomorrow I guess.” Steve watched as Tony sauntered up the stairs before heading back outside, shield tight in his grip as he started his vigil.
Steve’s blood froze over. They knew it wasn’t his real name. “You think anyone’s falling for that parlor trick anymore? The name that Tony Stark released to the public doesn’t mean anything when you are still allies with the man.”
tried. They all had. Steve was on a slippery slope, and they all tried to pull him back to safety. But did he listen? Of course not. He thought that he was helping, that he was protecting them. And look what happened to him. Look what happened to them. If Bucky had looked that haunted, there was no doubt in his mind that the rest of his family was carrying the same weight.
“Ah,” Tony responded. “Yeah, you might have missed a few things when you were doing time as a Capsicle.”
Avengers HQ housed many floors of labs, but this one, upon a certain billionaire’s insistence, was specifically made for Tony and Bruce. It was an extension of the one back at the Tower; anything they found on missions or anything they couldn’t fit back at home was brought to this lab. Basically, it ended up being a stash pile for all the things that Steve classified as ‘too dangerous’ to bring into the Tower. Which, on principal, was pretty hilarious considering the people occupying the building were some of the most dangerous in the world.
“Tony? Tony!” Pepper is holding him, shouting for an ambulance. She glares at Steve, keeping Happy from him. “It’s a panic attack!” Steve’s voice insists. “Please, let me help!”
“You’re beautiful,” Steve whispers, licking the shell of Tony’s ear. Tony shivers, pressing his back into Steve’s chest. “You did so well for me, Tony. Would you like a reward?” Tony swallows. He wants to nod, but he doesn’t want to be selfish, doesn’t want to ask for it.
Tony lets Steve lay him back on the bed. He feels exposed, laid out before Steve in the light. “You’re beautiful,” Steve whispers. He says it reverently, like Tony is a piece of art.
“Please, please.” He’s clawing at Steve’s shoulder blades, hanging on for dear life. Steve yanks the ring off and practically roars as he fills Tony, coming hard. Tony’s orgasm hits him like a freight train, slamming into him and shutting off everything but the feeling of his orgasm and Steve’s spurting inside him.
Tony keens, whining as Steve pushes the first lubed finger inside him. “Fuck. You open so nice for me. Does that feel good?” Tony nods, spreading his legs. “Wanna draw you like this, ‘cept maybe with a plug inside you.” Tony is gasping as Tony fucks him. His fingers are slender so he adds another. Tony bites his lip. “Talk to me, baby. Tell me what you want. You can speak.” The admission seems to open a floodgate. Tony babbles, moaning for more and harder and please. Steve wants to hear him scream.
Steve smirks, touching Tony’s arm, pushing the sleeve of Tony’s suit up to touch bare skin. “That depends.”
“Mmm…morning Tony,” Steve mumbles into Tony’s skin. His breath tickles, making Tony squirm. Steve’s breath hitches when Tony inadvertently presses back into Steve’s erection.
On the day of Tony’s birthday, Steve wakes Tony. He’s already dressed and there are some suitcases already packed. “We’re going for a drive,” Steve tells him with a good morning kiss.
“Does it matter?” Tony asks. Steve’s body is incredible. He’s firm and warm, and Tony loves being pressed against it. Feeling devious, Tony grinds down against Steve’s lap.
He wakes to the smell of hot coffee. Steve presses a warm cup into his hands and kisses his cheek. Tony makes a pleased hum and sips the coffee. Blinking blearily, he looks around. There are trees everywhere, the skyscrapers of Manhattan long gone.
“Tony?” Tony looks up from his place at the table, where Steve had told him to sit. “What?” Steve chuckles. “Would you like me to feed you?” Tony’s eyes widen. He sputters for a second, scrambling for an answer. No one had ever… ever wanted, ever asked Tony to partake in domestic submission.
The car starts moving and Steve can tell they’re going to Manhattan. Tony looks to him every so often, nerves obvious in his eyes. He’s babbling a little, talking about his apartment, making sure it isn’t too far from home for him. Steve looks out the window, but lets his hand wander to Tony’s thigh. Tony sighs in relief, quieting down a little at the contact. Steve squeezes Tony’s thigh, glancing to smile at him. “Why don’t you tell me about what you like?” Steve prompts. It’s not quite an order, but they need to discuss it before they start anything.
“Sir! Oh please, Sir!” Steve lets up on Tony’s cock, but drives his fingers deep. Tony is moaning loud. There’s no one here to hear them, to judge. He lets it all go. “Fuck, ah! S-Sir! Please, fuck me!” He’s babbling. He has no control over the words falling from his lips. It’s a litany of “please” and “fuck me” and “Sir.”
He breathes through his nose and opens his throat. Steve grips the headboard, taking more. “God I missed your mouth. You were made for this, baby. Made to suck my cock. You love it don’t you?” Tony can’t respond through the deep thrusts, but he moans around Steve’s cock.
Tony was thrown onto the bed, then pounced on. Perched above with a predatory look in his eyes, Steve ripped open Tony’s shirt, sending button flying across the room. Tony gasped, delighted that finally, finally Steve was just as impatient as him. “Tu es très coquin,” Steve told him.
“Th-thought you’d leave…” Steve frowns. “No, Tony. Never. I’m so sorry, Tony. I didn’t know…” Tony’s tears subside and he sniffles. “I’m s-sorry. I wanted to… but I got so nervous and-” Steve hushes him softly. “Tony, we don’t have to do anything you’re not ready for.”
Steve was at the front desk already, speaking French to the clerk who handed him a room key with a smile. Tony marched over, catching the end of their conversation. He tugged at Steve’s shirt, pleading with his eyes. Steve said something to polite, grabbed Tony’s hand, and the two practically ran to the elevator.
Steve takes a sharp intake of breath, eyes roving over Tony’s naked body. His cock starts to fill with blood and Tony sits up. On his knees on the bed, he reaches for Steve, who closes the gap. They kiss, bodies hot as they press together, naked skin on naked skin. Tony gasps into Steve’s mouth as their erections brush against each other.
There was polite applause and Steve stood, followed by the rest of the team. They looked tired from the battle, relieved to be done with this. All except Steve, that is. Steve turned his head to give Tony his most devious smirk, then led the team out of the room.
Tony holds back a soft gasp. Steve knows this will be difficult for him- Tony’s never really been able to sit still. “If you’d like, I can tie you.” Tony’s heart leaps. He loves the way that Steve ties him, binds him in intricate ropes and patterns. Not now though. He shakes his head. He wants to try his hardest for his Dom.
“Do you…want to go on a date…with me?” Tony looked up from the gadget he was fiddling with. “What?” Steve’s ears turned pink. “Do you want to go out with me?” he repeat, the words spilling out quickly. “I know there are probably plenty of other people asking you out, but-”
“OK so this…goes here and that goes…yes…yes!” With a maniacal laugh, Tony reaches for an allen wrench. It’s just out of his reach, so Steve moves to hand it to him. Tony turns to ask, mind focused on his work. He comes face-to-face with Steve, so close their lips brush.
Suddenly, Steve grabs the bonds on Tony’s wrists and throws Tony’s arms around his neck. He pulls Tony into his lap, shifting so Steve’s legs are over the edge of the bed. He uses the floor to thrust into Tony. Tony thinks he’s screaming, but he can’t think about anything but how Steve is perfectly hitting his prostate.
Which is why it was completely and utterly Steve’s fault that he couldn’t sit still during their press conference. After they responded to an attack on Paris by Dr. Doom, SHIELD sent them to hold a press conference with the French media.
“Green,” Tony gasps out. With a nod, Steve starts moving. Tony moans. The friction is heaven, Steve filling him so perfectly. He loses himself in the feeling of Steve’s mouth, his cock, his rough hands.
“Yes, Sir,” Tony croaks out. The word sends a shudder down Steve’s spine. “Good boy. Where are they?” Tony points to a trunk in the corner of the room. Steve opens it; it’s full of toys and supplies. His eyes wander over vibrators and plenty of toys that Steve will make sure he tries on Tony later. Right now, he wants restraints and to show Tony what he can do on his own.
“Is it the tongue ring?” Tony laughs. “Oh my God, no. I’m just…it’s a lot to deal with.” Steve leans over to steal a kiss. “I think you’re worth it.”
Wandering at the edges of the gallery, Tony stops in front of one collection in particular. It’s a series of sketches- so simple, just plain charcoal- and yet Tony can’t take his eyes off of them. They’re subs, but they’re not drawn like most subs are. These aren’t the dirty pictures or the images of subs Tony sees on magazines, in movies. These are men and women, who may be submitting, but it isn’t sexual.
“I have a car outside,” Tony blurts. Steve grins. He’s so eager. Steve is really going to enjoy taking him apart. “Then let’s go.” He grabs Tony’s hand and leads him out of the bar. Apparently by car, Tony meant chauffeured car. Steve is honestly a little surprised, but he climbs into the car after Tony.
“Then go ahead. If you want to wait, just tell him. If he’s willing to wait, then you know you’ve picked the right guy.” Tony bites his lip. “And if he doesn’t want to wait?”
Steve smiles into the kiss, wrapping his arms around Tony’s waist. He opens his mouth, tongue proding at Tony’s mouth. Tony opens his mouth a little unsurely. Then Steve’s tongue is in his mouth and his brain feels like mush. Steve’s tongue thrusts in and out of his mouth, hot and nimble. Tony whimpers softly into the kiss, body pliant in Steve’s hold.
It’s new for Tony, and it sends sharp jolts of arousal straight to his cock. He tugs at Steve’s shirt, wanting to see. He knows Steve is built. He’s pretty sure Natasha gets him shirts that are too small on purpose. Steve tries to help, but they only get tangled together. By the time Steve’s free, his hair is going in every direction. He chuckles at Tony’s flustered expression.
“A gala opening with Miss Pots, Sir.” Tony hates the sense of relief that washes over him. He likes Steve, but he can’t. Steve is too good for him anyway.
“Coffee’s ready.” Steve steps out of the shower. He grabs a towel and holds it open for Tony. Tony turns off the water and steps into the towel. Steve wraps him up and kisses him again.
Steve turns around, his eyes darkening at the sight of Tony’s naked body. He licks his lips, letting his eyes roam freely. Tony fidgets, but doesn’t cover up. Steve doesn’t like it. Steve steps close, carrying the food. Tony doesn’t move, but shivers as Steve’s fully clothed body nears his. He can feel the heat radiating off his Steve and the difference between them sends shivers down Tony’s spine.
He zones out, lost in the feel of his first orgasm with Steve. He pants softly, looking at Steve. Steve swallows. “Don’t look at me like that. You’ll get me hard again,” he teases. Tony smiles, moving to lay down at Steve’s side. Steve wipes himself off with some tissues, and Tony throws an arm around him. “Will you stay?”
Steve wobbles off of Tony, panting slightly. “God, baby. That was so good.” Tony whimpers softly. He’s feeling floaty, from the lack of air or the buzz of pleasure, he’s not quite sure. Without Steve’s cock in his mouth, the throb of his cock between his legs is suddenly overwhelming. He grips the sheets and whines.
“Mmmm…” Steve takes that for an affirmative answer. Not wanting to leave his sub alone for too long, he darts into the bathroom to grab a towel and a glass of tap water for Tony. He quickly climbs back into Tony’s bed to wipe him off and offer Tony the water.
That won’t do. Not after one of the best night’s he’s ever had. “I’ll have my driver take you home or to work, or wherever.”
Steve’s eyes widen and he comes, splattering Tony’s chest. It’s warm and wet, but Tony doesn’t mind. He’s staring at Steve’s flushed face, eyes shut as he pants.
“Yes,” Tony whined. Steve grabbed the hotel kit from the nightstand, nearly crushing the boxes in his eager grip. He managed to free the lube, liberally coating Tony’s hole and his fingers.
“We’re going to a hotel,” Tony snapped. He shoved Steve into the car, then clambered on top of him, shutting the door. Steve looked over Tony’s shoulder and said, “Conduisez, s’il vous plait.” Tony groaned softly, happy the car began to move.
Steve groans and rubs his head. “What happened?” Tony glances behind them. The damn nightmare of a chair has broken under their weight. Tony sit up with an angry huff.
After setting the dishes in the sink, Steve walks to Tony’s side. “Follow me to the living room,” he tells Tony in that voice that makes Tony’s cock twitch between his legs. He moves to stand. With a firm hand on Tony’s shoulder, Steve stops him, shaking his head. “No standing.”
Tony nods. That’s what he wants. Just feeling Steve inside him isn’t enough. Wants Steve to come inside. “Tony, I need you to answer.”
Tony hadn’t expected him to stay. But he did. Not only that, but he flat out told Tony that he’d like to date him, regardless of the press. Steve then proceeded to get up and make him breakfast- breakfast! Tony couldn’t remember the last time someone made him breakfast. It wasn’t fancy, but there was coffee.
Steve inhales sharply as Tony puts his hands above his head. Suddenly, Steve’s hands are tight around his wrists as he kisses him hard. “God, Tony. You’re so beautiful. Such a perfect sub.” He kisses Tony again and again, grinding his hard cock into Tony’s thigh. “Been hard since I started drawing you. Didn’t want to keep my hands off of you.” He kisses Tony’s neck, sucking dark marks onto the skin. Tony tilts his head back and moans.
Tony tugs on them, to test and to feel the floaty feeling he gets from being at Steve’s mercy. Steve, eager as ever, dives down to suck at Tony’s trembling cock. Tony arches, shouting as Steve slips a finger into him. His thighs tremble as Steve relentlessly licks the head of his cock and quickly adds a second finger.
Curious, Tony touches his chest. He licks the fluid, salty but not bad. Steve’s eyes are open now. He’s staring at Tony, jaw dropped.
A man catches his eye from the corner of the room, seemingly out of place among the piercings, tattoos, leather corsets, and colored hair. He’s wearing a suit that shows off the lines of his body. His goatee is neatly trimmed and he’s wearing sunglasses, sipping from a glass. He’s gorgeous, lithe and Steve’s gut twists with pleasure at the thought of tying him up and ruining that expensive suit.
The next time he heard Steve speak French, they were in the kitchen of the Avengers Tower. Natasha was brushing up on her French and Steve, the ever-so-helpful Captain, was obliging. Tony’s grasp of French was basic; Pepper had always been the master (and it was hot when she spoke too).
“It’s not like what? It’s not like you could be in public with me? Like I could be Dom enough for you?”
He hopes this goes well. What if Steve doesn’t like it? Will it hurt that much? How should he touch Steve?
Steve, as Captain America and leader of the Avengers, was answering questions in a serious tone and a serious expression, so why was Tony so hard? At this point, he wouldn’t be able to stand up without drawing attention in his fitted suit. Tony bit his lip, silently wishing he was still wearing the armor.
They’re alone in the elevator and Steve jumps at the chance. He pins Tony to the elevator wall, kissing him fiercely. He takes Tony’s wrists in his hands, pinning them next to his head.
. Steve bobs slowly, swirling his tongue. Tony moans, hands tangling in Steve’s hair. “Steve,” Tony moans.
Tony smiles so hard his face hurts, and not in the good way. The damn press is everywhere. Wasn’t this supposed to be a small charity event for… children? Disabled veterans? Disabled child veterans?
“Are your eyes blue?” Steve asked and Tony smiled. Tony took his sunglasses off showing his brown eyes for a second before putting them back on.
“He even had my name!” Tony said glaring at the ceiling wishing he could just beat whoever hurt Peter even if he was already dead.
Steve waited for Tony and Ironman at their meeting place. Steve waited and waited... the sun was setting and Steve knew Tony and Ironman weren’t coming. He felt his heart break as he sadly walked back to the tower. He knew they wouldn’t come and yet he still had a little hope that they did and it still broke his heart.
“It’s okay I just came here to tell you breakfast is ready.” Jensen said calmly and Peter nodded getting up and yawning. Jensen left the room and Peter got ready the best he could which wasn’t much just running his hands through his hair to tame it and then went down for breakfast. Peter smelled pancakes and smiled happily.
Peter whimpered getting shocked again and started crying again. Tony found him and the Supernatural cast tried defending him but they couldn’t defeat him.
“Y-yeah. I can feel- that!” Peter Peter struggled as Jensen didn’t stop putting pressure on this one spot that made Peter blush hard.
“Yeah! Tony and I went through hell together! We just met, fighting in a war I didn’t even want to be involved in!” Ironman yelled back. Steve stopped in his tracks and lowered his head feeling guilty.
Peter watched Supernatural keeping up with the show just to see Jensen and Jared again and sometimes Misha and Mark. Peter also advanced his webs enough to 3.0 which was the best he could do with the materials and time he had.
“I’m sorry Pepper but I don’t feel that way and he doesn’t either.” Ironman said confidently and Pepper left. Ironman got in the armor and went directly to Tony following the feeling of their connection.
The stranger took him to an old warehouse tied him up to a chair with ropes. Peter tried not to smile realizing he could easily break the ropes and escape. The stranger took off the sack that was on his head and Peter looked around confused.
“Peter Parker property of Tony Stark.” Peter read out and grimaced throwing the plate to the ground. Peter then realized he could use the plate to try and break the collar so that’s what he did. Peter finally got the collar to unlock and rejoiced quickly taking it off and heading to the vents. Peter crawled through the vents silently as he could making his way out. Peter finally got outside and rejoiced.
“Okay there’s this crazy car parked outside.” Peter said and then looked towards May and saw Tony sitting right beside her and Peter almost panicked backing up slightly.
“No more questions!” Tony said taking over the body and Clint backed up freaked out by the sudden change.
“Like this.” Tony said putting his hands on the helmet and Steve eyes widened significantly. Tony chuckled.
Steve spent more time with Tony after that and the more time he spent with Tony the more he started noticing things. It was little things at first like an unexplained bruise here and a lab accident cut there but as time went on Steve noticed it getting worse especially after difficult missions where Ironman got injured and angry.
“Tony he doesn’t deserve you. You can defend yourself.” Steve said angrily and Tony backed up looking at Steve in confusion.
“Tony...” Steve said but after a tense silence let Tony go and Tony turned away covering his eyes with his hand and running to his lab. Steve huffed frustrated why couldn’t he just open his dame eyes.
“Okay new rule, don’t make Peter angry.” Jensen said and Jared nodded feeling guilty for making Peter mad at him. Alex nodded also a little scared of what would happen if Peter ever did get angry at him.
“Stop trying to shoot me then!” Peter said angrily dodging again. Tony realized he wasn’t going to hit Peter and put the gun down. Peter sighed frustrated and paced again staring Tony down. Tony glared back and then held up a remote.
“I think I was 22 when Tony caught me.” Peter said and Tony looked at him baffled and even more confused.
“Sorry guys I got to go apparently, talk about this later okay!” Tony said to the people he was having a meeting with as he was being dragged away.
“Bruce is an exception.” Tony said flipping some switches and working on something. Peter sighed glad that he didn’t get electrocuted for the question and looked up sadly at Bruce. Bruce froze feeling a wave of sympathy for the kid but looked away refusing to look at him any longer.
“Shut up kid! I should have never brought you on this mission.” Tony said yelling at first but whispering the last part. Peter had unshed tears in his eyes and stomped back next to Robert and stayed behind him and hugged Tom for comfort. Tom hugged back trying to help the broken teenager. Tony scoffed and went through the portal without Peter.
“Where do you think you’re going with my intern!” Tony yelled angrily and Peter shivered as Ironman answered
“He doesn’t deserve this.” Tony said angrily almost to tears too and Ironman looked at Tony worriedly.
“Not really you are a mutant.” Tony said and Peter refused to let himself cry but held his tongue not wanting to be shocked again.
“Well kinda yeah they adopted me into their family and I became a part of it.” Peter said happily remembering all the good times he had with them.
One question he still didn’t get answered though. What about Fisk? Peter tried to get information about his question but came up with nothing. Peter deflated realizing he didn’t have his place in the tunnels yet and Ned and MJ still didn’t know he was Spider-Man. Peter sighed sadly and then remembered there field trip tomorrow so he went to bed.
“This next room is our living room where these idiots like to watch our own show.” Mark said and Peter waved only getting slightly noticed.
“It’s okay I know you could never hurt me.” Peter said smiling and Tony rested his head on Peter’s shoulder.
“The other cast members have been too busy and you know I tried to get Dimitri here but you know how that went.” Mark said angry at all his cast members he used to call family.
“I- I can see in those you know whenever whatever happened happened my senses have been dialed up to 11.” Peter said justifying his design for his suit.
“I’ll be in the lab.” Ironman said coldly and left slamming the door behind him. Tony winced feeling very guilty and very sad. Tony then felt something on his arm.
“The park?” Tony asked confused and then Ironman and Tony both realized that they were supposed to show up. Tony looked at him apologetically as Steve glared at them.
“Well Pepper used to be... well we used to be close and it was common for us to kiss every now and then... but it never went any further!” Tony exclaimed as Ironman put a light pressure on his throat.
“I got to go.” Peter said and May nodded. Peter then rushed to get ready for school and then left heading to his old high school. Peter breathed out happily, walking into the school and looking for his past best friend Ned.
“Bruce Banner?” Peter asked and he looked at him betrayal in his eyes. Not only one but now two of the people he used to look up too had him caged and were going to experiment on him.
“Where is Peter.” He heard Steve demand and Peter took this chance to call out for help sure Steve would save him.
“Almost!” Ironman said trying to quickly get in the armor having put the helmet on first to make his voice distorted.
“So how are you?” Tony said trying to stay calm he accidentally left his sunglasses in his lab he didn’t think it would matter because it was 3:00 am. Tony closed his eyes when he saw Steve about to turn and look at him.
“Calm down Peter I just came to get you out.” Ironman said admitting defeat and unlocking the collar and slowly taking it off of Peter. Peter looked at Ironman confused and in relief.
“Ya know if you ever get claustrophobic we can switch places.” Ironman said after a while of silence just the sounds of Tony working filling the room.
“Can I have an x-ray please I think I swallowed something I shouldn’t have.” Peter said and they rushed him to the x-Ray and then showed him X-ray.
“You know I’m here for you, you don’t have to protect him.” Steve said and Tony backed away in surprise.
“Guys it’s me I’m really here!” Peter said but Jensen and Jared didn’t seem to hear him. Peter felt a hand brush against his throat and Peter shivered falling to one knee.
“I said stop... tin can.” Peter said super scared but glared at Tony. Tony bit him in the neck again this time drawing blood and Peter yelled out in pain. Peter tried to pry Tony off but Tony’s grip was tight and Peter realized Tony wasn’t going to let go.
“Spider-Man.” Peter corrected him and closed his eyes just waiting for Tony to strangle him or something. He opened his eyes after a few seconds hesitantly and saw Tony looking him at confused.
“I already have some designs I wanted to eventually make.” Peter said getting out his notebook and handed it to Tony letting him see all his designs.
Tony was in the armor again. The armor made Tony feel safer and the Avengers liked it when he was Ironman.
“Tony I messed up real bad I accidentally kicked Ironman off the team!” Steve said and Tony tilted his head confused.
“I’ll tell him.” Ironman said hugging Tony and then sighed telling Steve the tale of how they became Tony and Ironman.
Misha paused seeing Peter’s collar on the table. Misha sighed sadly and picked up the collar and Peter backed up not prepared for the sudden pressure on his neck. Misha took the collar, bringing it somewhere and Peter had no choice but to follow. Misha went in this building and Peter followed.
“I forgive you.” Peter said withering in pain mixed with pleasure as Misha ran his hands along the inside of the collar again, oblivious of what he was doing to Peter. Peter blushed embarrassed and covered his face with his hands.
“We will save you Peter we will find a way to save you.” He heard him say then Peter passed out again.
“April fools.” Tony said smiling smugly and Clint walked out of the room pissed. Tony laughed and Steve did too.
“What about Bruce? Isn’t he a mutant?” Peter asked bravely and Bruce tensed feeling bad for the kid.
Tony sighed relived that he remembered to wear his flame proof suit on. Tony wiped away his tears again trying to stop crying the pain getting too much for him. Tony calmed down enough that his eyes weren’t burning anymore and he sighed relieved.
Peter looked at the time again and just started getting ready to go to school with his signed permission slip. Peter got to school and greeted Ned happily trying to forget everything they have been through in his past life.
“Now Stay still or you will be paralyzed again.” Tony said darkly and Peter whimpered. Tony walked around Peter and then went down to his level unbuttoning Peter’s shirt and taking it off him. Peter tried moving his limbs but Tony had him pinned onto the ground. Tony then cuffed Peter’s hands behind his back. “Just a precaution.” Tony said taking off his own shirt the glow of the arc reactor filling the room.
“Ironman I-I don’t think you need to h-hold me.” Tony said stuttering embarrassed as they passed by the kitchen and living room the Avengers looking at them weirdly.
“Thinking of escaping? I hope not.” Tony said and Peter glared at the ground angrily. Tony put the remote in a pocket in his suit and Peter silently cursed in his head. He wasn’t ever going to get that stupid remote from Tony.
“I’m going to take this collar off but don’t you dare try to escape.” Tony threatened and Peter nodded scared of Tony. Tony shocked Peter one last time before taking the collar off slowly. Peter shivered and then Tony grabbed him by his throat and shoved him into the shower. Peter shivered under the cold water and then Tony came in the shower also naked.
“Leave Ironman alone! No more questioning who he is!” Tony said and they all nodded and Tony was quick to leave only letting himself smile, feeling Ironman’s happiness, when he knew he was out of view.
“keep this from crushing you.” Tony said and flipped a switch as the device slowly started approaching Peter. Peter realized he didn’t have a choice in the matter and accepted the weight holding it up. Peter didn’t struggle for a while that is until Tony flipped a switch and the weight became much heavier.
“Nice to meet you too.” Robert said smiling welcoming Peter and bringing his arm forward to hug him. Peter froze then hugged back happily and Tom from behind stuck his tongue out at Peter. Peter laughed and broke the hug.
“It’s okay kid, just stay down don’t scare me like that.” Tony said and then went after the jet. Peter sighed and stayed down as Tony instructed too tired and injured to do anything else.
“Do it.” He heard Mark say and then the machine flat lining. Peter felt himself leave his body and he watched as Mark cried harder sobbing into Peter’s body. Peter’s spirit stood behind Mark and watched as he mourned and Peter cried too.
“It’s okay you’re safe now it was just a nightmare.” Jensen said and Peter calmed down looking at his surroundings and feeling around his throat sighing in relief that he didn’t have that stupid collar on.
“I- he put a shock collar on me, I couldn’t get it off... He beat me, I couldn’t fight him... he shocked me so many times. He wouldn’t get off me.” Peter said crying again and Jensen sighed sadly
“So I heard you’re a run away.” Mark said coming into the room as Jared and Misha left and Peter nodded getting nervous.
“Also don’t shock me to hard.” Peter said getting the broken collar on and Tony looked at him horrified.
“It’s okay Mark I understand.” Peter said and put his a comforting hand on Mark’s shoulder but knew he couldn’t feel it.
“You keep glaring at me like that and.” Tony said holding up the remote and Peter looked away quickly not wanting to be shocked anymore.
He spun suddenly, ignoring the searing pain from his arm, to face Barnes, who was sitting comfortably bin a chair crammed in the far corner. Tony let himself sidle back down to the couch, the apparent
Tony stared at him blankly. “I’m sorry,” he laughed. “Mr. Boy Scout himself wants to blow our duty off for a night on the town?”
“Steve?” came Tony’s timid voice. The smaller man reached out slowly, hand brushing against Steve’s shoulder.
“No,” Hill replied. “Keep to the windows for now, watch for any runners. I’ll signal if anything changes.”
Phil just shrugged. “Not like I haven’t seen Clint look any better,” he said with a small smile. But Steve could see the small cracks in it, the slight tugging of the lips more a grim line than a smile at all, really.
Tony thought to himself. Seriously, who would have thought that the mob man would have been this wholesome? It was sickening. Tony wasn’t really tracking their conversations, but he did hear a few questionable murmurs, most likely due to his presence. He wasn’t sure how long he sat there, but soon his flanks were warmed by the appearance of other bodies, everyone trying to squeeze into the same room.
It had been three days since Tony had last met with The Captain in his overcrowded Brooklyn hideout. They had both agreed that the best way to find their mystery HYDRA man out of hiding was by drawing him out; orchestrating another ‘meeting’ between the two of them seemed like their best option. Of course, this time, The Captain brought his lackeys; The Commandos hiding within the shadows of the alleyways, waiting for action.
Secondly, I'm slowly going back through the story, doing some editing. Nothing major is changing, just some grammar errors I find, maybe a sentence restructure here and there. Nothing from the story line is being disrupted, it's just me trying to clean up my word vomit. With each chapter, I'll also be reading over the comments as well, going over old feedback. The story still has a way to go, and I'm still always on the look out for what you guys think the story still needs. I'm also going to be putting in a better effort to answer comments, because I've already stumbled on some instances where I haven't been answering some questions/thoughts you guys are having that I should have. (AKA, I'm gonna be less of an ass). So definitely keep the feedback coming! Know that I read it, and I love every bit of it.
Steve almost wished he could go back in time, to stop in then; to stop anything from happening. But how could he have known? He should have.
Stark huffed, but Steve ignored it, moving over towards Clint and Bucky. Another pang of guilt swept through him; Steve had spent all that time trying to get Stark in the building, he had all but forgotten about Clint’s injury. Steve’s hands joined Bucky against Clint’s would, his blue eyes darting all over Clint’s face, taking in his friend’s pained state.
“Sometimes I think it would have been easier if I was never with him, you know? If Fury didn’t let me go to him. Having him here, now, just for him to leave? Doesn’t seem worth it.”
The doors swung open revealing a spacious common floor, complete with the full treatment. Long couches adorned the room, lying on top of an expensive rug. The modern kitchen to the left was fully stocked, not just with food, but with machines Steve had never even seen before.  Along the back wall were floor to ceiling windows, giving Steve a wide view of Manhattan. A view he didn’t recognize.
“We’ve hit a small snag, however,” said Fury. “Our main suspect is a wily one. We can’t find him. He must have known we were on to him, so he flew the coop.”
“Don’t be ridiculous. Johnny Cash on the other hand,” Steve started with a grin, but Stark wasn’t listening anymore, already pestering Bruce.
Everyone else who had gathered downstairs turned in surprise, no doubt shocked that Steve was back with the land of the living. While Steve felt a small pang of guilt rush through him, he didn’t stop his path to the door. Tony hadn’t been reported as missing yet. How much time had they lost because the police didn’t even realize he was gone?
Natasha rolled here eyes, but obliged, leaning back in her chair to where she was filing her nails with a knife tip. “Baby,” she whispered under her breath.
But apparently what it would bring was fuck-all. Which seemed to bug Steve more than any of the other empty-bed mornings. Sure, Steve knew that Tony was a workaholic and when he says, “
“It is quite unfortunate that Mr. Stark managed to escape, but you’ll do just fine.” With that, the fireman pulled out two pistols from under his uniform and aimed them at Steve.
A bright screen flashed in front of him, showing Tony pull out from behind a building, and continue off through Brooklyn. "I remember this," Tony mumbled to himself. "The building I came out of wasn't that much farther back." Tony studied the clips before an idea hit him. "J, can you rewind a couple hours? When we first got there?"
Tony opened his mouth to reply, no doubt another scathing comment, but the argument was broken by a high-pitched whine cutting across the air, the Iron Man suit touch landing right behind Tony, opening automatically.
“Of course not,” Tony stated with a roll of his eyes. “But, we’ll worry about that later. We’re not leaving until tomorrow, though. Travelling can be such a pain in the ass, and you just got here.”
Bucky frowned, pulling into the back alley behind the speakeasy, slipping into a parking spot. Stark had hopped out before the be had put the car in park, Bucky unable to do anything besides trail behind him.
“Come on, cowboy,” Tony husked when he broke away, pushing Steve’s head downwards. “You were late to dinner, so you’ve got a lot of making up to do.”
“It was the right call and you know it,” Bucky tried to placate. He wasn't sure if he was saying it to convince Clint or himself. He'd spent the last few days not much better than Clint, running through Phil's shooting in his head over and over again.
“Thank you for helping me and my mommy.” She pecked Bruce’s cheek sweetly before plopping back down to the ground.
Tony closed his eyes, imagining he was cutting through the air, gliding by building after building as he flew without a care in the world.
In response to that, I think I will be tacking on the other villain and pushing on with the story. But, addressing some certain concerns, this villain won't be around until at least two of the current ones are taken care of. I don't want the story to be so all over the place that no one has any idea who they're fighting anymore.
his mind whispered. Steve shook his head, rubbing his fingers against his eyes. He wouldn’t let himself think like that. Tony was way more valuable alive. From a business standpoint, Tony Stark could open doors for any mob. It was what Steve himself had told himself when he snatched Tony off the street for their first ever meeting.
“To be fair, it was startlingly easy,” Tony said with a shrug. “What kind of criminal are you? You should be ashamed of yourself.”
Tony scrambled for his phone; he had completely forgotten about the search he sent JARVIS on. Quickly connecting to JARVIS, he asked, “What do you got for me, J?”
“Please! I can’t deal with that on top of all of this. Tony getting involved in all of this could get him into trouble. I mean, I can barely protect him now! I just- I can’t lose him. Not now.”
Steve saw Hammer gulp. “You know, you should listen to your friend,” he said. “You aren’t in the right mindset.”
“Don’t bother, I’ve already tried that. For me to sleep comfortably through the night, I need the room in like the mid-50s, but I can’t do that to the two of you! It would be like living in an icebox, which you’ve both already done the time for!”
One month since the explosion. One month since Stark left. One month since Clint saw Phil in person. One month since he heard Bucky laugh. One month since he saw Steve smile.
Bucky forced the other man to meet his eyes. “Why the hell would you help us,” he whispered. “You’ve got every right to run off into the sunset after all the crap we’ve put you through.”
Steve clenched his jaw. "How the hell did you get in here?" He asked, tightening his grip on his gun.
“The only thing you are is obsolete,” replied Stane, heading back to the door. “Good day, Chief.” And with that, he slammed the door behind him.
Delmar was about to grab the gun when his door was pried open, and he was manhandled out of the car by Captain America himself.
“Because, Steve,” Bucky responded. “These men are part of the crew that held and tortured Tony for three months while we sat by and did nothing. They kidnapped a Commando, a member of
The duo entered an awkward silence, before the elevator stopped. “I-I hope you like it. I designed each of the floors, but don’t worry. I won’t take it personally if you want to change anything.”
Steve watched as Tony took everything in. Worst case, Tony would look at the camp like he did the mailbox – and well, anything they stopped to look at today. However, Tony’s face was carefully blank, like the wires in his head got crossed, and he wasn’t sure what to feel. The silence was deafening, and it kept getting longer. Steve swallowed around another bout of uncertainty. “You’re making a fella nervous,” Steve laughed anxiously. “Do you like it?”
Tony snapped his eyes to meet The Captain's gaze. “Umm, there- there hasn’t been any change.” Tony cleared his throat, ignoring how it constricted. Happy’s coma was still a tough subject for Tony to grasp. It had been a shattering jolt back to reality, a terrifying reminder that not even he was untouchable.
“No, but if I get dead rodent on these shoes, you will personally see to it that they are replaced, plus interest.”
The inside of their base was torn to shreds. The usually bright walls were littered with soot, the walls that managed to survive the blast, that is.
Clint huffed out a breath, stepping out of his left shoe. “I can’t believe you,” he muttered, before chucking the shoe at Tony’s face. “Breathe it in, Stark. That smell will get stuck on your clothes for days.”
“The bomb,” Tony started. “When it exploded, metal shards got into my chest. Yinsen tried to pull them all out, but some of them were too small to take out without creating more damage. So, hence the battery,” he said, tapping the reactor with his knuckles. “It keeps the shards from getting to my heart.”
“Wait, what?” Hammer nearly screeched, but then Steve was there, forcing a large hand over his mouth. “Shh,” Steve hissed. “Listen.”
. My name brings nothing but death, Bucky, and now you, Tony, and everyone else is gonna die because of me.”
Steve bit down hard on his lip, coppery liquid filling the inside of his mouth. This was a mistake. Fury was a mistake. Every time he opened his mouth it was to block and parry with ease, cutting down each of their own remarks.
“I’m not asking you to like it, I’m just asking you to trust me.” And wasn’t that a knife in the gut. Clint was convinced Steve was destined to be a superhero with the very useful powers of constant puppy dog eyes and the ability to make anyone feel guilty for anything. Clint hadn’t been to church in decades, but talks like this with Steve had always ended up with him wanting to go to confession. Seriously, dealing with a priest might be easier than facing a disappointed Steve Rogers. And Steve's strength? Clint would be entirely convinced the man was on steroids if he didn’t know Steve personally. Clint had once seen him rip a log in half.
Nick looked up smiling. Before him, the top floor of Stark Industries burst open into a huge ball of flames.
People were fighting over designer shoes instead of their next meal. People filled up their car’s gas tanks more daily than whole families used to fill gas cans in months. They searched for which block had the cheapest cup of coffee instead of searching for which city actually
But he knew he wouldn’t. It he did, it would be yet another concession. Another reminder of his past life that would slip away, and here, alone, it was all he had.
Clint didn’t get a response, but then again, he hadn’t expected one. Clint had only seen him like this a few times. Being the leader of a superhero team would take its toll on anyone, but Steve always managed to put on a strong face for the team. Not that he needed too; any member of the Avengers would follow that man anywhere. But of course, contrary to popular belief, Captain America is not perfect.
In all honestly, Clint didn’t have to use the bathroom, he just needed to get up and walk. He’s found himself doing that more and more lately. He fidgets, twitches, and can never seem to get comfortable. He’s lost count of all the circuits he’s made in his room, how many times he’s just walked aimlessly through the tunnels underneath the speakeasy.
The silence between the two lengthened, Steve twitching at each movement made by Natasha, like a frightened deer in headlights. The twitch turned to a full startle, the car jerking in the road, as Natasha’s ringtone blared, filling up the space of the truck’s cabin. Natasha rolled her eyes at Steve’s steely glare, eyes flicking down at the phone long enough sigh softly before answering the phone, leaning back in her seat, feet swinging up onto the dash lazily.
No threats, no bombs, no bodies, no HYDRA. It was like they had just dropped off the face off the planet again. While Steve and The Commandos were glad to have the break, each passing day they just sat around waiting was pushing Steve’s paranoia through the roof.
I'm going to be leaving the country for a while. Ergo, I won't be able to post until June 5th (three Sunday's from now). Oops?
Rumlow glared at him, before raising the gun to Steve’s temple. Steve looked back unimpressed, causing Rumlow to laugh, standing back up.
Natasha ignored him, stepping around him gracefully. Her eyes tracked the small building, the redhead offering a small hum. “Nice place.”
Iron Man is a murderer. He and his weapons kill thousands in the future. He is the reason Peggy was dead. Rogers couldn’t sit idly by and let it happen. He had to stop it. No matter the cost.
"It's just, we haven't really talked about it. And, don't get me wrong, I'm very happy about the direction this is going, but I can't... I lost you once because of secrets and miscommunication. I need you on the same wavelength as me if we're gonna do this."
Bucky held his hands up, trying to calm his friend down. “Steve, HYDRA, already knew your name. What’s one more mob?”
“You bat people around like a ball of yarn until they leave you alone,” Bucky answered, crossing his arms. “God forbid you let anyone in when something’s bugging you.”
Tony turned to run back to his car when he found himself flung down to the pavement. Searing pain coursed through his body as Tony looked up at his attacker. James Barnes looked down at him, a malicious grin donning his face. “I gotta hand it to you, Stark. You’re a wily one,” he sneered as he pulled out his gun.
Using the distraction to his advantage, Tony pushed The Captain towards the crowd while running the opposite direction. People were screaming; whether they were yelling at The Captain or him, Tony didn’t stop to find out.
Steve found himself going up in the elevator instead of heading towards the ground, eventually stumbling out onto the roof where the hospital’s emergency helicopter sat waiting. He heard Hill speak over the phone, no doubt pulling enough strings to get them usage.
Basically this chapter was just me trying to think like how Tony could get himself out of a situation using science instead of resulting to a gun.
So, Tony stopped him. Enough was Steve the one to give. He needed Steve to know that he was with him, will always be with him, at the end of it all.
“No, Obie. Stop pushing this.” Tony sat glaring at his business partner from behind his desk. His head was pounding, his body flip flopping between exhaustion and hunger. These past two weeks had been nothing but hell; the last thing Tony wanted to deal with was Obie.
Steve closed his eyes, thinking of Tony, who had struggled to walk to the bathroom. Who had to lay his tablet on the bed because his hands were shaking too much to hold it. Who was still covered in healing bruises, leaving behind patches of a sickly yellow-green as the skin healed. Tony, who had come home with a whole chunk of his chest missing and a battery to keep him breathing.
“We still have our work cut out for us. There was an explosion at Stark Industries as well. But with the second attack here, it’s no question that whoever’s behind this is after the whole team,” said Steve.
Tony had already had a life filled with broken relationships and betrayals. No matter how much Steve tried to shower the other man in love, there was always part of Tony that was still convinced that Steve would leave him. Steve knew how lowly Tony thought of himself. That at some point, someone in Tony’s life had convinced Tony that he wasn’t good enough. That he was a disappointment. As soon as Tony agreed to be his, Steve made it his personal goal to take the rest of their lives together to prove that Tony was anything but that. That he was always worth it.
It wasn’t as if Fury’s declaration should have been shocking. It was easy enough to assume that HYDRA managed to find the files – although he still wasn’t sure how yet.
After flicking off the lights, Steve trudged back up the stairs to the main room, where Bucky was showing off his new arm to the rest of the crew.
“I’m not a babysitter, Steve!" his friend growled. "If you think for one second that I’m staying here and letting you go off on your own, you’ve got another thing coming.”
Tony let out a low chuckle, but it quickly turned to a strangled gasp as he felt a finger circle his hole. “It’s alright,” Steve said, as if soothing a wild animal. Tony scoffed, reaching down to thrust Steve’s hand forward, finger slipping in past the first knuckle. “I’m not a wilting flower, Rogers,” Tony grunted, shifting around the intrusion. “Get on with it.”
Tony walked back over to the lab table, grabbing a blowtorch and welding mask, slipping the metal cover his face as he started to take the Doombot apart. It was comforting, the sparks from the blowtorch, the sounds of metal reacting with the heat. See, this? Tony could do this. He could do this all damn day. He was good at it, the best at it. But everything was foreign when it came to being a family man. Tony could more easily explain string theory than how to change a dirty diaper.
Tony gripped his chair tightly as the screen played, ready to grab Pietro and get the hell out of dodge at any moment. The grainy video progresses, showing Sitwell write something on the board and then walk back over to his desk. Upon sitting down, Sitwell jumped back up screaming about the tack.
“Just, wait a little bit before using it, yeah?” Tony added, nodding at the sleek device in Bucky’s hand. “I’m more than confident that Steve and I will move fast enough before the FBI catches wind of anything, but, you know, just to be safe.”
No. Tony was fine. He had promised Steve he wouldn’t leave. If anything, Steve was pretty sure that Tony would outlive death just to get a final laugh in. So, no. Tony is alive.
Tony shook his head. “I won’t let you do this to yourselves. Neither of you. You wanna get angry, get angry at the people who actually kidnapped me.”
Obie met his gaze and for a moment, Tony was afraid, catching a glimpse of something – of someone – he’d never seen before. “You know how I feel about failure. I have no tolerance for it and they didn’t get the job done.”
Steve walked towards the stairs slowly, weaving in and out of the stacks of files as cover. He looked at Bucky, following dutifully behind him, the man how holding Campbell’s gun. He looked at Steve with fierce eyes, but didn’t try to top him. Instead, he reached into his pocket and placed one of Tony’s grenades on a couple of crates. Steve nodded, following suit with the two he carried, dropping them quietly as he made his way towards the stairs.
Of course, being able to stay three steps ahead of any other rival gang, as well as the entire NYPD, didn't exactly come from luck. Of course, with some of the stupid ass decisions their man-in-charge was delegating, maybe there was more luck involved than he thought.
Tony shook his head, pouring a generous helping anyway. Tony couldn’t even tell what day it was, let alone the time. Besides, he needed something to keep him grounded.
Tony rubbed a hand down Steve's arm. "Why do we need to label anything? Can't we just see where this takes us?"
Finally, the elevator dinged, and two men stepped out, guns already trained on Fury’s office. HYDRA members, no doubt there to finish them off. She saw the moment the pair of them caught the faint rustlings of Sam wrestling with Ward.
Yinsen manages to roll his eyes as he slowly crossed the room, his hands carefully holding the tongs. “Relax, I’ve got steady hands. I used to be a doctor.”
Steve leaned forward, pressing their foreheads together as a surge of emotions coursed through his body. “Yea,” Steve answered, his voice wobbly. “Yea, I understand.”
Pierce furrowed his brow. “Well, I hope you know what you’re doing because this has already cost me a man.”
“What, that your handler doesn’t know about Lucky?” Steve asked. “He’s a dog, Clint, I can’t imagine that this would be too much of an issue. Especially since he’s such a handsome boy, aren’t you, bubba?” Steve smiled, patting Lucky’s head.
that he come back. That they needed them. That Steve needed them. And Tony had ignored him. He had refused to take the bait, unable to work himself up to take that final step again. He had been terrified, haunted even, by the idea of what other secrets they were keeping from him, and what else they could use against him. So he had pushed them all away, like the rest of his problems. And now, Steve was paying the price for it.
“Uh, I require precedence,” Tony countered. “If you couldn’t tell, it’s been quite the month for me. My CFO turned out to be crazy, by boyfriend was missing in action for a little while, and I- ”
“Good to see you, buddy,” Tony returned, shooting a smile back easily. “Everyone, this is Yinsen,” said Tony. “He runs the shop.”
he had never been more embarrassed when he was checking out. What was worse, was that the young girl at the register
He pressed his thumbs down, a whining noise filling the room as electricity sped through the wires, building together to create a blast. A flash of bright light and boom. Both guards lay dead at Tony’s feet.
knew. It was then that Sam had met her son, Riley’s nephew. A boy with bright hair and curious eyes. A boy named after his uncle.
“You won’t win, not this time,” Tony promised fiercely. He powered a blast and shot it above Obie’s head, watching in grim satisfaction as scaffolding collapsed on him. He could hear Obie’s pained shout, but saw the metal shifting, the man looking for a way to get out. Tony darted behind a fallen support beam, taking cover as quickly as he could.
Steve though… God, when Tony tells him that he doesn’t celebrate his birthday- that he doesn’t want any gifts- Steve gives him this kicked puppy look.
Tony groaned as the Ikea chair came into view. Steve smiled. “Back to work?” Tony grumbled and plopped down onto the floor. “JARVIS? Walk me through this?”
His shirt may or may not be riding up, giving Tony a glance of rock solid abs. Tony’s head cocks to the side and he licks his lips. He could get used to this.
“That’s great. That’s so great, Tony. How’s Friday? Pick you up at 6?” Tony nodded fervently. Steve grinned wider. “Friday it is.”
“Are you ready, Tony?” Tony looks up. His eyes a little glassy. “Do you want this?” Tony nods. Steve nips at Tony’s inner thigh. “Words, baby.”
“Good! That was good! Again, baby. Do it for me? Breath again.” Tony inhales shakily. It feels better. It’s working. There’s air in his lungs. He mimics Steve’s breathing. Slowly but surely, his pulse stops racing. He can hear what’s happening. There are cameras flashing. Pepper is watching with a horror-struck expression while Steve holds him.
Tony makes an undignified squawk and moves back quickly. “S-sorry!” Steve’s face is slowly turning red, blotchy pink spreading across his fair skin. “Allen wrench?” he offers quietly, holding it out. Tony takes it and immediately turns back to the chair.
Tony backs up to make a smart remark. Then he realizes how close they are. They’re both on the floor, but his arms are around Steve’s neck, Steve’s big, warm hands on Tony’s waist. He looks up into Steve’s cool, azure eyes and his heart beat flutters. Steve’s smile fades slightly, and Tony is about to ask him what’s wrong when he leans forward.
“Good boy. Get undressed.” With that, Steve goes to the kitchen, leaving Tony alone. Slowly, Tony starts to undress. He doesn’t have to put on a show or anything, but that almost makes things more nerve-wracking. He sits on the bed to untie his shoes and pull of his socks. He unbuttons his shirt, taking slow deep breaths as he exposes the arc reactor. He stands and undoes his belt, letting his pants drop, and, finally, tugs off his boxers.
After that, Steve was incorrigible. He’d whisper French in his ear at breakfast until Tony was squirming and needed to be excused. He’d say a sharp command on missions to get Tony hard in his suit. It was unfair, really.
Tony flushes and God he’s going to look so beautiful under Steve. He nods. Steve’s hand caresses Tony’s cheek, letting his thumb run over Tony’s plush bottom lip. “Going to need a verbal answer there.”
Steve hushes him softly, petting Tony’s neck. “It’s fine. I want to reward you.” Steve nuzzles Tony’s neck. “Do you want me to pick?” With a sigh of relief, Tony nods. “Okay. Let’s go to the bedroom.” Scooping Tony into his arms, Steve carries him to their bedroom.
The first date is a complete success. Tony loved the exhibit, if his constant excited explanations were anything to go by. Steve listened, which was nice because he wasn’t sure he’d understand anything otherwise. They left the exhibit and went for dinner at one of Steve’s favorite Italian hole-in-the-walls.
Tony pushes the door open, stepping inside to kick off his shoes and set down his keys and wallet. “Can I get you anything to dri-mmf!” Steve closes the distance between them, tilting Tony’s head up for a passionate kiss that leaves him dizzy. “Steve,” he croaks.
Tony nods, arching into Steve’s solid body. “Patience,” Steve chides. “Do you want to see your picture?” Tony’s eyes widen. “Yes.” Smirking, Steve gets the charcoal drawing. Tony doesn’t know much about art, but he can tell Steve is good. However, he’s more focused on how Steve has drawn him. He looks hungry, hungry for Steve, and yet so focused on pleasing him. Tony can see the slight strain in the way Steve’s drawn his muscles.
Tony hummed in response, dropping his head to rest against Steve’s collarbone, looking down at his fingers trailing over his chest, tracing a design that only he saw.
Immediately, Tony tensed, head thrashing in the barrel as water slipped over the side. He was drowning. “I’ll kill him,” the voice of their captor hissed. “Tony Stark means nothing to me. I will kill him in front of you and you’ll take it to the grave knowing it was all your fault.”
There was nothing but sirens of the incoming firetrucks, the crackling off flames, the crumbling of once solid walls.
Tony started typing a few commands to JARVIS, searching for a phone number. Tony might not have any friends at the moment, but that didn’t mean The Captain didn’t. Number secured, Tony pushed the phone to his ear.
But then, she got up. She straightened out her suit, marched over to the mini bar and poured herself a generous drink. Pepper stomped back over to the desk, took a swig, and sat back down in her chair. She gestured to the seats facing her.
“That being said,” Steve continued patiently. “We’re going to have to take some precautions in the future until this problem is resolved.”
Tony thought, glaring at the older man. Maybe this was the reason Pepper wanted him to come to board meetings. To come and see the greedy warmongers he let run his company while he turned a blind eye to keep tinkering in his lab. "I wouldn't say that," Tony responded. "There's a high chance that I'll be calling your family tonight," he hissed.
Steve shook his head. “I haven’t at all,” he confessed. “I had a large target on my back. If I started using them as the SSR did, everyone would figure out who I was in relation to them eventually. I figured it was easier for me to let them collect dust.”
The pair were snuggled together, looking up at the sky, while their sticky marshmallowed hands intertwined under the thick blanket covering them. The whiskey bottle sat between them, but Steve found himself enjoying the taste off Tony’s mouth, rather than straight from the bottle.
Steve knew that smile. It was the same one that Nat would wear whenever she wanted Steve to make a bet with her. So far, he hadn’t won a single one. “You gonna make me sit here hours while you shop as payback?”
Bucky huffed. "Come on, Steve. We haven't pulled a job in weeks. People are starting to get antsy! Let us have this one."
“Jesus,” Bucky sighed. “You and Stark are a fucking match made in heaven, you know that? You’re as nuts as he is.”
Bucky shook his head, tremors taking over his body once he felt tears finally slip down his face. “No,” he moaned. “They shot him, they shot him.”
Once Barnes was gone, Tony turned back to The Captain, looking him over. The blonde looked exhausted to the bone, not to mention infuriated, covered in blood, grime, and sweat. The Captain ran a hand through his already greasy locks, looking idly around the room.
Tony apparently had other plans, pushing Steve back down on the bed, straddling him. He grabbed Steve’s cock and slowly sunk down on it. Tony stared at Steve; his mouth was gaping open, blue eyes glowing in the moon light.
“It doesn’t matter where you’re doing this, you shouldn’t be doing it without a doctor,” Barnes growled. “Let me at least call Bruce.”
He turned, drawn like a cat to the sun, stretching to get closer to the soothing tones.  A hand pushed through his hair, fingers tracing his head almost as gently as the voice had. “Relax, Capsicle.” Warm breath puffed into his neck. “Take a breather; we’ve got you. I’ve got you.”
Steve couldn’t begin to imagine the scenarios the man was chugging through in his head. Formulating numbers and outcomes in milliseconds, searching desperately for a way to win. No doubt his head was mostly filled with ideas on how to get Steve out of the room. Keeping his eyes locked with Tony, Steve stepped right next to him, dropping in the chair next to him.
“Tony?” Steve tried again, ignoring his gut wrenching as he was met with an empty lab. It was in more disarray than it usually was, but Steve knew that once Tony had a stroke of inspiration, the man turned into a walking tornado. “This isn’t funny, Tony,” he tried. “You win. Come out and rub it in my face.”
Steve reached for it immediately, not caring how desperate it may have made him look. “You sure about this?” he replied.
Tony almost lost it again when he heard the wounded sound that came from his left. Rogers bolted from his side and straight to the bedside, arms reached out for the fallen man. Right before he got to the bed, the blonde froze, his hands hovering slightly over the other form, as if he thought that even the slightest touch could hurt him. That if he got too close Barnes would just disappear again.
Clint was already sitting in the chair opposite his desk when he walked in. Steve sighed, wishing Tony was by his side. He was always stronger with him there.
Steve looked furious, but more so scared. As he should be. Loki was dangerous as is; who knew what would happen if he knew where the team’s new headquarters were.
Tony sighed again, leaning into Steve’s chest before pushing away. “I’m not doing a very good job at explaining this.”
“Burn in hell,” Tony yelled, firing both repulsors full blast, one catching an ammunition box, setting in ablaze. Raza started screaming, rolling around on the floor, but Tony found that he only had eyes for one man.
He felt Tony pull away, only to be surprised as the man stumbled out if his chair, falling forward until his full weight strattled Steve's thighs, Tony's body curling into his chest.
What a bitch that day had been. Slipping away from his boss during the day and hiding in the loading dock until the coast was clear. Then, trucking it out to the field to start on a section, before racing back before anyone noticed. What everyone thought was a singular fire was actually multiple, spread out throughout the day, whenever Clint could spare a few minutes to get away. Clint had reached his step goal five times over that day.
The Captain could just go toe to toe against HYDRA without him, and Tony would do as he’s always done: survive.
Steve watched as Clint then slid over to the officer, smiling softly. “Phil?” Clint tried to get the man’s attention, but Coulson only had eyes for Steve. He was out of breath; who knows how far Coulson ran to get here. He looked flustered, putting Steve on edge. Coulson doesn’t get flustered. And he sure as hell wouldn't be caught walking around the base of The Commandos in broad daylight. Something wasn’t right.
“Calm down Jensen, it’s just for a moment.” Jared said running his hands through the collar then putting it down out of the way. Peter bit the inside of his cheek mad at him.
“It’s okay Peter he won’t touch it again.” Jared said and Peter smiled glad Jared kept his promise to keep the collar away from Misha.
“Is he okay?” Misha asked worriedly and Mark nodded as Peter sighed closing his eyes momentarily just happy that Mark and Misha were here.
“It’s alright you’re not him.” Peter reminded himself and calmed down a bit still trying to move on.
“We’ll put you to rest soon I promise.” Jared said and Peter nodded feeling a little sad that he won’t be staying.
“R-right, I just had this dream, y-you know what it’s not important. S-So how have... you... been?” Peter asked stuttering, going to his old locker and opening it.
Tony sighed again and walked over to where he threw his sunglasses. Tony picked up the now broken sunglasses and sighed sadly. Tony quickly fixed them and then put them on as he unlocked the lab.
“Tom please wake up I don’t care if your real name is Peter you’ll always be Tom to me. I know why you changed your name and I would too and I just don’t wanna lose you. Tom please wake up!” Mark yelled crying out.
“Ironman?” Tony heard Steve call out. Tony quickly cooled down and grabbed his sunglasses putting them on and put his hands in his pockets.
“I could never stay mad at you.” Ironman said separating and hugging Tony and kissing him passionately. Tony kisses back just as passionate relief flooding through his system.
“Come on let’s go back we don’t want Steve snooping around our room.” Ironman said and Tony’s eyes widened unlocking the lab and running towards their room. Ironman laughed and ran after Tony happily.
“Can I touch you?” Tony asked and Peter shook his head backing up against the wall his panic getting the best of him.
“You ready.” Tony said and they all nodded. Ironman smiled making the light dim a little more as Tony let Ironman taking over showing his darkened skin and glowing blue eyes. Steve looked at him in wonder Sam said “woah” and Clint backed away surprised.
“Right.” Richard said and squeezed the collar angrily. Peter felt the pressure on his throat get harder and looked at Jensen pleadingly.
“There.” Tony said and Peter tried examining the collar to feel what he put on it but Tony shocked him and Peter yelped again.
“Dad, stop embarrassing me.” Tom said quietly. Robert has become like a second dad to Tom and they were close so them calling each other dad and son was common.
“Yeah we did good and we even got Natasha to chuckle Tony said bringing up the footage of Natasha and Steve in the kitchen.
“This way is to the bedrooms and this room is yours.” Mark said entering a bed room and Peter looked at it questionably.
“The arc reactor keeps me alive the rest of the armor isn’t really necessary.” Ironman said tiredly.
“I’m afraid you won’t be going anywhere.” Tony said taking the vial of blood and left the room. Peter watched in horror as Tony left him alone and Peter growled in frustration.
“Come on Peter, it’s not to late to enjoy this.” Tony said biting Tony in the neck and Peter yelled out in pain as Tony bit him and used his weight to hump him. Peter cried out of pain and helplessness.
“Stupid emotions.” Tony said calmly willing himself to feel nothing. Tony nodded his head opening his eyes again. Tony was miserable and still is but he has to do this. He has to be cold with no emotions. Emotions meant pain and Tony hates pain.
“I can assure you Ironman hasn’t laid a hand on me.” Tony said confidently. Steve stood up abruptly and Tony flinched back unintentionally memories of Afghanistan still haunting him. Tony put up his hand to defend himself and Steve sighed.
“Want me to take you on a tour of the house?” Mark asked smiling and Peter smiled back opening his eyes and lifting his head up from his arms.
“Why thank you Tom.” Jensen said and Peter almost didn’t understand why Jensen called him Tom until he remembered last night.
“You know I thought that shock collars were just for dogs, didn’t know it worked so well with spiders.” Tony said and Peter ground his teeth wanting nothing more than to just strangle Tony right then and there.
“What are you guys talking about.” Steve spoke rattling Tony out of his thoughts. Tony put down his phone making the message go away and blushed.
“Yeah, I do I really do.” Tony said wiping away Ironman’s tears and holding him close. Ironman snuggled into Tony’s neck for comfort and smiled.
“Rhodey!” Tony said noticing Rhodes and Ironman went silent just hiding in the back of the mind watching as Tony hugged his best friend.
“J, can you please unlock the collar.” Peter said desperately only remembering Tony call his AI J. Peter rejoiced hearing the collar click and took off the collar, collapsing to the ground in relief.
“I told them he was just an intern and ran away from home.” Bruce said and Peter looked at Bruce in betrayal. Bruce wasn’t going to help him he lied. Peter ran towards the door but got electrocuted before he could get there. Peter recoiled hard and panted heavily just wanting to get out of here. Tony walked over to him and attached the chain to his collar and chained him to the wall. Peter tried resisting but Tony shocked him again.
“Love you too Tony.” She said walking away and Tony couldn’t help but want her. He felt nothing but admiration and love. He shook his head and then went to the meeting.
“I’m sorry I remind you of that guy.” Tony said sadly realizing he was the one Peter was afraid of because he looked like this other guy.
“We’ll make it.” Ironman said determined and kept trudging through the desert while dragging Tony with him.
“Tony, what’s wrong? Was it something I said?” Ironman said worried about him and Tony tried muffling his cries not wanting Ironman to hear how broken he was.
The Avengers barely knew Tony Stark. Having said that, when his teammates insulted Tony Stark he couldn’t do anything to defend himself.
“I just needed a break from trying to catch up to your genius level.” Tony said looking at Peter fondly. Peter chuckled hiding his work away and then smiled at Tony.
“That’s all on YouTube right? I mean that’s where you found that did you know it’s all fake it’s all done on the computer. It’s like that video” Peter said trying to get the idea that he was Spider-Man out of Tony’s mind.
“Sure.” Jensen said seeing that Peter really needed this so he sat in a chair in the room and sighed smiling.
“I can’t get it off!” Peter cried out dropping the pocket knife and struggled with the collar pulling and at it again and Mark stopped him.
“Tom he is not going to find you and if he does we’ll be ready I won’t let him take you.” Jensen said and Peter nodded wanting to believe him but the initial fear of Tony finding him was still there what if Tony put a tracker in him.
“Let him go or I kill us both.” Tony said holding up an EMP. Ironman’s eyes widened looking at Tony scared.
“Don’t say anything.” Tony said glaring at him and Peter swallowed afraid and closed his eyes trying not to cry.
“Can I see it?” Jensen said and Peter shook his head as Jared handed it over. Jensen didn’t touch the inner part of the collar and Peter was eternally grateful for that.
“I’m sorry.” Mark said and left the room and Peter followed him. A girl stopped him and Peter looked at her confused.
“Don’t act out or run away, you won’t get far and even if you do somehow run away there is no where you can go where I won’t find you.” Tony threatened and Peter closed his eyes not wanting to see Tony anymore. Tony sighed touching Peter’s face and Peter flinched away opening his eyes. Peter then got shocked and yelped trying not to cry.
“I could get you the resources we could make some of your ideas. Plus I was working on a suit for you...” Tony said blushing embarrassed that Peter’s designs were so more advanced than his own.
“Fine Fine I’ll go.” Clint said not seeing Ironman in sight. Clint climbed back up into the vents and sighed sadly.
“Come on.” Tony said tugging at the leash making Peter stumble forward and Peter was shocked to find out that the collar didn’t shock him when he exited the box.
“Wrong answer.” Tony said and started kissing Peter shocking Peter when he wanted at different levels trying to get the most out of Peter’s pain. Peter withered in pain and blushed as he took a tiny bit of joy as Tony kissed him roughly and grinding against him.
“Hey Spider-Man.” Tony said and Peter fell off, catching himself barely and then walked his way back up and stood on the opposite side of the rails.
“Just get back let me talk to him.” Ironman said and then Tony handed over control hiding back inside of Ironman’s mind.
“Please I need to get it off!” Peter yelled looking at Mark with tears in his eyes. Peter then remembered Tony’s AI in the Ironman suit and quickly went over to it.
“I’m here Mark.” Peter said and Mark tried hugging him but he just went through him and Peter sighed sadly seeing Mark cry again. Eventually Misha came and picked Mark up bringing him home and Peter followed them and watched as Mark cried more. They had a funeral for Peter a hunter’s funeral salt and burned and Peter finally moved onto the afterlife.
“What happened last night?” Jared said confused and trying to remember why he would have wrote this reminder. Jared then got another reminder.
“He shocked me made me do whatever he wanted.” Peter said remembering all the times Tony shocked him.
“I love you, it’s okay. You’re safe you are not bad. You’re beautiful. You are not scary. You are not a monster.” Tony said knowing what Ironman thought of himself. Ironman cried into Tony’s shoulder as Tony whispered comforting phrases into his ear.
“Yeah remember when you applied? I approved. So now we’re in business.” Tony said and Peter agreed  reluctantly just wanting Tony out of his house.
“Tony did this glowing eyes thing with the armor making him look like Ironman.” Steve said and Tony chuckled trying to calm down Ironman feeling him starting to panic.
“I made him angry?!” Jared yelled approaching Jensen. Peter materialized pushing Jared back away from Jensen angrily.
“Hey!” Tom and Robert said at the same time. Tom struggled a bit but couldn’t get Tony to let him go so he gave up and decided to have a staring contest with Peter instead.
Peter dug his feet into the ground using his super strength and flipped Tony over making the armor crash into the ground hard making Tony drop the remote. Peter broke the remote and then punched Tony hard and used a knife he found and stabbed the arc reactor in Tony’s chest making the suit malfunction.
“Then why aren’t you in college what are you still doing at Midtown Tech?” Tony asked and Peter sighed.
“I told you Peter you can’t get out.” Tony said looking down at Peter sadly. Peter looked up at him with disbelief, fear, and sadness.
“Feel free to settle in. Jensen will be here in an hour or so. You can wonder about and do whatever you want.” Mark said and left not really wanting to give the tour anymore. Peter nodded and sighed looking at the small room he was in. This wasn’t too bad much better than his past living conditions.
“You know what I think is cool? This webbing.” Tony said picking up a cartridge of his web fluid and threw it at him and Peter caught it.
“I’m sorry for reminding you of whoever made you like this.” Tony said and Peter chuckled looking up at Tony and smiling a little.
Tony stopped too and looked at Peter confused as to why he stopped then noticed the lines on the ground signifying where the invisible box was.
“He’s mute.” Tony lied and Peter bit the inside of his cheek trying not to do anything Tony wouldn’t like the fear of being shocked still very much there.
“You gonna call your body guard because you are gonna need him.” Steve threatened and Ironman nearly leapt out of Tony and strangled Steve.
“Peter, I’m sorry for not visiting you earlier but Mark kinda forced me to come.” Misha said trying to joke.
“Can’t have you trying to kill me.” Tony said and then got out his torture device the cursed remote that could shock Peter as many times as Tony wanted.
“How do we even know that was real though we were both drunk and it was just a day after we burned his body.” Jensen said freaked out and Jared sighed.
“We are so much more than friends and you know that.” Ironman said and Tony nodded snuggling into Ironman’s neck.
“Uh I’ll help.” Tony said trying not to sound too dumb in front of the genius that was Peter Parker. Tony tried to keep up with Peter’s math and equations but the math Peter was doing, he never saw before. Tony then recognized some code he was doing.
“It’s okay we will figure things out.” Robert said trying to comfort them and ran his fingers through Peter’s hair as he began to cry silently hugging ‘his’ father figure that actually cared.
“Leave the old man alone I’m sure he didn’t touch anything, right?” Ironman said putting a hand on Tony’s shoulder and then glaring at Steve.
“have you guys ever heard of Shawarma I never had it before but it sounds good.” Ironman said smiling and was glad his identity was still a secret. ‘We did it Tony’ Ironman thought to him. ‘Tony?’ Ironman got more worried as Tony didn’t respond. ‘Wow’ Tony finally said and Ironman sighed in relief. ‘Don’t scare me like that!’ Ironman said just glad Tony was okay. ‘Alright.’ Tony said just happy to be alive.
“I think that was Ironman...” Natasha said guiltily. Sam freaked out and Clint shivered scared of Tony and whatever thing that came out of him.
“Good pretty good. Are you going to that science field trip we have tomorrow to Stark Industries?” Ned asked and Peter froze.
“He is not a kid and I have to do this to him he deserves it.” Ironman said pressing a button that made the panel see through and watched as Peter cried.
“That reminds me how old were you when all of this was happening?” Tony asked confused because the timeline in Tony’s head didn’t make sense.
“I know you probably can’t hear me right now, but Jensen is pretty messed up, Jared too. We all miss you bud. I know you want us to move on but it’s so hard to stick together when you’re gone...” Richard whispered crying silently and holding the collar.
“No you almost got yourself killed! Next time just let me do the talking okay!” Ironman said and Tony nodded.
“I’m not mad of course I’m not mad. If anything I’m glad it’s you.” Steve said suddenly hugging him and Tony blushed hugging back happily.
“You disappointed me.” Tony said and Peter shivered in fear. Tony kissed him and Peter pushed Tony back easily and Tony shocked him making him yelp out in pain.
“Hey Tom.” Mark said visiting again and Peter mentally smiled but was kinda disappointed Jensen and Jared didn’t come to visit him again.
“we will find a way.” Jared said and then Peter couldn’t hear him anymore. Peter didn’t know how much time passed but he heard another voice.
“It’s okay Peter.” Tony said kissing him softly and Peter just looked at him angrily and struggled to speak.
“Oh my gosh.” Steve said feeling the Ironman helmet in his hands and Natasha looked towards where Steve’s face was lit up by Ironman’s eyes.
“Come on Spider-Man there has to be some way out.” Peter whispered to himself looking around carefully studying the room he was in trying to figure out how to get out. Peter heard someone enter the room and looked to see who it was.
“Fine but I expect to see you again and soon I’m only giving you the rest of today then you come out understand.” Natasha said continuing to glare at him.
“Quick Peter you need to go through its closing!” Robert said worried. Peter looked at the portal and then made a split second decision.
“Well would you like to get lunch because I’m starving.” Peter suggested and Tony smiled getting up.
Tony got on his sunglasses and his eyes felt much cooler and he felt much better. Tony smiled putting on false happiness telling himself it would be okay. Tony knew he couldn’t change his situation so he just pretended it was okay and maybe it would be okay eventually. Tony hated it but it worked most of the time. Tony called Rhodey and they talked about anything and everything. Tony was just glad Rhodey was there for him. At least that’s what he told himself.
“Yeah I know but Tony is just as protective of Ironman as Ironman is protective of Tony.” Natasha said sighing in defeat.
“Please stop!” Tony yelled, crying out in pain. Ironman gave him one last hard kick before leaving him alone. Tony tried not to cry as he tended to his wounds and then went to the kitchen to get some food.
“You can do this.” Tony said confidently and Ironman nodded closing his eyes trying to imagine what it was like when he had his own body and Tony helped him. Ironman felt himself separate from Tony and Ironman smiled.
“He trusts us Steve he just wants to keep his identity a secret.” Natasha defended him and Ironman bowed his head as a silent thank you to Nat.
“Oh.” Tony said surprised to see Steve and Tony got nervous knowing the wounds on his face were very visible.
“He beat me and shocked me. He nearly crushed me making me hold up a piece of ceiling. He bit me and treated me like an animal.” Peter said crying now.
“You’re so perfect.” Tony said approaching him and grabbing the remote too. Peter started to panic seeing an angry lustful Tony coming after him.
“Okay I won’t touch you  it’s okay you’re okay.” Tony said and Peter started crying quietly. Tony tried his best to comfort Peter but Peter just shivered under his words. Tony backed up and got a good four or five feet between them and Peter finally calmed down wiping away his tears.
“Okay now get on this and start running.” Tony said and Peter stood up reluctantly getting on the device.
“I just woke up and I’m putting it on the old way.” Ironman said. Wait did Ironman sleep in the lab?
“Can we merge again?” Ironman asked and Tony nodded letting Ironman come in. Ironman hid at the back of Tony’s mind not wanting to come out and Tony sighed sadly trying to comfort Ironman hearing all his thoughts and insecurities.
“Okay” Tony smiled. “I promise I will let you out once we get home.” Tony promised and Ironman smiled mentally. ‘Okay Tony I’m here with you I can wait.’ Ironman thought not wanting to get Tony in trouble.
“Nah it’s alright.” Tony said and hugged Peter and Peter hugged back happily. Peter felt the arc reactor and let go trying not to freak out Tony’s hold a little too familiar. Tony noticed Peter tense up. Tony frowned at him.
“Collar?” Tony looked at the kid confused and then noticed his eyes were glazed like he was stuck in a memory and Tony looked at him sadly and tried to calm him down.
“yeah but we did it.” Ironman said smiling and Tony smiled feeling comfort in Ironman’s words. They passed out the last thing they remember is the stars and the huge vastness of space.
“Because Ironman you don’t trust us and we don’t trust you.” Steve said like it was obvious and Tony growled angrily.
“Well if you ever need to talk to someone, we are all here for you.” Mark said and Peter looked at him hiding his smile.
“Hey everyone.” Peter said nervously. Tony sighed at his fanboying and remembering that Peter was still just a kid. Tony went on with his speech and Peter felt his spider sense go off.
“Supernatural.” Peter replied simply watching as The Men of Letters came in and Peter winced remembering how he was there in his past life with them.
“Steve let me go!” Tony yelled turning towards him and almost glared at him but kept his eyes closed tightly.
“I am Ironman.” Ironman said separating from Tony and standing up while Tony smiled up at him still sitting down. Natasha shocked him and Ironman growled and Tony glared at Natasha getting in the line of fire if anyone else dared attack him.
“Alright I’ll set a reminder.” Jared said and Peter wondered if Jared was always this obedient when drunk. Maybe it was because Peter was dead that Jared was willing to do whatever he said.
