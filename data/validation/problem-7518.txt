Jarvis took a moment longer before he replied. "Yes, sir." Then, he piloted one of the suits he controlled to stop Ross earlier and had it softly pick Tony up in its metallic arms. "You are safe now."
Everyone returned to the tower at some point during the night, in the morning each of the Avengers, minus Tony and Steve could be found either snoozing away at the common area – i.e. Clint, or eating a small breakfast in the kitchen, i.e. everyone else. No one was in a conversational mood, and no one wanted to look the others in the eye.
, Tony Stark is in no way clear-minded, is he? Acts normal one second, tries to escape his room the next? Did he tell you what he thinks happened back at the crash site? Sam told me how paranoid he was yesterday when he visited." He paused for a long moment, sighing and relaxing his body. "Jim, I'm sorry. I really am – but what Tony had been through could not have left him the same as he was before. I am not a doctor, and I don't really understand much about this kind of thing – that's more of Bruce's field, but it seems awfully clear to me that Tony's mind… You have to agree he has not been the same."
At some point or another, sleep would become unavoidable. But right now something is blowing cold air at the back of her neck and is making the hair there bristle with alert and discomfort. At any other day, she'd find her way to Clint's side on the couch and wake him up for a quick session of training, or she'd have Not-Avengers-related work to do and leave. She didn't like it – staying in one place all of the time, especially when the air was heavy with emotions no one could quite place.
Tony blinked, suddenly exhausted again. “Nope. All okay here. No bleeding.”
"Aw… that doesn't look too comfortable, Tony," he said as he went to the kitchen, placing a paper bag on the counter, alerting his companion of his presence. Tony's entire body convulsed once at the sound of his voice, his eyes opened and wildly searched the darkness for the source of Steve's voice, but with normal, unenhanced eyes, that was near impossible. The sound of his breathing – already stressed before he was made aware of Steve presence, now turned erratic.
up as soon as possible, we have no time to loiter around." He got up, balancing his entire weight on his good leg as if intending to walk right back inside and pull Rhodes out by the ear if he had to.
"Another visitor? Who?" Sam, probably. Or Natasha, Natasha knew about Bucky, and about the Winter Soldier more than she let on during the fall of shield. So, it was probably her. Only – it actually wasn't. When the doors to the inner wards of the facility opened and from inside came out Colonel Rhodes in full military attire, holding a file folder and working on a StarkPad with his spare hand. Both of them froze in place when they noticed the other, Rhodes entire body tensed at once, probably remembering the last time he and Steve had a standoff at a hospital waiting room. Steve frowned and folded his hands across his chest, imposing his presence as the smaller man looked at him with cold, thundering eyes.
"We think it might have been one of the hostiles, maybe trying to… lower our moral by despoiling our wounded and dead. Especially one of earth's defenders." Bruce seemed wrung out, "I'm sorry. The past night had been… can we move on to the next topic now? Or are we done? I'd like to go check on Nat before she storms out of the infirmary on her own again." Everyone in the room nodded, Sam murmured something to himself about going to the clinic to pick up some pamphlets and asked Steve if he'd like to join, something about the tone of his voice seemed to indicate that he wanted to talk about it.
Clint had always been clever, he picked up her lack of answer and knew what it meant, and they continued stalking toward the hut, managing to avoid traps and a few more shooting guns, which were then disabled using most of the special arrows at Clint's disposal. He was left nearly empty-handed when they finally reached the spot where the partial floor plans claimed the entrance was. There was no indication of that on the outside, however. What they saw and unfortunately smelt seemed like nothing more than rotting wood panels.
"Steve, did something...?" keeping his voice as soft as he could, Bruce thought back to the meeting of the morning before, how Steve asked about what happened to Tony but did no really seemed surprised, how he avoided visiting for so long and then just suddenly become this protective.
When Steve nodded sternly, his eyes focusing on Tony and more specifically, on where Bruce was still touching Tony's arm after finishing with the syringe, Bruce let out some held up air. The Hulk felt unsettled – not just angry – he was always angry. This was something else.
"Okay Tony…" Rhodey said, putting down his fork. "You have been gone for two months." He began, watching Tony wince and close his eyes, scrunching his face to keep them shut. "Maybe we shouldn't do this today, Tones… you know the story."
All he had to do was wait patiently a while.
He scoured the street, went back to the store – the pharmacy, and how stupid was he to not notice that the first time – and found it mugged. He called it in and toured the skies. For the entire night and another half day before returning to the tower, exhausted but unable to sleep.
"Tony?" Rhodey looked at his friend, then around the room – trying to find the trigger to his sudden change of temper, the only thing that changed was Sam coming into the room.
be dead; I didn't notice the tone of his words…" Bruce supplied, his eyes red and sunken and tired after days of the hulked out state of rage with no sleep, "And… God, oh god… I let him stay there with him, alone… I…" he left the room abruptly, and minutes later they all winced at the sound of a roar and glass breaking.
"I heard you've been giving the nurses trouble with your infamous stubbornness." Bruce quipped as he got closer and put his hand on Steve's tense shoulder, rubbing at it to sooth the muscle. Steve sighed and gave him a thankful smile before returning his eyes to Tony.
It took time. Jarvis had to explain several times how to get to the concealed entrance to the room, guide him through a convoluted set of tunnels that started with a secret door in the floor in the living area, and continued for a while. The updated floor plans Jarvis sent to his armor stated the room ended up being right next to the living area, but as the AI slowly and calmly explained – breaking a wall could result in a disaster as the still did not know the exact layout and where Tony was actually at, and pulling a door off its hinges would be far less risky, so they took the longer path.
He'd grown… somewhat accustomed to the oxygen mask, that past week, relished how much easier it was to breath when it was on. He didn't imagine that with it off – breathing would just be an impossibility. He knew his crushed chest had to recover for a while longer before he could actually breathe well on his own but apparently, between 'breathing well' and 'not breathing at all' there was a spectrum of pain.
Rhodes was right, they have been making up stories and avoiding the one explanation that made them feel uncomfortable, even if it was possible, even if it seemed probable, they just preferred not to believe it, not to believe Tony. Bruce had been, essentially, Gas-lighting him by rejecting his story and attributing it to dreams and hallucinations. It wasn't out of malice, not with the intent of abuse. She would know, she wielded psychology as a weapon as well as she did any gun or baton. But they have all done it, all participated. They didn't even try to keep Steve away, knowing that he was doing this and just letting him, based on their perception of the man – and the one person who did believe Tony, who did try to keep his abuser away, was now wearing a cast on his arm and exhibited a broken nose.
Tony groaned at the news, that was not who he was hoping to have to deal with on the subject. "Keep him on ice for me for a few moments, tell me if he becomes too aggressive."
It never took. The pain didn't go away; it just went deeper. Every mistake he'd made worsened it still, and at some point, the suits didn't help anymore.
Tony screamed, well, he tried. And as a result his chest convulsed in a fit of painful coughs and snorts, but that was nothing compared to what the intrusion of his body felt like. His whole body felt as if on fire, as clichéd as that is. A body this broken shouldn't be used like that was what he wanted to tell Steve, only he couldn't speak now. His mind all but shut down all motor functions, he could do nothing but feel pain coming out from every atom making his body. He wished the numbness came back…
He was supposed to be in the hospital, protected by JARVIS in a suit at the entrance to his room and two more veiled and hidden outside his window. He was waiting for Rhodey to come back from the tower with more work for him to do as he had already taken apart and reassembled all of the prototypes from the last time several times and was getting bored.
It was time, he decided, to do something for himself. Steve had waited, he waited until it was almost too late and now he didn't even know if what he wanted before was what he would get now. He needed to make sure that if he chose to pursue this – if he was to make Tony his paramour or even just a fuck-buddy of some sort, Tony would still be the same as the one he lusted after.
She wasn't even sure why she bought the third coffee – Tony couldn't drink it. Again, an action is done out of impulse and without planning. She guessed Steve would appreciate two servings, and the donuts would wait until Tony could eat them – otherwise, the betrayed puppy-eyes would haunt both her and Steve until the end of eternity.
"That's baloney, Jim-" Steve started when Rhodes interrupted him with a hand gesture.
"Hell… this is…" the voice was shaken, still echo-y. Tony heard the words, but couldn't quite process what was said. It was like listening to someone talk from under water, broken up, slurred words.
Seeing Tony like this – happy, relaxed and not so much in pain as he looked when they got there seemed too good to be true, and as with most things that seemed that way – it really was so.
And with Steve, he failed so damn spectacularly, stupendously. He put a tracking device on him, not because he didn't trust that he would do what he said, but because he wanted to make sure he wasn't going to do something stupid, just so he could have an eye on his friend and make sure that he was really alright, come to his aide if he wasn't.
Once again, there was an eerie and uncomfortable silence in the room, interrupted only by the door slammed shut following Rhodes who left it without another word. Nobody moved to follow or stop him.
"Sh, sh…" he murmured as he leaned over Tony, his hands moving across the blemished skin covering the now nearly naked Avenger's torso, moving down, trying to get a feeling of every piece of Tony, memorize the way his soft belly felt under his fingers, and the little sounds that were made as one hand sunk lower to touch what it was never allowed before. "Help is coming… I'm helping. Okay, Tony? That's okay with you right?" a single stroke made Tony's head shoot back into the wall behind him – albeit with no great force, and gasp for air when a second one came soon after. Tony was murmuring things again, his eyes were unable to focus as he thrashed his head from side to side, hurting himself, writhing under Steve's touch.
Once he finished the sandwich the helmet closed over his head once more, and he headed to the lift-off area, preparing to leave again.
Rhodey didn't go to his own apartment after being shamefully kicked out of Tony's room in the hospital. He couldn't bear to be all on his own, but the company of other people was also too much. The solution on days like those was usually 'talk to Tony until he annoys the melancholy away.' When Tony wasn't available, a conversation with JARVIS was always a nice distraction. Considering it was built by Tony – the A.I. was incredibly level-headed, and always found the most intriguing and relevant conversational topics.
She got up from her own bed and walked to her teammate. Rhodes… he was an Avenger, was part of the team, a valuable part with extensive strategical knowledge, years of training and field experience. He was an Avenger, but before that he was Tony's friend – his
Tony locked his gaze with Steve's enraged glare as he shot him a third time, he listened to Steve scream and did not tear apart the eye contact even as General Ross and several of his goons burst through his doors to witness what was happening. When they tried getting closer to stop him, three iron man suits immediately stepped in front of them and blocked the way.
"Steve..." Natasha was the one who opened, and surprisingly, or maybe not too much so, had a glint of gentleness in her voice. She hesitated, saying his name seemed to have awakened some kind of a realization in her, as if she was just now understanding who it was she stood against. "We have the building surrounded-" she went straight ahead with the direct approach, knowing he would not go for anything less. "The building is being scanned for weaknesses since we got in, it will come down soon. take the chance to come quietly with us now, and… and we can all talk about this." The subtlety of the lie was not lost on him, he appreciated it, smiling in her direction. "Please, Steve… none of us wants to lose another friend. Just come."
Tony knows what happened but he can't actually tell anyone? oh boy. :)
Before he could find out where Steve was taking him, Tony lost consciousness.
Tony shuddered, the way Steve referred to everything he did as if Tony had been at any point an accomplice to the depravity was astonishing, he was sure some psychoanalyst would have paid to have just a few moments of the conversation to listen to and dissect.
And then their first out-of-costume meeting happened, after they'd subdued Loki, and Steve was again proved right for his prejudgment of Stark. The words they exchanged were harsh, Steve tried to measure Tony up, confronted him with the knowledge he had of him from both his time as Howard's friend and from the file he had read on the man. He tried to find a shred of what his father had been in him – but the man was just too different, trying too hard to separate himself from the reputation and image of Howard Stark. That desperation was not charming.
"… Tony? You have to stick with me, don't fall asleep, you can't fall asleep. I will help you. Stay awake."
“No… no. It’s fine. I just need to rest.” He bit out just before Jarvis could repeat the question. Locking himself in the workshop seemed like a perfectly valid coping mechanism. Maybe it was time he created a deep-sea suit. A perfectly portable armor, easy to deploy underwater, complete with electrical deterrents. Yeah. That sounded like a perfectly good idea.
Steve paused, the muscles of his back tightening as he tilted his head, not yet turning to face him. "You do it like this or not at all. When I come back we can fit you with diapers so you don't soil the sheets again." Came the retort, cold and cutting. "This is about building trust, Tony. You have to follow the rules. You know how this place was designed to work."
The Avengers kept insisting that he was dangerous. Stark industries were pouring money into the efforts of lobbying against him. Thankfully, the people did not agree. It was in the news almost daily. Tony's Press conference when he came back from the dead got dissected, every detail about his looks, his words, and even the watch he wore on his wrist were supposedly meaningful enough to warrant a panel of men discussing it at length for hours, all getting it wrong. The billionaire's refusal to give further comments on the matter has given even more fuel to the conspiracy theorists.
Tony knew the suits would not stop Rogers if he wanted to get in, and then he still let Rhodey leave him at the hospital alone, trusting he would be protected by them.
The team did not discuss it again. Their thoughts on Tony's state of being were pushed back and concealed behind a renewed drive to find him, and to find Rogers before more he could cause more harm.
"Had an anxiety attack during his sleep, Colonel Rhodes brought him back and we gave him some pain relief so he could go back to sleep. He was clear-headed and asked what happened when he got sidelined in the battle, so that's some good news. At the very least we know he didn't suffer from severe head trauma… oh, sorry. I'm giving too much information aren't I." Steve opened his eyes and found Bruce looking at him hesitantly, he realized his smile had slipped away from him as he listened and how that must have looked.
He almost didn't notice the two spies sneaking their way behind him, just almost.
He couldn't stand it. He held on to the man's sweaty hand, steadying it's acute shaking just barely as he watched him scarcely managing to breathe the air provided for him, crying and attempting to scream at the pain his entirely broken body was projecting. This was everything they were afraid of – Jim and Pepper, Happy too… this scenario of having to watch Tony actively dying or in this unbearable amount of pain was, by Tony's own decree, something that should not have happened. His Armor should have protected him – that stupid, horrible…
Pepper kept quiet for a moment. “Did you have a fight with Captain Rogers?” she asked, her voice gaining a softer quality – almost apologetic, and definitely pitying. “is that why… do you need me to come over? Don’t say no.”
"I didn't take Barnes' monstrosity of a prosthesis away because I wanted revenge against you, you self-absorbed piece of shit… I did it because he hated it and wanted it replaced. But this? This right now? This is revenge. See how they like you when you are no longer a super soldier, Captain."
so there's a new chapter. that's cool.
anyone fake a heart attack? Did he get Aspirin or Nitroglycerin when he took the things he needed from the pharmacy? And lastly… what should he do?
"Mr Stark!"
“With your record, ‘nothing serious’ might as well be bleeding out on your floor. Do I need to get Happy to check up on you?”
"Technology never works when you need it." Steve didn't meet Tony's flustered stare when the dying man strained to find his blue eyes, wanting to find hope and reassurance in them that Steve was telling him the truth, that someone really was coming - they'd won and help was coming and he will get help before his chest rebels against the concept of hosting air within its vicinity, before he bleeds too much for his body to still be salvaged, before tiredness overwhelms him and it's over… he didn't really believe, but if Steve did… then he could find it possible to let a spark of hopefulness remain lit.
"Have at it, Romanoff.  See how well it works for you."
Bruce looked over Natasha's body, finding more and more evidence of the brutality with which she was struck time after time, the lacerations that were left on her body from contacting the sharp edge of the vibranium shield, and the nearly smashed bones that would be untreatable by regular means. It was a wonder that she managed to remain awake – nevertheless he met her eyes and silently asked for permission before cutting the fabric of her shirt and splinting the dangling arm. He was done just in time to see Wilson dragging Steve's inanimate form through the opened door looking bloody and beaten in a way he suspected the two spies could not have caused, and just barely notice the gun Sam held, aimed perfectly for Steve's knee for the possibility he might wake up and try to run, or worse.
"Stark! What do you think you're doing?!" Tony did not move his eyes to look at Ross.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I really don't, though…" he hissed and gasped when the thin, delicate skin where his arc reactor used to be was pinched, before Steve's hand moved to rub one of his nipples, a motion that caused Tony's entire body to convulse in revulsion.
At the very least, Tony stark was open to the idea enough to joke about it. That in itself was proof enough for Steve to consider stripping the man naked and savagely fucking him right where they stood after each time they fought. It was enough to fuel his dreams and fantasies and hours of masturbation inspired by them, and it was enough to allow himself to believe that despite their differences and initial – if somewhat lasting- dislike, he fell in love with Tony Stark.
"You should care about your appearance, Tony, it's a part of who you are." The nasty spill of soup on his lips and under his nose was cleared, and with the smell of it gone his stomach finally relaxed a little and his head cleared another bit. he heard the wheezes of his breath, erratic, not enough… he stopped listening to what Steve was saying and instead tried to summon memories of his childhood, of his mom and Jarvis and how he learned to fix and build an engine. He itched to do something, anything. But his hands were too shaky, and his mind not clear enough on the sequence of actions he used to be able to do in his sleep. Usually, his mind was a safe place to hide in, now it became just another drain on his dwindling mental strength.
Tony chuckled again, then he stopped abruptly, his head hanging and his eyes shut again, an expression Rhodey learned to recognize as representing immeasurable pain came on his features. "Platypus…" he whispered when Rhodey put away his tray and hurried to sit on the bed by his side, his arms wrapping around Tony's neck and head as he pulled his close against him, He started humming a quiet tune his mother used to sing to comfort his shivering friend. "My hands… Th-they don't… feel right…"
Tony stark was not going to survive this fight.
He didn't really deserve it, with the way he was talking about Steve and about their relationship before, but Steve wanted him to be comfortable and in as little pain as possible, so before he left the bathroom he snagged a bottle of pain-killers from the medicine cabinet. At the very least – it would help Tony sleep until he came back.
“Oh, you’re here,” Tony said. “So many fairies and sparrowmen have offered for me to sit with them, but I felt like I should share this moment with you.” A beat. “Only if you want, of course,” he corrected hastily. “It’s okay if you don’t—”
It was well known that Steve and Tony did not like each other. Well, it was kept under wraps for the most part, but it was well known when they got into a loud argument in the hallway at the beginning of senior year.
, and grabs Tony’s waist, tugging him closer.”
“Are you kidding me?” Tony sighed. “How can I have my dignity if I do that?”
“I… yes, I’d love to,” Tony said happily. “So… You and me?”
“I’m actually more interested in the mainland objects that are rumored to be in the treasure the Queen is giving the winners,” he said. “I think I could use them for tinkering. Maybe some nice parts that will go nicely in the music box I’m fixing.”
Steve must have been making another face because Tony's expression softens, and he puts a hand on Steve's shoulder.
“Oh, I’m so sorry,” Bucky says, wincing. “I thought that you had gotten here super early when I couldn’t find you! I would have never chosen Sam otherwise.”
Steve agreed with him, and they flew back, disappointed.
“M’not complaining,” he mutters into Steve’s hair. Steve laughs and tuts at him. He’s saying something else, but by the time Tony realizes that, he’s drifting off to sleep.
Steve nodded. That did seem like something Tony would do.
Tony swept through the masses. Journalists and cameras surrounded him, flashed bright lights even his sunglasses could not filter, yelled questions, so many misguided questions – and the worst of all, still- tried to touch him.
I've heavily edited the previous chapters and had the story Beta'd by the amazing Serinah and NerdCat who both had done a wonderful job and helped me a LOT, so please send them good vibes and a lot of love.
"Sir," Jarvis voice paused for a moment, waiting for the lightheaded man to tune back into reality "There seems to be a malfunction with the main entrance's doors."
- the TV's voice becoming louder to his ears as the hyper-sensitivity that came with the migraines intensified.
"That will not be necessary, Mr. Wilson. The Colonel asked me to inform you that he will be making his own way back to the city. Please report to the quinjet immediately." The AI's voice cut off after those words, leaving the team looking at each other miserably.
When he shut down again, muttering and rambling on and on Bruce decided to just let it go. He made sure once again that all the machines were properly hooked and attached, and that all the wounds were clean and freshly bandaged to his satisfaction. Tony was shaking under his hands the whole time, keeping his eyes fixated on Bruce as if to convince himself that he wasn't anyone else. He also kept talking without so much as a break to breath, only inhaling once every few moments as if trying to keep sleep away with the mere power of gibberish rambling.
"Hey, buddy." Tony's smile was of the same kind and was soon gone. "I can't believe Pepper had to see me like this again." He sighed, "couldn't this wait until my face stopped looking like mashed potatoes?"
Sam was frozen in place as well, his brow creasing in worry when he saw Tony's face change in terror, then rage.
It was a long time coming, and so Steve was just happy that it happened at all.
When Bruce got in the room the first thing he noticed was a distinct stench. The nurses didn't really get the opportunity to do some basic hygiene routines for Tony because of the amount of time required for his surgeries and recovery, he smelled like he had just finished a week-long binge in the lab without a shower, the smell of blood and sweat with the additional smell of antiseptic in the air, made it all the more unbearable. He found himself sympathizing with Ms. Song's rant for a moment before laying eyes on Steve.
It wasn't months, not yet. Weeks? Not many. Tony could still remember the names of the doctors who took care of him at the hospital, and the nurses who looked at him with both adoration when he told them tidbits of gossip and pity when his anxiety caught up with him, he hoped they were all okay, that they didn't get caught in Steve's path or tried to stop him. The thought brought him pain, and he couldn't handle more of it – not anymore.
And Rhodey's least favorite theory was the authorized override codes. Least favorite, and most probable.
"What a freaking idiot, do you think he made this place Hulk-proof too?" Clint seethed, hitting the metal wall before them with his clenched fist. His frustration showing in the lines of his face and the skin stretched across stern muscles. Natasha knew she was not showing as bad as him, but their thoughts were most likely synchronized. Tony made the place so secure that he'd doomed himself if they could not find a weak spot, if they could not get in.
Tony did not suffer quietly. "I appreciate… your unwavering belief…" his breath caught in his throat, a chain of coughs cut his words and through his chest like a butcher's knife. "In my genius." How long did it take him to say that short sentence? He heard Steve shushing him, felt his hand stroking his aching back. "Really, Steve…" using that name… it felt so personal. Who calls their rapist and kidnapper by their first name? who lets themselves be held against their bodies and cuddled by their would-be murderers? Tony's throat was too dry to swallow, and he breathed shallowly while trying to get more words out. Steve's fingers caressed his thigh while pulling him closer into leaning against him, humming to himself a song Tony could not bring himself to recognize right away.
Steve dipped his head a bit, still not smiling. "Ah… no, I mean." He sighed and looked aside. "I just wanted to hear how he was doing, I was going to ask at the nurse station and then head out to help with the reconstruction efforts some more." He looked disturbed, maybe even guilty.
It was. If he'd only paid attention and saw where Tony ended up they would've found him earlier, he wouldn't have been… Clint put fingers through his hair, then nodded back at his partner and reached to pull his hearing aid from his ear as he left the room.
Steve must have felt heart broken.
Steve is a Dick.
Tony Stark was smart. So, so smart, that he tended to rush ahead with his technology, take care of any problem the present and the future could present, while paying less attention to the past. And that was their way in.
Another doctor was there before him and took care of re-stitching the wound and changing the blood-stained bedding, it was good – because Bruce didn't think he could really handle another view of Tony covered in blood like he was when they first brought him in. One of the nurses called him over just before he got the room entrance. The door was closed – and the reason for that, as he learned from the stern, short woman in hospital scrubs, was that captain America was an over-protective
After the last phone call, Rhodes broke down. Quite literally.
He recalled, just barely, the sound of Jarvis' voice coming from outside the room – warning a stranger of getting too close to the door while being unauthorized to do so. Kids who came to visit the ward had made it a past time to mess with the empty suit, check its limits. Jarvis was good enough at distinguishing that sort of behavior from actual threats to his creator and could alert him if it was something serious. The AI did no such thing – but now, as Tony lay on the cold wooden floor and fought back sleep, he found himself wondering if that was because there was no danger or because the suit was simply disabled before it was possible to convey the message.
(Rhodey/Steve Military kink)
"You never told them you found me." Tony said, carefully, as Rhodey came to sit by his bed, holding on his lap a tray with a varied breakfast on it, for his own sake, as Tony was still being given nutrition through a tube. Tony didn't even look at the food. "They don't even know I'm alive yet... I knew you can be petty, Honey-bear, but that is…" he closed his eyes and breathed deeply, "I don't know if I should be mad or… or thank you…"
"I'm not a brainwashed Hydra asset you can 'cure', Steve… the design will not 'disillusion' me or change what you did." Steve did not turn to look at him, but he stiffened. "You raped me, you almost killed me, you hurt Rhodey… kidnapped me… Do you think telling me over and over that, you did it out of love changes anything? Do you think keeping me here would?" Steve turned to him, his blue eyes dark and his jaw gritted in anger. Tony inhaled, felt his chest constrict under the stress as the glare hit him full with murderous intent. Regardless, he said the last bit stubbornly and with added scorn. "If I
As he looked around, Clint found some evidence to the things that transpired in the room. Like a scene of a violent crime, the scents of dried fluids that should not have been coming out of a living body lingered all around, and mixed with them were scents of soap and shaving cream and, the worst one yet – the smell of sex. Clint nearly gagged when he smelt, then saw the old piss and puke stained bundle of linen that was cast off to the side of the room, and the sheets on the bed seemed to be in no better condition – stained with dry blood, some newer than he expected to find, and bits of what could have once been some kind of liquidated food, as if someone drank it straight from the can with no regard to what actually got in their mouth and what ended up on the sheets or the floor, there were smears of the stuff near the pillow and the middle section of the bed, indicating someone had actually lay in this mess for perhaps days or even weeks, and when Clint found a small cabinet filled with clean linen and sheets, the terrifying realization that it was left like this on purpose downed on him like a sack filled with rocks.
"Listen, Steve…" he began before realizing he wasn't sure what he could say. If he chases Steve out now the man might just throw himself into the reconstruction efforts and law enforcements out there and not get the rest he needed. Bruce knew just how much guilt-ridden Avengers could fuck up their lives, and he wasn't comfortable with letting Steve go away like that. "How about I tell the nurses you can stay in the room while they do their duties? They would still need to pull out the curtain, but you will be able to be here and intervene if anything nefarious happened." Ms. Song was going to deck him for even suggesting it.
Bruce took in a deep and long breath to sooth the boiling rage that flooded his mind.
He could not find a speck of happiness at the man being alive. It was weird, he knew it was. He thought about it for hours, trying to run through his mind other people close to him who died or were otherwise lost to him, and he found that each time a pain awakened in his chest. He felt the same ache when he looked at Tony's living yet broken body.
Other than the miserable sounding sobs, Tony didn't respond.
"Jim is-" Sam started, looking at the cabin with troubled eyes, "I should go get him-"
So, he didn’t fight when Steve removed his dirty clothes and covered both his casted hands with nylon before he made him step into the shower together with him, he didn't say a thing when warm water licked his bruised skin as Steve held him against his broad chest and murmured words he didn't want to hear in his ear, nor when his hands moved to settle on his hips, lower than where they normally went.
When the man turned nearly unresponsive to his and Rhodey's soft conversation Bruce nodded at the other man and stood up. He showed Rhodey the distress buttons for the nurses and urged him to call him if Tony woke up or if anything out of the ordinary happened, then left the room and took a deep breath, releasing it slowly.
Once he was in the right mind-set it became easier to just go along with it, ignore the small pained sounds Tony made and pretend they're sounds of pleasure, a proof of him wanting this as well. he pushed against the body under him and then lifted Tony's thighs, pulling them to circle his waist and kissed the lax throat of the body under him again as his fingers fondled and squeezed at the man's balls. A moment when he wondered if he'd be able to arouse his friend in such a state caused him slight anguish until he felt the limp cock firming under his fingers, although slowly. It was all the confirmation he needed to go ahead with this, the knowledge that Tony wanted this too, found what was happening good, too.
"Oh Tony…" Steve's eyes softened when Tony finally managed to move one hand enough to grasp on the wrist of the hand at the base of his neck. He leaned down above him, each of his eyes meeting Tony's with a noticeable frown. He sighed – or groaned as his other hand moved up and down Tony's thigh. "I was afraid you'd be broken now; you know? I thought you wouldn't try to fight anymore. That you'd just give up?" His voice was soft but had an undertone of rancor, and Tony couldn't linger on his words because his mind was going so fuzzy and wrong with the lack of air. "That'd be just the worst, wouldn't it? It would be the least Stark thing you can do. He never gave up, did he? So how could
Steve and Tony remained alone.
Rhodey took his hand, squeezing it to ground him, and Tony's eyes found his again. "I love you, but you are making this so hard." He whispered. "It's getting too damn hard, Tones."
Jarvis remained silent for a moment or so, which was weird. Like he was thinking about his answer. "That information is within a file you are not granted access to, Doctor Banner." he finally said, "I have determined from previous interactions between you and the team that revealing this information to you will not benefit Sir's safety and may in fact harm it."
The rest of the team cares.
"An attack?" she asked, not turning to Steve, just waiting to hear the news as he would deliver them. She was trying lately – after being proven wrong a few times – not to jump to quick conclusions. At that moment it wasn't really working. "Was it Hydra?"
"He doesn't remember you" he said as he passed by him, the corners of his mouth curled downside in a frown. "For his sake, I hope he never would have the misfortune of remembering."
It was a dumb excuse, certainly not one his intelligent friend would accept, certainly not when his voice turned quiet mid-sentence.
He was convinced that as soon as Tony saw his new look, he would feel better, the bitterness and the mean words would go away and be replaced by bashful tameness and awe, and they would move on the next part of the night Steve had planned.
Tony had laughed with them, provided his own material to the team repartee regarding his and Steve's supposed relationship and teased the old-school Captain for his chaste nature as he made lewd comments, he played a game of Gay Chicken Steve had no intention of losing.
, he wanted to wake up – thought the pain should have made it happen already but it didn't and Tony still couldn't believe that anything he saw was real.
"Mute." Tony whispered, raising a hand to massage his temple as the AI's words cut off. "Sorry, bud… just… just do what I told you to do, okay? Direct all resources there."
Steve smiled as he left the facility, thinking back to all those horrible things Tony had said before, he could understand how Tony, as insecure in general, but probably particularly about the relationship Steve was trying to build with him, would become antagonized. It was okay – not a setback of any kind. They would get through this phase and mutual understanding would prevail. The road from there to a loving, clichéd relationship that no one could challenge with their ugly lies was just a step further down that road.
Tony never understood why. But neither did he complain. Having a real friend who actually cared about him for the first time of his entire life – not counting robots an AIs – was not something he could afford to complain about, even if he did make a good show of doing just that.
Other people started gathering around the bed, all smiling happily at Tony's apparent recovery – and the man immediately put on a mask, hiding his pain and smiling at them as well, even as his hand never let Rhodey go and kept squeezing for warmth and reassurance.
"He was taken for surgery yesterday; they have not brought him back here since." She said quietly, "I was about to go to the nurse station to have them call a doctor with answers when you came in."
“So, it’s just us and a few others?”
“Unscramble me and you will see the name of a well-known tree.” Tony frowned. “I see you can make the words ‘birch’, ‘oak’, and ‘cherry’, but I don’t know how to figure out the rest of the letters.”
liking
“So. Hey.”
"Ah," said Tony. He wasn't sure what else to say.
“Friends.”
Later that night, while the light-talent fairies were setting up for the show, Steve arrived at the meadow. He caught someone waving at him out of the corner of his eye. It was Tony, sitting on an oak tree stump with a plate of neverberry cake on his lap.
“Oh finally, someone here for the clue,” said Tootles, pulling out a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket. “‘Go straight to the Fairy Circle,’” he read. “‘And when you see me, please stand on your head and oink like a pig. Sincerely, Queen Clarion.’”
“That’s kind of mean,” Steve mumbles.
"Fine," Tony said. Steve raised an eyebrow at his curt tone, and Tony took a breath and attempted to calm down. "I'm doing this because Mr. Coulson wants me to, though."
By the time they’ve reached the theater, many other fairies were there. Tony scrunched his nose. He was not looking forward to pushing past so many fairies to find the clue. By his side, Steve brightened and grabbed his hand.
Steve decided to drop the subject right when he spotted a wooden sign jutting out from the side of the cliff. “I found the mine,” he said. “Not many others seem to be here. Let’s hurry inside!"
“I found the real clue, in the Queen’s handwriting!”
Steve and Tony sighed in relief as it left the clearing. Tony was still clinging to Steve. They looked at each other and burst into laughter.
Steve simply blinked at him. “Why me?”
“I’m in love with you,” Steve blurts out. That’s a little more straightforward than he intended, but he hates seeing Tony like this.
“Hello Tootles,” Steve said politely. Tony impatiently flew in circles beside him. They didn’t have time for small talk!
Tony looks like he’s been struck with an asteroid on the head. He’s silent for a moment, and then he starts snickering. Soon, he’s full on laughing, bent over, until he straightens before the undone tie can slip off his neck.
“What in Neverland was
Steve stirs above him, pushing his nose into Tony’s neck.
“It’s funny,” he began, “If you told me this is where I’d end up at the end of the day, I would have called you crazy.”
“I’m going to kiss you now.”
“Ah, Steve and Tony!” She spoke. “You’ve made it to the end. Do you have anything to say to me?”
"Great," said Steve, whose all-around charm was not enough to hide the dread in his face.
“Psh, Steve and I aren’t together.”
It took a while for them to make their way over, but once they arrived at the tree, they saw one of the lost boys, Tootles.
No! No. The less he thinks about that, the better.
"I'm sorry, Shellhead. Were you talking?"
Sam whistled. “Wow. I’ve never known you, of all people, to oversleep.”
Thor excuses himself to talk to some other attendees and claps him on the back... and, well, Tony has already left him breathless, so Steve has to focus very hard to make sure he's still standing.
Steve was suddenly acutely aware that they were standing in the middle of a mine, holding hands. He felt his glow turn bright orange and dropped Tony’s hand—only for a squeaking sound to emit down the tunnel, which made Tony startle and grab his hand again.
Tony’s face is so close, Steve can see the reflection of the stars in his eyes.
"That would be me," a resigned voice said from the back of the classroom. Tony didn't even realize they weren't alone; he had just assumed everyone had filed out by the time he started talking to Mr. Coulson. Tony squinted and found that...
They finally reached the rock and flew to the top, where words were painted with fading berry juice. A few fairies must have gotten here before them, after all. Steve read the words out loud.
Steve ignored Bucky and Sam’s bickering as he saw Queen Clarion waving at him out of the corner of his eye. He quickly excused himself to meet with the Queen.
Tony, but sometimes when he was done sketching fairies in the studio and Tony was one of them, he would trace the outline of his jawline on the paper. But that’s certainly
Tony crossed his arms. “There is… a zebra hickory tree,” he said. He then brightened. “Of course! The tree by the shore!”
Steve’s glow turned a delicious cherry red. That’s why Tony loves messing with him: it’s fun, and he’s so expressive. “Did you just imply that I’m slow?”
He wrapped his arm around Tony’s shoulder and drew him closer as they watched the show.
Tony. Of course, with the rotten day he’s having, he would get Tony as his partner.
answer.” Steve opened his mouth to argue, but Tony waved his hand. “I never said it was a
“Yeah. Maybe we should. Get along, I mean. Friends?”
“I’m not dating Steve,” says Tony. He’s standing at the kitchen counter, glaring at the percolator as if that would bring him coffee faster. His team (Tony and Steve’s team!) is behind him, pretending not to listen. How dare they corner him at 8 in the morning and pester him about his non-existent love life?
Steve pushed that thought aside and journeyed on until he reached a fork in the path.
“I can explain,” Steve starts, but he really doesn’t know how. He’s faced countless threats before but telling Tony how he feels is the scariest thing to him. Honestly, he has no idea how Tony hasn’t figured it out, seeing that half the galaxy knows he’s—
Rhodey wiped tears from his eyes, gritted his teeth to rid himself of the remainders of rage and self-hatred. This has been just like Afghanistan. The same kind of breakdown. If anyone saw him, they would be mortified that a Colonel in the USAF would act in such a childish way. He was not wearing his uniform, but he was defiling them with his behavior no less for that.
business keeping them apart. He was at a clear disadvantage, and his still-forming strategy was suffering for it.
It's my birthday today, so you are getting a new chapter!
He calls Doctor Garcia on the way to the tower, asking her to keep an eye if she can. Then he rings up Rhodes, letting him know he was coming to sleep at the tower. Rhodes asks if he can pick up some takeout on the way, clearly withholding his many questions about his friend's condition until Bruce is rested and fed, and Bruce is grateful.
She didn't expect herself to end up in the hospital with a carton full of donuts in a bag carried by her casted hand, and three cups of coffee in her healthy one, plus an extreme case of nausea from hospital smells; it wasn't the place where she wanted to be, yet her legs just carried her there. She didn't like feeling so out of control, she didn't imagine any of the others felt any better.
"Then take the job." Tony cut him, smiling. "You are right, you can't be here to save me all the time. I'm a risk-taking idiot with a death wish. There are more important things to do in the world."
He took him to where the breathing machine stood and placed the mask over his mouth, watching as small bouts of steam covered the clear plastic as Tony took in the oxygen before letting it out again, nearly invisibly breathing. "Call Pepper, tell her… but no one else. No avengers, no press… just Pepper." He whispered as he sat down and placed Tony's head in his lap. "Tell her where we are going, but she shouldn't come over, not yet."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Great! I'll tell you what, I was going to arrange a bed for the Colonel because he simply refuses to leave Tony's side, and frankly – the man had been awake for a lot more hours than I would personally recommend… if you get him to go home, take a shower and sleep a night, you can have that bed instead."
The man seemed to have relaxed a bit, at least his nails no longer bit crescents into his palm anymore. He didn't look at her as he set the suit to sentinel mode, nodded to himself approvingly and left the room. Natasha could hear him demanding the location of the room where Tony's surgeries were performed, she felt bad for the nurse.
"This query has been made by Ms. Romanoff for her own investigation into the matter, I'm afraid I cannot divulge any further information without her permission."
"I would respect his wishes and get the hell out." Rhodes finally gritted under his breath, and Steve, judging by how the man tensed at his own words and closed his eyes to leave himself vulnerable, knew he wasn't being honest with himself, not at all.
The exhaustion roaming through all his limbs convinced him that sleep, rather than food or a bath to wash off sand and salt from his skin, was everything he needed. In fact, he could barely keep his eyes open and his legs dragged under him as he tried to get himself over to his bedroom. Soon, he gave up and practically passed out on the sofa, with the towel around his hips slipping away to the floor and revealing his nakedness, but he could care less about his nakedness. He was just so tired, and it was his home. He could sleep naked on the sofa if that’s what he wanted to do. In the blink of an eye, his eyelids dropped closed before he managed to lean down comfortably on the leather-clad surface of the sofa.
The voice of the television continued to rumble when the door suddenly opened. Steve did not expect visitors, subconsciously, he prepared himself for a fight as he turned to watch Sam come in with a large carton box in his hands. placated, Steve smiled at him in gratitude, then frowned when Sam physically recoiled and looked away from him as he put it down on the kitchen table.
And he was hurting her. Like he hurt Rhodey… like he hurt Tony so many times over the last few weeks.
Next, an EMP could have shut down the suits. It'd have to be military grade, and capable of taking down an arc reactor, and those were rather rare and big. And again, Jarvis would have been able to alert him to it before it became an issue.
"You just want me to tell you how amazingly skilled you are at creating things that risk your life." Rhodey chided in good spirit, "That cabin was impossible to find, Tones, seriously. You gotta let your enemies get at least a clue if you want things to be interesting… and then getting in, if Natasha hadn't been touched by a divine spirit of wisdom and sent in the robot through the vents, it wouldn't have happened…" his voice turned soft. "Natasha and Barton managed to knock him out, I think it was Natasha who finally did him in with those electrified batons you made for her, I didn't bother to check when I came in."
“I am the place where you go to visit any other place in the world.” Steve frowned. “How can you be in two places at once?”
Tony smiled shyly, something Steve was unaware he was able to do.
Tony looked at him incredulously. “That’s how we’ll get lost!” Is he… shaking?
“You don’t get it, Steve,” Tony sighed. “I was trapped in a cave once. I spent days in there, without light. I was so lucky that Rhodey was able to rescue me.”
“Oh. Well, that’s okay. Plenty of fairies don’t like being—”
“I told you, I never hated you!” Steve exclaimed. He looked at Tony’s face.
“My goodness,” Tony said in between bouts of laughter, “I think we worried ourselves to death for no reason.”
High school is absolutely awful. All those movies lied to him.
"Actually, there is a problem," replied Tony.
Steve, offended, turned to Tony as they waited for the fairies in front of them to collect their clue. “Well, I did oversleep, but I’m not at fault for you
“Shut up, Sam!” Steve knows his glow is a bright orange.
Tony frowned. “Which way should we go?”
“That’s because I liked you,” Tony blurted out. “Oh, dear. I didn’t mean to say that out loud. Can you forget I said that?”
Tony looked up at the sound of Steve’s voice and nodded. “Oh. Yes, of course.”
“Really, little old me?”
"Just checking if you were okay," says Tony. "You were frowning earlier, and I thought this was supposed to be a happy occasion."
“No, of course not,” Tony said with a grin. “I
Tony went to interject, but then stopped himself. Steve had been nothing but kind to him all day. He owed his friend enough to listen to him.
“What do you mean?”
, Steve thought,
To participate in the fairy treasure hunt, he had to find a partner. And because he was late, there was probably no one left.
“He’s not so bad,” said Steve. Bucky stared at him.
Hope grows in Steve’s chest. “You do?”
He was late, and to the very event that he was most looking forward to! At this rate, he wouldn’t even find a partner in time. He hopped out of his soft dandelion-stuffed bed, and zipped over to his door, nearly knocking over his bucket of raspberry red paint in his haste. After grabbing his trusty leaf messenger bag and fastening his large brush to his belt, Steve flew out the door as fast as he could.
"Great, you're on board. Steve?"
He isn’t dating Steve. He’s not even in love with Steve. Steve is just a reliable friend. God knows, Tony needs more of those.
Tony sighed and followed Steve out the back of the theater and into the morning sky. Of course, the treasure hunt would lead them underground.
Tony smiled to himself, and Steve found himself growing defensive.
"Peachy," said Tony.
There was a chittering noise that Tony seemed unnerved by. “I… can’t tell if that was sinister or not.”
"—eve. Steve?"
Tony huffs. “I can’t believe you got so sappy at a wedding,” he says, and places his hand on Steve’s chest.
"No, no! That's not it," Steve says desperately.
Steve’s glow flushed a pale orange with embarrassment. “I… might have overslept.”
Rhodey holds his hands up in the air. “Alright, I’ll go,” he says. “But this conversation is not over.”
“Mmm. Go away, Rhodey.”
Steve looks at him with an odd expression that he might call... exasperated? ... fond? And pats his shoulder. Tony kicks his legs up on the loveseat and drops his head onto the armrest so Steve can lay down on his chest.
“Tony!”
Steve had gotten misty-eyed when Teddy and Billy had exchanged vows. It made him think of his own life, and the man he'd loved for years, and how he would never—
“Who is it?” Steve repeated, louder. The leaves parted, and…
“What’s got you so upset?” asks Steve, sitting next to him.
“Ah, I know,” Steve crowed with excitement. “Where the Summer Grove meets the Autumn Forest! I’ve painted the color changes in the leaves dozens of times.”
Except Tony can’t
Steve, eager to get Tony out of the dark cavern, quickly led him outside.
How did that Joan Baez song go again?
Sitting in the second to last row was Steve Rogers, the captain of the football team. His large frame looked almost comical crammed into the tiny desk, and his arms were folded as he looked straight into Tony's eyes.
Steve didn’t exactly hate Tony, and Tony didn’t exactly hate Steve (at least, he hoped so). They just butt heads sometimes. And by sometimes, he means
Queen Clarion smiled and shook her head as the other fairies laughed. Every pair that arrived had made the same mistake, and none of them had gotten the right clue. She saw Steve and Tony and brightened.
“The experience,” Steve admitted. “It’s nice to have a day off and get to explore. But also, now I’m
No way.
“Okay.”
“Mmm?”
When Steve and Tony made it to the middle of the Fairy Circle, they saw the Queen. In front of her was Clint and Thor, balanced on their head, oinking. Steve winced. He was relieved he was sensible enough not to believe Peter’s prank.
Tony whirled around, internally groaning. He just wanted to go home, damn it. He looked around for the teacher and found Mr. Coulson, a calculus teacher, waving his hand outside his door.
“Hey, watch it—”
“I’m trying to sleep, Shellhead,” he says. Tony can feel his low voice rumbling on his chest.
"Tony! Can you come see me in my classroom for a minute?"
“I saw that you were missing a partner, and I have just the fairy for you,” she said. Steve straightened his shoulders. He might have a chance after all! The Queen smiles and steps aside, to reveal—
“The others,” replies Tony, rolling his eyes. “They think we’re dating.”
“I know,” Steve groans. “Of all days, too! Now everyone has a partner… except me.”
Steve chuckles. “Of course we aren’t.”
“Oh my god,” he says, loud enough to startle Tony awake. “Not dating, my ass!”
Tony stared at the paper, dismayed. “Oh dear. I guess we should return to the Fairy Circle, anyways.”
all day! Where did they come from?!”
“I don’t!” Steve exclaimed, horrified. “We just… don’t agree sometimes, and I suppose I’ve been making assumptions about you. But maybe it’s time we tried to get along.”
Tootles threw the paper at them and ran off towards the cove. “Knock yourselves out,” he called over his shoulder. Steve picked up the paper.
“No, wait,” Steve said. “May I see the paper, please?”
The bell knocked him out of his thoughts, and he shoved his notebook in his backpack before standing up to leave.
think about it, because Steve was hovering next to him, reading a clue with a frown.
“Pull that stunt at the end, yeah,” said Sam, looking particularly mischievous. “I didn’t expect you two to be best buddies.”
When they pull apart, Steve can’t help but gaze fondly into Tony’s eyes.
“We should hurry,” Steve urged, “or we’ll lose our lead.”
Tony begrudgingly agreed and followed Steve backstage. He rustled through a few set pieces. There was nothing on the palm tree or watermill standees. He saw a shine and a flutter of paper, and his heart dropped.
“To be honest, I was just… maybe a
A raccoon walked out.
thing.”
"Hey," he says, "I'm here for you, alright?"
"What can I do for you, Mr. Coulson? The next month's extra credit math puzzle isn't out yet, is it?"
Tony sighs. "Okay, Winghead, I didn't want to bum out the wedding, but what's going on? You keep looking at me like... I don't know, you're upset with me, or something." He turns his eyes down. Oh god.
Tony cleared his throat and looked around. “Where is the real clue, though?”
“Who is it?” he called out. No one responded.
“Well, we talked,” Steve said, suddenly self-conscious. “I just… He’s… nice, I just needed to give him another chance. He’s super smart, too! I would have never won without him, if he didn’t—”
being the last one without a partner! What kept you from arriving early, anyway?”
Just a few more months to go. Just a few more months, and Tony can leave this hellhole, and then never see anyone else again.
“I know what you mean,” said Tony. “I’m just glad you don’t hate me anymore.”
“And whatever animals are here, but I haven’t got a clue what kinds. Squirrels? Finches?”
Of course! The greeting Tony had been rambling about, back at the courtyard! Steve now remembered how he cut Tony off and winced. He felt awful about that now.
Tony smiled and dropped his head onto Steve’s shoulder. Steve knew he had a big, stupid grin on his face.
you? You’re kind, charming, and handsome. Also, seriously, why do you have such large muscles? Last time I checked, you
“Hey, Tony?”
“We aren’t,” says Tony mulishly. “We’re just... bros that cuddle.”
Today is the day of the great fairy treasure hunt! After the fairies had protected the Hollow from a particularly persistent kettle of hawks, Queen Clarion had set up a treasure hunt. Steve knew his friends were particularly competitive; Natasha had been arguing her fast flying-talent abilities would help her get to the clues faster than Clint, who said his scouting-talent prepared him for finding clues (Steve, whose most impressive skill was painting detailed landscapes, had stayed silent).
Tony turned, pleasantly surprised. “Really?”
“Oh please,” Tony scoffed, “You already know I’m never on time. But I was researching at the library and didn’t watch the clock well enough. You know, busy memorizing the map and anything that could help. Did you know that the greeting, ‘fly with you’ originally was, ‘I would happily—'”
Rhodey splutters indignantly. “How is that even possible? Dude, you go on outings with Steve at night— like, dates!” Tony glances at him over his shoulder and huffs.
"Yeah, yeah. Quite a bit is on the line."
There was a silence, then Steve gathered every ounce of courage he had.
Tony made a sudden noise like he was having an epiphany. “I would happily fly with you,” he said, “to the farthest reaches of Never Arbor and to the top of Torth Mountain if you asked.”
All the fairies went to chatter amongst themselves, and Tony flew off—no doubt, he had spotted Rhodey or Pepper.  Steve found Bucky standing with a very grumpy Sam and flew over with a big grin.
“What?”
“A raccoon!” Steve shook his head. “Aren’t we silly.”
Soon it is just him and Tony, standing together in the middle of a large crowd of superheroes. The sky is a fading violet and Steve can see millions of twinkling stars. Hulking and Wiccan picked quite a gorgeous spot for a wedding.
“I didn’t peg you for one who was so interested in lunch with the Queen in her private gazebo, jewels, and treasure.”
Yeah, that wasn't going to work.
"A most joyous union," Thor says loudly, knocking Steve out of his reverie. He blinks and looks at Thor, flushing when Thor looks at him knowingly.
Tony’s normally pristine jacket was a bit muddy and rumpled. “Yeah,” he breathed. “Thank you.”
Rhodey raises his eyebrows so high, Tony worries they’ll fly right off his face.
“I exercise early in the morning,” Steve said faintly. He’s still shocked. Tony huffed and turned towards the light slow.
in it, and I have a bit of a competitive streak.”
“Of course,” Steve replied, and noticed a worn paper fluttering down. The clue!
“Not relevant,” Steve interjected, plucking up an envelope. He didn’t want to listen to Tony speak more than he had to.
“Shh! I bet it’s in the props. They’re grouped by play. I bet the play that the next clue is hidden in is where the next hint is!”
Steve looked at him, surprised. Where had that come from?
“Besides,” quipped Tony, “I doubt Queen Clarion would make us oink like a pig. Honestly, I’m just relieved I don’t have to do that.”
“I can’t tell if you’re disappointed in me, or have I done something to offend you? What did I do recently? The new suit I gave Ree—”
Tony nods, and steps closer to him, tentatively reaching for his shoulder, as if asking to touch him. Steve grins, giddy that he’s
“Are you okay?”
Tony marches on. “We’ve cuddled before, in MIT. I mean like, yeah, I was drunk and sad, and you wanted to cheer me up, but...” he tilts his head and scrunches his nose as if that finishes his thought. “See? Not dating.”
The bushes keep rustling—and it’s a large rustle.
“I knew it,” he exclaimed triumphantly, “This isn’t the real clue. All the words are spelled wrong.” Peter Pan must have left Tootles to prank the fairies!
Tony concentrated hard. “Oh,” he crows, “the Fairy Tale Theater! They always say they will transport you to another world before their plays.” He smirked at Steve. “Lucky you have someone fast to pull someone as slow as you are along.”
“Oh, splinters,” said Steve, as he arrived at the courtyard. It was packed! Fairies were already grouped in pairs. He desperately looked around to find his friends. Natasha was already deep in conversation with Bruce. Clint was gesturing wildly at Thor, whose countenance was more serious than Steve had ever seen it.
"Why else would you be staring at me like that?" Tony throws his hands into the air, exasperated.
“Tell that to Rhodey. He accosted me in my own kitchen before I’ve had my coffee!”
Steve elbowed him. “Oh, shush. You’re smart, and everyone loves you, and you always made fun of me.”
