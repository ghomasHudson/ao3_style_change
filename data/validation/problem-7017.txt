hi! again, sorry for taking so long, i write whenever i have the time, but it's hard with finals and stuff. however, i've been writing a lot for the last couple of days, so here's a new chapter!
At ten p.m, just like he had planned Harry suited up, trying to not think about how wrong it felt to be wearing a slightly altered version of his father’s suit (the suit he’d
As to why Peter runs away: don't even worry, it'll be explained. And you guys may like it, Peter's reason behind his outburst.
God, sorry, I'm a little bit of a mess. I wanted to post last Saturday, but... well, it was a Saturday, and I was out 'til late and I had the chapter unfinished.
Sorry, I know this was later than usual, but I was with a few friends, watching Eurovision lmao, so it got pretty late. Anyway... enjoy the chapter!
The last part of this short story is here. I'm already working on the next, which will have two parts (I've already finished the first one!), and, ladies and gentlemen... I'm finally doing the Field Trip. I'm nervous as hell about it lmao, but I hope you guys enjoy it. Anyway, that's the next chapter! Enjoy this one
I'm officially on summer break, and I've written a lot more! So you can count on more one-shots, and also more chapters on the third work of this AU! I think I will publish something on that story this week! Now, enjoy the chapter! Is one of my favorites, and quite the wild ride!
View is having a field trip about it, so they can be thanking you whenever this is over. However, Jay, this one is not like the rest, and we both know it”
Omg I've had the busiest week... with my city's festivities and projects and a cute af one-shot I've been writing.... which hopefully you guys will read between this and next week! Anyway, I'm glad I wrote this piece last week haha. Enjoy!
“Where is Peter?” She asked, her tone demanding and unforgiving, meaning she wanted just the truth “. We saw him collapse on Buck’s arms, where is he, is he okay?”
Gosh, I landed not two hours ago haha, but I'm at the hotel now and I have wifi, so I can post! I'm writing the final two chapters, almost done with 65 (this one is technically the 64), and I'm kind of emotional. Not so much because I'm doing the sequel, but wow... it's been an amazing ride. Anyway, enjoy! (PS: the chapter is kinda long, hehe)
PLEASE leave a comment so i can know what you guys thought of all this changes and revelations! i would love to hear it
However, that didn’t help Tony, who couldn’t do anything but look helplessly as the doctor worked on Peter - who was looking worse than the engineer had imagined, and hoped, looking way too pale to be considered even alive. Steve and Bucky arrived a few minutes later, stopping dead on their tracks when they saw Peter laying there, chest barely moving with soft and weak takes of air.
And in order to do so, the young businessman had called for all of his allies- or, better said, employees. Admittedly, he didn’t like to be in the same room as them or to have them in his property, but the job was the job, right? And deep down Harry knew they were the best in what they did… or at least, the best he could get.
NOW, on to the important question: so, a few of you lovely readers have asked about infinity war. I said a while ago that I wasn't planning on doing it, mainly because it'd differ from the storyline I originally imagined. However, now that I've thought about it, there's a possibility IW makes an appearance. I don't know how it would be, or how similar to the movie I'd make it, but I've been thinking about it. If I do it, however, it would be a sequel. So, a separate book from this one. Same background story, just focused on IW. Now, the question is: do you guys want me to do the sequel? Because, if so, then I'd seriously think about doing it.
“Growing up is inevitable” Peter murmured “. Even if we subconsciously don’t want to. Isn’t that so?”
Hi! Sorry, I know it's a little bit late, but I got home now from visiting Niagara Falls with a few friends. I'd already been there with my family, but it was fun to go again with friends, lmao. If you go, try to do the boat attraction. It's the best thing, I swear.
I really hope you guys enjoyed the chapter! We're getting closer to the end, but don't worry: there's a sequel! And actually, I'm thinking about doing a shorter work that would consist of short stories that happen in this AU. What do you think? Would you guys read it? Well, that and the sequel, of course.
Sorry, it took me so long to upload. Truth is, I haven't had the time to write much. My Uni seemingly understood the lockdown as another chance to give us more work, so I spend my days trying to not stress myself out sick. And, after spending all day on the computer it's hard to write, mainly because my eyes and head hurt like crazy.
Another thing: I'll probably keep these hours, for posting. I'm in another time-zone, than usual, and I'm going to stay here for a while, so yeah. Chapters are going to be posted around this time from now on.
“Wait” the superhero murmured, looking between his parents with a look of surprise in his face “. It’s my birthday?”
Also, if you haven't read the A/N at the beginning, I also want to say that, on the work (situated in this AU) where I'll do one-shots, you can also ask for a story that would take something that already happened and change it! For example, let's say you guys want to know what would've happened if they didn't search for Peter when he was fifteen; things like that.
He suffered from blue balls on a regular basis but didn’t push his luck. He knew when Steve was ready they would get to that step, slow and steady. Though, Tony couldn’t help but wonder what he would have to do to try and convince Steve to try new things.
“Steve, buddy, what's up?” Tony breathed out, with all the air pushing from his chest. Steve marveled at the fact that Tony, even when held immobile in a questionable situation, could still sound so casual.
“You see Tony… I had a lot of time to figure out what I liked about sex. And because we were constantly moving, there wasn’t really a huge opportunity for sweet nothings. I found out, I was A-okay with that.” Steve smirked as Tony started to fall apart for him. He could feel Tony’s cock between their pants, pushing with every shift of Tony’s hips. Steve moved close to brunette's ear. Whispering his next words softly. “I want you… I want your mouth on me. Sucking me down your throat until you're not even sure you can take it. I want to open you up… lick into you, feel you tight around my fingers before I split you open on my cock. And I’m not small Tony,” Steve then added his own thrust to Tony’s rhythm. Rocking the smaller man up the wall while keeping his arms stationary. Let him feel the outline of his length as they pressed together tightly “But you won't mind will you?”
Tony gets it now, feels that sensation of being controlled start to settle over him like a blanket as he grabs his own forearms.
Tony pulls back long enough to look up at Steve and see the heat in his eyes before he pulls steadily at his pants. Steve tilts his hips up, taking the weight on his legs so they are free to slide down.
I'm not dead!! But I am rusty, so ya know. Take this with a grain of salt and hopefully enjoy nothing but blowjob!!
“Ok, care to take a few steps back so we can talk this out. Maybe let me get a drink first?” Tony attempted to shift away, but Steve was having none of that.
It's a lot, it's so fucking much and Tony loves it. He runs his tongue along the bottom before pulling back enough to focus some attention at the head. Steve shifts in his chair. Let's out a breath from deep inside,
“Others… what others?” Tony stuttered out. His breath now picking up speed as Steve pressed his thigh up, prompting Tony to start rocking his hips. Steve was closer now, lips inches away from Tony’s as he spoke.
He starts lightly, with the head and a few inches of the shaft, but Tony can feel him speeding up. Staying more in hos mouth than out. Keeping it deep as he forces more and more inside. Tony's getting dizzy with it.
Steve finally let's go of his hair and lets Tony's head rest against his thigh. Tony's grabs at his calf, needing to ground himself. He feels floaty, but also like he was just wrung dry. He doesn't want to move, and only opens his eyes when he feels Steve's finger drag across the come on his face. His lids are heavy when he looks up and looks onto blue. Steve is starring, smiling, looking at Tony like he is the whole world in that moment.
and lets his head tip back slightly. He's still keeping Tony in his view though. Not looking away for even a moment.
Tony finally grabs Steve's thumb with his teeth, and sucks it inside. Taking a deep hard sucks as he whines and meets Steve's eyes.
"Last chance..." And of course Steve would offer him another chance. Another opportunity to say this is too much and that they need to stop. Tony feels some tension he didn't know he was holding melt out of his frame. He can practically feel his eyes soften as he looks at the blonde. Fucking Captain America, the Ultimate Good Guy. His... Ultimate Good Guy.
Tony let's out a whine, shifting on his knees in frustration. He goes to open his eyes, wanting to express his feelings to Steve, but gets no chance. This time when Steve pulls back and reenters its fast but consistent. Non stop, pushing, pushing, pushing till he gets the last few inches into Tony's mouth. The blonde is deep in his throat.
He barley hears Steve's broken low  "Come on, come on Come on. Come for me Tony!" Before he comes. He feels fingers in his hair pulling him back as shock after shock flies through him. Come panting his hand as he practically screams around the length leaving his mouth.
“I can last for hours, Tony. Fucking you fast and hard, never slowing down, never stopping. You think you can keep up with that? I’m not so sure. What's the point of fucking if your partner passes out before you’re done?” Steve could see what his words did to Tony. The dilated pupils, making only a sliver of color show in Tony’s dark eyes. The sheen of sweat gathering at the brunette's temples, matching his panting like he had just run a mile.
His name is Anthony “Tony” Stark, genius, billionaire, playboy (former), philanthropist. He takes pride in his title, his company, his inventions, and his intelligence. Yet he has never been so confused in his entire life. The cause for his confusion is the…, not love, Tony Stark doesn't do love. Instead, it is the American dream himself, Steve Rogers, his current…partner. Their relationship started off pretty simple. If it could be called a relationship, because god knows Tony doesn't call it that. Casual glances, easy flirting lead to a whirlwind of modern meets 40’s era courting.
"Mhmmmm" Tony's responding moan is strong, vibrating through Steve and causing him to tense before pulling back, only to plunge back in. Tony gets lost in it. Doing his best to take it as Steve fucks his mouth, his throat, mind getting hazy. He loves this, loves sucking dick, and fuck he may love Steve.
After Tony's perception of Captains America's sexual prefrences were thourghly corrected, it was time for him to put his money where his mouth is.
“I’ll take that as a yes. I bet you love big hard cocks, Tony. Actually, I know you do. I’ve seen some of your tapes.” Steve chuckled as he said it, the sound reverberating through his chest making their shirts rub harshly across Tony’s nipples, causing him to cry out.
“Steve… I want” Tony panted as he hitched his leg up pulling Steve closer in for more friction. Tilting his head up Tony caught Steve’s lips. This kiss was sweet, but only for a moment. With a teasing flick of his tongue, Tony prompted Steve to open his lips. Pushing his into the blonde’s mouth Tony found a brief moment of solid footing. This he and Steve had done, french kisses were long ago crossed off their list. But the familiarity soon vanished as Steve deepened the kiss. Taking over control and making sure Tony knew he was the one leading.  With a breath, Steve caught Tony’s lower lip between his teeth. Worrying it a bit before pulling back, seeing that it now resembled the same color as the flush of Tony’s cheeks.
Steven leans back in the chair and moves to slide his briefs away. He wastes no time grabbing himself and giving a few slow, teasing, pumps.
Steve is in control, and that make Tony so hard he swears he can feel what's left of his blood rush to his cock. He's been hard the whole time, didn't think he could get any harder in all honesty. Yet here he is, pressing tightly against his jeans, wishing he had had the fore thought to take them off.
"Fuck... Tony..." Steve's voiced is recked, breath coming fast. He's starting to hunch over where he stands, fingers flexing on the back of Tony's neck.
"You'll get what you want Tony. You'll get everything remember. All of it." With that dark statement Steve grabs the back of Tony's neck and stands from the chair. The motion fluid, putting his dick right in Tony's face.
Tony wasn’t stupid he knew a good thing when he saw it and after Pepper, he wasn’t about to let a small thing like his need to be dominated keep him from being with Steve.  Hence his total bewilderment at where he found himself now, pressed against a wall in his lab. Hands held above his head, enclosed by a bigger stronger set that he could have easily been mistaken as a pair of irons. Steve has him pressed firmly between himself and the wall, leaving no room to wiggle around, barely enough to breath as Tony let out pants or air. The super soldier was perfectly in control, just watching as his lover tested his hold. He knew that Tony wasn’t expecting him here, he could see the confusion boarding on arousal as he held him. When Steve originally thought of pushing his and  Tony’s friendship further he had been worried. Not for himself but for Tony, how did you convince a man who could have anything, that you were worth his time? It actually turned out to be easy. A movie here, a date there, the occasional evening of listening to Tony talk about his newest project.
He was no stranger to sex, which also meant he had learned of quite a few of his own kinks. But with Steve's overall “nice guy” personality he figured he’d be stuck with romantic sex instead of a deep hard fucking… it would just have to be enough.
“Oh no, I want you right here Tony, coherent, sober… desperate.” Steve moved forward, his thigh pushing between Tony’s legs. Tony gasped as his cock received the unexpected friction, eyes going wide as they looked into their blue counterparts.
Tony blinked and the same fire shower was raining down from the sky. It was impossible to say how much time had passed. He couldn’t even be sure he’d blacked out but there was semen on his abdomen, already cooling. He didn’t remember the orgasm.
It’s a taunt but it doesn’t matter. Stark’s broken the seal and spoken the unspeakable aloud. It’s real now. (As if it wasn’t before; fifteen days of rattling around Steve’s brain). His fingers won’t release Stark’s arm, they bite in harder.
Natasha is too good a spy to fall for Stark’s distractions. “Making me Team Leader doesn’t mean you get to fall apart.”
Up ahead was a blemish on the ice and Tony was nearly upon it before he realized what it was. The red stood starkly against the white, two long streaks of blood ending in the clear outline of handprints. Next to them was a long, thin chip of stone that would make for an improvised dagger if you were so inclined. Tony picked up the shiv and felt its heft before he slipped it into his pocket. The inside of his undersuit was sticky. Somewhere along the way his puncture wounds had reopened.
FRIDAY doesn’t answer. The screens flicker and die, and only then does Steve realize what he’s implied. “I didn’t mean it like that. I know he wouldn’t trade - ”
“Wait - ! Hey!” Tony calls, voice falling farther behind as Steve picks up his pace. “The hangar doors are locked, Rogers!”
Up close and personal the wound looked worse. The edges of skin were old and jagged, flaking around the few remaining stitches fighting against tension to keep the wound closed. Bits of dirt were caked into the thread, standing starkly against Steve’s pale skin. The opening wept unseemly yellow fluids and Tony didn’t want to guess how deep into the lung cavity the slice went. The answer wouldn’t be good, even for a supersoldier.
Tony’s smile turned rueful. “Context. You remember a string of murders that didn’t stick.” His gaze was a million miles away. “I got to remember what I did to deserve it.”
“Never,” Tony vowed. “I’m keeping my promise. I’m getting us out.” His voice turned wistful. “I know you don’t believe me but I will.”
Most of this Hell had been designed for Tony but here, at its heart, was a place that could only ever belong to Steve.
Tony nods and squints as he stares down the hall. “The UN’s shrinks were here yesterday, I peeked at the report. The psychological triggers have faded below threshold, they’ll approve downgraded security if Barnes wants to leave.”
Teacup hits saucer with a clink. “Now we get to the part where I’m less than cooperative. I’m afraid I can’t tell you.”
Steve dropped heavily into the chair as Luke retreated. His listened to the maddening drip of time ticking by before finally breaking the silence. “You remember everything so why aren’t you scared?”
“I don’t know,” Steve croaks. His Christmas break from Stark started at the same time as everyone else’s. “According to the papers he got himself into a bar fight in Philadelphia and bought a baseball team.”
It should have been a paradise. They were gods here. The Ether drew landscapes from the minds it was connected to but to Steve this endless, infinite place was a hell and so it had become one. It had Tony’s desert, Steve’s ice, and death-without-Death everywhere because the real thing wasn’t allowed. The mortal part of Steve knew he should have been long dead by now and so had taken this place that would not let him rest and had warped it into an underworld that punished them both.
“We don’t believe so. The programming isn’t asserting itself so much as Sgt. Barnes is unconsciously taking refuge in those mechanisms that dull his emotional state.”
His heart’s racing too fast and someone is breathing too hard. He flips them, solidly anchoring the other man to the floor. He pins the Soldier’s arms and the other man doesn’t fight it, his limbs are lax in purported surrender but Steve can’t afford to believe it.
“No.” Steve’s voice was final, curdled resentment floating to the surface. “I’ve followed you this far, I’m not going further until you tell me where we're going.”
P.S. I may add a playlist chapter to this fic at some point so if it updates to six chapter at some point that’s what’s happening.
Then Stark makes his fatal mistake: he steps too close. Steve could have sworn his left hand was locked to the railing but it shoots out to grab Stark’s arm. For a moment neither of them move, they’re teetering on the precipice, spoiling for a fight to take the edge off their mutual frustration.
“Please, just… trust me. I’ll do whatever you need me to.” Steve holds his hands out in surrender. “I promise.”
So Steve ends up in sitting in Dr. Blancard’s sitting room as she passes him a glass of lemonade. The knuckles of her hands are swollen and on the wall are framed pictures of her children, her grandchildren, and her great-grandchildren. There are collars from a succession of Shetland sheepdogs and fresh daffodils in a vase with old petals scattered underfoot. Her husband’s urn is on the mantle and there’s a plate of crumbs resting atop it; the remnants of blueberry crumble. The current sheepdog is old and deaf and chewing on Steve’s sneaker underneath a shelf of awards. It is a portrait of a life of accomplishment, knickknacks, and loss but it is still alive, still growing.
“Steve?” Tony frowned. The skin of his entire left side was marked with burns he could neither feel nor remember. “Where - Where are we?”
Every breath he takes causes the blossoms to ripple, the esters tickling his nose from the inside. He reeks of amaryllis, of lilies, of hydrangeas. Everything tastes bad when the rhododendron is so heavy in your nostrils you can taste it but it goes well with gin. From then on he prides himself on the optimal drink pairing for every brand of loneliness. Morning glories favour a pinot grigio, columbines a good Kentucky bourbon. Aloe loves a Long Island iced tea. The floral scent leaks out of his pores, overwhelming the alcohol on his breath.
“Doesn’t surprise me.” Steve clasped his hands together. "I used to go to church every week. Never missed it. I always tried to do my best." He gave a heartbreaking little laugh. “And I ended up in Hell anyway.”
“I was being a hypocrite.” Stephen’s expression twisted. “I make him uneasy these days. He needs a doctor he can trust and I find myself… failing . He won’t tell me why but I have my suspicions.” He looked mournfully at the motel door. There was more grey at his temples than before. “I couldn't cross the veil either. You’re not alone, Captain.”
He wants to say more, to plant himself like a tree, but today is not that day. Tomorrow though; tomorrow is another chance to set things right that Steve fears they'll let pass them by. Another in an endless stretch, trapped together and alone.
“The Future had a good host.” Steve smiled and after a moment Tony matched it. “You should know there’s a bet going on about what invention you gave them first. Carol has her money on air travel, Rhodes has the machine lathe. I think Clint chose aqueducts.”
Tony woke with a mouthful of mud. The grit tasted metallic; devoid of organic matter as he spat it out in a coughing fit. His naked body shook and writhed as it expelled the last remnants of the sludge onto the ground and finally he could breathe. The air he gulped down tasted as flat and metallic as the mud but it did its job. He rolled onto his back and pried his crusted eyelids open to stare upwards. The blank grey sky that greeted him was almost unrecognizable as such. It was impossible to tell if it was night or day; the sun or moon hidden behind the opaque layer of clouds. It was beautiful in its own way and the dull, diffuse silver reminded Tony of the crushed velvet interior of coffin lids.
Tony's good at this, he knows he is. Never gotten one complaint. But he wants to be the best for Steve. Wants to take him just like he said he could.
"He's perfect..." Tony thinks, then immediately has the thought of how fucking unfair that is. Followed by berating himself for giving a fuck since that is Steve's hard, thick, cut length right there. Right in front of him, just waiting for Tony to get his shit together.
But now, now it was time to finally take those additional steps. To move their relationship to something more… intimate. Steve wondered when they would finally fall into bed together, when he would be able to see Tony as so many lucky people before him had. In the midst of passion, lost in feeling, but it hadn’t happened. Steve hated to view Tony as anything other than the amazing person he was, but he had to admit that he felt that if nothing else, Tony would have been a sure thing in the sack. From what Steve could tell, though, Tony was avoiding it. Not outright of course. He had not once denied Steven verbally, but anytime it seemed to get heated Tony pulled back. If anything they did even hinted at being less than soft and sweet, the billionaire would change the situation. Move heated make out sessions to gentle cuddling. Steve couldn’t complain really, he enjoyed the romantic side of Tony, but he got the distinct feeling that Tony had some major misconceptions about him that were keeping them from going forward. Steve had seen the sex tapes, read the articles, heard the exploits from Tony’s own mouth time and time again. He knew that Tony liked the rougher side of sex. At least enough for multiple different occasions and partners to be referenced in the re-telling of events. Steve wanted that, wanted Tony in all his past, present, and future glory. Steve also really wanted Tony on his dick. Sick of waiting, and feeling like they weren’t on the same page, Steve found himself marching down to the lap. Jarvis let him in just in time to see Tony bent over his most recent project. Covered in grease and oil, ass perfectly framed in rated jeans and defined chest covered by a dirty tank, Steve found himself acting without further thought.
He doesn't respond verbally. Instead, he places the slightest of kisses on the head of Steve's cock. Just a butterfly of a thing before he opens wide and takes him in for the first time.
He leans forward without even really thinking about it. Feels his lips part as he gets closer. The head is just at his lips, tongue ready to meet it as he takes it in, when Steve says his name.
He doesn't even realize that he's closed his eyes until Steve pulls back, a whine escaping the brunette. He slowly opens his eyes to see Steve holding his cock from it's base. Can feel Steve's hand on his face and his thumb run across his bottom lip. Tony tries to suck it in and hears Steve's breath hitch...
“I feel we have been on the wrong page about a few things Tony, and I want to clear them up. Right now.” Tony stared, not sure how to take the situation seriously when all he could think about was trying to ignore himself growing hard in his jeans. He sometimes hated how a show of dominance in the right setting could make him go from a composed businessman to a panting cock slut.
Tony's responding moan causes Steve to curse and lose his rythm for a second. Tony's arms feel like jelly, head light, but he's so hard. And he wants to do what Steve says, he wants to come, and he wants to come for Steve.
That has to be enough for Steve, because he aims his cock right at Tony's mouth before locking eyes.
“If you really think you can handle it… if you really want it. You’ll have to come and get it.” Tony began to slip off the table but stopped in his tracks at Steve’s next words. “And Tony,  remember, I plan to make you take it. You sure that’s what you want?” Tony paused to look into Steve’s eyes. Seeing the hard arousal at the for front, Tony was also able to see this for what it was. Steve was offering him and out. Letting him know that he could back out and avoid going any further if he needed too. Tony smiled as he sauntered towards his… partner. Leaning forward, Tony engaged Steve in a kiss, pushing all his unsaid feelings into it before pulling pack.
“Now, I know you knew of my relationship with Peggy Tony… how it never really got to go anywhere given the war and then the ice… but did I tell you about the others?”
Fingers still in front of Tony's face, covered in Steve's come, Tony leans forward and sucks them into his mouth. Steve's taste thick and heady across his tongue. He can feel the growl Steve let's out at that, can see his softening cock twitch in interest.
“I can handle anything you got, Rogers. You don’t have anything I haven't seen before.” Tony stated cockily, the playboy billionaire swagger coming back in a moment of defiance. Steve smirked, saying nothing in response. Instead, Steve used one hand to take hold of Tony’s wrist, using the other to bring the brunette’s legs completely around his waist. Taking all of Tony’s weight easily, Steven moved them over to the nearby table. Dropping Tony on top, Steve leaned in close, nose brushing Tony’s, radiating an air of authority.
Before Tony can go for his briefs, Steve grabs his hands. Tony looks up in question, but Steve doesn't bother speaking. He just firmly takes Tony's wrist, not squeezing but definitely firm, and moves them to bend behind tony's back.
They’ve gone to movies, museums; Steve cooked romantic dinners, while Tony tried to shower him with lavish gifts. It was after the 5th offer of a new bike, and the almost constant conversation over who was going to pay for that night's excursion, that Tony came to the realization that Steve wasn’t like anyone else. He wasn’t after his money, fame, mind, and Iron Man. Steve just wanted Tony… the thought was incomprehensible to him.
Tony moaned, shivers wracking his body as Steve’s words registered. “Oh God, Steve.” Tony could barely speak. He was so turned on, by what Steve was saying and the feel of his length pulsing against him.
“Wonderful. I’ll take a slice.” Tony straightened up from the case, “And two forks? If you’d like to join me, Steve? If you like midnight berries, that is.”
“Yeah. I looked at an apartment the last time I was here, and Bucky wants to move closer to his mom. She’s getting older, he wants Nat to get to know her. Sam thinks our coaching program would take off here in the city. Plenty of people like the military workout shtick.”
Bucky shook a little extra silverweed powder into the bowl before whisking again. “I told you to tell off those kids last time they were in. They always think they can hide their empty coffee cups on top of the gemology case like we can’t see it.”
“Aw, baby. Tony.” He tugged on the blanket again, “I’m not having this conversation with the duvet.”
Steve pulled back enough to spin Tony, guiding his hands to the cool marble countertop and kicking his legs apart, “Sir, yes sir.”
He laughed a little, “You should have seen me when I grew out a beard. But I meant that I have some scars, they aren’t pretty. We go at your pace, ok?”
“Me too, buddy,” Bucky said. He reached over to grab Steve’s shoulder, giving it a squeeze, “Me too.”
The thoughts felt like a kick to the chest, the ache of missing Tony dialed up to eleven. Tony smiled at the boy, bending to kiss the crown of his fine hair, no trace of Tony’s rebellious curls and all Steve’s stick straight Irish locks. With a final pat from his father, he ran off to join the other kids running up the steps in Lincoln’s shadow.
“I have learned to be very quiet. But usually once he’s out, he’s out. There’s a guest bedroom on the other side of the apartment if you want to be careful.”
“I can’t wait to get to know you too,” Steve said, dipping in for another kiss. One where he could taste the lingering sweetness of cake and smoke of Tony’s whiskey.
Steve was either going to melt through the floor or have to buy the suit pants he was wearing if Tony kept looking at him like that.
“Marky-Mark, you can’t put him in pink like this,” the man said, waving his arm up and down at Steve’s dress shirt, “washes him out.”
Sam took Bucky’s hand and helped him finish doing up his cuff links. “Now can we roll back to the part where you know Tony Stark and I'm just now finding out?”
Tony let go of Steve’s hand, leaning over to the coffee table and grabbing a box. He set it in Steve’s lap.
Dinner was delicious, and the conversation with Tony was so effortless that Steve didn’t even notice it was time for speeches and cake until Nat dropped a mic in his lap. He made Bucky cry with his Best Man speech-- his sole goal for the evening-- and was pretty sure that Sam rigged the cake pull so he’d get the ring token. The New Orleans tradition predicted he’d be the next one to get married, at least according to a giggling Sarah. He brought a slice back for Tony and asked him to dance once it was finished.
Steve pulled away and tried to straighten his clothes like they had gotten caught making out. He couldn’t hear the reply, but the door shut and the loud ruckus that only small children can make came down the hallway.
, inventor of the vibranium transmutation spell, and Witchy World’s Most Winsome Wizard three years running. Not that Steve kept every copy of those issues of that gossip rag for any particular reason. Tony was also, for some unknown reason, a weekly regular at the shop.
Bucky was already mixing Tony’s usual drink; a large macchiato with infusions of honeysuckle and phoenix breath, topped with a hand-whipped storm cloud. Steve thought it was ridiculous, but Tony insisted the lightning kept it the perfect drinking temperature, and found the tiny rumbles charming as he wandered the stacks.
“I’m not 23 anymore,” Steve groaned. Tony’s body squeezed down around Steve’s knot, and Steve’s body perked up in response. He rolled Tony back over with a grin, “But I’m willing to try.”
He knew some parents sent gift cards or other little things to teachers at the end of the year, but all the things Steve wanted to give Mr. Stark were X-rated. Steve had nearly melted through the floor on Parent Night, flirtatious banter flying out of his mouth before his brain could stop it. And for Tony to give as good as he got, suggesting he couldn’t wait for their ‘one-on-one.’ The months since had been both exciting and agonizing, he couldn’t remember the last time he felt a connection like this. He tried to hide it from Peter, but the kid was smart enough to figure it out, subtly putting Tony’s number in Steve’s phone for ‘college prep meetings.’
They’d fallen into a steady routine. Peter stayed after two nights a week for science club and got a ride home from Ned’s parents, and Steve picked them up on Fridays for pizza and games with their other friends. Steve heard the front door open and shut, the shuffle of shoes and a backpack hitting the wood floor and braced himself for the verbal tsunami of post science club gossip and excitement.
A month of his own hand made the first glide of Tony’s tongue feel magnified, the first moment of wet suction around his cock was like a shock. He made good on his promise and threaded fistfuls of Tony’s hair through his fingers, gripping tight to the root. His husband was a balm on his weary returning soldier’s soul, eyes deep coffee brown in the low light of the bedroom and plush lips stretched obscenely. The sound of him trying to swallow his spit as Steve held him place by the hair was profane music to his ears, each little moan muffled by another thrust orchestrated by Steve’s hips.
He was getting close if the constant stream of babble stumbling from his mouth was any indication, and it was. Steve pointed his tongue, sloppily opening Tony up and sealing his lips over his rim. He worked Tony faster, hands and tongue working in time with Tony’s hips.
Sam went first into the house, dropping his keys and wallet in the dish by the door before heading to the kitchen. “Bucky! Nat! Emergency roommate meeting!”
Tony locked his legs around Steve’s thighs with a growl, “If you even think about getting off this bed…”
“I don’t want to hurt you,” he replied. “Plus you were the one to tell me that virginity is made up Alpha-arcrhal societal nonsense.”
He let go of Tony’s locks, letting them curl forward and Steve was gone at the sight. Lush waves adding a dark lust to his husband’s face as he sucked down Steve’s come, licking the remnants that escaped his lips like a cat who had gotten the cream.
Flustered, Steve grabbed the book and added it to the pile in his arms hoping to hide his burning cheeks, “Thank you, Mr. Stark. ”
Instead, the real Mr. Stark wore fitted dark wash jeans that stretched nicely over the curve of his strong legs every time he crouched to adjust some part or fitting on the robot in the center of the room, and a deep red button down with a gold tie clipped to it so that nothing caught in the servos and gears. His sleeves were rolled up, and he kept tiny screwdrivers in his breast pocket. Every time he grabbed one and poked the tip of his tongue out in concentration, Steve choked on his own tongue.
The call had been awkward. It was obvious Tony didn’t want to say too much where Peter could hear just yet, but they set a date to talk at Tony’s home in New York in two weeks.
He could hear Bucky huffing and puffing under his breath about the absurdity of what Steve just said. “It’s the principle of it, Steven.”
“What else am I supposed to call it? You knot and then go boneless and I’m crushed beneath 200 pounds of alpha.”
Tony kissed him in apology. Steve felt a sense of rightness float through him as he breathed in their combined scents on their skin. The harsher tones of Steve’s leather were smoothed out by Tony’s rich coffee until they faded into the background. Their secondary scents pushed forward, citrus and coconut both bright and ticklish in his nose.
“He didn’t mean to, I made a joke and Peter wasn’t looking and we knocked the beakers over and Mr. Stark told us to go and there was this smell,” Ned was going a mile a minute.
The paramedics laughed and gave Steve the all clear to get him home. Steve resisted the urge to pick Peter up like he was three and tote him back to the car, but barely. There was still so much commotion, but Steve could see another ambulance open closer to the doors of the school. Even wrapped in a blanket with a paramedic's hand obscuring most of his face, Steve knew Tony’s features from across the distance.
Steve followed behind, moving to the counter to get down the blender as Sam gathered the ingredients for their post run recovery smoothie. “No, we don’t need to have an emergency meeting.”
“I’ve been a little focused on last minute suits and the florist calling every hour about changing the arrangements, I haven’t exactly had a moment to think about you setting me up with a stranger,” Steve groused.
“Steve, yes, we hadn’t gotten to names yet. I hope you don’t mind me giving a little sartorial advice.”
A vision of Tony laid out underneath him, on his belly and Steve’s hand entwined in jet and silver flashed through his mind to his cock before he answered, “Yes.”
But why not give Tony a portrait of their future family? He had enough time to make a smooth addition to the picture.
“Order some I can rip and I’ll show you everything you’ve been missing, honey,” Steve replied. He smoothed Tony’s hair down, itching to give him a kiss.
“Hello parents, I’m Mr. Stark, please call me Tony. Sorry for the long wait, but the first rule of robotics is ‘Never let the robot know you’re on a deadline'.” Tony waited for the crowd to finish laughing before continuing, “I’m going to turn the floor over to Harley, president of the Science Club, he can explain the work they’ve been doing for the past several weeks with DUM-e.”
Sam gave Steve a firm slap on the back, kicking his lungs back into gear. He coughed and sputtered, sucking in wet gasps of air until Sam handed him a water bottle.
Tony’s head popped up from underneath Steve’s chin. His hair was mussed and wild, curling a little at the edges. “You are?”
Steve scraped his teeth across the fresh hickey on Tony’s collarbone, enjoying the shudder it caused in the body underneath him, the growing urgency in his noises.
If you liked this fic, but don't know what to comment, I love emojis! Drop a ❤ to tell me you'd like to kudos again 😘
“Sounds perfect. I am not against a future sibling for Petey, but absolutely not right now.” He looked down at himself and poked his belly, “You hear that? No Shenanigans this time.”
“Where did you learn to talk like that? Is there a dungeon I need to know about? Do you want to go get changed into some leather?”
Peter let out a petulant whine, “Ugh can you two just go out already? I already owe MJ $20 because I thought you’d crack before spring break.” Apparently nothing got in the way of teenage histrionics.
Tony took his hand and walked them backwards down the dark hall until they got to the guest bedroom. He didn’t bother to turn on the light after he closed the door, letting the city filtering in through the window illuminate them.
Tony drew back, just enough to speak. “I have a car and driver waiting, if you want to get started?”
“I am.” Tony said. He squeezed Steve’s hand tighter, “It takes the cake, literally, as my most unique first date. What about you?” Tony answered.
glass vase, the one Steve had given him sophomore year when they officially started dating and Tony tried to put the flowers Steve brought in a cup he’d stolen from the cafeteria. It stood out, another lingering thread connecting them.
“Isn’t it?” Bucky continued before Steve could get a word in, “We built in a couple extra meals with the caterer, just in case things changed. What do you say?”
Steve handed over the bouquet he brought and Tony cut the ends. He dropped the stems into a simple glass vase.
way. A little distance wouldn't hurt them, or the Avengers, so Steve didn't fight about Tony leaving.
“Let’s go check on Mr. Stark,” Steve said, steering Peter towards the ambulance instead of the car. “You know, if you didn’t want me to bring bean dip, there were easier ways to cancel the party.”
“I wasn’t.  After our last night, I had a low grade fever for a few days, cramps. I thought I had just picked up a bug somewhere, so I just took some Advil and stayed in bed.” Tony paused, his lips forming a thin line as he worked through what to say. “We were all surprised when I missed my next scheduled heat. Then, I couldn’t smell Dad’s cigarette smoke without throwing up when I went home, I couldn’t keep breakfast down. The doctor said it sounded like my body went through an unscheduled heat due to, well, a courting break.”
Steve felt a tremor go through Tony’s body underneath him, his erection firmed up under Steve’s chest. “Who knew Captain America has a hair pulling kink? Yes to that, by the way.”
Steve pushed Tony’s legs wider, changing the angle until his thrusts caused Tony’s quips to stop in favor of singing his praises to the ceiling. They laid in the soft quiet of the afterglow, the late afternoon light filtering through the curtains highlighting the goosebumps on their skin in the AC.
“Oh Petey, yeah, everyone did then,” Tony answered. He gathered Peter in a hug, giving the top of his hair a kiss. “We’ll see if we can still find one somewhere and I’ll show you how to use it.”
Their first anniversary was less than twenty-four hours away, and Tony needed to be in the air in two, bound for California and the SI plant that went offline after a minor earthquake tripped all the energy safety switches and finely calibrated housing for the arc reactor powering it. It couldn’t have come at a worse time, anniversary notwithstanding. He was neck deep in suit upgrades, Steve was busy handling Bucky’s de-Winter Soldering. Every phone call made them jump in case it was their social worker. Everyone told them that adopting while superheroing was risky, but Tony wasn’t getting any younger. Growing their family was worth whatever it was going to cost--even retirement.
“I didn’t know how to reach you. I thought about trying Bucky’s mom, but I didn’t know how she’d take it, or if she’d even help me or believe me.”
He wrapped his arms around Tony’s back, sliding under the cropped jersey to finger the lacy band around his ribs before answering. “Not done enjoying it, but I can see myself being very satisfied by the end of the night.”
He wasn’t hard to track down. Tony was surrounded by Sam’s nephews and Clint’s kids and looked to be demonstrating some sort of trick using silverware, toothpicks and a candle. Steve watched as the contraption above the flame started to move and the kids created chaos in their little corner with their excited screaming.
Tony trembled on closer to orgasm, Steve steadied his rhythm to carry him over until he gasped, something Steve had ached a month for. Tony tangled his hands with Steve’s own, gripping and releasing in time with thrusts down Steve’s throat. The sharp press of his ring against Steve’s fingers was a bright point of focus breaking through the cloud of pleasure from rubbing against the bed in his own pants.
Steve wrapped his arms around Tony, drawing their bodies together and deepening the kiss. His nose was full of Tony’s scent, full of the way it thickened like syrup. It was the same as it was ten years ago. Steve’s own scent flooded the air to match, and he could hear Tony’s soft whimper as he caught it and his body softened in response.
A muffled trill of his phone going off in another room carried over the sounds of rustling brown paper bags.
“Good. I need time to recover. Not everyone is a beefy football player, you know. Running downs or whatever it is that you do one the field.”
Tony did his own version of the shy foot shuffle and pointed past Steve’s shoulder, “DUM-e and his brothers. I’ve always been a bit busy for a love life.”
“Maybe after I get back from Tampa.” He hoped Tony could feel his smirk on his ass before he licked over the panties again. He wanted Tony wrecked. Marked and sore and wearing Steve’s jersey.
Besides, he knew he was in no place to do anything like that… not yet, at least. No, for the rest of the week he focused on resting as much as possible, only convincing Sam and Bucky twice of letting him walk through the halls for a few minutes, both times caught by Natasha; he had also talked,
“Good boy. Then maybe it’s time you get together a team, Harry… and destroy Peter. Once and for all”
Ta-da! The chapter is done, HOWEVER, there's still one more! Let's face it, those two have a lot to solve haha
“I’m guessing you weren’t expecting me, of all people,” Spider-Man said, almost in a sing-song voice - which, to be fair, Peter was having big trouble on faking. He’d known about Harry’s big plan, he had known it was his idea to hurt May; partly because it’d hurt Peter as well, partly because Norman had done so a few years back, although he hadn’t managed to kill her. Once he had realized that was Harry’s next step, the plan was easy: he would make Harry believe he was done with being a superhero, leaving his Aunt more defenseless. He would, on top of that, make his parents and rest of the family go to the Compound, either by fabricating some excuse, or simply by telling them they had to trust him, and to go. And then, he would be the one waiting for Harry in the apartment, ready to fight and end things already. Of course, he had also assumed Harry wouldn’t come alone… after all, his Dad had died fighting Spider-Man one-on-one, so it was logical to bring more people with him to assure the superhero’s end -
(also, a couple clarifications before we start: the rogues stay in Wakanda after Civil War, all of them. It's been like two years since it happened, and also: I wrote the majority of this before seeing Infinity War, so there's no spoiler nor something totally related to it)
, but, I don’t want you there as my best friend, just like I didn’t hire Flash because we were friends or just like I didn’t hire Harls because he’s my surrogate brother. They’re both in S.I because we needed their brilliant minds… just like we need yours”
Sorry for the delay, as I told you I was out the whole weekend! I was at the beach and I hadn't been in months... and the sea is like, one of the loves of my life, so I had missed it. Anyway, please, enjoy!
PLEASE leave comments and kudos if you can, and I'll see you next time! Don't forget to check out my other story! Okay, bye!
“I know” he nodded “, but I also know that with you out there I would’ve just… worried the whole time. And not because I thought you wouldn’t be able to fight” Peter hurried to say when he saw Shuri ready to argue again “, but because I would be thinking of how much Harry would be trying to get to you, to hurt you, just in order to hurt me. I know you would’ve been able to fight him, too, and most likely win without help, but that wasn’t the problem, Shur. The problem was
not much i want to say here, but i'll definitely have some words at the end. anyway... please enjoy.
“I am” Peter nodded “. Or, well, as close to okay I can be, I guess… I went to visit Harry today, spent the whole day there… the place is ugly, I know he would’ve hated it”
I hope you guys liked it! I'm already working on the next story, which will have two parts (I've already finished the first one!), and, ladies and gentlemen... I'm finally doing the Field Trip. I'm nervous as hell about it lmao, but I hope you guys enjoy it.
“Right… but you don’t want to force it” Michelle completed for him, understanding Peter’s point. Peter nodded to her words, smiling almost timidly at her and, just then (and to her surprise) MJ felt like a weight had been lifted off of her shoulders, because… Peter was right. They were putting pressure on their relationship, expecting their break up to break, expecting them to realize something that neither of them had a clue about, and it just wasn’t right. They hadn’t worked because of personal reasons, and neither had resolved any of those. If they wanted a healthy relationship (any type of it), they had to heal individually first, figure themselves out first… that was the only way “. I think you’re right, Peter… we’ve been doing this wrong for a long time, and… I don’t want us to break to a point we can’t come back from. So… I agree. From now on, we’re friends, without any type of expectation” she finished, holding out her hand for Peter to shake. The genius of the two smiled big and sincere and nodded, shaking her hand in his, which made Michelle lean forward and kiss Peter’s lips for a moment, soft and gentle, smiling when he kissed back immediately. It felt different, like a promise. They knew then things were, ultimately, going to be okay “. If it’s okay, I’ll leave now” she murmured after the kiss was broken “. I’m sure your Dads will send a search party if you’re not in the Tower in the next twenty minutes”
“Nothing.” The stranger is still speaking calmly but he’s clearly not as immune to Steve’s intimidation as he’d like everyone to think. “I’m not here to harm anyone. I’m just here to help.”
Tony couldn’t help checking his throat. There was just the same dull ache that characterized this place.
“I’ll do whatever it takes to give Bucky a chance, you know that.” When Steve looks up he realizes he’s somehow said something very, very wrong.
Steve says, surprising himself with how forceful he sounds. “He doesn’t get to break us apart because I wouldn’t follow them and then turn around and - ”
The corners of Tony’s lips twitch, the beginnings of a smile. He can’t hide his earnest longing well enough. “Come back, Cap.”
“Happy now?” Tony’s expression shuts down. “I need you present, accounted for, and moderately functional for the shitstorm that’s about to hit because I don’t know if you’ve noticed but I am a fucking mess right now and we can’t both be in pieces at once.”
“I didn’t lie to you before,” Tony had said while waiting in a drive-thru, “I kept my sobriety. The Captain never gave me alcohol. Water-only. So he did me a favour I guess.”
Then he’d smiled that satisfied smile and something icy in Steve had cracked. His grip slackened as he let Tony slip to the ground. Tony had bled out slowly, the greedy mud drinking it in. The blood would water the seed of a tree. It hadn’t been Tony’s first suicide nor the last, and by the end he’d made a forest of them. He’d hanged himself from handmade nooses, he’d drowned himself under the frozen lake. He’d once found the courage plunge into the boiling tar pit. He escaped into amnesia before Steve could send him there. Before Steve could kill him.
(Steve never thought he was the type of man who’d lie to himself but then again he never thought he was the type to lie.)
Tony is correct. The doors are locked but that has never stopped Steve. Even through the layer of burlap, the first hit with the shield dents the triple-ply steel. The sound isn’t the sharp ring of years past but the vibrations the impact sends up Steve’s arm are familiar on their own.
Of course it’s Sam. He’s worked with Rhodes, Nat and Vision before. He fits the Avengers’ new fly high, fly fast motto. Steve couldn’t have chosen better himself.
Stark chokes back a snigger and Steve has to stop himself from digging fingers into shoulders. He takes his anger out on the shirt buttons instead. Stark’s dark head knocks against the wall under the assault and when he opens his mouth Steve just knows something poisonous is about to come tumbling out. That’s all Stark has left for him anymore and today with the dull glare of the shield behind him, Steve just can’t. He moves to cover Stark’s mouth with his own and then thinks better of it. He sinks his teeth into the cords of the Stark’s throat instead so that all he manages to exhale is a hiss.
“We go that way.” Tony pointed with more confidence than he had. It was an arbitrary choice. In a place devoid of landmarks or known destination, one direction was as good as any other.
Steve’s hands are wrapped well, white tape reinforcing joints, knuckles exposed. Weapons dangling at the end of wrists. Stark isn’t afraid, wasn’t all those times he should have been.
“Good man,” Penelope says. She’s been trying to repeal the Accords since their inception. Across from her, one of Tony’s lawyers rolls her eyes.
“No. Not even slightly,” Tony hauls himself unsteadily to his feet, “and they’re coming to kill us.”
Not everything goes so well. It turns out the legal quagmire of Captain America doesn’t just disappear when Steve starts reaching out. The African and European Unions want nothing to do with him. Signing the Accords are the only way he’s going to be cleared to go into half those countries and he still can’t bring himself to do it.
Steve tenses and comes, fascinated and disgusted at once as he watches Stark’s throat convulse as he swallows. The hand in Tony’s hair isn’t gripping anymore, just absentmindedly stroking through strands. Steve doesn’t want to draw attention to it by pulling it back. Besides, of the two actions Steve’s is hardly the more intimate.
Tony’s pacing in the half-dark of the corridor, coiled and furious. He’s in a perversion of his normal business attire: jacket missing and left shirtsleeve half-rolled up. His tie is gone and so, mysteriously, are his socks and shoes. His hair isn’t the well-groomed coif he sports in the morning but sticking up in all different directions. Under the glow of the nighttime lighting the line of his jaw is too sharp, over-emphasized by his goatee. The dark of his eyes is alive and fathomless.
Steve blinked at the unchanging view. The wound snarled. “I’m not going to make it. I’d rather go on my own terms.”
Steve’s swallowed monster strained at his ribs, threatening to tear him apart. “So what do I do about it?”
“I’m sorry.” Steve has to steel all his courage to lift his head. He remembers too vividly that look of heartbreak and devastation and he doesn’t know if he would survive seeing even an echo of it directed at him again.
Steve was the threat. He unbalanced everything; assumed the worst and started a fight, deaf to all pleas to stop. He remembers Tony's face filled with fright and knows it wasn't because of the Soldier, it was because Steve charged. He remembers Tony's hands raised in surrender before Steve tossed him aside like a ragdoll. He pushed Tony by the chest and Steve had been so, so careful where he'd laid his hands ever since he'd realized how much Tony couldn't take it.
“Oh, that sounds interesting” Abeer immediately said, smiling excitedly “. Can you tell us what those are? Especially for the rumoured New Members, can you tell us anything?”
Michelle sighed and did as told, taking a couple of minutes to do so. And then, she understood Peter’s point, just like he understood hers “. It’d suck, as much as I would be aware this is just your job”
Hope you guys liked it! Don't kill me, please. I promise everything will work out... well, maybe. If you have any doubts, just tell me, please. And don't forget to comment! I want to know if I'm doing a great job, so constructive criticism it's always welcome! Plus, y'all are so cute, so I love reading your comments! Makes my day!!
Natasha fully laughed at him from her seat in front of Peter, which made him jokingly frown at her. But his question had been
“Which is?” Tony asked, again worried about his son. Cho hadn’t told them the whole list of injuries, but the engineer didn’t care that much about it; Peter was going to be ok, and that was the most important thing… he could hear about his injuries later. The doctor sighed, looking back for a moment before looking at the small family.
-The world knows they have a son, but not his name or what he looks like. So, only Ned and May know about Peter's real family.
Please comment and if you can leave kudos! I really need to see if you guys like this story, and it motivates me to keep going!
Peter, who put on a fake smile when he realized they had gone into the room and failed miserably in trying to convince them he was doing okay. Physically, yes, he wasn’t as pale and ill-looking, but his eyes looked wrong, duller, and that was never a good sign.
And... I am devastated. It's been some days since Stan Lee left us, but it is heartbreaking. I found out while in class because one friend from my home country sent me a screenshot she'd seen of the news about Stan. At first, I couldn't believe it, so I took to twitter and when I saw it was true... it's still hard to believe. Like, you can of expect him to be always there, you know? Deep down we all knew this day was going to come, and we all knew Stan had health issues, but it's... well, heartbreaking. Mister Lee, thank you so much for all you've given us. I can't think of a way we can repay you but thank you for letting us dream and see ourselves in the amazing characters you brought to life. We'll be always grateful.
Peter laughed and agreed, sitting in the chair his Dads always left free for him, knowing their kid liked to impromptu visit them.
“Pete!” Flash’s voice brought him back to reality, the guy having seen him in the midst of the crowd. He’d stood up in the booth, widely waving at him in a way the superhero hated, which they both knew. Peter just rolled his eyes at him and approached the tables, welcoming all the brief hugs he got “. We were wondering where were you, man”
“Definitely more” Tony said, agreeing with his boys, too “. But I’m glad we’re past those insane days”
“But you’re okay now, right?” Ned asked, a deep frown on his face just making him look older than he really was. For a brief moment, Peter asked himself if he looked like that, too.
“Which you and I have plenty” Peter pointed out, punching again and again at the pads “. I tell you everything, Uncle B”
someone. Part of losing someone like that included not being able to talk to them anymore, and Peter knew. He’d known since he had had to lose his parents back when he was a kid, he’d known when he’d had to lose Ben, years later. Ben, who had told him (back when he was a scared little kid, wanting his parents to come back as soon as possible) that you could still talk to those you’d lost, and the genius had believed his Uncle, too desperate to do otherwise. Now, however, at twenty-four, practically twenty years had gone by since that talk and now Peter realized that those talks were just to try to get some of the comfort you’d lost back… but were in no way something tangible, something
“I know that” Peter nodded “. And I also know I really like being with you, and spending time with you. But, with the article, and with everything that’s happened in the past few months, MJ, I think… I think we’re too different. Just like we were when we broke up”
Also, SPIDEY IS BACK IN THE MCU, WOHOOOOO! God, I'm so happy he's back. It would've sucked if he suddenly disappeared from Marvel.
PLEASE leave a comment so I know what you guys thought of this chapter, and feel free to tell me something you want to see in this story!
“I won’t” Peter promised him, which was half true “, I trust them… besides, Uncle B would kill me if I didn’t let him do”
PLEASE leave a comment and kudos if you want/can! And thank you so much for reading! Also, there's a new one-shot in the other work in this AU! A little Spideychelle for you all!
so, I really hope you enjoyed the chapter. don't worry, in the next one you will find out what happened to Peter, or at least part of it...hehe. I'll try to upload it on Wednesday, but it depends on my finals!
“Baby, I’m so sorry about Harry. You have to know I am, okay? I never wanted for this to happen, never did”
“I was hoping you’d say that” Pepper immediately said, almost reacting too fast “, because I think it’s the wise thing to do”
PLEASE leave a comment and kudos if you can/want! Also, if you want to read a particular scene situated in this AU tell me! I'll be uploading a new story soon with extra scenes of this AU and I'm open to suggestions!
“You wished he would’ve” Steve finished for his kid. Peter nodded at his words, sinking deeper into the mattress “, that things were different”
“Well” Harley murmured then, playing with his thumbs “, I may know something. Or everything, I don’t know”
. Still… “. I guess you remember what today is? If you don’t, it’s fine, I totally had to be reminded of it, but… Uncle Buck says that’s fine, like that means I’m healing, you know? And, deep down, I know that’s something you wanted for me, or at least that’s something I could think you wanted for me in the last moments you were here… I miss you, Harry” Peter murmured, blinking hard to stop his tears “. I used to think the worst thing in the world was you hating me, but now I wish I could have that back, you know? I’d take you hating me over you being gone any day, H, although I am happy you realized I never meant any harm. It just sucks the way you had to realize it, the way it just… never mind. I just… I’ve been trying to accept this, all of this. Therapy has been a lot of help, even when it’s still a bit hard to admit I needed it so badly, but I’m getting there. My therapist, she told me to call her Lena, she told me I really have to accept you’re gone, which may be the hardest part of all of it… I guess my Uncle B was right, you know? You were the only part I had left of my childhood, of a simpler time where I didn’t know my parents were the leaders of the Avengers, a simpler time when I wasn’t Spider-Man or felt like the world would crumble down if I stayed quiet for too long. When we met… the War had been over for just over a year, and I was away from home, and trying to find some ground to stand on, and you were
“Not a normal life, not be a normal worker with a mediocre salary, not normal friends, or a normal partner… and of course, dear son,
“C’mon Buck, don’t be mean, she doesn’t have her minion to back her up” Sam said, coming from behind Bucky and joining in the teasing. Natasha rolled her eyes at the younger superheroes (although not by much, Peter was painfully aware of that fact) and left the place, murmuring something about how big of an idiot they both were and why did she even
“Let’s put him on the ground, we have to understand why he passed out,” Tony said, already telling FRIDAY to make a scan of Peter’s body. However, once they had the kid laying on the ground, all three adults felt their hearts stop in their chests, because of that… that was a lot of blood, quickly pooling under Peter’s body.
(mostly thanks to Tony), and even she had been impressed by what they had achieved in those few months, although not that surprised. Peter was a kind man, generous and
Parallel to Bucky and Peter’s talk there was another reunion, this time in Manhattan. It’d been a bit rushed up, but Harry hadn’t had any other option - Peter’s decision of quitting everything had been unexpected, which meant there would be plenty of people lost, not knowing what to exactly do… including Peter’s family, at least according to the young genius’s words. That was an opener and one that would not happen again, which the young Osborn knew. He had to green-light the last step of the plan: the big finale, the finale that would end Peter once and for all.
Oh my God, sorry for being so late. A few friends of mine convinced me to go out tonight, just to grab some dinner, and when I came back home I had to finish two assignments. I literally just finished them
“And that’s good” MJ pointed out, grabbing Peter’s hand and squeezing it firmly. Peter nodded and squeezed back.
“I think I’ll be fine” Peter murmured “, or… I hope I’ll be fine. But for now, it just… it hurts, Buck”
“I don’t, no” Peter laughed. In truth, his free time was rather a precious thing, but he didn’t complain about it. The first year after Harry’s passing he’d focused on himself and his mental health, on finally healing, and sure, he’d worked for S.I and the Avengers, but more on the down low, much less than he was used to. For when he deemed himself ready to do something more, to get back on track, Peter was
I saw Far From Home today. I'm not gonna say anything because that'd be spoilers and I'm sure not everyone who reads it has got the opportunity to see it yet. Just one little thing:
“You seem to forget Peter was barely fifteen back then” Harry reminded him “. He didn’t know everything he does know today, he hadn’t experienced an ounce of the pain he’s endured thanks to the Avengers… you fought him when he still believed in the good guys, when he still thought the Avengers would help people - before Scarecrow, or the War, of his parents failing him, like we all knew they would”
It's been a while, huh? God, I'm so sorry for taking this long, but I sort of needed to take a step back. Truth is, the pandemic was truly overwhelming and messed my already unstable mental health even more... I started to write for fun and to disconnect, and sadly I stopped writing as much in this fic. It didn't help, either, that I simply wasn't happy with the ending I had decided on... it felt rushed, and not genuine. It didn't felt right, you know?
“Sorry for the long meeting,” she said, smiling sympathetically “, I wasn’t expecting to have it last this long”
“Peter is out of surgery” she informed them, letting herself smile at the collective sigh of relief that dawned over the room “, he’s still gravely injured and we think his body is going to take a bit more than usual to heal his injuries, but he is going to be okay - especially if he rests the way he has to”
“Well, then very good to know,” Abeer said, smiling brightly at him “. We’re all sure Stark Industries has a very bright future with you in it. However, between S.I and the Avengers Team, which we’ll later talk about, you can’t have that much free time, do you?”
Not much surprise there - Bucky was dying to see him, so he hadn’t left the waiting room, not for one minute. After having that much necessary talk with his parents and crying and hugging each other for a bit, Peter asked them to let his Uncle inside. Both of his parents agreed immediately, telling their kid they would give them privacy and use that time to ask Natasha or Fury for information on what the public knew. Once they knew Peter was okay with that, they let Bucky into the room and left it themselves.
“Meeting went well though?” Ned asked, handing him a drink they had already ordered for him. Peter accepted it with a smile on his face and nodded, sipping some of it before answering.
chosen to see the conference, had wanted to see Peter in his first big test as the soon-to-be CEO of Stark Industries. He knew his assistant could’ve watched it (would’ve, if it was any other competitor), but Harry
Steve and Tony frowned at their son’s words, exchanging glances over the young man’s head and having a silent conversation with their eyes for a moment before looking back at Peter “. So what do you think about that, Bambi?” Steve asked, just as if he was trying to see if the beast would attack. Peter smiled softly at that.
Peter had done countless press conferences in his life; some not worth even remembering, some big and life-changing and still terrifying. The one he was in, though, felt every bit different. He felt trapped, yet freer than ever, he felt like a deer caught in bright lights yet completely in control; Peter felt like the reporters (uncharacteristically silent) were just waiting to jump him, and yet he felt like he could, with calculated words, make them completely trust him. The superhero walked to the podium with Happy always two steps behind him and overlooked the sea of reporters and cameras, all pointing at him, taking a second to breathe and then square his shoulders as a smile crept into his face, polite and clearly sending a message to everyone there.
By the way, I totally forgot to mention, but: on the new work (not the sequel, the story with the one-shots), it's also possible to ask for a story that would take something that already happened and change it! For example, let's say you guys want to know what would've happened if they didn't search for Peter when he was fifteen; things like that. Alright, with that being said, enjoy the chapter!
“Which we know is a bit hard for you” Tony joked, hands threading through his son’s curls. Peter smiled weakly at that, breathing in deeply shortly after, just as if he was remembering everything that had happened.
See you guys soon! (actually, do you want me to upload before infinity war?) Don't forget you can suggest any idea you have.
I'm really trying to get back to my posting schedule! With finals, it'll be a bit more difficult, but I'll try! Thank you for enduring this, you're the best!
“I think it’s more sociopath than anything” MJ disagreed, coming from the kitchen with a bowl of popcorn in her hands, settling herself down in the two-seater. Peter huffed and joined her there, bumping their knees.
And in a present time, what is Peter going to do with the new villains? Hopefully his Dads can put some sense into his head
Anyway, don't forget to comment (you guys are the absolute best and bright up my whole days) and leave requests if you want to! After this story it'll be a bunch of requested one shots! (again, don't forget to vote!)
