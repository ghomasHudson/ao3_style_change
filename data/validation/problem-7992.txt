Tears streamed into fabric, sobs disguised as grunts, while Tony pretended he could see Steve's eyes lit with joy, and not Steve's face full of sorrow, like a ghost of regrets hovering in the darkness behind the blindfold. He wanted to writhe and wail, beg and provoke, till self-control snapped and they surged together in the rise to the finish. Instead, he was held fast, pinned, stifled.
That had been intimidating at first, but Steve had shared enough time and company with him now to catch sight of some of his more intricate inner workings. Beyond his brilliance as an innovator, Tony was a caring soul; he loved to help people, and he had a deep-down eagerness to earn approval.
"We're back safe. What did you want to know?"
God, the sight of him, wrecked like a wild man with matted hair and swollen lips, his face soaked and his naked torso gleaming with sweat, arresting Steve's eyes with his dark-dilated gaze, and
He thinned his lips. “
"...here."
"Ah, a significant space, then. You will want liveliness, but not to overwhelm with something too ornate, nor bore with undue subtlety or an excess of repetition. Perhaps we can build a motif in bold, large blocks." He clapped his hands once, looking hopeful. "It will be a custom design? Mr. Steve can help choose the basic pattern and colors, and then I will have it completed in some weeks."
Steve brushed off the front of his pants, wincing slightly and plucking a fragment from his palm.
Then she turned on her heel, blew a kiss over her shoulder, and sashayed off with a swing to her hips and a swish to her skirt, every inch the manic, gleeful coquette. Roger would call it a calculated tease, but it wasn’t. Well, the calculated part, that sure was. They both knew how to put on a show. But a tease, no. A prelude, a promise, and it was definitely having the desired effect, keeping him on the hook, hard, hot and bothered, and primed to take off in pursuit.
The nature of the strike told it all. They'd wanted torment. Grievous injury, and the agonizing hope of survivors. Whether or not there were any was of no relevance.
A hot mouth slipped over the tip of his cockhead where it peeked out of its foreskin, and then enveloped the rest. The head and still-pliable shaft made an easy portion for Tony, who could take him to the root at full mast, purple-red, thick, hard, and thrumming. Thinking it made him itch to get there, and he twitched and filled out a little more, but his imagination alone wasn't enough, not when contradicted by the very immediate lack of physical stimulation.
His best man had walked in that morning to find them laying out their suits and accessories together, and thrown up his hands.
Mercilessly, Tony sucked and swallowed him through his orgasm till his throes subsided, avidly licking him shiny and clean of come. Finally, Steve hit a threshold and it was too much, falling back into the couch with a muttered, "...
Roger bit his cheek against a smile at her indignation, and the images it put in his head. He had just met Starla, but he could already imagine the row if anyone tried to use gender roles to dictate her behavior. Blazing eyes and wrathful, self-righteous fury, standing over a vanquished foe, that’s what he saw. Woe betide that man -- or fellow woman, for that matter. It was a mistake he planned not to make.
“You may as well show him Jarvis.”
He knew he needed to stop, rest, but he didn't know how to ask it of his dominant anymore. He let it go. The aches and tiredness, he let it all seep into his bones and owned it, accepting it. If Steve asked of him he could have stayed in place until he fell down.
“What?”
A loud, plastic squeak interrupted the moans suddenly and the whole thing came screeching to a halt.
Steve gave him a helpless look, "Well, yeah. But I could already smell something was wrong. And the timing of your heat.. "
He was holding a huge glass of water out to Tony and the sub  was kind of thirsty after the spicy meal so he did take a drink.
“It smells more..intense..” Steve felt himself starting to blush, “I mean.. Is it normal? And I think it hit too sudden? Something seems to be off.. I’m just saying because maybe we should take Tony to a doctor. I understand why you don’t want to..”
When he saw Tony he swung the rope and caught it in his hand, gathering it in one fluid move and stepped towards the sub with a smile.
Tony felt the captain's hardness pressing into the ache of his butt and moaned, the greasy half washed pan completely forgotten now.
The cool, fresh evening air hit him like a blessing. He walked past the occasional group of people who chatted with glasses in hand, and made his way down the marble stairs. When he turned around the massive fountain he was relieved to spot Happy there, leaning on the hood of the limo talking to a small but georgeous blond beta.
And the current event they were all sweating through was to raise money for a very promising line of research into a controversial drug that would allow omegas to control their heat cycles.
"The drugs your foundation has been working on. The uh.. The experimental suppressants." Then Steve hurried to add, obviously feeling how tense Tony suddenly got. "Listen, I understand why you felt like you had to take them but you don't anymore, right? I'll be with you. I'll come running whenever you need me. I don't want you messing with your chemistry. I was scared witless when I found you in the shower.."
"What the hell!? Rogers, if I was going to take orders from you I'd have done that already! I thought this whole thing was because I was crap at working with you! Is this some kind of joke? Are you trying to make a point? If you were, fine. Done. Point made." Tony stopped and furiously tugged at the collar around his neck, "Get- You can get this damn thing off me now. Fuck-" He struggled with the collar but it had no buckle, it was metal and any latch it had, that Tony failed to find, refused to come apart no matter how hard Tony tugged.
“There is nothing to tell!” Tony almost shouted then looked around as he composed himself, visibly pulling his asshole cloak around him like a shield.
“Well, not permanent. Tony, are you alright? I heard you didn’t go in for a psych eval. It’s been more than a week now, aren’t you worried? I have to say, I find your new…closeness with Captain Rogers a little out of character.”
"Ye-" Tony tried to answer but Steve squeezed his cock, cutting him off, once more Tony felt breathless. "Yes..."
He rolled over to take a peek at Steve's bedside clock and the digital numbers shined red to tell him it was a little past 4 am in the morning.
“My head hurts.” Tony told him dutifully.
“Good man. You didn’t leave R&D today, did you?” Steve asked as he pulled the sunglasses off of Tony’s head to place them on the table.
Tony frowned but he kept looking at Steve with a sort of horror in his eyes.
They were at home and Steve had sat Tony down on the leather couch and wrapped him in a blanket. He had seen soldiers go into shock, he had seen them have flashbacks of the war. He knew they called it PTSD. He didn’t know Tony had it.
Unofficially, Steve realized he did see Tony as his own omega, in a non-definitive way.  And combined with the fact that he cared about Tony as a person… He decided he needed to talk to Tony. Get him alone, talk to him about his situation. Help, if he could.
He turned in Steve’s loose hold to put his fingers on the impossibly handsome face of the alpha and Steve sighed at the feeling. Tightening his hold on Tony, the alpha smiled before opening his eyes. Tony’s fingers drifted to Steve’s smiling lips and Steve kissed them. It warmed the omegas heart so much for a moment that it was almost painful, like he wouldn’t be able to contain himself.
Steve woke up to sunlight, which was unusual. He looked around for a clock and spotted the digital time display on the window. He was still in the Stark Tower then. And it was almost 8 am. He sat up on the leather couch and rubbed his eyes. He was still wearing the same shirt and pants from the day before and he was a little cold. The previous evening came back to him very fast.
"Pepper told you?"
Tony shut up. Minutes ticked by and he wondered how long it would have been. Half an hour? An hour? His arms were complaining but again, nothing he couldn't handle, certainly no where near as bad as a spanking from Captain America would be. And Tony was stubborn, he didn't want to give Steve the satisfaction of safewording out just because his arms were tired.
“Yes sir.” The AI replied but after ten minutes lying in the stifling heat, Tony still couldn’t feel a difference in the temperature. He couldn’t sleep in a room so hot, was the AC malfunctioning? He pressed his palm to his hardness to ease off the feeling a bit. It only caused sparks to shoot up his spine, making him feel terribly horny for more. He was so sweaty, maybe a cold shower would help, but when he moved to sit up he felt himself get a little wet between his cheeks and like a stroke of lightning he understood what was going on.
“Captain Rogers, sir.”
“They were experimental.”
His heat had been close but he had thought it wouldn’t hit him at least until after midnight. Then he had turned into a pumpkin. Happy hadn’t been there when he had reached the limo but his clothes had already begun to burn him, choke him, his skin itching and vision blurring.
“I’ll ask for the last time.” He said and he saw Tony gulp, his vision had narrowed down to the minutest twitch of the omegas body, “If you don’t want me, say no right now. Or I will fuck you through your heat. You will forget whatever happened between us before now. You will completely be mine.”
And Steve was gone.
The end:) Thank you very much for reading! And hugs to everyone who patiently stuck with me even when I haven't been a good girl.. I know this fic has its strengths and weaknesses,  but no matter how it turned out I had huge fun writing it. I hope it managed to entertain you too, at least sometimes. I don't think I can ever have enough of alpha!dom!Steve or omega!sub!Tony. So this is my attempt at writing them, for better or for worse. There might be fixes or additions in the future, but for now, this is it:)
It took Tony about 2 minutes to discover Steve hadn't laid out any underwear for him. Another minute to decide if that was just forgetfulness or a deliberate decision. In the end Tony was on time, standing on the gym mat, wearing a pair of shorts, a white t-shirt, his collar and nothing else, watching Steve jump rope.
“I.. I’m not sure..” Steve started, they hadn’t told Steve much. Pepper took over immediately, she reached for Tony’s hand.
“No hands. Open your mouth.”
"Did you jerk off to it?"
He pulled off his jacket immediately, resolutely ignoring his erection. It was not the time, nor the place. And instinctual urges aside, they needed to talk. Tony had much to explain before.. No matter that his animal instinct was howling at him that he had just fought off two other alphas and won the prize omega that smelled incredibly delicious, he also had strong enough will power to do the right thing.
“Tony, I told you to pretend to be an alpha but you don’t have to seduce all omegas and betas on base.”
“These suits are highly weaponized.” He reminded the other man, because of course by now, Tony knew. ”And you are not really ready for a test run. You gave Colonel Rhodes month long training before you let him touch one. And he already has military training. I’m not letting you try to fly after skimming through files for a couple of days.”
"Let go. Tony, I've got you. You're being so good and I'm so happy with you. I know you can be good, all you have to do is let go."
The cage was pinching Tony horribly now but he didn't care! He did not care! He kept licking his lips and swallowing on air. Steve's hand was speeding up as Tony incrementally knee walked to the shower stall.
Occasionally he had to work to keep his hands to himself, when Tony looked at him with those huge brown eyes, with his hair mussed because the engineer had been running his hands through it all day. He wanted to grab Tony, kiss him, then straighten his hair only to muss it up again. Preferably as he bent Tony over the workbench and fucked him until Tony screamed.
“Pour me a glass of that fine cognac you have, please Tony. And come here.” Steve told him.
Steve was confused,
"I see you Tony. If you think I've never really seen you before, you know that I do see you now. And I appreciate you for who you are."
"Yeah. I was gonna say. 5 minutes." Rhodey said then discreetly checked himself out in the mirror. Then turned to Tony and held out his arm. "Ready?" He asked.
“Somewhere in the house. Making a phone call. A guy called ‘Rhodey’, she seemed to think he needed to know about my memory thing. Who names their kid Rhodey?”
"Cecil Grant." Steve answered. To Tony he sounded distracted, Tony wondered what he might be doing sitting behind Tony with a fantastic view of the engineers ass presented for him.
Tony turned to him with a frown, "Thanks for reminding me Mr obvious. But I'm too fucking tired of pretending to be an alpha, pretending that I'm doing just fine, getting by on a couple of phone calls a year. Begging for scraps of affection from you then feeling like shit for even needing it."
Steve remembered that moment very vividly. At the time, he’d thought he was watching Iron Man die to save millions of lives.
"Thanks." Tony gritted out. "Can I get dressed now?"
Tony felt the movement of Steve's arm as the dom put the book down. It was on economic progress in Japan after the second world war, Tony noted.
"Must be uncomfortable." was all Steve said.
"No? He's not a submissive, why would he be collared?" He asked, still a bit dazed from the spot on character analysis the dom was delivering.
In the blink of an eye, Steve's hands were on Tony. He ran his fingers over Tony's jaw and neck as the omega turned to look at the others. The colonel made a rude sound but Steve simply snarled into Tony's neck, not even looking back at the other alpha. Tony's lack of objection to his very public display of 'mine-mine-my omega-mine' was very helpful in calming Steve down.
Tony didn't remember reciting his vows. Nor the walk down the isle, or the small crowd. He remembered Natasha kissing him on the cheek at some point, and Bruce congratulating him. What he remembered from the ceremony was the moment he had knelt in front of Steve and the way Steve had put the ring on his finger. Then he had bit him on the side of his neck gently to great applause.  The rest was a whirlwind of faces and congratulations until Tony had managed to make it to the open bar.
“I’ve seen the medical reports. There seems to be no detectable physical damage. The doctors can not predict a time frame for when he might recover, if he ever does.”
“Doesn’t mean I want to rape you.” Steve said, frustrated. He had his back turned to the genius so he didn’t know how Tony took it, but he decided it was either argue about the subject or try to keep going with the lunch break he had planned. Now that the food was gone, he went to grab the fanmail from the cabinet.
“Steve..”  Tony murmured as he frowned but it almost sounded like a question.
Anyway, before he could decide what he should tell the colonel, the doors of the elevator dinged and opened, letting out the Colonel.
Steve shrugged, "You can look away."
Now that Tony thought about it, it was amazing that Steve thought Tony had anything in him to give other than a good fuck. That was only because Steve was young and naive. Didn't know used up subs like Tony were just broken and were only good for one thing.
After that they hung up and Steve went back to lay down next to his omega. Tony was warm and it took less then a gentle nudge to get him to wrap all his limbs around Steve. And until Tony properly woke up to distract Steve once more, Steve laid awake, thinking of what he wanted to do to Stane, to Howard for not protecting his son better, how he’d love and care for Tony, if Tony never got his memories back, how he’d make Tony be proud of being the dazzling omega he was… He would let nothing touch Tony anymore. Not a single doubt or worry would cloud his omegas face. Steve would love and protect him and make him happy as long as Tony would have him.
"Lose the sass. The exercise I have in mind is a bit different."
Tony looked at him for a moment then concluded with his usual perceptiveness, “You don’t want me to be afraid of him.”
Steve didn’t think. The heavy, industrial strength steel lid of a 21st century dumpster hit one squarly in the face and torso, knocking him down with a sickening crunch but Steve didn’t stop to look where the body landed. He had already closed the distance between the crouching thug and the dumpster he had ripped the lip off, and grabbed the second one by the nape of his neck. A single punch was enough to knock him out and Steve threw the unconscious body onto the ground, away from Tony’s prone form.
Steve chuckled, "Yes Tony. It means sex."
“Steve. I know you’re a good man. And I do trust you. But as much as Tony trusts you with his life too, I don’t know how he will react now that he knows you know. He probably won’t like it. ”
“Tell me how I can help.” He told the other man, not really expecting an answer but still needing to know.
The colonel gave them a look but didn’t comment on it. Instead he said, in a more serious tone,
“He must have realized that it was too early for his heat.” For some reason her voice sounded a little guilty to Steve.
" Oh. Good." Tony said sheepishly. Well, it wasn't like Rogers didn't know he was a bit of a slut.
"Nothing, unless you ask me to. Now stay. You will not move until I say you can. I want you to keep holding the pennies. If you can hold them all, I'll let you come tonight. But. For every penny you drop I'll keep you caged for one more day. Drop four pennies, you'll be forbidden to come four days, seven pennies, seven days. Drop them all you won't come for ten days. Got it?"
Steve jumped out of the jet and started running. In his ear Clint was yelling at him to get back, that they could return for a recovery mission, better armed.
But, also like a puppy, Tony realized at that moment, Steve also trusted Tony.  Steve trusted him to respect Steve, respect his judgment, trusted him to be honest and open, trusted him to care.
He hang  his head and said, "Alright."
Captain snorted. "Sure Tony. Unfortunately for you, there's still the issue of punishment from when you stalled obeying the order to strip, tried to make excuses and physically ran from me. That is no way to conduct yourself for a well trained submissive. If you really do not want to do something I ask of you, you always have your words."
He turned back to see a couple of medical officers trying to pull Tony out of the land rover. They had almost managed it too but Tony was clinging to the top of it and refusing to let go. He was looking at Steve with betrayal in his eyes and Steve couldn’t understand why. Tony never liked medics but this was clearly not the reason of his panick right now.
Rogers turned towards him before opening the door, and ran a hand from his temple to his chin.
He spoke into the microphone shoved under his nose, sounding calm and collected, trying to relay his geniune belief in the cause. And when he could get away from the suffocating crowd he moved to a secluded corner to breathe for a few minutes. And of course to watch Tony.
He swung the chair left and right as he scrolled through his texts, unseeing. All he could do right now was to look as unfazed as possible. Not show fear.
"You love me Potts." Tony skipped a step forward to snatch a kiss from her cheek, then he twirled around and said "I look amazing. Hottest piece of ass on this side of the planet. Actually no, on every side of the planet. Maybe comparable only to Steve. No? Yes?" He grinned.
Steve was relieved to see Pepper clicking her way through the corridor in her expensive heels along a nurse. They exchanged a short greeting, apparently Pepper was listed as Tony’s emergency contact. She had come as soon as had been possible, considering Tony seemed to be fine, just under surveillance.
Tony's eyes boggled.
"Alright." he agreed easily.
Steve didn’t miss Tony taking a step towards Steve then stopping himself as he asked.
He'd spent most of his ten minutes sitting on the bed in his underwear, contemplating what he wanted to do. He could still back out. The government still had to let him keep his suits. He could keep on doing his thing solo. It would save him a lot of money too. But he had gotten used to being part of something, someone having his back. The thought of going back now felt so lonely and a little bit like defeat.
“Yeah.” Tony shrugged. “So, sorry I don’t remember you.”
“But Stane persevered. He had been so sure Tony would turn out to be an omega. He always waited for his chance to prove it. And when he couldn’t…”
What a load of bullshit. There was no such thing as a safe alpha. Alphas didn’t keep you safe, they used you, hurt you, stole from you, they wanted to own you, strip you of your humanity. Tony despised the vision he must have provided Steve at that moment. Shame burned hot in his gut, causing tears to blur his vision this time. He had clung to Steve like a helpless limpet, as if this dumb military kid had all the answers to the universe. And it had felt good.
“Yes. But no more questions out of you. Be quiet.”
“What the..” Steve wanted to ask. He wanted to articulate all the questions floating around in his head but now that the danger was over, he was once more assaulted by the heat scent which was clearly pouring off of Tony.
"I'm not sorry."
“What are you doing here.” Steve spit out finally, it came out more like an accusation than a question.
Tony’s mind reeled. He took another sip from the glass he was holding, Pepper had given it to him, saying that it was his favorite. It was a shame he couldn’t really taste it other then the burn the cognac provided.
Steve Rogers could be fooled like everyone else.
Putting his fork down Steve laughed at Tony's expression for a second then grabbing him around the waist pulled him into his lap. Tony squeaked.
Maybe he just didn't want to be seen submitting. Taking orders, obeying without an argument.  Like a meek little subby thing. He was proud to be submissive but he always hated the lost little lamb image submissives got. He didn't need a dominant, he didn't need orders or protection. He was Tony Stark for fucks sake, Ironman, billionaire, philantropist, playboy.. He didn't fetch drinks, people lined up to fetch /him/ drinks.
Then he looked at Steve, this time Steve could see a hidden vulnerability in his eyes. "I know Steve will take good care of it. Pep's the CEO anyway. The company will be in good hands. And I.. I'll be in good hands. This is the only way I can safely bring the document into the board of directors to declare it null. On my own terms. This is me breaking my chains, if you want to get dramatic about it."
"No news is good news I think." Steve said, clearly continuing a conversation they were having while Tony was in the kitchen.
"You're bouncing off the walls. Sit down."
It was mostly decorated in warm colors, hallway separated from the living area with cream colored shelves, paintings and frames stacked around, leaning on the walls, waiting to be put up. He'd seen the kitchen and the brown leather couches that faced a decent sized fireplace. The hallway lead to a row of rooms, Rogers opened the first door, "This is the bathroom."
"If you keep giving me lip about it I'll have to think of a way to make you less eager to question every order."
Steve just looked at him, this time repressed anger clear behind the cold eyes. "I might not be a genius like you Tony, but I am far from the dumb blond people assume I am. I'd thought you knew at least that much. Give me some credit, I can at least make decisions for myself."
“Tony?” Banner’s face was suddenly very close to his.
"Good boy."
"And I mean everything Tony. That's the ultimate no. If you are uncomfortable or want to take a break however, you can use the color codes."
"Good, now turn left, and take 2 steps, then go on all fours, keep going until I tell you to stop."
"Stay."
How much of Tony’s memories were gone? If he didn’t remember Pepper, why did Tony remember Steve?
The genius had gripped his wrist now, his moves uncoordinated but Steve could tell he was trying to get Steve to put in more fingers, to fuck him, anything..
Tony was shaking his head anyway.
"Done."
“You didn’t.” Steve said into Tony’s hair. He debated with himself if he wanted to tell Tony more, then decided getting closure on a half memory couldn’t hurt at this point.
“Alright, then at least let the doctors of the SHIELD infirmary take a look at him!” Steve raised his voice without meaning to.
Steve looked at him, shoulders straight and jaw firm but something in his eyes wasn't right. A minute stretched between them, making Tony grow nervous. Eventually when Steve spoke his voice was unreadable, he sounded completely normal, despite what he'd said.
After some hours in which the infirmary staff had started giving Steve annoyed and confused looks, Pepper arrived. After all, there wasn’t actually much reason for Steve to still be there. The Avengers got injured often during fights, and barring the fact that Coulson sometimes waited outside Clint’s door, none of them had ever seen the need for it. They were friends, yes, but injury wasn’t shocking to anyone anymore. Shit happened, you bounced back.
“Is there a video of it? I wanna see..” Tony reached for the Starkpad but Steve took it from him.
Tony starts to catch feelings and it scares the crap out of him.
I know I have been gone for a long time. I got lots of amazing comments on this and I have been reading each and everyone, I was just very overwhelmed to answer everyone individually. I still appreciated every word. I do feel very guilty, I apologize for not replying on time. You are all amazing people, every single one. I am sorry couldn't show my appreciation more.
Suddenly Tony felt panic. Was he really going to do this? Someone was already telling him what to do, what to say... It was instantly suffocating, like he was free falling with air rushing past so fast that he couldn't catch a breath.
"Don't you assume what Tony is or isn't to me." He growled through his teeth. "He is mine."
He gently pulled his leg back from where Tony was leaning on it and Tony’s shoulders slumped.
"Good morning," he said, carefully neutral.
"This is not the 1940's..." he said.
“Good. Now come here.”
“Yes! Yes! I’m sure! What are you even waiting for?”
"I want to know how you feel, in general. About this arrangement, about your punishment, about today." There was a pause. "Or about anything else you want to talk about. You can take your time. We've got all night."
For all his outward apperance of a casanova, Tony Stark was a man who believed in freedom and despised the abuse the current culture was forcing the omegas into. Steve highly respected that.  Compared to the 40’s, he could see the huge progress in omega rights but the wider access to information had also opened his eyes to the true scope of the abuse omegas went through.
"You can come Tony." Steve murmured, sounding wrecked himself. "Go ahead and come for me sweetheart."
"I'm born ready baby. Why don't you try and see?" Tony cocked a hip and pinched his nipple. Steve's frown only deepened.
Both Pepper and Steve had meantioned Colonel Rhodes. They said the guy was an alpha so maybe Tony had knelt for him before? And never mentioned their relationship to anyone, not even Pepper? But he couldn’t picture himself kneeling for the black guy he had seen the photo of. The Colonel looked intimidating and cold, was he any different in person? And if Tony had any sort of alpha-omega relationship with him wouldn’t the guy have had made an impression enough to make Tony remember him through his amnesia like he remembered Steve? Tony came to the conclusion that no, Steve was different. Steve must have meant something to him before his memory loss. More than any other person in his life.
And to Tony's horror, the Captain pulled out a cock cage.  Tony's cock  leapt.
He had been half keeping faith with Peggy until the night of the fundraiser. Of course Peggy had been an alpha and those kinds of relationships had never been approved of back then, so it was doomed before Steve had gone into ice. Yet she had her place in his heart, never to be filled up by anyone else. Despite that, Steve had a big heart. He had come to care for a lot of people since he woke up. Natasha, Clint, Coulson, Bruce, Thor, Pepper and of course Tony.
The sub shrugged, but kept stroking himself, one of his hands trailed up his stomach to find a nipple.
For a moment Tony stood there, bereft in his own home, just looking at Steve. Steve knew he was waiting for something, really anything would do.
Tony sat there seemingly seriously considering what Steve had said. Then he spoke just when his silence was starting to make Steve nervous.
"Whatever."
"Fine! Damn.. " With one last look around Tony pulled his shorts down until his cock was exposed.
He pulled the rest of his clothes off and went to take a shower.
"Alright, come here. Your punishment is almost over. Now you only need to tidy up your mess. Then I'll let you sleep. How does that sound?"
Steve placed a hand between Tony’s shoulderblades. The possessive gesture unintentional but Steve sort of needed the contact.
"Don't tell me you didn't fuck your boss Barton. Some hot dom on dom action.. Nothing wrong with that, it's the 21st century." Tony was mostly aiming for making Barton uncomfortable but it didn't seem to work, because Barton simply nodded.
“Hey,” he smiled and pushed the papers aside when Tony strolled in. He looked fine, happy even, his hands in his pockets and a pair of red tinged sunglasses pushed up to his forehead, he looked the same as he did before the head wound, confident, like he owned the place and everything in it.
“We need to talk.” She said, kindly but still very decisively.
So he would smile and bare the attention if it landed that much more credibility into the event that famously controvertial Stark Industries organized. The republicans wouldn’t like that Captain America would be seen supporting the heat supressant drug research but that fact only made his presence in the fundraiser more important. After all Captain America stood for liberty as much as he stood for American tradition.
“Jarvis! How long has it been since my last heat?”
“I didn’t Tony. These are SHIELD medics. They are trying to help.”
The question seemed out of the blue but it told Steve what Tony’s primary concern was. Tony was afraid that Steve had taken advantage of him in his heat.
A little smile appeared on the corner of Steve's lips.
There was dead silence in the room when the dominants electronically changed voice fell silent. Tony realised he was looking at his hands in his lap, shoulders slumped.
“You take the East road. I’ll take North. If he’s walking he couldn’t have gone too far.”
“Uh..” Tony dumbly uttered but it came out more of a moan than anything else.
He knew he had to pull his hand back, he knew he needed to warn Tony, or have another talk with him, make it clear that their relationship couldn’t be a sexual one until Tony was in a state that he could give informed consent.
Steve smiled at him.
Immediately Rogers reached out a hand to touch his hair, finger brushing back the carefully touseled look. Tony felt a little bit like a pet.
"I'm starting to appreciate it." Tony squeaked.
Now curious, Tony did.
“…but the order had already been given. You told Nat to keep the portal open. It was very clever really. Brave and selfless too. When you disappeared into the worm hole they say…”
Steve blinked, the room was dead silent for a moment.
He smiled nervously and said, "Well. I remembered all.. the things...?"
But it was clear in the way her eyes crinkled a little that she was missing her Tony. The one with the sharp wit and the sharper tongue.
"Come here and let me take a look at the cage." Steve ordered right after Tony had finished washing the dishes. He'd been wearing the sweatpants and shirt Steve lent him, all afternoon. Now getting undressed once again seemed curiously embarrasing. But Tony got over is much faster this time.
“Okay.”
But Steve didn't touch him again, for a long time. Tony waited with bated breath, eyes closed tight. Nothing.
“I see your point Captain. I haven’t had a chance to talk to Mr Stark much since his very brief debriefing. How is he doing?”
He tried to sit up and pressed the heels of his hands into his eyes, trying to rub out the remaining tears.
Why did this feel like a breakup? Ridiculous. They had been dom and sub for what, 4 days? Why did Tony care if Steve formed an attachment way too fast, like a puppy?
"Look, about last night. You shouldn't pay attention to what I say after a spanking like that. I wasn't myself, I spill stupid crap sometimes when I'm out of my head. It's dumb really."
“If you think it’ll help, I’ll compile a file and send it to you.” He said, without taking his eyes off the computer screen.
"Good. You're doing good Tony." The Captain said, handing him a towel. Tony gratefully wiped his face and neck.
“Why wouldn’t you? You don’t owe me anything. You were just being nice this whole damn time.” Tony answered but it came out resigned.
“Mm-hmm.” Steve nodded and flipped another page. They’d had that talk a million times already. “Not even that glorified.”
"You are not going anywhere." Steve told him, big hands squeezing Tony's shoulders. "I don't want a nice sub or the blond down the hall. I made my pick."
And drink it, on his expensive leather couch, watch TV maybe, unbeaten, unbroken, unowned. Without a team, without much purpose. Without satisfaction. Not really belonging anywhere, anything or anyone.
"Welcome to the Rogers domicile madam, how may I help you?" He bowed low with a flourish of his hand, his words coming out with a pompous fake English accent.
He opened his mouth to apologize... Steve was looking at him, expectant and guarded.
"Yes. It's fair." he said eventually.
"But the sun shines out of Coulson's ass I bet."
He was washing his hands when Steve walked in.
"I'm very sorry??" Tony tried again.
To Tony's massive disappointment, Steve didn't give him a show in the shower this time. But he made Tony shower first and put the cock ring back on him.
"You can just let go Tony, let go for me."
At first he slowly started to shake his head, then more clearly. "No. No I don't want to use my safeword. I think.. I think I did deserve a punishment." He raised his eyes and looked at Steve from under his eyelashes and saw the captains expression change. It was relief that crept into his eyes and Tony himself was relieved to see it.
Actually, fuck this. He wasn't going to be awkward or embarrased. He was Tony fucking Stark. Yeah, Steve Rogers was a picture of perfection but Tony Stark was hot. He knew he had a good body, and he knew how to use it. Confidence was his thing. If Steve wanted him naked, Tony could do naked. All he needed was to ignore the possibility of Mrs Gernsteins of the apartment block walking in at any moment. But he supposed, Steve wasn't the kind of guy that'd set Tony up for that kind of embarrasment.
"Tell me how you feel." Steve ordered and Tony didn't even think about how he should answer, for once.
The medics immediately swarmed around them again and pulled an unresisting Tony onto the stretcher. Steve stood up.
“What he is saying is that I’m damaged goods now.” Tony didn’t sound offended or angry. He sounded matter of fact.
Tony Stark, rooting around in trash while collared and naked, in Captain America's kitchen. If this wasn't the most embarrasing thing he'd done he didn't know what was. Somehow it was even more embarrasing then that one time when he'd puked on that girl while she was giving him a blow job.
"And you know what else?" Tony went on dropping his hands from his face, Steve crooked an eyebrow.
"Crap.." he sat up in bed, feeling disoriented, and remembered what had happened. He'd gone to bed so happy, how had he managed to fuck it up between last night and this morning? And he had no clue where he stood with Steve now. Should he just make breakfast?
There was a moment of silence in which Tony just let himself be, then Steve's hand was back on his upraised cheek.
"Not that, I mean-"
The part where Rogers had given him a speech taking apart Tony's motivations had been the scariest part. Who knew Rogers had paid attention? And it had all been true, if incomplete. Just the tiny glimmer of hope that a dominant of Captain America's calibre might be able to understand him and dominate him, was what made Tony make his mind up. He was going to do this. He'd go through with it. Whatever Rogers wanted. He'd do his best, and if it didn't work out he'd at least have the excuse of having tried. After all it wasn't his fault if he was too fucked up to function like a normal submissive. He'd just have to live with it.
Steve was looking at Tony with almost fear in his eyes. Tony realised he wasn't doing a good job, putting his emotions into words.
Before he could get the words out, sensing what Steve was about to say Tony bowed his head forward and to the side, exposing his neck and looking up at Steve under his thick eyelashes in the most beautifully submissive gesture Steve had ever seen.
And yet, nothing compared to what Steve was trying so hard to ignore right now. His erection hadn’t gone down. Not since he had first smelled Tony. Not while he carried him to Happy, not while he argued with Pepper that, no Steve would go to the tower along with them and he wasn't leaving until he got an explanation. He had blushed when Pepper had glanced pointedly to the front of his trousers but he wouldn’t budge. His balls hurt, and he couldn’t sit comfortably, the images of what Tony must look like right this moment constantly playing various scenarios on the back of his consciousness, but he stayed.
Surely, James Rhodes helped his buddy out occasionally? Or were they already lovers?
"Nope."
With nothing else to do, he had gone back to his apartment to shower and change, get the blood and dust off of himself. Then he had dodged Coulson’s attempts at getting a report on what had happened. What would Steve say if Coulson asked about Tony’s very out of character, very non-alpha behavior? He felt guilty too. He should have kept an eye out, watched Tony’s back and he hadn’t. He had known Clint was too distracted, he himself should have taken over but, none of them had seen the missile.
"Alright, come here." Steve gestured for Tony to come closer as he fell into a sort of parade rest, straightening his shoulders.  It was the 'you're in for it now' stance the Cap had going, but Tony couldn't tell if it was the good kind or the bad kind.
The hand in his hair tightened and Tony's heartbeat picked up, maybe he shouldn't have said the last part.
"Oh you sneaky bast- sneak! How do you even know how to cook?" Tony was already seated at the table and was digging in as he spoke, "I thought you said you ate canned spaghetti!"
But Tony was already answering the reporters question on the screen.
For a moment it was quiet outside. Tony’s burning form falling kept replaying in front of his eyes but he needed to pull himself together. This would NOT happen a second time. He had been unable to help Bucky. He wouldn’t leave Tony behind. Alive, or dead.
“Yes, big guy, thanks. Exactly what I needed from an alpha. Rules and regulations..”
"Nothing that can't wait. It'll be fine."
At that Pepper flashed him a sincere look of worry but her expression smoothed over in less than a second.
“You seem to be in a good mood today.” Steve commented when he swallowed his last bite and reached for another slice from Tony’s lap.
When his shirt fell open to reveal the glow of it behind the undershirt Tony was wearing, the Captain touched it gently. This time Tony forced himself to hold still, because this was Steve Rogers.  His team mate, one of the best men he knew, if not the best. He did trust him with his life. It would take a bit more work to trust him with his dignity but Tony knew Rogers wouldn't knowingly put him in danger.
“It’s a cube, about this big. The greatest energy source known. It is said to be the crown jewel of Odin’s treasury. Found in the ocean after Captain America went down with it in 42. It was your father that found it. Then SHIELD started to…” But at that point Banner seemed to realize he was basically giving away very confidential information, without permission. Even if it was to Tony Stark.
“Oh Tony.. ” But the omega was still peacefully snuggled up in the covers, blissfully unaware of how much he was breaking Steve’s heart. How desperate and unhappy Tony had been before the amnesia..
There was a reason no dom stuck around, even when Tony was Steve's age. Now, just because Steve was too decent to turn down a charity case, he was stuck with the broken sub.
"About?"
"Got it."
But Pepper was already shaking her had.
"Are you going to fuck me?" He asked this time, the question came out quieter, more shy.
Tony beamed at him.
Tony’s legs moved to open further and he hooked a knee on Steve’s arm to pull his hips up, offer himself more fully, to be taken and to be claimed.
The belt came free of the loops and Rogers laid it on the couch.
"Tony, look at me." Steve said and Tony looked up at him. Steve looked so beautiful in the gentle fire light. His mouth was firm but his eyes were kind.
The captain immediately sat up straight when Tony stepped in.
"Good morning." Tony couldn't help but smile back.
There was a short pause in which Tony felt Jarvis judge him intensely.
“What?”
“What is it Jarvis? SHIELD?”
The agent who showed him to the room watched Tony pull out a chair and drape himself across it, nonechalant and comfortable.
The dom just sat there and watched Tony load the dishwasher and wash whatever needed to be washed in the sink.
Steve was lightning quick. He grabbed Tony’s arms and pressed him to the wall, extending the effort to restrain himself from doing more.
For a moment he considered just walking back and telling Rogers that, too late, the boxes are already in trash. Then he cosidered just lying and telling him he did recycle. But this was their first dinner, and Tony had decided to make an effort to obey. He looked out of the kitchen to see Steve sitting calmly in front of the fire, busy with something in his lap, out of Tony's field of vision, he turned and looked at the trash can, then with a grimace lifted the cover of it to pull out the boxes.
Tony’s eyebrows went up this time, like he was gonna say something, then,
Steve stood there with the edge of his vision going a little grey while Tony held out the papers to him. He didn't care about any papers, he didn't care who was in the room. Tony was saying.. He'd just said he had remembered. Everything.
"Now listen. Last night was a punishment. Both for disobeying my first order and for disregarding as simple an order as cleaning up after our meal. You've consented to endurance, humiliation, as long as it's not public, and even piss play, on your check list. Your biggest weapon is your genius but your mind can also be your worst enemy. Last night you took your punishment beautifully and went into subspace like it was coming home. In the end, for once, you were calm and happy Tony. I saw it in you."
Steve looked awkward, waiting for Tony by the door and Tony took a moment to feel embarrassed at how he had just assumed the guy was his—He shook his head.
"I don't know, fucking apologize?!"
And so, 10 minutes later, Tony was standing in the middle of the wet kitchen floor, naked save for his collar and cock ring, holding his mop and bucket, trying to figure out a way of walking out without leaving footprints.
“I just told you I don’t want to. Free country and all that, right?” Tony snapped.
A dark head immediately appeared from behind the leather couch, Tony’s face was stretched into a huge smile, he looked carefree and very happy to see Steve. Or the pizza, at least.
Tony clawed at Steve’s back at the sensation, Steve didn’t mind but he grabbed Tony’s arms and pressed them into the covers next to Tony’s head. The omega was moaning right next to his ear and Steve couldn’t have stopped now, even if he’d wanted to. He kept pushing, slowly but surely until he felt his balls touch Tony’s skin.
In reply Steve just made a mmm mmm sound, exaggerating his enjoyment of the food.
He had to memorize the names and faces of the few people who knew his secret. God, and what a secret. How had he done it? How? And more importantly, could he do it again? Keep pretending through his memory loss? Did he want to?
"Tony.. " The colonel voice broke in, it was clearer now, carrying a warning of disapproval.
Tony raised an eyebrow as he finally looked at Steve.
Steve paced some more as Pepper curled up on the couch.  An old and forgotten document, written by the hand of a dead and beaten man. It still hounded Tony’s steps. And more importantly… Tony was an omega??
Tony shivered.
“It’s alright Steve.” He said with a small smile. “I’m good here.” Then he added, sincerely, “Thank you.”
"Get back onto the bathmat." Steve ordered, then turned to wash himself.
'Dressed to Impress' by radiophile
"Seriously??"
“We’re not fighting!” Steve bit back a growl and bit his tongue to stop himself from uttering anything like ‘Tony belongs to me’.
Steve’s couldn’t hold back a small laugh, maybe Tony acted like he resented obeying Steve but Steve could tell Tony wasn’t really bothered. At least not enough to forego innuendo.
"I don't want anyone else!" Tony said.
"Tony.." Steve gaped for just a second then he rushed to the omega. "What.. Where have you been?"  He moved to hug Tony but stopped himself short, unsure of where he stood with the genius once more. He ached to grab Tony and run basically, but he wasn't so far gone as to slam Tony into walls either. Tony though, could apparently see the state he was in, with Steve's hair disheveled from running his fingers through it, his face flushed and breathing hard.
“Coulson?” Tony sat up, then he realized where he was sitting up from. “Oh shit. Coulson.” He tried to scramble out of Steve’s lap but considering that the damage was already done, Steve hang on, not letting him get away.
“Where did Cap sleep?”
“Tony, I’m your team leader. You should have told me.”
"Steve I -"
"Fuck!"
“Look, I don’t have to explain Tony’s personal business to you, but I’m sure you know I’m the only one he remembers. Do you have any idea how scary it is to wake up to a foreign world? To feel alone? He needs time to get to know people and trust them. For now, I’m the only one he can easily trust. I can’t just leave him alone.”
It was the first time Tony got a view of Cap's cock with absolutely zero obstruction. The glass plane of the shower stall was not nearly foggy enough yet.
Tony felt his shoulders slump.
"It's just salt Tony. I happen to think you've done very well. I'll add to your tally for calling yourself names." The dom said between putting the shaker down and tasting the eggs. "See? There, perfectly good."
"I never consented to being forced to pee in a fucking bottle!"
Tony got to work, not really noticing any of the labels on the cans and bottles and boxes any more, he just collected everything he'd spread out and put it all in the recycling bin, then cleaned up the floor with a piece of cloth Steve held out to him. When he was done he was incredibly tired but his arms and legs didn't ache as bad any more.
A bit disconcerted that he wouldn't get privacy even in the shower, Tony went in. The stall was plain clear glass. It felt a bit cramped after Tony's own shower (sauna), but he supposed it was still as comfortable as it could get in mid Brooklyn.
“Tell me you won’t.” He said.
Tony stared at the carpeting, arranging and rearranging the periodic table in his head according to various aspects of the elements. According to atomic nuclei spins, from thickest, to thinnest, at extreme temperatures and so on.. He could smell the food but he understood what Steve was trying to do. The alpha wanted to give Tony some space, in which he could just exist and do nothing else. Only, it took a bit of work for Tony to slow down his brain enough to breathe.
Tony’s eyes grew a little and he shivered, so Steve knew the omega remembered.
Then it occurred to Steve that Tony might be a virgin.
Next time he saw the genius was in the mess hall during lunch.
Steve huffed in annoyance but he was nothing if not determined so he followed Tony to his car. Luckily Happy wasn’t around and Tony had driven himself today.
“Give me a reason not to, then.”
"I'm sorry?" Tony asked, more to try his luck than because he was actually apologetic. He was torn between arousal and hesitancy to take on Steve's brand of orgasm control.
It went on like that for a while, Steve taking breakes from feeding Tony, to eat himself, and Tony felt himself relax further. He leaned in to Steve’s leg and even ate the broccoli without complaint. Distantly he recognized that he didn’t like the taste but he couldn’t be bothered to worry about it, Steve wanted him to eat his veggies so he would. It was simple as that.
Again, it was Steve that drove them to SHIELD. On the way, Tony prattled on about the car he chose today, but it was a model too new for Steve’s tastes. And apparently German. Customized to a t, Steve couldn’t deny that it handled like a dream.
“No sir. Mr Stark is in the shower,”
Tony had clearly okayed chastity devices and orgasm control on his contract. He'd played around with the concepts (and the toys) before, and throughly enjoyed himself. But he suspected with the Captain as his dom it would go a little above 'play' and either way, when it came to sex, Tony still felt a bit awkward around Steve. It didn't help that the idea was very interesting to his threatened parts.
"Yes." Tony answered immediately.
"You don't want me," Steve stated, again, not sounding upset, hurt, or surprised. Just.. blank. Which was much more unsettling to Tony.
Update: Edited upon correction by Hikaru_Uchida :) Thank you!
Tony huffed out a laugh.
He didn't even see the gag till it was right up in his face and then in his mouth, pushing his jaw open.
She shook her head. “It is a little funny. I’m sorry. Tony, Steve is an old fashioned guy. He wouldn’t go for a horde or even two omegas. And I know for a fact that he isn’t seeing anyone.”
Tony had built safe houses for omegas who needed protection from their abusive spouses or family members. Steve had seen the people in them. Omegas who had nowhere else to go, who had no education or ability to take care of themselves.  Who had been subjected to violence, slavery and rape. Tony gave them shelter, education and protection.
He wrapped Tony in the jacket and picked him up. Something that would be impossible to do if Tony had been his usual self. The brilliant engineer and egotistical alpha that Steve knew would never had borne the humiliation of being carried around by anyone. Yet right now, Tony was trembling so hard Steve could almost hear his bones rattle as Tony clung to Steve with all his might, burying his dark head beneath Steve’s chin in a comfort seeking gesture and moaning lightly. It was the pure surrender and dependance of an omega that threatened to short circuit Steve’s brain combined with Tony’s strong scent right under his nose.
But when she looked up Tony was looking at Steve rather than at Pepper. He felt like he had to say something.
Tony sat up in bed.
Half an hour later, with more than a little help from Jarvis, he had managed to produce coffee, toast and a pan of scrambled eggs. He decided to let Tony sleep however long he would, and set aside Tony’s portion. He was trying to get used to the tablet Jarvis had told him he could use to read the newspaper when Jarvis once more interrupted the silence.
“Nobody. Nobody told me anything because you told them not to.” Tony said, his voice full of accusation. But then he did walk around the desk and stiffly went to his knees next to Steve. Steve reflexively put a hand on his head.
He tried to beg worldlessly, with his body, with his breath, with every long shakey moan out of his mouth as Steve kept licking and sucking and pressing in relentlessly.
“He didn’t like to talk about it with me because even if he had to tell me when he’d go into heat so I could cover for him, he knew every time the subject of drugs came up I’d try to make him stop taking them. He couldn’t exactly go behind my back but.. And I didn’t think.. I didn’t think of reminding Tony of them. After the accident.”
"Because I'm not good for you." Tony turned around, calm. "I am not being petty or angry... Definitely not fishing for praise. It's just a fact. You deserve much better. I should just.. leave you alone. Maybe you'll meet a nice sub. The blond down the hall. Who knows."
Tony blushed. It took a moment but then he opened his mouth, choosing not to question too closely how ridiculous he probably looked. Steve’s hand came back and the next moment all he could think was how delicious the prawn tasted and how hungry he had gotten without realizing it.
"Come here." Steve said, holding out a hand. Tony slowly crawled back into his initial position where he was kneeling next to Steve. Steve's hand immediately found his way into his hair.
Tony was suddenly both aroused and nervous. He'd been spanked before, of course he'd been. He'd been whipped, flogged, paddled, even caned that one time. Which wasn't gonna happen ever again. But... Something felt different now. He felt more shy, almost scared.
“Tony. How are you feeling?”
"That's right. You're not alone."
“See? I know you can be good. Did you have fun? Was it interesting?”
“We don’t know that.” She said firmly.
“Only until you get your memories back.” He said before making any other move, his voice came out deep and low anyway. Tony nodded his head the tiniest bit, like he was afraid of dislodging Steve’s grip. Steve tightened his fingers just a fraction and Tony’s breath hitched, the scent of arousal spiked, nowhere near close to how Tony had smelled during his heat but still enough to make Steve forget where they were. This time it was different to Tony’s heat, this time Tony was offering himself to Steve. He wasn’t unattainable. He was begging for it.
"No, no and no. Fine I get it, it was my choice. It was either this, or be kicked out of the team. I could have said no. I said yes. Doesn't mean I have to like it."
“Dumm- E.” He snapped his fingers and the bot obediently brought him a rag to wipe his hands on. “Close shop for the day. Daddy needs a drink.” He said and left to pour himself a double of his strongest.
Steve hummed and moved his hips slightly until Tony felt his hardness press into his thigh. Damn but he wanted Steve again. He didn’t know what time it was, he didn’t care if he had stuff planned for the day. He couldn’t remember or bother to try figuring out what the world was doing anyway.
Steve smiled a little, “Very cool when it happens in the right time.” Then he coughed, “But it’s unfair to describe him as a monster. ”
"I.. That's ok. I hadn't realised you were drawing."
Hesitantly he laid his palm on Tony’s cheek, smearing blood, feeling queasy at the feel of Tony’s blood on his hands but he did try to concentrate on the feel of warm skin beneath and took a deep breath. Scent of blood and fear was heavy but it was normal when there was fighting going on. Still, Tony was definitely alive.  First order of business, get Tony out of here, in the suit. He’d have to carry him but Steve could do that easily. Only trouble was, they were a long way away from the border. Then he would have to take the armor off and administer first aid. He could do this.
Suddenly feeling drained and defeated Tony stood in the middle of the foyer, looking forlorn. Rogers threw his keys in a bowl, turned on the light, and came back to stand in front of Tony.
But Steve was already shaking his head, helplessly. He didn't want Tony's money.
"Alright. Just... Don't let me break a leg or anything, alright?"
It sounded good to Tony so he nodded and followed along when Steve lead him into the kitchen.
“Well you do remember how to flirt. That’s good to know.” She said, then added, “But onto more serious matters, Tony, Steve was right, I do have to tell you some things.”
"I'll show you your room." The dom said as Tony grabbed his clothes.
The door gave way with a loud crack and swung open.
"Steve you are misunderstanding this! I never wanted any dom!"
"I'm.. ok. My ass hurts. But." He wiped his nose on his own arm. He was just too comfortable. Too relaxed. The pain was there of course but not enough to disract from how good it felt to just lean on his dom and be comforted.
“Starla Anne DeWard, and I do
Steve ran a hand down Tony's back, rubbing idly at his shoulder blade and the dip of his spine, happy to collect a soft, contented hum. He sank into the idle strokes of Tony's fingers. He watched Tony's head rise and fall on his chest.
"You think you can fool me? I know you, Steve. I know all of you. Intimately, inside and out." Low and menacing, Tony spoke with his lips to Steve's ear.
Warm breath and a point of wet tickled lightly at his inner thigh. Steve scooched his hips, squirming down a little lower into the couch and letting his legs fall open wider as Tony's tonguetip traced its way up.
She curled her grip around his belt buckle, and it pulled at the crotch of his slacks, dug his inseam up into his balls.
Tony did a quick "
The storm broke.
And still, it had surprised him when there was no sizzle, no steam hissing up, the contact, even stilted, so electric to his nerves.
ged sport."
He'd shown up through the dimensional gate in Richards' lab one afternoon, dressed in a worn hoodie and jeans, with an armored Captain America uniform and shield in one locked case -- opened once then never again -- and his leather in another. A man of few words, closer to silent than succinct, he shared little more than he was from a plane where "his" Tony Stark had been lost to... something apparently unspeakable.
Leaving Tony with a squeeze to the shoulder, he strode across the floor, pausing only to shoot a grin and thumbs-up back when he passed the Self-Care board, mouthing with a stage-whisper, "reward later." Tony grinned wolfishly in return, leaning a hip against the workbench to observe.
“Decided to take me up on that little taste, after all?”
Tony's hands hadn't changed position; they were still outstretched atop Steve's knees, outwardly motionless. But every few breaths, involuntary muscle contractions would have a fingertip or two pressing a little harder, or sliding a fraction of an inch up or down Steve's leg.
There was no point, no place, for another breath. The rest of his chest had just filled with metal.
Steve could tell why he said it. Within a few unfamiliar syllables, he could hear the difference in the way the words flowed like melody from the old man's lips.

The hard, gleaming expanses were acoustically reflective, too, making it trickier to pinpoint sounds to their sources, especially with visual cues already partially displaced. The
,” she groaned, her eyes closed and face contorted in an open-mouthed display of unappeased want.
He ignored the discomfort, doing a few controlled-breathing exercises while he sipped from the heavy, cut-glass tumbler, and took out his cell phone to send a text message to Tony:
at it, the same way he always did, the same old cover-up for being of no inherent worth in himself, the same old delusion that he could give any gift that wasn't a curse.
Was Tony catering to this many different partners? Was Steve just another in a long line? They'd been dancing around each other for some time, obvious in their appreciative glances, their too-close stances, their perfectly incidental touches, obvious in the frequent little tugs, the measurements of tension, on strings that ran both ways.
Or he wouldn't. Tony was counting again. Ten. Twenty. And Steve did not vary.
“Hell yeah. Thanks, Starla. Way to go with the empress’s new undies,” he gritted out.
Seeming to have concluded one line of thought at least to his own satisfaction, Tony turned his head to catch Steve's eyes, shooting him a sparkling smile. "So! You ready to go shopping?"
So when Steve came home with Irish Spring and Ivory, Tony countered with bay rum and bergamot. Inevitable to amass numerous varieties, nearly as many bars and cakes as bottles bought, but who was counting?
Still, with every fiber of his shrapnel-rent heart, he would have rather been happy than right. But that had never been a choice his life had left him. That was fine; he understood it like a mathematical constant. He'd just wanted to make
DUM-E made a decidely dejected sound in response, continuing to "hug" the shield like a security blanket.

Wanted to feed that joy like a carefully tended spark, shelter it from the whipping wind that was the hurt and loss and wrong of the world, coax and nurture that tiny flame so it could thrive and warm and sustain them in turn.
Steve could tell it was much more an effort for Tony to heft the cumbersome bundle compared to his own relative ease, but it still renewed his recognition of their benefactor's fitness, and despite Tony's enormous wealth, his ever-readiness to wade right in and lend his muscle to manual labor.
He went lax, kept himself pliant, as Steve positioned him. Though it was required that they both must reach completion, Steve, as usual, seemed to have already formulated an action plan, and Tony would let him carry it out with no opposition. Whatever he could do to make this easiest for Steve.
, to letting them try, even though to his foundation, he knew better. He'd just wanted to make Steve happy, to give him everything, even if it meant committing the cardinal sin of accepting that his own fulfillment was required for it to be possible.
She slipped off her stool, taking him to his feet along with her. In her low heels, they were almost exactly of a height. Her eyes danced and glittered with the most enticing kinds of trouble.
Tony kept on jerking him and sucking in quick, hard pulses, alternating his tongue between underside and crown, rubbing with the flat of it and darting with the tip, lapping up the welling precome. Steve's balls were so full that the touch became a whole new torment when Tony took and rolled them in his other hand, then reached back to press a hard rub behind them. Like a flanking maneuver, it was stars and sparks jolting him from yet another angle, deep within.
Pounding water debrided the scorched-earth remains of their matrimony. A silty pool rose slowly over their feet, the detritus sluicing off them faster than the pummeling streams could drive it down the drain.
A few feet from him, Steve reached out to rest one hand on DUM-E's strut. "We love you for exactly who and how you are, no matter what. Not for what work you can do, or how fast you can go, or how many things you can put away."
Still coordinating smoothly, Tony moving forward and Steve stepping back, they walked their oversized parcel into the house. Jarvis held the door and kept himself safely out of the way; if any other Avengers had returned yet from their own activities of the day, they must have been occupying other areas of the building. Steve and Tony encountered no one else as they proceeded through the dining hall, then swung around through a 90-degree rotation to enter the library.
Hands -- Tony lowered one to trail through Steve's fine, gold hair, once, absently pleased by the liquid softness of the strands, before replacing the arm in its original position along the back of the couch. Steve whined faintly. Tony left it unaddressed; his conversation with the cybersecurity specialist seated to his left and the roboticist standing angled to face them never faltered. Nor did his gaze shift down or center. It was fascinating, and illicitly amusing, to hear them speak smugly of their work, never to realize that their cutting edges came reasonably close to matching his own advancements -- of several years past.
It was a vivid red g-string.
No, they did not. Not
This armor was the pinnacle, more truly a part of him than any other had been. Superior. indeed, the perfect extension of his already Extremis-perfected self. He caressed Steve, and the Endo-sym caressed him, its flowing metal cradling his body, pulsing around his groin, sending a widely flared shaft up to penetrate past his ring of muscle with a perfectly insistent stretch, angling up inside him to tap that perfect, nerve-sparking spot.
Steve scoffed. "You know I wasn't."
He remembered just in time, just before he misspoke: his wife’s name was Janet, their arrangement was open, and Starla didn’t know any of that about Roger anyway.
One direct hit could have atomized the building and everyone inside. Instead, they'd sent a pair, guided to two points at just enough distance to turn the surrounding meadowside into a heaving pit, demolishing the stone-hewn structure in a fountain of roaring rockfall.
They were given a private chamber to deliberate and then act upon their choice. The centerpiece of the suite was a massive platform covered in layers of rich-looking fabrics, not quite, but resembling closely enough to be called, a bed. Investigating further, an unobtrusive door led to an "outside" courtyard area where a lawn of not-quite green not-quite grass bordered a flat oval of hard-packed not-quite dirt. Several racks of melee weapons lined the perimeter.
Settling onto one of the barstools, he immediately felt the unpleasant dig in two blunt points against his buttbones. The seats and backs of these were made of the same flat, burnished sheet metal as the bar and tabletops. He was beginning to see where the place got its name, and it wasn’t anything to do with the dishes the food was served on. Steve wasn’t one to need to be coddled, but if he was going to bother with furniture, he preferred it more forgiving than hunkering down on a hardpacked forest floor.
Astute enough to know when to defer to the wishes of his customer, the craftsman nodded. "Fortunately, I do have several large, completed pieces unspoken for, from which the two of you can make a selection, should they meet with your approval. Please, follow me."
Steve laughed shakily. "Ah, nothing, really. It's just, I still don't really get why... Why this, today, the whole thing." He gestured, encompassing the room, the floor, the two of them. "The shop, the... why you even asked me to go."
He knew, he truly believed and understood, that it wasn't healthy to hide from changes that had occurred while he'd been in the ice. He’d accepted this future as his lifetime, and even with the passage of a few years now, he was continually working to embrace it.
“Open your eyes and look at me.” He did. Her cheeks were bright, even through the makeup, and the sight of her was like the red-on-black void behind his eyelids brought to animate form.
“...the person receiving the check would be the one getting bent over.”
Steve gulped, shaking, his body in shock with the sudden change of pace, and the praise.
Steve, who had grown up on drugstore thrift and then army PX, came to know scents like colors: sandalwood, sage, eucalyptus, melon, mint, lilac, lavender, and a multitude of others.
Steve nodded crisply. "I see. Well, it's good to know there were never any lives in danger."
“You got yourself a deal, Starla. First class
Her hold released; his balls were grateful. His dick was on a rampage.
-- he was Tony's
"I... ok, thanks, J..."
And indulge, he did, immersed in the world of dark, molten sensual response: the propulsive movement of his muscles and limbs; the heated clutch and bare, thin-liquid slide of Starla’s body enrobing and moving with his; the constant friction dragging along his cock from root to tip, keeping him hot-wired with a humming thread of current.
Tony's chest was feeling all not-arc-reactor-malfunction-y again.
He shouldn't have been surprised when Tony immediately picked up on his shift in mood.
Relaxed and dreamy, it didn't matter if the question made much sense or how he replied. But for Tony, he was all willing, with nothing to refuse.
"Well, never mind then." Tony shook his head, simultaneously reshaping his own countenance to its usual flawless aspect, so it was like he'd literally shaken away the years. Style backed by substance, a clever touch. "Not my fault some people just can't be pleased. It's a good thing you aren't so difficult to satisfy in other ways."
He stood and walked over with measured steps, fingers and thumb scratching his chin as he continued to contemplate. Squatting, he took his eldest's claw between his two hands and tugged. "Up, you big lug, lift up and look at me."
His rictus resolved to the grin of a madman.Covered in spit and slick and sweat and spunk, disgusting and debauched and pridefully puffed up, Roger Stevens was living out his purpose on this planet.
Steve had let things go on like that all the way till just now, when the station had cut to commercial, and he'd had enough of having
The Endo-sym rippled with Tony's shoulders again. "Life presents limitless possibilities. Pays to keep your options open. You're the tactician."
Steve had learned many modern idioms in his few years out of the ice. It had evolved into entertainment, in addition to ongoing mental exercise.
His heart hammered. He sucked in a breath. “Roger. Stevens. With the Maria Stark Foundation. A pleasure to meet you,” he stammered, struggling to regain his composure after riding out the landslide of emotional switchbacks.
He was sincere in every word, but could tell he was still falling flat. His ability to rouse and inspire with stirring words had deserted him in his time of need. The winning smile he attempted felt like a jagged crack in his face. This must be the mirror image of how forced hers had looked to him.
“Your Bond could use some practice, but I assure you, loverboy, the pleasure is equally mine,” she intimated, pure seduction under inky, sweeping lashes. She swayed in to brush their cheeks together, just barely, the dangling jewels of her eardrops tapping the edge of his jaw, and a bolt of heat shivered through him. “You have more of a Captain America quality about you, and he’s always been
“Fine upstanding, all the way,” he confirmed. The look they exchanged was conspiratorial and amused. Roger was a little surprised at how companionable this was, laid-back and completely lacking in any post-coital awkwardness, devoid of all the earlier gamesmanship and tension. Having moved past their contentious meeting, he and Starla seemed
Steve's head snapped up and he dragged in his own air as Tony replaced his mouth with a loose, one-handed hold, stroking Steve's red, straining length slow and light, like he knew it might just kill Steve right now to cut the stimulation completely.
And now he'd lost Steve everything, again, instead.
Tony gasped loudly, gaping his eyes and mouth a into ridiculous saucer-face. "Oh, my dear, how could you forget? I must know!
"I'm really sorry to hear that. And I hope I can try to make you feel better. But first -- DUM-E, you know we love you, right? Tony, me, the other bots, JARVIS? All of us. That's really important."
“Just a minute longer. You’re all ready for me. Just gotta slick up.”
Maybe he was just keyed up with the anticipation -- and some degree of pressure -- for securing the support of this benefactor.
All their talk of service and earning was a power play, and Roger knew how this one worked. It was power that built on itself; not the kind where more for one meant less for the other, but the kind where more for one meant more for both.
At breakfast, Steve's teammates had been discussing their assorted plans to get out and enjoy what was shaping up to be a  lovely spring day. With thanks, he'd declined a couple of invitations to join in, having some paperwork he wanted to catch up on. Now, having completed his self-assigned quota, he’d thought to reward himself by picking out a new book to read.
Tony brought his own hands back to Steve, this time setting them lightly at the base of his neck, index fingers wrapping just above his collar bones, where he could push into the dips. He liked to be able to feel those soft spots as Steve's throat worked, as he sucked and swallowed.
He redoubled his efforts, slurping and tonguing her all up and down, her crotch thrusting fast and frenzied into his face. She was whipping winds, rising in pitch to a storm warning, till the air sucked out and she stalled and flooded slick, groaning deep and guttural, and gushing a hot splash across his face.
He flipped her skirt up and stuffed it under some straps, stripping his dick in punishing strokes and grunting roughly till he brute-forced the second, burning orgasm from his balls, pointing himself at her legs and jizz-striping her silk stockings as she stared, open-mouthed.
Steve, standing with his arms crossed, frowned. Tony's stomach rolled over, and his mind raced.
His eyes had fallen closed; he was antenna-tuned to her proximity, just breathing into the startling, inflammatory touches.
"Promise me!" Steve snarled, jabbing him in the armor's chest.
Shaking his head, Tony gave what seemed to be an oft-repeated reminder. "Still no 'mister' about it,
an itch that lasted for seven years. All right, that thought was uncharitable, but she was continuing to rub him the wrong way. “Begging your pardon, ma’am, but my marriage is plenty spicy. I enjoy flavor, not getting burned. As I said. Happily.” He spoke with finality.
However puzzling Tony's behavior, it did nothing to detract from his elegant figure. Tall, slim, and dynamic, he wore his fitted, eggshell-white shirt tucked into neatly creased and impeccably tailored black slacks, his sleeves folded back over wiry forearms, and collar tantalizingly open at the throat.
What was there to ask? As far as the rest of the team was concerned, Steve and Tony had been taken captive, freed themselves, and made a safe return. He'd write that in a report. At some point. Or had Steve already done so, and been a little too forthright with the details? Completeness vs personal information that concerned Tony's privacy, too -- which would have won out? Tony's hands and jaw were clenched. He tried to sound casual.
"You're dabbling with Extremis again," Steve accused.
, God, gotta, gotta come, fuck, Tony,
But Steve's touch was so warm, his palms and fingers seeming custom-molded to fit Tony's limbs. Tony's conscience wanted him to shrink away, while his skin wanted to divert more nerve-endings to the points of contact, to magnify the surface area, to hoard it in the highest possible concentration. He was proud that he didn't flinch, and he hated himself for the stolen enjoyment. The last thing he deserved was to derive pleasure from this, but the least he owed Steve was to minimize the damage, to avoid heaping him with any further hurt.
A strip-tease, was it? Roger wouldn’t mind that, seeing her unpeel and reveal herself, inch by what he was sure would be breathtaking inch.
spectacularly
“I think I can trust you not to scrimp on the tip.”
like a sulky, sullen child. What the hell had crawled up his bot and died?
Steve shuddered, a heavy groan pouring out of him, and his cock jumped. Tony echoed him at a higher pitch, pressed forward and swallowed Steve deep, lips clamped as tight as any cock-ring around his base, and looked up for the first time in... three quarters of an hour?
"No! No, Tony, I did, that's not it at all." God, Steve was making such a mess of this, making Tony feel bad no matter what he said. He wanted to shrink inside himself, but kept trying to dig himself out. His own troubles didn't matter, as long as he left Tony knowing that nothing he'd done had upset Steve or made him feel bad. "I just wondered. It seemed very… spontaneous, that's all, but there's nothing wrong with that, either."
"'kay, but there's no music," he mumbled, his lips to Tony's hair.
Impact. Blank. Blank. Whiteout.
Tony barely held his tongue, drilling Steve's back with a laser-eye he was amazed wasn't burning right through him, because holy fuck,
Exasperated, Tony ran his other hand through work-disheveled hair and queried, "J, you got any idea what this is all about with DUM-E?"
Steve already had his pants on, so Tony didn't have to take a gander at the dick that'd been inside him, or Steve's ass, as Steve gathered the bedding and tucked the bundle under his arm. Must've thought of the same thing Tony had.
With evident pride and deep knowledge of his craft, he briefly described the workmanship and materials of each, including historical anecdotes about the origins of some of the patterns. He surprised Steve by inviting them to be hands-on, to touch and explore the textures, which varied far more than Steve would have realized, from flat, stiff, almost burnished surfaces, to sinfully soft and thick.
"Steve. Sweetheart. You've been so gooood," Tony crooned, his voice sultry with crushed-gemstone gravel.
She traced the blue veins at his bared inner wrist, setting him off in a cascade of fine shivers.
Steve believed firmly in always holding onto hope, but this refusal was one he shouldn’t have to repeat. He worked his jaw in a circle and rolled his shoulders back, feeling something crawling between them, and the phantom sensation of being watched. Time was counting down, and he needed to extricate himself from her brazen pursuits before Mrs. DeWard could arrive to find him in this compromising position.
Her palm was more upward-facing than typical for a handshake, and he fumbled in taking hold, clumsy with not being quite sure how to line up their grips. She solved it for him, clasping his fingers in her long, elegant ones and leaving him flummoxed when she unexpectedly lifted his hand and dragged her lips over its back. It was an urbane gesture made thoroughly indecent, an open-mouthed kiss that left a ring of damp over his knuckles.
A coy curve of her lips colored the words in dangerous shades as she proffered a hand. “I feel like I ought to be offended, but honestly, it’s surprisingly refreshing. You’re a breath of fresh air, as well as a tall drink of… soda water.”
And after he'd said his piece and they'd made theirs, Tony had told him the meaning hidden in "we need to talk," and how he'd crumpled at the "please" no matter what, and how Steve had him for the taking, but he'd thought sure he was leaving, and weren't they a couple of fools, he’d said with a painful laugh, both afraid what the other had wanted was less a commitment, and thank God for one of them having the balls to communicate.
“Don’t sell yourself short. Do me right, and we could be talking seven, if you’d get out that fat cock and earn that fat check.”
of metal on porcelain and the decorous levels of conversation from the few occupied tables blended into an omnidirectional hum, like an indistinct jumble of radio chatter across the frequencies.
His fondness for Tony spoke with no language lessons needed.
Stay quiet. Soak in Steve's attention like a sweet, slow-acting poison, and leave it till later for his future self to drag himself away in the aftermath, to sweat and shiver, agonize and purge. Expunge.
Now he had the natural backstop at the wide part of his knuckles as a base for shorter, sharper jabs, and he shuffled to the left to come at her from an angle, fucking his cock against her hip in counterpoint, and getting better leverage for all of it. He scooped up her insides with his hand, putting his thumb up over her tailbone like her asshole was a grip to lift her by, while his dick rubbed and rasped over crumpled up skirt satin that his drippings were spot-dying darker.
"How do you do it, always making things so simple and clear? You march in and everything automatically forms up and falls into place, like chaos wants to reverse its polarity to placate you with order. Too bad I can't build that right into a logic circuit! And if I could, it still wouldn't be as magnetic as you."
God dammit, He was no good at this.
“--even if I’m not the most traditional kind of girl.”
Grabbing himself with his right hand up high on the shaft, he slapped his cockhead down right over her tailbone, and dragged down into her cleft. A droplet of precome spilled from his slit in a liquid burst, smearing thickly between them, distinct even above the lighter wetness of the lube. He guided himself to line up with her hole, and pushed, feeling the loosened rim give softly under his bluntness, then stretch open around the head of his cock, till he breached, falling in and in and in like being swallowed by a sinkhole. He bottomed out in one endless, wet, sweet glide. holding there with his groin tight to her ass, run through by an uncontrollable pins-and-needles shudder.
He cried out, panting. "...
Half out of his mind, arching against the back of the couch with his chest thrown forward, Steve writhed under the lash.
wish I could be at your service,” she said, low and husky, her lips still vibrating against the back of his hand, and her breath stirring up dust devils of helpless, shameful arousal whirling and eddying under his skin.
The newcomer was no middle-aged matron. Tall, lean, and angular, this woman strode in like a two-legged grudge on the prowl, all pugnacious strut, a parabolic antenna for the eyes.
DUM-E hadn't moved since Tony's request, but now he raised his head and zeroed in on Steve with an excited series of beeps. (Tony would be jealous, but he got excited and his head went right up for Steve, too.) The bot rolled forward a few inches and then stopped abruptly, his claw drooping partway back down.
He gave his pent-up dick a few long rubs, a shot of friction he could just about taste, rippling down and getting his hips warm and loose and his pants tighter than ever. His eyes stayed locked on target, ten feet away.
He bared his canines. He could hardly wait to be her whore.
“Straight shooter, never pulls his punches, hottest, hardest flagpole in the land?” he growled. He could feel her breathing quicken, the rhythmic press of her chest against his forearm where their linked hands were confined within the close space of their bodies. It rushed to his head, revved up his blood, her willingness to give over to his lead. Before he pulled back, he couldn’t resist a nibble at her bedizened earlobe, the cushiony bit of flesh carrying the bite of tiny teeth in its stone-encrusted gold.
God, there was something so filthy and sleazy about doing anal this way with a woman, having the kind of sex he would usually have with another man.
“Here, hold this,” he ordered rhetorically, stuffing the back hem of the skirt under the upper straps of the garter belt. It distorted the fancy-ass design, but kept Starla’s fancier-actual-ass on display.
"So, how about it, handsome, you wanna join me tomorrow for some more daytime drama?"
He rocked them together, breathing into the short hair behind Steve's ear, driving them toward the peak. When he felt Steve's body stutter and clench, he nudged his own Extremis; moments later, Steve gave a hoarse shout, spurting over his hand. He himself didn't even need to ejaculate, just let Extremis trip his pleasure centers into the white-hot override of orgasm, let himself cling and tremble and moan.
No one, and both. The two of them were solutions to the same system of equations, Tony had told him, and Steve had remembered. Sometimes he saw how they were math, especially in battle, multiplied by one another, exponential. Then at times their science was softer, fuzzy logic nestled into more pliant shapes, and still raising each other to higher powers.
The Oklahoma Land Rush of 1889 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Rush_of_1889) is a reasonably major event in US History. When I was thinking about Steve's response to the pickup line about a claim being staked on him, the Land Rush is what came right to my mind. In looking it up, I found that it did indeed involve what I thought I remembered, even though I couldn't have given a great amount of detail the exact year.
And who was Steve to arugula with that?
Tony drew in a quick breath, and threw up his hands. "Ok, I read you, Cap. Orders received. Mission abort."
Steve nodded as decisively as he could, spoke with all the assurance he could muster, to rally them both.
"Oh, you want to practice that one throw, one hit, one target idea, is that it?" Steve asked.
." The rumble of it had almost started to get Steve going, but then Tony had subsided back into silence, and Steve was just supposed to sit there, and... nada, nothing.
always
Her smile turned brittle and her eyes went remote. Looked like the gamble hadn’t paid off. He scrambled for one more last-ditch effort. “...and I know you aren’t proud of who you were in those days, but you followed your dreams, and you’ve grown up to become a strong, compassionate woman, putting your effort and resources into helping others.”
Did that mean Steve had considered quitting the Avengers? Tony would never have let that happen. He'd quit, himself, before he let Cap leave the team over this. Over anything.
His stomach plummeted. Dismay and confusion pulled him crossways like windshear. He was hot and cold and god-let-me-sink-into-the-ground mortified.
It might anyway. But Steve -- hadn't broken, hadn't moved anything but his head and hands, hadn't thrust, hadn't
Steve frowned. "Who done what?"
It seemed like the room had hit a hundred percent humidity. Everything felt damp: the sweat trickling down his back, his spit-soaked cock and balls and the fabric beneath him, even the strands of Tony's hair under his hand.
He was going to have this once and only once, and he'd never get to feel Steve bare, or be flooded with his come.
"--I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you feel, uh, uncomfortable, or embarrassed about anything."
Anger and hurt flared and extinguished in Steve's eyes.
Shower, work, sleep, and food. And not thinking about Steve. Those got Tony through the next two days. When Clint called to ask if he had a few minutes, he walked into the common room, and almost walked right back out again when he found not just Clint, but Steve, waiting there. Team business, though... he squared his shoulders and made himself stay.
She went right past acerbic and straight to acid bath. “I meant by getting those pants off, finally.”
He was just putting away his phone when his hackles went up.
"Ok, blow me now," their patron requested, slightly breathless. Tony could see his hips starting to twitch restlessly, and from the shifting of his shoulders, he was probably wringing his hands behind his back.
Orrr, maybe not, if the indignant-sounding burst of chatter expelled by DUM-E was any indication.
Steve poked him in the ribs, just for being so full of shit. He loved him for it. "Fuck you, Stark, I know where it's good. And that's what the episode recaps in the TV Guide are for."
He had it in him, but not before hers.
"Oh, don't be like this, baby. Come here." He wrapped an arm around Steve's waist, fingers flirting with his fly, and the other around his neck, cradling it in the crook of his elbow.
Tony held up a pre-emptive hand. "
He wrapped Tony up tighter and nudged a thigh between his knees, getting in one last tease, low and gruff.
It felt matched with the light shivers of Tony in his arms as they mutually explored from shoulders to waists, hands tracing sleekness and curves through shirt cotton.
Tony raised his hand across his body to lay it atop the claw.
The darkness amplified all of his other senses, even seeming to heighten the resolution of the haptic data flowing in. The totality enmeshed him in a tapestry of sensation, embroidered in vivid threads of the armor's intense vibrations cupped around his cock, the zinging jolts through his prostate that spiderwebbed up and down his limbs, and Steve's swollen shaft, furiously straining in his hand.
After a while, Tony let out a long sigh, his features relaxing and smoothing out. He lifted his hips to shove his soiled pants down, rolling his torso up with an appealing flex of his abs to push them off his legs. Flopping back down again, he balled up the pants and used them to give his crotch a wipedown before tossing them away. Only then did he turn his eyes to Steve, color high in his cheeks, beckoning with a loose wrist before he let the hand clap onto his chest, theatrical as always.
Tony took the opportunity to give himself a cursory wipe-down with some conveniently provided alien towelettes, stuffing those into a pocket after re-dressing his lower half and retrieving his ruined shirt.
She was all game, pushing right back, but the give and spread of her cheeks was hampered by infuriating layers of cloth that blocked him from where he wanted to be, deeply cradled within her cleft.
, to letting Steve in and letting him stay, when to his foundation, he'd known better...
Tony gave it a beat, and chimed in again. "Maybe I was watching that."
Steve's hips twitched, the front of his uniform swelling into Tony's hand. He rubbed the heel of it down harshly, and cackled. "Oh, does that still do it for you? I never said any of it was "good," but your old-man cock still seems to have taken it as praise."
Clint massaged his temples. "Ok, look, we were all sick of you two circling around each other, you know, so we called up the Guardians and asked if they had any galactic pals who could arrange some kind of orgy, or fertility ritual, or sex-something-or-other... Turns out, some friends of theirs run this exotic-fantasy fulfillment service, so we..." He sighed gustily. "It was supposed to get you to admit your feelings and whisk you away for a great weekend fuck-cation in the alien honeymoon suite. That's all."
Now he and Steve were split asunder where they should have been joined in love and joy. The objection had been heard. The peace had not been held.
After a short zip in one of Tony's prized roadsters, windows down to catch the breeze, they pulled up in front of an older but well-kept commercial-industrial row. Tony bounded inside with Steve trailing in his wake. Upon entry, the lobby looked more like an exclusive boutique, with ornate and tasteful lighting casting a glow over fine furniture and floor coverings, the whole room rich with deep reds and warm earth tones.
He was a pressure chamber, steam mounting fuller and higher, boiling to a head, and… He blew, clamping down around her, crying out and pulsing and spurting, shuddering through the aftershocks till he felt peeled inside-out by the force of his orgasm.
His hand on Tony's hip snaked down to fist Tony's cock, corkscrewing and thumbing over the head, short and tight and too dry, with just enough precome to make it rub instead of glide. And then he broke rhythm, driving into Tony with hard, pounding jabs. Tony bowed against him and came with a choked-off keen, an acrid taste in his throat, and little of any pleasure, his release thin and sharp and stinging like a burr twisting down his spine.
"You weren't watching it," Steve said mildly.
"Out with it, Avenger," Steve ordered. Civvies or no, and no matter who was acting Chairperson, that was the voice of their Captain.
he didn't need to be shielded, but anything coming at him, Steve still wanted to hit it first, hit it harder, hit it again, till it never got back up.
"But it won't be you."
Behind him. She skated knuckles down the back of his shoulder, into the twitchy muscles at the base of his spine, and grabbed a generous portion of the glutes he’d been flaunting.
"Mm, thanks for coming down, babe," Tony told him, always heartened by his boyfriend's presence, but concern for DUM-E's well-being still hovering at the forefront of his mind like a warning in the Iron Man HUD.
Clint looked as horrified as Tony felt, and clearly hadn't thought of that potential repercussion, either. "That's... that's good, Cap. Steve. Good to hear."
"--do anything wrong, Tony. I promise, you didn't."
Steve glared back his reply, his eyes boring and cauterizing holes.
He heaved a sigh and pivoted back around, pasted on a smile, and forced himself to meet Steve's eyes for
; in this state, breathing was about the only thing Steve would continue to do without explicit instruction.
“You gonna thank me for making your job easier?” That tone of voice promised
Tony nodded. "He is. You like it like this, or want him to suck?"
“--little
"He has indicated that he is experiencing... I believe you might term it 'feelings of inadequacy.'"
The bar ran the full length of the wall, and Steve had the only occupied seat. She could take her pick with no need to acknowledge or pay him any mind, and none for him to make stilted small talk. Still, with every step, the more obvious it became that she was homing in on him like north to a compass needle.
It was Tony's turn to look self-conscious, shrugging and shoving a hand through his hair, mussing it into further (
around. If you hadn't insisted on making a pageant of it... this wasn't about
Her grip on his hand tightened almost painfully, and her features pinched, showing fine lines at the corners of her eyes and mouth. Unconscious reactions, he was nearly certain. He was hitting home with something. He rubbed what he could reach of her hand with his thumb, and the comforting gesture felt more natural than he expected.
Tony was one of the most assured and confident people Steve knew. Sometimes it seemed like this whole future was one gigantic machine Tony had designed and built himself, and he knew how to operate it better than anyone. Which, in many ways, Steve supposed, wasn't so far from the truth.
Another brittle silence hung between them, grey and dull as the flecks that littered their hair and drifted loose, as the pallor that blanched the planes and grooves of their faces. Massive and dense as their grief, with nothing left to fuel its outlet, that mounded within and between them like psychic slag heaps.
This one seemed equal parts predator and self-parody, but the fact was, she’d advanced on him like an occupying army, dripping with wealth, and self-assured like she owned everything around her, including him. Steve didn’t like feeling owned.
On this particular occasion, he quashed that impulse, and let it fall.
Tony made contented sounds that echoed the way Steve felt himself; with the carpet still cradling his bare feet, he was grounded, and at the same time, floating somewhere between the sky and the earth. In their embrace, he was safe and content and secure.
Tony hunkered down further, scooting around to sit cross-legged, and looking DUM-E straight in the "eye."
Steve turned toward Tony, leaving the hand on DUM-E's strut solidly in place, and motioning Tony the last few steps over with the other, wrapping it around his waist and pulling him in close. Tony gladly closed the distance between them, pressing in tight to Steve's side. The tugging feeling in his chest became a gentler and warmer one, one that rose up and formed itself into words he hadn't known he contained, and carried them from his heart to his mouth.
“Can it wait?”
"Sure, you want to pinky swear? Fine with me, but you just said it yourself, I'll only break it as soon as it's convenient."
The phone buzzed lightly against his hand with Tony’s surprisingly quick reply. Steve hadn’t been sure he’d even see the message, much less respond.
. “Just remember. It’s for
Sightless, he indulged in the familiar body; the rich scents of oils and musk exuding from the brazier of heated hair and skin; the textures of fabric and hard flesh; and Steve's tortured, pleasured sounds, the most magnificent symphony to conduct.
This was obligation. It was penance. But still, Tony grew feverish with the need to be battered fast and merciless, to bottle back his screams till they burned his throat as surely as if he'd shouted himself hoarse. He was that far gone for Steve Rogers, or just that hopelessly perverse, to let his mind transform coercion into his own cheap, sordid fantasy.
Captain
...to the proposal, to the first date, to
It was all part of the appeal, though, Tony's humor, and his leading-man looks, of course, and his... well, Tony was right here, solid and familiar along his side, and it didn't take being this close, anyway, for Steve to notice how he always smelled really nice, too. Like, today, a cool, woodsy cologne mixing with the tang of something subtly metallic from all his machines, but Steve didn't feel right saying any of that out loud.
"C'mere, hot stuff, I believe I've earned the right to post-coital full-body contact."
"I mean it, I--"
The good news on that front is that the opening chapter is entirely written, and the closing chapter is outlined and should be completed within (hopefully) another week or so. When that last chapter is finished, I am going to post the fic in its entirety, still gifted to you. Feel free to enjoy the fic now as posted, or to skip this version if you would prefer to wait and read it as fully envisioned, without being spoiled by reading the middle chapters first.
Tony was. Right there to meet him, Steve's bare toes curling back down into the luxuriant warmth of the thick carpet, and the rest of him curling in and wrapping his arms around the luxuriant warmth of Tony's solid frame, filling a wide open space he'd never known was so empty.
Only their nearness made her secret reactions unhidden, the almost silent hitch of breath and lighting fine tremor drawn out by the touch of his lips, the way it set her small hairs to rise.
He gathered the skirt into bunches at the sides and hitched it up; it fell back over his arms as he stuck his hands beneath, smoothing his way up silk-covered thighs to the tops of her stockings. He skimmed his fingers under the bands, slipping them around toward the sensitive skin at the insides, and she shifted in place, trembling minutely and setting loose an unintelligible low sound that rose to a jump and gasp when he pulled at the clipped-on garter straps, giving them a snap.
supervillain, god forbid," Tony joked, but there was Iron Man in his voice.
Tony chortled, admiring the artfulness of his own temporary laugh-lines. "I think you make more a mockery of yourself." He pumped Steve's dick in two tight, short strokes, watched his jaw clench and felt a tremor roll through him. "But I do want you to enjoy this, so if you really feel so strongly about it... How about now?"
Forget the serum. That was Steve's real superpower. Steve made people feel like they mattered.
"Babies," Steve repeated, incredulous. What a wiseguy. "Who gives a rat's ass. I had better things to think about. Like getting my
Steve flicked his eyes up, meeting Tony's obliquely, studying the soft tilt of his head, the mussed waves of his hair.
“Lemme fix that.” He was moving before he finished speaking, getting a hand between her cheeks to check, and she moaned at the contact, and
The beings from the ship had brought Steve and Tony their terms.
"The wrinkles on your skin haven't changed the wrinkles on your brain, the convolutions that make you who you are and have always been. So determined, Steve. So persistent, so resolute." The hinge of his elbow started to close, but not enough to cut off Steve's air or even his speech. Not yet. "So god-damned, motherfucking
Steve was right, though, of course he was. Steve was the one who'd wanted a church wedding, but Tony was the one who had said yes. To everything. The proposal. The first date. Said yes to
, kind of like sticking his hand in a bowl of tepid water -- inoffensive but unremarkable, and not particularly arousing...)
Here as every part of her he’d seen, she was lean and spare, smoothly fleshed without a scrap of extra, and he already couldn’t get enough. He swore some more and stopped breathing and ran his hands greedily over all that harnessed-in skin, circling and dimpling it with his thumbs.
Steve's eyes went wide. "But we fought when they nabbed us, we hurt people--"
was... their whole world had gone dark-mirror, jagged, shatter-crazed.
Movement from the direction of the door caught his attention; maybe this was his lunch companion arriving. He’d been attuned for it the whole time, but the two-o’clock reservation was past even typical “late lunch” hours, and since he’d been at the bar, only one other small group had come in and been seated. This was a single individual, so possibly… No.
Tossing her small purse to the couch, Starla kicked off her shoes and shimmied out of her jacket with a hum and an exaggerated stretch and twine of very nicely toned arms above her head, then chucked the garment onto the cushions as well.
while he hugged Steve's cock down his throat...
He could tell Tony saw right through; he’d patted Steve’s damp, bare shoulder with a stingy palm, the same creaky lift to his elbow and wrist as his lips, weak, like he’d been watered down when he’d needed to be oiled. Steve could feel the strain where he’d seen Tony’s unsullied smile, mark the stiffness where he’d known his unstinting touch.
Under the cloth, he felt a small, hard lump resting along the divot of her solar plexus. He outlined it with his thumb, finding the shape of the secret she wore against her skin, and felt her quake. Through a fold of fabric, he curled his hand into a fist around it, rubbing at the token as he rammed into her. Right now, he owned her, secrets and all.
Tony watched their guest settle in, listening to the shift in Steve's breathing as one access to his airway was partially restricted. "Seal your lips," he directed. He had to be responsible for
a lot harder than Steve's cowl, or his goddamn thick skull.
"Close, if you want to."
"By all means. Make him useful. But no hands. I'll move him, if it's necessary."
Sweat-drenched till the hellfire had boiled them down to salt-crusted skins, they'd dug through the rubble for hours, toiling and lifting, heaving stone and sifting through the grisly reduction, doggedly running to ground every last sign and spark of life that technology and supranatural senses could glean. It was putrid, soul-killing labor, an excavation that ground down skin, armor, and spirit.
had time for personal pleasures. Such as rubbing Steve's nose in the matters of Tony's diversion and profit that Steve couldn't touch.
And they'd hugged before kissing, because although this was, mmmm, oh, yes, about sex, that wasn’t by far the only thing, and foremost, right then, had been reassurance and care, in murmuring voices and the woodsy smell of Tony's hair, the weave of his dress shirt, day-long-wrinkled and warmed, and his belt buckle digging a hole in Steve's hip, sundry tokens of home.
"So... I guess I dropped the soap."
“But I understand. Perception is everything, isn’t it, darling? I see that I should at least introduce myself to the man who has spurned my advances so definitively. To tell you the truth, I’m a little shocked you haven’t recognized me. I do have something of a reputation, even a degree of, shall we say, infamy, in some circles.”
No, he couldn't.
"Yes, and so are you, old man. Your point being?"
matter, is that you always do your best."
DUM-E beeped a happy-sounding reply, and with a whoosh of hydraulics, extended his strut at a sharp downward angle, back end raising high, so he could fold his head down and in against the shield.
Tony went back to the fridge, this time for shit that rightfully belonged in it. A few minutes later, snacked and hydrated, he chalked up a mark on the "I Do So Remember to Self-Care, Sometimes" board, brought up the Pink Floyd trance remix playlist at low volume via JARVIS, and settled himself at the main workstation, immersing in a set of virtual schematics. Nothing too heavy, but he was pretty sure he could reorient that circuit board here, which would shorten the distance for the wire leads there, which would allow for an additional layer of shielding in the extra eighth-inch of margin gained...
“I suppose we could always use the napkins,” she said, tipping her head toward the dining table, where large cloth squares were folded into tall triangles over the plates. She gave him a wink. “...but let’s not be uncouth.”
Steve, I definitely assume to know his US history.  I, on the other hand, am a terrible student of history. So if this is a reference that I could pull from my own memory, then I thought it fair to consider that Steve's educated and very intelligent conversation partner would also be able to recognize what he was talking about and banter back with him about it.
The master key to Steve was to give him a war. Making it one he couldn't win was diabolical. Setting him against himself was transcendent.
These insinuations were quickly becoming downright offensive. Even if he were available and interested, messing around with the likes of her seemed like a good way to
?" Tony sneered, gesturing with the nearly empty martini glass, then tossing back the last swallow and dashing the glass on the floor in a fountain of shards. The light caught the crystal in a momentary rainbow mosaic. "There,
Steve panted and swallowed back his own rising arousal, tasting it in the air. He wrestled down his urges; he could hold it, hold back, till... the end of the episode, the turn of the hour. Or whenever Tony said; really, this wasn't his show, at all, anymore. It was Tony's show, now, and Tony would tell him when they were done.
The man unslung his sarong and tossed the fabric over his shoulder, revealing a short, girthy cock that stood ready. He guided it into Steve's mouth, then tucked his hands out of the way behind his back. Tony could tell from the proportions that it was a comfortable fit, no strain at all to have his waxed-smooth groin nudged right up to Steve's nose. This one wouldn't make Steve work, but an easy job well done was as important as a demanding one. Not to mention, both the right and the ability were his alone, when it came to devising the challenges that could truly push Steve's limits
"Fuuuuuck," Clint muttered. "Yeah, that's what I was afraid of."
From Mr. No-Such-Thing-As-Bedtime, that was a near-literal door-slam in the face.
Ahh. There was not a single thing for Roger to find unflattering about that. Who could get anything but an ego boost out of being directly compared to Cap?
"Yeah, please do that, buddy. Thanks."
"Roger, fuuuuuck,” Starla moaned, shoving back as if he had any more length to give her. “You’re in me so deep I feel like I swallowed you.”
The urgency was building for him, too, his dick throbbing and his balls tight, that dizzying euphoric flush lighting him all over again. Both their breaths were coming more and more ragged.
He let up the pressure on Steve's throat; even as an elder, Steve was so vigorous that Tony had almost forgotten he was no longer enhanced, and probably couldn't hold his breath now the way he had before.
He had to find a way to salvage this.
He caught himself watching her again, as she took out a tube of lipstick and a sliver of mirror, dabbing on a touch-up. She replaced those in her purse, then the purse in her inner pocket.
“You should at least drink some water. I hear you missed lunch.”
"And I will dispense with the formalities when you do,
"Yeah, DUM-E, you don't need an extra arm. Extra arms are how we get supervillains." Tony was pretty sure he'd heard that somewhere before, not quite sure where, but it sounded about right.
“Well hellooo, aren’t you a real U.S.D.A. Prime cut? Tell me, beefcake, do you have a preferred pickup line, or can we just consider my claim to be staked?”
"So it's... all of this, this is all something you
He'd hurtle into the sky to do his part in saving the world or the city or someone's kitten and then crawl off to his lone wolf's den to lick his wounds and vomit up his guts and...
The technology was a wonder, but pressing the tiny number keys several times to get to each letter drove him mad. So he tended to use the feature minimally, and keep his messages well under the short character limit. Checking in on Tony was worth the effort, though. It gave him something soft to think about that made him smile to himself, and melted down the rest of his unease in a way timed breathing couldn’t touch.
The interaction before him was like seeing the Tony he'd already come to know, but in an aspect he'd never met before. Like turning the page when he knew exactly what had to happen next in the story, but not how it had been written.
More petty squabbles, more grandiose schemes.
He took a deep, shaky breath, and then another, pulling out and pressing back in, slowly. Such an easy, easy slide, but perfectly close and snug, the sharp, bright pleasure centered in his cock, and buzzing and tingling outward to every extremity.
He stepped into his briefs and adjusted himself as she worked her tucked-up skirt free of the garter belt and dropped it down. She wriggled her hips to shake it out, and pressed her hands down the front, making a moue at its bedraggled state.
He punctuated the statement by taking up a renewed grip on Steve's erection, running his hand down till the heel pressed deep into the root, and jerking in long, forceful pulls, with his fingertips tucked to run directly along the thick vein.
Every fixture and surface was white, transparent, or silvered; every edge and corner sharp enough to cut.
Steve wasn't the only one who liked to kick at molehills and bicker over minutiae. They needed some of those to make up for the mountains.
Around his other side. One fingernail trailing across his palm in a spiking tickle that jumped to his throat, his stomach, his cock, in lightspeed streaks, making him jitter and hiss.
En route, they’d heard the booms and rounded the bend to destruction. Tony had skidded them to a screeching, fishtailing halt, and been knee-deep in rubble, scrabbling with bloodied fingers, before he’d realized that the sharper sound hitting his ears through the screaming of his own voice was Steve’s, shouting at him to call the armor.
“Earning the bucks… superstud…” She upped the stakes. “Make it… double if you… come again… so I can see…”
But for the built-in shelves lining the walls, the spacious library of Avengers Mansion had been cleared of furniture from corner to corner.
, then maybe it wasn't so wrong of him if he found it more riveting to watch Tony, instead.
…” He’d been going to say
It was his hands, not his head, working under there in the tropical damp, but his nostrils flared, his breath hanging dense in his chest anyway, all within the radius of their sweltry local weather system.
~~~~~~
Steve wasn't sure about that inspiring order thing; life often felt pretty hectic and disarrayed to him, but he was glad if he could be of help to Tony, even if it was something he did without knowing how
"Carpet... Yes, you're exactly right!" Tony freeze-framed his pointing finger before breaking the pose, trotting over to a confused Steve and slinging an arm around his neck. The friendly weight rested pleasing and light, reminding him to relax and lower his shoulders, releasing the unconscious tension he knew often held them scrunched halfway up to his ears.
But he was folding back down again, and Steve let his shoulder go to ruffle his right hand through Tony's fine, silky hair. It was dark and lustrous (ought to be, for Tony's assiduous regimen of care products), but still, the rounds of treatments had left it thinner than it had once been.
Thumbs to Tony's hip bones, Steve eased him through it, caught his fizzing, sparking aftershocks, and let his softening cock slide free, little left for the rushing water to wash away. Second-hand sated, he leaned his head to rest in the crease of Tony’s groin, stroked down the back of one leg, and felt the lingering quivers of his knees.
Tony just wriggled against him, pressed all down his front, lithe and vital and provocative. "Oh, will you now? Might have to take you up on that, soldier. Not gonna let you sweep that one under the rug!"
Tony's grip on Steve's thighs tightened, the tendons on back of his hand cording up under Steve's hold. His other hand slid down to massage short, hard caresses around Steve's kneecap, then further, thumbing circles into the tough meat of his calf muscle. He mouthed once around the thickness of Steve's cock, his lips making a soft smacking sound in the wet.
"I'm sorry, Tony. It's us or... countless lives at stake. You know we have to."
, he was so fucked.
Captivating as this was, however, Steve was also beginning to feel uncomfortably out of place and intrusive, with nothing to do but stand across the room, effectively eavesdropping. Fortunately, Tony broke the moment just then to beckon Steve over, laying a reassuring hand in middle of his back and making introductions.
"Goddammit, Tony, what the fuck is this supposed to be all about?"
"And I thought maybe you could, too," he finished tiredly.
"You are sure? I can design just for you, work in symbols to represent the household?" Mr. Bassat winked. "Themes for your 'Avengers'? The lovely 'Wasp' and steadfast 'Captain America'?"
"Now, I've got a city to run, nearly a million estimable citizens whose health and beauty need seeing to, so no more time to squander on personal pleasures." The first part was the truth; the second a lie. He
The not-quite sun shone not-quite yellow. Everything felt not-quite real.
She looked like she was ready to go; but for his own shoes, tie, and jacket, the work of a minute or two, they both had themselves reassembled.
"You're a man who knows quality," Tony agreed, feeling loose and magnanimous. He derived a self-affirming satisfaction from having something proven desirable that he could provide. "Glad he could be of service." With two fingers, he flicked out a caricature of a salute to close the exchange.
Steve knew Tony had only made the jibe to get a rise out of him, but some things were a matter of principle.
to be seen." Tony had rolled his eyes and batted aside the feeble protest with a leer and a lazy drawl. "Steve and I see each other every day. As much of each other as possible. That goes double --  make that squared -- for today,” he’d smirked, jostling Rhodey with a playful nudge to the shoulder, while Steve shrugged with a smug little grin, the color high in his cheeks.
He ducked back to Steve's dick without further ado, replacing hand with mouth once more, crawling his fingers up Steve's thighs to sit in the creases of his hips, and starting up a sensual massage with the flat of his tongue.
This had been a comfortable interlude, but a long one, and he was starting to feel restless.
Steve's eyes were squeezed closed, and his mouth open, working on emptiness. No, no, this would not do.
, not being told to sit still and not do anything about it while you bore my dick to death."
He made no protest to Steve withdrawing once more to the dark behind his eyelids. Instead, he reabsorbed the extension creating the mirror screen, blanked his camera feeds and internal visuals, and let the Endo-sym roll a visor across his own eyes, snug over the bridge of his nose. They'd both seen everything they needed to for today.
"Thank you, sir."
So eloquent, god, her mouth was vulgar and gorgeous. “Close, yeah, but--”
“Making up for past mistakes -- I really admire that in a person. You’re doing a good thing, here, Ms. DeWard. Funding the hospital renovations will touch so many people’s lives, all because you care enough to help bring it about.”
Their gazes connected, but neither smiled.
He took a hesitant step forward, hearing himself rambling so terribly and foolishly, his face hot and his body buzzing warm and cold in quick sparks and jitters, and he needed a damper, a ground, something to still him the way his hand against the edge could quiet the ringing of his shield.
The fondness in her expression sent a silvery little pang through his chest, suspending him in an odd moment of anticipation. She leaned in and brushed her lips at the corner of his mouth, barely a touch, and his heart contracted again. Under all the pungency, she still smelled sweet.
Steve found himself pushing for more, faster. Planting his feet in the thick carpet, he let his flexing thighs propel the thrust of his hips, making his body a pistoning machine. He cradled Tony's face, pulling him down and burying Tony's nose and forehead into the furrows of his stomach every time Steve's cock buried itself in the steamy pocket of Tony's throat. Every time Steve let off, Tony grabbed for air in dirty gasps, his clumped lashes springing open, and his eyes wide and hungry.
Viewed from above and behind, down the front; viewed on the nanoplate looking-glass; viewed through the Iron Sight -- what a picture they made. What a gallery of art they could become together, thanks to Extremis, the ultimate tool to transform flesh to canvas.
Catlike and slinky, she moseyed over. He could almost see the tail up behind her, twitching at the tip. She reeled him in by the tie, one-handed, then worked the knot a few inches down his neck, and undid his top two buttons, the oval edges of her nails tapping dangerously at his throat. He felt hypersensitized, flushed and broken out in a light sweat, hot under the literal collar.
"Sir, as you requested, I have conferred with DUM-E."
And Tony was right, the soft, dense fibers felt extravagant under his bare feet and between his toes, and without thinking about it, he wiggled them down further in, feeling his smile stretch, too.
Tony frowned, swiveling his chair back and forth a few degrees in each direction while listening to JARVIS report.
With a sauntering step, he walked to the bar to mix himself a drink, grabbing a bottle of water -- his own label -- while he was there. "Oh, dear me, How could you let me forget. Before you go..." He deactivated the rest of the modifications emulating Steve's serum-augmented musculature, and watched him deflate.
Roger was more a finish-last kind of nice guy, but he didn’t bother feeling conflicted. If she was that gung-ho for him to go first, who the fuck was he to deny? His dick was white hot iron and he plastered himself over her, hammered into her hard, chasing down his release with pounding thrusts, to the sounds of her frenetic urgings.
Tony did call him many things, with a sparkle, smirk, wink, or a sigh, but was always willing to indulge, and in so many words to equal the one, it all added up to love.
Truth be told, Steve had firmed up more from the past twelve seconds of Tony's unabashed sex talk and their banter than from the previous twelve minutes of Tony drooling on his balls without actually bothering to blow him. Just hearing it, including Tony's uncannily accurate reproduction of his own enthusiastic, uh, encouragements, had his face feeling hotter and redder than the non-action had done for his dick.
. That was his girl. Crude as ever, a real crass act.
Wouldn’t want to let a lady feel like she wasn’t wanted. He’d let her set her stage, and she was a fuckin’ showstopper. Looked like time she took a volunteer from this audience of one.
"That you trying to pull the rug out from under me, 's'that what you're doing?" Tony asked, and smoothed down the offended area with a flat-palmed stroke.
anymore," Steve spat, low, blunt, and brutal, like there was anything left for force to accomplish. He hadn't even raised his voice. Steve was often many kinds of loud, but that had nothing to do with what made him dangerous.
