Flushed and panting, Steve's eyes narrowed at the plastic disc clutched in his hand as Tony turned in his arms to see Clint about ten metres up the beach, nearly doubled-over with laughter.
‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm fine,‚Äù Steve said as he slid his arms around Tony‚Äôs waist, giving him a brief but tight hug.¬† He‚Äôd have to ask what was bothering Tony later.¬† ‚ÄúPeter and I have been looking forward to making our dinner.‚Äù
"Steve," he said as he looked into the concerned blue eyes of his husband. "I need‚ÄîI need to get to the lab‚Äî"
Nebula gave another nod and stepped back, throwing a quick glance at her sister. "We should go," she said. "Take the ship and get off this planet. Back to your home."
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not in love with Bucky, Tony,‚Äù Steve says firmly.¬† ‚ÄúI never have been.¬† He was my best friend as a kid.¬† Saved my life more times than I can count, and he doesn‚Äôt deserve what HYDRA‚Äôs done to him.¬† But I‚Äôm not in love with him.¬† I‚Äôm in love with you.¬† You and Peter, you're my family.‚Äù
Steve's jaw twitched as he nodded, patting Tony's knee under the table. "Very well, Your Highness. And thank you again for your wonderful hospitality."
With a nod, Tony downed the rest of the coffee in his mug and grabbed his glasses.¬† It was already a few minutes after six, and while Peter probably wasn‚Äôt bored hanging out with Steve, he sure as hell had to be getting hungry.
Steve nodded as he took another step, biting down hard on his bottom lip to keep from crying out as the three of them slowly made their way towards Colonel Rhodes' car. He felt absolutely useless as Tony helped him inside, fastening his safety belt and cradling his damaged hands as Rhodes drove towards the hospital.
"Shh," Steve said again, weaving his fingers into Tony's hair. "Peter's stronger than both of us, sweetheart. It's why Stane was so afraid of him, and why HYDRA targeted him. But it's also the very same reason why he'll be able to get through this. And once he does, he'll be free of them forever. I know it hurts, but we have to let him do this. We have to let him show how strong he is."
"Well‚Ä¶ yeah, I have, but not when I'm supposed to be on my way to a mission briefing, doofus!" Tomis insisted. "Dude, sometimes you just gotta suck it up!"
Stacy gave him a sympathetic look. "It's true, Mr Stark. Gwen told me just before we came here that she figured it out quite a while ago."
After unpacking the day-old croissant and bottle of apple juice he picked up after his PT session, Steve boots up his computer and checks his appointments for the day.¬† There‚Äôs the weekly department head meeting at 10am, which he usually ends up dozing through since most of the discussion never pertains to him.¬† At 1pm he and Coach Dugan have a meeting with a prospective football recruit that Dugan is particularly excited about, if his no less than seven email reminders are any indication.¬† And then at four, there‚Äôs an appointment with some guy who apparently wants Steve to start coaching his kid in swimming.
Satisfied with the drawing‚Äîfor the moment, at least‚ÄîPeter flipped towards the front of the notebook, rereading the code lines he'd finished writing after Grandpa had left for the afternoon. He had been adding bits and pieces of information to JARVIS' code ever since Dad had told him that he'd gotten him uploaded, and he was hoping to give these latest upgrades to Dad before the extra-atmospheric test missions began. Dad had told Peter that Steve had gotten the highest scores of his entire team during the simulations, which meant that he and two others would be heading out on one of their trial missions soon. And while Peter knew that Steve was really smart and could no doubt perform the complex calculations that he'd need to do on an actual mission, if he could figure out how to have JARVIS monitor the calculations for him and his two teammates, Peter thought that would be even better.
"Huh?" Peter said as his head snapped up again, blinking in confusion. "Oh, yeah. I guess I am kinda tired."
"Well, hello there, young man," Ma said in her best nurse's voice. She reached her hand to cup Peter's pale, round cheek. "You're sure a sweetheart, aren't you?"
‚Äîface when he agreed to his invitation for the date, one of pure, boyish delight, amplified by the desire he'd noticed sparking in the handsome pilot's gorgeous blue eyes.
"Oh, but you'd be okay, right, Mr Super Soldier?" Tony snapped, his shoulders sagging when Steve's eyebrows knitted together. "I'm sorry, honey. I'm just‚Ä¶"
"On his own merit? Hell no," Tony said bitterly. "But, you add in a brilliant engineer like Quentin Beck, who's apparently been siphoning off my designs for almost the entire time he was employed at Stark Industries, along with some stolen Chitauri or Project Insight tech, and voila. You could make some pretty powerful weapons. He could have the military salivating with a single demonstration."
"No, it does not, Captain," Tony said. "If something happens and you end up missing that three second or so window, then the thing to do is not panic, just hang tight and wait for the next orbit. Since the power sources aren't in danger of cutting out you can theoretically stay up there for as many orbits as it takes to hit the window and come back."
Steve silenced him with a kiss, a soft, chaste kiss that nonetheless still caused warmth to spread across his chest, especially when Tony's fingers burrowed into his hair to hold him in place. It was almost too much warmth, given the fact that his skin still felt like it was at least a hundred degrees.
"And you don't need to be worrying about me, all right?" Tony said firmly. "You just get as much rest as you can."
"I am a Master of the Mystic Arts, Mr Wilson, someone that you might call a wizard," said Dr Strange. "And yes, Wong and I guard this Sanctum."
"Then tell me what you want, mo gr√°," Steve said as Tony attacked his neck again, kissing his way down to his collarbones. "How can I please you?"
"You did?" Tony asked, his belly swooping when he realised that he had just pretty much confirmed their suspicions.
"Oh," Tony gasped as all the air whooshed from his lungs in one fell swoop. He squeezed his eyes closed, pressing his palm tightly to his chest as he tried not to give in to the tears threatening to fall. There wasn't a day that passed where Tony didn't miss Mr Jarvis so badly it was almost painful, and he knew that somehow Peter understood that, even though he'd never had the chance to meet him.
"Oh, that one," said Tony. He thought for a moment, weighing the pros and cons. Mostly the cons, since they were pretty darn conny. "Well‚Ä¶ that's not actually such a bad idea as long as you think you can catch Strange before he gets blown out too."
"All right." He tilted Tony's chin up to kiss his lips, his breath hitching when Tony quickly deepened the kiss, his hand curling around the back of Steve's neck to hold him in place as his tongue plundered his mouth, searching for his own. Steve could taste the faint traces of peppermint and chocolate on Tony's tongue, and he quickly lost himself in the touch, taste, and feel of his husband as Tony's other hand slid down to his ass and squeezed.
As Sam liked to say, though, life was full of 'if onlys' and 'what ifs' and 'could've beens', and dwelling on them was not only a waste of time, it also didn't help anything. Or anyone.
"Yeah, well, tell that to Riley's wife and kid," Bucky snapped, slamming his glass down onto the table so hard that Carol jumped. "At some point you just gotta either say stop, or fight back. It's getting to the point where I don't even care how cool the aircrafts are anymore. This whole constant patrolling thing is just a massive waste of resources that could be better used for other things. Like allowing our fucking lights to turn on whenever we want 'em to, for example."
I can‚Äôt wait to hear what you think of the first chapter!  Please don‚Äôt forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment!  üíó
Instead of answering, Steve grabbed Tony's chin, bringing their lips back together as he shifted them on the couch so Tony was lying underneath him. Tony's legs instinctively hitched up, wrapping around Steve's waist as his calloused palms glided up Steve's arms to his shoulders.
"Yeah, I figured as much," replied Sam as he began another of his strafing runs. "I'm gonna hold you to that."
Tony breathed in, nodding as Steve carefully pulled out of him before dipping his head to brush his lips across Tony's in a soft kiss.
"Ohh," Peter breathed as he took off his hoodie and pulled on the sweatshirt on, closing his eyes as he burrowed down into it. It even smelled like Gwen, like she had sprayed it with her perfume or something before she mailed it.
Wanda gave a nod, twisting her arm as the window of Steve's cell disintegrated and he began to move against his will, led into a huge square area that was as big as a baseball stadium, with a ceiling at least five stories high.
"I'll get him, Papa!" yelled Peter, taking off towards the second alien, who was flying through the air completely vertical. "That is such a not cool way to fly," he muttered under his breath, veering to dodge a billboard that came careening towards him. "The aerodynamics have to be horrible!"
"Besides," Tony added. "It's probably best to have a snazzy new suit for your first meeting with a prince, right?"
Steve's face fell, and he tugged on Tony's arm. "C'mere, sweetheart," he murmured as he pulled Tony up to his feet, curling his arms around his waist as Tony's wrapped around his neck. Then he buried his nose in Tony's neck, pressing light kisses to his deliciously soft skin that always carried the faint scent of coconut.
"Us," Steve whispered as he curled one arm around Tony's waist, pulling him against him and tucking Tony's head on his shoulder. "Together. That's how we're best."
The second thing he noticed was the massive food bag tucked under Steve's arm, one that Tony couldn't help but notice smelled exactly like his absolute favourite dish from his absolute favourite restaurant in the whole entire world.
"Mmm, I s'pose," said Ned. "I just‚Ä¶ I thought we were best friends, but now you're telling Gwen stuff that you don't tell me, and spending almost all of your extra time with her, and‚Äî"
Steve's eyes grew impossibly darker, and he ground his hips down against Tony's one final time before shifting them so he was sitting up on the bed, with Tony straddling his lap. Then he shuffled forward just enough so he could reach his bedside table, digging through the top drawer's contents until he found a bottle of lube. Tony's heart began to thud in anticipation as Steve popped open the cap, slicking up two of his fingers before pressing them gently inside him, swallowing Tony's groans of pleasure as he carefully worked him open. Normally Steve took his sweet time prepping Tony, often teasing him to the brink of madness before finally acquiescing to Tony's pleas that he was ready. But not on this night.
‚ÄúTony, do you hear that?‚Äù he asks between his panting breaths.¬† ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs still something we need to deactivate before we‚Äî‚Äù
Obie and Killian had tried to convert Peter into a Winter Soldier using the Aminacin, but it didn't completely work. And when they finally realised that it wasn't working, that's when they pulled out‚Äî
"And what if the so-called 'stuff I'd rather be doing' is to sit here with you?" she asked. "Did you ever think of that?"
Climbing into his cockpit, Steve sucked in a deep breath as he pulled on his harness and helmet, trying to clear his mind. At the moment he absolutely needed to focus on his flying, there would be no room for mistakes up there with the threat level still high and with new patrolmen joining the shift, not to mention the grey clouds he'd seen accumulating in the sky on the walk to the hangar. Steve had flown with John Sheppard and Major Kowalski before when he'd substituted on other patrol shifts, and while they were definitely talented pilots, it still felt very wrong for Steve to be up there without Bucky on his wing, keeping watch over him like he always had.
"Approximately six hours, Master Peter. I'm afraid I am quite busy at the moment, so it won't be any sooner than that."
"More," Steve said, grunting as he suddenly sat back, pulling off both their pants before guiding Tony onto his lap. Tony threw his head back as their cocks aligned and rubbed together, the pleasure already building deep in his gut. "Teasta√≠onn do bh√©al. Teasta√≠onn do l√°mha uait. Teasta√≠onn
‚ÄúYeah, okay, but none of that stuff‚Äôs ever been attached to you‚ÄîI mean, a person!‚Äù protests Tony.¬† ‚ÄúAnd without JARVIS, how‚Äôm I supposed to‚Äî?‚Äù
Dad groaned as he got down onto his knees on the floor, holding on to Peter's shoulder for leverage as he searched.
Steve asked. He'd of course heard Tony and Peter mention the word quantum before, usually in the context of discussing their nanotechnology or one of Peter's physics assignments. But he had never heard the term 'realm' used in conjunction with it before.
"What the hell is that?" he muttered as he squinted off into the distance, trying to figure out exactly what he was seeing. It had to be another aircraft, that much was clear, but it wasn't any Meridian aircraft that he'd ever seen before, nor did it have any Langaran markings that were visible, at least from what Joseph could tell.
"Yeah," Sam piped up from the opposite end of the counter. "Damn sneaky kid! I caught him trying to swipe one of these drumsticks right off the platter!"
He supposed it didn't matter, because he deserved every single bit of it. Every single dram of misery and pain, because he hadn't done enough to stop it.
Tony scoffed, scowling as he remembered the look of pure horror on Obie's face during that fateful press conference when he announced that he was shutting down his weapons manufacturing, and the contrasting look of awe and pride in Peter's innocent brown eyes.
"Or at least we're assuming so," added Clint. "For all we know the FBI is just stonewalling us 'cause they don't feel like sharing the credit."
"Shh, little guy," Papa whispered as he patted the back of Peter's neck. "I can hear your mind spinning. Try not to worry, okay?"
"That and genius-level intellects," said Steve. "And I'm not going to let anything happen to Peter, Tony. I promise."
"Yes, he is," Steve said proudly. "He's at least on par with my husband and Dr Bruce Banner, if not even more so."
"Okay, that's it," Gwen said, playfully swatting him on the back. "Go wash your hands, they're filthy."
"And the only one who ever will, if I have any say," Steve said, barely able to form the words. Through bleary eyes he watched as Tony rolled onto his side, his rock-hard erection pressing insistently against Steve's hip.
Whether the people in charge would actually believe that he had anything to do with it would be another story altogether, especially since no one but a few select people knew of his intelligence, but Peter was trying to not think too much about that part. It's not like the government didn't already know how precarious his condition was. They were the ones who'd allowed him to get so sick in the first place.
"All right, that's kinda weird," Tony said as he ran his fingers down his goatee. "Aren't these things supposed to be subatomic?"
‚ÄúMight be nice to commandeer one of those trucks too,‚Äù adds Natasha, indicating the armoured jeeps parked next to each of the bunkers.¬† ‚ÄúThat way, once Clint takes out the guards, he and I can use it to move from point to point.‚Äù
Peter shot him a glare in response, one that seemed a lot more ferocious than Tony thought necessary for just a simple jab.
‚ÄúQuiet, please,‚Äù the announcer calls. As the crowd falls silent, Tony‚Äôs eyebrows knit together as he watches Steve check the fit of his goggles and shake out his legs, his lips so tightly pursed that they‚Äôre almost invisible.¬† A second later, Steve shakes out his arms, first his right, then his left, and Tony gasps as an unmistakable wince crosses Steve‚Äôs face as he returns his arms to their dangling position.
"Yes," Dr Strange said grimly. "It is time for us to join in the battle. The Avengers need our help."
"Well, Steve, I'm not quite sure how I'll be able to match up to that, but I guess I'll give it a try anyway," he began, his melodic voice sending shivers down Steve's spine. "I know I've told you this before, but since we've got all these people gathered together here at our new home, I'm thinking that it bears repeating. All my life, people have known my name, but that was pretty much it. That was it, because I was too afraid to let anyone get any closer. I was too afraid that if anyone got close enough to actually
‚ÄúIf that is indeed the case, sir, then it is likely Pierce who ordered the abduction of Captain Rogers,‚Äù said JARVIS.
"Yeah, I guess I can do that," Tony muttered. "You can just elbow me or something whenever you need my input."
Dodging various students as they headed down the hallway, Peter tried again to push all of his negative thoughts away. It was already April, for goodness sake, which meant he and Gwen only had about ten weeks before she left for Oxford for the summer, and the last thing he wanted was to spend all of that time moping around like a toddler.
"It's just a movie, Papa," Peter said, instantly regretting it when Papa's worry wrinkle appeared. "I mean, thanks. I really, really appreciate it."
"I highly doubt you're gonna find them, Steve," Bruce said carefully. "If these guys are working with HYDRA then they're probably long gone by now. If these are even their real names."
"Never thought I'd see the day," Tony muttered. He turned his head just enough to glance in Sam's direction. "We've only got three shots available, so we gotta make 'em count."
"But you are right, Stark is damn hot. And he seems to know what he's talking about too, which is good since he's a civvy and all," continued Bucky. He tugged on Steve's arm as they stepped into the hangar, pulling him off to the side. "But Steve, he is a Stark, right? I mean, you haven't forgotten what that means, have you?"
He felt like he had just lost a really brutal fight, but he couldn't remember throwing a single punch. His entire aching body was covered with various cuts, scrapes, and bruises, his head felt like it'd been filled with quicksand, and he couldn't remember the last time he'd had anything to eat or drink.
Letting out a heavy sigh, Peter dropped his head back down, trying to ignore the throbbing in his broken finger.¬† He had been trying to go without his pain pills since they made him so loopy, but he also knew if he kept pushing it, Dad would get even more hyper than he already was.
However, for all of Steve's meticulous planning, he realised only three hops in that he'd neglected to take into account the soreness in his right hip caused by him trying to compensate for the extra weight on his left foot. He paused in the very centre of the room, already dripping with sweat as he rested just the tip of his left toes against the floor, trying to take just a touch of weight off his right leg, and not even a second later found himself flat on his face, completely stunned, with his entire left side screaming in protest.
"Pete, it was just a bad dream, yeah?" Tony said, stroking Peter's hair. "Whatever you saw, it wasn't real, buddy."
"What the hell are you doing here?" Steve snapped, unable to hide his look of horror at Rumlow's face, which was covered with grotesquely pitted and stretched-out skin.
Peter grinned as he unlocked his locker. "Well, that's kinda the point, isn't it? It is a competition, right? A
"That's right," stated Tony. "I built them with patented materials manufactured by myself and my company, and paid for them out of my own pocket. I believe that's enough of a reason to classify them as mine."
At least Bucky had Sam, who Colonel Phillips had granted a leave of absence to help care for Bucky while he tried to adjust to living with only one arm, something that up until then had been unprecedented in the Air Corps. Steve could still remember how torn up Carol had been when Colonel Rhodes got hurt, because with her tight flying schedule she couldn't be with him as much as she'd wanted.
"Only Colonel Phillips and the nurses at the hospital," answered Steve. "I've never told anyone else. Not even my teammates."
And then, once he was there and had a visual on Papa, Peter could figure out a way to send Dad a signal, letting he and the rest of the team know where they were.
"Yeah, you're probably right," Steve agreed. He cupped Tony's cheek in one hand, brushing a soft kiss across his lips. "Were you able to fix Bucky's arm?"
Three heartbeats later Steve's beautiful voice came over the radio. "Phoenix One has made it safely it into space, Control. And oh man, what a sight this is! It's incredible! I wish you all could see this!"
Peter felt Dad sigh, and he made another attempt to speak, to remind Quill for at least the third time that Dad's name was in fact Mr Stark, not Mr Man. But after Dad muttered a rapid series of curses under his breath and yet another swallow attempt was thwarted by his dry, raw throat, Peter decided against it.
"Yeah, well at least my dad doesn't hide me away every time he goes out of town," retorted Flash. "I mean, exactly how much school did you miss last year, little prince? Wasn't it like four months? That's almost half of the school year, and yet you still somehow managed to advance with the rest of the class. So‚Ä¶ what. Did your dad have to bribe Principal Morita to let you continue on so you wouldn't be embarrassed or something?"
"Hey, kiddo, how're you doing," Rhodey said into the phone, a wide smile stretching across his face as Tony heard Peter launch into some explanation of something or other that he was excited about. Tony watched Rhodey wistfully as he took a tentative sip of the hot coffee, a plethora of emotions fighting for control inside his mind. Before he'd handed him the phone Rhodey had been stressed, likely neck deep in paperwork for the Air Corps cadet squadrons that he oversaw and no doubt in pain from the back and leg braces that he'd depended on to help him walk ever since his accident.
"That'd be my preference as well," Bruce suddenly piped up over the comm. "The hole you guys blew in the ceiling took out both HYDRA's cloaking ability and the sensor jam, so I'm trying to transfer as many files as I can before they're gone. We're gonna need all the evidence we can get to root out all the moles they've got scattered across the world."
"Nah, not weird exactly, it's just usually something you'd do when you're more serious," said Uncle Bucky. "I don't think I ever met a gal's parents because that meant you were ready to get engaged or something. I'd just meet 'em at the dance halls and have fun."
Papa's eyes crinkled at the corners as he laughed. "Well, you do eventually get used to them. It also helps that most of the time I was wearing a flight suit, and not my full dress uniform."
"Right. And Captain, I totally get that," said Scott. "I would completely agree with you if I hadn't actually experienced it for myself."
But even through all of those difficult times, Steve had never once believed that Tony had lost interest in being intimate with him. Their sex life had been limited only by their circumstances.
"Yeah, that's what Steve told me." He caught Bucky's eye, motioning for him to come closer. "It all right if JARVIS takes a scan of your arm? The holograms can be magnified, helps me see the problem faster."
But Doctor List only smiled, a wide, leering smile as he nodded towards the young woman, who the whole time had been standing as still as a statue, her face completely blank.
Actually, he couldn't seem to remember anything that had happened since he'd been tossed into that cell. There were flashes sometimes, flickering images of being attacked and trying to fight back alternating with overwhelming feelings of terror and helplessness, but the constant pain in his body and the worry over his husband and son were enough to make even those brief moments of clarity fade almost as soon as they appeared.
Bruce nodded, yanking on his shoelace. "Okay, and the whole goal of using the Quantum Realm is to try to reverse the snap, right?"
Steve thought, his eyes narrowing slightly as he burned the image of the offending senator‚Äîa woman from Pennsylvania‚Äîinto his memory. So far the tally was 17 Yea and 17 Nay, with two senators who were believed to be abstaining.
Steve's heart gave a lurch at the tentativeness in his voice, like he was actually afraid that Steve was going to tell him that he'd hated it. Securing his shield to his back, he took hold of Tony's elbows, drawing him close.
Uncle Bucky gave a nod as he aimed his rifle again, letting out a muttered curse when a sudden explosion behind them knocked him off balance just enough to miss the shot.
With a heavy sigh, Steve gripped the handlebars and started the bike, trying to push the unpleasant thoughts from his mind.
"In the street about a block away from the Triskelion," said Natasha. "Bruce said when he ran the plates on the car it was found behind, it came back as being registered to Maria Hill."
"Mr Wilson has arrived in the penthouse, sir," JARVIS said, causing Steve's belly to drop to his knees. Sam walked into the lab about three seconds later, his eyes going wide as they swept across Steve.
"Well, pardon me if I don't feel like taking your word for it," muttered Tony. "Especially after you wouldn't even come down and take a peek at Pete when we asked."
‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù Tony murmured.¬† He downed the last of his now-lukewarm coffee, grimacing at the bitterness as he pressed the button for Pepper‚Äôs office.
And he was there when Steve nearly drowned after his plunge into the river‚Äôs ice-cold water, an experience that Steve still relives in his sleep far, far too often.
And Tony also knew that Steve was stubborn enough to actually do it. He just hoped that Steve didn't wind up eliminating himself in the process.
"Wait!" Mantis suddenly said, so alarmed that both Peter and Dad froze in their tracks. Turning in her direction, Peter's heart skipped when he noticed her already freakishly-large eyes widening.
"Oh, yeah," said Peter. He handed his father the magnifying glass, pointing to the minuscule dot on the floor. "He's right there."
Tony threw up his hands. "Well, duh!" he retorted. "I had to sit down here and listen to you almost getting blown outta the sky, so yeah, I'd say I'm just a bit stressed!"
"Oh my God," he whispered as he squeezed his eyes closed, drawing in a deep breath through his nose.
"You're so beautiful, sweetheart," Steve murmured as his painter's hands finally moved further down, over Tony's sides and mid-back, his warm breath sending shivers down Tony's spine. "God, I love seeing you laid out in front of me like this!"
Tony's frown deepened into one that might've splattered Steve all over the bedroom floor if he hadn't looked so obviously ill.
But as soon as Peter heard Uncle Bucky's footsteps heading down the hallway, he reached over to the bedside table, grabbing the datapad that he'd left behind. Before the coup, Peter had been able to break through the Air Corps firewall in less than three minutes, so he figured it would be even easier this time.
"Once the serum infusion is complete we'll use a small burst of vita ray radiation to stimulate growth and healing," continued Howard. "And once that's done, well‚Ä¶ hopefully the results will be pretty obvious by then." He glanced over at Steve and Tony, giving them a single nod before turning his attention to Sharon, who was monitoring the infusion system.
And while Tony wasn't complaining too much about not getting hounded by reporters, the fact that it almost seemed as though the news outlets were being discouraged from reporting on the incident did not sit well with either Steve or Tony. Natasha and Clint had attempted to question Raxton inside the theatre after Thor had taken him down, but they weren't able to get much of anything from him aside from the fact that he had been experimented on at the Mongolian bunker, and that he had been programmed to go after Peter.
But Grandma only stubbornly shook her head. "Again, I couldn't take the chance, and especially not after he got the serum. That serum saved his life, but once he was in the clutches of the Air Corps, I couldn't take the risk that Matthew would do something to him if he suspected that Steven knew something he wasn't supposed to know."
"Yes, I promise." Then she gathered up her school bag and opened the car door, their hands slowly sliding apart as she stepped out onto the sidewalk. "I'll see ya soon."
That plus the fact that the moonlight shining against Steve's glistening skin made him one of the most beautiful things Tony had ever seen almost made him climax right then and there, and he wasn't ready for it to be over just yet.
Which, Peter realised a few seconds later, was probably exactly what the absolute weasel that was Justin Hammer was thinking.
That was the theory, anyway.¬† But for someone like Papa, who literally could not forget anything, if it worked, it could potentially be life-saving.¬† While Papa hadn't had any of his really bad PTSD episodes since he started working with Uncle Sam, he still had flashbacks every now and then.¬† Times when a certain sound or a smell or something would cause him to freeze, and he‚Äôd have to hold onto the back of a chair or curl into a tight ball on the floor until he was able to squash the bad memories back down again.
But Steve cut him off with his mouth, kissing him hard as he slid his hand down Tony's front to curl around his cock, delighting in the visceral groan that rumbled up from Tony's chest as he rocked his hips against him.
"No, we have not," answered T'Challa. "As the Soul Stone is vital to our ability to communicate with our ancestors, it is not something that I am willing to part with unless I am presented with no other choice."
"No, no, no!" Uncle James was saying as Peter stepped into the hallway. "That's not at all what I'm saying, sir! I'm only asking that someone from the JAG's office look into what the statute of limitations would be in a case like this!"
For himself and Tony, there was no question. They both would do whatever it took to bring their son back, including sacrificing themselves if it came to it. But to ask their teammates, their family to do the same, it was‚Ä¶
"I've got you, honey," Tony murmured, over and over as he stroked Steve's hair. "I love you. We're gonna be okay."
As soon as the elevator doors had closed both Dad and Papa turned to Peter, wearing their nearly identical "worried dad looks" that had Peter wishing he could sink into the couch cushions and disappear.
The piercing honk of a car's horn cut Peter off, and he jumped, turning towards the police car to see Chief Stacy impatiently waving his hand out the window.
"Yes, honey," Tony said, playfully rolling his eyes. "I'm not a complete invalid, you know. In fact, I'd still be working on my suit if it weren't for you."
"And I second that notion, Rogers," added Colonel Phillips. "If not quite all of the sentiment behind it."
"I love you, little guy. You've got this," he whispered before stepping back. A tear rolled down his cheek as he watched Tony smoothe Peter's hair back before kissing his forehead, whispering that he'd see him soon.
‚ÄúOh, that's good,‚Äù said Steve.¬† ‚ÄúAnd yeah, I agree.¬† I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever met a more polite child than Peter.‚Äù
"I'm not‚ÄîI'm not sure what you're implying, sir," he said, as politely as he could muster. "But if you're referring to the Battle of New York and the Battle of the Triskelion, my dad has been working very hard with the Department of Damage Control to make sure that those areas that were affected are being cleaned up as quickly and as safely as possible."
"I've never met the man, General, so I don't personally have an opinion," replied Steve, which was actually not even a lie. While he had caught the occasional glimpse of Howard a few times in the hospital hallway, Howard had been nowhere to be found the couple of times he had escorted his ma's friend to the Stark house to clean, which had honestly suited Steve just fine. While he no longer considered Howard the national traitor that he'd once believed him to be, the stories Tony and Peter had told him about growing up under Howard's dark shadow had been enough for Steve to decide that they were all much better off with him out of the picture.
"Yeah, it was pretty quiet today," said Steve. "Actually, it was almost a bit too quiet. Like we were just up there for a joyride or something. I was only engaged by the enemy once, and both Major Lorne and Cam Mitchell told me that they never even got a glimpse of their mirrors."
"Code green for containment, and Helen's developed a sedative she says should be able to knock him out as long as we can get it into a large vein right away," said Tony. "And Nat's already volunteered to take care of it if it comes to that."
They were about three blocks from home when Peter spoke up again. "Um, my Decathlon Captain, Liz, invited our team to come to a party at her house this Friday. It's just gonna be food and pop and games and stuff, so do you think I could go?"
"Well, then it's a good thing that I don't quit, which you of all people should know," Steve said, crossing his arms. "So you just take your time, and when you're ready, I'll be here. But I'm not going anywhere."
"Okay, but here's the thing, Scott," said Bruce from his perch just inside the van's dual back doors. "Tony and I understand the basic premise behind what you call the Ant-Man suit. But what you're describing, this whole Quantum Realm thing, it just goes against all the laws of physics that we know."
Steve gave a nod, swiping his wet cheeks across the sleeve of his t-shirt. "Yeah, I know. But knowing that doesn't seem to help much, 'cause it just
"General O'Brien doesn't scare me, Tony," Steve said. "And I promise I'm not going to do anything that would put you or Peter in danger."
"Yeah, I think so!" Bruce answered as he lifted off from the plain, landing several metres ahead of Steve's speeder. With Bruce and Hulk still having their‚Ä¶ differences of opinion, Steve had suggested that Bruce start out the impending battle wearing the armour. If Hulk then decided to join them once things got underway, all the better.
Almost instantly Steve's face twisted into an expression of such anguish that tears welled in Tony's eyes. "Honey‚Äî"
"Goddamnit, Rogers, we still can't see anything on the radar!" Colonel O'Brien shouted over the radio. "Are you absolutely positive about what you're seeing?"
Mr Stacy leaned forward, his jaw set. "I was there, that night in Harlem when the Hulk and that other thing went nuts and destroyed ten city blocks. And I was also there during the Battle of New York, watching as those alien things destroyed buildings and killed people. And both times we lost a lot of officers. Good, loyal officers, who had families, and yet the Avengers seem to come out okay every single time. Don't they."
That at least had managed to pull a short laugh out of Steve. He couldn't imagine the look on Phillips' face if he'd gone up and asked to be relieved from his patrol just because he'd had an argument with his boyfriend.
"A wizard?" Peter exclaimed. "Did you and Papa actually meet a wizard today? Like, a real-life wizard?"
But that didn't mean that the attempt had been completely successful, especially since Papa had thought it necessary to give Peter the very same lecture about teamwork that he'd given him before his first Avengers' training session, but then told him that he would no longer be allowed to train with the team until he and Dad thought Peter was ready again. And, when Peter asked when that might be, he said that they would just have to see.
"Bruce estimated that Hulk generates at least fifty-five million Newtons when he's just throwing out casual punches," Tony said. "So I think we're gonna need more."
"Thank you, Mr Chairman," Steve said softly. "It is still quite a painful memory, and one I don't particularly enjoy having to relive."
"C'mon, man," Tony muttered, checking the conference room clock yet again. Pepper had offered to attend the meeting as well, but Tony had declined. She was already busy enough overseeing the opening of the new Stark Industries building in India, as well as coordinating a second run of their newest StarkPhone since the first had completely sold out in only a couple of weeks.
‚ÄúTony!‚Äù Steve snaps, cringing as that pained look crosses Tony‚Äôs face again.¬† But in the two-plus years that he‚Äôs been living in this century, he‚Äôs already heard enough of Tony‚Äôs self-deprecating diatribes to fill three lifetimes, and he‚Äôs definitely
Steve nodded, brushing his thumb across Tony's cheekbones. Tony had said things like that to Steve many times over the course of their relationship, and Steve was always a bit unsure on how to respond. While it angered him that Tony had been treated so poorly in the past, the selfish part of him enjoyed the fact that he now got to demonstrate to Tony just how loved he was.
Steve knew that the HYDRA agents were tampering with his memory‚Äîprobably with the very same drug that Obadiah Stane had used on Peter in Afghanistan‚Äîwhich was why he couldn't remember how he managed to get so badly injured. He only knew that he had been forced to repeatedly fight against something strong, manoeuvrable, and metal, and more than once if his barely-healed crushed left foot was any indication, but other than that it was only a blur of swinging fists, landed blows, and a whole lot of noise.
, 'cause this isn't the only thing on my rather packed agenda today, so we need to be moving things along now."
He was cut off by Steve's mouth claiming his, urgent and demanding as he slid his hands down Tony's ass to his thighs, lifting him into his arms as if he weighed practically nothing. Before Tony realised what was happening Steve had carried him over to the bed, sitting down on the edge as he plundered Tony's mouth with his tongue, his hands rucking Tony's shirt out from his waistband to slip underneath.
"Yes, baby, I can feel you," Tony whispered. His smooth skin glistened in the candlelight, and Steve was certain that he had never been more beautiful. "It's like you're inside my very being."
of an approaching sentry suit caused Peter to whip around, his heart giving a jump when he realised there were no decent places for him to hide except for the sand.
"Yeah. But, as to why they're suddenly attacking Wakanda instead of New York, we don't know, and we also don't know why they stopped after only one blast. Papa's working with Fury to see if we can get some sort of dialogue open with the Wakandan king, but until that happens we probably won't learn anything else."
Tony had said as Steve stared at the floor plan in shock.¬† Laid out much like their Tower penthouse, their new home also boasted a fully-stocked art studio, complete with floor-to-ceiling windows to allow in as much natural light as possible.
Embarrassment washed over Tony as he tried to tear his eyes away, but, like usual, the intensity of Steve's gaze held him locked in place.
"You keep that bouncing up and you're gonna end up drilling yourself right through the ground," Bucky said. He clamped a hand on Steve's shoulder, putting a halt to his nervous fidgeting. "What the hell, Stevie? You went to space twice and you weren't this jittery."
The second text was from Tony, and as Steve read it over he sped up his footsteps until he was practically trotting down the street towards the Tower. The team had indeed found something of importance, and were waiting for him in Tony's lab.
"Oh God, buddy," Tony rasped as he pitched forward, burying his face in Peter's hair as he peppered him with kisses. "You've been out for awhile, but I think‚ÄîI think you're gonna be okay now. Helen said we just needed to give you time, so‚Äî"
He had just downed the last of his coffee when there came a series of three sharp knocks on his door, with Steve poking his head in a second later.
Which, at least from Peter's perspective, there seemed to be far too many. Aside from the atrocities committed by Hitler's Nazi regime before and during World War II, there was also the increasing hostility between the U.S. and Soviet Bloc countries that led to the weapons races that nearly bankrupted the economies on both sides before they were finally brought to a halt in the 1980's.
"Try and have a good day, little guy, okay?" Papa said, kissing Peter on the top of his head. "I love you."
"As I'll ever be," answered Steve. Returning his sketchbook to its secret pocket, he grabbed hold of his cowl and shield and got to his feet, squaring his shoulders as Sam cut the jet's engines and lowered the ramp. King T'Challa was waiting in the same place as he'd been during their last visit, flanked by his guards with his hands clasped in front of him.
Losing his virginity on the night of his senior prom was one of those experiences that Steve desperately wished he could purge from his mind.¬† Not even the hard slap across the face he‚Äôd gotten afterwards could compare to how fumbling and awkward he had felt, or how scared he‚Äôd been that he was somehow broken when it didn't turn out to be as mind-blowing as all of his friends had said it was.
He felt Tony‚Äôs lips brush across the top of his shoulder.¬† ‚ÄúOkay, honey,‚Äù he murmured.¬† ‚ÄúHow ‚Äòbout we go back to sleep then, yeah?¬† It‚Äôs still pitch black outside.‚Äù
"Daddy," he whispered, his voice a bit raspy and soft, but still stronger than it had been before the Phoenix mission.
"Yeah, I'd say the chance of being shot at from orbiting super-helicarriers wouldn't be something that I'd enjoy very much." Tony bit his lip, he was going to have to tread carefully here. "But, Steve‚Ä¶ even though we managed to stop Project Insight, and Obie and Killian, HYDRA has still managed to control us through our own fear since then, don't you think?"
That had been the rest of Admiral Nimitz's famous quote, which Peter had felt compelled to look up the day after that seemingly random trivia question, and now couldn't get out of his mind because of how well it seemed to describe his family's current situation.
Steve's throat tightened, and he placed his hand gently on Peter's shoulder. "I'm sorry, Peter, but I do need to get going now. Is it all right if I come back tomorrow and see you again?"
"Well, I guess I'll see you tomorrow?" Peter asked just as Chief Stacy pulled into the parking lot in his unmarked police car.
"He said, 'Dad, Papa, I'm okay," Steve finished, gasping as Tony tipped forward, nearly crumpling against him. He curled his arms around his husband, burying his face in Tony's hair as Tony's hands slid up his back to cup his shoulders, his entire body trembling.
" he exclaimed as JARVIS suddenly zoomed him out of the way just in time to avoid being bowled over by another ship as it suddenly appeared at the wormhole's exit, this one even more ridiculously massive than the one they'd just blown up. "Oh,
"No, no, no!" Peter cried, launching his web at the swinging van doors and holding on tight as it picked up speed, showering him with dirt and rocks. "This isn't how it was supposed to happen!"
yelled Steve. But his words had no bite to them, his voice cracking on the final word, and he managed to maintain his composure for about three more seconds before his face completely crumpled and he pitched forward. Tony managed to catch him just before he hit the floor, guiding him over to the far wall where he sat them down, removing the shield and Steve's cowl.
Steve had contemplated the possibility of having Carol take over the tesseract part of the mission and training someone else to deploy the satellites with her, but had ended up deciding against it for a few reasons. One: while everyone on the A-shift had trained in the Phoenix simulators, only he, Carol, and Bucky were chosen for the trial space mission. Making a change this late in the game would not only be asking for trouble, it could potentially raise suspicions in the wrong people. Two: as the de facto leader of their team, it was therefore Steve's responsibility to conduct the most important part of the mission. If anything happened to go wrong with the tesseract itself or its deployment, the whole thing would fail.
Tony slowly shook his head, his face a pale greyish colour. "I don't know yet, babe, but I have to say I have a few ideas, and they're all scaring the shit outta me."
‚ÄúNo, little guy, I guess you're right,‚Äù Steve said.¬† He checked the clock, relieved when he saw there were only three more minutes till closing.¬† ‚ÄúWhat do you say we get started on getting out of here?‚Äù
Peter thinks as they walk the few metres to the conference room.¬† Peter‚Äôs mouth drops open as they step inside and Mr Rogers stands up from his chair, hurrying over to them with his hand outstretched.
"Okay." Steve let out a semi-contented sigh as he cuddled even closer, kissing the top of Tony's head.
"I agree, which is why I think you and I should take a trip down to D.C.," Rhodey said. "I need to check back in with the Pentagon anyway, and the Stark Industries building is secure enough to keep HYDRA off our backs, isn't it?"
‚ÄúMore like my entire week!‚Äù Peter said as he leaned back in his chair.¬† ‚ÄúI think you would've liked this place.¬† The owner seemed like a really nice guy.‚Äù
"Yeah, okay," Peter said rapidly. "But will you come back once you find him? My papa is hurt, and I need to get him out of here so the doctor can help him."
An attempt he aborted due to an immediate massive rush of pain, throbbing its way from the tips of his fingers all the way up to his elbow.
Peter sighed as he nodded, his expression glum as he launched the textbook onto his bed, crawling three paces down before executing a perfect backflip onto the floor.
Colonel Phillips shifted on his feet, jerking his head towards the infusion setup. "What you can see over there, gentlemen, is the only dose of the super-soldier serum currently in existence," he said. "But it wasn't one that was left over. Howard only finished manufacturing this dose about two weeks ago."
"I love you too, honey," Tony whispered. He slid his palms up Steve's arms and shoulders to cup his face. "Just‚Ä¶ promise me that you're not gonna go diving out of any highrise windows this time, okay? 'Cause there's absolutely no need for that kind of drama."
"Look," Tony said once the doors had closed. "I don't understand where this fear of yours is coming from, but I promise that it's completely unwarranted. That child is so infatuated with you that I'd be having some serious jealousy issues right about now if I wasn't just as infatuated, all right? And all he wants is to just see for himself that you're okay. You can give him that, can't you?"
Not exactly an easy task, especially since thanks to the above-mentioned strangling, Thanos was now in possession of the Time Stone.
"And since you guys had to ask, I have no idea how it worked," Quill went on. "All I know is that after I was born, Ego made my mom sick until she died. So I killed him."
All he'd ever wanted to do was serve his country, the very same country his own father had given his life for, and protect his family that he loved more than his own life. Almost every single decision that he'd made since he had turned eighteen years old had been toward one or both of those ends, so how could Davis not see that?
And that was something that Steve couldn't allow. He simply could not allow himself to fall into the same abyss as Tony, or there would be no one left to pull them back out again.
‚ÄúPete‚Ä¶‚Äù Tony murmured as he shuffled over to the breakfast bar.¬† Slowly, he curled his arm around Peter‚Äôs shoulders, tears pricking his eyes when Peter tipped against him.¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, buddy.¬† That was way outta line.‚Äù
"Yes, I'm sure that comes in handy from time to time," Mr Stacy said suddenly. "Although I'm not sure I'd specifically choose the term, 'living legend'."
"Oh for fuck's sake, get the hell away from him!" Tony snapped as he shoved Howard aside, nearly sending him to the floor. At the last second Howard grabbed onto the foot of Peter's bed, shock registering on his face as he looked over at Tony, blinking as if he'd just realised he was there.
He‚Äôs not sure how long he sleeps the second time.¬† Or the third, or even the fourth.¬† But by the time three days have passed and no help has come, Steve is about at his wit‚Äôs end.¬† He‚Äôs so cold that his limbs feel frozen in place, he has maybe one or two sips of water left, and with no books to read or drawings to sketch, the constant pins-and-needles sensation of his healing leg has become so all-consuming that he feels like he‚Äôs going mad.
But it was really only a matter of time before the cranky old general became desperate enough to do so, and then‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ then all bets were off as to whether anyone would survive.
And most of all, in the way that Dad hadn't called him to tell him that Papa was home and that they were on their way, even though Peter knew that the scheduled time for Papa's reentry had passed at least three hours ago.
"I'm not worried about the hockey game, honey," Tony said with a sigh. "Or at least, not too worried. Thor pretty much single-handedly took out both of those semi-enhanced monsters that attacked Pete, so I'm pretty sure he'll be safe enough with him."
"Which brings us back to Wakanda," said Steve. "If we all assemble down there, then we'll have the full fighting force of King T'Challa's warriors to back us up, and we'll be able to better defend both stones if they're in the same place."
Iron Man, damnit‚Äîthere was no way he was going to complain about the way Steve's large hands were currently sliding across his head and body.
Typing the last of the code, Peter pursed his lips, his trembling index hovering over the ENTER key.
Gwen bit her lip, leaning in closer. "If you want my honest opinion, I think it's because my dad's been having second thoughts about how he feels about the Spider-Man. You wouldn't know since you haven't been over in a few months, but my little brothers still talk about him constantly, and so do all of their school friends. They all thought he was someone they could look up to, and maybe relate to a bit since it seemed like he was a lot younger than the rest of the Avengers. And they've all been pretty bummed ever since he disappeared."
Since it had already been over an hour since he'd eaten, Steve prepared enough for the two of them, deliberately setting aside his work so he could focus exclusively on his son while they ate. He listened intently as Peter talked about everything from the latest Lego set he was coveting to the experiment he and Gwen were running in their chemistry lab, something having to do with designing a new type of Plexiglass. It seemed so normal, as the two of them had talked over breakfast hundreds of times before, especially given Tony's lack of appreciation for mornings. But this time, for some reason, it seemed to hit Steve a bit differently.
"I was afraid you never wanted to see me again!" Steve yelped. "And I also thought if that was the case, then I deserved it."
Tony woke with a start, bolting upright on the bed as he struggled to draw in air. Droplets of sweat beaded across his forehead and nose as he wrapped his arms around his front, his eyes darting from the walls to the ceiling of his bedroom, searching for cracks. A few heartbeats later he heard a soft moan, causing him to jump as he looked down at his sleeping husband. Steve shifted slightly, his arm instinctively sliding across the bed as he searched for him. Tony and Steve usually slept so pressed up against each other it was difficult to tell who was who, with their arms and legs tangled together and Tony curled right into Steve's chest, where he could hear his heartbeat and feel his warm breath on his skin. Tony had grown so used to having Steve there in the bed with him in the last five years, reveling in his husband's warm body pressed up against him and the security that Steve's presence offered him, that he now couldn't sleep without him.
"Yeah, I'd have to agree with you there, honey," said Tony. "And kudos to your ma for being so awesome, yeah?"
"Yeah, I heard about it," Tony said casually, even as his grip tightened on the tablet. "That's too bad for your friend."
"It better not be," Tony said with an exaggerated sigh of relief. "'Cause I am getting really sick and tired of just laying here."
"Yes, sweetheart, he was," answered Steve. "Scott was listed as one of the missing. But I'm telling you that he's here, now. Nat and I just spent about thirty minutes talking with him, and then I put him in one of the guest rooms 'cause he was about to drop from fatigue. But he's here. He drove clear across the country to get here."
And, just like he'd suspected, he had barely climbed into the backseat of the truck and fastened his seatbelt when Dad suddenly whipped his head around, looking back at him in alarm.
But instead of responding, Winter Soldier stayed quiet, gripping the arms of his chair as he stared straight ahead, his lips pursed so tightly they had almost disappeared. Tony's heart skipped a beat as Bucky sat straight up on the bed, still gripping Sam's hand, his chest heaving with every stuttered breath as he studied his alter-ego.
"Peter, can you please tell me what's wrong?" she asked, in that quiet, semi-raspy voice that reminded him a bit of Auntie Nat. "I mean, I know your papa almost got hurt and stuff again, but you've been‚Ä¶ I don't know, extra weird ever since school started, and I don't‚ÄîI just don't know why." She trailed her thumb across the back of Peter's hand, sending goosebumps pebbling up his arm. "And I don't‚ÄîI don't know how to help you."
"About as well as I think you should be doing," Sam said evenly. "I just want to make sure that you know that you're not alone here, okay?"
‚ÄúShh, honey,‚Äù Dad murmured, stroking Papa‚Äôs hair.¬† ‚ÄúSteve, we can‚Äôt change what happened.¬† None of us can change what‚Äôs happened.¬† What we can do is take the edge off the pain that those memories are causing you.¬† You‚Äôll still be here with us.‚Äù
The very same anguish Steve was now experiencing, the weight of it so crushing he was surprised that he hadn't yet been pushed into the ground.
‚Äîbond with each other over their love of drawing and all things outdoors had been one of the greatest joys of Tony's life, and he literally could not wait until all three of them could be together as a true family.
"I will, Papa, don't worry," Peter said softly, blinking back the tears threatening to drop. He sniffed, swiping at his nose as he snuck a glance at his beloved papa, trying everything in his power to not think about the possibility of never seeing him again, and only thinking about nothing else.
"Yes, sir," answered JARVIS. "All Tower drones are currently operating in their usual stand-by capacity."
Tony gave a shrug. "Best I can do on short notice, and it's gonna be rough as hell. We won't be able to see much more than some fuzzy outlines, but it'll at least be better than nothing."
"I'm so sorry, sweetheart," he finally whispered. "How‚Äîhow can I help? Tell me what to do, you know I'll do anything‚Äî"
But regardless of where he did end up going, Peter knew he wouldn't get accepted only because he was Tony Stark's son. He was more than smart enough in his own right to get into any college he chose.
Which then also begged the question, why was Project Rebirth halted after his conversion? If the Langaran military had intended to create an entire army of so-called super soldiers, why had they stopped with only him?
"Well, it's probably safe to assume that the alien dude was supposed to deliver the Time Stone to his boss, don't ya think?" Tony asked. He pressed his palm to his chest, tracing the outline of Steve's dog tags with his fingertip. "Which means we're probably aiming towards Thanos right now."
"Nothing," Peter said, very unconvincingly when Ned narrowed his eyes. "Just tired, I guess. Didn't sleep all that great last night."
"Well, okay then, Mr Goody-two-shoes," Bucky said as he shot Steve a frown. "What're you so testy for this morning, hmm?"
"He doesn't know, Tony, which is why he came here," Steve stated. "He brought the device that he used to enter the Quantum Realm, and he said he was hoping that you and Bruce could maybe figure out how to work it. And then‚Äî"
"It's okay, –ü–µ—Ç—Ä," Uncle Bucky said gently, and a stab of pain pierced Peter's heart at the deep sadness in his eyes. "I'm‚Ä¶ it's okay."
"Well, that's as good of a place as any," Tony muttered as he came to a stop at what he hoped was a safe distance away. He sucked in a deep breath as he zoomed in on the location, flinching as Sam's guns began firing somewhere behind him. The Chitauri were on to them.
Tony gave a quick nod, deliberately relaxing his shoulders and unclenching his fists the way Sam had taught him. Peter had always been far too perceptive for his own good, and Tony had never been all that great at hiding his emotional state, especially when he was already stressed.
Carol nodded, like it was completely normal for a human‚Äîor humanoid, Steve supposed‚Äîto be able to fly through actual space without a ship. "Yep. I was about two galaxies away when I got Fury's signal."
Thankfully, both Dad and Papa were still otherwise occupied when Peter got back to the penthouse, so he was able to sneak back into his room without being spotted. Dad had been holed up in his lab ever since he'd gotten home from school, working furiously on the MAUDE glasses that he was hoping to have ready within the next week, and Papa was down in the gym for his late afternoon workout. Peter had noticed that he'd been spending even more time down there than usual since he and Dad had gotten back from D.C., which, given what he'd discovered while they were gone, didn't really surprise him.
"Ah, the mythical Captain emerges!" Sam said with a wide smile. "Bucky and I were just gonna come and see if you guys needed anything."
"I'm positive, Colonel, it's right the hell in front of me," Joseph said firmly, his heart leaping as the renegade aircraft made a sudden course correction, as though it was actively trying to avoid him. "Now, maybe it's just some kind of weather balloon that's malfunctioning or something but it's definitely heading directly for the power plant, so I'm gonna check it out."
Peter let out a frustrated noise. "Actually, they considered it, but since I'd already managed to miss an entire week of school because I hit my stupid head, they decided it wasn't worth it!" He cringed as soon as the words left his mouth, reaching for Gwen's hand when she instinctively stepped away. "I'm sorry, Gwen, I didn't mean to snap at you. I just‚Äî"
A few minutes later Steve returned, bearing an entire tray of sandwiches, fruit, and chips, along with a large Thermos full of Tony's favourite coffee blend. While they ate, Steve brought Tony up to speed on the repair estimates for the damaged SHIELD building, adding that Nick Fury had already managed to move his people into the temporary office trailers that Tony had brought out from storage.
But what had started out as an offshoot group of some especially messed-up Nazi scientists had sprouted over the decades into such a massive and overbearing organisation, with tentacles extending into nearly every single aspect of military and civilian government and intelligence communities that at the moment it seemed that rooting out every last one of its members would be impossible. Especially when they were so damn good at hiding their tracks.
"Meridia's launched their own intercepting aircraft over into our airspace," Cam called. "Seems like the DMZ line no longer exists."
Tony tilted his head, pursing his lips. "I'd say you're more than just a bit rattled if you're pulling stuff like this now."
"Relax, sweetheart," murmured Steve, his left hand a constant pressure on the small of Tony's back as he slid in a second finger. "Breathe."
"Steve," Bruce suddenly said, startling him. "Steve, I'm really sorry, I know you're upset right now, but we've gotta get moving. This isn't over, and we‚Äî"
"Pete, it's really late, bud," Dad said softly. He pressed a kiss to the top of Peter's head, ruffling his hair. "You need to get some sleep, this stuff can wait till tomorrow."
Several heartbeats ticked by as Steve waited for Tony to move, finally giving his arm another gentle tug.
Steve breathed out a shaky breath, his lower lip quivering as he gave a short nod, burrowing back into Tony's side.
‚ÄúOh God, Tony, I‚Äôm not‚ÄîI don't know if I can,‚Äù Papa said weakly, his breaths quick and shallow as he bobbed his head from side to side.¬† ‚ÄúI don't think I can‚ÄîI‚Äôm not‚ÄîI‚Äôm not strong‚Äî‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, I should hope so,‚Äù Tony said with a wink, just as the pilot came over the intercom on Steve‚Äôs plane, announcing that they were approaching the drop zone.¬† Tony‚Äôs heart began to thud, and he swallowed hard, trying to keep his expression neutral.¬† This was the first time that Steve would be going on a mission without him, and Tony was nervous.
"Oh my God!" Peter exclaimed as Steve's eyes swept across the horrible burns that covered nearly the entirety of Tony's right side, including his entire arm, over half of his chest, and parts of his neck and cheek. Steve's stomach turned at the sight of Tony's beautiful olive skin burned almost black, with bits of charred flesh and dirt covering most of the worst areas. As he tried to quell his increasing nausea, Steve felt Peter's fingers curl around his left arm, gripping it tightly.
"JARVIS, do a sweep for bugs, will ya?" Tony asked as soon as he and Steve stepped inside their vast penthouse. He slid off his coat and suit jacket, draping them over a chair as he loosened his tie with fumbling fingers. Steve quickly did the same, hanging both his and Tony's jackets up so they didn't wrinkle.
"Gamora!" Quill shrieked as Thanos lifted a struggling Gamora off the ground, scrabbling desperately at his fingers around her throat. Quill reached for his blaster, slamming the hilt into Thanos' chest. "Let her go, you son of a bitch! Let her go!"
"Well, if having some heightened senses and strength is the trade-off for keeping him alive, then I'll take it," said Tony. He grimaced as another yawn overtook him, one so big it made his eyes water. He
At first Tony didn't believe him; he may have been drunk and stoned out of his mind most of the time but he had always been careful when it came to his hookups, be them with boys or girls, and had never had any reason to believe the occasional oddball claim that he had fathered a kid out there somewhere.
"Oh, you think so?" Grandma said, looking at him over the top of her glasses. "And what if I wanted to sit in here while you ate, hmm? What would you say to that?"
"Yep! I got ya, buddy!" Screeching to a halt, Tony blasted his repulsors directly into the alien's chest, grinning in satisfaction at the way his body twitched before going still.
Fear welled up inside Steve, overpowering his panic demon to take its place at the head of the pack. Tony was already working himself to the bone, not only with helping Bruce with the decryption of the Mongolian files, but also upgrading the defence drones that surrounded their homes, checking in with Pepper and his company from time to time, and keeping up with the team's equipment and uniforms at the same time as he was trying to get Beck's glasses technology altered so they could test it out on Bucky.
"Sounds good," Steve murmured into Tony's hair, which smelled so incredible that he felt himself starting to get aroused again. He pressed a quick kiss to Tony's forehead, practically tearing himself away. "Don't be too late, okay? Don't want you missing out on any of the food."
"Steve, I just want you," Tony murmured as Steve fiddled with the button and zipper on his pants. "All of you."
"Yeah," Peter murmured, trying very hard not to pout. It was bad enough that his dads still treated him like a little kid, he didn't need to give them more ammunition. "But at least I know exactly where they are this time. They're sitting on the bedside table in my room."
"So, then, what it sounds like you need to do is figure out how to slow the ship down," said Strange. "And I suggest that you get started immediately."
"Yeah, yeah, I get what you're saying, kiddo," said Uncle Bucky. He dropped his chin to his chest, shaking his head. "I guess I never realised that when they're sucking you in with all of their promises of riches and glory, they never once tell you that you're gonna have to sell your soul for it. I mean, I saw Stevie's ma. I saw how hard she had to work when my ma didn't, and I guess I just assumed that it was 'cause Steve was always so sick, so‚Ä¶"
Gasping for breath, the man frantically shook his head, his lips moving as if he was trying to speak, which only seemed to infuriate Tony even more.
‚ÄúOkay, um‚Ä¶‚Äù he said, scrubbing his palm down his face.¬† ‚ÄúSo you're trying to tell me that the enemy Steve vanquished back during World War II, which, if I remember correctly, ended in 1945, for God‚Äôs sake, has now just suddenly sprung up right out of the goddamn ground to kidnap him?‚Äù
"I'm not gonna leave you alone, honey," Tony said firmly. "Not for one single second, okay? Don't you even think about it."
"Yeah? Well, good!" Tony barked, just as a few of Steve's earlier words finally fought through the fog filling his mind. "Hold on, you told Colonel Phillips? About me? And Pete?"
felt the need to tell him that he wasn't allowed to officially join the Avengers until he turned eighteen.
Tony's fingers twitched, an involuntary response he had whenever Bucky was mentioned that he hadn't quite been able to shake just yet.
"Indeed I have, sir," replied JARVIS, and Tony almost smiled at the UI's indignant tone, so reminiscent of the human Mr Jarvis.
Pressing another kiss to Tony's temple, Steve pulled the two chairs shoved against the back wall over to the bed, guiding Tony down into one of them.
"I was‚Ä¶ Steve, I was a piping hot mess," he softly began. "Like a true, no-hope, wanna-end-it-all mess. It'd gotten so bad that not even Rhodey could keep me in line anymore."
"I'll be right back," she said firmly. And then she turned on her heel and walked away, heading in the opposite direction of the battle.
"Colonel Phillips deemed it too dangerous for you and Peter to know," explained Sharon. "He wanted for you to be able to maintain deniability for as long as possible. As soon as the colonel got word of Peter's impending admission, he made sure that I was assigned to him."
"It's just not fair!" Peter sobbed, curled into a tight ball on the floor while Gwen rubbed his shoulder. "He should be here, and they just took him away from us!"
Stepping back over to Tony, Nebula offered him her hand, pulling him up to his feet. Tony stumbled once he was upright, his legs not quite up to the task of supporting his weight. Or the guilt he was carrying across his shoulders like a pair of three-ton anvils.
"Yes, yes, I'm sure we all could spend the next several hours trading stories, but that's not exactly why we are here," said Davis. He tapped the tip of his pen against his stack of papers. "Now then, Captain Rogers. You were found and‚Ä¶ defrosted, for lack of a better term, approximately four years ago, is that correct?"
mention his name!" Tony snapped. He took a step forward, which immediately prompted the suit to Hammer's left to aim its repulsor at Tony's chest. "Steve Rogers has more honour in his left pinky toenail that you could ever hope to have in your entire life, so you just keep his name out of your filthy mouth, you got that?"
Pym Particles. Tony had heard Howard whining about them so many times as a teenager that he still occasionally heard him in his sleep. The fact that Howard was never able to replicate the formula that Hank used to create his magic shrinking particles had nearly driven him mad with jealousy and resentment, only adding to the gargantuan pile of shit that Howard had carried around with him like some kind of ratty security blanket. His entire career Howard had surrounded himself with other scientists, anyone who he considered as smart or smarter than he was, in an attempt to keep his enemies closer, so to speak. Anyone who Howard felt he could learn from‚Äîor steal from‚Äîwas fair game, no matter where their true loyalties fell.
Steve smiled, a warm, content smile that sent warm fuzzies fluttering across Tony's insides. "I love you too, sweetheart."
"Oh my God!" Peter exclaimed, slamming his palm against his forehead so hard that he almost knocked himself over. It was one of those details that hadn't seemed so important at the time, but he still couldn't believe that he'd forgotten about it until now.
"I said that I love you, and I want to please you," he said as he started trailing kisses along Tony's jawline, down to his neck as he slipped one hand underneath Tony's ass and pressed him up against him, with Tony's knees hiking up to hook over his hips. "Tell me what you want, mo st√≥r. Tell me how I can make you feel good."
Chairman Oklahoma immediately sat upright in his chair, glaring bullets at Davis as Steve's hand briefly closed around Tony's. "Please accept our apologies for that rather invasive question, Mr Stark, Captain Rogers."
He was just stuffing his backpack under his chair when the blonde girl sat down on his opposite side, holding out her hand.
"Mmm." Steve supposed that Dr Strange was sworn to secrecy by some stonekeeper oath or something, but he had just about had enough of all of the so-called "rules" regarding the infinity stones.
But he‚Äôd no sooner taken three steps towards the door when his intercom buzzed, followed by the chagrined voice of Pepper Potts. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very sorry, Mr Stark, but Mr Stane is on the line, and he says it‚Äôs urgent.‚Äù
"Two sketchbooks, and one set of pencils," Steve whispered, smiling as Little Steve came to the same conclusion less than a second later.
Peter grinned as he took one of Uncle Bucky's pawns with his bishop. "He thought it was pretty funny, actually. And I'm pretty sure Uncle Clint hasn't let him hear the end of it yet."
And now, faced with the very real possibility that another Chitauri invasion was imminent, Tony was damned if he was going to allow his husband or son to be hurt yet again because someone else was too afraid to act. Those images that he saw every single night, and that lived in the back of his mind every waking moment, those images of his beloved husband, beaten and bloodied and lying sprawled out on the battlefield, and of Peter, taking his last terrified breath in his arms‚Ä¶
Peter reached for his father‚Äôs hand, squeezing it.¬† ‚ÄúDaddy, this wasn‚Äôt your fault.¬† None of this was your fault.‚Äù
Peter gulped, attempting to smile as they arrived outside their classroom. "Well, can you blame me? I had to watch you fly over the edge of the building, not knowing if I'd managed to catch you or not, and‚Äî" He broke off, blinking back tears as Gwen reached for his hand.
As soon as Fury's viewscreen went blank, Steve turned to Natasha and Clint, asking in feigned seriousness, "Can Clint handle the twins on his own?"
"Just one more," Peter muttered as he selected another file, this one a bit larger than the two previous ones he had decoded earlier that night. After that first initial evening, Peter had decided that it was too dangerous to work on the files while his dads were still awake, so for the past three nights he had been going to sleep at his usual bedtime, then setting an alarm to wake him up at 1am and working for as long as he was able to keep his eyes open.
"And that's just not right, Tony," Steve said with a frown. "Is there anyone I could maybe speak to about it?"
He found Peter hunched over his computer at the breakfast bar, the counter covered with splatters of milk and marshmallows as he giggled through a mouthful of cereal.
"Yeah, but we don't need to be bringing that up now, do we, kiddo?" Uncle James said. He brushed his palms across Dad's shoulders, giving him an approving look. "You're looking pretty good here, Tony. I hate to say it, but I think you'll do."
The frantic edge in Peter's voice caught Tony off guard, and he sat up straighter in his chair, scowling.
His heart in his throat, Tony watched as the oscillating ventilator was wheeled up next to the baby's bedside, watched as Dr Goldman hooked it up to his tiny son's endotracheal tube, no larger than a coffee stirring stick.
"I don't mind watching you," Steve said with a rather wry grin. He tilted his head, trailing his thumb across Tony's cheekbone. "Maybe we can even talk a bit while you work?"
And for the first time in forever, Steve drifted off to sleep not to the sounds of screams punctuated by gunfire and missile blasts echoing inside his mind, but to the sound of the most beautiful voice in the world.
Steve smiled, curling his arm around Tony's waist. "That's great, little guy. You should probably send a few pictures to Gwen, don't you think?"
"Well, my father was of the mind that Wakandans should only take care of their own, that we should not get involved with the rather messy affairs of the rest of the world," T'Challa replied. "And to be honest with you, after what happened in Namibia, it would have been quite easy for me to continue along that same path. But after the attack on your home, and the discovery that the Soul Stone itself resides within our borders, I no longer believe that it is our destiny to hide from the rest of the world. We all must band together, as one single tribe, if we are to face what is coming."
"Good." Natasha glanced around at the path of destruction left behind from the battle, shaking her head. "You guys about ready to get out of here? Hill said the local fire brigade's got everything under control now."
Tony had even heard Captain Rogers tease the pilot called Mitchell that if he loved the aircraft so much then he should marry it, a statement that immediately prompted an eyeroll from Tony and launched an entire litany of groans from the rest of the patrol, with Captain Barnes replying that "Stevie apparently needed to brush up on some of his non-military vernacular".
"Honey, if Fury said whatever the hell this was isn't an Avengers-level threat, then why are you watching it?" he asked. "You know it's just gonna make it harder for you to get to sleep. And don't you try and give me that big song and dance about how you don't need as much sleep as me, 'cause you know it's just a bunch of bullshit."
Steve thought, giving his head a quick shake. "Great idea, Nat," he said. "And if the two of you find anything, be sure to contact Tony and Bruce right away. They'll know how best to contain it."
"No, it's not!" shrieked Tony, still struggling against Steve's ironclad grip. "They've got him! Steve, they‚Äîthey took him from me!"
Steve could understand Peter's hesitation. Asking him to move from the hospital, where he was semi-comfortable and mainly knew what to expect, into a house with an older woman who he didn't know at all was asking a lot of a sick boy, especially since his twelfth birthday was in only about three weeks' time. Sam and Bucky had promised that they would be there at the house with Peter as often as possible, and had even arranged for Bucky to have most of his follow-up therapy appointments there, appointments that Sam was going to have to pay for out of his own pocket now that Bucky had been dumped out of the Air Corps.
All of which were made worse by Tony's constant worry over Peter, and the millions of unanswered questions they had about what was happening to him.
Padding down the hallway, Steve poked his head around Peter's slightly open door, breathing a slight sigh of relief when he saw that he was in fact sleeping peacefully. A lump rose in Steve's throat as he watched the steady rise and fall of Peter's chest and the relaxed line of his shoulders, such a sharp contrast to the rigid, hands-tightly-clenched position that he often assumed right before the nightmares hit, progressing only seconds later to screaming and thrashing and flailing, and all the while ripping Steve and Tony's hearts to shreds.
"You know, I just realised something," Ned said once they'd taken their seats. "Gwen's out sick today, but except for those few days that you were out after Liz's party you haven't been sick hardly at all this year, and you've always been the first to catch whatever it is that's going around. It's almost like Captain Rogers passed on his super-immunity to you somehow."
"I said I'm fine, Pete!" Tony snapped, cringing when Peter's eyes went wide. "No, no, don't be giving me those doe-eyes of yours, buddy. C'mere." He opened his arms, relieved when Peter walked right into them, tucking his head under Tony's chin. He buried his nose into Peter's thick curls, inhaling the faint green apple scent of the shampoo he had used ever since he was a toddler.
Had the United States just been plunged into complete chaos, the likes of which not even HYDRA could have predicted?
Thankfully, after a few fits and starts, the dinner conversation flowed rather easily, led mainly by Peter.¬† Steve absolutely loved how with just one or two questions about one of his favourite things, Peter could literally talk for hours.¬† Which he did, all while being completely oblivious to Steve‚Äôs underlying nervousness.¬† Tony wasn‚Äôt quite as oblivious, as he had been forced to witness yet another of Steve‚Äôs bad dreams just the night before, but he at least kept his concerns to himself while they enjoyed their meal, laughing at Peter‚Äôs exaggerated stories about his classmates blowing stuff up in chemistry lab and boasting about how cool it was that he had a papa who had literally lived through the history he was currently studying.
"No, it's not fair," Gwen murmured, and a lump rose in Tony's throat at her tone, sweet and kind with absolutely none of the judgement that Peter had faced from a few of his other classmates. "And it doesn't mean that you're weak if you're upset about it either."
Clearing his throat, Steve squeezed Sam's shoulder as he raised his glass in the air, nodding at Sam, Carol, and Bucky to do the same.
‚ÄúAll right, so I‚Äôm thinking we should let Papa rest for a bit while we look over these results, Pete,‚Äù Dad said.¬† ‚ÄúAnd then, I‚Äôm thinking we should celebrate by going out to lunch, yeah?‚Äù
Choosing his business partner over his very own flesh and blood‚Ä¶ not even Tony had believed that Howard could stoop that low.
"Captain Rogers' satellite deployment was completed without incident, sir," JARVIS said. "Satellite will self-destruct once I have determined that Captain Danvers has proceeded out of range."
Unfortunately, Steve had barely made it ten metres down the hall before he heard a familiar voice calling his name.
"I know, you've told me that before," Steve said. "You told me that his parents adored you, and that‚Äî"
"Of course," JARVIS answered. Almost immediately, Peter felt the heat kick in inside his bedroom, the warm air from the ceiling vents hitting him on the back of his neck.
"But there was no reason given, other than the fact that it was old and likely expired," protested Beck. "And I thought you of all people would appreciate me trying to use our own resources rather than have to develop something completely new. You know, saving the company money and all?"
"Tony, now's not the time for petty disagreements," added Bruce. "We need to come up with a plan right now. And then a backup plan or three, 'cause I'm not sure one's gonna be enough."
Steve smiles as he allows Tony‚Äôs words to wash over him, chasing away the lingering chill from his body.¬† Then he tightens his grip on Tony‚Äôs hand and closes his eyes, no longer afraid to sleep.
"There you go," said Ms Sharon once she'd handed him his notebook. It was already past the time for her shift to be over, but she often ended up staying late to help Peter get ready for bed.
"Ma still has a ton of stuff left over from me," said Steve. "Including the overnight generator panel that she would need for Peter's oxygen tubes and IVs."
"Oh gods, I'm so sorry." He rubbed Tony's fingers in apology before moving his hand to the crook of his arm. "We're almost there‚Äî"
"Papa's got you, little guy," Steve whispered into his son's wet hair, kissing the top of his head and trying to ignore the freezing air hitting his bare back and arms. "It's gonna be okay now, I've got you."
"Um, right, Mr Wilson," Gwen said. She gave Peter's hand a reassuring squeeze, making him flush even pinker. "My mom and dad talk about when I was little all the time too. I think it must just be a parent thing."
Now, there were no groundskeepers. No first-generation Italian men dressed in overalls and gardening gloves and whistling as they went about their work. By some miracle, none of them had been seriously injured when the Winter Soldier's bombs hit, and though Tony and Steve had eventually decided not to rebuild the home, they had made sure that all of the employees were well-compensated for their sudden loss of employment.
Steve rapped his knuckles on the door three times, then stepped back, his belly swooping when Carol opened the door.
‚ÄúThanks!‚Äù Peter exclaims between his heaving breaths, which thankfully aren‚Äôt progressing into the tell-tale chest tightness he always feels right before he starts wheezing.
He had just finished marking his final note when an alarm suddenly sounded, blaring across the dark and silent house and causing Tony to startle so violently that the pen in his hand ran across the entire page of his notebook, marking a jagged line right through his notes. In a flash he was on his feet, knocking over his chair in his haste to race towards Peter's bedroom.
"I still want to go to school tomorrow, though," Peter said once he was able to pull himself together. "I don't want the bad guys thinking that they've won. I don't‚ÄîI don't want to give them the satisfaction."
"And tell us the second you get a signal," added Natasha. "I wanna know who's on the other end of that thing."
"Hmm‚Ä¶ it's not quite there yet. Something's‚Ä¶" Peter murmured as he tilted his head, inspecting his work. His tongue poked out between his teeth as he darkened a few lines near the elbow joint and added in the outline of a forgotten pinky fingernail. There was no sense in having a fully-functional prosthesis without the appropriate fingernails.
As soon as James turned around, Steve climbed up the ladder and into his cockpit, placing the drawing of his family right next to his altitude gauge. He stared at it intently as he pulled on his helmet, his oxygen mask dangling over his right shoulder.
"Tony, we've finally managed to find the source of the decryption key for these files," Bruce said, removing his glasses. "Nat and I theorised that the key was located in a Russian text of some kind, and so we've had JARVIS running simulations pretty much ever since we got back from Mongolia, and I think we've finally found the correct text."
used just a bit of my influence as an Air Corps pilot to ask them very nicely if they wouldn't mind cooking something for me."
"We don't know, Tony, none of it makes any sense," said Clint. "You're sure it wasn't just an animal of some kind?"
Steve paused to regain his bearings, trying to swallow down the lump in his throat the size of a marble.
Steve smiled, leaning in for one final kiss before escaping into the hallway, where he nearly ran smack into Peter as he came barrelling out of his room, a small, flat disc in his hand.
"Yeah, well, it didn't take the first time, so why should it now?" Grandpa muttered, rolling his eyes in such a perfect imitation of Dad that Peter's throat tightened.
"–ù–µ—Ç!" Winter Soldier stated, his nostrils flaring dangerously as the colonel scrabbled at the metal fingers wrapped around his throat, crushing his windpipe. "–Ø —Ä–µ—à–∏–ª –Ω–µ –ø–æ–¥—á–∏–Ω—è—Ç—å—Å—è!"
‚ÄúCome on, Pete, let's get you bundled up before you start shivering,‚Äù Dad says as Peter climbs out of the pool.¬† He drapes Peter‚Äôs towel over his shoulders, rubbing his hands up and down Peter‚Äôs arms as Peter burrows down into the warm fluffiness.
"And they're right to say that," Steve said, his voice quivering. "I'm sure no one wants to see you get hurt."
"Sounds good," Steve cut in. He held out his hand, indicating Scott to get in front of him. "Once I show you to your room, I'll get you some clean clothes. There should be soap and shampoo and anything else that you'll need already in there."
‚ÄúNo, my dad should be here soon to pick me up anyway, so I should probably get going,‚Äù he added.¬† ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm definitely gonna come back here again, I still haven't even checked out the rest of the store!‚Äù
"Well, I do have a bit of a unique perspective," Steve said with a slight smile. "We'll talk again soon, General. Take care."
‚ÄúNo, Obie, that‚Äôs exactly where you are wrong,‚Äù Tony said quietly.¬† He was barely clinging to his temper at this point, but he knew they were almost there.¬† ‚ÄúYou thought that since you are who you are that you could do whatever the hell you wanted and never get caught.¬† Well, you know what?¬† There‚Äôs a word for that.¬† Hubris.¬† And I hate to say it, but you just learned the hardest way possible that hubris never gets you anywhere.¬† ‚ÄòCause it is a pissy, unforgiving master that takes down its slaves in flames, and
"Ma!" Steve exclaimed as soon as the door swung open. After guiding Tony inside he immediately held out his arms, drawing the petite, slender woman with greyish-white hair into a careful hug. "You're looking so beautiful today!"
"Hey," Steve whispered. He slid his fingers under Tony's chin, tilting his head up to look at him. "We don't have to go out to dinner or anything, we could just have one of our old dessert dates out on the landing pad or something. Just a small celebration is all I'm asking."
‚ÄúHello?‚Äù he tries again, the word tearing through his frigid throat like a jagged blade.¬† ‚ÄúHelp!¬† We‚Äîwe‚Äôre down here!‚Äù
"Tony?" Rhodey asked, gently, but with just enough oomph for Tony to know that he meant business. If he hadn't been in the middle of the worst crisis of his life he might've even laughed at Rhodey's tone, the very same that he used to use back during their university days when he was trying to convince Tony to actually do his homework.
"Shh, babe, it's okay. I've got you," Tony whispered, brushing his fingertips across Steve's lips. He tugged Steve's t-shirt free, then settled himself over him again, grinding his hips down so deliciously that Steve moaned. "Tell me what you want, hot stuff."
"JARVIS," Steve said as he turned to avoid yet another missile. "Are we still good on our exit points?"
"Hey, guys," Peter said, startling Steve so badly that he actually squeaked. Tony, of course, just took it in stride.
Steve scoffed as he levelled his aircraft, his eyes sweeping his designated area for the rapid flares that indicated another missile launch.
"And none of the team has a problem with it either," Bucky said firmly. "In fact, Carol came right out and said that if anyone said anything about either you or Tony that she didn't like, she'd kick their ass. And you know Mitchell and Lorne are scared of her so they're not gonna try anything, and you know Sam won't either, so‚Ä¶ it's fine, Steve. No need to worry about it."
Peter demanded, wishing so badly that he could stomp his foot. He was fully aware that he was in full-blown tantrum mode now, but he was so
Almost instantly, Steve‚Äôs stomach transforms into a solid block of ice, sending freezing crystals shooting throughout his entire body as the realisation that he just placed fucking fourth finally washes over him.¬† For a moment, he‚Äôs too frozen to move, completely dumbfounded as to how he could have screwed things up this badly.
Steve had just jumped back to his feet when he heard Sam cry out James's name. A second later something big and metal slammed into him, forcing him towards the ground. He managed to swerve slightly at the last second to break a bit of his fall, bouncing three or four times along the plain before skidding to a halt.
Something had to give, and soon. Otherwise‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ Peter didn't really enjoy thinking about the otherwise.
"Nah, you know you don't have to apologise to me," Rhodey said as he hobbled over to sit down on a corner of the desk. He clapped a hand on Tony's shoulder, squeezing it gently. "Just remember that you're not in this alone, okay? There's a lot of people out there who care about both you and Peter."
The arrival of Peter in his swimming trunks pauses their conversation.¬† Tony moves up to the stands to watch as Steve leads Peter over to the pool.¬† After explaining to him how to use a kickboard and pull buoy, Steve settles into a chair to watch Peter complete his warmup of a 200 swim, 200 kick, and 200 pull, taking copious notes during each section.¬† In addition to his nearly flawless stroke patterns, Peter has also perfected the complicated whip kick for the breaststroke, and can breathe on both sides of his body during freestyle, a feat that Steve had to work on for a couple of years before he was able to master it.
"Yeah, I bet," Peter said with a chuckle. "You think Thanos' army will really try and attack there?"
"Pull up those files that Pete and I used when we replicated the Pym Particle, yeah? I'm specifically looking for Pym's description of the things." There was something on the tip of his brain that he knew might help them, but couldn't for the life of him remember what‚Äî "Yep, there it is," he said as the files began scrolling across his screen. "According to Pym, the Pym Particle formula actually alters the relative distance between atoms."
"JARVIS, please mute," Steve said with a sigh as the raucous applause broke out in the Los Angeles auditorium where the newly-elected president was giving his victory speech. Steve pinched the bridge of his nose, trying to ease the tension headache he had been nursing for most of the day. It was inevitable, he supposed, given how badly the incumbent president had been faring lately in the polls, but Steve supposed that his old, optimistic self hadn't wanted to admit the possibility that he really could lose the election, until he had.
"You're all right," Tony said, even as his stomach dropped to his knees. It's what he always said whenever Peter was sick or hurt, no matter how badly, because he simply couldn't fathom the idea that he wouldn't be. "Pete, you're all right."
"I'm so sorry, sweetheart," he whispered as tears fell from his eyes, splashing onto Tony's cheeks. "I'm so sorry that I couldn't save you."
"A kid who can lift a car with one hand, Tony, and you know it," said Rhodey. "And a kid who's even smarter than you, so while I'm not saying that we should just sit around here and do nothing, I think we should be cautious about following him right away because the last thing we want is for HYDRA to see where we're headed and either be waiting there to take Peter out, or move Steve somewhere else and bust the whole damn thing." Rhodey got to his feet, placing a hand on Tony's shoulder. "He's your kid, Tony, so you know him best. What do you think he's planning on doing?"
And while Steve grumbled and swore under his breath‚Äîand then cursed out Phillips later that night while out with his friends‚Äîhe‚Äôs never been more grateful for all of those hours of wall-touch practise than he is now.
‚ÄúI would love to,‚Äù Steve said.¬† It wasn't until about three heartbeats had passed that he realised Tony had just essentially informed him that there would be more evenings like the one they had just spent together.
Even on instances such as this, where after making each other fall apart at least twice, they happened to fall asleep naked and entwined on the couch in Tony's lab, only for Peter to discover them still there in the morning.
"A new hammer?" asked Peter, his voice muffled against his father's chest. His heart rate was finally starting to return to normal. "Can he do that?"
"Well, maybe I can ask my dads if we can all get together for dinner sometime," said Peter. "I'm sure they wouldn't mind."
A knot rises in Tony‚Äôs throat, one that he tries to swallow away.¬† How is it possible that this tiny, eighty-some-odd-year-old Italian lady can, with just a few choice words, slice right through all of his layers of proverbial armour and get at the very heart of Tony‚Äôs fears?
Tony huffed out a sharp breath, glowering at the viewscreen as Steve pursed his lips. The last thing he wanted at the moment was to have to leave Peter behind in New York before he'd had a chance to fully calculate the possibility of another impending attack from space. Rhodey was still up to his eyeballs in D.C. trying to help rebuild the Air Force's special ops after its decimation by HYDRA, and while Pepper and Happy were always an emergency option to watch Peter, as were the Leeds family‚Äîand even the Stacys, Tony supposed‚Äîneither Tony nor Steve felt really comfortable leaving Peter with anyone who wasn't an Avenger. The distraction of their constant worry for him was not conducive to a smooth Avengers mission.
"Again, you assume correct," Tony said with a sigh. "We can't afford to have any of those things offline for even a second, you got that?"
Peter glanced at her again, tilting his head. The girl was pretty, there was no denying it. She also seemed a bit aloof, but Peter assumed that was mainly because it was her first day at school and she didn't know anyone yet.
Steve's eyes fluttered briefly closed, his hands wrapped tightly around Tony's arm. "I know that, Tony."
Steve couldn't help but chuckle again, encouraged by the sight of his husband's beautiful smile. "I may have made some preliminary plans," he sheepishly admitted. "But that was even before we left, so‚Ä¶ let's just say that at the moment they're still in the‚Äî"
"Copy that!" Tony said, grunting as he pulled out of his dive at the last possible second, letting out a triumphant, "woohoo!" when the suit on his tail proceeded to crash into the rocky shoreline. "That's one!"
"Really? That's so cool!" Peter said, his entire face lighting up so fast that it almost startled Steve. He reached underneath his blankets, pulling out a worn, dog-eared notebook and placing it on his lap. "I like to draw too, but my grandpa always says that it's a waste of time, so I don't get to do it much when he's at home."
With the quickest of glances at his fuel gauge, Joseph steered the X-101 closer until he was within firing distance of the aircraft, scanning as best he could for any identifying markings and finding nothing. He huffed in frustration, activating his comm as he clipped the oxygen mask back over his face.
Steve hadn't been lying when he said that he had gained almost all of his sexual knowledge from Tony. He remembered researching some things on the internet before they spent their first night together, and that combined with the limited information he'd been able to glean while in the Army had gotten him familiar enough with the basics to at least give him some idea of how to proceed.
He was shocked that he'd even been able to stay conscious during Steve's mad firefight, given how long he'd held his breath during that final confrontation. Rhodey had explained to Tony that he'd asked Colonel Phillips for permission to join in the fight as soon as the missiles started flying, and while Tony knew that Rhodey had been one hell of a pilot before his accident, the fact that he'd still been able to hold his own‚Äî
"Hold on, hon, just wait, okay? I think we do need to talk about this. I mean it, 'cause babe, you don't look so good, and‚Äî"
After dialling the number that Steve knew by heart, Tony gave Steve‚Äôs hand what he hoped was a reassuring squeeze, his heart flipping when someone picked up.
"Ah, that sounds great," Sam said as he took a seat at the end of a long table. "No offence to the Wakandan's hospitality or anything, but I'm ready to get home."
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all right, Peter.¬† I should be heading back anyway,‚Äù Steve said.¬† ‚ÄúThe store opens at 1000 tomorrow, so‚Ä¶‚Äù
"Long as I can get all the kinks worked out, buddy," answered Tony. "And then, yep. Yours is second on my list."
"Your heart, Tony," Steve said, his tongue poking out to wet his perfect pink lips. "It sounds like it's racing, are you all right?"
Drax let out such a heavy sigh that he nearly collapsed as he turned to Quill. "I really prefer it when we wing it."
"Yes, I know what you think you need to be doing," Steve cut in. "But I think what you really need to be doing is getting some rest. I know you didn't get much sleep when you were in D.C., and now you've got this cough, and‚Äî"
"Shh," Steve murmured as his lips kissed down the trail left behind by his fingers, giving Tony a couple of teasing licks as he locked eyes with him, grinning so innocently that Tony couldn't help but laugh.
Tony had already likened Steve to an angel once, almost six years earlier in that godforsaken Afghanistan desert. Steve had saved Peter's life without a single second's hesitation on that awful day, setting in motion a chain of events that would've had even the most prolific fiction authors shaking their collective heads.
"Yes, and also because public opinion hasn't exactly been swayed in their favour yet," said Sam. "No matter what the news has been saying, I hear stuff when I'm out running and there's still plenty of folks out there who aren't buying what they're trying to sell."
Gwen snapped her mouth closed, giving him a quick nod as they took their usual seats at their corner table. "Oh. Well, it seems like you do that a lot."
"–ü—Ç–µ—Ä, –ì–≤–µ–Ω, you need to come with me," said Uncle Bucky as he yanked them both towards the emergency exit near the front of the auditorium. But they had only taken a couple of steps before the monster roared again and turned, blocking their path as it absorbed the lit Exit sign. It looked like it had nearly doubled in size in just the few seconds that Peter's back was turned, and was now so big that it filled almost half the auditorium.
"Hey now, I know you're not trying to tell me that you've never had a quickie right before heading out the door, are you?"
"Don't say child," Peter warned. "Just‚Ä¶ don't. I can stop a bus with my bare hands, I'm not just a child."
"And that monitoring thing would've let someone in to mess with the programming?" asked Uncle Bucky.
"I'm always ready for dessert," said Simon as Mrs Stacy disappeared into the kitchen. "Is it that cake that I saw in the kitchen?"
Steve gave a nod, swallowing against the knot in his throat. "Yeah. Just went down the wrong pipe is all. No big deal."
And while the U.S. and Russia were supposedly on friendly‚Äîor at least friendlier‚Äîterms now, the same couldn't be said for the U.S. and a few other countries, something the current president was attempting to exploit by enacting policies that Papa had bluntly termed, "exclusionary". Already there was serious talk about building walls, limiting immigration, and other various policies meant to, in President Cole's words, "Bring pride back to what it means to be an American". President Cole had even had the gall to repeatedly reference Peter and Dad's kidnapping in Afghanistan to try and justify his words, only backing down when Dad got Pepper's massive PR machine in motion and asked him to stop.
Tony gulped. "If it works, then yes," he whispered. "Meridia has the same energy problems that we do, so‚Ä¶ if that was fixed, there'd really be no more reason to fight."
Dad huffed as he released Peter, keeping one hand on his shoulder. "Pete was cold," he said, low and tight. "I was helping him to get warm."
"This procedure is going to be divided into two parts," he began. "The first part is the actual serum infusion, which flows into the patient's main muscle groups."
"Sure thing," said Carol, shooting Tony a wink before climbing into her cockpit. Tony had always liked Carol. Her absolute devotion to Rhodey‚Äîespecially through his accident and recovery‚Äîhad long-ago proved to Tony that she was the real deal. She was an actual human being beneath her Air Corps uniform instead of just another military lackey.
"Steve, I don't know," Natasha said, rather impatiently. "But it's at least worth a shot, don't you think? If Fury was trying to contact someone he believed might be powerful enough to help us, then we definitely need to see it through."
something Peter would wish on anyone. Even now, sitting in his classroom, Peter could recall the crushing terror and overwhelming pain threatening to steal his breath just as easily as if he were back up there, on that barren rock of a planet.
"The differences in the design of missile silos in the United States and the Soviet Union," Ned said. "It was actually kinda interesting. It seemed like however we did stuff, the Soviet Union wanted to do it differently. Like the exact opposite."
"So," Steve said once he and Tony had taken their seats. "Natasha tells me that you've got some more information on these infinity gems?"
"Yep, that's right," Tony said. "And we'll have balloons, and cake, and even a tree-climbing competition, yeah? And Uncle James and Auntie Carol and Uncle Bucky and Uncle Sam, and all of Papa's other teammates will be there."
‚ÄúWell, sweetheart,‚Äù Steve said as the group started filing into the restaurant, offering Tony his arm.¬† ‚ÄúShall we?‚Äù
"Which you still need to explain to me," Steve reminded him gently. "Or I guess to all three of us. You mentioned something about an orbital defence system way back on our first date, but we haven't heard anything else."
A lump rose in Tony's throat as he watched Natasha go, remembering how suspicious he had been of her when he first met her. She came off as such a badass, tough-as-nails woman, which worked very well in fights and with her Black Widow alter-ego. But when it came down to it, she was just as soft and loving with Peter as any mother could ever be.
"I'm allowed to see my grandson if I want to, Tony!" Howard snapped back. "And he at least listens to what I have to say, which is a lot more than you've ever done!"
"Just what, Steve?" Tony asked as his hands wrapped around Steve's wrists, halting him. "You think we should just go have sex so you can try and forget about everything again? Yeah, and how's that been working out for you, huh?"
Like Peter.¬† The son Tony loves more than anything in this world, the next world, and even three worlds over.
Ned let out a chuckle, giving Gwen an incredulous look. "It's just so weird how he does that, isn't it?"
"So, does this trip you're going on have anything to do with the attack you guys had up there at the Compound?" Ned asked.
"Oh," Peter said. "Well, that's good." Papa had told him that his ma suffered from arthritis, and Peter didn't want to cause her any more pain than was necessary.
Clint frowned as he drew back his bow, aiming the arrow about half a metre from Steve's head. "All right, if you say so."
"Yeah, yeah, okay," Tony said. He swallowed hard, trying to keep his focus on the Hammer suits trying to kill him.
"But‚Äîbut," Steve sputtered. He couldn't understand why Tony was making it so difficult. "I'll be fine, Tony. I'm just a bit rattled, so I thought if we‚Äî"
"And bragging about that is not exactly the best way to make new friends, Peter," said Green Lady. She turned to Peter, smiling politely as he offered her hand. "I'm Gamora."
"What, is it not sappy enough for you, Iron Man?" Sam playfully shot back. "Not everyone can stomach being as syrupy as you two all the time. You know that, right?"
Peter frowned, choosing to ignore the question about Dad. "I told you. I'm here to get you out of here." He quickly scanned their surroundings, searching for anything that resembled an exit and hoping that he wouldn't have to heft Papa up the wall to the window he'd snuck through to get in.
"Yeah, I think so," Tony said. He climbed up onto the motorcycle behind Steve, wrapping his arms tightly around Steve's chest. "I'm ready, honey."
"Yeah, I know," Peter mumbled into Papa's chest. He tilted his head up, opening one eye so he could glance over at Dad. Despite Papa's presence, his sleep was not a peaceful one, with his forehead etched in deep worry lines and his lips curled into a frown.
Steve was quiet for several heartbeats as they swayed to the music, the same song they had danced to on their wedding day. Finally, he pressed his lips to the top of Tony's head, his left hand gliding up to splay across Tony's back.
‚ÄúSteve taught me how to use the cash register this afternoon!‚Äù Peter exclaimed.¬† ‚ÄúHe even let me calculate the sales tax by hand!‚Äù
Peter woke with a start, his lolled head snapping up and slamming against the concrete wall he was propped against, sending spikes of pain ricocheting throughout his entire body.
Steve was certain that Anthony had meant his statement to be humorous, but Steve couldn't help but notice the tiny waver in his voice, as if he was afraid if something like that did happen then he would get blamed for it.
"Oh, I don't think it's so much an honour if it's deserved," O'Brien said with a rather ominous grin. "And dare I say that you've deserved every single honour and promotion that the Air Corps has seen fit to bestow upon you. In fact, I've also put in for a medal of bravery to be added to your record for your selfless act following the recent accident. There's no doubt in my mind that Captain Barnes would have been tragically lost if you hadn't been there to break him out of his aircraft."
‚ÄúYes, I think so.‚Äù¬† In particular, Steve was thinking of Bucky, who, despite his rather normal-appearing demeanour when he and Sam stopped into the bookstore, had apparently been still suffering from his trauma issues almost as badly as Steve.
"Oh, just making sure," said Tony. "Maybe you can convince Papa here to go get himself some food then, hmm?"
"Well, well, well. Who would've thought that the infamous vigilante known as Spider-Man would make his way down here?" the man said, far too jovially for Peter's taste. He clapped his hands, rubbing them together like a child who had just been presented with a shiny new toy.
"Well, the hits just keep on coming, hmm?" Sam said once Natasha's screen went blank. "I know you said this was supposed to be diplomatic, but are you still thinking standard mission op, Cap?"
"Oh, yeah, sure," Peter said as he stepped back, allowing Mr Toomes to walk past him. He chanced a sneaky glance down at the files as he passed, but other than the top page appearing to be some kind of order manifest, the hallway was too dim for him to catch anything else.
Tony gave a nod as he tried to take a sip of his coffee, barely managing to avoid spilling it all over his lap.
"You are going to have to go against your natural visual instincts here, sir," JARVIS said. "In fact, it would actually be best to blink as little as possible when using this interface."
We‚Äôre pretty much entering the final arc of the story now üòé, and I can‚Äôt wait to see what you all think!  Please don‚Äôt forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment if you like, I always love hearing what you guys thought!  üíï
he thinks as he takes his final breath.¬† Out of the corner of his eye he sees Shostakov about a quarter of a body length ahead of him, but quickly tells himself that it doesn‚Äôt matter.¬† A silver medal in this race will still ensure him a spot on the 4x100 relay, which means he should still get at least one more gold medal before he hangs up his goggles.
"I was gonna tell you on the flight down to D.C. tonight, Steve," Tony snapped. "So just give me a break, okay? You're not the only one who's a bit stressed out about this whole thing."
‚ÄúI know, baby.¬† I love you too.‚Äù¬† With another kiss, Tony slid off of Steve‚Äôs waist and tapped him on the shoulder.¬† ‚ÄúRoll over for me, yeah?‚Äù
By now, Steve was used to the hard tug behind his belly that preceded him entering the tunnel, used to the brilliant colours of the warp trails as he flew within them.
Steve thinks for a few seconds, then shakes his head.¬† If what Lorraine said about the kid recognising him is true, then the last thing Steve wants to do is be a jerk to him in return, like some athletes tend to do.
"Yes, well, I'm sure someone of your intelligence would agree that it is unwise to believe everything you read on the internet, wouldn't you, Mr Stark?" said Davis.
Peter shrugged. "That's just what Auntie Carol always calls it whenever you two are acting all lovey-dovey. Which is pretty much all the time."
"All right, all right, you guys," Steve said as he shooed them towards the elevator. "Go on and get packed, we're wheels up at 0215."
"Um‚Ä¶ you said that you've got a plan?" Peter said, still just as low and tentative. He'd always been too perceptive for his own good. "I'm only asking 'cause Gamora here seems to think that Thanos is gonna show up kinda soon, so we probably should figure out what we're gonna do before then."
Glancing over at Sam, Steve sucked in a deep breath and stepped through the circle, directly into the entry area of what appeared to be a large, Victorian-type house. Debris consisting of broken and twisted pieces of wood and stone littered the wide steps of the large grand staircase, and there was a huge gaping hole in the vaulted ceiling, almost as if it had been attacked by something.
"Because I'm the adult, and you're the child, child!" Dad said, barely shy of shouting. "And since this is an adult problem, it's up to the adults to handle it!"
"Excellent choices, gentlemen. If you'll excuse me, I'll be right back with your drinks," said the waiter as he took the menus from their hands, giving a slight bow as he stepped away. As soon as he was out of sight Steve reached across the table for Tony's hand, running his thumb along the wedding ring that he'd placed on his finger two years ago.
The file went on to discuss the death of at least twenty of the test subjects during the dose-titration experiments, since apparently non-enhanced people couldn't tolerate the higher doses that Peter and Papa received. Even Dad, who had been given the drug too, had apparently gotten a much smaller dose since they were afraid that too much of it would kill him.
And then a few lines later, a sentence that practically jumped from the screen and bit Steve on the nose.
And later that evening, once all of the data had been checked over and collated and Papa had called Uncle Sam and Uncle Bucky to tell them the happy news, the three of them piled onto the living room couch with popcorn and lemonade to watch a movie.¬† Peter took his usual spot between his dads, leaning back against Papa with his legs across Dad‚Äôs lap, while Papa‚Äôs long arm rested across both of their shoulders.
"Okay, but‚Ä¶ then what?" Scott asked after a short pause. "No offence, but how does that help anything?"
With a final glance at the hologram, Tony shut down his monitors and exited the lab, heading for Steve's art studio that was two doors down from their bedroom. He found Steve in his usual spot, standing about half a metre back from his canvas with paintbrush in hand, his head tilted to the side and eyeing his work with a critical eye. He glanced up as soon as Tony stepped into the doorway, his quizzical look immediately melting into a wide smile.
"I'm sorry," Steve whispered, pressing a kiss to Tony's forehead. "I can get a different clock if that would help."
"Well‚Ä¶" Peter started, gulping. His request was a long shot at best, but he supposed it didn't hurt to ask anyway. "You know that Irish Festival in Brooklyn that you and Dad are planning on going to on St Patrick's Day?"
"Phoenix One, be advised that we are launching more backup aircraft in about fifteen seconds," Colonel Phillips announced over the comm. "Just hold onto your asses until they get there, understood?"
‚ÄúPlease!‚Äù Peter begged, his huge brown eyes filling with tears behind his wire-rimmed glasses.¬† ‚ÄúDad, please!¬† You know how good I am with research and digging through stuff, so please!¬† Let me help!‚Äù
‚ÄúAh, well, I could always see if Rhodey‚Äôs available to babysit,‚Äù Tony said.¬† ‚ÄúBesides, the kid‚Äôs twelve already, honey.¬† Well past the age of thinking that hanging out with Dad is still cool.‚Äù
"He's just too good for this goddamn world. This world would've tossed him away like trash years ago if they'd had their way," Tony said bitterly. He scrubbed at his eyes, his jaw clenched tight. "This world doesn't deserve what he did for it, doesn't deserve him. None of us deserve him."
"No!" Gwen shrieked, shrinking down a bit when the other students shot sharp glares in her direction. "I mean, no, thank you. I don't‚ÄîI wouldn't want anyone to think that I‚ÄîI mean, that I got special treatment or something. You know‚Ä¶ 'cause we're‚Äîwe're‚Ä¶ friends, and stuff. Yeah."
Peter's heart clenched as he reached for Gwen's face, brushing a tear from her cheek. "I'm sorry, Gwen, but I have to go. Once you find your dad, you guys head straight to the Tower, okay? Tell your mom to bring your brothers there too. You'll be much safer there."
"Peter?" he said, thick with concern. "You stick close, you got that? I want you to make sure you can see one of us at all times."
"This mission is called Phoenix because it represents the mythical bird who dies in a burst of flame, and is then reborn from its own ashes. And that's exactly what we're going to do. We, this team of people who I am proud to call my friends, are going to put an end to the tyranny that we've suffered under for the last twenty-eight years. We are going to raise this country, no, this
"I know you're not," Tony said quickly. "You're sixteen now, which you seem fit to remind us almost on a daily basis."
Tony sniffed, stuffing another piece of bread into his mouth. "Yeah, but at least yours didn't dump you off on someone else most of the time."
"Okay, so‚Ä¶ then what, we're just supposed to let this go?" Dad asked with a frown. "'Cause that's just not gonna happen."
"You're incorrigible," Steve rasped as he claimed Tony's mouth, sweeping his tongue between his lips. "But if you hold that thought for when I get back, I might just take you up on it. Okay?"
"I have no intention of doing otherwise," Steve said softly, his heart fluttering when Tony grabbed onto his forearms, rolling onto his tiptoes to press a gentle kiss to his lips. It was chaste, and over far too quickly, but it was still enough to cause heat to pool low in Steve's gut.
"Sounds good," Steve said, giving Tony's shoulder a squeeze. "Then let's get started. Tomorrow morning, 0800 at the training dome. I'll inform Natasha and Clint. And Thor too, maybe this'll give him the jolt of energy he needs to get back on his feet."
"Right." Gulping down the rest of his coffee, Tony picked up his pencil and proceeded to trace a series of straight lines that cut directly across his drawing. Once he was done, he showed it to Bruce, impatiently tapping his fingers on his knees as Bruce studied it.
Steve let out a sharp gasp, curling even further into himself. To him, the word 'lost' or 'lose' were like curses, words meant to be spat, not spoken.
"Yes, please, JARVIS," Steve cut in. He gave Tony an apologetic look, earning a dismissive shrug in response. "Thank you."
"We don't!" snapped Natasha, her harsh tone like a bayonet to Steve's heart. She huffed, shaking her head. "We don't Steve," she said, a bit quieter. "But don't you think it's at least worth a look? I mean, what if whoever this is can help us reverse this? Bring everybody‚Äî"
Steve had just become too attached to Peter to try and distance himself from him now. And, if he was reading the flight patterns correctly, it seemed as though Peter had grown pretty attached to him as well.
"Oh, you'd better believe he was," Tony said. "Not only did I hear that he was almost every single day, but I could see it in his eyes whenever he looked at me. The guy pretty much hated me because I wasn't you."
"Well, that's good, but I'm still gonna tell you anyway, all right?" Steve said with a slight smile. "I thought you would've figured that out by now."
"He's a lot like you too, –¢–æ–Ω–∏," Bucky said quietly. He looked down at his metal hand, flexing it in his lap. "Some of the things you do and say, –ü–µ—Ç—Ä does and says the same."
Hammer's eyes went wide behind his thousand-dollar glasses, and he smiled, a sadistic smile that caused Tony's blood to crystallise into ice in his veins.
Steve shrugged, swiping at his nose. "He asked me to tell him about the Stark family, so I basically just reiterated your credentials. I didn't say anything that wasn't already common knowledge throughout the Air Corps."
"Well, I hope that's the case, Rogers, for your sake. 'Cause as much as it irks me to admit, this newfangled class you and all of your hotshot friends are starting tomorrow morning could very well be the most important thing that you ever do in your lives, you got that?"
"Mr Howard Stark was a former scientist here at the Air Corps, which I learned from my mother as a child," Steve began. "I also know that he was arrested for treason shortly following the Battle of the Continents, put on trial, and eventually acquitted."
As soon as the door closed behind him Tony flopped onto his side, grabbing Steve's pillow and tucking it to his chest so he could breathe in more of his intoxicating scent. It was still a bit difficult for Tony to wrap his mind around the fact that he'd woken up in another man's bedroom‚Äîand a
The colour of his hair, the very same vibrant brown as Peter‚Äôs, with only slightly better tamed curls.¬† The lushness of his full, pink lips, and the way they curled up at the corners, like he was in a constant state of mild amusement.
Finally, at 1859 and twenty-eight seconds, Steve locked the door and got started on his closing procedures.¬† Once again, Peter‚Äôs purchase had pushed Steve‚Äôs sales well past his target amount, pushing his monthly totals firmly into the black.
With how much difficulty Steve had been having with his memory, especially with how he'd managed to get so badly injured, he had at least been able to keep track of the two different men who made regular appearances at his window.
"You're looking a little pale there, Prince Peter," Flash Thompson sneered as he slid into his seat behind Peter. "You see another ghost or something in the hallway?"
He was silenced by Steve's mouth, claiming his in a kiss that had none of the chasteness or gentleness of his earlier kisses. Steve's teeth nipped at Tony's lips as his tongue swept inside his mouth, tasting him as his fingers trailed back down Tony's chest and abdomen to finally, blessedly, curl around Tony's aching cock.
"Okay, so‚Ä¶?" Tony prompted once they were seated. Steve could tell that he was frustrated and trying to hide it. He had been bugging Steve to talk with Sam ever since the water monster attack, and then even more so after Peter's horrible nightmare, but Steve kept insisting that he was fine, that he could handle things on his own, just like he always had.
"Yes, you were. And it was stupid," Gamora said firmly. "But after what happened on Knowhere, we should probably start figuring out what we're gonna do once Thanos gets here."
And then Tony hummed around him as he squeezed Steve's ass, and Steve cried out as his climax overtook him, whiting out his vision and sending electric shocks coursing throughout his body.
"It's about as convincing as I can muster at the moment, babe," Tony grumbled. "'Cause right now I'm just too damn tired to do any better."
And he hadn't been the only one. Mantis, Drax, Quill, and Dr Strange were all still on Titan after Dad and the others disappeared, which probably meant they had been snapped too, along with potentially billions of others.
"You first," Steve stated as he snaked one hand between them to curl around Tony's cock, trapped between their bellies. Tony's back arched up as Steve stroked him just the way he knew Tony liked, the pleasure coiling in his gut so suddenly and so intensely that his climax hit him almost out of nowhere. He cried out as the heat consumed his body, his fingernails digging into Steve's shoulders as Steve sped up his thrusts, chasing his own release.
‚ÄúSure,‚Äù answered Peter, even though he‚Äôd already completed all of his homework during the last hour he‚Äôd been sitting around.¬† ‚ÄúBut once I‚Äôm done, is it okay if I walk down to that new bookstore I told you about?¬† The one that just opened like a couple weeks ago?‚Äù
Because their phoenix had not only been reborn from its own ashes, it had also carried Steve safely home from space on its wings and healed Peter's broken heart with its tears.
But Quill either didn't hear Peter, or simply chose to ignore him. "Answer me, you asshole!" Quill yelled, spittle flying from his mouth. "How's it feel, huh? How's it feel?"
As he watches them go, with Tony‚Äôs arm draped protectively around his son‚Äôs shoulders, Steve looks down at his feet, shaking his head.
"Damn," Peter muttered. He buried his nose into his polar bear, thinking. "Um‚Ä¶ what about the drones on the D.C. building, would their range be long enough?"
The penthouse was eerily quiet while Papa read it over, with Peter focusing in on the sound of Papa and Dad's distinct heartbeats as he tried to keep himself from just dissolving into a complete sea of panic. His throat was raw from the tears he'd been trying to hold back since the night before, and most of his muscles felt as stiff as iron rods.
"Pete!" he cried as Peter's head turned to the side, and he faded away. Tony pitched forward as he lost his hold on his son, his hands landing in the ashes that remained behind. Like grease, they stuck to his fingers and palm, but instead of rubbing them away, Tony curled into a ball on the ground and clutched his hand to his heart, hoping against hope that somehow Steve would suddenly appear over the top of one of the piles of ruins, just like he had in Afghanistan.
He sat back as the waiter placed their drinks in front of them, some fancy Italian beer that Steve had wanted to try. Steve reached for his glass as soon as the waiter disappeared, raising it in a toast.
"No, I am not," Steve said firmly. "But what I am thinking about is that I need you to tell me exactly what's going on here, and I need you to tell me right now." He stepped back, raking his fingers through his mussed-up hair. "Tony‚Ä¶ it is so hard for me to see you like this, to see you so stressed out, and always beating yourself up for everything that's happened, and things that haven't even happened‚Ä¶ and not know how to help you. And you say that I can read you mind, and yes, I think I sometimes can because I know you so well and I love you so much, but Tony, I can't‚ÄîI can't read this. And if I can't read things, then I can't remember them, and‚Äîand if I can't remember them, that means‚Äî"
"What? Why?" demanded Quill. "I don't need you to keep any eyes on me! I'm still not even sure that I like you!"
Thor let out a sigh, one heavy enough to make Steve shiver. "At the moment, Captain, I have no suggestions. Only that it is of utmost importance that we find out if Wakanda is home to another stone."
Tony let out a heavy sigh as he watched most of the team shuffle towards the elevator. The fate of his husband was now resting squarely on the shoulders of his fifteen-year-old son, and his deaf archer teammate.
Dad rolled his eyes at the same time as Peter felt Papa's shoulders drop. "Peter, why didn't you say anything?" asked Papa.
Papa had concluded their discussion by saying that Peter still had a lot to learn about working as part of a team, but that since he had obviously been able to handle himself pretty well during the actual fighting, he and Dad were going to allow him to start training again with the team once Papa's doctor gave him the okay to do so.
"Yeah, and Bucky is well aware of that, Clint," Sam said warily. "He and I have talked at length about it, and he's willing to take the risk. It doesn't do anyone any good to stay cooped up inside all the damn time."
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.¬† I don't mean to,‚Äù said Steve.¬† Parking the truck, he hurried around to Tony‚Äôs side, opening his and Peter‚Äôs doors.¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just really happy to be with my family tonight, is all.‚Äù
Rolling his shoulders, Tony drained the last of the coffee in his cup, looking up as Rhodey walked into the lab, his expression grim.
"I do imagine that he did not wish to disturb you or Mr Stark, Captain," JARVIS said. "Especially since this was not the first of such requests."
"I think there's a lot of us who can understand how he feels right now," Steve said softly. "I hope you'll let me know if you or your brother need anything, though."
Steve gave a quick nod. "Yes. He's got a‚Ä¶ genetic mutation that allows him to heal quickly. His healing factor is similar to mine."
Dad pursed his lips, pressing a gentle kiss to Peter's forehead. "Yeah, yeah, honey, you're right. Sorry, bud."
Peter chewed his lip, impatiently flipping his pencil around his thumb. It had been over three hours since Uncle James had knocked on his door out of the blue, telling him that there had been an accident during Papa's space mission and that he and one of the other pilots had been hurt. Peter had seen the bright flash of yellow light out his window earlier, but the angle of his room was such that he couldn't figure out where it had come from until Uncle James explained that it had been launched from somewhere in Meridia, and had targeted the second of the three space-faring aircraft as they returned through the atmospheric barrier.
"Oh hell no," replied Sam. "I mean, well, yeah, there are certain parts of your story that are pretty unique, I'll give you that. But the rest? Nah. I've heard it all before, man, at least a dozen times. Have you forgotten what I used to do before you dragged me into this whole Avenging gig?"
"Aahh," Peter stammered. "I'll have to ask, but I don't think we're doing anything else that night, so probably."
"Yes, I can see that," said Sarah. She released Tony's hand and stepped back, gesturing towards her sparsely decorated living room. "Please, come in, Mr Stark."
"Yes, he does," agreed Steve. "But he's also a lot more like you than either of you would like to admit, and so he tends to try and carry other people's stress around on his shoulders just like you do."
"Oh!" Peter exclaimed as a kaleidoscope of bright colours suddenly lit up the sky in the distance, followed by a series of thundering
And Steve hadn't taken it off once while he'd worked to flush out the remaining embedded HYDRA agents from their foxholes, a feat he had finally deemed successful only a few short weeks before the appearance of Thanos' army.
‚ÄúAll right, hon, there we go,‚Äù Tony murmured as he finished tying the most perfect Windsor knot Steve had ever seen.¬† He shot Steve a quick wink as he smoothed his palms across the shoulders and down the sleeves of Steve‚Äôs Greens Army uniform jacket, tugging gently on the cuffs.¬† Then he carefully adjusted the Bronze Star medal pinned on Steve‚Äôs lapel and stepped back, eyeing him up and down.
With Dad‚Äôs permission, Uncle Bucky had told Peter the entire horrific story of his crushed arm and how it came to be amputated, including how the doctors had tried to save it before they determined it was beyond saving.¬† Peter had thought that since he‚Äôd read so many books and seen so many movies that depicted some pretty gruesome injuries that he would be fine.¬† And, likely thanks to how much he loathed vomiting, he‚Äôd always felt that he had a pretty strong stomach too.
"Great!" Ned said, his smile so wide that Peter was surprised his face hadn't split open. "You hungry, Peter?"
Various heads bobbed around the room in agreement, with Chairman Oklahoma giving Davis another deep scowl.
He could‚Äôve easily passed for one of Peter‚Äôs security guards.¬† Not exactly the type who would usually be found in a bookstore.
"Yes, but it also might mean he was trying to get in contact with someone before he faded away," Natasha insisted. "Which means we should look more into it."
‚ÄúOkay, but that ‚Äòdumb‚Äô missile schematic, as you so eloquently put it, is what pays the bills around here,
No, he'd have to wait until the experiment was over, and all of HYDRA's remaining influence over him was dead and gone.
‚ÄúAll right.¬† Just‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt be gone too long, okay?¬† There might be something else in here that we don‚Äôt know about.‚Äù
peanut butter!" answered Scott, sighing so heavily that he nearly tipped over. "Thanks‚Äîthank you, Captain. Rogers. For the‚Äîthe offer."
"So." Removing his shoes, Steve shifted on the bed so he was facing Tony, reaching for his left hand. "I never made it out for my run this morning."
"I don't believe we would," Steve said firmly. "Because we wouldn't do a damn thing without testing it all up, down, and sideways, and then again three more times. We wouldn't go anywhere or do anything until we know it's gonna work. No matter how long it takes." He paused, unable to stop the hope from blooming deep inside his gut. "Tony, think about it! We could have him back! We could have Peter back here with us, and if we can work it so he doesn't even have to remember what happened, well‚Ä¶ then‚Ä¶"
But later that night, after he and Steve practically pounced on each other as soon as they made it to their bedroom, spending almost two hours making love with an intensity they hadn't had in a long time, Tony laid there awake, holding his husband as he slept curled up next to him, his head resting on Tony's chest and Tony's fingers buried in his hair. It had been in the back of his mind for quite awhile that the fact that Peter and Steve had shared that brief empathic connection during the Miami bunker battle was perhaps part of the reason why their nightmares and flashbacks had been so much worse than his own since then. Bruce had treated them both with the Aminacin antidote, but they could still detect trace amounts of the drug in both of their systems, and in Bucky's as well, which had led Tony and Bruce to believe that there had to be a connection between the drug and their enhanced genes that he hadn't yet been able to figure out.
Uncle Bucky shot him a rather cheeky grin. "Yeah, sure. Usually guys don't turn as red as a tomato when they're talking about just friends, kiddo."
The despair in Steve's voice was so palpable that it felt almost suffocating, smothering Tony like the bags the Ten Rings had used to cover his head in Afghanistan. Tony gasped, forcibly stamping that horrible demon down, deep into the recesses of his memory where it belonged.
Plunking himself down on the couch next to Steve, Tony pulled up the incriminating code on his tablet, explaining how Beck had altered JARVIS's programming in order to send files to a private server off-site. To his relief, Steve seemed to take the news in stride, asking intelligent questions in his Captain's voice instead of panicking and immediately trying to get Peter home early from school.
He proceeded to file that thought inside its appropriate mental compartment, something he would need to discuss with Tony once he was able.
"Okay, but that doesn't really matter now since Fury obviously believed that you might be able to help us," said Natasha. "So‚Ä¶ it's really good to have you here."
"Well, it is a certain little guy's birthday tomorrow," Steve said. "I was hoping you guys could all come over and help us celebrate. I‚Äôm even going to bake him a cake."
"Peter," Ms Sharon said sternly. "I am positive that no one has asked you to do what you're doing. Have they?"
"Yeah. This all looks a lot worse than it is," Steve said. No sense in having Sam worrying about him. "Any news on Bucky?"
To his credit, while Steve had noticed the downright murderous look in Tony's beautiful brown eyes and the tight clench of his hands, Tony had only given the doctor a curt nod in response.
But Peter's elation was short-lived as he heard Papa let out an agonising groan just before spitting an entire mouthful of blood across the floor. He raced over to him, practically tearing the cowl from his head bearing the hateful HYDRA crest before carefully cradling him in his arms.
on his list knowing they might not get to that point that night, but he was still hoping he‚Äôd be presented with the opportunity.
"None of this is your fault, Gwen," Steve said in his Captain's voice. "There's nothing you need to be sorry for."
"Master Peter's nighttime disturbances are not as frequent as your own, Captain, but do occur approximately three or four times per week."
"I don't know, mo gr√°," Steve murmured as he started trailing kisses along Tony's cheek and jaw. "You're the genius, you tell me."
, for goodness sake, and rescue Captain America from some invisible building? The very same invisible building where he'd been taken prisoner by the Nazi organisation that's been around since World War II, and that had managed to completely infiltrate our government and law enforcement agencies? Is that it?"
"We could drive up with Uncle Bucky and Uncle Sam, and with Uncle Clint and Auntie Nat and the twins already there we'd be surrounded by most of the team, and not to mention all of the SHIELD agents and the drones, and‚Äî"
‚ÄúOh God, Tony, I don't know,‚Äù Papa said, his voice so thick that tears pricked Peter‚Äôs eyes.¬† ‚ÄúI don't know if I‚Äôm‚Äîif I‚Äôm strong enough, I don't know if I can‚Äî‚Äù
Peter gave him a rather sheepish grin, shrugging. "Well‚Ä¶ I added a bit more stuff about the use of vaccines in soldiers during the war, since you and Papa both mentioned being given a whole bunch of shots before you were shipped out on your assignments. And then‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ there's just so much interesting stuff out there about how they used to treat common illnesses and injuries that was just totally, like,
"Are you trying to say that the Mets aren't used to playing in October weather 'cause they're wimps, or just 'cause they suck?" he finally asked.
But he couldn't. As much as he hated to admit it, Tony's plan was the only way he could think of to rid the universe of Thanos for good.
It was those very same reasons that had prevented Steve from ever asking Sarah anything specific about Howard Stark, not wanting to dredge up more painful memories. But after his rather earth-shattering conversation with Colonel Phillips, Steve had felt that he could no longer just keep sweeping his unpleasant questions under the rug. It was long past the time for him to get some decent answers.
"Ah, I'm pretty sure that there's not supposed to be this much talking during a fight, Steven!" Hammer shouted from his perch two stories up. "I didn't just sink over half of my fortune into this prototype for you to just lie around and let him beat you to a pulp! I mean, if you keep on refusing to fight, I suppose that we could just go and grab that kid of yours to do the job for me, so I guess it's really up to you."
Tony flinched as the dull whine of Steve's aircraft engine suddenly rose in volume and pitch. Less than a second later his aircraft began shooting down the runway, taking off roughly three seconds later as Tony checked his data pad, mentally counting down the time before the space-faring engine ignited.
And, like a fool, Tony allowed it. He allowed them to hold the promise of granting Peter his life-saving surgery over his head like a dangling carrot because he had no other choice. There were no other options for Peter, no more drugs or therapies to try that would extend his life more than a few months.
"Ultron?" Peter whispered, narrowing his eyes at the odd-looking command. "What're you up to‚Ä¶?" He tapped in a few more commands, trying to decipher what this Ultron's base code was, but all he could find was that single line.
But Tony only shook his head, his brown eyes glaring bullets that hit Steve square in his heart, ripping it to shreds. "No. You're nothing but a liar," he said, low and tight. "An imposter who killed my husband and tried to take his place. Well, I'm not falling for it anymore, so you can just take your HYDRA ass and get the hell outta here, 'cause you're not getting anywhere near me or my son, you got that?"
And if so, why couldn't it be used to help a boy like Peter? Surely if it had been able to fix Steve's severe lung disease it could also work to fix Peter's heart, couldn't it?
With a series of nods and high-fives, the team dispersed, making their way to their aircraft as Steve slipped his arms around Tony's waist and pulled him into a tight hug.
‚ÄúAll Steve‚Äôs fault,‚Äù Tony says, the corners of his eyes crinkling ever-so-slightly as they flick towards Steve.¬† ‚ÄúKid wasn't half as stubborn ‚Äòfore he met you, so‚Äî‚Äù
And while Steve couldn‚Äôt understand why in the world Tony would think he would need space from him, according to Peter, Tony hadn't ever had a relationship that had lasted longer than a couple of months.¬† Even his relationship with Peter‚Äôs mother had been something of a whirlwind, ending almost as soon as it began when Tony discovered that she had been sent by a rival company to try and spy on him.¬† Steve had then spent the next thirty or so minutes‚Äîand two huge Dr Pepper floats‚Äîassuring Peter that he had no intention of ever leaving either of them, but understood that while Tony loved him, it was one of Tony‚Äôs self-preservation methods to always assume that his romantic partner would end up leaving him.
"First satellite is away!" Steve exclaimed as he sailed past it. "And it looks like it's working just fine!"
"Um‚Ä¶ I'd say about half? Maybe three-quarters?" Bucky finally admitted. "But I did mean it, Stevie, I promise. I just wanna see you happy. That whole I'm-never-gonna-fall-in-love thing just doesn't suit you. You're just too‚Ä¶ good to not be shared with someone."
"Yeah, well, she's gonna be leaving soon," Peter said sadly. "We've only got another four weeks or so, and then‚Äî"
"Oh, yeah. Apparently he's being moved to some super-secret holding facility sometime in the next few days, somewhere that's only accessible by helicopter or something, based on what my dad says. And he's still refusing to talk, so, whatever he was involved in is probably a lot bigger than people first thought."
"Oh, yeah," Steve said, rather sheepishly. "Just thought I'd see how Peter was doing. You know, since you said he's probably gonna be here awhile."
‚ÄúJanuary 30th, 2019,‚Äù Steve interrupted.¬† ‚ÄúA total of two hundred Stark Industries rifles are shipped to the Sokovian insurgents via a secret courier.¬† January 31st, 2019.¬† Fifteen hundred explodable bullets are shipped from Hammer Industries to the exact same address.¬† February 3rd, 2019.¬† A communique from General West to a Sokovian insurgent leader stating that a Special Forces team‚Äî
"–°—Ç–∏–≤! Look!" Bucky exclaimed, pointing the tip of his rifle at the sky. Steve's jaw dropped as the wormhole, which had continued to bleed Chitauri the entire time they'd been standing there, suddenly closed in on itself, the loud

"He's not exactly in a coma," Dr Cho said, and Steve nearly collapsed in relief. "But he's not exactly just asleep either. I've actually never seen readings like this in anyone else‚Ä¶" She paused, giving her head a slight shake. "Peter's brain wave patterns are alternating between two and four Hz, which is consistent with deep sleep in a child, but there are occasional dips down to zero, which is below the frequency for the delta waves usually seen during the deepest stages of sleep." She pointed to the computer printout, marking the various peaks with her pen. "Now, these dips do seem to follow a similar pattern to the EEGs I took shortly before Peter regained consciousness down in Miami, so whatever happened to him tonight doesn't appear to be as severe a blow, but‚Äî"
"It's all right, babe," Tony had told him after they'd crawled into bed the previous night. "There's going to be plenty of other competitions and dances that Pete'll go to that you'll be able to see."
Steve's heart was pounding like a drum as he cut the engines of his aircraft, tearing off his helmet and sliding the cockpit open before it had even come to a complete stop.
Steve huffed in frustration. He could remember the exact location of the Soul Stone like he'd seen it just yesterday, but he knew he couldn't admit it. His knowledge would no doubt lead to questions that he couldn't answer out of risk of distracting the team, and while he wasn't completely positive, he had to assume that Thanos wasn't yet aware of its location either, and the last thing he wanted was to give it away.
"Not sure I can take the best part," Tony muttered, his fingers curling into the sheets as Steve licked him again. "
"Unless they knew the exact design of the aircraft," Peter finished. He sucked in a deep, rattly breath, begging his bum heart to stay calm. The last thing anyone needed now was for his stupid monitors to start going bonkers again. "Which would be impossible, unless‚Äî"
"Cut out the damn chatter, Syler!" barked Colonel O'Brien. "Rogers, I've just been informed that all enemy aircraft have been pulled from Langaran airspace and we're not picking anything up on our radars either, so as far as we know there shouldn't be anything that's anywhere near the power plant. Are you absolutely sure that you're seeing what you're seeing?"
Tony sighed.¬† Steve did have a point.¬† While Tony used to leave Peter behind semi-regularly when he travelled on business, ever since his decidedly
He had managed to hold onto his control just long enough to avoid breaking down in front of everyone else.
"No, Pete, you really don't," Tony stated. "And I don't want to hear another word about it, okay? Don't you be listening to anything Grandpa says about that stuff 'cause none of it's true."
"Okay, so... dare I ask how your run went this morning?" Sam asked, pausing mid-chew as Steve sat down with his loaded breakfast tray.
"Here you are, Mr Stark," stated the burly military officer as he pulled to a stop in front of a small three-bedroom house, lit only by the pale light of the moonbeams streaking through the clouds. Tony scowled as he gathered up his pile of books and notes and pulled his handlamp from his jacket pocket, trying not to think about just how many credits the military was wasting by escorting him home when he could've just as easily driven himself.
‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Steve screamed as his entire field of vision narrowed to only those three books, and the explosion he knew was imminent.¬† Because that sound, that hateful, terrible sound of a single sniper shot, was always followed by an explosion, which meant that Steve had only seconds to protect the two people he loved most in the world from being crushed.
"With my help, I believe that he can," Helen said. "Dr Wright has pioneered many new techniques during his twenty years of practice, and is the only orthopaedic surgeon that I would personally trust with the captain."
"There's only been some preliminary results from the investigative team so far," answered Uncle James. "But from what Colonel Phillips told me, it seems as though the beam specifically targeted the landing apparatus."
As long as they could pry it out of the government's sticky hands, of course. According to Grandpa, the government had in their possession more than enough of the stuff to not only power the individual satellites, but also create a big enough containment vessel for the main power source that would‚Äîhopefully‚Äîbe strong enough to prevent anyone from tampering with it.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôll let me know if you need anything else, won‚Äôt you?‚Äù Tony murmured as he pressed a kiss between Steve‚Äôs shoulder blades.¬† ‚Äú‚ÄòCause if there‚Äôs something more I could be doing, then‚Äî‚Äù
And not a single one of them had accomplished a damn thing. It wasn't until Peter was born that Tony finally managed to get his act together.
"I can only imagine, Captain," said the chairman. "And I thank both you and Mr Stark for your cooperation, that concludes this hearing."
"Yes, well, we're all aware of the depth of your genius, Mr Stark, so I'm confident that you can come up with something more suitable to our needs," Senator Davis said, giving Tony a slimy smile that turned his stomach. "But for now I believe that is all, and thank you for your time."
expected to find himself watching as he and the rest of the team fought in the Battle of Wakanda, the very battle that had ended with Thanos snapping his fingers.
"As you wish, sir," answered JARVIS. "However, as I have already stated, all pre-flight checks on the three space-faring aircraft have come back clear." There was a short pause as he completed the ordered check. "Pre-flight check complete. As of this moment the mission is a go."
The only question was, how?¬† He couldn't remain where he was, that was obvious.¬† He couldn't radio for help either.¬† Rumlow had reminded Steve multiple times before he was dropped that the secrecy of the mission depended on Steve maintaining complete radio silence until he was safely inside the bunker.
Which meant that Peter had to go way back to the beginning of JARVIS's design and search through every single line of code for anything out of the ordinary.
Peter feared it would be the former, and the thought made him sad, even as he could understand Dad's point of view. The trial of Howard Stark had consumed Langara for over three years, during which he was kept locked away from his family and constantly vilified in both the official news and by the vast majority of Langara's citizens. Having no way for Grandpa to refute the stories being told about him, it's no wonder a young child would grow suspicious enough of an absent parent to end up hating them, especially since he and Grandpa hadn't exactly been all that close before he was arrested.
"Gotcha," whispered Tony. He tucked Steve's forehead against his neck and tipped his head back against the side of the tub, tears of anger and fear prickling his eyes.
He just wished so badly that it didn't have to be that way. That somehow all the demons would suddenly just get tired of tormenting him and his family, and up and leave.
And also of course, since Peter Edwin Stark was Tony‚Äôs son and therefore already a certified genius, Peter didn't buy his lame excuse for one single second.¬† Tony‚Äôs heart gave a hard lurch as Peter dropped his gaze back to his cereal, poking at the floating bits with his spoon.
"Yeah, except then, instead of learning from my goddamn mistakes, I let HYDRA come in and snatch you right out from under my nose! And then they came and snatched my husband right out from under my nose! And goddamnit, Pete, that is just unacceptable! It cannot ever happen again, do you understand me? Never again! So if my nanite suits, and‚Äîand figuring out these stupid particles can somehow keep me from getting blindsided again, then that's what I'm gonna do!"
"Uh huh." Peter's eyes swept across Tony's sleeping form and up to the screen lining the head of the table, which displayed Tony's vital signs. "Uncle Bucky and I are gonna play chess once I get back, and Shuri said she'd show me some of her stuff later too."
Steve took a quick sip of his water, his shoulders still perfectly straight. "My personal opinion, sir, is that I applaud anyone who is willing to stand up to bullies, which is what I perceive to be Spider-Man's mission. However, given the assumption that Spider-Man is quite young, I would recommend that he suspend any further superhero-like activities until he is much older, as I'm sure his parents would agree."

Tony thought with a frown. The first time he had caught Peter tampering with JARVIS had been when he was eight, when he reprogrammed his television curfew so he could watch movies late at night while he was supposed to be sleeping. And Tony had to admit that he had done it so well that it had taken him awhile to catch on, not thinking to investigate anything until Peter did a literal faceplant into his Lucky Charms one morning because he was so tired.
"I mean, not tonight!" Steve said through clenched teeth. He huffed out a sharp breath as he walked Tony into their bedroom, not giving him another opportunity to protest. "JARVIS, please soundproof the room."
‚ÄúDefinitely!‚Äù Steve squeaks, clutching his sides.¬† ‚ÄúWhich means we should probably get this over with as soon as possible!‚Äù
Yay, they finally got to meet!  And they both seem intrigued üòâ.  We‚Äôll get to hear from Steve again in the next chapter üòä.
"Yeah‚Ä¶ I kinda‚ÄîI kinda forgot about it, actually. It's been awhile since I've had a reaction like that, so‚Ä¶"
"No, shit," Steve heard Clint reply as the Wakandans in the front line activated their rectangular handheld shields. "Damn. That's pretty cold."
"Well, I suppose we'll just have to agree to disagree on that," Davis said, so smugly that Tony had to physically restrain himself from jumping over the table and punching the man. "However, I am also wondering what you can tell us about the assassin known as the Winter Soldier?"
Swiping the back of his hand across his cheeks, Peter sucked in a deep breath and forced himself to take a step towards the wizard, hoping his exhausted, confused mind would be able to function well enough to actually have a conversation.
Peter nodded, swallowing against the lump in his throat as they got into the car. "It's okay. I know your parents are gonna miss you too."
"Excellent. Don't want the birds drying out," said Sam. "That does mean that you and Wanda might wanna get going, Nat. Carving up six turkeys is gonna take up quite a bit of space."
Ned, of course, had bombarded Peter with questions from practically the very second he set foot inside the school, fuelled by a bunch of stupid conspiracy theories being passed around at his mother's book club. Peter had tried to answer a few of them as best as he could, but since he didn't really understand a lot of it himself, he'd ended up clamming up after a few minutes and just telling Ned that he'd been sworn to secrecy.
"What is it, honey?" Tony asked, his confused expression nearly tearing Steve's heart in two. "Is something wrong?"
Because they were about to embark on a mission that would not only change their entire world, it would also save their son's life.
"Yeah, that kid's had something like that coming for a long time. He's been a thorn in Pete's side ever since they were in kindergarten, and for some reason he's not all that scared of me," Tony said with a scowl. "When they were in fourth grade he even swiped one of Pete's inhalers once after their gym class, and then two days later Pete wound up in the hospital with pneumonia."
"Hmm, maybe because it's specifically designed to cushion my body during flight while at the same time not interfere with the armour?" Tony said, rather cheekily. "And maybe also because I happen to be aware of how much you might like it on me?"
"I'm just as real as you are, sweetheart," Steve answered. He kissed back up to Tony's mouth, his tongue splitting Tony's lips.
"Yes, I know that," said Grandma. "Like I said, I'm not proud of how I was. All I can say is at the time, I didn't know any other way to survive. I'd just lost my husband, with not even a body to bury, and then Steven was born only a couple weeks later. And then, only a couple of weeks after that, the government threatened to kick us out of the house if I didn't start paying rent. As an Air Corps pilot Joseph's living expenses were covered, but that all stopped as soon as he was killed."
"Okay‚Ä¶ so‚Ä¶" Bruce finally said, removing his glasses. "If I'm reading this right, you're trying to say that the final variable isn't necessary because we're treating the Quantum Realm as a tunnel instead of an actual endless space."
"Okay, for one, his name is Mr Stark to you, Doctor," Peter said firmly. "And two, I'm pretty sure we're all in agreement on that one, so it's not really worth repeating. My papa wanted the Time Stone brought to Wakanda, so that's where we should bring it."
And even though he was fairly secure, and that Georgia was a lot warmer than New York, he was still pretty damn cold even with his suit's built-in heater.
Steve grunted as he kissed him again, settling back on the bed with Tony on top of him and drawing his t-shirt up over his head.
Steve made a small noise in the back of his throat, thankfully only loud enough for Tony to hear. Both he and Rhodey had mentioned the possibility of the committee bringing up Bucky, and Tony had pretty much dismissed it, thinking that since the Winter Soldier had been presumed dead ever since the Project Insight mess that they wouldn't bother with it.
Would Steve have been as gung-ho to join the Army if his ma had still been alive when Pearl Harbour was bombed? He supposed there was no way to know for sure.
Much to Tony's annoyance, the ensuing hours somehow didn't see a need to go by any faster than before, almost taunting him with their complete lack of consideration for his patience and stress levels. Outside the base the days went by as they always did, with the nightly curfews still in place while forces loyal to Colonel Phillips stamped down the small remaining pockets of resistance. The base brig actually had a net decrease in occupants, as several of the people being held had been detained without charge simply out of suspicion, with General O'Brien and his immediate circle being housed together in one semi-large cell and guarded by no less than twenty men.
Peter gulped, squaring his shoulders as he nodded. At least he'd remembered to bring his earplugs with. "Yes, that's right," he said quietly. "And my other dad is Captain America."
A piece of popcorn landed square in the middle of Peter's forehead before he could reply, causing him to jump.
And with the final preparations for Project Phoenix on the line, being less stressed would only help matters.
"You think he tried to fight this thing on his own?" Steve asked, agast. He licked his lips as he glanced down at their unconscious son, his mind a whirl of conflicting emotions. "But‚Ä¶ Tony,
"Tony, it's okay," he sputtered, wishing like hell he could offer up some other comfort to his poor husband beyond mere words. "I'm okay."
He wonders if Phillips is watching.¬† And if he is, what he‚Äôs thinking.¬† With the angry words that Steve shouted at him during their last conversation, he wouldn't be surprised if Phillips wanted nothing more than to completely wash his hands of Steve.
"I am afraid that without a proper reference point I am unable to predict a length of time for Master Peter's survival, sir. I do apologise."
Sharon shook her head. "No. His grandfather was here for a bit this morning, but I haven't seen the father since the morning he came in. It's too bad, really. I know it's only been a couple of days, but Peter really misses him. From what he's told me, they're really close."
feel the immediate urge to punch him in the face only proved that Steve's innate hatred for the Stark family wasn't really hatred at all.
"Uhh‚Ä¶" Beck paused to search through his notes, although to Tony it almost appeared as though he was feigning not knowing the answer.
Steve inhaled a deep, shaky breath, pressing another kiss to Peter's head as he tried to purge the murky thoughts from his mind. He and Tony's second wedding anniversary had been a few days ago, and as long as Peter's experiment went okay they were planning on going out for a nice dinner the following weekend, some new place that had been supposedly booked up for weeks, but still managed to find a table when Tony Stark called for a reservation.
that might possibly help. Say he was sorry for not staying on the stupid bus, sorry for not going home when Dad tried to send him. Sorry for thinking he could actually be an Avenger when he was still "just a kid".
Tony almost cheered when Davis's shoulders sagged at Steve's statement, made even better when Chairman Oklahoma‚ÄîTony really ought to have learned his name by now‚Äîshot Davis a glowering look.
Rogers' smile grew impossibly wider, his blush creeping all the way up to his perfect ears. "Great," he said. "I'll‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ I guess I'll see you then. Thank you, Mr Stark. Or can I call you Anthony?"
Tony cleared his throat, momentarily panicking. Was he supposed to shake her hand? Was he supposed to kiss it? Maybe he should've asked these kinds of questions
"He does, buddy. And I'm hoping I'll be able to bring him by here soon and introduce him to you. He says he's really looking forward to meeting you, and he's even told me that he likes to draw."
"Tony!" Steve choked out as he clung to his beloved, finally allowing his tears to flow. "Tony, what‚Äîwhat
‚ÄúThen I say we flush the goddamn rodent out from his little underground rodent tunnel and get the hell outta this popsicle stand,‚Äù Clint says as he comes up next to Thor, fiddling with one of his arrows.¬† ‚Äú‚ÄòSpecially since it‚Äôs cold enough here to make actual popsicles.‚Äù
"Dad and the rest of the team should be on their way," Peter whispered after they had taken a tentative step. "So‚Äî"
Because he highly doubted that his dreams would be anything close to sweet until HYDRA was completely dead and buried, and it was high time that he stopped being so stinking afraid, and started doing more to help.
