But then there was Tony, rushing into Thanos, ramming into his side without the repulsor power. Thanos tried to brush him off but Tony pushed, pulled at his gauntlet, clung to it with the desperation that had always made him stronger than those who could beat him.
“Sounds like a job you should be doing.”
"We've got 2 minutes," Steve said as he marched forward, tossing Tony a plasma blaster as he moved without turning around. He checked to see that the thing had no safety and no biometric coding either, which would have been less relieving any other time but for now he followed Steve as they made their way towards the centre sphere they had found on the map. Steve walked steady but not too fast that Tony couldn't keep up, eyes trained forward and to his left as Tony kept watch to the left and an ear for any attack from the back. It was blissful to be silent as they walked but there was a tightness to Steve's shoulder whenever Tony's gaze skipped over him, coiled alertness that wasn't overtly on display even when they were on the field. His right arm was still broken so it might have been that but Tony had seen him shake worse breaks sooner, and it didn't help that Steve was specifically being slow in leading the way.
“Yeah, okay,” Steve walked out to the porch talking on the phone and raised a brow at Bucky when he waved, “I’ll arrange for it, don’t worry. Yeah, I’ll call her in a while. Bye.”
“We’re going to go meet someone I trust and get us some resources,” Steve explained, shooting Tony a dry look, “After that we’re going to come up with an actual plan to survive another day.”
“By absorbing me into them,” Tony nodded at the horror that must have shown on Steve’s face, “Yeah, believe me, it was disorienting. My essence was split into the integral components that made up the stones and I was basically brought down to five parts that were safe in them. I couldn’t make sense of it till you landed in Morag.”
They were looking for a specific connection to the concept, he calculated and dragged the seat nearby to find a place on the second screen. With the new context colouring the entire message, he went about working with Potts to pull up any new information that could help them.
"Yeah," Steve pulled his jacket over, the one they had got from their first shopping trip together, turning away to pick up his shoes, "I'll be in DC for a while."
"I'm alive, thank you for asking," Tony looked at the tense face of his best friend and saw the moment Rhodey caught sight of Steve behind him, "We're all fine. But if you got Carol and Thor to come to destroy Kang's base a bit, nobody's complaining."
“What’s that?” Tony sounded closer and Steve looked over his shoulder to see him leaning against the counter, left hand in his pocket.
It was a quiet reprieve from worrying about his own tales and Steve read theirs today.
There was a beat where silence didn’t demand answers because Tony had time to give, for thoughts and tomorrows. It hadn’t always been a promise and wasn’t won easy for them. Through all the late and early years of conversations they had lived, this beat was earned in tokens. It was good. It was theirs.
“He’s with Morgan at my parents’ place,” she had one hand resting on the table and Steve didn’t want to see it, didn’t want to see the final evidence but he moved further, “I dropped her off with them before Stephen brought us all to the battle.”
They reached their destination sooner than expected and Bernie looked completely unimpressed even as Sam crowed the victory as though he had driven himself. Steve pretended to miss the target of his high five and lightly pushed the boy’s forehead away from himself, messing up his hair well enough.
Natasha bit back the words, choking down the name she wouldn’t utter since they had first got news and the pressure scraped down Steve’s skin.
The same couldn't be said for the man sitting beside him as they seemed to work.
“Howard threw his baby at me,” Steve said, looking at the door to check if there was any threat before glancing down at the little girl who was now staring at Tony, “You find that interesting? You understand what he’s writing?”
“Yes I can, Captain Ameri-”
“Nothing,” Steve dunked the plate in the water again and picked up the other one, “I’m just trying something new this time.”
This time Tony wasn't hesitant in pursuing what was worth reaching out for.
The water ran down the white marble for a minute before Tony’s fingers released his hand and nudged him ahead. It wasn’t a serious cut, his skin broken on the surface alone, but Steve let both his hands cup the water that washed through them. He let three rinses go through before ducking his head to splash water on his face. It wasn’t cold enough to be ice, was always moderated keeping that in mind, but something in Steve woke up with the hit of water against his eyes and he wasn’t sure if he really wanted to be back completely.
“I’d be mildly worried if I didn’t understand the context,” Tony spread his arms apart and shrugged, “Still me, 2023. The last thing you saw me do was pull a cheap trick and say a cheesy line.”
Steve watched Bucky leave and exhaled before pulling out his phone to call Pepper. They still had a funeral to plan and he wanted to make sure it went well.
"He does love his
"I'm here now," Steve repeated and Tony believed.
His object of attention straightened from the hunched up gathering of scribbled notes soaking up dew from the cooling air. There was a curve of release as the posture bent in tension and regrouped, making Tony’s lips curve in their own calm.
Steve looked at him, a searching note in his gaze before his face softened and his arms relaxed at his side.
"I've been kissed before," Steve said quietly, clear words wrapped in muted memories, a history page dotted with faded ink, "Haven't done the kissing first. From my side."
"We both need to sleep," Tony raised a brow when Steve dropped himself to rest his face over his folded arms, "You're hanging half off the bed, scooch up."
Everybody else had taken care to nap when needed, even Clint despite his edge, but the three in front of Steve had been desperately determined. Bruce was nervous about the whole thing and he dealt with it by quadruple checking everything. Natasha was a menace when she dug her heels into a project, more so than Steve, and she was determined to keep working alongside Bruce. And then there was Tony, burning through the construction and restructuring of the portal needed for the time travel to work, not to mention the complete rework of all the suits. He was running high on adrenaline ultimately leading to crashing into a much needed sleep.
"Nothing," Maria didn't tap her fingers, didn't clench her jaw, didn't let the mess show. She was the last one standing in a room, the last pin to fall, and she was good at her job. She'd never had doubts about it.
He startled when the holoscreen in front of him flashed and cursed low at the image coming through.
“Tony,” Steve cut through Tony’s spiral and took a breath before holding his gaze firmly, “What are you talking about?”
“I think I’m drowning,” he stopped the fifteenth recording when his voice devolved into more cracks than sound.
“We broke the fucking world,” Tony swore against his shoulder and Steve shut his eyes, swallowing hard as he did the only thing he hadn’t been good at doing in the past. He held on.
“Steve, hate to break it you but being a little selfish isn’t always wrong,” she pointed out and gestured towards his bike, “It might even help keep you sane after some points of time. It’s what is keeping me sane, I’ll tell you that.”
He listened for Steve to contradict the subtle message, to tell that he'd be back by the next week.
“Do you want me to call Happy?”
He had heard the sound first, a whip-crack of thunder hitting an unbreachable wall of magic. The resonance of the aftermath had been a silent ripple of still fear, and Rhodey had turned to see Thor first. In all the years he had known the man, he had exuded all the traits they had read about gods, but in that instant - in one flash of terrifying realization, Rhodey had seen something human. Thor had been staring straight at the target he had sent his power towards and Rhodey didn't have to look to know what had happened.
“She’s fine,” Steve assured Maria when he caught sight of her looking around, the golf club still clutched in her hands, “She’s with –”
“Remember how I told you that the stones are sentient?” Tony waited till Steve nodded before continuing, “Right. When you use them to do something, change the course of life in any magnitude, you have to have a will strong enough to match your desire. Something to prove your worth, in a way, if that makes sense. When you’re reversing the effect of the stones themselves, it’s lesser. Like Bruce’s Snap, that was him releasing a blocked passage of life. Putting things back to how they had been running before the stones were forced to take away something that wasn’t meant to stop existing. It’s why they didn’t ‘die’ when Thanos snapped. There was no blood or evidence. It was like they stopped existing, displaced from the plane of their lives. Bruce didn’t have to force them to change the course of life. He had to control their powers to crack the lock, to pull back into the line. That’s why it was a test of his control.”
Thor had the blade pressed to his chest, stuck against a rock with Thanos crouching over him when Steve got to his feet and looked over at the weapon thrown aside. It hadn’t worked once, had seemed it would but it hadn’t. It needed proof, etched deep into the soul of the person who could wield it.
The teenager made a face but his grin didn’t drop as he jammed the helmet over his head, swinging his legs behind Steve and patting his shoulders insistently.
Simple didn't mean soon and it was a fact that had followed Steve through ice, dust, and now to a quietly lit room where the time travel planning was supposed to happen. Rocket and Thor were in the kitchen, one draining the fridge dry while the other probably took apart the Keurig. Scott was somewhere deep in the basement with Clint and Rhodey, hopefully not getting pranked by the duo. Bruce had tried to keep up the work but - it had been 36 hours and Doctor Hulk was snoring into the wall as he sprawled on the floor.
“Did that work? Did that really just work?”
“Of all the things you could have done, why this,” Tony demanded, shaking the phone held in his hand, “Was it the aesthetic? Please tell me it was the aesthetic.”
"Why will it work with me?" Steve asked even as he glanced down at the lemon-sized device, looking up at Stephen when the man cleared his throat.
“Do you have something stronger to drop?”
“Yeah, she said she could use the help,” he focused on his task but couldn’t help but feel like he was a little wrong-footed.
“Already?” Steve blinked and Tony eyed him for a beat before looking at the entrance of the bathroom.
Tony quirked his lips at Steve and he knew, he knew what the man was going to say even before he opened his mouth.
His lips curved into a smile even before wakefulness fully entered his consciousness and Tony felt the dip in the bed at his back.
” Libby’s light emitted from a slit between the chip and the audio had interference, “
“It’s chalky”
"Wherever you'd choose," Kang replied and Steve's hackles rose at the casually dismissive tone that he'd heard from enough dictators, "I'm no slave to boundaries of land or space, Captain. My home is one with the flow of time, and you are privileged to witness it now. Come, I've waited for your arrival long enough."
He would write every emotion over and over again if Steve was looking for it, and he let him read. He knew how precious it was, to
“Do we have a plan?” he could count the beats under the other man’s wrist, clear to his touch, and crouched behind Tony as they looked over at the source of the footsteps from their hiding spot. Air force, blonde, commanding air around them, faded boots, badge hanging from the neck – thankfully they were walking away from the car.
“It’s not a tracker, I don’t need that,” Tony cracked the chip and grinned up at Steve, the first honest smile he had seen since he had met him again, “I’ve got Libby.”
“Yeah, me too,” Tony agreed and welcome fingers interlocked into his orbit like always.
He also remembered every other time Tony had shared a fond look, despite this, despite having heard it all. And that – huh.
He was dreaming again and the star was here, so close, so near. All he had to do was let it fall onto him, let himself break its fall. He would do anything to stop it from being what he had become once to the ocean.
Steve leaned against the wall and let himself take a minute to watch Tony listen intently to the explanations involving her superpowers being great memory and getting Jarvis to make cherry pies whenever she wanted. He had come home with a thousand possibilities in his head Tony being alone in his brooding, an impromptu trip that would bring no explanations when the man finally came back, or even coming home to silence that would last a few days.
"You need to get us to the- ow, fuck – base," Potts said even as Tony knew that Steve had begun inspecting the wound.
Steve walked between Tony and Thor, watching Thanos for any clues of his plan. He wasn’t known for subtlety so this attack had been his equivalent of knocking on the front door. But, if he was the distraction, who was the courier? Who was chasing the gauntlet?
There wasn’t any real reason to panic, the doctors had taken pains to reassure him that endlessly. Extremis had done its job again and Tony was healing, albeit at a slower pace than he usually did.
Steve fell into step as Tony turned to leave the control room and it had been weeks, probably months since they marched to the same tune and in the same line. They had fallen out of sync, friction in every motion of their meetings, but right now they were a well-tuned machine. It was a mnemonic partnership and neither needed to sound out where their feet would fall as they stalked through the dimmed corridor that led to the cellar they had escaped.
"You okay?" Steve asked and Tony considered him for a minute. The last time they had stood in the same spot, Steve had been leaving for his Washington meeting and he had come back to Tony's mess with Reed's council idea with his own troubled mind. It had probably ended better than it could have, Kang had spoken about it, about words and timelines where one of them dies or kills the other or destroys the entire world with their unsaid words.
“Is there a reason you called me, Pepper?” he asked instead of replying and leaned across the table to pick up his charger, “I’m busy.”
“I’ve learned things,” Steve hummed under his breath as he went back to gazing at his chosen sight of the night, “Besides, we’re fulfilling one requirement for that.”
“You ready?” Tony asked when Steve opened his door in the morning, still too early for the mission. He looked fresh; the dark jacket zipped up over a full sleeved t-shirt and face devoid of sunglasses. He had trimmed his beard, Steve noted, and it somehow made him want to smile seeing the enthusiasm that had been wary to come.
Tony looked over and it clicked. Of course.
He brought a closed fist up and rested his chin on it, content in the simplicity of then, and watched the orange fin of a dish's border disappear under the dirty water.
"Why is he chasing you?" Reed frowned but Tony could sense the unease from his constant tapping of fingers against his knee.
“A girl,” Pepper replied, grounding and unfazed, like this wasn’t something that she had excluded as a reaction. Maybe Steve really was spiraling if people he hadn’t spoken to in months could anticipate it.
Tony felt the crackle in his ear and felt his breath leave easier on the next exhale.
“I have lightning”
“Did you ever think that there would come a day,” Tony’s voice came through the comm and Steve ducked out of a cop’s sight, “when you’d actually be glad that Loki had a slightly creepy obsession with you?”
What didn’t fit into the nice section of Steve’s brain were the new entrants on the piano.
The sunlight falling over the woods behind them and the mud scuffed onto Bruce’s shoes made no indication that Thor had been right by the looks of it but –
"How could I not?" Steve shook his head honestly and laughed when Tony raised an eyebrow, "It was one of the first things I learnt about you. SHIELD made sure that your birthday video of 2010 was on top of your profile material when I got your file, you know."
“He would want it to come back to you,” Steve offered and she smiled, twisting the ring around her right hand’s finger.
"N-O," Tony tapped on the console's side and chanced a fleeting glance Potts' way before getting back to work. He may not know the man in depth but he knew pain, knew the irregular rhythm of it flashing in jerky movements, and Potts wasn't nearly as superhuman as he wanted to convince them Extremis made him. Tony had personal connections with the virus, an accidental affair that had probably been the unaddressed beginning of his miscommunication with Steve, and he knew that Potts was overselling his own fitness. He'd prefer that they didn't send back a dead man to the man's husband but they needed to get out of the current trap if that was to start.
The reactor faded this time and Steve kept waiting. He waited when Pepper kissed Tony’s still cheek, waited as Peter failed at hiding his sobs, waited till Rhodey walked forward to place a hand on Pepper’s shoulder.
Steve shot him a look that promised that they would discuss these unknown plans later but opened the envelope, reaching in to pull a folded piece of paper out.
"I have the Cube, get us out of here now," Steve's voice came clearer and Tony bit back a relieved sigh, "I'm almost there to the launch area, 30 seconds ETA."
"I saw the flowers," Steve commented as they ducked out the gate fairly easily, "He seemed excited."
“Then let’s keep it that way,” the God of thunder declared, “Let us kill him properly this time.”
“Oh, come on –”
threw up after that," he answered and this time Tony shook his head on a chuckle, "But I'm guessing Steve wasn't drunk off his mind."
The landing was shaky but Steve kept his breakfast down and looked around to catalogue the others. Scott, Bruce, Tony – they were fine. The noise of battle alerted him to his surroundings and Steve caught sight of the road ahead of them, littered with glass and debris, crushed metal that once resembled car parts. He took a second to catch his breath and then the Hulk made an appearance, ending the second immediately.
That night Steve dreamt of foxes chasing hounds in the stars, a knight calling out to them with a bow of cherry wood in her hand.
Tony eyed him for a minute, gradually calming down as they both fell silent and Steve could feel exhaustion sweep through him in a post-battle remembrance.
Was it wrong? Tony wasn't so sure about that.
“Here,” Pepper nodded in the direction of the house and shook her head vaguely, “I don’t know when I’ll be coming back. Not – not for a few days maybe. And I’d feel better if it wasn’t empty either.”
"Really?"
“That’s only six,” Tony said once Steve had arranged the blocks and looked up with something more than the bluff he was pulling. He was fond and that’s all that mattered.
She had witnessed it once before, when the media flaying had exceeded a line and it had been - a mess. The only reason that had been contained was the man who had been lying on a bed now.
“You’re kidding me,” Bruce said deadpanned but Natasha tied her hair up in a knot and pointed at Steve.
He didn't. It wasn't for everyone.
"We need to get that from him before he uses it to alter reality or reverse time," Potts continued, speaking over Strange without a look back, "But the only way we can do that is by getting to his place before he comes to collect us from ours."
He was planning on any alternate strategy they could use when his steps skittered to a halt at the sight that greeted him.
“Okay,” Bucky agreed without pushing it further but Steve could read him better than anyone and he knew that his friend was simply letting him off the hook, “Banner said that you’ve volunteered to return the stones once they’re ready?”
“Your phone”
They didn’t talk about the first time around, the first funeral when Tony had stood in place of Natasha. There was no space to mourn a past when the present had been shaken.
Steve had lived enough, two different lifetimes, to know that he was ignoring how it was always possible. They made monsters out of men to hide the demons that come with humanity, there were always ‘not all’ and ‘unnatural’ guarding judgements. So they looked to the skies, to their neighbours and the aliens, to anybody who wasn’t them, wasn’t their own faults in the line.
“Did I?” Tony blinked innocently, face breaking into a hint of a smile, “Doesn’t matter, I’m here now.”
He could hear Peter’s voice and he was just a kid, he was just a damn kid and now he was watching something that would change him for life. Steve could hear him begging, trying to get Tony to react, but all he could think of was that there was too much grey. Tony was always in colour, wasn’t he, always reds and gold and whiskey brown. He was vivid, the light that soared beside a comet’s tail and still shone brighter. There was always a streak of crimson too bright on his canvas when Steve attempted to paint his team and it was always bold. In your face, demanding a vulnerability that you had locked away carefully, Tony was always meeting you head-on.
“You know, on my way here, I saw a dolphin over the bridge”
"I think I can't stop lying," he said, a buried fear wriggling out of his throat as he stared at the other side of the bed, empty and cold in a familiarity deep within him, "I keep getting better at it and everyone seems to believe me. Sometimes I believe myself too. It's getting difficult to not, nowadays."
"The – get – now"
"Not as bad as looking in the mirror?" the guy asked, straightening up with a raised brow at the gauntlet facing him, "I really don't think you want to kill yourself, Tony. And I don't have time to die right now, so how about we put the posturing off for later."
Steve followed Tony around to the front of the car and watched him peer into the driver’s seat before grinning wildly at Steve.
“Are you going to tell me tonight or is this a mind-reading game?”
“Steve, I’m not asking you to sleep in his bedroom,” Pepper took a breath and Steve waited as she continued with a tired tone, “I don’t know I said that –”
“It’s open,” Steve said as he looked up from his bed, putting his file on his lap when Tony came in with a small eyeroll, “You were the one who knocked.”
The wind played darts with his face and he heard the honk from the honey brown truck matching his pace. He could probably pull ahead again and ignore it for a few more minutes.
“See you tomorrow,” Steve replied and had a thought clearer than the mess already rolling in his head, “Pepper?”
He eyed the expanse of the open grounds before him and considered going back inside, persuading his feet to move again, when he first heard it. Speed.
"They're here," Rhodey informed, moving to let Natasha come from his side.
“Wow,” Nat commented and Steve dragged his gaze to her from the photo, reading the wistfulness and hurt and tired hope warring over her face as she took the whole image in.
“So you got me a gift,” Steve commented, eyeing the envelope when Tony nodded, “I didn’t get you a gift.”
He had stayed there, under their lost Tower, for longer than anybody waited outside their homes. When he was finally turning to leave, his eyes had caught a flash of a seemingly familiar brunet walking into the Tower and Steve had rushed in without thought. All he had considered was that he was finally seeing someone he hadn't known he could miss so much and his feet had hurried over the marble floors of the building.
“We still have two hours before starting?” Steve asked and Tony shrugged a shoulder, “Okay, let’s get some coffee.”
He closed the message after making the image his wallpaper, a hint of hesitant hope, and opened the unknown number’s message. The words sped fast and Steve let out a tired chuckle by the end of it.
Which was of course when his luck ended and he heard Tony on the comm, halfway through announcing that they had got the Tesseract before a familiar roar came through and Steve heard Tony’s groan.
"You're leaving?" he asked without looking up from the files he was signing. The September Foundation was still a fledgeling and he insisted that he had to focus more energy towards it, even if Pepper was the official name on top. It probably was a matter of worry that his partner hadn't pursued the line or asked if they could adjust their schedules to make more time despite it.
“What?”
“No,” Tasha started to shake her head before stilling, freezing awkwardly as she remembered that her hairdresser wasn’t done yet, “Not blueberries.”
"You better catch me," Potts said even as he was moving, his voice getting fainter. Catching an 80-year-old version of himself should have worried him more but Tony didn't have time to think about it as he started the jet with an intention of dragging hell into this godforsaken place.
Strange didn't wait for Steve to get off the jet and met him at the base of the ramp, a cracked but bright blue orb in hand.
"It seems to be coming from Ms Romanoff's quarters," the AI responded, a note of hesitation creeping in before she continued, "Scans indicate that it is – you, Tony."
"I've got mine for now," he replied and hit the button for the hatch to close. He heard Strange comment about Steve's alternate self but it wasn't clear and the door shut to leave him alone.
“I thought we’d follow the order this time,” Tony suggested and Steve nodded like it made sense, because maybe it did. Maybe all the insanity they had lived through had some sense to it that was finally unfurling into this moment.
It was all they had, and all of them right at an arm’s distance.
“Just because it’s one dead-end doesn’t mean it’s the end.”
When they came up to the door, they found it open and Steve stopped two feet in. Carol shot him a glance before moving forward, walking towards the source of the noise inside. Steve let her go and took a minute, his head throbbing as he looked at the home. Rescue’s mask was thrown on the floor beside the couch, ripped off in a hurry. There was a fireplace in front of the couch, dark shelves above it to hold photographs.
It had taken him three hours to remove the stain from the ceiling the last time.
“Not a big ugly building,” Tony quipped as he looked away from the place to eye Steve, his borrowed sunglasses slipping down the bridge of nose till Steve could see his eyes.
Steve clenched his hands on his hips and watched as Bruce tried one last time, Nat killing the power on command.
He watched the Titan crumble, flesh and bone evaporating into the air, and Steve had five years of regret melt with it.
"And gave you a heart attack in 2012 but you seem fine now, so it all worked out," the man waved a dismissive gesture but his lips quirked up in mild satisfaction.
“Get it off! Get it off of him!”
“I’m the Cherry Knight,” Steve heard one day when he had returned from a two day trip to Vancouver. The voice was recognizable easily now, having heard stories and complaints and questions endlessly over the four years they had known the little blue-eyed firecracker.
He wasn’t keen on following anyone until it came to falling in love. Then the tune changed.
Steve shot him a mildly incredulous look and pointedly looked around them before meeting Tony’s eyes again.
The fact that his husband had thrown him out of the ward didn’t make any bit of difference.
"It's not something -"
Tony screamed onscreen but there was a blinding light that made Steve close his eyes for a second before he tried to make out his husband's form again.
“That’s fine,” he answered, whisper soft in the dark of the room, “Somebody’s got to represent the little guys.”
He really did plan to go, he’d say later. He would have at some point.
It had to work, Steve decided and dragged himself to it, a hand closing around the handle with all the surety he had in him. He didn’t care about proving himself to anyone, not anymore, not in a long time now but he wouldn’t let his friends die again. He wouldn’t let them battle without having their backs protected.
"Finding him," Potts responded distractedly, shooting Tony a fleeting glance when he came to stand beside the man, "You named your AI after Pepper?"
There was no response but Steve felt Tony's peaceful exhale over his shirt and even the layer of clothing wasn't enough to mask the warmth. His heart in his throat, Steve hesitated another minute before he felt Tony's nose rubbing into his shirt and he had to swallow a knot of emotions. Slowly, feeling like a thief of some unknown luck, Steve lowered his hand onto Tony's arm and swallowed hard again when he felt the relaxation in the awkward embrace he had become part of.
“Me?” Tony didn’t mean to sound incredulous, especially with the distracting scent of the man eyeing him curiously, "You - you do know what you just did, right? You can see
They came together in increments, the idea of a new team in a new time. There were days when Steve would turn back expecting Falcon’s wings or Clint’s arrows flying through the air. Tony didn’t choose red for his suit and the black and gold variant was done intentionally to try and have a new beginning. It took them bad days and quiet days, memories of the old merging with the new. It took them time and effort but Steve saw it coming together.
, Tony remembered observing one noon a few moons ago as they had walked around Mauna Kea because they - well, they could. Imagination was a funny thing when you were souls with infinite time.
Caring was simple and brown-wrapped and habitual; the puddles stepped into on a drying road just because you knew that it was a quiet thrill. It was vulnerable and for Tony's blue heart to rest against his own flesh covered strength was a hushed revelation of a new level of that. Steve didn't know if Tony realized that, if the man with an armour for every situation knew what this meant.
He couldn’t touch Tony and the man softened, edges withdrawing their defense and eyes lining with recognized kindness. Tony reached out and squeezed Steve’s shoulder, firm and warm and alive.
He could hear Steve gathering the weapons from the bots they had disarmed but didn't turn to check, eyes flying over the flashing digits. Kang was a right bastard but his security was intricate, gossamer threads of intelligence that would have seduced Tony's AIs on a bad day, and if he didn't suspect that the guy wasn't taking credit for the work of other minds then he might have been impressed, to say the least. He almost began missing Scott when he finally cracked the last wall and slapped the pad sharply as he got to his feet.
“See you in a minute,” Steve quipped with an amused glance before the flash of light swallowed them back out of the timeline.
And then he had come back to his room for a breakdown.
"Good luck," Tony whispered, and neither of them questioned why it was a whisper or why it wasn't something more suited to the space between those who loved. Take care, he didn't say. See you soon, it wasn't.
He leaned to switch the night lamp on and turned to see Tony better, noting that he was still in the clothes he had worn when he had left to meet Maria in the morning.
There wasn’t much he could do for a lot of things but he could do this. He could protest and plan, coordinate what somebody else had started.
They were fighting for their lives and nobody was ready to give up.
“Sorry, force of habit,” he explained, remembering the last session with the group, “I’ve been telling people how we need to work towards a future and how we can move on. But it’s hard to forget a small fact.”
“So, we’re leaving?”
It was a new start and that was the best thing that time could give them.
"And the company?" he asked just to see Steve turn around, which he did. Steve's face softened a bit more at the question and Tony could write theories, could build equations around the expressions that face built around every emotion. The tilt of a disapproving nose, the curve of a fond laugh line, the slope of a surprised brow - he could explain everything.
A pinprick brought up the drop of blood needed to activate his recognition for the orb and Steve held onto the handles of the steering as he felt the device activate.
"Is it that
A chuckle escaped his lips and he switched gears, the gloves gliding over the handles as he slowed down to come parallel enough. He nodded at the driver who rolled her eyes but tilted her head in agreement.
“I’m glad, Steve,” she said it like she meant it, “Listen, I was hoping to sort some things out at the Brooklyn centre. Are you working tomorrow? I’d like to meet, if possible.”
They were almost there, almost to the van when Thanos destroyed it with one blow, his blade cutting through it before Carol could get there.
“We wanna do something futuristic?” he looked at Scott, “We talk to the futurist.”
Steve didn’t answer but there were some moments that didn’t need an agreement and they stood there in silence till Hope came with the car.
Steve looked over at Natasha and Bruce but neither of them budged an inch from their slumber, Nat now turning over onto her stomach thanks to the extra space. Making a decision, Steve rearranged Tony's askew limbs as best as he could before scooping him up, intending to put him on a bed in one of the nearest rooms. Sleeping in a chair wouldn't help his back and Tony never woke up well if he slept on a floor. Steve remembered that from the Tower all those years ago and swallowed the lump of memories threatening to spill over.
“He called,” Tony rubbing a hand over his mouth, “He wanted to announce that he was a father, finally. It was a successful delivery late last night, at around 11.40 p.m.”
Tony, pouring him half of her own coffee and quietly slipping into the shadows when Tony invariably came down to find him. She had watched over him as they had gotten married, eyes sharp beneath the tears as her boys had promised what they had always done.
Steve dropped to the ground hard when his throat was released and he could hear Thor come for Thanos with a snarl, could see Tony get pushed off with a purple hand.
There was a sound of someone entering on the other side of the office and Steve looked through the blinds with his heart pounding.
“Do you trust me?” Tony asked, every word sharp around his tongue and Steve caught the panic, the desperate nerves mixing with fierce determination. This was Tony at his most basic form, the core of all the upgrades that happened with time. This was the man who had jumped after a god of thunder the first time Steve had met him. And this was the man he had chosen to save the world with.
Even as he thought it, Steve knew that he was making excuses. Scott was here, living proof of something getting past Thanos’ plan, something that had worked without him calculating for it. And the idea of Tony not knowing what to do with this theory, or not having the power to make it come true was an abysmal one. If there was anybody who could do this, do it right and in the scale they needed, it would be Tony Stark.
"Tony, it's –"
Ten minutes and about twelve years of trauma unloaded to his unfortunate counterpart later, Steve finally landed in their rendezvous spot to see Tony and Scott sitting in a stolen car. As Scott began inching dangerously close to a complete breakdown, Steve was ready to pull the plug on the mission when Tony got out of the car with an unholy glint in his eye and Steve knew that he was about to be dragged into the craziest plan possible.
They had to get the gauntlet to Scott’s van and Steve saw Rhodey clear a line of Thanos’ army, Rocket shoot through the guts of three aliens at once as Drax handled those at his back. Tony and Pepper were at each other’s back for an instant, protecting each other as they burned through the closest circle of fighters. Wanda was awash in red and Bucky covered her, gunning down stragglers even as M’Baku caved the skulls in to his right.
“What do you need?” the words were soft in the hard silence of the room but Pepper looked up, blinking through the tears finding their way down her face, “Pepper, what do you need right now?”
If he comes back any less alive, I'm going to burn this whole place down, he decided and made himself move for his own part of the mission.
“It wasn’t worth it,” he exhaled and it felt calm, an admittance out in the open, “It wasn’t worth it, Tony.”
And then Tony was there, catching the sword with both hands, feet digging into the ground as he held it back. The blade was strong, made to cut through metal with ease and it was going to tear him apart, going to get through the armour to flesh and bone but Tony looked wild as he pulled.
“I know, but -,” Pepper held his gaze and found the right words in her head, “I don’t want you to be alone either.”
"Intruder alert", P.E.P.P.E.R warned a second before the armour protocol came into effect and Tony flexed his palm as he pulled at his watch to form the gauntlet. It would take 17 seconds for the rest of the suit to assemble after the half-completed overhaul from the previous night but till then he had enough power to stand against whatever had breached the security.
“Yeah, I – I have company,” there was background noise of other people and Steve thought he heard someone familiar, “It’s – one minute.”
“At Vormir,” Steve continued, head resting on an arm as he stared up at the ceiling, “I thought I could do something, I don’t know what, but maybe see her one last time. Skull said it worked once before.”
Detroit gave him a last touch of warmth in a cup of coffee at the DIA’s café and then Steve was off again, catching the wind.
someone you didn't think you could love enough and he wanted to share that with this man, these eyes that were seeking what Tony had found. This was making space for a bit more than yesterday, a touch more than love, and Tony wanted Steve to know that it was amazing. It felt amazing.
. What's so complicated about nothing?"
love me."
“You think it’ll be enough?” Steve asked as he shook hands with Bernie, eyes slipping to the car and back. They had left the city behind but Flint still lingered in his mind, just as every city he seemed to touch.
Just as planned, Steve was walking into the lab exactly 70 seconds later and felt a moment of pride for his spy work. Natasha always teased him about being too obvious at it but he had managed things quite well so far. He spared a thought for Tony and pushed it away, reassuring himself that the man would be able to sneak or distract his way out of a situation if need sprang up. He had done it with Fury before. This shouldn't be worse.
He was in Waverly, fresh bunch of Iowa Rose in hand and eyes downcast over the porch of an abandoned home, when he got the first proper message from Natasha.
Steve felt his face ease into a softer expression when he watched Tony hug his father from a distance. They had spoken very less of it and not very well when they
Steve considered making a comment about titanium alloys and vibranium but figured that the tiny satisfied hum he heard was better to focus on. His palms had touched the familiarity of this man before, cupped gently over elbows and shoulders, clasped nicked fingers with fingerless gloves with the surety of his own body heat. He had skirted along the edges of
It was getting on his nerves now and if nothing else,
When he finally reached the base, Steve parked his bike in his old spot and took the basement elevator. It was quiet when he reached the ground floor, doors opening to the corridor closest to the briefing room. He was walking up to it when he heard the sound and recognized Carol’s voice before Rocket’s voice echoed a reply.
"Walking in through the front door sounds nice," Potts clicked his tongue as the map switched, shifting his weight onto his left foot, "You coming?"
“Where would you hide a particularly dangerous experiment in an extremely confidential base?” Tony tried to covertly glance around but Steve’s eyes caught the entrance of the barracks and -
“He will when I tell him that Hulk almost killed me in my own elevator,” Tony shot Steve a flash of a grin before turning back to the car they had jacked, “You know, I’m not so sure Hank Pym will. Did you know that he has some sort of a grudge against me? Or maybe my dad, more accurately, but the legacy continues apparently.”
“Like I said,” Steve said quietly, wiping the coffee stain with a soft hand, “We need to move on.”
One more push, one last arm's length and he could save the star. He had to save it, unlike what had happened to him when he had fallen, a long time ago. He needed this star to shine again.
“Is Rhodey okay?” he asked once he could be sure that his voice wouldn’t fall apart on him, meeting Tony’s eyes in the mirror. He had last seen Rhodey when the man had walked out to clear his head, Rocket and Nebula following him. He wouldn’t look at Clint, not after the flicker of sympathy that had passed through the archer’s face when Rhodey had realized that his last words to Nat were done. That there wouldn’t be any next time, not anymore.
“I thought we caught them all?” Steve sighed as Tony ignored the question in favour of letting Chopin fill the silence, fingers speeding up to the fascination of the kittens.
"And you've never seen them before?" one of them asked the woman who looked sharp as she matched their pace.
try just because you don’t trust yourself, Steve!”
“Among other things, yeah,” Steve admitted, taking a quick look of Tony’s more put together appearance, “What are you doing here?”
“We can’t
“In the Hudson,” Nat sounded skeptical but Steve nodded, “If this is your way of telling me that I should look on the bright side, I might – hit you with a peanut butter sandwich.”
, he didn’t say but Bucky shot him a knowing look. They talked about Bucky’s plans for the future and Steve was pleasantly surprised to hear that he was willing to go through a legal route to clear his name.
There was nothing. No burst of power.
"Don't you need comms?" Strange called out but Steve shook his head even as he turned around.
Nebula was staring at Bruce with a blank face, something like confusion flitting through her face before she looked down. Steve categorized that as fine for now and moved on. Rocket looked disgruntled but had the Aether trapped in his device, still in one piece. Thor had tear stains down his cheeks but his eyes held an inkling of hope in them now and – well, Mjölnir was definitely going to be helpful, yes.
An hour of half-spoken sentences and mass-ordered take-out later, Steve met Tony’s eyes over the rec room’s sofa and it was easy to offer a grin as he stuffed the last pizza slice.
They were getting outnumbered and overpowered but they kept fighting, trying to keep the fighting contained to where they could control it.
“Morgan,” Pepper’s voice held a note of fondness, “Her name is Morgan. Have a good dinner, Steve. See you tomorrow.”
, right?"
Steve nodded and Tony raised his fist, a band of wires coiled around his fingers, an imitation of his repulsor watch.
He heard the lights click and the door closed but didn't turn to look at his husband as he came to bed.
Steve stared at him in the dark, still able to make out the outline of his form and turned around on the bed to face Tony.
"A bear nation"
"Thanks," Potts took the bottle from him when he offered, eyeing it for a second before downing it and letting out a relieved exhale, looking up at Tony with a nonchalant expression, "Sorry, running from a time conqueror gets you a bit parched."
"You get the jet from the dock," Steve turned left, without pause and didn't look behind him, "I'll get the cube."
“When?” he asked instead and the panic in his heart was mixed with hope, a foolish hope that Tony didn’t look betrayed or annoyed.
"I've had that complex for years now, you can handle it for an hour," he declared smoothly, the jet's sensors catching the location of Steve's incoming, "I've got eyes on you, coming in hot."
“Go?” Tony eyed the entrance of the alley and looked back at Steve, “Go where? You could use the time coordinator from here.”
Wait. It
"I'll take the juice," the man sounded amused and Tony looked over his shoulder to see him eye the place with a fond look before meeting Tony's eyes, "You can call me Doctor Potts."
“Here to do your laundry?” she asked and Steve made a show of rolling his eyes, wondering when the joke would let up.
“I’ve been thinking,” Tony began, gesturing at both of them, “We’re obviously trained and we gel well with both Ant-Man and Wasp. The fight today might have taken longer and gotten messier if we hadn’t helped out. Well, you helped out and I did most of the important work. Still, the point is, we’re capable of being more than just helpers to the existing heroes.”
engaged.”
A fast couple of weeks later, Steve had no real plan of what to do next but he was accompanying Bernie and her tag-along to Detroit, where they planned to diverge. Bernie had offered the choice of joining them till East Lansing, where she had to go later, but had let it be when Steve had evaded it.
“Hey, Cap”
Now as Steve blinked his eyes open, his eyes fell on the bedside table and he saw that the new batch of film sat there outside its pack.
“That seems to be a theme,” Tony ran a hand over his face but didn’t disagree, jamming the cushion behind his neck. They couldn’t sleep that night but stayed together on the couch, reading through files of cases long closed in a world they were both alienated from now.
Steve hadn't imagined looking at his own body lying dead before but this was enough to tell him that it wouldn't be a pleasant sight in reality.
do it again. Steve bit his lip as he carefully pulled himself free from Tony's hold and climbed off the bed, feet stable even as his head hurt with the unlocked secrets. He shot Tony one last look, one more memory of a false truth, before turning away to leave.
knew Nat kept, "Or apple juice? She'd have both, if I remember it right – what do I call you, mirror-me?"
“Right”
"Don't you always," Steve commented even as he ran faster, knowing that he'd make it, having made the jump a thousand times before.
It was an advantage to have already lived through this moment and they had planned their infiltration around the disadvantages only Tony and Steve knew. Bruce left for Sullivan Street, impersonating an angrier Hulk, and Scott shrank down to ride on Tony’s shoulder as they made their way to the Tower.
“Are you proposing? Because honey, I’ve got news for you about what fiancé is defined as,” Tony said and looked wary for a moment, “Unless you didn’t think that we were engaged and I’ve been misunderstanding your ‘yes’ from the last proposal -”
century.
but there had always been a hope to be more. Sex was invigorating and interesting, love was challenging and creative, and then there was this.
“What?”
The dream was his only reason for sleep now and Steve tried, every single time, to bring the star closer. To blink the snow out of his eyes and focus, keep his eyes trained on what he needed to catch. He tried to have safe hands for it rest.
"Uh, yeah you. Who else would I ask about the simulation readings?" Rhodey sounded confused but Tony breathed out.
"Home," he agreed and held out his own hand to meet Tony's. Home sounded warm enough.
“What could go wrong?” Steve laughed lightly, hefting the fresh shield in his hands and turned to address the Captain America who was staring at him with a worried expression, “I’ll be fine, son, don’t wear that look.”
He knew that Tony would help him get her back. He didn’t know what it would take to make Tony see that Steve would like more than just her back.
But Tony smiled, warmer than he would have in a safer but colder past. He smiled and Steve knew that the sentence would never find way into the open.
“Ask me later and I’ll let you know,” Howard laughed, the shock still fading from his voice but he took a breath before gazing at Tony, “For now, you still want to meet my baby girl?”
"Yeah, Kang isn't my husband's greatest fan," Potts shrugged as he took another sip, making an appreciative noise as he wiped at his lips, "Also, you should be calling your team in now. I don't have much time and I want to get this out before I'm dragged back in again."
Nudging Tony's knee with his foot, Steve swiftly slid out of the pants himself as the other man got to his feet and grimaced lightly at the dust on his knees. The suit Tony had taken for himself fit him perfectly, not the way a bespoke tailored one would but well-enough to avoid double-glances on their way in. Steve glanced behind Tony over his shoulder and shuffled his feet in the same spot as he calculated the ticking time.
“Is that an old message?”
“Stevens!” a voice called out from above and Steve looked to see Howard Stark leaning over the banister of the stairs, “Catch!”
“And then things spiraled?”
Potts hovered over him and muttered something in his ear, a constant stream of words too fast to catch on. He could hear bits of ‘realign', ‘paradox', and ‘same' but it didn't make sense till Tony's head came up.
“I’m putting in the maximum effort required for a forced participation,” Tony lifted a hand and drew the outline of Steve’s shape in the air, “It’s not my fault if you’re dragging me off to astronomical orgies for entertainment, Steven.”
"It's not what you think it is."
"I meant you," Tony corrected and this time he reached out, catching Steve's wrist lightly and bringing him to a halt right around the corner of the last corridor, "You're not gonna take on Kang alone, what's going on?"
"Well, it's good that he didn't reverse the serum then, isn't it?" he kept his eyes away and kept moving, trying to adjust his vision to the flickering bursts of light that he knew was energy waves, "Wouldn't want two civilians on the job."
“What happens to the world that came back?” he twisted on the couch and faced Steve, who blew on his forkful of spaghetti, “There’s going to be complete chaos, it’s been five years for some and a few seconds for the rest. How exactly are they going to cope?”
“Is this a new level of self-doubt?” Tony asked Steve but moved once he was sure that Steve had the older man, letting himself out to get them the clearing out of the area.
Tony stared and blinked, not giving away any emotion before he slowly stood up and faced Steve.
“You okay?” Steve asked quietly, glancing at Tony discreetly as they waited, “I don’t think throwing up will help our case.”
The battle raged around them and Steve chopped away with his broken shield, hearing the first photon blast ranging somewhere behind him before the women were running together. Through the crowd, carving a path for Carol to get through without being stopped, they worked in tandem.
“Yeah,” Tony exhaled, a muscle memory from a space when oxygen had been valuable. His hand brushed against Steve’s and there was no clarity of Venus’ arrival but this was enough. It was enough of love to pay her tribute and enough of understanding to let her reveal herself at her own pace.
“Tell me after we wake up,” he suggested, patting a soft rhythm against Tony’s skin as his eyes closed.
"Apparently she loves me 3000," Tony replied in a voice that went softer in remembered amusement, fondness ringing through his tone.
They gathered with a solemn sense of trepidation in the lab, and Steve’s eyes took in the new gauntlet they had created. It was based off Tony’s suit and it looked stronger, more purposeful than a bejeweled glove. It was the result of too many risks and all they had to do was snap.
"To them? Nothing," Kang replied, gesturing at the screen with a bored hand, "I'm simply letting time correct itself. Letting them fall where they should. Fixing them."
“What was that?”
“The idea of me was,” he replied and slowed down when Tony did too, “Anything?”
“Would you believe me if I told you I thought we could have still done it? Won, despite having broken apart?” Steve paced in front of the sofa on his fifth attempt, “Maybe I was foolish, maybe you had seen the future, but I still thought it. That’s why I let Vision come along for that damned stone extraction. I led him to his fucking death, but would you believe me if I said I thought it would be okay in the end?”
"Tony?" Steve whispered, a hand hovering over Tony's arm and eyes flitting over his face, "Hey, come on, you  - I should go."
"Ah," the crouched figure tilted his head up and stood from the bedside, slowly turning to look at Tony, "Well, that'll complicate things but hey, you're not the old one between us so that's a good point, right?"
“She’ll come back,” Steve heard Tony say in a quiet tone, looking up to see him eyeing Steve with a chagrined expression, “I’ll fix it once we get home.”
Tony had come back with Peggy at the end of that day looking fifty shades of overwhelmed but he had a new identity proof and a chance to find his footing.
Steve nodded and inhaled slowly, feeling the air line his lungs with an ever-present memory of battle-smoke.
“We’re not the same”
"I missed you," he repeated because they'd have moments for bigger words later. They would build them and many more, as many as they could want. For now, it was this. It was him and Steve and one more step.
Maybe he had always walked towards this understanding. Maybe all those moments in the past when the world was different from Tony, where things were always more – more intense, more personal, more victorious – maybe there had always been more of Steve devoted towards loving Tony than he had expected.
“All I get is sass but,” Tony reached into his hoodie’s pocket and brought out an envelope, “I got you a gift.”
“Can I exchange my brain for a new one?” Steve groaned and eyed the expression on Tony’s face as he sat in the dark grey suit that he had worn for the reception, “Did we win?”
Tony looked away from Steve to see Potts go through an entire spectrum of emotions before a mirthful grin began taking over his face.
“I’m trying to save myself too,” Steve said with an attempt at a smile and Tony didn’t say anything, looking at him with an analyzing stare before he broke the gaze, letting Steve get back to his dishes.
Steve could feel the gaze of the woman linger on him for a second too long and resisted the urge to turn his face in a much too obvious show of suspicion. Before she could look closer though, Tony took a step forward, blocking her view of Steve and protecting him for the time being. An alert announced the arrival of Tony's floor first and Steve flexed his right palm imperceptibly as Tony exited the elevator.
Steve breathed in Tony’s scent, the sheets warm under him and rubbed a hand over Tony’s stomach.
"I wanted to get tested," Steve commented and Tony shifted his head, brushing his lips over Steve's heart without intent, "For bugs. Or a virus."
“You want to stand by your choice? That’s fine. I’m making my own now,” he dusted his hands on his jacket and raised a brow at Tony’s expression, “You didn’t actually think that I was going to leave you here alone and go, did you? I told you, Tony, we do things together.”
Simulation readings. Of course.
Steve felt his throat tense, breath catch over his lungs and this was not the kind of hope he had woken up with today but God, it was more than he had come to expect over the years.
They had broken but they were still here, together in the view of a safe sky.
That night Natasha insisted on sleeping with both Steve and Tony, and they had dragged two mattresses to the living room after pushing the couch aside. There was a blanket the colour of a dark sky and Jan had gifted it to them the previous Christmas along with a set of blankets that had a celestial theme throughout it. The one Tony had brought with him that night had an intermesh of
"I borrowed it"
Tony had seen it in him what he feared he couldn't see himself. A liar.
“Doctor Potts,” Edwin Jarvis greeted politely before turning to address Steve, taking a moment before smoothing over his pause, “You must be Captain Stevens? Welcome, gentlemen. I am Edwin Jarvis, and Mr. Stark will be here soon. If you could please take a seat, make yourselves comfortable, I’ll send for some refreshments.”
Anniversaries and birthdays were always tough, especially today for the past four years. This time though, Steve had expected it to be more. This was the age Tony had last seen Morgan as and Steve had anticipated it to hit them hard. He had rushed through debrief before hurrying back, hoping that he could be there when the storm came.
"You okay?" he asked and Steve nodded wordlessly, eyes crinkling at the edges when Tony's hands came to hold him by the shoulders lightly. Tony watched as those eyes widened slightly, a deep wonder setting into them as Tony's hands travelled over Steve's shoulders up till he could frame Steve's jaw, thumbs slotted below ears.
“He liked building things,” Steve replied and Bucky nodded, silent for a minute before he regarded Steve again.
Howard had been a mess for almost a month after they had turned up unsuccessful and Steve had refused to pursue the line of thought since then. They didn’t know what had changed or gone another way but whatever it was, he wasn’t willing to endanger the life of those in the present for the possibility of a future he didn’t know anymore.
Pepper nodded, looking oddly relieved and Steve was okay with doing anything that could help her.
“I do,” he confirmed and knew that it was the right decision when Tony echoed that vow with the confidence only a long-awaited love could give.
He didn’t know when he moved from the kitchen to the living room but he was frantically looking for the flip phone by the time he realized he was doing it. His fingers hovered over the keypad, a new message opened, before Steve switched format.
When the others saw them come in, Steve laughed as both Tony and Bruce began yelling at the same time, compliments and complaints firing off at a long-lost familiarity. Natasha had to pull them apart to get in and grab Tony in a quick hug that left the man in momentary shock before he returned the gesture.
“Why you insist on spending your minimal break time mocking me, I’ll never understand,” Steve sighed and narrowed his eyes when Tony kicked his foot under the table, “We’re adults.”
“Why?” Steve asked but took the envelope when Tony began waving it. It was a bright red rectangle, the kind that came with greeting cards, and there was a single word written on it in gold ink –
She hadn't turned to look at Steve and later she would regret that second of cowardice. She had watched over him when he had gone out on his first date with Tony, straightening his coat lapels before sending her favourite boys off to start something new. She had watched over him when he had first realized that he
Steve went to bed with the pot unused and still on the unlit stove, an emptiness clashing with a hesitant fullness that came from unloading everything. The thirty messages remained in his drafts but the nightmares remained out of the night too.
“Hi” she called out without turning and Steve walked toward her, coming to stand beside her in silence.
Steve was jumping, hands open and ready even as he dodged the damaged bots stumbling into him. He got under comfortably and took the weight of his new arrival.
It had burned him constantly, an ever-present knowledge of what they had cost an entire kingdom. T’Challa had protected them, helped them again and again and the truth of what it had cost his people couldn’t be ignored. Okoye hadn’t blamed them, hadn’t demanded anything from them when both the heirs of T’Chaka had been taken by the Snap. Queen Ramonda hadn’t spoken to any of them, letting Okoye handle any communication, but Steve was perversely grateful for it.
Steve knew that Tony didn't want one. There wasn't much to warn him, not in this situation, and especially not with Potts being happily married. It was an oddity in some cosmic decision, the freedom given to one of his parallels; to be confident of where he was despite a building capriciousness, of how much he could ask without measuring what he could give. It wasn't always this way, the shocks that kept spasming in waves of an aftermath. There had been times when he had been able to absorb a jolt and stabilize himself, one foot braced back but the other sure upfront.
“If we play the age card, you will lose so badly, it won’t even be funny,” Tony said lightly and finally took pity to stand up, leaning over to help Steve sit up and fluff the pillows behind him.
“I won’t,” Steve promised and used the time GPS that hadn’t touched his wrist in decades.
Steve considered throwing a pillow and hard. He closed his eyes and exhaled slowly instead.
“I don’t, not really,” Potts shrugged, walking over to the nearest console, “It’s a modified version, leaning more into the biological aspects. I had one shot and it seemed right to use it back in the cell.”
“It was his personal map to get forward, to find the milestones that were important to him,” Tony explained and Steve’s eyes fell to the notepad, a picture forming in his head when Tony looked up to catch his gaze, “I’ve been thinking about it for a while now.”
It was untrained, unplanned, determined teamwork.
"I can't leave," she laughed with no hint of humour and her nails scraped her hairline as she raked fingers through her hair. The blonde wasn’t her shade, not the colour of her mood or manner, and Steve wondered how long it would be before they all became unrecognizable.
"Tones, I know that you
“That means he hasn’t got his hands on the gauntlet yet,” Steve surmised with a grim realization and beside him, Thor began rotating Mjölnir in one hand.
“Again, I’ll remind you of this,” Tony showed him the picture with amusement dancing in his eyes, “You also dyed your hair brown.”
"It's a code?" Steve moved forward, his fingers tightening on the strap of the scarred shield but Tony focused on the files being pulled up and it clicked.
The last time Tony had looked up to him, it had ended in a broken heart in more ways than he had thought possible. He wondered if Tony had forgotten. If that was possible despite forgiveness.
“Guys? I’ve got the Sceptre and am on my way,” he tried when Scott began cursing after a pause, steps speeding up, “Whatever it is, meet me at the back alley.”
He turned around and Falcon flew over, a portal opened behind him with crackling golden edges. When Steve looked down, another person came through the portal and the rush of relief was heady.
To Nat though, he was still Clint, and somewhere deep in him Steve understood that, memories of Bucky buried in Winter Soldier’s eyes still fresh in his mind. Steve knew what he would have given to try. What he
It had probably also helped that Rhodey and Nebula had returned too, Rhodey effortlessly fitting into conversations with Clint as Nebula followed Tony around with a remembered protectiveness.
“Why did –”
"You were the one who grabbed it," Steve reminded as he passed the set back to Tony with a sigh. The closet was fairly spacious but not enough for two grown men to strategize a heist operation while trying on stolen clothes. He considered their angle for a minute, Tony crouched against the other end and trying to pull Steve's pants up in vain. It was only a matter of time before one of them tripped or pushed the other and the heat really was making his back sweat.
“It’s the wedding bouquet,” Tony corrected and Steve looked at it again, “Apparently just catching it wasn’t enough and I had to take it with me too.”
“No, I -,” Pepper had her back to Steve and he could see her sitting beside the bed where they had placed Tony, “I’ll call him in a while. I need to talk to Morgan too – God.”
"So you stole a god's breakfast? For me?" Tony batted Steve's hand away when he dragged his hair down his forehead, "That's so much better. Almost worth waking up for."
The second thing she had done was the next morning, when she had stared at Tony across the newly arranged dining table before telling him to accompany her to work that day. Steve had been largely ignored.
"You have my permission to divorce this one," Potts informed Tony and Tony laughed.
The grounds of the facility were empty and Steve rested against the entrance’s pillar. His eyes fell to his shoes and Steve wanted to laugh at the memory of that morning, his nerves exhibiting in the extra effort he had put into polishing them. There was a close call during his shave and his breakfast had threatened to not settle.
There was a web of cracks on the mirror and a warm trickle down his knuckles when Steve came back to himself. Blue eyes stared back at a clenched jaw, deep cut cheekbones too pale, and his fingers came up in a trance to wipe at the mirror. There were tears on his reflection and now there was blood, fingerprints smudged down the fissures.
There were a lot of them, photographs framed in simple borders placed on the mantle. It was like someone had needed proof of every memory, stored to revisit happiness whenever doubt threatened.
"Because I threw up last night," he agreed. Tony nodded again and stayed silent, letting Steve see him, watching his eyes roam over Tony's face slowly.
He had sent a photo of his finished product three hours later and didn’t get a reply for two days. When he least expected it, he got a photo in return and Steve still had it saved in his phone along with the photos he got from Nat, Bruce when he had time, Rhodey from ridiculous mission moments.
“She’s losing power,” Tony commented but Steve leaned in.
“Jesus”
"Steve"
“Libby, what’s going on?”
“You’re nearing sixty,” Steve reminded and he was
Tony’s fingers were flying across the keyboards when Steve managed to reach the place and he didn’t pause even as he noted the new entry.
“Pepper?” Steve glanced at the phone in surprise and shook his head before continuing, “Hi, sorry, didn’t mean to sound so surprised. How are you?”
“We really did bring them all back, huh?” Tony leaned back and turned his head to look at Steve, a hint of awe in his voice.
He tilted his chin in a question when Tony’s eyes met his and nodded when the man confirmed that he had the Tesseract. He could wait, he knew that it was his first impulse, but the reality of what they had to get back to made him keep track of the time as Tony got through one more unexpected goodbye to his father.
“You’re talking about a time machine,” he surmised and Scott tried to retract that name but then acquiesced. Steve glanced at Nat but she had a thoughtful look on her face, raising a brow at Steve before assuring Scott that she had heard weirder things.
“Steve,” Tony called out and Steve looked over to see him crouched over an injured Doctor Potts.
Steve glanced up at Tony and he was regarding him with something resembling empathy.
"Why is it always you when I'm in my most embarrassing situations?" Tony demanded, speaking over Potts when the man started to say something, "I specifically told Reed to tell you
“A sleepover for the birthday girl,” Tony looked at an excited Natasha and smiled his best smile, “Sounds like a great idea, doesn’t it?”
Steve had known even then that it had been the man's desperate attempt to provide, to try and make this a home even when he didn't believe it would fully be accepted as one. It had been a slow realization but now -
“Jesus fuck how much do you hate me,” the audio recorded as he spoke into the phone, ears ringing in the silence, “How much did I make you hate me that you wouldn’t let me know
But Tony was the one who got to hold a tired Steve and feel the weight of his burdens settle into their bed. He was the knight to a soldier's weariness and he closed his arms around his husband's shoulders, palms stroking over his back.
He shook his head of the thought and pulled out the flip phone, a familiarity to it that felt like the balance of a shield on his arm. There was never a response to it, a whole diary of obscure thoughts and dangerous truths sent in this one-way street, and Steve had long understood that Tony didn’t have the phone on him. Not the counterpart to this one, and that was fine. They had other means to contact now and Steve wasn’t really sending messages to a void to get a response. It was just a part of his life, a new reality that he didn’t question much.
They could do this. They could bring their world back. And then –
There was a suspended moment in time when the three Avengers didn’t react, but Steve could see the other two get into position. Watching. Regrouping.
“You’d know all about that, wouldn’t you?!”
On a whim, Steve took a picture of the Canyon’s heights from his view and sent it to Nat. He didn’t check to see if there was a reply and pulled out a can of soup to heat over the fire, hearing it crackle as he waited. It wasn’t much of a meal but it was enough and Steve settled down, lying down on the unforgiving bed of rocks as he stared up at the unending sky. It was strange, to feel the distance separating them and knowing yourself to be as small as a speck to the universe, but Steve had seen it. The sight of a universe beyond Earth, speed doing nothing to blur the knowledge of entering an idea only vivid in dreams so far – Steve had experienced that on Benatar.
“Yes, but Tony had it,” she answered, voice quiet before she looked up at Steve, “Thank you, Steve.”
Pepper pulled Peter off Tony quietly and Steve could feel the heat behind his eyes as she shakily called out to Friday. She had always been the most resilient of them, the one who hadn’t needed to fight with fists and weapons to be a hero, and now she held herself together as the man she loved looked on.
He had set the pot and was about to wash some leeks when his phone rang, Nat’s tune echoing in the room. Steve looked at his leeks and down at his phone before hitting the call button, switching to speaker mode and continuing his work.
And then there was a future.
"You're enough to get the jet on your own, Tony."
“Good,” Tony sighed and brought up a hand to squeeze Steve’s fingers, “Hey, I never told you what Nat said. At Vormir.”
They had cracked but their world still stood, and they could still come for each other.
. Clint had years of training, was underrated as a combatant by those who hadn’t fought him personally, and was sharper than most. The first time Steve had met him, he had been a puppet against friends, doing things he hadn’t wanted to do.
options.”
"St-e"
Any moment now he would find the attention he was giving and it would blind him less than it had the first time. A little less starstruck. A little fixed starcross. A lot more stark truth.
“I’ve got to finish some things,” he answered and there were half-truths thrown around everywhere but Natasha exhaled, nodded once and eyed his book with a quirk of her lips before turning away.
Potts wiped at his mouth, took two steps back and made a running jump.
"Richards?" he heard an older voice and recognized it as Potts, moving to the nearest wall to get closer.
“Our baby,” she answered and Steve wasn’t sure if he was washing the carrot or scrubbing its skin clean. The water ran over orange, washing down the drain uncaring what it carried away.
“You mess with time,” Tony looked over his shoulder, “And it messes back. You’ll see.”
"Hm?"
“Catch any tips there?” Natasha wiped the sweat off her chin and looked over her shoulder, blonde hair sticking to her forehead and skull with sweat lending them a darker hue.
"Steve," Tony caught sight of the tired lines, the strained pull of grinding teeth and loosened his grip further on his wrist, a faint but softly grounding touch on Steve's pulse, "Hey, what's this?"
Tony and Pepper had a child. They’d pulled away from the world, from – he didn’t finish the thought but skipped over. A year ago Tony had stood in a hushed room, ripping out his heart and placing it still warm into Steve’s hand. A year ago Steve had flown into space, he had witnessed the death of their last hope before losing more friends alive than dead.
“I like the ones I’ve got,” Steve said, a funny musing note in his tone that Tony associated to the memories of before, of life. It had grown fonder over time, less hesitant and regretful as they had adapted.
And Tony. Right beside him, eyes sharp and suited up, filling in the gaps whenever Steve’s plans needed the check.
Well, shit.
“And who’s choice was that,” Tony waved his hand before clicking his tongue and holding out a hand, “I don’t need a network to get our way out, phone now. Please.”
He had nothing but himself and a broken shield with an army in front of him but Steve found the ground under his feet. His shield strap was loose and he pulled, gritting his teeth as it tightened on his arm.
Steve nodded and Bucky accepted it with ease, like he had expected this already. Maybe in some way he had. There weren’t many left to know the details of what needed to be done.
“You do know that I’m driving,” Steve kicked his stand off with a show of a put upon sigh, “Also, we’re not racing anyone. That’s reckless talk and –”
“I’m not sure that’s going to end well,” Tony muttered but stood up as Steve moved out of the booth, following him out of the place. They ended up walking through the streets in silence and Steve didn’t know where they’d end up but Tony was following him without protest. It was quiet between them, a cloud shading them from the upcoming storm.
“Do you have any communication with your team?” Steve asked, intruding on the conversation, and Potts turned to give him a tired shake of his head.
"It's my breakfast," Steve flicked a finger at Tony's forehead before cupping his cheek, "And I haven't gotten anything in return yet."
“At least it’s just me,” he rolled his eyes and considered a minute before moving back to the counter to get one more carrot. It wouldn’t hurt. “Are you at the facility?”
“Then you should go there now,” he answered, holding her gaze as he felt Rhodey’s eyes on him, “She’s smart, she’ll guess something is wrong too.”
"No but I've got a good eye for this," she replied, making Steve's stomach drop a little, "One of them had a strange beard. Like one of them hippies."
Tony had survived certain death before, Steve had seen it himself. He had touched a blacked out reactor and thought the end of him before Tony got back up. He had always come back.
Things weren’t awkward between them. Awkward was for situations like learning that your second best friend was secretly the son-in-law of the guy who was gunning for your entire team’s freedom. Tony was sure that Betty wouldn’t exactly
“We need some ID,” Steve looked down at himself and then at the shield still clutched in his hand, “And a change of clothes. Don’t think they’ll take a Captain America imposter story too well.”
“It’s Scott!” Bruce pointed at the infant.
“Hello to you too, Shellhead,” Steve looked up at the peeved noise and raised a brow at the frown directed down at him. There was an angry mark of too tight goggles across Tony’s temple but his frown wasn’t really angry. In the past five days since Tony had come to the facility, it was easy to read his moods. There was always a dark echo to his tone when they discussed Thanos and Titan, a thrum of vibrating excitement that came with less hesitation with every discussion they had about Morgan, dry judgemental glares when Steve ended up hijacking his call with Pepper that was always Pepper’s fault but nobody really minded. There was an awkward tension between Clint and Tony for the first day that Natasha had dragged the weary archer back home, and Steve hadn’t known how to approach it. But it had broken the next day, Tony being softer with him as he seemed to accept Clint’s change better than most of them could.
“Should do, you mean. Right?” she asked and her voice was sharp, knowing, a lawyer’s deduction, but her eyes softened at Steve’s silence and she shrugged, “Look, I can tell you a lot about privilege and influence but something tells me you’re good at learning on your own. That’s good, that’s what everybody needs. We all gotta fight.”
A holographic alert flashed between them and Steve caught Nat’s eyes, nodding at the interruption and she tapped the light signaling the message. The icon came to clarity and Steve noted that it was Rhodey’s, letting Nat get to it and focusing on getting a cloth to wipe the coffee that had spilt over on the counter during their conversation.
“You could have gone higher with the last side,” Steve quipped, getting to his feet with a smooth exhale, offering a half-shrug, “Too slow, Widow.”
When he had finally inhaled enough of the moment, filled his insides with enough of belief and insignificant seconds, Tony stood up and walked towards Steve. Reaching him, Tony let his head rest against the man's back, between the shoulders that had carried too many invisible burdens for long.
“You could see?” Steve forced himself to breathe at the picture that was being painted.
And then Maria got a call that required her to leave, her voice soft as she tried to explain it to Natasha. The picnic ended with less fanfare than it had begun and Steve felt bad as Natasha’s face looked withdrawn when Jarvis ushered them to leave.
The absence of his shield tore through his palm for a painful swallow and Steve was grasping for balance when the next hit came, the voice so familiar that he could reach out to touch it.
"An Irish voice?"
“Are you going to be okay?” Tony asked awkwardly, looking completely unsure of what to expect.
"He didn't forget you despite that," she laughed, and they could do this. They could watch their hidden words catch humour. "He carried that phone almost as long as he carried my damn ring, didn't he?"
The fortress seemed to have spotted the jet and Steve saw the jaw-clip part of the helmet open up.
Tony’s hand brushed Steve’s where it rested over Natasha’s middle and Steve sent him a small smile over their little guest’s head.  Tony’s eyes flickered down, and Steve saw him swallow, but then his hand rested more firmly atop Steve’s and that was enough. It was warmth cupped in found hands.
“- and not chalk it up to your terrible choices,” Tony continued unperturbed before pointing a finger at the photo on his phone, “Which surprisingly doesn’t include this.”
A whole lot of good that avoidance had done, Steve remembered in wry irony.
Tony didn’t say a word but his grin kept growing, engulfing his face with mirth that frankly, Steve thought, was disproportionate to his own annoyance.
