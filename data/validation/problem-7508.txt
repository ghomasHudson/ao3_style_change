They took the stage together; Tony spoke first, keeping his message short and to the point: they had a lot to celebrate here in New York, but there was still a long way to go, and he was honored to be a part of it.
“What did you run back for?” Steve asked then as they ascended to the genius’s penthouse.
“Oh my,” Steve said, his voice raspy as he pulsed his hips forward, eager for his boyfriend’s touches.
The super soldier quickly caught up to his friends, not wanting them to be concerned. But he looked at objects on display blankly, as his thoughts raced with the possibility of maybe finding his soulmate. Oh, how he still yearned for that day, if that day ever came anyways, when he found his other half. The one that balanced him and enhanced his strengths.
“Tony,” Steve breathed, his tone sounding needy.
“I can find my own apartment. Save your money on all of this. I’ll be sure to move out by the end of the week,” Steve remarked, starting for the door. He tried to brush past Tony, only for the man to block him, grabbing his hand.
Tony would keep it a secret for as long as he could, not wanting to admit his soulmark and who the universe deemed to be his soulmate.
“Should we have the rest of the team come too?” Steve asked, biting into the toast, crumbs falling onto that ridiculous plaid pajama shirt.
Steve was enraptured in his work, an undying need to capture their features perfectly. Everything needed to be precise. Steve was lost in his artistic design that he didn't look away from his drawing until his phone chirped. Steve checked his message to see Tony’s name there, and the blonde’s heart leapt. he read it and blushed at what the genius wrote.
Maria was there, in a navy sheath dress, a Stark tablet in hand and waiting for him. “Good morning, Maria,” Steve said, taking the tablet in hand. “Is everyone accounted for?” He asked, looking over the information as they walked toward the aircraft.
Tony pushed Steve’s legs up and over his shoulders, bending the man almost in half as he fucked him with fast thrusts. The noises Steve made were soft whimpers as Tony brushed against his prostate relentlessly. It was when Steve came the third time, chest heaving, nipples hard, hole tightened that Tony too climaxed hard, a cry escaping him as thick strands of come filled Steve up as he pulsed his hips into the man.
He rolled under the car and started changing the oil once more, careful not to make an even bigger mess of things. That would at least help the brunette out a little bit and help get Steve back in his good graces.
So on Christmas morning, Steve was already up and making hot chocolate as the team filed in, eyes heavy, their movements sluggish. Steve wished them a Merry Christmas and a good morning, handing each of them a mug of the warm comforting drink, topped with whipped cream. Everyone had arrived, save for Tony.
Thank you as always to my beta!
Steve never even realized he had lost balance, listing to the side, ready to topple off of Tony until the brunette gripped his sides, slowly and gently guiding Steve onto his side next to him. The super soldier didn’t,
“Well, I want you to be able to see what I see,” Tony remarked, slowly getting off of the man and pulling him up by the hands. “Let me show you what I mean.”
“Lavender,” Steve remarked then, meeting Tony’s big doe eyes.
“I guess so,” Tony replied. “We can have so much fun with that,” he added with a wink, and the blonde grinned at the prospect of what that could mean.
Steve knew what Tony was going to do, but nothing could prepare Steve for that scratching stimulation of the genius’s cropped beard deep inside the soft flesh of his rump. Clutching at the comforter, Steve squeezed his eyes shut, moaning lowly when he felt Tony lick around his rim.
The couple kissed languidly, their spent bodies tangled together amongst crumpled dirty sheets. Steve nuzzled into Tony’s neck, the brunette finally slipping his fingers free from his love as the ring of muscle relaxed. There was nothing to be said for a while, the brunette and blonde soaking in each other’s presence.
I want her long blonde hair, I want her magic touch
It was a merman.
Tony moved his way down Steve's body, kissing at his clavicle, his beard scratching at the super soldier's creamy skin. It made the flesh there sensitive, and Steve gasped lightly. Steve tugged at Tony's hair, who moaned at the slight pleasure pain of his soulmate's fingers.
Things between Steve and Tony come to a head when Steve ignores their strategy on a mission, putting his life in danger.
The blonde’s vision had briefly left him, his sight returning to see Tony standing, smiling proudly as he held Steve’s slumping frame up.
“I’ve got to go, but I’ll be back after the party’s over and we can finish this conversation,” Pepper remarked, brushing her curled hair back over her shoulder. With that, she turned and headed out their, (now his) bedroom door, her high heels clacking in the tile hallway.
“You gonna fuck me now,” Steve asked, thick and breathy as he kissed and suckled at Tony’s sweat laden neck. He knew how his dirty talk made Tony weak in the knees. And when he heard Tony moan, almost whine, he knew this time was no different. His boyfriend slid his heavy erection in the cleft of his ass, the thick head catching on his loosened rim. Clenching the fist in Tony’s hair, Steve pushed back, rubbing harder against Tony’s length. “Come on, Tony, I want you…feel so empty without you in me.” There was a low primitive growl behind him then, Tony finally unable to keep his composure. He grabbed Steve around the hips, digging his fingertips into the cut hollows of his hipbones. Lining his love’s wet and open entrance with his erection, Tony wrenched Steve back, slowly sheathing himself. Steve bit his lip as he felt the warm lube on Tony’s cock fill him with a heat that pulsed through him. It mixed with the pleasuring burn of the man stretching him further as he pushed his way completely in, testicles nudged against Steve’s bum. He felt Tony’s warm breath against his neck, and when Steve turned to look at his boyfriend, he could see the desire, the yearning in the man’s dark eyes.
“I think I’m falling for Steve,” he confessed with a sigh, before there was a spray of Rhodey’s soft drink in his face.
“I’ll be heading to Japan to meet with Stark expansion there tomorrow. I’ll drop by afterwards to go over everything and have you sign all the papers you don’t care about,” she said, her words attempting to be humorous. Pepper’s eyes betrayed her, though, as they watered once more.
“Yes. Colonel Rhodes is being honored tonight. Tony naturally is going there to support him.” The red head took a step back, nodding in approval, before she changed her mind and brushed Steve’s hair a little more towards the side, defining his part.
The team made their way back to Avengers Tower, taking the long way round so that they passed through the private outdoor training yard. Steve and Tony were the last to shuffle through, though Steve didn’t mind that one bit. He clung to every quiet moment he could when it was just him and the brunette.
“Fiiine,” Steve said, looking back at Tony with a grin, his pupils dilated. That look alone could have made Tony take Steve right then and there. But Tony had something else in mind for the super soldier. Pressing a kiss to the back of Steve’s neck, the brunette nosed his way down Steve’s spine, nipping at the muscles in his back before he got down on his knees once more, wiping the backs of Steve legs.
Natasha and Sam were in different areas when Steve noticed a shadow pass above him as he was swimming, only to realize it was a ship. The merman’s heart raced at the realization, remembering what happened to his best friend the last time a ship passed by. The vessel slowed overhead, an anchor dropping to the sea floor, catching on a small reef. Colorful fish scattered from the intrusive metal object that wedged itself within their home, pieces of coral and rock breaking from the anchor’s impact. Steve wondered if that ship was the same one that took Bucky and were coming back to capture more of his pod.
“Who was it? Did you tell her about your feelings?” Steve just shook his head, looking back down to his sketch, starting up his drawing once more.
“No, not at all,” he teased, threading his fingers through his boyfriend’s damp hair. “I loved it,” he said quietly then. “I am so glad you feel safe and comfortable around me. So much so that you revealed this aspect of your life.” He tilted Steve’s chin up so that the man would look at him. “You can always be yourself with me, Steve. I love everything about you.” He placed a gentle kiss on the blonde’s forehead, sitting up to slip Steve’s lingerie off of him. “Also, I wasn’t lying when I said I would buy the entire male lingerie inventory. You just say the word.” Tony held up the pretty garment that was in desperate need of being dry cleaned.
"So you're going to take care of it yourself. Is it my birthday? I've lost track of the date, but let's say this
Steve smiled. He flipped to a clean page in his sketchbook and started drawing Tony again--not in the simple, stylized way he'd been using in his sketches lately, but in a more realistic style. Tony, the way Steve saw his face every time he thought about him.
Steve stood near the bed, watching to see what Tony would do. Maybe he should try to turn him around and lead him back to his own quarters?
Steve hummed lightly to himself as he sat in his art studio in Brooklyn, working at his easel. He was practicing with his oil paints, dabbling in the wet on wet technique. The windows to the room were foggy as the cold air outside kissed the glass, the sky black save for a few pale grey wispy clouds.
“That maybe, but you are always so beautiful when you climax,” Steve offered, spreading his legs nice and wide for his love. “I love watching you come, Tony.” Hearing those words, and seeing Steve with his legs obscenely spread had Tony biting his lip, stifling a whine as his mind got ahead of himself.
“Oh, a break sounds fantastic,” Tony muttered against Steve’s mouth, wrapping his hands around Steve’s back to grab at his bum. “Mmmmm, a thong today?” Tony inquired then, pulling away just a fraction to catch Steve’s gaze. “You’re really spoiling me, aren’t you?” Steve just giggled sheepishly, nuzzling his cheek against Tony’s.
"Did you ever think--" Tony broke off, and Steve could picture him shaking his head in impatience with himself. "No, of course you didn't," he said. "I forget who I'm talking to here."
Now Tony's expression relaxed, sliding slowly into a smile. "More kissing. Actual kissing, not the stuff we did for the cameras."
“Just me,” Steve said again, as Tony settled down into a deeper sleep.
"How about you do that?" Tony dug out his wallet. He looked the three of them over and handed some cash to MJ. Not that he thought Peter or Ned would steal it. She was just the least likely of them to be the victim of some absurd run of improbably bad luck that would end up with Tony's money being eaten by a coyote. "We need more trash bags, I need a black Americano, Steve wants a flat white, no sugar, and get yourselves whatever you want."
"I was trying to avoid you," he repeated, carefully enunciating every word as clearly as he could.
There were shelves against most of the available wall space, all filled with baskets and wooden crates of supplies. The level of technology wasn't twenty-first century, maybe mid-twentieth? It was difficult to pinpoint.
Time for the truth, even if it was told in a misleading way. "I ended things between us because I realized that he and I--we didn't feel the same way about one another, and things were never going to work because of it."
And so there was Steve, in a perfectly-tailored tuxedo, making conversation with someone from the mayor's office.
He'd realized a week or so ago that he had Tony in mind when he drew them. He'd been envisioning some day in the future when they got Tony back, and he could sit Tony down and show him what the team had been up to while Tony was gone.
He started scrolling through the responses to the misleadingly-captioned picture. A lot of the responses were positive, to his surprise. He knew things had changed a lot since he went into the ice, but sometimes he still wasn't prepared for how much.
"We don't have any lube," Steve said. "There might be something out there, but--"
Steve did, and started moving inside Tony, slowly and carefully. This time, Tony was the one who reached up, wrapping his arms around Steve and digging his fingers into Steve's back.
Especially since technology and the future were so important to Tony, and Tony was so important to Steve.
It would make sense to assume this place had shut down for the winter, and unless this was a late-season storm, he and Steve were going to be here for a while.
But Steve did answer. "Tony," he said. "I didn't know if you'd want--"
"Hm? Oh, yeah, you might be right." He was definitely right. Steve didn't have anything to clean himself up with; he wiped his hand as best he could on his underwear and the inside hem of his shirt, but he didn't want to have to walk around like this for long.
He expected Tony to tease him about the elderly and early bedtimes, or maybe about Steve's habit of waking early to go for a run, but Tony must have been too tired. He simply let himself be led to Steve’s room. Steve handed him a shirt and a pair of shorts, and after staring at them for a moment, Tony shuffled groggily into the bathroom to change.
Finally, though, they were in the parking garage, and Steve gave into the urge to grab Tony's hand and pull him toward the elevators.
Tony shrugged. "Because you hate big flashy events. Because you didn't approve of how much I was drinking. Because you felt sorry for me. Am I wrong?"
the initiative no matter how awkward he felt, he said, "I like it enough that I can't keep my hand off myself."
The only thing that dropped was the sponge, back into the basket, when Steve finished his task and kissed him again. "Move over a little?" he said. "I think there's room for both of us if we squeeze in."
“Some people,” Steve replied, “might think it’s a little creepy that every time you crash after spending days in here, you sleepwalk straight to my bed. Not me, but some people.”
"So drunk that I honestly don't remember anything after sitting at that table in the corner and talking to you for a while. So I'm not exactly sure what I did or said, but I need you to understand--" whether or not it was true-- "that I say, and do, a lot of things when I'm drunk that I wouldn't even think about saying otherwise. So whatever it was, I'm sorry, I'm not planning on drinking that much again so there won't be a repeat, so can we forget this ever happened?"
"Yes, you would. You're as bad as the kids."
“Too bad,” Tony says, and Steve feels better, because there’s no comparison between the way Tony’s smiling at him and the practiced smile he’s been giving all night. “I was hoping you’d drag me off to remind me who I really wanted to go home with.”
A loud crash and frantic voices jarred Tony back to the present, and soon enough, the brunette was hurrying toward the ruckus on the stern of the ship.
Shortly into the speech, the woman explained how she knew Peggy since she was a baby, that the renowned co-founder of S.H.I.E.L.D was indeed her aunt. “Aunt Peggy would sometimes tuck me in at night and tell me a wild tale from the war,” this Sharon woman said, and parts of the crowd oohed and awed. Tony grimaced and looked to Steve who was smiling from ear to ear, laughing when Sharon described a more comical story Agent Carter had told her. Something about the men playing hot potato with one of the soldier’s favorite bowler hat. None of that mattered to Tony though; Steve had the hots for Peggy’s niece?! Tony wasn’t one to judge, but that just wasn’t right.
“What?” he asked, eyes wide yet blurry with sleep. “Of course I’m happy with you. I love you, Pep.” Tony really did love her, but even he couldn’t deny the hollowness in his words. Pepper just gave him a sad, close-mouthed smile, her blue eyes slightly watery.
Making his way back to the tower, Steve went straight to Tony’s penthouse, eager to see the man. He found the genius spreading the carry out containers on the table in the living room. The movie list on the TV already up and waiting for them to pic from.
Natasha was busying herself, obviously not wanting to be a part of whatever was happening between the two men suddenly. The pain in Steve's shoulder was searing, and the mark was obvious to see. Steve could swear that there was a rouge creeping up the genius's tawny skin. Tony turned on his heel then, ready to bolt it seemed only for him to stop.
"I'd like to think so," Bruce replied tentatively. "What's this about?"
Clicking the elevator, Tony was surprised that it didn’t open up for him right away. He waited a minute, opening up the crinkled file from Pepper that he had to fold up and stuff into a small compartment in his suit. He skimmed it, not absorbing any of the information. The elevator doors slid open finally, and Steve was standing on the other side.
Clearing his throat, Tony looked over to see Steve smiling sneakily at him, his blue eyes glowing beautifully with the reflection of the fire light in the hearth. The blonde simply winked at him before grabbing his cup of hot chocolate, bringing it to his lips and sipping it nonchalantly.
They breathed together, their chests heaving against one another before Tony broke the kiss, collapsing his head into the meat of Steve’s shoulder. Steve wrapped his arms around him, nestling his nose into the brunette’s wet hair, inhaling the scent of shampoo, sweat and testosterone. He never felt more loved then when he was with this wonderful man that he had the privilege to call his boyfriend.
Steve had managed to venture out into the city within the next few days. At first he was nervous, naturally and understandably so. But soon the super soldier’s nerves turned into curiosity, and Steve found himself exploring the twenty-first century in awe and wonder. there were things about the world that remained the same too. The culture of America, both good and bad; the diligence of a nation, technology and expansion. The prejudice of those different to what was socially, and culturally acceptable... sadly that had not changed since Steve went under the ice.
But when Steve went to take a step, he stopped. He saw the elevator open and Pepper enter into view. Steve’s heart sped up a bit. He couldn’t help but to get a bit envious each time he saw her, knowing how she got to be the one to captivate Tony’s heart and soul. He watched as Tony got up to meet her, both of them hugging, Pepper pressing a quick kiss to his lips. Steve’s gut twisted at the affection, wishing to kiss Tony like that, feeling how soft his lips were on Steve’s own. He knew he should leave and give the couple some privacy and leave the cleaning to Tony’s cleaning crew and head back to his quarters to spend another lonely night. But he knew his curiosity was loud, and he couldn’t help but to keep watching and wishing it was him in Pepper’s place.
Steve writhed under the ropes, trying to free himself when a man with a scar across his cheek wasted not a moment to spear Steve right in his side to maim him and his fierce actions. Steve yelled in pain, the wound crippling him as he nursed the bleeding laceration. The ropes were heavy, brushing his chest and arms raw as he weakly struggled to fend off the men on the ship, their weapons drawn.
“Yes. I was wondering if you had seen Tony around at all?” He asked, scratching the back of his head in a nervous gesture. Why was he nervous? Bruce wasn’t going to know Steve’s hidden feelings for Tony just by asking if he’d seen him. Steve quickly brought his hand down to his side, attempting to act casual.
“Uhn!” Steve cried, pushing his ass back against his love’s finger.
Stepping out of his pants then, Steve walked over to Tony, dropping down onto his lap. “Told ya you’d enjoy the view,” Steve breathed, his one hands slipping down to grasp his boyfriend’s groin, only to feel his hardening penis under his jeans. Tony gasped at the blonde’s unexpected touch. Steve grinned daringly, loving it when he could get his man to react in such a gorgeous way.
Tony decided this was a reasonable time to get himself out of the armor. At least he'd made that a lot more feasible to do on his own than it had been just a few versions before, and the undersuit was still completely dry. Everyone who'd left clothing in one of those lockers was a lot bulkier than Tony; he could wear the stuff if he needed to, but he'd look ridiculous in it. He'd rather not look ridiculous in front of Steve.
Steve's lips were a little chapped and a bit dry, and the kiss was soft and careful, which was not actually anything like any of the first kisses Tony had ever imagined with Steve. There was a lot of him being shoved against the wall and thoroughly kissed in those fantasies, but it didn't matter, because this also worked.
Tony smirked at him. "You'd have to try it and see."
"I absolutely would. In those exact words. 'Oh, poor Tony. How did he die?' 'He was cruelly murdered. Struck down in the prime of life by Captain Cocktease. You know, the guy with the great big… shield.'"
"I'm not mad at you now," Steve said. "But like I said, I'm in the middle of something, so could you get to the point?"
“I believe he is coming here,” JARVIS explained--unnecessarily, it turned out, because Steve’s door opened and Tony walked in.
Steve decided not to show him. He'd drawn Tony too often during the hours he spent in the lab, even though he'd also brought paperwork with him to keep himself occupied, and that wasn't a confession he felt like making.
Besides, Tony still went silent at odd times, or looked out of the window when the were in the car together instead of looking at Steve, and so Steve thought that he was having regrets about ever having agreed to this.
"Yeah, I think that's a solid enough set of parameters that I can code it in," he said. "When's our next team training?"
And a few that got straight to the point, along the lines of
Tony frowned. "Does he want to see me? Did he say why?"
Steve rummaged in one of the baskets and produced a paper-wrapped package. He tore it open and shrugged. "It looks like dried fruit."
"You mean it doesn't?"
Sam had let it slip out once that Steve had a subscription to
"It's going to be a recurring theme in the conversation," Tony pointed out. "My life is not exactly full of exciting events at the moment. Which is why I don't want you to apologize for calling me because you missed me," he went on. "What else do I have to do here? My entire life revolves around technology, and I'm in a dimension where any tech more complicated than a classical simple machine doesn't work. Talking to you might be the only thing that keeps me from losing my mind."
"If you do, I'm going to reprogram you as a karaoke machine."
Because there would be another time, he realized. There would be other times for this, and then when they brought Tony home--and Steve refused to even consider that they wouldn't be able to get him back in time--they'd be able to do this, and so much more, in person. They hadn't wasted the time they had. Steve hadn't lost Tony before he could say anything.
He couldn't remember them ever taking their time like this before. Steve was moving a little faster inside him now, but still not in a rush, and the friction of Steve's body pressed against his was enough to keep Tony aroused, but not in any hurry to come.
His bed was big enough for two people, but he thought Tony was going to be confused and embarrassed enough by waking up in Steve’s bed, without adding “waking up next to Steve” into the mix.
With JARVIS's help, Steve had no problem doing the paperwork online the way SHIELD preferred. He didn't like to, though, so he printed the forms, completed them by hand, and then let JARVIS digitize and upload the results. It was a compromise that worked for everyone: Steve got to work the way he preferred, and Director Fury got his paperwork the way he wanted it.
"Let me do most of the talking, then," Tony offered. "You're more of the strong, silent type anyway."
"We're never going to hear the end of this, you know."
And compared to what might be a lifetime trapped in a pocket dimension alone, Steve's fears of sounding stupid were nothing, so he said, "I don't need anything. I just missed you, that's all."
"You're going to have to wait for me to touch your cock," Tony said.
"I don't want to go see the polar bear," Steve said. "He's miserable and depressed, and it's grim."
This had nothing to do with any of Steve's personal feelings except the ones about being used as right-wing propaganda.
"I, uh. I want you inside me," Steve said, glad Tony wasn't here to see how red his face was. "But you're not here, so…"
His suit had night vision, of course, but he wanted to make sure he had as much power in reserve as possible, just in case they ran into more of those animals that had been their welcoming committee when they'd fallen through that portal from Times Square.
"You know," Tony said, "you were saying something about doing things your way next time. Something about a bed?"
"Just a second." Steve reached into his pants, pushing his underwear down to expose his cock, already half-hard.
He’d never be able to stand there and pretend that he enjoyed having the other man, whose breath probably smells of the three vodka martinis Steve has watched him down in the past hour, leaning in close to murmur something directly into his ear, but Tony seems to be managing.
Steve turns away, ready to move to the next little cluster of guests, but he still hears the moan of pleasure when the taste hits Tony’s tongue, and when he looks back in that direction, he’s seized with the urge to punch the leer off Tony’s companion’s face.
"If you can't do it, that's fine. Maybe it was a bad idea." Steve found himself smiling a little. Needling Tony a bit was the most reliable way to get him to rise to a challenge.
Steve could say he wasn't angry all he wanted to; he really needed to send his body language that memo if he wanted to be believable.
It was a fair question, but Steve didn't even try to answer it. He snaked a hand around Tony's hip instead, wrapping his fingers around Tony's cock and beginning to stroke it.
Steve decided he didn't want to read them yet.
"I just wanted you to know that I don't--knowing that you're still affected by what happened, it doesn't make me think any less of you."
In the morning, Tony was gone.
"Fine," Steve said, suspecting that if he could get Tony to lie down for a while, he'd fall asleep anyway. "Then we can go to plan B, which involves getting you into bed, getting most of your clothes off, and then seeing if I can literally kiss every inch of your skin."
“Thank you, Obie,” he murmured. He had his doubts, but Tony just wanted to trust his advisor. He already had so much to consider with their business proposal. Everything else could be set in the back of his mind for now.
"Hey," the brunette greeted, extending a hand. "Nick Fury sent me." Steve stared blankly at the other man, shaking his hand firmly.
Steve’s breath caught with each passing movement over his body, his entire being buzzing with Tony’s sweet knowing touch. “I could easily get lost in those touches of yours,” Steve sighed, looking at where Tony’s hand was on his sternum before flicking his gaze up to the other man’s face. The super soldier laid his hand over Tony’s, holding it there a minute, his heart thudding underneath.
"They were like dreams but...they are memories of past lives we lived, I do believe," Tony explained. Steve looked at him dumbfounded. "Some soulmates have a hormone that causes an enhanced amygdala which is the main part for emotions and memories in the brain," Tony added. An understanding enlightened Steve's face, remembering that article he had read when he first came out of the ice. "But, what you feel, that yearning, I have it for you too. I desire you. I
Tony hadn’t realized he had been holding his breath the entire time Steve spoke so lecherously to him. The genius licked his lips as his mind ran wild with visages of his blonde lover under him, moaning as Tony fucked him senseless beneath the moonlit sky.
"Yeah, I know," Tony said, his voice almost devoid of feeling.
“Yes, Captain” The A.I. greeted.
The couple stayed quiet, their hands caressing sweaty, flushed skin, breathing the same air as they smiled sleepily. Tony eventually slipped himself free from his boyfriend, and Steve let out a small whimper, his hole winking, wanting to have something to clench around. The blonde reached for Tony’s hand, guiding it to his entrance. It took the genius a moment to understand what Steve wanted until his finger slipped inside his wet opening and the super soldier sighed sweetly, his muscles quivering around the lithe digit. Tony continued to stroke inside his love, feeling Steve melt against his chest. Tony was the one to find his voice first, petting Steve’s hair then with his free hand. “I’m never going to get over seeing you this way, Steve,” he breathed, massaging the blonde’s stretched, glistening rim.
“She called it off because she believed my heart had already belonged to Steve.”
“Uh,” Steve said intelligently, his body becoming extremely warm, his shirt collar rather tight. Tony just laughed then, turning away to plop down on the bed.
“That sounds like a lot of energy,” Tony pouted.
Tony ate Steve’s ass with vigor, loving the man’s wonderfully explicit moans as he did so. He swirled his tongue along the textured flesh of the inside of Steve’s cheeks before lowering his lips to suckle on the blonde’s testicles. He drifted one of his hands to Steve’s opening, rubbing at it with the pad of a finger as he continued to mouth at his sac.
Steve waved a hand toward the debris on the floor. "You hadn't left the lab all day. I was bringing you a sandwich."
Steve felt bad for a moment. Tony had never said, but some of the arguments between him and Pepper that nobody had been able to help overhearing had made it clear that Tony wasn't handling the aftermath of the Chitauri invasion as well as he liked to make it seem.
Most people would have been had enough of Tony's constant talking after half an hour, at most, unless they wanted something from him. Steve hadn't seemed to mind, which did absolutely nothing to make Tony less ridiculously enamored of him.
"Because the world revolves around you," Steve said, laughing even though in this case, it wasn't just Tony's ego saying that. Steve's world--his personal, inner world, at least--did revolve around Tony, and he thought Tony knew that.
"Later is good," he agreed. "You're busy right now." Now he moved his hand away from Tony's cock--not far, just so that he could get Steve's pants open.
"I'm not sure I know how," he blurted out, and then closed his eyes, wishing he could take the words back.
"Of course it's good," Tony said. "Did you think I'd pick out a bad wine for us?" But his smile looked genuine, so Steve figured that he hadn't actually insulted Tony's taste.
"But maybe we all are," Steve finished. "I can't stand cold water, and to be honest, I'm not a big fan of winter. You--I didn't mean to, but I overheard you and Pepper arguing a few times. You have nightmares, don't you? About the invasion."
That feeling had survived getting dressed and going back up to his own bed, but it hadn't survived the call to assemble the next morning or the argument they'd had in Times Square.
"You should have taken pictures," Tony said. "There are tabloids that would pay a small fortune for them. Tony Stark being fucked by his own armor? Even with all the euphemisms they'd need to use, that'd stay on the front page for days." He considered for a moment. "Maybe even weeks, depending on whether Taylor Swift breaks up with her boyfriend or not."
So, double win, and Tony was happy to come with him. There was a series of short speeches; Steve and Tony were the last ones to speak.
He smiled at Tony. "I'm not suggesting we should call Bugle News Network in the morning, but I don't see a reason to keep this secret from our friends."
That was a good sign, Tony thought, and then all he could think was a set of variations on the theme of "
"Come on," he said, when Steve pulled his cock out of Tony's mouth. "It's okay. Just go slow. I'm ready."
He didn't want to read them at all, but if he was interpreting that tweet correctly, he was probably going to have to. The team who handled all the Avengers' official "social media presence" was going to want to know what Steve wanted them to say about this particular situation.
Steve managed a weak smile at the equally weak joke. He picked up his mug again while Tony poured himself a drink.
Steve just nodded, his bottom lip caught between his teeth, and Tony started getting undressed. He was on his back, knees drawn up in an obvious invitation, within moments. The heater was doing a good enough job that Tony was perfectly comfortable naked, no need to do this under the blankets.
"But you didn't," Steve said.
And then, because this was just the worst night, a muscular arm went around his waist, and Steve nudged Tony's shoulder with his own. "Put your arm around me," Steve said. "I think you've had a little too much."
Tony snorted. "Kind of a big deal," he repeated. "You're terrible for my ego, you know that?"
Maybe they could survive here, at least for a while. There was a reasonable level of technology based on this shelter; maybe he would get to continue at least some of his work.
"And yet," Tony said, "you're still talking in circles. Do you think I'm not 'other people who would understand,' or what? Because just in case
Steve got into bed, leaving the blankets folded back in invitation.
Away from all the questions he didn't want to ask Tony.
Tony didn't respond, just cocked one eyebrow at Steve.
"Be fair," Tony said. "I was trying to have a conversation while you were being incredibly distracting. It's a miracle I could follow anything you said, so it's not that surprising if I missed a little bit of context."
"Obviously," Steve said, and Tony snorted.
"It could."
And then Steve's mouth quirked up in a smile. "Those beds aren't that big, but they could fit two if they don't mind not having a lot of personal space."
Steve was getting used to it, too. In general, that was fine, but the problem was that Tony kissed him as they were coming out of the hotel--just in case anyone was taking pictures, of course--and Steve was getting used to that, too.
That didn't mean anything, though, or at least nothing more than that Steve was his friend, and he'd known that already. It wasn't Steve's fault that Tony wanted more than that.
Tony opened the bottle of painkillers and downed two, gulping down the second glass of water. He didn't think he needed the ginger ale, except for more hydration. What he needed was a cup of strong black coffee and maybe--
Steve's hand stilled. "I wouldn't hurt you."
Steve was sorry. Steve felt sorry for him, and as long as Tony managed to not make things weird between them for the next few weeks, things would get back to normal. Or they should, anyway, because it wasn't like he and Steve hadn't gotten past a lot worse than a slight case of unrequited love.
Steve laughed. "That's what I expected you to say. And yes, we want to get you back, as soon as possible."
"I'm not going to." Steve coaxed Tony's legs a little wider apart so that he could position himself between them, then guided his cock into position, the head nudging at Tony's hole. "I'm not going to keep you waiting at all."
"Not unless I thought to ask JARVIS to alert me if anyone came near the lab," Steve said. He could have just been critiquing Tony's lack of foresight.
It was a picture of Steve, looking battered and bloody after a fight, and Tony--his helmet off, but still wearing his armor--leaning in to whisper something into his ear.
"So I did," Steve agreed, and was rewarded with a dazzling smile, lacking all the sharp edges from earlier.
Steve smiled, feeling the tension he'd been carrying in his shoulders ease. "But the general idea worked, yeah?" They didn't have trouble transmitting audio to Tony's dimension, and Tony had mentioned more than once how much he was hating having nothing but his own thoughts for company most of the time.
"What?"
Steve groaned as, almost involuntarily, he drew his knees up, spreading his thighs further apart as if Tony could actually touch him.
"A little, maybe," he confessed, although he was sure that "shy" wasn't anywhere on the list of things Tony found appealing in a partner. But he'd never made decisions based on what would make Tony happiest before, at least not when "making Tony happy" and "being honest" were in conflict, and they were still here.
Tony checked the time. Steve hadn't looked, but he knew it was getting late in the afternoon. "Enough fun that I'd rather get dinner before we go home," he said.
"Take it out so I can see you," Tony said.
That was probably true. It definitely sounded true.
But he'd have hated it. Lying, hiding, pretending--none of those were Steve's strengths. He could see their necessity, when it was to protect yourself and your loved ones from persecution under an unjust law, but he'd have been miserable.
Steve just smiled. "Then let's start with something simple. Do you want to come in?"
He didn't even look embarrassed.
The other man laughs, and Steve realizes that if he’s in biotechnology, like his file said, he probably knows Justin Hammer. Some of Tony’s scorn for Hammer is just ego, but Steve can’t believe anyone could be in the same room as Hammer for more than fifteen minutes and not realize that he’s an obnoxious little weasel. He's probably not just pretending the story's funny to get into Tony's pants.
So it was a relief when Tony called for a car, and they sank back into the air-conditioned back seat. Happy Hogan wasn't one of the people who got to know this was fake--that was only the Avengers and Colonel Rhodes--so Steve put his arm around Tony's shoulders, though he stayed quiet. It had been a long day; they were tired. It was okay for them not to talk.
But Peggy lived on after the ice, was married and had a family. Steve was happy for her, though his heart ached at imagining what could have been for them. Soulmates happen once in a lifetime. Soulmates were two halves of a whole, completing each other, and bringing out the best in one another...Steve had his chance with Peggy. They could have had that beautiful life after the war. But Steve sacrificed that life, and though he didn’t regret the decision to crash Red Skull’s plane, Steve still wondered if he would have finally understood pure bliss with Peggy.
“Love you, Stevie,” Tony replied, kissing Steve’s chest right over the already fading love bite from earlier. He’d appreciate the markings till the morning at least.
“Safeword?” Tony murmured, eyes searching Steve’s.
New York 2012
“You really did have a good time today, right?” Tony queried, the man twisting the sheets of the bed in his hands. Steve watched him, thinking of how he rarely saw Tony so unsure.
Sitting up, Steve thought a moment, though there was no further clarity to his predicament. So, the super soldier went to take a shower as the sun began to set, only to get into bed early. Maybe he needed to sleep; after the scene at the museum and with he reacted with Tony, the super Soldier figured he may need to just relax. The man sketched in his journal, random items at first before he listlessly moved to people. The scratch of the pencil on the slightly textured paper lulled him, the light music that played on his radio reminding him of the past.
Taking off in his Iron Man suit, Tony felt a relief wash over him as the blue sky met him, sun shining off the red and gold armor. Though his mask was down, the genius could smell the clean air, or as clean as air could be in New York City.  Still, it was rejuvenating, to be out here, nothing but the sky and him, the wind beating against the suit. It was a place where thought left him, and Tony could find a sense of mental freedom.
“Well, no actually. We are both in here. There was a scheduling error,” Steve explained, swapping the camera view back to him.
“Oh, hold on.” He hit the camera swap button and the screen changed to the view of the room.
“Blindsided you, didn’t it?” Tony said in regard to the man’s orgasm, and Steve smiled drunkenly up at his boyfriend.
Tony looked at Steve with glistening eyes while the blonde spoke, knew what Steve was silently telling him. “Thank you,” Tony whispered, brushing his nose gently against Steve’s, closing his eyes.
No. Steve needed to stop himself there. He could already feel his body responding to his overly vivid imagination.
“At least I got the coffee right,” Tony jested, shutting off the burners on the stove.
“I’m here,” he replied groggily, lifting his head and meeting Tony’s stare. He watched Steve remove his fingers from his bum, the excess lube working its way out of his winking hole. And though Tony had a monster orgasm, he was pretty sure his penis stirred at the sight of it. Steve too grabbed his night shirt and wiped his hands off on it.
“Are you seeing someone?” Steve eventually asked, wringing the sheets in his hands, nervous for the answer.
“What did I tell you about interrupting us, J.A.R.V.I.S?” Tony huffed, leaning back on his heels and gently laying Steve’s legs down back onto the comforter once more. The poor man’s thighs had to be aching.
Steve eventually raised a hand to comb his fingers through Tony’s dark hair, and the genius smiled tiredly, a sudden yawn escaping his ruby lips.
“Mmm, scrumptious,” Steve murmured after he licked a line of chocolate from Tony’s naval to the underside of a pec. He heard Tony huff out a gasp, his hands clenching the couch cushion. Steve wasted no time though, finding some chocolate that slithered over one of Tony’s nipples and swirling his tongue over it. He listened to every noise Tony made as he tasted the sweet chocolate and the hard flesh of the brunette’s dark nipple. He felt Tony thread his fingers through his blonde hair, a way to ground himself as Steve licked and nibbled at his body.
“Shush you,” the super soldier said, getting to his feet. Their enclosure was just a few inches taller than Steve, allowing him enough space to move about. “Just sit back and enjoy the view.”
Obadiah didn’t say a word as he held the barrel of the revolver to Steve’s temple.
“Alright,” Tony said after a pause, seeing the drying come on Steve’s nightie and thighs. “Let’s get you and this place cleaned up, huh?”
The story of Brayan and Ferris was something I made up. I found the names to be of Irish/Scottish origin. And since Steve's family is of Irish descent, I figured it would be a nod to his roots.
Whoever Tony was talking to asked if he was alright, and Tony only coughed, evening out his voice. “I’m gonna have to call you back,” Tony managed to say, cutting the other person off mid-sentence when he hung up. He tossed his phone to the side, looking over at Steve and carding a hand through his blonde hair before laughing lightly.
Tony slowed his thrusts, his strokes filling Steve like a languid tide. He pushed Steve’s one hand aside so that he could be the one to jerk the man off, Tony’s other hand moving to the nipple Steve wasn’t toying with.
“Communal kitchen?” Steve asked rhetorically. That was odd, he felt. Unless Tony was getting coffee, the genius never set foot in the kitchen. And he easily could have made himself a cup of coffee in the kitchenette in his penthouse.
He pictured his hands roaming over Tony’s taut back, sliding further to his, what Steve imagined, was a plush rump. He would encourage Tony to thrust into him harder until both were sweaty and sated, their heavy breaths mingling in the air.
“I think you need to have your first one. And I’m gonna be the one to give it to you,” Tony remarked. “How would you like that?” Steve thought about it, and the vision of Tony between his legs, his mouth wrapped around his heavy erection caused him to groan, eyes closing.
“Pepper and I broke up,” Tony confessed, his eyes wandering from Steve’s blue ones to stare at the wall behind him.
“Apparently leaving you speechless,” Steve teased, biting his lip.
“You’re beautiful, Tony,” Steve breathed, a look of awe on his face, as his eyes glided back up to rest on Tony’s arc reactor. He could hear its faint hum and Steve tentatively placed a hand on it, watching Tony’s expression to make sure he was alright with him touching it.
Sorry this chapter wasn't posted as fast as I wanted to DX
"What's the matter, Tony?" Bruce asked, taking off his glasses and eyeing Tony with a look of worry.
"Hilarious," Steve said, playing it off as nothing. Thankfully, from the workout Steve was already flushed, so nobody could see the blush on his skin for Natasha calling him out on his staring.
“And you didn’t buy that one?!” Tony playfully chided him. “The Iron Man colors are far superior,” he laughed.
The gala event was going fine, until Tony saw Steve being friendly with a certain blonde agent.
“Oh, not too many things, I guess,” he heard Steve say, his voice muffled. “There was a car garage not too far from where I lived in Brooklyn. I’d go there once and a while after school to sketch the cars. All the workers knew me, everyone knew everybody back then,” Steve explained, and Tony could hear the nostalgia in Steve’s voice, the longing of his old life pushing through. “Some of the mechanics would show me basic things. And then Howard taught me about motorcycles, and he showed me how to fix mine up,” Steve added, and Tony’s pleasant moment of sharing ended like a needle getting dragged across a vinyl record.
Tony looked at him quizzically and unmoving, but Steve merely pushed him back a bit. “What do you mean?” the genius asked confusedly. Though, Steve didn’t need to explain anything when Tony saw the blonde looking around their haven for where Tony had the lube. “Here,” Tony offered, reaching into a little bag he brought up earlier, pulling the bottle out and handing it to his beloved. Taking the bottle then, Steve gave him a thankful smile and piled up all the pillows before reclining amongst them gracefully.
Steve naturally blushed at Tony’s wandering eyes. “Oh this old thing?” Steve asked, laughing at his own silliness before looking down at his nightie. It was actually a new garment, and he adored how the empire waistline gathered right under his pectorals. The silky fabric that covered his chest, turned into a sheer, pale blue gossamer chiffon fabric, that pleated under his pecs and cascaded down his muscular abdomen and trim waist. Just for extra flair, Steve twirled in a circle, the nightie billowing out around him to reveal the creamy satin undies he wore, the edges trimmed in creamy eyelet lace.
It didn’t take long before he started fucking his love, thrusting shallowly, teasing Steve and working him slowly to the edge. “Yeah, you like how I fuck you, Steve. Hard enough so that you can feel me in the morning,” Tony said, reaching his hands up to start caressing his pecs once more. “Open your eyes, baby. Look at how gorgeous you are, taking my cock so well.” Tony switched up his thrusts, ramming into Steve with all that he had. They were long pulses of his hips, reaching the deepest parts of his lover.
“I liked that,” Steve bit out between sharp breaths, his orgasm right there waiting to push him over the edge. Tony pulled away from ravishing the blonde’s behind to catch his breath.
“Leave it, we’ll work on it later,” he replied. “You can stay down here if you want to sketch or something.” With that, Tony headed up in the elevator, gently banging his head on the cool metal doors of the car, doing his best to ignore the heat that was building deep in his belly. This had to pass, it needed to pass. He needed things to go back to the way they were, where he wasn’t swooning over the super soldier.
“Alright,” Steve finally said, smiling then. “When the clans were outnumbered, Ferris didn’t leave Brayan’s side, even when the rest of his men fled. Holding Brayan’s lifeless form, Ferris was killed too by the invader’s leader.”
Steve finally reached his floor, and it was then that he felt like he could breathe again. Steve flopped on his couch, burrowing his face in a pillow. The blonde had a swirling of confusion in his mind and heart. His reaction to seeing Tony worried him, the gut feeling and heat blindsiding him. He reacted like when he had first laid eyes on Peggy, his heart beating quickly, his chest tight with butterflies. Seeing Tony down in his lab, his brown eyes almost a glow with the natural lighting from the westward windows, and his easy smile as he looked at Steve intently. Thinking about it now made the super soldier swallow thickly, his cheeks blushing. it didn't make sense, for Steve never noticed these features on Tony before, at least not in a way that the blonde thought to be as attractive characteristics.
“Well, I came in from Japan this morning. Jet lag and the time differences are affecting me,” Pepper explained tiredly.
“Oh, Tony. Miss having you in me like this,” Steve sighed out before gasping when his finger slid inside him. Tony couldn’t say anything in response as he fought with all his might to ward off his orgasm. Steve’s finger pumped slowly in himself, fitting more easily with each drag inside his channel. He grabbed his erection once more, stroking it in tandem with each thrust of his finger, adding another slick digit when his entrance started to loosen.
Steve had lost himself to the sensuous touches of his lover, until he felt Tony’s nimble fingers unlatching the belt, only to then unfasten the button of his jeans. Tony pulled away from the super soldier’s kiss bitten lips to focus on the task at hand. Steve looked down as well, watching the man pull the metal zipper down slowly and over the curve of his erection. The sight alone was explicit, seeing Tony half naked and stripping Steve out of his own clothing.
“Enjoy the rest of your trip, Cap. Tell your other half I said ‘hi,’” she said cheekily, and Steve rolled his eyes good heartedly.
“My God,” Tony breathed, his heart leaping beneath his ribcage as he tried to stay calm. He blinked a few times, even rubbing at his eyes with the heel of his hand as if that would clear his vision, the creature in front of him simply a mirage. Yet, the merman was still there, water glistening on his skin, his body contorting away from the sailors who had an assortment of weapons aimed at him. Clearing his throat, the inventor refocused, the foggy confusion and surprise of the situation being set aside in his mind.
“Ahh,” Steve whined, pushing his plush bum back and chasing Tony’s cock, eagerly searching and needing that contact from his beloved.
“Also, we have already served dinner, but I will be sure to bring up two meals for you,” the young man added, handing Tony the room key.
“Like I’d rather spend time there, when I could be with here with you,” Tony mumbled before lifting his head to meet Steve’s eyes. “We’re on a time limit now I guess, though.” Steve just smirked at him, an eyebrow quirking in a challenge.
“Doctor Banner was extremely kind to take care of me,” Steve said, his eyes following Tony’s movements. “I should be all right to leave by tomorrow morning, I dare say.”
“Feels so good,” Steve said, lips nuzzled against Tony’s ear. “Fuck me, Tony.” Steve moved his lips over the man’s earlobe then, biting and pulling at it between his teeth. He started to shift his hips up and down on Tony, which was what seemed to have brought the genius out of his lust filled paralysis. He held Steve’s waist in his hands, pinning the man down against him as he started to work his hips into a cadence, slowly thrusting up into Steve.
Steve wanted to come desperately, and when he felt Tony’s fingers press ever so gently on the outside of his prostate, the beads just below stimulating him, Steve was on the verge of sobbing from the built pressure. He couldn’t really speak as Tony did what he pleased to him, teasing Steve and pressing the pad of a finger on the head of his weeping length, white pre-release clinging to the brunette’s digit.
“What?” Tony responded, his brows puckered together. I’m seeing you…” Tony trailed off, not sure where Steve was going with this.
“Uhn, To-Tony,” Steve moaned, rocking down on his fingers as he stroked himself quickly, thumb pressing into the slit on the head. Steve’s fingers disappeared inside him while his other hand found a nipple once more. Tony never thought he saw anything more breathtaking in his life.
“Eh, it’s not too bad,” Steve responded with a shrug before breaking out into a wide smile. His expression turned serious then, emotion seen clearly in his blue eyes. “Just being with you, Tony would have been wonderful, and I’d have been so happy,” the blonde admitted, turning over so he could see his beloved more properly. He wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist and held the brunette close to his chest.
Tony leaned on his elbow, his other arm sliding over Steve’s shoulder, his hand petting the man’s flaxen-hued hair.
“Can you understand what I am saying to you, merman?” the man asked, and Steve took in a deep breath before nodding.
Every sound Steve made caused Tony’s pants to become tighter and tighter. Steve’s compliancy when they made love was always something to be had. Slipping his fingers under the waistline of Steve’s lingerie, Tony tugged the fabric down until the panties were nestled under Steve’s luscious ass. Taking up the cloth he had dropped briefly, Tony skimmed it over Steve’s bum cheeks before tracing it within his cleft.
Both secretly suffered.
“Guilty as charged,” Tony plopped down on the couch and Steve quickly followed, pressing his side against Tony’s. The brunette took the blonde’s hand in his, capturing Steve’s cerulean eyes with his deep amber gaze. “Can I ask you something though, Steve?”
Tony sat on a wooden stool as his good friend and doctor, Bruce Banner bandaged his bleeding palm.
“So, Steven Grant Rogers, my greatest love, would you take my hand in matrimony? And let me spend the rest of my days with you?”
Legend has it, there was a force, a certain energy in the world that was unexplainable. It was
“God, I wish I could fuck you,” Tony rushed in a soft breath, as he traced his fingers between Steve’s bum cheeks. “And have you writhing on top as I pound into you, letting you fall apart in pure ecstasy, Tony added, slipping two fingers into the super soldiers throbbing entrance. “I guess my fingers will just have to do, huh?”
Tony just shook his head. “You and your hypocrisy.”
“You see that one there? See how it burns slightly red?” Steve asked the other man, pointing to the star on the left.
It was then that Steve fell back into what he had longed to do, his hand pulling down Tony’s pajamas to reveal his dark blue boxers. Steve could see the fabric tent up from the brunette’s growing erection. “
It was then Steve shifted in his seat, eyes still glued to the screen as he angled his body more towards Tony. The brunette looked down, seeing how close his left hand was to Steve’s right one. He stared there, wondering what it would feel like to hold another masculine one, but not any other masculine hand, Steve’s hand. He imagined it would be warm and strong, the perfect combination to Tony’s slightly rough and calloused hand.
Through the ages, every member of a clan, tribe or nation had soulmates because of the spectacular qualities only a soul bond could produce. Survival and safety took precedence over all things, and the warrior-like traits soulmates brought out of each other protected their tribes’ territories and enemies.
Tony smiled.
“I think we could figure something out,” Steve said, cheeks blushing while he leaned in for one more heated kiss.
“Well, it takes a lot for me to get dressed up. It’s a rare sight,” Tony remarked nonchalantly. Though the compliment from the super solider made him blush. Tony blamed the alcohol for it. “How’s the apartment search going?”
Knowing that would do his lover in, Tony placed loving, tender kisses upon Steve’s spine as the blonde had his second orgasm. Steve let out a sultry cry of pleasure, his entrance clenching tightly around Tony’s calloused fingers. Steve bucked frantically, rutting against the sheets until he was milked dry.
As sleep began to claim him, Steve nestled even closer to Tony, the man’s heartbeat comforting. Steve found himself thankful for all the chain of events he had once thought as unfair atrocities. For they had led him and Tony together, and Steve wouldn’t have wanted it any other way.
“Sorry,” he replied without any remorse. Steve straightened his posture, pulling away from his love only to then drag a finger through the splatter on the mirror. He brought that finger up to his lips, watching Tony in the reflection as he slowly licked the digit clean, dragging it out of his mouth with a pop.
Slowly moving the covers, Steve got into the plush bed, careful not to stir the genius. Pulling the sheets and comforter up around him, Steve made sure to be as far on his side of the bed as he could. He didn’t want to invade Tony’s space at all. And he hoped he didn’t move around too much once he fell asleep.
“To-hohony!” Steve giggled, retracting his foot. Tony chuckled too, crawling back up to his boyfriend, his hands caressing up his body as he went. Steve sighed at the man’s touch, his breath catching when Tony’s tongue rasped against the pink bud of a nipple. “O-oh,” Steve moaned sweetly, closing his eyes as he threaded his fingers into his lover’s hair. The wet warmth of Tony’s mouth sent pleasant shivers up Steve’s spine, the scratch of the genius’s dark facial hair an exquisite sensation. Steve never knew how amazingly sensitive his nipples were, but God, he didn’t want Tony to stop.
The blonde gasped against Tony’s intoxicating lips when he felt the brunette reach down and squeeze his bum. Pulling away, he looked at Tony who was grinning mischievously. “Sorry, I’ve been wanting to do that for a while,” he said low, resting his forehead against the super soldier’s. Steve giggled innocently, pushing his rump back into Tony’s grasp.
He didn’t stop there like he should have, rather he took in the spread of Steve’s back, and the smooth skin that molded over defined muscles. Tony didn’t understand his actions, it’s not like he hadn’t seen Steve shirtless before, and he paid no mind then. Yet now, he observed every little detail. It was only when Steve had turned back around, meeting Tony’s eyes that the genius remembered himself, focusing back to the conversation he was having on the phone.
Steve landed on the mat with a thump, Natasha's knee quickly pressing against his neck. He looked up at her and she smirked.
