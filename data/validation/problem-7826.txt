“Yes. I know about them.  The dreams.  Visitations is more apt, though, isn’t it?  When you were young, the Claim drew you here with a fascination you could not resist, but you are a man grown now, and it uses an entirely different way to bring you to me. They plague me, too, and yet I crave the connection each night,” Tony said, a grimace forming as he ran a hand through his hair. “What am I to do with you?” he questioned, seemingly to himself. At least, he wasn’t looking to Steve for an answer, thankfully, since Steve didn’t think he was capable of giving one.
Of course, Steve thought wryly, traveling with the King wasn’t without its benefits. Over the trilling of birds and rush of wind through the trees, he could easily hear the shuffling clamor of the battalion that trailed them, keeping a respectful distance behind their smaller group.  A concession he and Captain Rhodes had presented a united front to secure, but a welcome one. In all honesty, he thought Tony had capitulated far too quickly to not have already decided that the extra protection was warranted.  It was Rhodes who commanded the soldiers for this journey, often riding between the Avengers on point and the battalion behind, leaving Steve free, and he was certain that much, at least, was Tony’s doing.
Steve slipped his tongue into Tony’s mouth, gliding it over Tony’s own, again and again, their tongues swirling against each other until Steve drew back, gasping for a breath that Tony didn’t seem to need. He startled, jumping slightly in surprise as a sting of pain lanced the side of his tongue where it scraped along the edge of Tony’s teeth and a coppery taste filled his mouth.  His hand automatically went to his mouth, but Tony batted it away, leaning in with a low growl and capturing Steve’s mouth again, his tongue forcing its way between Steve’s parted lips and drawing Steve’s own into Tony’s mouth and sucking lightly.
“I put a hole in their ship,” Steve replied.
He should tell him.   There was a ghost in a computer who told Steve lies that held too much truth when he finally decided to look. He needed to tell Tony. Not here.  Not now, with the fallout from Lagos to deal with, and Tony’s walk down create-a-memory lane, but soon.  The possibility that he was wrong had long ago worn down to hope and now…now, he was probably approaching self-delusion.
He often found himself spending his weekends curled up on the sofa in Tony’s workshop, reading or sketching or just listening to Tony chatter about whatever was going on in the workshop at the moment.  He loved the helper bots, and when Tony told him they were supposed to be learning bots, though he claimed they rarely learned anything useful, Steve took it on as a project to teach them various tasks and games, enjoying the bright light in Tony’s eyes as he watched Steve interact with them.  He asked Tony about the clean energy project that was taking up so much of Tony’s work hours, and got to hear the excitement in Tony’s voice as he talked about the possibilities he foresaw for it, as well as the struggles with the SI Board over the practical applications and profit potential.
“Oh. Okay, then. I can work with that. Hey, so…where were we?” Tony asked, lips tugging up.
“I was angry, yes. Your wastrel of a father was never going to survive the night, no matter what happened, but when I found you, I told myself that I wanted to help. That I owed it to you for neglecting my duties.  I’d never Claimed a human for my own, and I thought--perhaps foolishly--that it would be good for you,” Tony said around a heavy sigh.  “It was easy enough to convince myself I was doing it for you, and for years, I believed that lie.”
“Huh?  Me? No—I—no.  I mean, I’d understand, if you, you know, needed someone.  On the side kind of a thing.  That’d be fine, if you wanted,” Tony stammered, the words sort of falling over themselves in his rush to get them out.  It didn’t register what he’d said until the words were already out, sitting there in the space between them, while Tony stared, horrified, at the gaping wound they left that he couldn’t quite figure out how to close.  “The whole first, second thing, that’s kind of awkward, though, right?  I’m guessing.  It seemed awkward.  When she—when she mentioned it.  Maybe it’s good for some people, I suppose. Some couples, maybe that’s good.  For them.  Extra help or, like, companionship, maybe, I don’t know—I don’t…For us, though, I don’t think…I don’t…I was thinking we didn’t really need that.  So much.  Unless you think we do.”
“Sorry,” Steve said, stepping away from the group.  He took Tony’s hand in his and gave it a light squeeze, then leaned down and pressed a kiss to Tony’s temple.  “Missed you.”
.  Whoa there, Captain, stand down,” Fury implored, slowly raising his hands.
He stared out at the city for a long time, listening to the sounds slowly quiet.  A light drizzle began to fall at some point, and he watched a couple dart under an awning, one woman taking her jacket off to hold over them, the other laughing and tugging her partner into the misty rain and spinning them around, reveling in it, in each other, and Steve felt such a sense of yearning that it was almost like being punched in the gut.
“You said to call,” Steve said to Bucky as the group approached.
“Oh, look who’s all apple-pie-nice now,” Tony harrumphed a bit, a teasing smile on his lips. He ran his hands down over Steve’s chest, flicking Steve’s nipple and watching as Steve bit his lip and dropped his head, a flush of heat staining his cheeks, making Tony glow with warmth.
“We’re looking into it, and cooperating fully, blah, blah, blah,” Tony said.
The sounds of clothes being removed followed.  Heavy thuds of boots cast aside.  The slide of cloth against skin.  The soft swish of fabric hitting the floor.  The bed dipped, though Steve kept his eyes down.  It was easier that way for some reason.  He heard Tony sigh, and felt the stroke of a hand over his back, up and down the ridges of his spine to just above the length of chain that wound around his waist.
“I would be allowed to attend?” Steve asked.
“Because you...you think seven-year old girls should have sharks on their bedroom walls,” Tony replied, whiplike, mouth twisting up into something like a snarl. “And that there’s hope for...people like me.” He took a long drink, then set his glass aside so hard it grated on the pool’s edge, making a discordant, fragile scraping sound.  His eyes darted around for a moment, feral and searching, then finally, he shook himself, face tightening up into a rictus of a smile.  “Ignore me. Forget it. Get in, come on, night’s a’wasting.  You should...look at the view or something,” he added, waving a hand in the general direction of the Strip.
“It’s not…we just…yes, he said, but—it’s not a big deal.  We’re, I mean, I guess, we’re sort of…dating?  Maybe.  I don’t know,” Steve stammered.  “I don’t know if dating’s really a thing Tony does.”
“Actually,” Tony started, not quite able to help himself. “I've been working on a clean energy project for a little over a year now. The Board is currently in the thanks, but no thanks, column, SI being a weapons manufacturer and all.”
“As I said, events,” Tony reiterated, then laughed and tossed a berry from the bag in his hand at Bruce, who curled up like one of those prickly, little land urchins that Scott said were called furzepigs where he was from.
“I wanted to—well, I thought maybe to, ah,” Steve demurred, feeling a sudden, niggling embarrassment squirm into his stomach.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Steve,” Tony groaned, low and hollow, part plea, part warning.    His eyes were hard, something almost brutal in his gaze, watching Steve like he was trying to puzzle out one of his equation that wouldn’t cooperate. Steve wasn’t sure which one of them was closer to breaking apart, maybe both of them, but they held each other together in some way he could only begin to grasp, and this, this thing between them, had never seemed more fragile, like there was a precipice in front of him and he could step off and fall.  He might have already fallen.  Maybe that was the point.
“It will please you to know that I have very little idea what is going on in that head of yours at any given time,” the man smiled at him, his voice light and clearly pleased, though Steve had no idea why.
“Our missions, yes,” Steve replied. “Though, I think I can tell you about the Stairmaster without losing my clearance.”
“When don’t I?” Tony asked, then sneezed and coughed at the same time.  A loud bang sounded, and both he and Steve turned towards the bedroom door, where a winded Rhodey appeared, grasping the doorframe for support as he wheezed.
“Oh?  You did always love all of that star stuff, didn’t you?” she said, almost wistfully.
“Show me,” Tony said again.  His voice was surprisingly steady this time, and he had a moment to feel proud of that before Steve’s other hand found the back of his neck again, pressing forward hard enough to force it into a bend.  Tony’s vision swam for a moment, the world righted, and he let his eyes flutter shut as waves of want and need and heat flooded through his body, settling with an unyielding pressure that worked its way through his belly, tightened his balls and built at the base of his cock into a pulsing drumbeat.   Another flush of slickness leaked out of his loose hole.  It should probably embarrass him,  Tony thought rather dimly, but he felt Steve’s hand spasm on his neck and shuddered at the feeling of being held, so tightly and safely and with such care, it was hard to explain, this feeling of deep, aching belonging that always came when Steve touched him like this.
“Really?” Tony said as he walked up to Matt and kicked at the man’s shoe.
“Still.  Thank you, Tony.  I know none of this is how you planned your week to go,” Steve said.
Steve blinked at him, then blushed, and tried to ignore him.  Good luck with that, Tony thought with a small, knowing smirk.  Steve was a lot of things, but oblivious to Tony was not one of them.
He dreamed they were lowering themselves down to the old moat, him and Bucky, feet dangling just above the murky water.  He laughed and splashed a toe in it, to show he wasn’t afraid.  When he looked over at Bucky, the other boy grinned, but the smile turned into a scream as the rope snapped and he fell, down into the water with a loud splash. He reached for Steve.  Steve lunged for his hand, missed, tried again, but Bucky was gone, and the water was still and quiet as Steve shouted his name, and then a hand burst through the surface.  Steve grabbed for it, held on.  Pulled.  But, he wasn’t strong enough.  Bucky was too heavy, pulling Steve down, while he clung to the rope, and then he was falling, falling and the water burned, it was so cold.  Cold and dark, and then there was nothing.
“It’s going to be fine,” Tony assured him, reaching out and squeezing Steve’s hand, then dropping it like it burned. What the hell was he doing? There was no need to play it up right now. Just get out of here, into the limo and back to the hotel.
“Signal good,” Tony told him.  He dipped his head and nudged at Steve’s chest again, then stretched out his neck a bit and spread his legs. It wasn’t quite the invitation position he had learned, but he thought Steve understood. Steve’s body certainly seemed to get it, Tony noticed quickly.  “Tony want—want—want share…want good. With Steve. Steve show.”
He stepped off the elevator and into the penthouse, then stopped abruptly, mind trying to catch up with what his eyes were seeing.  The large palm from the living room was in the center of the bedroom and what looked like every single pillow or cushion in the entire Tower was situated around it.  Steve was standing off to one side in dark slacks and a blue button up.
“He bounced!” Tony pointed out reasonably, throwing his hands up in the air.  Really, Steve had totally stuck the landing on mutant-Kermit, and unless you’re a well-dressed pig, that isn’t something you get to say very often.  It had been wildly impressive.
“Is that the Ul arriving, do you think?” Cam asked, pausing at the noise.
“We’re supposed to have a debrief with Fury in the morning about the thing with the Doombots.  And Ms. Potts told me on my way up here that I was to tell you that nothing in the world would make me happier than if you went to the, let’s see…” Steve said, grabbing his discarded and soon to be trashed Dockers and digging a small notebook out of his pocket.  “The annual R&D grant awards banquet tomorrow afternoon.”
Screwing.
“Tony,” Steve called out, reaching out a hand.  “Wait.  Please.  Let me…”
“They won’t. We’ll get them ready.  We will,” she reiterated firmly when Matt looked to object.  “He has to talk to them, Matt.  There is blood in the water, and they know it.  That thing with Christine?  Sure, it was below the belt, but they don’t care.  They just care about why it wasn’t them getting access. We need to give them something or they’ll go find it.  A press conference will buy us at least a news cycle.  Dump it on the weekend, and that’s a couple of days before they have to come up with something else.”
“I was…standing in the machine. In 1992,” Steve said.
“I saw that movie!” Steve said eagerly, then clamped his mouth shut.
“J, what’d we have?” Tony shouted, glancing around at the wildly dancing array of lights blinking at him while the alarms sounded.
“Uh-uh,” Tony said with a low, admonishing cluck of his tongue.  “None of that.”  Tony grasped Steve’s cock in his hand and was sliding the gilded cage on before Steve’s eyes finally tore away from the strap long enough to notice.
Steve tugged the first glove off and then made short work of the other, tossing them to the side.  He could feel his workout clothes sticking to his skin, sweat trickling down his neck.  He suddenly felt strangely exposed, which was ridiculous, considering, but there was a bright flare of annoyed anger hiding behind the feeling, partially directed at himself, partially looking for a target more satisfying than the punching bag.  For a flash of a moment, he hated Tony,  hated that Tony was early, hated that he was glad of it, hated that he had to come here like this, hated that Tony paid him to do it, hated that he took it and hated that each time he left, he was thinking about the next time, the next night, the next moment when Tony would make him feel, and it wouldn’t be pain, but sometimes it was so close to perfect that it almost felt like the same thing, and he knew that didn’t make any sense, but what in this did?
“What did Clint do to it this time?” Tony demanded, somewhat aghast by the state of the crossbow.  He waited while Yinsen asked Steve the question, though by the way Steve just shrugged and ducked his head, grunting a bit in answer, Tony supposed he wasn’t going to get a detailed explanation.
Steve looked at it all and felt his mouth water and his stomach rumble with a sudden pang of hunger.  Mutton chops in a thick sauce, roasted potatoes and root vegetables, a hunk of soft bread with slices of cheese next to it and dates honeyed in a light sauce and mixed with nuts and spices.
Tony wrapped a calloused hand around Steve’s shaft, rubbing his thumb through the pre-come and tracing it up the engorged vein that ran down the length.  Steve’s head was thrown back, face flushed, eyes closed and mouth slightly parted, hands fisted at his sides as Tony worked him up and down, feeling him swell even more, and he was the most beautiful thing Tony had ever seen, and he was Tony’s and they were bonded.  Steve’s breath was coming in short pants, a high keening noise forced out between them with each rhythmic movement of Tony’s hand.  He watched in awe as Steve shuddered and his hips began to jerk into Tony’s hand.
“Too soon, man, too soon,” Rhodes protested, shaking his head.   “Steve, don’t panic, he’s just teasing.”
“Ah,” Jarvis replied.
“Welcome to SHIELD, Mr. Stark.  Mrs. Stark.  Anthony, good to see you again,” Agent Coulson said, shaking Tony’s parents’ hands.  “Captain Rogers’ is waiting for you in conference room B.  If you’ll follow me?” he asked.  There wasn’t really anything to do but follow, since running was probably an exercise in futility considering the guards, fence and massive lack of any actual plan for life.
Tony just waved his hand dismissively.  “Maybe they could’ve made noise…but they won’t.  Not now.  Obie…well, it turns out that he’d been laying the foundation for this…having me removed, anyway, for awhile.  I was too…out of it to notice.  I guess.  Anyway, he may have been onto something, but the phrase ‘hoisted on his own petard’ comes to mind.  There were some…videos…that surfaced as part of a Federal investigation into…another matter.  His resignation will be effective tomorrow.  Whatever he’d been feeding the Board…they aren’t likely to listen to him now.  The more distance they can put between him and the company, the better.”
“He's fine.  The gash looked way worse than it really was.  And to answer your other question, while all the video of the room will likely show he wasn’t, yeah, he was here,” Bruce acknowledged with a somewhat exasperated look at Steve.
“But, then, he picked you, and I hoped…I hoped I wasn’t wrong about the why of it,” Maria explained.
“I did not! Daniel, tell them that is a blatant falsehood,” Peggy called out, her voice still full of laughter.  “Lies.  All lies.”
“Steve, I didn't ask for this,” Tony began, then stopped, because his eyes caught the wording on the order and, as it turned out, this was the point where it was all just too much. “I didn't—this wasn't me. I swear it. This—Steve. This wasn't me.”
“He threatened to go to the press with some… details of, ah… of how I met Steve.  I’m sure you’re well aware of my reputation.  Steve didn’t do anything wrong, of course, but it could be construed the wrong way by someone who wanted to hurt Steve, let’s say, and by the press, who loves to print anything damaging about me, especially now,” Tony informed them.  The way Tony put it, it sounded somehow like Tony had been the one who caused the problem, Steve thought with a grimace, though he was absurdly grateful for Tony’s discretion.  He didn’t like Tony trying to put the whole thing on his own shoulders.  “My lawyers will handle it.  Believe me, I keep them on speed dial.”
“If…I mean, I guess…if it were just random people and not…I guess I’d think that was, you know, kind of awesome. That the Alpha would do that,” Tony admitted.
“Well, isn’t that a coincidence?  I’m sort of finding myself looking for where Tony got off to these days, as well,” Stane replied, walking around the bar and placing himself between Steve and the door, standing just a little too close, a little too much in Steve’s personal space for it not to be deliberate.  When Stane smiled, it was all teeth.  Steve felt something shift in the room, something that said leave, as clearly as if JARVIS had shouted it.
The clock counted up. Fourteen minutes past twenty-two hundred hours.
“Drink,” the guy said, handing him a tumbler with some kind of amber liquid in it.  Ok, that was definitely against the rules. Steve remembered that one.  Only drink what you make.  On the other hand, if the worst thing was that he ended up with no memory of what happened tonight, that didn’t sound so bad at the moment.
It hurt.  Steve wasn’t going to lie to himself.  But, this was the part Tony needed from him, and he’d maybe been trying to tell Steve that the whole night, even if Steve had been too enamored to see it.  Hadn’t Tony been trying to make it about the money, about what he could do for Steve, since the beginning?  Because that was what this was.  A business deal.  An unusual one, sure, but Tony was paying for services rendered, and he kept trying to make that clear to Steve, even if Steve’s mind had stubbornly refused to want to see it.  Quid pro quo.  That’s all this was, and he needed to do a better job remembering that.
Oh, God, he thought, jolting to a halt.  He really was adopting Steve’s neighbors.
“Sleep,” Tony said.
Across the room, a layer of frost outlined the window where the edges of the curtain let in long panels of shadowed light.  A Nor’easter, they said, though the way the men at the corner deli who crowded around the small metal tables that wobbled no matter how many napkins you put under the leg said it, it sounded like they were gnawing at the word.
He felt the warm breath of Steve’s sigh against the back of his neck as Steve’s arms tightened around him.
The door to their room was open and light spilled in through the window.  Someone had dusted recently.  It smelled like polish.  Tony dropped his bag on the bed, then walked over to the window and stuck a finger between the blinds to pull them apart.  The caretaker had put his telescope on the deck, though a dark cover shrouded it for the moment.  State of the art, with a few of his own modifications, though the original telescope still sat in a corner of the garage.   He would ask Steve to get it out, he thought.  He wanted to see the stars through that lens again, though he couldn’t quite capture why.
Fun fact: Koltun and its harbor are based on the ancient port of Carthage, which had a type of port called a cothon.  Yes, I spend my time looking this stuff up for the superhero sexual slavery AU.  *snort*
“Yeah?” Tony asked, blinking up at Steve in surprise.
“Oh, come on, Tony says stupid shit when he’s drunk, don’t give me that. Even Steve knew enough to go try to figure out what was going on, and yeah, the whole restraining order thing is a bitch, I’ll grant you.  Look, can we just blame Howard, or you want to rock-paper-scissors for who has the biggest idiot?” Rhodey asked.
angry.  Years of learning not to show it, not to be
“JARVIS, please make sure to keep an accurate count.  Whaddya say?  Shall we save the world, Tony?” Steve said smiling, curving his hand down Tony’s stomach.
“Have you told him this?” Jarvis asked.
“Look, I just… I need to do this.  For closure or something, I don’t know.  But, I need to, okay?” Steve said, sighing and dropping his fork to his plate with a clatter as he pushed back in his chair and ran a hand through his hair.  Steve’s phone buzzed, and he glanced down at it.
“I shouldn’t have made a big deal, not at your work.  I mean, at your home and your school, fine, but we should probably talk about limits,” Tony said with a nervous laugh. “God, I’m terrible at this.  I’m sorry.  I’m…I’m worried that I’m going lose you again, and I start panicking. Which, as we know, leads to incredibly good and well thought out decision-making.”
, this one thing, to see him happy, whole, not the hollow shell walking around in stars and stripes that he’d been living with lately, it was so overwhelming, Tony was almost dizzy with it.  The picture was new, but the feeling, damn if it wasn’t familiar, Tony admitted.  It was easy like this.  No, not easy, not really, Tony amended.  Not at all, really.  It was simple like this, though.  Simple to just allow himself to care when Steve was like this, to let himself have this moment without thinking of all the reasons he shouldn’t, all the reasons this was never going to be, not the way he wanted it.
“Obie works the political side for SI.  Perfect cover,” Tony added speculatively after a beat.  Steve could almost see the wheels working in Tony’s mind, dissecting this new piece of information and filling it into whatever blank spaces there were in the narrative he had already devised.  “I’m surprised you remember him.”
Tony stroked him again, and Steve thrust his cock against Tony’s hand, chasing the awful, wonderful friction.  Liquid spilled from the head of his cock into Tony’s hand, and Tony rubbed the viscous fluid over the head, spreading it with the chains, which was better and worse, everything and nothing.  Tony’s other hand splayed wide over Steve’s chest, fingers rubbing the chains up and down so they caught on Steve’s nipples, a light touch in contrast to the hard strokes he gave Steve’s cock that did something to Steve’s mind, like the contrast of feeling was simply too much to process, so he just slipped under the feeling, where it was all good.
“Can’t argue there,” Tony acknowledged. “That one,” he said, pointing at one of the small forks above the top of the dinner plate as Steve frowned down at the variety of flatware spread before them.
Giving up on sleep, Steve rolled carefully out of bed and headed to the large bathroom.  He had to admit, of the many benefits of modern times he enjoyed, instant hot water on demand was definitely right up there, he thought as he turned the shower handle to as hot as he could stand it.  Steam quickly filled the room as Steve stripped out of his boxers and stepped in, trying to angle his body to avoid the spray hitting the bandage as much as possible, before giving that up as a lost cause.  He knew he’d heal anyway.  A little water wasn’t going to make much difference.
“Fine,” Tony said.  He pulled his phone out and looked down at the message.  “Um…Rhodey says I’m supposed to tell you that Army stands for Airforce Rejected Me Yesterday.”

, he knew, and Brock caught it, too.
“Might be the best recourse we have at this point,” Natasha agreed.
“I’m not judging you, Steve. Raza got what was coming to him, gods know. But, you gotta leave that here. I know how it feels. It feels good, letting that out. You carry it with you, and it eats at you from the inside, gets on everything you touch, and you just need to get it out of you, and this—this kind of thing lets you do that, and no one is going to gainsay it. Hell, they’ll applaud you while it destroys you, clap you right into nothing,” Bucky said flatly. “You stay here, you keep at this until there’s none of them left, there’s going to be none of you left either. There was a time when I wanted that, wanted there to be nothing left of me, because there was nothing left of them, Peggy and George. But, Steve, he’s waiting for you. You have someone to go to, someone who makes you happier than I’ve seen you since…gods, since I don’t know when! A home. A family. All those things you used to want, remember? What the hell are we still doing here?” Bucky demanded, a rough fissure of unease running through his voice, letting the question hang in the air.
Except the stars. Tony loved his stars, Steve mused.  His stars and his robots and the things that he kept close to his chest while holding Steve at arm’s length.
Steve had been surprised, Tony recalled.  He hadn’t thought Tony would say yes.  Steve.  Steve had been surprised that Tony would offer to teach him to dance.  He could hear it now in his mind.  He’d watched the videos too many times not to hear it, the sharp, shocked pleasure in Steve’s voice, the mix of disbelief and hope.  And of course, Tony hadn’t actually done what Steve thought he was offering, because Tony was too busy being sure he didn’t get hurt to realize he was hurting someone who deserved it the least.
"Bucky Bar--what? But, he's--he's de--" Tony began, shaking his head.
Very good.
He gaped at it for a moment, then scrambled for it, trying to shove it back into his bag, but it was too late.
Steve looked down at the counter where his hands curled against the linoleum and balled them into fists, letting out a long sigh as he did.
with Tony, they would look on him with disgust and disappointment.
“So, before you lay into me about this whole thing, can I just say that this is actually working pretty well, and none of it was Steve’s fault, and Stern isn’t going to be a problem, anyway,” Tony rushed out before Rhodey could protest.  “Not to mention that our dear Senator and Obie are definitely tighter than I’d realized. Steve has seen them at the club together, and yes, that thought kind of makes my stomach churn, too, but I’m trying not to picture it—“
“I didn’t ask for this, you know.  Any of it.   You show up and throw more papers at me--I was fine,” Steve insisted, voice shaking with the effort.  “I was doing just fine, and now you’re—just stop.  Whatever this is, guilt or reliving the past or—whatever you think you have to prove to yourself--just stop it.  I’m askin’, Tony.  This—you made your point okay?  I get it. You’re sorry.  You didn’t mean what happened.  Great. Fine.  This—this fantasy or whatever—whatever you’ve got built up in your head, you need to let it go.  We can’t go back.  We’re not those people anymore.  Or, I’m not, anyway.  You—you want something that can’t exist, not now, if it ever even did.  Just—enough, Tony.
If he hadn’t already been on his knees, Steve thought he might have gone to them.  His whole body sagged with relief, going liquid and boneless.   Hot spikes pricked at the corner of his eyes.  He drew in a ragged breath and let it out again.   He had done something.  He had mattered.  God, it had been so long, so very long, since anything he had done had made a difference to anyone.
“Like you said, I guess that makes us a pair,” Steve responded, bringing one large hand up to rest against the small of Tony’s back, and it took him a second, but he realized he was being hugged, and wondered a bit at the cautiousness of it, like Tony was breakable or one of them might break, anyway. Maybe he wasn’t wrong, Tony thought, almost idly. Steve let his arm fall away and backed up, but not quite out of Tony’s space, their fingers just brushing where their hands hung at their sides, and Tony couldn’t help but think of just how starved for human contact you had to be for your friend to get desperate enough to suggest hiring it out. He thought about Pepper insisting he come down here and pick this damn thing up, and wondered if he was a lot closer to the answer than he realized.
“Perhaps something to say thank you with?” the salesman suggested, holding up a diaphanous red nightie, edged in lace and draping open in the front in a swish of fabric.  Tony stared at it for a second, waiting for the horror to come, but instead, there was a rush of wistful sadness.  He blinked at the sudden stinging at the corners of his eyes and looked away.
Flecks of ice kept dampening his hair, slickening down cold against his scalp as the droplets began to fall in earnest.  Tony started rocking back and forth on his heels, rubbing up and down on his arms to brace against the chill.
“This is for Steve,” Natasha said, sounding like she’d probably repeated that a few times on the way over.
“Come on, man, you can get this cleaned up in no time!” Clint pleaded.
--has some number of stones other than six.  As if it was a--a taboo of some kind. Even now, people born on the sixth day or in the sixth month or the sixth year are considered to portend bad luck.  No one can tell you why, but I’m willing to bet, if we could trace back such superstition to its roots, it would come back to these stones.”
“Please, Tony,” Steve asked.  “I want to.  Let me.”
That…that actually was awesome.
. And it’s different, and....I can kind of see it. Us.  How this can go.  How I’d fit.  But, then…”
He was probably going to end up there. His skin crawled at the thought, and he shook his head, trying to clear it.  If it came to that, so be it.  He should’ve been dead a long time ago.
The thought was strange. Disturbing in a way he couldn’t name.  It passed through his mind and was gone before he could grab onto it, though, and then there was just Tony.  Tony, reaching out and taking Steve’s face in his hands, thumbs stroking over Steve’s cheeks, his eyes intent on Steve’s face.  He leaned forward and pressed his lips to Steve’s in a kiss that was oddly chaste at first.  He tastes better than anything else, Steve thought, his mouth falling open, tongue darting out to trace the seam of Tony’s lips.  He heard Tony let out a low moan, his head tilting back slightly as Steve’s mouth opened over his. Tony slid out of his chair and went to his knees in front of Steve, flicking the tip of his tongue against Steve’s lips, teasing at first, then delving deep, circling against Steve’s before drawing back again.
Tony was torn between a desire to sag with relief and grab a spoon and a Rita Hayworth poster and start digging his escape tunnel.  Other than Obie, the only Alphas he’d really been around had been his father’s business associates and the occasional military liaison who stopped by the mansion, and they had been nothing if not obnoxiously predictable with their looks of half-interest, half-disgust.  Steve was…different.  Different meant unpredictable, which probably meant Tony ending up not able to sit for a few days.
“I’m just gonna—“ Steve started, holding up his cell phone with one hand and jerking his head towards the balcony that sprawled beyond the French doors, overlooking the Strip. Ms. Potts finally looked up and gave him a quick, distracted nod before turning back to Stark again. He’d been dismissed, Steve decided, and realized that had probably happened long before, and he just hadn’t noticed, which made it worse somehow. The heat hit him as soon as he opened the doors to the balcony, like it had just been laying in wait to find its way inside. Below him, the Strip glittered, waving in the heat of the afternoon sun, lights already beckoning. Not for the first time, he wondered why he hated these lights as much as he missed the way New York lit up, how one could feel so empty and the other like a beacon.   Maybe that had nothing to do with the lights, he thought dully. Vegas was a last resort, desperation writ large, and when he looked at it, he couldn’t see anything else.
He’s nervous, Tony thought with a fissure of shock.  He’s actually nervous that I won’t like this.
lit the fire in the fireplace.  Someone drew him up here...they must be nearby.  Hiding, perhaps?
“I don’t think it’s me,” Steve replied. His voice sounded winded and strained, like he had been running for a long distance.
“Yes…how would you possibly understand not wanting someone else near your mate?” Jarvis asked drolly.
“Really?  We both want you gone,” Stane replied, voice going hard.  He walked over to where Steve stood, just inside the vestibule, one of the intricate oil lamps hanging overhead and casting shadows across the man’s bald head that made it look like he wore a mask.  Maybe he does, Steve thought, with a fissure of cold wrapping itself down his spine.  “Don’t we?” he asked, all oiled smoothness now.
“This Alpha who lets you roam around all by your lonesome?  Try selling me something else, how about?” Stone said with a low, conspiratorial laugh, like they were sharing something.  Tony felt a rush of warm breath against his neck as the man leaned down and sniffed, closing his eyes dreamily and licking his parted lips.  “Don’t smell Alpha on you.  Just smells…nice,” Stone said with a small smile.  “Very nice.”
, you do not
Suddenly, he needed to get out of the suit.  Needed it to not be touching his skin.  It was like he could feel every nerve ending at once, rubbing the edges raw.  He needed out of it.  To get cleaned up.  Get clean.
“You don’t have to fix everything for people to like you, Tony.  Colonel Rhodes, Ms. Potts, Mr. Murdock, Happy, they all like you just fine.  I like you,” Steve added after a short beat of silence.  “You’re a good man.   Easy to like, really.”
“Yeah. Nice,” Tony agreed flatly.
“You should try to sleep some more,” Steve suggested when Tony tossed the last packet, someone questionably called simply ‘dessert,’ on the table.
“Ms. Everhart, if you’re looking for more quotes, this really isn’t the time,” Steve said, stepping between the woman and Tony.  “We said everything we intended to say at the press conference yesterday.”
“Well, I don’t know, Tony! I’m telling you, I heard them talking when I went outside to make a call. They just brought him in. I tried to see in the other interview room, but I couldn’t get a look,” Pepper said worriedly. “Tony—“
“Friends?  More like family.  Known Tony since the day he was born,” Stane huffed, giving Steve a big smile.  “Congratulations are in order, I take it,” Stane said, leaning in towards Tony and trying for a low whisper, but overshooting it by a mile.  Stane clapped Tony on the shoulder, giving him a small shake that he apparently thought was congratulatory. “I’m happy for you, Tony, really, I am.  Can’t say you don’t have good taste,” he added with a smile that didn’t quite meet his eyes, and, oh yeah, Steve remembered him from the club, alright.
He wished, more than anything else, that he was sure of that.
“I hate it when you see,” Tony shot back with a pained grimace.
“Fancy words for someone who would probably die in said battle.  Die righteously.  Die bravely.  A balm to those you would leave behind, no doubt, but, die all the same, and take your platitudes with you,” Tony pointed out, a slight edge of tension lacing his words, though his hands were steady as he molded the heated metal of the tool.   “If I can get that to work,” he continued nodding at the drawing half-rolled up on his desk.  “Then soldiers may become obsolete.  Perhaps even war itself.”
They were always an almost. Probably better for both of them that way. Almost in love, almost happy, almost civil again, almost nothing and almost everything.
“Yeah, Tony,” Steve said.
“Nat keeps trying to get me to ask it if it wants to play a game,” Steve continued.
“Oh, look, he blushes. Cute.  Three,” Tony said, sucking in a deep breath.
Better.
“I’m fairly sure the absolute last thing Captain Rogers cares about is owning is a weapons manufacturer,” Coulson replied evenly.
“I think random acts of violence are more a first anniversary gift, but I’m not totally opposed,” Tony said with a warm smile, a sly glint in his eye.  “It’s fine, Steve. I can handle a few minutes with Obie without a panic attack. Probably. If not, at least I know you can talk me down.”
enough? What more could he do that Steve might be happy?
“You’ve said that before,” Steve said. “What is it you don’t like about him?”
“How are you feeling?” Steve asked.
The cabin actually wasn’t as terrible as he’d first thought, and there were, in fact, plenty of supplies, courtesy of Coulson.  Someone had furnished it, probably Coulson again by the utilitarian nature of the choices, Tony guessed.  Still, it was functional, and…empty.  There was that.
Tony was smiling happily into his mug, grinning at Clint.  “You could just make more, Tweety,” he teased, and Steve saw Clint’s hand in motion in time to snatch the practice arrow as it sailed across the breakfast table in Tony’s general direction.  He was pretty sure Barton wouldn’t actually shoot Tony over something like coffee, even with a practice arrow.  Pretty sure.
“I don’t know what to do about him.  You’d think he could at least be social, but no, all he wants to do is be on that infernal machine of his or buried in some book or one of those comics he loves,” Maria replied, rolling her eyes a bit and shaking her head.
“Good Lord, you’re such an old man sometimes,” Tony teased.  “Twenty-three skidoo.  Who says that?   I’m going to say it.  I’m bringing it back.  Sorry Pep, can’t go to the meeting, gotta twenty-three skidoo.”
“Yours, I take it,” Bucky guessed.
Well, if Steve was stupid enough to take that deal…apparently, he coveted SI more than an Omega he actually, well, wanted, so, fine.  Whatever.  Joke’s on him, right?  Tony got left alone and carte blanche to do whatever he wanted so long as he kept it in his garage, out of sight, out of mind.  Healthy living, as far as he was concerned.
“Sometimes. Oh, not on purpose, don’t look at me like that,” Tony huffed, shaking his head.  “These mountains are filled with caves and passages. I use them to get around during the day when I need to, and one day, I heard the strangest sound.  A voice, echoing down into the tunnel, challenging a dragon to come out and be properly slain.  You amused me, and not much did during those days.  Then, that night on the road...I was just returning from a long trip abroad, and stopped to check in on you.” He broke off, glancing away, his lips pursing into a frown before pulling his gaze back to Steve.“This is my valley, and while I may not have been the best caretaker over the years,” Tony continued, “when I stood outside your house that night, watching what was happening, unable to do anything, I...it upset me.  More than I would have thought,” Tony told him, his voice low and gravelly with tension.
He was quick about it.  Round dots of blood welled up where he cut the knots out, but the skin held together.  When he was done, the man let out a long, shaky breath, then reached down to examine the gashes.
One night, they ended up debating Watership Down until two o’clock in the morning, when Steve finally conceded Tony’s point that, for the Omega rabbits, Hazel or Woundwort didn’t make much of a difference.  Granted, Steve’s admission came in the form of getting up and leaving the room, but the next day, Steve sat down at breakfast, put the book in front of Tony’s plate of biscuits and admitted he’d spent the night looking for instances where Hazel listened to any of the Omegas and hadn’t found any, much to Steve’s obvious discomfort.
“I’m close, Steve, I’m so close,
“No. We do not.  But, that does not make us long for it any less,” Jarvis pointed out, voice thick with an old sadness that made Tony think of hand-knitted baby blankets, tiny shoes with blue teddy bears embroidered on them and things they didn’t talk about.
“I know,” Steve replied, placing his hand over Tony’s.
“Sometimes, that’s all it takes,” Steve replied.
“Never is a very long time in my experience,” Stane told him, looking at Steve from under his brow, an oily smile glossing his lips.  “You and I, we have something in common, you know?”
“Hey, fuck you, asshole,” Calhoun shot back.  “He probably fucks the same way he does everything else around here, all dead-eyed and grunting out orders when he bothers to say anything at all.  I’m just saying, what do you want to bet it’s like the fucking Deepwater Horizon back there, just gushing every time, you know, even though he knows he’s gonna get fucked ‘til he’s raw as the God-damned desert.  I mean, look at him, you can just
With a wave of his hand, Steve stood, counting himself lucky to only sway a tad before righting himself.  “I think we’ve covered enough for today, Agent Hill.  Thank you for your input.  We will certainly take it under advisement.”  Tony snorted.
“History is still exactly the same we left it,” Tony replied glumly as he shut the door.  “In so many ways.  Steve’s place, Happy,” he called out with a disgruntled look at Steve, who was staring at the back of Happy’s head like he could will the man to go faster.  Lost cause, Tony thought, as the car rolled forward and edged carefully into traffic while the three of them huddled in the back seat, with Steve’s backpack on the floor between his knees.
“Um, sure.   Yeah, um, all yours, if you want it,” Rogers told him. “I don’t really have a lot of stuff.  Yet.  I mean, I was. I will.  Maybe you can make a list or something,” he said, scrunching up his face a bit in a way that Tony would have found endearing if it weren’t for the massive loss of nonexistent personal autonomy.
“Beautiful,” Tony murmured, eyes darkening and going half-lidded.
“Sounds like a recipe for disaster.  Two complete opposites like that,” Tony remarked, almost idly, but there was a note of unease there, under the joke, because it wasn’t a joke.  Or not just a joke.  Steve could hear it now, loud and clear and bright and beautiful.
“No, no.  Please. Tell me more about how you’d destroy my kingdom.  I have all day,” the King said with a long, drawn-out sigh and wave of his hand.  “Is that all?” the King asked drolly.
He tipped his head back and looked at the ceiling again. Perseverance. You can do it.  You’re having the time of your life, he told himself.  This is what you wanted.  No take-backs, he thought as he swiped his hand on his shirt to clear the last of the punch as best he could and reached for the end call button, thumb hovering for just a moment.  The fifth ring cut off mid-ring.  Tony’s stomach dropped to probably the house’s basement, then bobbed back up to his throat.
“I feel like you’re picturing Von Trapping through the Alps, and I’m seeing something more like hot chocolate in front of a fireplace,” Tony said with a slight frown, making Steve let out a low chuckle.
“What? I can multitask,” Tony said, tipping part of a donut in her direction.
“We don’t have a medical division,” Pepper pointed out.
Steve didn't respond, but he did, after a pause when Tony thought for sure he was going to be left with the options of turning and leaving or throwing the damn quilt at Steve and making a run for it, reach out and take it, unfolding it enough to wrap it around his shoulders.
“Love you, too, Tony,” Steve replied, lifting his head enough to place a quick kiss on the tip of Tony’s nose. “I want you to know how much. Let me show you. Please,” Steve added, sounding nervous, but there was an eagerness under it that made Tony’s breath catch in his throat. “Let me.”
“It’s just that you refuse to give me even this, no matter the concessions I make for you,” Tony ground out, nearly spitting the words as his voice rose in frustration.  “Is it because I told Bruce?”
“Ah, God, Steve, just—oh, fuck, baby,” Tony ground out, his hands coming up to trace over Steve’s back and shoulders, down his arms and finally wrapping around Steve’s torso while Tony pressed his mouth to Steve’s spine.  “You’re so good, Steve. God, you’re perfect.  Perfect, Steve.”
“Open your eyes,” Tony said finally, as he took the goblet from Steve’s lips and set it down on the table.   Steve opened his eyes and blinked up at Tony.
“I--right. Yeah...sure?” Brock replied, sounding somewhat unsure of what exactly he was agreeing to.
He exited the men’s room and found one of the facility managers to apologize about the destruction to the sink.  The man stepped into the restroom, took one look at the damaged sink, where two large, hand-shaped chunks were missing, and promptly took out his cell phone to snap a--what was it called?—selfie with the damage.
“Hmmm,” Tony muttered, then curled up on his side and nudged Steve’s arm up until he could lay his head on Steve’s thigh.  “M’good here.”  He heard Steve suck in a deep breath and let it out, but he didn’t try to move Tony, so Tony counted it as a win.  He snuggled closer, brushing his nose across Steve’s thigh and scrunching up his face.  There weren’t any rules about the Omega deciding to touch the Alpha while wearing the wrap, he figured.  “We could talk.  Or something…” Tony trailed off. He wasn’t actually in the mood to talk, exactly, but liked the idea of the sound of Steve’s voice, when it didn’t sound thin and worried.  “Oh, hey, I have something for you,” Tony said, sitting up abruptly and reaching for the scattered pile of clothing.  He pulled his jeans out from halfway under the bed and shoved his hand into the pocket, heart thudding with the fear that maybe what he was looking for had gotten lost, but no.  It was there.
“Theories, Tony. Compelling, I’ll grant you, but you have no proof of anything. You can’t go around accusing people like Alexander Pierce of…of treason without something to go on other than conjecture and your certainty that you know more about everything than anyone else,” Matt replied, which had the annoying ring of truth to it, Tony knew. Damn. This had all gone to such utter shit.
“Anthony!  Is that you?” Justin Hammer called out.  “Hey, pal!”
The bedroom was beyond two large, white doors that Steve somehow managed to open one-handed. The bed itself stood at the center of the room, enormous and covered in white linens that shone against the light spilling in from one of the large windows that overlooked the city.  Steve laid Tony out on the center of it, following him down as Tony grasped at him, pulling, taking Steve’s weight on top of him.
Steve stopped himself, not sure he’d heard right.  “Food?”
“Something with veggies, please, JARVIS,” Steve requested, ignoring Tony’s mock indignant look from where he was perched on his workstation stool.
Steve didn’t know what to do. He’d messed this whole thing up.  He was no closer to getting Tony out of this fantasy than the moment he opened the door.  If something happened to Tony, it was on him.  He’d let…this…this fantasy, this ridiculous, insane fantasy, get in the way of helping Tony.
“It’s only been a couple of minutes, Tony,” Steve reminded him.  “Bus’ll be here soon.”
Leaving Tony alone with his Alpha.  Who was Captain America.
“Try to look happy,” Tony chimed in brightly. “Hey, we defeated an alien megalomaniac bent on destroying half the universe because he can’t fucking
Shuri, Steve reminded himself, because the young girl who liked her technology and her music was long gone—said.  They’ll come after you, and Wakanda can’t protect you forever. We have bled enough. Fix it or run was the unspoken message.
“If I told you to do it again, now, how would that make you feel?” Tony asked, tilting his head to the side as if simply mildly curious.  “If I had you stroke yourself while I watched and told you that you couldn’t come from it?  Put a golden ring on that lovely cock of yours?”
“Maybe,” Steve said, though he knew it was a lie. Brock would never want to come out and look at Art Deco touches on a dam, that much he knew, and admittedly, that probably
“Hell of a pick-up line you’ve got there. Okay, okay,” Tony blinked, rubbing a hand over his chin.  “Let me get this straight. So, this Gift, as you like to call it, it heals, which is obviously very cool and convenient, so you what?  You ‘share’ the Gift with your mate, and that means, with the, ah,” he mimed having a big belly sticking out in front of him and nodded.
He felt Steve’s cock harden between them as his hands grazed up Steve’s stomach to toy with his nipples, first circling the areolae before finally brushing the rigid nipples, earning a sharp gasp from Steve.  He looked down to see Steve’s eyes wide and dilated, burning into Tony as he shifted lower, pushing Steve’s shirt up high enough to allow his mouth access.  He brought his head to Steve’s right nipple and licked a wide stripe, then blew cool air over it, feeling Steve’s hips buck against him as he did.  He clasped his mouth onto the nipple, sucking and pulling just a bit more than enough, using his teeth to graze the sensitive nub.  Steve’s back arched into him, and Tony rewarded him by flattening his tongue over the nipple again and again, then swirling it around the taut peak.  He turned his attention to the other nipple, giving it the same treatment as his hand worked at the first one, keeping it overly sensitized and drawing harsh cries from Steve’s throat.
He wasn’t, but it didn’t matter, so he nodded and followed Coulson through the labyrinth of hallways and elevators until he saw a sign that helpfully pointed them towards conference room B, where Captain Rogers was waiting for him.
“You’re the first Omega on campus.  He’s not wrong to worry a bit,” Jim admitted.  “The way I see it, my job is to make sure you’re able to do what you need to do–classes, study groups, library, whatever—when he can’t be here. That is, if you want me to.”
Rhodes gave Tony a wry, disapproving look, but strode onto the mat with nothing of Tony’s brashness, just a steely calm that Steve recognized.  Steve watched Rhodes approach with a new wariness.  He had a good bit of muscle on the smaller man, true enough, but Rhodes was a knight, and not one for show, but one who had seen true battle. Rhodes was fresh, and Steve had just spent the better part of the hour grappling with Tony.  There was sweat dripping in his eyes, and his breathing was shallow from the exertion, but he could feel the familiar steadiness come over him as Rhodes walked towards him.
“Mr. Estes is not available at the moment,” she announced.  Of course, Steve had known that would be the response before he called. Estes had been unable to take his calls for a long time.  “May I take a message?” the receptionist asked, sounding decidedly uninterested in Steve’s response.
“I’m not
“Look, this is all way, way out of my wheelhouse, Cap, but…yeah.  Basically,” Bruce replied. “Friday’s gone all over the data, backwards and forwards, and that’s the best way to put it.  All of this is, I mean, this isn’t exactly textbook stuff, here, but yeah.  We think so.  Whoever had him somehow hacked the BARF program.  Nanovirus, Friday says.  That and a shitload of psychotropic drugs. Anyway, somehow, they got in, and—and used to create experiences, or dreams, more accurately.  So realistic that he can’t distinguish what’s real, so it’s maybe, I don’t know, maybe it’s, ‘The world’s ending, Tony, and we just need you to give us all your security passwords or whatever.’  Friday’s still going through everything trying to find a leak, but in the meantime…”
“Of course, Captain,” Dierdre said politely. “We have plenty of copies.  Here you go,” she said, handing him one.  He carefully rolled it up, stammering out a quick thank you.  He was almost out the door when he stopped and turned, unable to keep the blush from forming this time.
Tony took a deep breath and closed his eyes, counting to three like he’d promised Steve.  Three was convenient because that was exactly how long it took for the first part of the armor to arrive, but he was keeping that to himse—oh, hey, look a gauntlet!
Steve let out a low laugh, though he tried to cover it behind a cough and quickly realized he’d failed miserably.  “You should see your face,” Steve chuckled.
“It’s okay,” Tony said.  He leaned his head back between Ty’s legs and looked up at him, a wave of dizziness hitting him as he did.
Before Tony quite knew what was happening, he had an armful of outfits that he shoved over the top of the dressing room door, then found himself giving a yes or no nod to one of the salespeople when Steve dutifully trotted out and turned in a slow circle for Tony’s approval.
“Steve,” Sam cut in.
A circle of large stones stood in front of him.
“Wonderful. I’ll have the mission files and all SHIELD’s information on this Krakoa available for review in just a moment,” Fury informed them.  “I’d like your assessment and mission plan within the hour.”
“The company was a campaign contributor,” Tony answered, but there was already doubt creeping in at the edges of his mind, even as he said it.
“What brought you to Vegas?” Steve asked, mostly to be polite.
Punishment is another side of pleasure.
“It would displease me,” Steve said in a low, steady voice, letting the dog tags dangle between them for a moment before settling them on Tony’s chest.  Tony’s eyes followed the movement.  Steve’s fingers were light against his chest where they cradled the dog tags, but somehow felt heavy, like they were pressing into Tony’s flesh, sinking into him, warm and hard.  Heat coiled low in Tony’s belly, a line of it scorching it’s way from Steve’s hand down to the tip of Tony’s cock like a livewire.
“Maybe. It still helped. Whatever his reasons,” Steve argued, frowning into the darkness as he sank down onto his side of the bed.
Tony grunted in response.  “Nat could’ve done better,” he said with a shrug, but he kept his voice light.  He’d always liked Natasha.  Smart, scarily fierce sometimes, but she’d always been nice to Tony, and managed to get Barnes to play nice.  Hell, he’d even liked Barnes well enough, eventually.  They’d gone round and round on the who-loves-Steve-best carousel of fun for a few months before finally settling on the profoundly world-altering view that maybe Steve had enough love for both of them.
“No. No, I want to.  It’s…I don’t know if good is the right word, but it feels right.  To be here again,” Steve heard himself say.  “Are you—“ he started, then cleared his throat, not sure how he wanted to ask the question.
“Your pardon.  You must forgive the Lady Bain,” the man said, giving Steve a low bow.  “Come now, we should go.  You know what they say,” he added, hissing out the last under his breath.  “The King will not like—”
“JARVIS, is Steve in his room?” Tony called out, giving up on getting any sleep tonight.  Today.  Whatever.
Thank you again to @tastes-like-coconut for the beta!  Also to the anon who prompted the idea. I went a little off-script, but it was really fun, so thanks for the suggestion.
, Steve remembered saying in surprise.
“I’ve dreamed it every night since I woke up in the hospital after Loki’s spell,” Steve continued, as if Tony hadn’t spoken, eyes still locked on Tony’s face.  Oh.  Well.  That’s.  Oh.  What is that? Tony’s mind rumbled, grasping for anything that resembled purchase.  What is that even supposed to—okay, first do not read anything into that, because Steve’s head is not in a good place right now, and you can’t just assume it means something because…because… “It’s always you.  Why is it you, Tony?” Steve asked, no, demanded.  Tony knew the tone well enough to hear the difference.  “Why is it you?”
“Come on in,” Steve called out as he picked up the bag and moved to one side so Tony could step in.  The studio was small and cramped, with one single-paned window in what served as the kitchen that gave a view of the bricks from the building next door.   A brown, faux-suede loveseat sat against one wall, and a twin bed was pushed against another, a low, rectangular wooden table between them in what seemed to pass for a bedroom and living area.  There was a stack of clothes in the corner, everything folded carefully into piles of pants, shirts and sweaters.  A shirt and two pairs of socks were drying over the dark, silver coils of the radiator at the foot of the bed.  A door off to one side led to what Tony assumed was the sumptuous en suite.
about that?  About what it would mean. For both of us.  He’s probably joking or--or over whatever it was that possessed him to say that, but...what if he isn’t?”
“You thinking what I'm thinking?” Tony asked, raising his eyebrows at Steve, who studiously ignored him.
“Your Majesty, pardon the interruption,” a voice called out, breaking the spell.  Tony’s gaze lingered on Steve a moment longer, then he turned towards the newcomer.  One of Ellis’ guards, Steve noted by the uniform with its branching leaves. “Lord Ellis bade me tell you that he awaits you at the tent just through those trees with a light repast, should you care to join him.”
“I know,” he said instead, turning his face to the side on the bed so his voice was slightly muffled.  “I get...I don’t know. It’s just hard to let myself go sometimes.”
“Hungry?” Tony asked.
“You mean, why not tinker with one of the really bad ones?  Why change a few snarky comments?” Tony replied.  “What’s that do, really, right?”
If he opened the cabinet above the coffee maker, he would find his mug and the Captain America mug that Steve grudgingly used because it made Tony smile.   His equation was still written across the front of the refrigerator, buttressed by Steve’s rocket and a note with a grocery list from their last visit affixed by a magnet with a picture of a beaver wearing an MIT shirt.
“It isn’t like you’re hard on the eyes, and that finger whammy thing is...certainly a selling point,” Tony added, tossing Steve a rueful half-smile. “Steve,” he continued, a note of desperation creeping into his voice, “please. We can do this. This will work, and it isn’t pity or duty or--okay, maybe there’s some of that, I don’t know because everything that’s happened since I met you is a little hard to really compartmentalize, but...I care about what happens to you, and I can help. And probably avoid exercise for like ten years afterwards. I want to do this. I do,” Tony said, and that was true, and definitely probably mostly about Steve. Seventy-thirty, Steve. “So, come on. What do you say? Friends with Very Weird Benefits?”
“I think so.  Yeah,” Steve replied quietly after a long enough pause that Tony thought he wasn’t going to get more of an answer.
“I give it a C-plus, plan-wise.  Little extra for not just pissing in their pants and running for it, but I had to take some points off for not sticking the landing,” a fourth voice said. “You guys know how it is.”
“We were,” Steve answered.  “I was sick a lot when I was little, missed a lot of school, and I know it was hard for her because she couldn’t keep regular hours for a job, but for me, it meant we got to spend time together.  I think I didn’t really appreciate what she did for me until now.”
“Okay, big guy, we are
“I know, I know, you and your…whatever it is about Stark. He’d have liked you!  I don’t know why you’re so--” Steve said, tossing a hand up in the air as Shellhead ducked under the water again.   “Fine! Sorry, I won’t—I won’t mention him again, okay?” Shellhead swam over and slunk down by the front of the boat.  He made a harsh, snorting sound, almost like disbelief, though Steve didn’t think that was quite right, and gave Steve an apologetic look.
“I build missiles.  I think I can figure out---ouch!  Damnit, why is it beeping at me?” Tony said, shoving his stinging finger in his mouth.  “Do not.  Under any circumstances.  Ask Barnes for help.”
“Yeah,” Rhodey replied after a beat.  He shucked his helmet and scrubbed a hand over his face where sand stuck in the tracks of beads of sweat, then gave Tony a sharp look.  “Yeah.  He is.”
“Liked your surprise, huh?” Tony asked around a yawn.  His limbs were heavy.  Movement seemed…not worth it.  Steve would take care of him, anyway.  There would be soft cloths, wet with warm, scented water stroking over his skin.  There would be a clean blanket, the puffy down kind that Tony liked.  A cold bottle of water with little chips of ice in it.  Bites of chocolate and crisp apples, if he wanted them.  Tony liked those parts, too, when he could just let it happen around him and keep on drifting like this until he slept.
“Your husband killed my grill and insulted my manhood,” Barnes pointed out, looking over his shoulder at Steve, who smiled back.  “I always liked him.  Well. Not when I hated him, but you know what I mean.”
“Now, bend over until your chest touches the bed.  Head to the side, there you go,” Tony said as Steve lowered his chest down.
You didn’t need a soulmate to be happy.  That had always been true.
to have presence there,” Tony corrected.
“At least give him a chance, will you?” Pepper asked.  “Who knows?  You might hit it off.”
“Can I…can I…touch it?” Steve asked curiously.
Tony smiled a bit ruefully, shaking his head.  Scents were the traditional first Father’s Day gift for Omegas, not that he wore cologne that often, but he liked that Steve was still a bit endearingly old-fashioned about some things.
“How did you--what
Steve shivered at the endearment, feeling liquid heat pool deep inside behind his cock and seem to push a path down to the head with a pounding, insistent pressure. It was silly, of course.  Patronizing and infantilizing. Or something like that. Pet names like that weren’t the kind of thing that guys did with each other, though sure, sometimes in the heat of the moment, there might be some name-calling that slipped out unintentionally, but not like...
“Tony, Thanos is serious. He wipes out half the universe.  We have to—to do
“Not in the house.  You could accidentally break something,” Steve intoned.
The rest of the day passed in a jumble of preparations that Steve could only observe from afar. Even as he watched the soldiers dutifully roll the Jerak’ho out to its position, his mind kept tugging him back to Tony’s proposal to do away with the castle’s harem. What it meant. What it
He didn’t seem to need a response. Tony stepped behind him and unclasped the chain that connected to the top of the hook, then slowly eased it out of Steve’s hole. It’s absence left him feeling empty and sore, with a low, pulsing ache that settled somewhere deep inside.
“Good.  For me.  Obviously, the rest of humanity weeps,” Kirk remarked with a quirk of his mouth, then sat down on the comforter-covered bench and pulled off his boots, before standing back up and shimmying out of the jeans.
He’d been worried, Tony realized, the truth of it startling him.  Steve had been worried about him.  No, not worried.  Scared.  Steve had been scared.  He could hear the echo of it in the memory of Steve’s voice, now that he was actually paying attention to something other than how much he hated being berated, and particularly coming from Cap. But there it was. Steve had been scared. Because of him.  That’s why Steve flew off the handle like that.
Anto had never heard anything like it, except perhaps from birds, though it wasn’t like birdsong, not really.  It was words.
Shielding his eyes with his hand, Steve looked up as best he could.   Only a small, curved sickle of the sun was left, the rest blocked by the dark orb of the moon.  It almost looked like an eye peering down at him from the sky, Steve thought with a shudder.  The shadowed light slowly spread out over the valley, sheathing it in an inexorable darkness.  The world below seemed almost as if it had paused, Steve thought.  Nothing moved.  Even the torches that framed the door barely flickered.  No birds flew.  No animals called out. He could see no wagons moving, no farmers tilling their fields, no cattle grazing.  Everything, it seemed, waited, suspended, the entire world on bated breath.
.  How beautiful Steve looked, under the stars, with the moon glowing over the mountains.  How Steve seemed relaxed, happy even, soft, carefree, and so young, with the usual tension ebbed away to just a halo around the edges.  How solid Steve felt under Tony’s hands.  A single point of stability for Tony to cling to.
“I know I don’t need to.  I’m saying maybe I want to.  I’ve been sitting over there naked while you painted me, and who knew I had an objectification kink?  Okay, sure, everyone who’s met me, but putting that aside,” Kirk replied with a slight eye roll and exaggerated shake of his head.   “You aren’t seriously going to turn down a blow job, are you?”
He slammed his hand over the button, making the doors slide open with a whoosh.
“You said...you said there were other times,” Steve said with a frown. “The Reverend, and--and those men.  You were watching, then?”
Steve wasn’t sure what he was expected, Tony’s fingers or his cock, but his whole body seized in startled pleasure as the warm softness of Tony’s tongue flicked out to lick at the rim of his hole, just tracing the curve around the red, puckered flesh at first. Steve’s cock jumped and started to thicken as it filled with blood in response, and he moaned into the pillow under his head. He felt the heat of Tony’s tongue leave him for a moment, the cool air feeling good against his wet, heated rim, and then Tony’s tongue was back, licking a stripe up the crack of his ass, lapping up the slick where it dripped from his hole. Steve let out a choked sob, his body shuddering as his mind filled with the image of Tony’s mouth buried between the spread cheeks of his ass.
“So, you’re saying yes to the whole dating thing?” Tony asked carefully.
“You are quick to grant me forgiveness for my poor choices because they were born of good intent, but you do not allow the same to yourself,” Steve pointed out. “You would have listened,” Steve insisted, feeling the truth of it as soon as he said the words. “You would have hated it and argued and tried to find some way that it wasn’t true, but you would have listened. I didn’t know that, then, but I should have tried. I owed it to you—to me, to the Realm—to at least try. I—I chose to fight against something, to join up with Pierce, without really understanding what I was getting myself into. I was angry, of course, but I wanted the fight. I chose disloyalty because I needed to have the fight in front of me, waiting for me, instead of coming here and trying to make it right. I’ve been told I do that,” Steve finished with a flat grimace.
Steve started to object, then snapped his mouth shut, unsure what he was supposed to say to such a statement.  Tony drew in a breath that seemed to puff out his chest in an almost exaggerated way, then kicked the leg of the suit of armor out of the way with a nonchalance that surprised Steve given how expensive the armor must be and sat down on the edge of the chair opposite Steve, leaning back and steepling his fingers in front of his face.
“Which network?” a male voice asked from somewhere off screen.
“Don’t get me wrong, I’m definitely still picturing him in an orange jumpsuit eating the Thursday Special from a metal tray, but surprisingly
His heart was throbbing painfully in his chest, his breath hitching with each drag of air. He looked down at the restraining order crumpled on the table where he'd dropped it, the book of checks with Spock and his Captain being ridiculously gay for each other, and over to the box where a broken piece of nothing circuitry held the promise of everything he could've been.
“Uh…you okay, there?” Tony asked after flipping the faceplate up.
It was the coward’s way out, leaving it up to Anthony, as if that could possibly absolve Steve of whatever guilt he bore for the deception.  Steve swallowed thickly and felt a pit of hot, roiling nervousness open up in his stomach. What if Anthony refused him? After all, if Anthony said yes, he would be choosing Steve Rogers, and that was something no one had ever done before, not like that.  What if Anthony saw through all of this and realized the best thing he could do was get as far away from Steve as possible? Or laughed at Steve for even thinking that he could possibly be a suitable mate?
“Yes, yes,” Tony waved his hand between them.  “Tomorrow.  Tomorrow, it will be done.
“Wait—what—no, that wasn’t what I—you can’t just—“ Steve began incredulously as the other men immediately stood and began to shuffle out of the stables as quickly as they could, Rhodes covering his mouth with a hand to hide his smile.
He rolled back over on his side, facing Brock.  “What’d’r you doing?” Brock asked, a line of clear fluid dripping on his finger.  “Christ, Steve, if you wanted to suck me off instead, you should’ve said so.  I’m not a mind reader.  Now, come on, I’m making a fucking mess here.”
“I can’t believe you just did that,” Steve objected half-heartedly.
“It should’ve been a routine mission, really,” Steve began.  “Nothing suggested otherwise.  We were to ambush a convoy as it made its way through a pass in the mountains.  The pass narrowed at a certain point where it hugged the mountain.  It was the best place.  They couldn’t turn and mount a counterattack. Their only path was forward.  We only had to defend one route.  It all made sense,” Steve said, shaking his head and leaning back against the stone edge of the tub.  Tony was watching him closely, his face tight with tension and sympathy at what he must know was coming.  “We got separated.  Me and Bucky.  Cut off in the melee.  Clint, he’d set the supply wagons on fire, like he was supposed to.  It was easier to destroy their supplies than try to take them, but whatever was in those wagons, it wasn’t like anything we’d seen before. It just went up, all at once, this huge explosion,” Steve recalled, the thunderous boom seeming to echo in his ears as he spoke.
“Punching bags weren’t doing it for you?” Coulson asked, making Tony send him a confused frown.
,” Steve told him.  “This isn’t about him.”
“You are healed, Tony Stark.  Your blood is healed, your body is healed.  The pieces of metal you carried within you are gone,” the alien said.
So, they did.  Or, Steve thought maybe they did.  It was a little hard to tell with Tony, particularly when he jumped at every problem like it was held on a string above his head.  A few hours and several plates of wings and nachos later, Ms. Potts had hastily scribbled lists of broad goals for the organization, each with a few more specific bullet points underneath.   It wasn’t much, at least on paper, but it was a start, and just that much felt like something amazing after all these months of feeling like they had been beating their heads against a brick wall of bureaucracy.  They were
And speaking of bills…there was still the matter of money looming over his head.  He had a bit saved up, but had put the deposit down at the private treatment facility for his mom.  She had gone through the initial tests and evaluations. He’d talked to the doctors.  Everything was set up to move her in, but now he had no idea how he was going to pay for it on an ongoing basis.  Why had he thought this would be some kind of long-term arrangement?  He should have been planning ahead, picking up more shifts at work or something instead of spending so much time with Tony.  He could call Ms. Romanov and ask for more work, he knew.  The thought turned his stomach, made his gut clench, but it wasn’t like there were a ton of options if he wanted to get his mom moved.  The thought of leaving her at the state institution, in that room with the moldy, cracked ceiling tiles and stink of urine and God knows what, getting perfunctory care that seemed to involve turning her to insure she didn’t develop bedsores and adjusting her feeding tube …he couldn’t do that.  Not if there was any alternative.  So.
With an annoyed sigh at himself, he got up and grabbed the quilt that had slunk half off the bed and made his way outside again. Steve was still standing at the railing, legs braced apart and arms crossed in front of him, staring straight ahead and seeing nothing.
“We have…there are lakes that freeze in the winter,” Steve began haltingly, then stopped and drew in a breath.  He blinked at the canopy, and it was just fabric again, nothing more. “You can walk on them and see the fish swimming below.  In the north, the mountains reach up to the clouds and have snow on top all year round,” Steve recalled, the words flowing easily as his mind called up the images.  “You could go south and find green fields as far as the eye could see.  Tall stalks of wheat and corn.  That’s where my mother grew up.  On a farm, the seventh of eight children, though only five made it out of infancy.  She said on a quiet night, you could hear the corn grow.”
A faint light snuck in under the curtains that shrouded the single window, making shadows that moved when the curtains fluttered against the slow susurration of air moving through the vent.  Air conditioning.  There was something comforting in the low hiss of air.  Probably because it told his hindbrain Not Cave, and that was enough to keep his pulse somewhere around skydiver reaching for the second chute level.
Steve eyes dropped to Hammers’ lap, and he felt a wild surge of hysterical laughter threaten to spill over.  He was not going to laugh.  Was
Barnes grinned.
“And I am yours, Steve. But you must let me. You must let me love you, all of you, not just the parts you want to share. All of you. The part that wakes with nightmares and leaves the room so I can’t hear you gasp for air. The part that has a sketchbook filled with eight lines over and over,” Tony continued as Steve instinctively recoiled, either from the words or what they meant. There was a deep well of shame burgeoning up in the middle of his chest at the knowledge that Tony knew these things, a defensiveness snaking up his back, and he had to fight the instinct to lash out at the invasion of his privacy, but something in Tony’s expression stopped him. Guilt, yes, perhaps, but there was pain there, too. And fear. It was that which held his tongue. That, and the realization that on the heels of the anger was something a lot like relief prickling behind his eyes, making his stomach turn over, relief that Tony knew. Knew and loved him anyway.
Two, brighter together, so bright and so close, you couldn’t tell them apart.
“See what? You see nothing. Nothing to see. I should probably go, though,” Tony said, already stepping back.
Tony sighed and dropped his head for a moment.  “You’re killing me here, you know that, right?” Tony asked when he looked back up at him.
“On a scale of one to Louboutin, how screwed am I?” Tony huffed out, slinging his jacket over his shoulder.
“Well, I’m not, so what does it matter?” Tony asked tersely.  “Even if Howard—my Dad—let me do anything with the company, the engineers wouldn’t listen to an Omega, and no one would buy weapons built by an Omega, so what’s the point?”
Unfortunately, no one in this time knew how to put it together, except Howard, and Howard…Steve sighed.  I’m always too late, he thought with a sharp twist to his gut, like it was somehow a part of his destiny to have everything he wanted just out of reach.  He looked over at Peggy. She was leaning back against the backseat of the car, smoothing her skirt down as they pulled up next to the mansion’s steps. Always a little too late, he thought again, though it didn’t hurt this time.  He almost wished it still did.
… it hadn’t been all for show, why would it be?  That didn’t make any sense.  Tony didn’t have to be like that, not with Steve, but he was.  That was just who Tony was.  He cared, he wanted his partner happy, and Brock--
“You look good,” Bucky said in a hushed, almost embarrassed tone. “Now, go marry your armorer.”
He leaned forward and pressed his forehead against the top of Steve’s chest.  It wasn’t intentional, so much as instinctual, a long-forgotten habit that he apparently never quite managed to break.  Steve stiffened underneath him, but didn’t move away.  Granted, he also didn’t move forward, but, baby steps, Tony supposed as he drew back and looked up to find Steve watching him, brows drawn together and face tight.
Finally, the pain in his chest waned to twin, dull aches. “Better?” Tony asked, and Steve managed a jerky nod.
Tony stilled, watching him, face going tight, eyes bright for a moment before he turned his head and dropped his chin to his shoulder, taking in a deep breath.  He turned back to Steve then, smiled, eyes soft and crinkled at the corners, and pulled out until the head of his cock caught on the rim of Steve’s hole before pushing all the way back in again in a long, slow, steady glide.  Again and again, Tony thrust, keeping the same, steady rhythm of pressure and need, fullness and emptiness, as a low, thrumming built under Steve’s skin the way water kept flowing against a dam until he was sure it would be too much, and the dam would break.  He would break.  But, he didn’t, and it was driving him mad.  He lifted his hips again and met Tony’s thrust with his own, clenching his muscles around Tony’s length and earning a grunt and muffled curse as Tony sped up his thrusts.
“Sir, Captain, Sir,” a uniformed officer coughed from what used to be the doorway. “Ah…we’re so deeply, deeply sorry for the, uh, misunderstanding,” he spluttered while a few other officers shuffled in behind him, looking contrite and vaguely terrified. There was a wet spot on the front of the pants of the tall, thin Paul Blart who had been the one to hold Tony down while he was cuffed, and a high-pitched whine seemed to emanate from his throat until the man in front turned and gave him a withering look.  Good, Tony thought bitterly.  “We had no idea he was yours, I assure you.  Of course, we’d never touch your Omega, had we known, I swear.  If you want to press charges against the arresting officers, I’ll be happy to take the report myself.”
“So,” Tony repeated, drawing out the word until it popped, like one of those word balloons in the comics.
“Surgery’s just finishing up.  He’s…okay.  In some pain, but he’ll heal,” Coulson offered. “He’s going to be okay,” Coulson repeated, firmer this time, keeping his gaze locked on Tony.
“He was all politeness,” Tony replied with a quirk of his mouth. Steve gave an understanding look to the ceiling and nodded. “Look, Steve....I realize it technically doesn't quite explain what I'm doing squatting in your apartment, but I guess I...I didn't want to have it end like that, either,” Tony admitted. “Did you? We already took that exit ten years ago, and I don't think it did either of us any favors. Everything that happened between us...I mean, there were some good times, too, right? Before everything went to shit.”
“That’s my dick, Tony,” Steve said blandly.
“It is a beautiful land, truly,” Tony said after a moment, watching Steve with an intense look that Steve could feel sink into his skin, the way it always did when he had Tony’s attention.  “The Dark Sea at its back, down the Ridge with its mines and quarries, to the Greenway, where Lord Ellis’ keep sits in a crescent of fertile valleys.  Lady Van Dyne’s Great Harbor at Koltun is nothing short of a marvel. The Red Mountains are like nothing else in the world.  Even the wastes beyond the Gate have their own kind of beauty.  The land is…it is truly remarkable, as is its people,” Tony said.  Steve could hear the pride in Tony’s voice, alongside the pleading.  “I would have you care for it and its people, as I do. I would not have your thoughts of this place be colored by the ones from when you first saw it,” Tony finished with a somewhat grim set to his face. “It would…mean a great deal were you to come to care for this place and the people, as if they were your own.”
“Couple of days,” Tony answered.  “Don’t let Wanda mope.  Or Vision cook.  God, what was that last time?  Can we get a parental block on Sokovian cuisine?”
“Huh?” Tony managed to choke out, eyes dark and wide, mouth slack, and clearly having no clue why the kissing had stopped for something to do with Clint.
No, he didn’t.  He wondered how to draw them.  That was what he was doing.  Drawing.  For class.  Because…art.   Or something.  He’d seen nude models before.  This wasn’t any different just because Kirk was gorgeous and funny and had offered to give Steve a blow job.
Steve blinked slowly at Bucky for a long moment, then found himself giving in to a rueful smile.  “I can’t take you anywhere,” Steve said, flopping back against the sofa cushion.
, came the answer.
He felt Tony’s body jerk and convulse as his orgasm shook through him.  Tony let out a soft cry against Steve’s mouth, body shuddering, then looked up at Steve, one hand still wound into the front of Steve’s shirt.
“Good,” Steve rasped out, thick-tongued and jaw still aching.  He worked it around a bit, feeling the pinch, and then swallowed, finding the sensation odd, as if he needed to relearn it to make it rote again, though it wasn’t unpleasant.  Just a…reminder, and that was enough to set his cock to throbbing again, and he realized he was still hard.  Somehow, in all of that, his need to come had been pushed to the back of his mind or…left on the ground.  He wasn’t sure how to explain it, and nothing made sense in his head, though by the way Tony was looking at him, he didn’t really need to explain anything.
“I told you, I was—” Steve broke off, his head bursting open.
Except...he wanted to be good for Tony.  That was what it was about, wasn’t it? Tony asked him to do this, and Steve wanted to give that to him. More than he wanted whatever temporary release he might get if he cheated.
“For like two hours, when we were 21 and drunk, and only because you said I couldn’t do it, so basically, your fault,” Tony reminded him.  “No news on the hard drive yet?” Rhodey asked.
“Yeah.  Yeah, we figured that was it,” Tony said.  “Well, Thor did, after his little Vision quest thing.  And then there was this Strange guy. Not strange guy. His name is Strange.  Not odd. Actually Stra—you know, forget it. Anyhoo, big bad is coming, wants his stones, bad things for all, yadda, yadda.”
So, the calm was new.
He shut the comm off, hesitated a moment longer, then switched off the air recirculator.  He wondered how long it would take. Felt like one of those math problems about two trains or something.  He used to love those. A tad morbid to calculate your own time of death, though, he supposed. He laughed, then switched on the repulsors and shot off into the dark.  Not like he was going to run into something out here, he figured.
“I get it,” Tony said after a moment.  He picked idly at Steve’s shirt where it curved over his shoulder, like he wasn’t quite sure if it was okay to touch him, but couldn’t resist some contact.  Steve scooted closer, and felt Tony’s hand drop down to intertwine in his, giving it a light squeeze, letting him know the contact was welcomed. “You go on YouTube and you can find my greatest hits, right up there with that Kardashian and Paris Hilton.  Whenever something got leaked, I’d tell myself, it didn’t matter. It wasn’t a big deal, nothing to be ashamed of. Two consenting adults, all that. But, every time, it’s like—they’re taking something away that I didn’t mean to give. That wasn’t part of the deal.  It’s a late-night talk show punchline, some cautionary tale they tell to kids, but it’s
“You are most welcome, Steven,” Tony said in a melodic, teasing voice, then his hands stilled where they hovered over a button.  “I wanted you to feel beautiful.  You should.  Always, but—today.  Especially today,” Tony said, lifting his gaze to Steve’s.  Tony gave a huff of a laugh, almost deprecating, to the extent Tony could, bit at the corner of his lip and dropped his gaze to somewhere in the center of Steve’s chest.  He went back to his task, though slower this time, the frenzy of a moment ago seeming to have left him. He was slow, deliberate, undoing each button with care and peeling the tunic apart, his fingers ghosting over the flesh of Steve’s chest beneath just enough for Steve to feel the heat of Tony’s hands even as the air cooled his skin.
“You don’t have to stop,” Tony said.  “Not because of–I—I’m early.  I wasn’t going to bother you.  I told you to use the gym anytime you wanted.  Happy said,” Tony stopped, clearing his throat.  “Happy said you’d been down here awhile.”
“That, I can certainly believe,” Tony huffed.  “Speaking of your, ah…”
Which, really, when you got down to it, left the simple notion that maybe Steve wanted nothing to do with him, and a few million bucks was just gravy.
“You...you killed my father,” Steve said again, mouth flattening into a grimace.  He honestly wasn’t sure how to feel about that.  His feelings on his father and that night he disappeared were buried too deep to resurface now with any precision, but it wasn’t quite anger he felt, he realized, though he didn’t think he would wish his father’s fate on anyone.
“Feels a little like it might be,” Tony admitted, squinting against the biting wind that was whipping through his hair and lifting the tails of his coat.
It popped its head up and gave Steve a disgruntled look, then went back to its morning routine of sunning itself and pretending not to notice Steve while simultaneously paying the utmost attention.  Steve wasn’t sure it quite approved of the nickname, though it responded to it well enough. Steve had seen the creature carrying a piece of broadside that would become part of Steve’s shelter to the shore a few days after he woke up here, no small feat given how much that weighed, and thought of the small crabs who scuttled across the sand in their giant shell houses, and the name had stuck.
“If you pat me on the head, we’re going to have words,” Steve warned.  Tony jerked his hand back.
me!” Almost as if he had only remembered he had it, Rumlow raised the whip high into the air.  That’s no warning, Steve had time to think, but a hand caught Rumlow’s arm before he could bring it down.
“I know,” Tony said.  He leaned his head on Steve’s shoulder and looked down at the cadet’s smiling face from his student ID photo.  “Look at him.  He looks so upstanding and dutiful.  We’re going to have cool nicknames for each other and get into all kinds of trouble,” Tony predicted.
Though, admittedly, that had been his plan last year, and here he sat.  It had taken longer than he expected to get the farm and fields ready to be left for an extended period of time, and the harvest hadn’t brought in enough to cover any kind of armor or weaponry, though he saved what he could and hoped with this year’s take, he could afford at least a helm and sword.  Otherwise, he would be hurling little more than insults at the invaders.  Not to mention, the farmstead was all he had. If he left it to fall to ruin, what would he come back to? How would he survive if he did live through the war?  No, no, it made sense to leave the fields properly dormant, the stores prepared, the animals bonded out, and the small house and barn boarded up to keep the worst of the winter out.
“It was good to meet the other concubines, yes?” Cam continued without catching Steve’s change of mood.  He was bubbling with an excitement that had been muted since they returned from the bath and now seemed to fill him near to bursting.  “See how happy they are here?  And none of them have the King’s favor, as you do.  Nyma is right.  You should not listen to that Kadina.  She is just jealous of you.  The King will not lose interest.  He is not like that, I do not think.  He will keep you with him always, you will see.”
“I love you,” Tony said, his smile widening.  “This is ridiculous and crazy, and I love you.”  He stretched up on his tiptoes and pressed his mouth to Steve’s.  It took Steve a couple of seconds to catch on, but he returned Tony’s kiss with equal gusto when he did.
“Berets.  Hard no.  Got it,” Steve said, face relaxing into a grin.  “Here, let me,” Steve offered, nodding at the watch Tony was cradling in his hand.
If he broke Fury’s chair, he suspected someone might say he wasn’t ready to meet Anthony. That he needed more time.  Punching bags, that was okay, he’d learned. Good, even. Terrorists, or whatever word they were using for the other guys this time, that was okay, too.  The kind of violence and anger that was stamped with approval. He was good at it. They told him they were going to give him another medal after the last mission.  He declined. Such a good man, they said. So humble.
“Or stuck in a chimney,” Tony added.  “Which was a bit awkward to explain to the fire department, given that it was June.”
Steve thought bleakly, as a wide pit opened up in his stomach.
“Tony?  What are you doing with my poster?” Steve repeated, mild curiosity giving way to real confusion about this whole conversation.  Like the discussion with JARVIS earlier when Tony had ditched him over dinner, Steve felt off-kilter, sure he was missing something important, but unable for the life of him to see what it could be.
“You don’t watch the news?  It’s all they can talk about now.  Feds raided his place last night, apparently after receiving a download of his server with evidence that he’d been bribing military officers and politicians in return for Hammer Industries being awarded various contracts.  They found that and a lot more when they went out there.  Including some rather disturbing videos involving Hammer and others, including said big-wigs, enough GHB to start a factory, and some of those videos features several slightly under the age of consent boys.  Not from my agency, mind you,” she said quickly, as if that was the important point.
Until he let himself think it, he hadn’t realized just how badly he wanted it.  How had he ever thought that something physical with Steve would be enough?  Of course, it wasn’t.  It couldn’t possibly be enough, but it had honestly never occurred to him that Steve might want more, and probably best just not to knock too hard on that particular door, he demurred.
”—Steve Rogers).
“Yeah, I know what Sam said,” Barnes cut him off.  “I can go to the damn appointment by myself.”
“Yeah, right,” Rhodey nodded, mouth twisting as he looked out the tinted window to the glass and steel jungle beyond.
you.  He will be so pleased to see you today.  He will think you the most beautiful sight.  He always does.  I can tell.  Now, you must get ready,” Cam continued, shaking the robe a bit in encouragement.
“We all loved listening to you totally un-ironically explain how much fun you had. You know. On the next date night,” Natasha said with a smirk.
Putting thoughts of the shell aside, Steve gingerly pushed himself up and peered around. The beach was empty.  In truth, he had expected that. His clothes were strewn on the beach not too far away where he discarded them the night before.  The stone circle he made for the fire held in little but damp ash. The silver cup and cask of rum were there where he left them, but there was no sign of Shellhead.  With a sigh, Steve got up, and walked down to the water. Nothing moved except the waves, and Shellhead’s usual sunning spot amongst the copse of rocks was empty, Steve noted.
Steve seemed to have the same idea.  He got up and knelt down next to Obie, feeling for a pulse, then checking to make sure he was still unconscious.  Steve tugged his belt out of his pants loops and used it to secure Obie’s hands.
“No idea,” Matt replied.
“I’d say just about,” Ty huffed with a low laugh, still stroking Tony’s hair.  It was nice.  Everything was nice, Tony decided.  His head was hazy, but the pounding was dissipating.  A frisson of something cold snaked up Tony’s back, but then it, too, was whisked away, and his mind was floating.  Nothing hurt.  Nothing bothered him.  Nothing mattered.  “What do you think, Tony?  I was telling Dan and Preston how good you are, but they didn’t believe me.  Shocking, I know.  You’re a good boy, aren’t you, Tony?”
“Of course, Sir,” Jarvis responded, startling Steve.
“Even if you’re right,” Tony began haltingly.  “It doesn’t change anything.  So, Obie’s been a bastard for longer than I thought.  Big deal. He still has the Order, and, yeah, maybe he wouldn’t use it.  Maybe.  He’s still dead set against the reactor project.  It’s too big a risk to call his bluff, Steve.  It—no. We can’t.
All in all, he’d had better days.
“It was implied,” Pepper shot back, tilting her head back and tossing up her hands in frustration.
Okay, so, things hadn’t gotten off to the best start so far on their “romantic vacation”.  But, they had two nights here before Brock had to be back in New York, and he had promised Steve that they would spend that time together.  Brock even agreed to try some of the stupid touristy things Steve wanted to do, though he hadn’t actually picked out which ones he wanted try from Steve’s Google search suggestions or the stack of glossy brochures Steve grabbed from the stand in their hotel’s lobby.
He had no idea if Tony liked breakfast or what he would like for lunch or really much of anything that Tony liked, for that matter.  Well.  Except the coffee.  Tony must like coffee, Steve thought with a slight smile as he pushed his buggy away from the deli.  The round container of grounds in the pantry had been nearly empty this morning.  Another one just like it was in the cart, along with something called “specialty coffee” that you bought in beans from a dispenser and then put in a grinder right there in the store.
She would, he knew.  She’d loved Angie’s kids as if they had been her own, and so had he in so many ways.  He could admit now that he hadn’t quite known what to think that day when Angie and her brood showed up at their doorstep, but he knew they hadn’t become a home until then, like they had been waiting, all those years, for the gap to finally close.
“Did you see my Uncle, though?” Tony was more urgent that time, chewing on his lip nervously.
Two homes talk about the lottery and what it would mean for them.
“May I add I’m glad we’re doing this now like this, I want to call you both my husbands, and it takes a while for divorces to finalize,” Steve said with a chuckle as he looked over at Tony, knowing he likely felt the same. This would be their real wedding day, the legal one would be just that.
Nothing, not even Howard Stark, was going to come between them now. He was going to make sure of it.
“I think having them all here might be confusing, we can build a stage in the town square. Where the gallows used to be,” Tony suggested, wishing Pepper was here to write this down. He was going to have to go back to her office to let her know what he’d figured out with Strange.
“I was going to say the same thing, but grandfather and another set of his brothers for me,” Steve said, about to ask Bucky when he remembered that all he knew of his family were their names and their fate.
“I told him I’d cover his shift but he wasn’t hearing it,” Steve laughed, looking over to the pub at the edge of the square where Sam was leaning up against the wall. “I think he’s had a few drinks, I’m sure he’s fine. Besides, I came with you, I’m staying with you.”
“So should we get married?” Tony asked Steve and Bucky casually before a wide grin broke out on his face. Pulling them both into a hug, he didn’t want to let go of them for anything. He didn’t know how he was going to get through a whole wedding before he could kiss them.
“It was hard at first, it’s fine now,” Bucky said, realizing that it was true as the words crossed his lips. He was getting used to Steve being around, and it was nice to see Sarah again, though he didn’t like distancing himself from her. He never blamed her for what happened. “Really, don’t worry about me, I like it here. It’s so much better than I thought my life could possibly be.”
“Why is he so worried?” Jan asks Sam in a whisper while Steve dials. “It’s not like Tony can’t take care of himself...most of the time…”
“I don’t want to talk anymore.” Mari curls up and covers her head with her arms.
Mari sighs and takes it. “Cranberry cube. They’re low in phosphorus and promote a healthy immune system and dietary track.”
She nods and starts crying.
“Daddy!” She runs and climbs onto Tony’s lap to wrap her arms around his neck in a hug.
“Are either one of them allergic to anything? Like is there anything that if thrown at them could cause…bodily harm…?”
“Let’s go have an early breakfast,” Steve says instead. “I make a mean scrambled eggs and toast.”
“That’s the definition of repeatedly is it not Stark.”
A warm wetness spreads across her palm as she shakes her father’s shoulder. She pulls her hand back and tries to make out the stickiness on her hand. She goes to the lamp on the bedside table and pulls the chain. Her eyes widen when she sees the substance on her hand is red. She jerks her head up to her father’s sleeping form and sees red soaking into the sheets and splattered on the wall and across her parents’ bodies. Tremors quake through her body as her mouth struggles to form words.
This stops Steve up short. “I-…Tony, we finally got a trail on Bucky after months of nothing. Mari is going to understand if I miss one bedtime story. Hell, with our lives it’s probably going to happen a lot more over the years.”
Tony lets out a shout and jerks awake. His head whips around before his eyes land on her in a wide stare.
“Daddy. She just called you Daddy.”
“You heard of divorce?”
“Towards the end of the mission, you didn’t want to give up who you became. You didn’t want to feel numb again and you didn’t want to see them send me off on some mission, never knowing if or when we’d see each other again. So we made contact with our target. Arranged to defect to the other side. We figured that being locked up by our enemies would be kinder than being caged by our masters. But the Red Room somehow found out. Both them and HYDRA sent agents that intercepted us on the way to the meet up point. Our contact was waiting and there were so many agents. We were running out of time...so you sent me ahead.”
“Yeah…” He sit ups and looks over at the clock on the microwave in the lab’s kitchenette. In glowing green is 11:30. He takes off his t-shirt and wipes the layer of sweat from his face and body. “What are you doing up so late Kiddo? I put you to bed hours ago.”
Mari twists in his grip to wave at her new friend. “Bye.”
Tony lets out a sigh. He hopes the rest of his plan goes as smoothly as step one. Well maybe a little smoother will be nice.
Steve pauses. He remembers now the agent telling him Pepper’s secretary had been injured. Now that he had Tony and Mari close he felt a little guilty for not sparing the woman more thought.
Steve goes to follow only for Tony to grab his arm. He looks down at him.
“What do two super heroes have to be afraid of?”
“Are you sure-” Bucky asks.
The tech looks over the screen. “But the nanites aren’t designed to work while he’s awake.”
“Noo!” Tony yells as he watches Mari slide toward the edge.
“Why couldn’t you adopt like you did me?”
“’Close for comfort!?!’ She was right there Buck! That bullet was inches from her head.”
“Eh, there’s plenty more food to go around. Speaking of around, we don’t have drinks. Let me get you drinks. Clint, help me get drinks.” Steve wraps an arm around Clint’s waist and carries him away so his feet are a few inches off the ground.
They again have convince Mari to hold off on the Disneyland trip till the spring. She was not keen on this plan at first but Tony pointed out that while he said he would take her if she won he did not say when. He was pretty sure it was the only point that had saved them from a tantrum. Steve’s wound ends up healing two days after his return. The rest of their vacation is spent with lazy days of playing games, impromptu dancing, obnoxious singing, and getting certain children to promise to hack into Jarvis no more than once a week. Their little bubble together soon gets popped when Steve and Tony have to return to work. Steve went straight to active duty but Tony took a more administrative position. He trained with the team but stayed behind from missions unless Ironman with a Tony filling was essential. Luckily there had not been any missions where Tony could not send in his suit and control it from the tower. Because of his new role Mari was able to sit in the Avengers office with him while he worked. Steve tried to persuade him into taking her to the daycare but he was adamant that he would not let other people raise his kid. He would not make the same mistakes his parents did.
“So you let her take them apart?”
“Say, now that the squirt is around do you think Stark is going to go even more over the top than he usually does for holidays?”
“If you cry they’ll give you a hug and a cookie and forget why they’re mad,” Mari says.
“Mae, who’s at the door?” a deep gravelly voice asks. Soon after a bulky old man with tired eyes comes up to the door. When he sees Tony he glares and sets his hand on her shoulder. “We’re not going to stop trying to get the decision reversed.”
“What?” Bucky blanches.
“Good. Go try these ones as well please,” Steve says as he hands an armful of clothes to her.
“Bros before hoes.” Clint tips his bottle towards Bucky. “No offense.”
“Hey, as someone that used to raise pigeons as a hobby, she could.”
“I got it.” Bucky says before she unfolds herself out of her chair. He grabs two mugs and pours the coffee in them. Then he goes to the fridge and grabs whipped cream before spiralling that on top. He throws the can back in the fridge before grabbing a cinnamon stick from a container on the counter next to the machine and sticking it in one of the mugs. He walks over and hands her the mug with the cinnamon stick. “Here.”
“Of course sir.”
Bucky laughs. “I think I can handle a five year old.”
“And let me guess,” Steve turns towards Tony. “You’ve refused medical attention because you’re just fine.”
Tony grunts and gathers the dishes. “Why don’t we have a house keeper again?”
“Does that mean I have to use social skills?” She screws her face up in a grimace.
“Sir, I know you are busy but perhaps you have a spare moment to stop her?”
“...you still can’t love someone you don’t remember.”
“Is that a controller or are you just happy to see me?” Tony asks.
“This is not your locker, it’s my coffee table! Put those and the game where they belong. You have your own doodad in your own room. Mari, sweetie, can you not draw on the windows?” He marches back to the kitchen to spray the counter and scrubs at it with a rag.
Steve instantly goes ramrod straight. Tony pouts until he turns and sees the voice came from a nervous looking nurse. He straightens as well.
“Anything I should, like, know to do or, let’s be real, not do for tonight?” Tony asked as the limo started to roll over the bumpy road down to the highway.
Steve told him.
Tony managed to nod, his head lolling back against the back of the sofa as he stared up at Steve.  “Just relax,” Steve told him.  He slid off of Tony’s lap and knelt on the floor between Tony’s legs.  Tony huffed out a small puff of air, but said nothing, just watched Steve with wide, dark eyes, glittering in the low light.
“I can put them away while you clean up the, uh, frying pan, if you want,” Steve offered, nodding towards the pan that was sitting cooling in the sink with bits of egg and kale still stuck to it.
“I’ll hum,” Steve said as he walked back out with three bags in one hand and the swing in the other.  “What?  She likes the swing.” He shot Tony a smile, and got the rest loaded, clearly using some kind of interdimensional space in the back of the SUV to get it all to fit.
That was when the door imploded.
“It was not just that—” Steve began.
“Peg,” Howard pleaded with a broken sob.  “This isn’t what it looks like.”
A pang of longing hit him, and he blinked, grinding his jaw against the sudden emptiness in his chest.  He missed them. He missed who he was with them. And he loved Tony. His mind couldn’t seem to let him settle on any of those thoughts, just kept skipping over each of them like a rock across the smooth surface of a lake.  When the story finished, he almost thought Tony asleep, but felt him stir slightly and give a pleasant hum of warm breath against Steve’s chest.
“Well, you’re an Alpha, so…me…me, an Omega, playing like Captain America. That’s pretty ridiculous, I know,” Tony said, casting a furtive glance to Jarvis.  “I stopped.  I mean, obviously, I stopped.  That was years ago.  But, I…it was just that one time.  Wasn’t like I was running around, pretending to be a hero or something.”
“It isn’t that I don’t enjoy these lovely little nighttime strolls of yours,” Tony called out, sounding anything but pleased to be picking his way through the forest in the dead of night.
“So,” Barnes said after a pause.  “This whole thing is just some kind of play-acting thing.”
Color.  Damn it, Tony thought, grinding his teeth in frustration.  He got up from his chair and walked over to bend down low enough to see his reflection in the Audi’s driver-side mirror.  Yep.  Great. A smear of grease slashed across his check where he’d let his hand dangle.  So much for bringing sexy back, he thought with a sigh.
“Was that out loud?” Tony asked, pulling a face.  He didn’t look particularly chagrined. In fact, a slow, lazy smile was forming.  Steve watched him shove his hands in his pockets and walk towards him on light, deliberate steps, eyes twinkling.
“Yes. Um. Okay,” Steve finally stammered.
“I guess,” Steve replied.  He slunk into one of the few bench seats open, leaving a spot for Tony next to him.
“It’s the equivalent of playing Jenga on quicksand and having to pull the pieces out with your teeth,” Matt corrected.
“I—yeah. Okay. Well. Guess—guess this is goodbye, then,” Steve replied stiffly, but there was relief there, too, and, in that moment, Tony hated him a little for that.
“Pepper’s still trying to be slightly disapproving in the hopes of reforming me through sheer force of will, but she’s secretly doing one of those touchdown dances in her head,” Tony said, lips quirking into a smile as he caught Pepper rolling her eyes and bobbing her head, though she couldn’t quite manage to keep the grin off her face.
Still.  It was a yes, even if it was the most unenthusiastic ‘sounds great’ that Steve had ever heard. His heart was hammering in his chest.  He wondered if Tony could hear it.  Probably not, but it felt like he could, and suddenly, Steve was conscious of his arms, hanging at his sides with nothing to do now that Tony was holding the groceries, his body, always too big now, when he thought about it, and he was staring again, trying to drink Tony in as much as he could before the door was shut again. He sometimes felt he took up too much space in this body.  On instinct, he stepped back, putting space between them. Tony seemed to relax a bit at that, Steve noticed. Steve couldn’t really blame him.
Tony sighed and scraped a hand through his hair, leaving it slicked back and prone to curl at the edges. “The old Ul, his father, Ul-Tuc, he was a great man. Learned, wise, and genuinely concerned for the welfare of his people,” Tony recalled. “I met him several times. First, with my father when I was just a boy, and then later, when I took the throne, I treatied with him. He was canny, that’s certain, and wrung more concessions out of me than I intended, but he was fair, too. He understood the tenuousness of the peace here, as well as the necessity of it. For both our peoples.”
it. A child with your name will be as much mine as any, at least in my heart, you must know that. Peter will be to me like my own son, I swear it.”
“Tony Stark happened,” Steve said with a low laugh, shaking his head.
“Steve,” Steve replied.  “My name is Steve.”
“I understood that reference,” Steve replied, and then they were both cracking up like a couple of kids, the laughter building on itself until Tony was slapping his knee and waving his hand for it to stop.
“Yes, definitely far better uses for him than fodder for the fighting rings,” the Lord said, running a hand over Steve’s back, between his shoulder blades, then down his spine.  Then lower, spreading him and holding him open for a long moment before continuing.  “Far better uses, I would say.”
Tony pulled out his phone and tapped the screen.  “JARVIS, wake up, Buddy.  I’m going to need you bright-eyed and bushy-tailed this morning.”
“I’m not coming out without him,” Steve said.  She glanced away, towards the bank of monitors where Friday was running whatever program she had created to allow Steve’s version of the BARF to interface with whatever Tony was seeing.  Dreaming.
, Steve thought.  It was undisguised want.
Tony hummed some type of agreement.  “You
Tony leaned in to Steve’s chest and fisted his hands in the front of Steve’s shirt, tugging at it until Steve got the hint and wrapped his arms around Tony’s back in an embrace that got tighter the longer it went on.  It took Tony a moment to realize Steve was shaking.
“Me?” Tony parroted blankly.
“But, that’s not it,” Steve continued in a rush.  “Or, not all of it.  You’re doing this because you care.  Because you can, and maybe that’s the same thing as you should.  You’ve clearly thought about this.  A lot,” Steve continued with a slight heavenward look, and, yeah, okay, Tony had been talking his ear off, though he didn’t get the sense Steve was complaining so much as making an observation.  “And you can see a better way.  Something maybe all of us missed.  Sometimes…we get so entrenched in what is, we can’t see what could be.  Particularly something as big and immovable as the military industrial complex.  Sometimes the best you can do is to start over.”
“I don’t go in the water,” Tony replied, not looking up from the tablet.
“Funny, J,” Tony muttered.
“I'm sorry, Mr. Stark. I'm afraid I'm going to have to insist that you wait until after all of this is taken care of before speaking to my client,” Murdock cut in, though there was an undercurrent question in his voice despite the firm ton. “Everything seems to be in order, but I'd like to go over a few things with Steve before he signs. I can have the papers dropped off at your office tomorrow. I'd just ask that your lawyers forward me fully executed copies after you sign.”
“The Phantom Creeps?  Was that George Lucas?” Tony said with a small laugh.
Tony looked around the kitchen, then remembered he had a task.  Movie.  Okay.  He could do that.  What had they talked about?  Right.  Predator.  He glanced around numbly, then shook his head to try to clear it.  He braced a hand against the countertop for support, while he tried to convince his legs to stop shaking, then frowned at the sudden sense of wrongness.  It took a second to find the source of the feeling.
He disobeyed.  Not just tonight, but all the nights, all the thoughts, all the plans.  Each time he looked at the map, he disobeyed, he lied, he defied.  He didn’t deserve Tony’s trust, not really, and he knew it. Leaving would hurt Tony so much.  Indescribably so, Steve knew that, and he would still do it, and for what?  He still wasn’t sure he knew.  Who knew what kind of fodder Steve’s escape might give those who would use it against Tony?
Tony snorted out a surprised bark of laughter and looked up in time to catch the chagrined expression on Steve’s face. “Sorry,” Steve said again, his mouth tightening as he gripped the now useless coffee mugs. “Bit rusty on the whole host duties thing, I guess. Place is a mess, I know. Still—still trying to get moved in, I s’pose.”
Steve took a deep breath.  “The truth is…the truth is that after that first night, I’d decided I was done with this.  I told Ms. Romanov that when she called.  But then…then she said you wanted me back that night.  And I found myself saying yes.  Not because of the money, Tony.  I’m not going to pretend I didn’t use that to justify it in my head.  Or that didn’t make life easier. But the truth is, I wanted to see you again.  If Romanov had said any other name, I’d have been done with this.  I told her that.  But when she said it was you…I wanted to go back.  I told myself it was the money, but if that had been it, then anyone would’ve done.  I wanted to be with you,” Steve tried to explain.  “So, please, stop blaming yourself for my choices.   That first night…I was a lot of things.  Nervous, embarrassed and, well, a lot of things.  But I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want to be there that night.  I could’ve left.  And I knew you’d have paid me the night’s money without going further if I’d asked it.  But I didn’t.  You’re so busy blaming yourself, you don’t see that I wanted you, too,” Steve was practically shouting now.  “You want to take me out of this whole equation and put it all on you.  I’m not going to let you do that to yourself.  And I’m not going to let you reduce me to someone who can’t make his own decisions or take responsibility for them.”
“Well, I expect no one had ever shown him how,” Peggy replied.
“And I’m saying I believe you. I’d like to think that means you understand what’s at stake here. What we’re up against.  You may not like all of our methods,” Fury acknowledged. “Hell, I don’t, and they’re
“I can’t screw this up,” Tony blurted out, the words coming out wet and thick as he swiped at his eyes.  He was shaking.  “I can’t.” He squeezed his eyes shut and shoved his fist against his mouth. He turned towards the car window and opened his eyes, blinking rapidly and staring unseeing back at the house. “I can’t, Steve. She’s…God, she’s…everything.”
“Thank you, JARVIS.  Can you see if you can find Colonel Rhodes and everyone else?” Steve asked, standing up. “Are you okay?” Steve asked gently, coming back to bend over Tony.  He cupped Tony’s face in his hands, and studied him carefully, eyes roaming up and down over Tony’s face.
“God, you’re gorgeous.  Look at you,” Tony said before claiming Steve’s mouth again, gentler this time, as if seeking some kind of balance with what his hands were doing to Steve’s chest.
Tony nodded and kept his eyes on his plate of half-eaten pancakes and bacon, one hand holding the fork dangling over it, which let him partially hide his face.  He felt, as much as heard, Steve move away then, own the hall and to the bathroom.  A moment later, the water of the shower blasted on, and some of the tension left his shoulders, though the sugary breakfast was already curdling in his stomach.  He put his fork down and picked up the mug of coffee, taking a long swallow of the lukewarm brew.
“Ah.  I see,” Rogers said, shifting a bit in his seat, shoulders hunching like he was trying to make himself smaller, which was, let’s face it, a physical impossibility as far as Tony could tell.  “So, this, ah.  This whole thing isn’t really your idea, I take it?”
to be.
“Right. Well, actually, the guy I talked to, Professor Thorne, he works mainly with some kind of observatories in Louisiana and Washington, I think he said, though he does most of his research from here,” Steve explained.  “Seemed like a nice guy. He’s going to be the one actually giving you the tour.”
“Good. That’s—I’m---tame—tall--what?” Tony replied, then promptly ran out of words to say, which didn’t matter much, since his tongue was suddenly too big for his mouth and pasted to the top of it, anyway.  Taming…that was…well.  That brought some images to his head that he didn’t really need, quite frankly, and damn, that was flirting, wasn’t it?  It was so fucking hard to tell with Steve, or maybe it was just the first time in a very, very long time that Tony desperately wanted the answer to be yes.
“Listen up, discount Arthur, I have a proposition for you,” Tony interjected, crossing his arms over his chest.  “You know who I am?”
“Sorry,” Steve mumbled, tossing the towel over his shoulder.  “Here.  Eat,” he said, putting a plate of buttered toast and a steaming cup of coffee down in front of Tony.
Tony glanced over his shoulder, watching Steve for a moment, then went back to lacing up his breeches and reaching for the boots one of the servants held out for him with a bow.   Tony waved the two off, frowning after them until the doors closed behind them.  “I must attend Court today,” he announced, not looking at Steve.  “Then meetings.  But, I have the afternoon free.  Well, Pepper would say that I don’t, but nevermind that. You’ve been stuck in here too long.  Gives you too much time to think,” he continued, and that did earn Steve a quick, knowing glance. “I thought, perhaps, you might enjoy what you mentioned once.  Sparring.  If you still wish to be humiliated, that is,” he said, turning around now that he was dressed in his finery to face Steve.  “Feel free to bow out,” he offered, waving a hand in the air, then bending to open a velvet-lined box that one of the servants must have brought.  He settled a simple golden circlet dotted with jewels on his head and slid two large, crested rings, one onto each hand, before turning back to Steve.  “I will not judge you for it.  There are always other, far more pleasant, reasons for finding yourself flat on your back.”
“No clue,” Tony answered with a shrug.  “Got my papers?”  He felt Rhodey stiffen a bit at his side while the word rolled through the rest of the room in a wave.
Steve sighed. He wasn’t even mad at Tony for the subterfuge with Bruce, not really, anyway.  He understood Tony’s drive to know, to understand, to eliminate the risks. To protect. To control.  It was a part of who Tony was. What made him a good King and a better man, this deep and sometimes terrible devotion.  He cared, deeply, and he feared loss in the way of a man who has known too much of it.
Like he said, perks to having the peak of human perfection as your Alpha.
It should hurt, saying it out loud, like something was being peeled off of him, pulled out of him. And it did, in the excruciating pause before Tony spoke, but it wasn’t that kind of pain.  There was pain bursting bright and fierce inside him, making his stomach churn and clench, but it was like something set loose after being held in a vice for too long, blood flowing back into limbs that had forgotten the feeling, the first breath of air when you break the surface.  Pain, yes, but the kind that comes when the fear of staying is greater than the pain of moving through it, because something waited on the other side of it.  Tony waited.  He had been waiting, for so very long, waiting with his hand held out, for Steve to find him.
“Tony…that’s…that’s incredible,” Steve said with a quick shake of his head.  “Wow.”
here.
No one would answer his questions, of course, either because they didn’t know or had been told not to tell him, since Howard seemed to want to play at fucking Wadsworth and cloak the whole thing in mystery.  Tony wasn’t sure if Howard was just being a RuPaul-sized drama queen about it or if Rogers wanted Tony kept in the dark.  Maybe there was some reason they didn’t want to tell Tony anything.  Like…Rogers’ last Omega had been found dumped in a shallow ditch with his head shaved and fingernails pulled out.
“You modified your suits to carry him.  You trusted him with the override codes.  Nat tells me everything,” Pepper explained with a dismissive wave of her hand at his stunned expression.  “You’re having JARVIS help find Barnes because Steve wants his friend back, even though I know that the thought of it absolutely terrifies you,” she finished gently.
“Oh, right. Get out,” Tony announced, pulling at Steve again.
“Tony.  What’s going on? Where am I?” Steve asked.  Tony sighed, wiped a hand over his face and got up, returning with a blanket, which he wrapped around Steve’s shoulders.
“This gonna be a thing?” Fury asked.  “’Cause, I got a proposal on my desk that involves moving our drone program to SI so we can work with Tony Stark, who I know for a fact has never set foot in SI’s research labs.”  Tony started, almost moving forward like he was going to interject something, but he had no idea what, so he hung there, mid-motion, caught by indecision while he stared at Fury’s black-coated back.
Steve shook his head and glanced down at his half-full coffee mug, turning it slowly in his hand.  “I was thinking.”
“You can wait inside,” the other guard, Josiah, suggested.
Bait.  Hook.
“Whatever you did, it’s pretty swell,” Steve said, giving Tony’s shoulder a gentle squeeze.  “Thanks for letting me meet them.”
“We can head over whenever you’re ready,” Tony said softly.
A large plaque on the side said, in bold, black letters, “BUCKY’S HOT TUB.”
When they did stop for the night, finally, Steve stood there, swaying.  His legs quivered and shook, like they were trying to rid themselves of the pain and couldn’t manage it.  If he looked behind him, he was fairly sure he would see a line of bloody footprints marking the rounded line of road between the wheel wells.  He sat where he was, in the middle of the road.  No one disturbed him.  It wasn’t as if he could run off.  Someone gave him a skin filled with water.  He drank it too quickly, choked and coughed some up, then forced himself to slow his swallows.  A hard hunk of bread landed near his foot.  He brushed the dirt off and ate it in small, careful bites.
“Sorry, that’s—Daddy issues are date number two, right?  I always forget,” Stark said with a quick laugh, picking up a French fry and shoveling it through some ketchup.  “So, yeah, anyway, Iron Man and Cap, they’re definitely trading BFF necklaces.  You going to eat your had-a-chance-at-life-fish or what?”
“Tony,” Steve called out softly at the same time his hand reached over and covered Tony’s where it lay on the seat between them, threading his fingers through Tony’s against the leather of the seat.  It reminded Tony of his thoughts while he and Steve were curled up on the sofa.  How badly he had wanted to twine his hand into Steve’s, to feel that connection, and here it was, offered up freely and without expectation.  It was wonderful and terrible at the same time.  So near to what he wanted.  He could close his eyes and push away that single sliver of space between what he had and what he wanted.
“I’m basically looking after someone, it’s not that…it’s…” Steve pursed his lips, taking a few deep breaths as he struggled with his morals versus his sense of logic. He didn’t know what to do, he had gone in this deciding to do one thing, but now he was drawn to telling Sam the truth. He just didn’t want either of them to die for it.
“I think you’re right,” Steve replied sadly after a few seconds, rubbing Bucky’s shoulder. “I’m sorry I waited so long to apologize. I’m sorry we didn’t do this ages ago.”
