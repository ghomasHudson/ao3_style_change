“You don’t have to worry about him.”
Stefen shrugged and Tony supposed the shoulders were going to win the honor of being stared at.
“It’s about damage control now. They have to send a clear message. A warning to others. But they have to step carefully,” he thought out loud. Beside him Pepper took a shaky breath.
"And then we will be with Father in England, and we will not see familia again for a long time. Maybe never." Wanda interjected with that same eerier certainty. "It's going to be alright Pietro. I see that now. Mama’s dream wasn’t meant for us at all."
Everyone seemed to breathe in at once, a shocked inhale, all eyes flying to Péter whose face had drained completely of color.
They made it back to the cabin at early light, the sun just beginning to cast the clouds in pale shades of blue and grey. Natacha was the lookout. Ian saw her red hair first, standing out like a fox in the snow. He smiled as she ran to meet them.
Tony watched their progress and the tension that had been coiled tightly in his chest finally began to ease, until the captain’s quiet voice made him go tense again.
“Yes,” the fellow answered after a moment, his eyes flicking nervously to Benjamino, who was standing at Steve’s left attempting to be unobtrusive. “I know his face well. All the shoe shiners know to look out for him. He is a fascist -” the man spat the word like it was dirty, and then seemed to catch himself. His eyes went big and darted fearfully to Captain Altera, whose attention had been pricked by a word he understood.
“God awful mess.” Bucky muttered as another warning finished playing once more on radio. They’d kept it playing all day, hoping to hear any fresh bit of news.
“Herr Stark.”
He hesitated for a long moment, unable to determine whether the powerful urge to take it back was gut instinct or fear. He’d learned to trust his instincts, but he was also learning that he’d been confusing the two for far too long.
“Some of us know how to swim,” Natacha volunteered from her boat and Tony glanced at her, curious. She elaborated with a small shrug. “We used to swim in the summer when our mother was alive.”
“You alright sharing with Ian and Péter?”
but Steve couldn’t help but smile. Bucky always had a way of making Steve laugh with him.
"Because he's family" he answered, perhaps a little harsher then he meant too.
“You know you fooled me when we first met. I thought you were this perfectly starched stiff lipped model of respectability, but I have since figured out that under that uniform you’re delightfully as common as they come. I’m sure it’s tempting Love, but your superiors would not take kindly to you beating my former tutor to a pulp.” Tony whispered against his ear, lips lifting in half smirk, but there was wariness too in his gaze. Fear that Steve might do something he’d regret.
“Anton, I’d like you to meet – ”
After he’d been lined up and scrubbed with long handled brushes that tore at his skin, they’d tossed him and the other men clothes. The number they’d given him in holding had been printed on a steel bracelet and then shackled to his wrist.
~*~*~
Tony. The man’s face flashed through Stefen’s mind and his chest tightened with fear and longing. What would Tony do if Steve was arrested? Go back to the abbey he supposed… but it was such a waste. Somehow the thought of their vivacious little monk cloistered behind thick stone walls made him angry. Surely the Abbot wouldn’t allow him to chatter through breakfast, running commentary on all the mornings news. Silent meals seamed more in keeping with what monks got up to but Steve just couldn’t imagine Tony living that way. Didn’t want to. It upset him to think of Tony alone, with no one to listen to his ever-growing list of things that needed inventing: tubs that washed the clothing for you, soap that didn’t scald the hands, stoves you could carry with you, a way to harness nuclear energy and turn it into electricity, a way to keep ice that didn’t involve wielding a chisel. Tony was so full of life, full of heat and spark and smoke and flash. He just didn’t belong in a damn abbey!
NARRATOR: This is German news from the Rhineland and abroad.
“That’s heavy reading don’t you think?” Stefen drawled and Tony tensed.
“Herr Bakhuizen!” he turned once he was sure his face was a mask of confidence. “How delightful to see that you’ve returned from your travels.”
He could still hear them, cruel and mocking as they screamed at him in German.
“I'm done! Father I'm done! Let's go now, please.”
Stillness descended once more over the lodge. There was a long painful stretch of silence before Tony quietly got up and risked a peek out the window. The truck was gone, but that might be a trick. Someone might be waiting in the trees nearby, watching unseen but Tony couldn’t know that for sure. Next, he went over to the door, releasing the latch with a hesitant breath before lifting the door and wincing as it creaked. He stuck his head down through the hole and peered into the room below, confirming it was truly empty before he sat back up.
As she sat there, facing off with the woman who had given her life but denied her so many other things, Tony had felt something for the first time other than resentment for Baroness Schrader.
“Getting laid.” Bucky snapped, bracing himself on the back of the armchair. “You know dumb doesn’t suit you Steve and whatever you think, I wasn’t born yesterday.”
Bucky whispered in his left. Steve shuddered, clenching his teeth tight around the protest that battered at his teeth. If Bucky were there, he’d say that it was her choice to make.
There was some time still before it would be ready but the children seemed happy enough snacking on the raw vegetables and fruits that Willamina had packed for them, and Stefen had surprised them all by cracking open the tin of small cakes Artur had been eyeing despite the fact that it would spoil their supper. Tony suspected that it had something to do with Maria's watery eyes and pouting lips, but far be it for him to suggest that Captain Rogers could succumb to the wiles of a girl no older than five.
The man laughed with surprising gusto for someone so thin, and the movement caused the gold cross he wore on a chain to slide out from beneath his shirt. He tucked it back in like he’d made the motion a million times before.
“Harold said he was in need of you.” Frau Hogan interrupted with another snap. “And while you are on your way, please alert the baroness of our guest. As I’m sure you were just about to do.”
She thought about secrets that must be kept at all cost, and the sacrifices that must be made to keep them safe.
Stark!” Nik demanded in harsh reply. “Think about your future. It will be very short, I guarantee, unless you step very carefully. You need to stay out of sight and slip out of the country the first opportunity you get or the reality is you will eventually be caught. Do you understand what I’m telling you?”
“So, that means it’s not impossible… there’s a chance, isn’t there? I could discover something too?”
Still, Tony was forced to concede that they were right, Stefen was well enough for Tony to take his eyes off of him for a few hours, to spend some time with the children if not to bathe and eat a hot meal.
She would.
She’d even given him one that was entirely in English. Though he still couldn't read it well yet, he got a delightful thrill thumbing through the pages and guessing at the pictures.
“Now that doesn’t seem fair.” Bucky growled. “You got a name I can use?”
“Yes, we’ll be fine watching them, Father.”
Or a deadly enemy.
Tony felt the familiar pang of old grief and shoved it too away. He wondered vaguely if Mrs. Rogers had had Italian in her blood and almost as soon as the thought came he dismissed it. Mrs. Rogers was a pure Austrian beauty, decidedly not Italian and certainly not a Jew, nothing like his mother. Salzburg’s national treasure would have had to have a proper Austrian on his arm.
He found the pills Frau Hogan had left on his desk and downed them. It took a moment but he managed to tame his sweat styled hair and gingerly switch his clothes for fresher less wrinkled ones. It was time he pull himself together, take care of the situation before it endangered his family any more than it already had. He would go to Vienna right away.
“Yes, who is it. Ona, who is it?” Magda called back, her fright making her impatient.
"I need you too," he managed to confess before he covered Steve's mouth with his, some presence of mind having him shift until he straddled Stefen, holding the majority of his weight away from his sore body.
This is Freddie at the Castle, reaching out to the INN. Wendy is home alone.
Was no one who they said they were anymore?
Steve looked the boy over, taking in his well-worn trousers and too big shoes. They looked to be for someone twice his age, but they were sturdy enough and looked like they’d survive long enough for him to grow into. Stefen could well imagine that he must have stuffed them full of newspaper to make up the difference.
“I'll write you with Falsworth’s response, but I do wish you’d give it to me Captain.”
She had always liked working with her hands. She could still recall the way her mother's hands used to feel. Soft. So different from her baka, whose hands had been worn and leathery, but similarly strong and clever. Her mother's hands had rarely been idle. Even after the war they'd stayed busy. Natacha had long suspected that her volunteer work as a secretary at the War Office involved more than just typing.
“You were late for our lesson so I came to fetch you.  A mouse ran across my shoe.”
It wasn’t bad… at least it wasn’t supposed to be; but it had felt bad, and it was nothing for the little ones to have seen, and if Frou Hogan knew she likely would not let Tony take them out of the house anymore and Péter wasn’t alone in his desire to escape the confines of their home.
“Enough,” Bucky barked, glaring around at them all. “Stefen’s going to be executed in five days, while we stand here with our thumbs up our asses. Call yourselves sons-of-whores for all I care, so long as you focus on the damn mission!”
“Please, stop. You mustn’t!” a shout burst from behind the closed door of Rogers room, the housekeepers voice carrying a sharp note of panic that sent a jolt up and down Dvorak’s spine.
Ian watched him work, eyes stinging for a completely different reason now, but it was easier this time to take a deep breath and just keep breathing.
He could try fucking German.
"I saw plenty of grenades back in the war," the ex-soldier grunted, focusing once more on Tony, his dark brows narrowing. "But nothin with a blast like that."
here. I’ve left family behind before and I don’t got it in me to do it again.” The words constricted in Bucky’s chest, like a sob, but he pushed them out anyway. Charlotte shifted, a piteous look crossing her beautiful face.
"I'll be back." He repeated without inflection, and then he turned and was leaving, disappearing down the hall in long strides without looking back.
had been hurt, protecting Steve’s children when he could have run. Should have.
“Anyway. For our women
“I don't make threats I can't keep, Captain. I am a man of my word.”
Pain sliced through his chest and Steve froze, his ears roaring with barley suppressed fury.
“How could you not notice!”
“So long as they don’t interfere with their regular school work; and they are never to sing in public. Good day, Herr Stark. You’re relieved.”
"It will be a great addition to the party." Steve heard himself say, smiling gratefully at Tony for all that he did for them before he took a bracing breath to say what he needed to say next.
Natacha, and Péter (Tony realized belatedly) were turned toward the open carriage door, their arms stretched out to catch as first Artur, then Maria and then – Tony's heart lurched in his chest at the sight – Ian tossed Sara into Natacha’s waiting arms before jumping down himself. Afraid of drawing the attention of the men at the worksite –
Of course, her parents would be cold to them, but if luck stayed on her side it would be out of their hands before they even realized what she was up to.
Péter's insides went cold, shock numbing him for a second before he sputtered, "They c-cant! Tony won't let them do that to us."
“Why are you wearing that old skirt?” Steve heard Tony ask from a distance, like the monk was speaking at the other end of a long hall even though he’d only moved the skant feet between the bottom of the stairs and the arch leading into the kitchen. “It’s at least three inches too small now.”
“Alright, yes. But it’s all the same. You won’t have any complaints in my bed.”
It was always crowded in Müttermilch this time of night, and Bucky was happy to see that this evening was no exception. Milch, as the locals called it, wasn’t the only pub house along the river but it was right on the dock and Etta (the mother in mother’s milk) made the best sausage in town, making it a popular choice for the sailors coming in off the Danube.
"That is awful!" he lamented, shoving the flask toward Tony who accepted it back with a chuckle.
“Very good Sir,” Herr Shultz answered with a nod of respect but Steve had already turned, headed for the elevators.
Yes, if Stark Industries could actually produce even half of Hitler’s desires, the German Navy would have no trouble at all battering its way all the way to Britain’s shores and beyond, but one look was all Tony needed to know they’d never get there.
Damn it! He had to. He wasn’t sure what would happen if he couldn’t force himself to say what he needed to say and make Tony understand. It was not his wish to die. If he had his wish, he’d be with Tony and the children forever.
Maria Santiago had left better than a forwarding address at the grand hotel. After speaking briefly with the matron at the front desk, and greasing the woman’s palm with more coins than he’d wanted to part with, they’d learned that Maria had indeed married years ago and left service at the hotel; but her daughter had come around the year before looking for a job and was now employed there.
On cue an alarm began to wail throughout the camp. Everyone within the ward seemed to freeze simultaneously, until the spell was broken by two soldiers banging through the doors carrying a limp body between them.
There was definitely something off about him. Drunk perhaps. He wouldn't be the first war hero to succumb to the drink. Tony’s fingers twitched at his sides noticing now that the captain was in the light of the entry that his skin had taken on a gray greenish tinge. He looked sickly and again Tony was drawn to compare the officer he’d met so briefly at the abbey and the man in front of him now. Yes, he was statuesque but it was stiff, controlled, with none of the grace he remembered from before.
Without any warning he went striding past them, stepping off the bank into the water with an exclamation at the temperature, not even bothering to strip to his underthings.
When they were done Bucky nodded slowly, satisfied, and straightened up, obviously preparing to go.
. Stop.”
(Romany) Christmas
Tony thought of all that Péter had lost over the years, all that he had been through recently and he thought he understood. Tony’s memory had always been sharp enough to preserve the past on its own, perfect as pictures. Sometimes he hated it, true enough, but he didn’t know what he’d do if he one day got his wish. If the memories started to fade and he found himself no longer able to perfectly recall the curve of his mother’s face or the slightly crooked way that Jarvis smiled.  There was more here than just a hobby for Péter.
“You never said where you got your bruise Tony.”
Right down to the furious way his lips tightened when he spotted Péter and his eyes took in Péter's swollen eye and the cuts on his face.
But Tony wasn’t a soldier. He didn’t have to see the horrors or face all the horrible parts of himself that war would bring out, and Steve didn’t
They had a few pounds of the hirsch left, but they were on their last can of vegetables. Not that the children would miss the mushy and pickled part of their diets, but they couldn’t just survive on smoked meat without inviting something like scurvy.
“Of course not to
“And you’re sure you’ll be able to send a message back?” Stefen asked, still looking hesitant but Tony heard the underlining urgency in his tone. “There is an important operation underway, something that could stop all this and prevent us having to go to war. My team must have a faster way to receive alerts from our contacts in British Intelligence.”
“They'll be long letters.”
No. It didn’t matter what Tony would do. He wasn’t there, and if Steve didn’t take control of himself soon he would be carted away to a sanitarium, stripped of everything he’d ever worked for, every bit of it earned with his blood. His children would be left defenseless all because Steve couldn’t keep his head in order for a few weeks on his own.
grown soft since the war. The stairs would probably do you in.”
Rage, he realized as the emotion broke within him like a wave, burning brightly at the edges of his vision.
“At risk?” Bucky scoffed. “They discover what we’re doing here and you, me, Stefen, and everybody else stupid enough to subscribe to that Mag is dead. You understand? It aint smart putting all our names in one place.”
and domestic.” Holmes continued with a poignant influence over the word foreign. “You will be dropped into Norway two hundred miles outside of Oslo, where your objective will be to go to ground, unannounced and undetected, until either the German threat to the royal family has been neutralized or it becomes necessary to extract the royal family and bring them to asylum. Whichever comes first.”
. It would be a shame to continue to allow weaker genetics into the Wehrmacht.  Steve could have thrown his plate at the wall, had to clench his hands in his lap to repress the urge. And the hell just continued.
"Experience would have us believe that, Artur.” Tony agreed with a small smile. “We will fill everyone with lots of sweets and wine, fill the halls with song, and I don’t think anyone will have room to feel bad. And long after the snows have melted and we're tucked away in our swiss chalet, they'll remember how wonderful the night was and how you all sang so beautifully."
Arturs face fell, crestfallen, and Tony laid a palm on top of his head.
Bucky, still in his undershirt, swept the tray out of her hands, grinning at her lazily. He'd always enjoyed Steve's celebrity, got a kick out of it in a way Steve never could, but this morning he seemed less inclined to play the monkey.
“Divine love.” He murmured. “I told you one day it would touch you.”
Right, clearly it was one of his brothers then. Likely the one who slept on the bed his eyes couldn’t seem to stop straying to.
“Is Péter home yet?” Steve turned to Natacha who was sitting on Bucky’s other side, pretending to still be reading a book. She closed it gently, lowering it slowly in a way that made him think she was bracing herself.
There was a belief among many religions that fasting helped to bring one’s mind closer to God’s. Indeed, it was a distressingly popular notion that only by forgoing all distractions of the flesh was it possible for a man to reach enlightenment. Tony was willing to grant the idea a nod. After all, he used to forget meals entirely while tinkering away in his workshop at the abbey; but he’d emerged from the workshop at Bruce’s insistence often enough only for Farkas to turn around and declare a fast, that Tony hadn’t really bothered too hard to observe them in the past.
“My orders were to search the entirety of the house.” The officer insisted his spine stiffening and tone broking no argument. He was young and not especially a tall man, but he made up for it with the straightest posture that Tony had ever seen. Every last inch of his uniform was crisp and not a hair looked out of place beneath his cap. If not for the fact that it was a soft honey brown, he would have made for the model Aaryn. God help them, but he was entirely too earnest.
A helpful little voice that sounded an awful lot like brother Fil whispered that it would look like a one-way ticket to a prison cell, if he were lucky. But Stefen wasn’t pulling away or showing any signs of uncertainty. He’d just asked Tony to go to Germany, simply because he’d enjoy the company.
He should wait, he thought even as he slid onto the bench, fingers twitching with anticipation. He should wait until he had permission, or at the very least until after he was introduced to the family. Still, he found himself sliding his palm over the lid, found his fingers continually brushing the pale keys that begged to sing for him.
~*~*~
Steve tilted his head towards the door.  “A word, please.”
After another long moment he grunted; lips tight around another edict, "You can’t let them out of your sight, Stark.”
The tour had taken the Rogers family from the city of Munich, to the smaller town of Ulm and up on into Stuttgart. From Stuttgart to Frankfurt, then over to Hanover, up to Berlin and then down to Leipzig and finally to the city of Nuremberg.
It was true, he and Rogers shared little in common, however they both had an eye for people. Rogers had known, god damn it, because he was the sort who listened and looked. He knew Dvořák's views on they way things were being handled. And Rogers had met his wife. He'd met Helena on several though brief occasions and had still managed to take away the truth of her parentage, or rather lack of one.
“Are you cold?” Stefen asked beside him, one hand already reaching to unbutton the jacket he wore. Tony stayed his hand with a shake of his head and a reproachful frown.
Natacha stilled, eyes going wide as she glanced worriedly at Péter who shifted uncomfortably.
"No. What about the others?  Shouldn't I be here for them, like you said?" He asked in a quiet voice.
~*~*~*~*~
It was all too much. The moment the last course was served and Steve saw a chance to excuse himself he took it, leaving his chair and claiming a need to find a bathroom. He went promptly to where Charlotte and the children were seated, uncaring how it looked, and telling them plainly that it was time to say goodnight and to follow him to their rooms.
“There isn’t time for that. They’ll be caught. Our only chance is to hide them.” Tony insisted. “I’ll need the key to the attic.”
"Is Tony with him?" She asked, unsurprised by the surprise that flashed through his eyes before he replied that the less she knew the better. He always assumed she was stupid. Like she didn't know what it meant when they all met in secret and Bucky and Tony disappeared at the same time.
Tony had never given his heart to this nation, so it wasn't his arms she lay dying in. That was a private hell for the ones who had loved her, especially so for those who had bled for her. And it seemed perfectly clear now, that Captain Rogers, man of war, would try and avenge her.
“It’s like you thought. They aren’t taking any chances. They’ve pulled over seventy men to escort the captain to Berlin. It’s going to be a damn parade. They want the whole world to see.”
The last one (thankfully) was a little girl all of three who toddled forward belatedly at her siblings prompting with a huge baby toothed grin and failed to introduce herself. According to the embarrassed looking Captain the blond little cherub's name was Sara.
“I could ask the same about you?” Tony replied after a long moment, head cocked as he considered Steve. The dim light made his eyes seem liquid. Or maybe that was the Genever. Steve just stared at him. Why was he here? It seemed too obvious to even state. He was where Tony was. Tony should know that, but he didn’t seem to as he huffed twisting in his seat to reach for the bottle.
"Captain."
“I'm a man of peace, cap.” Tony replied coolly.
This chapter depicts scenes of torture, death, child endangerment and historical events related to the genocide of the Holocaust. Please read with care. Remember how we said this was a war story? Well it's here. Liberties have been and will be taken in the area of historical accuracy. That said both of us feel strongly about respecting the past and have done extensive research to that effect. We continue to believe that this story is important in our present.
Sam hesitated, aware that he'd overstepped an invisible line. It was a line neither of them normally bothered to toe but normal wasn't the usual so much anymore.
“A week.” Tony almost jerked in surprise at the sound of his voice. Stefen blinked and he was looking at Tony again, rather than through. “A week Tony. If we can’t find another way out before then…” he trailed off and Tony jumped to fill in with a smile of relief.
Steve cocked his head, attention snared.
“They will need to see some proof of course, but I am willing to relay your terms to my superiors. Let's discuss them shall we, Mr. Stark?”
“If we’re still here in ten hours, Frauline Boehringer is going to bring us fresh baked pie and a seasoned roast. No more of this goulash shit.” Bucky explained to the curious eyes that met him and Parodi lifted his cup in a mock salute, the slush inside slopping loudly. Steve licked his dry lips, his stomach rolling over itself in protest. Sweat trickled down his face and he wiped it away, agitated.
He’d worked through the night, but it was still too early for breakfast so Tony had given himself the grand tour again, moving through the rooms of the house feeling largely like an interloper as the staff went about preparing the house for another day. He made his way down to the kitchens, out to the garage and the gardens, and eventually back to his quarters to wash before breakfast.
A family then, maybe. Maybe not. Maybe just three people in the wrong place.
“It will be nice getting back to work for a while,” he admitted. “I’ve got to get some things in order but I’ll be back.”
She pressed her lips together, just like she always did when she was trying hard to be a lady, usually with dirt under her nails.
The Castle repeats.
And so what if it had never occurred to him to tell Tony he intended to ask the baroness to marry him? It wasn't as if Tony could marry him, and it wasn't like Tony hadn't been aware he and Charlotte were seeing each other.  Appearances had to be kept, and Stefen had said quite staunchly that appearances had nothing to do with how they felt about one another. Stefen had promised not to abandon him and he was a man who kept his word.
Who would find Péter? Who would be here to see him home or… receive his body? If it came to that.
Natacha had mulled it over for a moment before finally nodding in agreement to the deal, smoothing out the now wrinkled bundle and placing it back on top of the pile in her trunks. One more crisis dealt with Tony’s attention had been pulled away by the sight of Maria passing the door with an armload of books taller than she was.
Natacha felt her heart squeeze in her chest. Bucky had left around the same time that Tony had. He said it was to visit his sister in Poland but she'd known even then he was lying. He always looked you straight in the eye when he lied. Which would only seem strange if you knew him the way that Natacha knew him. Bucky spent a lot of time looking past people, sometimes just over their heads, or at their noses, but not in their eyes unless he thought it was necessary.
“Why do you think I am lying?” She asked, completely guileless. “It’s not the first time I’ve fallen.”
The crate tumbled over and sent them both tumbling to the ground with a painful thud. Steve rolled until his legs were free of it, and scrambled upon the ground, wet snow soaking through his trousers as he fought to sit up. She snagged him by the shoulders, and he batted her hands away, screaming in rage as he turned and grabbed her, shaking her.
“Stark is there some point to all this?” Rogers interrupted with a sigh and Tony blinked at him as if surprised to still see him standing there.
-The Cabin-
It was bad. Very bad, and Péter didn't want to listen when Bucky told him and Natacha to go to bed, but then Natacha told him they would if Bucky agreed to as well, and she begged Péter silently with her eyes to agree. Péter could see how exhausted his uncle was, and he knew Bucky wasn't going to get any rest unless he was forced into it.
Stefen let out a little gasp of dismay as Tony released his cock and went to his knees. The shock barely had time to register on his face before Tony was working his trousers down with impatient tugs.
But my wife... my daughter.” Dvorak bleated, crumbling to the floor as if his legs could no longer hold him and Bucky stared down at him in disgust. The man was completely broken. Bucky wanted to feel only revulsion for his weakness, for the selfishness that had brought him to this miserable state but that wouldn’t get him to talk and Bucky desperately needed Dvorak to talk. No, more than that. Bucky needed his help. One last coup, one last stand together. Not for Stefen’s sake but for Helene and Renee, Bucky slowly realized.
It was around that time that Tony let his wrench drop to the floor of the garage with a discordant clang and pushed himself out from under the car with a muttered curse.
“It’s in the math Pete. The fission of one atom of uranium two-thirty-five would generate how much energy?”
"Jann?!" Charlotte gaped at the woman, whom she now recognized under the layer of grime and shabby men's attire. Quickly, she rolled down her window and Janneke leaned against the door frame and poked her head inside.
“Are you done?”
“I’ve already told you. It’s just like last time.” Bucky tried to placate, but Kirk had never been a fool.
The judgment as well as the shrewdness in the girls tone was clear. Judging by the poor state of his clothing and the fact that he’d come from the abbey it was easy to assume he was some sort of ill-bred country yokel, a fool easily led by someone clearly as clever as Natacha Rogers. Tony smiled at her as he straightened up and shook his head just to see what she would do.
“Sir.” Steve greeted him, not advancing out of respect. They were comrades, but Philips was a friend first. Phillips had fought his battles and served his time. Steve would never presume to place him in any more danger than he volunteered for.
All his life.
Warnings: violence against the elderly is in this chapter as well as some pretty heavy antisemitic language.
“What boys?” the captain, no fool, demanded to know and Tony quickly tried to diffuse the situation.
“Mayer?” Bucky gapped. “You mean the Chief of the Abwehr?”
Steve glowered. He clenched and unclenched his hands, wishing that ridding himself of the unfortunate sense that Tony was making was as simple as beating it back. But there were things you couldn’t punch away.
“Steve, if you choose this fight, then I’m with you come hell or high water.” Tony ignored the ache to touch him, guessing that in this state it wouldn’t be welcomed. Instead he held Stefen’s gaze, encouraged by the way the captain’s eyes drank him in, the fire of rage slowly bleeding out of them as he hung on every softly spoken word that Tony uttered.
“Spare a mark sir?”
“You might not find them either.” Péter pointed out. The words hurt to say, but they would have hurt more just sitting in his chest. “If our father can’t…”
The medicine, once they’d hashed out the right balance, had helped to ease the congestion they could all hear in James lungs. For a few days he breathed easier and his coughing subdued, but then he caught a chill again and the wetness in his lungs returned, the coughing worsening with each day.
As Tony finally took his seat aboard the bus and watched the cobbled streets of Salzburg pass by his window he wondered when, if ever, the world would wake up from what felt like the longest of terrible dreams.
Her eyes narrowed even further, “I can learn both?”
There was only one place that Tony knew he could look for answers and that was Stefen's study. His very locked study. Good thing Tony hadn't met a lock yet that could keep him out.
Steve nearly dropped the strudel he'd been idly picking at, shocked at the sudden vulgarity.
“There is actually a world of difference. It’s a matter of mathematics Herr Bakhuizen, the concentration of bean versus the cut of milk and we mustn’t forget the variable of foam and spices, but I won’t burden you with the details because the honest truth is I couldn’t make a proper cappuccino without espresso. Sweet Mary mother of Christ, I’d make deals with the devil himself for a good espresso.” Tony sighed dramatically closing his eyes once more (not missing the incredulous expression that flashed over Bakhuizen’s face). On his right the captain huffed once more but Tony’s mouth turned up because he thought there was a decidedly amused ring to that sound now.
Bucky kept his posture relaxed, leaned up against the truck, one arm resting on a crate down inside the bed where his M18 waited. Just as expected one of the back doors opened and some arrogant prick in a uniform got out to demand they move, scowling suspiciously when Bucky played dumb as a rock and grunted in broken German that it was impossible, throwing in some polish insults while he was at it because if he died today then at least he died telling this fat little worm what a whore his mother had been.
“Evidently not. What is all this?” Steve demanded waving to all the boards and the tools scattered about. Now that he and Bucky were close he was somewhat alarmed to see Péter operating a heavy looking saw and the smooth handled chisel in Natacha’s hands had his heart racing.
“It’s a man on foot...” Scott announced a moment later and Bucky’s shoulders slumped with relief. It could be someone looking for the aid of the priest, or one of their informants returning to them. He hoped it was Jann, who often traveled dressed as a boy when she didn’t wish to be recognized.
Outside wasn't much better but there was less heat and press of bodies. Steve felt his breath come just a little easier. He looked out over the heads of people up at the swooping arches. He'd painted this station once, had at least a dozen sketches of it, yet as he looked out at the throng of people all jostling with their luggage and papers, their faces long and dark, olive and short, rosy white, a pallets of people all leaving Vienna, he couldn't help but think back to Sam’s words in the car.
She didn’t reply. Just leaned into him again, her gaze miles away.
Tony did know it. The grimy little window wasn’t big enough for a grown man to slip through even if they were to break it so Tony had never bothered to reinforce it.  By the time Nik had pinched his little underling from a traveling french circus it hadn’t even occurred to Tony to think about it. An oversight he’d have to correct.
"We learned about germs and how to spot the signs of sickness.” He explained. “An astute diagnosis to be sure. You may have a future nurse on your hands Cap."
Since first sight of the city Sam had become strangely talkative for a man who had stayed up into the early hours drinking with the staff. Despite his familiarity with the city Sam gave Steve the gran tour, as if these weren’t streets he’d walked a million times. The words seemed to trickle from him without stop, the pained pause coming every now and then when the automobile gave a particularly harsh rattle, the indication of a headache.
May God continue to keep you and your charges,
"If you were a decent man Tony, you'd make good on all that flirting you do and take the poor girl on a proper date." She said as she grabbed two bowels off the table, preparing to take them into the dining room.
"But Tony," James dragged out Tony's name in a whine long enough to almost make Tony regret giving it to him.
“Stark, water if y'a don't mind.” Bakhuizen directed firmly with military precision.
The room Bucky found Major Dvorak in was far from the lavish suites a man of his rank and prestige was used to, but it was no doubt the best room available so close to the camp at Dachau that could be acquired on short notice.
“Stefen?”
"I hope you don't mind that I told the children you'd be caring for them before we had a chance to speak." Stefen began as soon as the door had clicked shut and Tony shot him a peeved look.
Steve understood the subtle warning and swallowed down his ire, attempting to look more like he was enjoying himself.
"You should ask your uncle, or Tony. I've never been good at talking to woman. I still can't believe I managed to string two words together to talk to your mother." Da chuckled softly, working the needle deftly. Ian wrinkled his nose. He didn’t want to talk to those girls. James was much better at talking to people, girls specifically, and everyone adored Artur and Tacha. Ian just couldn’t seem to muster the courage, or the words. The words where the biggest problem.
"Good morning Da," he called out hopefully as Steve entered, taking a hasty sip from his mug as he pushed back his chair. "I couldn't sleep, so I thought I'd start my routine early this morning… with you. Natacha said you wouldn’t mind."
"Who?" Stefen demanded just as Bucky loudly challenged, "What do you mean us?"
"Are all these men truly necessary Captain?" Lt. Stevens asked, looking around at the line of police vehicles that had filled the drive that morning. There were three of them, at least two officers to each, not including the car that had brought Captain Arnold. It was overkill for a group of children, Deiter thought with distaste, eyes going to the small group huddled on the steps of the Villa in their winter coats. They looked miserable, but Deiter very much doubted their low spirits and red noses could be blamed solely on the cold. Baroness Schrader had been doing her best to cheer them since her arrival, but they'd been melancholy and full of complaints all morning. She was with the youngest boy now, Archer or something like that. She was whispering quietly to him, her gentle hands tucking the blond wisps of his hair beneath his cap.
Susann nodded, surprised but pleased.
Tony bent low to make it easier for him to slide it over his head. The buinokishti Stefen had made for him was long enough that Tony could have worn it over his hips like a belt. Around his neck it dipped low enough that Tony was sure he could wear it hidden under his shirt with nothing but a hint of the beads showing around his collar.
Maria was asking him to sing to them when Ian slipped from the bed, mumbling that he had to use the latrine. Tony was worried about him going outside alone in the dark, but it was easy to persuade him that he’d be fine on his own. He’d been out with Tony loads of times now, and often took the role of lookout when Tony had to be gone. It would have been silly for Tony not to trust him to relieve himself on his own and come right back, and Ian felt a brief moment of guilt for taking advantage as he made his escape down the ladder.
At the end of the evening Thor gave them all a warm goodbye but abandoned protocol altogether to hug Maria and call her ‘skatten min’.
Tony closed his eyes and did his best to chase away the vision of that world. But still the words scratched at his throat and slamming at the gates of his teeth.
What boy wouldn’t want to go, in pursuit of the prestige and power the Reich promised to those who proved to be the bravest and strongest, those willing and capable of sacrificing the most? The Führer called men like that the jewels of the nation. Men like Péter's father.
Irritation simmered low in his gut, a feeling that he realized had been growing since the night of their arrival. His fingers twitched with restless energy. He longed for something to do with his hands besides curl them into fists he was tempted to throw at the falsely smiling man at Charlotte Schrader’s side.
The back of the truck was wide open and through his bleary vision Steve could just make out a body laying in the snow, a red halo blooming around it.
But Steve could not lay still. He lay, a towel from the washroom over his face willing the chill to leave his body. Thoughts bounced through his head, never catching.
“Very well then. Captain Rogers, you told me once how much you love Austria, and I admired you for that, but you’ve left me no choice but to conclude that you must love your country more than you love your own children. And for that I say you are a fool.”
“Don’t be long, Major. An obedient dog is better than a dead one.”
Stevie.”
Honestly, even though it would bring its own set of troubles… Bucky was relieved.
Stanislov was caging him, Tony realized. He was making it impossible for Tony to deny his brilliance at the same time he was making himself irreplaceable.
“No, it’s just that I don’t think he likes pork at all.” He explained. “He never finishes it, just pushes it around on his plate.”
survive.” Tony replied with a sharp grin. “And though we may be on opposite ends of the goal, I will see that you survive. It is the curse of my love, Captain.” Stefen glared at him and Tony stared back, all smiles.
“After your mother died and you were gone, Signor Jarvis brought it to us with some of your mother’s things. He said one day he hoped you’d find your way back to it.”
Being a monk wasn’t all hymns and chants, it meant regular, sometimes grueling, charity work and other forms of community service. Tony had accompanied the other brothers to the local orphanages when they’d given lessons and sermons; so he’d met his fair share of the damaged and abandoned. Perhaps heart conditions weren’t the same in young adults as they were in infants but those children had been small, frail little things, and Péter was slight for his age but hardly in a way that struck Tony as unhealthy.
Steve nodded, at a complete loss for what to say next.
Tony threw back his head and laughed, clasping her smaller hands in his as he led her on a few more whirlwind turns.   He was happy he realized, marveling at the feeling bubbling up within his chest.  Somehow, in the middle of everything, he'd managed to find happiness where he'd never expected it.  When he'd left the abbey, he'd hoped to find himself on the nearest boat anywhere but Austria turned Nazi Germany, but now he couldn't think of any he wouldn’t have traded this moment for the world.
He’d ignored most of the traffic laws as he’d weaved through the busy streets towards the Grand Hotel (glad not for the first time that his uniform was enough for the police to look the other way) his rented motorbike humming beneath him in company with his thoughts.
At his answer she smiled and too a delicate sip of her drink.
It was quiet for a long moment while they both thought.
Indeed, Herr Hammer’s mouth was twisted up in an expression of intense disdain by the time that Tony reached him, leaving him with no doubt of the man’s feelings on the subject. Hammer turned wordlessly with a sharp click of heels and led Tony inside. Tony had grown up in a grand house so he was not afraid of coming off like an uncultured simpleton, on the contrary he had an appetite for the finer things in life that had gone largely unsatisfied behind the abbey walls.
“I’m sure you are.”
“Tony! I found goat tracks!” Artur, who had wandered off slightly to the right under a cropping of trees, exclaimed, turning to wave at Tony, who was guiding Maria setting up a snare for mountain hare. Tony had gifted the newly minted eight-year-old with a small magnifying glass for his birthday, which had come and gone in March.  All the children had helped in the creation of the gift. Even James, who was surly over the fact that for a few weeks a year he and Artur were the same age, and he could no longer insist that the younger boy was a baby.
There was a slight pause and then Ian heard a very familiar voice reply, “Yes. Thank god. Is he here?”
– that desolation punched through his chest, hot tears stinging the corners of his eyes. Whimpering desperately, he tried to push himself up and follow.
"Though I must say, I was tempted to believe that you were done with me already when you were so cold to me."
~*~*~
“I wouldn’t dream of it. My aunt is there to keep an eye on things. Besides, being with you holds off the lecture I’m sure she has prepared for me.”
Like hell they had been.
Tony was as anxious as he was curious to know what purpose Stefen could have discovered in the last few weeks to bring about these changes, because it struck him as eerily familiar.
Upon first arrival a lieutenant so and so met them in a small envoy of open cars, and drove them to the main building in a cluster of long square buildings doing their best to blend in with the coastline. Inside the base was just as utilitarian, and it wasn’t until they were escorted to an area of meeting rooms clearly set aside for the big brass that things began to get a little more ostentatious. The furnishings were comfortable, and the windows provided a picture-perfect view of the sea and the rest of the base sprawling around it.
Natacha stared at him, watching the way he formed each word. He was direct because Father was always direct. Mother had said it was the soldier in him. She'd said he couldn’t always leave the captain at the door. Back then she’d said they could help him by not banging about and making loud or sudden noises and by giving him extra long hugs. She remembered liking that, believing with a little girl’s selfishness that she was actually helping her father with the simple act of wrapping her arms around him at any given opportunity.
“Keep them off of the lake.” Steve warned, frowning at the thought. “It should be frozen this time of year but weak spots can form.”
There was a sound just outside the door and everything in Steve froze. Even though the woman hadn’t come yet the fear was the same every day. Any sign of movement that wasn't his own or Patroche could mean the end for him.
“Natacha, you can hardly tell. Your father hasn’t even noticed.”
"You've seen him! Bak-Jam-
He barely turned to look at Tony when he told him he should go.
"I wouldn't want you to think I was broken beyond repair."
Are you sure you don't want a shave?" Stefen paused the razor blade in his hands to twist toward Tony who was just finishing tucking his shirt into his slacks. Tony made a face at him and Stefen's smirk widened into a smile, a low chuckle rumbling in his chest.
It was that jackass stubborn look he got right before he did something stupid.
The shout exploded from her in a burst of sound as Charlotte straightened her back, planting her hands on her hips and glaring at him with naked fury. Silence echoed in the room the only sound coming from the children. Artur, sniffling, Maria’s soft whimper. It was all white noise to him as he stared back at her in horror at himself, his heart hammering away in his chest.
“I believe dinner will be served. I know I’m famished. Care to take a walk with me?” the captain asked and Steve’s reply was quick.
ABösendorfers. Cherry wood that was nearly black it was so dark. He'd never seen one up close, constrained to watching the gleaming black wood from afar in festival halls and dimly lit concert arenas (Tony had been in attendance for charity work of course, though such expensive charities had only received Nik’s stamp of approval few and far between). He slid his hands over the heavy keys surprised when they came away clean. What he wouldn't give to play a Grand Bösendorfers: clean lines, the tone alone was superior to anything Tony had ever laid his hands on.
Natacha and James were slower to unthaw than the others, unwilling to forgive Tony for denying them news regarding their fathers' fate and not inclined to indulge in what to them seemed like the baseless hope the others were keen to rest on.
“I know you’re old enough to understand what’s coming. I know you know that in war there are no guarantees.” He said, his voice hard but not distant, commanding but passionate enough to border on harsh. She didn’t flinch but she could not help the way her hand shook when he took it and pried her palm open.
As Stefen continued to grill their escort, Tony smiled to reassure them that everything would work out, though he had no real certainty of that fact himself.
“Certainly not, you men can save all that business for some other time.” She said airily, her cheeks flushed, betraying her eagerness to stir the conversation away from Stefen and she turned to the tall fair-haired woman next to her.
Péter jerked out of whatever daze had gripped him, his head whipping around to look at them, cheeks fire engine red.
Sam’s voice called out to him from across the tracks, prompting Steve to straighten up and look for him. He wasn't hard to find standing out amidst a group of pale faces lining up to board the train.
Steve was bone tired, but he’d woken just as the sun began to brighten the sky the same way he did every morning, and he set about dressing for his morning exercise regime with the same steadiness. He could not afford to be dissuaded, even by the weather. The war would come regardless of whether or not he was training with his men.
"It will be all right, Tony,” Stefen said in this infuriatingly gentle tone, like Tony was some fretful woman.  Tony rolled his eyes, frustrated realizing that Stefen was only making good on his promise to keep Tony from worrying. “I didn't bring you here to try and talk us out of it-" Stefen began with the familiar firmness of command and Tony waved him to silence with an exasperated sigh and interrupted.
Steve nodded, giving the woman’s arm a grateful squeeze and she stepped back just as Herr Hammer reached them. The butler looked a mix of flustered and indignant.
“The rom follow few laws, but they live by the code, the
Olasz words floated back to him over the screaming. They’d intended this, Steve realized with cold horror. The Reich had wanted this to happen and Olasz had been trying to warn him.
“Let’s just say I have an investment I want to take care of. Talk to me.”
“The car! We need the car!”
Both times he’d stood there until the cold numbed his face, taking in Artur on tip-toes, James and Ian causally squabbling over the subject matter, their breath puffing in white clouds in front of them, needing the proof that they were safe there with him and alive.
But Charlotte was looking at him with warm eyes, fondness that wasn’t cemented in any one reality but dreaming, seeing all the possibilities real or imagined.
"I mean he probably knows where you've been. He's not going to stick around waiting for the shoe to drop." Bucky insisted as gently as he could manage because Steve was taking this whole thing much harder than he’d expected. Bucky privately didn’t think he was that lucky but he hoped he was right. Stark had proven himself scrappy and the first rule of being scrappy was being smart. The second was saving your own skin, which was pretty much the first rule. With any luck Stark had packed his bags as soon as Steve had left to meet Coulson and was long gone by now. Of course, then there was Steve who was a rule breaker on the best of days Bucky thought with tired amusement. With Bucky’s luck the idiot would just do something crazy like go after him.
~*~*~
So this chapter is so long we split it into two parts, which means that you'll be getting another chapter sooner rather than like in two months from now. Thank you again for sticking with us and our hectic schedules. Your wonderful comments and insights give us life! *Once again a warning for period typical responses to PTSD and other psychological disorders.*
Steve stepped forward, opening his mouth to demand to know what was going on but he was cut off by the door swinging open announcing that the Mayor had finally arrived. Hasenkamp strode in briskly clutching at a brief case, his puffy brow glistening with sweat despite the cold outside.
“- on the small side.”
"Perhaps it will give the Major comfort to have a familiar voice near." Dvorak filled in, unspoken command behind each word. Fischer's eyes met his and held. The man might have private orders, but Dvorak was still the senior officer in the room.
Péter could have just said a healthy 'fuck you' and saved them all time. But as he was Peggy's son as well as Steve's he wisely kept his mouth shut and his gaze blank.
“You'll have to undo your shirt,” she said, her nimble fingers already undoing his waistcoat. Steve let her, keeping his face turned away.
“Of course. You’re a young woman now, and heaven knows that’s not a soldier’s expertise.” Frauline Werner reached out to cover Natacha’s hand with her own, the way mama used to.
James shot up almost before she finished talking, troding on Tony’s feet in his haste to follow the woman as she turned back around towards the doors; but Stefen blocked his path with a raised arm planted firmly in the center of his chest.  He pushed James behind him as he stood, and the boy pouted as he rubbed at his chest but wisely fell into line behind his father without complaint. Stefen cleared his throat, and Catherine who had already managed to get a good deal ahead stopped in the middle of the aisle to look back. She seemed surprised to find them where she left them.
“Virginia I’ve just come from town. I called earlier about the milk and eggs that should have been delivered and never heard back. Which was so odd I just knew something had to be going on. You’ll never believe but they’ve arrested Herr Boesch!”
Unbeknown to the rest of the world a scout watched the odd pair enter the church from the upstairs window adjacent to the steeple. He took note of the color of the woman's lips, relaxing marginally as he turned from the window and gestured to the other men occupying the storage room. It was an old office, perhaps used by the priest once upon a time before the addition of the new sanctuary. It was used now to store odd pieces of furniture and other odds and ends. And for the last month it had been the primary headquarters for the resistance effort to rescue Major Rogers.
There had been no lessons for his siblings that morning. They’d all come back to the sitting room after lunch to continue listening to the news broadcast while they waited for father to come back. All except for the baroness who had insisted she must check on her home in Vienna and had set out with Herr Hogan not long after Frau Hogan had broken the news to her.
Steve didn’t wait to watch him disobey the order. The hall outside the bedroom was still dark and empty but Steve could hear faint sounds floating up the stairs at the end of the short hall. He was the earliest habitual riser, but sometimes Tony’s grandmother’s back gave her trouble sleeping. She liked to make a drink and read her bible in the kitchen. Steve found her there, and to his immense relief Natacha was there too, drinking from a steaming mug and nibbling on a plate of the morning bread Antonia had baked the night before.
“I wouldn’t change it Stefen, but there was much I did in my search to find acceptance, far before I was truly ready for it. I’m not without bruises. I would have that different for you. Very different.”
Tony strode the rest of the way across the room and thrust the journal toward Steve and Steve stared down at where it pressed against his chest, jaw ticking. He was tempted to slap the damn thing away and grab Tony by his lapels. Tony was standing so close Steve could smell the wine on his breath as well as feel his body heat. If Steve kissed him now he bet he could make Tony go weak at the knees again. The bed was right there, and once he had Tony in it, the reckless fool wouldn’t be able to talk anymore.
These waters were safer than not while Italy still claimed neutrality in the conflict, but neither country was foolish enough to leave them unpoliced, and the fear of suddenly being fired upon hung over their heads. If Tony strained his ears, at times he could catch snippets from the radio, which brought harrowing tales of German forces beating back allied troops and gaining more ground by the day.
Natacha heard Hortense scurry from the room, but she didn’t look at her or Willamina. Instead she glared at the spot where the pots hung above the sink, her eyeballs hot and itching. Pressure ballooned in her chest, threatening to burst at any moment and she stood there rigid, hands curled into claws, afraid to make even the slightest movement.
“We need your help.”
Technically the house was his, held in trust along with Stark Industries until Tony’s death or the end of his voluntary confinement at the abbey, whichever came first; but like the company, Tony would have had to work within the law to claim it. Which meant that from the day Stanislov’s hired thugs had murdered Yinsen and chased Tony behind abbey walls, everything there had belonged to him.
Well, Tony thought as he stood soaking it all in, at the very least he wouldn't be uncomfortable.
“It’s the artillery.” Stanislov admitted with a disappointed sigh. “We can’t figure out how to get the firepower he wants without sinking the damn boats, and we can’t produce the boats fast enough anyhow.”
“But Rachel insisted, and the Phuri Dae warned that terrible luck would follow if he repaid Sara’s kindness by allowing her child to die. And so, the Rom Baro welcomed Sara to his clan, and that is the story of how your Baka lost her family and found it again. I know it is true because I was there, I am the baby that Sara had with the potter. I saw them and ate with them.”
He’d not felt this way about anything in so long, and for every reason that it wasn’t to be he also wanted to enjoy what he could have for as long as he could have it.
And Stefen could never really be sure after that which of them he was reassuring, Stefen or Ian, but the words washed over him and holding the man’s gaze he gently pushed Ian away, watching as the boy gently drifted into the monks waiting arms.
Willamina and Frou Hogan were fawning over the little ones in the kitchen, wiping sweaty brows and tear stained faces, griping about heat exhaustion and Herr Stark’s irresponsibility; because neither Péter nor Natacha had dared breathed a word about what had really happened.
In its way it was perfect that Stefen already had so many children. He was not likely to want more.
Steve would have to go to St. Péter’s and speak with the abbot. If Tony had ever made it to Engzell Abbey Farkas was the only one who might know.
“I won’t listen to him!” James announced suddenly from where he stood, glaring at the floor. Ian felt his cheeks heat in embarrassment.
"We've heard quite a bit about you.”
from Ian’s arms, careful of the loose pages he’d stuck between the two more solid sections.
Stark would take care of the children. He believed that much. He’d never admit to such out loud, but in that way, Steve had chosen his unclean lover well. Whatever else the man’s faults, Bucky was certain he’d never leave the children. And if there was anyone smart enough to find a way out of the reach of the Reich it was probably going to be Antony Stark.
Frau Hogan looked as if she would have gladly wrestled a bear in that moment, had it a mind to cross her, so Tony believed her and stayed quiet. But she had it wrong. He wasn’t out to hurt any of the Rogers children. Their father did not need his assistance in that regard. Tony had only been trying to help, to ease the burden of their loneliness.
There was silence so thick Tony felt it in his bones before she finally offered.
“I don’t believe I have to answer that.” The monk, whose name must be Nik growled. “What are you doing here Stark? I thought I made it clear to Major Roger’s how dangerous – ”
Steve nodded struck by the sudden urge to touch Sam, to snatch hold of his coat sleeve and keep him there.
Tony turned the pistol over in his hands. Margrit Rogers had a pistol? A bubble of laughter tickled his gut and he quickly staunched it. Of course she’d had a pistol. It was strangely easy to imagine the beautiful woman in the old photograph pointing a pistol at someone. Thinking of her daughter, Tony would place good money on Margrit Rogers suffering no fools. He wondered how she’d taken to Stefen’s moods, if he’d always had them, or if they were a scar of war. He wondered with some mirth if she had ever turned the pistol on Stefen in jest. God knew he could tempt a man at times.
He was suddenly profoundly glad for that.
His thoughts scatted like kicked marbles as Tony cradled his face once more and pressed in close so that they were slotted together, breathing in each other’s air. He felt Tony shiver despite the hot heat seeping in from where his chest, arms and groin pressed against Steve. Maybe it was the other way around. Maybe he was the one shivering and maybe it was his heat Tony was soaking up. Or maybe it was both, the chill deep in both their bones driving them close and closer together to share one continuous cycle of brightly burning heat. It was just proof wasn’t it? They were stronger together than apart.
"I need to see the abbot!" Tony immediately demanded, and the severe looking monk reared back, his eyes widening in shocked recognition.
His da was afraid.
“Is that safe at this hour?”
He had a fever again. Today wasn't a blood day, where they took their needles and their tubes and sucked him dry. Where they left bruises the size of coins on his arms and wrists. No, today was another test day. It always started the same way. Dragged from bed at dawn, and injected with another strange cocktail. The doctors gave it time to settle in before doing a final check on the subjects. They examined his pupils, tugged at Steve’s arms and wrote down their findings. Whatever they were putting inside him always burned through his veins and stung his eyes like acid.
“Presto, presto. We're being asked to march. Let’s clear the front hall and get everyone settled in." Herr Stark continued cheerfully, and the children flocked to him, dragging their suitcases and lining up before him like well-trained puppies. Charlotte would have smiled if she were not so focused on Stark.
“Some things can’t be put back.” Stefen’s voice sounded like gravel, he cleared it and continued gaze firmly locked with Tony's.
And Stark, damn him, would simply not leave him in peace.
The question was how.
She thought about Herr Stark and all of the dangerous things that he had said and she thought about her Baka and dancing in the music room. She thought about watching her mother getting paler and paler in the bed, and her promise to take care of her father.
“Whole caravans shipped off to god knows where Stevie! My father. My sister. The Uncles. You think I don’t got people to worry about?”
“Don’t be sorry, Cap.” Tony rolls his shoulders, as though shaking off the conversation, then ducks out from under the armour. “Thanks for the help.”
“Can I kill this?”
“And yet I can’t go through a warzone without it,” he sighs. He steps back into the armour, hissing as the sharp edges of the broken plating score into his skin, notching the edge of his scapula. “Ow, fuck. Cap, you’re gonna come with me, yeah? Watch my back?”
“Ohmygod,” Tony is saying, keeps saying, because he’s never been with someone who could do this to him. He’s been fucked against the wall before, sure, but Steve’s got Tony’s thighs over his shoulders and is holding him six feet up the wall like it’s nothing. Tony’s ankles are still trapped by his jeans pooled above his sneakers. His wrists are tied, and he is absolutely at Steve’s mercy. Who knew Captain America was such a kinky motherfucker?
Loki hums, eyes fixed on where his finger is disappearing into Tony’s body. He rocks with it, curling one calf around Loki’s shoulder. Loki presses a kiss to the inside of his knee, a small grin on his face. He adds another, fingers circling teasingly before they press inside, and Tony stretches his right leg out to the side and pushes into the stretch.
“Sorry,” Steve says, looking at a spot vaguely over Tony’s shoulder.
“Agent Romanov has expressed some confusion that you obeyed Captain Rogers’ orders during the battle with The Wrecking Crew, but I doubt she suspects the truth.”
Natasha is sitting in the dark library when he arrives, two steaming cups on the small table next to her. Tony takes the adjoining armchair and grabs one of the mugs, inhaling the sweet scent of chile and mescal and cocoa.
“Probably.”
“It started as a way to try to…I don’t fucking know,” Tony breathes. He rubs a hand over his face, suddenly, looking exhausted. “Fuck.”
And then he vanishes. Because he’s a fucking asshole, and a load of trouble, and Tony hates him.
“Sir.” JARVIS pauses, hesitant, and Tony turns to the nearest camera and offers a raised eyebrow. “He is bringing dinner for the both of you. I suspect it is an apology.”
“Come on,” Tony said quietly, leading Steve out of the elevator and into the living room, past the kitchenette and into the bedroom. “J, get the lamp for me? Low. Steve, sit your butt down on the bed.”
Tony thinks, glancing at the nearest security camera and offering JARVIS a nod.
Yes, that is Miss Ursula Bliss, for anyone who caught that. She's so annoying and yet so lovable. Some dialogue is obviously taken from Ultron, and that last bit is a riff off of
“Some days I think I’m the one who needs reminding,” Steve admits. Sam snorts at him.
Steve intentionally fumbled one of the servers, making the closest SHIELD agent scramble forward to get underneath it. She glared at him when she pulled it out of his arms, and Steve shot the nearest security camera a jaunty little grin.
Tony rubs a hand over his mouth and walks through the bedroom into the ensuite, shedding his clothes and tossing them into the laundry basket as he moves through the room. Loki is sitting on the marble slab of the sink counter, ankles crossed and swinging, and Tony takes a moment in the doorway to stare at him, the easy grace and the smile. He glances down at the floor, and Tony has a moment of déjà vu, mind flicking back to that first moment in the tower. Tony had stripped his suit as Loki watched, and he’d glanced away, almost demure. He’d been smiling then, too.
“When SHEILD said they needed my tech for prison safety, I didn’t think this was where it was going,” Tony says, tossing his copy of the folder they’ve all been given onto the conference table. In retrospect, he isn’t sure why he’s surprised, but he’s definitely pissed. “You double cross me, and then you wanna cry foul when you muck it up? That’s not how this works, boys.”
and began pulling off her clothes, changing them out for an embroidered silk robe. “I didn’t use to get these before I had you, you know.”
Tony ignores Clint and Thor’s departure and pokes Steve again, twisting in his hold and laughing when Steve grabs for his wrist and misses. “Too slow, Rogers!”
“He’s bleeding!” Tony snarls, and Loki tilts his head to the side.
Remember to check the warnings if you need those because this is the chapter where they're relevant.
“Well,” Tony tries, “I was. But uh.”
"I'm not an Avenger," she says. "I can take a cab, don't worry."
Unfortunately, the curse had definitely counted Steve’s comment about Tony finding him when he was ready as a command, which was why Steve was here, lifting huge plates of plexiglass with his ridiculous biceps and generally being attractive and gregarious and puppyish all over the damn place. Steve had been delighted to hear about the project, being an Irish-American himself of course, and had come to feed Tony at the height of his engineering craze. Within two hours, the team had nominated him as the Grand Marshal of the SI Saint Patrick’s Day Parade Float, complete with a sash they’d made from swathes of plastic they’d salvaged from the plexi packaging and a terrible cardboard crown.
“You’d have to register by virtue of your technological mastery,” Hill explains, and Tony snorts.
“Your bonding did not hurt,” Thor said, a knowing smile on his face, but Steve couldn’t even foster a blush at the teasing. “You and Tony, you frequently lavish attention on your mating marks. It is pleasurable to you, both emotionally and physically.”
Steve stills, fingers curled so carefully around the edges of the tray. He's already halfway to the door. Tony doesn’t even know where he got a serving tray from. He’s not looking at Tony at all.
“I think a lot of Jews would think so. Gay men and women. Romanis. The disabled.” He realises he’s preaching to a man in a wheelchair, then, and stops himself. “Sorry, I just. We’re talking about Nazis, professor.”
Loki folds into his arms, smaller than Tony thought he could become. He, like all Asgardians, had seemed larger than life during The Battle and the events proceeding it. He was tall, imposing, regal. At first Tony had thought maybe it was the by-product of royalty, but even Thor’s merry band of men-plus-one had a presence to them that was undeniable;
Steve clamped his fingers down on Tony’s hips, possessiveness tangling its way through his insides and snarling up his chest. Tony was so experienced when they’d first starting dating. He’d never imagined that there was something he could do for Tony that hadn’t been done by someone else, only that he’d have to learn to do everything so well that Tony couldn’t remember anyone before Steve. To know that he was the only person to ever take Tony’s knot in his mouth made him whine, and he slid one hand down between his legs and under his waistband to touch himself. He wanted to come for Tony, while they were tied like this. He wanted to cry and groan and choke on Tony’s cock as he came, to feel him so deep in his throat that Steve couldn’t swallow properly, just had to take it. He could hold his breath for nearly an hour, if necessary, maybe more, and Steve wanted it. He wanted it so much.
“Oh, well. Tony said they wanted him, and they weren’t going to be paying attention to me at all. And Tony said he trusted my brain. So while they were-” There was a crackle of static, and Steve frowned and waited. “Sorry about that. We figured if I was real good they’d stop watching me so well after a while. So while they were
Eventually, Tony’s back gave out, and he collapsed back to the bed like his strings had been cut. He looked absolutely floored when Steve glanced up at him, reaching down with shaky hands to brush Steve’s hair back from his forehead.
Tony chokes out a laugh.
“I had questions, about the injections,” Steve tried to explain, and he sounded pleading even to his own ears. “You have such a history of- well, no. I shouldn’t blame you. I’m not, I just want you to understand, I thought something was wrong maybe, and you weren’t telling me. You never
“You give people things to tie them to you, because you don’t trust them to stay with you
“But because she made this statement, you’re questioning that.” The professor nods, taking a sip of tea and leaning back in his chair. “You know, surely, that you are surrounded by a particularly unusual group of people.”
“So you think the draft should be reinstated?”
“It’ll be okay,” Franklin tells him. He squeezes Steve around the neck as tightly as his little arms can manage. It’s plenty tight for a child. “Wait here, okay?”
“When they are well enough to attend lessons I imagine you must enjoy your pupils.” The woman clicked her tongue and there was something secretive in her eyes that set Tony’s teeth back on edge.
Vengeance may have no wrath like a woman scorned, but no greater love on earth exists but that between a mother and her child. Or so they said. It certainly seemed that way for Charlotte. Natacha would be clever to keep her options open. There was no telling what the future would bring now. She and her siblings might need Charlotte one day.
“We’re ready. You read Ssgt. Zimmerman’s reports. We’re as ready as we’re ever going to be. They’re not estimated to be arriving until late evening. Yah wanna just sit around and pick your ass’s until then?”
He’d come so close to-
"Listen to me boys," Stefen spoke very quiet. "They had no choice. You understand? The Germans will not take no for an answer. It was either sign or face prison."
“Shhh. Do you want all of Austria to hear you?” Natacha shushed them with a rebuking stare in Tony’s direction as he let James slide carefully to the floor. “James said we have to be careful we’re not heard.”
Tony almost dropped her he held her at arm's length so fast, wrinkling his face. She sneezed again only this time he could hear a distinct giggle in the gurgling. She was grinning, or so he thought. It was hard to tell with her stringy wet curls obstructing her face.
in a box - and I fucking can’t and won’t live another day without you! I love you! Happy?“ Steve yelled back. He runs his hand over his eyes, wiping his tears away.
Bruce took off his glasses and rubbed the bridge of his nose, this can’t be true, this has to be a nightmare. First they lost Tony in a sorry attempt of rescue and now they failed Steve too and all they could do now is watch him die slowly.
„Tony!“ he gasped breathless. There he was, his husband, lover, his better half. Dressed in one of his fancy black custom tailored suites which hugged him in all the right places, a white silk shirt and a purple tie.
After reading the lines she tossed the letter aside and ran a shaking hand through Steve’s hair, a single tear dropped on his face. „Clint, when Steve is right, there is nothing we can do, we are too late.“ she whispered sadly. He gritted his teeth, „Son of a bitch!“
Steve
Steve jumped out of the bed and crashed into Tony’s arms with tears in his eyes. He pulled him tight, capturing Tony’s lips in a devouring and hopeful never ending kiss, oh god he had missed this so much - kissing him, touching him, smelling him.
„No, you can’t be serious. You are Captain fucking America, Steve! You can’t let them down, what were you thinking?“ „The Hell I am, I am Steve Rogers your fucking
Tony broke the kiss first and shoved him slightly away, resting one hand on Steve’s chest. „Steve, what are you doing here?“ He asked eyes wide in shock. „You aren’t meant to be here, your heart is still beating.“
Please, don’t make any attempts to save me, it won’t work. I found a secret serum, in one of Hydras Laboratories, designed to end the life of enhanced humans - people like me - in case they became a threat for them. It works, it’s almost painless and once injected there is no way to stop the effect.
. He shakes his head in denial.
„Ehh Nat, you should read this..“ Clint padded her shoulder and handed her a letter -
- i found some secret files about the effects and how it works, it’s almost painless but 100% effective in the end. The only drug to kill a super soldier. There is no bouncing back from this.“ he huffed and almost smiled.
„I know.. but..“ he whispers, looking down at the hand that is still pressed tight against his heart, avoiding Tony’s staring gaze. He couldn’t say anything, every word died on his tongue.
.. this is a fucking nightmare was all she could think.
. „I informed doctor Banner and a medic team, Miss Romanov. But Captain Rogers heartrate and bloodpressure are still dropping on a fast pace. I may alert you that you should use CPR anytime soon.“ informed the AI.
„Steve, what are they talking about?“ he faced his husband waving his hand between Natasha and Bruce. Steve sighed and ran a hand through his hair, „Look, they talk about a secret Hydra serum that I found during a mission several years ago. It was the last veil, next to 4 empty ones and 4 dead super soldiers in one of Hydras labs. No one knew that there was another veil left with this stuff, not SHIELD, not anyone -
I don’t know where to start. I know that „i‘m sorry“ won’t make anything better.
Tony let’s his eyes wander to their bed, spotting Steve’s body, lying motionless on top of the white sheets, one could think that Steve is just sleeping peacefully - not on the brink between
The kiss was soft and so full of love, want and eternity.
„Jarvis! What happened? Oh my god Steve?!“ Natasha practically screamed as she runs to the bed looking at Steve’s pale and motionless body. Her fingers went to Steve’s neck, searching for a pulse, she found a very weak one. She took a scanning look over his body, searching for injuries or blood -
in the first place and I wasn’t thinking anything, Tony! What did you expect me to do? Pretend that nothing had happened? Doing my job like any other day? Jesus Christ, these assholes killed you, they took you away from
“How much?!” he barked, though he tried his hardest to wrangle his tone to something approaching calm, so he wouldn’t frighten her.
Steve frowned, stomach fighting with nerves as it always did when Tony was brought out to be examined. “I told you, he was a layman at St. Péter’s.” He said with what he hoped was nonchalance. It didn't seem to appease her, but Charlotte had always been shrewd.
He relived every moment. Good and bad. Playing them on loop inside his head until his eyes burned from staring so long without blinking. He rolled the beads of his necklace between his fingers and remembered Christmas, decorating the tree and dancing with Natacha. Longing, wishing, aching, to be able to dance with Stefen the way he’d wanted. Searching for him within the crowd...
"Charlotte, understand this.” She stilled, responding to the gravity in his tone and Steve leaned forward. “I'll give you everything at my disposal, but you share it with Tony. Tony goes with you to Geneva and will maintain his position with a set salary until either Sara is grown or he decides he no longer wishes to be employed. On this I won't compromise."
“I won’t let anything happen to him Stefen, trust me.”
“Stark.” Rogers barked and Tony jumped, eyes flying back to the captain.
In a chair opposite, Ian blinked slowly and lifted his head, his eyes moving to the door and his brow furrowing at it deeply. Fraulein Regenbogen had stepped out a few hours ago and had not returned. Tony was nearly positive she was hidden away somewhere, out of sight and out of mind. The soldier currently outside their door would have no reason to remember her or to think on her face. Most likely Sieger was doing his best to keep Stefen distracted and not wondering too much on her absence.
His pulse leaped with sudden fear, as the reality of his stupidity sank in. Sure Anamarie wasn’t an officer’s child like him and Gwen, and her father didn’t run a big business like Johann or Harry, but that didn’t mean she wouldn’t find the courage to tell on him. Péter hadn’t needed to spend more than a few hours with her to know that if there was one thing she was short on it wasn’t courage. When she turned and looked at him he felt pinned in place like a bug to a show board.
Natacha just poured the jar of tomatoes into the pot he'd brought down and didn't answer.
Tony clenched his hand into a fist over his heart, and held the man’s stare.
Steve had done his part and gotten his family safely to this point. They had done well for themselves amidst the group of Jews being escorted by the DELESAM to the immigration office in Genoa.
"Then what are you suggesting?" Stefen asked, growing impatient.
He used to trace his spine like this when he was little, resting on his mother chest. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d done it.
It was on the tip of his tongue to say it. He didn’t want to walk Gisella home and get her pregnant, no matter what their group leaders said. He already had his younger siblings to look out for and well, he rather have a dog instead. It wasn’t what he was supposed to want but dogs were nice. Even if they couldn’t grow up to be warriors for the empire like babies.
Wherein the Rogers family make good on their escape, Steve continues to not be fine, Bucky and Tony continue to do their best and the children are wonderfully brave and immensely more clever than any of the adults give them credit for.
of buinokishti. Like the one his mother had been buried in. Like the one his sister would never wear. And in the middle of all that noise, there was Stevie standing there reaching.
“I don’t understand. Are you going somewhere?” Steve asked Natacha through a stiff smile, trying to make his voice sound light. On his arm Charlotte laughed gayly, instantly putting Frau Greer and her friends at ease.
Tony could already tell that this was going to be a nightmare.
He must have dozed because Bucky's shadow interrupted falling over him jolted him awake once more and when he blinked up at him Bucky was standing over him, a towel slung over one shoulder and his straight blade in one hand.
"The night of the riots..." Péter's hesitant voice pulled Tony's attention back. I was in Czechoslovakia, on my way back. I'd given Cameron and Daniel the rest of the money, cause I figured they'd need it more. I hadn't eaten since I left Poland. This farmer and his wife were nice enough to give me dinner and a place to sleep. But the Germans in the town, they act like they own everything now. They were always trying to impress the soldiers and prove how German they really are, even if nobody in their family had actually lived in Germany for generations."
“Where are you going?” Now even his brave little sister sounded afraid.
But Natacha only had eyes for the stack of royal blue jumper’s he’d already completed, her brow burrowing deeply in displeasure as she grabbed the one on the top of the pile and examined it closely.
“The trouble is it’s all useless if we don’t know what route the escort is going to take.”
Steve watched from by the door, keeping out of the way.
“Father likes you in that horrible suit you’re wearing so he’s hardly the perfect judge.” The girl had sneered, and Tony would have been more affronted if one, she hadn’t just used his actual name instead of insisting on Herr Stark, and secondly, he personally agreed with her that the suit was hideous.
Magda’s eyes were wide with horror, but it was the man beside her who held Steve’s gaze, the barrel of a shotgun pointed in his face. Steve knew that look. He’d seen it thousands of times from men who killed and didn't want to kill but did it anyway. They never looked at the target in the face.
“It was a pleasure to meet you, Tony. I do hope you’ll write. You can leave an address for me at the Adlon until the end of the week.”
As much as he didn’t want it to end and he wasn’t looking forward to a night rattling around their rooms all by himself, it wasn’t like he was keen on going to a ball hosted by Nazis either.
“They’re not making it public of course, but we expect France to fall to the damned Germans before summer is out.” She was still talking, about important things he realized and Tony rallied himself together to actually listen. “Ground troops have already moved to safer ground. Special Operations is scrambling to plant agents all over France to assist with future sabotage.”
“Charlotte.” He leaned forwards, clasping her hand again. She clutched at it, fingers spasming against his palm, her grip strong.
Sometime between then and now he'd gone disturbingly numb. The room danced a little as he refocused his attention on Virginia. She was muttering to herself.
As for the poor brothers who now find themselves at the mercy of “God’s chosen leader”, I can only pray that the god you have devoted so much of your life shows them the mercy you seek, and that the cardinal is able to bargain for their release. There is little mercy to spare these days.
“Hard to tell until we can get a proper look at it. Let’s get her downstairs. Can you help me lift her?”
“Maybe I’d get you first.”
His leaders in the HJ said he should always be ready.
Steve slept. At some point he rolled in his sleep, fitfully jerking back and forth, his body protesting vigorously as the smell of blood and sewer penetrated his dreams. The ugly faces of his attacker morphed and molded into other faces: soldiers, younger, more Italian. The bodies multiplied, so that Steve was pressed close to their stinking cold flesh. They groped at him, his face, and his chest. He couldn’t breathe and he was so damn cold.
“I don’t expect you to watch them after dinner as long as their studies are complete. Do you think you can handle all this, Herr Stark?” He paused, waiting for Tony’s answer. When Tony nodded he took a breath and continued.
"Tony's not with the gestapo" Steve insisted stubbornly, like the world was easily split between good people and gestapo.
“Are you accusing me? Why would I Iie?!” Hammer exclaimed, mouth falling open in affront.
“Stark.”
“Heil Hitler, heil Germany” Dr. Fischer returned with new ferocity.
At the mention of the Captain Natacha perked to attention. She lingered behind as the rest of her siblings filed obediently out the door at Frau Hogan’s insistence, catching the older woman’s eye when the last of them had disappeared.
“Too much risk.” Stefen grunted. “It’s easier to send you alone. I’ll join you all as soon as I can.”
"Well Spider, what do you think?" She'd asked. "Are you ready for action, or do you want to go back to your day dreams?"
Natacha answered promptly, voice as level and as emotionless as Tony had ever heard it. Polite as anything.
Stefen held the banner within his hands, red fabric spilling over his arm and onto the floor as he stared at the black lines of the swastika dispassionately, as if he’d picked up one of Artur’s toys to wonder what chest it might go in.
Stefen didn’t say anything so Tony went back to his journal, even managing to lose himself back in the project somewhat before the sensation of being watched needled at him. He looked up to find Stefen leaning over his shoulder to watch the pen Tony had gripped in his hand fly across the page, numbers and equations spilling across it with each movement.
Steve’s eyes narrowed on the man, irritation stabbing at him. It rankled, that even though Steve was the higher rank Khalmmer being SS gave him special privilege over the regular army grunts.
It was the way that Bucky spat the word gestapo, with such raw ache behind it, that finally convinced Tony that for once, it was better to do as he was told.
"He's not! Don't be such a child.” Ian protested ardently, glaring at James. But his brow was furrowed deeply in worry, and everyone could see how intensely he was working through the questions their tutors continued absence demanded asking.
“Clinton is an imp, not a child.”
It would make things easier for them, should the worst happen. They’d be ridiculed, mocked,
At some point between his story of his first trip to the shipyards with his father, and the submarine torpedo he’d designed and tried to convince his uncle Isiah to sell to the Italians when he was sixteen years old, Stefen had drifted off.
"Thorson asked to be received in Vienna rather than Berlin and they are accommodating his request. He'll be here long enough that he must be entertained and received with all manner of pomp and circumstance."
"You talking to me or the half-pint?" Bucky questioned, hands flying to the back of his skull to pat down the mess he found back there with a groan. "Christ."
The air was sharp with cold, but he had no doubt in the morning it would be fresh with the scent of it as well as spruce and pine. It would almost have been picturesque, if not for the way Bucky slunk toward the cabin, his feet impossibly silent, pistol drawn. Tony gripped the handle of his, muscle strung tight as he watched Bucky disappear around the front. If there was any sound, any commotion at all…
“I could be drunker believe me. But you know the funniest thing about it is? It’s not that you’re a poof, it’s that you think I care.”
“That’s a double edged sword, Tony. Are you sure you know which way it’s pointed?”
Bucky would find him.  That was all there was to it. Nothing else was acceptable.
“Yes he could have! Did you ever stop to wonder just why he didn’t? Why your father sent you here, to the ‘lion’s den’ as you called it?”
“My word James, are those necessary?” Frau Hogan had exclaimed, shocked at the sight of the weapons.
Something rustled and Ian’s eyes snapped open. Over by the fireplace his father was methodically folding the letter with his summons back into its envelop, paying it far too much attention to be normal. The bright red and black swastika seal stood out on the vanilla carbon paper. Father's gaze finally lifted to fall on Tony first, then Uncle Bucky, something dark passing between them all and then finally it landed on Ian and his siblings, where they were huddled. Ian stared back hard as his thoughts tumbled around his head.
But genius and sanity weren’t the same thing and Tony wasn’t always sure the later was all it was cracked up to be.
It was not a happy sound, but they were good, and if it took their minds off things for a little while Deiter couldn't begrudge them that. He relaxed back into his seat and let the sound of their music wash over him.
“Your Da’s not going to always be there. I’m not always going to be there. Do you understand me? One day you might be alone with someone who wants to hurt you, or your brothers and sisters,” he warned lowly, his voice nearly becoming a snarl as he spoke.
~*~*~*~
Steve’s squad was the one left in the living room, and as Bucky and the others got themselves settled Steve took the first rotation by the window. He sat on the ledge staring out over at the half view of the chancellery. Its long white brick walls standing out against the browns and reds of the other buildings, casting a shadow over everything even from a distance.
“Ach, listen to you,
Natacha watched him, an unusual glint of anxiousness in her eyes.
Somehow, Tony knew he’d always be able to find home, right there.
who protected their homes, and their children, while lesser men grappled for power? I will make no arrest without real evidence!"
He huffed a small laugh, wiping a hand down his face in the darkness. It sounded weak even to his own ears.
“Strongest naval force in the world,” Tony mused aloud, just for the pleasure of watching the admiral’s mouth curl in distaste.
He waited in the stiff silence for her reply, sure that it would be something sharp. She’d not taken well to his lecture the other morning about Frau Neumann and the reckless way she’d put herself and her family at risk. He was here because it was her choice, and Susann had watched a fair amount of choices be denied her already. He understood that too well, but he still did not want to see her get hurt.
"Are you sure you're up for this Darling?" Charlotte murmured in his ear, her breath misting hotly over his skin pulling his focus back to the endeavor at hand as Virgina and Harrold ambled off arm in arm towards their cottage. Charlotte had her arm in his and was looking up at him with concern. In truth Steve was already feeling a bit worn from the morning's activity but looking around him at the children's eager faces and the way they were already darting about, this way and that as they enjoyed the snow, there was nothing to do but smile and bear it.
“I told you, my children don’t play any instrum-”
“Children,” Steve began, voice loud in the quiet room and Bucky leaned back in his chair, cursing under his breath. “I hurt your tutor. I did not mean too but...”
“Nooo, I have to look in the lake. They live in the water! But Tony’s busy and he said not to bother Pepper." Artur admitted, pouting into Steve's leg. Steve swallowed down the pang of pain at the silly little pet name Artur had picked up from Tony and pushed his fingers through the child’s soft hair. The children adored Tony. They’d be devastated if he left. At least he hadn’t left already like Bucky had predicted. At least Steve didn’t think he had. He couldn’t imagine that Tony would leave without saying goodbye to the children.
Well If James had wanted to get his father’s attention, he certainly had it now.
A somewhat humorless smirk crossed Rogers face.
Steve spent his days with the children. It was too dangerous to go outside now that Tony’s godfather was in residence, and his men no doubt combing the city for sight or sign of Major Rogers. Tony had to stay away, his only contact with them through Antonia who could not risk unnecessary visits that would jeopardize the quick escape they had to make. And yet, even if circumstances had not housebound Steve and his children in these excruciating days of waiting, Steve would have made the effort to be with them.
“We’ll get to the point Herr Stark, but first I must remind you that everything said in this room today is considered strictly confidential.” The admiral waited for Tony’s nod of confirmation before continuing.
Truthfully, Steve was afraid to admit where he thought Tony belonged. Truthfully, Stefen could have married Charlotte and sent his family to safety ages ago. But selfishly, he’d balked at the thought of marrying a woman he didn’t love when there was already someone else consuming his thoughts.
Khalmmer shrugged, still watching him warily.
“Oh Christ! There you are.”
“Don’t.”
“You remind me very much of your father.” The man smiled slightly as if he found that funny. “I only have to look at you to know you are German. Your sister however is a very different story. A story I’d very much like to know.”
Steve was twitchy, sure that at any moment he would hear the warning signal and that the gestapo would be breaking down the doors. He couldn’t stop wondering if these were his last moments of freedom and thinking that Tony had been horribly right about what he’d said. Steve’s war with the Nazis would cost him his life and he was going to leave his children alone and unprotected. He could have begged Margrit’s parents to take them all. He’d always said he couldn’t bear the thought of sending the children to live with cold hearted relatives to be looked down upon and treated like a burden, but really it was his pride that had stood in the way. After they’d snubbed all but Natacha the thought of getting on his knees for them had just been unbearable.
She nodded without speaking, grabbing a fistful of pamphlets from the satchel and leaving them stacked between the lamp posts. She cast around in the dark for a moment before she found a loose stone big enough to weigh the papers down before rising once more. She grabbed the satchel and he grabbed the trunk with the brush and paint.
Stefen didn’t just want the boys to learn to shoot, he behaved as if he needed them to know. He’d been all ready to drag all seven children out here including little Sara until Tony had put his foot down. So why? What was it all for?
He could trust Tony. He could...
“Oi, that’s amazing.” Clint breathed in awe, fiddling with the sides of the case to find the button Tony had pushed. He quickly lost interest when it didn’t immediately present itself and began digging through the contents of the compartment. Tony had packed a few thin blankets, a torch, a few copper wires, a line of string soaked in fat and two unassuming steel balls with the name Stark engraved upon their sides. But predictably Clint’s eyes immediately locked on the most dangerous thing within the case, which was a small metal canister similarly engraved.
“Damn them!” he shouted in return, and Natacha stiffened.
It was worrisome, but they were lucky he could speak at all. The damage the neurotoxin had inflicted was one thing, but Bruce’s notes had been clear on the fact that the binding agent caused much of its own and could be deadly without luck on their side. It was doing its job. He was flushing the toxic metal in his system, but he was far from out of the woods. His organs were still taking a beating, and if they couldn’t replenish the metals his body actually needed and reduce the stress on his system quickly, he could be irreparably damaged for life. He could still die.
The way Tony said it, Steve knew that he’d accepted the possibility of death for both of them. Seeing him so at peace with it should have burned, heavy with failure, but Steve felt nothing of the sort. He stood apart from himself, a shell masquerading as a man. Only his will to complete the mission was left.
“Oi, I’d keep your heads down if I was you.” Jack Harrison warned from beneath the bed of the truck. It was followed by a loud clanging sound and a curse, presumably as the thick fingered lug banged his even thicker skull on something down there.
To busy his hands, Tony reached for an empty cup and saucer from the tray and ignored the scrutiny of Stefen and his strange friend as they watched him prepare his drink.
"Everyone knows Maria is the one with the best voice." Natacha grouched, but her cheeks were pink as Bucky joined in on the nagging. She eventually gave in with a huff and launched into an old Christmas song that Steve immediately recognized.
“Do you really think it’s wise, getting her hopes up like this?” Péter, who was sitting in front of the coffee table with a weathered book open in front of him as he scribbled in a journal, looked up to say.
“Jesus, Stevie you coulda just said.”
MUSIC: FANFARE.
He was close. Tony could tell by the sound of each ragged breath. He could feel Stefen shaking against him, and at first he thought it was from how very close he was to completion, but when Tony looked into his eyes again they’d changed.
“Clever girl,” he muttered with a half-smile, because despite everything he still felt proud of how she used her sharp wits. He’d probably still be proud when he was swinging by his neck, and if that didn’t say how utterly attached Tony had become to the Rogers children he didn’t know what would.
Though Steve was still a distance away, the sight of the cabin through the trees sitting as still as if it were a painting filled him with dread. His heart began to slam against his ribs, as the still air was suddenly ripped open with an animal cry. A fox maybe. Trapped somewhere… Steve pulled himself up onto his feet, the sight of his goal nearly within reach bringing a last wave of strength.
“It’s crazy. We know it. I’ve told them we need to scale back but it’s what the Führer wants.” The man shrugged helplessly as if to say, ‘what can you do’, and Hoch cleared his throat.
“I just… I saw how it was for the workers at the yard, for my grandparents and people like Rhodey. It was so different in Italy, and I guess I thought that if Pola became part of Italy again things would be better. Naïve right? If not for Hughard I’d be just another dead stupid boy, so I can’t be too angry I guess.”
Steve let out something between a laugh and a huff (which Bucky did not look fooled by in the least) and grabbed up his bags. He couldn’t help however getting in a jibe of his own.
Janneke cleared her throat poignantly and Bucky’s eyes flickered to the gleeful faces on the children and he sighed.
Tony ignored his grumbling and leaned over them to flip off the radio, plunging the cabin into silence. It felt wrong somehow, a shivery sort of panic crawling through him at the loss of voices from the outside, but he forced the feeling down.
“He’s a Jew. So they call him a plagiarist and a fraud.” Tony explained, dull anger sitting heavy in his chest. He was so tired, and he must sound it because Ian was looking at him now with the echoes of fear left by an old memory that was suddenly as fresh as the day it had happened. Tony knew he was in the square again, watching Péter’s friends beat on that old man. Tony could only wonder at how many new memories Ian had made within the HJ.
Warnings: There is a brief mention of non/con in this chapter. It's only talked about and does not involve a major character but may still be triggering.
And the thing about wanting someone, and wanting what made that someone a
“Maria?” The baroness was at the top of the stairs now, holding out a hand for the girl.
She’d protected her family when no one else would, and that was all that mattered.
“I’m a big girl Captain Rogers, I can handle a lot more than that.” D’Anvers was saying, much of the heat gone from her tone. “But I should tell you, my orders are to take you to the air base at Valence.”
Tony’s stomach clenched like he would vomit. Good thing there was nothing in there.
!” Bucky cut him off with a jab, because
“I’m an old friend of your mother.” Tony explained and the girl’s eyes widened some in curiosity. “I was hoping you could help us find her.”
People were really getting into the spirit of things now. They paired off quickly and the grounds were soon full of dancers. Tony reached for Sara and took her by both hands, dancing her in a circle until she was breathless with delighted giggles.
“I’ll see to that children, it’s outside until dinner.” She turned to Tony even as she began herding the reluctant children towards the door.
Artur eagerly thrust the glass jar (already containing one other species of butterfly, a poor housefly, and a strange looking beetle as yet unclassified) forward and as carefully as an excited boy of eight could manage James deposited the insect into the jar without managing to lose any of the others.
“Yes, if we’re to sneak a nap in before the opera tonight then we’d better get on with it.” Tony answered, smirking as Stefen’s fingers clutched his parcel all the tighter. He knew as much as Tony did what would happen as soon as they were back in the privacy of their suite.
“He wants to marry me.”
“Sit down!” The warden barked and the two prisoners jumped, scurrying back toward their chairs.
One crisis averted Tony went back to their supply box to fetch the cooking pot. He sent Péter down to the lake to fill it with water while he resumed his work peeling and chopping vegetables (a rudimentary task made difficult by the lack of proper work space) listening with half an ear as Bakhuizen explained skinning rabbits to his eager audience.
“Our trail will lead you back to the road. I’ve got a mule and a cart we can take down, find where your Pa has you set up.” Dagmar grunted. It fell quiet, but for the sounds of Karlina bustling in the kitchen and the crackle of the fire in the stove.
“It’s too small!” James cried, struggling to maneuver out of the way for Tacha’s larger body, Maria let out a wail of pain as her brother’s knee jabbed into her side.
He would know wouldn’t he? A manic burst of laughter bubbled up and bursting out of Tony. Sieger cast him an alarmed look and edged away from him. Tony reached for another apple slice and crunched down on it, giving himself something else (anything else) to focus on.
They sang of their favorite things, girls in white dresses and their blue satin sashes. They sang of the spring and summer rolling by, full of mishap and laughter.
While it would have been easy to assume that Pepper was merely covering for him and that there was nothing deeper to it, Tony had never been one to make things easy on himself. He hadn’t thought he’d make a good spy but as the good Alice said, things were just getting curiouser and curriouser.
He and James were clamoring around their father, splashing as they fought, almost viciously, for the place of honor on his shoulders. Stefen appeared to be largely ignoring the pulling and tugging around his neck, focused as he was with watching Maria paddle her way between him and Bakhuizen, proud as punch with her own progress. Their voices drifted over the water toward Tony and Ian and Tony smiled.
"I am not German!" Wanda hissed, yanking violently on a fist full of grass until she tore it from the ground and Péter flinched away. She began muttering fiercely in that language that Péter didn't understand, but he got the feeling she wasn't saying anything positive.
Ian slid off the sofa, looking for Tony in the spinning room. In a moment Tony would touch his shoulder and maybe smile at him.
"I'm sorry.” Her voice sounded weak even to her own ears and she hated it. Hated it even more when he said, "I know I can count on you to take care of your brothers and sisters.”
Steve frowned, his head beginning to ache now more from confusion than pain. Why was she playing this game? No one could be so naive. Or had she truly not realized who he was?  Maybe not. Maybe there really was hope.
“Ian?”
“No word yet on Kirk’s ship?”
"But you did make that choice Charlotte." Virgina's voice stayed gentle, but there was nothing soft about the way she looked at Charlotte as she closed the space between them with slow measured steps. It made Charlotte feel trapped but she refused to look away, no matter how uncomfortable the twisting sense of guilt in her gut became. Virginia was right, as she so often was. Charlotte had always known the risks and she'd made her choices. But the children...What choice had they had?
They sang as only the innocent can, and the crowd joined in with them. The children were loved, as Tony had known they would be. They had reminded all those gathered there that night the dreams that had once unified them all. For a precious moment in time, they were all of them allowed to be children again; easily believing that a great multitude could share a single heart. And for one night at least, they did.
"You're considering their offer."
This is Freddie broadcasting live from the Castle, reaching out to our kin at the INN. Auntie’s condition worsens. Funeral arrangements have been made. Flowers will need picking up at the High St. shop. Wendy arrives on the 25
“A gentleman doesn’t kiss and tell Jaime my boy.” Kirk grinned at him and snickered. “Jesus your English is terrible. You sound like you’ve been chewing on glass.”
“Don’t be insolent!” the countess snapped, and Charlotte arched her brows.
"That must have cost you dearly."
“Tacha it wasn’t his fault!” Péter insisted, tired of beating around the bush. “That shouldn’t have happened. Something went wrong. Harry never mentioned- no one mentioned... what did that old man do?”
Steve didn’t know if it was.
They didn’t know about the mother that had taught Natacha to dance, or the grandfather who had made him and his brother of choice their first instruments (didn’t see him cut the music away from himself or care about the obvious scars left behind) and they didn’t know about the uncles – these faceless men he mentioned in the glaring absence of a father – and therefore could never fathom that the loss he carried around with him might be bigger than the death of his wife.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dear god, he'd all but forgotten the promised puppets.
Tony frowned glancing from the letter he was penning to Niklas toward the wall adjacent to his bedroom as if he could see through it into the drawer were he’d tucked the captains last letter in the nightstand. He was again having trouble reconciling the man he’d witnessed the morning the captain had departed with the man captured on the front of the society pages. None of it made sense to him. He grabbed the parchment where he was dictating the children’s activities in excruciating detail to the captain and added:
“Why are you still here?” he found the words, finally, and Charlotte looked back at him, brow furrowed slightly.
Steve stood staring at the big clock in the center of the station, watching the minutes tick down toward ten in the evening. The arrival of the orient line was delayed by an hour. He’d stopped agonizing on why that could be, pushing everything but the cold hard facts of the matter away. Tony would come or he wouldn’t.
"Is there something the matter Ian?" Stefen turned to the younger boy to snap in exasperation and Tony winced.
“Captain?” Steve blinked and released Maria’s wrist instead of helping her like he'd intended, his hand falling with a thud onto the table unsure of what to do. He felt suddenly like a brute, too large for the table. Shame pooled in his gut and flooded his face.
Their bouts of illness, both real and exaggerated, had often removed them from the classroom and their teachers had been all too happy to concur with his parental concern that they needed additional time to catch up due to their long absences.
Hammer looked as if he would combust at the sight of the grubby boy plopping himself into one of the houses plush chair, and greedily grabbing at the cakes Pepper brought for them. She seemed amused by it, bless her, but Tony still had to scold the boy to eat slowly. The last thing they needed was for him to choke.
“I’ll call you if I need your help” Stefan assured him softy. Like hell he would. But Ian nodded and darted back inside. Tony closed the door behind him. There was a rustling behind him and he turned just in time for Stefen to toss him a small iron key. He held it in his hand for a moment thinking how he must have gotten it from Sieger and then turned and locked the door with a click.
He frowned, stopping to look at Tony, eye’s combing over him carefully as if searching for the piece that would put it all together and Tony flinched, unable to keep looking at him.
“You remind me of my brother. He’s very clever too,” Holmes finally replied after the silence had stretched uncomfortably long. He sounded bored, but there was just the slightest frisson of contempt in it – whether for the aforementioned brother or Tony himself – that told Tony he had the man where he wanted him.
“Of course.”
“In exchange for that commendable service, the Grant children -” Holmes expanded, looking meaningfully at Stefen, “– are to be granted asylum and excluded from policy present or future regarding enemy aliens.”
Gypsies Tony had thought, staring at the poster in dawning realization. Of course.
Tony was a problem.
“Yes.” Bucky nodded, not seeing a point in beating around the bush further. “Same as before. Live cargo.”
"Yes. I had heard." Stefen said in reply, voice low and expressionless.
Tony waved his free hand trying to encompass the fantastic being that was himself, managing to splash James in the face while he was at it. “You’ll do wonderfully Ian. That is if someone could take this amoeba that’s found a home on me-”
"I'd take a bullet for him. Doesn't mean he isn't an assfucker, right Stevie?"
Clinton looked surprised by the request but he nodded with a solemnness to his expression that Tony had rarely observed in him and he felt something in his chest region pinch. Right. Well that was enough of
Wherever they went, Stefen had to know he could still fight them, or he simply wouldn't go. He'd make sure his family was safe and then he’d say farewell and go wherever it was he felt he could make a difference. He’d leave them all waiting at windows for someone who would never return.  Tony knew it like he knew his own name.
He was grateful. He'd been worried she might remember the unorthodox way Artur had tried to teach her about the importance of friends.
Natacha’s hand’s clenched in her lap.
"I plan on moving the children there. Their grandparents have retired there, and their mother still has a portion of her inheritance there in an account with Lombard Odier in Geneva. It has 50,000 Reich Marks, I want to move the bulk of it from the German bank over as well, so that there will be enough to live on until Sara is finished with school if you are conservative… but the Reich may not allow it.”
"I've been worse," Bucky muttered, catching his feet finally, enough to support his own weight.  Dr. Richter was there another moment later, batting Tony's hands aside to tear away Bucky's shirtsleeve and begin poking perfunctorily at the wound.
Niklas grinned at him like the cat in the crème and cheerfully replied, “Seven.”
“You’ll remember to write?”
Bucky jerked his head towards the music room and promptly lost which way was up for a moment. No sudden head movements. Got it.
Where to go. What to do.
He had a small jar in his hands which released a pungent chemical odor when he jerked the top off. Ian wrinkled his nose.
“You’re a brave girl, Miss. Much more brave than I.” The maid whispered, reaching to briefly squeeze her hand before she turned and scuttled off to join the rest of the house in its mad rush to empty. As for Natacha, she made her way calmly down the stairs to find Charlotte and Frau Hogan. She was the only one who knew after all that there was nothing to fear.
“Ferreting out a traitor of course.”
We really hope you enjoyed this installment and hope you'll tell us what you think. So much going on! This is an Avengers story, remember we promised that? BWAHAHA well, this is the part where singing nuns and prancing children meet Avengers levels of drama and angst I'm afraid, so buckle up gang! Thoughts? Worries? Questions, predictions? You know I love to hear them all.
"Wanda?" He whispered, and the girl’s shoulders tensed. Her whole body went so still Péter thought she might have stopped breathing. "Is that really your name?"
In the film, your family escapes over the mountains into Switzerland – but in reality, your journey was a bit more fraught than that.
“Jesus Stevie, you think I’d put something like that in a letter? Covert remember. Covert.”
“I have friends in London. That is, if you find yourself in need of a friendly face...” Steve hedged, no good at holding coded conversations and wishing he could simply tug Janneke out of the dance hall and have out with it. “You might look them up. I’m sure they’d be happy to show you around.”
He thought as a memory floated up from their time on the lake. Steve had not been able to put a name to the feeling curling in his belly. Tony had been shooting off at the mouth again. Tony, dark eyelashes clumped together, his chest shifting under the water as he swished past Steve in a back stroke.
“A cardinal would never open his own door.” Tony pointed out solemnly and the other man’s brow twitched in irritation. Wordlessly he came around and yanked open the passenger side door.
Stefen looked to Péter first and then Ian almost unable to bear to do it, but he’d hurt them too much already by not being strong enough to do the things he should do. The least he could do was not hide from an apology. Péter didn’t say anything but Ian crawled out from under his covers to kneel in front of Steve on the bed like a child preparing to say his prayers.
"As well as you could expect. But the point is, my friend Bruce has been placed there, to be a Chaplain to the imprisoned men of faith and assure they aren’t being unduly mistreated while the Führer and the Pope come to terms. He says the Germans have abandoned God. That they don't fear anything. Only that's not quite true. Is it?” Tony paused, and when he saw that he had their full attention now he went on. “Hitler fears the people. At least enough to know he has to control them. Religion had them first and it still holds a lot of sway over the common man. He knows it is better if they work together, at least for a time, and for that bloody pact to hold together he needs play a careful game. That is why he has agreed to release a group of monks who were recently arrested."
Tony spent that night and into the following morning half buried underneath the auto losing himself to a completely different kind of music.
Steve looked at Tony and saw the same realization dawning there.  There were forms of currency older than coin itself, and desperate times increased desperate measures. He glowered at the closed door the man had exited through. Putting the child out during business hours might be necessary but the streets were dangerous.
“We have to survive them. We owe it to the children.” Charlotte added as Father turned away again, their voices drifting as they hurried down the stairs, continuing to bicker.
Tony arched an eyebrow and lifted the lid of the basket, looking down into the bright assortments of fruit and cheese. Willamina had packed them with care telling Tony as he'd made his coffee, that the captain and his wife had made a habit of eating outside when it was only the five of them.
Submerged in water James felt as if he weighed nothing, his damp hair succumbing to its natural wave. Tony reached up and stroked the dark red waves out of his face and James let him, eyes watching Ian on the shore.
Father would have been horrified to hear her talk like that. Natacha never would have said it in front of him anyway because it would have just made him feel guilty because she couldn’t be innocent like Sara and Maria. Tony would have said something hopeful but naive, because he somehow didn’t know yet how bad the world really was. He still believed they could make a difference. Tony and her father shared a faith that try as she might, she just could not grasp.
Was that why Tony wouldn’t tell the truth? Steve didn’t want to die. Being a solider was his life. It was so much bigger then Tony knew. So much bigger than Steve's own life. He couldn’t leave his children to the world the Third Reich was building. He wanted to tell Tony this, make him understand. He opened his mouth to do so, but the words froze in his throat.
“No Bambina,” Tony quickly reassured her, placing a hand atop her head and pressing one finger against his lips in the signal for quiet. “It’s just that your father is meeting with some very important people and we all must be very quiet now until they’re done. Sara could use some more practice with her letters. Why don’t you girls head to the school room with Frau Hogan and see if you can’t get through the alphabet today.”
A hysterical giggle bubbled up inside of Steve and he just barely held it back. Hysterical. He couldn’t afford that either. He opened his mouth to… To what, threaten her?
These diagrams were old. Older than anything else in the journal. A product of insomnia and the lingering taste of night terrors, something Tony often came back to in his most desperate hours when sleep had evaded him too long and the demons of his past encroached too close.
Stefen nodded silently, but he was refusing now to meet Tony’s eye and that just wouldn’t do. Gently, Tony pressed his teeth against a patch of skin on Stefen’s broad chest, urging lowly as the muscles beneath him clenched and Stefen’s breathing hitched.
"Unbelievable." He clapped a hand on Steve's shoulder and aggressively turned him toward the door saying, loud enough for Tony's benefit, "Now that that's settled I need to have a word with Stefen. Bye Stark."
“I didn’t even stop. They were everywhere she said,” voice trembling near the end. “The gestapo were stopping every passerby, checking every passenger. There’s no way.”
"Something will be brought up."
“It’s good to see you Tony.” Obi began, even managing to sound sincere about it. “You had me thinking you were dead.”
"We have that in common."
Tony's thoughts hiccupped, hysterically winding around in knots.
He found he couldn’t quite think of it in terms of only Peggy's anymore. Now it belonged to Maria as she plinked out chords and made her way up and down the scales under Tony’s watchful eye. Now it belonged to Tony as he coached the children, or like now when he came to savor a rare moment of solitude, performing old songs from memory and getting lost in them.
Natasha nods. Then she stops and holds her wrists out in front of her, the bluish lines of her veins facing the ceiling. She inclines her head to the men in front of her. “My apologies. I surrender.”
"How's the project going, anyway?"
“50% of the workers on the Erie Canal were of Irish heritage,” Tony says automatically, because he spent way too much time on Google last night. Everyone at the table looks at him. “Um. Can we make an Erie Canal float? Is that weird?”
“What?” he says. He traces a question mark onto the back of Tony’s hand.
“I can list every sexual partner you have ever had in order from my creation ‘til now if that will assuage your doubts,” JARVIS told him dryly.
Steve can’t help but nod in agreement.
Tony hums. “Well, better than it was,” he says philosophically. “But some of the people that hate me are kinda right, even if they are bigots. I became a so-called advocate because I was scared. I wasn’t really an activist. I was just a coward.”
,” he says, slowly. “Something? Maybe? It was, like, just a flash of weird.” Peter wriggles his fingers by his temples meaningfully, and Tony sucks in a breath. Then he, too, slides down the cabinets, and sits heavily on the floor.
“Tony says he shouldn’t talk to you right now,” Williams said, sounding a little sad, and Steve nodded vigorously.
“Brother!” Thor calls, and that’s an actual tear, holy shit, “you are alive!”
Blessed darkness takes over the room, and Tony closes his eyes, breathing in the smell of Steve’s more human musk, sweet sweat and the smell of his shampoo. Under it, the inhuman scent of Loki’s pine-and-winter smell lingers, familiar and strangely dear.
“How long were you going to avoid me?” Steve asks. He presses a soft kiss to the skin above Tony’s collarbone, and the
As it is, all he wants to do is put his mouth to Tony’s. He wants to ask him why he waited all this time. He wants to shake him. He wants to take him apart with his teeth.
He goes through the motions of charming the National Grid representatives. Pepper’s been mostly handling the city contracts for clean energy, but the tech folks had wanted someone to explain some things, and Tony was ten times more charismatic than anyone in R&D proper. More than that, the reactor had always been his baby; there was no one who understood it the way he did, and he was more than happy to talk about it to some suits for an hour or two if it meant getting New York City’s power grid 100% green by 2020.
“Captain, if you’re not enough for Tony, that’s nothing to be ashamed of.”
“Then why are you upset?” Steve asks, eyes narrowing, and
“Not as such,” Thor says. He looks as though he does not know whether to laugh or cry. “My father had been…weak. He is quite old for an Æsir. I have spoken to you of the Odinsleep before, how he needed rest more often, and for longer. How my mother had feared he would not wake, before she passed, how part of Loki’s protest to my appointment as heir was that our father was not using his best judgement. Perhaps he was right, in that regard. I would make a foolish king.” He laughs, somewhat bitterly. “Loki set himself to prove it, first by tricks and then by warfare. Except it seems he has done a better job of it this time.
Tony turns, wincing when he sees Steve and Stephen in a heated discussion. Steve’s hands are flailing in the air, impassioned, whereas Stephen is looking at Steve like he’s something that the cloak dragged though and needs to be washed out, post haste.
“This is not what we agreed to. You cannot just kill-“
“This is bullshit, Tony,” Peter pleads. His eyes are wide and beseeching even through the mask. Ever the romantic, Steve knows. He can recognise a kindred soul. They both want, so badly, for the happily ever after ending.
“Look, just come get me,” Tony bites out, and Happy sighs.
“She’s okay,” Taesha manages, and Tony smiles. He laughs a little, relieved and giddy with it. “Just a radial fracture, if you can believe it. So I just wanted to say thank you, for saving her. For saving us all. A little privacy is truly the least I could do.”
“We don’t control the U.S. government, Ms. Hill,” Senator Durbin says mildly. He’d been mostly quiet throughout the proceedings, but Tony knew that wasn’t unusual. As the Democratic whip, most of his work was done in the shadows. If anything, he was surprised that Cochran had been as open has he had; likely a result of their personal relationship.
Over and over again, like a lovesick fool. He wanted to reach into the screen and touch the crinkles at the corner of Tony’s eyes when he laughed, smooth his dark brow with his thumbs.
“Lies, all of it,” Tony says, but he’s smiling enough that it’s audible in his voice. “What would she know?”
“Towo babababababa.”
“Perhaps you should inform Captain Rogers of your displeasure with his choice when you next see him,” JARVIS replies, clearly amused.
“I believe so, sir. I would recommend you look at the helmet personally, however; I still cannot access the display. I cannot run diagnostics to see the extent of the damage.”
You do not have to be good.
“You heard me,” Steve says. He’s gaining confidence, in that way he does sometimes—a freight train picking up speed. Each small success buoys his confidence until he’s unstoppable, smug and avaricious. “I worried a lot before, about your reputation. How many people you’d gone with. I thought maybe I’d be too boring for you.”
Tony bites his lip. He doesn’t say anything.
“Why am I suddenly sure that your ‘common disagreement’ with Steve wasn’t common at all?” He sounds resigned, grudgingly amused, and Tony does not answer. He trains his eyes on the elevator doors as well, neither daring to flinch first.
“Still the only person who calls me that who isn’t my eighty year old uncle.”
“Not good for my heart rate,” Bruce had agreed. “I’ll take care of Clint’s injuries, and then we’ll make dinner.”
It’s not a bad idea. Tony had thought about making a space for the Hulk, although he’d been thinking of putting him in a subbasement. But that’s not the real issue, here. Technically, Steve’s current rooms are in Tony's part of the tower. Or they will be, once all the renovations are done. Steve’s not just refusing to move to DC. He’s refusing to move out of Tony’s penthouse.
“What’s your point, Steve?”
“Natasha,” Steve protested, already anticipating where this was going.
“Destroyed it, saved it…”
He sits up, and looks down at himself. He’s still not in his body. He’s still a ghost.
“Why are you being nice about this?” Steve demanded, sitting up and frowning at Tony. “You’re the one who was kidnapped. And I know they hurt you, and you won’t tell me what they did-”
“Who was on him?” Steve asks, and Tony frowns.
“As much as I’d love to leave you to your fate, I’d miss that sweet little ass of yours,” Tony said, mock-mournfully. He pushed himself to sitting, and Steve cracked one eye open to watch as a few heavy droplets of his cum dripped over the lines of Tony’s abs, down towards his thighs. He couldn’t help but lick his lips, and it was only Tony’s sharp whistle that brought him back to himself. “Oy, my eyes are up here.”
“He just-…” Tony stills, then shakes his head. “He never said.
He glances over to Beth to check her reaction. She’s pressing the tips of her fingers over her mouth, gaze distant as she tries to parse this new information. She’s good at figuring things like this out, Steve knows. That’s why Tony hired her to be head of Avengers security. It’s one of the reasons why he loves her. Tony’s always loved the smart ones, in all the many shapes and forms that their intelligence can take.
Loki blinks at him as though he’s a stranger, and Tony reaches up a hand to brush his thumb over one high cheekbone. When Loki’s eyelids flutter at the touch, he leans in and presses his nose to the underside of Loki’s jaw. Loki smells like a blizzard, biting cold and the pain of ice freezing the inside of his throat, his nostrils. Tony shivers at the taste of it on his tongue, the little reminder of his inhumanity. Slowly, Loki shifts towards him, until they’re leaning against each other in the empty hallway.
“You’ve been carrying all that for a year, huh?” Tony asked, and his voice was so gentle it felt like a caress. “Through our bonding, and our honeymoon, through everything, you thought I was an unwilling partner?” Tony sounded hurt, and Steve’s eyes flew open as he turned back to meet Tony’s gaze.
“I love all of you,” Steve says, and Tony swallows. “I’m sorry if I ever made you feel like that wasn’t the case.”
“I’ll tell them you called ‘em
“You are most welcome, Captain.” And then, “you have blue on your cheekbone, again.”
“Of course, sir.”
“Oh come on, that’s a reach even for you-”
Steve takes it in stride. “Then we’ll do that together, too.”
“Now you’re just bating him,” he accuses, and Loki snickers. “Asshole.”
“Why isn’t this working?” Steve grumbles. He crosses his hands over his chest, watching as Tony flosses his teeth. Frustration wells up inside him, something he’s been trying desperately to keep at bay these past few months. He reaches out to touch Tony’s back, to cup the wing of one shoulder blade, and instead passes his hand right through where Tony’s heart should be.
Steve could laugh, but it’s clear that the man is serious. He takes a slow, considering breath. He thinks of Tony’s mind, his generosity, his wealth, his looks. He isn’t sure where Jim’s driving him. “That’s a big question,” he says, finally. “Everything about him is unbelievable.”
"Mustang or Aston?" Tony asks, waving a hand. Steve grins at him and points at the '65 K-Code, and Tony obligingly unlocks the doors and gets in.
Steve had never scented an alpha and wanted to go to his knees, before Tony. They were so compatible it was like their pheromones had been built to complement each other in Bruce’s lab. He wanted to wrap himself up in Tony’s scent and roll around in it, but Tony was his friend. And Tony had Pepper. Even if he hadn’t, Tony had been voted Sexiest Alpha Alive two separate times. He could have the pick of any omega he wanted.
Tony sits up in bed, asleep to awake in one smooth motion, always reactive in the face of alarm. He scans the room with sand-crusted eyes, then flops onto his back at the sight of a familiar figure standing in the doorway, long-limbed and silent.
“How many?”
Steve glances back over his shoulder. Tony is still fast asleep, the wires still trailing from every square inch of his skull. He looks peaceful. Beautiful.
“Ah.” He takes the bowl, letting Bruce climb into place next to him over the back of the couch.
“That’s what happens when you leave your mate wanting for almost a whole week,” Steve said, and he wasn’t pouting, he wasn’t. “It’s okay, go shower.”
The speakers crackled again. “Well,” Riri said, sounding a little winded. “That’s because Tony’s chained to the wall down here. Don’t worry, he’s deemed me as a child in his pack that needs to be protected. You on a rampage could tear straight through the doors, Captain, but without the suit Tony’s stuck where he is. And before you ask, he hasn’t threatened me. Much. Well, seriously. He did threaten to make sure I’d only ever be able to get a job at Hammer Industries when he was done with me.” Riri huffed. “Like I’ll need to work for some old white dude to be somebody.”
“That is true, sir,” JARVIS says, sounding surprised and cautious, and Tony freezes. “Sergeant Barnes does not appear in the footage taken from Lagos, and due to the angle of your gaze and the severe damage to the display of the Mark 50, Sergeant Barnes is not visible during the climax of your staged battle against Mr. Laufeyson. As always, you watched the footage on mute, due to the increased speed. As such, there was no visual or auditory evidence of Sergeant Barnes’ present in any of the footage you covered with the Captain.”
And Gods, what an effect it is.
“If he was there for a while, his personality began to show. A smile. The choice to humiliate me is all Barnes, by Steve’s stories. It’s the kind of thing I could imagine Steve doing to a cocky recruit, if he was still in the service.” Natasha shakes her head, her eyes clouded. “They put these memories inside of my head. I don’t know which ones are mine, and which ones belong to other Widows. The scent of a favourite perfume, when the perfume hasn’t been produced since the 40’s. I took ballet lessons, but I also have memories of dancing as a prima ballerina for the Bolshoi, and I’ve checked the records. That never happened. I was never a ballerina, and yet I can dance
“Yes.”
“I don’t
Eventually, Tony reaches the black town car he’d come in. He swings the door open and gets inside, and Steve slips through the metal and glass just in time to catch Tony burying his face in his hands. His shoulders begin to shake, and then his whole body. He looks like he might shake apart.
“This doesn’t make any fucking
“Come on, Steve. We haven’t got all night.”
“Yeah, I’m sure that’s exactly what he said,” Steve mutters, snapping the top off and sniffing it. “As long as it’s not French cow brain this time.”
“After you talk to Xavier,” Tony says, expression unreadable. “We’ll talk again. Okay?”
Let me know your thoughts! As always, comments are the best thing to motivate me. <3
“Yes,” Steve hisses, and Tony smiles. He presses a kiss to Steve’s chest, licks over his left nipple just to feel Steve squirm against his lips. “God, you can’t hurt me, come on.”
Steve doesn’t reply to that. Instead he presses another gentle kiss to Tony’s hairline. “Let’s get you into some water first, huh?”
“Can you take more?” Tony laughs, then near about swallows his tongue when Steve clenches down hard on his oversensitive ligula.
“Again,” Tony says. A wry twist takes over his mouth. “Interested?”
Kitty frowns, but concedes the point. Then she turns, seemingly a little lost, as a wave of SHIELD agents swarm into the room. Maria Hill follows, her people parting around her in a concentric wave, like school of fish making room for a predator. Behind her is a familiar blue face: Hank McCoy.
“Good night, Tony.”
(See the end of the chapter for
– Robert Blythe, “When William Stafford Died”
Tony melts underneath his ministrations. His breathing deepens, and he presses his face into Steve’s skin, eyes closed. There’s a tension to him that won’t leak out: a small sliver of it, in his shoulders and fingers, like he’s holding on to something. Steve pets him along his spine and waits. He knows Tony has never been afraid to speak his mind. He will say what he wants to say when he’s ready to say it.
“It was!” she says, clapping her hands together with a bright laugh. “Do you know what this means?”
“I know you never wanted this,” Steve tried, then stopped, because his throat closed up.
“All right Evel Knievel, stop showing off and get your ass up here,” Clint says into the comms, and Tony powers up the thrusters accordingly, flying back up to the landing pad. He and Loki are standing shoulder to shoulder, arms crossed, and Tony takes a moment to appreciate how weird that is as he slows to a walking landing.
“You don’t even like their suites,” Happy says, and Tony sighs.
“What kind of issues?” Steve asks, wary.
“You’re an asshole,” Stark said, but there was a small smile playing around his mouth. He turned to glance over the table, his new pack members. “Alright, you miscreants. If you want. I promise to be stern, but fair.”
“Oh, god,” he says, then looks behind Tony at Loki. He swallows. “Oh. God.”
“What?”
“You let him touch you.”
“I can’t leave you like this,” Minoru says. She gestures at Tony’s…everything. “Come on, you don’t want the paps to catch you like this. It’s busted right now anyway. What have you got to lose?”
This time, it's someone else's job to fuck up!
, he thinks. He rubs a hand over his tired face.
“Cap! Steve? Honey, no, come on, I’m your friend, okay? You’re gonna be okay, it’s Tony-”
“And what did you learn?” Steve prompts, as gently as he can.
Y’all already know how that turned out…
“The place looks great,” he tries, following, but she doesn’t respond. Her orange hair swings behind her in a long ponytail, sleek as a whip. “Tony mentioned you’ve been working-”
Steve covers Tony’s mouth, his arm still locked around Tony’s neck, mostly because he feels like it. He’s laughing, chest filled to bursting because he’d missed this. He’d missed the ease of being with Tony when things were good between them, fighting over the remote, the feel of Tony squirming under him be it sparring or silly wrestling like this.
It’s a risk. He knows, after how Tony reacted the last time, that it’s a hell of a risk. Tony might lash out. He might-
“Nah, she’s the Red Queen, obviously,” Tony says, reaching for a piece of toast. Thor lifts the plate towards him with a nod, and Tony offers him one in return as he snags a few slices for himself.
“I’m certain her transfer had nothing to do with you, sir.”
“Tony, stop torturing the man and put on the movie,” Natasha says briskly, returning with a large bowl of popcorn. She folds back down on the floor, graciously leaving the couch for Bruce.
“I really like the vintage fire truck idea.”
Stephen surveys the day-drunk and disorderly crowd dispassionately, eyes flicking up to the heavens in a silent and obvious prayer for patience.
“No, Tony,” Steve said, tugging at his hair with a small moue of frustration. “You…you smell fine.”
“The point of therapy, Captain, is not for me to tie you to a chair and get as much information out of you as I can. That would be a waste, mostly because you and I know that if I really wanted to, I could know every thought you’ve ever had without you ever being the wiser.” The professor turns to smile at him again, but not unkindly. His eyes crinkle crow’s feet at the corners. “The point of therapy is for you to better know yourself. So you hold the reins, and you can decide––instead of letting things like anxiety or past traumas control you––how to live your best life.” He wets his lips, then shifts his head again, the smile never leaving his face. “So no, I’m not going to ‘rummage’ through your head, or force you to speak when you don’t want to. But if you’re not interested in being honest with me, then our meetings are a foregone conclusion, Captain. And I would rather not waste both of our time.”
“Did Stephen clear you?” Steve asks, and Tony nods. “Only…only if you want.”
“Tony,” Steve panted, and he could feel it building now, tension ratcheting up from his hips all the way down to his curling toes. It was too good, too much, too soon. “
“I couldn’t lose you,” he tries to explain. “I thought you understood.”
Steve stilled, closing his eyes. He took a long, shaky breath.
He presses his forehead to the cold glass of the shower, breathes out. He remembers Tony’s hand in his, squeezing, gently. He remembers Tony telling him, a mix of shock and delight washing over his handsome, tired face:
“Steve,” Bruce said, and there was a pause. It was like the world had been muted, the screens slowing. Bruce had that ability, sometimes. It was like all of his training to keep himself calm and centred could rub off on other people, if only for a moment. It was like he could hold you in his hands, keep you with him inside his little bubble of peace as long as you were looking right at him, listening to his voice.
