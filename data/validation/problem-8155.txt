" . . . Gawrych?" Steve says, and it all snaps into place, with painful obviousness. "Gawrych hired Sin."
"What were you supposed to do?" Steve asks. "I'll debate you on your insanity during the fight, on hunting me down to begin with," and would, but just now feels like a rather inappropriate time. "But I'm not going to forgive you for something you could've had no way of knowing–"
A shift, Tony's sitting up slowly, and Steve pulls back from his thoughts as if scorched, feeling caught and surprisingly guilty.
"Of course," Lois agrees, shuffles a set of paper, and turns to address a screen to the right. "For those of you keeping track at home, investigators have just confirmed there are no reported causalities or injuries. Stark Tower, while once the headquarters for the super powered team Avengers, the top three floors have been at the personal use of Stark himself for the past year, after the recent Skrull invasion and Osborn disaster disbanded the official, longstanding team."
"Yes," Steve says.
Steve switches it off, finishes tying his right shoe and hopes Tony knows what the hell he's gotten himself into.
"It's . . . changed," he repeats, sounding distracted. "A deviant, latent code. It's giving a series of commands, and is using Tony's mind to execute them."
Tony shrugs it on, standing, batting at some dirt that clings to his legs. It barely reaches mid-thigh, but it works.
The gravel digs into his elbows and palms, and if he just relaxed against Tony, it'd stop, but he can't bring himself to. This isn't happening, Tony didn't want it to happen, he didn't want to get drunk, he wouldn't want Steve to remember this.
Tony's eyes widen; Steve's not usually that easy, but he's being given a ridiculous amount of motivation.  Still, he swallows it all, breathing rapidly through his nose.
Knowing that it's probably all in his head doesn't stop his yawn, though
"So am I. It's more my fault than yours," he says. Default line. Steve's heard the same speech from about everyone involved with the attack – from the judge who was supposed to hear the case, to a card from Hill – except the people who actually did it; Red Skull and company.
"Maybe he called in sick."
He wrenches the car up and back, and allows gravity to do its thing, dropping like a rock out the now upside down vehicle. Two of the suits dodge in time, but one flies into the grill, and the explosion warms Steve's back as he falls.
Fatigue hits Steve for the first time when he sees the clock; almost midnight. He's not supposed to get tired anymore, the serum was supposed to get rid of that, and maybe it did. Maybe this is just mental, Steve thinks he should be tired; so he convinces himself he is.
He shakes his head. "Not– obviously, but not right now. But I'm – I really shouldn't have come here, I'm sorry."
"Have you spoken to our lord about it?" Fandral asks. "Have you made amends?"
When he doesn't want to be seen, it's all but impossible to spot him.
Tony spreads his legs the moment he's set down, and Steve wasn't the only one who'd enjoyed the earlier performance. He pulls Steve between his thighs, and half smiles, fingering the mask.  "It's so different."
"It's Wanda all over again," Simon says, sounding surprisingly numb, tipping his head up as a jet blasts overhead.
"Where did Reed go?" he grumbles, directly into Steve's back, the rest of him utterly limp over Steve's shoulder.
"I notice we're going east," Steve says. "Making Sam's place behind us."
"Join Steven, Stark," Thor says, eyes trained forward. "While I bat Hogun around a little."
A second explosion, louder this time, and Steve backs out of the lab. "I have to go. Keep me updated."
"Cap," Tony says, lifting the faceplate. Steve's actually startled; he'd gotten so used to the haggard, worn man. A bright-eyed, well-rested and apparently remade Tony is disarmingly gorgeous.
And yes, Steve can easily see Tony sacrificing his relationship with Pepper if he's somehow convinced himself it's his only option.
"IwanttoshieldCapmakehimsafe–"
"We're the Stealth Avengers."
"The Avengers are here!"
"Steve, you wouldn't be looking at me like -" he gestures, practically accusatory, at Steve's face. "Obviously I - I was compromised enough yesterday," he says this with clear, sheer disgust at his imagined, weak self. "To lie to you, tell you whatever you wanted to hear. I'm going to apologize now, and you're going to forget it happened, and - Steve, seriously, stop looking at me like that."
Thor grips his hammer, then nods. "I will allow it."
"Yeah, I came back. Same week as you, but," Jack shrugs. "Jack of Hearts doesn't make front page when he's competing with Captain America."
was . . . safe to think about. He was so far from my reality -- almost a fantasy.  I didn't want to think about a
Tony shrugs. "I'm not broken."
Steve does trust Castle – to be fast and ruthless, to let any possible grief he might have with Tony lie, and – more than he trusts the entire back up team – he trusts him to be able to take down Crossbones.
"A very well organized one," Tony says, dropping down cross-legged, opening boxes, ripping open plastic wraps with his teeth. "Their secret lair was lined with filing cabinets."
"Cloning duplicates a living being. It's like making an artificial twin," Tony says. "It's . . . well, morally questionable."
"Denver or Tokyo? Toronto? Los Angeles? They're all flattened."
Walking down the street.
Tony braces for impact, and Steve can make out his eyes closing tight from his position on the sidelines. He should've gotten him a mouth guard.
It's probably the courteous thing, to take the few steps away from Reed's workspace for their conversation, but Steve still frowns when taking the handful of steps that put Reed and Tony out of his eye line.
"The order came from Stark himself," Bucky continues. "And when she asked, he didn't give any reason for it. Didn't bother with an excuse."
Steve's only gone a moment; there's a chain of fast food restaurants within walking distance. Tony's resting against the wall, device finished - actually polished, there's a real gleam despite its otherwise makeshift appearance – in front of him by the time he gets back, though. His head is tipped back, eyes closed, and one opens when Steve enters. He smiles, grabbing his bag of obscenely greasy fast food. "Thanks."
But Steve is facing east on 87th street, so he'll keep facing east on 87th, moving forward until backup arrives.
He rests a heavy head on Steve's shoulder.  "You said you have it all week?"
He's still not sure if the armor's protection managed to fight it off, or if they just backed off.
One he's distracted from, as Tony starts breathing just a little deeper at the sight of Steve's cock, as he usually does.  Pulls it free like it's a prize, like it's something to be cherished, careful and deliberate touches.  It gets Steve at least half hard every time. "And you'd say something about how good I am at this," he says, then mouths the head.  Steve hisses tightly, fingers flexing in his hair.
It feels odd to be wearing it again, but judging from Tony's slack jawed expression when he opened the door to his office to find Steve leaning on the desk, not nearly as jarring to see it again.
"It's just that when all my fantasies come true in one effortless swoop, I'm usually trapped in virtual reality by a psychopath or experiencing a lucid hallucination," Tony says, lightly.
"I don't doubt it," Steve says. "You're the smartest man I know." It just hits him sometimes, how incredible everything Tony makes actually is. It's easy to take for granted, after a decade or so.
"For the sake of my lord's honor."
"No," Steve says. "You didn't say anything you didn't mean."
"Cap," Tony gasps, fingers flexing uselessly against the smooth table finish.  Steve falters; he's not sure Tony's ever called him that during sex.  Sure enough, Tony's eyes are open, fixed on Steve, on his mask. His different mask, the one he fantasized about -- the one he idolized, and Jesus, normally that makes Steve feel awkward, uncomfortable, but now . . .
"Where are you going with this?"
"Is this the satellite that vexes you?" Thor asks, outside the window, hoisting a mess of metal and wires the size of a minivan above his head.
It's a very easy thing to get overwhelmed in a situation like this; every direction Steve looks reveals a new emergency to be taken care of. There are streets of people that still need that final push to start evacuating, potential injuries, he knows looting has already started, and there are prisons getting swallowed whole by convicts who have realized the power's out.
Steve actually feels pretty calm about the entire thing – relatively speaking, on the scale of one to ten on losing everything you own, he's probably registering on a pretty solid four – until he hears Tony's voice.
Sam could never understand why Steve admires him for that.
Within minutes, Steve is watching Fandral, who's apparently warmed to Tony, giving combat advice with wide, exaggerated demonstrations of different sword maneuvers, which Tony watches closely.
They hadn't expected an entire army of inept bigots. This is bad. SHIELD's descended below having information leaked; the black hats are out- maneuvering them.
06/15/09 0032 -5
Mister Fantastic, stretching to pick through the flaming remains of their car and – he's worked with Susan for years now, and it's still a little disarming how utterly gorgeous she is, it takes Steve a beat to even notice the large green monster that had attacked them is being held three feet off the ground up by a force field.
"Of course, of course, I am Volstagg the valiant," says the redheaded, round-stomached man, large hands cradling his impressive girth.
"Tony isn't a mass murderer."
"Who are these guys?" he asks.
Tony laughs, and says no, and surges up and – bites down hard on Steve's lip.
To be fair, Steve tells him about both Elisa Waters from down the street and James Ashley, who worked at the local grocery, but nothing's going to top Tony's admission. Not even the valentines he anonymously sent James, and then was too embarrassed to own up to, even when caught more or less red handed. Steve teases him lightly, and then the subject drops.
"I, ah. I told you yesterday about Sin - we found her, and Crossbones." The easy part, obviously. Where Sin goes, a grossly high mortality rate is sure to follow, which isn't exactly inconspicuous. Catching and restraining her, however, can be tricky.
"I should be helping Reed."
Clenching down hard on his cock, he milks a second orgasm out of Steve, and it's Tony that makes a soft, high noise as he's filled with Steve's come.
"Fifteen," a strong voice calls suddenly.  The crowd collectively freezes, and turns to stare at Tony Stark, who's watching the auctioneer with a steady, collected gaze.  There's a beat of silence.
The goatee scratches more than Steve thought it would, and he likes it more than he would've thought, the constant reminder of who this is. Tony breathes, hot and dry against Steve's still closed lips. And this time it's Tony bringing their lips together, a desperate, broken moan, eyes closed tight.
"Extremis should be purged completely within the next thirty minutes, we'll know then."
Steve turns back to the mess of arguing, splintered heroes and villains. This is chaos. Steve grips his shield, "Avengers!"
"Can you take it out?"
"Almost two hours." He closes his eyes when he takes a bite, moans, and it makes Steve hungry again just watching. Tony licks each finger before using a napkin when he finishes, and the sight is so comfortable and companionable it distracts him enough that he actually needs a minute to figure out what Tony's referring to when he suddenly starts speaking again, tone just mildly defensive.
"You thought it was me," Tony says, and isn't accusatory at all. It's bland. Resigned.
"Last year," Steve says, ramming one from behind, which goes tumbling forward into a second, and they both slam into the wall, cracking plaster. "As you remember it, Peter's aunt died."
"Tony?" Steve asks, then again, more insistent, "Tony?"
"Why are they still attacking?" he asks, currently using evasive maneuvers on a trio of pursuing Iron Man armor, then a steep, sudden dive to dodge a jet's stream of energy blasts.
"Need an assist?" Hank Pym's voice, magnified as it always is at this size, booms over the sound of metal crunching, screeching, bending as he crumples the car in his hands like so much paper.
He breathes deep. Twice. Pinching at the bridge of his nose.
"Won't you have to get a signal to do that?" Steve asks. "Let him in your head?"
"We'll know where he's operating from."
"We really don't have much information – we're reporting everything as we get it. We can't even verify that this was an attack," says Murray. "The Fantastic Four, ten blocks down, have been unavailable for comment. All we know is that what remains of the upper tier of Stark Tower is now dust, powdering the streets around me."
Relief, but it's only there for half a second, it snaps immediately to anger, at a level that surprises even himself.
Steve stares, then nods. "These kids are untrained. We want to try to disarm them before they kill themselves and anyone close enough to get caught in it. I'm going in. When it thins out, call down for the backup assault team, try to avoid casualties–"
He ignores the councilmember. Castle's thorough in his hits, if nothing else. "– and make it fast, Punisher's probably on his way now."
"That makes no sense." Could Osborn's tools really be that advanced? Tony had told him he'd more than likely got his tech from the Skrulls, so he supposes it's possible. But if Reed's scanners couldn't even pick it up, what chance did Tony's two hour RadioShack device stand of tracing it?
Steve tries hard not to think about the clever young man that had been his partner, wiser than he had any right to be, his wicked sense of humor, the easy conversations they had. Because it shows on his face when he does, it makes things worse. He tries, and fails, to not think of the sacrifice that Bucky made, that left him this shell. The people who made him like this to begin with. Robbed him of a life.
He does deserve to hear more, but it would be better if they wait until morning, because Steve can't think of a single way to start that won't be a little much after the conversation they just had, and he suddenly has a wide array of much more pleasurable ways to occupy himself, as long as Tony agrees to stay pressed against him like he is.
"What sort of trap? A virus?" Steve demands. What is it doing? Slowly eating at Tony's brain? "Could they be tracking us now?"
She ignores him completely, forcing her way through to Tony.
Steve almost wants to land and poke around. He can't stop looking down at the building – it's practically complete, it looks like all that's left are details, a paintjob, the glass for the windows, railings and doors.
Twenty-thousand dollars.
A tremendous CRASH interrupts him, however, and the car shakes violently under his hands, Tony swearing in surprise. It's the kind of impact that takes years of training to work out; without it Steve would've been at a loss to place its source, because it certainly felt like the world at large had simply started shaking the car like a kid with a snow globe.
"That's–"
Steve stretches as he stands, until his back gives a satisfying pop. The sun's just beginning to rise, and there are two sites Sin's likely to show up at in the next few hours, already getting swarmed and prepped by teams. Steve's waiting for a call from Reyes. Considering SHIELD's luck as of late, if Steve were to pick one in advance, she'd be at the other. Or at some third, utterly unrelated city, just for the fun of it.
vulgar or real.  Finding . . . relief in old war posters.
"Hm. Interesting. Preliminary scans show no signs of foreign interference."
There's a team of SHIELD agents in full riot gear setting up a makeshift base on the corner that visibly cheer at Steve's approach.
"We should get moving," Steve says, the image sufficiently sobering.
No one told him? Then again – it had been more Sam and Bucky's story to tell, they'd always been there, given their direct approval before sharing it.
". . . Outside of bad guys?"
"Cap?" West is staring at Steve, hand on Gawrych's shoulder. "Do you need a backup team to that second site?"
"Wait," Steve says. If it was an emergency, she wouldn't have used his phone. But she had, probably because he'd been too caught up to call her hours before, and he feels a faint stab of guilt, hoping she hadn't thought he'd given up on her.
Rhodes gives him a searching look, then nods back, curtly.
"Still," Steve says, but relaxes against the bottom of the desk.
He gives a frustrated groan; what on Earth has Tony gotten himself into?
"With science," Hogun says.
Bucky nods. "She seemed . . . relieved to get it off her chest," he says this in the cold, confused voice he gets every now and then, when he talks about emotion. Like he's not quite sure how it works, not sure about his own conclusions. "Stark hasn't spoken directly to War Machine in a year. Refuses to take his calls, and deletes all texts and emails from him without reading them."
"I designed it, Steve."
"No, I wasn't painting targets on the backs of local authorities."
"Oh, right! Sorry. Right. I'll talk to you -"
"Right now, I'm more concerned with being her friend," Steve says. "I don't think that'll change anytime soon."
"Thank you for the status report."
"I've got this."
"Cancel that order. Stand-by for back up. Castle," he grits his teeth. "You're on Crossbones."
"Just a minute," he says, the pen in his hand moving furiously against the clipboard in the other.
"Someone using Extremis-level tech has been sabotaging missions."
"You said that Tony helped you while I was gone. Saved your life."
" . . . I don't have anything else to tell you," Bucky says, awkwardly.
"What's the last thing you remember?" he asks, finally; upfront is best.
"There's supposed to be a safety . . . after shooting, it deactivates for a ninety hours. It's in the design, even I couldn't override it," he says. "I wasn't so out of it that I would've showed up at your door if I'd known it was possible. I apologize, as much good as that does now."
"It's okay," he forces out. He's sure it is, too, just . . . Tony drunk and Tony unable to control himself, it's something he'd rather deal with clinically, from a distance. Not press up against, get any level of . . . pleasure out of.
"I thought you weren't being followed." It's colder than he thought it would sound. He likes it, though, and a small part of him likes the flinch it inspires.
"Fascist," sneers a young woman, what little hair not buzzed close to her scalp bleached blond, in a startling display of ignorance. But they comply.
"Your armor doesn't have nukes, does it?" Steve asks. "Tell me you don't have that level of destructive capacity orbiting the earth."
He steps away and they immediately swarm, fingers running across it, tracing the engraving.
"I think there are a few other Hulks left, but," Cassie shrugs, hoisting a fallen billboard off the street, onto a roof. "You had to wake up early for the exciting parts."
"How have you been?" Jack of Hearts asks, taking his hand. The purplish-black sheen that once covered half of him has spread; his entire body is now that same inky, polished color. It gives him a strangely exotic look, although the solid white of both eyes is slightly unnerving. He must've been truly out of it to not have noticed the man as soon as he entered the lab; he's not exactly inconspicuous, and an Avenger, and had died. Twice.
"Osborn hacking your head."
Steve watches for a moment, then drops his arm. They've got this.
"It just . . . didn't seem like a possibility," Tony says, pulls free, down a step and dragging Steve with him. "I'm not even sure it's happening now."
"Twenty-thousand," he says.
"It's almost four in the morning, Maria," Tony says. "How did you even find us?" And then she punches him in the face.
Steve knows Brock Rumlow. He won't drag it out with someone like Tony. He'll use the dagger. Fast, painless. He pull it out as he approaches Tony on the bed. Cover his mouth, and blue eyes will barely have a chance to open in surprise before thin, sharpened metal presses against his neck. And slices.
"We need that Hensen woman, Reed," Sue, still working at the ties around her robe, says.
"Peter got me hooked on this," Tony says the name with forced nonchalance, then finally takes the first bite of his burger, as Steve takes the last of his. The fact that Peter will probably never speak to Tony again is uncomfortably loud in the silence.
Wordlessly, he swallows, and sighs, and steps back, cocking his head. This is too long a story to be told standing in a dark hallway.
"What were you saying, though," Tony asks in a grunt, blocking his Hill's hits, stabbing somewhat wildly at its neck with the knife he grabbed. "How you came back."
"No, I'm saying . . . I'm not losing it. Going mad with power. I need you to know that."
"Yes, of course. It's just one line of code."
Steve braces himself as he opens the door, pulling his shield out, although they're probably not lucky enough that the Hulk decided to just hang around until they decided to join him.
"A headache, but he's fine," Sue says, then gives Tony's back a narrow sort of look. He's leaning rather heavily on the ledge of the building; it could easily be exaggerated nonchalance, or exhaustion, but she clearly isn't fooled. "He's not–"
"I assumed I was his only target," Tony says, pretty obviously thinking the same thing as Steve; where else has Osborn been shooting that thing?
"What the hell," a familiar voice, and a familiar grip on his wrist hoists Steve up, "did you do to my apartment?"
"This is Carter. Leave a message."
"Shit–" Tony says suddenly, flinging himself back, slamming into Steve's side, scrambling to regain his drunken balance. Steve immediately sees why; a large, green hand is coming up from over the side, the metal of the door bending and cracking under its grip, finally popping open under its weight. Steve struggles to keep the car upright as Hulk clings to it in midair.
"He's isolating himself," he says. "Methodically."
"Stark Industries–"
"Apparently it's not quite as simple as Reed thought. But I should have these kids fixed in a minute–"
Tony had felt like he meant it in the hall; Steve's well aware of Tony's reputation, but – well, it's probably foolish to judge the level of someone's commitment on a kiss, but Steve finds it hard to believe this would just be a fling to him.
"That was an analogy," Tony says, blandly. "And psychics have always been able to 'hack' into minds. The brain isn't all that different from a processor to begin with, they handle information and commands in remarkably similar ways."
"You use science to make metals fight for you," Hogun adds, which isn't particularly relevant, but apparently bothers him, and they are airing their grievances.
The clink of plate set on the table draws his attention back to Tony. He's blinking, still out of it, but more human looking than not now, running a hand through hopelessly messy hair. Cheap red sauce is staining the corners of his lips orange, just a dab or two in his moustache, and he looks about as far removed from wealthy, sophisticated socialite as possible.
Tony smirks at him from over the bundles of wires, cannibalized alarm clock and GPS system. Steve's reminded of fourth grade science, Miss Kane turning off the lights, closing the windows and using nothing but a wire and a lemon to light up her desk. It had seemed like magic. He'd had such a crush on her.
"Consider it your birthday present," Tony says.
"Did I apologize for SHRA?" Tony asks. "Because that was a lie."
"Uh. Status?" Steve asks.
"Sam doesn't hate you."
"You're not killing Sin, either."
In a fair, one on one fight, Steve could take Synthia easily. She's undisciplined, her effectiveness is product only of her enthusiasm in killing – even Juggernaut shows some restraint when barreling down a crowded street of innocents. Sin sees each loss of life as a bonus.
"And you're not on a plane to go talk to her?"
"It was a mistake," Tony agrees. "I've made a lot of them."
Steve sees him coming out the corner of his eye; he's just so certain the man will move that he doesn't bother to step out of the way, too busy hoisting an older woman to her feet. He is wrong, and a body barrels directly into his side, sheer enthusiasm almost knocking them both over.
Damn it. Damn it.
There's no rush of realization, it was with a clear head that Steve bent, and pressed their lips together, but there is a steadily building feeling of euphoria; his chest filling with it, excitement, and he funnels it into yet another kiss, another series of scratches against his jaw and upper lip, nails against his shoulders. This is real, this is still happening, Tony wants it; maybe they'll never have to stop.
The man smiles shakily at Steve's outright shock, leaning heavily on the wall.
"I destroyed a lot of property," Tony says, with a self deprecating nod.
At three stories, Steve's eye level with Bill's shoulder, and he sees in particularly gruesome detail what decomposition does to a fifty foot corpse; the gaping wound in his chest has widened and weakened, dark, wet chunks falling with each step. A piece of cheek swings, loose and held on by threads, before breaking free and falling with a soft slap on the street below.
"Punish– The Punisher?" Gawrych sputters, looking pale, and Steve goes to see what remains of his home at the sound of Reyes attempting to calm him.
And Steve does.  Tony's legs over his shoulders, inch by inch, wrapping one hand around Tony's previously ignored cock, he slowly forces his way into the man, into his heat, into clenching warmth. Blindingly good.  "Perfect, Tony," he grits out.  God, and it is.
"You heard the man!" he says. "Luke, you're with Bobbi, Peter with me. Let's go!"
"Ever meet Pepper Potts's kids?"
"Not a mutant," Tony says. "I'm a normal, mundane mortal without my armor."
"Gawrych is still in there," says West. "Five of our men are with him, they secured the basement. A few injuries but nothing serious on our side. A few fatalities on their side – hard to keep track. They swarmed, Cap, too fast to pull Gawrych out."
"Asgard!" Volstagg says emotionally, obviously bothered by the memory. "Of course your science creation is too weak to cause true damage against the home of gods, but some of our most favorite possessions became one with the air right before our eyes!"
Castle's gone, although Steve hadn't expected him to stick around. The longer he waits, the harder time he'll have getting Gawrych dead and buried. And other self-imposed obligations to maim and murder, Steve's sure.
"No."
Hogun and Fandral both have to duck to make it through the door. Volstagg, larger than life, has to bend, squish and eventually force his way through, sideways. The customers, well acquainted to the havoc that tends to accompany gigantic people dressed in bright colors, thin out as the Asgardians take their seats, murmuring to each other in vague approval at the plastic plants and bland wallpaper.
"Uh, Reed, don't you have like, twelve blob monsters in cages in here? That could be escaping right now?" Johnny says.
?" Tony laughs.  "Did you tell them
"Tomorrow," Steve prompts, escorting him to the door. There'll be another disaster they'll be trying to explain tomorrow.
"Why did you come here?" Blunt. But Steve is beginning to suspect his earlier assumption was wrong, and it's hard to be happy, or patient, or friendly about it.
"Fuck–" Tony's shaking his leg; a Hill, barely functioning and missing one eye, dragged itself across the floor and grabbed his ankle.
But Sin is smart enough to stack the deck before starting any game. Not only has she taken the high ground, she's surrounded herself with suicidal lackeys, literally jumping on Steve as he climbs, forcing him to cause real damage before letting go: cracking ribs, snapping fingers, howls of pain. It's slow-going. It's, quite honestly, a pathetic display.
Tony's settled on his haunches, head tipped back, pupils blown and eyes half lidded. He's clearly not awake, still loose and relaxed, and for a moment, looks like the Tony Steve remembers – fresh faced and - really, with his hair so disheveled, cheeks so defined - beautiful. But the immediate, constant worry, of course, taints it.
"Those old propaganda posters," Tony explains, and it's such a rarity to see the man embarrassed -- the tips of his ears are actually going pink. "My history professor had the first editions hanging on his wall.  One year they were right by my desk."
"He, uh, hated their happiness."
Steve hesitates. "What's that mean?"
It's ridiculous, how hard Tony gets him, and how fast. Leaning over the man, resting his weight in a fist beside his head, Steve stretches him.  Watches his expressions, from tense with discomfort, to pleasure, to desperation.
"Nay, our search for the Avenger called Iron Man has led us across all paths of the world," says the man in the middle, tall and fat, with a startlingly red beard and, as if that weren't enough, wearing bright pink. "He has a myriad hearths and towers, we have searched them all."
"Try false imprisonment. Their files are wiped," Gawrych laughs. "You've got nothing on me, I'm a free man, so you'd best remove–" And then he drops, utterly limp in Steve's grip, and it takes him a moment to process the bullet hole in the back of the man's head, because a shot fired from De Lisle is quite literally silent; cocking it back makes more noise.
"The rest of us will focus on evacuating, and the jets." Everything else SHIELD is throwing at them only has one go; once a car is smashed, it's smashed. Jets have multiple rounds of ammunition, they need to get them on the ground.
And if he doesn't remember, Steve will just remind him.
"Fix them," Peter says. "Fix them now."
Even with his enhanced reflexes, Steve can't follow the majority of the battle. He could hear it, certainly, smashes of metal on metal, but except for moments of stillness– Hogun is slammed into the air, smashing into the ground - they just move too fast to see.
"It's a little more than that," Steve says.
"Steve," Tony says in a low, content- sounding hum, voice practically rumbling. "We need to run."
"I believed you the first time you said it. It's alright."
"Every day, it hurt. Even when you came back, it still . . . " his deep inhalation is wet and shaking. "I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
Why did he leave him alone? He knew Tony didn't have his armor. He knew people were after him. He should've asked Bucky to keep watch.
"You alright?" Steve asks. He'd instinctively stopped the roll with himself on top, shielding Tony's body from the potential explosion.
Tony stares, thumb and pointer finger working at some frayed fabric. Then he glances at the back door, the dust covered television, the pictures. It had been stuffy when they first entered, dark and obviously abandoned. Tony had waited by the door, arms stiff at his side, as Steve went through, opening windows, letting some air in.
"Yes it is." Steve doesn't bother undressing him except for his shoes, and Tony battles the sheets on his own, admirably. They end up half wrapped around his body, and he seems content with that.
And maybe not.
He'd obviously been willing, but Tony has a new attachment to go along with each escapade. But – Steve wouldn't just be one of the many. He said as much. Steve relaxes slightly when he recalls that, replays it in his mind, clings to it.
Steve tracks down the highest ranking agent there – a level five – Agent West, who's handling the situation remarkably well.
And so, he learns what Tony Stark was up to this summer.
It's kind of hard to swallow that Dodd had been unaware of the mass destruction Sin tends to cause when he hired her, the piles and piles of bodies she leaves behind, but somehow, he must've been oblivious to how very public she is about the entire thing. Entire families are left bullet-riddled, bodies still resting where they'd been when she and Crossbones  kicked in their doors, barely given time to react. Pools of blood in front of the television, staining mattresses of beds shaped like race cars, around a dinner table. Backyard swing sets. Indiscriminate.
“Not what Dean Coulson said, and I doubt he’ll be so generous next time you fuck up,” Pepper said, leveling Tony with a look that could cut glass. “Stay out of trouble, at least for the rest of the semester.”
“Hello Steve, I don’t know if we’ve properly met, I’m Pepper, Natasha’s girlfriend,” she said, patting him on the shoulder. Steve nodded, still a little caught up in his own mind to put together an answer. “I thought you should know that Tony has never been here before, and definitely doesn’t know where the bathroom is, and if you want to prevent him from being lost in this maze of a dorm, you should go after him.” She nudged him forward, enough to propel him out of his seat as her words sank in. “I do believe Tony is quite smitten with you, though he would absolutely kill me if he heard me say it. And I know you can’t date right now, while you’re still his student, but I was hoping maybe you could be inspired to pursue him, possibly at the end of the semester.” She raised an eyebrow, as if she didn’t already know the answer. Steve nodded again, swallowing before looking in the direction Tony had run off.
“Jesus, Tony,” he panted. He let his eyes close as Tony sucked at his pulse point right below his ear that made more blood rush from his brain to his-
“Yeah, working through it slowly,” Steve chuckled, glancing down at the paper in his lap. “Guess I’ll have to pick it up tomorrow, they don’t seem very keen on studying anymore tonight.” He nodded at Clint and Rhodey, who had picked up controllers and were starting an intense game of Mario Kart. Natasha and Pepper were curled up together on the other armchair, Natasha running her hands through Pepper’s hair and softly talking to her about whatever the boys had gotten into lately. Even Thor and Bruce seemed engrossed in their own conversation, talking about how mythical beings could have been mutated forms of basic creatures. Tony laughed, feeling light and happy that his friends so easily blended with Natasha’s friends. His hand drifted towards Steve unconsciously, brushing up against his arm. They both startled before settling in roughly the same position, this time purposefully leaning in each other’s space. Tony couldn’t look away from those bright blue eyes if a nuclear explosion happened outside. Steve smiled, shy and hesitant, but certainly hopeful.
Tony scowled at her, even though he loved her dearly. Sometimes, he wished they had worked out as a couple, but it turns out Pepper can only handle so much of Tony’s bullshit, and Tony wasn’t willing to compromise his, often dangerous, work.
“Oh, yeah, well,” he stuttered, and honestly, Steve could not find him any cuter than right at this moment. “Your dorm is very confusing, I tried to find the bathrooms and I couldn’t find them anywhere and then I wanted to run back to my own dorm where I knew there would be a bathroom and then I couldn’t find a door out I mean you don’t have the exits clearly marked, and that’s totally a fire safety hazard, I feel like you should report it to your coach or even the dean I mean that seems like something that ought to be fixed right away-“
, and anything involving them outside of tutoring was a bad idea.
“No, not happening, I am not going to see Steve at this god-awful hour,” Tony whined. As much as he wanted to see his favorite student, Steve was still his
“Guys, stop throwing school supplies,” Steve sighed, grabbing the paper and neatly tossing it in the recycling bin. “We need to focus.”
“Hi, sorry, are you Tony?” the guy said. He was a mythical god come to life, and Tony's seen plenty of statues and pictures from Thor’s books to have an accurate comparison.
“By the way, thank you again for tutoring me, I really appreciate it,” Steve said, turning his wide, happy puppy dog eyes on Tony.
“Of course, my pleasure, but are you sure you’re alright to have tutoring today?” Tony asked, his face pinched in concern. Steve shrugged as if it meant nothing that he seemed bone tired.
“This is ridiculous, none of my friends are on my side,” Tony complained. “I don’t like him, and I don’t talk about him
“Not what you told me last time you talked about him, which is every hour of every day,” Sam said, raising one eyebrow as if to challenge Steve to disagree. He was technically right, Steve guessed, but it was only because Tony was so nice to help him with his computer science course. He liked to mention that Tony was incredibly smart, and if that meant also raising his own intelligence level to try and compete with Tony’s friends, well that was just another perk to tutoring.
“Correct,” Steve said, smiling back.
“Studying for history exam then?” he asked, for once in his life quieted by the intimacy of a small shared space.
“Tony, it’s 10pm, I’ve seen you go to bed at 4am when you have an 8am exam,” Rhodey argued, dragging Tony to his feet. “You gotta support Pep, and her wonderful girlfriend who brings us her attractive friends.”
“Wait, are we really inviting them over?” Steve asked, panic beginning to set in his chest and crawl up his throat.
“Okay, but if there are more people coming, we should definitely get food,” Sam suggested. That got Bucky’s attention, and he shot up from his position on the couch to be right side up once again. He grimaced at the rush of blood, but blinked it away quickly to beam at Sam.
“If this is about Steve, I will not hear one more comment about his appearance or personality,” Bruce replied, eyes glued to his screen. He maneuvered himself to the couch, pushing Rhodey to the side. “My research on organism mutation is almost done, and I will not be distracted by your schemes, Tony.”
“You only wanna go because they said they’re grabbing McDonald’s for all of us,” Tony grumbled, even if his stomach also agreed with this argument.
much. Besides, you’re the ones always saying don’t get myself in trouble, and I think dating a student of mine is very much asking for trouble.”
“C’mon Steve, it’s not that late, no way Fury could prevent you from studying with friends, and if that happens to include your very hot tutor, then so be it,” Bucky reasoned.
Tony had run off somewhere, saying he needed a bathroom, even though Steve was pretty sure he had never been here before and had no idea where the bathrooms were. Steve was still trying to think through what happened, because he really didn’t know himself. One second, he was arguing with Thor and Clint about usual stuff, and the next Tony waltzed in the room in sweatpants that clung to his hips and, as later discovered, his ass. And then he sat on the armchair with that very ass right next to Steve, and he had to pretend he didn’t notice it there every single millisecond, which was incredibly difficult and very energy-consuming, especially when Tony looked at him with warm brown eyes that dug into his
“So, how’s it goin with Mr. All American?” Rhodey asked a few weeks later, after Tony came back from a particularly frustrating session.
Steve grabbed Tony’s waist and pulled him gently towards him with one arm, cupping his cheek with the other. Tony sputtered and looked wildly around until Steve guided his chin to face him, and he saw it in Tony’s eyes. He was terrified, and excited, and very, very hopeful. So was Steve.
“Can we take a snack break?” Bucky asked from his upside-down position on the couch.
“Might wanna watch, if you take Bucky’s seat while he’s gone, he’ll inevitably fight you for it,” Steve said, smiling at them. At Tony. Very much at Tony. It was like a moth to a flame, how Tony seemed to naturally gravitate towards him. He rested on the arm of the chair, hesitantly smiling and nodding towards Steve’s notes.
“Don’t encourage him, please,” Pepper sighed, finally looking up from her book. “Tony does not need to get in any more trouble this year. The dean is still pissed about him blowing up the lab, and not even Howard Stark’s money can make a school scandal with the football captain go away.”
It was already 4:02, but he didn’t expect his student to show up until at least 5 after. They always seemed to be running behind when it came to tutoring sessions. He ignored the doorway, choosing instead to focus on his screen. Seconds later, a knock at the door had him looking up.
“Don’t, I don’t need any more stress on my patience today,” Tony groaned, throwing himself in his favorite armchair and closing his eyes. Pepper shifted her eyes over to them momentarily from her book, muttering “boys” under her breath.
“Because you hadn’t told us about Steve at Halloween, and I thought we agreed you were staying out of trouble, which means avoiding interactions with Steve outside of tutoring,” Pepper stated matter-of-factly. Tony grumbled in reluctant agreement.
“Oh god, why are you in the middle of the hallway?” Clint yelled. Tony jumped away in surprise before sliding quickly back to Steve to hide both of their erections.
“It’s true, you never shut up about him,” Pepper added, without even a glance in their direction.
“Hey, you took off,” Steve said, as softly as he could, but Tony still jumped a mile in the air before whipping around to face him.
“Which is a fantastic reason to go on top of all the other great reasons,” Rhodey insisted. Tony stopped actively resisting, but he made Rhodey pull him along like a toddler who doesn’t want to take his nap. “You’re telling me you don’t wanna see this Greek god who you have yet to introduce me to.”
He stared at his phone, the number burned in his memory. He was assigned a new student to tutor, which was always nice, but it was in a subject he hadn’t even glanced at in years. Intro Programming, topics he learned before he could talk. But of all the tutors, he was the resident computer genius. He circled the classrooms once more, their empty tables and blank whiteboards begging him to scribble over and make a mess like his workshop.
“I have an incredibly cooperative digestive system,” Steve stated, grabbing some fries from the table. “I can eat whatever as long as I keep up my exercise regime.”
“Yeah, of course, I don’t want you to get in trouble or anything,” Steve agreed immediately. “But, I don’t know if I can keep my hands off of you during tutoring anymore.” He traced lines down Tony’s spine, feeling him shiver.
“Your trash taste in reading is not gonna be on the exam tomorrow,” Sam shot back, throwing a wad of scrap paper at his head.
The halls weren’t terribly complicated. It’s just one long hallway, but it still took Steve a good 5 minutes to find him. Tony had somehow circled all the way around, but he couldn’t find the right hallway that would take him to the exit. That’s where Steve found him, spinning in circles and obviously trying not to scream in frustration.
“Tony, c’mon, Thanksgiving break is in like a week, you don’t actually have super important assignments coming up, and the assignments that you do have you already finished like a month ago, I know it,” Bruce said, for once actually joining them in their late night adventures.
“Boys, you know Pepper, this is James and Tony,” Natasha introduced them, waving a hand in their general direction. “This is Thor, Clint, and Steve.”
Steve laughed. “Just not at programming, where it counts,” he said, watching as Tony tried to think of some contradiction.
“Sam and Bucky went to get the food, they should be back in a couple minutes,” Natasha said, grabbing Pepper's hand and leading them to a larger room similar to their own common room. Thor and Clint were already there, arguing with Steve about some fighting technique that supposedly could be helpful in football. They all looked up when Natasha entered the room, but only Steve’s eyes stayed in their direction when the rest of them followed. When he saw Tony, and took in Tony’s appearance, his eyes widened a fraction of an inch, and Tony almost squirmed under the intensity.
“I have always been interested in school, that’s why I’m here, Bucky,” Steve replied tightly, pursing his lips in a fine line. “And don’t call him that. He’s not a playboy.”
“Thanks, but I’m more interested in not getting
“Yeah, thank you so much for tutoring me,” Steve said, throwing his backpack on the spare chair. Tony watched as the chair Steve chose miraculously didn’t break with the force of him collapsing in clear exhaustion.
“They have many classes together and multiple mutual friends,” Pepper argued, glaring at Rhodey. “Which, did I mention, includes Tony’s boy toy?”
“No, I don’t, because I don’t want to lose my job,” Tony once again reminded them. “I’m not allowed to even socialize platonically with my students, this is very against the rules.”
“So, I was thinking we should maybe talk about this? And keep it between us, at least until the end of the semester?” Tony suggested, raising his eyebrows as if asking if that were okay.
“Oh for God’s sake Tony, when have you ever obeyed the rules?” Pepper rolled her eyes, choosing to keep her head forward in the direction of the athlete’s dorms. The others followed close behind her. It wasn’t cold, per se, but it was definitely on the chillier side. Fall was well underway, and the temperatures had been dipping lower and lower the past few days. Tony had changed into his comfy clothes, an old pair of sweatpants and his favorite hoodie, when he had thought they were staying
When he left, Tony slid his arms back around Steve and looked up to him with a smile.
“You’re certainly disturbing me, stop that! I’m right in front of you!” Clint screeched, throwing his hands in the air and storming back through the doorway to the common room.
“Absolutely not, you’ll distract them from studying, and Tony won’t get any work done himself,” Pepper threw back. “Besides, I don’t even know if he’s in her study group.”
“Should we get enough to feed like 10 people?” Sam asked.
Tony thought,
“Ooh see if Thor and Clint are up! We can really get this party goin,” Bucky said.
“I mean, you’re not so bad,” Tony offered, trying to smile behind an obvious lie. Steve stared at him before absolutely losing it, laughing at both Tony’s expression and his utter lack of computer knowledge.
“I live to break the rules, baby” Bucky said, raising his arms as high as he could while still lying upside-down.
“You’ve done like zero work, you should get us snacks,” Sam groaned, rubbing his head as if that would make the information absorb faster.
“Oooh, invite her and her study group over here! And tell her to bring Steve,” Rhodey suggested, throwing a conspiratorial grin at Tony.
“Well, I want to be in the army, but first I wanted to get a degree, and I liked the idea of maybe cyber tech and whatnot. Might have to change my career path,” Steve laughed.
After probably 3 more rounds, he finally found Room 6 tucked in the corner, on the more hidden side of the building. Quite perfect actually if he ever wanted some peace and quiet. The athletes were loud, and more often than not obnoxious, and while he loved tutoring them, he couldn’t hang out with them. All of his friends had a certain…quiet disposition that the loud bumbling athletes seemed to lack. He settled in, pulling out his laptop and choosing to tinker on one of his AI programs while he waited. He glanced at his phone once more.
“This is not a party, it’s a Thursday for goodness sakes,” Steve reminded them. “And we’re supposed to be studying.”
“Natasha said Thor and Clint are coming over too, they don’t have early classes tomorrow and they weren’t about to miss out on the fun,” Pepper informed them. Tony whined in a pitiful tone, which he would be embarrassed about if he could feel embarrassment around these people anymore.
Tony found out that while Steve sure had enthusiasm, he didn’t quite have the natural talent for coding that Tony possessed. It was incredibly taxing on Tony’s part, and his patience was certainly put to the test. The man could barely tell a class from a method for Christ’s sake, how was he supposed to write a whole program himself?
“What?” Tony snapped his head up from his laptop, which he grabbed somewhere in the middle of their argument. “Why didn’t you tell me? More to the point, why didn’t you get me invited?”
“You finally agree with my ideas, Sammy,” Buck said, throwing an arm over Sam’s shoulder. He grunted and threw the arm off, but not without smiling and rolling his eyes. “What’s closest and still open? McDonald’s? Anyone craving a thousand chicken nuggets and enough fries to drown us all?”
“Slow down buddy, you’ll get sick if you eat that fast,” Tony warned, smiling when Steve waved him off carelessly.
,” Steve said, his frustration building. “Tony and I are just friends, I mean we’re barely friends, he’s just my tutor.”
“Yeah, and his face, and his laugh, and everything about him.”
“B+,” he replied through a very foggy brain. Tony left a trail of kisses up Steve’s face, humming in agreement.
how good he looked. Tony jerked forward, and Steve felt more than heard him whimper into his mouth. Tony slid his lips down, kissing and sucking at Steve’s neck until he couldn’t breathe from how aroused he was.
“Don’t forget the honey mustard,” Natasha chimed in, throwing some cash at the two boys.
“If you want, I can invite Pepper and the crew over for a late night study group, I can almost guarantee Tony is with them,” Natasha offered, typing on her phone during their impromptu break, which was strictly not allowed during study times.
“Deal,” he whispered, pressing his lips against Steve’s, where they fit perfectly.
. And then, conversation happened, and Tony had made him laugh, and he made Tony laugh, and then all of a sudden it felt very much like Tony asked him on a date, a real date, but right after that, Tony sprinted away. Steve frowned, more than a little disappointed in himself for not holding onto Tony so he could tell him he’d love to meet with him outside of tutoring. Someone slid onto the opposite armrest, the one Tony wasn’t on, and when he looked over, he was met face to face with Pepper Potts.
“Must be nice, being one of the special elite who don’t have to worry about weight gain,” Tony teased, gently nudging his shoulder. Steve blushed, which was much cuter than it really deserved to be, and he mumbled something about being little that Tony didn’t catch and asked to clarify.
“We’re back, you trolls!” Bucky exclaimed, running into the common room with multiple bags of food. Tony and Steve jumped apart, and they avoided eye contact as Sam passed around cartons of nuggets and burgers, dumping a heap of fries on the table in the middle. Clint immediately grabbed a handful of fries, shoving them in his mouth as fast as possible to keep from delaying his game. Tony saw him breathing exaggeratedly fast, trying to cool the still very hot fries that were already in his mouth like a dragon. He snickered, which stopped when Clint managed to throw a cheeseburger right at Tony without looking away from the game. He shrugged and accepted the free food because, hey, flying food is always a good thing. Steve grabbed a box of nuggets for himself, offering some to Tony before inhaling 3 in quick succession.
“Well, you obviously must be doing something right,” Tony said. “You know, the school loves you, and you are really smart.”
for the night. And he didn’t have time to change between all the pulling and dragging from Rhodey. He just hoped Steve wouldn’t be disappointed he wasn’t in his typical, not tattered clothes. He shook his head at himself. Steve couldn’t be disappointed in something he wasn’t expecting in the first place.
“Besides, no way Coach Fury would kick you off the team,” Bucky added. “You’re his star player, his ticket back to coach stardom or whatever shit he’s spewing nowadays.”
“And yet, Sam Wilson, pilot extraordinaire, was invited, even though he barely knows her,” Rhodey complained.
“Really, it’s alright, I really appreciate you trying to help, but I think I might be a lost case when it comes to computer science,” Steve eventually conceded, wiping tears from his eyes. Tony shook his head, trying not to smile and failing.
Steve, he presumed, was at least 6’2”, with muscles to spare and legs for miles. Tony wouldn’t necessarily call himself athletic. He worked out when he had time, which was almost never. But this guy put any effort he attempted to shame. He watched as golden hair flopped in Steve’s eyes, which pierced him with an astonishingly bright blue gaze that still maintained an innocent puppy dog appearance.
“Sure, I mean, our exam isn’t until tomorrow evening, and Pepper would tell me if they needed to go to bed early,” Natasha shrugged.
“I did not blow up the lab, I only caused a minor explosion in the far wing,” he said. “No one was around, and that place was gathering dust before I got here anyways.”
“Well, it doesn’t matter, because nothing is going to happen between me and Tony,” Steve said, failing to hold back a sigh of disappointment. Tony was quite attractive, with his slender frame and his ever curious eyes. Steve would jump at the chance to ask him out, but he didn’t think Tony would go out with someone like Steve who was average intelligence at best, and just plain stupid at worst, especially when it came to what Tony’s studying. Steve had glanced at Tony’s laptop once in a while, and he saw multiple programs running in the background with equations he couldn’t read correctly, let alone understand. And not to even mention his ass, which almost killed Steve on site the first time Tony had bent down to grab his charger. It was round and perky and goddamnit if Steve didn’t have incredibly inappropriate thoughts about grabbing it during half of their sessions.
“I’m not-” Steve stopped himself and sighed. “I can’t like...men. I’m a soldier. I’m Captain America, it’s not right.”
“So things are in paradise, huh?” Clint asked, reaching out and stealing four slices of bacon. The next second, or at least it seemed, the swift man was on the other side of the room, nibbling with a smile.
The man even gave him paper files when the Avengers met up to go over a new mission. Though, this did come with a lecture on saving the environment that Steve grew fond of, watching Tony roll his eyes and scoff in Steve’s direction.
From there, when he woke up and drank a smoothie, followed by a run and a big scrambled eggs affair where Clint kept smirking at him for some reason, Steve set out to understand exactly what was going on. He said goodbye to Clint, who yelled, “Talk to you later!”
Eventually, after a couple hours, he went to Tony’s workshop. It was Tony’s safe space, his happy place. A place where Steve wanted to try what they told him to do, because at least there Tony would start with that happy look on his face and no one would walk in.
It hit Steve hard, hard enough he nearly dropped the spatula holding up the grilled cheese. Quickly he placed it on a plate and gently pushed it within Tony’s sight, telling himself that he did not just realize he was madly in love with Tony Stark.
“Good,” Steve said, feeling nervous as he leaned down and kissed Tony again. And it wasn’t like Tony was actually small, he was a normal size kind of guy, but the super serum had amplified Steve up enough that Tony seemed ridiculously fragile in his arms.
“Yes?” Steve asked when Tony didn’t continue.
“Oh, sweetie, you broke him,” Mitchel said in hushed voice.
Maybe he could use both left and right hands during baseball?
Steve, somehow, ends up in the wrong part of town. At least he assumed, because he doesn’t remember any part of New York being this colorful. Shrugging, Steve wandered over to what looked like a nice café and ordered himself a drink. Realizing, finally, that he actually didn’t finish his lunch he also gets something to eat and prepares himself for a good time simply people watching.
“We’re friends and live in the same home,” Steve offered, knowing he had a baffled look on his face, the one Natasha consistently smirked at even though she knew it hurt his feelings.
A little ashamed of himself twenty minutes and a cleaning spree later, Steve slowly sat back down in his chair and scooted back up to the desk. Nervously, he eyed the black screen, before reaching out and touching the little sensor to wake it up again. It lit up and there, just as before, was the website. Steve swallowed, looked over his shoulder, and glanced nervously at the moving image proudly being displayed before him.
“Yes I can,” Tony grumbled, rubbing at his eye and giving a large yawn, looking like a total man-child. He looked back up at him and smirked. “You’re not the only one who can be bossy, Mister Rogers.”
His reaction was probably a little dramatic. He shoved himself away from the desk, hand over his mouth and going pale like he had seen a ghost. He had the urge to throw the computer out the window, the fact that Tony had given it to him being the only thing stopping him. Having no other choice, he threw up in his trash bin.
“So, you can take a break?” Steve replied, not bothered by the hopeful tone to his voice.
Tony dug his wallet out and handed Mitchel a credit card. “Go box up some more of that pie. And no eavesdropping.”
“I didn’t know that’s where I was,” Steve mumbled.
So, yes, Tony was Steve’s friend. Nothing more. Besides, men weren’t supposed to be together like that. He pointed that out to Bruce the next day, only to wonder about the sad look he got in return.
“Please, baby, please,” Steve didn’t even realize he was begging until the words left. He wanted to orgasm himself, but he had to see. God, he needed to see Tony do it first.
Tony lifted up, reached up to tug him down into a kiss. It was soft and gentle like they usually were. Now that he understood the difference, he could feel Tony’s body tremble, tense as he pressed his hands on Tony’s side. Tony moaned as he deepened the kiss, Steve letting out a soft sound himself when their tongues touched.
“You mean anything that will blow up?” Tony asked, before shaking his head. “Sadly, no. Next step is micro-wiring. The most you’d get is a shock.”
“Clearly,” he replied, laughing. The man fell silent, staring at him. “Well, shit, you are Captain America.”
“It just...made me think, and I feel...things around you,” Steve said, looking skyward like that would help the conversation go a little faster.
“Oh,” Steve said. And he did say it, there was no squeak involved at all. Honestly.
Tony gave him a fond smile. “Sure thing, buddy.”
Steve glared at the computer and considered shutting it off entirely, before he slumped in his chair.
“Really, hot little thing like you?” Tony asked, running a hand down Steve’s chest and, okay, that felt amazing.
The reward was, apparently, the most intense kiss he’d ever had or ever thought he’d get. The moment the credits rolled onto the screen he had Tony’s mouth on him, pressing just hard enough. As like with everything Tony did in life, Steve had a hard time following until he just gave in and went with it. He was so used to trying to be in control of everything, mostly in battle or thinking about battle. But when Tony straddled his lap, Steve just moaned and let his mouth open with Tony’s encouragement.
Steve swallowed hard, looking down at his lap and groaning in frustration. He really was like a teenager again, wasn’t he?
Not on the table, no, Steve had him where he was still holding all his weight up. The table was only there to keep Tony steady, leaving him right on the edge. Steve had never been so turned on in his life. Looking at Tony’s caramel eyes where the pupil was slowly getting bigger and bigger, trying to take in everything. Steve gave into the urge to thrust his hips, feeling a rush of pride when Tony made a whimper sound and wrapped his strong legs around Steve’s waist. And they were strong, trying to pull Steve closer.
Tony entered, practically beaming over at Steve. Clint smirked and edged his way to the door. “Oh, nothing Cap. I’ll talk to you later!”
Often, Steve would come home from a SHIELD mission, tired and sore but feeling like he had done some good in the world, only to find Tony had fallen asleep trying to get to bed. It was the oddest habit he had ever witnessed, the man would start heading for his floor from his workshop, only to end up in the strangest places, asleep and dead to the world. He had even once found him draped across the kitchen table, using a loaf of bread as a pillow.
“No, I...never done this,” Steve repeated, wondering if with the super serum he could suddenly have a heart attack.
“Well, then, looks like we’ve got some dating to do,” Tony replied, looking a lot more awake than earlier. He was bouncing in his seat like an excited kid and Steve had to fight the urge to tell him how adorable he was.
Tony had designed Steve’s space to help him adapt. It had all the classic features of the forties, all the way down to a record player that Tony had said he found in his father’s storage. On top of that was a computer that was designed by Tony to teach Steve how to use it, instead of being expected to know how to maneuver through everything.
“Kiss me,” Steve whispered.
Steve looked down at his hands and swallowed. “I, uh…”
“No, no, to get off,” Tony said, fast enough for the words to blend together. “Wanna, God, wanna get you to come.”
Steve was distracted by his thoughts as Tony entered the room, hair standing on end and hands twitching, which meant he was in desperate need of coffee. Though, Steve would rather get him some tea and a bed, but the last time he tried to pull that move Tony had refused to speak to him for a week. And that was before they started dating, he didn’t think he could survive that now.
“Uh, Tony’s not-”
“I’m not,” Steve repeated, inwardly cringing because he sounded like he was actually pouting over this.
He could feel Tony trembling, trying to rock up into his own thrust despite Steve holding onto him. The words coming out of Tony’s mouth, nonsensical and too fast for Steve to understand, were all in a rolling sort of growl. Steve had never been this turned on. He could feel himself building to that moment, but he wanted to actually see Tony first. He was holding himself on a painful edge as he pulled back and kissed Tony gently on the lips.
“You don’t love me,” Tony replied.
black-sabbathrules: I’m starting to think you’re older than your forties, dude. Maybe 70?
“Why didn’t you do it first? Probably would have saved me a lot of time figuring things out,” Steve countered.
His whole body jerked when Tony’s tongue dived into his mouth, which caused Tony to pull back, face blushed and eyes just so brown. “Is this okay?”
“Yes, why?” Steve asked.
“Yeah,” Steve breathed out, his brain still trying to turn back on.
He felt a kiss along his jawline, a nervous thrill rushing through him as Tony kissed up to his ear and said, “I promise to make it up to you.”
“Bruce thought we were a couple,” Steve said.
“Why does he always say goodbye to you like that?” Tony asked, before getting distracted by the egg sandwich Steve handed over. “You are my favorite.”
“Gonna,” Tony said, his face scrunching up, just too many emotions to actually process.
“Still good?” Steve asked, because he needed to be sure.
He wasn’t going to fight the urge to rub it in switch-hitter32’s face that he had a boyfriend now, though.
“Yeah,” Steve breathed out, hesitating. “I’ve never done this.”
Captain-40s: I’m not that old. Just...traditional. And...never mind, I would prefer to not get teased for something like this.
“Okay, okay, yes, that’s good,” Steve rambled, maybe mumbled.
And sadly, now he couldn't even look at Tony without blushing. Tony pretended to not notice, that much was obvious, but Steve could tell it was bothering him. The more things bothered Tony? The more the man hid in his workshop, talking to his robots.
He had wanted to try out what the forum guys had suggested the next morning, but Tony had swept in while on the phone, power suit on, shoulders back in full business battle mode. Steve was willing to admit he was intimidated enough to accept a kiss on the cheek and smile for handing Tony a muffin. Which was fine, it was probably a better evening activity anyway, but that meant Steve had time to ponder about it. Worry about if Tony would even like him initiating things and actually taking some control.
“So, uh, Cap,” Tony started, after asking Steve to help him wash dishes after dinner. Steve had agreed because Tony had been spending so much time in his workshop recently that Steve had started to miss him, that and Tony agreeing to do anything domestic was something Steve had to see for himself.
black-sabbathrules: Yeah, cap, I’m thinking you are even more timid than our little switcher is suggesting. Please tell me you’ve kissed the guy.
“What?” Steve asked, frowning.
Steve nodded, not really sure what most of that meant, before kissing Tony so that they could get back to that. He understood the slow drag of lips and once he got used to Tony’s tongue and met it with his own he realized just how amazing all of this was. He found himself wrapping his arms around Tony’s waist and moaning as that brought Tony’s body closer to him. Tony made a soft whimpering sound, hips rocking forward before Tony seemed to force them to stop.
Sadly, whatever email that was sent must have freaked Tony out, because he apparently thought Steve was actually being held hostage. Steve never realized how nice of a sight it was to see Iron Man swooping in to rescue you. The warm feeling in his chest only grew when Iron Man’s face plate lifted back and the man behind it began glaring at anyone nearby, demanding in a loud voice for someone named Mitchel.
“Oh, I see,” Bruce said, sounding a little sad.
“Shit,” Tony said, pulling away from the kiss. The man’s back arched, before thrusting up into Steve’s hips. “I-I really hope you plan to continue this, cause, shit, Steve.”
A week after Tony started giving him those fond little smiles and leaving him the books, Steve decided he needed to get out of the Tower because he couldn’t breathe with Tony looking at him like that. He ignored Bruce’s raised eyebrow, grabbed his hoodie and baseball cap, and rushed out the door. He didn’t even care that he was walking away from a half-finished lunch.
Hearing that he ran off to find Bucky and tell him the good news.
Peter was by himself, searching for the capsule again. He had taken a detour into the forest instead of going straight home. Looking around, turning over boxes and digging through broken shelves. And finally founds the box which was a small brown treasure chest.
“Does Peter believe?” He paused. “Do you believe? Do you think it will really happen?”
“Will you at least forgive me for this, god?” He pleaded softly in the quiet of his lonely, dark room.
Tony watches Steve ran, excitement clearly shown on his face and wonders if he should just shove away his new found feelings.
“Oh no, and I didn’t know anything about this? Where was I? What the hell was I doing?”
“Stark!!”
Wait, that was none of his business. Steve could bring a girl or two to the tower if he wanted. Tony’s got no problem with that. But, geez! Maybe he should come back another time.
“It seems that the rainy season will be longer this time.” The weather forecast said through the radio. Steve found himself letting out a relief triumph on hearing it.
As soon as they realized that it was just an act the rest of the team laughed as well. Clint came up to Tony, strangling him playfully.
“Tony. . .”
Tony’s eyes widened in surprise. He looked up and saw Fury, who was giving him a deadpanned expression. And standing a few foot behind him were the US officials.
On the fourth day Steve finally came back and he wasn’t alone. He and Natasha had brought back the Winter Soldier with them.
gonna try and take down a professional assassin.
“You’re a sick bastard, Ty.” Tony commented, glaring at him as he unconsciously rubbed his hand which was starting to bleed again.
“I wanted to, I really did!”, the brunet admitted, looking exasperated. “But you were deep in your sleep, you just won’t open your eyes even when I blew at them or pinched your nose. I didn’t know what else to do to wake you up which would not be rude. And. . . since I’m in your care I wanted to at least help out with the cooking. That effort has gone out the window. Argh, I don’t care anymore.”
“Did you meet someone?”
After they locked up the house they head off to town. Once they reached the place they were spotted by Wade who gave them a cheeky grin and ran up to them.
He figured he must have done something right in his life to get a family as awesome as them.
Tony was surprised at first. His body gearing up for escape. But the guy seemed like he was just worried about him and simply wanted to be close. He doesn’t seem like an alpha that would mindlessly attack an omega. So he let his guard down again.
Happy thought for a while and ran back to the car. Just then Steve looked back, noticing that a certain brunet wasn’t behind him. “Tony? What are you doing standing there for?” He furrowed his brows at him.
They shook hands. One smiled as the other simply stares.
“Who is it? Wait just a sec”, came the blonds’ voice. The door soon swung open and out came a tousled looking super soldier. His eyes widened in surprise on finding out that it was Tony.
“No, that’s not true at all. Daddy didn’t die because of you and, I’m not going anywhere. I’ll always be with you. All right?” He guaranteed, giving a shaky smile.
There was going to be a parade in the town. During these times it was always Tony who took Peter out for this kind of occasions. And Steve, knowing perfectly well that his son wanted to go suggested after lunch that they should go too.
“My brother’s incompetence. I was always the first one to notice it.” He said as he leaned forward. His fingers intertwined in front of him as he brought them up to his lips. Eyes cast down as his lips curved up into a small, genuine smile.
She may have not been a very good mom but she was the only one he got and it made the truth about her death even sadder. To die in the hands of a cold blooded killer.
“Steve.” He gasped out. “Steve. . .”
“Archer, are you alright?” Thor asked looking down from his cereal bowl as Natasha simply says ‘that’s gonna leave a mark’ as she continued polishing her guns. Bruce smiled nervously.
“That will be taken care of. I have people who can help with that.”
Soon enough, touching himself through his underwear wasn’t enough anymore. He slipped his hand inside, directly massaging his now dripping, hard cock.
Steve hates to see him like that. “God, Tony. Please don’t do that. It wasn’t your fault, Tony. How you reacted was totally normal. I’d be more worried if you weren’t.” Steve says as he brought him into a hug.
He stood there for another five minutes or so trying to calm his nerves. Gathering enough courage to finally knock on the damn door. He heard a scuttling sound from inside as if Steve was currently busy with something or someone. Tony felt weird and somewhat angry at the thought that Steve would have someone in his room right now.
“Daddy!” Peter called out as he ran up to the brunet, a huge smile on his face, getting the guy’s attention.
“Yo, Pete. Thought you won’t show up. There’s a really neat shooting game over there. Let’s go.” He took the smaller boy’s hand in his and dragged him into the crowd even before the boy could give a reply.
Tony flopped back down onto his bed.
Soon realizing his action Steve’s eyes widened in shock, his cheeks going red. “Oh god! Clint, I’m so sorry.” He grimaced as he ran to him.
“Good job out there, Steve.” She said. “Here’s a towel. I just bought it a few days ago. Just for you.” She purred, grabbing at his biceps in a teasing manner.
He then propped himself up on his elbow, trying to get out of bed. He stopped in his tracts when he saw the blond alpha sleeping at the end of his bed. Sitting on the floor with his back against the bed. He was breathing slowly, his head titling to the side.
Tony went back into the house and went into his room; his and Steve’s room to be exact and saw a velvet red box near their family photo on the bed’s side table. Curious, he opened the box and inside was a beautiful silver wedding ring with his name written in neat cursive on the inside. Without really thinking he put on the ring in his finger and it fitted him perfectly. He stares at it for a while still not believing that he was already married and with a child to boot.
“You too, Tony.” A dazed smile adorned his face.
“Wow, Tony. Thank you so much. I don’t really know what else to say. You are truly amazing.”
Steve had smelled like soap. Had he just got out from the bath? The smell was lingering in his room.
To that retort Steve grabbed Tony’s face, digging a finger onto the injured part on the side of his lips, blood oozing again. That earned a painful moan from the older male who was trying to squirm away. Pulling at his hand.  A silent struggle to get free.
“Coffee?”
“What? I’m not. . . I just felt like looking out at the view. The wind feels great. It’s so refreshing. You should probably scoot over on your side, way over there and feel it too. You’ll love it.” Tony replies, laughing oddly. Pointedly looking out the window with one hand on his chin.
Tony found himself tracing the skin that Steve had touched. His shoulders…his arms…his neck…his lips.
But there is no mistaking, that dad and I were able to meet my omega father again.
“Not literally, Cap. I’m not red anymore, right?”
He looked around the photos hung around the wall. It was him posing in all of them. The wedding photo, the family photo, another where they were celebrating Peter’s birthday. Everything looks legit.
He sat up straight on the chair and stretched his arms. God, that felt nice. He looked over at DUM-E and told him to make some coffee for him. The bot soon returned with a cup, looking quite excited because it had been a while since he was asked by his master to make him something. But when Tony looked inside the cup contained something which looked like coffee but smelled nothing like one. The engineer sighs.
“Thank you for that, Wade. But choose your words a little kinder next time.” Wanda told him and the class commence.
He got out of bed, taking the utmost care not to make any sudden movements or noise. He crept up in front of the blond alpha, staring at his form.
“No, I’m not. Not in the least. I wish I could do so many things for him. Like normal parents can.” He said. He sat down on the empty chair, feeling worn put.
It was getting late so Tony and Steve put Peter to bed and watched their son sleep. Looking safe and comfortable.
“Can I kiss you?”
“How could I not? You’re my best friend. Apology gladly accepted.”
The brunet had his sight away from him. One hand supporting his chin. His clothes were covered in dirt and specks of blood, torn at the sides. His whole body was covered in bruises and cuts. His face was especially fucked up.
After another fifteen minutes ride they finally reached the tower’s parking lot. Steve came out first followed by Tony on the other side and made their way to the elevator.
The two of them nodded furiously.
Steve couldn’t believe his eyes. Before him was the beautiful omega he had fallen since a long time ago, the one he was lucky enough to have as a mate. Was Tony actually in front of him right now? Did he really come back to them as he promised last time?
“Heh. . .any special reason?”
“Why do you say that?” Bruce asked gently, offering a comforting smile.
“Hmm?
Tony reached out for Steve’s arm. Linking it together with his own and snuggling into his shoulder.
“Because no one else knows about the promise and they will think that Tony is a ghost. They might get scared of him or hurt him. We can’t let that happen.”
“Yeah, i guess you can say that.” Bruce answered.
“Pardon?” Bruce thinks he might have misheard him. “You’re saying you believe it?”
Everyone laughed at their friends' antics.
It actually helped him in a way.
In the blink of an eye Tony sent his fist flying at the guy’s face, leaving a red mark in Ty’s left cheek. He staggered away from the brunet, caressing his injured face.
Tony didn’t remember them at all or anything about himself. They took him back home with them with Tony giving them a cautious look, being alert of their every action.
“Then, shall we go on a walk?” He held out his hand for Tony to take. Tony obliged and took it, getting up from the bed.
“Papa, do you think daddy died because of me?”
Tony came out of the room, dressed in his navy rock band t-shirt, a grey jumper and black cotton jeans. He went around the house, checking it out. He found it to be a cozy house, neither too big nor too small. Things were kept clean and simple.
He looked over to Steve who had come with him for the case. Tony noted that he looked just as anxious if not more. He looked dead tired too. He had just found his supposedly long dead best friend just a day ago and now he could be taken away again. He also knew how tired Steve was. He hadn’t gotten a wink of a goodnight sleep because as soon as SHIELD had heard of the Winter Soldier’s capture they had wanted to bring him in and answer for his crimes.
“The sides of your mouth are cut and bleeding a bit but the rest is all right.” He pulled out supplies from the first aid kit and began treating his injuries. “It’s gonna sting a little but please bear with it.” He said as he applied the antiseptics.
“Nahhh.” He paused. “Maybe a little.” He admitted looking away.
“Tony.” Steve said, staring right at him. His voice deep and commanding. But gentle at the same time.
They had almost believed him, giving him concern and worried looks, if it weren’t for the suppressed laughter from Steve that ruined it all.
“What is it?”
“I’m so lucky to have you by my side.” Steve whispers in that low husky voice of his.
Just as dad was setting the table the doorbell rang. I told him I’d get it and ran to the door. When I opened it I saw that it was Mrs. Madeline, the owner of a cake shop in town. She smiled at me and said, “Happy 16th birthday, Peter”, and handed me the cake box.
“Things aren't as simple as that, Stark. Did you  not tell us that he was brainwashed by Hydra? You don’t know what he would be capable of until it can be confirmed that he had fully escaped their mind control.”
“I want to feel what it felt like to like each other once more.”  He confessed, his voice soft. Steve gave him a reassuring squeeze.
Steve laughed. His smile looks wry but genuine all the same. “I’m positive that you’re the only who can cheer me up even at my worst.” Steve says as his hands came up to cup the brunet’s face and leaning closer to him.
“Is that so? How is it then? Any symptoms?” The doctor asked. He was smiling like he expected a positive answer.
Bucky’s face contorted into something malicious of sort but it quickly faded before the blond could notice it. “Not at all. I’m just glad you found friends other than me.”
Tony gently brushed away the bangs of Peter’s hair away from his eyes with a smile. He then noticed a small key that hung around his neck tied to a thick black string. He reached out and took the key in his hand, feeling it for a while but then put it down, pulling the blankets higher to cover the child’s neck.
“Not cool, man. Not cool. That fucking hurts!” Clint hissed as he was helped up. The super soldier apologized again. He suggested taking him to the infirmary but the archer shook him off saying he was fine, it wasn’t needed and made his way to his room to get patched up. Bruce got up too, following him and signaling his teammates that he’ll take care of it.
They were making their way back to the house. The distance between them seemed to have lessened after their short 'date'.
He may realise he loves Steve but his feelings didn't need to get in the way, making it all weird between them.
“Hmm, you also seemed like you don’t like anyone whether they were girls or boys, alpha or beta. You don’t seem to have any interest in love other than your love for inventions. But I like that part of you too. I was just happy getting to have a seat next to you. Other than a simple greeting like ‘hi’ or ‘hey’ we didn’t talk much and we stayed like that until we eventually graduated. Through a recommendation I was accepted into a college close to home and you…went to MIT.”
Peter sent him a smile as a way of showing him they were harmless and held out his hand for Tony which the brunet took after a quite contemplation.
Tony didn’t give a reply. Knowing full well Ty was right about him. He couldn’t retort to that.
With that they went out the room. Tony couldn’t stop feeling flustered on the fact that he had spent last night sleeping on the same bed as Steve. But Steve doesn’t look like that bothered him at all. Yeah, he was over reacting. It’s normal for best friends to sleep on the same bed. Totally normal.
“Yes, it did.” He replied enthusiastically.
And Tony, he couldn’t deny that it didn’t made him happy to be called Steve Rogers aka Captain America’s best friend in the 21st century.
His whole body was throbbing in pain like it had been tortured for a long time. But this pain was something more. The kind that could not be seen. That kind that could not be treated easily.
“Did I scare you?” She asked, tilting her head to the side.
“So, what’s this ridiculous idea of you Avengers holding the Winter Soldier instead of giving him over to us? You know the bastard had been a pain in the ass for centuries. He needs to be taken in.” Fury says looking dead serious. All the other people in the room nodded their head in agreement except for Tony and Steve.
“You work hard by doing vigorous training and I work hard doing these stuffs.....I was starting to think I won’t get to see you tonight.”
He buried his face in his pillow, sobbing.
“Yeah. Also, I guess no one can tell but my brother is a really kind person. When we were little, he always put me before himself. Always listening to what I had to say. Protecting me, fighting for me, always helping me out. He pretends to have no interest and shuts himself away so as not to cause me trouble.” He told her. Reminiscing about the good old past as he did. His gaze towards the open field.
He didn’t want to believe that Bucky was always like this.
It was raining so they brought their umbrellas and Peter wore his raincoat and boots.
“Yes. I’m delighted.” He sincerely replied.
He imagined Steve’s voice. The way he would usually scold him with a gentle tone that always seem to rile him up. That deep, husky voice speaking lewd things into his ears.
“What? You got a problem with me?” Was the last thing he said before he charged himself at the guy.
“Tony! Come meet Bucky.” Steve called out to him, waving with a huge smile as soon as he saw him. The guy looked beat up and his exhaustion showed but that smile of his makes up for all that. Tony nodded returning the smile, walking up to them.
They wore their jackets and went to the forest. It was a beautiful full moon night so there was no need for a flashlight. They walked with ease into the forest, side by side. The rays of the moon lighting their path.
At Bruce’s clinic~
“I heard from one of the teachers that you got into a fight again.” Steve said looking down at his brother who was now glaring at him, already propped up on the bed with his elbows.
Tony shut his eyes tight. Unable to face the super soldier.
At home they told him how he was related to them. Steve showed him their family photo as a sort of evidence.
"Very mature, Barton." She jabbed him at his side earning a painful groan. "At least you got the mentality of a 12 year old."
“Oh, I don’t know. Maybe the part where you hit Clint with a pan?”
“Don’t come to this room anymore.” He managed to choke out, voice hoarse. “Don’t come near me anymore. . . Please, I beg of you.”
Bruce Banner, the beta doctor, is one of the most eminent doctors that were transferred to this little town. Ever since Steve moved here he had been his regular patient, helping the blond with his rehabilitation and other issues. He had been a good friend to both the alpha and his mate before the latter passed away.
Starting from getting each other’s back, from serious quarrels to playful banters, spending their off time together doing whatever came to mind (Tony’s mostly, which included getting Steve to watch all the fan favorite movies ever made. They would have their separate movie nights for that) to sharing their own inside jokes the two of them were now undeniably the best of friends.
And after that long while of brooding a gentle smile finally adorned his face.
“I will never tell you.” Tony finally said.
“Sorry. Peter. I didn’t mean to yell like that.”
"That's right."
“Well done, Tony~! You’re brutal as ever, aren’t you?”
“You can trust me.” He whispered. His voice warm and husky.
He watches Bucky pulled out a knife from the drawer. Waving it around and playing with it. Walking closer to the him with every step he took, a cynical smile on his face.
“What else do you expect from a genius such as myself?”
If you had told Tony Stark that he would become best friends with Steve Rogers he would fully deny anything like that could ever happen, like in a million years. He’d laugh it off and might even add that you’re insane to say something as unbelievable as that. Or even to get your head checked for getting that crazy idea in the first place. But fate and chance sure changed that for him.
The ride back to the tower was kind of awkward. Awkward for Tony that is. Now that he had realized how he truly felt about Steve being alone with him made him unnecessarily flustered and fidgety.
“Oh my gosh, really? You two don’t look alike at all!” She gasped in surprise. “You’re brother seems really scary. I often see him getting into fight around the campus.”
“So, my name is Tony. Your omega and Peter’s other dad. . .” They were all seated on the common room couch.
“It’s. . .nothing in particular.” He told her, proceeding to do his job with a spirit he hadn’t had since forever.
“What? Missed me already?” Steve teased.
Tony cries as blood starts to flow out and drips onto the floor.
To that Steve shook his head and smiled as well.
“I see.”
“Gonna tell that again to your little brother? You know you’ve caused him enough trouble already.” The guy commented with a sly smirk.
“He’s so brazen even though he’s younger than me.” Tony thought.
“But you know, I couldn’t just forget you like that. I wanted to see you one more time. So, I dialed your number I got from a friend and asked you if you could return the handkerchief I lent you at graduation. Saying that it was an important memento from my mother. But that wasn’t true. It was important but I had a few more of those. I didn’t really need to get it back but I didn’t know what other excuse I could use to meet you. And above all else, I was so glad you still even remembered me.”
At times like this he really wished Tony was with him. He’d know what to do to help Peter.
The omega raised his head, complete confusion clearly showed on his face.
Tony couldn’t do anything but stare at the two of them. What kind of people would eat burnt food just because it was made by their loved ones? And why do they look so happy while eating it?
Overall, though, it was a cozy little set up Tony had created for them. It made Steve feel relaxed for the first time since the United States had declared war on the Nazis, which was a long time to be overly wound up. Steve wasn’t entirely sure what to do with this newfound peace in himself, the urge to look around every corner in his own home slowly fading.
“Hmm?” Tony blinked down at the sandwich, before picking it up and taking a bite, swallowing it down with the coffee. “Oh God, that’s good, what is that?”
“Fine, we go to bed,” Steve said, placing his hands on Tony’s hips to help him stand up. Tony rested his hands on top of Steve’s, that fond smile back again.
He made the mistake of mentioning the conversation to Clint, who told him he had the perfect show for Steve to watch to give him an idea of what Bruce was hinting at. Steve, horrified, shut off Queer As Folk five minutes in and promised himself to never accept cultural help from Clint Barton ever again. He knew Natasha would help him, but he didn’t want to deal with her smirking and teasing the entire time. Thor was still going through whatever trials Loki was being subjected to and odds were the Asgardian wouldn’t know Earth culture anyway.
Knowing his face was redder than a tomato, Steve quickly shut off the website, switching back to the search engine he had been on. He skimmed past what was clearly more porn sites, before a site claiming to be a forum caught his eye. The description looked promising and Steve could definitely agree that he was confused and could use a little advice.
“This is the story for the ages,” the man whispered. “Okay, cutie, I will help reunite you with your one true love. Let me go get you a slice of pie, because you still look hungry, and I’m going to go have the love of my life get on his computer and get your man here.”
Steve and Peter went to the forest to look for usable junks from the old abandoned mansion in the forest. It was something Tony did a lot as well before. Looking for junks he could recycle to build something amazing. Peter had also followed the trend. Whenever he had a school project he needed to do he went scouring for stuffs there.
“This is problematic. You’re not the type of person to lie and I was the doctor who pronounced him dead.”
A miracle of six weeks.
Tiberius burst into a hysterical laugh at that.
Tony thought. His body becoming like that of a shell. Losing its cheer. Losing its light.
“I have a question.” He started after a while.
But a pain that cannot be spoken of lies deeper still.
“Thank you for doing this, Tony.” Steve told him with a genuine, heartfelt smile. A smile that conveyed so much love and affection that it earned a blush from the omega.
“You just sighed and smiled a moment ago.” Peggy commented with a smirk.
Tony scoffed. “You again, Ty? You’re a sad excuse for a friend.”
He turned to Steve, gazing up at his alpha. Closed his eyes and waits to be kissed. Steve went red at the gesture but slowly leaned into Tony’s space, and kissed him and the world faded away.The kiss was warm and soft. Steve's hand rested on Tony's ear, his thumb caressing his cheek as their breath mingles.
In the next few seconds he felt his body swaying slowly to the ground with a thud, his vision blurred of the passersby. Images of some people running to help him. That was the only thing he remembered before waking up to his son’s tear stricken face.
“More like they had a make-up sex to me.”, Clint commented with a cheeky smile. Tony choked on his saliva.
Tony’s cheeks were warm and he turned slightly on the bed at the cold touch of Steve’s hand. The alpha’s heart pounded loudly in his chest, scared that he might have woken him. But then Tony simply turned to the side, unconsciously pulling up the blankets to cover half of his face as he slept on.
Steve changed the calendar to July and noticed that there was only around two weeks left before the rainy season ended. It made his heart clenched tightly in his chest.
Wade raised an eyebrow at him. “Don’t people usually hate the rainy season? Ya know, cause you get all soggy and drenched, and you have to sit in class with a wet underwear if you don’t have a change of clothes. And I really hate the smell of stinky wet socks in class. Totally ruins the mood.” He complained.
Steve could recall the day of their graduation when Tony came over to let him sign his t-shirt. He had been going around to his classmates to get them to sign something in his shirt as a sort of remembrance.
He sat down on one of the nearby benches and she followed him, settling down by his side. Showing a smile which was all teeth. He wished she would just leave him alone.
“Hey~ It’s the little bro of my very good friend, Tony. Good job at practice today man.” He said, giving a wave. “You were ‘cool’ as ever.”
“Morning.” I said pulling out a chair and sat down.
“Yeah.”
Tony shook his head in reply.
“Good morning everyone.” Steve said as he walked into the room with a radiant smile. They greeted back a bit confused but happy for the guy at the same time.
Tony flinched. “Nothing. Happy is getting some ice for me. You go on ahead if you want.”
Steve came barging into his room. This time he didn’t even asked him for permission. He stared at Tony’s beaten form sitting on the bed.
“Tony?”
The omega’s blush deepened at the sweet gesture.
“You’re a weird one, Pete.” Wade said, doing the same.
“Why won’t you tell me?! I want to understand you, Tony! I really do.” Steve suddenly yelled, breaking down in front of him. His grip loosened, falling by the side. Tears falling down on the brunet’s bed, staining the sheets wet.
He entered the dark room, feeling around the wall for the switch. As soon as the light came on he found it to be filled with junks. There were some old baby cradle, a baby walker, toys, and outfits. There was also a beautiful silver Audi R8 in the middle of the garage which really stood out from the rest.
The others couldn’t do much either when they heard about the incident. They knew how Tony would feel about all this, that he was heartbroken and in pain to hear about the news of his parents. That it will be quite a while before the brunet would feel better, things like this takes time to heal. The team didn’t hold it against Steve for the whole mess because they knew what he had done was the right thing to do. They believed that Tony will eventually come around to it. But for now, all they could do was watch their teammates try and settle it between themselves. They eventually would, they were best friends after all.
What had they done wrong for him to act like this?
"That's because Steve actually take cares of what he eats unlike you who eats take out 24/7." Natasha chided. " It's amazing you haven't bloated up." Clint stuck out his tongue at her.
Happy came back with ice cubes which he took from the champagne bucket wrapped up in a cloth and handed it to Tony who hurriedly took it and ran into the elevator.
“Yay for us.” Stop hugging me dammit.
Steve remembered how upset his mom had been. To be the reason her son had to give up college. It had taken a long while for his mom to accept his decision.
His whole body was burning up. Was he getting sick or what?
“Don’t I matter to you at all?!”
That woke up the soldier in an instant. Steve couldn’t help but laugh at his best friend who was sprawled on the floor, looking as shocked as can be.
That earned him a chuckle from the super soldier which the brunet returned. And with one last look Steve went inside the Avenjet and took off. Tony watched for a while until there was only a speck of black dot in the sky and went for his meeting. The rest of his day went unbelievably boring. He wished Steve was back already.
He then heard a sigh and saw that the guy looked pretty down.
"But Tony-"
Steve narrowed his eyes at him. He wasn’t sure what to do with that kind of reaction.
As Peter looked around for materials, Steve looked up at the rain and closed his eyes, wishing for something that was unlikely to happen. But he still wished for it anyway.
“I feel bad for Peter.” Steve said out of nowhere as they entered Bruce’s office. He looked pretty depressed.
A chuckle escape from Steve’s as he gave one last look at the brunet before he went into his kitchen to prepare said snacks.
He and the rest of the team knew how Barnes was brainwashed into doing those crimes and atrocities and they believe Steve when he told them how his friend was trying to fight back Hydra’s control over him and started gaining back his memories. Even if they didn’t trust the guy either just handing him to the government seems like a cruel thing to do. Who knows what they would do to the guy.
10 years ago~
Tony squirmed on the bed. His body almost reaching its climax as he sped up the pace. He rubbed his feet together and clench his toes to the silky sheets of his bed.
“No! We did not!" Tony exclaimed, horrified and embarrassed. "What the fuck, Clint? How the hell did you deduce that?” He says raising his eyebrow in a mocking manner.
It was another rainy day and Steve was busy getting the pieces of the new bed design together.
Tony groaned. “I can’t face Steve like this.”
Tiberius was walking along the now quiet hallways of their school, looking carefree as he whistled. His eyes closed. He came to a halt when someone stood in front of him, blocking the way.
Happy, Tony’s friend and driver, watched the exchange through the rear view mirror of the car. He could feel the awkward atmosphere seeping from behind.
Steve called after Peter, saying he’ll catch up with them. Peter gave a wave, smiling, and soon disappeared among the mass. Steve followed them at a steady pace at first. But as he walked further into the crowd his body started to heat up, his head getting dizzy and a nauseous feeling in his stomach. He staggered into the crowd and soon felt himself becoming short of breath, sweat dripping down his face. The crowded atmosphere sucking the air out of him.
“Yes. Coffee.”
“Yep, daddy is no good at cooking and burns the food a lot but it still tastes delicious.” Peter added cheerfully.
“Uh huh. I don’t care what really happened and I don’t want to know either. Let’s just get the meeting started.” With that he walked towards the conference door, punched in a number and entered the room followed by the officials and Tony and Steve in the last.
“What the hell did I do before I lost my memory? I’m pretty sure I don’t just lie around the house all day long, doing absolutely nothing. I must be doing something useful.” He said to himself, looking up at the ceiling.
That night Tony cried himself to sleep.
“I can’t?” He asked again when Tony continued to stare at him in complete surprise, not giving an answer. Tony shook his head quickly. Putting one hand over his heart he took a deep breath then exhaled slowly.
“A very good morning to you, Steve my boy. We just got a new request for two table sets urgently. I want you to get started on one right away if you can. Tell one of the workers to work on the other set.” Mr. Smith said as he went around his workshop, supervising the works. He was the owner of the shop called 'Mr. Smith & sons' and was the one who gave Steve his much needed job years ago. Teaching him the ropes.
So they wanted to help him in their own way instead. The best hand was in their own. And they got way better equipments to help him anyway.
Ty chuckled. “Yeah, that’s right. You’re so close to him and yet you don’t know?”
He curled his legs to his chest, burrowing his head on his knee as he sobbed, broken hearted.
“After that I trained like crazy and sprinting was all I could think about. There wasn’t a reason for you to like someone like that.”
Tony kept quiet. His legs came up to his chest, arms draping around his aching form.
I got up from bed at the sound of my 6 A.M alarm clock, yawning as I stretched up on the bed. It was another warm morning in Marvel, a quite little town located in the country side of New York with only around a thousand houses.
Steve agreed that it was a good idea to give it a try so everyday they would strap the metal armed soldier onto the machine and he and Bruce would check his progress.
Tony tries to call for his armor but got his face slammed roughly onto the table. “I know that movement. You were trying to call your armor, weren’t you? You shouldn’t do that. Not if you want you pretty little face all messed up.” Bucky says snickering creepily.
“No, it’s not. You, stop that. Seriously, not funny, you might get a stomach ache or something.”
He looks inside the fridge and winced a bit with the bright lights coming from it. He looked around and found lots of food but they were all in need of a being cooked before one could eat them and Tony didn’t feel like doing it. Besides, cooking wasn’t one of his fortes. If it was gonna be like this he wonders if he should just sleep it off.
Bucky remained silent.
“What?. . .No, Peter.” Steve quickly assured his son.
The next morning Tony rushed out to the helipad hoping to catch Steve before he went out to retrieve the Winter Soldier. He was late for his meeting but what the hell. Wishing Steve good luck for his mission was more important to him. He’d need it. He
“Leave it.” Tony told him. “It will heal on its own just fine.”
“Is that so? That’s really too bad but I’m happy for you. Your cakes deserve to be eaten by everyone.”
“What?” He managed to say after a while. “You think I’m Tony’s lover? Oh my god, you crack me up.”  He held his stomach, keeling over from laughing so much. His other hand coming up to playfully slap the blonde’s shoulder.  “Good one, little bro.”
Bucky answered by dropping the knife he was holding straight onto the top of Tony’s left hand, leaving a wide slit on the side of his palm. Tony winced at the pain, his blood oozing out.
“Tony. . .is that my name?” Tony asked him nervously, unsure.
