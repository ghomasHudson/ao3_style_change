Tony whimpers. Steve sends him an inquiring look, immediately stopping dead in his tracks.
Steve nods slowly, pulling the sides of the jacket further apart. It still remains zipped at the base; still covering Tony's hips and part of his thighs, so that Steve can't yet see the panties he's wearing. He kisses Tony again, briefly, and then finally grazes at his nipples with his fingertips.

He opens his legs so wide that he feels his thighs burning, his muscles unused to the sudden stretch. He raises the small of his back so it doesn't push against the mattress, his body in perfect position for Steve to just fucking settle between his legs and pound the goddamn life out of him already, his fists closing around the sheets and his chest rising and falling quickly with all the impatient pace of his breathing; he feels like he's gonna

Not that he can see his own butt from where he's laying, but he can watch Steve's face as he keeps staring at it and that's all he needs to see to know what Steve thinks. Steve's hands slowly grab his hips, resting lightly – if barely – just a inch above the curve of his ass.
“Again,” he whispers, eyes wet. “Just – be gentler.
The pain is so sudden and so

His breath catches in his throat.

and incredibly swollen, his nipples hard and still pointing forward, and Tony thinks they should definitely do this again some time soon.
“What,” he says, as Tony just blinks at him. “I don't want them to get ruined. I – ”
“Just – just sensitive,” Tony murmurs, swallowing. “Pumped 'em for a while. Please keep going.”
Steve eyes him for a second, but he knows better than to protest. He lays down, letting Tony straddle him as he fixes the pillows behind his head, and then Tony smirks down at him and kisses him some more.

, but Tony can hear it anyway.
It's just, he's seen the way Steve stared at those when Tony showed him an old picture of himself in his teenage years, alright? He had first gotten one of his nipples pierced when he was twenty-one, thinking it would be fun and everything until he realized it hurt a little too badly, and had to go to the hospital in a rush to avoid a nasty infection. (To his defense, or maybe not so much, he had gotten the piercing done by a friend of his completely unqualified for the job, in a hurry, and being drunk off his ass.)
It's been a few years since his last major panic attack which he had one night when Pete was still a baby. Probably a few months after they brought him home, Tony woke up from a terrible nightmare, sweating and panting and gasping for air, thinking he lost his baby boy.
He can’t help but ask for it and dreads the answer as soon as the words leave his mouth. He scrambles to cover it up.
“Don’t you recognize me?”
the spell said.
The next day, Steve woke up early, opened the shop, and had the satisfaction of removing the sign about him closing the shop down, and replacing it with one that proudly displayed “OPEN”. He hummed to himself as he went back to the kitchen, confident that it would take some time before any customers came. He had time to eat with Tony.
Tony twisted on himself, and where he’d been a moment prior, a concentrated flash of yellow ripped through the air. It was smaller, more precise than the Witch’s previous attacks, as if she’d managed to focus her magic into a narrower beam.
Tony nodded and beckoned James closer. They repeated the same process as last time, Tony visibly struggling more this time. But James seemed to have more power, and together, they managed to turn him back into a human, albeit with more body hair and a stronger musculature. His nails were a bit longer than was normal, and his teeth glinted a little too much in the light from the fire. But he was human enough. Tony himself had changed shape too, his hands more like claws, scales running up his arms, stray feathers sprouting from his skin and hair. He was half-raven to James’ half-dog.
It took a while, the streets getting busier and more winding the closer he got to the city centre, where the castle lay in all its stony glory. It was on a height, looking over the city. Steve hadn’t seen it before, but the “thousand-step stairs” were famous across the kingdom. Word was, if you weren’t determined enough to climb the stairs, then you didn’t deserve to see the King. Steve had never liked that rumour, because the most determined man would never be able to climb these stairs if he had no arms and no legs. But the symbolism was strong. When you walked on the stairs, you would be able to see the whole city, and the whole city would see you. You couldn’t just go see the King on a whim. From a military standpoint, having the castle on a height was smart as well.
Steve wondered if they had progressed further since the last time he had seen them. He should probably ask Tony about them. And try to mend bridges after having told him right in his face that he was a liar.
Steve was almost sure that Stark had caught a falling star, and now he was telling Steve never to do that.
There was someone in the distance. Who was it? Steve needed to know. He started running towards the figure, taking greater and greater strides, until he was tall and strong enough to sprint towards the man, no, boy, standing still in the water. The boy must have been ten, his dark hair glinting in the starlight. He was holding a star in his hands, preventing it from reaching the water. It was jumping wildly around, light spilling from between his fingers. Steve was still running, but he couldn’t come closer. A star fell before him, slipped between his outstretched hands, fizzling out when hitting the water.
Because Steve didn’t want another mouth to feed, of course.
Steve turned around, and was astonished to discover that during the night, the purple flower plant had sprouted several new roots, one of them protruding from the root from the day before, almost as if the root had birthed the second, smaller root. Tony’s spell had done wonders.
Steve’s white as a sheet but Tony soldiers on. Steve’ll catch on soon enough anyway.
It’s just a matter of time. He can’t live like this.
the plot thickens.....
, Steve, and I couldn’t handle it. I could barely handle it when I read about it in the aftermath, and I don’t want to know how bad it was to live through it. I don’t even know if I would want these memories back, Steve, because I think it would break me irrevocably. And I can’t say why I did what I did during the war, but I know I did it because I thought it was the best way to protect all of you, to protect you, Steve. And I failed to protect you, and then I—then I practically killed myself.”
If he’d been strong, he would have found a sturdy bag of rice and punched it until his knuckles hurt. But now, he couldn’t do that, could he? What was he going to do? He needed to get this anger out, it was infecting him, festering in his heart, and he hated it.
A big thank you to everyone who comments. <333
Whatever he was doing, it worked, because the dog started to shake himself, almost closing his eyes, the picture of utter concentration. With a low grunt, he started shifting, growing and darkening into the man that Steve had seen before.
Where the suits of armour had glowed a familiar blue, their lights were now a menacing red, the same as Jocasta’s fire. She had taken control of the suits.
Steve ran to his room, grabbed sheets of paper, and started painting furiously. He painted for hours, painted strong walls and fortresses and barriers and mountain ranges, anything that could symbolise protection. He painted Tony’s castle, surrounded by guarding knights, protected by Steve’s shield, safe behind a wall of armours like the one in the workshop.
They were even, Steve realised after a few minutes. None of them was gaining the upper hand. How long would this fight go on? Should he try to intervene anyways? Maybe he could…maybe he could throw his shield at them. He looked at it, tried to imagine himself throwing it, and ended up with a picture of his foot crushed under the shield.
The two last sentences weren’t meant for Steve, but he heard them clearly, nonetheless. It seemed that the King and Stark knew each other well, because the King was broadcasting light-hearted annoyance and not anger.
Steve’s moved closer. He’s always so quiet, Tony would think he wasn’t in the room if it wasn’t for the soft breathing he can now hear over his head. It’s one thing that Tony’s always envied Steve. For all his strength and size, he can do stealth with the best of them. Tony doesn’t like stealth. He hides himself not behind silence and shadows, but behind words and masks. He’s never been silent. He doesn’t
Steve deflected, calmly declaring:
wanted to punch the Witch in the face.
“We should go to Mr. Stark’s lab and check if he isn’t a Skrull or another shape-shifting alien, I’m glad that Mr. Fantastic gave me the detector last Thursday, and we should also check for magic—”
Whoops. That last part had slipped out of its own accord.
But the castle was clean, it wasn’t time for dinner yet, and there weren’t any spells that Steve could prepare, because he’d already made all the spells from the damn pile.
This was our garden, and to honour her memory, I’ve continued to sow flowers every year. She, on the other hand, has claimed this desert as hers, transforming it into the Waste we see now. There aren’t any living creatures in the Waste save for her. She reigns over a dead country, and extends it bit by bit. I’ve tried to warn people about her, I’ve told them to plant flowers and trees and anything that can stop the sand’s progress. Only a few have listened, even fewer have succeeded in growing life.
He lifted his shield and slammed it into her, the wall creaking with the force of his blow. His shield could damage her, he knew. He lifted it over his head, driving the edge into her chest, again and again, and the wall crumbled behind her. They tumbled into the hole, finding themselves in the hills, rolling away from the damaged castle. Steve pushed himself up and straddled Jocasta. She was weaker now, further away from the Waste and further away from her home. He knew his only chance was to overpower her physically, to not give her the time to cast magic.
Jarvis was exhausted, for some reason, he’d seemed better after the fight with the Witch, but now he looked almost as bad as Tony, flames flickering and ready to die at the smallest hint of wind. Steve and James were both cursed by the Witch, both of them having lost control of their body, albeit in a different way, and Tony was about to die at her hands.
Would you look at that, the blond knew Tony.
He made as if to leave the lab, but swayed back when Cap’s jaw clicked, a resigned tilt to his head.
It’s hard to think.
“Please come in, Mr. scarecrow.”
Steve gasped. This was everything he’d wanted to hear, everything he’d never dared to hope. He breathed out in relief. The last uncertainty about Tony’s errands had been cleared: all this time, when Steve had thought he was off flirting or fleeing his responsibilities, he’d had feelings for Steve only, and he’d been looking for Strange.
He should have asked what
, Tony thought, and the world exploded around him.
He couldn’t get them out of his head, Tony changed, Tony dying, Tony dead.
Right now, Steve was thinking about how hopeless his situation really was. He wouldn’t get any help from Stark, not after being that disrespectful towards him, which meant his only hope was to break the contract. But in weeks of searching, he still hadn’t come any further. Jarvis was of no help, never answering any questions that would aid Steve on his quest, choosing to remain silent or deflect instead. It was beyond frustrating, but Steve couldn’t blame Jarvis. After all, his contract prevented him from breaking it or helping anyone break it. And now, Steve didn’t even know if Jarvis would honour his part of the pact even if Steve somehow managed to break the contract. Jarvis was fond of Stark, and he was rightfully angry at Steve for insinuating that he practised black magic and ate people’s hearts.
He couldn’t lose his concentration now.
Steve rolled his head on his shoulders, stretched a bit, and stood up, only to fall back down in the chair when a sudden spell of dizziness hit him. He wasn’t feeling too well, he realised. Maybe he should take it easy.
She bent down and picked Jarvis, Tony’s heart, up. It throbbed weakly in her hand, the black and blue almost swallowed by the orange-red fire. She smiled, her mouth opening wide, her jaw unhinging until it was a gaping maw.
“Do you— your heart, is it—”
Steve jerked in the suit’s hold as he realised what that meant.
“I am, even if I think your idea is quite stupid. What do you want me to tell the King?”
“That will be the day I’m ten thousand days old. And by the curse, it will be the day the Witch of the Waste claims me.”
Each step upward was more difficult than the one before, but not physically. No, he felt himself grow strong and tall again as he walked and walked, his heart beating steadier, his breaths deep once more. But his resolve to continue climbing the steps was weakened, constantly attacked by malicious whispers.
Miss O’Casta turned around, still clutching the paper, and proclaimed loudly:
“She’s gone. For now. Let’s just…let’s head home, Cap.”
Tony hugged him back just as fiercely, his strong arms fitting perfectly against Steve’s back.
He jumped into the air, whirling with the shield, kicking the suit of armour that was holding James in its chest, sending it careening backwards into the one holding Strange. Steve landed in a crouch, and when he saw that Jocasta was bringing the heart closer to her mouth, he didn’t think.
“Well, I’m sure he had very good arguments as to why he should refuse a King’s request. Please, enlighten me.”
Tony decides to ignore what happened in the last loop, apart from the fact that Steve is apparently already inside the tower when the loop starts—and why is that a surprise, they all live here, for god’s sake—which explains why he was able to enter it two loops ago. Which means that if Tony wants to put distance between them, he’ll have to use one of his stealth armours, and fly carefully, lest he recreate the— he doesn’t think about it.
“He doesn’t work well with others, he’s always alone in his castle, you really wouldn’t want to have him in your court, and—"
Stark groaned, a long, drawn out sound, and curled in on himself. Steve stepped closer, not really knowing what to say, because Stark had a point. It was very plausible that Steve had messed up while cleaning the jars. He stopped moving forward when he saw what was happening with Starks’ hair.
“Heart attack. I need the electricity to power the repulsor pump that keeps it beating, but it’s weak, and steadily getting worse. Is there really nothing you can do?” The desperation leaked into his voice.
He waved his fingers above the flower, which glowed slightly for a second. Nothing else changed, though, and Steve raised an eyebrow. Tony laughed at his inquisitive look.
Tony’s fingers twitched, and Strange arms tensed, but Jocasta tightened her grip on James in warning. Blood was seeping through her claws, the only sound his pants for air and the crackling of the fire demons.
Steve felt the heat rise up his neck, his cheeks, his ears, and knew that he was beet red. He’d been waxing poetic about Tony instead of talking about his issues. In short, he was doing the exact opposite of what he had come to do. Desperately, he tried to find something that would dissuade the King, and came up with nothing better than:
. And I know that knowing about the incursions is already putting your whole world upside down, and I know that it would have killed you to lose all hope. And I know it’s selfish of me to take the decision and the knowledge out of your hands, but I do it all to protect you, and I want you to be as happy as possible, and I can’t bear to see you lose yourself. I also know you’ll never agree with me about this, but I want…I want you to stay true to yourself, and if I have to lie for that, then so be it. Nothing is more important than—nothing is more important than you.”
Maybe he shouldn’t have been this frank. It had obviously shaken Tony up, to hear it in such uncertain terms, but Steve was sick of half-truths and deflections. Tony had a right to keep some things a secret, but he shouldn’t have to lie about it. Steve would accept a simple “It’s none of your business”—he wouldn’t accept it
Stark sighed, looked at Jarvis meaningfully, to which Jarvis raised his eyebrows. Stark sighed again, deeper this time.
He was right. It had happened, they couldn’t change it, they could just move forward and hope.
He can barely feel the hand on his chest anymore.
“I know, I know, but it’s fine, I haven’t let her into the castle, she can’t get to Jarvis. It’s fine, we can just go visit her and defeat her together.”
He’s so tired of this.
“I understand. But James mentioned that you were looking for me. Why were you?”
“Is your brotherly protectiveness kicking in, Mr. Rogers? Unfortunately, you won’t be able to meet him, because he’s under a curse that is at least as heavy as yours. We’re doing all we can to help him, Natasha most of all, but it’s an arduous process.”
Tony doesn’t listen.
She’d have her wish fulfilled, albeit in an unconventional manner.
“Steve! Are you okay? I came as fast as I could , oh God, you’re so cold—”
Had the dog—man? Weredog?—attacked Tony at Shield because he was courting Natasha? Or was it because he worked for the Witch?
Jarvis’ gaze tore right into Steve.
She was the Witch’s fire demon, and she was after Tony’s heart, or Jarvis, and Steve had
Besides, Stark was covered in goop, Steve was panting like an old dog, so it wasn’t really—It wasn’t—It wasn’t like that.
He sounded hoarse. Tony shifted on his feet. Why was Iron Man insisting he wasn’t Tony Stark? It was getting really strange. He inched backwards just as Cap put himself between Iron Man and Tony and said lowly:
It wasn’t his business, but Steve was too curious to let it go.
“I—what? What are you talking about?”
Tony doesn’t let himself smell or taste them, but he allows himself to look. He lets himself imagine what it would taste like, still warm, sticky and liquid, coating his lips and sliding down his throat. The coppery smell would be everywhere. He would gag on it, the smell, and still stick his nose in the blood, inhale everything.
And he’d said that Tony knew about Steve’s curse. Added with the fact that Tony had been looking for him, there were a lot of things Tony hadn’t said to him. Why had Tony been looking for him, why hadn’t he mentioned it to Steve, and why hadn’t he told him that he knew about the curse? Steve felt stupid, now, stupid that he hadn’t thought of that. All the other magic users he’d encountered had known about his curse right from the start, and Steve had never thought to question why Tony was acting as if he didn’t know about it.
He coughs again, and this time, he can’t breathe in after. His chest is too tight. There’s fresh blood splattered on Steve’s cheek.
he thought. He’d met friendlier dogs.
“Stark did that?”
When the castle stopped moving and rumbling, Jarvis died down to his original size, his glow turning a dark marine blue. He closed his eyes and fell asleep. Tony looked exhausted as well, the cut on his temple opened again. As he staggered past Steve to put Jarvis in the fireplace again, he noticed that there was a lump of dark matter inside of Jarvis. What was it? Was it his physical form? His body? His heart? Was this why Jarvis was so afraid to leave the fireplace, because he had a vulnerable centre? Could this thing be what Tony had given Jarvis?
She knew Stark? Steve looked at him. His face was blank for barely a moment, before he pasted on the most charming smile Steve had ever seen.
Steve was in the middle of reading a book about mermaids and their natural habitat when the Porthaven door opened with a bang. He jumped up, clutching his shield in his hand, but it was only Tony. Tony, who was dishevelled, out of breath, and paler than Steve had ever seen him.
Steve’s blush is back in full force, and this time Tony can see his mouth as his lips part in a silent “o” of surprise, the widening of his eyes, the lashes that are sinfully long, the straight line of his nose, the arched brows. There’s a strand of hair that’s gotten loose from Steve’s head, and it curls slightly over his forehead, damp with sweat. Steve’s eyes are the same blue as tightly compressed glacier ice. They’re the only cool thing in Steve’s face.
He’s lost his company, he’s lost his apartments, he’s lost his money, his friends are leaving him.
They fight and grapple and throw and punch and kick and Tony feels
“Yes, with Tony. We’re partners. There are others on the team, we’re super powered individuals who try to fight for good. And you, you were an adventurer? I can hardly imagine Tony going on adventures, he’s always so busy with the company--well. Maybe I don’t know him as well as I thought I did.”
Steve rounds on him again, eyes wide and chest heaving, and he looks torn between punching Tony’s face in or running away.
the thought of losing you.”
No wonder Stark didn’t want anything to do with her! Bad enough that she attacked sorcerers and threatened kings, but it was personal between Stark and her, which meant that everything would be worse.
Did he just stop his heart because he wanted to be
The whistle of the wind was fainter here, allowing Steve to hear something that had been lost in the wind before. It was a distant cacophony of huffing and puffing, of grinding gears and screeching metal, combined with a low whine. It couldn’t come from the town, because the wind blew from the hills to Brooklyne, and, besides, there were no factories there that made that kind of sound. Was this the sound of those gargantuan air-ships he’d heard about? Was there one of them at the bottom of the valley?
Steve had to know what Tony had given Jarvis.
The day was coming to an end, and now that Steve didn’t have to make spells and help customers anymore, he thought back to the mysterious spell of the day before. He hadn’t come any further, and Stark would more likely than not find the spell, since he was systematically going through the list of commissions and requests by their customers.
“Th—thank you, Stark. I know you know who cursed me, but I don’t work for her. Please believe me, I wasn’t with her of my own volition.”
The sight on the far wall was even stranger though. Several shelves were filled with small machines that made noise and moved slightly. They were glowing the same blue light as the castle and had a life of their own. Steve had seen automatons before, but these had a fluidity that the others had lacked. They looked almost alive. They were
As Cap said it, he went from angry to disbelieving to confused. Apparently, the situation didn’t make any sense to him. Well, good, because it didn’t make any sense to Tony either. Nor to Iron Man, judging by their earlier confrontation. This was a mess. And what was that about Tony being Iron Man’s employer? Tony knew his every employee, and this one was not part of them. It seemed like this was one big misunderstanding, but Tony wasn’t about to correct Cap. If he could keep Cap as an ally, he would.
Each time it was harder, each time he was gripped with doubts, but he had to believe it. He knew that if he said no, he would never reach the top of the stairs.
“Yeah. She’s after his life.”
They followed her inside, Stark complimenting the décor and colours, Steve frowning to himself. Stark had eyes only for Miss O’Casta. Had he forgotten about Natasha already? Maybe it was for the best, because at least then Natasha wouldn’t have to pretend to be interested anymore. But that meant that if Miss O’Casta liked Stark, they would end up together—at least for a short while. And Steve didn’t want to have her in the castle, getting in the way and taking up space. Why, oh why did Stark need to flirt all the time? He was asking her to dinner, Steve noticed, and was glad to hear her reject his offer, albeit politely. It looked like she wasn’t interested after all.
Tony staggers back against the wall, lets himself slide down. Whatever he does, whatever he says, it’ll end everything they ever were. Steve has given him no choice. He wants to scream, take the suit and fly far, far away, until there’s nothing but Tony and his thoughts and his feelings that won’t stay down, that come up in his throat and threaten to choke him. He wants to fly into the sun, until he’s nothing but dust. But there’s nowhere he can go, because he’s stuck in the loop, and it’s fitting, in a way, that he’s been running after the future all his life, that it’s been sliding between his fingers during these last months, but that he has an infinite amount of time, right here, with Steve. Time has been running out for months, but now it’s still, and he’s going to destroy everything anyway.
“What the fuck where you thinking, going off half-cocked and
That was a smart question, and a scary one.
Jarvis replied again, in the negative.
Steve asked Jarvis about Shield, and why they wanted Stark’s favours. If they needed his skills, couldn’t they buy them from him in Ma’hattan? Lord Fury had to know that Potts was Stark, right? By the way, why wasn’t Stark part of a guild?
“Let’s try to find out who you are, huh?” Tony murmured. The hand that was petting the weredog glowed a bright blue, Tony muttering under his breath.
This time, Tony’s the one to attack. He brings his knee high up as if he’s going to kick, but at the last moment, he turns it into a jump and kicks forward with his other foot. Steve bats it aside in a strong block, stepping in to backhand Tony. Tony drops to a crouch and rolls away to avoid Steve’s low sweep. He doesn’t have the time to stand straight before Steve jumps in with a right hook. Tony grabs his wrist and uses Steve’s momentum to send him to the ground, keeping hold of Steve’s wrist to get an elbow lock. Steve twists before Tony can secure the lock, bending his arm and pushing himself to his knees and hand, his wrist still in Tony’s grip. Tony doesn’t know if that last twist should have been enough to dislodge him and at this point he doesn’t care. All he wants is to win. He uses Steve’s spin against himself and bends his arm against his back, bringing the wrist up high between Steve’s shoulder blades. Tony drops a knee on the small of Steve’s back, forcing Steve flat against the mat. Tony slowly brings the wrist higher and higher until Steve taps the mat twice. Tony stills and lets himself grin savagely for a second. He’s won. He doesn’t let Steve go, not just yet. He needs to bask in it first, in the fact that Steve is under him, pinned to the mat. Tony lets his head drop to Steve’s shoulder and huffs out a laugh. Under him, Steve’s relaxed, laughing breathlessly himself. This was more intense than either of them anticipated. Steve smells delectable, the musk of sweat only enhancing the sweet fragrance of the serum. Tony darts his tongue out, the tip touching Steve’s neck for just a moment, and Steve shivers at the touch. Tony won’t mention it if Steve doesn’t ask what just brushed him. For all he knows, it was Tony’s nose, or a drop of sweat.
“How could I forget,” he said dryly. Their arguing, shouting and pushing about what the right thing to do was, caused a lot of problems on that mission, and the whole team had been pretty fed up by the end of it.
“Yea, sure.”
“His name’s Damien,” he said. Steve narrowed his eyes, committing it to memory, as his wings became tenser.
to do. A part of him didn’t want to get better. So how could he?
As it turns out, the Avengers were going on a camping trip. That was sure to go well.
“I – wasn’t-” Tony gritted out. He was building up a sweat, “You gonna get off me, now?”
Steve nodded, but still checked Tony over.
“Steve, I just have to defuse one, so-”
“No, I’ll definitely be needing mine. And probably yours as well.”
Anger put a hand over his eyes.
“That concealer really isn’t doing much for those bags under his eyes, you know what I mean?” Disgust said. Joy rolled her eyes.
“Now, I haven’t used one of these in a while, but this equipment is all pretty high tech so…” Bruce was saying, looking at the screen.
Steve that it was safe – absolutely
Steve started laughing.
Steve furrowed his brows, “What?”
The emotions inside Tony’s head kept flipping between shouting and arguing chaotically and just letting the function run automatically, all sense of hope for cooperation forgone.
Anger breathed a sigh of relief.
“Damien,” he said, disliking the taste of the name on his mouth. Tony inwardly smiled as he walked away.
“I have to say I agree, boss,” Happy said, appearing in the garage doorway, and Tony sighed. “Otherwise you’re gonna re-break something.”
“Tony? Iron Man, come in!” Steve called wildly, looking around but not being able to find anything. They were outside the rogue enemy building that had been mainly subdued before the bombs exploded, and now, outside the other end of the building, there were bits flying everywhere, raining down the destruction caused.
“Hey, hey, it’s ok, don’t talk, it’s ok, they’re coming,” Steve said in a rush, wide-eyed, trying to reassure Tony, whose scared eyes were now open and looking around.
He looked up to see Steve looking at him with worried blue eyes, searching his face for signs of discomfort.
getting annoying, so she helped up Fear and pushed Sadness to the side on her wheelie chair, her heavy, laden weight going begrudgingly. She often said she held the weight of the world.
“Um…” Steve sat down, and dragged the chair closer to Tony, looking into his eyes, as he smiled back, his hair ruffled, with a thin tube attached through his nose. He was doing better.
“I’m…Going on holiday.”
“I already went to the Christingle on my own. Figured you probably wouldn’t wanna come.”
Steve smiled. “Yea…Our little girl.” He was so excited every time he thought about it, especially since they had found out their baby was a girl.
How would he kill himself? There’s many ways that he thought would be fitting. But he bought a gun with him for a reason.
“I thought you wanted to do the whole she-bang?”
“’Sup,” he said, nodding.
Tony felt slightly guilty for getting mad at Steve. Only slightly.
This is more from Tony's point of view, is longer, as I have finally figured out this story, more or less, so it shouldn't be too long till further updates. To me, that means like a week or so, I don't know.
Breathing was, sometimes.
Damn super-soldier couldn’t leave him alone.
Tony was devouring his face, while trying to undo the buttons on Steve’s shirt.

When he had finished another work, a black and white of a kitten he saw overlooking a tower in the city, he went to Tony’s suite, and was pleased to be let in. He found Tony on his balcony, sitting on a low deck chair, with a small table in front of him of chess.
“Turn to the side a bit,” Bruce ordered, and Tony did. Bruce looked at the screen, around where Tony’s kidneys were outlined in the ultrasound scan. It seemed mainly normal…so what was in his abdomen was…
“Tony,” Steve whispered, trying to stop him for a moment. He looked up at him.
“You know,” Tony says after a while, taking in a deep breath, and motioning to the sea, “I would throw this gun in the ocean, but I’m worried it would upset the wildlife. Environment-friendly and all.” He swallowed. Steve nodded and blinked a few times, and took a few steps forward, into the shade of the tree. He held out his hand and Tony looked down, switching it in his hands. The only sounds that could be heard was his quiet breathing and the birds in the trees.
Bruce went to get some equipment. He came back with the transducer and another wheelie machine with the screen on for the ultrasound.
The emotions wore old clothes, like Steve did back in the day. Their control room was somewhat military-like with a radio in the back, war-bunker style tables and chairs, but it was also relaxed, with American flags in random places and helpful arrow signs for the emotions to navigate.
i'm planning for some more drama next chapter, don't worry.
Bruce looked at Tony as he lifted the transducer and Tony held his top up.
Secondly, he wouldn’t let him tinker on his tech by himself when there was a thunderstorm outside. Said it was ‘dangerous’.
“Look after it now, OK?” He said sternly to the machine, as it made a happy beeping sound and scooted away. Tony shook his head, then looked at Steve who was looking at him with a weird, maybe fond expression.
Who showed him his detailed drawings with a bashful, hopeful smile. Tony couldn’t help but turn up a lip. They were great drawings, it would sell impressively at a charity auction. Why was that his first thought? But it wasn’t really. His first thought was that this is just a young man trying to achieve something, doing something he loves. And the first person he went to was Tony. And ok, he wasn’t
Steve took a deep breath, “You realise I’m not going to let you – kill yourself. Right?”
“DISGUST!”
to see that,” he smirked, and then went under the small roof of the boat to start the engine up, as he slowly pulled away from the shore. Steve probably would have liked to gone with him.
Steve felt sick, and gripped onto a chair, his hands clenching with dread.
Just like Tony’s Iron Man suit, the tip of his feathered outstretched wing was now golden yellow, and it looked great on him. But they weren’t there before. Steve’s white-tipped wings weren’t there before yesterday either. Which meant…oh, please, let it means what he thinks.
“I know,” Tony looked at him condescendingly, “Doesn’t mean you aren’t. You do a great job at being the team mom.”
Support team?
“S-s.”
Natasha turned to him, and squinted, “You should talk to Steve.”
“WHY?” Tony shouts, and then takes a beat, “Why do
to do it without you. I mean, being love with you ain’t easy you know, so, er, come back to me. When you can. So we can talk and you can make fun of me or…But know that I’m here. And I sure as hell ain’t going anywhere, not as long as you need someone to remind you how much you’re needed, wanted,
, and friends, and enjoying the festivities, going to church, and maybe some pieces of fruit in your  stocking.”
“Aw, I knew you were a softie at heart,” Tony said, and laughed a bit to break the tension, as he patted Steve on the back.
“Joy-!”
“Guys, I need medics, quinjet,
Joy was in a heated argument with Anger, who was constantly hitting things like a spoilt child. Sadness was crying, watching sad memories, as usual. Fear was hiding underneath the control table, teeth chattering. Disgust had pictures of all the emotions up on the wall of the control centre, and was throwing darts at it.
“Ok…” she looked at him searchingly, “let me just get them up for you.”
“I TOLD you he wants sex, and you just said, oh, no, he’s an old-fashioned guy, marriage first and all that, well you know they had UNMARITAL SEX IN THE FORTIES, FEAR! AND IT’S NOT EVEN THE FOURTIES ANYMORE!” Disgust screeched.
Tony looked at the sick he had produced on the floor, feeling nauseated, threatening to heave again. The suit’s cool metal arm slapping him on his back was not very helpful, and he batted the hand away. Dum-E started coming over, beeping as he got his dust-pan and brush out, but not before Tony was sick again, adding to the pile, unable to stop the bile and sickly contents that retched out, and was still finding it hard to breathe. His face felt tight.
Tony looks at him and decides, what the hell. It’s worth a chance to trust someone. Even if they let you down, he doesn’t
“No,” He whispered back, winding his hand around Tony’s waist to pull him closer, as Tony gasped slightly. “This doesn’t feel bad at all… And I think I know what we can do,” he said, brushing his nose against Tony’s, as those brown eyes slide shut, the only sound his breathing, as Steve rubbed his hand across Tony’s skin, and licked his lips as he brushed them by Tony’s nose, and Tony lifted his chin slightly so he finally captured Steve’s lower lip, pulling it gently down to him, his hands coming up to Steve’s neck.
“Oh honey, look, you’ve got lots of other jeans, ok?” Steve said, a look of sympathy in his eyes as he continued sorting stuff out. He was having a spring clean. Tony was pouting to himself in the mirror.
“Tony?” Steve saw him on his way out, “Where are you going?”
“Yes,
“Well, it’s – it’s about Tony. I know you’ve been seeing him, helping him, and I just thought…”
“What? You- but- you need me- what if-”
Tony lets out a breath he was holding and puts his elbows on his knees to rest them for a while.
“These are my favourite jeans,” Tony said, raising his eyebrows in the mirror as he saw Steve turn around and look, “And they – they just don’t fit. It’s not – I can’t button them-” Tony tried, but it really wouldn’t reach.
“Yep…” Natasha said, reading a magazine.
“Tony,” Rhodey laughed, “Are you even in your second trimester yet?”
“Well, we can try, if you want. But there’s a little tree in the kitchen that might be more suitable.”
appreciate it.”
“Disgust, draw up a list of what he could mean by that. QUICKLY!”
“Er…” Tony stuttered, then Rhodey came from behind him and said they needed to go, “No, I er – Rhodey’s taking me, it’s fine, Cap.”
“I mean, no one, I was just – I just thought – but if it’s true, hey-”
“How are you? How do you feel?”
“Yea, a bit,” Tony replied absentmindedly.
But Steve did worry a lot. He had to.
“No, Tony, just lie down for a
“Yea.”
Anger tip-toed back to his seat. He pressed a small button.
“Looks like I’m running the shots,” Joy said, sneakily taking control of the main functioning.
“So you don’t like….like me.”
“Are you alright? What’s going on?”
“Really...” Steve stopped what he was doing and considered this. Tony smirked, and went back to tidying up.
“Steve,” Tony said severely, looking into the mirror.
“Y-yes, it would. Thank you, Tony, this is…”
Steve softened. “No. I – not if you don’t want me to.”
“You know, I remember one time on Christmas back in the 30s, I think it was…’32, we all went to the media shop in town to gather round and listen to the King give a Christmas message,” Steve smiled.
“And then after – after the whole – after you were attacked, it was like I found a new anger. An anger of not protecting you, of not being there enough like I could have been. And I know, you can protect yourself, but…I didn’t wanna lose you. I wanted to get to know you properly, but now this terrible thing happened, and suddenly you were – well, suicidal, and I, well I thought I could have done more before to be a friend to you. I realised maybe I thought of you as something more than a friend, differently to everyone else, and that I wanted you to be my partner in the way it wouldn’t be right back in my day – but I knew you wouldn’t want that. I think I resented that a bit. I've been angry at what happened, and mad at myself, and at everything, and pushing my other feelings aside. I’m sorry, I know this must be confusing for you, to say the least. But Tony, I honestly don’t know what I would do without you. And these feelings for you that I realised I had, they scared me – until I realised what they meant.”
“Tony..” Steve swallowed and rushed over to kneel down beside him.
“Steve, calm down.”
Tony took a deep sip of his drink. He decided to go to his kitchen early, whip up a fabulous meal cooked by the finest chef in New York whom he had invited over, and then it was just…a meal. With a friend. With someone more than a friend. With Steve. He ended up just tidying things up in his private dining room, overlooking open doors to the balcony. He couldn’t really concentrate much. He was nervous.
“Yea, that’s fine,” Bruce said, squeezing some of the gel on Tony’s stomach. He took a deep breath, looking nowhere in familiar, and as Steve looked at him he took Tony’s hand in his own, grasping it tightly. Tony smiled thinly at him, trying not to show his worry.
“Yea. He looked like he was gonna cry. It wasn’t pretty.”
, I still need to run some tests,
“You all feel like that?” Joy asked, and the other emotions just looked away guiltily, “Guys…”
“Oh – thank you,” Steve looked down at the business card given to him.
“Oh – Steve- oh, oh-”
I know it's been a while since I updated. I have put this as 2/2 chapters, as I probably will not continue it. However, I really like the concept.
to be there for you if I can.”
Joy crossed her arms.
Steve smiled. “Of course.”
Steve held up Tony’s hand and kissed it tenderly.
I hope you liked the perspective, let me know what you think :)
“This... is never what Christmas was supposed to be about.”
Steve smiled joyfully, “Oh, that’s how it’s gonna be.”
“Finally, he decides to speak,” Clint’s dry voice came through. Steve looked over to Tony, who looked up at him. He looked rough.
“You can,” he said quietly. “Hey, can I try something?”
“That’s how it’s gonna be, huh?” Tony asked, lifting an eyebrow.
“Guys, can’t you see? He’s blushing, it’s cute!” Joy said, “Oh my gosh, tell him he’s cute!”
Steve smiled in spite of himself. “You need help with that?” Steve pointedly didn’t answer the comment and gestured to Tony’s struggle trying to reach a box, it would seem, at the back of the high shelf.
“You know, I see him in my
“I’m so glad I don’t have to give birth.”
on Earth.
Steve was waiting a bit anxiously by the time he saw Tony’s boat come around the corner and start heading back to shore, as he let out a breath of relief. Ok, he may be overreacting. He definitely didn’t want to be that type of friend – or person – who seemed like a protective parent instead of, well – a protective friend. Yea, he can’t really escape it. He just didn’t wanna seem controlling.
Tony looked a little guilty, but exasperated as well.
I've been looking forward to doing an Avengers camping trip for so long, and I realised, why not incorporate it in this fic?
“It’s supposed to be about being with your
“Because I know what to be optimistic about, Joy. Not emotions and feelings, but of things that we can actually accomplish. Like
Tony coughed, sitting up and aiming towards the ground when he was sick. What came out was nightmarish. Tony felt how it looked like.
Ok, now he just sounded creepy, or objectifying him. Or reassuring his anxiety? Why in the world was this so hard to figure out?
“Because I can’t-”
“I get it, Steve,” Tony said brazenly, “It’s difficult to resist this.” He motioned to himself.
“…Feel pain?” Someone’s voice. It was familiar.
They stood awkwardly for a moment.
Tony smiled at him, enjoying the adorable look on Steve’s face.
“Well, Sandra,” she said, “But Tony decided to call me Sandy. I don’t mind, Mr Rogers.”
Steve rubbed his thumb along Tony’s ear, and Tony let out a small little sound, and held onto Steve’s shirt, angling his head for a better position.
, we’re by the lake.” Tony was looking worse, and Steve rested his hand on his back, as Tony suddenly coughed again, and he spit blood out. Steve heard the quinjet coming, and looked around wildly.
down Tony’s legs, as they melt into one…
Tony took a sip of his drink.
“Tony,” he breathed, beginning to panic. He pressed his comms to his ear.
“Of course, boss,” came the automated response. Tony smiled.
“I like this,” Tony said to him, tracing lines on Steve’s chiseled chest with his fingers.
“You will be worth saving every time and er…” Steve tried to regain his voice, swallowing thickly, taking a deep breath. “And I really...I just wish you could hear me now, hell, maybe you can, but I need you to know that. And I know this sounds like I’m a teenage boy pining, but…for some reason, I don’t think I can do this without…No. I don’t think I
“Tony, caring about you is not expecting anything in return,” Steve says, his voice…sounding strangely soft, “Yes, it’s maybe something to do with human nature feeling good about making connections with other people, caring about them, but I don’t expect anything. I just want you to be okay. Cause I know you’re in a shitty place right now. I know. And I don’t wanna lose you.” His voice cracked a bit at the end, as if he was going to cry. Tony looked at him, and his face seemed concerned, and emotional.
“Language, Cap.”
He suddenly turned to sadness.
“I mean, obviously this is a shock for us and, erm,” Tony sniffed, and wiped his eyes to try and control himself, as Steve tightened his arm around his waist in support, “this isn’t what I – obviously this isn’t what I – what
“Okay,” Tony replied happily, and his lips curved into a small, pleased smile. Joy smiled as well, glad that it finally seemed to be going in the right direction. Love island was glowing, and it was about time.
And as soon as he got back to his room, his mind, thankfully, supplied him with a beautiful visual of Tony smiling up at him, the lines on his face showing his eyes light up, his lips moisturised from the kiss. Beautiful, and hopefully happy, and full of future, and healthy, and
“Sorry,” Natasha said, eyebrows pulled together, her hair blowing slightly in the wind. She looked wary. Steve realised he was tense.
He drifted in and out of consciousness, which was really annoying, because he could finally be able to understand what people in the room were talking about, and then things would become fuzzy, and quieter, and then he’d be out like a light, and had no clue how to tell how much time had passed by the next time he ‘woke up’ which was different to them to what it meant to him.
The headlines read:
“Can I come?” Bruce says, looking up.
“That’s you, Steve, and your other superhero-friends,” she said amusedly, “I shouldn't really be saying this, but... He trusts you. Don’t break that trust. He’s safest with you, and in good company,” Sandy smiled at him, then stood up to leave. “Here’s my number. It’s for emergencies only.”
“Ok, well you’re actually touching on ethical egoism there.” Steve looked confused. “I read a bit about, erm, ethics and philosophy,” Tony said casually, or trying to sound casual, “You know, just light reading, really…But yes, I. Understand. Your point.”
Initially, it’s the scariest thing he can imagine. In new York, and several other times, he thought it was a possibility, and then afterwards just came up with new ways to protect himself while still being able to do his job and save people when need be, to do some good. So, thinking about killing himself is pretty hard. It’s like the opposite meaning of life. Shit, how did he end up thinking about philosophy? No. no.
, you can come too, don’t wanna be missing out on the action,” Tony said somewhat bitterly, “Be nice for us all to get away for a bit, wouldn’t it.”
“Oh, fuck
“Many still do that. You can too, you know,” Natasha told him kindly, “You shouldn’t have to feel pressured by what everyone else is doing.”
Steve suddenly felt warmer, brighter, even though the sun had gone in.
“What?”
Sometimes he wondered where he got his morbid sense of humour from.
Tony put something away in the cupboard and met Steve’s knowing look and sighed.
“Ok, ladies and gents,” Anger commanded the other emotions attention, “this is how it’s gonna go.”
Sadness pulled up a memory of Obie. Of the bad things that can happen from too much being on love island, of trusting people, of getting involved too deeply. Love island was scarce enough anyway, Joy thought.
“Well, I didn’t really do it for you, you know, Cap. You guys can tag along, sure. It was really my therapist’s idea. Now, let’s see…Happy’s coming, you two…Natasha?”
Standing on a small hill overlooking the blue ocean, the jungle-like islands and the small quaint town to the side was really spectacular. Tony suddenly felt grateful to be here, to be able to appreciate these things, this beauty. This calmness. He didn’t feel calm very often. But he was in control now. It was his choice. Holding a gun in his hands didn’t feel dangerous – it was more soothing, because
He could hear Steve’s moaning breath from behind. The room was dark, it was late, and they had both been stressed lately.
“It’s going to be a family comedy.”
“Steve, look, calm down,” Tony reassures him, “It’s not – I'm fine!” Which totally sounded true. Mm-hm. Convincing. “Look, this is just a gun I happen to have, and it’s, y’know, an American’s right so... You know, normal civilians don’t get fancy weapons, do they? Huh.”
“Sounds game. I’m in.”
“Ok, ok, that’s just the gist I was getting…”
“Are you sure you’re feeling alright? You’re not sick?”
. So, naturally, to calm himself down, or do the exact opposite, he found a willing person to have sex with. Because. No.
“So…” Tony started. He didn’t really know what to say now. Usually the arguing goes on for a lot longer, or the other person just storms away, too fed up.
Tony’s face fell a little, “Look, Steve. I’m not sure that’s the best idea, I mean, I could disguise a little I guess, but I’m just- I feel like I wouldn’t belong.”
Until-
Steve thinks he could definitely get used to more fun like this.
“I…don’t think it’s from Ikea.”
Rhodey and the others came immediately and the doctors were talking to them and Tony, who was responding well, they said. There was a problem with his lung they had fixed, which happened during the explosion, but he still needed to be monitored in the hospital for a little while. The doctors told Steve it was a miracle that he was able to revive Tony, and it was because of him that he was alive, even if not in great shape. Steve had been thinking there was more that could have been done. But he was just hit with the reality of it all – that Tony really could have, honestly, died. For good. Lung too damaged beyond repair.
“Really?” Tony said a little incredulously, “No, ‘it will get better’ or, or ‘this is just a blip, you’ll feel better tomorrow’, ‘you are not what they did to you’ bullcrap?”
Once Tony was sure he was breathing properly and wouldn’t be sick again or choke any time soon, he breathed a sigh of relief and leaned heavily on Steve, who still looked alarmed and just put his arms around him firmly.
“Don’t strain yourself.”
But, it doesn’t change the fact that it would be easier if he would just die, so he didn’t have to actively kill himself. Again, this seems difficult. He feels pain. Deep inside him, in his heart – he’s even thinking he has a soul, only because it hurts so damn much, this pain that he can’t rip out of him this time. The emotions are overwhelming, seemingly made worse by the calm, warm environment of the sea he’s in. He feels like he wants to cry.
“WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?!?” Fear cried out again. He was panicking.
His tanned, golden skin shone, his low-waist trousers hanging on tightly to his hips, highlighting his curves and accentuating his butt perfectly, of which Tony may or may not be aware of. Steve wanted to tell him either way.
“All bombs have been taken care of, radiation neutralised, come in.” he tapped on his cracked watch, surprised it still worked.
“Tony-” Steve’s voice was muffled by Tony’s body. Which he dreamt of happening, but in a much different way.
. We have a chance-”
“Ok. Yea. I had that one coming.”
Steve kissed Tony’s cheek, and his ear, which made him squirm and smile widely.
Steve’s eyes lit up. That’s what they used to do, back home, every year with his Ma, or with Bucky and his family.
“Maybe. I dunno,” he said quickly before he could regret it.
And then there was Cap. Oh, no –
“I will – I’ll get it then-” Steve stuttered as he bumped into Dum-E, the machine whizzing about, as Tony told it off, and Steve went up on the chair and stretched above him to get the box Tony wanted. He brought it down and laid on the counter.
can be bull-headed at times… And, honestly, out of everyone – you’re the most potent link to my past. You remind me of Howard. And, yes, I know what you’re gonna say, he made you resent me, he never won any father-of-the-year awards, I know. And I – I wanted to protect you - not because of that, but because of
“He’s worried,” she explained, and Tony turned away, “And, the other day he told me he wants to be a feminist but doesn’t wanna be turned into a woman, and then spent approximately three minutes apologising and trying to tell me how great it was to be a woman.”
“What? Well, there must be something we can
“So...” Tony said awkwardly, “Whatcha doin?”
“Yea, I’m fine,” Tony called out. But Steve couldn’t help remember the last time he was here, in a similar situation, and Tony was certainly not okay. But he didn’t want to intrude. So, he sat down heavily on the floor, leaning against the wall, in case Tony had another nightmare.
No, it was definitely more the meaning of it. It would mean he’s fed up of feeling like this, ready to take the hard road and try and find some meaning to life. That seems pretty hard though.
“Tony? Dammit!”
He leant down again, now hearing calls through the comms, but he didn’t care. He shot a powerful breath through Tony’s lips, and the breath went straight down his throat, getting past what was stuck in his windpipe, and sending oxygen to his lungs.
“Er, thanks I guess.”
“Is it you? Is it really... you?” He asked in awe.
“Yes, ma’am,” he said, “I was hoping to have a word.”
A few tense moments of silence.
“Tony? Oh my god. Nurse! Please…” He called out, and pressed the button on his bed to get their attention.
“We need to wrap up this night,” Fear jumped into the centre chair, “That ain’t going down anytime soon, God what a great time to get a boner.” He was pulling on his army cap, and then made a silent cross sign.
Everything was low. He was tired. He didn’t want this, he felt emotional, and then he felt nothing at all.
“I doubt he would be able to carry you out if this one,” Steve said, his voice muffled as he bent down and let Tony go, his feet landing on the ground safely, though more reluctantly letting go of Tony’s butt, and Steve stood up again.
, they had made
“Even if some of what you’re saying is true – this ‘complex’ I have,” Steve decided to roll with it, “Is that so bad? Doesn’t everyone do that from time to time? Do some good deed,
Then Tony came rushing in, and saw them both, and he retreated his wings behind his back.
“Please, just let Tony have this one chance. Come on, guys. We need to work
Tony narrowed his eyes.
“…of course it is.”
“I am! I just – I didn’t wanna hurt you, I never want to do that, I knew you probably felt differently but I wouldn’t have said anything and...”
The others were watching the new island being formed. Its main stature was of Steve and Tony with their arms around each other, kissing. “Aww,” Fear said. “It’s a romance island, guys!”
It was only an hour later, when Tony had got the boat up and running, when he was getting in the boat by himself, about to ride off in it.
Tony felt like he was choking on air.
“Tony, you’re self-destructive,” Steve says bluntly, “You’re in a low, low place. The actions you’re displaying, like those cuts on your arms, show that you don’t care much about yourself at this point. So, I want to care as much for the both of us.”
“Why?” Tony asks coyly, cocking his head, “What would I be
Steve liked him?
He felt as if there wasn’t much, he could do – this isn’t really a burden they could share, and it would have been the same had Tony been a woman, or if Steve had ended up with a lady – it unnerved him. But still, he did what he could, which mostly involved intensely reading parenting books and getting pillows, food and vitamins for Tony to make sure he was comfortable and not doing too much work. Their life was about to change. In a good way, though, Steve had come to realise, as this meant he would truly feel like he wasn’t in a war anymore. That they could still be Avengers, save the world on occasion – and have a beautiful family to come home to and cherish, and nurture. He didn’t know how he had been this lucky.
It was a few days later, and they left, boarding the private plane. It was mostly a quiet journey, Tony took the few hours mostly in a private room where he attempted to get some sleep.
“So, what do you say? We give this a go?” Steve proposed, “No other ‘friends’ in that way, just me and you, and – and, painting your wing, and the team, and…”
“WHAT THE EVER-LOVING FUCK-”
“Sure. And are you coming with me to Church on Christmas day?”
Joy cocked her head, then looked back to the other meddling emotions. Joy scowled, “Fine. But you know, he can take care of himself. He’s a superhero. He has the best, most impressive suit of armour I’ve ever seen.”
“I’m on it,” Tony said and made a dash for his special cupboard, “And I’ll have yours because they don’t have an effect on you.”
Steve gritted his jaw, “Do you still need medic-”
They had an entire floor dedicated to their bedroom. It wasn’t like they didn’t need it.
WAS THAT-!”
“I know you can’t really talk about Tony – I only know you’re his therapist cause he told us so,” Steve explained, and Sandy nodded, “Your name is Sandy, right?”
“No, no! That’s not it!” Steve exclaimed, putting a hand on Tony’s arm to get him to stop inspecting himself and look up to him. “You – you look fine, trust me.” Tony raised an eyebrow. “I mean- better than fine! You look…nice. Good, um, y-yea, there is nothing wrong with-” He gestured Tony’s body in whole, “-any of that.”
Bruce swallowed and looked back to the screen where you could hear a faint but fast beep-beep-beep of a heartbeat.
. You’re so reckless, it makes me angry sometimes. And getting to know you, the real you, made me realise – that I
Steve smiled back, looking emotional. “You too. I love you.”
“But the, the
“When did – why – why me? Why do you like me? And when? And how? And in what form?” Tony said, trying to comprehend anything about the situation.
“No, Steve, I told you already!” Tony said agitatedly. “God, can’t you leave me alone for a second?” Tony was aware he was getting angry, but he was just fed
Basically, well – she was probably right. But she had reassured him, that whatever his problems, whatever labels or medication ascribed to him, it would get better, and it was always worth the chance to explore deeper into his mentality, now that he was able to open up a bit.
“Yes, I understand. People have expectations of you. It must be pressurising.”
, and like –
“I guess we haven’t really, um, thought about it much,” Tony said, between sniffing, “But if it works out, and we have a healthy baby, then yea…something like that. Or maybe we say we had a surrogate.”
“You…I’m not following.”
And the meal was
“Hospital,” he said simply. Steve’s face blanched and turned to concern, but before he could ask, Tony explained, “Just a check-up, don’t worry.”
“It’s not a massive deal, I just,” Bruce said, a little awkwardly, “I just think we should keep a small eye on him, I mean, I know what’s it like to – to just not to talk to anyone and pretend things are fine and – they’re not.”
Steve didn’t really know what was wrong. Maybe Tony was just in a bad mood recently, maybe it wasn’t brought on by anything specific. That would explain it easily enough, he supposed. But Steve had to worry, that it might be something more.
about people, so that they can feel better themselves, pat themselves on the back, I dunno, but I got some news for you: that’s what makes the world go around.”
The emotions were all in a sort of passed-out state.
if he were able to.
Steve tried to keep his cool.
“Tony. All I want for Christmas is you.”
Tony was on his knees facing the headboard, scrunching up the sheets in his knuckle-grip.
“Are you sure?” Tony said.
“I love you. You’re gonna be a great father, Steve.”
One time, Tony called out to Steve, and Steve had smiled brightly and come over to him, but then it went blurry and fuzzy and he realised it was probably a dream. His mind was getting achy. And when he was awake, he also realised he was in pain in several parts of his body, and he damn hoped they had him on pain meds.
“It’s ok, I’ll stay with him.” Steve’s voice. His deep velvety voice is close, which for some reason made Tony smile. Or want to smile. Or smile in his head – whatever.
Tony slowly let go from the hug and looked at Steve.
Tony groaned as his arm struggled to reach what he was trying to, and his feet left the chair as he tried to pull himself up onto the shelf.
“Drowning?” Rhodey said incredulously, “What the hell? What’s happening?”
Fear was in the middle, drinking his coffee.
“Mr Rogers?”
“I like the old-style waistcoat,” Sadness said, “Reminds me of home.”
The next day, Steve found himself sitting on the beach, drowning in the memories of the war, of what it was like, with bloodied bodies on the beaches, scratching itches as they looked on at the guts floating in the dark waves next to them in the boats. Suddenly he was pulled out of his reverie as Natasha startled him, and flinched, and wiped at his eyes, surprised.
“Ok, well as long as you’re not guilt-laden and you don’t sulk for too long…”
“Focus in, that’s it, FOCUS!” Joy shouted at the screen, where Tony was looking at Steve with a fond expression, a hint of fear and wonder as well, “Somebody sketch him, quickly, I need this face etched into my mind.”
And then they went.
“Yes, it’s imperative to patient confidentiality. He’s in his rights to fire me after this. But I hope he doesn’t.” Sandy turned to leave.

“No, the baby should be quite normal, will look splendidly like both of you fine humans, and as far as I’m aware, she will not be pink. Well, I don’t think so. That might be quite cute. You know, my brother was born blue…”
“Really?” He turned around, frowning, “It would only take a bit longer to get back to-”
“No. I’m going. Teach him the ways of the world, I trust you. I think,” she smiles and gets up, taking her towel with her.
“Tony!” He cried out, not able to stop the panic from blanketing his voice. He saw the door leading outside (more like a hole blown in the wall) and he saw more of the pieces and followed it out into the blinding sun.
“Good try,” Steve panted, “But don’t hold back.”
“While you sit down and work on your therapist’s notes that you said she had for you?” Steve compromised.
Tony looked tired, and was breathing more heavily, but nodded.
“Tony, I-”
Tony was still starting to sniffle, for a different reason. He twisted around in Steve’s hold and buried his head in Steve’s neck.
“The one who was here yesterday. With you. Staying... with you,” Steve said slowly.
“Ok, ok, here,” Steve lifted Tony carefully to his feet, supporting his weight, and helped him back onto the sofa, as he rested there, and put hands on his ever-growing stomach, rubbing it to reassure himself.
“I gotta say, this has made me feel better,” Tony said smugly, two chess rounds later.
“Oh. Right.”
Tony sighed contentedly and leaned back on Steve’s shoulder.
that had been knocked down furiously, with slightly dysfunctional coping mechanisms. One of the things Sandy had said to him while explaining why he was feeling the way he was feeling. Oh, she’s like, a psychiatrist or psychologist as well as a therapist apparently, Tony wasn’t really listening, but boy she knew her stuff. She had explained that he wasn’t a narcissist, but it was a front he had put on over the course of his life to disguise his inner self doubt, etcetera etcetera, and now he was stripped bare and vulnerable and not knowing who to trust.
“We think it will be a caesarean,” Bruce explained, “And as I said, we don’t know how exactly it’s going to play out, but it does seem to be progressing as ‘normal’ as a pregnancy can be, yea.”

stuff.”
Steve thought about it.
But Tony’s form remained unmoving.
Steve whispered in his ear, “Oh baby, it’s cold out-side...”
“I – I’m still confused. When did-” Tony looked for the right way to phrase it.
“You know, I think I've been having an existential crisis lately,” Steve said, looking into the distance, “Like, thinking about my purpose now, and what I want, and I realise that you are a big part of that,” he looked towards Tony, “That I have a team, that I can help people again – it's made me feel more like a home, and even though it might not fill the hole inside me-” he points to his gut to make a point, “-of everyone that I left behind, that life - I can’t go back. I can’t change it. This is my life now, and I realised I need to make the

“Now, Clint, what do you think of that hiking trip I was telling Hill about?” Steve turned towards him.
“Okay then,” Joy said, and Steve lifted his head, taking a deep breath in, nodding to himself. “Wardrobe!”
the time? I mean, most of the time. Not all the time…”
“Me too.” Steve looked to Tony’s lips and leaned in to kiss him, and Tony closed his eyes, lip-locking with Steve like he planned to never let go. Like, ever. A quick breathe in through his nose, and he leaned in deep. Their lips became stuck together, tongues moving slowly, noses bumping. And they had never been more content than being encased in each other; to just
“I know,
Bruce was trying to tell Tony that he could not get the boat out on his own.
At the end of the evening, they then had their first kiss.
“I don’t want you to.”
“By the grace of...” Steve took a step back, holding onto his chest.
“What’s going through that head of yours…?” He said, with a small smile and loving look in his blue eyes.
“I’d expected you to do it sooner, to be honest. Don’t sweat about it,” Tony muttered.
“I have alerted Mr. Rogers, boss,” Friday replied.
“I’ll get some tools, they’re here somewhere. If me and you can’t fix Ikea, no one can.”
“Wait, no – I don’t want the whole world,” Steve protested, getting up, and Tony sighed. “I just want you.”
Tony nodded and warmed internally. He liked their family.
“A million tears lie behind every smile…”
“And if you would tell him of our meeting today, I would be most grateful,” Sandy told him.
Cumulus clouds are the 'typical' ones that you might draw. Bubbly. Can bring rain.
Steve whispered to Tony, “Is a caesarean one of those things that is now much safer and has a much less chance of you dying horrifically during childbirth?” He asked worriedly. Tony smiled affectionately.
“Tell me, Cap’n,” Tony whispered seductively, his eyes hooded looking up to Steve’s which were only a few inches above his, as he smoothed Tony’s back. “Does this feel…bad to you?”
He had thought Natasha might be here to ‘talk’ to him, maybe she knew his intentions or found the gun, but she was content to either read, swim or sleep on the sunbed. Tony found her company quite relaxing. And it really can be said about appreciating aesthetics. The everlasting turquoise sea was beautiful to look out to.
The next morning, after pondering through the night with not much sleep and an energised jog, Steve was relaxing in the kitchen area when an unknown man, looking tired in sleepy clothes came to get some coffee.
Natasha raised her eyebrow at him.
“Bruce, what is it?” Steve sounded scared as he looked over to him from the other side of the bed. Tony felt small lying down between them, and he pressed a touchscreen on his side to higher the bed.
“No. Now, Pepper’s meeting me there for a day to catch up on business stuff. But apart from that, I have a free schedule.”
“What?”
“Crisis averted, everyone, it’s ok!” Fear said, and the others seemed actually relieved.
But Steve was pushing forward. He didn’t seem to listen.
“I don’t know,” Tony answers honestly, and looks at him.
distracting, ok?”
Tony started, “Why…”
“Uh. Yea.” Steve rolled off him, and Tony stretched and slowly stood back up, checking his wing. “D-did I hurt you? Your wing? I know it’s, er, mechanically built but-”
“It’s not fair how he’s been treated, don’t you see, Joy? He deserves this, he deserves happiness, to be treated right, and dammit I will treat him right!”
Steve had a disconcerting thought.
“They told me I’ve been in a coma for like three weeks. Felt like it, too.”
Tony choked at the word ‘hiking’.
“But they don’t fit,” Tony’s voice cracked, and he blinked his eyes a few times. “I mean, this is only gonna get worse a-and-”
Tony sits down heavily on the patchy grass ground helplessly. Steve carefully sits beside him.
“Look, Steve, we can probably ignore this, OK? I’m sorry, but I don’t think I’m the guy for you. You have the whole world. Go have fun.” Tony patted Steve’s shoulder, and began walking away.
Steve kisses back gently and experimentally at first, and then just can’t help putting it all into it, taking a breath and connecting with Tony’s luscious lips passionately, as his other hand took hold of Tony’s waist, so Tony was wrapped warmly in his arms.
“I, hate, you, all,” She said with each throw.
,” he whispered back with a determination.
“Steve, listen to me,” he landed roughly in front of the captain, who seemed to be quite determined.
Steve looked down, and then into Tony’s eyes again, and leaned closer to smell his musk.
“It’s ok.”
“What? I know the drill! Smile, a lot, laugh at his jokes, compliment him, talk about happy things, relish in his joyful smile-”
“What is it?” Steve asked.
Steve looked very pale, and kept glancing through the window.
. They both get naked soon enough, and the room is dark, and Tony is climbing all over Steve, whispering in a rush about needing more lube, and Steve is all over it, he just slathers it over his dick, moaning weakly, and smooths it inside Tony’s ass, most common sense having gone out the window. Tony still kisses him ferociously and mercilessly, and Steve’s a hell of a competitor too, but Tony has to remind himself to breathe since oxygen is something he still needs, apparently. Tony props himself on top of Steve, he’s ready for the burn, welcoming it, relishing the feeling of Steve inside of him, steadying himself on Steve’s
Through his panic he didn’t really register the pain, but saw the light beaming out of Tony’s hand as he beamed full power on Steve’s chest, sending him flying far backwards in extraordinary speed. Steve reached out to him but it was too late.
Tony could tell something was on his mind, and while he couldn’t really be bothered, he reluctantly asked, “Something up, C-Steve?”
“I…can’t discuss my patient’s details, Mr Rogers,” she said.
“Right,” He said, looking at Tony’s dishevelled look and slight goldfish expression. How did he make that handsome?
“…Yep.”
“Uh, the truth would be nice,” Tony says indignantly.
Yep. They had sex. Tony and this man had sex. Maybe they even did it more than once. Maybe they do it a lot.
Tony smiled at the display. “No, not yet.”
Some part of him wasn’t really listening, her voice was kind of soothing to his ears though as he sifted through the foggy haze of his mind. It was full of maybes, and tiredness, and resignation.
“Might as well,” Bruce said, sighing. Tony looked baffled, but Bruce won his way through in the end. They were alone for the moment, as Tony knew Steve would only freak if he thought something was wrong with him. Which obviously, there was. Damn aliens.
a million tears rather.
He could hear them more clearly now. His chest hurt and there were throbbing pains throughout his stomach, at least he thinks it’s there anyway; his throat is uncomfortably filled with a tube, so everything’s touch and go. He tried to wiggle his toes. He thought he did, and he got excited, but he heard voices around him, and they still sounded glum, and far away, and he’d assumed he probably hadn’t moved, otherwise they would have got excited.
Anyway, Tony’s mood and spirits seemed to get slightly better in the next few weeks. Steve was glad, and pleased that Tony had been sleeping better and was less annoyed by him. They still argued sometimes – just not as heatedly, and Steve really felt quite good about it.
“Yea, that’s perfectly natural, Steve, ok? You don’t have to feel like you have to fit in 100% with – well, this century. Anything you need my help with?” Tony doubted it.

“It – it was just – I’m sorry, I think it was a nightmare and I must have acted out-” Steve was trying to explain while Tony was staring at said bed, in the room of his villa that Steve had been occupying.

Then Tony was down on the ground as Steve ran towards him, and he knocked the enemy soldier out the way with a hard throw of his shield.
“…And don’t
“Yes! I know exactly what to do!”
“She’s a miracle,” Tony agreed, “She’s perfect, and she’s already our biggest hero.”
“Tony-” Steve managed to say, “What is it? Are you alright? God, I did-didn’t mean to, it-it was too much.” He raked a hand across his face. “Tony, talk to me. Please.” He felt so bad, he wanted to
“Tony, what is…going on?” Steve asked, frowning as he came closer to him.
“Uh…Okay,” Tony said, blinking fast.
“Ok, well I don’t know, ok? I just
“Um, what?”
“Aw…”
A few weeks later the bubble of Thor and the troublemaker alien had died down, and now it was just Steve and Tony again, enjoying their alone time together in the tower.
“What man?”
Steve was glad that Tony also wanted to see him again. He kissed him again, and Tony smiled, gratefully received. And a little voice in his head kept telling him to wrap it up, cause boy this woody ain’t going down any time soon. So he said goodnight, and Tony said goodnight, with a goodnight kiss, which only made matters worse, and high-tailed it out of there as fast as he could without raising suspicion.
That wasn’t the only day Tony was particularly emotional. Pregnancy was somewhat a rollercoaster for him. Particularly as this seemed to be the first time a man on Earth had been impregnated by a pink alien. But then again, who knows.
I’ve been more tired lately, and- and- achoo! Achoo!” Tony sneezed.
He’s bound to slip up some time though.
Tony groaned.
“I have no idea how that works, but yea,” Steve smiles. It really is amazing. Like a magic trick. In the middle of the metal hand it has a beamer. All in all, very handy in self-defence.
“Oh.”
Steve went back to his training schedule, and then hit the books again. He was currently reading about the ‘revolution of the mobile phone’. He thought it was pretty interesting. And he definitely needed to read about modern diseases and medicine, just to reassure himself once again.
Tony nodded, looking morose.
“What’s optimism?” Sadness asked glumly.
Does he catastrophise? Hell yes.
“Steve, I’m not gonna let yourself get killed!” Tony said angrily through his suit, stepping in front as he turned around and put a hand on Steve’s chest to stop him going further, Steve flaring his nostrils stubbornly.
“I don’t know, but I don’t care,” Tony smiled, and looked around, then back to his best friend, “So? Will you?”
“Nah, I was just kidding, but I wanted to know what your answer would be.”
“Now THAT is why we don’t have you in charge, Joy.”
“That’s one of the things I like about you…” Steve said back, smiling.
“Alright people, let’s go through the motions.”
He listened carefully; the only sounds being the crickets, and then he heard sniffles. He decided to stay there for a while.
“Good, I’ll take that as a yes.”
“I know.”
“If I – could – only – press the – optimism-” Joy struggled, but Anger was holding her back. All the emotions had been against her being in control for a
The funny thing is, no one has noticed. No one knows what Tony is. It’s easy enough to hide. Tony can get his hands on blood easily, especially animal blood. He doesn’t need to go outside a lot and can explain the rashes and burns on his skin as a newly developed sun allergy (he spent a lot of time in the sun, during those three months, you see.) He masters his gag reflex and sits through dinners, vomiting everything back up the moment he gets the chance.
“No, you aren’t.”
“I didn’t—yeah.”
“Now that I think of it, you never told me how exactly this half came here. You were trying to cast the spell, weren’t you? Don’t you know that John Donne’s poems are dangerous?”
“The curse from the Witch of the Waste has finally caught up with me.”
Jarvis told him that Stark liked the freedom of not being part of any association or guild. He wanted to be able to live where he wanted, do what he wanted, and help those he wanted to help. He had chosen the port town, Porthaven, because it was one of the towns with the most people in need. All these poor people who Stark undercharged, they wouldn’t be alive if he hadn’t given them healing spells and food when he’d first arrived in town.
There’s a kind of vague disinterest in Steve’s eyes. “Since the first time I died, huh. Makes sense.”
The Illuminati are the only ones that even remotely qualify to be part of that exclusive little group. But, well, Tony doesn't want to spend more time than strictly necessary with those gloomy heralds of doom. He can't stand them. Why don't they live a little, instead of agonising over blowing up one planet or two?
Inside, the castle was slowly crumbling, the paint on the walls peeling off, the bricks turning to dust, the walls caving in. Tony was still dying. What was he supposed to do?
Natasha-voice chimed in. She might have had a point.
There was also the fact that if Stark were focused on keeping his curse at bay, he would spend less time with Natasha and miss O’Casta, which was always good.
“Th—thank you, Jarvis.”
But Tony was already convulsing, the marks spreading over his whole body, until his skin was covered by their black mass. He jerked silently, then fell limp. Across from him, Jarvis cried out as his flame died. The only part left of him was his core, black as coal, a very faint blue glow the only sign that he was alive.
“If you want something from the mantelpiece, tell me, and I’ll bring it to you. Don’t come closer.”
Tony was, for the first time since Steve had met him, an honest man.
He started walking back to Pott’s shop, the address having changed once more, now glowing the familiar blue of Tony’s magic. He took his time, trying to think of a way of telling Tony about the failure of his mission. What could he say to soften the blow? He didn’t have any excuses. What would Tony think? He’d asked Steve specifically to convince the King not to appoint him as the court sorcerer, and Steve had managed to achieve the opposite. The King had seen right through his words, twisting and bending them until they said the contrary of what Steve tried to say. The King had seen that Steve hadn’t meant the bad things about Tony, and Steve had even helped the former by complimenting Tony like a fool.
They’d made it. It was over.
“Where is he going, anyway? Why is he always so eager to leave this place?”
They stayed side by side for a long while, looking at the flowers and the Waste looming behind. Tony was deep in thoughts, his frequent rubbing of his chest betraying what he was thinking about. Steve, for his part, was processing what both Tony and Jarvis had told him. Tony had used the same words as Potts when he described how Janet had turned into the Witch of the Waste. They’d both talked about a corruption of her heart. Was this what was happening to Tony? The marks did originate from the centre of his chest, near where his heart was.
“Truce?”
“Come on, Shellhead, this is Mr. Stark, there’s no way around it. He looks like him, he knows Rhodey, this is him. I’ll go fetch Thor.” Cap took a few steps towards the door, but stopped when Iron Man noisily dropped himself in a chair. Cap immediately turned around and crouched down next to Iron Man, putting them at eye-level. He murmured, achingly soft: “What’s wrong, Shellhead? We can figure this out, it’s going to be ok.”
Wait. He
Tony crouched down, carefully holding his hand out for the weredog to sniff. Which happened without problem. Was the man’s animosity for Tony gone? When had that happened?
times, half of which he doesn’t even remembers. He can’t let the panic rise, because otherwise he won’t be able to concentrate on anything other than that number and the growing litany of whys.
Iron Man made a peculiar noise, a bit as if he was choking.
Steve startled at the laugh.
Steve’s gut sank like a stone when he saw that the creatures that were screaming and crawling around the rock were mermaids.
“Oh, that’s nice. Natasha won’t have to pretend, then. Or should I say that you’ll be the only one that’ll have to pretend, now? Pretend that you’re actually interested in courting miss O’Casta, when you’re so worried about the Witch of the Waste that you can’t keep your hand off your chest?”
The human skull, was that what he was looking for? Could it be a metaphor for his death, or his human part that was dead now that he was a scarecrow? Anyhow, it wouldn’t hurt Tony to give over that skull.
Steve doesn’t reply. Instead, he turns and glances meaningfully between Tony and the clock.
“I got a message from the King. He wants me to find Strange. I mean, he’s always wanted that, but now he wants me to actually do something. So, yeah. I’m going to see if I can find him. Make myself useful until the end, I guess. I’ll be back.”
But there was still the matter of the skull on the mantel of the fireplace. And the disappearances, and how Stark had been seen with one of the victims. Not to mention the coincidence of the appearance of the castle and the missing men and women.
Stark was outright grinning now, looking between Steve and the frying pan as if he was imagining the scene.
“She wanted my memories, wanted to know everything about the blond man Stark was looking for. Wan—wanted to know about Steve Rogers. She shocked them out of my brain, her stingers, the electricity, it was—”
“I wouldn’t want to presume. Please call me Mr. Rogers. Tony isn’t here, he left a few hours ago, is it urgent? I can tell him you went by and asked for him.”
“And maybe, when Stark comes back, I’ll tell him about your request. I bet he’d be happy to learn that his fire demon wants to escape.”
He doesn’t deserve this, yet this is what he gets. It’s a cruel joke.
They were in love, Tony realized. They were in love with each other, but they didn’t know the feelings were reciprocated.
Steve didn’t know what to say.
“You were in a
He couldn’t let it happen. He couldn’t allow it. He needed to protect Tony’s heart, needed to save it.
. They really were following a pattern.
Tony's a god.
It sounded almost too good to be true. Tony was essentially promising Steve that they would work together for the foreseeable future, they could even live together—not like
in Steve?
Cap’s eyebrows rose to his hairline.
And if, if Tony wasn’t interested in O’Casta, and if his words earlier were heartfelt, and if Steve remembered correctly that they’d both leaned in, then, well, there was a small, tiny,
More beautiful, too. His new hair colour suited him even better than the colour he’d had before. It added a touch of lightness, almost. His eyes were the same as always, though. Hard behind a gentle exterior. Steve wondered what Stark was thinking.
He’s not here for that, however. He forces his gaze away from the sex dream in front of him and changes quickly. When he looks up again, he catches Steve staring at his back. Tony smirks to himself. Good to know the attraction isn’t entirely one-sided. He might have some fun with Steve after all.
Wasn’t this what Tony wanted, just a few days ago? Wasn’t this what he begged Steve to do? Wasn’t this what was supposed to happen? Tony’s always had a martyr complex, everyone’s told him so. It’s only fitting that he die like this. He wonders what the papers will say tomorrow. Will they say something about enemies reunited in death? Will they try to turn this into the ultimate sacrifice for liberty? Will they…
“Oh, he thought I would believe that? Everyone could see you’re not his cousin, if anything, you’re his type—but that isn’t important. So he sent you, huh? That jerk. Just you wait Stark, see if I’ll let you get away with that.”
The hand on his shoulder has him opening them again. Steve has lost the smile. He shakes Tony a little.
familiar.
Tony immediately sat down on the ground before the weredog, petting him this time. Steve sat down on the other side of the weredog, feeling a little weird about a man petting a man, even if he was in the shape of a dog.
Stark was a liar, and a coward. Why was he hiding behind masks?
Tony tries to talk, tries to move, but his limbs won’t cooperate, and his helmet is so damaged that the mics don’t work anymore. His vision blurs and greys as Steve punches and punches and punches and
Steve clears his throat, takes a few steps forward into Tony’s space. He’s within touching distance now, and Tony would only need an instant to sink his teeth in Steve’s neck. Their eyes are locked as Steve reveals what he’s been hiding behind his back. It’s stupidly, endearingly romantic: in his hand, there is a single rose.
Steve becoming Nomad never really surprised Tony. He’s so attached to his freedom, his ideals are so strong, that he was bound to be disappointed in the government one day or another. What really surprised Tony, however, is that Steve never went back to being Captain America.
After two hours of opening door after door, Steve accepted that there wasn’t, in fact, any end to the castle. But only some of the uncountable rooms were lived in. There was the kitchen, a bedroom, a bathroom—and hadn’t that been a horrible surprise, when what he first thought was an unused and grimy closet had turned out to be a
This isn’t anything different. The wolf can be a lamb’s best friend. Steve and Tony’s friendship is all the more piquant because there might be a lion hiding underneath the sheep’s wool. Tony won’t know until it’s too late to disengage.
The only reason Tony can come up with is that Steve’s unconscious wasn’t happy with only killing Tony once, and that it will stop when Steve’s rage has been assuaged. He doesn’t voice that thought.
He won’t survive the night if he stays outside.
The shadow is there again, black on black, a glint of yellow in the streetlights. It doesn’t move from where it’s immobile on the other side of the street. There’s nothing to see here, Tony thinks. Just an empty street and a wino on a bench.
Steve gaped as the King didn’t even bother to hide his smile.
He didn’t want to believe it, didn’t want to accept that she had changed his body, his very being, into this shadow of what he should be. He wouldn’t be able to do anything like this, he realised. He wouldn’t have the strength to help in the docks, he wouldn’t have the lungs to walk all the way to the bakery in the little free time he had. No one would recognise him, they would ask after Steve, and what would he say? What could he even say? They wouldn’t believe him, they would chase him out, and he’d have nowhere to go.
“It hasn’t come to that. Yet. We were lucky, Steve, really lucky. We had the gauntlet, and then the next earths were already dead, or got destroyed before we could do anything. We haven’t had to kill a planet yet, and I hope with all my being that it’ll never come to that, but we’re running out of options. Everywhere we turn, it’s another dead end. All others who know about the incursions keep telling us this is hopeless, that
“I’m sorry, I didn’t think. I’m just so confused about the money. How does he live in such luxury with that little amount of income? Is he from a wealthy or noble family?”
He strained all he could against the armour, bringing his head back as violently as he could. It was enough to startle the armour into loosening its hold. Steve kicked himself free and dived for his shield. Jocasta whirled around, the heart still in her hand, and spit a stream of fire towards Steve. He managed to hide behind the shield, the heat so intense that he could feel his hair curl.
Oh. So that was why he’d been so sure that Tony wasn’t Tony. God, they looked so alike. Apart from the weird hairstyle and moustache, they could be identical twins. No wonder that Cap had been so sure that Tony was his Tony.
“I’m…I’m very sorry, I thought you were trying to break in.”
He felt a little silly talking to an inanimate object (although this one wasn’t so inanimate), but he figured someone had to be in control of the thing.
Sweat drops in Tony’s eye. He has minutes, maybe seconds, left, and he’s thinking about papers and public opinion. There is no future for him anymore, not this time. This isn’t a cosmic event, he isn’t the victim of a reality-rewriting villain. He’s going to bleed out on top of Steve, and they’ll both be gone.
He would have to start with the bathroom, he decided, if only because he would have to use it as well. He’d take one of the empty rooms to sleep in. But before that, he wanted to ventilate the castle. He went to the door and opened it, staggering back when he was met with the hustle and bustle of a busy street.
Steve noticed that the backrest was groaning under his clenched hands. He released it, surprised when he saw that the wood was slightly cracked. Was the chair less sturdy than it looked?
He thought back to the first words Tony had ever uttered to him.
Tony’s never seen Steve this angry before.
Tony's better than that, now. He's cut ties with everyone not interesting enough, not challenging enough to deserve to be in the same room as him.
“I need to go, I need—I need some air.”
Was Stark trying to
“You smacked a scarecrow with a frying pan? Wow. That, uh, that must have been exhausting. Good job, by the way, thank you for protecting my castle.”
He opened it carefully again, just a little, and observed the hills through the slit.
(See the end of the chapter for
That could be a reason. And it would also explain the haste with which Tony had left to see her.
Steve’s trying to say something.
He blinks, and Steve aims at his chest instead, likely to pin him to the ground. Just as he brings his arms down, one of the iron men is flung into his back, and he falls, and the edge of the shield slices neatly through Tony’s throat.
He got to the bathroom just as the shadows reached the top of the staircase, slithering along the floor, hissing softly. It took two tries to get Stark into the bathtub, but as soon as the warm water touched his skin, the slime started evaporating, the shadows with it. After a minute, the yellowish steam surrounding Stark was gone, along with any trace of the slime. Stark was himself again, sat in the water, his lower half obscured by the murky water—for which Steve was infinitely grateful. It hadn’t exactly been easy to do all that without catching a glimpse of something… private—Stark was himself again, but there were notable differences. His hair, of course, was one of them. Where it had been pitch-black, it was now a dark brown with a golden glint. His skin was different, too. Less silky smooth, more marred. His hands were scarred, small nicks and cuts and burns. He had small scars everywhere on his body, even across one of his eyebrows. It was barely visible, but it was there, where there had been nothing but skin half an hour ago.
Twenty seconds of a real hug.
It worked. They bristled and stepped towards him, the girl forgotten.
He was not thinking about it.
“I can’t tell you. I’m sorry, I would like to, but…”
“I was picking flowers to put in the shop.”
Steve’s voice is dangerous, and it promises a world of pain and regrets. Tony wants to laugh at that, that Steve thinks he has any kind of control of this situation, when it’s so far out of his hands.
Did—did Jarvis say.
As soon as Steve said it, he knew he wanted it, to have colourful flowers in the shop, to have the lovely scents permeate the space.
When he’s in the workshop, he takes care to disengage every part of the armour except for his right gauntlet. The blood on it hasn’t even dried yet. If he tilts his hand, there’s a faint glimmer, the slightest hint that there is something coating the deep red of the armour. To the naked eye, it might look like water. But the liquid is too thick, and the darkening of the wet parts of the gauntlet betray that it’s blood. Tony should wash the gauntlet, disinfect it, burn it. He can’t leave highly classified super-soldier DNA on his suit.
His darkest secret? His most heartfelt love declaration? Does he offer his forgiveness? Does he absolve the ones who wronged him?
“13th of December, 1942.”
He clenched his fists, his breathing picking up, his muscles bunching and tensing as he felt the anger sweep over him. But just as quick as he’d felt the rage strengthen him, he deflated, as he caught a glimpse of himself in the nearest window. It was ridiculous, really. He shrank down into himself again. She was dangerous, her magic abilities maybe higher than Tony’s, and even if she didn’t have any magic, she would still be able to fight him off, with the body he had. He wasn’t strong enough. He was just a weak little man, who couldn’t even help his friends properly. He gritted his teeth and walked away.
Steve looked up at Tony, who averted his gaze, cheeks rosy. Had he exerted himself by doing the spell?
Under the blazing hot sun, he ran.
Unfortunately, Steve knew it wasn’t a dream, because he didn’t have the imagination to come up with all that. Which meant he had to answer Stark.
Tony and the Witch were fighting in the air, both injured, although Tony was in a far worse state than her. She was in her wasp-like form again, this time as big as Tony. He was mostly human, but his arms had turned into wings, and he had more feathers than bare skin.
He could bring life to objects. He could will his shield to follow his command. He just needed to
She smiled, and Steve feared the worst. What if she’d killed him, or banished him to a dark realm, or corrupted him?
He’s just a sore loser, Tony reminds himself. He was hurt and he lashed out.
“Mind if I join you? I’m ravenous.”
, he doesn’t think.
Steve, who is silent, mouth twitching, eyes turbulent. He’s having a hard time accepting what Tony’s saying. His voice is rough when he answers:
Tony hopped down from his shoulders, spreading his wings and flying unsteadily to the ground, where he collapsed. Steve rushed forward as he transformed back into his human form, unconscious.
Stark was already walking into the forest, but he stopped when he saw that Steve wasn’t catching up. He waited until Steve was walking alongside with him to continue. After a short walk, they arrived at the village. It was picturesque, the small houses painted in pale but cosy colours. Stark’s palms were glowing blue, he was most likely searching for the magic source of the spell.
Then the moment passes, and he remembers he’s a pathetic waste of a man, that he’s not worth saving. He had it all, and he threw it down the drain all the same, and he knows Steve is only there to make sure that he doesn’t do something dangerous like flying in the suit. As if he could. He’s not Iron Man anymore.
“I thought that since I have so little time to live, I could make the best out of it. What, don’t you approve of my ways of dealing with my impending death?”
Steve couldn’t stop from hoping, could he? It surprised even himself, that he tried to be optimistic all the time, when his whole life had proven him wrong.
Tony doesn’t know what to think about that.
Someone else is running towards Steve, a dark blur with the unmistakable metallic sheen of a gun in their hand. Here to finish the job, Tony understands. It was all a set-up, they’d planned for this, Tony never even suspected—
There is no forgiving this time, not from Steve. Whatever they had has shattered irreparably.
He didn’t turn his head, or even shout back, but he started directing the fight lower. Bit by bit, they descended, until they were nearly at ground level. It was still moving very fast, but Steve could keep up with them now, he was strong and quick enough for that. He jumped between the two just as the Witch directed one of her electric rays at Tony. The ray bounced back and hit her in the chest. She howled, convulsing, and Steve ran to Tony. He was barely standing now, every inch of his skin covered in scales or feathers now. His breathing was ragged, but he batted Steve’s hands away when he tried to support him, or at least give him a hand.
“Iron Man, you told me this morning that Mr. Stark was gone on a business trip to California. Even if he could just drop everything and come over, it would take him hours. Why won’t you believe that someone messed with him and dumped him here? He’s right here!”
Steve needed to—
“This isn’t a
Tony can’t tell Steve that he doesn’t want to look at the files from that time.
Steve decided that he didn’t want to lie to the King.
Stark wanted Steve to see the King at once, then.
“The message has been received. Release the messenger.”
Of course, that only meant that Steve had to open it. He was met with absolute darkness. It was suffocating, seeping into the castle through the open door, wrapping around Steve. It wanted him to step into it, so that it could swallow him whole, and it took every bit of his willpower to resist the temptation. He closed the door forcefully, taking several steps back, breathing hard.
The dog was sitting on the side, looking intently, ears raised and eyes sharp. Jarvis, on the other hand, was glowing feebly, pulsing weakly, his flame the smallest Steve had ever seen. What had happened to him? He had enough logs to consume, so food wasn’t the issue. He looked
Tony stopped pacing, looking at the door.
isn’t.
“She found me! Jarvis, the armour, be ready, I need to—”
The silence goes on as Steve’s breathing grows heavier and Tony retreats far into his body, ready to take a beating.
He stared in horror as the full implications of what he’d just heard dawned on him.
He couldn’t continue like this, he should send a letter to Natasha, apologise for not telling her. Maybe James would agree to carry the letter to her. Why was he here, anyways? He still hadn’t told Steve. Was there something else he needed to say? Or was he hiding from the Witch? Wasn’t Shield safe enough? It had to be safer than the home of the man that was being hunted by the Witch, anyhow.
And, well, the problem was, he really was Tony Stark. So he decided to tell them, briefly, about the key, Pepper and Rhodey, and the teleportation, which led to the question, where was he?
“I’m good, Jarvis, just didn’t think that her fire demon would be quite so powerful. I see you’re feeling better too. Now, what was I talking about…”
They kept at it for a while, devising crazier and crazier theories about Tony, half of the words they used foreign to him. When they had gone through their frankly ridiculously long list of possible ways this wasn’t really Tony (for Iron Man’s part) or how Tony would have lost his memories (for Cap’s part), they nodded at each other, and turned as one towards Tony.
“Good evening! Would you be amenable to stop and let me in?”
No tricky feelings. No worrying thoughts. Nothing.
The moment he was out of the gate, the armour reassembled itself, Jarvis apologizing softly for the abrupt disappearance, Steve reassuring him that it wasn’t a problem, and thanking him for the help.
He swallowed, looking at Steve again, his face pale, and Steve’s heart stuttered. He hadn’t forgotten that almost-kiss, hadn’t forgotten how Tony had looked at him. Could it be…
Steve didn’t like the woman’s smile. It was too sharp.
And Tony had decided to move right next to it? Did he
He hadn’t taken the time to draw in so long.
A few months wasn’t a long time, but if anyone could break the curse, surely Stark could.
“Of course I do! You can never be too careful with men like him. I hear he bewitches every beautiful young man or woman he comes across. They fall in love with him instantly, and follow him back to his castle, and then he rips their heart out of their chest and eats it. I told my daughter to keep her older children off the streets after nightfall, and you should do the same.”
“This ends now, Tony. I’m bringing you in, and you’re going to tell me everything you know, and then the Illuminati will have to face the consequences of what you’ve done. No more special treatments. Hah. I should have made good on that promise the first time, instead of giving you the benefit of the doubt. I can’t
How much time before the Witch knocked on the door?
Tony’s relieved laugh was the best thing Steve had heard in his life. The only way this could be better was if they kissed right here, right now.
Behind him, Steve sighs, shifts, puts a knee on the bed. Tony registers the dip in the mattress, the warmth seeping through the sheets. He waits for a hand on his shoulder, waits for fingers on his hip, a tug to turn him over and end his hiding away. Instead, Steve lies down behind him. He makes himself comfortable above the sheets, lightly nuzzles into Tony’s neck. They’re not quite touching. A feather-light breath, a barely-there cloth is all that’s between them.
The curse? Was Stark cursed as well? It couldn’t be the same curse as Steve’s, could it?
As soon as he’d said the words, Steve fell into a deep slumber.
Piece of cake.
broke up with
Why does Steve want to kill him instead of trying to figure out this time loop?
“You have some paint on you. I could, if you want…?”
Stark vigorously shook his head, eyes fixed on Tony’s chest as he closed the plate again.
The hills around him morphed, took on a distinctly orange hue, which morphed into green and ultimately blue. Steve wasn’t in the hills anymore. The castle wasn’t behind him, Jarvis was gone, and he was walking in shallow water, looking up at the starry sky, wind blowing in his hair.
Tony sat down heavily, and while he helped himself to an apple and coffee, Steve tried to smell the air as subtly as he could. Tony wasn’t smelling like alcohol, which was a relief. He wasn’t smelling like anything but himself, and soot and grime. What had he done during the night? Had he still been looking for a cure?
Steve had been so sure that Tony had stopped with his courting when he’d realised that the curse had caught up with him, but he couldn’t be sure, could he. Maybe O’Casta had been worried because she hadn’t seen Tony in a while? Was she developing feelings for him? Had he managed to pique her interest?
What happens when an idealist is faced with a hopeless situation? When, whatever he does, it’s so far out of his hands that he can only helplessly watch as the world burns around him?
They were completely focused on each other, paying no mind to the frightened guards on the docks that were ordering them to cease their fight immediately and surrender.
He propels himself against Tony, and they crash into the wall, Steve’s eyes boring into Tony’s as his skull cracks against the reinforced steel. Steve’s screaming in his face, but he can’t hear him, and one of his eyes doesn’t work anymore, and there’s something sticky oozing into his hair and neck, and his legs give out at the same time Steve’s expression shifts from furious to confused. He doesn’t register falling to the ground, because he can’t see anymore, and then he can’t feel, and then he can’t think.
“I would love to.”
That would bring Tony closer to Steve, wouldn’t it?
He hadn’t meant to say that out loud. He suspected Potts had something to do with this.
There was also the matter of what the man had said. Tony had been looking for Steve? But why? It didn’t make any sense.
Tony doesn’t recognise this Steve. He’d never supersede justice like this. He’d at least give Tony a chance, wouldn’t he? Or has he already decided that what Tony did is a capital offence?
Because Steve loved Tony. There was no denying it now, Steve was in love with Tony, had been for a long time. And it was only now that he’d realised it.
He curls up into a ball, tries to will the unwelcome tears away. There’s no reason for him to be crying like a pathetic little wretched thing, but here he is, nonetheless.
. This man has a bigger rack than half of the women Tony's fucked-- but the eyes are all wrong. Where they were ocean-blue, they're now icy cold. Any warmth is gone. The only way to get any heat from those eyes would be to come too close to Steve and suffer ice-burn.
The next morning, after a lot of clanking and banging, Stark was finally done. Steve heard him practically run up the stairs, carrying a disk-like object in his hands. Stark entered the kitchen, breathing hard, his cheeks flushed, his eyes twinkling despite the dark bags under them, his hair messy, wearing a sleeveless shirt and loose pants. He had soot on his hands, and small burns on his shirt. His arms were on full display, and Steve couldn’t help lingering on the well-defined curve of his biceps and forearms. The muscles in his chest and arms were bunching and shifting from carrying the object, reminding Steve of exactly how strong Stark was.
The man took a step forward, the hum in his hands getting louder.
When he went downstairs the next morning, Jarvis was his old self again, burning happily, crunching on a piece of wood. Seeing him like this, you wouldn’t know he was a hundred times more powerful than a simple flame. Steve made coffee, put a few eggs to fry, and started cutting slices of bread and cheese for the breakfast.
They stood up straighter, Steve with a hopeful smile blooming, Iron Man with his fists clenched.
“You were walking around in Brooklyne, thinking about my shop, and…” he prompted.
What were those scars? They looked nefarious, almost poisonous. And Stark hadn’t had those when he’d stormed out of the bathroom earlier. Which meant that this was most likely the reason that Stark had cast this spell on himself. Not to hide his hair colour, or his small scars, but to hide the serious scarring on his chest.
Tony wasn’t beating around the bush, for once, even mentioning his failed attempt at courting Steve. He had a point, unfortunately. In those first few weeks, Steve hadn’t trusted him, had thought the worst of him. He’d even been happy that Tony didn’t seem to recognise him, because he’d been half afraid that Tony would eat his heart in retribution. It still didn’t excuse Tony, though. They had gotten along much better after a while, and Tony had had many opportunities to tell him, instead of keeping yet another secret.
“Quite a lot, some of which I would not care to repeat.”
He could only watch as they pursued their deadly dance in the air, one of them occasionally flying right into the other’s path, making the air vibrate with the amount of magic that was being discharged.
Tony then asked Steve to sit on the chair and grab on to it. Steve did as told, suddenly excited to see what Tony was going to do. Tony walked over to the fireplace, taking a silver shovel into his hand, and gently pushed it underneath Jarvis. The fire demon was flickering wildly, his usually bright red flames shifting to orange, white and finally a pale blue glow as he was lifted from the fireplace. He had two small claws gripping the edges of the shovel, almost melting it in his distress.
Steve cuts off his internal rambling: “You listen to what I say, you do as I want, and you don’t lie. If you even think of omitting something or bullshitting, all bets are off.”
The look on her face was earnest, but Steve didn’t know Potts, and he felt Stark’s condition wasn’t his secret to tell.
—how could Stark live in such conditions, he wondered—some halls, and then there was a door with a gleaming handle but battered wood that wouldn’t open no matter how hard Steve pushed or pulled. He’d given up on opening that door after he realised that was most likely where Stark cast secret spells or did even worse things. Steve was just relieved that he hadn’t stumbled upon any corpses.
The sound of running steps had Tony shifting his focus towards the door.
to be cleaned. Well, Stark could say anything he wanted, but there was no way that Steve was using that pigsty of a bathroom before cleaning it. So he had waited until Stark had left for another one of his “meetings” before hurrying up to the bathroom. Jarvis had tried dissuading him, but when Steve set his mind on something, he followed through.
Tony laughed, delighted.
The hairs on the back of Tony’s neck rise.
The marks were still on Tony’s chest.
Which was still a step further than Tony had come. He unbuttoned his shirt and showed the mangled mess of his chest. He opened the plate, baring his heart to Stark, and Cap, who’d decided to blithely ignore their privacy. They both paled, Cap choking out:
Steve can touch him. He can touch Steve. He doesn’t have much time.
He was lying face up in the grassy hills, the castle a steady presence behind him.
The voice that greeted Jarvis was familiar, and when Steve saw the man, he stiffened.
(or maybe one of you wants to draw or write something in this universe? because I'd love to see it!)
Maybe that was why he let Steve live with him, to have someone else in his house. Steve could understand that feeling. And he wouldn’t judge Stark on what he chose to do with his last months. If he wanted to chase after pretty people, let him do it. It wouldn’t hurt Steve anyways.
“Jarvis! We made it!”
“Why aren’t you saying anything?” Steve explodes and grabs Tony by the collar. “Got nothing to say? Where are all the pretty lies now?
“I don’t know, I don’t remember.”
He lets trembling hands wrap around Steve’s wrists. Steve’s still staring at him.
The hills would be best, he thought, because he could walk down to Brooklyne and take a horse cab to Shield from there. It wasn’t that far, and he had the money required, since Stark payed him for the household duties and the shop keeping. If he left immediately after the wizard, he would be able to get back in just under two days.
Hi! Thank you for your comments, I love every single one of them, but life's been hectic lately, so I haven't had the time to sit down and answer to them yet. I promise I will!
The key! Between the excitement of learning about science and the relief of having a possible cure for his heart, Tony had temporarily forgotten about it. He fished the key out of his trousers, and, true enough, the electric blue light was back, growing stronger by the seconds. Tony thought about letting the key go, but this was his best chance at going back to his reality. If the key didn’t send him into another reality, that was. He chuckled nervously.
Tony came in soon after, his clothes rumpled, his eyes bloodshot, his steps fumbling. Had he…had he been drinking? On what was possibly his last night day on Earth? Had he given up?
This was…this was important. Something important was happening, Steve could feel it in the way his heart was beating faster, in the heat rising up his cheeks and ears, in his stuttered breathing.
“Who are you? Where am I?”
“Hi, can you tell us how you got here?”
“Should I be worried, Cap? Are you going to steal one of my armours?”
With the ice, the numbing film was gone from his mind.
He wouldn’t be able to stand it. He’d ask Steve for the coup de grâce, right in the middle of the crowd. Anything but indifference. Anything but emptiness where a decade of their lives should lie.
Steve doesn't know it yet, but he's invited the lion into his den. He thinks he's got Tony. He thinks he'll break him. He probably thinks Tony's despairing at seeing him in Hydra colours. On the contrary, it just makes the challenge better. Tony will have fun snapping Steve in two. He's always been good at lying, always been good at pretending. He can act the crushed weakling for a little while. Just long enough for him to carve himself a place into this world, and destroy Steve's plans.
There wouldn’t be any more talking this night, Steve knew.
Steve frogmarches Tony out of the workshop, and Tony pretends the words don’t hurt worse than his dislocated shoulder.
It didn’t take long before a man entered the garden. He was tall, clad in shining black leather, an impressive cape billowing behind him as he walked. He had a scowl on his face, the lines etched deep in his dark skin. He wore an eyepatch covering a sizable scar.
Tony hopes that Steve will let him talk, this time. He shuts down his suits, all his safety measures. Steve should be here any second now. Tony sits himself on the ground, making himself as non-threatening as possible, and hopes Steve won’t kill him as soon as he enters the workshop. The door is open, the lights are on.
Had Tony—had he left to go and see O’Casta? He’d been scared of the Witch, and instead of working on some way to keep her away, he’d gone to his latest infatuation?
The armour wasn’t the only point of interest, either. Tony took care to observe the various rooms and hallways they crossed on their way to the laboratory. What he saw was unsettling: when the interior wasn’t creepily reminiscent of his own mansion (minus the interesting artifacts and taxidermy mounts), it was filled with unknown appliances, most of them electric. Tony didn’t like it one bit. Where had he gotten transported, that they were so much more technologically advanced than him? He thought he was at the forefront of scientific progress, but that illusion was now thoroughly crushed.
The weredog stood up, sensing that they were talking about him, wary in his approach. Maybe Tony could help him, could lift his curse? Or find a way to make him turn back into a human, even just temporarily? There were still many questions left unanswered about the man.
“Maybe if you sat there. I like to draw people. If you sat right there, by the shoe, you’d have interesting shadows on your face and chest. You could pose nude, and nothing would be revealed if you bent your leg a little. It would be a great study in contrast.”
The scars couldn’t be anything other than magical in nature. They were a dark blue, just under the skin, and fanned out from the centre of his chest, just next to his heart. They all originated from a crude circle, and spread out across the chest, the ones reaching the furthest circling a nipple and licking the collarbone. They seemed alive, almost, as if they would start moving any moment. Steve stared and stared, but apart from a faint rippling under the scars, nothing changed, which didn’t reassure Steve in the slightest.
Stark’s eyes were so wide that Steve could see every different shade of blue in them.
The lights are off, and Tony is cocooned in a warm blanket of darkness. He could stay like this forever.
He shouldn’t be surprised, really. He was a first-born; it was only natural that this series of misfortunes had fallen upon him.
“I’ll do my best.”
“Yes. I was trying to catch a star myself, but then I saw you and tried to run towards you, but I fell through the darkness before I was close enough. I wasn’t sure if you’d remember me, if it hadn’t been a strange dream, or just an echo.”
And wasn’t that the problem? Steve hadn’t told Stark because he didn’t want Stark to know. A lot of good that had done Steve, because whatever he seemed to do, Stark always found a way to know exactly what he’d been doing. There wasn’t any point in trying to be secretive, Steve admitted to himself with resignation. There wasn’t anything to be done, Stark had his magic everywhere in the castle, it was linked to Jarvis. Steve should count himself fortunate that Stark wasn’t also aware of what Jarvis said to Steve.
The man staring right back at him has the right bone-structure, the right hair, the right body shape--mmmm, Tony'd recognise these pecs
They looked at each other, then back at him, and Cap said: “We’re in Avengers Mansion, in New York City.”
Tony hurriedly went to his room to change into a white tunic and fitted black pants. When he came back, he smiled at Steve and said:
Around him, the flashes of light were everywhere. The explosions echoed in the hallway, making an unbearable noise. It was too much, too much input, it was all happening too fast.
This is not where Tony thought Steve was going.
“…I’m sure they’ll let you in once they know who you are. We just have to ask Steve, he’s the one in charge of protecting the castle—I know, I know, but he’ll listen if Tony asks him to—he’ll understand, he’s just fierce about—oh.”
Thank you to all the kind and invested comments, it was a pleasure seeing your thoughts and reactions to this story. Writing it was a fun experience, especially merging the two universes together. I hope it was just as fun to read. Come find me on
“And who are you, good sir? You look familiar, where have we met before?”
He pushes someone out of the way, and there Steve is, his shoulder red, but his eyes are clear. Not a life-threatening wound, thank god—
“We can’t work miracles. Don’t be too sad if I don’t make it, okay? You still have much to see.”
“I don’t know what to do, J.”
If you asked Tony how he deserved to die, he’d never tell you that dying at the hands of the man he’s wronged the most is the most fitting death he could have.
Oh. There could have been one moment, one single instance…
They embraced, Tony hugging the sorcerer fiercely, and Steve tried to quash his jealousy.
Steve coughs, and Tony breaks free from the all-encompassing need for long enough to remember his place. He lets Steve’s wrist go as if burned and makes a show of examining the shoulder wound, without actually looking at it. He’s holding his breath the whole time. If he could get away with it, he would have screwed his eyes shut to remove any temptation. When he’s done, he taps Steve lightly on his good shoulders, takes a few hasty steps back, and spouts something along the lines of the wound looking good and not infected. Tony has no idea if what he said is true or not, but he doesn’t care. Steve’s looking a little weirdly at him, but Tony counts this as a success. He hightails it out of there.
Why had Tony gone to see O’Casta?
At these words, Cap crossed the space between them and grasped Stark’s forearms in his hands.
There’s no room for misunderstandings. Only one thing would have Steve reacting like that. Tony has the time to wonder how Strange’s spell could have failed, wonder what will happen to him now that Steve knows. Will Steve throw him in a cell and leave him to rot while he runs around like a headless chicken trying, and failing, to solve the incursions? Will he demand that Tony help him, make him betray the Illuminati? Will he use Tony as an example and crucify him for the world to see,
He continued muttering things under his breath. Steve, on the other hand, was focusing on the mermaid and mandrake part. Those were things that the spell (or poem, as it was) had mentioned. Were they the conditions to making the curse come true?
The worst part about this was that she was, irrevocably, right. Tony’s time had run out. Whatever happened, it would happen tomorrow. Tony would succumb to his curse, or fight the Witch and die, or, and Steve was hoping with all his being that it was this last option, he would fight the Witch and win. And find a way to stop the curse.
Tony’s design for the central circle was even more complicated, concentric circles filled with symbols and shapes that seemed random but were anything but. When they were done, the five circles lit up with a strong white light.
He spent several hours in the shop, the anger slowly seeping out of him as he finally did something with meaning. It didn’t matter how tall or strong he was, he could do this. He could take care of his shop.
“It never hurts to try, Tony. You’ll be in complete control. Nothing can go wrong. You know me. I wouldn’t put you in danger like that.”
, the right cave. He checked his watch, swore when he couldn’t see anything, and used his internal clock instead. If he was right, the ray should land on the key in three, two, one—
Not twenty metres ahead of him, the Witch of the Waste was speaking with a man, both looking at a map in her hands. She was wearing a black dress this time, but her shape, and the aura that flowed around her were unmistakably those of the Witch.
She bent down to take a closer look at Jarvis, her eyes gleaming in the dancing light. It unnerved Steve that he couldn’t see her hands. There was something fishy going on with her. He wanted her gone. Tony had left through the black door, but he hadn’t gone to see her, and now she was here. Had she seen him fly away? Had she decided to take advantage of the fact that he wasn’t home? But why would she want to enter the castle while he wasn’t here?
Tony didn’t say anything about the colour schemes, instead walking over to the lone purple flower.
“I don’t know, everything you see here is normal for this kind of lab. I use transistors and electro-magnetism for the armour, I can show you the plans if you want. Do you have an armour too? Are you Iron Man in your reality as well?”
Which is the wrong thing to say, because Steve is on him, pinning him to the floor with a knee on his back, his arm in a painful twist between his shoulders, a rough hand shoving his cheek into the floor. He can feel Steve’s breath on his neck, and it’s ragged, almost raspy. His fingers are like a vice around Tony’s wrist, thumb digging into his skin, feeling Tony’s elevated heartbeat.
He walks away before anyone recognises him.
Steve steeled himself as he started recognising the streets. He was going to be there soon. He turned a corner and stopped abruptly.
He grabbed the water kettle, satisfied that Jarvis had warmed it up, and put the coffee to brew. It took a while, but as soon as the smell indicated that the coffee was ready, Steve took the cup and walked down the stairs.
Steve likes Tony, and Tony likes Steve. They’re avoiding each other like teenagers. Does Steve write Tony’s name in his notebook? Does he draw little hearts with T+S in the middle? Does he dream of Tony, does he lust after Tony as Tony lusts after Steve? Does he think back to their sparring session when he’s in his bed? Does he touch himself at the memory? Does he thirst after Tony, does he want to taste him like Tony wants to taste Steve?
Steve’s never been really good with dealing with his feelings. He either turns into a maudlin, self-doubting man, or he bends them into anger, and projects it onto someone, until the fire burns itself down.
Still, if it’s the only option…
“That’s, that’s great news, my lord. Do you know who that might be?”
It took a while, but when Steve was done, he had two beautiful bouquets. He realised with a start that he’d made one with the colours of his shield: white, marine blue and dark red; and the other one was a mixture of red, orange and golden yellow, with delicate accents of bright blue, just like Tony’s suit of armour.
“Then please call me Steve.”
The moment it registers, Tony makes a dash for his phone. It shows the time, 10:32, and tells Tony there’s three bars of signal, and Tony lets it drop from his hand, and laughs brightly. He turns to Steve, and Steve smiles at him, and they’re back, they’re out of the time loop, they’re
They were just hiding; they would come back any moment now. Steve stared intently into the black clouds, hoping to see a shimmer of blue, or even yellow, at this point. Where were they?
It was misty outside, the grass hidden beneath a thick layer of floating droplets. The castle wasn’t moving, which made sense if Jarvis was sleeping. Still, it was the first time the hills were entirely silent.
More?
“We’re fine, Cap, good enough to do this. Jarvis is right, we need to do it now. We’ll rest more later. Besides, you taking care of me has done wonders for helping me recover already,” Tony answered with a wink. Well. If he said so. Tony surely seemed in better spirits, the news about his marks notwithstanding.
Tony wonders if anyone would even notice the difference.
But where should he start? He had to understand who this spell was for, who the “me” was, what it was about, and what the second verse was. It could be a spell to help someone do something difficult, since the instructions he had to follow were nearly impossible to complete. Was it a spell for good luck? But what about the honest mind? Was it to discern who lied and who didn’t? If this was a lie-detecting spell, it would be useful on Stark, Steve mused.
His helmet is gone, and Steve has his shield high, ready to strike the killing blow, but he falters suddenly, going pale. He hesitates, a full second, and the murderous edge of his rage is gone, he won’t kill Tony.
He grabbed a glass bottle, half full with a yellow liquid, threw it, and it shattered on the floor, the impact sending spell papers flying. Immediately, a sour smell rose, and Steve watched in horror as the tiles started decomposing before his very eyes. What had been in the bottle? Were the fumes dangerous? Oh God, what was he doing?
Tony scratched at the marks again, wincing as they pulsed angrily.
It was unexpectedly light for its size, big enough to protect Steve if he crouched behind it. The material was nothing like Steve had felt or seen before. It was, without a doubt, a magical metal, its gleam just this side of unnatural. The strap on the backside fit perfectly, the leather supple yet sturdy. It was a work of art. Steve tilted the shield in the light, its silvery surface reflecting and spreading it.
Was the King an acquaintance of Stark’s? Only his friends called him Tony, the others calling him Stark or Anthony or any of his false identities.
Steve finally had the key to break the contract. He could free Jarvis and Tony if he gave Tony his heart back, but it wouldn’t matter if they were dead.
He’s not worried about the anti-registration faction anymore, not as much as when Steve was putting his life in danger every day he refused to register. They’re in the next phase now.
