“Hercules kills him, Tony,” Steve says, and the frown is right there, in his voice. Tony turns and props himself on an elbow again and, yeah, Steve’s frowning, looking sour and concerned. The movement disconnects Steve’s hand from his leg, but it’s easier to think like this.
“You’re a lunatic,” he says, but he looks more relaxed than Tony’s ever seen him, not that that’s saying much.
“Hey, you don’t have to tell me twice,” Bruce says, already backing away. “Your doctor will be in shortly.”
Sam, who’s already shoveling food into his mouth, lifts his eyes, looking strangely innocent. Tony shrugs and doesn’t meet Steve’s eyes even though he can feel the weight of his gaze.
“Yeah,” Steve said, and Tony heard the fondness in his voice, but he was too grateful that Steve put him out of his misery there that he didn’t hardly resent him for it. Steve shifted, then. “Sorry,” he said quickly when he accidentally jabbed into Tony’s side. Tony saw Steve’s shoulders roll back and braced himself. “I’m sorry if I—I didn’t mean to take any liberties earlier when you were—Tony.”
“Why aren't you more worried about this?” Tony finally demands. His blood is boiling, singing—he thought Rhodey would be more concerned, would have something sympathetic to say at the very least.
So they talk. Really and truly for maybe the second or third instance in all the time they’ve known each other. This is the thing they’re always trying to reach, this closeness, this meshing—like they were made to work together. It’s natural as breathing. Tony almost wants to kick himself for not taking Steve up on this offer sooner, back when he’d followed Tony out to Malibu like the reckless, impulsive little shit he truly is.
“I think,” Rhodey says, pauses. The amusement leaves his tone and he sounds serious and soft when he starts up again. “Steve’s learned his lesson. I think he knows what it’s like to hurt you, to have you look at him like someone who’s out to hurt you.”
Tony’s never actually been here before, in person. His first impression is that it’s spacious and echoey and it feels
He thinks of Obie pouring him a nightcap and patting him on the shoulder when he’d get too wound up, eyes dilated with inspiration or coke or mania; he was never one to hover, but he’d laugh as he left, a warm sound Tony used to think of as fond, usually with a comment about how he had to
“I’m just saying. You must feel pretty strongly if you feel this way even after everything that’s gone wrong.”
“Then just come lay down,” Steve says, a smile right there in his voice. Tony looks up then—is he getting laughed at here?—to see Steve looking right at him. He’s still looking when Steve continues, voice pitched low, but the smile kind and open on his face. “I’m sure we can think of something to do.”
“Jim’s right,” Steve says, rolling his head along the wall until he can see Bucky in the chair next to him. “When they let us back, you can’t go.”
Of course, Tony spends his time throwing himself into work, upgrading everyone’s suits as quickly as he can before they get another call to assemble, FaceTiming with a couple of SI’s R&D best, sorting through the new applicants for the internship program, and, between everything else, going over his own notes for the impending team meeting, making Steve go over them, making sure all of the resources he’s promising to people are going to be up and running and ready for them the second they might be needed.
The fighting grows less heated as Thor and the queen make their way to the epicenter of what now could be called a small war zone. They’ve all fizzled down to halfhearted swings and defensive blocks by the time anyone speaks.
him still, just a little, which he feels a little weird about, though that doesn’t stop him from pulling the pillow Steve’d used last night to his chest and taking another deep breath. (At least, he reasons to himself, he didn’t stick his entire face into the pillow. Small victories in self-respect.)
Wanda inclines her head in concession, eyes fixed on the table. Clint still looks pissed, but his shoulders relax just the smallest bit.
There's a knock at the door to his office, and Tony looks up to see Steve standing on the other side of the glass. True to his word, after the debrief, the team had sat down and voiced their respective hangups about the Accords. It had been surprisingly…civil. Tony had felt like a schoolteacher assigning homework, but decided it would go better if everyone went through a copy on their own, marking parts that sound suspicious or confusing. He also promised his door would be open to anyone and everyone if they wanted to discuss something or ask any questions, so Tony waves Steve in.
People are different in the mornings, especially on mornings-after. Usually, the ‘after’ is ‘after sex,’ though he’s almost certain this qualifies as a morning after. After vulnerability, after truth, after intimacy. This is just much, much less familiar to Tony. When it’s ‘after sex’ Tony knows what to do, joke or leave or smile. This isn’t uncharted territory, not exactly, but it’s not familiar either.
“That’s not—” Steve says, but then Natasha’s stepping between them, and then her eyes are widening and she’s falling.
“Tony, there are still two plates stacked with pancake skyscrapers,” Steve says, not quite laughing, but he definitely wants to be.
in there, something about how Tony refuses to be the Kate Winslet in this scenario, or, hell, even something about how that would just be a bonus for Clint if he really were to jump, but none of the words are coming out, and the silence has gone on for too long and now he’s not even sure if he—
“What else can I do?” Steve asked, voice rumbling all around Tony, breath ghosting over the top of his hood, sound close to his ear. It was easier to focus on the one thing when it took up all of the sensory space. Tony was grateful.
“We’ll escort the remaining Brood back down and through their portal,” Steve says. “Does anyone need—?”
Rhodey hits the road soon after stopping by Tony’s room. Later, hours later, it’s the middle of the night. Tony’s lying in bed, in the comfiest clothes he could find, all lights off, and he’s thinking maybe Rhodey’s had too much faith in him yet again. It’s starting to wear on him, the not-sleeping thing. Even if he doesn’t physically need it (and he has to still need some, doesn’t he?) the psychological strain of being conscious for so long is getting to him in a way wouldn’t have anticipated. He’s stern with himself this time, though, and he stays in bed instead of going down to the shop or wandering out to the kitchen. He needs to sleep.
“They gave him something and are trying to ice his ankle back down to a normal size,” she says, and she gives him a tug. Steve remembers why he's standing next to a door in the medical wing. He’s not overly cooperative. “Come on.”
“Sure thing,” she says icily. “Even though I’m the one who’s gonna be stuck explaining that decision, by all means. Thirty percent it is.”
bounces around in Tony’s skull. Does Steve mean the team? Probably. It could also be a more personal
He still has his in-ear comm with him, transmission off. He’s only able to pick up every odd word, and it doesn’t make much sense. He tries to pay more attention to the voices than the words. Sam and Clint, their tones suggesting bickering, Steve’s increasingly clipped orders. This fire inside of him is spreading out from the injection sites, down to his knees and up his neck, slowly, so slowly.
“Clint,” Steve says, “I want you with me. Nat, we could use a lullaby. Everyone else, I want you to start an escort of the Brood back down and through that portal. Oversee it or get the local authorities set up.”
Your best friend lost his legs, and for what? Because you couldn’t talk about your feelings with Captain America?”
“Christ, Nat,” he says, settling his hands on her spine and shoulder blade. Sam is coming forward too at a more sedate pace. “I thought you were gonna backhand me.”
He takes a couple of steps closer, knowing he can’t leave her here like this but also knowing that he definitely shouldn’t touch. Halting his approach, he starts to circle around so the island is between them even though that means he’s coming at her from an angle instead of straight on. Normally, he knows, it’s better to let the person know you’re there, to stay in their line of sight, but Tony really does have a couple self-preservation instincts lying around. Right now, his hind brain is telling him to get some shelter.
“Come on,” the first voice laughs. It’s Wanda, and there’s only one set of footsteps, so Tony knows Vision’s there before he even turns far enough to see. “It wasn’t that bad.”
It doesn’t take them long to migrate back to the living room. Tony would just take them down to the ’shop, but all of the stools down there are backless, hard metal. He’s got holo-interfaces in just about every room now (except the guest bathrooms, even he knows that’s excessive) so they just settle back on the couch there and Rhodey asks what he’s been working on.
“And you’re okay, right?” Tony says. “I don’t want you to tell me where you are,” he says quickly, “just—you’ve got somewhere to stay, and enough food?”
Sam stands square to both of them, making it a triangle of people instead of the both of them staring at Tony.
“Evening,” Tony says, dipping his head in Sam’s direction before looking back at the tablet, like he’s doing very important, very engrossing work.
“Hey, man,” Scott says, hands raised in surrender, “I don’t care how it happens. A miracle’s a miracle.”
He flops onto the bed, right in the middle, and stretches out to slip his phone onto the nightstand, reasoning that Steve can tell him to budge over and pick whichever side he wants.
“I think it's time,” Tony says. “We need to start taking some initiative with team members’ mental health, Steve. I think the best plan is regular, Avenger-mandated therapy to, one, decide if people are combat ready and, two, if they’re not, get them the help they need without making it feel like some sort of punishment.”
“Not what I meant,” Tony says, and he doesn’t know what he’s feeling except that he feels a lot of it, and that he’s present in the moment again. Whatever reality he’s in, he’s really
“Of course I do,” he says. But because he’s not trying to be an asshole, he adds with a hint of honesty, “I’m also way too keyed up to sleep.”
“Oh, my God,” Bruce says, chuckles humorously. He slips his forefinger and thumb under his glasses to pinch the corners of his eyes.
“Tony?” Steve says, and the shoulder rotates as Steve reaches around, putting a hand on Tony’s back and, oh, hey, isn’t that pleasant? Nice and kind and warm and soft? A tear slips through the inside corner of his eye, off the bridge of his nose, and splashes onto the rock he’s sitting on. It’s insane, but with Extremis, he can actually hear it.
Steve looks beyond Tony’s shoulder for a couple seconds like he’s scanning the room for someone else. When he focuses back on Tony, he braces his arms in the door frame and slumps a bit.
“Thanks," Clint says. “Y’know, they couldn’t order me to help if they tried. Legally, according to those Accords we all signed. I’m just socially awkward and would much rather give ‘em the slip before they could ask. Hashtag Know Your Rights.”
“I know,” Steve says, and he uses one hand to brush back Tony’s hair, comforting and checking for head injuries. “A med team’s on their way. I’m right here,” he says again.
“A word of advice, Captain,” Rhodey says, and he takes a step forward, finger pointing right in Steve’s face, “if you want Tony to talk to you again, ever, he—” Rhodey switches to pointing at Bucky, “—doesn’t step foot beyond that door.”
He waits a beat, but Steve just stares at the floor, man-out-of-time style, sad and lost. Tony steps around in front of him, still not touching, but close enough that he’s in Steve’s line of sight and, sure enough, Steve looks up to meet his eyes, jaw clenched.
And then she’s there, somehow taking up all the space of the doorway with her small frame. She takes in the bathroom for a second, wrinkles her nose, and then straightens out her face into an almost neutral expression when she looks at him.
but then he deletes it. This isn’t that conversation, and he shouldn’t turn it into that conversation, not when they’re texting and on opposite sides of the county. Talk about running from conflict.
Steve sits still long enough to let a couple nurses pluck pebbles from his open wounds. During that time, he eats two energy bars while Bucky stands in the corner and watches the proceedings, hand on his hip, like he’s afraid Steve’s going to bolt.
When Steve and Tony had sat on the couch, it wasn’t one person comforting the other; it didn’t feel like giving anything up or taking anything away. It was breathing and understanding each other, and living despite the violence they’ve committed, and allowing themselves to live, and to be comforted and, more impossibly, to comfort. Tony doesn’t think he’s ever felt that before. He wonders if that’s the definition of love, or if he’s just really fucked up. He remembers seeing Steve tormenting himself for things that happened, and he remembers knowing that feeling exactly, but he also remembers knowing that Steve’s a good person, a person who’s fought and been fought against, who everyone expects to keep fighting and to figure it out, because he’s Captain America, that’s what he does. He remembers how young and vulnerable Steve looked in the kitchen, and how Steve drove him all the way home.
There’s a pause in the conversation then. Tony takes the opportunity to drain his coffee cup and refill it. Fuck it, he won’t be able to taste anything for a week anyway. Steve doesn’t answer until Tony’s facing him again.
“Oh, he is,” Tony says. “I didn’t know they made kids that good. God knows I was a little shit until my mid-30’s. And, no offense, but I know for a fact you were a handful.”
“Just,” he says, stops. Steve pauses, too. After a moment, he puts his hand on the back of Tony’s head, letting it stay where it is, shielded. His fingers slide through Tony’s hair, and Tony makes the conscious decision to let himself be comforted by it.
He grabs his glass off the island and comes around to get a seat at the table. Tony’s head is still angled down toward his tablet, but he’s been watching Barnes’s every move since he came all the way into the room. When Bucky goes behind Tony, disappears from sight fully, it’s supposedly just to get to the chair at the head of the table, the one between Clint and Tony. Too bad that logical reason doesn’t stop Tony from feeling like his entire spine’s just been electrified. He jolts in his chair and Clint’s being subtle about watching him, at least, but he can feel Thor’s eyes on him, and he’s suddenly boxed in, stuck, and he can hear them all breathing individually. He blinks hard and pushes his chair out a few inches with a terrible grinding sound. One of his elbows plants on the table, and he balances his head on his hand, fingers along his eyebrow. He clears his throat, tells himself, breathe. Bucky’s frozen, half-sitting, half-standing over the chair at the head of the table.
“Right,” Steve says dryly. He thinks of Tony screaming in pain, and of Clint in surgery, Bruce’s return, and Steve’s own freakout that lasted the entire way here. He doesn’t think he’s seen Natasha sit down since they touched down in Chicago. “You seen a doctor yet?”
“Then get in line!” Tony says. “I want you to tell me the truth! I want you to feel like we’re friends, but I guess that’s just too damn bad for me!”
“I—thanks,” Peter says quickly. “I’ve been here before, actually. Briefly. Never to the garage, I guess. Or most of the rest of it.”)
When Tony looks, Steve is watching him steadily. Tony doesn’t back down and Steve doesn’t move to challenge the statement.
For a few minutes, he gravitates toward Bruce and Thor where they’ve turned their chairs to face the picture windows. Thor has a tall glass mug full of beer, and Bruce just a can of Guayaki. The feeling with them is one of calmness right up until he realizes both Bruce and Thor missed the moment he stopped drinking (not that it was a single moment, exactly, or something he made an announcement about, but everyone else knows, they all saw the process, the adjustments he made). Unless someone’s mentioned it to them, they don’t know. He could easily snag some scotch from behind the bar and drink it over here, and they wouldn’t even know to be disappointed.
It’s the truth anyway, even if it doesn’t explain what Tony’s doing standing in front of Steve’s bedroom like an idiot. Steve’s brow furrows.
Tony gets out of the elevator and speeds up his pace as their words become more distinct, just a little, because it’s weird to be accidentally eavesdropping like this.
Tony squints at the ceiling, glances at Steve for the barest moment before shrugging back at Clint. They’d talked about it only fleetingly, but he buys himself some time to figure out how to paraphrase
“Oh, please,” Tony says. “You’ll gripe like you always do, but really. We’ll get Thor to bring some of that mead. Even you’ll have to have fun.”
“I’ve been going through performance reports and background checks for psychologists for hours,” Steve says by way of explanation.
Conversation turns then to safer grounds, idle chatter more fitting of the hour. Everyone filters through eventually for caffeine and food and company.
In short, Steve’s lying, and Tony has mixed feelings about that. But it’s one of those lies people tell to make you feel better, and it’s a nice enough thought that Tony doesn’t call him on it.
Bruce’s affection for Tony has always bled over into how the Hulk feels about him, ever since that first battle. This, what appears to be happening now, simply doesn’t compute for Steve. He looks back at the Hulk and traces his line of sight again and, right there, he’s obviously looking at Tony, low to the ground and growling.
T’Challa’s here now, though Tony’s not sure when that happened. He’s fierce and efficient and ruthless and barely bats an eye at the infected when Tony tells him there’s nobody left inside the husks.
FRIDAY doesn’t even grace that with a response. Tony doesn’t blame her, but he does roll his eyes at himself since that’s one thing she can’t do.
It’s only after he says this, of course, that his eye catches on the disaster close to the back corner of the ’shop, like someone toppled something explosive and then covered the mess in a blanket. He reaches for a stern, disappointed voice, because that’s the only way the bots ever learn, but what comes out is laughter, bubbling and floating out of him, until he’s leaning on U for support and Dum-E comes back to poke at him like he’s looking for the reset button.
“Bruce said they still couldn’t give Tony anything for the pain,” she says quietly. “Said it would confuse the ‘program’ to introduce a foreign chemical agent. Or something like that.”
Tony agrees with her still, distantly and bitterly, though his ears ring slightly when she gives voice to it. There’s enough bitterness in the room already, he’s half afraid bringing theirs into the fold will really start a fire.
“I know it doesn’t matter how I want you to feel,” Tony says. Steve stays looking at the TV, but he reaches a hand up and grabs onto Tony’s leg. “For what it’s worth, though. I don’t get off on your misery.”
So Steve makes seven quiches, and Tony makes five piles of french toast, and Thor meanders over at one point and wrings out oranges for juice (because Thor’s been all but banned from cooking with real appliances due to a couple of unfortunate instances back at the Tower, though Tony half suspects that was on purpose too, just like the “salt-cured boar” thing, because he’s really just a huge asshole and also a prince).
Evacuations are the only thing they’re keeping up with. Wanda and Vision have come back to the fight after the direct perimeter was cleared. Now the police are evacuating people in a wider and wider diameter. Tony feels slightly better with the buffer zone, but it doesn’t mean anything if they can’t get this under control.
“My bet’s on Lang,” Steve says right away, like he’s already been thinking about it. There’s a smile playing on his lips for the first time since he got here, and Tony already knows his answer.
“And the circumstances where we’re in conflict or not alone have yielded…somewhat different results, historically speaking,” Steve agrees easily enough, but his smile has mostly vanished.
“Especially for the newer kids,” he says thoughtfully. Steve’s tense against him again, but he seems more excited than nervous now.
“Then why…” And Steve sounds so desperate, Tony wants to spit, to scream, you did this to us, this is your fault, you don’t get to sound so sad. Even his smile is heartbreaking. “I know our coffee’s not as practiced as yours, but it hasn’t killed anyone yet.”
“I’m good. I’ve got a couple things downstairs I wanna get to today. Really shouldn’t have slept so long.”
“We have visitors,” Vision says then, sounding lighter than he has in a while. Tony wants to look, but he’s engaged on the ground. He’s just distracted enough to miss the tail sweeping around. It knocks his feet out from under him, but from the ground he easily aims up and fires his repulsors through the soft underside of the alien’s jaw.
“Uh,” Peter says, looking back and forth between Tony and the popped hood. “Theoretically? I mean—in a technical way, yeah, but I’ve never really…what kinda car is this? It’s amazing!”
“It’s—” Tony says, stops to rethink what he’s trying to convey. He fixes his eyes to a bluejay perching a few rows away and tries again. “It means a lot that you took the time to look back and parse what went wrong and where, but, Cap,”
“Yeah, so? I’ve got dibs, I’m calling it. As in: before Pym. God, please don’t let her work for Pym.”
He lays there, and he breathes, and tells himself not to be stressed over the fact that he’s not already asleep after three nonstop days (has it been three already?).
“Of course I can,” he says, already taking another tissue out and rolling it into a ball. He hardly looks at the can before he throws.
Abruptly, he wanders to the other end of the living room where Clint and Vision are playing darts. Wanda and Scott wave him over and talk him into gambling with them. He bets on Vis because he’s, like, a quarter Tony’s son, even though one look tells him Barton’s here to destroy the competition. He graciously loses $40 and claps Vision on the shoulder and leans in close enough to whisper.
He stops to listen. Steve’s breathing is harsh, uneven. His arm twitches around Tony’s waist, wrapping around the curve of his ribs and squeezing. The movement isn’t conscious, not carried out with any kind of awareness of Tony’s presence, and he can feel the pure tension coming from Steve’s muscles
Clint stares at him and he just stares back. What kind of a person does Clint think he is? What the fuck? Eventually Clint just mumbles his thanks and retreats. Tony closes his eyes.
There’s a pause on the other side of the line that definitely does not bode well for Tony. Even straining, he can’t hear Steve breathing or anything. He’s just about to pull the phone away from his face to see if Steve had actually just hung up on him when Steve responds, hesitantly.
“Like a rock,” Tony says, letting the weight of his head flop forward onto Steve’s chest. Steve removes his unpinned arm and stretches again, humming low in his throat.
What it comes down to is this: Tony doesn’t know if what he experienced last night falls under the category of Mental Manipulation Gone Awry or if it’s more of a Cardiac Event. He doesn't know and he honestly doesn’t expect anyone’s help either way.
“It’s too high on your ribs,” Steve explains, dabbing slowly at the fresh and caked-on blood. “If you keep twisting to clean it, it’ll keep bleeding.”
“Always focused on the big picture," Steve murmurs, but he’s smiling, and the wind is tousling his hair.
“Oh no, no, no,” Tony cuts in. Steve tries to talk again and Tony raises his voice just enough to talk over him. “You don’t need to apologize for not coming to see me. You just, you realize I’m there for a reason, right? That shit’s like a different language and I’ve gone over every point at least a dozen times with an entire team of lawyers. Legalese doesn’t always mean what the individual words translate to, and some of that developed when you were taking your ice nap.”
“Whose side was she on for the Accords, again?” Bruce asks, and Tony’s chest aches fiercely, briefly.
They don’t say anything after that. Steve seems to be trying to regulate his breathing and Tony’s focusing on staying awake. There’s nothing to say anyway. After a few minutes, Steve starts talking again, telling the others where he thinks they are.
“Fought the robots?” he asks. Tony nods. Steve stares for a long moment before he speaks, even though they both know he’s going to say it: “Yeah.”
“Other options like what?” Steve asks, leaning forward in his seat. “Like saying ‘hey, guys, I need medical attention ASAP, bye’?”
She looks at him helplessly, and then at the alien-person hybrid. Miraculously, though, she turns and runs out of the room.
“He’s—good. Tough, like he always is. He can walk short distances with the braces now, and he’s staying down in Philly with his parents for a while.”
“I missed you,” Tony says, the words spill out of his mouth, and they’re not even the ones he means to say. Bruce pauses mid-drink. He swallows and lowers the mug, focusing squarely on Tony again.
When they get down to the common floor, Thor’s already up and about, cross-legged in a recliner, wearing his Yoda slippers and reading a paperback with a plain maroon cover. He looks from Steve to Tony and back, a grin spreading over his face.
“Oh, you definitely are,” Pepper says, and she doesn’t look not-sad, but she's smirking, picking up her spoon to take a sip of soup.
“Welcome back, Boss,” she says, and it even sounds like she means it. Tony scrunches his eyes closed briefly.
“Me neither,” Bruce mumbles. Then, louder, “It’s a—livable solution. In the literal sense. And it’s not
“You’ve been kinda quiet, man,” Rhodey says after they’ve eaten. And Tony started out pretty strong, lots of banter and easy chatting, but he’s starting to get tired and, yeah, a little queasy. They spent hours working on Rhodey’s legs.
So he spends that first night lounging in his bed, full of warm pork chili, getting himself caught up on what happened while he was out of it. He reviews the footage of the debrief (the aliens apparently just…left, after that entire fight, they just up and left like it never even happened), reviewing the reports (Clint’s internal injuries, Scott’s dislocated shoulder, Natasha’s near collapse after failing to get herself checked out, Steve’s own absolutely torn up back from being skipped like a stone across the concrete), and the general goings-on of the compound (mainly the fact that Bucky’s creeping around the premises). It’s hardly news that he doesn’t get any sleep. There’s a surprising amount of information to go through considering it’s been a couple of days (three days, actually; Extremis really struggled to get going for a while there), but he thinks he gets the general picture eventually.
And there’s Steve’s disappointed voice. It makes Tony want to throw a chair. That voice has never once made him want to be calm or rational. Tony whirs around to face the man, and only just keeps from balling his fists up or baring his teeth.
“It’s—not,” Tony says, but that’s not quite right because it obviously is, which Steve knows, of course, if his raised eyebrow is anything to go by. “Or it
They’re almost at the compound when Steve finally rolls up the window. Tony kind of wants to roll it back down just to be petty, and he kind of wants to jump out of the moving vehicle to avoid Steve.
and a dam about to burst. Apologies are dangerous, always have been, because—Christ, he has so much to apologize for. If he starts, it’s hard to know when to stop. There’s no way to apologize adequately within the bounds of words. Normally, he navigates this by only apologizing for very specific things, when he can pick out one wrong thing he’s done, one singularity that deserves the words.
“Extremis isn’t supposed to be working this way,” Rhodey says. “Not that this version has been tested before, but. They don’t know which is winning.”
“It’s part of the point,” he says. He turns to Wanda then. She’s slightly red in the face and looks wildly uncomfortable, but she’s holding herself still with a kind of dignity Tony thinks she’s maybe picked up from Vision. “I wouldn’t have turned you away. Your hurt, your anger—they were justified. But the point stands that either I should’ve been kicked off the team after Ultron, or you shouldn’t have been whisked off your very keenly bloodthirsty path and right onto the roster.
“Okay,” Tony says. He sits up fully now, well and truly awake thanks to that bit of adrenaline. The sensation of the sheet flows over him like a wave, soft and light. “Awesome, right. Because I did the thing.”
(Another part of him thinks Steve might not have gone so entirely off the rails if he hadn’t had his closest friend backing his every decision but, really, Sam
“Just making sure you’re not fixin’ to poison me,” Tony says, willing it to sound like a normal worry.
“I admit,” Thor says, his voice a calm, low hum, and Tony almost startles all over again, “I know the word therapy, though the concept is...slightly foreign.”
For a couple seconds Tony thinks that maybe they actually did fix the whole agony problem. Only for a couple seconds, though. Whichever subprotocol this is, Tony knows that part of the deal is that his speakers are off. He’s secure enough in that knowledge that he gives in, groans low in his throat when the tingling turns to more. At the end of it, when his lungs are empty, he gasps, and tries to curl in on himself. It doesn’t work, of course, FRIDAY’s still in control of the suit.
“I’m bound to win at least once,” Tony says, and he turns to shut down the monitor he’d been working on manually so Steve doesn’t see the way his good mood’s withered and died. “This is Disney we’re talking about.”
And so Steve had promised to respect his space, and Tony had sworn on Maria’s grave to honestly try to be where he said he would be when he said he would be there. And it’s been going pretty well considering it’s him and Tony, but SI’s in the middle of a crisis—which is fine, Tony told him he’d be pretty busy until the metaphoric fire was extinguished, but there was clear communication and everything. The crisis has been going on for two weeks, though, and four days ago Tony blacked out the lab and stopped letting people in.
Bucky stays just as quiet, only answering the occasional question Tony throws his way (he always answers promptly, though, no lag in his responses to indicate that he’s freaking out), and doing exactly the movements Tony instructs him to do, and only those movements.
“No, I.” Tony pauses, looks to the side and then back again. “Never mind, it’s nothing to worry about, but I’m not trying to be a dick about this. Really. Thanks for the ride.”
“You’ve got a unique situation,” Tony says in agreement. “And I didn’t want to do anything without your say-so, but I’d like to bring your aunt in on the conversation. And as for the secret identity bit, I don’t think there’s any reason you’d have to reveal your face. Especially not right away. Though I also think this might be a good opportunity for you to be able to have a therapist who knows the ins and outs of your life, who will also be discreet.”
And that’s….well, that’s all of them. Rhodey goes to sit in the armchair between the couch and one of the loveseats, and Steve’s zipping around with paper plates and containers of food. They need more furniture, Tony notes with delight. They’re all here, and there’s not enough room to sit. The giddiness turns sour in his mouth for a brief moment as it brings up the memory of how empty it was, how lonely when it was only him and Vision. Those three months before Natasha came waltzing back in, where the vastness of the compound threatened to swallow him daily.
Nat’s widowbites are exceptionally ineffective, but her and Scott seem to have teamed up. Scott gets captured while Natasha sneaks up from behind, and then he shrinks down to safety while she slits its throat or shoots its brains out from the soft, unprotected underside of its jaw.
That day after he first wakes up, he’s left to his own devices under the order to rest, which. Yeah, right. He’s just gotten the twenty-first century version of a super soldier serum. He doesn’t exactly need a nap, not after the two-day incubation period. So he works on a couple rudimentary contingencies and gets FRIDAY to do a writeup for the UN rep that’ll keep them satisfied for a little while, at the very least. Rhodey communicates via FRIDAY to make sure he’s still alive, but gives him his space, too, because he truly is Tony’s oldest friend, and Pepper stops by his room with some of Clint’s get-well-soon soup (the recipe comes from the brother he never talks about, but he makes it whenever one of his kids gets a cold or one of his teammates has a near death experience close enough to death), a reminder to take it easy, and a fierce hug goodbye. She doesn’t mention the way she breezed out of medical before, and he doesn’t want to sour another moment between them, so he keeps his mouth shut too, focuses on the sharp knob of her shoulder and the seven shades of gold in her hair.
Bruce doesn’t answer and Tony takes a breath. It’s not like he expected an answer. It's not like there’s any answer Bruce could give that would make Tony feel better about it.
Tony raises his eyebrows at both of them, but takes his mug and sits next to Scott at the island instead of bolting right away.
“I’m not sayin’ you gotta sleep,” Sam says as he presses the call button for the elevator. “If you can’t, then…Just rest. Chill out. Night!” he calls as he turns.
“Actually, I’m pretty sure you woulda just punched me if I asked you anything like that,” Steve says. Tony shrugs so that Steve can feel it, and he falls silent until they get out the south door, down the corridor, outside where Steve retrieves the car, and out of the city. It’s somewhere passed Kingston but before Albany that Tony takes a deep breath. The speed limit up here is 55mph, and even though Steve’s speeding a fair amount, the roads up here are winding and there aren’t streetlights for the most part. The drive to the compound takes a good while, especially after dark. (And of course Steve heard “home" and interpreted it as “the compound,” but not even Tony’s quite sure what he meant when he said it, so he’s not going to make a fuss.)
He never seriously considered that Steve might be the same way, not for anyone other than Bucky. Maybe that was wrong of him.
“Hey,” Tony says when Clint doesn’t. Clint stops in front of the cot and puts his hands on his hips.
flits through his head and it reminds him with a jolt of genuine surprise that they were supposed to do exactly that. And Tony would ask himself how in the hell he could’ve forgotten that, but there was an alien attack to consider, and then the small matter of his own infection and subsequent days of unconsciousness, followed by the adjustment of waking up to Extremis.
“Right, that. Reacting!” He puts both of his hands back down on the podium but keeps smirking at the sea of media reps. “What happened was a mess of reactionary thinking and, as it turns out, we’d all react differently to something like that. What matters is that, when we have more than three days and access to people who’ve gone to eight-plus years of school just to understand things like the Accords, we come back together.”
Pepper gets quiet then, and Tony feels like he’s said something wrong. He wants to fix it, needs to, because he has no idea what he’ll do if he can’t. He needs her in his life. It doesn’t make sense without her, and he’s not terrified to find how essential she is, that ship has sailed, but he will flay himself open, bare his heart for her to poke at and dissect at her leisure if it means she’ll stay.
“Hey, buddy,” Tony says softly, and U lifts his claw slowly, closing it as he pulls away in a strange petting motion, does it again, and again. “Good job looking after the place, it’s not even a little burnt.”
Tony feels like he’s freezing up, like his gears are one-by-one grinding to a dead halt. Because he has to prove them wrong, he has to prove Steve wrong. He has to be a goddamn adult about this, not a reactionary four-year-old throwing a tantrum. But fuck if it doesn’t feel like burning alive.
“Mine,” Tony says, and he lets a bit of the bitterness creep into his voice because, yes, okay, it still stings a little bit, to think that Natasha’s only ever on his side as long as it suits her needs. “To start with anyway. She jumped ship with Cap, of course, because who in their right mind would stay on my side because of something as silly as agreeing with my reasoning, right?”
“As I was saying,” Steve says, looking amused, “Tony’s been tweaking this car as long as I’ve known him.”
but.” A deep breath that hikes his shoulders up. “God, I’m astounded we made it so long after Ultron without something worse landing in our laps.”
“Okay,” Tony says just as Steve rounds the corner and leans a hip against the counter, eyebrow raised. “Listen, ’kay? I’m fine. I’m dandy, and I’m not just saying that this time. What did Ned hear?”
“To help me?” Tony says. He has no idea what his voice is doing right now—if it’s incredulous, angry, quiet, amused. No idea. Any or all or none. He feels all of those things, he feels
“I, uh,” Tony says. “You know, I should probably stick around. At least until we know I won’t go off and murder a bunch of innocent people.”
If the worst has happened, Steve owes Tony nothing less than his greatest effort to bring him back. Barring that, he deserves all the dignity Steve can offer.
“No, I think I meant he’s a lunatic,” Bucky says, coming farther into the room, getting down a glass from the cabinet and pouring himself some orange juice. “And thanks for the sentiment, but you really don’t need to make me a thing.”
the bots have burned the ’shop down. No, there’s no use in covering for them, what kind of fool do you take me for?”
It’s that impulse—the one that screams at him that the meeting can’t happen as long as he’s beneath the covers—along with the knowledge that if he stays much longer he won’t be able to face the day at all, that propels him up and away from the bed. He needs to get out of his head before he either bolts or makes himself ill. Jeans and a black tank top, a quick shave and no shower. Tony’s lived long enough as himself to know he needs to move now, somehow. Neither fight nor flight are going to help him today—at least not right at the moment—but if he can’t trick his body into thinking he’s doing one of those he feels like he may very well lose his mind. It’s one of the few not-entirely-toxic coping mechanisms he learned from Howard.
“There are enough options,” Natasha adds, “that we could all end up with an entirely different therapist, if that’s how it shakes out. The four profiles you have now are just the most promising. There are options, and if none of them work out, we can find more.”
When Tony uncovers his eyes, Steve’s still there, and this strikes Tony as a minor miracle for no particular reason.
There’s something heavy on his leg all of a sudden, so heavy he can’t move it. Going from how Steve pales and gasps, he can feel the weight, too.
“Come on,” he mutters as the infected person howls and stumbles away in pain. And, interesting, it walks on the human legs. Then louder, “Anybody home in there?”
“Fri,” he says, hisses, because she’s the only one left. And Tony doesn’t want to die alone. He doesn’t. Been there, done that, it sucked.
“Something smells good,” he says. Natasha pushes herself up to standing and rolls out her neck as she walks away.
“Dummy?” Bucky says in disbelief, but he approaches Tony anyway, the bot trailing behind. “You actually named him—”
Is that a dumb thing to say? Probably, though he’s pretty sure the kid will appreciate the sentiment either way. Tony himself bombed most every history class he took, but out of spite towards his dad. That’s probably not something he needs to mention, though.
and Barnes’ mane of hair, and that’s it, that’s perfect. Even though it’s supposed to be Chewbacca ripping off people’s arms, not Princess Leia ripping off Chewy’s—and there, his good mood’s dissipating already. Because Barnes killed his parents and Steve knew, and, God, this is such old news. He feels so disjointed lately, and the air whenever he’s around Steve is just so heavy, and he thinks it could’ve been so much better than this. He has no idea if it can ever be more than this, now. Forgetting for a short time and then getting hit by a brick wall of distrust and hurt and
“I hope you know,” Clint says, “next time you’re in the field? You’ll be wearing two inches of sparring foam around that thick skull of yours, Cap.”
“Just looking over some notes for the meeting tomorrow," he says. He locks the tablet and tosses it onto an armchair a couple feet away. Sam nods, his head lolling a little as he does.
“That’s not quite the right term. More like…dead and gone,” Tony says. “I think we might be on our way to becoming friends again though. Y’know, someday. Eventually.”
“Did I—miss something here?” Scott asks eventually. Steve’s settled himself against the arm of the couch where Tony’s sitting, arms crossed, visibly trying to look innocent. Tony can’t help but smirk at him. (The thought creeps up on him, that Steve’s apparently only good at lying when he’s got the time to plan it out, but—Jesus, he needs to chill out, because at the same time it’s incredibly endearing and so very Steve.)
“And it’s no one person’s decision,” Steve says placatingly. “That’s what the rubric’s for. It’s a matter of safety, for new and existing members.”
“I—” Peter says, looking over and noticing who’s standing off to the side. “H-hi, Mr. America—Captain Rogers, sir, of course I remember. Or, I mean—sorry about Germany. Not really, though, because I still think you were wrong, but—oh, God. That’s not what I—”
“I,” Tony says. He laughs once. "God, you're gonna find this hilarious. Sort of? I mean, there’s something, but not a single kiss. Yet.”
“Actually,” Steve says, “it is.” Pepper’s shoulders pull back even farther. “It’s in a contract somewhere. I’m entitled to the medical information of anyone on the current roster when it’s liable to interfere with the team.”
“Gotta look pretty for the conference table?” Tony says, teasing and light. He thinks Sam is often the grounding factor for his friends and teammates, and the favor could be returned more than it is.
He brushes his teeth when he gets out, and then pauses, eyeing his pill bottles. His scars are MIA, sure, but Tony doesn’t know what other parts of his physicality have changed. Does he even need the heart medication still? If he doesn’t, and he takes it anyway, will that fuck something up? But what if he does need it? That’ll be the first thing he figures out when he gets down to the lab, he decides, and quickly swallows a couple pills just in case.
He misses Clint’s reaction if there is one, and then he’s alone on the balcony again. Tony lowers himself a bit by the arms, and then drops onto his butt on the ground. It’s nice out, the evening’s cooling off into nighttime, but the air’s still tacky the way it always is when NYC isn’t frozen. The air passes in and out of his lungs smoothly, and he’s fine, he really is. He also knows that he won’t be okay if he goes back in there, if he has to spend one more minute with somebody in a suit or a gown.
“Just,” Tony says, and jerks this thumb toward his own door. He clears his throat. “Grabbing some sweats and then I’ll—your room?”
Wanda gives them a closed-mouth smile and Vision bids them a good evening. Tony waits until they’re firmly in the elevator with the doors closed before speaking again.
Most of that time is spent in his office, and precious little of it is spent in the workshop. He tries to make good on his promise to be available to the others, though, so far, only Sam has wandered in with the occasional question. Tony would be pissed if he didn’t see Steve with his head bent over his packet every time he passes the living room, and Natasha helping Wanda with her copy at the breakfast table. If he didn’t know better he’d think Sam was asking Steve’s questions for him and reporting back the answers he gets from Tony.
“So what you’re saying is,” Tony wrinkles his nose, “there’s nothing for me to do, right now, immediately at this moment, to fix everything.”
Why do they both sound so pissed off? This isn’t the conversation Tony came here to have. Which Steve is this? Why, why,
“Aw, man,” he says, turning to the kitchen. He calls out, “Please tell me I didn’t miss the drag-Tony-for-wearing-shades-inside sess, because I could really use that today.” Then, facing Tony again, “Dude.”
It’s a fucking leap of faith, is what it is, and Tony’s always had a questionable relationship with faith, with fate, with knowing when to let something go.
“Bruce had a, uh, good point before though,” Scott says after another moment. “Therapy’s kinda personal, isn’t it? What gives you the right to tell us we need it?”
“Injected himself with Extremis,” Steve says. The rolling, flailing energy seems to have left Tony after vomiting. He’s slumped against the wall now, eyes half open, moaning so quietly on the exhale.
Steve gasps then, at the awful sharp pressure against his back. His eyes shut tightly against the pain and by the time he opens them he’s just tired.
that if JARVIS were still around, he’d flip that switch, but it’s not JARVIS, it’s FRIDAY. Tony loves FRIDAY because she’s his kid too, but it’s not the same, it can’t be the same. It’s petty and unreasonable, but he’s just not close enough with FRIDAY for her to understand what’s going on with him right now, and he doesn’t have the words to explain it.
1. Steve’s fine with the idea of making Avengers complete a training regimen before being considered field ready, but he wants the Avengers to be in charge of both the training and the decision as to who’s fit for field work. (Tony thinks they can swing this if they can come up with a standardized rubric for the training and actually stick to it.)
He flicks his gaze back to Wanda, who’s now standing straight up, but hasn’t lowered her hands. He remembers the men and women they had to fight, had to
Finally, he’s got a good dozen baseline tests under his belt and the new machine assembled—and damn, he’s going to have to come up with a name for it, isn’t he—and it gets a little easier to breathe.
“Walk me through it,” Steve says eventually. Tony takes a deep breath and hopes the planets are aligned.
Of course, he knows he hasn’t been talking much. It’s not something that’s exactly easy to miss from him, after all. He just hadn’t quite understood, before, that he’s stopped talking completely. And, okay, it’s not like there’s anyone around for him to talk
It comes from behind them, and when Steve turns he sees Sam occupying two waiting room chairs turned to face each other; he’s sitting in one and has his ankle propped up in another. That’s not what makes Steve pause, though. Rhodey’s there, too. He’s standing, pacing but trying to be sneaky about it, and he looks more pissed off than anything. Natasha’s there as well, standing behind the chair Sam’s sitting in, one hand braced on the back. She looks pained, gaze flickering to the door Tony’s behind, then to Bucky, and then settling on Steve.
“What’s the expression—cool your jets?” Vision says, but he turns to the sink and away from Clint, bowl in hand, and rolls his eyes so only Tony can see. He smiles back conspiratorially after fishing a mug out of the cabinet. At the island, the young voice from the StarkPad is telling a story involving a trowel, sand, and a boy’s underwear, and at the same time Clint’s grumbling under his breath
There’s nothing but blue. Is that even possible? How can there be—twelve different kinds of blue and not a single crosses into green territory?”
He’s pretty sure that Steve, despite everything, wouldn’t be that. Then again, maybe he’s tricking himself. Maybe Steve would tear him apart.
“Oh,” Bruce says in that mocking way he has when the lid on his temper loosens just enough. “So we’re taking cues from SHIELD now? Sorry, I mean Hydra.”
“Okay,” Tony says, “while I’m sure your culinary skills are nothing to sneeze at, you just made food with Vision, who doesn’t actually ingest food. The traffic light was originally intended for robot-made smoothies, to tell if they were going to end me without offending the little guys.”
“Boss?” FRIDAY says. She’s got about as many trust issues as Tony himself, which is downright impressive, and he regrets it greatly. Where JARVIS was much more willing to listen to people Tony was close with—mostly Pepper and Rhodey, and even the other Avengers later on—he doesn’t know if FRIDAY will ever get to that point. Certainly not anytime soon.
The moment feels heavy, like they’re balancing on the edge of a precipice and neither of them makes that final step, but neither of them wants to go backwards. Or—Tony doesn’t. Maybe he’s just projecting.
“You were,” Tony says, surprised by the harsh bite in Steve’s words. He looks in time to see Steve stop walking entirely, hand clenched around a thin, lower-hanging branch. He actually rolls his eyes at Tony. “What? You were—even Nat was following your lead from the get-go. By the end of New York even
“Training room was helpful when there were, like, five of us but—team training with this many people…it would be good to run sims,” he says, making a show of trailing off with his own ideas, like he’s already mapping it out in his head—which, to be fair, he kind of is, but it’s about the reassurance, okay?
Vision brings her a coffee in a cardboard cup and she takes it in shaking hands. Rhodey’s phone vibrates in his pocket, and he takes it out and walks away, looking stiff but doing it anyway. Steve wonders if the braces get uncomfortable with continued use.
The man’s lips don’t even twitch. Tony’s respect for him skyrockets, and he kind of wishes he’d bothered to hear the man’s name.
“Tell ya what,” Bucky says, looking back to Steve, “you let ’em get an X-ray and I’ll personally help you fight your way into Tony’s room.”
Tony looks over at Scott, surprised he doesn’t already know. They’re on a team together; Tony should know this. To be fair, Scott’s one of the only ones who doesn’t rely on Tony for his gear, and Tony suspects Pym would set the world on fire if Scott showed him the suit technology, but the point still stands. Teamship and camaraderie and all that jazz. Tony knows he’s been up his own ass a bit since Siberia and even more so since the team came back, but this just highlights why he needs to work harder at getting over it. He can’t afford to not know this stuff.
Steve’s in there, too. He can hear the other man’s breathing (which is creepy on a couple different levels), but he could be asleep for all Tony’s knows.
“I can’t sleep,” Tony says again, stiffly, mechanically. Something snaps back into place, then, like a rubber band recoiling. “I
“The situation was dire,” she says. “The boss’s condition was rapidly nearing the point of no return. As a last-ditch effort, a contingency was triggered and a version of the Extremis virus was injected.”
Soon enough, they’re calling out any feature they can think of, Tony throwing in specs when something catches at the corner of his brain and Steve offering simulation scenarios as they go.
Nobody so much as breathed on their way out, but Tony could feel the movement all around, hear the fabric against the furniture, the creaking of joints, the whir of Bucky’s arm as he levered himself up. He waited a little desperately for it to end, glad for Steve. Then there was cloth, soft cloth, being settled around him, over him.
“G’night,” Steve mumbles back, and Tony smiles at the foot of the bed, turning the brightness down on the tablet.
Steve holds out a hand to help Natasha up. She takes it, but lets go the moment she’s upright under her own power again.
Part of Tony insists this is factual and that he was right to be mad. But, no. Right to be insecure, maybe, but Steve’s put a lot of work into reassuring him as well.
Good, Tony thinks, even though it’s not. He hates how much control he doesn’t have here, how helpless he seems to always be in the face of this man, this haunting come to life, preserved in the ice for decades just to come back and torment him, obviously. Because the universe can’t give him any kind of break. (Narcissist, his brain sings in his own ear. That ego again.)
“I just—I make sure we’re all protected. You’re the one who makes sure we’re protecting others out there,” he says, feeling like he’s choking, like his world is reorienting itself again.
Tony trades places with Wanda after a little while and falls into an easy rhythm. Extremis is good and Tony feels efficient and sharp and the team runs smoothly. The bots are resilient, but not invulnerable, and it’s surprisingly satisfying to be fighting non-living combatants. Giving in to reckless abandon and smashing them to pieces with only the guilt of lost engineering beauty is refreshing, to say the least.
He looks exhausted, weary, and Tony figures it’s at least partially his own fault. Steve’s smile twists then, and he blushes and, wow, really, even in the almost-total-darkness Tony can see it, the flush of color starting under Steve’s cheekbones and spreading to the tips of his ears, more purplish than red through the filter of dark around them and it’s actually scientifically incredible that Tony can see as much detail as he can now. Most people, he realizes, won’t ever get to experience colors at night like he is now, like he can now, whenever he wants.
Tony doesn’t want to fight. Nobody alive would take him seriously if he said so, but this is the thing:
He totters up, uncoordinated from sleep and keeping his one hand occupied wiping at his chin, and goes to look at Sam’s phone where Steve’s holding it (Sam passed it off as he slowly crumpled to the floor, out of breath from laughing at something Tony doesn’t think is really all that funny).
“I’m sure it’s a foreign concept to you,” Steve says lightly. He moves their still-joined hands then, down below his chin to where they don’t muffle his words. His voice loses the playfulness when he continues, “It’ll take time, Tony.”
Tony was aware enough this time that he noticed when Steve picked up his phone and typed out a message. He could’ve probably just asked FRIDAY, but Tony strangely appreciated the thought.
Tony’s disgusted to find he can hear clearly, even from this distance, even over the sounds of explosions and shouting.
“You’re terrible,” Tony tells him, but softens it with what he hopes comes across as a sincere smile. “The worst.”
“You’re just as—” It’s actually visible; Tony can see Steve twirling an emotion lasso above his head and reigning in his words, feelings, all of it. “You know what? No. I’m not going to
“Okay,” Steve says. He glances over at Tony like he wants to say something, but changes his mind. Tony lets it go and rolls his window down a crack. Wind roars through the car and stirs up the air. Steve glances over again, then looks back at the road quickly, which is frustrating because Tony knows the man doesn’t even need to look at the road to drive this stretch safely, and he wishes Steve would simultaneously drop it and spit it out.
“’Course it was,” Bucky mumbles, arms crossed, but even Tony can tell he’s fighting a smile. Steve rolls his eyes.
It’s probably rude to let Steve clean up his mess, but Tony doesn’t protest, just turns and walks away, his face burning from some kind of emotion he certainly doesn’t want to be feeling.
this self-sabotage thing where he just forgets about some of his teammates. He sees Bucky shift his weight out of the corner of his eye.
“Come on, Steve,” she says, sounding just as weary as Bruce had looked. “He didn’t even know Wanda was on the team, let alone the way the entire team self-combusted while he was away.”
Deep breath, he tells himself, and assesses. His arm is bleeding, he thinks still, and his collarbone may or may not be broken. Neither of those are life-threatening, not unless his collarbone is really fucked up, anyway. He doesn’t think it is, though. His neck still rotates, and he can move that arm. Nothing’s numb, at least. Which he admits kind of sucks, but is also a good sign. Another deep breath, and he flicks his comm back on, making his way back onto the street slowly.
He puts his phone down, under his thigh on the couch, and returns to his tablet to work on a new design for Clint’s arrows. It’s been too long since he’s had an upgrade, and with some of the tech he implemented into Spider-Man’s uniform he thinks he can make them smaller while still packing the same punch. Hawkeye’s great to have in the field, but Tony’s also secretly glad for the never-ending dilemma of the-archer-always-runs-out-of-arrows. If it comes down to it, and it always does, Tony’s got something to work on.
He looks about as confused as Steve feels. He sweeps his gaze over the rest of the team, noticing Natasha’s pinched mouth and Clint’s narrowed eyes, the way his hand inches towards his quiver. It’s Wanda, though, who steps forward and puts her hands up threateningly.
It goes all the way through his spine, that word, like intravenous nostalgia. He might flinch at the sound.
Tony, Steve, Wanda, Clint, Sam, and the Hulk are staying behind to keep fighting and keep the way clear for the others. Tony knows it’s a different kind of portal, there’s no nuke, hell, this isn’t even New York, but he’s never been happier to be one of the least stealthy Avengers. Happy pings to ask if they need the spider kid, but Tony gives him a firm negative, tells him to get the kid back home. There are so many reasons Tony could end up in hell, but bringing Peter into this fight isn’t going to be one of them.
Tony’s definitely not watching out of the corner of his eye when Sam claps a hand to Bucky’s shoulder and pushes him all the way inside the kitchen.
As a threat, it’s not much, but she’s definitely letting Steve know who’s in charge here. It’s not him. Steve’s mouth is already half open to say something scathing about her use of the word “friend” (
Tony’s hit, in that moment, with the magnitude to which Steve has to be fine. Supersoldier, Tony tells himself. Of course he’ll be okay.
“It’s Tony,” Steve says, and stares at the wall opposite him. He wants to look at Bucky, to drink in the sight of him being awake and aware of himself, but it’s too much. He desperately wishes he hadn’t drank the water Sam pressed into his hand on the ’jet, because he thinks he might get sick for real this time. It feels like a forbidden comfort to have Bucky here when Tony literally used himself as a human shield to save Steve from a falling building. It feels like betrayal, again, right when he and Tony had agreed to talk things through.
Tony would flinch at how utterly fucking dumb that sounds out loud if he wasn’t so busy being breathless and terrified. To his dismay-slash-amusement, Steve snorts, honest-to-God snorts and pries Tony’s hand off his chest. But then he nudges Tony’s shoulder, enough to get him to turn back to the door and start walking back toward the stairs.
In short, HYDRA’s been ruining Tony’s life since he was 21 at least. And he didn’t even go looking for a fight with them, not like Steve did, across enemy lines wearing a target on his chest. And here Tony is anyway, giving Bucky permission to come to the compound. Because he understands that Bucky was used, was just a tool in all of this. Steve can’t ask any more from Tony, can’t take advantage of his kindness without realizing what it cost him. So Rhodey’s right, and Steve can’t expect them to be in the same room together, not now and maybe not ever. He’s going to have to be okay with that, because the situation isn’t fair to any of them.
And then there’s this woman. Tony doesn’t notice her until she’s practically under his nose. She’s fairly short, and wearing an expensive dress designed for someone of average height. He takes a step back but doesn’t offer his hand.
Tony breathes out in a rush. Clint’s followed him after all. He didn’t hear the door open, but that’s Clint’s voice, a good couple paces behind him, but he doesn’t turn around.
“We’re cooking for super-metabolisms,” Tony points out. “By the time we have enough food, someone’ll be awake to eat it.”
Still—he doesn’t actually move to stop Sam. He might say something sharp, but he won’t be cruel. (Baby steps.)
“Yeah,” Tony admitted, and he struggled to sit up on his own, but this chair really wasn’t meant for two people. He really must’ve been out; the rest of the team was already gone. “Sorry about decimating team night. I tried.”
i'll level with you guys: historically, i suck at writing action scenes. if something's unclear, i can almost guarantee it's because my writing is unclear. let me know so i can fix it! (once again, this entire fic is un-beta'd. i'm bound to miss something every now and again, and i'm very grateful for people who take the time to save me from that embarrassment.)
“I don’t mean money or things,” Steve says, and he hasn’t let it drop, but at least he’s let go of that
“Nat,” Tony whines because, come on, that’s playing dirty. Downright unfair. He turns the rest of his body into Steve, grabbing a fistful of his t-shirt and throwing a leg up over his hip, feeling ridiculously triumphant when Steve allows it. “Save some for me!”
Steve tenses, curling a leg up over Tony’s, and from here he can see Steve’s eyes squeeze shut. Tony brings a hand up to the short hairs at the end of Steve’s hairline, suddenly grateful he’s not confining himself to words to comfort Steve anymore.
She closes the gap between them and puts a hand on top of his. After a moment, he flips his hand and squeezes her fingers, eyes averted. She beats a hasty retreat seconds later, and Tony asks FRIDAY to scan the coffee, but it’s clean, and they both show up for breakfast the next morning, so it’s okay on some level. Rhodey’s in the city for physical therapy and Vision doesn’t eat, so Tony even appreciates the company.
“There’s a rubric draft on the tablets,” Tony says. “Read over it at some point. We’re taking suggestions and critiques until it’s hammered out to something we can all be happy with.”
This, Tony realizes, is about the time to bullshit his way out of this conversation or, hell, even just figure out why his girl called in the first place.  The silence goes on a beat too long before Tony finally opens his mouth.
“I’m going to fuck it up,” Tony had told him, eyes big and scared and hopeful. “I’m going to be gone too much for business and forget to come to bed and I’ll talk during the best parts of movies and—well, I probably won’t forget your birthday. Or, maybe I will, but c’mon, the Fourth of July? God, I’m probably going to forget your
“Hey there,” Sam says. He looks exceedingly even—every movement he makes seems like the kind designed to trick the body into calming down. He’s unhurried, purposeful, self-contained and
He goes through the files, adding his own notes here and there, and resolutely pretends that going back to the West Coast feels like going home.
“Of course.” Rhodey grins. It’s taken him a while to warm up to FRIDAY, but she likes Rhodey in a way she doesn’t like nearly anybody else. “I’m just saying that most people consider small personal crises to be emergencies, but you’ve been aware for a short time and seen some pretty extreme situations.”
“You’re bleeding,” he says again, popping the kit open and kneeling in front of Tony. Tony sits up and looks down at Steve as he sorts through the supplies. His hands are gentle the way Steve is always gentle, hyperaware of the serum, of the strength in even the very tips of his fingers. He doesn’t ask Tony if what he’s doing is okay, just gets to work because it needs to be done.
Tony hums, because—maybe. He’s unsure about that though. It makes sense that Sam would think so, military man that he is. At best, he thinks that might’ve been a strong enough anchor to keep them all level for the time it would’ve taken to make a game plan. Though, he’s not entirely convinced they wouldn’t have fallen to pieces even then.
He looks back down at Natasha, meets her eyes, and she looks just as startled as he feels. Eyes back on Steve, the fear only intensifies when he doesn’t say anything, doesn’t move.
Steve wrinkles his nose, eyes leaving Tony’s face to look down at their hands. His finger follows a path across his knuckles and Tony can’t see from this angle but he knows there’s a wicked scar there, one from his pre-Iron Man days, actually. Something from London, with cocaine and a downright terrifyingly dingy club. A man with gaudy rings and maybe broken glass, though he can’t recall which of those things actually cut his hand. He probably deserved it.
Contrary to popular belief, though, he can recognize when it’s not about him (sometimes). He sits quietly and doesn’t throw a tantrum and watches Steve even though he thinks seeing Steve here, like this, might break his heart a little more with every passing second.
“I know,” Steve says, a little calmer than before. There’s a brief pause where Tony feels like it’s his turn to say something, but he doesn’t have a clue as to what he’s supposed to say. Steve huffs out a laugh, looks away briefly, then back. “You’re the engineer, and I’m a field commander.”
“Anytime,” Steve says. He’s not sure if Tony hears him or not, but when he checks a few seconds later, Tony’s out like a light.
And shit, right. Tony though of how he must look from the outside and rushed to stop that in its tracks.
“Technically,” Steve says, “you made the right call. That doesn’t mean it didn’t make me sick to learn about it, or that the worry hasn’t been eating me alive.”
He flies straight at Steve, faster than he should, and tackles him. He senses more than feels the cracks coming from Steve’s lower ribs, the way his pelvis angles against his own shoulder. They skid across the ground hard, Steve screaming, the suit screaming, sparks flying. Tony covers Steve’s body with his own and braces himself; the building’s already crashing down on them. Steve’s still holding onto his shield somehow, and he flings it up and around so it’s covering both of their heads. Tony’s collarbone howls at the way his arms are braced, but he just swallows and clenches his teeth against it.
“And I should definitely take this SI trip off of Pepper’s plate and run off to Japan for a week and a half. Or until I forget everything about Steve.”
they do X, Y and Z, they should be allowed to engage the threat mindfully, following protocol, and still let the UN or appropriate authorities know. Basically, Tony sends back his general agreement and crosses his fingers.)
“Pizza for breakfast?” Tony blinks at the container of still-cold pizza. (Steve swears he’s not being rude, this is how Tony insists he likes his leftover pizza.)
“Listen,” Tony says, hushed now. Sincere. “If there’s one thing I can count on, it’s that anyone on this team would’ve done the same thing. There were civilians out there, and we’re all reckless idiots when it comes to stuff like that.”
“And you’re the one who saved their sorry asses from exile,” Steve says. He appreciates that Steve doesn’t tell him he’s wrong, or contradict him at all. And Steve’s right, too—Tony and Natasha were the driving force that made it possible for everyone to come home. It shouldn’t be such a stretch to think they’ll all at least work with them to make this team work, but. But that’s exactly what Tony thought before, on the first go around with the Accords. Look where that got him.
He tears apart his sandwich bit by bit as Pepper eats. He feels okay here, at peace. Something he hasn’t had near Pepper in a long while now. She’s gravity, just like she always has been, able to corral him just by existing near enough to him to draw him in.
The thing is, Tony really, really doesn’t want to go upstairs and stare at food while his ex-ex-teammates stare at him. The thought of a movie makes it almost bearable because at least that promises minimal social interaction. Plus, he can’t help but mock himself internally: isn’t this what he wanted? For the Avengers to be together?
Tony throws the kernels in with the oil and gets out a stick of butter. He can hear the previews coming from the TV, and it doesn’t feel like they’re pretending nothing happened. He knows, more than anything else these days, that they’re both hyperaware of their shared history. It eats at Tony, and it seems to get to Steve just as much. He breathes, and gets out a couple bottles of root beer.
“A therapist,” Bruce begins, slipping his glasses off and pinching at the corners of his eyes, “is a professional you hire to listen to you talk about your life.”
“Working on it,” Tony grounds out. For some reason, Steve seems to relax at this, content to wait now that he knows it’s not a dead end exercise. Tony, in turn, relaxes, knowing he’s not being rushed, and starts to slowly put his thoughts into order.
The realization hits suddenly, crashing like a wave: he can’t lay here anymore, alone, thinking about it, or he thinks he really will go insane. He’s always been skilled at actualizing self-fulfilling prophecies.
“And what’s the protocol for missing the weekly meeting?” he asks, an eyebrow arched and only a little sarcastic.
“It feels like a third chance,” he admits. “Or—whatever number I’m on now.” He laughs, a quiet huff of self-deprecation.
“It’s a long story, but I really am alive,” Tony says, and smiles when he catches Steve’s eye. “Promise. Just breathe, ’kay?”
“Please,” Tony says. “If a mass of space debris were heading for earth, we’d be the ones stopping it.”
They eat what Rhodey calls “actual breakfast,” meaning Tony makes coffee and Rhodey fries up eggs and bacon. Rhodey eats his with tabasco and Tony with just salt and pepper. It’s more delicious than it has any right to be. Rhodey laughs at him when he goes for seconds.
The rest of the ride passes with Steve panting and the EMTs asking questions that seem to slip over Steve’s brain like water, nothing soaking in. The EMTs don’t seem frustrated or particularly panicky over it, though Tony doesn’t know how much of that is them trying to keep Steve calm, how much is them trying to keep Tony calm. They ask, and wait, and ask again if Steve doesn’t say anything. He gets a couple of them, says slightly irrelevant things to some of them, but mostly he doesn’t answer, and after a couple of tries, the ambulance worker will look to Tony for an answer.
“I know,” he says, because he does. There’s only one place he’s ever seen her in need and left her, and it’s late enough now that she could’ve been to bed already and been woken by the violence in her own mind. He knows, logically, that he’d been on the clock back there, but he truly wishes he could’ve damned the consequences and blown the RAFT to smithereens. He knows why he couldn’t do that, but reasons aren’t useful to Wanda right now. “I’m sorry that happened to you.”
“I’m not keeping anyone here,” Tony says to the room at large, taking a pointed look around. Natasha and Clint, for now looking relaxed and watchful, unbothered; Wanda, ramrod straight in her seat, meets his eyes with her head mostly ducked before glancing back at Clint; Sam, tenser than Clint or Nat, mouth set and determined; Vision, serene and contemplative; Rhodey, hand resting over his mouth, brow creased as things play out; Peter, the most visibly freaked-out, looking distinctly like he wants to help somehow but is hopelessly out of his depth; Steve, strung tight enough to snap between his jaw and shoulders, fists clenched, disappointment distinct in the twitching of the vein in his forehead; Bucky, awkwardly trying to hunch over like it’ll somehow make him smaller; Thor, who’s sometimes hard to read and who’s been almost astonishingly quiet so far in the meeting, frowning thoughtfully; and Scott, mildly twitchy and doing his best to hide it. Tony lets his mind catalogue even as he continues speaking.
During their talk, the fighting continues. Everyone’s splitting their attention to hear what Thor’s saying—except the Hulk, who doesn’t seem to care—and Steve stays close enough to pick up his every word. The pauses are too long between one person speaking and another starting, they’re all switching focus from their surroundings, their enemies, back towards their strategy.
“God, no, wait,” he says. Bruce pauses, mouth still half open, and Tony says, “Jesus, I’m bad at this. Sleep, you.” He makes a vague shooing gesture at Bruce as his science bro’s face melts from shock to amusement. “We’ll have a science party later.”
It’s a pleasant, productive kind of solitary, with the life of the city humming all around him, and he takes the opportunity to pause and think. About what he wants from the team this time around, about what he might want from this thing he can feel between himself and Steve.
“That’s fair,” Natasha says. He can’t tell if she believes him or not. Surely the world-renown super-spy should be able to tell when a billionaire’s drunk off his rocker. Then again, he’s always been a showman and an exceptional liar. And this? This is his trademark lie, the one where he’s three sheets to the wind and giving keynote speeches.
“FRIDAY,” Tony says, because what else can he do, “unlock the joints as soon as there’s room to move.”
“We’re gonna put on a movie, I think,” Steve says with his stupidly sad eyes, looking like Tony’s just hurt him or some shit. It makes him want to growl and hiss, but he can see the effort Steve’s putting in here. Why now, he wants to ask. Why put in so much effort now when he put in barely any before the Accords? When Tony’s mouth opens again, it’s just as automatic as the last reply.
We’re here now, Tony thinks. That’s gotta be worth something, after everything that’s happened, right?
“I know things got bad there with the Accords,” Steve continues, “and they’re still bad because of it, but I didn’t design any of it. Christ, I’m so sorry I hurt you. I’m sorry I made you think I would ever do it on purpose.”
Steve still looks like he thinks it’s Christmas morning, but he’s starting to look wary, too. Bucky looks flat-out confused, and Tony can feel himself getting tenser by the moment. He’s annoyed with Steve for looking at him like that, pissed at himself that he’s getting more on edge and playing right into Steve’s expectations, and maybe just a little pissed at Steve for so obviously trying to walk on eggshells, trying not to look too happy, or say something that could be taken as critical. Fuck it, he thinks.
“Come on, guys,” he says through the suit’s speakers, hovering a dozen feet in the air and drawing their attention away from a woman and her Dalmatian. “You destroy a piece of fine American culture like this and my CEO will have my head.”
The thought’s like a shot of espresso. He needs to see everything, catalogue it, not waste this—second, third, eighty-sixth—chance.
“There’s nothing,” Bruce says, hand closed tightly around Tony’s wrist, keeping it away from the needle. Tony always forgets how strong Bruce can be in this form too. “It’s just for hydration, there’s nothing in it.”
Despite the interrupted sleep, Tony wakes early. Earlier than Steve anyway, if the way his hand rises and falls with someone else’s deep breaths is anything to go by. He takes his time waking, floating just on the edge of consciousness where everything is slow and peaceful and uncomplicated.
“Not all of us were here when you fell to pieces, Cap,” Bruce says. It’s still cool and cutting, matter-of-fact.
“Who do you think I am?” Vision asks back. “This is the long game. I’m merely fostering his false sense of superiority.”
“Your rent’s late,” he says. Not his wittiest comeback, but he’s still waking up. Hasn’t even had coffee yet. Bruce smiles softly either way, and Tony remembers why he likes the man so much.
Tony thinks it’s no wonder the two of them never managed the easy openness she had with the others. Between his trust issues and acting abilities and her untrustworthiness and constant vigilance, it’s a miracle they’ve managed “grudgingly respectful teammates” for so long.
So, Steve paces, and he watches the door, and paces some more until his stomach clenches and clenches and he has to stop and huff a breath. He presses one finger against the healing cut along his collarbone just to feel that there, that feeling, that pulling, that’s where his skin ends, that’s his border. That’s where his body stops, just like always, no matter what his brain is trying to tell him. His hip hurts now, and he wants to ask for some more painkillers, but if he takes them now he’ll fall asleep, he knows he will. So he paces.
“He, um. There was someone at school and she, uh, she saw a YouTube video from Chicago, and she was saying—well she was just, she was so sure you were dead, Mr. Stark, and I just—”
Tony’d been planning on lying insofar as he’d been planning on saying anything. Watching Sam fall on the other end of the couch, though, like his strings have been cut, like he’s exhausted, pulls the truth from him.
The medics go straight from questioning Steve to putting a neck brace on him to loading him into the ambulance, and then Clint’s nudging him forward and Tony’s opening his own mouth.
“It’ll need some adjustments before it’s ready for continued wear, obviously,” Tony says. He feels stiff—wooden. “Fri, flag R-6 through…13? Okay, sharp-shooter, we’ll just do a few checks and then I’ll take that back to work on some more.”
princess of Wakanda,” Tony corrects. “I owe her—damn, something nicer than a fruit basket. What can I send the genius princess of Wakanda that’s nicer than a fruit basket but not creepy?”
“No, really,” Tony says, and it’s as good as an admission. “Cap’s only about half-asshole, and he’s definitely half-angelic, just not with me. Besides, he’s hot as hell. Peak of human perfection and all that. You saying you wouldn’t tap that?”
“Coffee’s a viable breakfast, but thanks,” Tony says. Clint puts the box back down and takes a quick drink of his own coffee.
“Solid,” he finally says with a final flick of his wrist, sending the image spinning, spinning, spinning. “You’re building him an arm?”
The starting code is sleek, efficient. It almost looks callous, even to Tony. JARVIS would’ve understood what Tony’s doing. He thinks even Vision would get it, at a fundamental level, but Vision doesn’t always get why some things should be kept a secret. The man-kid-android is bluntly honest, which Tony both appreciates and has to be aware of.
“Eh,” Tony says noncommittally, which means he’s still devastated. “It is what it is. Just thought I’d ring-a-ding and wish you a happy ninety-ninth.”
If Pete can actually manage to avoid honorifics with Steve, Tony will eat his own shoe. Still, it’s a nice gesture.
He thinks of Pepper when they were together, and her hand on his shoulder as they lay side-by-side was enough on the better days to signal to his brain that he was safe-home-happy. He thinks of JARVIS obliging Tony after Afghanistan, how he would start dictating old theoretical work at him, always with a twist—
“No,” Bruce says. “What in God’s name—you both—you and Steve tore everything to shreds because, what. You were jealous? Because you couldn’t figure out how to deal with your sexual tension like a human being?”
Steve's fine. Tony knows this. Of course Steve’s fine. The only reason they’re still here is so the hospital can cover their own ass. God forbid something happen, that they let Captain America loose with a brain bleed on Tony Stark’s watch.
He’s sitting on the love seat next to Natasha, and they don’t normally instigate any kind of meaningful touch, but they don’t shy away from it, either. Her knee is on top of his thigh and their forearms rest on each other occasionally. Sitting close to her, feeling comforted but not coddled, he can admit to himself that he feels rotten, like he doesn’t belong, unwanted in his own goddamn house. If Nat can feel how tense he is, she doesn’t say a thing, but she does sing along to “Everybody Wants to Be a Cat.” Scott joins in and Sam buries his face in his hands and groans through the whole thing, but Tony keeps his eyes on the TV and his mind on Natasha’s fingers where they tap against his hand and thinks, she came home first, all on her own. Maybe she doesn’t mind Tony’s presence so much as the others.
“Are you kidding me?” Tony asks, and Steve’s shoulders loosen, the exact opposite of what he’d been expecting. He still looks dejected, but also sympathetic. “You didn’t have a problem with it in Siberia, when it was—”
“I can’t sleep,” Tony says. His brain feels like a leaky faucet. That’s all he can say, he’s so goddamn tired he just wants to
“Viz,” Tony says easily. “Nat keeps showing up and leaving again. We have breakfast together about once a week. The spider-kid’s down in the city, so I’ve seen him around.”
“Green, boss,” FRIDAY says, unprompted. Tony’s proud somewhere underneath all the relief; she's a faster learner than JARVIS was at the beginning, but then again, she was born into a bigger shitshow. He pulls the blueberries closer and starts fixing his plate.
“Uh-huh,” he says, and he sounds a little dazed. Tony can’t tell if it’s because he’s coming down from an anxious spiral or because he’s talking to Captain America. Probably both, because Peter.
Tony goes from lightly touching Steve’s side to smacking his shoulder and cackling at the state of the floor.
“No!” Tony says. “I’m not gonna be your self-fulfilling prophecy, Rogers. You want a reason to fuck up the entire team we just brought back together? You can have Barnes back!”
Steve remembers Extremis. It was part of the whole Mandarin mess that first Christmas they all knew one another. Mostly, Steve remembers seeing Tony’s house being bombed on the news and hearing
“Captain,” Wanda says a few minutes later, “advise. I have a man here—human, but he appears to be…infected, somehow.”
“We should be set for the weekend,” Tony says. He glances over to make sure Pete’s got his backpack, which looks like it’s bulging enough to have his weekend stuff with him.
“So you just called to say hi, then?” Tony teases. He leans back and scoots around until his back is propped up by the bathtub and his legs are loosely criss-crossed in front of him. “Are those big, mean Avengers neglecting my poor baby?”
Tony picks up the banana with the hand not holding the water bottle. It’s a promise to try. He’s not going to eat it at this moment. Water first, and then he’ll give the banana a go. It occurs to him that he should say that out loud, but Natasha hardly needs him to spell it out. The silence is fine for now. Tony’s so busy breathing through the nausea that he doesn’t notice if it’s awkward. Every few breaths, he takes a sip. The rhythm of the whole thing is soothing.
“Well, you see,” Steve says, the frown disappearing under an unsure smile, “I don’t sleep as often as most people. Which I suppose you don’t either, now. But. Three days without feeling tired is pushing it, even for me.”
Tony thought seeing everyone again would be a lot of things: maddening, tense, a struggle, painful. He was prepared for all of those things. He’d been feeling all of those things since crawling back to the near-empty Avengers compound to lick his wounds.
“I trust you—I’m trying to trust you, but the point is that at the moment, it didn’t occur to me that I maybe shouldn’t. So.” In through the nose, out through the mouth. He tossed the banana peel into the trash can. “A step in the right direction.”
“Since you woke up?” Steve repeats, and when Tony focuses on his face again he’s frowning deeper. “But it’s been—”
“So,” Steve says, and then he pauses to laugh even though it feels hollow. “A sound strategic decision?”
“Shh,” Steve says, and briefly rests his hand on top of Tony’s head (even though his hair is admittedly disgusting). “Right back, okay?”
“Feel free to call,” Tony says. Steve wishes he could help the hope that blooms in his chest at that, the expansion is almost painful, and Steve knows this never ends well for him. “Or text. Phones work both ways these days, you know.”
note: addition of the "food issues" tag. it's not too bad, but if that sort of thing is hard for you, just be aware
“Fine,” Rhodey says, and takes the screwdriver away from Tony. “A couple of your house goblins went all the way down to the city in a jet just to get saag from that place in Queens.”
The joke falls on deaf ears, but Steve curls into him, around him. The crown of his head presses into Tony’s nape. Steve’s hair would probably tickle if they weren’t both sleep-warm and if Tony wasn’t still fuzzy with sleep. All it is is soft.
And Tony rolls onto his back, lacing his fingers with Steve’s. He’s still hypersensitive, but the stars are clear above them. It’s not difficult to find Aquila again, and he finds himself staring. The eagle. Steve had spoken of Prometheus in the same offended tone he used when talking about Tony these days. It makes him wonder who Steve thinks he is in this scenario—surely not Aquila? Zeus, maybe. Tony could picture that, especially if he was feeling vindictive towards Steve or lenient towards Zeus.
He starts a pot of coffee and pokes around in the fridge, snatching the remains of a frozen pizza to take with him. The muscles in his hand don’t cramp when he grabs both coffee mugs with it and the plate in the other hand, and his balance is impeccable. He hands one off to Bucky. Tony takes a seat in the armchair adjacent to Bucky’s couch, puts his coffee on the end table so it can cool, and puts the plate on his lap so he can start eating.
“Okay," Steve says, voice softly surprised. His blunt fingernails scritch gently against Tony’s back through his layered shirts, and Tony blows out a breath.
“Nifty,” Tony scoffs, but it’s true. And his heart’s about tied with his liver for Most Thankful Organ. Just that alone has probably added decades onto his life expectancy. It’s astounding. But these aren't exactly things he wants to admit to in front of so many people, even if one of them’s out like a light.
“I get it,” he says, to no one in particular. “This is payback for all the times Pep had to make sure I didn’t choke on my vomit, right? Very funny.”
“Tony,” she says softly, and she looks hesitant now, in the way her chin ducks, confused in the pinch between her eyebrows. “You look good.”
Bruce looks even more tired than he did the last time he passed by, and Steve would offer him a chair, but Scott came back with an entire cart of coffee and took the last one.
“So,” Sam says, when they’re about three floors from the living quarters, “you sticking around this time or flying off in the dead of night?”
“Anytime.” And of course it sounded like a vow coming from Steve Rogers’ lips. It wasn’t, Tony told himself fiercely. Steve was a person, and he spoke in words, not vows; this had been a problem for them before.
“Morning,” Wilson says, and his movements lose the hesitance as he starts filling up his plate in earnest. “What’s all—this?”
“Well,” Rhodey says, deadpan, “you better keep it up then.” A smile breaks through his expression then. “The heart is a muscle and all that.”
It seems so out of left field that Tony has to take a minute to untangle the meaning of the words, and even after he’s done that he still feels like he’s taken a wrong turn somewhere.
“Also not mandatory, though highly encouraged,” Tony says, rolling right along (maybe he’s going too fast here, plowing through, but he’s got to ride the momentum while nobody’s fighting, before they start taking sides), “are team bonding nights. Which you can blame Cap for, please, his idea, I don’t even want the credit there.”
He takes a drink from his own cup—something with whipped cream and sprinkles, Tony knows, though it’s all hidden beneath the lid—as he surveys Steve’s sleeping form and looks back to Tony.
He hasn’t thought it in years, at least not so concretely, so front-and-center, but it pops up, unbidden: What would Mom think? The Maria Tony likes to remember would probably just give him a hug, one hand cradling his skull and one hand and squeezing his neck. She would call him “bambino,” even at this age, and she would tell him not to carry the weight of the world like this.
Tony and Sam have never been the closest by any stretch of the imagination, but they’ve definitely become more familiar this time around. Sam’s not being quite as chipper as he normally is, either a product of the late hour or—as Tony suspects—he’s dialed down his emotive output.
It occurs to Tony that Steve could probably snap him like a twig caught up in his own mind like this. He remembers Pepper’s hand on his shoulder, the insistent shaking, the terror of reliving the worst moments of his life melting into the reality of almost hurting her, of calling the suit on her in his sleep. So, okay, he probably shouldn’t shake Steve. Maybe. Steve’s nightmares are probably different than his own, but that doesn’t really give Tony a clue as to how to stop this. But this really, really needs to be stopped.
“I didn’t even know the RAFT existed,” he admits in a rush of breath. “I didn’t have a finger in that pie, V, I didn’t even know the goddamn pie was there.”
“Or something,” Steve echoes. And then he smiles, wry and a little confused. “Strange,” he muses, looking down at their hands on his chest. “When did you get here? I must’ve zoned out.”
He knows, intimately, the string of events that led to them all falling out, not trusting each other, choosing sides. He even understands some of them. But that doesn’t mean he knows why it happened. Sure, he can point to a hundred different points in the past few years where he could’ve made a decision differently, altered their course—but he doesn’t know why they needed to happen except in retrospect. He’s given his heart, body, mind—all of it—to the Avengers. His health, his relationship, all cut open on the altar to a team of people who thought he was an arrogant, selfish bastard. He wants it to work—the world
It’s quiet for so long that Tony actually does pull the phone away from his ear to make sure he hasn’t been hung up on. When he sees the call is still connected he decides to wait Steve out. It’s another thirty seconds before he gets anything.
Steve’s smile has shrunk, and he looks sad, but not overly so. Tony doesn’t know if this means he struck the balance or not.
“Thank you, o, diplomat extraordinaire.” Steve smiles at her, pained and small but real. She grins back tiredly.
and suddenly his stool’s tipping over and he’s scrambling so he doesn’t fall on his face. In that moment, his grief for JARVIS crashes into him full force, even though Vision’s right upstairs, even though he has FRIDAY now to help him out, even though he has U and DUM-E here in the shop, even though the entire team has returned, plus some, even though Pepper and Rhodey are still alive, and Peter’s safe in his little apartment in Queens with his aunt, and—and just how much can Tony want out of life? This is so much more than he should be able to have anyway, so much more than he ever expected—just how
And of course there’s an IV in the crook of his arm; Tony doesn’t know why he didn’t place that with the tingling not-numbness earlier. Not today, Satan.
Tony walks into the kitchen wearing some designer t-shirt with a pug on it and a blazer over top. It’s too early for even Steve and Sam to be awake, but Clint’s sitting, fully dressed, at the island with an open box of cereal.
Wanda’s not awake yet, so Vision is on the couch in a semicircle with Clint and Natasha. He’s wearing the perturbed expression he usually adopts when human nature doesn’t follow logic, so Tony decides to leave them be.
Tony thought Steve would sit by Bucky, but nobody seems shocked or uncomfortable by the arrangement. In fact, Tony hasn’t seen them together once, but, to be fair, he hasn’t seen much of anyone except at breakfast this morning. He wonders what that’s about, but doesn’t dare ask.
“I’m making waffles,” he declares. Sam whoops and Clint trudges into the kitchen like a man on a mission, mumbling about the army needed to feed a super soldier, Vision trailing in his wake.
“There’s always one,” Steve says mournfully. “First thing I learned coming out of the ice: people are willing to do incredibly stupid things to get a good video.”
The door cracks open twenty-some minutes after Tony sent out the room number, and Clint slips in with a backpack and two Starbucks cups.
“Jesus, who do you guys think I am?” Tony asks. And then, before anyone can actually answer that question (yikes), “Barnes has been pardoned as well, but it’s up to him if he wants to remain in cryostasis. Though, maybe we should, I dunno, wake him up to let him know his options.”
Vision walks Wanda to her room, now that Clint is more or less in the clear. Scott goes off to his room to call his girlfriend once it’s late enough in the morning for that kind of thing. Someone gets Sam a pair of crutches and he and Thor leave long enough to get protein-heavy breakfasts for everyone remaining. Natasha and Bucky are the only ones who stay the entire time, but by the time Rhodey comes back, Vision, Thor, and Sam are there too. Rhodey looks determined, the face of a colonel on a mission. He stands by the wall and watches Steve pace until he catches on, pauses, and turns to face the other man head-on.
“It’s just your standard hey, if I happen to go bat-shit or spontaneously turn into an alien, you’d take me out before anyone got hurt, right?”
“Cap?” Tony says quietly, just barely over a whisper. All movement briefly pauses on the other side of the door, and then someone starts rustling around.
There’s a phone ringing suddenly. Shrilly and obnoxiously and Steve almost doesn’t realize that it’s his phone, the burner phone, until it’s too late. He thinks the TV, maybe, except Sam’s doing a crossword puzzle, the TV isn’t even on, and Steve’s out of the dining chair and vaulting over the couch to his room.
Tony rolls and performs a half-acrobatic move that frees the sheets. He lands underneath them, on his side facing Steve, one arm folded underneath his head. Still smiling and looking like he’s trying not to, Steve picks up one of the pillows from where they’re both stacked and flips it so it falls on Tony’s face as he crawls under the covers. By the time Tony has the pillow in place Steve’s settled. They’re facing each other, barely a foot between them.
“We’ve got some things to talk about,” he says bluntly, and shoots a smile Sam’s way when he snorts. “Namely, the structure of this team and functionality of day-to-day operations.
“Copy,” Steve says, and he sounds grim, like he understands the implications of what Tony just said.
and FINALLY, we have peter! my child, your child, tony's child. i know y'all have been waiting for this for a while. me too, man. me too
“Nothing too out there,” Natasha says, and Steve’s immensely glad he assigned her to Thor’s team. “Mutual protection from greater cosmic threats, no teaming up with anyone else against each other. That sort of thing.”
Tony says, watching Steve watch the trees. “Theoretically. But no, I’ve never been out here before. Not on the ground, anyway.”
Sure, Steve’s parents died when he was young too. He doesn’t remember his father much, but he can recall vividly how his mother slowly grew weaker and weaker, more and more sick over a course of weeks. A couple months ago he imagined it for the first time, what it would’ve been like to lose her suddenly, for her to just not come home as the stupid consequence of a careless action, like Tony thought for years, or as a meaningless sacrifice in a human-sized game of chess, like Tony learned all-too-suddenly in Siberia. It’s almost too much to bear. As it was, Steve got the time to say goodbye, to hold his ma’s hand and tell her he loved her and hear it said back. She said to him
“Everyone gets checked out by medical,” Steve says, and it sounds more weary than authoritative, but he must look bad enough that no one wants to start a fight because after a few grumbles, nobody protests for real.
“A true hardship, I know,” Steve teases, and Tony’s starting to smile despite himself, starting to feel the pull of hope despite himself.
Steve stands up gracefully and reaches both his hands down to Tony. Honestly, he’s a little stiff from sitting on the ground and his ass is sore from his less-than-gentle landing, so he lets Steve haul him up. They stand there for a second, hands clasped, but it’s not exactly a Moment; Tony’s ass really does ache, and he needs to take a couple breaths before he can clear his throat and drop his hands. Steve lets him go but holds out an elbow. Feeling slightly surreal about it, Tony links their arms together and gives the rest of the balcony shifty eyes.
The door cracks open, and then swings, and Steve’s stepping out and shutting it behind him. They’re facing each other, and Steve only pauses for a moment before he appears to accept the situation at face value.
There’s a stinging in Tony’s nose, behind his eyes. Steve always liked the sweeter coffee drinks. Tony finds them frankly disgusting, and he has no idea where Steve “lived through the Great Depression” Rogers developed the palate for it. He clears his throat.
“What,” Steve says. He glances back at the door that’s now behind him like he might decide to make a run for it anyway (he really might). “What the hell.”
Tony circles the room and talks like it’s a networking event, like he’s making up for lost time. He talks to everyone as if to say
“I built Bucky a new arm,” he admits miserably, finally retreating from his hiding place against Steve. Awkwardly, he shuffles back on the bed a few inches, his arm unwinding from around Steve. Steve’s own hand falls to be bed between them, and Tony grabs his wrist, needing to know Steve’s not turning frigid in dismissal, disgust, indifference.
He thinks it might be worrying. On the other hand, most people would throw their hands up and proclaim it a miracle, wouldn’t they? Tony snorts to himself and thinks it’s a little eerie, how loud the sudden sound is.
They end up, for just a moment, in the dark, the movie’s menu casting them in blue-white light, with Tony’s palm against the side of Steve’s head, holding him so that Steve’s head is pressed to Tony’s shoulder. One of Steve’s feet is curled up on the couch beside him, and Tony bets it’s uncomfortable. He lets Steve up after about thirty seconds there, and Steve just reaches for the remote and settles in with his shoulder pressed to Tony’s.
Instead of letting the moment become heavy, Tony makes a mental note to ask Bucky for embarrassing stories of tiny Steve.
Tony does. He makes about three-quarters of a pot, pours both cups, and sets Clint’s in front of him before speaking again.
“It's been days of basically no news about you, man,” Sam says. “It’s better to know nothing’s changed than to just sit around.”
“You’re right,” Steve says, and he sounds a little strangled. Then, calmer, “You’re right. It would save us all a lot of grief in the long run.”
“If you don’t mind,” she says. Bruce’s lips pull up in a polite smile and he holds one hand out, gesturing down the hall, and they walk away. Rhodey grunts as he trudges after them. He looks washed out, paler than he did before, and like he’s moving from ‘uncomfortable’ to ‘pained.’
“Rogers thought I was trying to…I don’t know. Make something up to him? Give him Barnes back as a conciliatory prize? You’d have to ask him.”
“Then,” Tony says, and he holds up his hands in an exaggerated shrug, “I don’t think you get to be mad at me about it.”
Steve doesn’t realized he’s paused to listen until the sound stops altogether. He turns and meets Bucky’s gaze for all of two seconds before they both take off down the hallway. There’s not even a guard at the door anymore and Steve thinks, we’re gonna make it, nobody’s going to stop us—
Steve wants to stand, offer his chair to Rhodey, but he doesn’t think Rhodey and Pepper want to be far from one another right now. That, and Steve’s not entirely sure he can get up at the moment; he’s been sitting so long his muscles have stiffened up. He feels leaden. So Steve stays where he is, and Rhodey’s braces clank against the metal arm of Pepper’s chair as he leans his thighs against it.
“Next time I’m getting a contract written up.” Bucky blinks his eyes like he’s rolling them behind closed lids, but he reaches a steadying hand forward when Steve slides off the exam table anyway.
“I’m not quite sure I want to know how it went,” Tony says faintly. He can hear it this time, how Steve takes a deep breath before speaking.
Turns out Steve hates root beer. They have to pause the movie two minutes in when Steve takes a swig without looking and then struggles not to spit it out in the popcorn. Tony watches in horrified silence as Steve bolts to the kitchen to spit it in the sink and wash out his mouth, and then he laughs for ten minutes straight, even after they turn the movie back on and Steve drinks three cokes to get rid of the taste in his mouth.
Tony raises his eyebrows and casts a pointed look at the food in what he hopes comes across clearly as
It’s sweeter than another apology between them anyway. Or at least devoid of the sadness they seem to drag out of each other when they wallow in it.
“Sorry," Tony echoes. “If you can’t manage to talk about feelings and trauma with a licensed professional, should you really be allowed on a team of superheroes though.”
“Sure,” Scott says, holding his hands up placatingly, “they should be available, I’m not saying they shouldn’t.
The look on Steve’s face is horrible. It’s like Tony’s kicked Barnes in the face (again) but also like Steve’s trying to make light of it or something, like the smile people always get right before they burst into tears. Tony takes a long sip from his coffee, temperature be damned. He burns his entire tongue, but obviously is in need of the caffeine.
“This.” Tony gestures at Steve, and Steve only blinks back in confusion and for the love of everything holy, he really doesn’t get it, does he? “This thing, where you sabotage your entire life and everyone you care about for someone who isn’t even around.”
“And…mark!” he says. The red energy dissipates, and Tony steps forward as quickly as he can. He gets his arms around its torso and suddenly has the thing in a full nelson. Wanda takes a faltering step towards them, holds her outstretched hands closer together, and starts spooling out energy that wisps towards the thing’s head. It throws its head back, but it doesn’t connect, just narrowly missing Tony’s nose. The tail reaches up, but it’s not designed to reach its own back, probably a defense against sticking itself with the stinger. It takes a few seconds, but the tentacles start snaking backwards, alien flesh and ribbons of human arms clinging on. They wind up around Tony’s arms, around his neck. He knows Wanda’s working as fast as she can, that begging her to hurry up will only slow her down, but then the tentacles start squeezing like a python, and alerts start flashing red on the HUD.
“Okay?” Peter asks, and his voice absolutely trembles. “Are you—I mean, Ned heard. And I didn’t know and I haven’t heard from you and, and Happy didn’t answer the phone so I thought
“So sweet of you,” Tony said and didn’t bother telling Steve it really wasn’t necessary. Steve grabbed one and herded Tony into the elevator ahead of him.
“And we’re the only two up ’n about at such an ungodly hour,” Steve says, but he’s smirking now, eyes twinkling.
“Fri,” Tony says, triggering the release on the armor, “I want the equivalent of one of those bots collected and secured before the conveniently late cavalry arrives.”
“And a long time before that,” Tony confirms. “Anyway, I’ll show ya the in’s and out’s of the ol’ ox cart later, that backpack looks like it weighs seventy pounds.”
The bustle of people everywhere is almost overwhelming with Extremis in play. Only nearly, though. He can tell it would be easier to become overwhelmed like this, that panic might be a certain percentage more intense, but he thinks he can learn to exist within it, the same way he has at the compound. It’ll take some getting used to, just another reason to come down to the city more. Exposure therapy, or something.
Technically, Steve knows he has a master override as the leader of the Avengers, but he trusts Tony, he does.
“Dr. Stark,” T’Challa returns and Tony half chokes on his slice. Natasha pounds him on the back and T’Challa looks bemused.
“I didn’t think,” Bucky says, and then stops. Steve looks up and catches his eye only to find the genuine confusion Bucky’s radiating. “After the way it went down in Siberia, I didn’t think you’d be so worried about him.”
Quiet descends eventually, once the laughter runs its course, and a sharp stab of anxiety makes Tony want to flee. It’s a loaded kind of silence, holding its breath for something big. Tony’s spent most of his adult life molding himself into the kind of person a bedmate would never confess their love to, but that’s what this moment was designed for—confession, heavy and soft, reinforced. The anxiety bubbles over into terror when Steve rolls onto his side and wiggles down so his head is resting against Tony’s shoulder. Tony makes a show of breathing evenly and wills Steve to have mercy on him, even as Steve opens his mouth.
“Other than that, all I need from you is what I needed from the beginning. Read the Accords. Keep us together, like you said.”
Tony, personally, can’t keep in the laughter that explodes from his chest. Steve looks downright torn for another moment before the smile comes back with a shake of his head. Maybe it’s a little forced, but that’s what he gets for eavesdropping on someone else’s phone conversations.
“Good morning,” he says warmly, putting his book face-down on the arm of the chair to mark his spot.
“Um…” The scrunch between Steve’s eyes gets deeper briefly before smoothing out again. “I think so? I mean, I think that’s what I’m hearing, maybe.”
He doesn’t panic when he realizes. It’s pretty anticlimactic, really. It’s day thirteen in the new Malibu house, and he’s about halfway through setting up FRIDAY’s stuff in the second bedroom, just putting his tools away for the day, when he stops to think about it.
“Just updated him on some things,” she says. “I thought we’d try out that thing where we don’t lie to our teammates. Doesn’t seem to be doing anybody any good.”
also! i've decided that, since i don't have anyone beta reading this, if anyone takes the time to point out typos, continuity errors, etc., i'll show my gratitude by writing a short oneshot for whatever prompt you've got for me
“Good,” Tony says suddenly, and means it. “Because that lab? Yours. Always has been. It’ll still be there tomorrow, and the next day. At least until some baddie inevitably destroys that part of the compound, but there will always be
“Not worth the trouble,” he finally admits, looking sheepish about it and, yeah, Tony gets that. He takes a moment to contemplate his answer.
AVALON flashes through his mind, but he dismisses the idea right away (even if he does need to finish the finer points of the protocol), and he brings up the schematics for Barnes’ new arm. It’s almost complete, really, he’s just about ready to throw together a prototype, but Rhodey’s is always a welcome opinion.
“At least we don’t wake up this early,” Bruce says, sounding downright petulant. Tony beams, and goes to hide it behind his mug, because Bruce is taking his side.
“I’m not caffeinated enough for this,” Rhodey declares, and then he gets up and walks out of the room. He comes back a couple minutes later with two mugs of coffee and sets one in front of Tony.
So, Tony knows what he needs to do and he knows why he has to do it. He figures that now is as good a time as any to do it, while he has this strange privacy. Because he may not be a stranger to his own mortality, but it has a tendency to weird other people out when he confronts it like this. Acknowledging the fact that you’ll die one day is fine if you do it quietly in the back of your mind and if you don’t bring it to anyone else’s attention. Planning for it is another matter entirely. Pepper cried when she figured out how often he updates his will.
“No,” Steve agrees, even-keeled across the table. He’s all calm leader, voice determined and solid, the kind of overly level that can make Tony rage when it’s directed at him. “It’s about us being so deeply damaged we didn’t think to reevaluate how the team was being run after SHIELD fell. It’s about the fact that some of us fought each other fiercely at the first sign of conflict, and that we splintered apart, and that we disintegrated under the first hint of pressure.”
“Me too,” Steve says quietly, but he’s smiling now, so wide his eyes crinkle at the corners and, really, there’s not a hint of—
“So,” he says, sitting down with his own mug. “The plates in the shoulder are too wide, it’s gonna fuck the entire range of motion.”
“No,” he says, and Steve lowers himself from his elbows and lays properly on the concrete of the roof. Tony does the same, resting his hands on his stomach.
“You won’t, okay?” Steve says. “That’s my promise of the day. You’re not going to go insane, you’re not going to murder anyone. Not another Avenger, and not an innocent bystander. I swear to God. And not because I’m going to stop you, or take you down, or whatever other euphemism you pick.”
“No,” Tony says quickly, before Steve can start another half sentence or dig them any deeper into this conversation Tony doesn’t even want to be having. “All I know is what you did.”
“That’s it?” Tony whispers. Steve tugs the knot of their hands closer and rests one of Tony’s knuckles against his own nose, and Tony scoots just a little closer to ease the awkward angle his arm is at. When Steve exhales, Tony can feel it down the side of his hand like a ripple of water.
Civilians first—he has some semblance of duty, still. He may not dream of Yinsen much these days, but his voice echoes whenever Tony’s making these kinds of decisions. Children first-first if there’s a choice, and then anyone else unlucky enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time or stupid enough to be filming on their phones.
“Mm,” Steve says disagreeably—hell, it’s almost petulant, but he’s asleep again on the next breath, and Tony doesn’t know how really awake he was at all.
“Oh, my God,” Tony says, shoving Steve’s shoulder none-too-gently as they ride up. Steve gives in and laughs his full-body laugh, the real one. “You’re the worst, Rogers. The—wow.” He clutches at his chest.
From Steve, he wants—well. He wants. That’s the first thing to establish. There’s definite desire there, and more than just lust, it’s actual, real romantic desire. And lust. He wants the closeness, and the falling asleep, and the intimacy, and the honesty—all the things that have been building up. And he’s enough of an adult to be able to admit to himself that he wants other things too. Not necessarily more, but those other avenues of expression. He wants to take every avenue he’s allowed in this instance, though he has no idea which are open to him, or which might be closed. Hell, he’s getting ahead of himself. He doesn’t even know if Steve swings that way. His past devotion to Bucky would suggest so, though the fact that they don’t seem to be an item now suggests that Steve might just be that ridiculously intense about platonic entanglements.
They’re instating weekly meetings, too. A place where team members can bring up issues they’re having, where Tony can tell them what he knows, where mission plans can be shared and backup requested.
“I’m gonna kill him,” Rhodey says low, under his breath, pacing more obviously now. Steve registers that he means Tony, not Clint. “No, shit, if this is still happening when Pep gets here all I have to do is not stop her—I can’t believe—”
“’Course not,” Sam says easily, and at least he’s loosening up a little. “Must be thinking of the other bundle of nerves leading this team.”
“He’s right,” Rhodey says then, leaning forward to brace his elbows on the table and link his fingers together, eyes on Wanda. There’s not a lot of heat in his voice, though—a man remembering the aura of weakness around the whole idea of psychologists and help. “Therapy’s about emotional help, sure. But it’s also about mental clarity and decision making.” His eyes flicker from Scott to Bruce then. “In one way or another, we all had a hand in the dissolution of this team—myself included—and it doesn’t come back together, not for real, unless we all put just as much work to fix it.”
“Okay, point,” he concedes. When he turns around, Steve’s still facing him, his back to his gathered ingredients. “And if you’re afraid we’ll fight, you can always email me your questions.”
He still looks freaked out, but Tony’s immensely glad his name comes out clearly. He moves around the doctor and grabs onto Steve’s hand, sweeping his thumb back and forth.
And then the medical team’s there, and someone tells Steve he has to move, and then there are hands on Steve’s shoulders and he really does move. Tony makes a sound when Steve’s hand leaves his hair and, oh, did he say his heart broke before, because he must’ve been wrong then. This is what it feels like.
“Pretty good, all things considered,” he says, grimacing at Tony’s plate. “Dude, that is unnecessary and hurtful. I promise it’s edible.”
“I’m working on it,” Tony says, because he will be at least. He can figure this out. If nothing else, they’re finally in the position to bargain for Barnes’ freedom. Sure, they might have to negotiate on some of the points they agreed on for the amendments, but Tony thinks they can probably get everything eventually.
“Yeah, yeah, no, of course,” Tony says. Sam’s reaction isn’t out of place, they’ve only really been texting each other memes for a couple weeks now. “I just wanted to make sure Cap was doing alright.”
“You’re from New York?” Steve says without thinking. There’s a moment where Steve blinks, his entire center of gravity shifting the slightest bit, before Tony responds.
“I like being at your side, and knowing you have my back,” Steve continues. He lets go of the branch and looks so vulnerable, unmoored, breathless. He looks about as terrified as Tony’s starting to feel. “I’m a better person when we’re on the same team, and I—can’t stand myself when we’re not. I don’t want to be the version of me that stood against you anymore.”
It’s only a few seconds later when sleep really leaves him that his skin starts buzzing and goosebumps start spreading. It’s going to be a long day. The knowledge settles somewhere deep within his bones, and normally (pre-Extremis) would be accompanied by a physical ache. All there is now is anxiety zipping through his marrow like electricity, and a desire to bury his head in the sheets so he doesn’t have to deal with it.
It’s about checking, maybe. Though Steve’s not a machine he can run a diagnostic on, he’s not a robot to be put through the ringer to test his strength. Not an AI or a bot. But that’s not entirely right. After all, how often has Tony reminded himself, rather forcefully, that Steve’s a man, not some golden soul in a perfect body? Steve Rogers, not Captain America.
The soup is really more of a pork chili, and it’s the most Midwestern thing Clint indulges in after owning an actual, honest-to-God farm. It’s also playing dirty, because Clint hasn’t made it for Tony in at least a couple years now, and he’s missed it, missed this feeling, so he’s guaranteed to eat it. He’s not hungry until he sees it, and then he’s instantaneously ravenous. He practically inhales it the second Pepper shuts the door, and even entertains the idea of going to ask for more. He decides against it in the end because, Extremis or not, he hasn’t had food in his stomach for days, and the soup sits heavily for a while before deciding to settle there, like it always does. Miraculously, Tony never seems to get sick off the stuff despite how poorly designed it seems to be for the sick and/or injured.
3. Steve cites the World Security Council and thinks they should have one active duty team member on the UN committee that discusses and ultimately decides where the Avengers go and don’t go. (Tony nominates Natasha.)
“He’s capable of hurting me,” Tony says finally. He feels—a lot. Terror, excitement. He doesn’t give people the power to do that very much anymore. Half of him trusts Steve, half of him wants to flee, back to Malibu, beyond.
“You’re okay,” he says. “They’re going to take some scans. All you have to do is stay still until they’re done.”
Peter splutters as his brain apparently short-circuits under the strain of Captain America’s gratitude.)
Steve gets Tony leaning against him and puts a hand in his boyfriend’s hair, combing out the knots and working out the clumps of what might be motor oil, even if it is a little gross. Tony picks a piece of pineapple off the pizza and pops it in his mouth after drinking half the first bottle of Gatorade. Steve really, really hopes he plans to eat more than just the pineapple, but he’s not going to press the issue right now.
He looks at them out of the corner of his eyes, but doesn’t stop on his way through the doors. The look on his face is weary.
Tony clamps his teeth hard on the giggle the view manifests. He’s well rested, comfortable, safe. Steve’s under him and Nat’s leaning on her elbows above him, and it smells like bacon. He’s absolutely floored by the feeling it’s giving him. His heart was definitely not made big enough for all the emotion it’s holding in this moment, and he has no idea what to do with the excess.
“No,” Bruce moans, and for a terrible second Tony thinks he’s having some sort of nightmare, but then he follows it up with, “I was listening, I promise. Jus’ resting m’eyes.”
“Yes, obviously,” he whispers. And at full volume, “That’s not really an answer to the question though, is it?”
Bucky's considers his mug, and Tony can see the thought process play out on his face. He spins a pizza crust idly and watches as Bucky brings the mug to his lips, knowing full well that it’s still much too hot to drink. Bucky commits, though; he slurps obnoxiously, and continues breathing in air after he pulls the coffee away, trying to cool the liquid as it burns his tongue, and Tony laughs at him, silently. It’s quiet again, then, and at least Tony knows better than to drink his coffee for another couple minutes. They both sit there, and he doesn’t know what else to say that would keep things as peaceful as they are, so he eats the crust even though he doesn’t want it. Eventually he swaps his plate for his mug and thinks, to hell with it.
Tony squares his shoulders and wishes they were having this conversation in the kitchen or in a board room, somewhere he could storm out of, but he’s not even wearing shoes and Steve’s blocking the door because Tony’s an inhospitable jerk who didn’t invite his guest in.
“Some things,” Tony says, trying to dredge up offense at the statement and landing mostly on amusement. “You know I’m actually almost 50 and am still alive somehow, right?”
Wanda glances at Vision for the briefest of seconds, looking tense enough to snap, and her teeth are gritted when she speaks, but she says, “I’m working on it.”
Tony can barely believe this Steve Rogers is the same man he’s known for years now, the one who politely (if a little tersely) refused Tony’s offer of a room in the Tower. (The fact that Tony gave him one anyway is irrelevant; it’s not like he ever pressured Steve or the others to use the accommodations.)
Tony wants to stomp down on his flash of irritation, but it just flares even brighter. Of course Steve would take the path of ultimate righteousness, of course he gets to keep his hands clean while Tony loses whatever shred of his humanity is left. Because that’s how Steve’s morals work: black and white, right and wrong, and Steve’s always right, good, fighting on the right side, even if it damns the rest of the world. How dare Tony ask him to get his hands dirty just to keep Tony from killing his teammates, their teammates.
“It wasn’t,” Bruce says, glances off to the side and then back to Steve, “something they could’ve fixed.”
Steve smiles back. The branch dips when he sits, and Tony can hear it groan, though that’s hopefully only because his ears are so much better now.
“Steve, you’re asleep,” Tony says, and lets his vocal cords carry the words this time. It’s not much louder than his whisper, really, but it carries the sound of his voice. “It’s just a dream…albeit a very bad one.”
If Rhodey’s standing before them, ready to admit he helped fuck everything up, hardly anyone else has room to cry innocence.
“Eh,” Tony says after a few seconds of thoughtful silence. “Team full of gods and assassins—you hold the reins too tight…”
“Next version? Next version should be able to go through airport security in under three hours,” Rhodey says. The elevator doors close behind them, and Tony plants his feet, pushes the button, and takes a little more of Rhodey’s weight when the elevator starts upwards.
It’s another ten minutes before the Quinjet shows up, and Tony thinks they must’ve pushed it on the speed front. It definitely hasn’t been twenty minutes yet, but he doesn’t bring it up out of sheer gratitude. He’s a little beat up, but fine for the most part. Steve comes careening out of the ‘jet before it even sets down, and Tony can tell he’s pissed. It’s all in the ultra-tight coil of his somersault and the ferocity with which he flings his shield at the nearest bot.
Tony takes a second to sit with that information. He’s known, of course, that Steve’s been having a hard time. Except, maybe he didn’t—whenever he thought about Steve in Wakanda, after Siberia but before coming home, he usually imagined Steve and Bucky, together, sometimes sharing a beer, sometimes laughing about fighting Tony. And it’s not entirely realistic, but that’s how it always was in his head. Logically, he knows Steve’s about as mentally stable as he is himself—PTSD, depression in place of Tony’s own anxiety. Steve puts on a brave face but in all honesty, Steve’s been a mess since he was unfrozen. This is more of a confirmation than anything else, and the knowledge that Steve’s been in worse shape since they refroze Barnes, or since whenever “earlier” was. The start of their disagreement, Tony thinks. Peggy dying, probably.
“Magic fridge!” Scott yells when he comes in, amazed by the sudden appearance of food in the kitchen. Tony snorts.
Tony’s quiet for another couple of minutes, and Steve thinks he’s definitely nodded off this time, his breathing deep and even, but he breaks the silence once more, sounding at least half asleep.
And this is the moment Tony realizes he feels normal. This isn’t the distrustful version of himself who could hardly accept a dinner plate from his teammates; this isn’t the hateful, out-of-control version of himself who invited the team back to the compound after that first battle-slash-reunion, who was admittedly right but so so
“Don’t get used to it,” Clint says. “You’re lucky I’m such a nice guy.” He shudders theatrically. “A hospital and everything. I even signed in as a visitor.”
“God, no.” Tony shudders. He was young and dumb, but neither of those things excuse the train wreck that was the Tony-and-Ty show. There aren’t many things Tony’s well and truly ashamed of, but that so-called relationship makes the list. “And I think it’s fair to say I’ve gotten better. Y’know, wise in my old age.”
“Steve was worried about you,” Bucky says after a couple of minutes. He’s cradling his still-too-hot-to-drink coffee to his chest, and his eyes have mostly been on his mug.
“Tony?” Steve sounds a little breathless. There are few things outside of an Avengers situation that would make Captain America winded; none of them are things Tony particularly thinks Steve should be doing while making calls.
“I don’t care that you used Extremis, because it kept you alive, and that’s good enough for me. The rest of it…” He shrugs. “I’d still like to go out for coffee, if that’s alright with you.”
Steve even proposes a forum now, to get them caught up. A setting in which the “core members,” referring to the original six, could discuss the standing membership of everyone who’s been added to the roster. Tony shoots that down pretty fast. He sees where Steve’s coming from, but that would do nothing except freak everyone out.
Reality’s still split in half, and he sees both Steves in front of him, the one who cares and the one who can’t be bothered. It’s driving him mad.
Oh, he finds himself thinking some time later when Steve pulls the comforter over them as they talk it out. Oh. This might be something like love.
And there’s a woman sitting by the window with a spot of blood on the thigh of her jeans and a leather jacket (real leather, Tony can smell it from here, how creepy is that?) that’s cracked and fissured with age. A man in his early twenties sits in the middle of the room, criss-cross on a wooden dining chair, staring at a laptop, absently petting the ivy growing from a pot beside his table. His socks are made of real wool and he has mismatching tan lines all over the place. His breath whistles a little when he breathes in deeply, a sound that reminds Tony of having the arc and cold at the same time, painful background noise.
“I should be set,” Tony says. Then, “Actually, if Pep could hand off those specs from Fury, I might as well take a glance.”
She can still call him on his cellphone at any time, of course, but she must sense his desire for privacy, or have her hands full running the compound, because she doesn’t.
Bucky schools his expression quickly for a guy who just woke up, and deadpans, “My therapist would call this a violation of my privacy. Which is a thing I’m
“Me too.” Tony feels his eyebrows pinch together, and Clint’s frowning now. “You said he was lonely.”
“So,” Steve says after a couple minutes of picking at leaves and watching the horizon. “How’s it going with everyone else so far?”
Pepper relaxes her stance, her shoulders drop. Steve thinks she’s going to concede the point for all of two seconds.
Tony doesn’t know what he meant by that, precisely, but he seemed fond and entirely accepting of the idea of Tony sleeping in his room. He even looked alarmed when he thought he’d gotten it wrong.
Tony breaks off to breathe, willing his lungs to slow, the fast pace dragging his thought processes in circles. When he makes himself look back to Steve’s face, there’s no anger or impatience. He looks a little sad, maybe, but not like he wants Tony to just spit it out already. Gently, gratefully, Tony’s thumb strokes Steve’s wrist again, and he keeps his eyes locked on Steve’s as he talks, unsure if he’s still being honest or if he’s going to accidentally cross into unfair territory.
Instead, that night, Howard had talked softly about how sometimes you have to do unpleasant things or deal with unpleasant people, and no amount of preparation will make you any more ready. About how sleep doesn’t always feel right or seem feasible, and instead of honey tea he works on the cars. Any activity with idle contemplation of the mechanism that keeps his hands busy, really, but the cars work the best. All of this was confessed lowly as Howard made adjustments to the engine, and afterwards, he’d stared silently for a moment as Tony watched this strange nighttime version of his father, until Howard pulled over a stepstool—picking it up and moving it rather than his usual drag across the concrete floor to avoid the unnecessary noise lest Maria skin both their hides—to let Tony climb up and see the specifics.
“Hey, toss me a hoodie?” Tony asks, reaching a hand out without making a move to get out of bed, and Steve rifles around in a drawer before throwing a hoodie over his shoulder where it lands perfectly on Tony’s face.
Tony only sees the sketchpad laid out on Steve’s bed because Steve shifts in the doorway to block his view of it. That’s interesting, definitely, but Tony lets him get away with it for now.
Does that make it better or worse? On the one hand, Steve seems to be about as torn up over the whole thing as Tony, but on the other hand, Steve was careless enough to let it happen. Who’s to say it won’t again? What’s stopping him?
“Oh, but it was,” Vision says back, a shit-eating grin on his face that makes his voice sound perfectly like JARVIS in that moment. “Had it not been a simulation, we would have died a horrible, fiery death. You would have, anyway. Organic body and all that.”
The table quiets and tension descends like a curtain upon the meeting. Tony wants to roll his eyes but that sounds like the thing that’ll get him picked up by the throat.
“She is either a child who needs your protection,” he says, looking straight at Wanda, “or she is a sister-in-arms who must answer for her own actions.”
Vision arrived at some point—again, not from the direction of the elevators, suggesting he’s ignoring doors and walls and floors alike, again. He’s at the table with Scott and Wanda, chatting with the both of them, but he pauses to catch Tony’s eye at that, face soft and open and full of emotion so pure Tony’s taken aback. At some point, Vision became capable of feeling, apparently; there’s no faking this, not so well. Silently, he smiles back and tucks away that information to examine later.
“I love you,” Pepper says when they’re standing outside the SI offices. “You’re family, whether we’re together or not. I just wish you’d stop leaving for months at a time. I miss you too, you know.”
Tony looks at Steve, whose eyes are glazed but watching the encounter nonetheless. He doesn’t offer input either way, so Tony decides to take that as permission.
The thing is, away from Steve, alone, Tony doesn’t know which perception he should believe, which he should be basing his actions on. They’re both real, in their own ways, Tony knows. Steve’s no villain, but he really did those things; he hurt Tony; he drove the team apart. He did those things, but that doesn’t mean that the version of Steve from last night and this morning—the one who listened, and reassured, and stayed with Tony until he fell asleep, the one who smiled at Tony with his mouth full of sesame seed bagel—he’s not any less real for all the pain he’s caused in the past.
“Tony,” Steve says Thursday night when Tony finally cracks, spills a watered-down version of his guts into the space between them. “It’s going to be okay because we’re going to make it okay. It’s not that I don’t think there could be problems, but I’m pretty sure we’ll be able to handle anything that does come up.”
lol hi remember me? yes, i am still writing this fic! it's been a wild few months, sorry about the disappearance and thank you for the continued support. i've got a couple more chapters written currently, and am going to be working on some more, too. hopefully there are still ppl interested in this after so long! i really am sorry, but i promise this fic is going to get finished if it's the last thing i do
Fuck what you feel, he tells himself, and walks right up to his reflection, bracing his hands on the sink. Fuck it, if this makes you more efficient, helps you live longer, then just don’t waste it.
Tony gets up, clapping Thor on the shoulder as he moves away. He needs—air, or distance, or something.
Tony takes the two steps to the bed and sets the plastic cup on the tray with two of the tablets so he can gently help Steve sit up, biting back the warning—
haha if y'all thought i wasn't going to address the Issue Of Wanda or tony's health re: chest pains then you were sadly mistaken
“It’s been an issue since the very start,” Tony says softly. “Maybe if there had been resources available to us back in the day, you wouldn’t have struggled to adjust and I wouldn’t have gone quite so off the deep end after New York. And I can’t think of a single one of us who wouldn’t benefit from an extra support system.”
“But,” Steve continues, “when Tony Stark comes up to you and goes ‘hey, guys, Captain America’s birthday is on the Fourth of July’ everyone thought he was full of shit. Except Natasha, because she already knew it was true, it’s right there in my file. But my birthday comes and we’re all staying in the tower then, because SHIELD HQ is worse for wear, and my apartment got destroyed—but it’s my birthday and Tony comes in for some coffee and wishes me a happy birthday. And, seeing as it is my birthday and that’s not an unusual thing to say, I thanked him.” Sam’s smile seems a little more genuine now, like he sees where the story’s going. And it is a happy memory. It is.
Despite the fact that it’s just after one in the morning—and Jesus Christ, that early?—Pepper responds within five minutes.
Steve’s beating on one of the aliens, swinging his shield forward and then back. These things can walk off just about anything short of decapitation which, even for Steve, is becoming quite the chore. Tony spots another alien coming up behind Steve, and Steve’s just getting ready to go for the kill with the one in front of him. Instead of calling it out, Tony swoops low and fires a repulsor at its unarmored tentacle. The thing howls as Steve’s shield goes cleanly through the other one. A missile launcher pops out of the suit’s shoulder and he fires a projectile straight into its gaping mouth just as Steve turns to see what’s going on. They both watch as the aliens implodes and goes down, gurgling low in its throat.
“Oh, come on,” Steve scoffs, and he looks just as nasty as Tony feels now, all jagged edges and open bleeding. “You say that like I’m looking for excuses to bolt, like I really just wanted to leave last time.”
“Listen, twinkletoes,” Bruce says and Tony’s gaze flickers up to catch the glee in Bruce’s eyes. “I’m still not a therapist, but this…hesitance? Not a good look on you.”
Staring at the list doesn’t give him the inspiration he was hoping for. He still doesn’t know how to work his way through the meeting by the time he hears footsteps on the stairs, steady except for a couple of falters. A quick glance at the clock shows it’s just after one in the morning. The breathing that goes with the footsteps is steady, deliberate, deep.
so here i am, two weeks late but armed with good excuses. two mondays ago i went to the gym for too long and made myself sick (not how it sounds--the rdj sherlock holmes movie came on while i was on the elliptical so i decided to stay and watch the whole thing, and then almost passed out in a chinese restaurant afterwards) and THEN i went to russia for a week. and now i'm back at school, just getting over a cold. i'm trying my best here.
Tony laughs. He knows what Sam’s talking about, too, because section 9-C is a doozy, an absolute mess of legal language, but also an important one. He types out a quick reply:
“Of course, it would also be reassuring if I knew someone would have my back, too,” he says, more to himself than to FRIDAY. Louder, he says, “You’ve got my back though, right, little lady?”
Either way, when Tony wakes up, it’s to his empty bed and the residual comfort of Steve having been there. Tony can
Steve’s head is already leaning back against the headrest, eyes at half mast. The music’s not even on, which Tony doesn’t think he’s done since the last time he was in a car with Ross. It makes him a little jittery, but Steve’s obviously pretty content. Or, as content as he can be on a road trip a couple hours after a wicked concussion and with Tony dragging him around NYC.
So he confesses to how nice it was at the press conference they did for the Accords, how much easier it was to handle with other people there to back him up. They agree that press duty should be handled in pairs or groups, and that it shouldn’t be anyone’s sole responsibility to calm the sharks in the wake of a storm.
And Tony’s not completely deluded; he knows there’s more to him being here than seeking approval from teammates. However, that doesn’t mean Bruce is completely off the mark. He rarely is.
The doctors know about as much as Tony does at this point, so he doesn’t even feel bad about ditching medical. He even asks about those tests they want to run, and when he hears (MRI, blood tests, cognitive responses, etc.) he feels even more justified. If they’re not going to do anything useful, there’s no reason for Tony to sit here twiddling his thumbs. Finally, the doctor sighs and moves for a piece of cotton to hold against the puncture on Tony’s arm. Rhodey excuses himself with a quip about letting everyone know Tony’s not a raging monster (yet). And even though Tony knows that Rhodey’s just giving him some privacy and probably about to hunt Pepper down—which, yeah—he’s grateful for the gesture.
Rhodey comes the rest of the way into the room pretty quickly, Tony notes with something like glee. He's moving really well. Still, Tony should add the braces to his to-do list.
Before, when everyone had just returned, Tony had felt so out of place and so unwanted. Things are still weird now, but at least he doesn’t feel so despised in his own home.
“T’ny,” Steve says, and Tony’s less worried than he maybe should be. This version of Steve sounds almost exactly like the sleep-addled one, the slurring prominent, but at least he recognizes who Tony is.
The hurt is easily accessible. It comes to life like a guard dog waiting to be called on, awake and snapping, so defensive it’s mean, vicious.
He makes a compromise with himself: he can only go to the common floor when he gets all his ducks in a row about the whole
"A little more than okay,” Steve echoes, and he’s smiling softly up at the sky when Tony glances over.
Because, yes, he really does read the transcripts FRIDAY puts together of Peter’s “reports” to Happy.
“Part of listening to you is asking,” Steve says, and Tony supposes that does explain it; Steve’s nothing if not the most all-in, stubborn bastard Tony’s ever met. If he said he would listen he’s at least going to try. “Historically, we’ve danced around these conversations and let each other get away with it. That obviously hasn’t worked for us.”
Today, they just couldn’t protect the people they needed to protect. Hopefully they did well enough.
“King T’Challa,” Tony greets and shoves half a piece of pizza into his mouth. T’Challa and Natasha are sitting around a coffee table in the living room, and they look like the most neutral group, so Tony flocks to them.
Steve blinks. He registers that Hulk’s growling before he can register who he’s growling at, and for a moment he thinks they’re going to have to start fighting all over again because Hulk offended their queen. But it’s not the alien he’s glaring at; it’s Tony.
Steve stopped carrying the phone with him about four months in; it’s bulky and awkwardly shaped and is way too obvious, but if he misses this call he’s going to do something drastic. Something that Tony would do. Have T’Challa build a receiver and implant it under his skin, right next to his ear, so he can never miss Tony’s call. He thinks Tony might already have one of those things—God, he can’t believe he just left the phone in his room like that—
“Get out of my house,” Tony says, not yelling, not yelling, low and tired and fierce. He knows he’s the one who brought up Bucky, but it makes him ill to hear Steve calling the man by his nickname, which is ridiculous, Tony’s being ridiculous, but this is his home, his safe space, and Steve just flew all the way to Malibu to say Bucky’s name in his voice inside of Tony’s living room, just to ruin everything.
“Thanks, for helping me out tonight, and not trying to pry instructions out of me. I was a little,” he waved his hand vaguely, “gone, for that.”
Tony nods because, yes, that makes sense. The powers that be seem to either personally hate them both or thrive on their suffering. Or something, evidently.
Tony’s not even surprised to find Steve so close to him, not really. He noticed it in the background, kind of, though he thought at first that Steve was just walking by him for some reason. But—no. He’s standing there, square to Tony, a foot and a half between their noses.
“I haven’t quite gotten that far yet,” Tony says, because it’s Natasha. “I’m alive though, and I’ve got all my own skin, which at least appears to fit—”
“No,” Tony says. Instead of getting angry, Clint looks like his heart is breaking. Tony definitely doesn’t have the patience for this shit. He rolls his eyes.
And then Steve’s typing again, and Tony waits. He swings his feet up even farther until he’s upside down, hair nearly brushing the floor and, wow, he needs a haircut maybe.
She replies, but Tony’s marching to the bathroom and not exactly listening as he carefully sinks to his knees and gags into the toilet, bringing up every chunk from his stomach that isn’t currently on the living room floor.
by the Dixie Chicks and tells FRIDAY to intercept anymore incoming communications from Steve and only let them through if it’s for an emergency.
He bites his hand to stifle the noise he’s making, and it feels almost good, like when you have a headache and you press on your head to relieve the pressure. He bites harder.
“It’s not exactly a hardship for me,” Steve says. The words are neutral enough, but he says it sharply, matching Tony’s own clipped voice.
“Whaddaya mean?” Tony rests his elbow on Steve’s shoulder because he can from this position, slightly elevated, and Steve leans his head against Tony’s arm briefly. He feels sun-warm and like he’s on solid ground here, with Steve, as an equal. Like Tony’s problems are Steve’s problems, are the team’s problems, like he doesn’t have to rail against them alone.
He can hear someone coming up behind them, but when he turns it’s just Clint walking through the alleyway. After a nod, Steve turns back to Tony. One of his hands is flailing and his eyes are screwed shut again. He manages to grab Steve’s hand, the one still on Tony’s face, and pulls it down. Steve takes the hint and holds his hand down at Tony’s shoulder level, still raking fingers through his hair.
“I know.” And Tony doesn’t know why he sounds so soft all of a sudden, like he’s letting Steve down easy. Earlier he’d wanted to scream the words in his face, stuff them down his throat, give him a taste of his own medicine. “But it’s not a scale, Steve.”
“A touching sentiment,” Steve says, but he’s smirking. Tony hums, and Steve lets go of his leg to reach up and take Tony’s hand instead, and they end up holding hands over Steve’s heart. Tony’s arm is stretched so it’s awkward, and if they stay like this long it’ll be asleep. “I want you to be happy too.”
“Maybe they’ll have him settled by the time you’ve gotten the boulder removed from your spine,” she says evenly. He can feel Bucky’s gaze on them, but doesn’t look.
“Where did this—” Bucky says, looking down at the screen in confusion, and then up at Tony, utter betrayal on his face. “Tony,” he whines.
Okay, he tells himself. Another compromise: he’ll get caffeine and a quick update from whoever else is there. Just a quick pass through the kitchen for some coffee, and then down to the lab. It’s still before dawn, so he takes the time to shower and dress in shop clothes, jeans and a couple of t-shirts.
“All due respect, Boss,” she says, “let’s make sure your upgrade isn’t buggy before we mess around with my programming.”
Instead of dragging Bruce when the doors open again, Tony links his elbow with Bruce’s and gives him a tug. Tony still ends up supporting more of his weight than normal, but neither mentions it. In fact, they don’t talk again until Tony’s led them to Bruce’s quarters and Bruce is half-sprawled, half-flopped onto the bed. Tony huffs and moves to take Bruce’s shoes off for him. Just to be petty, he slips them off Bruce’s feet without untying the laces, because he knows it’ll bother the hell out of the big guy later.
“I would never,” Steve says. “Tony, you know—you have to know that wasn’t intentional. I would never hurt you.”
He shrugs, gesturing to the table as a whole, to the people who hadn’t thought to challenge her presence.
“Everyone’s staying here tonight,” he grinds out. “Except T’Challa. You’re free to go whenever you wish, Your Highness,” he adds to the man beyond Steve’s shoulder where he’s sitting on a plush chair.
“S’not,” he slurred. Anger and frustration ripped through him at that and he bit his tongue, hard. He thought it might be bleeding, but he was rewarded with the clarity of pain for about .2 seconds. “Not that,” he tried again. Talking was hard. Finding his goddamn mouth through the mess of neurons was hard. Sam paused. The air in front of him shifted again. Tony opened his eyes and it was Natasha in front of him.
Nat rolls her eyes at that, but she stays perched on the arm of Bucky’s couch until her tea’s gone and she knows all the housewives by name. She doesn’t make any comment about Tony and Bucky watching bad TV together in the dead of night, which Tony’s grateful for, and she leaves between episodes to go back to bed or at least retreat to her room.
