The man must’ve noticed how sick Steve looked, because he asked, “Did you know someone who was cursed?”
worried about a villain, thank you, but now you're giving me more things to worry about. Great. Thank you for that."
Tony grabbed Bruce's arm before he was able to walk away, and he quickly pulled his friend into a hug. "Thank you, Bruce."
Spinning on his heel, Steve stormed off towards the edge of the mountain, the place where he knew Natasha had jumped from, where she had sacrificed her own life so that countless others could live. He couldn’t help but glance over the edge into the depths of the darkness, seeing nothing more than a stain of blood where his friend must have been.
That didn't change the fact that he was sitting at the kitchen table, head down, waiting for the coffee to brew so that he might be able to get some of that sweet caffeine energy into his veins.
"I'm not testing it on either of you until I'm sure it's not going to hurt you," Bruce assured them, though he still looked unhappy about being dragged away from his work. "Things aren't allowed to go wrong, that's why I locked you two out of my lab. I don't want anything to even
…but if the team thought marrying him was a joke, then maybe Steve would see that eventually, too? Tony would rather he see it and break the engagement off
“You do? Good. ‘Cause Stevie’s not choosing to stay in that world because he loves Peggy, he’s stuck in that world because they made it so that he didn’t know you existed anymore,” Bucky said. “If he knew you existed… he’d be back in this world before you knew it.”
Tony dropped down onto his knees when they were gone, taking a couple deep breaths. Whenever he used magic, it completely wore him out. He barely had enough energy to still be sitting up. The sound of Clint's laughter was what made Tony turn around. Three of the bird creatures had managed to get loose and were already flying off into the sky, but one of them was sitting on the ground, head thrown back in laughter.
"No, nothing like that—it's a good thing, really," Tony said quickly, pressing a quick kiss to his husband's cheek. "It's good, I promise. I just... I wanted you to know how grateful I am that you stepped in when you did at that battle."
find a way to reverse it. You don't have to worry about that. In fact, it would probably be best if you didn't worry about it. The less worry and stress, the better."
“When you originally brought me back to the tower, we spent the first three days locked in the lab,” maybe-Bruce spoke up. “We were trying to figure out how to make pants for the Other Guy because you said that you didn’t want a lawsuit because either he’s running around naked smashing stuff or I’m waking up somewhere where there could be civilians, but I knew that it was because you wanted to make things easier for me. We both loosened up to one another after the second straight day of working through designs and synthesizing new materials when you told me about your plans on bringing the Avengers back to the tower. That was the first time you ever told me—or
"Okay, so I thought you were kidding at least a little bit," Tony gasped, sweaty and exhausted as his boyfriend dragged him to his feet. Again. He couldn't keep track of the number of times he'd been knocked to the ground. "I can't keep up with a super-soldier, Steve, I really can't."
Steve gasped, feeling pain immediately shooting up his arm the second that he was conscious again. His head ached, there had been too many
. It was strange. The team had always called them 'Mom and Dad' (though Steve was still unsure which one he was supposed to be) and now he was actually
. In fact, he was a little surprised that he didn't feel Steve gripping his hand right now, because unless something was going on, that's where he should be. You know, unless he was out saving the day while Tony was in a drunken stupor or blowing himself up in the lab.
Tony's heart ached as he thought about not being able to share a bed with Steve anymore. The moment that Bucky was back, Steve would spend all of his time with his not-dead-anymore 'best friend' (Tony was almost
There was something that the Red Skull hadn’t known, hadn’t been able to foresee even with that infinite wisdom of his while he led people here for the stone. The stones hadn’t
He then gestured for the rest of the team to follow after him to this blocked off area where apparently (hopefully) they'd be safe from any effects of the ray.
"I wonder if Steve wants to help us with this," Tony mumbled, taking the wires that Clint was holding so that he could finish wiring the machine.
As he ran through the data, he wasn’t seeing anything that was wrong. When Natasha brought his bagel in, he migrated over to his chair and kept going through the data as he ate.
"Come on. If you're anything like me, 'talking about your feelings' isn't something that you're going to want to do, but even I can tell that you need to talk right now, so..." Stark said, taking his hand before leading him over to the 'living room' area. Rogers stayed at his side, offering him quiet comfort. Just having him there was enough for Tony—he looked
“Thank you,” he said, a little discouraged. He’d just have to look somewhere else for her, then. “I heard there was a big, town-wide ritual tonight—I thought maybe she would be involved…?”
people say about me taking you out tonight. We shouldn't give them any power to get under our skin. I'm pretty good at ignoring the press, and I'd assume by now that you would be, too."
to feel more excited, but he was still pretty tired and pretty sore, so it wasn't really translating well. He couldn't help how tired he was, and he couldn't help that being tired made him cranky. All he had to do was make sure that he didn't snap at anyone—
deserve to get a happy ending, after everything he’d done through and everything he’d done to fix past mistakes.
The best thing about watching Steve day in and day out was the fact that he was right there to see those beautiful blue eyes of Steve’s open again.
has already been exhausting," Tony spoke up, watching Steve's face fall a little before he just nodded and didn't push the matter. It wasn't that Tony wasn't interested—because Steve was Steve, and God did he love that man no matter what he looked like. He just didn't want to tell his husband that he didn't want the super-soldier to see him naked right now. He hated having to see himself naked, why would he want to subject Steve to that?
Steve just nodded numbly to show that he’d heard before he walked off—he wasn’t about to let this happen to anyone else. He didn’t
While that seemed to lighten the mood a little, everyone still seemed unsure of what to say. Eventually Bruce spoke up, asking if he'd be able to take Tony over to the medical room just to make sure everything was fine. Tony was a little glad that Steve followed after him, because at least if he was around maybe Bruce wouldn't get too personal with the questions—but then again, why would it matter if his husband was around?
"It's not that," Steve insisted quickly. How was he supposed to explain this? "He just... he's a bit insecure. He thought that I was putting so much time into tracking you down because I was in love with you, and that I was just going to leave him... and I can't really blame him for thinking like that, because I haven't been spending much time with him, and I was actually just telling him earlier today that I was going to stop trying to drag you back to the tower because I was basically ignoring him, and—"
"Uh, Tony? I know this is weird, but this whole place is strange. I can assure you, I'm still me, though. Like Clint, he's still him even though he... looks like a bird," Steve murmured. His arms were still roped behind his back, so Tony got up to undo those. God was Steve gorgeous. Being a centaur, he didn't exactly have a shirt on at the moment, and Tony was definitely not complaining. He leaned up, trying to get the ropes.
they'd been together before and during the war). He'd forget about their relationship (probably not, Tony presumed), or he'd break up with him as nicely as he could (because Steve was a nice guy like that).
that you guys were able to track me down so quickly,” Tony said, shaking his head. No, this was just another trick. He must’ve… he must’ve said something about dating Steve…
thinking it, but he’d actually said it? Tony looked crestfallen, probably jumping to his own conclusions, so Steve just held him in place and smiled at him. “I did mean it—I was sorta hoping that I’d tell you when you could actually answer back, but… I do love you, Tony.”
"Remember to leave one of them conscious," Sam called, swooping down to take out a couple more Hydra agents.
“I’ll see if I can look through the code, make sure the system’s still functioning like it should be,” Tony assured him, patting Clint’s shoulder. “Don’t worry about it, Clint, it wasn’t your fault. Things happen, and I’ll just… keep anything bad from happening, okay? It’ll all be fine.”
. Soon, they'd talk. Soon. He still wished that he could see his boyfriend's face. "Let's go stop Hydra."
"No one thought I was anything more than a broken man after... after Afghanistan," Tony sighed, hanging his head. "Your team... trusts you?"
The alternate-Tony smirked. The man's hair was a lot darker than his own, and his facial hair was trimmed in a slightly different style. His eyes, though, were the same. "Yeah, great, expect for you dropped down from a little too high directly onto a car. Might be a little more effective if you were able to control it better. Can I get your plans?"
He'd barely gotten a chance to see Natasha running back over into the room, leaving Clint to fly the plane solo, before he'd been blasted out of the plane.
“Love you too,” Tony whispered as a small smile spread across his face. Steve was right, he shouldn’t be worrying about that.
in their tracks. Tony was so glad to be spared from that look right now. “If this is how you guys are all going to act, then you can bet that
He really shouldn't have been surprised to see Steve standing there. The super-soldier looked surprised to see Clint there instead of Tony, but what shocked him more, probably, was just how drunk Clint knew he looked.
"You don't have to," Tony promised, keeping the injured soldier held close. Steve wandered over, wrapping his arms around the both of them, and Tony couldn't help but grin. "We'll be here, Buck, don't worry. We're taking you home."
He’d always wanted a large family. When Peggy had decided that she was ready, the two of them started a family. While she wasn’t happy about not being allowed out on the field, she was happy about the kids. Steve could see that they made her just as happy as they made him.
that he was awake. “Steve, hey—you’re going to get better, Steve, I got you to the team as fast as I could—”
“You know about our room now? Great, what else have I said?” Tony mumbled, though he had to admit, at least this fake Steve was nicely toned. “Thought I kept all the personal information out of it. Hey, Mr. Skrull? When you drag me back to the cell again, could you at
"Dinner's in a half an hour," Natasha said, like that was the only reason she'd come down—not to scold them or anything. Steve seemed to get the real reason why she had come down, but he just kept a smile on his face—definitely not a genuine one. "Bucky's cooking. We expect you to be there."
Two nights ago he thought his team had showed up to save him. Two days ago, they’d broken him out of his jail cell, and he’d been so happy. His family was there to save him.
“You’re a strong woman, Peggy. Everything will be fine,” Steve promised. It was one of the reasons he loved her so much—she was strong and independent, but she still loved him and let him care for her whenever… whenever he spent too much time in the lab, or forgot to take care of himself, or when he decided to go all-out with things that didn’t need that much care and attention but he overthought every detail and… Who was he talking about? Not Peggy. “But I’m not going to leave. I’ll find a job in the city, and I’ll stick around here. We’ll raise our children, and everything will be okay. Don’t you trust me?”
Tony looked away. "If you knew about my public image... if you knew what I'd done before the Avengers..."
Sighing, Tony laid down on the cold, hard floor again. Tomorrow marked two weeks. If he was being honest, it would probably take a week or two to track him down in the first place. But they had to know that he was a fake first.
"They were trying to catch Clint and the other harpies," Steve replied, motioning over to their feathered friend, who was back on his feet again. Or, well... talons? Those looked deadly. "Where's Bucky? I thought I heard you say..."
"You do have Avengers, right?" the young man who had the webbing asked, sounding worried. He nodded to reassure the guy.
His heart ached, and for a moment Steve wasn’t sure if he’d be able to breathe. He hadn’t lost the entire team, but two people who meant the world to him were now dead, and… and it hurt more than he’d ever be able to explain. It was more than losing a piece of himself.
He wasn’t here for a ritual, though. He was here for the witch—and if she wasn’t there, then he had no reason to stay. Sighing, Steve shook his head. “Thank you, Ma’am, but I really need to find her. She… she hurt someone close to me, and I need her to fix it.”
"I don't know how many times it's going to take me saying I love you for you to realize that it's true," Steve whispered, pressing kisses to Tony's head. Thankfully, his wound had been healing up a lot during the flight back, and hadn't ever really been
And yet here he was, spare Iron Man gauntlet he’d stolen snugly fit on his left hand, gripping the briefcase with all of the stones. Vormir. It wasn’t a pretty sight, that was for sure.
"It's only for when you're not moving. It's stuck in place, but as long as you stay here, you'll be completely fine," Tony explained. "It's a one-way shield. You can shoot out of it, but no one will be able to hit you. And you won't be able to move the shield, either. I'll have to disable it before we leave."
“What are you talking about? Tony, we’re here to get you out. Just hold on,” not-Steve said frantically, taking his well-crafted shield off the strap on his back. Not-Steve used the shield to break the lock off of the door—at least they were changing it up. Last time not-Steve had managed to ‘get the key away from the guard’ and just unlock the door before not-Bruce and not-Clint helped him out of the cell.
“Me too, kid, me too,” Tony chuckled, smirking when Happy grabbed Peter and dragged him off to the side to sit in the front row, where he’d be able to give the pastor the rings when called.
A strong pulse of energy shot through the lab, knocking a very startled Clint backward. He couldn't quite see what was going on, not from where he was, but the way that the room lit up with swirling lights, something was definitely wrong. Clint grabbed onto a table leg when a strong force pulled towards the portal. He squeezed his eyes shut, not really understanding what was going on.
right now because the townspeople were making it so much harder for them to stop international criminals, and somehow Clint was still smiling. While he wouldn't admit it to the archer, he was glad that he was still so happy.
Every time he managed to locate the assassin, he told Steve, and while Steve always came home empty-handed he always had a smile on his face.
"Whenever you're ready... I can wait as long as it takes," Steve reassured him. After a moment he added, "You don't have to talk today—just tell me to back off and I will."
Without having a chance to say anything before Tony ran off, Steve decided to just listen and bring his injured friend over to the medical room.
"I don't want them to hate me... for lying for so long," Tony whispered, pressing his face against Steve's shoulder. He was glad that the genius wasn't mad for not saying something sooner, or for bringing it up in the first place. The super-soldier winced a little as he held Tony tighter, realizing that he was pressing his boyfriend against his wound, hissing in pain.
"How did I... know that you're Iron Man?" Steve asked, tilting his head to the side. Why were they wasting time if Tony was injured? Unless he wasn't injured. Checking again, Steve realized that Tony was just really
"I wanted to hear if Bucky's going to finally admit how much of a crush he's got on you or not," Tony said, making sure that Clint was completely steady so that he wouldn't be having to catch him if he fell from the tree.
before. Clint and Natasha had taken back control of the plane and were heading towards the closest S.H.I.E.L.D. base to put the plane down and arrest the Hydra agents. He was trying to take down the Hydra agents and keep them away from the S.H.I.E.L.D. weapons that they'd been trying to steal, but apparently they'd already taken a few weapons.
“You said Tony, not Howard. Is he someone that you met in the past few days, one of the men who’s trying to send you back out to the war?” Peggy asking, snuggling back up against his side again.
The moment that Steve let go and let Tony get a couple of feet away, he watched as his teammate’s skin started getting covered in fur. There were loud snaps as his bones rearranged themselves, and within a few seconds Steve wasn’t staring at his friend anymore.
“N-no, I can’t… I’ll just hurt you guys, I know I will,” Tony said. Steve wasn’t sure he’d ever heard the other man sound so
"Well, there was that one world that had a female me..." Stark said, and his Captain smirked. "She was pretty hot though, so I can't complain."
The sound of footsteps woke Tony, who barely managed to hold back an annoyed groan. Of course the Skrulls weren’t going to actually let him sleep through the night, there were only a few rare nights when that actually happened. Instead of bothering to get up, because he knew that they’d just drag him out of the cell anyway, Tony chose to just lay there and wait for the inevitable.
"I don't want you to... It happened, it's gone, and I've got to learn how to get past... everything. I can't have Howard like a devil on my shoulder for the rest of my life, telling me that I'm not worth anything..." Tony sighed, leaning back against Steve's chest when the super-soldier pulled his lover into his arms. "I
The archer was watching him with wide eyes, like he was shocked at the Skrulls would actually do something like shapeshift to look like them while they hurt Tony. His shocked look turned to concentration before he frowned.
“Can we go out sometime? I mean if you really are interested, then maybe…” Tony mumbled. In that moment, Steve swore that he was going to make sure that Tony was eventually able to be his confident self again, that he was going to help him with the werewolf side until he was comfortable with it.
"Mine?" Iron Man asked. "I mean, yeah, to everyone who doesn't live here. The public doesn’t know my identity, but the team sure does."
"Really? But you two look so similar..." Stark whined. "Please tell me he's still just as handsome as me."
"Yes," Iron Man murmured, and Steve was a little surprised by the slight emotion that made its way past the robotic voice that he was used to. "It's time to go home."
“I won’t, baby, I promise,” he said quickly, not wanting to worry the children. “They’re just talking about it. but I get the final say. They just think that I’ll be enough to rally the troops a bit, bring up their spirits.”
"Why would you need me around when you've got Bucky?" Tony said, internally cursing himself. Something about the kicked-puppy look on Steve's face just made him want to be honest with the other man.
Right as Bruce prepared the needle and told Bucky to get over to the left side of the bed to hold Steve down so that he could stick the needle into his arm… Steve made a loud gasping noise and was suddenly sitting up far faster than he should’ve been.
Steve quickly peeled his dirty clothes off, not feeling like he needed to get a shower just yet—he was too exhausted—so instead he just grabbed some new clothes and dragged himself down to the lab. What was Tony doing in the lab this late?
And now that he was absolutely positive that Tony was Iron Man... As happy as he was to know who was at his side during every battle, the thought of losing his boyfriend and co-captain was something that he had to for himself
now. Steve had fallen completely head over heels for Tony ever since he'd met him—he hadn't been sure
," Steve murmured, sliding into bed beside Tony, wrapping his arms around the shorter man's waist as he curled up around him, chest-to-back. He pressed a kiss to the back of Tony's neck, and the genius shivered with pleasure.
“Hey Steve,” Clint said quietly as he walked into the room, gesturing for someone to follow. Steve just raised an eyebrow at him, confused. Clint looked like he was trying to encourage a scared child into a room.
“We need you, Papa,” Mary said. When his eyes met those of his daughter, there was that feeling inside. He knew that he couldn’t leave them—that’s why he was so worried. That
a couple hours of sleep, understood?” Bruce said in a way that told Tony there was no other option. “One of us will always be in here. He won’t be alone.”
"My Tony's always had... insecurities, but I never would've thought that he felt so poorly about himself to not tell anyone that he's Iron Man," Steve sighed. He leaned back against the doorway. "Seeing your team makes me miss my own. I'll have to keep an eye out for the alternate versions of your team, back in my own world, because Tony and Bruce are the only ones that are familiar."
Tony then adjusted his wristband to 2012 and smiled at him once more, taking Steve’s wrist and adjusting his to 2013 for him.
Natasha didn’t say a word, but she did hug him tightly. While the Avengers had started off pretty rocky, they’d really grown close and become the family that Tony had never expected to have.
"Excuse me, sirs." Steve jumped a little, turning around to see an elderly man standing there. "Captain Rogers has informed me on the situation. Welcome to our universe... Captain."
looked like they'd been stressing over him. It was strange, since he wasn't used to it. Sure, he'd befriended the team, but for
"I'm guessing that it's going to be a 'no' on the whole trans-dimensional threesome thing, then?" Stark asked, and Tony couldn't help but chuckle a little.
"Guys... I think someone's trying to reopen the portal," Stark called, and the two raced back over. There was an energy in the middle of the room, still invisible but enough to bend the light to make it look like there was something there, growing.
"That's what you keep saying, and I'm sure that's a part of it, darling, but..." Steve backed up a little so he could see Tony's face. "There's more to it that you're not telling me, and I can see that it's hurting you... but I can't help you if you won't let me in, Tony. We've been dating for months, and I hope you understand how much I love you, how much I want to see you succeed at everything you do... how much I want to see you happy. But you're not happy... not when you're holding this weight on your shoulders all alone." It hurt to say those words, because he could see the way they were affecting Tony. "You don't have to do this alone anymore, Tony. I'm here for you."
"Oh." Steve looked cautious, eyes wide. He nervously bit his lip. "I'm sorry, do you not... I was told that you... that I might have a chance," Steve mumbled, rubbing his forehead. "I was told it was okay today, and that you... was I wrong to assume that you'd want to date me?"
He just… he just needed some time. Some time to think things through, some time away from the team, some time to gather his thoughts. If the team thought his engagement wouldn’t last, if they found it so
was real? It felt real. Everything had felt so real, like he’d been living another life entirely. Everything had been the same until… until they found him early, and then he never met Tony or the team or anyone.
"I can second that," Natasha said, and Tony looked over at her. She was dragging an annoyed-looking Bruce into the room—chances were, he wanted to continue working on the cure. He had that same look that Tony knew he got when Steve dragged him out of the lab.
Tony was the lucky one, he presumed, thus far. While he seemed to be some sort of sorcerer, he still looked almost completely human. Where his arc reactor used to be, there was a large blue, circular crystal. Smaller crystals were wedged in the palms of both his hands, along with various other places on his body. An energy surged through him that Tony, as much as he hated to admit it, could only call 'magic'.
The genius froze when he felt someone grab his arm as he walked past, and he turned around sharply to tell his teammates that he needed some time by himself.
date,” the blond shapeshifter said quietly as he placed Tony down so that he could let him stand on his own two feet, “…we went to this little cupcake store because you liked the muffins that they baked, not the cupcakes. The first date we went on, though, was back before I realized that we were dating… It was when you took me around the park and got me to try out the local food, since I hadn’t been there yet. You insisted that I try the hot dogs.”
over the media, and every time he proved the media wrong. Steve always stuck by his side, through it all.
“Go back to bed, kids,” he spoke up, flinching when their voices seemed to echo with a distinct, machine-like tune.
Iron Man," Clint said, shrugging. "Match that up with the way that Iron Man always left early, and despite being your bodyguard I've never actually seen him around you, and... yeah." A wide grin spread across his face. "I figured it out pretty quickly."
“Nothing,” he said quickly. He went back to gently rocking his daughter, whispering about how much he loved her. But when he gently carded his fingers through her hair… for a second, it looked like her hair fell right through his fingers—
"He's just a friend," Steve assured him, very quickly. "He's my closest friend in this century, and... With you, I guess you could call it love at first sight, really. You intrigued me, and I wanted to know more about you. As it turned out, the more I learned, the more I liked you. And I figured asking you out... I'd like to get to know you even better, Tony. I already know that I like you, a lot, but I don't know
"I'm real... we're real," Tony said. Bucky's eyelids fell closed, and Tony moved forward to kiss his forehead. "I promise, we're real. This is real."
The being felt orange, as if it had touched his soul instead of his body, as if he was seeing it without eyes.
changed. Steve had been terrified that Tony would leave while he was changed and wasn’t thinking correctly, but he
in his head just seconds—perhaps an eternity?—earlier. It was as if his skull had been cracked open to let whatever had just happened inside, but the crack hadn’t been sealed when everything had left him.
"Fury was pretty pissed that you weren't there, but he actually seemed concerned about you once he saw Steve," Clint spoke up. "I think you're finally starting to grow on him, Tony. He's never yelled at us so much to make sure that you were okay."
to worry about, apparently. It wasn't that long before Natasha made her way down to the lab. Tony was explaining some of the stuff he'd been working on to Steve, just some of the little side projects that he had. He honestly wasn't expecting anyone to be coming down to drag them out of the lab for at least a few hours or something.
to understand that the team will always be here for you—we'll always be at your side, defending you against anything that you need us to, because we're your family."
“Get up, we’re getting out of here,” he demanded, voice angry as he glared at the townspeople. Everyone looked like they wanted to kill him, too, but they were too scared to get close enough to Tony.
The biggest issue was when everyone was busy. Everything just… stopped for a second. There were green numbers—ones and zeroes—that were all over
? Was it really? He always lost track of the date, especially after spending a ton of time in the lab, and he’d definitely spent most of the past week in and out of the lab, then an entire day just with Steve and then… April? Already?
"That's when I really wanted to tell you... on that first date, I almost told you... then in the helicarrier... I know I should've mentioned it earlier. But I
"Sorry 'bout that," Bucky sighed, testing out the arm. "If I knew the strain it was putting on your and Stevie's relationship, I would've come back sooner... This is amazing. How'd you do this?"
"I told you it wouldn't be long," Steve said, not moving from his spot. Tony watched him, a soft smile on his face. The way that Steve was positioned, based on the marks where Bruce made them stand, was just how he'd protected him—right between him and the ray gun.
"You read my mind," he replied, grinning. It wasn't like this was the first time they'd shared a shower, just as they'd shared a bed many times for reasons
already, then… I know you think you have a family, and that it’s what you wanted—I know you wanted a big family. I know that. And I know I haven’t been the easiest to be around all the time, and I know that it’s my problems that have caused us to not have a family already, but… There’s a child that we could start our family with out here in the real world, Steve.
“You’ve got no reason to not breathe,” Clint spoke up, patting Tony’s back as he walked around him. Tony rolled his eyes when the archer whistled at him. “I think we’ve got you lookin’ pretty good.”
If they had known what he was about to do… there was no way that any of them would’ve given him the stones or the time machine. He would’ve been written off as mentally unstable, not allowed to go on such a dangerous mission that required absolute certainty or else all of reality could crumble should the stones not be returned to their proper places.
—Tony knew exactly when Clint had gotten happy again. It was the moment he realized he had a team that cared about him.
“I never would’ve left you there,” Steve whispered, gently stroking the injured man’s face. “I just wish that it wouldn’t have taken so long to break that Skrull into telling us where you were…” He pressed a kiss to the top of Tony’s head. “But we did, and now you’re coming home.”
“And what about…?” He wanted to ask about Bruce, or Clint or Natasha or Sam or… He wanted to ask about Tony. He
hadn't told him that he was Iron Man just yet. They'd gone on quite a few more dates, and Tony seemed like he wanted to say something—he'd even mentioned that he had something important they needed to talk about, but...
When they eventually did move, and Steve dragged Tony right out of the town and over towards the path that he’d taken to get to the town. It didn’t matter if he’d have to fight off any beasts to get Tony out of there, he was prepared to
“We won’t,” Bruce assured him quickly, no doubt noticing his panic. “We’re so sorry, Tony. If it means anything, none of us were laughing at you, we just thought it was all a joke…”
them. He had armor on, he'd be fine. Swooping down once more with eyes only on the big gun, Tony ignored the little bots that were chasing after him. It only took a moment or two for Clint to shoot all of the flying robots from his long-range spot. A couple of high-powered blasts were enough to destroy the last big gun, and the moment that it was gone, both super-soldiers came in and started taking down the Hydra agents.
“Clint was watching him, a-and he was frowning so we turned the monitor on and…” Tony hurried after Bucky down the hallway. “I don’t know if there was something wrong with the screen or something but it looked like there was a-a
Did Steve still have the serum? Tony assumed so, he assumed that the serum wouldn't have just magically disappeared from his system. Would the serum keep any health problems away? Perhaps he'd know if he had stayed and had done the physical that Bruce had suggested. In fact, he still didn't know if the arc reactor was causing trouble or not. Maybe he should ask Bruce to take a look at that.
"Tony! Steve!" Tony couldn't help the glare that settled on his face when Bruce ran, screaming, into the kitchen that morning. He'd had a late night—a
So instead of getting back to work, Tony started testing Bucky to see just how good he was with everything in the lab. After showing him the more modern-age technology, he started catching on pretty quickly. He couldn't deny that he was impressed—he knew that modern technology wasn't exactly Steve's thing, though he'd tried helping him with a lot of it, but compared to Bucky... He just caught on so quickly.
The bright golden light that had caused all of the problems in the first place filled the room again, and for a second Tony wanted to run into Steve's arms, to hold his husband tight just in case this was the last time that he'd get a chance to touch him, to hold him. Why hadn't he kissed him before Bruce turned the ray on? Why hadn't he said
While Tony’s head was still spinning from the realization that every one of those thoughts he’d been having earlier didn’t need to happen because he was fairly certain that his friends didn’t
he wanted to, but he did. The issue was, the more he talked with the other man, the harder it was for him to hate him. He was actually an interesting man to talk to, and Tony learned quickly that they were more similar than he'd been expecting. They even had the same sense of humor.
He’d heard from a couple of sources that the small town he was heading towards was trying to do some sort of ritual to keep themselves safe from the monsters that the witch had created. She had been from that town, and Steve guessed that it was probably where he would find her now.
"I was trying to take down some Hydra bases they... they used to keep me at," Bucky mumbled, keeping a hand pressed to the gunshot wounds. "They weren't too happy about that."
"Not without you," Bucky said, hugging him tightly. "I know we started this for Steve, but... I really do love you, Tony. You and Steve are my everything. You wouldn't be interrupting anything—there is no
Steve let go of Tony’s hand and looked like he was going to punch Bucky, who was approaching up until then. “Why the
A sudden and powerful pain flashed through Steve, starting with his hand and coursing up through his arm, igniting a fire in his bloodstream that was only fueled more with every breath, every passing second. He didn’t bother arguing out loud, not with something as eternal as the infinity stones, so instead Steve just snapped his fingers as fast as possible.
"That might be able to restart the serum in his veins enough to aid in the healing process," Bruce mumbled, probably mostly to himself as he grabbed a needle and a bag. "Tony, can you keep pressure on the wound?"
"But... but I did good," Bruce said, and Tony couldn't help but hug his friend as he continued dragging him out of the room.
As he collapsed back onto the ground, Steve didn’t even try to fight off the werewolf—he wasn’t going to hurt his friend, werewolf or not. Steve froze when the werewolf pressed his nose to the back of Steve’s neck. For a second he thought that the wolf was going to bite his neck, but then… then the werewolf nudged him with his snout and whined loudly.
"How 'bout this: we're probably going out again tomorrow," Steve said. "Fair warning. Now please, I'm exhausted, let this old man go get some sleep."
“I know that this isn’t what you want to hear about right now,” Natasha said, her fingers gracing his shoulders, “but the adoption agency was calling again. They didn’t want to say anything to us because they’re only allowed to discuss things with you and… They wanted you to call them back sometime. I can understand if you don’t want to talk with them—I’ll tell them not to call back if you want me to.”
Getting some food into his system did a good job at alleviating the hangover. While he was sitting in the kitchen chatting with this team of Avengers, he'd learned about the vast differences between this world and his own.
metaphorically put his foot down had the impostor not just reached his hand out to gently cup Tony’s cheek.
He glanced over at Steve when his husband put a hand on his leg and gave him a questioning look, as if asking if he was alright. He just gave him a slight smile. Everything was okay. He'd get through this. Bruce would fix it, and then he wouldn't have to worry about it anymore.
The moment that the elevator opened, Tony hurried out. "I'll go get Bruce," he said over his shoulder. "Get Bucky to the medical room."
He was glad that Steve didn't try to go all Captain America on him and force him to leave like a citizen. He
"I believe you, Steve. We're all different here. You should've seen Bruce and Natasha!" Tony chuckled, untying the ropes. "There you go, you're all free. Why didn't you just try running off? I'm sure you could've outrun those guys."
"I promise, no more drunk portals," Clint said. "Or time machines, or any other crazy ideas we come up with. No more."
Steve paused at the door, once more having a strange feeling that there was something wrong. But no, what could be wrong today? Life was so absolutely
. "T-they kept creating these fake memories to break me, when I was the Winter Soldier, a-and they'd make it seem like everything was good and then they'd take it all away and
here, but she’s never allowed to come back here. Never again. Understood?” There was a venom in her voice that told Steve that she was serious, that the townspeople held a big grudge against her. “So if you’re looking for her here, you’re looking in the wrong place.”
Bruce was checking on his leg, and that’s when Steve realized that the doctor had stitched him up and was trying to make sure that he was fine.
pick me up,” Tony said, trying to scoot as far away from the shapeshifter as he could. Those things touched him enough already, when they beat him and cut him and… And he didn’t need one pretending to be Steve, carrying him out to ‘safety.’
, you can't really blame me for freaking out," Tony said, wrapping his arms around his husband. He loved just
“Of course. I told Sam on our run, he promised that he’d stop by sometime to congratulate you, too, but he was thrilled to hear the news,” Steve said, looking so confused about why Tony would be bringing up something like that.
as a couple. She never hurt him though. Lots of lovers he used to have hurt him in the past—they got violent.
"Hey, he's waking up," said an unfamiliar voice. It was pretty clear whoever it was, was talking about him.
“I know that we got off on the wrong foot at first… y’know, back when we first started dating. When I learned that you thought I was only interested in you because you’re a super-soldier… I wasn’t even sure what to think. I was stuck between thinking you didn’t really want to be in a relationship after all, what I’d been fearing the
“No, I’ll just… next time they call, could someone tell me? I have to talk with them,” Tony said, sighing. He turned his attention back over to the toaster, waiting for his blueberry bagel to toast. Clint was sitting with Steve right now, which gave him a chance to go get some food. It had been two weeks now, and while he still spent most of his time in the room with Steve, he was more willing to go and get some food or go get a shower every once in a while.
"котенок, I thought Bruce told you that you shouldn't be working in the lab for a little while," Natasha said as she approached.
Tony groaned as he got to work on wrapping up his wounds. At least these aliens weren’t complete savages. After every beating session where they tortured him for information, they made sure to leave him some bandage wraps and a needle with medical stitching so that he could fix himself up.
he looked so happy. They were tears of joy that were running down his face, Steve knew so as he gently brushed them away and kissed the top of Tony's head.
“There was a kill switch in the data,” Tony mumbled. “If I tried to wake you up, it would leave you braindead.”
Wandering over to the large crowd of people, he listened in to what the person at the center of the crowd was shouting.
"Brace for impact, Cap," Iron Man commanded, though his voice-changer sounded damaged, since his words came out strange, robotic, with a bit of static.
worried about him by now. Especially Steve. Steve would be completely stressed by now. He hoped that Steve wasn't
"We could just go for a stroll around Central Park, find a good hot dog stand, enjoy the evening," Tony mumbled, yawning again. He reached out for Steve, trying to sit up, glad that the super-soldier helped him up so that he was able to wrap his arms around the blond and hug him tightly. "I'm glad you asked me out. While I'm still surprised that someone as wonderful as you would be interested in someone... like
"The jerk shouldn't have been treating you like you couldn't do anything," Steve said, sighing. He did smile though when Tony took his hand, so he counted that as a win. "I really did talk with them, Tony, they just... I
The fire was a little overwhelming—someone had set these on fire on purpose, and had planned this out. That really sucked, because chances were it wasn't just some random attack. They'd been targeting this building for a reason, and he was worried to think that Steve might be the reason. It wasn't like he tweeted it out that Cap was taking him to this place...
He nodded, not letting go of Steve’s hand, though. “I refused to tell them about my family… I refused to say anything that would help them hurt you guys.”
Clint and Natasha were similar, but obviously different. They were all glad he woke up and was fine, and the two ex-assassins had gone to check where Tony had landed, just to make sure that Steve or Clint hadn't shown up, too.
“Steve?” They’d gone to bed at some time past five AM, Tony couldn’t have been completely sure when. The rest of the team had gone to bed around three, but Tony had wanted to stay up and Steve had wanted to hold him, so they’d just spent a while whispering words of comfort and cuddling on their bed.
“No,” Steve said firmly. “No, that’s not okay. I need you to understand how much I love you and how I’ll always choose you over anyone else—”
Bucky asked, and while both Avengers knew that he was talking to Steve, that didn't stop them. Tony undid the mute on Clint's comm upon the archer's request.
Nine AM was definitely far too early to actually be awake, especially since the coffee wasn't done brewing just yet. Last night had been
, Tony,” Steve whispered, though there were tears in his eyes. “That was… They’ll always be in my heart, but they weren’t real. I know that, I understand that, and it’s probably not going to hit me for a while, but… I really do want to start a family with you.”
“Tell me what I need to change,” Tony pleaded, his quiet voice cracking with emotion. “I’ll do anything, Steve, I’ll—”
It wasn't that he was giving up. No, there was still a chance that he could survive this. He'd jumped out of planes before, but he'd always been prepared. He'd never been blasted in the chest first, and
nice to be able to get out and do stuff without constantly being recognized by the public. In fact, the closest anyone had come to recognizing them had been when someone commented that 'his style was similar to Stark's' to which Tony, playing the role of just a citizen, had just replied that Stark must've styled his beard after
Steve agreed, because Thanos had destroyed the stones, their timeline would need new ones. Their universe needed stones.
Were they right? Were they right in thinking that this was all some kind of big joke? Did they think that
“Friday, perhaps? Maybe by then Bruce will tell me that I’m fine,” Steve said. The serum would make sure he’d be fine within a day if he wasn’t already, but Bruce liked to watch them for an extra day or two longer just to make sure. He never let his teammates out into battle if they weren’t completely healed, or at least up to his standard of ‘fine enough to battle.’
Icy tears of his own ran down his cheeks as Steve was pulled into a somewhat sitting position. His left arm ached as it was moved, but it only took a few more seconds to realize that the glove had been removed from his hand.
"I'm going to secure the weapons," Bucky called, running over to one of the other sections of the large plane. If Hydra got ahold of those weapons... He didn't know what
“I thought you were going to bleed out before I could get you to the team,” Tony mumbled. His hands were shaking. “I wanted to kill
"The Hydra agents are only being knocked out, not killed," Tony replied, though he knew that this battle wasn't what they were talking about. It was the ex-assassin they were talking about. It was the mind-controlled Avenger they were talking about. It was the soldier they were talking about. It was the

Clint was. He knew that they were friends, and the archer was the greatest drinking buddy that he ever had, but he never really thought that Clint cared much more than that. "Where's Steve?"
to believe me that I’m only here to get you out,” the man said. It was getting harder and harder to insist that it was an impostor. He was able to copy Steve too well. Had they replaced Steve, too? Had they been stalking Steve like they’d been stalking him?
"I'm not hurt," Tony insisted, still staring at him with wide eyes and a pale face that made Steve think differently. "
Tony grinned nervously, gathering up as much courage as he could as he let Rhodey drag him over towards the other room, towards the aisle.
, probably. Would they do this every couple of nights? Would he have to see his teammates faces again and again as the Skrulls continued to beat him down?
After all, he trusted his husband. It wasn't like Tony was ever going to cheat on him or anything, so he didn't have anything to worry about. The more relaxed and calm Tony was, the more Steve wanted to relax and just enjoy his time with his husband—especially now that he knew that he'd probably have a lot of time
“I talked with Cheryl from the adoption agency a few days ago…” Tony began, unsure of how he wanted to say it. Hey, I know you just woke up, but they’ve got this kid that I’ve already grown emotionally attached to because he’s lost his whole family and he’s a bit of a social outcast because he’s a lot smarter than other kids his age and they don’t like him, plus he’s different because apparently he’s got some early mutant abilities, no doubt caused by stress and trauma at such a young age…
to see Steve right now, but he knew that there was no way for him to hide what he was feeling from his lover. No, Steve was always able to read him like a book.
"I know... you always have been," Tony whispered, pressing a kiss to Steve's cheek before he tried dragging the super-soldier back down into bed. Rolling his eyes, he just settled down again, keeping Tony held so closely that he could feel the cold circle of metal from his arc reactor press against him through the soft fabric of their shirts.
Tony led Steve over to the couch and started showing him some of the plans that he was working on. It totally wasn't because he was tired and wanted to snuggle up against his husband, totally not. At first the super-soldier didn't seem to understand that and instead seemed very focused on everything that he was telling him, smiling and adding comments and all around seeming very happy.
It was the first time either of them had just casually mentioned the fact that they were old to the team, and while everyone seemed instantly uncomfortable for a few seconds, it melted away as Steve wrapped an arm around Tony's waist and started leading him over to their room.
The pet name made Tony smile as he drifted off again, ignoring the insecurities for once to allow himself to feel happy about the fact that Steve Rogers actually
"I want you to be happy," Tony said, unsure of how to explain himself. "And you... you'll be happier with him than with me. That's why I've been searching..."
or something. Just for a couple seconds—uh, green numbers that looked like some sort of code that you and Bruce normally work with—”
"Things will get better," Tony said confidently, turning the rockets on his gauntlet to make them go faster as he attempted to strike the archer.
, was in those eyes. Tony looked sad as he nudged him again. He lied down, and Steve stared at him in confusion.
was your first thought?" Tony asked skeptically. "It wasn't 'oh, he's so old—what if he had a heart attack from walking through the park?' After all, not everyone's a super-soldier."
genuinely like him. Maybe he wouldn't accidentally end up hurting him... "So," Tony said, straightening his shoulders, not missing the broad smile that crossed his date's face, "what do you think about—"
That's why he'd talked with Steve about asking Tony out. He knew that it could be good for both of them. They both obviously cared for one another, and Clint had noticed that in the time they'd been dating, Tony had opened up to the team more, Steve seemed more comfortable at the tower, and they both seemed a lot happier. (Even if it meant that he had to put up with them kissing in the kitchen when all he wanted was some coffee.)
my arm would’ve been enough,” Bucky muttered, though he was smiling now. “It’s good to have you back, Tony. Now that I see what they did to you, I definitely don’t feel bad about the number of aliens I’ve killed. Now—you need to be on that ship where Bruce can patch you up. At least then I know we can get out of here.”
“They said he was gonna be a mindless beast…. But they were wrong,” Steve said, smiling as he hugged the werewolf. “He just needed some time to adjust, see? It’s gotta be pretty traumatic to just suddenly become a werewolf, so you can’t really blame him for being confused…”
"Where am I?" Tony mumbled, but Steve just settled down beside him and curled around the shorter man.
His family… For a second, Steve looked around at the smiling faces and didn’t recognize a single one of them. Bringing a hand up to his head, Steve groaned.
If he stayed the night, he could look for Tony all day and have some time to send the news to the team—everyone was out searching in other places. Natasha, Clint and Bucky had all been searching in the area around where Tony had run off, and Bruce was back at the tower trying desperately to find a way to help Tony.
It was hard to understand that Steve didn't find him repulsive in his old, old age. It was also sweet though—at least he knew that no matter how old he got, Steve was always going to be in love with him. That was sweet, at least.
"I think he's very interested. He asks about you a lot in the lab, whenever you're not around. I've been trying to be encouraging, but... He's still got this idea in his head that because he was brainwashed and used as a weapon against the people he cares about, he must be a bad person who doesn't deserve to be happy," Tony said, hovering in front of Clint's setup. He opened one of the compartments in his left gauntlet, pulling out a little machine he'd made. His faceplate was still up, and he gave Clint a look. "Now, doesn't that sound familiar?"
Next were Sam and Sharon, newer members of their little Avengers family but really good friends with Steve. Sharon, of course, Tony already knew as she was somewhat of a cousin to him, though they had never very close growing up, and Sam seemed cool when Steve brought him back to the tower so Tony was always willing to make new friends. He was glad he did, since they both turned out to be great.
," Tony groaned, leaning against the other man. Steve was still the same warm, solid presence that he'd always been. "That's not a lie. That's just me being old. I just... I also... I mean, maybe if we turn the lights off... I just don't want to have to see myself."
“You’ll be fine,” Bruce assured Tony, gripping his shoulder and giving him a look before he scurried off to find his girlfriend.
Iron Man. That was the one major issue in his life. When he'd come back from Afghanistan and built the first Iron Man suit, he hadn't told the world that he was Iron Man, instead spinning a lie that there was someone else in the suit, his bodyguard. They believed that, because after all, who would believe that a narcissistic, arrogant, spoiled, playboy billionaire would ever set foot in something as dangerous as an Iron Man suit? He wasn't good enough to be a superhero, but Iron Man was.
Bruce and Bucky exchanged looks before Bucky nodded and left the room. Steve was finding it harder and harder to concentrate, the more the medicine was dripped into his wrist, but he had to wait for Tony.
Tony flinched and prepared to fight off the enemy when someone opened the door to the room that they totally weren't
"We're under the car," Tony shouted, slowly rolling out from underneath the vehicle that he and Bucky had been working on. When he managed to sit up, he wasn't surprised to see Steve standing there smiling.
“Stark,” Barnes called in greeting, and he looked like he was already laughing just at the sight of him walking over. Great, Barton or Banner had already told them, and Tony was right to suspect how they might react.
beyond where Hydra was keeping the tech as they tried to move it. "They locked him up, almost like they just wanted his work and then they were going to leave him for S.H.I.E.L.D. to lock up."
It was only moments later when the rest of the team scurried over to congratulate Tony, and Steve too, but the angry super-soldier was still really upset and he’d pushed Bucky away when his best friend tried getting close to him.
"You know, if we were to try to just sit out here and enjoy the day, we wouldn't be able to," Steve said, settling down on a park bench. Tony took a seat beside him, smiling a little when Steve wrapped an arm around his shoulders like a teenager on a first date would. There was a blush on the blond's face, and a soft smile on his lips. How did he end up so lucky as to have Steve as a husband? He'd never know. "I think that's what I like most about this situation. I know that it's going to be fixed, and I'm glad that it's going to be fixed, but I'm glad that we can just enjoy our time a little."
"I do try telling them that a couple of times... I'd rather they not get chased off, but if they're constantly ignoring me then they're going to
, he still didn't remember most of what he was forced to do as Hydra's Asset. They'd tried to help him as much as they could, but honestly Tony thought that Bucky was probably better off without the memories of him being an assassin. Of course, that didn't help when people came after Bucky for some personal vendetta, because there had been people who
He really shouldn't have been surprised that he caught everyone's attention. All five of his teammates were sitting at the table or standing beside it, and yet Steve was the only one who was able to act like everything was normal. Bruce, to be honest, looked like he was trying, and it was hard to read Natasha, so she could've been surprised but failed to show it.
Yes, they’d been willing to do whatever it took to right the wrong Thanos had done five years back, but that didn’t mean that he wasn’t ready to keep that same promise to do everything in his power to make sure they get their happy endings, too. After all, he promised. Whatever it takes. Not every ending needs to end in tears, not every ending needs to end in bittersweet heartache. Not every ending needs to end in death.
Steve wanted to say, because he wasn’t sure if he’d ever be allowed to call Tony ‘his’ again after he’d messed things up so badly all those years ago. Tony may have forgiven him, and they may have been trying to work things out together again, but… he wasn’t sure if he’d ever truly forgive
"I can't imagine being brainwashed," Tony mumbled, making sure that his little machine was set up in front of Clint and his weapons. "I think you two would be good for one another. You might be able to bring some happiness back into his life—he can be pretty grumpy sometimes."
"Actually, I'm bi, so..." Tony mumbled, shrugging. He could feel Steve's gaze on him. God damn it, why did Bucky have to say that? Tony flinched a little when Steve put a hand on his shoulder.
going to be beautiful in my eyes. That's never going to change. No matter how you look—if, God forbid, something terrible happens and leaves you horribly scarred, I would still think you're the most beautiful person I've ever met. And you know why? Because I love
Steve watched in fascination as the werewolf tried to move away from the herbs that were now covering his face, but within seconds the werewolf was gone. A very familiar man, looking completely dazed and confused to be waking up in chains, completely naked, in front of an entire town.
Steve didn’t stick around to see what would happen, no. He needed to get back to his own timeline, to see his friends again, before Howard could catch sight of him. As he dialed his wristband to 2023, Steve’s heart hadn’t felt as light as it did in years.
The only thing that scared Steve more than anything was the possibility of losing a teammate during a battle. They'd become like a family to him, so the thought of never having them around again really hurt inside. They were his
"No," Tony cried out in his sleep, and Steve quickly hugged the other man close when his lover gripped his shirt and tried to pull him closer.
to get it away from them," Tony said, glancing out from between the boards in one of the windows. Hydra didn't seem to realize where they were hiding—he
"I'm glad I'm back, too," Bucky mumbled, yawning. "I think there's something you need to go do, Stevie."
Tony patted his arm before he followed Bucky. If Clint trusted him right now, then he was going to trust him.
, but it was beginning to take a toll on him. He didn't have the same super-soldier stamina as his boyfriend, so by the time morning rolled around, he was
going to use the gauntlet,” Steve murmured, mumbling a ‘thanks’ when Tony took the stone from him and placed it back into the box. “There’s going to be something that happens after Bruce has the gauntlet… something you can’t prepare for. But just know this—no matter what happens, I’ll always be there for you. Okay? Whatever it takes. Things are going to hurt,
Most of the team either didn't know about it, or they just kept out of it. Clint wasn't pretty sure it was the first, or else Steve would be down here dragging their sorry asses off to bed. He'd always been a bit of a Mother Hen to the team, and Clint could see just how much Steve cared about Tony. He was happy for his teammate and friend when the two of them ended up in a relationship together. He'd been the one who'd talked with Steve about the fact that it was okay to be gay in this day and age, to which Steve was very thankful to learn.
Steve nodded, though it was still strange looking at a face so similar to his own Tony's face... yet he was still wearing most of the armor. There was something that he needed to ask his boyfriend, though he might want to wait for the right moment. The instant he was home wasn't the right moment.
When his eyes were able to focus on the gauntlet that was held in front of him, Steve couldn’t help but grin upon only seeing five stones there.
Iron Man descended through the air pretty quickly, placing him down into the grass. He coughed and took a couple deep breaths, rolling over so that he could face Iron Man. His eyes roamed across the familiar suit, a frown forming on his face. This wasn't Iron Man's armor—it was
And Bruce! Bruce was nearly always the Hulk in this world. This Hulk could actually speak in complete sentences, and he was pretty intelligent. The Hulk of Tony's world was smart, he knew that, but he was basically just a rage monster.
we can get out of here for a while. It's been a while since I've taken my fella out, and I think we could both use a night out."
"It's okay," Clint said, gripping his right hand tightly. "We'll just work around the townspeople. All we have to do is take Hydra down and get ahold of the weapons they're smuggling. S.H.I.E.L.D. is on the way, they'll help out."
"Well, there's that too," Bruce said, tugging Tony closer to hug him. "Never think you're not good enough for this team, Tony, because we'd be nothing without you."
Clint took a couple steps back to admire their handiwork. "Maybe you should turn it on. Y'know, to see if it works or not."
“Tony,” Steve whispered, holding him tightly. The sob that he’d been forced to hold back ever since he’d been kidnapped finally escaped him as Tony pressed his face against his lover.
man. A hero," Steve insisted, though he could tell by the look on Tony's face that his lover didn't believe him. "A father should never say such cruel and untrue things to his son. I can't take away what he said, but I
“We’ll be prepared,” Tony promised, looking his lover right in the eye. “I love you, Steve. We’ll make it through this, we’ll make it through an invasion, and we’ll make it through everything. Don’t worry.”
“I’m sorry,” he whispered, pressing his face against his husband. He breathed in that warm scent, of coffee and blueberries and… not grease and oil? Tony hadn’t been working in the lab, he could tell. “I’m sorry. I didn’t know… I thought I
“That’s… what I said, didn’t I?” Steve asked, confused. Howard had been helping him out back in the war, and while they weren’t exactly
“Hey,” Steve shouted the moment that the elevator door opened. He grabbed Tony’s hand, nearly dragging him along to where the team was warming up. As it turned out, all four of them were there, though while Clint and Bucky seemed to be sparring, Natasha and Bruce seemed to be either stretching or doing yoga. But all four were there.
His mind couldn't help but change that small, scared blond boy to a brunet one, the step-father being replaced by an old friend of his.
He arrived at the gym way too quickly, and as Tony walked out across the floor, he tried plastering a fake smile on his face and steeling himself for the inevitable reaction of his teammates.
Tony replied back in Russian. The moment he spoke, he got a lot of strange looks from his teammates. “What? Tasha taught me Russian.”
"Clint," Bucky gasped, and before Tony was able to stop him, the tiny faerie shot out of the bushes and into the fray.
them. Iron Man wasn't a secret in this universe. Why didn't he keep that secret? Tony reached for his arc reactor, stumbling out of the chair he'd been in.
and I’m just a normal guy. And then you gave me a pep talk on how incredible I am with archery and all sorts of weapons and you asked me to help you train you because you felt like you didn’t have enough fighting experience to be an Avenger…”
you? Why did he...?" Tony whispered, and Steve could tell by his breathing alone that the man was full-on panicking.
“So… I’m always going to be here to remind you that if—when you decide to wake up, I’ll still be here, but… if you don’t wake up, I need you to know that your own happiness is enough for me. It always has been. You understand? Y-you’ve got a family who needs you there, and a family who will
It had been those aliens the whole time. His team wasn’t coming to rescue him, not now. It would be a while before they managed to even figure out that he wasn’t really at the tower.
“Steve?” Tony whispered, and he turned his attention to those beautiful brown eyes, watching the little flecks of gold as the medical room light made those flecks glow. “I love you. I know you love me. You don’t have to worry.”
“Mr. Stark-Rogers,” Tony murmured to himself, fidgeting with the ring again. He never thought that a
Tony’s grin was large, but it was faker than the ones he used for the media. Maybe he’d convince Steve to move over to Malibu for a while, so they could enjoy some time as fiancés for a while and wait to see if Steve would regret proposing.
Until it came to that, though, he was going to enjoy every moment that he got with his team, and he was going to do anything he could to keep them safe.
But then there was another gunshot—this time it hit a tree, thank God—and Steve realized that Tony was trying to get him out of the town.
"Who are you? Where am I?" Tony asked, flinching when someone else put a hand on his shoulder. He jerked away, looking up with wide eyes at... Steve?
Tony’s breath caught in his throat, and his heart skipped a few beats. There, at the end of the aisle with the softest, most caring smile on his face, was Steve. He couldn’t help but just
“It worked?” Steve choked out, fighting for the words to be spoken. He forced his eyelids open, though the vision he saw in front of him just blurred his sight even more.
Stark's lab looked quite a bit his own, and Tony couldn't help but want to look around. Stark let him, telling him that he was going to figure out if he could find exactly where he'd come from based on any trans-dimensional energy particles left behind during the event. Rogers led him around the lab, pointing out different things. (He'd obviously spent a
"I thought you already knew this, I'm a genius," Tony said, chuckling. "You just needed a bit of a rewiring—sure, the outside of it still looks like shit, but it shouldn't be hurting anymore, right?"
, which is what Steve heard about before he got there. They were doing a sacrificial ritual to protect their town, and Steve hoped that the sacrifice didn’t include burning the witch—he needed her to turn Tony back.
“Everything’s fine,” he whispered to Tony when he took his spot at the end of the aisle. “I know weddings can be stressful, but I have no worries about this one.”
“I know he loves me, Buck… but he’s not choosing between me and Peggy,” Tony said calmly. It was the truth. But it wasn’t the

hair just turned gray. Not fair," Tony muttered, but he couldn't deny that the gray looked nice. It made him look far more experienced—Steve had been through a lot more than the team ever really thought about, because he typically just looked like he was about twenty-five. But he was older than
"Hey Jarvis, where's Tony?" he asked. How long had it been since he'd cuddled up with Tony? He'd been gone for two nights now, and... Was he even in their room three nights ago? He couldn't remember...
that they’re not sending me out to war. I’ve put my time in, and now I’m enjoying every moment that I can with my family.”
The other man dragged him to his feet, and Steve tried to hold back his grimace of pain as much as possible.
"Thanks J," Tony said, grinning as he carefully pulled himself out of Steve's arms. The super-soldier grabbed his helmet, waiting until Tony got back into the suit before he handed it to him. The issue was, Tony didn't manage to get the helmet back on before Bruce came running into the room.
“Of course it fucking wasn’t,” Steve snarled, glaring daggers at his best friend. “Why would he be joking about something like that? When has Tony
"Create a portal to another dimension," Clint had dared Tony, who had been grinning like a maniac at the time.
," Steve said. He trusted Tony—he trusted Iron Man. It wasn't like this was going to make him lose trust in the armored Avenger. Now he just knew that... instead of a stranger at his side—a stranger he trusted, yes—he now knew that it was the man he cared more about than any other person. It was the man he was in love with.

, let alone when we first got together, or when we got married... I'm always going to be here for you, Tony."
"Glad to know he still thinks of me as his brother, even after all this time," Bucky said, and he could actually hear the quiet joy in his voice. "You do know that he's not going to leave you, 'specially not for me, right? 'Cause when Stevie loves someone... it's with all his heart. And it only took one look at him for me to tell just how much he cares about you."
"I've known since before the Avengers," Natasha said. "I've known you for a long time now, Tony. That wasn't going to get past me. I'm surprised it took Steve so long, with all of the time he spends with you. If anyone would've noticed earlier—"
"So," Steve said, gesturing to one of Tony's other side projects, "you wanna finish telling me about this one before we head upstairs? And maybe after dinner we can lock the lab down, and if you want to work on any of these—light work, nothing too strenuous—then I can help with that."
"He told me about the elderly people that you were saving," Iron Man said. Just having the other man there made him feel calm. It felt like he knew Iron Man more than he really did, which always made Steve relax after a particularly rough battle. He really liked the friendship he'd built with the man. "He seemed happy to me—did
not be giving up now,” Steve said, turning back for a second to look at Tony, to make sure that the man knew that he was serious.
“…Yeah?” He wasn’t surprised that Steve wasn’t asleep yet. The super-soldier had told him all about the grave and the fact that the man had programmed in the ‘your whole family is dead and it’s all your fault’ sequence for when he woke up, which had been why he’d been reacting so…
“After that day… I don’t think I’ve ever questioned your love for me after that day. I was a little worried, sometimes, that we might not work out… after the two of us fought, I was worried that you’d go running for the hills because you would’ve seen the fact that… that I wasn’t good enough,” Tony whispered, choking back another sob. He was strong, he was done crying. “But then I realized that you always came back, no matter what I said, or did… because you did love me.”
“I just want him to be happy, Buck. I know that it’s hard to understand… I want him to wake up more than anyone, but if he’s happy in the world that they gave him… It’s not like he even knows that I exist. If I try to make changes to the simulation, it’s programmed to kill him,” Tony said, looking away from his friend. Of course Bucky understood how much he wanted Steve to wake up—
Was it really such an outrageous thought that someone with his kind of past would one day get married? Or was it the fact that he was getting married to someone as great as Steve that caused the archer to doubt the validity of his future wedding?
But there was no way that Steve actually just asked him that. He knew that his jaw was hanging open, but he couldn't help it! He'd only had a crush on Steve since...
He fell off of the train, during that one mission after it had gone so horribly wrong. “I-I remember now. Sorry, sometimes I just… I could’ve sworn I just saw him not that long ago.”
. The feathers started about at his hips, completely coating his legs, There were a couple of long feathers that looked to be almost like a tail. Clint's arms were covered in feathers too, and looked kind of like wings. Tony shook his head, trying to clear his vision.
“With S.H.I.E.L.D.’s resources it only took a week to find where the spaceship was,” maybe-impostor-Bruce spoke up. “The hard part was getting the alien to talk. We had to get S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel to interrogate because… it was hard to force him to talk when he had your face, Tony. It’s longer than anyone would’ve wanted, but we’re here now—we’re bringing you home.”
to help Tony, to get him back to normal. If he could find the witch, he could force her to fix him. Then all he’d need to do was find Tony—who had run off, while he
“I love you,” he murmured, but the prying look on his lover’s face was enough to bring the emotions right out of Tony. Tears started welling up in his eyes, and he looked away. “I was showing off the ring this morning, because I thought
should’ve realized something was up if they saw you reacting how I saw you reacting,” Steve pointed out, huffing angrily. Tony just smirked and turned around so that he could kiss his lover.
It wasn’t what he’d thought it would be, walking down the aisle. He’d been worried that he wouldn’t be able to breathe, that his heart would be beating too quickly and he’d end up having heart trouble. Instead, he was able to confidently stroll down to where the pastor was standing. The older man smiled at him, giving him a slight nod.
—but he didn’t want to listen. He was trying to save Tony—the townspeople were trying to kill Tony. Where was Tony?
Looking up into those eyes, Steve wanted to cry. That intelligence that he’d been searching for before, that
“Tony is… in the other room,” Bucky said, pausing to look out the door for a second. “He’s here at the tower—you found him, Steve.”
Tony laughed. "It's your subtle way of threatening people to stay away from me. Don't think I haven't seen you at the galas—you give anyone who tries flirting with me that death-glare of yours—"
"You can do that," Steve said, rolling his eyes and smiling when Stark laid out across both Captain Americas' laps. While Stark got comfortable, he finished up the drawing that he was working on. He wasn't surprised to find that his alternate had the same love for art that he did, so they decided to just sketch out their own teams, for the other universe. If he saw anyone in his own universe that was on this team, he'd definitely see about befriending them and making them Avengers.
Steve was ready to crash after a long day of searching. His muscles were sore, he felt like he hadn't slept in a week, and somehow Bucky had managed to get away again. Of course, he didn't disappear until after they'd taken down the groups of Hydra agents that had been attacking them. He had a little bit of time to actually talk with Bucky—the man
tried to take over the world with his alien army, and Tony fought alongside Thor, another alien of Asgard.
"Tony Stark... isn't the man people think of when they think of Iron Man," Tony said slowly, still looking cautious. He looked like he wanted to run off, so that he wouldn't have to face Steve. "The team... they wouldn't want me—"
“Guess I should’ve checked the date this morning,” Tony mumbled, feeling like a complete and total idiot. April Fools Day? Of
"You think he might be interested? I mean... I'd try arguing he's from the forties, but so's Steve, and he asked you out pretty quickly," Clint murmured, getting his bow and arrows ready before setting up his long-range icer guns.
There had to be something wrong with him, but he just wasn’t ready to tell Peggy about it. Not yet. He didn’t want her to worry, he didn’t want anyone to worry about the fact that he was seeing things and forgetting things and remembering names and faces that didn’t exist.
"Whenever you want, I'll never say no to blueberry bagels," Tony said. Seeing him smile made Steve want to never see that smile disappear. He couldn't remember loving someone else this much—he cared about Peggy, and always would, but he'd never actually gotten a chance to have anything more than a crush on her. With Tony, they'd spent time together, he'd fallen in love with the other man and he never wanted to let go.
When Tony removed his helmet, he kept his eyes squeezed shut for a few moments, probably waiting for some kind of reaction. When he didn't get one, he opened his eyes and looked around at the team.
"Mad? Why would I be mad?" Steve asked, keeping a gentle arm around Tony's waist. "I told you, Tony, I'm never going to think less of you for hiding your identity, or for being Iron Man. I've known that you were a good person long before I knew you were Iron Man."
"Are you hurt?" Steve demanded, trying to figure out how to get the suit open. "Tony, where are you hurt? You're pale—I need to get you somewhere fast—"
“No, I can make it. You’ve already got enough that you’re dealing with,” Steve said quickly. He loved cooking and baking, but Peggy was always trying to do that for him. Back in the wartime she’d admitted to him just how horrible of a cook she was, but that must’ve been a lie because she was
Tony had designed the earpieces in a way that they'd constantly be transmitting sound, and if someone mentioned a specific name—or codename—those ones would be louder, or the volume would be increased if the earpiece was tapped. But regardless, the earpieces were almost
Tony starts to get comfortable with the situation, Steve learns the truth about saving Tony's life, and Tony has a revelation about his husband's love for him.
"It's fine though, 'cause we're both here, and everything will be fine soon," Tony said, patting his husband's back. "I just thought you should know, because... because that says a
"And I'll fix that, don't worry," Bruce said. "S.H.I.E.L.D. is finishing up their analysis of the weapon today, but then I'm taking it back here and I'm going to make sure that it'll reverse its effects."
"I need a copilot," Clint called. Good, he'd managed to secure the controls, they could get the plane out of danger and save the crew.
“You’ve got this, Tony,” Clint murmured, patting his back as he walked by. “We’ll be down there with you in a minute, but you’ve gotta go first.”
"I'm not old anymore—it's great," Tony said, grinning. "No more chest pain, no more aching joints. I'm good."
Steve could feel the blood running down his leg—he needed to get that bullet out, this was going to be a
"Yes," he admitted quietly. There was a predatory look in Steve's eyes. That smile of his definitely wasn't as innocent as everyone always seemed to think.
“I know,” Steve murmured, gently squeezing his hand. “I know, Tony. I was a little out of it a while ago, but I remember. You… you’re able to
“Of course I do,” Peggy replied. “Sometimes I just worry about you… after all, what if… what if something bad happens?”
“Sorry, but they died the moment that they changed—once they change, they don’t change back,” the guy said, shrugging. “Curse doesn’t come off.”
He seemed to get why Tony wanted to be on the couch when Tony wasn't able to hold back his yawns. Steve put an arm around him and held him a little closer.
“It really doesn’t look like there’s anything wrong… perhaps it was just the screen?” Tony asked, looking over to his team. It definitely didn’t look like Clint thought that.
For Tony, he had never felt so good in the morning as when he was heading downstairs to show off his new ring and inform his team of the good news: that soon he’d be going by the name of Tony Stark-
But the time they’d made it to the edge of the forest, Steve was a bit delirious. He’d lost a lot of blood, and he swore that he was starting to hallucinate. He hadn’t actually managed to tell his team where he was, but… but that looked like Bucky and Clint and Natasha who were running over to him.
“Hey J, where are Tasha and Bucky?” Tony asked, taking a deep breath. “Might as well tell them too, unless perhaps Steve already did? No, probably not, not if he went running with Sam early in the morning.
That frowning look that he had on his face was gone, and Tony was thankful. He didn’t like that look.
Tears filled Bucky's eyes, and before Tony knew that he was moving, he was already halfway across the room, holding tightly to the injured brunet as Bucky hugged him.
Tony almost didn’t want to tell anyone else. Clint, sure, that kind of made sense with the way that they joked around. Perhaps he was just joking around right now? But that didn’t explain Bruce’s reaction. That didn’t explain why the one person who
He stood up, moving closer. He wanted so badly to just hug his friend, like no time had passed since the two were just kids in Brooklyn, but he knew that
Tony nodded. “They get really angry, really quickly. And they’ve all got strength that rival’s a super-soldier, and they can look like
"You did. You found me," Bucky said, snuggling closer to Tony. "You found me, I'm here now, and I can't wait to be home."
As Tony dragged himself over to the door, he glanced back to where he'd left the suit. The thing had been a pain to get off, but at least Jarvis was able to remove most of it. In a way, he wanted to just put it back on and pretend that nothing had happened, pretend that he still looked and felt just the same way as he always had.
It wasn't something he liked to think about—anyone dying in battle, really. But he thought about it a lot—constantly, every time he led the team into the fray. It
"You can have him," Stark said, smirking as he took his Steve's hand. "I've already got my Steve, thanks. And while more Steves might be
When Tony closed his eyes, finally able to fall asleep in his husband’s arms once more, he missed the way that the world around him flickered with green ones and zeroes, just for an instant.
"Bucky," Steve said before he was able to even think about it. The other super-soldier, who'd been quite focused on the ground for a while looked up like he was startled, like he hadn't expected to see them outside the tower.
“What’s wrong?” Bruce asked as he started looking over the machines. Turning his attention to Steve, he murmured, “He’s going into shock…”
, it's not even late yet," Tony murmured, smirking when Steve wrapped his arms around him, resting his chin on Tony's shoulder.
“This is bullshit,” Steve murmured, surprising Tony when he lifted his chin to give him a passionate kiss before he grabbed his wrist and started leading him back over to the elevator.
