Tony pushes his chest forward and the arc reactor in the chest lights up before slicing through the whale’s neck and both pieces go flying.  Tony jumps off the side, and notes Barnes and Cap are just next to where the head is projected to land by Fry. He pushes the thrusters coming into their eyeline fast.  “Grab on,” he yells, and the suit stretches, giving them both handles on his shoulders seconds before he reaches them.
He thins his lips and looks into Steve’s eyes.  “It’s a good room,” he says. “I think I want to take a nap though.”
He takes in a breath before adding, “Because I really want to fuck you to make sure we’re both still here.”  It’s not the whole truth, but Tony’s not ready for that.  Not yet.
They stay there on that couch, like they had for multiple afternoons before this moment and after. Quiet in each other’s presence. Steady.
The footage goes on for a while, switches angles or feeds.  It’s the compilation he had had FRIDAY put together, right after.  Tony still hasn’t watched it.
Tony beams back and turns back to the table where he was fiddling with what would eventually be a voice recording device.
He looks to Steve, naturally waiting to hear the other man say the call.  Steve meets his gaze and starts with, “Avengers…” and looks at Tony expectantly.
Tony breathes through his nose quickly.  “Okay first off, I was hooked up to a car battery and I needed to move around. Also, prisoner in the middle of Afghanistan, so I kind of had to work with I had, which was palladium.  AND, once I got out, I worked on fixing the issue.”
Tony follows as his dad leaves the cozy Jarvis home.  They do into the lab, gleaming metal everywhere, tools strung across every surface.  Dad makes quick work of drilling the holes, soldering the battery holder and five multicolored lights in place.  He hands it back to Tony to slide the quarter sized battery into place.
Tony’s lips twist, because it’s true but he still thinks he is getting foot traffic because he’s the undead freak.  The second exhibit will be the true showing.
Tony waves over the clammering press and heads out the same side exit Ross had taken earlier. The younger Ross is close on his heels. "You need to support the Accords publicly Stark," he tosses the second the doors close behind him.
“Hey,” Tony grins easily. He’s been faking it since he was four, his Dad at his side as he smiles with the circuit board for the first of many newspaper clippings.
Tony picks up the tablet, fingers smudging the screen as he types. "I have a lot of things to do Rhodey. Just because I don't spend five billion hours in the same room as my baby android, doesn't mean I blame him."
Tony shrugs.  “Nah, JARVIS makes the observations, and I just help him piece together correlations in the data.  He’s made all of you, since you guys are guests here once a month, part of his mother hen protocol.  That’s like 20% my fault.  Rhodey gets the rest of the fault, because he influenced J when he was just a baby AI.”
Bruce is grinning in the rear view mirror, when Tony looks.  “Did I tell you the test worked this morning?”
“One sec,” Tony tells Rhodey.  “The children are conspiring against us.  What are you saying to FRIDAY Viz?  I need to remind you that I helped create you, so you should be on my side and not Rhodey’s!”
“Still a no.”  He finds a stubborn knot on Tony’s heel and starts working on that.  Tony inadvertently lets out a low groan.
Wanda ensnares the second sniper in her red haze and brings them both to the ground.  She is speaking rapidly into the the communicator as she wraps the men in layers of metal railing to keep them penned to the ground, unable to move.
“Brain scans are necessary now?” Tony snarks, expanding out the data.  He stills the steady stream and reads it slowly.  “Are you monitoring my brain when we launch the BARF protocol?”
He’s familiar with the goggles death of a comrade gives you.  He’s a superhero and seen enough of his friends die and be resurrected.  He knows all about that sort of guilt that twists memories.
Tony heads their way.  “How did our boy do?” Rhodey asks when Tony gets close.  Bruce is watching him closely.  Vision is scanning the building, probably downloading the footage to review himself.
But some days, Tony's heart stutters, and it's harder to get up out of a chair, and he can feel the well worn tiredness of knowing his body has betrayed him one, twice, many times before.
It wasn’t a choice, this honor and sense of duty.  Their Gods demanded it, and in turn, they had been blessed with the traits their families had inherited.  A closeness between physical and spiritual. A balance.
“Ant-Man has been spotted taking down another bomber,” the anchor says. A kid is furiously clicking on the trigger, but the bomb is disconnected, and Tony is reminded of the suit when it fritzed in Germany.  Lang gets back to normal size behind the kid, and puts him on a hold until the kid passes out.  He takes the vest off before laying the kid on the ground.  He looks around for a moment before spotting a light post and handcuffing the kid to it.
Hawkeye and Thor had been exchanging stories of ever increasing ridiculousness about different challenges they had been a part of. Tony definitely doesn't believe he had been a part of a bicycle gang for a cover, and Thor, hopefully, hadn't run naked through what sounded like an Amazonian goddess filled planet as a part of his of age ceremony.
Because once he could have turned to someone else and admitted he didn't know how to fix this. He could have turned to Fury and listened to the rant about fixing problems that didn't need fixing, Pepper's fond speeches about, Tony he just needs someone outside of all this, or St-
Tony pauses for a moment.  He remembers what it was like in the early days.  Just trying to keep everything under control.  One mission to the next. “We can do this tomorrow too.  Unless something is broken.”
“An experiment,” Tony declares.  His new favorite codeword has his mother grinning.  She loves his experiments.  He comes and explains them all to her, and Dad watches a smile at the edge of his lips, and Tony always thinks,
Steve’s eyes dilate, but he doesn’t move. “Tell me you’re okay with this.” His hand is on Tony’s jean clad knee, hot and heavy even through the fabric,
Tony finishes his sandwich, before he questions, “By nothing new to you, do you mean gay people in general or all the intricacies of being gay?”
“Visit,” Spidey replies as he perches on the stainless steel table beside Tony.  “And it looks like you have version 2 specs.  I
He knew better than to try and pick a fight. He knew that Maria hated it, and it would result in nothing but awkward silences at dinner. Sure, Tony didn’t want to go, and yeah, the project with Bruce was a lie to go and sneak out to Pepper’s room for the evening, but Tony knew better than to try and stress the situation, especially since he was at a disadvantage currently, with how Maria seemed genuinely upset about Tony’s insistence on outing from their family dinner.
“Go Fish.” He said into the palm of his hand, staring down at his own cards. Each one had a different cartoon fish, all labeled with both the scientific and normal names of the individual species. It was silly, but he and Morgan used these cards all the time when they played together, and Natasha didn’t seem to mind. She smiled, actually.
Tony looked up at the man who has shown him far more kindness and love than his father ever had, and swallowed.
Perhaps the Sun and the Sea had a thing? A secret thing. The Sun always seemed to try to escape the Sky. However, the Sun only came by once or twice a day to kiss the Sea along a horizon, and even then, was he really doing that? Was he really kissing the Sea, or was it just a trick of the mind? Flat-Earthers might say that the Sun was, in fact, kissing the Earth, but if you didn’t believe in that kind of thing, you’d know that if you walked a long time, you’d see a change in perspective-the Sun never kissed or touched the Sea, it just looked like he did.
“Well then, I refuse to waste any more time.” Tony said gently, eyes fluttering slightly as he leaned forward.
Tony realized, as he stepped onto the caressing Cement who hugged the Sand, that maybe the world was really just a huge, heaping mess of confused love.
Tony tried to tell himself that when he sat up from the Sand, who he felt so much sympathy for. Tony looked to the Sea in disgust, the Sky in earnest for her to realize that the Sun had only seen her as a best friend and nothing more, for the Sky to notice the Moon, who tried his best to be there for her but was so unsure. Tony looked to the Sand and wanted to tell her she was being lied to, but couldn’t bring himself to tear her heart out. He looked back to the Sea in confusion, and for a moment he understood. The Sea couldn’t help himself. He loved the Moon, and the Moon was lost most nights.
"The other room is-is very dark, and-and I don't-is it-can I stay in here?" Tony whispered shakily, his voice wet, and slightly overcome with the idea of having to ask at all. Tony knew what would happen if he even dared shuffle into the room of his parent's in the dead of night, and the idea that Steve might react the same way had the poor boy on edge, but ready to run from any hands that may attempt to reach his face.
The ocean waves rippled, kissing the sand as she drew back and forth in the tide. The salt licked the wooden legs of his chair and the exposed toes of his feet. Occasionally, the ends of his grey sweat pants caught the splashes of the ocean’s personal game, the rocking back and forth in between the two figures sat on her beach, and the pull of the sun on the horizon.
He smiled, but it quickly dropped as the air conditioning came on, and hit his side of the bed pretty hard.
Tony frowned just slightly, before tensing and turning in his chair, the weight of his movements creaking the wood and sinking it further into the muddy, ocean-kissed sand.
Anthony Stark was a mama’s boy, and he wouldn’t deny it one bit. He was proud to love his mother the way lightning loved turning sand into glass.
But today was different, for some reason. Steve had gotten a real glimpse of Tony in his natural element, surrounded by Bruce and Stephen, not by the boys and girls who had no faces (They didn't have faces because they didn't interest Steve; they were a herd, sheep, blank, crumpled up pieces of paper that followed at Tony's footsteps, rolling their bodies and dancing enthusiastically to the music that left his mouth wherever he went).
Maria tapped her fingernail on her mug for a bit, thinking, before deciding to leave the living room, leaving her son to stand in the kitchen and wonder when he would be able to escape the confines of his perfectly, perfect life.
Steven Grant Rogers was his full name and he didn’t like Steven or Grant, but he liked Rogers. Roger this! Roger that!
For now, though, Steve felt the urge like so many other times when he painted live portraits, to get up and cup Tony's face, get into the whiff of the music that played from not only his mouth, but his hair and teeth too, and especially his eyes. He wanted to hold his face, study it closely, because Steve always wanted to get things right, especially if he were going to paint it.
But sometimes when she kissed him it didn’t settle well with his skin. Her lips were too soft, it made him feel wrong in comparison, and her boobs always felt uncomfortable against his chest.
“No.” She said firmly and moved to get up, heading to the kitchen. “Mom…” Tony frowned, sitting up and following her. “Bruce and I have this project-” “I don’t want to hear the excuses, Tony, you do this once every month.” She huffed.
Steve Rogers was not the only big and broad new student at Tony’s High School. Thor Odinson was a foreign exchange student, and much like Stark, had a smile that drew people in. His presence was electric, and he smelled like the Sun, tasted like the ocean. Talking to Thor was like driving through a storm; you got distracted easily, and then suddenly you’ve gotten whiplash from moving too fast, thus slipping off the road and heading towards a nearby cliff, where you would dive into the sea if you hadn’t stopped so abruptly at the edge. Sometimes, though, with how alluring that thunderous glow that radiated from Thor’s skin and his hearty laugh, people were tempted to jump that cliff, and let the sharp waves embrace them. Being next to him was like drowning, but the good kind, the kind where you grew gills and let the salty sea fill your lungs and you breathed him in, and he wrapped around you.
Steve showed no sign of breathlessness, but he felt like he was. Though on the outside Steve was just staring blankly at the boy across the cafeteria, squinting every now and then, internally he stroked Tony's skin with different sized brushes, desperate to get this new piece, this discovery of something unimaginably unique and different, right. Steve somehow had become addicted to studying the way Tony smiled, his teasing eyes, the way he kept running fingers through his brown locks every minute.
Steve, embarrassed at being caught in the act of staring, blushed a gentle pink that scattered his light skin.
Tony’s gaze fell onto the Sea, who gladly pressed himself into the Sand. Now that was a man, feeding his partner all the love he could give, over and over again, salty kisses pressing into the grains, making her wet-
He hadn't been ready to sleep alone, which, okay, Tony could do, but not in the unfamiliar darkness of Steve's home.
"St-Steeb?" He peeped quietly into the night, nervously shuffling his weight from foot to foot, staring down at Steve's slowly waking form, which had begun to stir at Tony's entrance just moments earlier.
Tony knew his mother’s habits like the back of his hand, how she would go to the fridge and pout and stare, stuck in between stress eating or stress cooking. It was an adoring habit.
However, it became clear as Tony took a seat in the sand that there was, in fact, a fourth subject, who seemed far away. Did the Sky count as a fourth subject? They say that the Sky's the limit-which is complete bullshit, if you’d ask Tony, not that he liked space-but where exactly did the Sky begin? It seemed to Tony that, if you looked off into the horizon, you could see the Sky pressing against the Sea and-Oh. Another subject-the fifth. The Sun, trying to escape the sky by pressing into the Sea. If that wasn’t the epitome of innuendoes-no, no it was. Tony laughed to himself.
Steve smiled at Tony’s immediate reaction, chuckling slightly. “No, that’s not what I meant. I mean I left, came back. I… I gave Sam the shield, and... I met Morgan, Tony.” He said gently.
The two stared at one another, Steve’s eyes gentle and full of an ease Tony had never been blessed with, neither in life or even now. The genius flustered and squirmed under his all too caring gaze, and cleared his throat, looking away once again.
And honest to God, somehow Steve became the one to stare, somehow he was really beginning to take notice of Tony Stark, the way he smiled, how his eyes always seemed so wide yet characteristically laid back and squinted with interest and tease. It was his eyes that Steve wanted to explore every earthly shade with, and he knew that he'd spend hours on Tony's eyes if he were on a canvas in Steve's bedroom.
Promise this shit will get so good, just be patient. I'm gonna try and upload as regularly as I can, make sure I split enough time in my day to make room for drawing and writing. I start school in a month from now, so I cant tell you how regular my upload schedule will be but I wanna try my best and do this fic. I have a lot of ideas for it and I wanna complete something for once, haha.
It seemed Steve had far too much to be thankful for. Every second was something that he knew was making up for his parents. He had to appreciate what life gave to him because if he didn’t, it could all be taken away so quickly.
When Tony drove home he usually had a friend on his arm most days, either it being Bruce or Pepper or Happy, but today was a Stark day. They were all going to go out to dinner, as if spending family time really cemented that perfect familial vibe they had going on when the Stark doors opened.
“But Tony, I saw worlds, timelines where you and I fall in love, over and over again.” He swallowed.
Maria was pacing in the living room, mug to her chest. In response to Howard, who had made his sudden, quiet appearance, she turned to look at Tony, who came into view just moments later, standing at the doorway between the living room and kitchen. “Hey, dad.” Tony gave him a grin, but it never met his eyes.
See, he needed his bear in order to sleep. He needed it, or he simply couldn't close his eyes without feeling safe. And his teddy made him feel safe!
And because Thor was made to do that, he got up and left the cafeteria to follow in her footsteps, despite the screaming terror in the back of his mind that made excuses about how something was not right with the way his feet hit the ground, how he should really be focusing on finishing his story that he had been telling to Fandral at lunch, how he should go talk to Tony Stark about the astronomy assignment he didn’t quite get, or talk to Barton about the math homework they had received the night prior.
Maria’s music guided Tony’s footsteps into the large mansion the way the smell of honey guided a bear to a bee kingdom. He floated on air, tension releasing from his core as a warm, happy, lovely feeling filled him from head to toe.
Since then, he had been moving back and forth. Adoption never presented itself, and Steve lived most of his life surrounded by other kids who couldn’t breathe by themselves, couldn’t walk by themselves, couldn’t think by themselves.
Ah, what Tony would give to receive some sort of lovely recognition from his father, as if it were something he should earn and not be given unconditionally.
Tony sat up abruptly and licked his lips, staring at the Sea. Though the stars were visible there the Sun was, dipping into the Sea, peeking over and cascading his final, deep, orange breaths along the Earth that Tony could only see suffering from the lack of him.
Tony turned to look at Steve, the way his hair draped across his pillow, and the way his small frame lifted and fell under the covers.
"Mm?" The blonde mumbled, sitting up and rubbing his eyes, a small pout forming on his little pink lips.
“Oh, so that’s the greeting I get?” Steve asked, walking over from where the ocean crashed into the back of his calves, soaking his sweat pants. He walked gracefully out of the sea, approaching the two and their table of Go Fish, all while Tony stood up and rushed over.
Later that evening, when the tides grew stronger and the ocean swallowed the sun, Steve and Tony found themselves content in sitting in the sand while Natasha did handstands on the beach, elegantly and gracefully walking her fingers along the mud.
Though Tony had a big, teasing mouth, he caught people’s interest because he seemed both in and out of touch. One moment you felt like you were his best friend, and the next you realized you were just like everyone else that kissed his gravity. Steve was the opposite, but all the same in a different sense. He was kind, caring, always remembered your name, but still remained closed off, secretive, and with his pack of friends that you would never find yourself in even if you dreamt it.
Tony stared at him and swallowed thickly, before leaning forward and kissing him gently on the mouth.
“Oh God, now you’re the one staring.” Sam whined and threw a carrot at him. Steve was broken from his painting and he blinked rapidly, turning his attention back to his friend. Taken from the world he had been addicted to, reality fell into place, and Tony Stark, as Steve gave him one last glance, was no longer covered in vines and vibrating a golden glow. He was no longer teasing him with his eyes and quirked mouth. Stark was just Stark, sitting across the lunch room, conversing and nodding as Stephen seemed to have his attention.
Most days Thor would find himself happily snuggling up to Jane’s back, holding her sides, rubbing her soft, thin stomach. He found himself content with touching her, kissing her hair, smelling her skin. It could have been perhaps the relaxed affection he always felt for any human, romantic or platonic.
Every creak in the house, every sound of settlement, put Tony on edge. He had his teddy pressed to his chest, but it wasn't enough, and it was getting to the point that Tony couldn't breathe without feeling like he was going to drown on nothing.
The Sun looked like he kissed the Sea, but he didn’t really. The Sun looked like he wanted to run from the sky, but he didn’t really. The Sun looked like this and the Sun looked like that, but the Sun was just doing his job.
my home.” He said softly. Tony’s eyes widened and he looked back at him, surprised, though Steve kept his gaze on the ocean, smiling contently at the sea.
The waves crashed at their feet, and Tony would have usually stumbled, but Steve kept them steady as he held the smaller man close to him. Tony looked younger, like the weight of the world had never settled on his shoulders, or buried deep into the bags of his eyes. His frown lines had disappeared, and his hair was curly and thick on his head, the darkest brown it had ever been. Steve loved it.
Steve began with the outline of Stark's skin, picking up a metaphorical paintbrush. Tony glowed a deep yellow unlike any other, holding much contrast to Sam's golden vibrant highlights. In the shades of his skin, he turned a deep, camo green that Steve found himself adoring. He painted Tony's hair and eyebrows with dark green acrylics and browns.  He was different, odd, almost uncomfortable to paint at first. Steve focused himself in on Tony, just him, blocking everyone else out. He envisioned Stark on a piece of white paper, animated by the curve of his jaw and his eyebrows, the quirk of his mouth and his eyes. Just the way he fucking breathed made Steve want to pay attention, just so he could get this right.
SORRY THIS TOOK SO LONG I HAVE NO EXCUSE BUT I DO HAVE THE WHOLE PLOT FINISHED SO I KNOW WHAT IM GONNA BE WRITING SO LITERALLY ALL MY WRITER'S BLOCK WILL JUST BE FROM LAZINESS AND NOT JUST FROM NOT KNOWING WHAT TO WRITE OKAY BYE
“See, there’s a flaw in that comment. If I did that, then I’d be taking up your time on the piano, which means half as less practice and music-making from you. Who knows what would happen...” Tony sat up, watching his mother chuckle and shake her head as she walked over to sit on the opposite side of the couch, reaching over to grab her mug of tea from the coffee table.
“I mean, it, you know. You, being my home, being around every corner of my life,” He said. “I couldn't be happier with where I ended up." He swallowed and shifted just an inch closer to him.
“Because..” Steve swallowed. “You’re my family, and…. and I love you. I never stopped loving you. I love Peggy, I love the Commandos, but you made me have a purpose in the future-”
His loving parent Sarah Rogers and his somewhat loving parent Joseph Rogers met at a tiny little cavern near a tiny little farm in Ireland somewhere, and later migrated to New York where Steve was born in Brooklyn.
This is essentially another filler, fluffy chapter. I'm really sorry :(. I'm still working on the outline of the story, but I've almost got it complete. Probably wont update again until after Christmas, as I'm doing an art project with a friend of mine :D, and obviously midterms are coming up (i have those at the end of every semester).  As much as I love writing, it is really hard for me sometimes so I deeply apologize. Next chapter, real plot will weave its way through.
Tony popped an eye open and grinned widely at the affection. Tony’s smiles for his mother were far different than the ones at school, the rehearsed grins and staged fabrications. It was all for play and performance, never genuine.
And then, Tony tore his gaze away to see the Sea, who crashed himself into the Sand. There they go again, except if you looked close enough, if you knew, you would see that the Sea crashed into the Sand only because he craved the mysterious Moon, who cascaded his light onto the Sea. He wasn’t enough for the Sand or the Sky, but he was enough for the Sea, who simply acted and thought of him, how he made him feel, how he made him tug, pull back, push forth-
When he was named Son, the world flipped upside down and buildings stood from the sky. Gravity did a reverse for Steve Rogers, who was born at 11:59 PM, right on the brink of extinction between the 4th of July and the 5th in the year 2000.
And that familiar feeling was coming on again, Jane taking Thor’s knee, rubbing up his thigh under the cafeteria table and smiling sweetly at him. Her eyes enticed, and though she was just a simple raindrop compared to Thor’s thundering smile, she was confident by now that this could become more exciting as the days passed by.
Steve didn’t like school. He didn’t care all that much for chemistry or physics, didn’t mind math. History presented itself to Steve because history was a story, you just had to tell it right.
She looked back down at the keyboard fondly and began to sing softly. Tony felt himself drift from reality, allowing her words to carry his body into the couch, laying back and fluttering his eyes shut.
“Is it true?” Tony asked. “That you saw us, falling in love?” He asked, voice soft with uncertainty, but also layered with hope. Steve nodded, stepping forward and placing his hands on Tony’s waist. Tony’s own went to his jawline, caressing his cheeks.
She was nothing without the Sun, just a dark canvas painted with the places where past lovers had touched her.
“Good.” Howard grunted and nodded. “Let me finish this thing downstairs and we can go, darling.” He said simply and kissed Maria’s head before making his exit back to the basement. After hearing the door shut, Tony let out a sigh, looking away sourly.
Thor loved Jane. He did, he honestly did. But he loved a lot of people too. He loved Steve Rogers, for instance; he was a great sparring buddy, and he always put up a fantastic fight in wrestling. He talked to Tony Stark about astronomy, and Thor admired the way that Tony was always open to discuss the topic with him despite his crippling unsettlement with space. He loved Loki the same way he loved Heimdall, his mother, and his father. He loved Darcy Lewis, one of Jane’s freshman buddies, and her boyfriend. They were fun and interesting and exciting, and so was the rest of the school, even if he had only gotten a glimpse of a person.
A moment’s pause passed between them, and Tony stood in the sand, before stepping forward and placing a hand on his shoulder, because who was he to take away Steve’s heaven? Nobody just decides to spend the rest of eternity with their bestie on a whim. Steve wanted to be here.
"Why the long face, Anthony? From what I've been told, you had been looking forward to this all week." Jarvis smiled, clearly referencing the week's prior drives home when he had initially heard about the sleepover and had gotten his ear talked off about it by Tony at nearly every pick-up and drop off.
It was 11:30 PM at the Rogers' residence, and Tony had been doing fine for the most part. Mrs. Sarah was very nice and made them spaghetti and meatballs, and even let him and Steve watch T.V. a little bit past bedtime.
When Tony got home he entered to the sound of piano playing from the living room while their butler, Mr. Jarvis, took his bag and greeted him about his day. Howard, like usual, resided in the basement or garage whenever he got home from work, and since today was a Stark day, that’s what he was doing the moment Tony stepped inside.
Tony felt the weight of his bag deepen in his lap, and he sniffled just slightly, quietly. He knew Jarvis wouldn't yell at him for crying, but Tony knew there were cameras in the car, and he couldn't risk his father seeing him cry.
When Joseph died, their last name went from Rogers to Lost. Sarah and Steve Lost, lost the man that was supposed to keep his family healthy, support his family. Roger this. Roger that.
His fingers itched for a moment and he glanced up at Tony very briefly, before resting his gaze upon him. He was laughing, smiling at Bruce Banner, who looked absolutely grumpy. Steve took note to ask what was wrong later, but for now he focused his attention on Stark
He chewed his lip, clutching his bear to his chest, before finally walking over to Steve, pushing him just a little bit to stir the smaller boy.
Odinson was confident like Stark, but levelheaded like Rogers. He wasn’t stupid, though he had trouble understanding American phrases sometimes, and had long gorgeous blonde hair that shocked you if you ever had the chance to run your fingers through it. His everything was electric, enticing, and his voice could melt glaciers it was so warm and heated. Every word of his was a blanket coming to tuck you in bed.
Nat reached forward, took a card, and then leaned back as she looked at him gently, chewing her peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Bucky was blue, brown, and white, much like Sam's gold, red, and brown. Steve had known James the longest out of everyone at the table, therefore being the first person he ever painted. He had been painting him for a long time, but never seemed to be able to break out of the comfortable shell that was Bucky's natural aura. It was almost uncomfortable to think Bucky could be anything else other than the browns that shaded his blue frame and the glittering whites that highlighted him. Bucky was charming, sweet, adorable, and kept Steve's feet grounded to the earth. He was a ship made of logs, sitting at sea against the salty wind of the world. He was easy, searching, longing, and Steve could see that unending curiosity that had been embedded in his eyes from long ago.
Jane had already experienced that a few times. She knew what it felt like. She felt good to know that even that tiniest piece of her boyfriend was specifically for her, knowing that everything else, every part of Thor, from his electric hair to his blue ocean toes and thundering eyes, was for everyone else.
Bruce was different; Though he was much like Natasha and Clint with his moon-like hue that traveled across his skin, and though he always wore those round, golden rimmed glasses across his nose with his messy golden brown hair that fell into delicate ringlets at the base of his neck, he was different. He was gentle, soft, made of plush, and Steve maybe found Bruce Banner a little too cute when he painted his Sophomore friend with his eyes. Bruce, though, was not entirely stuffing. He was curiosity, desperation, envious, and childish. He was quiet yet loud, he was anxious yet angry. His stuttering lips had been what attracted Steve first, and Bruce had been through many paintings before Steve settled on what he saw. He had imagined him to be a puzzle piece, painted with exclusively primary colors, and then later he was red and green, nothing more and nothing less. Eventually Steve did settle on the moon white, cornering his frame with the same gold that matched his glasses and hair. However, with the progress that Banner had been going through, Steve wasn't sure how long this pallet would remain, and he predicted that the colors would no longer match the natural vibe that was Bruce.
It seemed only recently that the popular Junior boy was starting to take notice of him. At first, it was just tiny glances, quick looks. Nothing more. Tony looked at a lot of things anyway, because Tony liked to think-that was one thing Steve knew about him, it was that he really enjoyed thinking. For the most part, Steve wasn’t particularly sure of what exactly, but he was sure that it was something extraordinary, revolutionary, and peculiar.
Sorry it took so long to upload. I know there isn't much plot yet, but I promise it'll start picking up soon.
But the time of day, the smell of food around him, the students who hadn’t even bat an eyelash at their exchange, were not the problems.
Of course, how could Thor not know? How could you not know you were gay? It’s something that kind of just happens, right? You just feel it? You don’t taste ice cream and sit there, waiting for your taste buds to nod their head yes or shake their head no. You’re supposed to know! You’re supposed to get it instantly!
Tony took in a deep breath, wind flowing through his hair. The air tasted like pastel sunshine and his body felt like feathers, more so head a cloud, but his fingers the weight of a pair of loose, untied sneakers. Things were red and yellow and blue, a primary ordeal, and then they faded into secondary and tertiary, a world painted in a maximum color wheel, and in betweens, tints and tones and sweet, sweet shades. A color wheel in the surrounding at the dusk of time, a color wheel frozen and moving all the same above Tony’s dark, contrasting hair and olive skin. He didn’t blend very well with his surroundings, but typically Tony didn’t anyways.
But the times Tony found himself truly content was when his mother stroked his hair, kissed his cheeks, and hugged him to her chest.
It was chaste, gentle, and sweet, and when they pulled away they let out a soft breath, chuckling into each other’s mouths and resting their foreheads together.
Thor was painted with lightening. His skin was rough, etched, and always so visibly intense. He was grey and stormy, but not angry. The outline of his body was a sunny yellow, one you'd see midday, and the tips of his body glowed a soft blue that Steve enjoyed highlighting his eyes with. Inside this blue were waves upon waves of the ocean crashing into the earth, dancing roughly inside his skin. Racing around Thor's frame, from his throat to his hips to his arms to his wrists and legs and feet, was sharp lightening. The intensity of a thousand Gods and Suns were no match to Thor's personality, and though Thor was always bubbly and vibrant, his natural way with the world was gentle, stormy nights at sea. Instead of bath bubbles, he created sea foam that kissed the sand.
Tony chuckled at that. “That's what I thought of you, and yet…” He gestured at him and then huffed in fake exasperation.
And finally, once the Sun left-good riddance-the Moon was visible. The seventh subject. He was a little different. Sometimes he looked like he was there and sometimes he looked like he wasn’t. Granted, the moon only revealed himself when the Sun left-even then, sometimes he wasn’t-and he’d sit patiently with the Sky, waiting to see if he could possibly brighten her day. He couldn’t. He outshone most of the stars behind him and sure, the Moon was great to have around, but he wasn’t enough. He wasn’t enough for the Sky, and surely wasn’t enough for the Earth.
“I’m sorry…” He wasn’t quite sure what he was apologizing for, though. Perhaps it was for making Steve blow up, or maybe for haunting Steve’s life, a life that was supposed to be happy.
Tony knew they only spent time together because Maria liked to convince herself Howard was still in love with her. Tony wished he could assure her that he did, and that Howard was just a busy guy, but what could Tony really say when he knew how it felt to be unloved by Howard Stark?
“You’re right. Okay, well Asgard, is just a place. Our people differ from, what we just call mortals, we’re spread out and even though we call ourselves Asgardians, we are just representing our home. Like New Yorkers, Californians.”
The brunette saunter towards them, a lazy smile upon his face. “You guys can relax. We have a thing against murder,” signaling that they were heard. “I’m James Barnes, but call me Bucky, yea,” he pointed a thumb to the red-head “That’s Natasha. Warning though, she is dangerous. Not too against murder," Natasha grinned. The guys faces blanched and Bucky chuckled, “Kidding. Seriously relax, I promise nothing involving gravesites will happen at all.”
Before he could say anything. A roar broke out. A bunch of kids ran out the tall grass screeching and laughing. Steve pulled Tony in, as the children ran past them, nearly missing them. His arms wrapped tightly around Tony’s waist.
Natasha spoke, “Mm, it’s hard to say. But we live a few centuries.” Buck lands his hand on his friends’ shoulders, “And that is why you guys will have a few lessons today. To understand us.”
They let go, “I will check myself one more time.” Tony patted his friend's shoulder. Rhodey rolled his eyes, “I’ll be with Clint.”
“Everything they need to know who they are and what we are. And later, way later, the birds and the bees, some parents just can’t do it.” He laughed.
He tilted his head, thinking, and to Tony it looked like he decided. “Well, how open-minded are you?”
“Tony,” Clint groused, he turned and was now tumbling off the chandelier. Thankfully Bucky had good reflexes and was crazy strong, he caught Clint.
They’ve bounced on the bed and Tony laughed against Steve’s mouth. He liked Steve eagerness. He pushed against Steve to let up. Steve pulled away, a little. His blue eyes held a bit worry. Tony just smiled, easing Steve tension. “I like where this is going,” he whispered against his lips, “But I have to say, I have not—well this is new territory for me.”
“So, that makes you half?” she nodded again. “So, you are a shifter.” She puffed at Tony. Tony chuckled, “So tell me why are you grumpy, like Steve?” Another giggle earned.
She stuck out her tongue as she took them, “Such a party pooper, daddy.” He leaned down giving a loud smack of a kiss on her cheek.
The two brothers had a silent argument—Wade with a skeptical look towards his little brother—but it looked like Jared won the argument as wade turned “Whatever! Like Jared said, it was just a joke, just wipe their memories” he scoffed.
“Father!” he greeted, letting go and moving to embrace the old man, “Mother said I would find you around town. We have much to talk about…” Thor looked to Tony, “and much more it would seem.”
Tony genuinely smiled, “Nice to meet you. Please call me Tony.” He turned slightly to look at Odin “You have an interesting family.”
Bruce laughed. “Sorry. I’m very old.” He admitted. “I’ll say older than Steve here,” he motioned. “I am dead to you out there. I had to fake my death. Or it would get awkward the whole not getting old thing.”
Thor sighed, “Which one?” he crosses his arms. Thor had a glint to his eyes. It wasn’t anger; it was fondness. The one his dad held whenever Tony became mischievous as a kid. Tony felt a pang in his chest. Remembering his father. He swallowed more water. He felt Steve's thumb rubbing his side, soothing him.
for you guys…” Steve smirked. “Stick with me pal and you’re not even going to know the definition of that word.” Tony sighed and Steve pull him in tighter.
“Actually, that happened years ago.” His eyes roamed Bruce and poked the man, then turned to an amused Steve, a brow raised.
“Guys really?!” The same young man from earlier had clothes clutched in his hands. He looked exhausted. “I definitely should have asked for more money,” he grumbled.
“I guess one of us should be prepared,” he teased, as he shifted, and Steve’s cock brushed against his. Tony opened the bottle and poured some on them and his hand. Grasping them both together, Steve eyes turned predatory. And Tony felt those little aftershocks again. This only happened around Steve, it’s weird but he loved it.
Once they’ve touch, something felt a bit off for Tony. Couldn’t be sure what it was but Wade eyes seemed to
Sam chuckled, “No, he definitely male. Loki was Thor mate. It happens sometimes that your true mate may not be your kind. And they usually decide at that point. Loki wanted to be with Thor in the end and he went through a conversion. You’re not sure what you get in the end of a mortal going through conversion. It’s a hard process for them and some may refuse it, or their mates can’t let them go through it. Thor was okay with them never having children, he luck out,” Sam smiled.
He glances over to Bucky, as he stares at the two but mostly at the man. Tony would think his eyes held, longing.
Big thank you to Fra98ffri ( for a moment I thought I lost them) for being patient and betaing this. I know I need the help. And so appreciated!
Odin gave a thought and widely smiled. “You have the run of the town,” everyone, excluding the trio, stared at Odin in surprise. “Have fun, until we could trust that our secrets will stay as such, you may go home.”
“So why are we not wiping away?” Clint spoke up again. He wasn’t so freaked out anymore. More intrigued at this point.
He turned his attention back to the picture. One was a family picture of a woman with curls, a wide smile on her face, the man beside her had his arm around her waist mirroring the same happiness. His hand was on top of small little boy shoulder. He knew instantly that was Steve. Steve and his parents. The picture was black and white, worn. He looked to the next picture of two boys, older and Tony knew it was Steve with Bucky. The next picture was a shock. Steve was in military clothes. World War Two clothing, he knew without a doubt. Even though it was faded and was not in color, Steve’s blues shone to him. And he had no beard.
Tony didn’t fidget, but something about the look Sam gave him, it was wicked and teasing. He knew something. Well obviously, he was a teacher.
Rhodes cleared the counter, “Well Steve, that’s fine. But you’ll catch more flies with honey than vinegar.”
Steve was becoming something complex for him. Snobs mainly surrounded Tony. High society, overly aggressive reporters. Tony was raised—and was good at it—to handle all of that with all the suaveness that a Stark man would have. His dad would be proud.
Tony could understand. Bruce still looked the same to him from middle school. Damn, who would have thought. “Is that what you guys do?”
“Looks to me that everyone is making good progress with Tony. Beside you.” Bucky patted his back empathically.
“Steven!” Thor was the first to move and embrace, unlike James, Steve did not mind Thor being in his personal space or his affections. He dropped his duffel bag to the ground as Thor bear hug him, he patted his back as he laughed.
Thor closed the shop down. Loki retire home early, complaining of a headache, the cause of the Asgardian’s busybodies.
He turned his attention to Steve. Since it was him who did the job, “Thanks,” looking at blue eyes was a mistake. He felt a shiver run up his spine, his eyes looked predatory, or were they? And Damn! What is exactly up with this whole situation? He wasn’t even touching him. The air was thick. And Clint coughed obnoxiously. Thank god for Clint! Breaking their eye contact.
“No, it’s not,” Natasha confirmed. “And what we do with you all…” she trailed, as her eyes lingered on Tony.
, he instantly knew it was Aunt Peggy. His heart felt full, warm. He needed to hear—in this case read—from her.
“If we see shovels, let’s make a go.” Clint spoke softly, as all three were huddled. Tony made a face and Rhodey was still recovering from everything. “And I promise if you two don’t make it, I’ll name another kid after you both.”
She wagged a finger at him, “Nuh-uh. I heard of you and believe me you have your hands full.” As in cue, Steve growls, mostly towards Tony, his displeasure. Tony rolled his eyes and waved Steve off, “Don’t mind him. That’s all he does, anyway. He could be hungry,” he shrugged.
“Maybe it’s time to go,” Steve's gruff voice. He was kind to make it seem like he was giving Tony a choice. Tony blew out an air. “I feel you should have locked me up instead” Steve’s eyes turned on him and now Tony was caught in a stare down. Which got his heckle up. It was one thing to growl at him—but he would not get intimidated which he gave out his own impressive growl. Caught everyone off guard.
Odin huffed out a laugh. “Anthony will be staying in Asgard for a time. He is staying at the old house, past the Wilson farm” Tony missed the look both men shared. “And since you and Thor live nearby… you be helpful in helping Anthony around.”
“Loki and his sons,” he bit his lip, he didn’t want to pry, but he was curious. And Sam was a teacher, he the perfect person to ask.
Tony glanced at the front door he left open, “Okay, everyone try to run for the door” he whispered. “All right go now!” he shouted. No one made it.
"So, more on the scrawny kid deal?” ‘cause you just can’t reveal something like that, he needed all the details.
He stood by his front door, looking at the side table. His fingers skimmed the flowers he got for Tony. A mixture of red Calla Lilies, yellow Daffodils and lavender.
He reached sunlight and what looked to be a farm. He pulled to the side, there was a house and he saw an older couple about.
Tony cleared his throat, “S-so, um—what are you?” he said as Steve pulled into the road, towards town.
“Now, the roots of this tree are deep. Reaching others. Asgard is not the only place,” her eyes looked to her guests. “Once you are older, you will get to see these other places. Or you may have already since not all of us were born in Asgard.”
He stepped out, thankfully this wasn’t a Children of the Corn scene, since he saw no corn stacks or ginger kid. You wouldn’t even consider it a farm. It was more like a botanist wet dream. It was an intricate garden, flowers, oak trees and herbs all around, but a nice path to get through it. He felt like Dorothy, follow the yellow brick road Tony. Minus Toto.
They were bare. Nothing to hide their bodies from one another. The moon was full, bright and lit the room. Tony looked at him curiously. He was right; he was all muscles and every woman's fantasy. At least those that were straight.
He heard laughter from none other than Wade. Once noticing the blond, he felt a pull, a little gentle this time, from Steve. Guess he noticed too, as he watched Steve’s jaw clench, most likely grinding his teeth.
It was nosy, and he was not irritated by it. He welcomes it. Better than the quietness he was subjected too.
He knew they were friends. He really did, but it was making Steve uncomfortable. “Relax Steve.” Bucky placed a firm hand to his shoulder. He was growling again. Bucky face held unbridled laughter, not wanting to piss off Steve anymore.
"And!" He pointed a finger upward, "Just in case, Clint will feel the same way. We knew what we were signing up for in becoming friends to Tony Stark."
Tony quirk his lip, “Temporary” making some notes in finding out who has been keeping the place in shape and paying the electricity bill.
Bucky just entered, gave a once over look and let out a whistle. His eyes fell to Tony and Steve, and to—Tony looked down, their clasped hand. He shook, he would conclude was Steve, hand off.
“Hmm… yes big time. Sam going to give you both a ride home. And your father will dish out the punishment,” they both gave a frantic look. Thor wasn’t too hard with punishment, he was more lenient than Loki, but when he punished the kids it was with some hard labor. Usually involved manure.
Steve turned to face Tony. He was dressed casually. His hair was neatly brushed down. A different image then earlier. Though if he was to be honest, he liked bed rumpled Tony better.
“There was quite some commotion, we first thought Loki was the cause again, but seems other sources say otherwise” James provided.
“Hey Tony,” Clint calls out. Holding a beer out to him. “Care to join us,” Tony stopped the scan, sending the details, notes to Pepper and moves down, grabbed the beer offer to him.
He squeezed her hand. He didn’t have family left, not blood, he only has Pepper and Rhodey—few people he could call friend. All these last few weeks he was surrounded by boxes. Filled to the brim of memories. Sad, happy moments. What was he going to find at this place?
The conversion thing is influenced by Christine Feehan, Carpathian/Dark series. I have read the series and drop off when Zacarias got his HEA.
Tony thought, letting another laugh out. “I had never played by anyone’s rules. I’m terrible at it. So, will I be respected tomorrow?”
Tony scoffed, as his eyes rolled. But he thought for a moment he’d like to see Steve without the beard.
“The name is Antony Stark. But call me Tony” he reached a hand out, “Odin” he took Tony hand in a shake.
“Becca,” Bucky was by her as he pulled some petal out her hair. She giggles, “Uncle Bucky!” She took him in her arms.
Tony cleared his throat, “Well, there’s one thing I like to know.” He looked to where everyone was. His friends vanished with Natasha earlier. Steve and Bucky were busy with more kids besides the pups.
“Some time ago. But they’ve sold it. A woman bought it. She stayed for a time, I’m assuming you are the new owner?”
Okay, he was totally reconsidering the décor of this place. He usually had people, like Pepper, deal with things like this. But he highly doubts he’ll be selling this place and god knows he needs this place to look appealing to him.
Rhodey sighed and let out a short laugh, “Why couldn’t you guys do normal stuff. Like wine and painting classes.” Clint stuck his tongue out at Rhodey.
Reaching the door, key out of pocket, Tony unlock and entered. Well not much to say as he switches the lights on. The place looked very rustic inside too. Nothing modern about it or any moves to make some
“What? It said the temperature will drop a bit.” He defended. “Unless you want Steve to put on those classic moves.” Clint teased.
Frigga let out a velvet laugh out, “Maybe.” Her eyes twinkled. She rose, “Now sweethearts let’s go exploring,” she took one little hand as the other kids started to trail behind her.
Steve gave him a look as he tosses his clothes in the car. “Something like that. See you in the morning.” As Steve moved in the forest, shifting. And all Bucky heard was howling.
“If Peggy was still around she would kill you. She doesn’t like stranger rummaging through her stuff. Did you forget the incident with the orderly?”
“Okay boys break it up” Natasha spread her arms wide, “My turn” she said haughty. They both laughed and hug. “Am I glad you are back.”
Bruce blinked; his face broke into another smile. “I’m going to assume you were going to visit my labs.” Tony huffed at him. Steve found it cute.
Steve’s hand held Tony head to him, his other hand gripped his waist. He let out a groan as Tony, who smiled against his lips, grasped him in his hand.
As soon as Steve parked, he was out of that truck and moved quickly to Loki’s shop. Steve on his heel. That guy was no a slouch.
Its trunk was thick and a bit curve. Branches held out its green foliage. Man, raking must be a hated task around here.
That startled Rhodey as he watched Clint find what he was looking for and fill it with water. “How the hell did you know that?”
He groaned as he rose from the bed. He moved a hand to rub the sleep from his face and brush fingers into his hair as he got up and followed his nose to the kitchen.
“Correct Jazmin!” She clasped her hands. “Our ancestor’s turn to the creature that we all have inside us, shapeshifters and the others had chosen a different life, mortals.” At that all the little ones looked to Tony and his friends. Clint gave them a two-finger salute, “Yo.”
Bruce duck his head, a low laugh and looked up, “The kids—just teaching them a few things.” Humor bright in his eyes. He would not mention that he was out in bear form, basking in the sun as the kids came poking at his side and he just couldn’t resist being a prick. But, the kids knew Bruce, and they did it just to have fun.
The little girl from before, Jazmin, was sitting down away from the others. Watching the two cubs playing. She was pouting.
“Yea, if Tony was a shifter. He would not understand the whole dead rabbit thing.” Bucky was right. Though his instinct is making him want to go get some rabbits for Tony. It meant he could provide for his mate. Well, he could always get a deer. That would be better. He felt the pat on his shoulder, “Stop and just give the flowers. You can’t be late, so do not stop for anything.” Bucky smiled, “Nat, will be piss if you bloody your clothes.”
Steve and Thor moved instantly to the front.  It was an intimidating sight. But it did not make Rhodes fall back. Maybe it was because they were tired or the impending imprisonment in a town, they have no clue about, only that a Lion—named Wade—is the beginning of crazy.
This caught Steve off guard. He never had a problem with wiping a person's memory. Though the biggest problem wasn’t just that. Steve stared at his hand, still feeling the current in him, fading little-by-little. It woke every nerve ending in him. Stirring up the creature inside him. Looking back to the house, he huffed and turned away.
Tony moved off him. Almost tripping, another arm curled around his waist, held him—at the same time electrifying him. He looks up to see Steve was holding him. He frowned and took another gulp of his water, one thing at a time.
Steve thumb moved, stroking the back of Tony hand. “So, you’d know that it not an easy process.” He watched as Tony nodded. “It takes a lot from the person. Everything changes, body wise. The way she was…” he swallowed, a faraway look, as he remembered his mother in bed. She was frail, her eyes lost that vibrancy. His dad took care of all her needs. Steve would help, urging his father to rest. Same blue eyes as him, a man who was huge, also looked fragile and most time scared and hid it as soon as his son looked his way.
He thought he would finally speak to someone that would completely understand him. Even if their career path were different, Tony just thought for once, he could – as Clint would put it – completely nerd out. So, when Tony heard about the explosion that had happened… It devastated him.
“Hey Steve, guess who we found” they watched as Natasha entered, with another boy, Jared—Tony remembered.
“Not sure how to explain this… we’re not exactly on earth?” he frowned. “No, that’s not right, we are on earth just… up?”
“As Shapeshifters, we follow our animal nature. Instinct, scent. We don’t exactly have a term for people like Loki and me,” at this point Tony had his glasses off. Giving Sam a curious look and astonishment of what he would reveal.
“I can’t shift.” She stated once again. She looked around to make sure it’s just them. “I’m seven and my brothers are five and I’m the only one that can’t.” She looked like she would burst into tears.
Steve shut the door and motioned to his couch, “Take a seat or whatever.” He shrugged his jacket off and Tony did the same handing his jacket to him.
Skidding to a halt, he turned his attention back to the creature who just roared. It was pretty pissed and somehow, he knew it was aimed at the blond at the door. Speaking of, he moved out the doorway, moving beside Tony at the snarling animal. “Hey, Wade calm down” he spoke in a heavily soothing voice. It was almost hypnotic.
Bucky was startled. His mouth was gaped open as he stared at Tony. Talk about awkward. Tony gave a small wave.
Rhodes winked, “Yes and to the barista at Starbuck too.” Rhodes turned back to the stove, “Making eggs, toast should be done about now.” He pointed to the toaster by Tony.
Tony let out a short laugh, “That’s one way of putting it. You guys must be used to the weird weather,” Tony supplied as the elder man chuckled, with a knowing look.
A week after painting Tony Stark, Steve Rogers found himself outside in the rain, sitting below an aghast sky with graphite on tan paper, attempting to sketch a hummingbird eating a worm. The air was heavy and tasted like dirt and rusting metal as it gently crashed into the tin overhead that kept Steve safe from the perspiration that gravity pulled towards the Earth.
The Sea gently kissed the Sand over and over again as Tony pulled up to the place where the Sand cheated on the Sea, where the Cement met the light grains of dirt. There he climbed out and walked through the pinking Sand, which may have colored from the embarrassment of being in between the Sea and the cement, but mostly just reflected the dusk skylight. It would be wrong for Tony to assume there was anything romantic going on between the three, but he did like a good love story, especially a love triangle. Those were always exciting.
Clint was purple, a deep silky liquid, and his skin glowed much like Natasha's moon-like hue. Though Steve would admit that Clint was constantly changing his tints and tones and shades and highlights, he remained monochromatic. Not once did he appear to be anything but purple, and that didn't have to mean he couldn't be something more. His eyes and his hair and his lips and his scars and the deepest parts of his skin held galaxies of every form of purple. Clint was unique, because no one else could do this, at least not anybody that Steve had painted. To remain so simple yet so abstract and largely varied inside the box that was Barton, Steve found impressive and endearing to say the least.
Thor was strong. Jane liked that most about her boyfriend. Not only was he gorgeous, beautiful, and sometimes a little too crazy, she felt safe. Anyone who talked to Thor felt safe. That was a normal feeling, to feel completely safe, grounded, even if you weren’t physically wrapped in his arms. Thor had this thing, Jane supposed, where if you clung on long enough his warmth could probably melt both of you like hot wax, and you’d become one.
But surely that couldn’t be possible. Surely there wasn’t a thing wrong with the calculation in his dick when God had decided to program him, wasn’t a thing wrong with his organic chemistry. Thor Odinson, broad shoulders that were made for women to cling to, massive hands that were made to tug at long hair, his hard muscles, chiseled jaw, harsh cheekbones and a golden set of hair that were made to get thick with sweat when touching a girl, was supposed to fuck women. He was the perfect male, designed without a flaw. His Kindness Teeth were perfected to bite into tender, soft skin as opposed to rough, tough skin that a boy would have. Thor Odinson couldn’t possibly be anything other than the epitome of heterosexuality.
And yet, here he was; his stomach was dropping, bile rolling up his throat, his feet turning inside out, his Kindness Teeth rotting inside his mouth. His skin danced, but not with the excitement a fully grown man with pulsing testosterone would get when asked to fuck their girl in the ladies restroom. It was more of a really sad, tripping-over-your-feet-embarrassing slow-dance, and you were doing it with your grandmother and she kept gripping you too hard and thinking you were her husband from the 40’s that died 30 years ago.
Thor was likeable, popular, silly, and like Stark, was the sun pulling the planets into his gravity. He was so warm that people evaporated, and he soaked them up with every story that he told.
Tony tightened his jaw briefly before sighing, leaning against the doorway as she moved to the fridge, standing in front of it.
Finally reaching his friend's door, he gently knocked, before pushing in and swallowing as he watched Steve's sleeping form rise and fall under the blankets.
"Young Stark, we've arrived at the Rogers' residence." He smiled up at him, though his eyes softened at Tony's expression. He turned in his seat, tilting his head at the boy.
He didn’t breathe a word of it to his friends-they didn’t know his parents were dead or about his three other names. They didn’t know Steve liked to paint and deep down he wanted to live but life was a punishment and Steve knew that painting wouldn’t pay the bills, and if he joined the military there wouldn’t really be bills to pay.
Well, Tony didn't mind, nor did he care about the opinions of others, thank you very much (or at least, that's what he repeated to himself all the way to Steve's house when Maria had told him as such)! No, no, no, Tony did not care! He didn't need to go on a playdate before a sleepover! He and Steve had played plenty of times at recess during school, so why should it matter whether he went to stay the night for a weekend!?
That’s the kind of guy the Sun was. He’d give, make you think you needed him, and then he’d leave. He’d tally up all the people he made fall in love with him, the Sea, the Sand, the fucking Sky, he’d tally them up and he’d make them his bitch.
Lost was both a short name and very much a current alias, though Steve preferred not to think about that one.
“Good one.” He complimented and Maria rolled her eyes, getting up and pushing the front wrinkles of her pencil skirt down, taming them to fall immaculately across her long legs as she stepped from the bench. “You could’ve learned piano too, y’know.” She said sweetly, walking over and leaning down to kiss her son’s forehead.
Steve assumed it had something to do with being an Extraordinary, Revolutionary and Peculiarity in human form, head to toe.
“Oh c’mon, don’t tease the poor guy. Everyone looks at Steve.” Natasha smiled and Bucky nudged Sam. “Awe, but we all know Tony. He’s got his eye on youuuu-”
Finally, at the sound of the house clock chiming 12 AM, Tony got up from the bed Mrs. Sarah had so kindly made for him, and shuffled down the dark hallway separating his and Steve's room.
Anyways, I'm dropping lots of hints on who is what in the prologue. Have you made any connections or guesses as to which character is which element? Drop a comment >;3
Maria sighed softly and brushed a stray hair from her bun, smiling at Howard and walking over to kiss his cheek. “Hi sweetie.” She smiled. Howard smiled gently down at her, but flickered his gaze to his son, smile quickly disappearing.
Maria looked up from the fridge and saw his smile. She blushed a bit in return, and then reached in, grabbing an apple. “Leave me alone.” She fussed, holding the apple in front of her. She stared at it and then put it back in the fridge. Maria stepped away, grabbing her tea again, and Tony’s grinned widened more as she brushed by him, attitude flaming from her skin.
"Steve seems like a real kind young man from how much you have talked about him. I'm sure one small mistake you make tonight will not ruin anything between you, and that is to say, you
Steve knew Tony's eyes were brown, and from this distance he improvised. He painted Tony's eyes with golds, and honestly Steve almost melted at that. Gold was just Steve's favorite thing, and he made sure to go back and highlight Tony's skin with gold too, though it wouldn't be too noticeable against the yellow glow. Only if you really cared to look would you see the detail. He added purple deep around his irises and painted dark brown as the flat color. Surrounding Tony's eyes was a deep green, just to top off that earthly vibe he seemed to be exuding today.
Thor sighed, few things faded the big guy, but the boys always seemed to wear him down most time. It was amusing for the three, they’ve all pretty much grew up with each other. “My friends let us go and make sure Anthony is well. I will explain everything on the way.”
They reached a garden. Eden—if you believe in stuff like that. The kids were at this point running through, playing and some it seems shifted or Frigga had woodland friends.
Dr. Banner holed himself at. He was finally going to meet one of his idols. Since middle school Tony had followed this man works. Bruce was one of many that inspired him.
Tony never had siblings. But he guesses maybe Jared and Wade had the same relationship as him and Rhodey. As he watched them kid around. Wade felt Tony eyes, his golden-brown eyes slit—which Tony now knows was real.
His face buried in Steve chest and Steve had him all wrapped in his covers and arms. It was a task to unwrap himself.
Pepper moved towards him and gave him a tight hug. Hand soothing his back. It just like her to read him. Aunt Peggy was good at that too.
They’ve made their introduction earlier, when Clint let them in. Well, they came through the then broken side door.
Aunt Peggy had good days and bad ones, and the orderly was in a choked hold by an elderly lady on her bad day. The staff were shocked. Tony was amazed that she knew such a move and was even able to execute it. Left him with more questions.
“Thank you,” Sam lips quirked. “Anything you need to know, I’m here to provide the answer.” At that a falcon landed on his shoulder. “She such a big kid.” Tony didn’t have to ask; he knew it was Rebecca.
“You guys been tricked.” Natasha stated. “But, who exactly down one bottle and the other half?” she sounded impressed.
Curious green eyes, a slow smile holding back a laugh. He was a few inches taller than Tony, with black shoulder length hair.
Tony inhaled the aroma, took a gulp. Having the warmth spill into him. He gave his friend a grateful smile, “Have I told you how much I love you.”
Moving closer, Frigga came to the base of the tree. Tony took notice how the roots spread out long and deep in the ground.
He didn’t remember much that day. Only the steak was amazing—he should marry Rhodey, really. But everything was a blur.
“You said usually, that does not sound good. That sound like six feet under is the next step” Rhodey responded.
Rhodes was cut off as they heard a growl coming from behind Clint. Clint dropped his sandwich as something edge, growling, closer to him. “Holy shit,” he moved and slid to the other side of the counter. Tony grabbed Clint back shirt as he pulled the man closer to them.
Rhodey smiled awkwardly, he wasn’t particularly good with kids, his max was Clint kids. They were odd little Barton’s.
—and the two deputies watching them, holding hands. Tony flushed. They weren’t the only eyes watching them.
“I will never trust another Odinson’s again.” Rhodey declared, “Well, except Thor but that is it.” he huffed.
And here he was. On house arrest or should he call this unlawful imprisonment of an unknown mystical town. With an unknown, handsome blond with amazing blue eyes. One that once they touch gives him little aftershocks and he can’t help but let him invade his space.
Steve’s eyes lit with humor and he turned to Tony. “Is it okay?” Tony blinked up at him, was Steve asking his permission?
When Tony and Odin returned to town. He did notice a lot people coming out and watching him. Just him. He should be used to being stared at. He was a public figure, the PR that Pepper always got him doing got him used to it. I guess the difference from that type of audience to the one here is curiosity?
“If you like,” Bruce looked to Steve, for permission, and Steve gave a nod. “I have a lab here,” Tony jumped at the offer. “Let’s go Bruce!” They both walked, Bruce leading the way. Steve trailed behind them.
Tony sighed, “I can’t get rid of him” he grumbled to Loki, which earned a growl from Steve. “See, that’s all I get from him” this time Loki could not hold his laughter.
. And it left Steve with a knot at the pit of his stomach. That’s not something you want your mate to feel towards you—
It sets his teeth on edge. “Anything y-you want to do?” Tony blinked, chewing on his bottom lips “To town.”
Steve tilted Tony head up, “Damn right you’ll be respected.” Before Tony could answer, Steve lips engulfed him. He moaned into it. His legs wrapped around Steve’s waist and he was heft up. Arms wrapped tightly around Steve broad shoulders, as Steve decided to move this to the bedroom.
Tony’s secure in his sexuality. He only dated women, not because he had too, it was what he’s attracted to. And Steve was becoming something – he dared think – attracted to.
Yea, without the old man help, Tony wouldn’t know where to go. He would not had found this house and thank god he was paying attention on how to get around.
Tony turned and looked down. Floating? Oh, this was so great his little brain was flashing with so much information and possibilities and, “Wow!” he faced Steve again. “The fog?”
“See, I was small and scrawny as a kid. And was sick. My dad decided that I should go through the change.” Tony found it hard to picture Steve as anything scrawny or sick. He’s big, broad, all muscle. Muscles that made Tony fingers twitched to touch. He cleared his mind of where that was going.
Once they’ve finished, cleaned up and hop in the car with Thor. The others following soon, and Steve glue to his side. Tony remembered that they needed to talk. But he will hold out on that chat for way, way later.
That name was familiar. The lion swiped his huge paw at them. The blond took hold of Tony, taking him closer to his side. Tony felt hot and stared at two, surprised, blue eyes.
He thought about getting out-of-town. But he couldn’t leave his friends and he also doubts he’ll get too far if he even tried. But he could try?
“Well, one, am I in Asgard?” he noted the other man surprise but his faced clear with a smile back in place. He nodded.
“Yes, biologically—mine and Thor’s. He would have called me mama if we haven’t taught him not to do it around—
Steve talked about how he enlisted with Bucky right behind him. He said he wanted to do something. He wasn’t sure how to explain it to Tony. But he wanted to protect those that were weak, and he also chucked it up that his people, the Shapeshifters, were also warriors.
He looked down, nothing could be seen, except the water falling—To where? Tony did not know, but holy shit.
Thor sighed and moved to cuff Wade ear. “Ow ow ow…” Wade, struggling a little when he was led out the house, his brother close behind.
Steve must have sensed his distress as his eyes narrowed to find the threat. And calmed as he saw his best friend. “Hey Bucky,” he let go and stood in front of Tony.
After some more awkward moments from the shop to the market. Tony never felt more self-conscious and Loki irritability hit its limit as he told the people in the market place off.
“Okay, basic first. Name?” Steve tilt his head confused “You know my name,” Tony huffed “Just your first name. You know more about me, company included," that was true “Steve Rogers.”
“You know, I don’t get why you guys are so amiable in us learning about Asgard.” Clint slouched over the front seat, looking at Thor.
“Bruce, having fun?” a slow smile spread on his face. Tony separated from Steve. Though Steve’s shirt has the indentation of his death grip.
“I think today was enough,” he stated.  “I—you are so an ass!” Tony hand slap the dashboard, which got Steve attention. “I was not doing anything wrong, you know.”
Tony’s hand reached out to flatten one he missed. The tension they had in the beginning was gone and became something else. Something Tony was not sure on, but looking at Steve, he looked happy.
Once he made it to the hall, it was cold. He could have sworn Steve had the fireplace lit. When he made it to the living room, it was and looked to the front door being open and Bucky standing in the doorway.
“No, we just—” Jared spoke, but mull over his next choice words, “Not used to city folks” Wade finished for him, reaching a hand for a shake.
In some ways Tony was blessed to have friends like these. Clint was an easy-going guy, looks serious but not at all. And when he considered you a friend, not to mention his wife and the kids loves him, he felt like a family member and so it had gifted Tony with another overprotective friend.
“It’s a date.” Tony turned at that and made his way to Bruce. Bruce who had a sly smile on his face. He heard everything all right.
Steve shrugged. “That was a step to the right direction. It’s less overwhelming when you have to face kids than the others.”
Steve doubted she had so much to do. She was good at conning the others in the heavy lifting. But he felt guilty. It was unlike him to disregard his duties. But he could not get out the funk from Tony rejection.
“I can’t,” she moved to Tony. She cups a hand to her lips, whispering to them her big secret, “I’m not a shifter.” That shocked Tony.
went south. It became a quiet ride into town. Now in a close in space, Steve could take Tony scent in. He smelled like coffee and
They pulled up to a two-story rustic house, made of stone and wood. Tony let out a low whistle. “Nice looking place,” he remarked.
Loki chuckled, “Nonsense, my father seems to deem that you need help. And once he has that stuck in his head…well let’s humor him” Tony laughed. He could sense that Loki going to be fun.
Tony cut in before Steve, “Does that mean you’re half?” He took off his sunglasses, placing them on his collar, giving Jazmin a curious look. Her mood changed with Tony instantly, “Yes! Mommy and daddy met out there,” she pointed out. Probably didn’t know the specifics of her parents meeting.
Tony was a bit weird, more than usual. One being he liked smells. And not just any scent. Just those that he loved most and—Steve scent.
“Besides, you’re a grown ass man, you can do whatever you like. As long as you are happy and comfortable.” Clint added. Then turned to go outside, “Anyway, I’m going to wait for Steve. I need the practice.”
“Not yet…” Tony sighed. “Well then, Anthony if you are staying for some time in Asgard. Let me show you around.”
Steve must have had the same idea. He ducked his head down; he felt the slight inhale he took. Then blue and brown met and—Tony cleared his throat and turned his head to the direction the kids ran from, “Wh—what was that?” his voice wavered.
“Of course not, Thor, the old man does whatever he likes. And at the end there be a lesson, vague and confusing, lesson at most learned” Bucky added with humor.
It dawned on Steve that he really didn’t know much about these two. He might have to look them up. Natasha probably already did the background check. He heard a throat clear and his mind blank as he stared at Tony.
“Y—yea,” Steve croaked out, flinching at his tone. Nice Steve, just nice. He handed the flowers to Tony, who took them and lightly touched the calla lily. “I was not sure…” his hand splayed. Maybe he should have gotten rabbits.
She left just about everything to him. A few other things went to charity. Anthony Edward Stark was a genius, billionaire, and philanthropist. He didn’t need anything. Except her. Them.
Yes, Tony has read one or two while between science books. Might be over two. Okay, fine, it was a fantasy romance genre series, and he had to know what happened between Tracy and her hunky vampire boyfriend Gerard.
“It hurt like hell.” He looked up at Tony, a smile on his face. “And now you’re huge,” they both laughed. Steve couldn’t hold back, as he brought Tony's palm to his lips.
“Yea, you are, kid. Who said that?” Steve placed his hand over her head. Jazmin frowned, this kid was too cute to be frowning, Tony thought. “Everyone.” She crossed her arms.
Steve cleared his throat, his heart pounding. Bruce was away from them, waiting. Bruce had great hearing, so he knew he could hear it all, he bet he’d tell Natasha all about it. He swallowed the lump in his throat. Tony’s waiting for his answer, “Uh—tonight… 6?”
He grabbed his face and duck down to kiss him. Steve groaned, and he quickly stood up. Gathering Tony in his arms. Tony smiled against his lips as he heard Steve growl. At least this time it was the good kind.
“Natasha,” he moved down the steps, Natasha ready for Thor’s bear hug. He let’s go and brace the other arm, “James. How may I help you all?”
It was a chill morning, winter was moving out and spring would soon come in. Steve moved toward his truck and got in. Tony settle next to him.
Tony turned around and handed the flowers to Clint, “Mind putting them in water, buddy.” Clint took them, waved them off, as they both moved and entered the car.
While the other's moves ahead. Tony turns to Steve, “You and I definitely need to talk.” Steve nods.
“Something like that. Steve and the rest will keep an eye on you three” Odin waved his hand to the others, showing who their babysitters going to be.
Tony blinked, he felt the shock wave down his spine and Steve drag him down the block. Confused—was he the only one feeling this? He heard a clear, loud whistle and turned to see his friends, Clint being the one who whistle—
As Wade disappeared to the back. Steve shoulders relaxed. “So mature Steve” Loki was holding back a laugh.
Rhodey let go of Tony moving to stand in front “Hold up! This is not legal, ya know. What makes you think we’ll stick around?”
“Guys, please.” Tony shook his head at them. And moved down to meet Steve. He looked at the flowers Steve clutched, “For me?” his smile held amusement.
Rhodey crossed an arm to his chest, his other hand gripped his chin in thought “Seriously, do you like him… now?” he asked.
Steve plops on his couch. Hands covering his face, head leaned back. He moves his hands, combing into his hair. “Shit.”
Tony licks his lips, held his moan—he could taste him, and he wanted more. “Take me home,” his voice hoarse.
Loki cleared his throat, gaining the other two attention. “We have a guest in Asgard. Boys meet Anthony Stark. Anthony this- “he pointed to the dark blond, “is Wade, beside him is Jared and this big oaf is Thor” pointing last to the smiling giant.
Years! Long years waiting for this. Always told what to expect. But not sure, now, what to do? It’s easier when it was one of his own—they would understand. An outsider… it was hard. He watched Thor’s own struggles when it came to Loki. His friend was a mess. Thor was never known for patience. He gave Loki years. In the end, with a little intervention, it paid off—he had a family, two sons.
“Is that right Anthony?” they turned to the watch Odin step inside. Followed by some familiar faces. Loki beside the old man.
It was at that; he felt an arm around his waist. And Steve was rubbing his eyes, “Tony,” he muttered as he leaned and kissed his temple. It melted his heart but looked down and saw that Steve was, well, still naked and turned to Bucky whose face was scrunched up.
There was a loud roar, they both turned to the lion, he felt the other tense as they watched the creature leap on the couch, hearing a clear crunch, and waited for the blow.
Tony was busying watching Steve cuddling up to the little ones that stayed. Not interested in the chase. They just enjoyed cuddling Steve. Tony couldn’t help but smile. It was cute.
Tony stood by the railing of the second floor, as he overlooks the living space. Looking at a manmade chandelier—he was being nice in calling it as such. It was big, round, wooden and had—moose horns. He scrunched his nose at it.
“You’ve got that right.” Tony moved to place the lamp back, “Glad you’re helping yourself to my food and whatever gotten broken you’re paying for it”
Both men took notice of Steve. Their eyes had a gleam of something wicked. Steve stopped and nodded his head in greeting.
These were his own inventions. Helped Tony in many things. Mainly recording info and picking up things. He gave them a tap as he scans the field, walking through tall grass.
Rhodey sighed and smiled at his friend. Shaking his head, "Are you worried that I will drop you because you're dating a guy?" He let out a chuckle, "Don't think that way Tones. You're my best friend. I love you and will always be here for you."
“I look and sound like a man, but I gave birth to my daughter,” he looked to Rebecca lovingly and turned back to Tony. “You may come across one of our own that is a woman but may have their mate with child. I guess in a term we could be consider intersex. But, maybe not all would go under that term,” he shrugged. “I was born this way and had a child of my own. Loki is different.”
Thor, good nature guy he is, smiles. “You all aren’t really a threat to us.” Clint frowned, “Well that sounds ominous.” Rhodey replied.
Bucky cleared his throat, focus back on him. He pointed to the moon, “It’s a full moon,” he crossed his arms. “Well, I thought you wanted to go for a run.” He scratched the bridge of his nose, turned away, “Didn’t know your date would run so late.”
His mind was processing everything incorrectly. As for one, he should not be on friendly terms with Steve. He shouldn’t be in close contact like this. You don’t hold people's hands like this. Not those you just met. And Tony was not against male to male affections. Rhodey and him always gave people the wrong impression of their relationship. He couldn't care less, he loved his Rhodey, his honeybear.
Tony didn’t sit, he moved around Steve’s house. The living space was small, a hall that held three closed doors. One at the end and two to the side.
“Careful now, you might end up with warts” Tony turned to the smooth male voice as he shut and place liquid warts away from him.
“Oh,” he blinked, “Yea… same here. We’ll take it slow. No need to go all the way.” His hand at Tony thigh, soothing. Tony grabbed Steve collar and continued with their make-out session.
Sam chuckles, “Hey, I think you should focus on other things than my daughter. Though I definitely understand.”
Bucky came into his sight in the mirror. “Stop messing with your hair. Natasha will get angry if you mess up her work.” Leaning on the frame, arms crossed over his chest.
And Tony found himself wanting to touch Steve more. He pulled his hand away. Something else catching his eye – a distraction, good.
“I know that place,” he paused, contemplating. “Best I show you the way. This place tends to be…tricky”
But, like I said in the beginning, this AU is influenced by a lot of things I have read through the years.
“Ah—was in the neighborhood?” Loki laughed, “I’m guessing our sheriff not giving you a warm welcome” Steve huffed, not turning his eyes away.
Before he tossed the bottle away, Steve took it. Also, placing some on his fingers and moved behind Tony.
She ran off toward the tree, a pair of cubs ran behind her. A young man ran past them, with clothes in his hands. Tony pointed, looking up at Steve. Steve just looked amused by Tony reactions.
It was a sunny, gorgeous day to take a long road trip and then it turned to soup. The fog thick, Tony couldn’t see a damn thing.
At that moment a cub and a little naked boy ran past Tony, tackling their sister. Steve reached a hand out, making sure she didn’t slam too hard on the ground.
Steve got to bite those lips, Tony gasped, and he plunged his tongue in. And Steve could smell Tony’s want.
“That’s right, Jazmin, you haven’t met Tony,” Steve gentle his tone, “He’s a friend to Asgard, don’t worry.” She gave an unsure look to Steve. Her big brown eyes turned to roam over Tony, he gave his best smile “Hi,” giving a small wave. She pursed her lips and let out a small smile, “Hi.”
Tony tried his best not to grip them hard, but he gave Steve a startle look as he brushed his hole. Steve kissed the side of his neck, “Don’t worry, I promise it won’t go too far, just want to touch you.” He whispered into his skin.
Well, Tony knew Odin was a weird dude and his house does not reflect that. He thought he would see a house like the one in the show “Little house on the prairie.”
“It’ll be up to your parents or they’ll let you decide. You have to wait until your bigger.” He advised.
Tony veered off, away from the others. He was wearing his supposedly normal sunglasses. Obviously, there’s nothing normal about them.
Tony couldn’t sit. He paces the living room. Combing his hand through his hair, trying to wrap his mind about—Steve.
“Tony here’s a jacket in case it gets cold later.” Tony rose from his almost meltdown, taking the Jacket Clint hands him. They both quirked a brow at Clint.
“Once long ago this would have given me a headache.” Odin smiled, wistfully. “But since I’m now retired," he looked to Steve with amusement, “It falls to you.”
Steve exhaled, loudly, his hands to his waist. Those blue eyes laid on Tony. Something was brewing in those blues. “Fine, tomorrow we will talk.” And Steve left.
Perhaps he should had started some upgrades to the place after all. Start with maximum security for one.
The world is blinding, like a light turned on in perpetual darkness, and Tony shuts his eyes closed, turning against the source.  There is a hand on his shoulder before a breeze rushes through him and then settles there, in his chest, filling him until his skin feels uncomfortably tight.
Young Tony leans towards her warm, comfortable presence. "Dad said he was disappointed I hadn't finished testing and documenting the changes I made to the mechanical model of the plane. The engine just stopped working mid-flight, and I thought I had figured out that issue, but it came crashing down in the foyer and just broke apart, and I have to start again. I didn't want to disappoint him again Ana. Not again."
Tony walks around the car and gets in the passenger seat.  Rhodey takes driver, while Bruce and Vision split the back.  “I’m having further testing go through the Maria Stark foundation.  I think Pepper said something around the next few years needing testing before we start selling anything.”
He catches Bruce grabbing the tip of one of the dangling pens and yanking. It gives easily this time.  “Wouldn’t that mean you would be susceptible to gases, liquid or gels that could get through the suit?”
"Boss. Colonel Rhodes is asking for you. He says you have to be doing something stupid. Should I patch him in?"
“You and I both know you hate Starks.  Just call me Tony, and I won’t feel like you’re going to claw me to death to my face.  Maybe my back, but that’s the more preferable option of the two.”
He waves a hand at the destruction around him.  “I don’t know how to even break down something down any more.  I don’t know technology.”
Steve get his hand behind Tony’s balls, curling the fabric around them and rubbing softly, slowly, and then trails it down, the cotton rubbing against his nerve endings and causing Tony to see flashes of white behind his eyelids. Steve strokes his way up Tony’s cock and then, he rubs the pad of his thumb across where the tip is straining against the thin fabric, where a wet spot is already forming.
Steve doesn’t see Tony around much.  They are basing out of the Compound in New York, in order to keep off the radar of the UN and Ross, but everyone is on the move - dealing with incursions here and there and trying to fight the good fight.  Tony’s almost always gone.  Never here.  Bruce laughs when Scott asks if Tony has turned himself into a bionic man in order to be able to handle all the work.
He doesn't have time to check on Tony because Thanos is pressing his advantage, and Steve won't let him get to the body that had slumped, like all of his strings were cut, in front of him.
He catches Tony watching him in the hours that drift between too late and too early, staring at him and the book resting in his lap where he is curled. Steve makes sure to acknowledge him before going back to trying to draw Bucky when they were young, dumb and stupid and causing trouble in Brooklyn.
He hides all the evidence with the baking soda poured into the ferric chloride.  It foams as he dumps the glass of water dumped into the ferric chloride and then carefully trots to the garage where the trash bags sit, waiting to be taken to the curb later that evening.  Tony unties the knot and slips the jar, used baggie and tongs in.  He trots back into the house, towel under his arm, glass and board clutched tightly in his hands.  Jarvis watches him as he places the glass carefully in the dishwasher and towel in the box.
Or he could just ask Rhodey, who keeps talking about the support group he goes to. He takes the wheelchair. Says he needs to talk it out with someone who knows the emotions about it. Less focus on fixing the problem. Once, Rhodey could have asked Sam, but Tony tries not to think about that.
raw thank you very much.  She gets to start lecturing me about the whole incident and that’s something I thought I wouldn’t have to deal with any more but apparently I forgot our entire relationship is based on her judging my actions and counterbalancing them correctly.”
Tony groans, boneless, into the pillow. The buzzing in the back of his head has settled to a dull hum. It’ll come back to haunt him, he knows, but for now he feels settled in his skin. He feels like himself. “Yeah,” he finally replies.
I want to tell you I’m sorry to your face.  One day maybe I will be able to but until then.  I’m sorry Tony.  I should have talked to you. I should have trusted you.  I should have been your teammate.
“I say used to because I don’t know you,” Tony shrugs, eyes going to the window.  He’s carefully avoiding eye contact. “Not any more. Sometimes I think everything I knew died the moment I went under the ice.”
Tony has glassy eyes as he watches, boneless on the bed, as Steve presses down. His eyes shut so tightly as he sees stars. He bites his tongue against the pain because the quick job wasn't enough, and Steve only has a little lube on him, but there is no condom between them. It's just them, together, skin on skin and side by side like they have been for a while now.
“Colonel Rhodes of course,” Vision replies.  “He has the superior military training background that would easily allow him to win a skirmish like this.”
Something in Steve seizes at the idea. There is a denial rising in his throat, loud and urgent, but it gets stuck before he can say anything aloud. It burns, the thought of Tony looking at him the way he always looks at Pepper, soft and endlessly fond. But he knows it’s not real, it’s not something that is happening.
It lingers for a moment before shifting into a face, hair curling around the sides, and Tony startles at the face, knows it.  “FRIDAY?” he whispers.
“You and me and take out,” she smiles.  “We’re going to spend all the time catching up.  We’ll even watch those horrid Captain America films and drink to get through them.”
, you won't be proving everyone wrong." She wipes her eyes quickly before she places both hands his cheeks so he looks her straight in the eye. "You'll be proving me right."
And Tony will look at him with a familiarity like he wonders the same thing sometimes before reaching out and reeling him in for a kiss.
Daniel pulls him close and rests his chin on Tony’s hair, and it’s like he’s ten again.  Trying too hard to pretend like he isn’t clinging to Daniel, desperate for every second he can get here.  “We’re with you Tony,” Daniel promises lowly. “We’re always with you son.”
“In another timeline, the removal did kill you,” the other acknowledges, and Tony can feel his throat close up with that line.  He isn’t ready to go yet.
They eventually let him out, and Steve takes him back to his apartment.  “You housed me when I woke up in the future,” he had said ruefully. “Now it’s my turn to repay the favor.”
Tony stares at him for a long moment and Steve has to keep from fidgeting under the incredulous gaze.
Steve knows that Tony keeps his heart close, locked down and barely lets anyone in. Pepper and Rhodey have wormed their way, and he’s cautiously accepting of the rest of them. He keeps the rest of them close because they need to be able to train as a unit, to set out and take down HYDRA at a moment’s notice, but it’s nothing more than that.
“Or I could get to that other thing you were asking for earlier,” Steve replies softly before helping Tony wriggles out of the dirty underwear, using it to swipe up some of the mess. Tony feels useless, letting Steve take control, but there is an emptiness in his head that hasn’t been there in a while, pleasant without any errant thoughts rolling around.
It’s quiet enough in the place, deep in the behind the scenes area of the exhibit that the sound of other people is nearly silent, that Steve’s sincerity is disconcerting.  Too honest. Too real. Tony ducks his head for a moment, takes in a deep breath, before meeting Steve’s eyes.
Tony looks up and realizes it’s been a week, and he isn’t sure the last time he had a real meal.  His face is an unshaven mess. He hasn’t slept in a while. “Welcome home?”
Tony spends long days in the quiet house, taking apart the toaster Steve never uses.  He tries to put it back together but forgets how things go. Has to have JARVIS pull up images and instructions.
"Sure," he throws out, but knows Steve's seen the emotions on his face.  He reaches out and places his hand on Steve's bare chest.  He looks at Steve who whispers
Steve hands over his sketchbook. Tony holds it carefully for a moment before he begins to look through it. Through the pencil drawings of Tony working in the lab, laughing with Natasha, arm wrapped around the kid. Through detailed sketches of oil stained hands, poised on keyboards. The ever shifting shape of the arc reactor. Through the lines he has accumulated. The way he looks at Pepper. The way he looks at Rhodey.
“I don't know how many times I've died," Tony admits, and for once, it doesn’t sound like something that is drug out of him.  It’s something he’s offering up  “It's usually small things.  You know, the heart stops because of a heart condition and faulty engineering."
Wanda lingers in the back, her gaze steady when Tony meets hers.  There is no red in her eyes or wisping around her fingers when he checks.  She inclines her head to show she sees his check.  Clint stands at her shoulder, bow no-where in sight.  Lang is a bit off to their right.  Sam stands tall to the right of Steve, arms crossed and carefully watching the proceedings before him.  Steve watches Tony with careful eyes.  He looks worn, Tony notes before he closes his eyes briefly.
"We'll deal with everything later then. Want me to tell you about the terrible food they are trying to poison me with here?"
Tony is four, and he has all these ideas in his head, and he can’t sketch them out.  It’s like his brain and his hand can’t communicate, and it just makes him so mad.  When he tries to explain what he is doing, he doesn’t know all the words.  He pauses and when his Dad, Mom or even Jarvis try to help fill in the gaps, they are always wrong.
Steve thinks of the trees in Wakanda, how it felt to let the words loose into the world. How he had wondered if the wind could carry them all the way to where Tony was now. If he could know somehow.
She kisses his forehead, and against his own will, his eyes dip closed and he keeps them shut tightly as her hands disappear from his skin.  Or maybe it’s his skin disappears under her touch.
“It’s too late for removing the accords,” T’Challa says finally.  “I have heard you are looking to make changes to the current version.”
He hadn't been but still argues the point.  She lets him for a moment, remind him of all the dates and how it had hurt.  They've talked about this before, eons ago, a lifetime ago.  He's apologized but now it's just a story of their past.
Warning!  This will be super hard to read.  It's on purpose.  Wanda's a chaotic thinker and the magic made it worse.  So much worse.  Also she's a bit lost in her head.
Then, Howard crosses the room in a few short strides.  He grabs a hold of the back of Tony’s neck and pulls him into a hug that Tony stiffly takes.  “I’m crap at saying this, but you have always made me so proud. Always will.” Tony takes a moment to ease into the hug.
His father sketches, hums and mutters as he works.  His scotch glass marks the fine paper he uses for his blueprints.  Usually, Tony is sitting beside him, as close as he can to his lap or the table, depending on Dad’s mood that day, taking in the designs with wide eyed delight, and listening to the careful explanations or the loud mutters as he slashed through designs and adding notes in the margins.
"Before Ultron but after Manhattan, where I thought, maybe all this could work,” he tells the ice.  Tells the snow.  Tells the shield on the ground near him.  Tells himself.
“The moons and the stars,” he says faintly, and watches as her eyes brighten before narrowing.  She straightens, pulls out her gun and takes one of the enemy soldiers out who broke through the defensive line.
Tony begins to ramble, updating on the treadmill situation he has been tinkering with, because this is what happens when he doesn't sleep and doesn't have Steve around to bully him into keeping normal hours
) drank a DUMMY special smoothie and there had been an hour long puking session and too much yelling and a lot of water and maybe an IV.  He could leave any time he wanted, but the TV in the background was nice.  Rhodey’s willingness to put various forms of liquid sustenance in front of him was even better.
There is red swirling around Vision’s collapsed body, and her eyes blazing brighter with her power than he has ever seen.  It reminds him, actually, of the video of her after Pietro had fallen. The never ending scream and echo of power that erupted from her in waves.
Tony rolls his eyes.  “Okay, I’m trying to make sure the kids don’t kill each other or go crazy in case alien armies decide to descend down from the skies.”
"No," Tony replies. "No. It's not that. If it was that…" Tony needs a drink or five. He scans the room for Scotch and sees none. "If I was worried you were a threat, you would never be around Rhodey."
When he opens his eyes again, Tony’s hand is raised, reaching for the amulet, and he doesn’t even remember beginning to reach for it.  “I’m…” Tony starts and stops, taking stock of himself and his stance. “I’m missing time,” he admits. It feels like something that has to be ripped from him to admit it.
Tony catches his eye, serious when he replies, “Oh, I remember everything about that day.  We started something that mattered. Because of you, the world change.
Steve presses closer and closer, and Tony has to roll his head back and keep from screaming as Steve angles just right hitting the spot that makes his vision explode. Tony fights past the feeling, because he has to watch Steve.
She turns to Steve and adds, *Thanks for the coffee and keeping me company while I was waiting for Tony."
“Continuous improvement young padawan,” Tony retorts as he focuses back on the suit.  He expands out the web system.  “That is how you get the best products on the market and keep a billion dollar company running.”
Tony finishes his drink before hitting a button, “Pop Culture Therapy for Rogers, aka Movie Night in the living room in 10 minutes.”
Steve remembers the fear in his mother's eyes even though he can't remember the rest of her face.  The way he had shaken, rattling apart as he struggled to stay alive, knowing that if he died, he would take her heart too.
(Clint had been the first one, bleeding out between her fingers, from her bullet. “You’ve got good rattling around in that head of yours.”
She throws her stylus behind her without looking, and hears him yelp as he ducks. She smiles for a moment, satisfied before turning around, an ounce of tension leaving her shoulder before she remembers it all, and hunches again.
Tony calls the suit to him merging on his body in a familiar hum. Natasha adjusts the Bites on her wrist. Clint throws a few more arrows in his quiver. Bruce is standing around in his purple pants, breathing in slowly. "Come brothers and sister in arms!" Thor crows. "Let's defeat the giant white blobs."
The other tilts its head at almost an unnatural angle, as if asking him to carry on and complete the thought.  Tony swallows and says, “The longer it went on, the more...not natural they felt. Then I could start influencing the world.  Then I started misremembering things. That’s when I knew something was going on.”
Everything around him tightens, and he can feel the suit begin to incrementally tighten.  “You are beginning to annoy me,” Thanos utters, low and angry. He is bleeding sluggishly from the cut on his arm, but it begins to heal, red glow spiderwebbing up his arm.  He turns his wrist, and Tony can feel his entire body twist.
But Tony can’t focus.  His mind is still scattered. It’s all coming together piece by piece, the memories, the lack of data. There is one clear shot haunting him - it’s Peggy’s face, terrified of him as he said a simple hello in the midst of something that had felt like the a memory. Maybe it wasn’t.  Maybe it never was.
Bruce smiles softly, checking his conversation with FRIDAY, before typing out a final reply.  The list of groceries is finalized.  He looks up, and Tony is staring at him, smoothie almost finished, with a bit of wonder in his eyes.  Bruce meets his gaze, smile lingering.  "You know you don't..." Tony trails off, before looking over at his hologram at the other end of the room.
Don't let the fear of yourself keep you from loving or be loved.  We all deserve it, even if it doesn't feel like it.
His head sinks, and Tony busts out laughing as he looks toward Bruce.  “You feel like helping me torturing the kid?”
“Bagels,” Steve replies just as quiet.  Tony starts shaking uncontrollably, and Steve grips onto him a little bit tighter, pulling him closer until Tony is basically in his lap.  “It’s me Shellhead.”
(They are in the gym, and Steve is standing in his uniform and stace after throwing him down again.  “I appreciate you taking your valuable time to help a desk jockey with his neuroses,” Tony says, hating that he has to keep everything separate.  Trying to keep from giving the game away, but he likes being around Steve. Like the feelings he gets from it. How he feels comfortable in a way he hasn’t in years.
Tony laughs for real that time, until he is bent in half and holding onto his knees gasping for hair.  He straightens after a while and utters, sincerely, “You are going to make it just fine in this era.”
He stays there for a while, hand on the glass, hoping against any actual hope that the glass will change again.
The TV is blaring as Tony and Bruce argue points about the nanobots.  Rhodey is sitting on the couch in jeans and a faded Air Force shirt, upping the volume every time Tony gets antagonistic about the testing phase.
The display’s low whine of alarm increases in pitch and Tony can feel the mask giving a little bit with every thrust into it.  He reaches out blindly, trying to grab it’s arms, flailing a little before the Skrull’s weight is lifted for a moment, and Tony rolls over only to hit the ground with a sickening thud.
“Unless they ate you,” Bruce interjects.  His grimace is painful, and Peter leans over and pats his shoulder sympathetically.  He says something like,
Even though Reed told him there was three Skrulls, he only sees two other people when he hovers over the edge of the ice.  It’s Black Widow and Falcon, costumes from a few years ago. Their faces are unlined, younger in comparison to their counterparts.  It reminds of him of the times before the Registration Act, the fighting, and everything.
She places the gun down.  “I was wondering when I would see you again,” she whispers.  Fury and Coulson both twitch at that but keep still.
“I remember being cold,” Steve continues, like he is forcing the words out of his throat.  “It was like back before the serum, and when we didn’t have heat in the deep winters in Brooklyn.”  He looks to Tony, wry smile on his lips. “I used to huddle with Ma when I was younger. After she passed, Buck would come and camp out in my room, and we would sleep in the same bed.”  His face darkens, and Steve turns back to the window. “I think I only made it out of those winters because of him.”
(She realizes in the middle of the battle with Ultron that Coulson is right, he was always right and just waiting for her to see it.
“I know this is a bad position, but think of it this way, Kurdistan is a country that is not affiliated with the United Nations, so their movements within the country is perfectly legal.”
After a little while, Tony rushes back inside, goggles still on and grabs his glass of water and the bag of baking soda he had asked Ana to give him a day earlier.
Tony grows and crashes upon familiar emotions and Tony is just overwhelmed by the constant thrum of emotion.
Tony knows this face too well.  The one from the days of the endless SHIELD missions.  The one from across an airport. Tony’s seen it too many times to not know it intimately.
"Yeah. Thanks girl," he replies, picking up the tablet and already making the motions to turn it off. He tosses it to the non Rhodey occupied side of the couch and turns. "Any issues honey bear?"
Steve knows him, Tony knows.  Knows his well worn patterns, his habits.  Knows the parts of Tony he keeps close to his chest.
And anyways, he always said his pre-serum memory was like Swiss cheese.  “I’ve got to get back to work.”
(He deserves more. Deserves better than his best friend who took him into a fight and got him paralyzed, but Tony has never been able to get him to see it before, so he doesn't even try now.
The suit reforms and he takes the blade and aims, following Friday’s projection of Hoodie’s fall, and throws.  It hits it’s target as Hoodie hits the ground, blade pinning him to the ground through the chest.
“You sound like you are mad at me about that,” Tony muses.  “Why are you mad at me about that? It was all the kid, not me!”
Tony carefully puts the kit aside and doesn’t look at it as he advances on the food unit they both jokingly call a replicator with a wrench.
Steve's laughter echoes in the empty gym, so Tony regrets it a little less.  He's missed Steve's laughter in the past week, been trying to coax it out of him for a while.
When Tony looks up the trackers it blinks slowly in Steve's room. Tony goes into the room, after knocking for five minutes, and the tracker sits on the nightstand with a note.
"Or maybe not sleeping at all," Rhodey adds, wonder in his voice. "Buddy, you have to get some sleep."
But he doesn’t want to give Steve any sort of permanency in his life.  Not right now. Not where he is, clutching a tiny wrench and with Nat’s words still ringing in his head.  Obies’ have been there since before Afghanistan, casual in his small cutting remarks in a way Tony recognizes as calculated moves now.  (He doesn’t know which is worse. Knowing this or not.). And even thirty years later, when Tony catches Steve in Cap mode, mouth curled down and eyes sad, like he is disappointed in everything Tony chooses to be, he sometimes hears his father's disappointed tone in the distance.
He does the only thing he knows to do in a situation like this. He stands and puts a hole in his bedroom wall, plaster crumbling under his fingers and dust clinging to his clothes. And it doesn’t make him feel any better. Doesn’t take the antsy energy away. Doesn’t do anything besides put a hole in his wall.
Tony’s nostrils flair.  “Okay so I fucked that part up.  But look at me now, all grown up!  I’m working with a partner and FRIDAY runs simulations for everything, and we can’t act like Vision isn’t keeping an eye on my every move.”
He flexes his hand and knows Clint clocks it. Clint, as much as he likes dumpster pizza and is a sort of hopeless but loveable idiot like Natasha always says, sees the small things and tallies them up. The trees for the forest.
“Yes boss,” she repeats as she pulls up video from the last round of testing, notes from him during flights about things to fix.
Eventually, Steve pulls back, just enough to lean his forehead against Tony's and watches as Tony's smile curls, pleased and self satisfied across his face. He doesn't ask are you sure but something on his face must say it for him as Tony studies him back and his grip grows nearly painful on the back of Steve's neck.
“Me too,” she echoes. “But I’m okay with that.”  Covering the red in her ledger with her own, that’s got to be enough, she hopes. It needs to be enough. It’ll have to be. She can’t clean out all the red, so hopefully - Natasha stills the thought.
“I wear the gloves to keep people from freaking out, and it keeps the hand warm, but the inside is heated.  Shuri knew what she was doing,” Tony replies as he leans back against the railing, hand still on Steve’s pulse point.
"In a minute," Tony replies and trudges to the opening, shield in hand. The HUD's vision is slightly greyed out around the edges, and the battery percentage is down to 18%. "Whelp this is going to suck. Time to play catch baby girl." He just steps out.
Tony blinks slowly before looking down.  He comes to himself in phases, awareness sorting itself through his system one limb at a time.  But Bruce is used to the routine.  It's normal for them.  "Yeah," Tony mutters.  "I should."
It’s five weeks later when Tony finally says, “Your best friend broke my arm in new and exciting way, and you broke my brain.  I can’t get you out, even on the drugs.”
“You can’t get any of them Mom,” he urges her.  “You can’t get in the middle of this. This isn’t your place.”
“Fry?” He asks as he rushes forward to protect Wanda from the surge of Chitauri that is taking advantage from her weakness.  Thanos’ eyes have sharpened on her, and even though Rhodey is shooting everything he has at the being, and Hulk is sprinting towards him, he doesn’t look away from Wanda.
It's a familiar sort of noise, and Steve grins to his painting, finally planted on solid ground again.
Tony goes under the water screaming the first time.  He’s shouting things, Yinsen is shouting, the men are shouting things.
“I’m taking these upstairs and going to breathe fresh air. Let me know if you need anything,” he calls over his shoulder as he leaves.
“You always were a stubborn motherfucker who was shit at deadlines,” Tony mutters to himself as he corrects some of Howard’s lines, balancing out the equation in a more elegant way.
He watches Tony breathe, counts the beats. "Was it so bad, the future?" Bucky asks as they await the medics for Tony. The people around him move, but Steve only has one thing on his mind.
He carefully curls his fingers, palms still up until the suit curls back into the reactor he has stuck on his chest.  They all watch it, with varying degrees of interest and horror until he is left in his jeans and T-shirt. His tennis shoes are worn, and he looks out of place in the office.  Coulson and Fury’s faces twist a little at the perceived disrespect.
He can feel the other man observing him.  “People will never learn the true cost of their actions if you keep taking on all the consequences of their actions.”
The footage switches without context to Falcon diving in close to grab the wireless trigger from the kid.  He puts one of Widows love bites on it to short circuit the trigger.  This bomber reaches for a gun to manually trigger the bomb when Red Wing drops in close and tranqs him.  The kid falls, but Falcon catches him before he hits the ground.
“The current Department of Labor head is a former board member of Hammer Technologies, who has a political adviser who used to council former HYDRA political plants like Senator Stern.” She pauses, and takes a breath. “Tony was blackmailed into supporting the Accords.”
He takes in a deep breath when he’s alone in the room and thinks about ice and cold for a moment before quickly heading to the whiskey.  Even the burn as it goes down feels cold.
, he doesn't say. But Tony hears it, like he hears all of the words Steve doesn't say and grips him tightly.
Steve pauses, careful.  “Honestly?”  Tony nods, impatient.  “Trying to make sure you’re still here.  Kind of surprised we’re both still there.”
He says it like it’s a dismissal, and the doors to the lab open. Steve takes a few steps, closer to Tony until Tony has to look up at him, because in the end, they are all fighters and know to keep an eye on your opponent. Tony is weary, and tired, and Steve feels it just standing across from him. “I’m not here to watch you,” he says, carefully, quietly. Tony snorts, and Steve reaches out before aborting the move. Tony is on edge right now, and he won’t accept the touch, even for a second.
Tony loosens his grip on the edge of the couch and takes in some much needed air.  He can see the others do similar things from the corner of his eyes.
Rhodey cuts in and the channel splits for a moment, a fading conversation between Peter and Clint in the background with Sam interjecting every once in a while. “Are you - oh.  Well, you deserve to be eaten.”
He takes in the shell shocked faces before adding on, "Oh look, there is my cue card to say time's up. It's been a pleasure, and any additional questions can go to my PA in the corner over there. Wave at the hungry mob of reporters Jonah. Don't break the poor guy people, he's new, and I would like him to last more than a few weeks."
It takes him two months, but the image he wakes up to of Peter hyperventilating and saying, “Mr. Stark, Tony,
Vision inclines his head.  “I will take this into account for future scenarios.”  He turns back to Bruce.  “It’s a pleasure to finally meet you Dr. Banner.  I have a few queries that hopefully you can resolve.”
"This has to be enough. Will be enough. I just need to find something to focus on. Maybe take Fury up on his offer about DC."
“I think you have more than you realize,” T’Challa responds.  “Let me know when you plan to visit.  I have more than a few things I would like to show you.”
“Coming out of the ice does something like that,” Steve comments blandly, like he knows Tony is on the precipice of something in this moment.
“You know,” Steve begins before pausing.  He fiddles with his chopsticks before continuing, “you can just take it easy.  Take some time off.”
Tony turns back to the floating car zooming back and forth.  He catches it looping in a strange pointed oval, and immediately flicks a camera off, hidden out of Steve's line of vision.  “Time to kill this test drive Jay,” Tony grits out, just enough cheerfulness to not make it seem like he is thinking about rewriting JARVIS’ humor protocols.
The sputtering in his boots jars him, and it’s barely half a second after he realizes what is happening that he goes down.  The Skrull grapples with him, grabbing onto him and throwing a punch. It’s skin has turned green, so he doesn’t have to look Steve in the eye as he punches it.  They roll, Tony struggling to disarm the skull as it wraps it’s legs around Tony’s waist and brings the shield down on his mask.
Tony stands in the middle of an art gallery.  It’s one of the few things left that is still heavily done with paper and pen and by hand.  It makes him feel at home in the future.
The man straightens. His suit is generic and a little worn around the edges. Tony has to keep his thoughts straight because his brown hair is windblown and the whole picture looks too familiar. "Ben Ulrich, Mr. Stark, Daily Bugle. Spiderman has been spotted wearing a new uniform that has some technological upgrades. It looks, frankly, like something out of your wheelhouse."
Steve turns in the doorway, leaning in the door jam in such a painfully familiar way that Tony almost loses what little oxygen in his lungs.  “It’s going to be painful,” he finally gets out. “But most high risk things are,” he adds, rueful. “You’ll come out looking different, but you can’t forget who you are. Science doesn’t change that, just allows it to be augmented.  Make sure you don’t lose the good in all of it.”
he adds, higher pitched for a second before Steve chuckles as he makes his way back to the extraction location.  They debate about treadmills and stationary bikes before Steve finally admits that he's the one who broke the last three treadmills in the compound before he's given up and just started running outside.
Tony looks back down to the case and takes a deep breath before pressing his finger against the scanner.  It beeps loudly in the silence of the room.
"I have issues with everyone," Steve says.  "I've always found it easier to add to the conversation.  Not start it."
, he had wanted to say, but there was no space for words, not after the video. Not after he had held his tongue for so long on so many things.
Tony tugs off the glove on his right hand before leaning over and wrapping his fingers around Steve’s wrist.  It’s warm.
There are pictures littering her vanity, of her and Howard.  Her and Peggy. Of him, around age 4, 7, and infant sized. Of Jarvis and Ana.  Of Daniel and Peggy. Of Howard and him. It’s his family, his childhood strung across this table with her make up and lipstick.
"As I was saying," he continues. "The Avengers will be taking a step back as the UN continues to evaluate the current rules and regulations around the Accords after the incident in Germany and the whole Winter Soldier," he waves his hand, "situation."
Tony’s cheeks hurt from smiling too much.  He puts a fist out, and Steve gently bumps it with his. “That was the plan Captain my Captain.”
He picks up the next piece, the new ARC reactor that he was thinking about installing in the suit under a layer of Starkium.  Vibranium had been a something he had thought about for a second, but Tony remembers the video from the Siberian facility FRIDAY had shown him after the bruises had turned green.  It glows vibrantly, and the glasses list output numbers in the corner of his vision.  It could power the suit even in the event of his death, but could cause a nuclear explosion with the right combination in case Tony needs that option.  He inspects the locking mechanism, twisting it left and right to make sure it wouldn’t engage.  Tony is pressing his thumb against the edge at 7 o’clock when the reporter busts out, “It looks like we have footage of Captain America himself in battle.  Be warned, this footage is graphic and should not be viewed by anyone under the age of 18.”
, something in him aches.  Tony swallows it down because he can’t wallow in that.  Not again.  Not anymore.
Steve, who had been carefully putting away the plate from earlier, looks up, startled.  "Um," he starts and it hangs, awkward like it hasn't been for a while.  Not between them.  "Uh."
Not replying, Tony finds an open spot close and then goes downwards.  He moves his feet out of the way and sets the two down a little roughly before looking to Vision.  Wanda has her hands out, palms hovering above his head, and her eyes are glowing redder than he has seen before.  He opens his mouth, almost tells her it’s worthless, and he’s dead, and she needs to turn back to the battle before she’s dead too. But her mouth is moving, and Friday puts the text on the screen, carefully silent.
T’Challa follows as the walk down the hallway to the frosted glass room.  The table is smaller than the one at the Avengers Compound, but it does fine for this meeting.  “I confess,” the man behind the Black Panther announces.  “I did not suspect you would have conference room in your home.”
Okay quick recap.  Tony is trying to work on himself and forgive himself for a lot of things.  He's trying to get over the epic Avengers breakup.  He's trying to reconcile his now with what he wants.  This is how Tony (or my Tony) does stuff.  Faces it down, takes all that hurt and works through it.
"Got it boss," FRIDAY voices from the tablet speakers, and Tony knows there is another prototype being tested in a virtual diagnostic downstairs right now.
After Afghanistan, he would say they were looking for cracks.  Something to exploit. Obie did. Peeled away the mask and found the small boy underneath and whispered promises until he allowed Tony to twist himself into something he hadn’t been on the path for before.  Obie hadn’t twisted him. But he’d watched. He’d watched and used it.
Tony’s grateful to be on the ground, because it sets off an earthquake that sends everyone to their feet.  Thor’s eye is glowing, and he is crackling with electricity. He raises a hand upwards, and a lightning strike hits him before he redirects it in arching streams at the Chitauri around them until there isn’t anyone standing for 50 feet around them.
Nodding, Tony turns back to the mug and wipes it dry in a few easy movements. He puts it up, carefully trying to keep the noise to a minimum. He turns back to see
Tony restarts the one where he was in the only Jarvis residence.  He sits there, dazed as he stares around the dusty room.  It still hasn’t changed.  With a quick stretch of his fingers, his face is zoomed in.  There are tear tracks.  “Are we taking into consideration any variation that would be necessary with extreme emotions and recovery times.”
Bruce’s shoulders go up, and he grabs ahold of a nearby chair.  “Tony that isn’t the problem at hand.”
He gives a chuckle a moment later, “We’ve outlived them.”. He shakes his head.  “I never thought that would happen.”
The man on the table is angled away, but has long shaggy brown hair and is muzzled.  Tony's seen the pictures of Barnes in DC.  It's the same kind of mask.
“I know you,” Steve whispers, and it feels like an incantation. Tony meets his gaze, and Steve holds it. “I believe in you.”
"There was a moment," he says, dazed. His vision is blurry, doubling.  Then tripling.  If he squints, he can see the fight playing out in front of him.  Barnes and Steve double teaming him, and Tony quickly losing the higher ground with every attack.
Steve cooks, Tony critiques.  They play war games off the old battles they used to fight.  They exist in a world built in the three bedroom apartment 300 years in the future, and Tony doesn’t feel like he should exist outside of it.
Tony whimpers, hips jerking upwards and meet Steve’s on his way back down. And Tony keeps his eyes trained on Steve, the way his skin glistens from the beading sweat. The way Steve bites his lips to keep from making any noise, a remnant from the past Tony thinks. The way he is always seeking Tony with his hands or mouth after he pulls his cock back before easing back in at the steady pace they are going. Steve’s always trying to find him again the moment they aren't together. Pressing whatever he can reach to him, curling into Tony.
Carol leads the Avengers in his stead.  She dies in battle thirty years after him.  Kamala Khan takes on her legacy and shoulders it for another fifty years after before she goes down too.
Tony tries to find the spot over Steve’s shoulder he tends to favor in tough conversations, right above his ear, but Steve lays a heavy hand on his keep that gently directs his attention back to the man’s face. “Why did you kiss me?” Tony asks instead.
He tilts his head back, staring at the glass covering the ceiling.  Bruce is moving, Tony can see it in the reflection.  The silence rings in the room.
Slowly, with some level of dawning horror, everyone watches as Thanos takes the stone and brings it to the open spot in the gauntlet.  It snaps into place, and Tony begins to rush towards the purple giant, something screaming at him in the back of his head,
Vision’s magenta face looks amused in his carefully neutral expression.  “FRIDAY and I were taking bets on who would win.”
“My mother hated it you know,” he continues.  “I used to take things apart and put them back together, but she would walk in on me dismantling the microwave or toaster or anything I could get my hands on.”  He looks up, and Steve is trying to make it closer. “Jarvis thought it was hysterical. He loved it in his own way.”
The Captain bounds into the fray, reckless.  He has grabbed a tank panel on his way in, and is using it when the bullets go flying.  Once he gets close enough, the rain of bullets slow, and he tosses the panel, throwing the soldiers on the left a good ten feet back. He lands his first punch on the guy nearest his right, twisting at the soldier who comes in on his left and upper cuts the next guy in front of him.  He kicks out to the left and takes out the ones who he ducked.
The singing is now a hum in the back of his mind too.  The stone is still here, still active. Still aware.
He takes in a few more breaths, the blooms of her garden filling his lungs, reminding him of springs at her side, quiet instructions and her patience as she taught him something he has long forgotten.  The way she had loved the flowers there with the same steadiness, and knows she never needed to hear the words. She said it in every touch, every smile.
He fights back a chill.  The churning of His stomach.  The chill creeping in with the reactor gone.  The slow horror of wondering,
If he is remembering it correctly, this was about when Tony had started on the first version of the nanobots.
Rhodey sees the text from his perch at the bar, coffee mug in hand. "It's Nat," he says, voice even.
He looks back across the field at Thanos’ gauntlet.  There are nearly six stones there. He looks back at the briefcase before looking to Sharon.
He sees himself, looking at Steve, back in that hallway, back in the beginning, and the hope rising in his throat with a
There is a low sound on the other end. "Fuck him. Who cares about him. What matters is you're okay. You're still here. You coming home right?"
The Iron Spider Suit has been a take on his suit armor.  Lightweight, but strong enough to take a hit.  It doesn’t compress down into a watch or even a cool backpack, but they had been on a time crunch.  It’s still better to hide than a mask in a backpack and a suit under a hoodie.  There are a few access ports in case they need to get into the suit if it’s on the fritz.
She meetings Steve's eyes before continuing, "There is a law in the House of Representatives to make War Criminals work for the government instead of doing jail time."  She pauses before adding, "It’s going to pass.”
The sun is shining and in the distance, they can see the shimmer of the barrier, but not the monsters on the other side.  T’Challa is marching with different contingents of warriors, suit and mask in place already as he speaks with a larger man with a monkey pelt over his shoulder.
The warriors have been steadily working on the left flank.   Steve’s group on the right have spread out a bit more into the middle with his contingent. The Hulk is working steadily through the majority of the forces; Ant-Man tagging in and out when needed with him.
Tony clocks the five original heat signatures moving back towards the building.  Steve's picked up shield and working on knocking out the two guys left.  Tony just says, "five incoming" as Steve takes down the last guy before the door busts open with the five come running into the room.
"Stay," Tony says and Steve looks back to him. Tony is looking at the painting on the easel. It's of Clint looking to Natasha, eating popcorn with her tablet in hand. It's the closest Steve has gotten to thinking too much about that moment. Out of everything he thinks about, that discussion with Clint is something he has locked down.
(Steve had laughed when he had come on comms, just before he leap out of a plane, and Tony tries to not memorize how the way the laugher had melted into the whoosh of the air.  The agent on the other line, and then Hill, hadn't been so happy.)
The battle field is still paused but the green has faded from everyone.  The heavy weight holding them in place let’s go, but many are affected by the appearance Death and fall to their knees, aliens and superheroes alike.  Tony stumbles but very carefully locks the suits armor so he can’t fall.
There is an echoed like screaming that makes everyone still before the whole battlefield goes silent.  The air before Thanos ripples, like it is trying to stretch side to side, then up and down, before it cracks open, like a yawn, to show inky darkness behind it.
"No kiddo," Tony responds darkly. "The Accords. I'll fight for those until my dying breath. We fuck up. We all do. It's what makes us human. But we have to have consequences or we'll become inhuman. And Ultron," he pauses. There are so many things that could be said, should be said, but won't be. "That was an attempt at trying to be more inhuman than I should have. But there is a parallel universe where that program worked. Where we achieved it, and I got to retire and tinker with things like prosthetics and internet chips in your brain, and we never had these issues."
But before he had put everything back under lock and key, Tony had fiddled with the formula or the energy used to activate the serum.  Had laughed and refined it, and then put it away without thinking about it again after getting too drunk to mention.
Tony looks blearily down at his two day old shirt, three day old sweats and empty coffee cup.  "Peachy," he replies before putting his cup under the coffee maker.
Howard looks up, briefly, at Tony and nods before turning back to his paper.  Tony removes the iron and quickly unplugs it.  He dunks the board in his water glass Mom had set aside for him before peeling back the paper.  The dark marks on the board aren’t as dark has he had expected, so he grabs the sharpie he had gathered from his father’s desk a few weeks previous and colors in the lines.
, he thinks, and doesn’t see the mansion with Ana and Jarvis waving at him.  Mom sitting in a chair with a glass of lemonade in hand, or Dad pouring over papers in his study.  He sees Vision, Rhodey, Bruce and Spidey around a dinner table, Pepper.  There are more, if he looks, but he doesn’t look this time.
Steve ducked his head and nodded, “Yea. He found her. They did the whole courting.” That’s quite a term, Tony thought. “And they got married, and they had me.” Steve's eyes changed, a little sad and he spoke again. “She was sick. They thought it wasn’t a good idea for her to have kids. But she was stubborn and had me, she was strong for a while and then one day the illness took her.” Tony couldn’t stop himself; he reached a hand to hold Steve’s. Steve held on tight.
“Good morning Anthony” warm green eyes settles on him. He should avoid Loki, but at this moment he was a safe zone and maybe close to normalcy.
He was completely exhausted, so he’ll give the guy the benefit of the doubt. What could be worse at this point, really. “Bucky it is.” Rubbing his hand over his now stubble chin. “So here a question for you—are we hallucinating from a gas leak?”
Rhodes gently tapped Clint’s shoulder with his knuckles, “Come on Tones, we needed stuff and—well you didn’t stock up enough. And I’m also part of the MIT Alumni—you’re not the only one handy here.”
Bucky made them breakfast. A nice greasy type breakfast for the hangovers. They would need it since there was an agenda placed for them. Tony took notice at Rhodey squinting at Bucky every so often.
“Um, Hello! Anthony Stark, The Stark—Stark industries ring a bell” Bucky responded. Steve finally turned to give him with a puzzle look as if that should answer everything. “Stark Industries! A multinational industry company, huge in all tech stuff," Bucky beamed.
It didn’t matter since Tony started to stir. He slowly lifts off Rhodey, smacking his lips, “God I need water.”
Silence fell between them and Tony felt a small smile creep to his mouth as his mother’s face pinched up in adorable frustration, tapping her fingernails against the fridge door, studying the inside of the fridge.
“Knock it off.” Steve rolled his eyes and looked back down at his art, closing up the sketch book and tucking it back into his bag.
“I do,” Tony said, taking his fingers in his. Both of their hands were soft, rid of the callouses that had come from their mortal lives.
“You told me to get a life, and I did. I did everything for you. Everything. Every day I loved Peggy, I thought of you. Every evening I spent out, laughing, making new memories, I thought of you. I told myself that it was all okay, that everything was okay because I was happy. But you don’t understand what it's like to live with survivor guilt, Tony-”
“Because you were dead, Tony!” Steve said, his frustration beginning to erase the gentle ease he had earlier.
When tiny Steve Rogers had invited Tony Stark to a sleepover, he couldn't anticipate... well, anything.
“Not that this isn’t super cute, or whatever, but I refuse to third-wheel until Clint gets his ass dead, so….” Natasha waved her pb&j sandwich in the air, and Steve perked up, grinning at her.
“Do you, do you really?” Steve asked, eyes glistening. “I missed you. Every day. More than I even realized I could. I cherished every moment of seeing you in the news, becoming the man you were destined to be. Tony Stark, I love you. Unbelievably so.” He said, but then stood.
Several moments passed until Maria closed up the song, and when the room fell quiet Tony let out a soft, relaxed sigh.
But Thor was different. He was inviting. He was loud. He treated every person the same, even if he didn’t know their name. He would laugh, clap your back, call you beautiful, tell you a story with just the same animosity that he would’ve told to anyone else. You would be too caught up in him to even question, to even doubt if you were his friend at all.
Moments like these were rare, and Tony allowed himself to enjoy the feeling. A wave of brief nostalgia always stroked his spine, sending familiar shivers up his skin as the music reminded him of simpler times in his life, when things didn’t seem to particularly matter, and Tony was still allowed to play pretend.
So why was he sitting there in his seat, supernova bursting in his stomach, terrified and clammy? Because Thor Odinson was made to love a woman, surely, was made to praise the ground she walked on, kiss her dainty fingers, stroke her thin neck with his own mouth. He was made to paint a girl with love and ravishment. He was made to do that.
Slowly settling into Steve's grip, Tony fluttered his eyes closed and hugged him back. Even if Mrs. Rogers wouldn't be too pleased with seeing them like this in the morning, at least it wouldn't be his father finding them instead.
Thor noticed her eyes, her smile, the way she squeezed his leg and leaned over to kiss his cheek, gently saying that she needed to use the bathroom for a bit, and then the sway of her hips as she left the table, leaving Thor to stare after her, his throat drying up.
Natasha was always a dark, glowing red surrounded by stars scattered along the most fragile parts of her. Her skin was a vibrant moon blue, but she was almost always exclusively warm colors and had a thing for eliciting purples under the reds she exhibited. Sometimes when she smiled she turned orange and made the world turn grey in comparison. That's what Steve liked about her; she was fierce and gentle and had hidden things under her skin and inside her mouth. She could be any color if she tried hard enough, though it honestly depended on the time of day. When she was that deep, beautiful scarlet red, though, it was when Steve was dipping into her embrace, squeezing the colors out of her aura.
But what was Tony supposed to do? What could he do? There was no way he was going to get any sleep tonight without his bear, so, away from the prying eyes of his father and mother, he stuffed his teddy deep into his bag and hoped they wouldn't notice its disappearance over the weekend.
"Okay.." Steve said and scooted over to press himself against the wall, getting comfortable once again as he waited for the bed to dip under Tony's small weight. It never did. Curiously, Steve perked up and crawled back across the bed, peeking down at the floor and seeing Tony curling up on the carpet.
Well. Another innuendo. Tony laughed again, then laid back into the Sand, looking up at the dusking Sky. She was losing her light, and Tony thought to himself: If the Sky was so great and everything, why did the Sun seem so adamant about leaving? Tony could see the Sky lose her light and turn dark when the Sun escaped. He’d lead her on, say things would be bright and beautiful, but then he’d leave every time and the Sky was alone, only accompanied by-is that a sixth subject? It was. It was the stars-well. Several. They definitely didn’t love the Sky. They were flings and they freckled along Sky’s dark, broken facade. Tony felt his chest twist a bit as he stared. He hated space.
“It's okay that we never got to do that in life. I’m okay with that, because you had Morgan, and Peggy was my girl. But… now… now I don't see why not.” He said gently, and when Tony didn't respond, he swallowed and looked away.
You could say that perhaps, Tony was moving a little too quickly. He had never gone on a playdate with Steve, let alone with anybody at all, and already he was going to stay the night at his home?!
Much like his friends, Steve enjoyed drawing their colorful connection with the world, and boy, did he realize all too quickly that Tony was a living, breathing forest. Not just a forest, but also the mountains and caves and rivers that came with. He found himself painting growing plants, alive, sprouting from his skin, and flowers caressing across his hairline and wrapping around his wrists. Steve painted vines that curled along the curves of Stark's body, gripping him to the world. He was trees, branches and all, and he was grey skies too, rain falling onto high mountains in the distance, covered in white snow. He wanted those mountains on Tony's throat, starting at the base of his neck and blooming to the sky where the grey clouds faded under the glow of Tony's skin, as if his face were the sun.
The passenger side door opened, Loki stepped out. Thor moved instantly to stand by him, “You should not be here,” he frowned.
He let out a breath and grabbed Rhodey for a hug. Rhodey chuckles and patted his back, Tony saw movements in his kitchen and scrunch his face, “Clint?”
Tony frowned, and waved at the display in front of them, “I think at this point my third eye is open.” Sam laughed at that.
“No, I’m staying right here.” He said firmly, but a touch of fondness. He was gentle with Loki, which made Tony
He grabbed a lamp on a nearby table and stupidly, like a horror movie, went to the door. He was going to hate himself, he flung the door open and nothing “Typical” grumbled and jumped at the tap on his shoulder.
She took her sunflower glasses off. Her amber eyes twinkled, “Oh he is. But I know for a fact that it is not food.” She winked. Tony eyed Steve and the big guy ears were red. Oh, how cute! He let out a laugh.
Steve sighed and gave his best friend a glare. He knew it wouldn’t intimidate Bucky—he needed to get his point across. He turned to look at the living room. Observing the collapsed couch, he should get a new one.
“Pepper called, she was worry about you being on your own. So, I came down and, on the way, asked Laura permission to let Clint come out to play.” Clint chime in, “Man, without the GPS coordinate on your car we have no clue how to get here. This place is weird.” He took another bite of his sandwich.
He could confidently say now, that Thor’s parents were living a very comfortable life. Looking at the two-story colonial white, and some gold, house. With a nice porch with two rocking chairs, he held a chuckle on that.
So, here some backstory, I guess. A little research was done, and a lot is a bunch of baloney. It's fiction guys.
“Hey!” Clint snapped. Though they knew that neither one was going to be abandon the other. They just tend to go either panic mode or humor. Even if it was inappropriate, but it worked.
“So, no choice,” he flexed his fingers on the steering wheel, “I-it was hard, this whole thing…” he let a out a slow breath. “Now this…”
“Yea, the bear I mention earlier, Bruce.” Said bear, stopped and stood staring at them both curiously.
But Tony looked happy and spoke a mile a minute that even Bruce was trying to keep up. Just like that they both learned something about Tony. He was a genius, and it excited him in what Bruce could reveal about Asgard. Tony even helped Bruce in a dilemma he was having. And Steve was proud of his mate.
Steve coughed. “Your friends went into town with Buck” he needed to get a hold of himself. “Cool,” he moved closer towards him, but kept a good distance. “Were you growling?”
With a frown, he moved a hand to grasp Tony forehead. Tony felt a current run through him, down to his spine. It felt good but worrisome. “Uh, what are you doing?” Tony knocked Steve hand off him. Confused,
“We travel, work and choose to live among mortals.” Steve spoke. “And we don’t age fast. So, sometimes you just have to fake a death or disappear.” He stated.
Bucky cleared his throat. Getting everyone’s attention. Bringing Thor up to speed and announcing the prankster being Jared.
Also, I wanted to put out if anyone has any time to help beta this? I do try to proofread and edit, I’m terrible, I would like the help. I just need someone that doesn’t mind, pretty much mpreg and whatever else my mind comes up with. Not into abuse or rape so don’t worry about that. Need someone who has the time and patient. Maybe help when I get stuck? Please message me on here, thank you!
“It’s not like you don’t like to do this stuff.” Rhodes smiled. “I am a genius, a graduate from MIT. With a Master’s in engineering and physics—and you guys… pretty much sold me out for a bag of potato chips and a toaster,” he lifts said toaster.
She was dressed in overalls with a crop white long sleeve top. She wore sunflower glasses with orange tint lenses. And her smile was huge, with a little gap between her front teeth. Her hair was thick black curls, she was curvy and her brown skin that shown—shined.
Bucky chuckled as he watched Steve jammed his finger. Sipping at his coffee. Feeling eyes on him he turned to smile at Tony, he shifted his mug at him. Tony did the same. Steve just notice him as he frowned at him.
And thinking of that, he frowns. Wade was a huge issue. He pushes Steve, challenging him for Tony. And yeah, he was immature—Tony had no clue what Wade was up to. And he sure as hell would not let the kid get in his way.
“WADE!” a voice boomed, it shook the walls of the house. Everyone turned their attention, lion included, to the big guy, Thor.
She motioned to it. “As the story pass from our ancestors. This tree connects all of us. How it came to be is the mystery. But it brought us to life. Spread us around the world and holds our true nature.”
The door swung opened. And Tony skid to a stop as he almost collided into Wade. Oh, the kid that started all this. He frowned, Wade just brighten from seeing Tony.
Brushing fingers in his beard, he wasn’t too sure what to do at this point. You don’t just come out like this. “Are sure you want to know? The less you know the quicker—” he paused, “You’ll go home” foul taste, he kept down another growl.
They were so cute, and a few were pups, wolves. And their little snout were in the air sniffing and turned to see Bucky and Steve and they all tackled the grown men. Steve was laughing at being licked and Bucky shifted, springing up and taking off, a few pups tailing behind him.
Steve place wasn’t that big. He watched him go hang their jackets up and moved a short way to the kitchen. He saw a small table set up for two. A candle lit. Steve ears were completely red now.
Tony had his first kiss when he was thirteen. It was clumsy and too much spit. He remembered their hearts pounding.
“As if we all forgotten what regular people looks like. Come now all give your once over and go about your damn business” Loki gritted out. And everyone turned away and far away from Loki mostly. Tony chuckled.
“Thanks.” Steve just bowed his head and moved to get out. This time he moved to Tony side and held the door for him. “Such a gentleman. But, hope you know I have a curfew.” He joked.
Rhodey started first, “Yes, one, Tony has a curfew, must be home by midnight.” Steve wasn’t sure if Rhodey was kidding.
Steve plunge into his mouth as Tony gasp. Pressing Tony down the seat. He held onto Steve collared shirt. It crossed his mind that he should fight him. Weren’t they upset with each other?
He should just go back home. But damn it to hell if he wasn’t so stubborn to find this damn place. Maybe it was a family trait. Not one Stark’s or Aunt Peggy would concede defeat.
He stepped to the passenger side and let Pepper in first. And soon he was behind the wheel and pulled off.
Tony returned to the homestead. Oh yes, Tony for the time being was going to think this place as such.
“Shut up” Steve barked out, his ears turning red. He wasn’t flirting… he wasn’t sure what he was doing. His was divided. A part of him was trying to stay rational while the other—fighting that part was exhausting. That part wanted something from Tony. And Tony wouldn’t understand that part. Even though, Steve was getting uneasy, edgy.
“The last visitor Asgard had was about two…three decades, maybe” Loki tap at his chin. Leaving Tony mouth slightly opened.
Steve stood, “We’ll leave you at it.” He patted his shoulder empathically. Steve held a hand out to Tony, waiting.
They both stood watching Sam daughter, yes, the goddess was Sam pride and joy, playing with the children. They were attached to her and Frigga. They sparked this feeling of love and safety.
As I write this fic, I just want those to know that I try hard to be sensitive to a lot of things. I do hope I have not offended anyone. If I have, it's not my intention- it's hard to describe where I'm going with this but I'm just flowing with my creation. As I continue to write this... I was thinking to myself that it is probably going to get weird, but I guess we'll get to that sooner or later.
“That kid—you know lion kid, Jared? He said that was the best.” Bucky could not hold back. He grips his sides as he started laughing.
My inspiration to all of this was Sit next to me by Foster the People—Yeah, I don’t know, was listening to it and thought Steve x Tony and my mind rolled with it.
“So far it’s awesome, guards included.” He pointed to Steve and Bucky. Sam eyes roamed Tony, head tilt looking over to Steve and his eyes landed on Bucky. “They are overwhelming. Especially when they get growly. Wolves.” He scrunched his nose at that.
“Well hello!” the older man full-toned voice responded. He moved to take his cane, as he took steps closer to Tony.
“Come sit my little darlings.” Frigga spoke. Her voice was velvet sweetness to Tony ears. This is the first time he ever came to close contact with her. Her hair was golden and cascaded in curls. Her eyes were warm emeralds, the corners wrinkled. But she still looked young, Tony would surmise she was probably in her fifties, if this was a normal place. And he could not believe she gave birth to Thor.
There’s always some urge to fight or do something with their abilities. But Steve just wanted to help. Tony could see how good a leader Steve was. How his friends followed his command. How he talked to the Asgardian. They knew Steve; the kids knew him and were comfortable with him.
Tony was not a coward. He always faces on all obstacles. Steve was—he wasn’t sure what Steve is exactly. At least towards him. He was frightening to Tony, too much an unknown for him.
It started with a noise, but scratch that out since he was in the middle of the woods, of course there be some noises. Then a bang was heard, something shatters somewhere, and his heart stopped at the banging to the front door.
, but when he looks out to the field and sees his team getting over run.  When he thinks about a world without a single one of them in it, even if talking to some make him want to run away. The thinks about snuffing out their sparks to save himself, and he can barely swallow against the bile that rises up in his throat.
Tony knows his face, the pinched worry look Steve gets when he has a plan but he knows the others won’t like.  He’s seen it too many times before Steve says something self sacrificing and something's even suicidal. “You have JARVIS keeping a close eye on me,” Tony tells him as he picks at the lo mein in front of him.  “You can ask him for an update. I won’t be insulted.”
“Michael is alive, kind of.  He has a daughter Sharon. There is also the whole clone thing.  You have them hidden away in the countryside in England right now.  I think,” Tony hedges, looking towards Fury and Coulson. Both seem confused, and Tony’s betting no one’s a deputy director just yet.  “Not 100 percent sure exactly when we are.”
The silence in the room fills him to the point of bursting, too much silence, not enough thoughts in his head. The clink of the dishes helps. Moving helps more. Focusing one by one as the dishes get picked up and put away.
“You act like these stones are sentient,” Tony bites out, incredulous, even while something in the back of his mind sings
Bruce’s hand rests on his back as they shake and laugh for a good five minutes, until it almost turns into a chokes sob that Tony bites back last minute.  He pulls back when he can breathe normally and the ache in his stomach isn’t debilitating any more.
The room lightens - a hologram bursts to life, and Tony takes a sip before he starts. "Okay let's break this thing down again Fry. Walk me through it."
Bruce watches Tony, and Tony shrugs his shoulders in response.  “Extremis was used to help with my heart.  I’m not a good baseline candidate for a test.”
When Tony dips his head in thanks, he takes in Steve’s eagle eyed stare of the two of them and then Peter.  He meets Tony’s gaze before giving one short, sharp nod and turns back to the group.
Tony grins, and he can see the visual reaction Bruce has to it.  Knows he is using too much teeth, but can’t keep for the way he is baring them.  “Wakandians don’t like Starks.”
He crosses the room to where Dr, Perez is watching, eyes bright.  “You did good work,” Tony states beside him.  They watch as the two interns field questions for the last two minutes of their presentation.  Rihan is enthusiastically demonstrating bending her false leg.
He decided to trust Tony in that moment.  Just trust him at this word, double speak and missing phrases and all that.  Bruce had rolled his shoulder and said, "Okay.  Okay then.  Send me scans."
he hears between the lines and his eyes dart to Steve who is carefully not looking their ways, but Pepper catches it like she does everything else and her grin widens.
The words resound down to Tony’s bones, and something rattles in the back of his mind.  Like a sense of deja vu.
“You don’t need me Reed,” Tony mutters, low enough the less enhanced in the audience can’t hear it.  Logan, well Tony knows not to try to get around him if he wants to listen. “The more I am around, the harder it will be to get anyone on your side.  You need me gone. It’ll be fine. I just need to work separate for a while.”
FRIDAY is still talking in his ear, but Tony feels fuzzy, tired down to his bones, and he just drifts away - dreaming.
He smiles at the look on her face in the final piece.  Fierce, fearless. He misses her, but it hurts less these days.  A dull ache instead of a sharp pain he used to push down every morning.
Steve takes the moment and angles his head quick enough to latch onto the covered side of Tony’s shoulder, biting down fiercely, and Tony tries to hold back a groan, bites it down, down down, but instead it tumbles out, low and urgent. Steve move to full back, pulls his teeth away just as the nerves in his skin shift into pleasure, and Tony begins to feel it all over his body. He tightens his grip on Steve’s hair and pushes him back down as he moves closer, hips bumping and pressed as closely as he can.
He grins, sharp and with bitter edges.  “Useless Starks are only useful in one way - dead.”  His vision is going dark, and this is familiar. Tony closes his eyes and hope it’s quick, faster than it was before as the chill soaked into his bones and his breathing slowed until he couldn’t any more.
It’s a bit like when he initially went and walked Brooklyn after he woke up.  Some things are the same, but home isn’t home anymore and he knows it down to his bones.  He can either try to get familiar with the landscape or just give up and find somewhere new.
They stay down there, spitting ideas back and forth as FRIDAY records them, until Vision drifts through the ceiling causing a bark of fright from Bruce.  “Colonel Rhodes has asked both of you to come upstairs for dinner.  He says, and quote, ‘I’m not fixing dinner to get stood up.  Tell Tony to drag his butt up down before I come down there and do it for him.”  His voice is a perfect mimicry of Rhodey’s.  Tony isn’t sure if it’s a recording or something of his own creation.
Tony reaches up, trying to grab onto the edge of the bed to sit up and becomes aware of the sensors on his hands, temples, throat, and chest.  He stills and tries to study the room and sees Steve huddled in a corner.
Tony feels like he has been punched in the arc reactor, and it’s unconscious when he replies softly, “Cap, call me Tony.”
There is a distinct lack of buzz in the back of his mind, and it makes Tony nauseous if he thinks about it too hard.  The disconnection from everything, the way his suit reacts too slow - it’s frustrating, mortifying even, with how slow he’s allowed himself.  How reliant he is on the shiny tricks.
And he owes Bucky. He is the reason Bucky became the Winter Soldier, and if fixing his mistakes means Tony hates him, well, it's still the right thing to do.
“Not after the Germany battle?” he voices.  Because they had had gatherings, he remembers, but Tony has been curiously separate from the rest.  Showing up from time to time, but never lingering too long.  Maybe they had been drifting for longer than he was even aware.
"Tony, you weren't imaging multiple scenarios where I didn't come back whole, were you?" Rhodey's voice...all Tony can remember is the time when he called Rhodey after the whole Obie situation was over. The tone is the same as when Tony had said, Obie was the one who had me kidnapped and then I killed him and he had said, Tony, it's me. It's okay. You had to. If it's ever you versus anyone, I need you to make it out, okay?
"Wow that's a little personal!" Tony utters, shocked into action as he wheels around to look at Steve.  His eyes are wide and panicked so Steve clenches his jaw shut tight enough his teeth click.
"Last night," Rhodey shrugs as he reaches for the stack of water bottles on the coffee table. "Vision kept a close eye on me while I tried. Then he deemed me good enough to move without the cane or the wheelchair."
, he remembers saying.  His voice was full of false cheer, back straight and grin firmly on his lips.  Rhodey had had a tightest in his face as he agreed, hand on Tony’s shoulder as they had stood together before Germany.  Before the airport.  Before-
Strange opens his necklace thing and shows the broken green stone.  He traces the jagged edge and Tony knows the rest of that is somewhere in the back of his mind.  “When the stones were made at the beginning of the universe, thousands of beings were sacrificed to create this amount of power.  The creation of the stones meant peace, so the beings went willingly.” He meets Tony’s gaze, “Can’t you hear the singing?”
There feels like a million shattered pieces inside of him, illusions, ideas, and so much anger that broke and what's left is stuffed inside of him. Moving with him and pressing against vital organs and just aches.
“You wanted Death?” Tony asks, and it echos distantly, like he isn’t here in this moment.  And he isn’t. He’s everywhere. Every timeline, every moment in history. He’s at the beginning and the end.  He’s the Alpha and the Omega.
"Any one who has not signed the Accords is, at this point in time, in direct conflict with the Accords, as long as they are in a country aligned with the United Nations, and all citizens are charged with trying to help bring those persons to justice. No one more so than me, considering I was one of the first Avengers to sign. Did you know it was part of the Accords is that you are beholden to UN committee to try and apprehend anyone in a UN country?" He paused and took in his audience, "Oh, I see some confused faces. It's somewhere on page 497 on that novel. But as long as the persons are on a negotiating list with the UN, they're safe. Like Spiderman."
Instead Natasha puts her left arm out and Tony smirks but doesn’t move.  Instead the Spider kid leans in closer on his right and glares the best he can in a mask.  The surprising thing is Shuri.  Steve remembers her as the self confident, joyful 16 year old, but in at 18, there’s more to her hint of steel as she stands there evaluating the scene.  She watches and waits just past Tony’s shoulder, taller than either of them. Natasha drops her hand.
He grips the piece of metal so hard it begins to dig into his skin.  Blood begins to drip down his hand. “Tony,” Steve says, and his voice breaks in the middle.  “Tony don’t do this to me. Don’t make me lose you again.”
Thanos twists his wrist and the green stone, glows and everyone is stilled in an echoing green glow. Tony struggles and is unable to do anything while the gauntlet glows with an unholy light, too bright, and it causes half there figures to dance across his vision.  Thanos’ grin, the first smile they have seen this entire fight, sends a shiver down his spine. Everyone is slowing down and the fight is coming to still, whether it’s because of the gauntlet or in sheer fear of what comes next is negotiable.
Tony sat in his mother's lap, a glass of milk to match theirs in the beginning. He always thought these were the best nights. The ones where all his family was in one room.
His chest is moving too fast, like he can’t breathe.  Tony’s trembling, and he wants to reach out, but he can’t do this again.  Can’t live with him hallucinating Steve - not again.
Tony's face mask is up and his eyes are wide and panicked.  He is calling for someone, fumbling for Steve's chest, armor flecked with blood.
He puts that project aside and picks the paperwork on the latest SI patents and tries to break down the white papers, the concepts and equations the teams are using to improve detection of anomalies in space from beyond Jupiter.  He writes on the windows, breaking down the equations, step by step. He goes back to window one twenty times before Steve comes back in the door.
