Ever since the serum Steve had never found someone stronger than him, other than the Hulk and maybe Thor but they were pretty evenly matched.
Steve pushed his shoulders down into the pillows and raised his hips, fucking into his hand. His grip was loose enough to be teasing. He had been horny the whole time Tony was conducting his experiments and he didn’t want this to be over so soon. His body was crying out for him to give in and just cum as quickly as possible; to just get on with it, but he kept it slow, or at least, as slow as he could.
“Trust me Cap,” Tony winks, letting Steve drop the shield on the bed. He then puts the blanket on the shield and sits himself on it, and Steve realises that Tony is basically going to hump his shield, not just jerk off over it.
People had many opinions about the Iron Man armour. Some thought it was cool, others thought it was an eyesore. There were people who thought it was a dangerous weapon that shouldn’t be in the hands of someone like Tony Stark, who made a great deal of his wealth off of selling weapons.
“But it wasn’t you Steve,” Tony countered; because Captain America was whatever people wanted him to be. His image was used by all political parties to get what they wanted despite Steve clearly being very liberal in his views, though he still didn’t agree with everything that party stood for. Defining political views and alignments had gotten difficult to the point where Steve just spoke up about what he cared about and believed in and spoke out when people used his image for things he was very clearly against. Using a bisexual man, who was in a relationship with a pansexual man, and who’s best friend in the 30s and 40s had been a gay man though the media didn’t know about that because Steve wasn’t going to out Bucky when he was dead, he didn’t like speaking about Bucky to the masses anyway, as a symbol for homophobic views was not a good idea. Steve had fun trolling those people though and Pepper handled filing lawsuits against those using the image of Captain America to spread hatred.
Steve chuckled.
Tony rambled about how the possibility of Hydra making more super soldiers, as well as the fact that they were facing bigger monsters and sometimes Gods. They needed to be ready for it.
"Meanwhile I'll face Coulson," the boy replied, smiling at the very corner of his mouth, which didn't foretell anything good.
"Won't you stay?" His father was surprised as if he had no idea that he had just destroyed his son's life. No, wait, he really didn't know he did that. "I thought you should get to know each other better. You know, Steve will be visiting us quite often now..."
He has been present in school life since he was eight years old. All because his father funded numerous scholarships, but he never had time to officially award them, which is why Tony, as heir to Stark Industries, had to do it for him. When it turned out that the charming genius boy was doing a greater sensation on galas than a busy middle-aged charmer (and therefore attracts more investors), Howard threw all the duties associated with the SHIELD on his firstborn's shoulders.
"I thought it was a secret project. Why did you let me see who I made these arrows for?"
"Tony, I'm begging you, you have to get up, it's very important."
That is why Stark never intended to have children.
"Steve can."
"I'm fine, I just didn't sleep well. Again. You know how it is…"
"Come in, Anthony," Coulson called. Knowing his obsession with security, he followed Tony's path to his office on all possible cameras deployed throughout the school.
"I do not see the problem."
"So you met Rogers and the others?"
Well, whoever was supposed to be the owner of the arrows, for their own safety, better not shoot at Tony Stark.
"You made it yourself?"
That's why the first thing that struck the boy was the light in his father's office. Howard Stark was at home. Or rather: in this "hotel" in which he rarely visited and his son lived in permanently.
"Should I sniff around the tall and handsome one?" she asked, unnecessarily. The tone of her voice clearly suggested that even if Tony wouldn't want to engage in a relationship with this walking perfection, she would do anything to force him to do so.
"Tony... you know you can't run forever, right?" Rhodey asked, looking up from the book at his friend, who at first glance decided to use the shadow cast by an old maple and take a nap between classes. Well, that's what somebody who doesn't know Tony would think.
"Such an attempt on my precious life?" Tony laughed involuntarily, letting everyone in. It did not escape his notice that Rogers took the opportunity to brush Stark's robe with his hand. No, it was no accident. Yes, he had wonderfully broad shoulders, but he could easily pass Tony at a safe distance. He didn't do it though. "And what will happen to me now? Who will stand up for me?"
"What about Bruce?"
"You probably won't enjoy it, but you will lose your scholarship," Steve finally said, coming closer to him and leaning his hip against the edge of the desk, forcing Tony to look at him. At least he tried to force him, only he didn't succeed. "Fury also suggested confiscating all your... wonderful devices."
"What's so funny about that?" Tony moaned in a pained voice, which finally calmed Rogers.
He laughed so loudly and so honestly that Stark stopped understanding anything at all. Torn from the Rogers' magnetic influence, he jumped from the sofa and tried to escape, but Steve quickly grabbed his wrist and pulled him closer. Tony struggled and pulled away for a moment, but finally gave up.
"So you're assuming Steve doesn't like you?"
The bell rang the first time, then the second. And then again and again. Tony closed his eyes and cursed severely. There was no indication that the kids would let go. Of course not. Damn it, that's why he hated Halloween. Like most of the "warm and family" holidays. Yes, Christmas too.
"I need coffee," he said, feeling cool anger rising in his chest.
Rogers slipped cautiously into the laboratory. It was obvious from his behavior that such a workplace was definitely not his fairy tale, and yet he was not overwhelmed by the enormity of test tubes, microscopes, spectrophotometers, and other devices also as friendly to the average person. He smiled at the sight of Tony and opened his mouth to say something when he saw Banner's grim expression.
"I think it's pretty good because assuming what's in your bag, you brought me a present."
That was what he lacked today. Shit. But it couldn't get worse, could it?
Dummy with his slightly wavering hand first gave a plate with toasts burned into gold to Rogers, and then another one to Tony, thus ending their quasi-conversation. Unfortunately, that was the truth. They had nothing to talk about. Wait, what did Pepper say? Sport, literature, art, Frank Sinatra...?
"I was afraid you might consider me too... forward?"
"Enough, Stark," hissed Steve. Where did his anger come from? It didn't even involve him. "How can you take your life in so lightly?"
"Nice, Steve," Clint laughed as he entered the room. Bruce was right behind him, and they were both laden with shopping. "What will it look like when the pride of our nation, the personification of all virtues will be caught fucking hot seventeen?"
“Yeah...” Steve blinked, a look of dawning realization settling over him. He dropped his eyes and nodded, gradually bringing them both to a standstill. “We do.”
He could feel Bruce’s body shake as he chuckled, stepping back to lightly slap at Tony’s shoulder, “Oh man, I’ve missed having you around.”
“Not until after,” Steve added, “Natasha.”
Silence settled over them, but it was comfortable. Which felt rather weird within itself. Tony felt like he was having an intensely bizarre dream; he felt
feel entirely like himself. His body felt.. drained and weak. Almost as if he were paying the repercussions of not sleeping for days. But aside from that, he was okay. Realistically, he could keep up a conversation. But he feared he might let something sleep in this state of exhaustion.
“Yes.” Steve replied without an ounce of doubt. He had known. But he needed... he had to do something. He may not get a happy ending, but this Steve would. “Changing the past doesn’t change the future. The future remains intact because any changes made in the past only creates a new reality.. a new timeline.”
He began to shakily inhale, the fresh breezy air tickling his face. He had missed– he quickly cut himself off at the sound of feet thundering towards him. He should probably be concerned. His eyebrows shot up in alarm as he glanced up, staggering backwards as a blur of dark material soon engulfed him. His first instinct was Rhodey.
Had he–
Steve’s stomach clenched.
“Hey..” Steve brushed his shoulder against Tony’s. “Bruce explained alternate realities to me earlier.”
His laboratory hadn’t looked like that since..
“Tony.” He breathed, wincing as the taste of metallic copper began to flood his mouth.
The billionaire met his gaze, his eyes swimming with unshed tears. Steve hadn’t met someone more mesmerizing.
He closed his eyes and tried to pretend they weren’t welling up with tears. The feeling in his stomach had continued to grow, he almost felt nauseous. That phrase... it had been echoed so long ago. But not long enough, no. Tony could still feel the wind on his skin. How Steve had looked as Tony peered up at him through his sunglasses.
It was painfully domestic it.
just felt so...
“Suppose I have that to look forward to.”
His eyebrows immediately shot up. Bacon was treated as a delicacy in this household.. Steve only allowed pork on rare occasions. Such as, but not limited to: the time Tony stumbled into the dark kitchen and promptly yelled after seeing Bucky sitting on the counter eating melon in the dark, when Steve had ripped Tony’s lab door off its hinges at the brunet’s outcry, which had been of
But this was
The billionaire nodded, albeit jerkily.
“Steve.” Tony’s face stepped into his line of sight, his head hovering over Steve’s own in concern. “What do you remember last?”
Tony let out a short laugh, his brows disappearing into his hairline at the bizarreness of the situation; but he agreed nonetheless. It was a no brainer. The two had been through hell and back together; there was absolutely nothing Tony wouldn’t trust Steve with.
“But then what would that make you?”
“Still, cleaning those things is already more of a chore than it should be and I don’t even want to think about how difficult cleaning up jizz will be. And I’m not explaining those stans to anyone else.”
“On your knees,” Steve ordered when Tony was naked, and again Tony obeyed.
He didn’t realise that he had been crying and it felt like he blacked out for a second because somehow Tony was now in front of him and the ropes had been untied.
With that confession sleep was put off for a round of sex first because all Steve could think about was how hot the image of his shield, the symbol of Captain America, covered in Tony’s cum was.
“Do it. Captain’s orders,” Steve managed to huff out, already so close. The second orgasm always came faster than the first but this was unreal. Then again, how could he not cum almost instantly when Tony was pretty much fucking the symbol of Captain America. What would the public say if they found out? Steve knew better than to entertain the idea and was glad he didn’t have his phone on him.
“Ain’t that right Cap? Too uptight to give Tony what he really wants. What he needs.”
He feels Steve’s hand’s cup his face, one hand runs up into his hair while the other wraps around the back of his neck.
He still loved Steve though, he couldn’t deny that.
When Steve noticed his cock threatening to get hard he should have called it off but he didn’t. There wouldn’t have been a way to explain why he suddenly needed to leave and Tony didn’t have anyone else to train with since Hulk had been used recently so Bruce was recovering and Thor was sorting out business in Asgard.
He should have known that inviting Rhodey to the team movie night was a bad idea.
Steve could tell that something was eating at Tony but he also knew it was best to let Tony be the one to bring it up.
“Many have tried.”
Point being, Captain America was a symbol, anyone could pick up the shield, but no one else could be Steve Rogers.
There was something about the suit though. The way it captured Tony’s essence. Steve was an artist so he noticed things like that, even if Tony hadn’t done any of it intentionally.
“Strip,” Steve ordered and Tony looked at him, feigning confusion.
Things were perfects as they were. He watched as Tony’s back arched and cum spilt from his cock, coating the shield. It didn’t take long for Steve to cum, trying his best not to close his eyes because all he wanted to see was Tony but he let them fall shut for a moment as he shook with pleasure.
Steve tries to break free from the rope tying him to the chair but Tony wasn’t lying when he said that this stuff couldn’t be broken by super-soldiers. It was impressive, how far Tony had come in his inventions from when they had first met and was struggling to make handcuffs that would hold up against Steve’s strength.
“You know patience is a virtue Stark,” Steve said, his voice more affirmative. The Captain America voice was something Tony had heard first hand, a lot of the time directed at him, but he’d never heard it with a hint of lust before.
Tony had forgiven Steve for the whole ‘Civil War’ thing.
“Guess I’ll have to teach you.”
Steve was completely blindsided by his orgasm, cumming with a silent moan. He legs spasmed with how forceful his orgasm was and he could only just hear the sloppy sound of his hand jerking him though his orgasm through the white almost static-like noise in his brain.
The sofa is worse.
He thought for a moment and then, slowly, "Does it concern Jarvis?"
Tony looks down and is met with darkness.
Come the next page, the human shapes are replaced by drawings of landscapes and animals. There are snow-clad mountains that look similar to those around them, a lake covered in ice, paw prints embedded in the snow on top of it. A swarm of snow geese and a single moose, its mighty antlers held high.
Tony thrashes against the ropes, going from pulling to glancing between them and Steve’s towering figure with a wide-eyed desperation, a plea that for a moment makes Steve consider thinking his intentions over. But then his gaze falls onto the marks in Tony’s right arm once more, the blood dried and crusted over but poisoning the rest of his body the same as before. He has to. It's the only way.
Steve is slicking up his prick, red and perfectly curved up his stomach, while Tony grabs the spare pillow next to him and pushes it underneath himself to elevate his hips (they'll be sure to complain anyway, but he couldn't care less).
Steve opens his mouth to argue, but Fury holds up a hand to silence him before there are any words spoken, and he begrudgingly follows suit.
Steve dreamed of getting out. Then, the experiments finally bore fruit.
Tony regards his naked counterpart in the mirror with a disgruntled look as Steve mouths a sensitive spot at his throat, leaving wet patches where he's laved over the skin with his tongue.
In the archway, a renewed whirl of sand and light begins to form a picture unlike all the others before. Two magenta-colored silhouettes of light, only distantly reminding of people, wound so tightly around one another they almost appear as one.
After James' last return to Mar'vill, many long months passed.
married to Anthony Stark – and avoided having to be asked further questions.
Sleep takes him soon after, and it comes with a feeling of alleviation.
Return? Tony meets Steve's befuddled look with one of his own.
Mealtime comes. Tony knows better than to wolf the food down at once; instead, he picks it apart piece by piece.
The streak of red kicks loose an avalanche of unexplained need within Steve, its sight beautifully striking. He approaches the man, who rolls over and shuffles away like he can smell his intentions the way prey sniffs out a predator in the air.
a super-soldier's daughter."
Steve sees it in himself to take upon the responsibility of breaking the shell-shocked silence. The body is still there, and somebody's going to have to move.
"Take it easy," the same someone tells him, and Tony feels like he should be able to put a name to the voice by now. Afterwards, there is a hand underneath his head, tilting his face upward. Something is pressed to his mouth and Tony parts his lips, more out of reflex than in a deliberate action. Warm liquid spills into his mouth and Tony swallows it greedily, relishing the feeling of it soothing his raw throat. He almost whines in protest when it's taken away again, but only almost. There may not be much pride left within him, but he won't stoop down that low if he can help it.
"You got it, doc."
To both their dismay, the following years proved trying to their friendship, with their lives so deeply interwoven yet so far apart. The troubling times would only aid their bond to become stronger, however; in the end, they saw there was no helping the fact that they were not boys anymore.
They rode out early in the morning, only stopping for a brief rest, and had been trotting along a tranquil creek in comfortable silence for a while before Lord Rhodes found it in him to speak up again.
Steve looks at the clock again. Five minutes past four. Their appointment is in three hours.
The words die in his throat when he steps through the doorway to the kitchen, swaying a little as his legs cease their movement on the spot and he comes to an abrupt halt.
No answer seems to be answer enough for him, because he takes on a more defensive stance, crossing his arms over his chest as he steps a few feet away from the table and the holograms.
"No," he answers curtly, bringing the axe down on another log in the same uncompromising manner he has just rejected Tony's suggestion. He doesn't even have the common courtesy of looking at him.
Tony allows the dark n  e    s     s          t
Screamed and cried and suffered he might have, but it had not been for nothing.
It's dark.
"Sir Steven Grant Rogers, it is my personal honor as the 12th Lord Stark of Mar'vill, to hereby name you Commander of the Iron Guard and every man–" the woman next to him shot him a narrow-eyed look, "uh, person in the Far Lands who has pledged allegiance to me and my name."
There's also Steve's dick, which is still plugging him up and the message here is crystal as well:
Tony contemplates forcing his eyes open just to be able to roll his eyes at Steve in the mirror, but finds he's too lazy to. Instead, he scoffs, unable to stifle the faintest trace of a fond smile. “Shut up. I already said you won this round, don’t push it."
The mattress dips behind him. Tony tightens his hold around the pillow and mumbles some garbled sounds into the stuffing he hopes communicates his disgruntlement to whoever pulled him back into consciousness. Is this how Steve feels when Tony keeps his ungodly hours? He should know best to be more quiet, then.
Fairy dust; right. He is in a gay relationship, so societal stereotypes dictate that he should be able to manage at least something vaguely glitter-related. He can be damn glamorous if he wants to. Maybe he'll put a glitter dispenser into the suit and then whenever he's doubting his role in this relationship or angry at himself for letting himself go or just generally disgruntled about his momentary state of being – maybe then he can shoot a cloud of pretend fairy dust and it'll all be gone just like–
"You got 'em?"
mutual, but their coupling was a means to an end, nothing more. If Stark was conscious and in his right mind – well, he wouldn’t want him getting any more up close than necessary either.
Steve lifts an eyebrow in question, still looking at him as his mouth makes its way up his chest again, nibbling at the skin with a hint of teeth while Tony does his best to respond without letting that gasp at the tip of his tongue slip out.
"Tony?" he asks, sleep-addled. A front. He knows what he's doing. "Are you–?"
Tony swears, angrily but also in desperation, as leaves the immediate vicinity of the fire. He's stumbling more than he's walking, his erection making every step a hassle. Finally, he turns back around, eyes wide and paranoid as he guesses at the distance between him and the camp.
him and it's been a near decade in which he hasn't regretted either of those things and he sure as shit won't start now.
Tony presses the curve of his ass back against Steve’s dick, with purpose this time.
The words are a magic spell that possesses him to tell the truth. In one smooth motion, he draws himself up taller, squares his shoulders. He draws in a deep breath and his right hand flexes by his side. Ready: for battle, to kill or be killed.
On the two of them, because Tony isn’t alone in his body anymore. Hasn't been for a while.
Yeah. He better.
So too was this feast an opportunity, and the young ladies who'd come chaperoned by their fathers, uncles or brothers received their share of adoration from the Lord as well, no more and no less.
Rogers hasn't noticeably gone out of his way to keep its contents secret, but Tony can definitely sense that this is something private, that there is a certain protectiveness he feels toward it. It means that in one way or another, there'll be answers in this book. Answers about this man who is so peculiar in the way he locks everything away behind a face that seems to know only the matter of fact. Answers Tony
"Whatever you're thinking, Tony, stop. Please," he says, voice very quiet and strikingly level in a way that betrays that there's emotion there that he has locked away somewhere within.

“What a surprise! Sir Rogers, is it not? I believe darling Lucia had things to say about you as well,” he smiled, teeth flashing like a vulture eyeing its prey. A warning – one which the knight wholeheartedly ignored.
despite his best efforts to be gentle. Maybe Steve would even come, at some point, and Tony wouldn't get to because the only way he'd be allowed would be if he got off from just a cock in his ass.
Maria comes into the room sliding over the floor on her socks. She only escapes an imminent collision with the coffee table by the skin of her teeth, breath a little labored as she comes to a standstill and looks at him questioningly.
His fingers squeeze around the space above Tony’s hips; it’s that soft place where the hint of love handles comes in when he’s not lying down.
"I have some idea," Tony sneers, waving the journal in front of him demonstratively. The laugh that escapes him is sharp, and he can tell it leaves an incision from the way Steve takes a faltering, almost involuntary step back. "Am I supposed to be flattered by this? Do you think this is–"
Tony groans a choked-off noise into his mouth. The pitch of it leaves Steve suspecting it to be a sound of pain rather than pleasure, so he aborts his movement and pulls out gently, patting Tony’s flank soothingly when the other man protests and shoots him a disgruntled look over his shoulder.
His heartbeat spikes, cold sweat making his skin itch underneath his clothes that have grown stiff with cold. Tony swallows. There are tears of angry frustration stinging in his eyes. He yells, maybe in desperation, in the naive hope that someone will hear, but there is no answer.
It seems to come back to him in a flash. Steve could swear he sees it, how something stirs in the dark pools of his eyes and documents the awakening of the memories in his mind, sudden like lightning that strikes and leaves behind only charred earth. And burnt bridges.
is here and the realization that he’s never had the power to stop it from coming, no matter how many hits (bites) he took in Tony’s stead, no matter how much he strategized and pushed and fought for the right to patrol the perimeter while Tony remained sheltered in their hideout.
Tony's walls squeeze around him, his hands curled into fists over his thighs. Steve feels him trembling against him. Evidently, not only being made to sit still but having no choice but to listen
, it did its little magic trick and spit you back out in Tony Stark's backyard? Not, as one might assume, in at least the vicinity of the place it originally took you from?"
Tony throws up in his stead, what little food they shared emptied out in front of him. Steve swallows the bile back down when he feels it coming, ignoring the burn down his throat.
At Tony’s incredulous eyebrow-raise, Steve trails off. The man laughs quietly to himself, rubbing his neck. “Pepper, huh? Good to know that worked out for one of us, I guess,” he says, the words directed more at himself than at Steve.
With tears in his eyes and the residual power in his suit that is nothing more than a helmet, Tony records messages. The last one is for Steve, and he talks and talks until he’s given voice to every last trace of anger and bitterness left within him, and everything that remains is longing for a love lost or maybe never even had. Tony doesn’t know. Tony would just like to be held a final time, and that might be enough to send him on to the next place in relative peace.
Peter did not seem convinced, but dropped his objections nevertheless and waited to wave them off when they left.
Yet, it was difficult to imagine that the man thought him capable to take his place one day. The prospect seemed otherworldly, almost.
Her efforts did not go unnoticed. Sir Rhodes approached her after an afternoon's session of training, inquiring about her knowledge of what a well-equipped armory was to hold. She found this to be curious, as the man knew quite well of all her knowledge, but she recited the requirements she believed to be of highest importance still.
Everything is slow and muted. His throat is dry to the point it's painful, but there is no saliva in his mouth he could swallow. Tony smacks his lips and groans, a sharp, rough sound that startles even himself. He sounds like a dying animal; maybe because he is one.
And then it’s over.
That’s when the ships arrive.
Tony has to look twice when they halt on a small elevation and the land below shows a sight that doesn't fit in with the rest, that is testament to man's intervention: a herd of roughly fifty cows, their brown and black coats standing out amidst the bright landscape.
But they need him, too. They need Tony. (And God, Steve does, but that’s of little importance compared to what’s at stake.)
There's something about the deep of the night that is more intimate here. Everything is still and swallowed by darkness but for the patch of land where they have set up camp, illuminated by the crackling fire. From nightfall until daybreak, the world is condensed to this small, freezing speck of earth, and they're the only people in it. Everything could happen here, and none of it would ever leave these mountains.
"I feel like I'm talking to a wall," he croaks through a cough. "Steve. You came onto me, right here. Then you came
Steve nods in understanding and he leaves the sentence unfinished, instead turning to exit the room. The wooden steps creak under his weight as he makes his way up the stairs, and then it’s silent.
so that's on me."

. It's so incredibly fitting, so telling of how Tony spent the last fifteen years of his life, and the way Pepper cradles it within her hands before placing it on the wreath talks of nothing but love and devotion for the man who traded his life for that of humanity.
"Didn't think you'd still cry," Steve says, dragging a thumb along Stark's bottom eyelid until a drop of liquid seeps out, like squeezed from a ripe fruit. "But look at you now."
just a little something more because the image popped up in my head one day and wouldn't go away (and i really need to stop thinking about it).
The natural opioid had performed remarkably well, lulling the man into a state of mind that left him much less receptive to pain. His eyes were drooping close every now and then, lips curving into a lazy smile when Bruce pat his shoulder in passing and declared the procedure over.
Finally, two of the
So, he's never actively, truly sought to escape the hold Steve had on him. Not even when he was in the thick of it, with searing rage and piercing betrayal feeding a bottomless pit in the depths of his stomach. Maybe that should be a worrying bout of self-reflection, but Tony really doesn't have the energy to worry about the deeper intricacies of their falling out or his own lack of self-preservation instincts. There's greater things on the line now. (He tries not to think about the possibility that their fight might very well have been the catalyst of their collective failure.)
It's wrong to get attached this quickly, especially when that attachment doesn't stop at amicable companionship. Tony stomps out the feeling before it can take hold.
Tony remembers vividly: asking him to sign, one last time. Presenting him with Howard's pen. A peace offering, an olive branch. One last chance to resolve the mess they’d created in a civilised manner.
Since Thanos left the compound nothing but a hole in the ground, the Avengers temporarily relocate to an office complex somewhere off Long Island. The space is bleak and the opposite of optimal for their use, but it'll have to do.
In a while, the mess between his legs will become too uncomfortable to ignore, and they’ll have to move. Steve will push the bed back to its initial place, they’ll change the covers, and the mirror will still be there, and Tony’s still going to pass it every once in a while and inevitably think about the various imperfections that will have caught his eye at a moment's notice.
He dreams of Tony.
"You's the other one?"
When Steve hands it over to him, Stark cradles the sachet to his chest with both his bound hands (they haven’t gotten rid of the restraints but switched them to the front for convenience's sake) like it’s precious and then pulls it open to count the individual pieces inside. Finally, he blows out a relieved breath and directs his attention back to Steve, bag still clutched tight in his fist.
Outside, people are already up and about when he wakes to find Stark rubbing off on his morning wood. Right. Last night was not, in fact, a very vivid sexual fantasy. Might’ve fooled him.
He doesn't remember every being addressed this directly by the girl.

Bruce did not doubt Anthony's love for the animals; he did, however, doubt that the man had at any point been graced with the aptitude or tact that made for a good rider.
At the first touch, Steve tenses. He squeezes around Tony's fingers as if to ask whether he's sure and when Tony returns the gesture, his posture relaxes momentarily and he receives a grateful smile. After a bout of unnerving silence, Steve is the first to speak up.
i did indeed fuck around with the civil war/infinity war timeline just to milk this for the maximum amount of angst.
There's only one time he and Steve had gotten intimate while the whole mess with the Accords was going down and so there’s no doubt when it happened.
When he first sees the blurry shape of a person floating outside of the ship, Tony thinks she’s an angel. He realizes he’s mistaken when his vision clears and there’s a fierce look in her eyes and a tension in her jaw that reminds him–stupidly–of Steve.
Tony blows out a breath and rubs his forehead as if he's just remembering the headache pounding behind his temples.
nightmares away. Except now– now there's nobody left. Not if Tony rejects him entirely, not if this world's Avengers don't feel comfortable welcoming a different version of
Steve drops the glass, his fingers spasming and letting loose like his muscles have forgotten how to function in those two seconds it takes him to realize who's disrupted his nightly kitchen raid. The sound accompanying its untimely demise when it shatters on the floor is loud in the otherwise deadly silent room.
He leans forward on his elbows, hands clasped tightly. Here they go again.
The physician had jumped from his seat the very moment the door swung open and was on his way to assess the situation.
It doesn’t feel like winning when the price paid for victory is this immense.
"I am, too," he adds, a little out of breath not because of physical exertion but because Steve's practically shoving the air out of him with increasingly powerful thrusts. "I am–ah–beautiful. Like you said. I am, I–look so good underneath you, Steve, baby, God, I wish I could–" his breath hitches, "–see where you're fucking me open, I bet it's even hotter from up there, isn't it?"
The next, Steve did something he'd wanted to do from the beginning; the picture in front of his inner eye alone almost managed to get him off.
They've had these damned stones for hours now, and nobody even
Someone’s stomach grumbles at the approximate volume of an approaching freight train, and Tony is promptly reminded that them not going out for dinner also meant missing out on a scheduled intake of sustenance, which has gone far from unnoticed by Steve’s metabolism–especially considering their most recent activities.
The next morning, Tony stirs awake when Steve slips out of bed.
“’s good?”
Of course Steve's upset.
Steve takes his cock from Tony's hand and puts a steadying hand on his hip as he navigates it between his cheeks. The sensation of it dragging over his already irritated skin is good and familiar, grounding while also making both his stomach and hole flutter in anticipation. Tony manages to wait until the head has caught onto his rim, and then he lets himself glide down without any further ado. The sudden intrusion comes with a distant, familiar ache that Tony refuses to pay any mind. He hears Steve's breath stutter and moans in relief as he finally comes to sit fully in the other man's lap.
Tony's closest family has gathered around him by now, Pepper leaning close and speaking quiet words, her face full of grief but as controlled as can be. A soft-spoken goodbye for a man on the brink between this world and the next.
Looking for leverage, Tony goes for Steve's thighs that are still encircling him and tries to heave himself completely into Steve's lap. Despite the bewildered stare Tony feels boring into him, Steve, bless his soul, doesn't question the change of pace. He lifts Tony up by the waist and closes his legs so Tony can settle on top of him, knees on either side.
“Where do you keep the Kronole?”
“Steve,
Tony knows what's coming, but the sound of the second shot still causes him to wince. Without another look at him or the carcass, Rogers heads back to camp.
"Tony–"
is not havin’ to carry a damn corpse off this mountain. You need to take it easy, you’re in withdrawal.”
He can’t do this.
"I'll go and see if I can get a hold of Fury," he announces, shifting his weight from one foot to the other.
"Is it your stable boy?"
Daylight wanes, and the shadows of the falling night begin to cling to every stone and every tree and every turn in the path before him. Behind every corner, every elevation, the trail keeps stretching onward.
One of the few Lords to join the fight in person, Anthony rode into battle next to James that day, armor plated in gold and red fire that stood out against his knights’ steel-blue like a beacon in the dark.
Steve snaps his hips forward a fraction harder. His next thrust comes at a curious angle, which has Stark giving a full-body twitch and his eyes rolling into the back of his head. The moan spills over his lips like boiling water from a kettle that’s been simmering for too long, and Steve feels warm validation pooling in his gut right alongside the already pleasant arousal.
He tells Steve as much, who snorts and then asks, a little apprehensively, if that’s an actual example from his past. Tony only winks at him, and that’s enough to spur him into action–maybe to prove that he can make Tony feel that way all by himself. That little possessive streak he gets sometimes is more attractive than it has any right to be.
, the yellow dwarf they hold so dear that is nothing in comparison. He wishes he’d get to see it one more time, feel the heat of it on a warm summer day. He wishes for a lot of things; to take a walk in Central Park. Eat a hotdog. Go ice-skating. Smile. Drive too fast. Hear DUM-E greet him with an excited beep. Hug Rhodey. Kiss Steve again.
Later, Tony gets into the shower and washes off the confusion alongside yesterday’s sweat. There’s rarely a time the whole team is around the tower at the same time, and he’s looking forward to spending the obligatory movie night with them. Refreshed, he hums a little tune as he dries himself off.
Tony makes another attempt at opening his eyes, and is met with success this time around. His vision is still somewhat blurred, the outlines of objects in it foggy and blending into one another, but he can identify his surroundings now. The soft glow emanating from the fire crackling in front of him drenches the room in orange shadows. Tony knows that sight and has drifted off to sleep in the cabin many times prior to the sound of it. Only now, he finds himself closer to the fire on the floor, above multiple layers of blankets.
Tony only rumbles a soft ‘
"Yes."
Finally, he moves to follow Tony’s example–and halts in his movement.
Tony does need. More than ever, he needs, and he thinks it might be his undoing no matter whether he acts upon it or not. Need and want are two words that have little in common, though, and damn him if he wants Steve here, after everything. He doesn’t.
A while later, they halted on top of a slight elevation, looking down upon the great expanse of green fields and willow trees below. "Thank you," Anthony said, his voice subdued. It would be the last they would speak of the matter for a long time.
A woman gets crushed underneath an airborne car, so he gives knockoff squidward a taste of his own medicine. Peter decides to take a ride on the alien ship, so Tony follows. They meet a guy from Missouri who calls himself
It's going to be a long day.
The Captain uttered a choked noise that only barely resembled a laugh.
"You're beautiful."
It was only after many tedious bouts of defamatory talk later that the woman's interest was piqued again. Lord Hammer had not once allowed his cup of wine stay empty, his calls for refills growing harsher and more and more inarticulate as the evening progressed. (The servants were truly being tested for all their patience and willpower that day.)
Molten metal burns through his skin, meat and bone, shoots up his arm and into his heart. His chest contracts on impact, an almost unbearable pain that hits so suddenly it makes him gasp out loud.
Although the choice of words was insulting and infuriating, it was then that the pieces clicked into place. Natalia was not left with much time to contemplate this revelation about the resident Lord, as someone caused commotion at the end of the dining table.
It’s a helpless, livid hysteria that seems like the brain’s natural response to the prospect of losing (part of) a limb, of being taken apart, brutalized so entirely against one’s will. Steve knows it’s something horrible to put a person through, and even if Tony pulls through, the look of utter betrayal in his eyes is something Steve thinks he’ll never be able to fully atone or stop hating himself for.
“I know what you really want, and that’s not some omega to hand around a few times until he turns all sloppy and glassy-eyed. No,” he drags in a breath and points at Steve, finger just shy of touching his chest, “
"Looks like discount Hellboy here is telling the truth," Tony says through a sigh, clasping his hands. "I checked every nook and cranny, scans don't produce any viable results. There's nothing. No hidden passages, no secret stashes, not even a
There’s the hint of a growl in his voice and Tony falls silent within an instant. Loathing prickles underneath his skin, scorching hot. If there’s one thing he’s sworn to himself he'd never do, it’s shut his mouth at some old bastard’s command who thinks the α on his birth certificate puts him above Tony by default.
"That alright?" Steve asks quietly. Quiet and–worried? Tony squints at him in the mirror, his vision blurry. It's with a rather large portion of dread that Tony touches a hand to his face, more heat crawling up his neck as soon as he feels his fingers coming away wet.
He gulps, notices his outburst, and collects himself. Defeat lines his suddenly slumped shoulders. When his eyes meet hers again, he's pleading. “Just–the stone, Wanda, please. We can't take the chance."
, he holds onto the arc reactor – holds and guards it like he's never done Tony's heart enough. During the worst of nights, it seems to be the only thing tethering him to reality.
don't think i have to say this, but the non-con tag still very much applies.
His smile is broad and fond despite the devious edge there is to it. "Oh, no. I want you to stay right here, look pretty and listen to me."
This will be then. Now he just wants a taste of what's to come.
So the decision was made. He nodded to pretend he still had any control over his life.
They needed a comfortable spot where Banner and Barton could recover and the rest of the parties had a serious conversation. Unluckily, the Stark estate turned out to be the most convenient place. And if that wasn't enough, this time Howard Stark chose to be at home for a moment. And that meant that Tony couldn't participate in the "adult's chat".
Stark eyed the blush that crawled on Rogers' cheeks. He couldn't answer it. "Indeed, it turned out ridiculous. I wanted to sleep with you and you chose my father." Embarrassing. He just nodded his head as a sign of accepting an apology.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was better to think about Banner and his radiation.
For several painfully long hours, he tried to get to work and then just to fall asleep. He couldn't do one or the other. He only thought about what he saw in his father's office, what must have happened before he came, and what might have happened after he fled. The awareness of how unpredictable his father was in relationships didn't help at all. He couldn't be happy that his father would get bored of Steve one day, because that would mean that those perfect blue eyes would be filled with sadness every time they meet as if Tony was guilty of what had happened.
"You can come in, Steve!" Bruce called. He really didn't know what was happening to Stark? And apparently, he also was a genius...
"Well, well, Bruce! Am I mistaken or are you radiating?"
"Yes, but I will need one of the school lanterns."
"If you want to act like that, then this theory will eventually become true," Barton growled.
"I just do not want..."
Clint didn't think much about his moves, many years of practice prevailed over reason. As soon as Tony appeared in sight, Barton aimed the arrow at him, activated it and fired. Contrary to his expectations, the arrow didn't go towards the new antagonist and didn't incapacitate him.
Tony frowned, not quite understanding what his friend meant. It took him a moment to realize that this young god was not alone. He was followed by the most unpleasant duo that Stark ever saw. It was not that they were ugly; on the contrary, they were quite attractive. There was just something murderous about them, both in the girl with fiery hair and in the boy with the eyes of the bird of prey.
"Steeevee! Can you come to my office?" Howard called at that moment, without even going back into the kitchen.
Tony managed to avoid another awkward question only because they arrived at the door of Coulson's office (thank God for Coulson, once again). They knocked and went inside.
"Give Rogers one more chance. I don't know what he did to you, but I think it's worth..."
"Please, not Clint, let his name not be Clint!" Stark cursed, and said aloud:
The headmaster decided to grab the bull by the horns because instead of scolding him for acting like they were really close in the school corridor, he put his arm around Tony like a best friend would and tried to pull him by the tongue:
Tony stuffed all purchased tablets into his open mouth and flew off as soon as possible to Coulson, who was just dealing with Barton.
Tony behind their backs called them trolls, but the annoyance over such a turn of events was overcome by the joy that shy and alienated Bruce found a new friend.
"It's about project A.
That Bruce Banner would spend his free afternoon in the laboratory was certain, as well as the fact that Tony would stay with him until O-fuck-it-is-already-so-late ?! That's why it was completely dark when Happy drove the young genius to his family estate.
Tony could feel the heat pulsing perfectly through the thin material, so he didn't have to ask what Steve meant. He didn't answer him; instead, he began to rub against him. Steve immediately understood his intention and began to help him. Their bodies began to tremble slightly and vibrate, and then pressed on in a rush of pleasure.
Coulson just nodded. Tony wasn't sure how he should interpret it, but it might have been worse. At least Banner began to recover. With each passing moment, he was becoming less and less green and calmer, and finally, as an ordinary, beloved, completely harmless Bruce, he began to snore quietly. They were about to cover him with a blanket when a helicopter landed on the square outside the school.
Shit.
"You just have to promise me one thing," Rogers began very seriously. Tony felt chills of excitement running down his back. He nodded slowly, fearing the answer and at the same time looking forward to it. "You mustn't stain or rip my costume."
"Yes, Master Stark."
The question caught him off guard, as did what he found in the kitchen. Or rather who. He thought about the roller skates so much that he didn't notice that his father was in the room. And that he was not alone.
It was his young god, this walking perfection, his knight in shining armor. From the waist up, completely naked, without socks, as if he had just pulled on his pants, all wet and sticky from something shiny, with blue spots running along the ribs.
"Maybe Bruce should stay here?" Stark suggested. "You know, it will be easier to react when he starts to turn green again."
"Are you saying that you left the children unattended and at that time you were with..."
The biometric panel was burned out, but skillfully enough that the rest of the lock was intact. Whoever did this, knew his stuff. And he apparently knew all the passwords. Probably, if it hadn't been for the damaged image, neither Pepper nor Tony would have noticed signs of burglary any time soon.
"They had to just arrive. I will go greet them. Maybe I will drop them at Coulson and show them around the school right away,” Rhodey called enthusiastically, abandoned the book and ran toward the new students. Nothing unusual; after all, who would like to read "History-of-weapons-and-military-just-another-bland-edition"?
Tony had for a long time considered that sooner or later he would have to bring Coulson something that would satisfy him. He had a few such gadgets prepared in his studio, so it was enough to pick up the better ones (of course together with the manual) and take them to the dear headmaster's office.
"Director Fury, we have a serious problem," Coulson's voice sounded even more somber than usual. In the background, something could be heard between the wild yelling and screaming, the sounds of shots and demolished buildings. "Some green monster broke into the school grounds and completely destroyed Banner's laboratory. Hawkeye tries to stop him, but no type of arrow can hurt that beast much. On the contrary, he is getting more and more enraged with each passing minute, and we can't find Banner anywhere. We need support."
Long live the monitoring!
"Should I make improvements?" Tony asked in a matter-of-fact tone.
"What other people?" he pressured.
"So, listen," Pepper began, finally getting to Tony, hidden in the shadow of his favorite tree. "His name is Steve Rogers, he is twenty-one years old and he has the rank of captain, he grew up in Brooklyn, he likes sport, literature, old films, Frank Sinatra and painting. There is no girlfriend, and although several candidates have already applied, he has no interest, so maybe there is a chance..."
Ah, this disgust on his grim face! Wonderful! Tony loved to speak by name to all adults who did not dare to forbid him for his father's sake. Especially those who hated it. And especially Coulson.
"I really can't believe you are doing this," Rhodey laughed as soon as he heard that the large suitcase Tony had brought to school was meant for Coulson.
Tony probably would not notice too many of the changes that took place in his life (or rather at his house), if not for the fact that, unfortunately, came the time of Christmas holidays, which meant few weeks off from school. He couldn't even count on the support of Rhodey and Pepper because they both went abroad with their parents. Lucky. He would also like to go as far as possible, but he was afraid to leave his home in the hands of this band of weirdos who proudly called themselves "The Avengers".
"I'm so sorry. He's terribly introverted and has problems dealing with new people."
He flew over to Clint and called out:
A very simple plan.
"That's not true," Steve snorted. "If that were the case, you would try to discourage me from your father, while you, at all costs, wanted to discourage me from yourself. It doesn't make sense, Tony."
"You should apologize, anyway."
"Popcorn and Star Trek?" For a moment Tony was afraid that he turned the wrong street. After all, the kids at the time rather didn't like such movies. And even if, the date of production was usually enough to discourage them eventually.
"I just preferred you didn't like me right away than you liked me first and then hated me because of my father."
"I don't have candy, yes," Tony began, desperately searching for any hooking point. Something that makes them all stop and then allows him to drag the naive hero into his cave of evil and debauchery. "But that doesn't mean you have to leave empty-handed, doesn't it?"
Funny, but if he had to do his father's work, he was old enough even when he was eight. Why did he suddenly need a parent now? After all, everything went great and nobody was hurt, right?
He felt sick.
...he began to laugh.
There was nothing further from the truth.
"Why do you always twist everything around?" groaned Barton. "You are the first person who just decided to cross him out. Why don't you even want to try to be his friend?"
At least that was all he could do for his favorite bodyguard.
"Happy looked after them. They also had popcorn and my collection of Star Trek episodes. See? I'm responsible."
"And what will you do about it, Phil? Will you eliminate me?" Tony laughed, but he quickly realized it was true. They'll do it if he sniffs too much and produces too little weapon.
Another strange discovery was that Natalie Rushman was actually Natasha Romanov, a world-class assassin wanted for numerous crimes, who got from the SHIELD her last chance to return to the light side of the force. For the first couple of days, after bringing this information to light, Tony tried to avoid it, but he couldn't do it for too long. She discovered his weakness for sweets and began to bake muffins every day, which made him turn a blind eye to her past.
"You know, everyone said you were easy and rich, so I thought: why not?"
Pepper and Rhodey looked at him in horror. It wasn't his father's behavior that worried them, just how Tony would handle it. Well, it wasn't the first time he was after a sleepless night, so it couldn't be that bad.
What kind of project was it? After all, Rhodey was on a military scholarship, and he absolutely didn't resemble any of them. Not to mention Steve, with his...
"Pepper, just check the records and..."
He knew that the relationship with Steve would look completely different. He had no reason for that certainty, and yet he simply knew. It didn't change the fact that Steve was painfully out of reach.
He glanced at the screen, mentally prepared for the worst.
"I'll have to call your parents," Steve said it hesitantly, but there was a sense in his voice that he was almost convinced by Tony. He smiled again and ruffled the boy's hair. Stark felt a strange tap at his sternum at the scene. He never liked children. He hated even being around them. This carefree and affectionate gesture reminded him of Jarvis, who desperately tried to raise Tony as a good man, and a father who never made the effort to even try... "Nobody minds? Tony?"
Tony smiled broadly. He knew he was handsome. He knew that many men wanted him, regardless of their sexual orientation. And yet he felt extremely insecure with the sweet soldier. It was as if Steve undressed him with his eyes only, carefully analyzed his sex appeal, contemplated the complexes hidden under his skin. Stark swallowed nervously. The silence lengthened so much that he began to expect a refusal.
"Yes."
A very nice change after fainting and shouting: "There are ghosts! This kitchen is haunted!"
"Oh, and I wanted to make some improvements to the armor." Prepare everything, I'll be there in a minute."
Could it be true? Or maybe it just seemed to him?
Oh, so he was the one that was something wrong with? So getting into an affair with someone for whom you might as well be a father is completely normal? Damn it!
"Tony?"
"Tony is Howard's son."
This clumsy explanation was interrupted by knocking on the door. Damn! Why did he have to be everywhere, so Tony wasn't even able to forget him? Why did it have to be him in the first place?
"More improvements? I thought it was ready."
"Sorry, Stark," Clint croaked as soon as he caught his breath. "I misjudged you. You are quite neat."
"I'm afraid I'm not on Santa's good boy's list."
Oh, wonderful. So the fact that the jacket was male didn't mean that it wasn't his father's new toy. All in all, Tony shouldn't be surprised by that. This is not the first time his father has changed his orientation so that it suited his mood.
"Why?" he asked, and after a while he added in a more suspicious tone, narrowing his eyes. "Where's the catch?"
"How do you do that?" asked Clint. Tony looked at him clueless. "How can you be... You know. Rogers-proof."
He focused his attention on remembering Rogers's face, his blue eyes and golden hair. Damn, he was so kitschy that it hurt. And to think that Tony got caught up in it. He couldn't let it go, however. He had to get every detail out of the darks of his memory. They had no recordings, so the description was the only...
"I'm grateful to you, Rogers," he said slowly, feeling his heart breaking again. "But a debt of gratitude is not the same as friendship."
But not this time.
"I was needed alive, so, if you didn't notice, Rogers, my life wasn't in danger," Tony snapped. "Besides, my life is absolutely not your business."
"Natalie and Steve..." To drown out his possible refusal, Pepper switched to machine-gun mode. "We also wanted to get Clint and Bruce, but Bruce has some super-secret, super-important project to finish, and Clint has some watch to handle. I asked him if David and Pamela will be there and he had no idea what I meant! Can you imagine? When did he grow up? So what, Tony? Are you going?"
"Master Stark, Mr. Banner's life is in serious danger."
And if it's not Christmas, just have a nice day ;)
"I've always wanted to try with someone younger."
He wrapped himself tightly in a soft red bathrobe and slid slippers onto his wrinkled feet. His evening set lacked only toast baked with white cheese and honey and hot cocoa. And that meant Tony had to go on a terribly long journey to the kitchen.
"Since I made it myself, I can use it for what I want."
Tony sat down immediately and looked at his favorite assistant with unconscious eyes. Pepper Potts was a really amazing woman and none of his previous assistants had reached her level of awesomeness. Neither one of them was able to win Tony's friendship, much less permission to enter his house at any time of day or night. Stark knew she wasn't kidding. She was clearly worried, her pupils were dilated, her hands were shaking, her breathing was quick. She clearly had no idea what else she should say.
The position of the furniture allowed him to see into the other chamber if he just leaned to the side a small bit.
"Gonna make you take it, Tony." The words come out in time with his movements, hard and in increments, again and again, his hips pistoning back and forth. "'m gonna give you all of me and you're going to take it."
They're so close to succeeding, so close to walking away from this planet as one–but no plan can account for blind rage. (Tony thinks he's heard that one before.)
Maybe. Probably. Then again, you know what they say about hindsight; Tony for one hasn't had full 20/20 vision in years. Life would be of too little difficulty and hardship if everyone always
Steve doesn't plan on making him wait. He doesn't think he'd be able to, even if he wanted – his fingers are itching to touch, his rational mind clouded with the frankly intoxicating scent, and his every muscle taut in preparation for what's to come.
Still, Tony thinks they could’ve reached an equilibrium. It is time that has run them ragged; the one it took for them to admit what was between them, the one it took to build trust only for both of them to tear it down in the end–Tony laid the groundwork of their destruction with Ultron, and Steve tore down the leftovers in Siberia.
Steve dug his fingers harder into the flesh at Tony's hips when his walls worked around the head of his dick yet again. He was three inches in, give or take, and Tony was mewling and spasming around him at the tiniest movement, his opening already too far stretched to close up properly.
Maria nods her head as she listens and looks off to the side, uncharacteristically unperturbed for someone who's just found out alternate realities exist. This probably
And, well, he's not an animal, but he's still
Steve halts in his step and observes, the easy air about him gone as he takes the scene in. Tony might not be able to see him, but he knows it's this moment that his expression shifts into something equally puzzled and concerned, brows knitting and jaw squaring.
He’s scared. There’s not a human being on earth that wouldn’t be, facing what awaits them.
Steve obliges by the request that is really an order, but not for the reasons Tony thinks. He takes the rope they’ll usually use for climbing and other related purposes and ties him to the shelf at the back wall that’s bolted to the floor–perfect for this use. The counterspace next to it is far from sterile, but beggars can’t be choosers. They’ve exhausted every single other option, and Steve’s going to take his chances; better a slim chance than none at all.
"Well, no. I have not. But it is common knowledge that you Starks think highly of old values, and your father–"
“Humble

He's standing in the door, one half-eaten popsicle in hand. Steve has no idea when he got there.
Tony heads back toward the remains of the giant, stony arch that towers above the mountain. It looks like it might've been part of a bigger structure once, like a palace. Vormir in itself is a visually appealing in nature, really, could've even been a profitable intergalactic tourist attraction if it wasn't for all the death and sacrifice.
She had been given away at the age of five to be trained in the arts of swords, fists and shadows, as was customary in her culture.

What’s that now?

to be here, dead and entirely broken--
Steve shuts up after that.
, of course, there's the matter of piloting Iron Man, which should be one of his main exercise routines anyway, right? Wrong. Most of the heavy lifting the suits can do on their own at this stage, and the times he is actually needed and in it are few and far in-between.
He's barely responsive, his body broken. Maybe part of his brilliant mind is, too. He's still breathing, but it's like he's already gone.
“That is the polar opposite of what Carol advised us to do,” he replied, sounding pained.
the man pushing back into his grasp and his legs spreading apart wider in response, putting the part of himself aching for touch most on display.
This is everything it takes to break his resolve. Tony is pleased. Steve pulls his fingers out, other hand spreading him open, and Tony knows he’s watching. His face is hot. Steve has barely grazed his prostate and the pull in his groin is already all too palpable. He clenches a little around Steve’s fingers as they slip out. Steve groans, deep in his chest, evidently at both the sight and feel of it. Tony knows how to make him weak alright.
“You’re done,” Steve says, tapping his shoulder. It’s late. “Let’s go.”
Steve, though, he saw things Tony didn’t even think to consider, had differing opinions and perspectives to offer and was invested to a point Tony debated with himself over whether he should put together a whole new collection just to surprise Steve for their big anniversary. (He may or may not have given into the urge.)
Tony deflates with a sigh. "Fine. I'll see you, Steve."
Thank God. Tony doesn't voice his relief, but he's damn glad he's going to be spared that task for at least the day. He's pretty sure he's got bruises all over his ass.
It may go against his every instinct as a mother and every last notion of common sense within him but he knows deep down: he can't sit this one out. Even if by some miracle, he could turn his back on the situation and let the others handle it, the chances that there wouldn’t be anything left by the end but ash and dust are too high. That’s too grim a world to raise a child in.
A lot of people wander in and out of this place. Tony soon found that he's the only occupant who has ever willingly stayed there for longer; everyone else seems to be happy to be on their way after a night's rest. Technically, he wouldn't have had to stay there, either. Tony could've built a whole mansion on a plot of land at the outskirts of town, but chose not to. He favors springs of old mattresses poking into his back and unseasoned stew with stringy meat over risking his identity being found out.
"Sorry. Just– you asked," Steve adds, going for damage control.
Tony leaves after he's finished cleaning up the kitchen, up the stairs and, probably, to sleep. Steve has an usually quiet breakfast all by himself and then takes his shower. The house is quiet again.
, a startled, heaving breath that has Steve’s rhythm stuttering for a moment or two.
Which leaves Steve and Tony to collect the Soul Stone.
The following week is spent in preparation of the mission, their lives' work.
close to resigning myself to the fact that this was gonna be another one of Stark's antics, but I've been pleasantly surprised for the very first time."
"This. In me. Right now," he says, pointing in the vague direction of Steve's dick.
One evening, Tony's working and Steve's sketching on the couch close by. He’s done it dozens of times before, but it’s become a rare sight now. For once, they're not arguing, and Tony can’t keep it all to himself anymore.
Steve blanks. He's made peace with the way things stood in the last few hours and yet here Tony is, telling him he doesn't have to. All because this five-year-old girl inherited every bit of her parents' perseverance and this Tony too has, despite his initial display of sternness, a very soft spot for his child's every want. The
He slipped all the way out, angling his hips back and watching with a depraved kind of wonder as his ruddy cockhead popped out (long time no see), and. And Tony's opening shrunk back to not its original size, but to a size that actually left a hole, and Steve could see it, could see inside, could see the mess of come and lube just flowing out like he'd turned on a faucet–
"Nearly?"
"Judging your taste in men like
guy in human history who'd needed four assistants to have anal sex), so he let it be.
It is second nature now: he will hear it getting closer, and he’ll shove himself between the other man and the closest attacker to shield him from the worst of it. Tony used to protest, vocally and elaborately, but that was before the incident when he almost got bit the first time around. After that, he saw that it was a logical precaution, a safety measure born out of necessity. Steve’s the only one out of the two of them with the privilege to risk a bite or two–or five, or ten.
Steve’s going to admit, the guy’s got spunk for a naked, first-class omega in ten wagons full of angry alphas who’d give a not-so-figurative limb to get a go at him. He is nowhere near convinced, though.
"I'm sorry," he says. For the first time, he doesn’t just think it.
If he wasn't already stiff with cold, his every muscle would go rigid now, as he processes what this indicates. His whole body aches with it, but Tony lifts his head nevertheless. He needs to know, just needs to make sure it’s only his brain conjuring up a hallucination that will comfort him as he’s about to go out.
Most of all, somewhere for Tony to rest.
That’s what he was told, on that day. After he’d let a wanted delinquent get away because the man had blindsided Steve's rationale with pictures of his infant daughter and pled with him that he couldn’t orphan her. That it wasn’t right. That he would kill her too, leave her to starve.

about any of this! You were in no way familiar with that animal and did not have the faintest notion how it would handle that jump."
While Steven tied the last bag to his mount, Anthony swung up onto his mare's back. She nickered alarmingly for a reason he couldn't seem to determine until he looked up and found Peter approaching them at a speed that had turned his face red.
He doesn’t manage to fall asleep just yet but is content to stay there, close to Tony in the soft glow of the crackling fire. When he closes his eyes, he can
Steve groans, if because of the words or the way Tony keeps clenching around him–he’s already so damn close–Tony isn’t sure, and he isn’t sure he cares. He cares about the way Steve’s grip tightens around his waist, how he bites into Tony’s shoulder and doesn’t let up, how his breathing grows labored and choppy because he’s close too.
He pulls the other man back down, cradling him tight as he presses a kiss onto the crown of his head. He’ll be damned if he goes out not telling Tony just how much his feelings are shared.
Steve steps in front of the cowering omega to shield him from vision and then addresses the crowd of people still gathered there, “Nothing has changed. We’re still proceeding as planned. That said, he might be of use, so he’s off limits until further notice. Are we understood?”
Stark has just sifted through all their equipment, stored away waiting and ready in the very back of the last wagon. Sooner, long before Stark came to join them, they’d sectioned off part of it to use as a sort of operations room, where everything related to the cause – including meetings – was held. Now, the place is filled with an assortment of tools, most of them crafted (torches, bludgeons, ropes) and the empty barrels they’ll roll out when the day comes to take the train by storm.
“C’mon,” he demands, voice just on this side of desperate. He pushes back against the palm resting on his asscheek, wiggles a little, and hears Steve draw in a sharp breath. Oh, Tony is very aware he isn't the only one who's had a tough month.
He looks horribly, visibly, gloriously wanton.
Sympathy is the wrong word. Pity, more like. Pity, because Stark looks like he didn’t expect this to be a possibility. He was so sure nobody would ever be able to match him it catches him off-guard now. Even so, he’s devising another plan; Steve sees it in that unblinking stare of his as he scans the immediate vicinity for a way out.
The pen clattered to the floor after the table shook with a particularly hard thrust. Neither of them paid it any mind. Tony moaned, one of those lewd, keen sounds he knew Steve adored. He tried to spread his legs wider just to get that extra inch inside of him, the attempt thwarted by his pants pooling at his feet.
Although, taking in the scene, it couldn't be denied that even from the sidelines, this had to be a sight to behold. Thor was pretty much living proof for that assumption, as he had barely moved from his spot for the better part of the last hour and still seemed as invested as he had been in the beginning.
for even the fraction of a second.
This is his main way of getting around, which is only one of many interesting details about his person. It took Steve most of the last month to find him, tracking dozens of cold leads that fizzled out into nothing, intercepting petabytes of data traffic and breaking up more than one exchange of black market merchandise. His patience paid off once he got hold of someone who could point him into the direction of a merchant that was delivering this particular tech.
It takes them almost until noon to find the herd. The horses are slow in the almost knee-high snow, and their search often leads them off negotiable trails and into rough terrain.
Next to him, Steve's leaning against the inner wall of the arch, its surface discolored and littered with cracks that came to be in the course of time. The Skull's unmoving form is watching them wordlessly from a few yards away, his hollow eyes not betraying a thing. It's eerie. Tony wonders if he has a hunch for whether they'll bite or not.
The memories, on the other hand, are there among supplies and equipment in each of their backpacks, and they'll carry them every step of the way whether they'd like to or not.
Tony arrives a lot slower and appears still semi-asleep when he does. His eyes scan the scene briefly, and when Steve flashes an apologetic half-smile and scratches the back of his neck a little guiltily, Tony only waves a dismissive gesture in passing and murmurs 'good morning' through a yawn.
Steve turns away from the scenery outside to find Tony looking at him, arms crossed and head tilted an inch to the side with the hint of a soft smile playing at his lips. "Woah, Plato," he comments, without any real humor that would ruin the gravity of the moment.
The gesture really doesn't do the unspoken justice, but he doesn't know how to say
"Steve.” His voice comes out flat and shaky because confrontation isn’t easy even when you’re on the interrogator’s side. "What is this?"
A sliver of that too-smug smile is back. Steve's still leaning over him, and Tony doesn't fail to notice the slight tremble in his arms or the strain in his shoulders, but the man's got self-control for days when he has somewhere to channel it.
Lies, Tony thinks now, have never been in short supply between the two of them.
"Who the fuck do you think you are, that you can–can come into this world and think it's yours to do with as–"
nicely.”
Now, too, the man with a plan is on a quest to search for a solution to the problem, and–oh. Not complaining about that. His hand has reached down to wrap around Tony's cock lying against his stomach, once again limp.
Peter refused.
If James found both their bedrolls empty one night and frantically searched for Anthony until he came across sounds deeper in the woods that indicated the Lord was most definitely not being abducted against his will, he did not say.
"Your hair is lighter. Just a shade, maybe, but lighter."
He leaves the next morning, suited up, all the stones secured in a bag and enough Pym Particles in his pockets he could even make a detour back to the 40s if he wanted. (If he wanted. Maybe.
Steve decides it's time to announce their arrival. "Alright, you've had your fun," he shouts, raising his voice over the alphas and occasional betas who are cooing, crooning and growling playfully at the man in the corner and laughing in unison whenever he gives a feral hiss in return.
Sir James Rhodes was granted lordship by King Fury that same day.
to know that.”
When Steve suggested they do this, Tony didn't think he'd care for it much. Sure, he'll never say no to an ego-boost, and maybe even less so after an episode like the one he's just had, but right now it feels like more than that. Something twists in his chest, tight and hot in a way that has nothing to do with the fact that both his pulse and breath have quickened.
Steve wakes with a jolt.
, first through the tears and then hysterical laughter, because here he is, alone and miserable and
Tony can only do so much to stay in the saddle while the pair of mules attached to its horn tug in every which direction. A few feet to his left, the mountain trail falls away into a steep slope that ends in a sea of rocks and debris at the bottom. Tony pretends not to feel sick and averts his eyes, fixing his gaze to the space between Butterfingers' ears.
Maria gapes at him when he slides it over to her. It's a rough sketch and not perfect by any means, but in her eyes, the uneloquent details don't stand out at all. "I'm hanging this in my room," she decides resolutely. Steve smiles. "I'm honored."
Steve flinches at his words. He needs to shut up and get it together
And while the connection is there, and Tony is grateful for it in the good moments and admits he’d have given up the fight without it long ago in the bad moments, he doesn’t want Nebula getting attached to a dying man. It isn’t fair. But what is?
Tony tightens his arms around him and cradles his head in one hand, tight and secure. The answer is another violent sob that echoes through his own chest.
"See, it's never been a, ah, physical matter that has prevented me from siring a child. Some things would have just been easier if I had been born a woman." He paused. "And others much harder, I suppose."
Sometimes, there was a Caramel Mocha Latte, or double-cheeseburgers – three for Tony after Sam, the heathen, refused his second serving – or the pizza that's somehow always around the compound, or anything else that tickled his fancy. It doesn't help that his metabolism is slowing down – not to mention that this is just another in a whole slew of confused bodily mechanisms that are (to put it mildly) just done with his antics after fifty-and-then-some years of him ignoring their wails of agony.
They’re approaching deep winter at a steady pace, and it reflects in the temperatures. The winds pick up, the weather turns fitful and harsh; clouds cover the skies more often than not, bringing with them more snow and the first storms. Rogers expands the shelter next to the hut to shield the horses and mules from the worst of it. He’s hammering away at a plank of wood when Tony cuts in again from where he’s standing by his side, watching.
In the later hours, when Tony has officially lost count of the many times he's asked for a refill, a man pushing his way into the space of the saloon catches his eye. Despite what people seem to believe, he does keep an eye on the comings and goings; at least until a point from which on he's too out of it to care.
"Did she not say she would not breathe a word of it? I understand those were her exact words. Believe me, Carol Danvers is on our side in matters of the heart."
What follows is a soft
They don't talk the rest of the way.
Clean and sated, he goes back downstairs–not before admiring the many marks littering his body in the mirror–and decides to get started on those omelets anyway. (After he’s cleaned the kitchen, because while they might not be grossed out by each other’s bodily fluids, he’d still like a sperm-less breakfast.)
Steve resists sheepishly clearing his throat and thanks Tony instead. Right. Because he's grateful for Tony's hospitality, and the fact that Tony puts up with him despite his likeness being a constant reminder of his dead husband. He isn't sure whether Tony has noticed his lingering glances, but if he did, he's been very generous in letting the uncalled-for behavior slide.
"I suppose – well, I would need to contemplate my final answer for a while, but if you are sure I am what you wish for in a successor, then I would be honored to accept," he said, congratulating himself for how expertly he'd hidden the waver in his voice.
"Tell him what you told me," Bucky orders, arms crossed over his chest – and it is an order, no doubt about that. He’s cutting right to the chase, leaving no room for arguments in a way that reminds Steve just why he's not only his best friend but also most trusted enforcer at that.
His arousal grows unbearably painful as he takes in the man laid out in front of him; Stark himself is truly as sinful as his deeds. Some estimate he must’ve been around for over a century by now, but there’s nothing in his appearance that reflects his age. One might dare say it's his own fault for shaping himself into such a creature a man is unable to resist.
Steven attempted to calm his stuttering breath and quickening heartbeat. The door was unlocked; any moment now, one of the castle's many inhabitants might open it and stumble upon the scene on the other side.
Steve likes to think he's become a man of the present. Which is why, when Tony's lips are suddenly on his, he doesn't hesitate to relish and make the most of this moment he's been longing for so desperately.
Yeah, well. Tony has always known to push his buttons.
"I know how to get into Pierce's inner circle, but l'll need a few things to fall back on and make myself credible," Romanoff says, getting to the meat of the topic right away. Were she anyone else, Steve would have assumed it's because she wants it to be over, but that isn't the case here. They're alike in that regard: both of them hate wasted time.
There's also the neat side benefit that the continuous pressure from the plug gets him hot enough his performance significantly improves when they're actually getting down to business. Win-win for everyone involved.
The city used to be full of color, back then.
Romance, no matter the kind, did not receive precedence as time wore on.
“And everything– went smoothly? No hitch in your grand scheme?”
When Steve sees him, he knows it was worth it.
The other cleared his throat and respectfully backed a few steps away when there was no need for his support anymore. “Steven Rogers, my Lord. I directed the witcher Strange to you after the battle. You do not remember, I imagine, but it shall not matter. I am not here to seek your thanks, only to join you during your travels.”
The first Starks had erected the eastern watchtower and the innermost walls longer than five centuries ago, right upon the hill above the town of Hattam, with the mountains at back and the city walls in front.
Everything he already knew has been proven once again: Tony is a fighter, and he defies all odds. The ability to do the impossible is an attribute Tony holds the same way other people possess characteristics like being a bookworm or having a sweet tooth. It makes Steve fall in love with him every day anew, and he aches something fierce with the want to show that affection but holds back.
"You're not…
Steve's almost by his side when Tony's eyes drop to his right hand, but Steve pulls his sleeve back and reveals the identifier bracelet before he has to say anything. A little more at ease, he lets himself be wrapped in a crushing hug, and some of the tension leaks from his shoulders.
Through half-lidded eyes, he observes his reflection, feeling distanced from the man in the mirror as though someone else is looking back at him. His counterpart is flushed all over, some strands of his hair sticking to his forehead with sweat, dick leaving a wet smear against his hipbone.
. Only–ah–yours–"
"How'd you convince them?"
The reaction she received was not the one she had expected or hoped for, truth be told. After a moment of silence, Maria sat upright, withdrawing her hands from their place around Carol's waist. Brows drawn together, she said, "Love, I adore you, but this must be the most fatuous thing I have ever heard."
His eyebrows furrowed in concentration as he spread Tony's cheek further apart and observed come and slick drip past his two fingers slipped in alongside Steve's already massive length. The puffy, reddened pucker of Tony's hole fluttered uselessly for a moment in a desperate attempt to keep the fluids from leaking out. It was of no avail, however, because they spilled anyway, a trail of white foam traveling past Tony's perineum and even further down until it reached his sac.
Still undecided, Steve puts his ear against the surface of the door, listening intently for a few beats. The house is quiet. He must’ve been asleep longer than he thought. When he’s convinced nobody’s up anymore, he straightens and, after a single moment’s hesitation, opens the door.
The nature is entirely untouched out here; Tony has never seen anything like it. It is as if they've entered a different world, where humanity and civilization are words that have no meaning. Mother nature reigns over these lands, and him and Rogers are just tiny, unimportant specks tainting her creation. They ride past planes of snow glittering in the early morning sun, an ice-clad creek that falls off into a miniature waterfall of icicles, and cross a frozen lake where Rogers points out a couple of animal prints that he claims are snowshoe rabbits'.
They don't restrain him, Steve'll give them that.
Tony throws his fork down and pulls at the wide collar of his shirt to expose the teeth marks on his shoulder. Steve's eyes widen, and it would be comical were his expression not so very far from anything qualifying as humor.
If he’s more distant, jumpy and irritable than ever before, Steve doesn’t call him on it. At first.
“Anthony tells me he would like for you to see him in the Old Chambers in the eastern tower today,” the steward informed him, voice impartial as ever as she relaid the unusual news.
in this world?
Tony bites out a frustrated whine underneath his breath. He is losing his
Tony looks on, a little dumbstruck by the turn of events, while a few people raise legitimate concerns and ultimately join him in his staring when Steve slams down a fist on the table and yells, “I can’t
Steve wakes slowly.
Tony brings both hands up to hold onto the pillow. Steve folds over him, all heat and tight muscle, and interweaves their fingers. Tony keeps his ass canted up as much as he can, but at a particularly hard thrust, Steve shoves him flat against the bed and that's that.
Tony's glad about that particular development though -- he prefers dealing with Steve's momentary tunnel vision over any further unprompted acts of violence. He only barely managed to keep the man from acting on the initial knee-jerk reflex telling him to pounce on the ominous, floating figure as it stepped out of the shadows and revealed itself as the Red Skull.
A gunshot permeates the air.
Stark helps.
1950 hours. Steve figures he's got time to take what’s offered.
Steve is on him at lightning speed after that, sliding into the space between his legs like he belongs there–and hell, sometimes when he puts that eighth world wonder of a dick inside, Tony's inclined to believe that idea might just hold a sliver of truth. Steve pulls him flush against his body and spreads him open with one hand while he uses the other to guide the head of his cock in-between his already lube-slick asscheeks.
Steve lets him lead the way. They're escorted by a single agent who looks like he wishes he didn't have to be here; in fact, all the ones they encounter in the winding corridors give them a wide berth. First, Steve assumes it's thanks to him, but then he catches one big guy eyeing Tony warily as he walks by, and from then on reality becomes hard to miss.
Tony thinks, in a fit of stupidity or maybe brilliance. He isn’t sure. If the sight were a little less promiscuous, a bedsheet thrown over their groins, he could imagine this scene in a Renaissance painting.
Now for the hard part.
“Whatever you think is happening, I’m not even remotely in the loop."
"Right. That's– good. Thanks for the heads-up," Steve answers, proud that his voice doesn't sound half as choked as he feels.
Except--hold that thought. It's not about that. It's not about what doing this would make out of
Steve knew it would come, and he's been preparing for it ever since.
He looks like little more than an overpriced special edition of Average Joe, 54, proud father of three, husband to a (house)wife but married to his nine-to-five desk-job after which he returns home to complain about said wife's cooking, crack open a cold one and spend the rest of the evening on an overstuffed armchair watching
Lying to himself seems like an infallible strategy until a particularly bad day comes along. Nine o'clock sees him almost getting caught by an unannounced visitor, which leaves him twitchy and irritable for the rest of the day. Pair that with swollen ankles, mounting back pain and a sudden migraine, and Tony is almost proud he makes it into bed instead of laying down on the floor somewhere and succumbing to fate.
Howls. One, in the beginning, but a few more are quick to emerge in way of answer. It has to be a small group at the least. Tony almost falls over himself as he wades through the snow back to the fire, but there's no need for the rush – Rogers is already up and alert as if he's never been asleep at all (and boy, does Tony not want to entertain that idea). Both of his hands have a firm grip on the hunting rifle, and it's clear he means to end this once and for all.
No, for the first time, he was entirely, truly alone – and although that isn't quite true now, the threat of it always lingers in the back of his head, waiting to make its presence known whenever he catches a glimpse of it on these occasions.
Steve's not a man of half measures though, and far be it from him to put his mind to this thing and then not execute it accordingly. Tony should’ve seen that coming; unless he's in a joking mood, Steve rarely says things he doesn't mean. This is just the youngest instance of that uncompromising earnestness coming into play.
Yinsen’s voice is looping inside Tony's mind like a broken recording. A mantra, maybe. A decade has passed, and the words still remain etched into his memory fresh as they were the day he fled the cave, molded into something new, something better through the force of fire, blood and water.
The hand on his shoulder disappears, and then Steve's up on his feet, taking a staggering step back as he spreads his arms. "Jesus Christ, Tony!” The words are intercut by a disbelieving, sudden half-laugh. “What else is there? Why did you never
That last part makes her deflate a little, and she shrugs. "Yeah, I guess. It was just an idea," she answers, turning back to hash out some details in her drawing.
there when I needed to be."
Suddenly enraged, the omega whirls around despite his injuries to clutch the alpha’s thigh, ripping her pant leg in the process. A futile endeavor, since one of the soldiers bracketing Bain steps forward and kicks him back onto the floor while the other ushers the woman out of the car and to safety. After having put his boot between the omega’s ribs another two times purely for his own enjoyment, the last soldier scurries off as well with a provocative, careless whistle.
"Or, if you were feeling quite so bold, you may visit me at a later hour. Might be the high and mighty Lord Stark needs protecting in his bedchambers now as well. Who is to know what could possibly be lurking out there?"
When they part, Steve brushes his thumb over Tony's bottom lip and breathes 'I love you' into his mouth, and Tony says it back because while
The interior of the house doesn't differ much from the one he already knows, which makes this whole encounter even stranger. Tony, alive and breathing and alone with his daughter in an otherwise empty home. Christ, did something happen to
A surge of mortification rolls over him. If he looked debauched before, he doesn't want to know what his reflection is showing this time around. Maybe it's a good thing he can't see for shit right now. His voice sounds self-conscious even to his own ears when he says, "This is messy, huh?"
A leader is supposed to know these things
"Been–" The word sounds like an ugly, raw abomination of human language, and Tony has to clear his throat twice before he speaks again. "Been better, but I'll survive."
(At 2100 hours, Steve Rogers is a free man.)
The young knight handed the letter over to Anthony, who inspected the King’s golden sigil, now broken, and quickly skimmed the contents of the message.
Perhaps, Tony thinks, muscles hurting as he smiles a delirious smile, Rogers will find his body and mourn, and the last drawing of Tony Stark in his sketchbook will be one of a frozen corpse. He will have regrets, will think about the many glances, the long moments and missed opportunities. In the nights, he will torture himself with the what-ifs, with the things that could’ve been had he only, with everything that would be different if they had acted sooner.
A sigh of not-quite-relief escapes him as he slides the door close. Steve knows better than to give into that false sense of security; there are still actions to be taken before they get to sit back and wait for the herd to move on. Together, they push shelves and cupboards up against the door, the kind of large, steel furniture you’d expect to find in a place such as this. It couldn’t be more ideal.
As he turns to go, the man clears his throat with ostentation. Steve halts to face him and sees him holding up his tied hands, the implication clear as day. Oh, sure. Keep on dreaming, buddy.
Two weeks.
Steve is and has always been so far out of his league it's not only tragically hilarious but also mildly concerning.
Tony frowns. There’s something wrong with that thought, which is–Steve never gets into bed that late.
When the brunet opens his arms, Maria comes running in an instant, throwing herself into the embrace. Tony secures her in his grip and squeezes just a little tighter, possibly exhaling in relief or preparation for what is yet to come. He lets Steve know that he’s going to be down in a minute with a fleeting gesture, mouthing ‘I’ll be right back’ so that Steve, unwanted houseguest, won’t attempt to flee the perimeter in the meantime.
On the seventh, a knight of the King’s Guard requested to speak to him, a carrier pigeon with a gray coat perched on his shoulder. James led him into the tent and listened in from his spot next to Anthony’s cot as the man relaid his message.
Steve captures Tony's surprised moan in a kiss, his tongue and dick claiming him as Tony comes apart underneath them. And then, as Tony is panting and shuddering against him, Steve follows him over the ledge, Tony's muscles working around him.
They make it out of the crowd, just barely, and hightail it down the street. The next junction comes into view and it’s just as crowded as the one they just escaped from. Steve swears out loud as the group of idling zombies becomes aware of their presence. Tony comes to standing next to him just this moment–Steve curses himself for forgetting himself and the fact that Tony doesn’t have his stamina–still breathing heavily from the exertion of both fight and flight.
It’s surprising and uncommon, apparently. That he isn’t bigger yet. They say denial plays a part and Tony’s always been good at that, hasn’t he? (Denying the truth, denying himself, denying what's right there in front of him.)
elicits in him because how in God’s name is he supposed to–
Rogers' voice echoes through the valley, bouncing off the mountain ridges closing in around them and eventually fading somewhere deep down in the snow-clad plains below.
Tony isn't finished, that much is made obvious by his lips parting yet again for another semi-serious jab at his conversational partner. Steve doesn't let him get another word in, though; there's no need to argue over the exact intricacies of this arrangement. He can deal with it. God knows he's had worse.
And Tony–Tony is the second thing he notices.
Tony thinks they should name it.
In the evening, he enters the garage to (maybe) convince Tony to come out and eat dinner, especially since he hasn't had lunch. Steve doesn't feel he has the right to argue with him about his eating habits; while they've spent a considerable amount of time in the other's presence and are far from strangers, well…
Now, rainbows in puddles coated with oil are just dirty puddles. A skyscraper checkered with (un)lit offices is nothing but light pollution. And sunrise only announces yet another day the city may lose its serendipitous equilibrium between absolute chaos and total despotism.
Steve’s been wondering about the smell ever since he’s entered the front wagon. It's a sweet, distinct fragrance he couldn’t pin down for the life of him because he hasn’t scented it in
Server maintenance has an annoying habit of bringing to mind how much his A.I. isn't just all glib repartees to counter his snark. A weekend is what it takes these days, on account of JARVIS having become a little chunky over the years. No shame in that, but he’s definitely due for a defrag again. That should shave off at least a few petabytes.
(Very.)
He ignores Pepper's calls and question mark-riddled Emails.
Inside, he finds an old, torn-up uniform that can only be Steve’s, a StarkPhone he's hard pressed to admit is years ahead of anything SI is putting out right now, a journal and a strange, watch-like device that displays the date 3-21-2012.
There’s nothing here, but he needs there to be something. Because he can’t sleep next to Steve even though he wants to, and he can’t bear his touches even if he aches for them, and he’s tired from not sleeping at all or sleeping and dreaming and he just wants it to
Fury, after squeezing his hand a degree tighter than ultimately necessary – like that would somehow test his identity for its authenticity – sounds a sigh clearly aimed at Tony, arms akimbo underneath his coat. "We received your instructions loud and clear, Anthony. Routine questionnaire, routine examination. No goods will be damaged. It's in everybody's best interest to evaluate what
He remembers perfectly well what Steve said he would do as countermeasure to his most recent,
Steve Rogers into their team.
Steve’s heard whispers they made adjustments to the serum since he received it. Why, he isn’t sure; he's learned to control himself since his first few assignments. And yet, the others tend to get an odd look in their eyes when he indulges in their requests to tell his story, the one of the lab and his final rebirth. They always seem awfully eager to end their conversation as soon as possible once he’s finished.
"Shh," Steve intones softly, and the words spilling so copiously from Stark's mouth suddenly cease, stop and die at the slightest hint of a command that isn't one. "'s okay, Stark. I'm staying. C'mon, scoot."
so effortlessly Steve doesn't think there's any chance he can possibly get on the man's good side ever again.
Tony snorts, smile turning into a smirk. He has to bring it up now.
Tiberius Stone have mercy if you take more than your allotted ration.
He figures Tony will take some time with his daughter, so he walks up to the holograms still floating there and studies the information given for some time.
“Walls, FRIDAY,” he said, feeling Steve’s heated gaze follow him as he stood and circled the table. His A.I. wormed her way into the building’s systems in a moment and cranked up the opacity of what before had been transparent glass panels–not a moment too soon, because the second Steve picked up on the lock on the door snapping close, he all but lunged for Tony.
"People already seem to believe that you are a bastard I fathered and have been made to raise in my home, which is, as we know, a perverse abomination of the truth. But while I detest the way some choose to speak about you, I have to admit these whispers are a welcome counterweight to a number of other, popular rumors."
It hasn’t felt that intense in a long time. His chest is tight and hot with it, pulse knocking in his throat and his gut coiled into a million knots of pleasure he feels might just release any moment considering how tight his balls feel already. He's starting to think this might turn out to be the best sex they’ve had in a while. Not that it usually isn’t spectacular, but this is otherworldly.
Tony wakes to an empty bed, a blue sky behind the city skyline and aches in places that have his morning wood twitch when he thinks about how they came to be.
Steve tightens his hold around him a fraction, smile growing ever so slightly more smug because he managed to leave Tony lost for words.
Sometimes a man just wants to get fucked like he’s 25, absolutely cockeyed and in the company of three charming gentlemen who are with him for precisely one reason, which is that they won’t be gentle whatsoever.
“SHIELD,” Steve says, finally. It’s directed at the agents in the room, Natasha and Clint, but his eyes are still on Wanda, which makes Pietro step a little closer to her on instinct. “They still have the scepter?”
Anthony, although he had yet to recover fully from his injuries, insisted they set out on their journey to King’s Landing only three days later. His condition didn’t allow for him to travel on horseback, so he begrudgingly accepted his place in the back of the wheelhouse a local merchant had provided them with.
A deep, pleased sound emerged from his own chest, escaping between his clenched teeth as he dared to pick up speed, nailing the man's prostate with every other thrust. (He hadn't had the fortune of having Tony like this before, but he damn well knew where his sweet spot was.)
Only when Tony breaks their eye-contact does Steve realize they've been looking at one another throughout his confession. It's strange. Here he is, admitting his love for a Tony who's gone to another version of him, a Tony who is different but the same; a Tony who is alone just like he is, but also not.
It would be even nicer if the pitch of it wasn’t so full of apprehension that gradually bleeds into suppressed panic as it becomes louder, almost… closer.
associated with you being–"
Over by the terrace are fresh bootprints in the grass.
She smiles when she tells him, small and wobbly, and something in his chest hurts in a way that has nothing at all and yet everything to do with the crushed bone there. Steve is the link that holds what should be a self-contradictory statement together, and this moment should’ve been something beautiful, something that Tony imagined would be met with an ear-to-ear smile and an exhilarated laugh–but everything that comes to mind now is his face, bloodied and cruel when he brought the shield down on Tony.
Next to him, Bucky suddenly steps forward, eyes clouded with an emotion Steve can't read. "I'd like to help," he says, quietly, and Steve isn't sure whether he's doing it for him, Rhodes or Tony, but he has an inkling it might be all of them. When the man nods in approval, Carol joins in as well.
Steve forgoes an answer and leans down to kiss him instead, tongue working to split the seam of his lips with gentle force. Tony smiles against his mouth and continues to move against him, getting just a little more insistent with every push. Previously resting over Tony’s heart, Steve’s hand strokes over his chest to pinch a nipple, applying enough pressure to make the brunet gasp into their kiss.
That sure is a strange thing to be asking when you fucked someone’s brains out less than an hour ago.
"I don't."
Anthony was leading the animals outside the stables when Steven arrived with the last bag of garments and linen they had forgotten to bring with them from the castle. He could not keep from smiling brightly at the other man once they had locked eyes, their combined excitement electrifying the air.
His heart is racing with the thump of a racehorse’s gallop and there’s sweat pooling in the hollow of his throat. He doesn’t remember dreaming, but from the way his body behaves, he's most likely had a nightmare. One that didn’t stick to his conscious, thankfully. He doesn't want to know what his brain is capable of conjuring as a result of the past month alone.
He shakes the thought. Tony’s made the decision to forgive him and if anything, he should respect his judgement and be thankful it turned out in his favor. God knows the man would’ve had every right not to take him back.
Steve's smile changes a little, shifts, and it takes a moment for him to realize that the reason for the subtle reaction is himself, Tony, who now has a wry but genuine smile returning the other man's. He doesn't know when it happened, only that it has, and Steve might be indeed magical. Maybe Steve needs some sort of glitter-apparatus added to his shield, come to think of it.
The term of endearment still has something flutter pleasantly in his stomach, and he'd feel self-conscious about the heat in his cheeks if it wasn't so damn nice. It's a pass on the mask, this time around: Tony's going all out, emotional fallout be damned.
In a lethal choreography that has become familiar to them throughout the hundreds of times they’ve practiced and perfected it, they’re slashing their way through the hungry mob of clawing fingers, rotten flesh and menacingly clacking teeth. The latter is what he dreads most, the clatter of bone upon bone a spine-chilling sound that will get his blood running cold and his body crowding closer against Tony’s in an immediate, Pavlovian response.
Tony’s mouth opens and closes around nothing, up until Steve takes his arm by the wrist and presses it onto the counter with a crushing force. He thinks he might be breaking something, and it tears him apart on the inside that saving Tony comes with all this added brutality, but there is no other choice when he jerks and flails like this to fight for an escape that won’t ever bear fruit.
But Tony’s fears aren’t directed toward his own fate, which in turn makes Steve worry for him all the more. They all have their roles to play in this, except Tony in particular has a history of attempted self-sacrifice for the greater good, which Steve is positive won’t just end because they have a battle plan worked out this time around.
Tony snorts in lieu of an actual response, although the little defiant twitch of his lips is telling enough. Steve supposes that's more than he's ought to hope for from the start. It's something, at least.
Steve doesn't know what Thor's brother would get out of this, but he'll admit it's a reasonable concern.
Now that she had the chance, Carol was determined to prove herself amongst Stark's guard. She only hoped the Captain of Guard would not make this matter harder for her in an act of petty revenge – men were known to do such things in the name of what they considered to be love.
Steve!"
"But," he says heavily, and finally turns to meet Steve's eyes, "you're everything I have."
This year and all the ones to come, she saw to it that the armory was steadily improved, expanded and replenished. It was a task she found joy in, and the position earned her respect amongst the castle's inhabitants as well.
The way he's pounding into Stark now is brutal – Steve would fear he might be hurting him if everything didn't point toward the fact that Stark enjoys it like this, punishing.
The sudden urgency in Steve's voice and the intensity of his gaze overwhelm him. Tony clears his throat and forces himself not to fidget as he attempts to remain matter-of-fact.
Squaring his jaw as he approaches, Steve pretends not to see the trepidation that overtakes Tony's expression when he gets close enough to reach out.
Tony digs his fingers into the pillow under his head when he looks down and is met with a picture that belongs in an art gallery (and isn't that an idea, putting Steve Rogers sucking his cock out there for everyone to see). Steve's always been lethal with his mouth, and yet it's not only the feeling but the sight of him, how his lips fit around Tony's length and his tongue darts out to circle the head when he pulls off.
Nobody is around here during these hours, not even hikers, and yet Tony's exhibitionist streak gets a little kick out of being outside and bare. If there’s a bad influence between them, it’s Steve, because there’s no doubt in Tony’s mind that he can tell and is enabling him.
"Aye," Thor said, through the kiss he was pressing onto Bruce's temple.
Some days, he manages. On others, he squeezes out a request for help between clenched teeth, and will look at the one hand in his lap as though the lack of its sibling is something he has to process all over again.
Velocity is a constant.
When Tony enters the otherwise empty conference room, the man’s standing at the window with his back to the entrance, muttering to himself. The moment the door falls close behind him, Ross turns. It seems almost Pavlovian, how his expression darkens as they come face to face.
A snap of his fingers, a world of pain, and Tony was gone. Just like that.
He's alpha enough to admit he's looked at Stark with a certain type of
He can't see Rogers and doesn't know where he's gone. Could be anywhere amongst the cattle, or maybe he's rounding the group to search the perimeter–
His forehead creases with a frown and there's an angry tic to the corner of his mouth that contrasts heavily with the look of hurt betrayal that Steve never wanted to see in his eyes again. His expression is an open flesh wound, bleeding and exposed. "You don't get to do that. You don't get to show up here, turn my world upside down, and then disappear when things get messy."
He smirks at Steve. Please, he walked right into that one.
The reason being cleanliness and efficiency, which are the two primary principles he stands by. Some of the other mercenaries in their ranks find him unnerving to be around. Apparently, hIs practices are too clinical. Steve can't see how not taking prisoners is an undesirable trait.
“I'll never not love you,” Steve tells his unconscious form, gently undoing the bindings to gather Tony’s limp body in his arms. His pulse is unsurprisingly weakened, but steady enough considering the circumstances.
Another one of him appears, and in his hands is something Tony recognizes. Something that makes his thoughts spiral back to Obie and Afghanistan and–his whole body twitches as he thrashes in his bindings to no avail. His efforts are only rewarded with a sharp, agonizing pain in his possibly dislocated shoulder and a rattling breath.
To his credit, Tony neither reads nor does he pay any more attention to the message. He leaves it to rot in the inbox, unheard and unseen, because that’s the greatest act of defiance he’s capable of at the time being. But then again, he also pockets the phone instead of putting it back where it was, so maybe this is a point for Steve after all.
Would have, because that particular scenario never eventuates. What happens instead is of a much less desirable nature, and the ramifications are more severe than Tony comes to realizes in the first moment. Granted, the first moment also takes him by surprise, so he can’t be blamed.
In the meantime, his hand has traveled over the other’s hip and down to where his dick lies erect against his stomach. As he takes it in hand, he begins rubbing his own erection against the omega’s crack in time with every pull, repeatedly brushing his opening but never slipping in.
"Вот и все, котенок," she mumbled right then while her other hand slipped past the waistband of her sweats, her voice an octave or two deeper than the one she'd usually fall into.
“Lord Anthony Stark of Mar’vill,” he greeted formally, unrolling a piece of parchment he’d retrieved from underneath his coat, “I deliver this message to you at the behest of His Grace, King Nicholas Fury. A portion of the Guard has returned to King’s Landing and given an account of the events of the last battle. The King has sent word that you and your Captain of Guard are to report to the throne as soon as your physical condition allows for it. His Highness will host you and a small party inside the castle and meet you promptly after your arrival. It is his intention to honor your service to the Kingdom and see to it that the losses Mar’vill has suffered are compensated.”
"That would appear to be the case, Sir. All my readings suggest that this is a nearly perfect carbon copy of Captain Rogers."
He heads over to the joined kitchen, taking two glasses out of an overhead cabinet. Something soft and yearning blooms within Steve as he watches him get up on his tiptoes to reach them, but looks away when he catches himself in the act.
Tony struggles to get words out, the syllables won’t string together when he’s so overstimulated and close to cumming again.
“Never really been my strong suit,” Tony teased, trying to sound disinterested, “sir,” he then added for good measure. It caused Steve eyes to widen for a moment before he got himself back into the scene, stalking his way over to the bed where Tony was sitting.
Tony knew he wasn’t going to last long. He was already pent up from sucking off Steve while Steve put on the Captain America act, and now this. It was too much.
“Steve, it’s okay. You know I forgive you right?”
Tony’s moaning, eyes falling on Steve’s naked body and the way his cock is covered with pre-cum and there’s nothing that can be done about it. He can see the way Steve’s body is trying to thrust into the air in need of any kind of stimulation, even if it’s just feeling the air move around his cock. It makes him feel good that he doesn’t even have to touch Steve to drive him crazy.
Steve helps Tony up off of the floor and Tony makes himself comfy, kneeling on the bed while Steve gets his shield. Tony rolls up a blanket, causing Steve to look at him confused.
Tony wraps his lips around Steve’s cock and feels how his captain shivers with pleasure at the feelings. It’s nice to know that Steve is just as turned on by this as he is.
“Thought so,” Johnny sneered at Steve’s reaction, slowly thrusting into Tony again making Tony cry out due to the blissful pain of overstimulation.
While everyone else found it funny, especially when Rhodey showed them a picture of a six-year-old Tony dressed in a semi-decent Captain America costume, Tony noticed how Steve deflated and looked hurt.
“Most likely the bad influence,” Tony shrugged, quickly changing the subject when he saw Steve’s face threaten to frown. He didn’t need a lecture on how the media was wrong about him and all that jazz. Maybe later.
It was all so complicated and messy, leading to Pepper forcing Tony and Steve to go to therapy and slowly things got better. Steve didn’t really have romantic feelings for Johnny, and Johnny wasn’t that emotionally interested in Steve but sex was sex so they agreed to a ‘thruple’ kind of relationship, which the press was having a field day with after Clint had accidentally made a comment about their relationship to a reporter.
Steve’s close too. He’s never gotten off without some kind of stimulation, even if it’s just grinding against his mattress in the lazy hours of the night or early morning hours.
In his peripheral vision, Steve can see his shield and he has an idea that causes his cock to start to get hard again already and heats pooling in his stomach again.
“I-I want you to cum on my shield” Steve admits, a little embarrassed but then Tony let’s out a low moan in the back of his throat and Steve sees Tony’s cock leak out some more precum, his thighs practically soaked at this point.
“Nope.”
The agreement and confirmation of what their relationship was had led to this moment.
Steve knew he should feel guilty about this, and maybe he did the first three or four times. Maybe there was still a bit of guilt but as the months passed it was buried under lust and desire.
Steve thought that the Iron man amour was sexy.
“This is what you’re good for, isn’t it? Can’t follow orders on the field. Maybe I should just keep you hear. Just use you for this,” Steve pulls himself out of Tony’s mouth almost completely and then thrusts back in. He’s close and Tony knows it, can feel how intensely Steve’s cock is pulsing inside his mouth.
Tony had asked Steve to help him test something out. Something to do with the amour and Steve had jumped at the chance., trying not to appear too eager but he was sure Tony noticed.
Steve’s gaze moved from watching Johnny’s cock slide in and out of Tony to Johnny’s face. He’s looking at Steve with a smirk and eyes filled with lust. There’s no actual malice to his words, Johnny knows this kind of thing gets Steve off and they should probably talk about whether it’s a coping mechanism to repress his guilt about what he did to Tony when they were fighting but today wasn’t the day for that conversation.
“Are you okay?” Tony asks and Steve nods. He’s not sure why he’s crying, he had enjoyed himself, even if it was meant to be a punishment. Maybe that was it. He felt guilty.
Steve raised an eyebrow at Tony, “thought I was meant to be the one giving orders.”
“Bet you’re too gentle with him,” Johnny continued to goad Steve and he stroked Tony through his orgasm. Tony was a moaning writhing mess, cumming all over Johnny’s hand and the sheets underneath him.
Hours ago he had seen a baby faced Peter Parker and now.. his Peter was grown. He knew how to wear suits and had finally grown into his limbs. This Peter walked with assuredness. He had grown up.
“I’m gonna marry you so hard.” Steve murmured into the brunet’s skin.
“Closing your eyes isn't going to make me disappear.” Steve spoke, his footsteps growing even closer.
“You’re alive.” Steve noted, eyes widening in confusion. His throat had just needed water, then.
He had one objective.
Tony was glad to see things going back to a normal routine.
“I suppose it’s too much to hope for a second shot at us?” Steve’s voice sounded defeated.
He was sharp and had walls so well constructed they’d impress any architect. But he let Steve in. He showed him how to be a better man and to live in this modern world. Tony tasted like coffee and blueberries.
“This is middle ground!” Tony waved his hands sporadically. “What do you think I’m doing? I’m trying to get ahead. If we work with them, we have more room to argue for our rights. In
“I’m not surprised, save your excuses.” Peter huffed a laugh before shooing Tony back up the stairs. “Just throw something on. If you hurry we can still make our reservations. You can tell me about your latest breakthrough in the car.”
“Admit your pride was in the way,” Tony glanced down, his hands trembling at his sides, “You were a coward. You–“
“Tony!”
But he had to focus on the words of Earth-199999 Steve. He would know how the blond felt, even if he had died. The feelings had remained. They existed. Steve may have passed, but his feelings would remain. They would be constant.
“It’s nice to meet you, Tony Stark,” she grinned, seeming much more her age with her pearly whites on display, “I believe you can see your way back up to the guest floors?”
in the past. Somehow, he figured the timeline would right itself with its current changes. As in, the future version of Steve who used the time stone to go back to 2023 to prevent Tony from dying would just... cease to exist. He thought maybe 2023 Steve and future Steve would just... blend together. But. That’s not how it worked, no.
Tony needed to protect the family he had. He knew in the back of his mind that the Accords threatened that first and foremost. If the Avengers couldn’t present a united front... everything would be at risk. The stable foundation Tony had spent the last few years carefully crafting would... crumble. He couldn’t risk that.
“Leftover’s on the top shelf.” Tony added quietly, turning on his heel to make his way up the stairs. “Made you a plate. I’ll be in the shower. Peter’s been down for a few hours so he shouldn’t wake up.”
“Pepper! Light of my life!” Tony whirled around. “I, uh, may have not finished crossing my T’s and dotting my I’s, however–“
It had been years since he needed it.
Children, toddlers especially, could smell indifference.
They would be okay.
“Oh, well, I’m sorry you have to think about it,” Tony spoke dryly, “Personally, I had to live through it.”
Steve’s head twisted from where he lay propped on pillows, his eyes beginning to trail across his torso; following the almost endless IV’s to the machine next to his head. His lips smacked together; and then suddenly he took notice of how dry his mouth was. It felt like sand paper. He couldn’t even imagine being able speak an entire sentence.
Tony would never find himself sans armor, not again. There would never be a situation in which he’d be defenseless. Nor a situation where he would be forced to lay helplessly as his...
clothes. But that was a story for another day, of course.
He couldn’t live up to that expectation. So he took the best route, and just didn’t tell him. It would save them both the grief of dealing with rejection. Tony had grew up with a spine of steel. That’s what growing up knowing you’re Captain America’s soulmark did to you. That and being half heartedly raised by Howard Stark.
Tony returned it.
Or, however normal you could refer to it.
“You can’t mean that.” Tony scoffed, stumbling backwards. He shifted his eyes downwards, missing the flash of guilt passing through the blond’s eyes. “You can’t seriously stand in our living room and mean that.”
“For Vision,” Natasha glanced down. Oh, no... Vision. Tony pressed his lips together, sorrow coursing through his veins. So many people...
“You hopeless fool.” Tony spoke, his voice faltering from emotion. “You risked– destroying the balance of the world and for– Steve.”
Oh, how they’d bring hell down on those who dared to cross them. And they’d do that, together, too.
Which begs the question... would affection be too far for a Skrull? Maybe not. After all, Skrull Coulson had managed to even fool Fury. So, obviously, they’re not afraid to go above and beyond to pull the wool over everyone else.
“Hey, no.” Tony rushed forward, causing Peter to let out a squawk as the genius enveloped both him and Steve. Tony pressed a chaste kiss to Steve’s forehead, his hand beginning to soothingly rub up and down the blond’s back. “I won’t let that happen. I won’t. I swear.”
He tried to not think of their tense relationship; or lack thereof. They hadn’t spoken since Tony had been left in Siberia. Which is why he couldn’t explain the unfurling feeling in his chest. He shouldn’t be worried about...
Steve smiled shakily. “I will.”
One with Steve; a lover.
“I suppose you have a place in mind?” Tony tried to appear collected, even though he was inwardly a mess.
The genius wasn’t quite sure if the Avengers could handle that alone. Which... that would be why he desperately needed Steve at his side. Together. The team could handle it together. He feared a reality in which they didn’t. Tony couldn’t imagine things working out so easily.
“I should’ve done a lot of things,” Steve spoke quietly.
“Bucky and I have never been anything more than friends,” Steve spoke softly.
“Yes.” Steve confirmed with a nod.
The team was sprawled around the kitchen island, forks clashing against ceramic plates as they devoured their food. Rocket, Rhodey, and Bruce had stepped up and took on the task of preparing dinner. Or, at least, trying to prepare dinner. Tony wasn’t quite sure what Rocket’s dish was supposed to be. Either way, Tony’s stomach was still weak, so he had only managed to hold down half a plate. He found himself sat on the couch, his back rigidly straight as one Steve Rogers settled in next to him.
Not to mention the effort he put into actually drawing a portrait of Tony. Not just any portrait, no... but one of Tony posed in his everyday attire: jeans and a band tee. His hair was even disheveled along with what appeared to be an oil stain dotting his temple. But the artistry didn’t stop there. The portrait of Tony was the main attraction, yes. But this Tony was drawn standing in the center of a hallway.
“I imagined being better at this.” Steve grumbled under his breath, scowling as he had to tighten his grip on the brunet in order to smoothly maneuver them.
“I do.” Tony exhaled.
I’m trying to protect our family. Peter.”
“Captain America: Shameless Flirt.” Tony grumbled, trying to fan away the obvious flush of his cheeks. “You’re the absolute
Leaving earth, he thought almost hysterically. The sound of Steve’s breath hitching caused Tony to focus his attention on the man before him. He briefly tightened his grip, his fingers clutching at the material of Steve’s undersuit. He began pacing his breath in an attempt to keep his emotions calm, his trembling fingers tracing a pattern into Steve’s backside. You’re alive, he told himself. You’re okay. It’s okay. He didn’t dare look up, refusing to meet that cool blue gaze. He was afraid of what he’d see there.
“Our favor sounds awfully synonymous with
“Again. And then I’m ready.” Steve’s voice cracked.
Tony let out a throaty groan, parting his lips briefly as he tried to gather his wits. Cotton. His mouth felt like it had been stuffed full of cotton. His gaze focused upwards, piercing the ceiling as his calloused fingers grasped at the bedding. He swallowed. Soft sheets. Was he in a hospital? He tried to gradually sit up, wincing as his abdomen cried out in protest. The IVs in his arms didn’t seem to pleased with him either, especially if the uncomfortable prodding sensation tugging at their inserts was anything to go by.
“Eggs go in, Pete.” Tony scolded, stepping forward almost instinctively. His faux frown melted as the baby jerked up, his wide brown eyes peering up at his dad in glee.
“Oh, I know,” she smiled mischievously as he let out a barking laugh, “As I said. Another time.”
“Cuz I’m a big boy!” Peter nodded quickly. “And– and big boys ask for help!”
The sight that lay before him would typically cause the brunet to break out into a smile. Steve sat perched on a stool, a groggy Peter sitting on the edge of the counter clutching a bottle. The blond had one hand gripping the baby’s side as he flitted between feeding himself and making sure Peter was actually getting milk from his poorly gripped bottle.
He had hoped his gaze expressed how displeased he truly was. The billionaire even went an extra measure to cross his arms. That would show Steve.
The blond rose, his shoulders squaring as he did so. Tony had half a mind to beg off, perhaps attempt to convince the super soldier to stay in bed. It was a good plan, too. Except... the brunet’s thoughts came to a grinding halt as the blond leaned down to press a soft kiss to Tony’s temple.
“Tony, shh, it’s okay. I’m right here.” Steve grasped Tony’s hand in his own. He unfolded the fingers, pressing a gentle kiss to each tip before laying Tony’s palm flat against his chest. Right over his heart. “I’m not going anywhere.”
The Captain barely made the connection between the hands gripping his shoulders before he found himself rolled onto his back. His vision remained unfocused, but he couldn’t help but squint as multiple sources of light began to shine in his eyes.
Tony would make sure of it.
It didn’t matter.
Regret?
“So, you know then. Have you imagined a sky full of sentinels hunting us down? Forcibly implanting inhibitor circuits in our brains that take away our powers?” Tony’s voice became sharp, “Genetic testing of the entire population so any potential superhumans are under government control before they’re even born?”
relationship they shared and how it was nonexistent after the accords.
Steve was... Steve was
“I apologize if asking for your hand in marriage was such a burden.” Steve mumbled into the nape of Tony’s neck, leaning forward to wrap his arms around the brunet’s waist as his chin rested on Tony’s shoulder.
It was the kind of mark that Tony wasn’t worthy of.
“Tony.” Steve began, pausing in confusion at the crest fallen look on the billionaire’s face. “Why are you upset?”
“Tony, wait,” Steve shot his hand out, his fingers curling around Tony’s shoulder, “Are we – just wait.”
It could’ve been when Steve had held him, and confessed everything Tony had needed to hear. Words of affirmation. He had helped Tony heal a part of himself that had been broken for years.
Tony let out a hysterical laugh at that, his lips quirking up ever so briefly as he gaze Steve a watery smile. “You are full of shit.”
But it was uniquely Steve shaped.
Tony rubbed his hand across his mouth before turning his head to the side in an attempt to hide his upturned lips. He couldn’t help it, alright? It was the product of witnessing Steve in his mightier-than-thou fashion. It was seeing Steve being so unashamedly
Tony didn’t dare meet his gaze. He refused to falter just because the blond knew how to pull off a convincing pout.
He did rather enjoy people watching, however. Being able to stand back and enjoy the silence felt rewarding; especially after the grueling weeks he had just endured. Tony could’ve laughed. It had felt like months. It had began to look as if nothing would work. But they did it.
