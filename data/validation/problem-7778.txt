to do with it.”
When the others left, Tony turned to Steve.  “Well?  You wanna?”  Steve did, and the two of them fucked it out.  Loudly.
When he quieted, she drug a chair closer to him and sat down.  "Do you want to tell me what happened?"
pumpkin pie to take home with us.
Just a little epilogue I couldn't help writing!
“Music to 65.”
He awoke some unknown time later to someone shaking his shoulder gently. Tony muttered something in his sleep, burrowed deeper into Steve’s chest, and was silent again. Steve could feel him breathing against him, and he tightened his grip on him unconsciously, not certain if this was part of a dream or reality, and not wanting to let go no matter which it turned out to be.
“Stay here tonight,” he whispered, pushing himself against Steve’s cock, undulating against him. “Please. Baby. Stay here.”
“Of course, I do. Do you?”
“That’s awesome.”
Sam sighed unconsciously.  “He’d pace sometimes,” he said.  “Have you ever been to the zoo and seen the way the tigers pace in front of the bars?”  Tony nodded.  “That’s what he reminded me of.  A tiger in a cage.”
He glanced down at himself, then met her eye steadily again.  “I wish you hadn’t seen me this way.”
Her expression cleared.

She wiped lipstick off his cheek with her thumb.  It was a friendly gesture.  It made him want to cry again.
When the jet touched down, he made Nick's office his first stop. The debrief was short. Mission accomplished. Ninety-eight percent accuracy. One casualty. Hutchins. Killed in action.
“Yeah,” Tony said faintly.
“Nobody, really,” Steve said, smiling a little, and everything crashed back into place for Tony.  Gina, her name was Gina.  She was his girlfriend.  Had been for three months.  She was nice.  “We used to know each other.”
“Uh-uh. You’re too special.”
“I wasn’t sure you’d come.”
“Does he know?”
“Yeah,” he said, petting her hair gently. “It smells good.”
Tony gestured into the apartment with his cup. “Yeah. Back to work, Steve,” he said. “And I’ll go back to mine. I guess.” He paused. “Unless you wanna go get lunch?”
“You need to call him.”
A small, knowing smile crossed Tony’s lips. “Still drawing, huh?”
“Nice for me, too.”
"Next time?" Tony whispered, lying down against his broad chest.
“That’s not all,” Steve said.  “Come on.  What’s going on?”
Sam glanced back, then looked up at Steve’s stoic face. “You know,” he said lightly, “he looks at you too, sometimes.” Steve’s jaw clenched. “When you’re not looking.”
Tony came out of the bedroom, leaving Steve napping on their bed.  Nat, Sam, and Bruce had cleaned up the crystal shards and finished the dishes but were nowhere to be seen.  He went outside and saw them loading their go-bags into Bruce’s Prius.
Steve looked at him from under his lashes. “Don’t look very comfortable,” he mumbled. Dodger thumped his tail on the floor, and Steve pet his head again.
The harsh tone, the rough handling was like a bucket of ice water.  It was too much like that night at the cabin when Steve had jerked him off in such a dry fashion.
Sometimes, Tony would come in from the lab, or home from S.I. and find Steve in the kitchen.  The lights would be low, candles already lit on the table, something quiet and mellow on the stereo, Tony's favorite carbonara on the stove.  It was his mother's recipe, and Tony had no idea where Steve had gotten it, but he didn't make it very often. Only a few times a year. Only when Steve felt like it.  When the time was right.
“Shut
anything.”
“Don’t be,” Bruce said, fiddling with his tie.  “I’ll be right up there with you.”  He pulled on the ends of the gray silk, then sighed, frustrated.  “Will you do this?  I can’t ever get it right.”

He was tired.
The ride home was always the most difficult.
“What’s wrong?”
“It was...unsanitary.”
“I’m going to go check the download, alright?” she said.  “You’re going to be quiet, aren’t you, Doctor?”
Steve propped his chin on Tony’s chest so he could look into his eyes. “What did you mean, then?” he asked. “Who hates us?”
“You can make it up to me later.”
“Especially now because I’m not sure what your plans are now. With the divorce, I wasn’t sure if you were planning on staying here? Or going to London, or…?” He trailed off, looking questioningly at Tony.

Steve laughed softly and squeezed him one more time. “No. You don’t. I’ll bet you wish you did sometimes, but you don’t.”
“Yes, Tony.”
had, he could take Steve like this. Red apron and all.
Howard reached out and grasped his hand briefly. “Think about it, son,” he said. “If you decide you’d rather not, I understand, but if you want to give it a shot, just call me. I’ll have you fully set up in twenty-four hours.”
Steve looked down at his hands again, but Tony could see the small, secret curve of his lips. “I didn’t want you to worry. Or be upset if I failed again.”
“Yup. Just maybe.”
“I have some ideas,” Strange said, at last.  “Let me look into them.  When do you see Steve again?”
“How do you function?”
Steve shook his head, feeling cold. “She’s happy with the doctors she has.”
The bitterness.
“Steve,” Sam said when he reached him, and pulled him into a rough hug. “Do we know anything?”
Steve shook his head immediately, his eyes never leaving their intertwined hands. “No,” he said. “No. I wouldn’t do that. I wouldn’t have put you in that position. It would have been selfish.”
He nodded. “Yeah. Ready.” He tightened his grip on Sam’s hand. “Do you still have Pietro’s number?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Please don’t call me your jailbird lover.”
Steve smiled a tiny, secret smile as Tony and Sam started talking about horizontal and vertical vectors, and gravity, and time. Tony did most of the talking, but Sam seemed to understand. All of it was completely above and beyond Steve’s head, but he liked listening to them talk, liked hearing the way their voices complemented and combined into a soothing, calm background hum as they walked toward the cafeteria, the three of them side-by-side, Steve in the middle, Tony and Sam bookending him neatly. Steve didn’t think he had felt such a sense of warmth and belonging in years. Especially when Tony brushed his shoulder against Steve’s as he walked. Steve was sure it was accidental--definitely not on purpose--but it still felt good.
“Let me get a towel or something first.”
“Okay,” she said, and kissed him quickly.  “I’ll call you tomorrow and see how you are.”
“Fine. Whatever.” Pepper was silent, and then he felt like shit. “Hey. Pep. Hey. I’m sorry.” He rubbed his eyes. His forehead. His head was starting to thump. “I’m a prick. I’m sorry, honey.”
“I said I trust you,” he said, and let his head fall back onto Tony’s shoulder. Burrowed into the curve of his neck. “I want what you want, Tony. Just...will you...just touch me? Please? Touch me all over, okay?”
“Hey.”
But Steve was already turning to him, already slipping his arms around Tony’s middle. “Me neither,” he said, and dipped his head onto Tony’s shoulder, holding him tight.
--to ignore the sounds that had suddenly taken over the corner table. Tony was right there with him. He was trying too, but by
Steve sat in the corner.  He didn't watch what was happening around him, but he was aware of it.  Natasha and Bruce sat with him, one on either side, bookending him, propping him up between them.  He chewed his nail. He fidgeted. He refused every attempt at conversation. His mind was blank. Carefully,
Sam chuckled. “I know you will.”
“She is.  But she can’t take care of him.  She’s not strong enough.”
And he hated himself. Hated that he was being affected so much. “‘Night.”
“Tony.”
Sam kept his hand on his shoulder, moving his thumb in small soothing arcs.  “You might have.  What do you remember?”
"Don’t stay away long."
Steve nodded, and as he did, it felt like a huge weight--maybe the only real weight left on his shoulders--was suddenly gone.  “Yeah.  Give it to them.  All of it.”
“No promises,” Steve said. “Do you remember
Howard was home when Tony got there. He was sitting on the living room sofa, a glass of Scotch by his hand, glasses low on his nose, tie pulled down, shirt-sleeves rolled up. It was as casual as Tony had ever seen him look. It was his Sunday, dress-down look. Tony had seen it his entire life.
Tony flapped a hand at him.  “What’s mine is yours, and all that.  You could afford it.”
“Breathe later,” Tony managed. He clutched him tighter and kissed him brutally. His cheek. His neck. His lips. Assaulting him with kisses. Ruining him with kisses. He pulled back a little and looked seriously at Steve’s face. “God,” he gasped. “Baby, you look like shit.”
“It’s cold out there.”
Steve gave him a withering stare.  “It doesn’t matter.  I’m trying to say that I’m not one of your
it okay, Tony?” Steve asked.
Steve took a deep breath and let it slowly out. “I don’t really know what happened after that. I must have walked. Or maybe I ran. I don’t know. I’m pretty sure I just left my cart of groceries in the middle of the store, though. I know I didn’t pay for them, and I kind of remember just walking out the door. I-I don’t think I
“Correct me if I’m wrong,
There was a pause and Tony didn’t think he’d answer, then he said, “I asked what you talked about.  When you go see your doctor.”  Pause.  “I know it’s private, but…” He trailed off and Tony glanced at him.  He was still lying on his back, his straight, perfect nose pointed up, his lips parted slightly.  His eyes were closed.
The guard jerked his head.  “Come on, sir, let’s go.”
Steve ducked his head.  Glanced sidelong at Tony.  “Good.  I didn’t really want to see anyone there.  Thanks.”
“We heard that one night, Blake and some other guy…” he trailed off, and Tony closed his eyes, waiting.  “Anyway, the official story was that he was killed in action.  That’s what got put on the books.  That’s what his mother heard.  And I guess it’s probably a blessing that’s the story she got.”
late, and it didn’t seem like he was the only one either. He listened to a few of the other soldiers talking to their own families and his heart sank a little lower with each one. When the last one, a big guy with a hard face, broke down in tears while speaking to his son, Steve stopped listening. He walked away, lighting another cigarette--his fifth of the afternoon--and thought about what he’d told Tony the night before he left.
Tony closed his eyes and sighed. “See? That’s why I am so in love with you.”

“Nah.  Just messing around.”
Wanda nodded.
Tony pressed back against his chest. “Me too, baby,” he whispered, drowsing in his arms.

she was right.
Okay, this is taking a turn, but believe me when I say it's still not as bad as I had originally thought it was going to be. Some of you may hate me when this chapter is over. I'm so sorry. Really. I am. But, sometimes you just gotta go where the story takes you. I am, however, promising a happy ending, so, if you decide to stick around, there will be eventual goodness!
“When I graduate, I’ll come to work for the company. I’ll be good at it. I already know I’ll be good at it. I’ll work there, and train there, and when you retire, I’ll take it over. Because that’s what’s best for me. For my future.” Tony looked at him, his eyes dull and glazed with hurt and hatred. He looked at his father. The man who had just brought his whole life to a standstill. The man who had done everything in his power to hurt the one man Tony loved completely. Steve could say it wasn’t true, but Tony knew the reality. He’d lived with Howard all his life. He knew what he was capable of.
Tony nodded.  “Yeah.  Even Howard,” he said, and even as the words left his mouth, he knew they were true.  Howard--yes, even Howard--would have been happy to see his only son a happy man, at last.
Tony huffed, traced one finger along Steve’s cheek. “Whatever.”
Tony put his arms around Steve’s neck and lay pressed up against his back.  “‘Kay.  ‘Kay, I’ll tell you what to write.”
remember after I really turn the charm on tomorrow.”
for it a little.
“You lost six hours?”
Now, a tiny flare of jealousy flashed through Tony’s heart.  He stomped it out quickly, but a spark remained, especially when Steve caught Sam’s eye and beckoned him forward.  Sam went, his own eyes tearful, and dropped to one knee beside the chair.  Steve loosed one arm from Nat’s waist and pulled Sam to him, clutching him close.
“No, come on. You’re not gonna-”
“Steve?”
Tony stepped away, relinquishing Steve’s closeness and heat reluctantly.  “Ha. Ha.  You’re hilarious.”  He reached into his pocket and pulled out a silver lighter.  T.S. was engraved on it in a swirl of scrollwork.  He’d had it since he was seventeen.  Had used it to light cigarettes, and hash-pipes, and on more than one occasion, used it to cook heroin in a silver spoon.  He didn’t use it much anymore.  The last time had been to light candles on some politician’s kid’s birthday cake, but he kept it with him.  Not as a good-luck charm, but as a way to remember how far he’d come since he got it.  Now he tossed it unceremoniously to Steve who caught it one-handed.
Howard shook his head and smiled a little. “You don’t have to say anything, kiddo. I’m the one who needs to say things. A while back someone told me to call you. To talk to you. And he was right. Everything he said was right, but I couldn’t do it. I didn’t feel like I had anything to offer you. Nothing that would mean enough.” He nodded at the coin in Tony’s hand. “That’s when I decided to do that. I should have given it to you when I got it, but I was still afraid it wasn’t enough. It’s still not enough. I know that. I know it doesn’t make up for everything, Tony--for
Tony reached out and took Steve’s hand. Steve let him, but he seemed reluctant--like maybe he was afraid he’d get burned. “Why do you say that?” Tony asked, and brought the hand to his mouth. He kissed it lingeringly, relishing the rasp of the callouses on the fingertips, the smooth palm.
"What?" Steve asked.
“It wasn’t.”
“Sorry.” Tony. God. And he had not thought that was possible. Of all the people in the world, how could
“I--” he began, then his eyes were suddenly on Tony’s, big, blue, terrified.  “Tony,” he whispered,
“It’s true.  I’m awful without them.  Maybe they’ll make me better.”
The good stuff and the bad stuff.
“Shut up,” she whispered.
“I know.  I’m sorry.”
The tape sat on the little table next to the punching bags.  Steve grabbed it and began winding it over his knuckles.  As he did, he thought of the feeling that had slammed up his arm when he touched Stormbreaker.  In a way, it had been very much like the feeling he’d had when Tony had bandaged his hands so long ago.  Raw, powerful, hungry.  He remembered wondering what it would have been like if he had slid his arm around Tony and kissed him.  He wondered now if he had gripped the handle of the axe, would he have been able to lift it?
“But then you said
“She doesn’t talk to me, so I try not to speak when she’s here.”
” he said bitterly, gesturing to the files, “I still think you deserve it.”
“No. It’s three am. And one of us has to be to work at six.”
Natasha shook her head and released their hands.  She blinked rapidly, then let out a breath.  “Alright, guys,” she said brightly.  “Let’s go.”
Steve blinked up at him, lifted his head as if coming out of a dream. “Tony?” he asked, his voice rough with emotion or sleep. Tony didn’t know which.
“I’m sorry, too.”
have looked up. He was here with Natasha and a few of her other friends, celebrating Nat’s birthday. They were drinking, and laughing, and dancing, all of them having fun. Tony was sitting at their table, sipping his drink. His boyfriend, Josh, was curled around him, whispering in his ear. Beneath the table, Josh’s hand was resting high up on his thigh, massaging it a little, and Tony was feeling pretty good. Calm. Comfortable. Not hard, but feeling pretty confident that he could get there whenever he and Josh finally decided to leave. They had a suite at a hotel downtown. They’d already defiled the bed and the shower. He thought the sofa--and maybe the balcony, in spite of the chilly night air--might be on tonight’s itinerary.
“I’ll talk to Strange.  He’s a super-type.  He’ll get it.  I just need to convince him, then he can convince the rest of them.”
“Nebula was able to give us some insight.”  Rhodey gestured to the alien/robot Nat had talked about.  Steve wasn’t one hundred percent sure which she was either.
Steve kissed him again. Softly. Gently. “But we always rushed that part, Tony. We had to. If we wanted it at all, we had to.”
“What are you doing?” he asked.
“You were a kid.”
without clearing it with her first.” He bit Steve’s ear lobe. “And, you’re well on your way too, I’m afraid. I saw how you were with her tonight.”
“Me too, baby.”
To those who have read my previous series: You have more right to be pissed off at me than anyone. I am so so sorry! When the idea came to have Thaddeus Ross be Steve's secret boyfriend, I was appalled at myself. I still am.
,” Tony said, then cocked his head. “You didn’t, did you? Call me? And I missed it?”
Steve nodded.  “Okay.”
“Tony said it was his fault,” Sarah said after Steve stopped talking long enough to sip his tea. “He said you did because of him. And his father.”
“What?  When?  I think I’d remember that.”
You’re done.”
Steve leaned close enough to press his lips against Tony’s. He’d meant to only do it once, but it turned into a few more. “Yeah,” he said, then smiled, resting his chin on Tony’s chest again. He stayed within easy kissing-distance, though. His tactical brain had calculated that distance in .5 seconds, and he used it to its full advantage. “It’s just nice hearing you are too.”
“I will,” Tony assured him, running his fingers up and down his arm.  They only went so far.  His cast was in the way, still, but it was far enough to make Steve shiver.  Tony smiled, loving that.  “What do you do?”
“Why can’t you just ever let us be happy for a minute?”
“Okay.”
I don’t want to go.
, then opened the door.
“I’m sorry?” Steve asked, but she ignored him and cut her gaze to Tony.  He didn't look at her, but when she went to his side, he touched the cool blue of her hand.
Tony looked at the image of Steve sleeping on his bunk.  That worried look was still on his face, and it was driving Tony to distraction.  He wanted to touch those lines and soothe them away, kiss those parted lips until he slept soundly again.  “I’ll tell you what he wouldn’t say,” Tony said.  “He
“But what?”
“What?”
He held the receiver to his ear. It was eleven o’clock here, which meant nine o’clock in California. That seemed like a perfect time to pour his heart out.
Tony looked at him again, the wheels still turning. He looked a little thrown, the usual Tony Stark poise seemed a little scattered. Steve wasn’t quite sure how he felt about it. On one hand, he liked it. He liked that Tony seemed as distressed as he had felt walking in here and seeing his Tony wrapped around somebody else. It felt good. Like justice. But, on the other hand, he hated it a little too. Tony was supposed to be cool and easy. He wasn’t supposed to get flustered over things. He wasn’t like Steve. Tony had been
“How was work, Mom?”
Tony reached for him, but Steve pulled back slightly.  He tried again, and Steve pulled back again, keeping his mouth barely out of reach.
“What happened?” Steve whispered, frightened.  “Tony?  Are you okay?  What--You’re hurt.”
Steve held him tighter.  “Okay.”
Tony flushed with shame.  It had been pretty one-sided lately.  He knew that.  “You don’t have to stay.  I’m fine.”
Sam eyed him speculatively.  “Can I ask--were you two, you know,
“That’s not charm.  That’s ass-holery.”
Steve nodded again. Sighed. Nat and Clint were a good team. He paired well with either one whenever he was position one, but the two of them together were like a well-oiled machine. He was glad they were on this. If he couldn’t be in control, they were the next best option. “Okay. Keep me in the loop.”
Steve smiled.  “Have it your way, Stark.”
Sam gave him a quizzical look.  “Don’t you?”
words with ease.
“Are you okay?” Steve asked, his eyes flashed in the semi-gloom, searching Tony’s.  Those three worry-lines were between his brows.
She turned to him, and there were tears in the corners of her eyes.  She touched his hand consolingly.  “He won’t,” she said.
Steve laughed a little and put his arms around Sam. “You’ll take care of her, won’t you?” Steve whispered in his ear.
Steve finished off his whiskey and set the glass aside. It wasn’t his first of the night--or the fifth--but he barely felt any buzz at all. Thanks to Erskine, and Howard of course, it would probably take double the amount to make him feel anything. Usually that was a blessing, but on nights like tonight he would gladly trade a little “super-soldier” just to feel a bit tipsy.
“You keep saying that,” Steve said.  “I keep doing things, and you keep saying that.  When’s it going to stop being okay?”
Steve bristled, his face turning hard. Sam put his hand on his shoulder and gripped it tight. “Okay,” Steve said, trying to keep his voice steady. “But she’d be able to rest at home, too.”
Steve snorted, his eyes drifting closed once more.  “‘Few hundred thousand’?” he teased, and yawned before settling himself completely against Tony’s side.  “That’s it?”
“What’s changed since then?” Sam asked.
“I hope so,” he said. “That doctor-” and his voice turned hard. Cold. “-that doctor didn’t seem to think I knew jack-shit about what she needs. He acted like I was...like I couldn’t
“I’m good.”
“W-what?”
“Yeah?”
Tears welled in Wanda’s eyes and when Steve sighed in sheer gladness and pulled her to him, they broke free.
made it through.
Steve jerked awake.  He winced at the twinge in his lower back.  He was lying half on a bed, half on a chair.  His hands clutched great handfuls of fabric--cheap, lightweight hospital blankets.  Light years from the cloud-like 1000 thread-count Egyptian cotton sheets Tony insisted on having in their bed.  From the heavy, warm cocoon of the hand-made quilt that lay over-top those sheets. But it was there, it was
“Clint and I are dropping Laura and Nathaniel off at home then going to Brazil.”
He sat on the floor next to Morgan and picked up his own crayon. She sat beside him, pressed against his side. “Look, Grandpa Howard,” she said, and showed him the picture she had colored before.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I just don’t think she seems like your type.”  He gulped his coffee and put the cup on the counter with a loud clunk.  “Don’t get me wrong, she’s got assets,” he said, sketching a little hourglass shape in the air, “but I think she might be more than you can handle.”
“Really?” Tony cocked a skeptical brow then shook his head.  “Go on, then, soldier.  Make me proud.”
“They can’t just do that, Nat,” he said, still holding the arrow at the ready.  “They can’t just be allowed to do that.  To anyone.”
The leader took a step forward.  He had a pleasant face, blue-eyed, blond.  Though not nearly as tall or broad as Steve, they had a similar look, like distant cousins, maybe.  He looked at Tony,
“See?” Tony said.  “That’s not so bad, is it?”
But, that was over now.  Even when he came back from prison, he could never let himself come here again.  Tony deserved more.  Better.
Steve smiled in the low light.  He was back-lit by the guttering fire, his face bathed in candlelight.  He appeared both ephemeral and earthy, like one of the fae come to life.  “We have come a long way.”
He texted him again.
“I told you I”m not going to watch that, Tony,” Steve warned.  “It glorifies mafia violence.  I saw enough of that in the neighborhood when I was a kid.”
“Well, you’re making
Really going to end it on the next chapter. I know I've said that before, but I'm serious this time! I know I've said THAT before too, but...
“I know.”
Steve nodded reluctantly. He didn’t want to be selfish. This was for his mother. If she needed it, and it was available to her, he’d take it. And fuck his own feelings. This was for her. All for her. “Okay. Can I see her? I wanna see her.”
"Oh, hell, yeah.  You should see this guy."  Tony blinked, squeezed his eyes shut, then opened them again.   "You're not so bad yourself. Who are you again?"
"Alive."
“Sure am, kid.”
Strange paused.  Sighed.  “I don’t want to believe it.  But Baxter has been thoroughly checked out.  And what would be his motivation for lying?"
Steve smiled again. God, it made him look so young. Like a kid just out of basic training. “Yes, sir,” he said, and snapped off a little salute. It made Tony smile. Made him feel like a kid again himself.
He thought about it for a minute. Thought about the ‘but’ that seemed to hover over every interaction, every thought he had about a life with Tony and Morgan in it. He thought about it, but he couldn’t quite put a finger on what it was. Why he still had reservations about this. Why he couldn’t jump in with both feet the way Sarah, and Sam, and Tony wanted him to do.
"Yeah," Steve agreed. "Next time."
Strange turned on his heel and walked away, winding through the crowded city sidewalk like he didn’t have a care in the world.  Maybe he didn’t.  Maybe he was one of the lucky people who really didn’t give a shit what people thought of him.  Tony could fake it with the best of them, but he cared.  Too much, probably.
make a difference.
Jeff nodded.  “He’s right.  That was a great frame.  Textbook.”
“What?” Tony asked.
He’d put a restriction on Pepper’s access too.  Just in case.  He’d once said that she had paid her dues when it came to him.  That hadn’t changed.  FRIDAY said she’d been by twice.  No status change.  She went away upset.  But, at least she went away.
“Steve-”
Tony nodded.  “Okay, then.  Fatted calf at eight a.m. sharp.”
“Take care, Miss FRIDAY.”  He waited, then started out the door.
The radio let out a burst of static and cut out.
Steve let out a shuddering breath.  “He wants to see me.”
“FRIDAY, please ignore all requests from Captain Rogers until further notice.”
A warrior's feast, then cuddles, then, you know, more angst...
“You do that,” Steve snapped back.
He sighed again. All those new-agey types might actually have something. Existence really might be a wheel. Things certainly did seem like they had a way of spinning back to the original point.  Tony rested his head against Steve’s. “Guess we don’t really have time for a belated Valentine’s date, after all. I’m sorry.”
“You got it, boss.”
“I’m not going to say no.”
And Steve felt his resistances start to crumble. How could they not? “Well…”
“I guess so.”
“So,” Tony sighed. “What do we do about this?”
“After the party.”
“I should have offered to get them a room.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve said, trying to keep his voice steady. “I’m so sorry, Pietro. I wanted to love you. I tried to love you. I tried so fucking hard.”
, not just him.  Not like the moon landing, or the JFK assassination, or the 9/11 attacks.  Now, with the TV on, and a fire in the hearth, and Tony’s head on his shoulder, he finally felt like he was a part of things.  He finally felt like he belonged in this world again.  Even if this world had stories about inequality, and climate change, and presidential scandals.
He looked at Steve, one eyebrow raised, and Steve found himself shaking his head from side to side. “No,” he answered, unsure of what he was even saying, just letting his instincts take this one. “Not a puppet-guy.”
he thought crazily.  “On closer inspection,” he said instead, “it seemed inappropriate to share.”
Tony stood up.  He didn’t have an umbrella, and the rain was starting to fall harder.  Five minutes.  He’d give Ross five minutes, and then he’d give up and go home.  Steve would be home by now.  Waiting for him.  Whatever else he was doing, working out, reading, laundry, whatever, what he was really doing, was waiting for Tony.  He knew that was true because that’s what

. I’ll stock the cereal.”
“His heart rate spiked.  His blood pressure shot up.  And he’s not in his wheelchair.”
Steve smiled against his chest, and Tony felt relief crash over him. “No,” Steve mumbled. “Not broken. ‘M good.” He snuggled closer into Tony’s arms. “Better.”
He stopped doing that because he knew. Deep down, he always knew.
Steve sighed, looking as if he were trying very hard to let himself be convinced.  “Really?” he asked.  “‘Cause I don’t want to make you uncomfortable.  I’d never want to make you uncomfortable.”
. ‘I see Tony Stark got himself a pretty guy to hang off his arm.’ ‘Oh yeah? What does he do?’ ‘Oh, you know. He’s into
He started gathering everything back up, folding old t-shirts and tucking photos back into the drawers.
“But--”
“That’s not me anymore.”
“When’d you get up?”
Steve smiled.  “What are we doing tonight?”
And for four hours, Steve sat silently going crazy.
“How is he?”
But, saying no had thrown him off balance, so when Dr. Greene, his psychiatrist, had come in, he’d requested to see him and patiently explained what happened.  Strange had been wrong.  He hadn’t “reported” his friends--he’d went to his session.  He’d assumed his words would fall under doctor-patient privilege, but apparently, Dr. Greene had not felt the same.  And now, here was Thaddeus Ross standing in Dr. Greene’s office screaming at Stephen Strange and Nick Fury.  And it all boiled down to the Accords.  Again.  And his hatred of Steve Rogers.  Again.  And his desire to see him pay for what he’d done so long ago.
“What else?”
Christ, he hoped so.
“Which part?”
Tony sighed again, but this time it was okay. This time it was just a soft whisper of air leaving his lungs. Steve felt the caress of it on his cheek as Tony leaned a little closer to him. “Okay,” he said, and that anxious tone was gone. Now his voice was gentle and hazy, like a pastel-colored sunrise, and Steve found himself leaning into that, just as Tony was leaning into him. Closer. Closer. Steve tilted his head just a little, just so his nose wouldn’t bump into Tony’s, then closed his eyes as their lips finally touched.
Steve sighed.  “Fine,” he grumbled.  “But you’re coming, right?  To the reception?”
“Well, I’m sure his parents would be very proud of him for being polite.”
Steve blinked a few times fast, trying to clear his eyes in case it was just a trick of the light and this was some other guy standing here looking anxiously down at him. But it must not have been. Tony still stayed Tony. Slim, elegant even in his t-shirt and jeans, eyes dark and watchful. In a word--beautiful.
“Stop talking.”
feeling a little better. Just one more thing Steve had given him. One more thing Tony owed him for. But that was for later. Right now, he just squeezed Steve tight-tight-tight, lifted his head and kissed him. “Uh-huh,” he said. “Feed me.”
Steve smiled and looked down at his hand.  “It’s lonely in here.  At least in the...other one there was no prospect of seeing anyone.  I was alone.  I knew it.  That was part of the deal I made and I was able to prepare myself for that.  But here.”
“How we looking, FRI?” Tony muttered, and her voice came through his earpiece.
“‘They’?”
Tony bent over and kissed him. It was soft, sweet. “I’m going to help you with that now, okay?” he said. “No more sleepless nights. No more nightmares. Okay?”
He pulled away from Tony’s touch, his eyes glazing over.  “No,” he said.  “Sam and Wanda took me for my birthday one year.  I was--” his thumb crept to his mouth and he chewed the nail for a second before continuing. “--having a rough time.  Nat wasn’t there, and they wanted to do something nice.”
“Most stubborn, you mean.”
“Good.”
Even if he thought apple pie in October was blasphemy.
“Mmm. Can’t. I’ve got work all day, then evening classes.”
“I shoulda--”
He stilled instantly.
“Eight?” she asked, cocking an eyebrow. “I thought you couldn’t get drunk.”
. That’s the most important thing.”
Steve closed his eyes briefly, and when he opened them again, they were filled with wonder, awe, pain. Love. “‘Cause look at you,” he said softly. “I’ve been halfway around the world, Tony. I’ve seen things that,” he shook his head, “things that took my breath away. Both good and bad. But I’ve never seen anything--
When he could put it off no longer, Steve walked down the hallway to his room.  He sighed and rested his hand on the doorknob.  He thought of Tony again down in the gym with Rhodey.  He wondered if they were having a drink and talking about old times, reminiscing about stories that were shared just between the two of them, or if they were talking about tomorrow and what would happen.  If they won, Bucky would come home.  So would Pepper.  Where would that leave this thing between them?  This tiny, flickering candle flame they’d lit tonight?  Steve could still smell Tony on his clothes, still taste him on his tongue, could he give that up?  He’d lost Peggy when he went into the ice, his one chance at happiness.  Could he lose Tony too?
“Guess that’s true,” Steve agreed, then ran a hand nervously through his hair. “Feels a little weird.”
he here?  There seemed to be no answer in his head.  Nothing at all in his head except the thought of Pepper and old insect-boy all over each other in some sex dungeon.  Because this place had a sex dungeon.  Look at it.  Of fucking course it did.
Sam nodded. “Yeah. They want a year of it to get into the physical therapy program at NYU.”
“That’s not what Tony said.”
“Okay, Tony.”
“Hello, Miss Potts.”
They lay together afterward. Bucky and Nat’s bed was larger than Steve’s single one, but it didn’t really matter. They still crowded together on one side, leaving the other untouched. Neither of them thought about it. It just happened. It was just muscle memory.
Secretary of State, General Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross’ home was as grand as any politicians’ could ever hope to be.  It was three-storeys, pillared, gambreled and gabled with an honest to god turret.  It was enough to give any fan of Victorian architecture wet dreams for a month.
“So, after Christmas?”
“Tony.  I can’t while you’re doing that.”
“No good conversation has ever had those words in it.”
Tony stepped closer, and Steve resisted the urge to take a step backward, to keep the same distance between them. That scent. That scent of secrets and spice and oak that Steve remembered so well from before--from every before they’d ever had, save the very first one--made its way toward him and enveloped him in its comforting familiarity, and he wanted to just go to him. Just go to him and fall into his arms. Just wrap himself up in him and never ever move again. But he couldn’t. God. He couldn’t.
No matter what anyone said.
“No changes to Captain Rogers’ contact for 713-B, boss.”
Tony kissed his eyes, his cheek.  “Well, now you’re just being a smart-ass.”
Tony stepped closer.  That dawning look in his eyes had been replaced by something else, something hot and knowing.  “You’re killing me with that look, soldier,” he said.  “Whatever puppy dog you borrowed that from needs to be put down Old-Yeller-style ASAP.  It’s clearly a threat to national security.”
Steve pulled away. The other recruits were shuffling toward the bus now, and Steve looked at his watch. 6:01. He drew in a deep breath, let it shakily out. The nerves were there. The fear settling in.
But was it just from Thad Ross, or had someone else taken what they
“Where do you want me?” Steve whispered.
Tony got up, made coffee, showered, shaved, brushed his teeth, got dressed. Fridays were a short day at the office. When he’d started SI, he’d vowed to let his people leave early on Fridays so they could get an early start on their weekend. He thought it would make them happy and more productive during the week. His father called him a fool.
Steve shook his head slowly from side to side. “No. No, I shouldn’t be with you either. Just ask your dad.”
Tony took a step closer.  “I don’t think they’d give fuck one.  In fact, I think they’d be
“I always listen.”
Steve nodded again.  His face was still solemn, but some of that bad feeling in the pit of Tony’s stomach went away anyway.  Maybe this would still be alright.  Maybe it wasn’t ruined yet.
Steve shrugged. “Don’t know. My plane leaves at eight, but I told Bucky I’d be at the airport at five. Just to be sure.”
“So, tell me what’s going on with you.”
Steve felt a little bad about that thought as soon as it was fully formed in his mind.  The phone-guy wasn’t the only one who would buckle under the weight of Tony’s charisma.  As Steve looked at Tony’s face, the soft mouth, the drawn eyebrows, he knew Tony would buckle, himself.  He did it all the time.
“Yeah.”
Then he left.
Steve laughed under his breath. He took a step away from Tony’s side, but kept hold of his hand, holding it like a lifeline. “Are you sure you don’t mind if I shower?”
Steve held out the bills one more time.  “Please?”
She straightened her spine.  Lifted her head.  “I’m fine, Tony.”
He thought about texting him back, asking if he was okay, if
“Do you know the equations when working with parabolic motion?”
“Not to me.  But I’m not his psychiatrist.  They’re actually considering some kind of hypno-therapy.  I’m not sure I approve, but…” he trailed off into a disgruntled silence.
Tony shook his head, his eyes glinting with an impish inner light. He stroked his own cock languidly. “I didn’t hear any complaining," he said.
have been looking,
Sam reached out and clasped his shoulder.  “Don’t beat yourself up.  This isn’t your fault,” he said, and Tony felt a surge of gratitude.  No wonder Steve loved this guy so much.
"On my way there.  How is he?"
“Do you want to eat first?”
Tony’s lids closed and when they opened, those eyes rested on Steve’s at last.  Sad and older, yes, that was true, but Steve saw pure, clean hate there too, and a swirl of fear.  Those things had not been there for Nat.  Certainly not for Bruce or Rhodey, but for Steve, Steve who had lied, Steve who had betrayed, Steve who had nearly killed him, in those eyes, it was all he could see.
“Christ, Wilson,” Tony said, and Sam nodded.
Tony took a step back. He had to. If he didn’t, there was no way in hell he would be able to walk out the door. He’d just drag Steve up to his room and get to the
“He wants
“Yes, Tony?”
Tony put his hand on the back of Steve’s neck. “No. No, baby, you are.”
A furry paw smacked his forearm.  Steve looked over and Rocket jerked his head at Rhodey.
“I left a bowl of fruit for you in the fridge upstairs,” he said seriously. “And there are bagels and cream cheese too.
McDonald’s now,” he said innocently. “I’m sure we can still go to the others, but I think that one’s off-limits. At least...according to the manager.”
And Tony didn’t even look his way.
He found himself wondering, not for the first time, but surely the most intently, what kind of lover Steve would be.  Would he be slow and steady like he was in his day-to-day actions?  Careful, considerate, kind, cherishing every touch, every breath, every moan?  Or would he be like he was on the battlefield, a caged tiger set free at last to snarl and bite and claw?   Smooth muscles flexing, teeth bared, intense, frenzied, doing anything to achieve his goal, winning at whatever cost?
Jack studied him for a minute, and Steve let him. It was okay. He really did understand. Might have felt a little worried himself, if he was Jack. Steve wasn’t worried, though. Jack was a small guy. Steve wasn’t. And he was trained in combat. He thought he could handle anything Jack could throw at him, if he was that kind of guy. And if there was a small part of him that almost wished Jack was a bad guy, a guy that trolled the bars looking for an unsuspecting mark to take back to his lair to torment and murder...well, then he still wasn’t worried.
Steve nodded. “Even if it’s just a cigarette.”
Steve laughed again, and even through his irritation, Tony felt warmer. Happier. Happier than he’d ever been in his entire life.
“Shouldn’t you pinch me?”
Steve sat up, and Tony slipped out from under him and dropped to his knees, his fingers already working the buckle on Steve’s belt, then the button on his jeans. “Tony-” Steve began, and then stopped talking as the sensation of Tony’s mouth on him overwhelmed any and all words he could have possibly spoken. He moaned instead, and put his hand in Tony’s hair, running it gently through his fingers. His head fell back against the couch cushions. His breath came in short, hard gasps as Tony ran his lips and tongue over the hardness of his cock, his hand grasping wherever his mouth wouldn’t reach.
for as long as you could, and when you stepped out--by Time’s decision, or your own--you did it with a little sigh. And so what if that sigh was one of relief? It didn’t hurt anybody. There was no one there to hurt.
Steve climbed into bed and laid down next to him again. He kissed his shoulder. His neck. Then lay back on the pillow. “I’m glad you came here tonight.”
She smiled and opened the door.  “Hey.”
“I don’t know.  Do you?”
He laughed again and hugged her. Christ, she was too much like him for comfort. He loved it. “What do you say we go for a walk, huh?”
“Later, Tony.”
Tony followed her troubled gaze.  Bruce was pushing the chair.  Steve didn’t seem to mind, content to just ride, chatting animatedly.  Tony felt a tug of jealousy...
“Wait. Are you breaking up with me?”
She scrutinized him for a moment, her sharp eyes boring into his. He let her. He owed her that after everything he'd put her through. Finally, she nodded, satisfied with what she saw, at least for now. “Alright. Go shower, then come help me.”
on your side, but baby--”
“You don’t know what I said?”
“But I tried to tell you earlier, Tony, that’s not me now.”  He looked up at last.  His eyes were sad and terribly empty.  “I’m not worth your time.”  Tony winced and Steve nodded like he had agreed with him.  “I don’t have anything to offer you.  Not anymore.”
He laughed and rested his cheek on her head.  “The good old days.”
She took his hand.  “I know.”
The hand shook him again, and a voice said his name-- “Steve.”
“Perfect,” Tony said, and turned to Steve. He flashed him “The Smile”. Steve felt his stomach flip over lazily. “What do you say, Steven? You don’t mind if I take your other boyfriend to the museum tomorrow, do you?”
Occasionally, someone would mention him.  They never seemed to realize that the man they despised was sitting within their circle.  He didn’t try to disguise himself, but they never noticed.  Their grief was too deep, he believed.  It blinded them.
“I can’t.  I’ve still got some stuff to go over.  I need to study the schematics for the ship that Nebula gave us.”
“Yes, sir.”
Thanks for reading! Next chapter up in a few days, I hope.
Steve shook his head. “I’m fine.”
Tony put his tablet on the nightstand.  He turned on his side, looking up at Steve.  He had a dreamy look on his face.  Like he wasn’t sure if this was real or not.  Maybe he wasn’t.  Maybe part of him still believed he was back in that prison cell.  Maybe part of him would always believe that.
“Will you say that again, Tony?”
“It’s okay,” he said, and turned to find his own shirt. “It’s okay.”
“You need to come with me, son.”
“Is it?  He tried to kill someone.  The average sentence for second-degree attempted murder is ten to fifteen.  I thought I was being very generous.”
Tony helped her move him to the couch then gave her a blanket as she curled up in Tony’s old, ugly, surprisingly comfy recliner.
“Not often,” she said softly. “Every couple of months. Just for a minute or two.” She frowned, her face filled with sorrow. “I’ll stop if it bothers you,” she said. “I’ll tell him-”
Thank you for reading and commenting!❤️❤️❤️
“Uh-uh.”
“Maybe we haven’t said it enough.”
“I’ve been thinking about you.  A lot.”
“Here?” he asked.
But all that was for later.  Right now, Steve was here.
Tony imagined him reading that; his perfect white teeth, his soft, red lips curving upward.
Tony's hand went to Steve's hair.  They had always been very physical with each other--touching, kissing whenever they could, but now it was almost like a compulsion for both of them.  Ever since Steve's admission about what was happening to him, neither one felt right if they weren't touching the other. Steve never even thought about co-dependency anymore.  Who gave a shit about buzz-words in the face of actual, impending death? All he cared about was being as close to Tony as he could, as often as he could. Tony had been right when he'd said Jeff and Jen should have had another twenty-five years.  It wasn't fair. Shuri had given him eight. An
to Tony.  Almost as if, on some other level, in some other dimension, they had been happening all along, and their physical bodies were just finally catching up to what their spirits had always been doing.

“He went out strong,” she said.
Sarah leaned against him, holding his arm. “Happy birthday, sweetheart,” she whispered.
“How’d you get in?”
“Captain Rogers, if you could get Mr. Stark’s attention, please?”
A uniformed officer, not the same one who had booked them, but another guy, a younger guy, came up to the cell. “Tony Stark and Sam Wilson.”
“Yeah,” Steve agreed immediately, his eyes roving over the car again.  “Yeah.  Yes.  Let’s do that.”
The woman at the desk looked up expectantly when he reached the desk. “What can I do for you?” she asked.
“You say that now, but what about in a year?”
Tony looked at them longingly, wishing to Christ he could just do that. That it could be that easy for him. And the bitch of it was,
They christened the pool with a party full of margaritas and nachos and dancing and, of course, swimming. Tony indulged himself in everything but the margaritas. Just because Steve wasn’t looking out for his refreshment needs anymore didn’t mean he’d gone back to his old ways. He was still a grown-up, after all. He could get his own drinks. It wasn’t rocket science to keep a cooler full of water and soda. Sure, it might take a little more planning than he was used to, but he could do it. He ran a multi-billion dollar company, he could remember to have J put in an order for a couple cases of water, and it wasn’t like it was difficult to get somebody to help haul it up the stairs. In fact, that might have been the easiest part. Bruce was always willing to grab the other handle of a cooler and help him wrangle it, and Thor was even easier. All Tony had to do was say, “Hey, I’ll bet you can’t lift that one-handed,” and it practically flew up the stairs. Tony was positive Thor would do it if he just asked him nicely, but this way was more fun. It got Tony what he wanted and gave Thor some bragging rights. It was a win-win.
.--to the lonely, cold, frightening time he’d spent at The Raft.  It’s what she wanted for Ross.  To be treated the same.  To be pumped full of drugs until he barely knew his own name, then shoved away in a dark, dank hole.  It was what he deserved.  Better than he deserved.  Strange had thought of this.  What they were doing now.  Coming in here, forcibly removing Ross from the house, threatening him, then bringing him publicly, loudly to justice for his crimes.
Steve looked at him, scandalized.  “Don’t say that, Tony.  Chagall was a
Steve reached for Tony’s hand. He held his fingers and chafed them softly between his own. “Tony,” he said earnestly, “I want you to meet my mom. I do. I really, really do, but…”
, he thought.
He got in, and Tony drove them home, guiding the car with his usual confidence. Morgan chattered for a while in the back seat, bouncing the stuffed shark Steve had bought for her in the gift shop along the back of Steve’s seat, bopping him in the head with it every once in a while. The closer they got to home though, the quieter she got, and as Tony pulled into the parking garage under his building, Steve glanced back and saw she was asleep. Her head was cocked to the side, dark hair in her eyes, the shark hugged tightly in her arms.
“I’m sorry,” she said quietly.
He turned and left the room.
“What?” Tony said, bouncing the cat like it was a baby.  It purred in his arms, all the while looking at Steve like it wanted to kill him.
He tried.
He ordered a cup of coffee and took a seat by the window.  He was nervous, but not overly so.  He, Nat, and a very reluctant Bruce, had all agreed if Strange said no, they’d just break into the facility and let Wanda work her mojo.  It wasn’t like Steve was being held captive.  It was a hospital not a prison.  It was private property, sure, but Tony had never met an administrator, hospital or otherwise, who was immune to cash being thrown at them.  If somebody got too upset, he’d just offer them a new wing.  A few million and they’d be in the clear.  And they’d help Steve.  That was the goal here.  Getting Steve better.  Everyone, including Stephen Strange, agreed on that, if nothing else.
Tony’s heart sped up now while Steve kissed him. He felt it thumping in his chest, in his pulse points, and he had a sudden, intense urge to climb up into Steve’s lap and just keep going. Damn the time, and damn the surroundings. He just wanted to press against Steve--his
She grabbed a water bottle and a towel from the table.  She took a swallow and handed him the bottle.  He drank deeply.
“I don’t want to talk about it.”
“You’re certainly not rushing to change my mind, are you?”
“You don’t need to discuss his treatment with me, Stephen, just his welfare.”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“Are you feeling better now?”
“Yeah.  But pizza first, right?” Steve asked.  “I’m starving.”
“You just keep talking, Cap,” Tony said.  “Every word you say is proving my point.”
really nice right here.”
He lashed out, driving from the hip, and hit the mirror with his fist.  It shattered on impact, the glass fairly exploding against his skin.
Tony sighed, still holding him.  “You could use mine.”
(See the end of the chapter for
talk whenever it gave him a malice-filled look or jumped onto his shoulder whenever he tried to touch Tony, but that’s because Tony was there, and he didn’t want to end up having the conversation they were now, in fact, having.
Steve returned the nod. “I love you.”
He stopped and bought a newspaper on the way back. There was a flower stand right next to the newsstand. He bought a small bouquet. He thought it was a little silly, but he did it.
, whenever he wanted.  It was surreal, like an Edvard Munch painting brought to life.  No man should ever expect this much happiness.  It would drive him mad trying to achieve it.  But here it was, sitting in his lap, smelling like some fancy body wash and mint toothpaste, and running calloused, rough fingers over his back and kissing his jaw, and Steve just held on tighter, not wanting to let go.  Not wanting to ever let go.
“You shouldn’t nap so close to bedtime.”
Tony finally found his voice.  “It’s not
Tony went home after lunch. Howard shook his hand at the car door and grasped his shoulder. It had been as close to a hug as they had probably ever gotten, and Tony left feeling really good. Optimistic.
So, as much as it stung, he said no.  And Tony had left.  And his parting words had been worse than the razor sliding across his throat.  He could only hope that someday Tony would understand why he’d done it.
Tony refused to take the bait.  Because this was what Ross did.  How he operated.  He got inside a person’s head and exploited any weakness he could find.  The proof was right there still hovering in the air next to Tony--Baxter’s files continuously scrolling.
“Yeah,” Bucky scoffed. “He fucking wishes.”
Bruce looked at the floor, his hands on his hips.  His brow was furrowed, his glasses sitting precariously on the tip of his nose.  He looked lost in thought, almost as though he were debating with himself.
“And how do you propose we do that, Steven?”
Tony smiled at her.  "He used to talk about it sometimes."
“Kick ‘em out.”
It was early, but Tony had sunglasses on already. Steve thought it was partly the burgeoning sunrise, partly for style, and partly for any emotions he might want to hide. They’d said a private good-bye that morning, once in bed and once in the shower, then shared a long, fierce kiss before finally leaving to go pick Sarah up, but there were still tears brewing behind Steve’s own eyes. Tony was better at holding them back, but Steve thought that was definitely part of the reason he was wearing them. For insurance.
“Do you want to go to the diner? Or come over here or something?”
He closed his eyes as Steve spoke.
, he thought, watching as Tony reached the ground, and waved up at him again before disappearing inside the building.
“Ross and I talked about that, honey,” Nat assured him.  “I’m heading that up personally.”
Steve and his old-fashioned ideas.
“I don’t want you to either.”
Steve looked away, giving them their moment, and looked up at Tony again.  Tony gazed steadily back, grounding him in this whirlwind of emotion he was lost in.  Giving him something solid to hold onto, and Steve had never loved him more than he did in that moment.  Tony must have felt it, because he drew in a deep breath, blew it out, and cocked his eyebrow at Steve.  Steve grinned at him, utterly lost in his love for him, for Natasha, for Bruce, and Clint, and everyone else around them.  His family.
“I’ll just call you in sick.”
“We’ll be okay,” he said.
“No, it’s not.”
She laughed, surprised, and slid into the car.  “Good-bye, Tony.”
“I’ll call.”
Steve tugged Tony’s t-shirt and shook his head.  “It doesn’t matter.  Come here.”
“There,” she said. “All better. Okay?”
“I don’t want to fight either.”  He smoothed his fingers along the back of Steve’s neck.  “I know we don’t see eye-to-eye but I’m with you on this, baby, okay?  There’s too much at stake for us to be at odds.”
Even though, at the moment, Steve almost wished he didn’t.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh. Uh-huh.”
“You’re a master tactician,” he said quietly. “You can figure-”
. Remember?”
“Not even when your boyfriend’s about to get jumped by someone else?”
Yeah, it was hell, alright.
She made a soft sound of admonishment. “You’re cool, honey.”
Scared, too, that that might
“She’s having a baby,” Tony sighed. “I-
“Thanks for getting the groceries,” Steve was saying.  “Sorry I haven’t--” but then Tony was kissing him, and all thought was driven out of his head.
Tony ignored him.
“‘Kay.”
for forty-whatever-but-who’s-counting years?  And how could he exist now knowing that was a possibility?  That pouty little whine, that frown?  How would he ever be able to get out of bed again?
Steve smiled guiltily.  “No.”
“I promise, Tony,” Steve said, drawing back to look into his eyes again. Tony’s breath hitched in his chest, and Steve cupped his cheek. “Tony. I mean it. I promise.”
“Me too.”
He opened up his contacts and found Tony’s name. He smiled a little. It had taken him a minute to find it after Tony typed it in that first night.
“A lot older than that.”
“There’s only one bathroom, Tony.”
“I’m not shocked,” he said.
Steve dropped his head onto Tony’s shoulder.  “I’ll be right behind you,” he whispered, and then Tony was kissing him, and everything was better.  Everything was alright.
"Oh god, baby, don't stop."
be doing here to see
“That’s not what I asked.”
Home sounded good.
Tony looked at him.  A swarm of emotions engulfed him--dread, fear, hope.  “Okay,” he said slowly.
“Come on, it’s fun.”
Tony nudged the pizza.  “Have some of this, first,” he said, his voice a bed-ready whisper.  “You’re starving, remember?”
He held out his hand to her.  “Come here, red.  Let me look at you.”
"But you'd have me this time."
She twisted her head so she could see his eyes.  “Do you think she knows?”
of this, afraid Steve wouldn’t want to see him.  Afraid of what he’d say.  Or not say.
Tony cocked his head and narrowed his eyes. “Oh, you’d better not be teasing me, Rogers,” he said, the words coming out on a slow breath.
Tony smiled, his lips tilting just enough to be interesting. “Maybe you’re just having conversations with the wrong people.”
Tony shot Steve a withering eye. No matter what
“I missed you.”
Jen nodded.  "Yes. I just wish they'd done it while Jeff was still here.  He always wanted the kids to come home."
Sam nodded. “I think he’s alright. This isn’t the first time this has happened, but he needs some support. He’s got me and Sarah. And Bucky and Natasha.” He smiled a little. “And Wanda has mostly come around, but it will be good to have you on Team Steve too.”
Howard waited for his reply, and when he got none, he went on. “What do you know about Stark Industries?”
Steve had always taken it to heart rather than taking offense, but Tony had no such compunctions, and was highly offended on Steve’s behalf. But this one, however, was nothing like that. It couldn’t be called pristine, what with it’s eraser marks and a jagged tear on one corner, but it certainly was much prettier than any other Tony had seen. There were only red checks beside two questions, and they seemed much smaller than the previous ones. At the top, was a circled 94, and a note saying,
He turned his phone off after that.  He couldn’t stand to see her response.
Tony shrugged. “I don’t know.”
Steve nodded, and his hand crept out and touched the cuff of Tony’s pants. “Yeah,” he said. “A lot. And not just tonight, Tony. Before. When we weren’t talking much. I missed you then, too.”
Steve’s eyes narrowed, then widened. “For real?” he said. “You mean, like on the
“Like what?” Steve asked in the same sweet tone.  His eyes were soft but very present.  His foot pressed against Tony’s.
Thor squeezed his shoulder and stood up.  Steve joined him.  As he did, his fingers brushed the wooden handle of Stormbreaker.  A rush of electricity seemed to shiver up his arm.  It felt like raw power.  And oh, so dangerously right.
Steve shuddered in his arms, holding him tightly, his head buried in Tony’s neck.  “Me too, Tony.  Me too.  Remember that, okay?  Please?”
Wanda sat on Steve’s other side, then looked apologetically at Tony.  “You can’t touch,” she said.  “It will taint the images.”
Steve brought Tony’s hand to his mouth, the wet heat enveloping his fingers one by one, his tongue lingering over the pads of his fingers. He had always loved Tony’s hands. He had always been preoccupied with them. Tony had never been more grateful for that than right this second.
“I’ll take a cab home later.”
“Nothing’s wrong with you, baby.  You’re perfect.”
Tony’s eyes flicked to Sam and he held his hands up.  “Leave me out of this,” he laughed.  “She’s put me on the floor more times than I can count.”
Despair rolled over him.  “Will you just do anything to not be with me?” Tony asked.
themselves. And that was the best part of it for both of them. Steve had something that belonged to him. Only him. The fact that even though he didn’t have much--had never had much--he had Tony now. And for Tony, who had always had everything he ever wanted, but no true affection or love, now felt smothered in it whenever he was around Steve, and it was everything he’d ever dreamed of and more.
with Tony--weighed heavily on him.  Mostly because he didn’t understand what had caused it.  True, they had been in the kitchen when Nat kissed him, and as she’d told him before, public displays of affection made people uncomfortable, but Tony was always very public with his own affection.  Why should the short kiss he and Natasha had shared bother him so much?
“Okay,” she said, and yawned again. Her eyes drifted closed, but she forced them open and looked at him glassily. “I love you, Steve.”
“Seriously?”
Ross would be fine.  Tony was certain of it.  He’d do his time, come out the other side, and be welcomed back to Washington a hero with a zen pedigree.  That was okay with Tony.  He knew he’d suffer while he was there.  And that was the point.  He didn’t care what happened afterward, just that Ross suffered during.  And who knew?  Maybe Ross
"You already saw the ones on the wall! You don't-”
Sarah laughed, and Steve rolled his eyes. It was a dramatic, sarcastic eye-roll, but his insides were turning happy circles. He hadn’t wanted to admit just how nervous the thought of their meeting had been making him. Especially after the little argument he’d had with Tony over talking to Howard again. He hadn’t wanted to push anything. Hadn’t wanted to make him uncomfortable. But now, he realized just how silly that was, and he had never been more thrilled to feel that way in his life.
Steve slid his arms back around Tony’s waist.  “We did, did we?”
His own tears falling, Sam nodded.  “Promise.”
Finally, Steve spun the chair around and smiled.
. That’s what he did. That’s what they all did. They
“Ooh,” Tony sighed, “but you could come,” he said in a way that sounded like a huge burden had been removed from his shoulders.
"Yeah," he said, not even really remembering what Steve had said, just agreeing to agree with him. Saying yes just to please him.  Saying yes so he could get used to it.  He planned on saying yes a lot.  And the look in Steve's eye said that had been the right choice.
Steve shook his head, tugged his hand again. He didn’t know for sure what Howard had said to him--he felt like Tony always downplayed whatever happened to upset him--but there was no way in hell he was going to send him off to a hotel. Especially alone. Especially this time of night. Especially when he was hurting and sad. “Please?” he said, looking at him from under his lashes. “Tony, please come inside. I want you to stay, okay? If you want to go to a hotel tomorrow, then we can talk about that, but please stay here tonight. I’ll sleep on the couch if you want to be alone, but please stay here. Okay?”
"No, I'll just keep calling you baby."  He touched Steve's cock gently, then grasped it more firmly when Steve sucked in a deep breath.  "That's still okay, isn't it? Right, baby?"
Instead, he’d just texted Nat and suggested a quiet night.  She’d texted back within two minutes.  An easy, “Sounds perfect.  What time?” and she and Bruce had shown up at seven with the duck in tow.
He ducked his head, trying to catch Steve’s downcast eyes.  When he did, it was heaven.  “Don’t go,” he said, shaking him a little.  “Stay.  Okay?  Stay with me.  You’re not the only one who wants to feel that again.”
, he texted back, and the reply came seconds later.
And it was bittersweet, but for now, seeing him, the sweetness far outweighed the bitter.
He sat up and fixed Steve with a wry look.  “We didn’t talk about it, but,” he jerked his head toward the open bedroom door, “are we, like, sleeping together?  In there?”
“Bullshit
you just getting home?”Tony asked. “Have you and Wilson been out painting the town red this whole time?”
“His back and pelvis are healing nicely.  In fact, I think I’m going to try him on a walker next week.”
Sick anger rolled over him, making Tony weak in the knees.  If he hadn’t been leaning so fully against his guy, he would have collapsed.  “Are you telling me they kept you drugged for an entire
“I like you too, Daddy,” she said, and his heart felt like it might burst with his love for her.
“Sure, sure, sure, kid,” Tony said.  “Uh, Doctor Strange is here too.  Do you want his picture?”
Tony smiled at him again. This time it was a little darker. A little more flirtatious. “I’ll hold you to that,” he said. “And just so you know, coffee can’t be combined with lunch.” He held up two fingers. The nails were painted a dark shimmery blue. Steve’s stomach flip-flopped. “So that’s two you owe me.”
Tony's way was a little more extravagant, of course.  Usually, he'd call Steve and say, "How about lunch?" Sometimes that meant a burger in town, but sometimes it meant a jet to Paris for the afternoon, where they ate croissants and drank coffee, then switched to wine as the day got old.  They usually spent the night on these trips, and brought each other to a heaving, panting climax with the door to the balcony open and the sounds of the Parisian night floating in on the breeze.
Tony tries to help Steve
“No,” Tony said.  “I’ll do it.”
“Come on,” the cop said. “I don’t have all night.”
“In either case,” Tony said, dismissing it, “I didn’t want to upset you.”
Steve was
Thank you for reading! Love to you all!! <3<3<3
“Uh...nothing.”
“Fuck you.”
Steve’s hands clamped down on Wanda’s spasmodically, and she moaned in the back of her throat, whether from physical pain or something she saw in her mind, no one could tell.  Steve’s head moved from side to side in an erratic twitch.  His eyes squeezed shut, his face constricted with pain.
Tony panted out a laugh. “Pretty sure I’m way past you now, actually.”
Nat pulled out of his arms, and that pulled Steve back into reality. He smiled at her, breathed out a little laugh. “Wow,” he said. “God, you look great,” he said.
Steve frowned, those three vertical lines between his brows.  He opened his mouth, then closed it again.  He sighed.  “Yeah.”
“You know, some people ring the bell.”
you come over here tonight, Tony?”
“Steve?”
quipped, which was often and well. They both missed Steve’s presence though, and spent the early part of the day pondering what he was doing, or what he would have thought about the exhibit. Neither of them said a word that was less-than-complementary--even as a joke--about the guy they both loved, and that just made the day better. Knowing that the other was just as much a fan of Steve as they were, was more than enough to seal their own friendship, and by noon, they were able to just relax and pay more attention to the Mayans themselves than whether or not the other was truly good enough for Steve Rogers.
Natasha shook her head slowly from side to side.  “He wants to stay here.  He said so.”
Steve let out a breath and looked at Tony incredulously. His face said he was both surprised and hurt by what Tony had said, and suddenly Tony was wishing heartily that he had just kept his goddamn mouth shut. No, more, that he had just stayed home and did a jigsaw puzzle, or watched a
It was overwhelming.  The feel of him pressed so completely against Tony, heavy, solid,
Tony rubbed his forehead.  "You smack my head into the car door and you don't even say sorry?  Some welcome home this is."
His shoulders fell as he looked down at the pad.  His phone tumbled into his lap and lay there, forgotten.  The pencil, too, was forgotten.  It hit the ground and rolled back under the couch.
“I don’t even know if it’s the worst part, though.”  He opened his eyes and they were shaken, scared.  “What if it’s only the tip of the iceberg?”
Steve sat down next to him and pressed ‘play’ on the remote control.  “Sometimes I think you deliberately try to confuse me,” he said.
Steve came back and kissed him high up on his cheekbone. “Bye,” he said.
Steve unlocked his door, still trying not to watch--and watching anyway--as Tony gave Obadiah a little salute and said, “Yes, sir.”
Tony remembered his parents’ stiff, cordial conversations.  Usually they ended with his mother leaving the table to cry herself to sleep and Howard making another drink.  Until he’d met Pepper, he’d assumed all relationships were like that.  He hadn’t known there could be laughter and happiness and camaraderie with the person you shared your life with.
“Remember what happened to the breadcrumbs?”
“They put you boys on a timer in the big house?”
“No,” Steve answered, then shrugged.  “But I didn’t really want them to.”
Beneath the table, Steve felt a light pressure against his ankle and Tony gave him the smallest of winks.
They pulled into the driveway and parked.  Tony shut the car off, but neither moved to get out.
“Yeah, I did,” Tony said, and raised a hand to--finally--touch that beard on Steve’s face. He ran a hand over it, smooth and sure, then touched his bottom lip with his thumb. Steve closed his eyes. He only opened them when Tony brushed his fingers over his neck, down his arm, then slipped his hand into Steve’s.

“No, thank you, sir.”
“Close your eyes,” she said.

Steve couldn't stand it.  Didn't feel worthy to be here among them.  Not when he could have stopped this from happening.  Not when this was his fault.
have to--” Tony said, gesturing between the two of them.
Tony eased his mouth away from Steve's cock, giving him one last kitten lick before sitting up.
Bruce looked at him, discomfort very clear on his face, then pushed his sad salad away with the side of his hand. “I think I’m done,” he said.
Steve sighed harshly.
Steve picked at the hem of his t-shirt.  “He always made me laugh.”
Tony lifted Steve’s hand to his mouth. “Yeah,” he whispered. “In July.” He kissed Steve’s hand, then scrubbed away a tear with the back of his own. “In July, we’ll bring spray paint, and breadcrumbs, and we’ll go swimming.”
“I took him to my office. He requested somewhere private.”
“I’m sorry,” he said again.
“Steve…”
Steve turned on his stool, and there he was. Those bad, dark eyes. That mouth curved into half a smile. Steve’s heart lurched in his chest, but his brain was quiet, like it had been expecting this from the moment his feet had dragged the rest of his body in here, and the quiet was nice. He’d lost the knack for being quiet too. It felt good having it back for a minute.
trouble. He might just be somebody’s grandson coming for a quick, obligatory visit before running off to whatever club was currently the most popular downtown. That’s probably all it was. It didn’t matter anything to Steve in any case. He was here to work, not watch some

time,” Tony said, and dug his nails into Steve’s hips, dragging him closer. “And kiss me while you do it.”
“Will you push me down to the water?” he asked, hesitantly.
Yeah, no thoughts of Steve at all, here in Malibu.  It was Steve-free.
“But what do you
“Don’t worry, peanut,” Tony murmured in her ear. “Nemo’s safe. His daddy found him, remember?”
like he was doing right now.
Tony got dressed.  He put on a suit.  Armani, gray, impeccable, and black wing-tips that might have looked old-fashioned on someone else, but on him, looked amazing, if he did say so himself.  He knotted his tie in a double-windsor, and left.  He hated himself a little for dressing up, but if he was going to grovel, he might as well do it with style.
Steve braced his stronger right foot on the ground, grabbed the headboard with his hands, and pulled, using his foot as little as possible for balance.  His left leg moved a little, but still hung mostly useless yet, not impeding him--he’d learned to work around it--just being a nuisance, instead.
Nat bit her lip to keep from smiling.  “Nothing,” she said.  “Just you and Strange have some stuff in common, that’s all.”
“Funny.”
“You smell good,” Tony mumbled, breathing deeply.
“Steve.  I want you to stay.”
“But you’re the only one who died for it.”
Tony.”
I said to her, "Why don't you just call my name?"
“I always meant it,” he said through the light haze of tears he hadn’t even realized was there. “I did a lot of stupid stuff when we were kids. I made a lot of mistakes. And when we got older, I just kept making them.”
“No-oo,” Tony whined. He stuck his bottom lip out just a little, and Steve laughed, tipping his head onto the back of the couch. “Stop. You’re not playing fair.”
Steve didn't like Tony's pick.  Sure, it had been the first time they'd kissed, the first time they'd admitted their attraction to each other, but it was also the day before another anniversary, and this one was not nearly as pleasant.
“Hey,” he said softly, moving his shoulder.  “Steve.  Wake up.  We’re here.  There.  Whatever.  Wake up.”
This is a little talk-y. But, I guess that's what conversations are.
would have been a mistake. Especially after what Nick had said about distancing himself. Especially because Nick was right. He should distance himself, and fast, before this got to be more than the training could handle.
“Yeah.  We do.”
A date and a talk
Every
“Just the daisies, Tony.”
“She did not.”
“You’re early,” the--
Steve reluctantly loosened his fingers. He kept his eyes closed as he felt Tony’s hand slip through his hair one more time, and then he was gone.
Nick and Strange came back to the table.  Ross kept his eye on Steve for another long moment, waiting for him to crack, then looked at Fury.
“So, you think I should send it?”
“Me too, baby,” Tony said, then let out a long breath. “I’ve missed you. Missed us. I wish we had…” He trailed off and exhaled again.
In the elevator, he raked a hand through his hair a few times and popped a couple Altoids just in case. The rest of the ride up, he just breathed. Just closed his eyes and breathed, and by the time the door opened, he was doing okay. He was ready. As ready as he’d ever be.
“What do you mean?”
Through Tony’s eyes, Steve didn’t see the super-soldier Dr. Erskine and Howard had imagined then birthed out of a metal womb.  He didn’t see the man who commanded armies and took down Hydra.  He didn’t even see that kid who had jumped on a grenade during training to save the other guys from the blast.  That kid had been skinny and lonely, but he had been good.  A good man.
He couldn’t imagine anyone getting mad at Steve. And what was this other part? This ‘taking what
“Sure.  Let’s go.”
Steve pushed the elevator button.  It opened and he stepped inside.  “L” for Lobby.  It was blue, that button.  He pushed it.
He just wished the weather would cooperate.
“How much time does
“Right,” she said smartly, and he grinned like a kid.
“Baby,” Tony said again, but this time there was a dark urgency behind the word, and when Steve lifted his head to look at him, Tony captured his mouth in a long, searing kiss. His tongue delved into those sweet depths, seeking out Steve’s and worshipping it with his own.
“Are you kidding?” Tony replied.  “An invitation for afternoon cuddles?  I’ll never turn that down.”
Steve leaned forward abruptly and kissed first her right cheek, and then her left.  “Alright,” he relented.  “Alright, little red.  Let’s do it.  You and me.”
course had been set.  His course was Tony.
Strange looked him in the eye.  "I couldn't, Tony. Doctor-patient privilege."
“Not helping, Tony.”
“Yeah?”
Steve held out his hand, and Tony came to him and took it, gripping it tightly. “What do you want to do?” Steve asked, his thumb caressing Tony’s knuckles.
“I don’t.”
“I know.”
“Okay?” Tony asked, his hands roaming down Steve’s chest to his waist, then back up again. “You just said everything I was fucking
a long time. Because Tony had done nothing but get better, and Steve had stayed the same.
“I hate that we’re fighting,” Tony said, and for the second time that night, the words were out before he even realized he was going to say them. But they were true, so he just let them come. “I hate it. I don’t want to fight with you.”
Well, maybe not
He paused to think about the question.  It was loaded to the hilt.
-deep love.
Steve’s faux puppy-dog eyes turned real. One of Tony’s teachers had told him about an exhibit on Mayan engineering, and he wanted to go. Steve felt awful turning him down, but he had to work. He had promised his boss he’d work a double-shift that day to cover for one of the checkers who was having a baby. He’d promised to pay him time-and-a-half for the six hours of overtime, and Steve couldn’t turn it down.
He rubbed his cheek against her shoulder a bit restlessly and shifted against her. “I wish I could have known
He wasn’t okay anymore.
Tony felt himself mimicking Steve’s posture, finally easing back into the chair.
Some nights, they didn’t have sex at all.  Some nights, they’d just shower and brush their teeth and get into bed.  Tony would prop his pillows up, put on his glasses, and work on his tablet.  Steve would do some homework--
. Sometimes it’s all I think about.”
Steve let his head fall back on his neck and breathed out a laugh. Tony looked at him sharply. “You’re right,” Steve muttered. “How the fuck
They climbed the metal ladder that led up to it and sat side by side, shoulders pressed together, leaning against the wall.  Nat pulled a blanket over their laps and motioned to the cooler.  “Do you want anything?”
Steve twined his fingers with Tony’s.  “I did,” he agreed.  “I do.”
Some of the more lucid ones, Tony did allow to drive away.  Nick Fury, as cool and calm as Tony had ever seen him, left.  Bucky and Sam, both still sober, went with him, and Rhodey followed in his Lexus.  They were going back to the Compound.  There was still a job to do, Fury said, no matter how enjoyable the evening had been.
The casual touches and easy, friendly looks he’d grown accustomed to over the past month did not disappear when their friends showed up.  Tony had been half-afraid Steve would retreat from him a little with the others there and had mentally prepared himself for that.  But that didn’t happen at all.  Steve treated him exactly the same as he had since they’d gotten over their initial coldness.  He held his hand, casually ran his fingers through his hair, and even went so far as to pick a fight with him over the grilling of the steaks.  Crazily, it had been that even more than the lingering touches he gave him that made Tony feel the most confident in what they were building here together.  Any couple could put their best face forward for company.  Only the strongest ones would give them a glimpse behind the curtain.
“It was...offensive.”  He chewed his nail again, worrying the ragged edge between his teeth.  “I felt bad.  Sam and Wanda were trying so hard to cheer me up, and I pretended it was okay, that I was happy, and I

“Mm.  I do love her,” Steve sighed.
won’t quit.”
“Uh-huh,” Steve agreed. His lips were perilously close to Tony’s now. So close, Steve could almost taste the vodka and cranberry juice on them. Sweet and tart. Perfect. “But if all it took was a few daggers to scare him off, then he had no business being with you anyway.”
Steve obeyed, his eyes dark on Tony’s, his breath coming in short, even gasps.
“Five minutes. Collection point’s on top of the hill.”
Bucky nodded.  He took another step closer, but Tony didn’t feel threatened.  “There’s one other thing I wanted to say to you.”
Tony’s fist shot out again.  Steve leaned back, dodging it.  “Probably not,” he said.  “But you said ‘anything I want’.  You did say that, right?  I could have sworn you did.”
“Yeah,” Tony agreed. “
“Just a couple times,” he said, picking a cashew out of the bowl they were sharing. He didn’t look straight at Sam, just glanced at him through his lashes. “It’s not really serious.”
“Come on,” Steve said and patted the bed. He had turned down the covers and was smoothing the pillow. “Come hop up into bed. You and your dad can sleep in here.”
“I don’t think I did.”
Stark,” he said smoothly.  “That would punish Nat.”

Besides, his hands
“I’m here, honey.  Right here.”
“It wasn’t that.” Tony smiled a little ruefully and rested his head against his chest again. “Or maybe it was. I don’t know. All I know is I was sure you wouldn’t call. And I thought,” he sighed harshly, “it might be because we--
“Are you sure, Steve?” Strange said.
Tony stopped talking.  “What?”
Tony leaned over and kissed his temple.  “Don’t get up, ‘kay?” he said, kissing him a second and third time.  “I’ll be back.”
“Gorgeous, peanut,” he said. “Like the best thing I’ve ever seen. How do
They sat looking at each other in the cafeteria, cold cups of coffee and the ruins of Steve’s blueberry muffin between them. There were the ruins of other things between them too. Steve could feel them. Almost see them. If he closed his eyes and thought about it, he
Talking...or something.
Tony let out a breath, raising an eyebrow.  Steve didn't ask for that very often, and Tony craved it when he did, so he would say yes, no matter what.  Of course, he would. He would
Tony went first, stepping through the door, then stopped just over the threshold.  Steve followed closely, and pulled the door closed behind him.  It was dark in the cabin, the only light coming from the bulb over the sink in the kitchen and the mellow glow of the reactor in Tony’s chest peeking through his unzipped coat.
“That’s good to hear.”
One traitorous tear fell from his eye as she pulled away.  She touched it with her fingertip.  “I’ll come back if I can.”
“If you’re going to, do it in the oven.  Microwaved pizza is against my religion.”
Very short half-chapter...
Tony came into the bathroom and leaned over the back of the chair.  He put his arms around Steve’s broad shoulders and nibbled at his neck under his right ear.  It was a good spot.  It was his spot.  He’d claimed it the night before when kissing it, Steve had clutched his hair, held his head in place, and told him--not asked, told him--not to stop.
“Let me see your nose,” she said and knelt beside him.
“What’s the matter?” Steve asked, his voice gentle.
She shrugged one shoulder--a very Tony-like shrug--and looked down at the floor. He stood up, taking her hand. “Come here,” he said. “I want you to meet somebody.”
--No, I won’t
His shoulders dropped.  “Okay.”
Tony leaned into him, put his hand on his thigh. There was nothing sexy about it. It was just a comfortable touch. “I would change this plan too,” he said, “except it’s kind of a work-thing. Howard’s been planning it for a long time, and it would be kind of a dick-move to uproot it.” He moved his thumb against Steve’s jeans. “I’d much rather blow it off and hang out with you alone all night.”
“I don’t know how you take your coffee.”
JULY, SUNDAY 6:50 PM
He never thought he’d see him again. That was the thing.
“I’m a fantastic cook, I’ll have you know,” Tony said. “Come for dinner and see for yourself.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, if it’s me, aren’t you supposed to kiss me?” Steve asked shyly.  “Isn’t that how it works?”
Tony mouthed, then made a locking motion against his lips.  She nodded at him again, and went back to her picture.
Six months.
“What did
Steve laughed under his breath.  “I guess it’s not like they don’t already know.”
“I figured that was why.”
“Me too.”
Steve drank more coffee. It was calming. A regular thing to do. That’s what he was. Just a regular guy. Drinking coffee like a regular guy. “Well, maybe a little surprised,” he conceded. “That’s not something you hear much in general conversation.”
“Yes.”
Steve didn’t know about hot, but he was certainly very warm, all of a sudden.  He glanced around again, then slipped his arms around Tony’s waist.  “I was thinking about you, too.”
“Then we’ll deal with that,” Tony said simply.  “We’ll take things as they come, okay?  You and me.”
keep my hands to myself.” He drummed his fingers once on Steve’s cheekbone. “Contrary to what it may seem.”
He smiled a little at the pet name. “Hey.”
“But you’ll make an exception, right?” Tony pressed. “Just this once? For me?”
Tony tucked the phone between his ear and his shoulder.  “Yeah.  Yeah...Yeah, Billy.  No, I really do get it.”
Tony reached over, grabbed Rhodey’s arm, latching onto him and shaking him a little.  “God, it’s good to see you.”
“Behind the dug-out?  Is that good?”
It wasn’t fair to her.  Or him.
“Come on, baby,” Tony said weakly.  “What else do I have to say?”
An acrid scent reached Tony’s nose, and in the darkness, a glowing ember rose, flared briefly, then lowered again.
“Sure thing.”
“His loyalty to the ideals this country was founded on is unimpeachable.”
It wasn’t.
“My credit card is your credit card, Miss Potts.”
Steve was silent for a long time, just sitting with his head in his hand, his blue eyes closed.  Tony didn’t prompt him, but he did watch him.  He watched the slight rise and fall of his chest as he breathed.  He watched his hair move in the breeze that blew around them.  He watched him and loved him and kicked a lightning-quick prayer out to the universe that Steve would get over this.  He couldn’t be without him again.  Not now.  Not ever again.  And it was partly because Steve was right.  He
“She’s fine.”
?”  He sighed and shrugged.  “I’ve been his for years.  Since we met.”
Steve started, his hand closed tighter on the ice.  His knuckles burned.
“I don’t want to talk about it.”
“She didn’t hate you,” Sarah said, petting his hair. “She was just angry.”
He took his keys out of his pocket, and before the door was even open, he could hear a scuffling on the other side, a wild scratching on the wood, and he hurried to throw it open. Dodger was on him the second he was through, and Steve dropped to his knees to hug him. Dodger wiggled with excitement, letting out little yipping barks. “Shh, Dodge,” Steve said, but he didn’t really mean it. Even if Dodger was being loud, Steve didn’t care. He held him and petted him and laughed quietly while the dog tried to crawl up into his lap.
Music played, food was eaten by the plateful, and the booze flowed freely.  Thor brought some of his Asgardian mead.  He, Bucky, Steve, and Jeff each did three shots, and Jeff passed out against Thor’s shoulder.
Steve bent down and ruffled the dog’s fur. Dodger looked up at him, asking if it was okay if he explored the unfamiliar place. Steve handed the end of the leash to Morgan. “We’ll keep him leashed for a while,” he said. “Until he understands what’s expected of him, ‘kay?”
A complicated jumble of feelings passed over Tony seeing him sitting there like that.  Guilt for being late, pride for how hard Steve had worked--was working--in his classes, a little leftover humor from the evening out with his friends, and of course an intense, bone-deep,
“Where are you taking me?  Back to gen pop?”
That was when Tony saw him.
Or, rather, they needed the serum that ran through him.  He was just a vessel, a containment unit for the thing they actually needed.  They needed the monster Erskine and Howard had brewed in their lab.  Steve Rogers, Brooklyn-boy, born and raised, just came along for the ride.
“Sure.  Be careful,” he said again, and she left.  On her way out the door, Steve heard her say, “Hi, Tony.”
At eleven-fifteen, pleasantries out of the way, Tony stood in the Tower common room.  He had told Nat and Bruce what they were doing, and Nat been as indignant as Tony had been.  Bruce was more mellow, of course, surprised that they were trying this again, but cautiously optimistic.  Tony had known what their reactions would be, right down to Nat’s haughty hair-flip and Bruce’s steadying hand on her shoulder.  They didn’t disappoint, and love burst out of him toward them.  He’d wrapped them both in a bear-hug, making himself the filling of a Bruce/Natasha sandwich, and told them he’d call them tomorrow with the details.
He showed it to Tony when he finished it, bringing it into the bedroom and handing it to him with a shy, downcast eye.  Tony read it through, glasses perched on the end of his nose, frowning over it seriously.
Tony smoothed his hand over Steve’s shoulder.  “Still in the jet.  Remember?  I came to pick you up.”
, his mind whispered.
“I don’t know,” she said.  “I thought he was charming.”
Steve wheeled himself to the chair where Tony sat.  The concern had taken over.  Three vertical lines appeared between his brows as he frowned.  He reached up and cupped Tony’s cheek.  “You sure you’re okay?  You’re acting weird all of a sudden.”
Howard rose to his feet. His eyes--the same as Tony’s, although neither of them ever acknowledged the fact--turned darker. He swirled the last swallow of his drink in the glass before tossing it back at a gulp. He didn’t sway. The man was a veteran drinker. It would take more than a couple glasses of whiskey to put him off-kilter. He pointed a finger at Tony with the hand still holding his glass. It was a familiar gesture. One Tony had seen a million times since he was a kid. “Don’t talk to me that way, kiddo. I’m still your father, and you’re still living under my roof. You’ll treat me with respect. You got that?”
“I said the Compound.”
be the one getting rewarded,” Tony said, arching a brow. “I’d make sure of it.”
“Were
“Oh yeah,” he answered.  “I was alone.  And it fucking sucked.”
“Alright?” Tony asked.  “What does ‘alright’ mean?”
Tony let out a surprised, relieved breath. “Really?” he asked. “You’ll come? For real?”
He took the chicken out of the fridge and pounded it thin, then set up a breading station--flour, beaten egg, Panko bread crumbs--and breaded the chicken.
Steve shrugged, that
Tony nodded. “Yeah.”
There were no Christmas lights here, but the porch light was on.  Tony had left it on when he locked up this morning.  He’d known it would be dark when he got home.  He hadn’t known he’d have Steve with him.  He’d hoped, but hadn’t known, and now he looked at him apprehensively, worrying, but not showing it.  Wondering if he’d gone too far bringing him here.
“Well, of course he’d say that, honey,” Nat said.  “Especially if he fucked something up and needed to cover it up.”
They went to dinner at a little pizza place near the aquarium, then outside, Tony buckled Morgan into the backseat of his car. He closed the door, and looked up at Steve. “I don’t want to take you home yet,” he said simply.
“Yeah,” Bucky said, wiping his eyes.  “I remember.”
Tony thought distractedly, then sighed. No. There was no way. No way someone who was perfection personified would ever be interested in him. At least not for more than a quick fuck, and Tony couldn’t do that. At least not
“You don’t go to MIT,” Josh said, his voice rising just a bit, trying to break the spell that was being woven between Tony and Steve. “Where
“You’re wrong, you know,” Natasha said, as they skirted around a group of prostrate worshippers.
“Come upstairs with me,” Steve repeated, then finally slipped his arms around Tony’s waist and held him closer.  “I don’t know if I’m ready to
Steve frowned sharply.  “Absorb?” He looked at them all again.  “Wait.  No.  Nobody said--”
Maybe.
“Is that part of the ‘romance’ stuff you were talking about earlier?” Steve asked.
“‘Kay.”
Natasha looked at Steve.  “Are we ready, honey?”
Steve smiled, the hectic blush easing.  “I don’t remember what that was like.”
He still felt remarkably good, but he wouldn't get eight years.  He knew it.
Steve nodded and stood up. Jack took his arm, like he was his boyfriend. Steve let him. Even if it did still feel strange--still feel
“Hey,” Bucky said suddenly. “Let’s go, huh? Let’s go somewhere else.”
paying attention, but for some reason, some stupid, fucked-up reason he couldn’t quite grasp, he found his eyes straying to the door. Watching it. Not constantly, but often. Especially over the last ten minutes. Almost like he was expecting someone. Almost like he was waiting-
“Yeah. Josh is a nice guy, but I think he’s got an exhibitionist kink.”
“Sam?”
He opened his eyes. Tony’s were there. Big and bright and deep. And he was smiling. Just a little, but he was smiling. Steve thought he had never felt happier in his whole life. “Yeah,” he said. “Yeah, I’m okay.” He nudged Tony with his shoulder. “Are you okay?”
Steve bent his head against Tony’s shoulder and held him.  “You are winning,” he said.  “I don’t want to fight.”
“Steve,” he choked out, and then he was coming, squeezing his eyes shut even tighter, fisting his hands in the sheet. He felt it when Steve came, and reached blindly up to pull him closer until he was lying on top of him, panting. “Baby,” he whispered, and curled his hand possessively around the back of his neck, holding him, running his fingers through his damp hair, lying quietly together while they both came down. After a while, he turned his head until his lips found the side of Steve’s neck. “You’re so amazing,” he whispered. “So beautiful. So perfect.”
Steve flushed, ducking his head guiltily.  “Sorry.”
Steve nodded. He didn’t look him in the eye. He couldn’t. His resolve couldn’t take it.
“I think it’s for anybody. I think you just have to fill out some-.” Sam looked up from his own books, his eyes suddenly filled with a deep worry. “Steve-” he began.
company.  Public opinion means a lot to the success of that company.  It wouldn’t look good if she was involved in anything untoward.”
Tony sighed again. “I love you too.”
When they parted, it was Steve’s turn to sigh. Eyes still closed, he took in a deep breath, then let it out again in a shudder. Tony’s hand was still on his neck, his other still held firmly in Steve’s.
Tony put his hand on the side of Steve’s neck and let his thumb move over his cheek, his lips, his chin. “Shit,” he muttered. “Baby. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I just...I came down here to kill a few hours until you got home, and I got sidetracked. I guess.”
Steve didn’t look back.
always love him.
Steve knew what he felt like. Knew what it felt like when it was
“Of course, I know it, Tony.”
, though...well, Steve actually had no fucking clue what he did. All he knew was that he had been positive he would never see him again.
“Oh my god, Tony, I don’t even care.  Just don’t stop.”
“Are you okay other than that?”
?” Tony asked sharply.  “
, Steve.”
. His eyes were still closed, and he ran his thumb over the tie now wrapped around his knuckles. He sighed.
, but still pretty good, and a hell of a lot easier.  There were drinks--oh, a shit
“I-” Tony began, then stopped. Shook his head. “Our future, baby,” he managed. “You were thinking about our future. About us.”
He wasn’t sure if he minded or not, but he thought he might as well answer truthfully. “Ovarian,” Steve answered, sipping his coffee.
Tony shrugged. Brushed Steve’s throat with his thumb again. “You mentioned talking, ‘or something’? We could do that.”
And he smiled the whole way home.
More kisses. His shoulder. His neck. “I think I’ll only feel better if you say ‘yes’, Steven.”
“What’s this?”
“I’ll come over, ‘kay? I’ll be there in fifteen minutes.”
"Maybe later."
Steve still hadn’t spoken to the others.  He’d sent them each a text saying he was okay, but that he still needed time to get his head straight before he saw anyone.  He said he’d talk to them when he could.  He didn’t say where he was.
Fury’s hand squeezed his neck.  Steve closed his eyes to stop the tears that suddenly threatened.  He didn’t remember his father’s touch.  He hoped it had been like Nick Fury’s was right now.
The receptionist kept smiling. “We’re in luck,” she said, her eyes flicking curiously from Steve to Tony standing behind him, a cup of coffee in his hand, his sleeves rolled up, glasses perched on top of his head. “He
When he regained the use of his tongue, Tony lifted a hand and cupped it behind his ear.  “Excuse me, Stephen?  Could you repeat that, please?  I must be older than I thought.  My ears are playing tricks on me.”
“Oh, yeah?”
“Ready for the light?” Tony asked.
“I want to be your friend again.  We were friends before we were anything else.  Can’t we go back to that?”
Tony grinned back.
to love me.”
Steve shook his head, took another drag. “Not yet. In a minute, though,” he said, and tapped ash from his cigarette with practiced ease.
The man who filled the space was tall, bald, broad-shouldered. He was wearing a business suit, still fastening his cuff-links as he looked between Steve and the kid, then back to Steve again. “Is my godson bothering you, Mr. Rogers?” he asked.
Sorry this took so long, but I tried to make up for it by including a sexy scene I wasn't planning on, and making this chapter extra-long!
He’d moved back up here in November.  It was as easy working from here as it was from the Tower, with the added bonus that if Ross ever wanted to see him, he’d have to travel a lot more out of his way.  That would cut his visits by a lot.  That had been on Tony’s Christmas wish-list, and as they always say, Santa helped those who helped themselves.  Or something like that.
"How about something really different?" Tony said.  "
He held back a little. He didn’t want Steve to come from just this. He was positive that Steve could go more than one round in a night, but he wanted the first one to count. He wanted it to be something that Steve would remember for the rest of his life. Even if tonight amounted to no more than just one time, he wanted to make sure that one time was good. As good as he could possibly make it. For Steve, and for himself.
, Tony thought, standing in front of the half-open door, peering inside, trying to decipher the complication of shadows within.
. Present tense. Tony had looked the same. Had that same, hollow look in his eyes, that same sour twist to his lips. She’d held him before he left. For as long as he let her anyway, rocking him a little, then kissed his temple and told him she was sure he was wrong. That he had to be patient with Steve. He could be a little stubborn sometimes, but he always came back around to the right way of thinking. They just had to give him time.
"Don't brood too hard, Steve," she said. "Nothing good comes from that."
Strange stood up, unfolding himself from the chair.  He took his wallet out of his pocket--leather, slim, expensive; Tony grudgingly admired his taste--and tossed some cash onto the table.  Twin Andrew J’s gazed in Tony’s direction.
“I know so.”
But he did want to do it again.
“Then stop talking about him!”
Steve smiled.  “Okay,” he relented.  “For a little while.  But if it gets too weird--”
They stood together for a few minutes, just holding each other, soaking in the essence of comfort that brewed between them whenever they were in each other’s arms, then Steve kissed his shoulder again and said, “Sounds like you started the movie.”
“I don’t.”  Tony shrugged, relishing the sweet warmth of Steve’s mouth against the palm of his hand, relishing how personal it felt.  How intimate.  “I don’t need that.  I know who we are, baby.  I don’t need a government seal of approval.”
Tony lay there, undecided.  He needed to see him.  He had something he needed to say.  It had been building up for a while now.  All the days they had sat together at the breakfast table, all the nights they had sat next to each other in the living room, the television on, a fire in the hearth, the lights dim, the scent of Steve, the
Tony ran his hand up through Steve’s hair. “Do you have to ask?”
Steve took hold of Tony’s t-shirt and tugged.  Tony bent down gladly.  “How do you just keep getting better?” Steve asked.
“Yeah,” Steve said. “I’m all set.”
Silence spun out between them.  Outside the open window, crickets trilled their nighttime song.  Steve looked at the window, the dark pressing against it.  His face was blank, unreadable even to Tony who was probably closer to him than anyone now, save one.  He wanted this to be over, suddenly.  It had gone on too long, had gotten too ugly.  He wanted nothing more than to take Steve’s hand and mend this breach between them.  Steve looked at his own hands.  Tony watched him as he lifted one, curled it into a loose fist, then let it drop.  When he looked up at Tony again, his eyes were blue, the black cast gone.  They were big and blue and vulnerable.
that.”
“Stop what? Stating the obvious?”
say ‘Hey, Tony, I’m going to prison tomorrow.  See ya later’.”  Tony shook his head.  “Nope.  He definitely wouldn’t say that.”
a compliment. And I owe you another one too,” he went on, sitting back and crossing his legs. “Your mother showed me some of your work the other night.”
Tony held him tighter. “No,” he said. “No, honey. Baby, we weren’t fighting.”
Just a quick note:  I am a sloppy researcher.  I usually just spend three minutes on Google, then put enough facts in to make my B.S. sound semi-believable.  Sloppy research worked for me in my Algebra 1030 class.  Sort of.  And a shout-out to my professor who gave me a pity C- when I told her I was going to have to drill a hole in my head like that guy in the movie "Pi" so I could sleep at night after all of her freaky mathematical concepts gave me nightmares.  They actually did.
“What are you doing down here?” he asked.
“I promise.”
“‘Kay.  Thanks.”
Case in point--the toothpaste incident.  Nobody got so worked up over a slightly crusty toothpaste, but they had yelled at each other for over an hour before calming down and drawing an almost-literal line in the sand.  Tony had even measured it, calculating the exact math in his head and saying with deadly patience, “Okay,
not that much of an exhibitionist.”
They hadn’t seen each other since that night. They had talked on the phone, and texted back and forth, but they’d both been too busy to get together, and Tony missed him. Missed his eyes, and his smile, and the way he quirked an eyebrow at him sometimes to punctuate a thought or a sentence. He missed him. He wanted him and he missed him.
Steve grinned. He couldn’t help it. “Hello to you, too.”
Steve stood hesitantly in the doorway.  His eyes jumped here and there, going everywhere but the bed.  Tony was reminded of that first night they’d spent together.  Neither had been sure what they were doing, where they belonged, how they fit.  Thankfully, this time, one of them knew.
He hated this phone.
Tony ran his fingers through Steve’s gold hair, caressed his high cheekbone with first his fingers, then his lips, thinking of nothing more than the hours and days that stretched ahead of him. Time that, only a few short weeks ago, had looked much dimmer. Much more mundane. Much, much sadder. But now…
code still worked too.  He had full access to, not only the common areas of the Tower, but even Tony’s much more private ones.  The lab, the garage, the control room, even the basement levels where he kept a lot of the personal things that had once belonged to Howard and Maria.  Steve could get in anywhere in the Tower.  All he had to do was use his code, say his name, let FRIDAY do her full-body scan thing that she did so well, and he was off.  He was like Charlie Bucket in that old Willy Wonka movie.  And that was funny in more ways than one.  Little, pre-serum Steve had even
going to ask, Tony,” he said, “and if you said yes, well, that’d make me the happiest guy in the world.”
Tony laughed.  She’d waited until Gina was gone before asking, and that was good.  She always erred on the side of discretion.  It was one of the things he loved about FRIDAY.  JARVIS’ instincts had not been as finely tuned.  He had interrupted more than one sexual escapade with a comment or a question.  Once, he’d frightened the poor girl Tony’d been with so much she’d ran out of the room naked, screaming about UFOs and alien voices.  Of course, it hadn’t helped that they’d both been done up on some high-octane coke at the time.  On second thought, maybe JARVIS had been trying to tell him something with his interruptions without coming right out and questioning his sometimes questionable taste in partners.
Tony sighed and pulled him even closer.  “Fortunately, I do,” he said, and pressed his mouth against Steve’s.
Again.
“What about Strange?”
Fury dropped his hand and walked away, his back turned.  Strange stood and joined him.  They whispered to each other tensely.
“I wouldn’t be sulking.  Bruce is down there,” Tony said lightly.  “He’s enthusiastic enough, but the Hulkiness of it all makes it a little rough for my taste.”
Thank you all for reading! I love you all so much!!
Natasha nodded.  “Okay.  Thank you for trying.”
Steve put his bag down, then crossed the room to that spot.  He scuffed his toe on the hardwood, then squatted easily on his haunches and touched the floor.
Sam laughed.
Tony drifted off not long after that, and Steve lay quiet, thinking about how he had gotten here. Thinking about all the years that had passed since he’d first met that small, dark-haired boy in an elementary school cafeteria. Years since they’d kissed on that tree stump behind the school. Years since they’d met again, in high school this time. Since they’d kissed again. Since they’d made love. Since they’d
I know, but…
“Oh yeah?”
--I won.”
He poured a little olive oil in the bottom of the saute pan and fried the chicken lightly.  It smelled good.  Warm and inviting.  Frying wasn’t the healthiest choice, but sometimes, you just had to go with what tasted good.  And he knew this would taste good.  It was one of his go-to meals.  Tony always raved about it, no matter how often he made it.
Tony nodded. “Okay.”
Tony watched him think about it, entranced by the seriousness that came over him when he concentrated.  It was an almost physical force, an aura around him.  Tony’s stomach flipped over lazily, then Steve turned those eyes on him again--those goddamn husky-blue eyes--and it flipped again.
Steve closed his eyes and let out a contented sigh as he sunk further into Tony's side.  "Oh. Okay."
“So,” he said, trying for casual and almost making it, “where were you while I was making an ass out of myself and probably making the front page of
do it, Tony. Everything they want me to do, I can do. They give me an order, and I do it. They don’t wonder if I can get it done, they just know I can. And that makes it so
“That’s not my fault,” Tony protested softly.  “You’re the one who didn’t want to.”
Steve leaned back in his seat. “Abort,” he said under his breath.
“Not kidding. I thought you said you’d be home early?”
That was why he spent so much time in the lab, so much time
“Then why are you calling?”
Steve leaned forward in his seat.  His broken arm pressed against the edge of the metal table.  It must have hurt, but he made no sound, showed no pain on his face.  He looked deeply into Tony’s eyes, the blue piercing his own chocolate brown.  “That’s the one time I won’t wait, Tony,” he said.  “I’ll follow you.  I’ll be right behind you.  I swear.”
Steve went down the short hallway and came back a moment later with a folded sheet and a thick comforter. They were both white and cozy-looking. He flipped a t-shirt over Tony’s shoulder. “Here,” he said. “You can get her dressed in the bathroom. I’ll make the bed up.”
“I would have left.”
Steve nodded.  “Something like that.”  He shifted the bag again.  It was pretty small.  One of those solitary sandwiches.  He turned his eyes to Tony.  They were the same.  The same blue that had made him weak in the knees since day one.  The Helicarrier.  Forever ago now.  But those eyes were still the same.  Captain Steve Rogers: breaking hearts since 2012.  “It was nice seeing you again, Tony,” he said.  “Really.  Take care.”
“That’s my girl.”
until they could all get ready for shit like this together. And go together. And be there together. And leave together. Especially the leaving-together part. Tony didn’t mind these parties--he really didn’t--but they would be so much better when he had Steve there with him. Morgan was too young to make snarky comments to, and Howard was too much the subject of his snark. Even if it was starting to become good-natured snark instead of the actual bitching he was used to, Tony still didn’t think Howard would appreciate the humor. But Steve would. He always had.
FRIDAY hesitated.
Tony threw himself to the side, the razor, meant to deliver a killing slash, grazed his cheek instead.  He felt his skin part, felt the blood as it began to flow.
He looked around, scuffed his toe in the dust and earth covering the concrete, unconsciously tracing out letters.  S-T-E
“It’s okay, Steve,” Tony said softly. “I’ll be okay.”
Steve subsided into nervous silence again.  He counted to one hundred.  Three times.  When he could stand it no longer, he said, “Come on, Tony.  You’ve read it ten times.  What do you think?”
“Morgan,” he said, and went to her..
“Hey,” Tony said, then reached out and touched Steve’s hand again.  A little snap of energy, like an electric shock jolted through him at Steve’s touch.  Tony gasped, but locked his fingers over Steve’s.  The shock became a low, steady hum.  “Hey, baby, if you want that,” Tony said, staring him in the eye, “
"Steve, where are you? I've been calling and calling!"  Nat. Scared.
,” Tony said, and ran his fingers through his own hair. “It was just an observation.”
Silence around him.  Before, FRIDAY would speak now, asking how he was then wishing him a nice afternoon when he got off.  Instead, that other voice came back.  “Rogers.  Steven, Grant.  Access Code 112-A accepted.”
“I don’t make the news, baby, I just report it.  It’s noisy and smoggy and people throw their trash on the ground and piss on the subway.”
“Fine,” she said.  “But contact me if there is any problem.”  She eyed Ross again stonily.
“What are you doing?” Tony asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I gotta work at nine. How ‘bout eight?”
Steve frowned at him, that concentration growing impossibly deeper, boring into Tony’s eyes now instead of the world of his painting. “What do you mean?”
“That’s his name,” Steve explained.  “Rich Uncle Pennybags.”
Tony rubbed his temples.  His jaw clenched.  “No, dumb-ass, you shouldn’t have done it, at all.”
, Tony thought, bitterly.
Tony drew in a breath.  This was what he wanted to hear most of all.  He was ashamed of it, but there it was.  He was a narcissist at heart.  And a masochist.  “Really?” he urged.
“Every day, Tony,” Steve said, and even as he said it, he knew it was true. Knew he meant every word. Knew he’d give him anything and everything he could. Whatever Tony wanted. Whatever he had. Anything. “Every single day for the rest of my life.”
“I’m serious, Steve,” Tony said.  “I have heard more than one rousing speech out of your mouth, so don’t sit there and act like you don’t know how to talk.”
Barnes?"
“Was that okay?” he asked, and Tony laughed softly in his ear.
“Hey. You okay?”
He laughed shakily to himself. Breathed in then out. Once. Twice. Three times. The surety of that thought didn’t go away. It intensified, even. Thank god. Thank
Tony nuzzled his neck, kissed the smooth spot under his ear that was
Steve shook his head. “Too old for you, Tony,” he said. “Remember?”
Tony grabbed the lamp off the table and held it closer to Steve's head.  "Oh my fucking god," he exclaimed. There was laughter in his voice now too, under the initial surprise.  "You do! You've got like three of them. Right here."
After perfecting the Kevlar placement in Steve’s extremely functional uniform and sending it off to production, Tony switched to another project. And another. And another. The hours slipped by one by one, punctuated by repeated journeys to the coffee machine. Time didn’t mean much when he was working. It seemed like as soon as he stepped over the threshold into the lab, time almost ceased to exist. If he had been in the mindset to ponder that, he might have been concerned about how quickly it flew by--especially considering he was definitely not getting any younger--but he never thought about it. It never even entered his mind. Time didn’t matter when it was well-spent. Or at least when he was keeping busy. He liked to stay busy. Up until Steve had come into his life, ‘busy’ had always been his favorite state of being. He had never enjoyed downtime before. Downtime was a
There were two lamps, one on each side, and Tony snapped his on before slapping the overhead off.  He adjusted the pillows, doubling one up, then got into bed.  He lay on his back and pulled the blanket up to his chest, his arms free, then watched Steve surreptitiously from the corner of his eye.
talk.  Later.  If you want to.  But maybe not right now?”  he finished off his Coke and sat the glass down.  The bottom chattered on the table before it sat solid.  His hands were still shaking, Tony saw now.
Steve leaned across the center console and kissed him, cupping his cheek with one large hand. “Get us there, Tony,” he said.
eat something, okay?” He squeezed Tony’s hand. “And take a nap before tonight? Please?”
Steve opened his eyes finally. “Yeah,” he said. “Lucky.” He turned a little, trying to smile. Trying really hard. But he couldn’t do it. Not after the night he’d had. Not after the history that hung between them. “Hi, Tony.”
“Nah.  Me and Bucky.”  He shrugged.  “We started fires sometimes.”
Steve sat on the bed, leaning against the wall.  His knees were drawn up to his chest.  He looked puzzled instead of surprised.  “Hey guys,” he said.  “Um, what are you doing here?”
Steve laughed and it was okay, but Tony knew what Sam meant.  There was something off.
Steve closed his eyes and let out a soft breath. “She wasn’t just a neighbor, Pietro, I told you. She was...a friend. I’ve known her my whole life. She was like a grandmother to me.”
He waited by the car while Tony locked the cabin door, hung the key up, stretching to do it, exposing that sliver of skin Steve so loved, then came back to the car. He unlocked it, and they both got in, settling into place.
Tony felt his chest go tight, his heart constricting with love. “Why didn't you talk to me then?” he asked. “Why are you barely talking to me now?”
Sarah reached for him. “Come here,” she said. “I know you have to go, but come here.”
Steve stilled instantly, his breath catching in his throat.  He closed his eyes, his hair caught the lamplight, spinning it into gold, as he pushed himself off the bed and stood up.  “I’m sorry,” he muttered.  “I--You’re right.  I’m sorry.”
So, what the fuck was he thinking standing here outside this door?
Tony slipped his finger down along Steve’s jaw, caressing his cheek, that worried look still on his face. “Is everything okay?”
“Yes, I do.”
stubborn?” Tony shouted.  “Jesus, how many times do we have to have this conversation?”
“No,” he breathed gruffly.
“That’s why I can’t,” Tony said tonelessly. “Not because I love her more than you. It’s not even possible for me to love her more than you. But I can’t bail on her. I can’t. Not even for you. I have to be a better father than Howard was to me.”
“I know the two of you have had a rocky go of it, but do not sit there and act like you don’t think it was worth it.  Even now, after all your shit.  He owes you.
“Doesn’t that seem a little strange?  That we’ve known each other this long and have never done this?”
He snapped off a little salute, then took the laundry basket into the bathroom. He whistled a little while he loaded the towels into the linen closet, then took Nick’s stuff into his bedroom and opened the drawers until he found the right ones to put things where they went. He wanted to do this right. And not just because he wanted her on his side. He wanted to do it right because he got the feeling she already
It was easy to get used to. He usually preferred to sleep in dark silence, but he got to where he strained to hear the sounds through the wall. He could never tell what they were saying, or even if there was one, or two, or even three different voices, but it got to be almost a comfort to him. Almost something he looked forward to.
Steve frowned, Tony’s favorite lines appearing between his brows.  “Are you scared of being happy?”
Tony had wanted to kill Ross.  Plain and simple.  Tony, Wanda, Clint, and surprisingly, Nick Fury had all been on the side of just getting rid of him.   But, they had been outvoted.  Stephen Strange, Natasha, Bruce, and Sam all had cooler heads and voted on the side of mercy.  Thor had been the deciding vote.  After Loki, Tony had known what he would say, but he was as much Steve’s family as any of them, and deserved a vote. There had been a lot of back and forth after that.  A lot of debate.  Wanda had been especially keen on the idea of an eye-for-an-eye.  She had been in Steve’s head, after all.  She had experienced everything he had, from the confusion and pain of the drugs, to the multiple suicide attempts--
Steve’s own hands settled on Tony’s waist, and stayed there, not moving, not pushing him away, just holding, just existing there as if that was where they belonged, where they always belonged.  He kept his head lowered, not meeting Tony’s eyes, as Tony stroked the back of his neck, anchoring him in the shadows.
could stay here all the time too.”
Sam tipped his bottle toward him in agreement.  “He always felt responsible.  For me, for Nat, for Wanda.  She looked up to him--we all did--but for her--”
“Yes.  I do.  That’s what you do with a wild animal, Stark.  You find a way to cage it.”
Of course they did. Sam was a smart guy, good-looking, funny, quick with quips, and quick with a laugh whenever
Tony tried to be okay with it.  He didn’t want to hurt Gina.  She really was a very nice girl, but if he’d taken anything away from last night with Nat and Bruce, it was that he wanted what they had.  And he couldn’t have that with Gina.
“So, you don’t want me to say anything?” he asked innocently, knowing full well how it would affect Tony. “You just want me to be quiet? Not talk? Not tell you how much I’ve been thinking about you all night long? How much I wanted to see you?”
wrong
Tony could hear his own voice crying out as Steve fucked into him faster now, angled just right, just perfectly, finding his prostate with every thrust, sending Tony hurtling toward release. And Steve. He could hear him too, his voice a low, constant hum. Lost in pleasure, Tony couldn’t make out the words. Didn’t think it mattered. Maybe later it would matter. Maybe later he would wish he had understood what Steve was saying, but right now, here in this moment, all he cared about was the fact that he was here. That Steve was here. That it was Steve making him feel so good. That Steve was taking care of him. Just like he’d promised all those years ago standing out in the living room just there, with Howard at the door. “I’ll take care of you,” he’d said, and he was. He was taking care of him. And Tony felt like crying because it was more than he could have ever hoped for.
“I don’t know.”
Utterly perfect.
“I didn’t even give you a blow-job last night.”
young.”
“You’re Steve’s mommy?” Morgan asked shyly, and Sarah nodded.
. No fucking way.”
Steve put his hand over Tony’s.  “Yeah.  That’d be nice.  If we could take a little time.  Just us.”  His eyes darkened a little.  “If that’s okay?  You don’t mind it just being the two of us for a while again, do you?”
“Tony,” he warned.
Nat laughed.  “Me neither.  This is as close to normal as I’ve ever gotten.”
Tony touched him. Touched his stomach, his chest. His lips following his hands, finding his way up to Steve’s mouth, and kissing him deeply. “Was that okay?” he asked, and Steve laughed softly.
That had been one of Steve’s conditions.  He loved Fury and he respected Strange a lot, but Natasha was who he trusted most when it came right down to it.  At least, out of the people he would allow to know about this.  That did not include Bucky.  Or Sam.  Or Wanda.  And especially not Tony.
“Give up?” she asked, and her voice was as polite as if she were asking for more wine at a dinner party.
Tony bit into the fleshy part of Steve’s palm, making him jerk his hand away, laughing. “Do
Tony turned his hand in Steve’s until their fingers were locked together.  There were those damn eggshells again.
Bruce shrugged, giving up all pretense, as slim as it may have been.  “Pretty much.  Are you mad?”
“Really.  I love it.  It’s perfect.”
Tony nodded.  He believed him.  He didn’t believe a lot of people, but he believed him.
“Steve, I can’t. I can’t."
Steve looked at him with a frown of his own. “You bought me a toothbrush? When?”
There was a beat of silence, then her voice, as low as a con in a prison yard.  “You’re welcome, Captain Rogers.”
“You’re not mad at me?”
Some guy who couldn’t seem to stop looking at another guy.
“It’s not sappy.  It’s that ‘normal’ stuff we talked about before.”  She gave him a stern look.  It reminded him forcefully of the ones Rhodey sometimes gave him.  “But, now I definitely need to say what I was going to say.”
“Mm-hmm.  You wore it when we saw the Yankees play that time.”
anniversary.”
again. Steve held his hand tighter, squeezing it brutally, grinding the bones together. Tony wouldn’t have had it any other way. And a moment later, when Steve cried out with the force of his orgasm, Tony’s own barreled through him. He went rigid, muscles electric with euphoria, then dropped limply onto Steve’s back, panting.
Steve laughed. “No. I’m not her. And you’re right--she
"No. Hell no. Fuck them. We're adorable."
He said it in a low pout, his eyes flashing with jealousy. Tony smiled at him indulgently. Kissed his lips. “Sorry honey,” he said. “And yes. I do know him. We were friends in high school. I haven’t seen him for a long time.”
Nat walked over and crouched beside him.  She lifted her hand and Doctor Baxter cowered back as far as his restraints allowed.  It wasn’t much.  She’d tied them tight.
Steve glanced down at his feet, nodding. “I know,” he murmured. “But you were working, and-” He stopped as the phone in his pocket started to ring. He took it out, glanced at it, and shoved it back into his pocket without answering. “That’s Nick,” he said. “I gotta go.”
tend to fall apart when he had no outlet.  Steve kept him sane.  Not by being something broken that he needed to fix, though.  It was actually the opposite.  When he was with Steve, everything just seemed simpler.  He didn’t need to fix Steve.  When they were together, it felt like Steve was fixing him.
Rhodey’s face twisted in sad disgust.  “Go on.  Get inside.  You look like shit, and you smell worse.  Thank god the paparazzi’s finally given up on you.”
Howard Stark didn’t seem to notice.
Tony kissed them slowly, then ran his fingers through Steve’s damp hair.  “Yeah, it’s okay, big guy.”
“You’ll write to me every day, do you hear me?” she said, and he nodded. “And you’ll call me at every available opportunity. Okay? No. Exceptions.”
Steve picked up one of the sandbags and hung it in place.  He was warmed up but had not even broken a sweat yet.  It was ten o’clock.  Hours before sun-up.  Hours to just let his body do what it wanted to do.  He struck out with his fist.  Again.  Again.  He circled the bag, hitting in rabbit-quick jabs that barely made the bag quiver.  But it felt right.
She kissed the top of Nick’s head. “Steve likes kids,” she said in a voice that sounded idle, but wasn’t. “He’d like to have one someday.”
his friend.  The jealousy forgotten, buried under a wave of kinship.  "Why?"
Tony hadn’t realized Howard had followed him away from the party until he felt his hand on the back of his neck. He started when he first felt that touch, then eased when Howard squeezed him with a comforting sureness.
“Can I watch?”
Tony laughed a little, and Steve’s heart decided it wasn’t going to seize up and kill him.  At least not yet. “Why are
“Speaking of dragging people to things they probably didn’t want to see in the first place,” Tony said. “Are you sure you can’t go with me tomorrow? I don’t want to go alone.”
“You said it.”
Steve was silent for a moment. Tony could feel him thinking, feel the tension in his muscles, the arms holding him almost thrumming. He wanted to tell him to stop thinking. Stop thinking about whatever he was thinking about because it was scaring him, but he didn’t. Part of him--that part that still wanted him--needed to hear what he had to say. Even if it broke both their hearts, he needed to hear.
“Hang on.”
“It’s best she’s not here,” Strange answered.
“Sounds...romantic?” Rhodey said, his voice ticking up at the end, turning it into a half-question.
Tony didn’t try to catch his eye, but he did catch the blush on his cheeks.  Jokes bubbled up in his mind, but he pushed them all away.  “All yours, Cap,” he said, instead.
“Captain?”
Strange relaxed a little, his shoulders easing.  He
“Do you, um,” Steve began, and his own hand lifted to finger the cuff of Tony’s jacket tentatively. “Do you want to come with? We could stay at the Center for a while, then maybe get some lunch after? And...talk, or something?”
He wouldn’t go to Steve. He couldn’t. The wound was still too fresh.
It didn’t take long.  In what seemed like seconds, Tony came, stifling his grunt of satisfaction by biting into his forearm, leaving a perfect impression of his own teeth in the skin.  He stroked himself a couple more times as he came down, drawing out the pleasure by habit, even as his mind filled with self-hatred.  What was he doing?  Steve was in the other room, hurting, angry, confused, and he was in here jerking off like some horny teenager with no self-control.
“No,” Tony said automatically, then stopped and bit his lip. He shook his head, shook his whole body, as if trying to rid himself of something. Rid himself of Steve, perhaps. He blew out a breath and the corners of his mouth lifted in a small, sad smile. “Sorry.”
“Steve would be so pissed.”
Steve swallowed past a little blockage in his throat. His mother would have said he had a frog in his throat. But he didn’t really want to think about his mother right now. Not now while Tony’s eyes were bright and dazed on him, and he was feeling all tingly and kind of...weak? Yeah. Weak. Like all the strength had left his body and he was just a dumb rag doll sitting on the stump next to Tony.
Steve nodded. He was nervous--very nervous--but he had heard the anxiety in Tony’s voice, and he couldn’t stand to hear that. Tony was hurting enough. He didn’t want to make it any worse. And besides, he
“Tomorrow.”
Ross wheeled on him.  “I didn’t ask you a goddamn thing, Doctor,” he snapped.  “Of course, that would be your stance.  You didn’t sign the Accords, either.”
everybody. That’s why you go on trips.”
“I can do cartwheels again, honey.  Watch me!”
“It’s okay.”
Steve nodded. “Yeah.”
None of them spoke. Not a single word. Steve could hear a couple of people letting out watery little sniffs, and he understood completely. He was almost on the verge of tears himself, but for now, he was able to keep them at bay. He sat with his head pressed against the window, just watching the darkness pass. He was exhausted. He missed home. He missed Tony. And Morgan. His mom and Dodger. And yeah, he knew he was going to be home soon--Christ, he’d
“-Talk about coordinating humanitarian outreach in the Middle East,” Tony said, his memory of their previous conversation finally kicking in. “Which is why we were having breakfast and not lunch today. Fuck.”
“I don’t know,” she said.  “Wisdom comes with age, I guess.”
his brain insisted.
There was a considering silence between the three of them.  Sam broke it, his voice kind. “Go on.  Tell us.  We can’t afford to be embarrassed.”
Tony’s cock jumped in his jeans. “Again,” he croaked, almost not even aware he had spoken. “Baby. Do that again. Please.”
They lay together in the dark, the faint sounds of the city and their breathing the only noises in the room.  It was not the way Steve had thought the night would end, but it was a good way.  Nat’s body was soft against him and gave off a lazy heat that was like sitting by a low fire at the end of a long day.  Sleep reached out for him, caressing with gentle fingers.  For once, he didn’t have to chase it, and that was more than a relief.  It was a goddamn miracle.
Tony looked at Steve’s face.  His eyes were closed, his bottom lip caught between his teeth, and if Tony had not already been completely in love with him he would have fallen hopelessly in that moment.
“And then there’s
Steve shook his head. “No. Not really.”
“St-”
Now, the safest place was in that bed, enclosed within the circle of Tony’s arms.
“Not this time.”
Steve snorted a little and let Tony arrange his legs how he wanted, then when Tony crawled into his lap and settled his head on his chest, Steve put his arms around him.
Just the rain.
Tony glanced at Steve again, his smooth cheek, his closed eyelids, his red, parted lips.  He worked so hard, deserved so much…
Tony waved as he drove away, then took the pizza inside and set it on the table.  The box was still warm, and it smelled heavenly, but it barely registered as he crossed the room and opened the back door.
“So, why today?”
The eyes she turned on him were as black and cold as the night sky she had come from.  “You’re the one,” she said.
Tony jumped to his feet and ran to the door.  “Hey Pepper.  Pepper.  Pep,” he chanted, tugging her arm.
Tony held his hands up.  “You know, I really don’t think I want to hear about what you were doing.  Just do it somewhere else, huh?  For the sake of everyone?  We eat in here.”
.  That.”
Tony swallowed past a small blockage in his throat. “But?” he prompted.
“Fuck off, Ross,” Tony muttered under his breath.
“Would you like to tell me what it was?”
In spite of his fluttering eyelids, Steve felt a lone tear fall from his eye. “Nothing,” he whispered, then shook his head, because that wasn’t right. “
“I love you,” he said, making it an answer, turning it into a reason and not just a statement.
He set the cruise at 52 miles per hour, three under the speed limit, and relaxed into the seat, munching his egg roll.  He’d light a fire when he got home.  Wine, fire, rain outside the window, Steve on the couch, ready and willing.  It sounded too good to be true, but it wasn’t.  This was his life now, and barring an occasional lapse on Steve’s part, it was perfect.  It was everything he had never dared to hope for.  He’d had something like it with Pepper, but this, this with Steve so far outshined that, it hurt Tony’s head just thinking about it.
“Just this one.”
“What do I do?”
Strange ignored him.  “I believe we should do it tonight.  I’ve already contacted Miss Maximoff.  She’s en route now.  I offered to bring her by portal, but she opted for the jet.”
He went to the door and put his head against it, listening. There wasn’t any sound from inside, but that didn’t mean much. Steve could be pretty quiet when he wanted to. He cleared his throat and lifted a hand. He tapped on the wood with the knuckle of his index finger. “Baby?” he said softly. “Steve? It’s Tony.”
Humor was his fallback when he didn’t know what to say or do. It always had been. But his fallback required the use of his brain, and it was failing him. All he could think about were the implications of
“He took his wife to the Poconos for the weekend.”

Steve shook his head. “Just what Tony’s told me.”
Tony licked his lips--they tasted like Steve. Fuck.--and sighed. “Just go crawl back up into bed, ‘kay?” he said. “If you close your eyes and count to fifty, you’ll be asleep before you hit thirty-five. I guarantee it.”
'Kay, here we go again...
“That is high-level ridiculousness.”
"It was nice of you boys to come help," Jen said.  She and Tony were essentially the same age, and she was technically decades younger than Steve, but she and Jeff were
He maneuvered her back into place without waking her, tucked her back in, and kissed her cheek. “‘Night, Morgan,” he said, and she murmured something back. He didn’t know what. It was too soft to hear. Probably just sleep-talk, but it didn’t matter. He liked hearing it anyway. Dodger got into his dog-bed in the corner, and appeared to go to sleep. Steve wasn’t fooled. He knew he’d be in her bed as soon as he left the room, but Tony and Dodger seemed to have come to a compromise. Dodger stayed off the living room furniture and Tony’s bed, and didn’t beg too much at the kitchen table, and Tony looked the other way when he found him asleep in Morgan’s bed in the morning. It seemed to be working out so far. Steve was glad.
Steve started walking and didn’t look back.
“I want to say that,” Steve whispered.
Tony nodded. “Sure. Where?”
Steve grinned.  He couldn't help it.  He was almost giddy with happiness.  Tony was home. Finally. Seventeen more days in the hospital after he'd woken up.  Seventeen days, four hundred eight hours of alternating between painful cold-sweats, and a drug-induced delirium where Tony either spent the time waxing poetic to Steve about how much he loved him, or confiding in him about the tall, hot blond who came in to sit with him.  "I don't know who he is, but I'd like to climb him like a tree."
About
“Where’s Steve?”
he did, anyway. The last few months since he’d been living here. It had taken him some time to get used to having so much free time in the evenings and on the weekends. He’d never worked a job where there was so little to do. He knew why he’d been sent here, but that didn’t mean he liked it. He couldn’t wait until he was reassigned.
my family.”
Steve’s tears finally over-spilled his lashes as Natasha broke their kiss, and she took him into her arms.  He put his face into the crook of her neck, his strong arms around her tiny waist, and held onto her tightly, as if she was his only link to the world, as if she was the only thing keeping him grounded.
“No, I don’t think you do.”
“Not exactly.”
They found them in the lobby coffee shop.  Both had cups of tea.  A plate with four muffins sat untouched in the middle of the table.  Bruce tapped away on his tablet.  Steve sat hunched inside his jacket, studying his hands.  He looked up as Tony came near.
act on it now.”
"We missed you too, Cap."
Howard sighed. “Love and business rarely have much common ground, Steven.”
“You don’t seem okay.”
Behind them, Bucky reached the crest of the hill.  Half a bottle of water hung limply from his hand.  He stopped next to Natasha and Sam, looking at the pair on the ground uncertainly.
Tony. That was some other guy. This Tony was never late. This Tony never gave him any doubt, or cause to wonder. This Tony was sweet, and funny, and big-hearted. This Tony...was very late. And Steve was very worried.
I said bowling team, okay?  I bowl.  I am a bowler.  And I’ll tell you something else, I’m a damn good one, too.  I bowl a 240 now.”
?  Certainly more than him.  Certainly more than the man who had left him the second he didn’t get his own way.  Every time he thought of it, Tony filled with shame.  He’d left him.
"Now will you grab my ass?"
, and Tony was too happy to see him to get pissed off about how he'd gotten here.
I know he’s depressed, Tony.  I worked with vets for a long time.  I know the signs.”
Steve watched them as Tony stepped up beside him.  “What are you smiling at?”
Big blue eyes finally met his. “Really?”
Steve.
Thad stood up. He was nearly as tall as Steve, but not as muscular, not as broad. He did, however, exude an authoritative air that Steve could not deny. It reminded him of his father. “What did you just say to me?” Thad asked, his voice edged with ice.
“Of course I remember,” Steve said. “And yeah, I was telling the truth. But did you listen to anything I said just now? I can’t get close to anybody. Not even you. Especially not you. It’s just not something I can do. I don't have it in me right now.”
“I wasn’t mad at you.”
dated. Never had a single date in all his twenty-five years. He worked. That’s what he did. He worked. Not dating. Working. That’s what he did. That’s who he was. Who he’d always been. For as long as he could remember. And Tony was...a lot. Sudden. All-encompassing. Like a tornado that had come down from a cloudless sky. The rapidity of it all was...it was scary. Intense and scary. But beautiful. Mesmerizing.
Not alone, red.
“Nothing. He’s not your cargo.”
wrong with you. And your mom would be so pissed at you right now if she heard you asking me that.” Steve let out a tiny, watery laugh, and Tony shook him a little. “Yeah, that’s right.
The sounds he was making right now.
“I thought I lost you for a second there.”
Steve said nothing. He couldn’t think of anything to say.
She shrugged. “Yes. Steve’s nice.”
"Strange."
“Why are you leaving?” Tony asked.
to. “Hey.” He took a few steps closer. Stuck his hands in his pockets. “Haven’t seen you around much lately.”
“We don’t know that, boss.”
Steve sighed and sat back. He didn’t feel guilty--never guilty, not after everything this man had said and done--but he felt
“We’ve talked about her.”
They went to him, hand-in-hand, and knelt in tandem like a couple ready to be wed.  Natasha touched him and he opened his eyes with difficulty.  He looked at her softly, then turned his gaze to Sam.  He raised a wavering hand and Sam took it, unselfconsciously.
Steve nodded. “Yeah. Just gonna take a little walk. Maybe get a breath of air. You’re in good hands.”
Steve glanced quickly into his eyes again, then back down at their joined hands. “But she’s working a swing shift today,” he said. “She won’t be home until three.”
His tone, all tired and hurt rather than venomous, slipped like a knife into Steve’s heart.  He hated this, hated that he had to do this, but it was something that couldn’t be put off.  The end was drawing near.  Soon, someone would come and tell them it was time and then it would be too late.  Steve couldn’t afford 'too late'.  Not when the stakes were this high.
Steve immediately stubbed it out on the railing, grinding the filter against the wood.  “Okay,” he said.
And then he was gone.
“Are you sure?” Steve asked, dropping his head down onto Tony’s shoulder. “I can’t leave if we’re not okay.”
He left the hospital and lit a smoke on his way out the door. There was a sign saying no smoking within twenty-five feet of the entrance, but by the time he got it lit, he was already that far away, and he was still walking. Walking like a man on a mission. Walking like he had always walked when he
Tony wondered what he was dreaming about. But he didn’t think he would ever ask. He was afraid of the answer.
Steve shrugged. “Yeah. I just wasn’t sure if you really would.”
“Well, I was a little busy.  What with half my team being fugitives and then the world ending, and all.  It was on my to-do list.”
And he knew Steve felt the same. He knew without even asking. No words were needed. He knew. He knew just from the way he held him, the way Steve clung to him, the way he breathed him in, the way he said his name in a gasping, panting way as he came deep inside him, then whispered “I love you, I love you, I love you,” a hundred times, using his hands to send Tony tumbling over the edge after him.
Talking to Nat had been one of the worst parts. Colonel Phillips had spoken to Jonathon’s mother, but Steve had requested to speak to Natasha. “She’s a friend,” he said, standing at attention in Phillips’s office area. “I’d like to do it, sir. If that’s okay.”
he thought.
He kissed her forehead. Just a quick kiss, and he loved how good that felt--how natural--and got to his feet. Dodger stayed where he was, but he opened his eyes and wagged his tail a couple of times in solidarity before closing them again.
Tony tried to smile, feeling almost afraid now.  Afraid he’d been wrong.  “Yeah,” he said, striving for lightness.  “I’m pretty sure I said ‘I do’ to you, baby.  And I’m fucking
Sam took his other hand and held it over the table. He stared hard at Steve, willing him to meet his eyes, and when he did, Sam squeezed his hand. “You. Deserve. This,” he emphasized.
“I know. He called me.”
“I love you too, honey.” She loosed her hand from his and used it to smooth his hair back from his forehead. She kept doing it for a long time. He let her. It was soft. Soothing. Maybe it was selfish to take in that comfort, but he thought it was okay. He thought it was probably soothing for her too. He hoped it was, anyway, because he wasn’t ready to let it stop. Especially since part of his mind kept nagging at him, telling him it might be the last time he felt it. She might die on the operating table. Or if not on the table, then shortly after from the malignancy in her ovary. Telling him she would die and he’d be alone. All alone. Forever.
“Hey,” he said.  “Soup’s on.”  When Steve didn’t respond, he halved the distance between them.  “We should get one of those old-timey dinner bells that the cowboy guys used to have.  You know, the guys on the whadoyoucallems, with those triangle things?”
The shower kept running.
“That’s because you’re an angel.”
“‘Kay,” Tony said, and stepped back. Finally. Back toward the iron railing. “Well, guess I’ll see you in the morning, then. Like at ten?”
“Whatever you say.
it. And...that means, I’ll be in hers too. And I want her to like me. I want her to-” he sighed, “-be comfortable with me. And I want
“Huh?”
“But you just asked-”
Steve licked his lips. Tony was getting hard in his jeans, and seeing that tongue, that pink, silky tongue, knowing it had been on his own skin not twenty seconds ago, and knowing--
“A flaw in the design.  That’s why Rhodey can only get up to Mach 5, and I could achieve Mach 8.”
“Sincerely, Captain Steven Grant Rogers.”  He ran his hands through Steve’s hair.  “Or maybe ‘
before we were gone?  Steve never said, and Nat was kind of closed-mouthed about it, like she knew, but didn’t really want to say, and frankly, the two of you were always either shooting daggers or ‘fuck me’ eyes at each other, so I could never really tell.”
But before he even finished speaking, there was a siren, lights in the yard outside.
“Please don’t pull macho bullshit on me.”
scheduled a re-take."
He went first, keeping Tony’s hand firmly in his even though he had to trail it behind. There was still no room for the two of them to walk together. When they got to the top, Sarah put her hand on his cheek. “How are you?” she asked seriously, her eyes clouded with worry.
“Hey,” he said, catching up to Steve on the sidewalk. “What’s your problem?”
guy. Some other younger guy who probably didn’t have a failed marriage and threads of gray showing up in his beard now. Gray. Christ. Thanks a fuckload, Howard. Tony would be lucky if he wasn’t completely gray by the time he was forty.
Natasha was waiting for him when he pulled up.  Steve parked his bike and got off.  “Where is he?” he asked.
He heard the door handle turn and took a steadying breath before Steve opened the door.
Steve blushed a little, looking up through lowered lashes.  “If you’re real.  See, I’ve had this dream.  It starts out a lot like this.”
Steve shook his head. “Not really.”
“Deal,” Steve said. But he knew he wouldn’t be. At least not any time soon.
cute!” the blonde cried in what was undoubtedly meant to be a whisper.  Smug pride washed over him.
Fine.  It was fine.  But “fine” really wasn’t enough for him now.
The look of a man long-imprisoned thinking about home.
“She was running in the house,” Tony said, then shook his head and raised his hand to his temples again. “Howard always told me ‘No running in the house’, but I let her run. I let her run all she wants. And she was just wearing socks--no shoes, because, you know, Howard
Steve ignored the tears that were trying to fall. They shouldn’t be there. Everything was okay. Everything was okay, so there was no need for tears. He wiped them hurriedly away, using the gesture to pull Tony closer, hold him tighter.
Steve pitched his voice lower, but kept staring, his blazing eyes locked on Ross’.  “I said I’ll go,” he repeated.  “To The Raft.  I’ll go.”
“I’ve seen him reading them,” he said.  “Sometimes he’s smiling, sometimes he’s not.  I don’t believe you would write anything accusatory or hurtful on purpose--”
is going to put you back in the ice.  Do you hear me?  Nobody.  I will never let that happen.  Alright?  And you’re getting out of here.  You’re coming home.  If I have to blast you out of here myself, you’re coming home.  Okay?  Baby?  Okay?”
Tony drank the rest of his coffee.  “Gina?” he called.  “I need you, dear.”
“It’s not that, Tony,” Steve said, and just as Tony had feared, there was a coldness to his voice, like a shot of ice water in his veins. “I’m not just some mindless drone.”
“It was ten a.m.  You weren’t drunk.”
Steve nodded and looked at the ground again. He drew a “T” above the arrow. “‘Kay.”
Gina brought coffee, and Strange kept silent until she left.
Tony couldn’t help the relief that came over him. He’d known. It was more than obvious, but it was good to have the reassurance. “Yeah,” he agreed. “He
Steve smiled at him, sighing.  “Yeah,” he said.  “That’s the best scared.”
“I’ll do the internship. I said I would, and I will. I’ll stay at the house in Malibu. You can have Personnel deposit my pay in my bank account.”
“I’m sorry.”
“Yeah.”
Part of him had assumed Natasha would be the one to handle Steve.  But she slipped out of the room leaving the door cracked.  Wanda turned expectantly to Tony.
, Mom,” Steve said quietly, grasping her wrist where it lay on the tabletop. “Tony...he doesn’t really get it. I tried to tell him, but he didn’t understand.”
Tony raised an eyebrow. “
“Of course, you can,” Tony said, and the kid shoved the deli bag at Pepper and dug his phone out of his pocket.
“Tony,” Steve said and pointed into the meadow.  “There’s daisies.  Will you pick some?”
Steve shrugged, guiltily.
“Really?” Tony asked, and his voice was dark--almost predatory. “Because I think it
“They’re gone.”
“I want you too,” Steve said. He moved his hands down Tony’s body, catching the hem of his t-shirt and pulling it up to reveal his lean torso. He bent to kiss his stomach, licked a slow line from his navel to his neck.
Strange stood over them, his face watchful.  “Did you see something, Wanda?  Did you see what happened?”
They walked back into the living room, watching the snow fall on the city outside.  It was beautiful.
“Of course, sir.”
“I’m not playing hooky,” Tony protested. “I’m tired. I didn’t sleep very well last night. I’m gonna take a long nap, and you should too.” He could not stop his hand from reaching out and touching Steve’s neck, tracing the line of his throat with his thumb. “Besides,” he said quietly, “even if I did go in to work, you could still stay here. You can stay here whenever you want.”
Steve sunk slowly, reluctantly, to his knees. Part of him rose up in protest. Part of him railed at himself to get up, just get up tell Thaddeus Ross to fuck off, and stomp out of the apartment forever. Maybe slam the door for good measure.
He was going to throw up. There was no way he was not going to throw up.
“What’s the matter with-”
Tony whistled low.  “Shit.  Everybody okay?  Did it catch fire?”
It wasn’t like Tony never saw him. He did. Glimpses of him, anyway. But the easy, flirty banter was gone. Those soft smiles and softer eyes Steve used to send his way were nowhere to be seen. It was as if they had never existed. As if they had never been friends at all. Like they were just “colleagues”. Co-workers. Nothing more special than that, and oh Christ, that hurt. Hurt like a broken bone hurts. Like a severed limb. Like a broken heart.
