for pointing out some grammatical errors so I could go back through and correct them! As always, all errors are mine. I don't have a beta for this story, and I appreciate any errors I miss being brought to my attention so I can correct them.
"Yeah. You?"
Steve rolled over, burying his face in the pillows and groaned, hips grinding down into the bed desperately seeking release.
“I… I’ve never gone to one of those before. I don’t know what to do.”
Steve’s head snapped up, eyes wide with panic. “H-halfway…?”
“Yeah, okay. Just be careful if you decide to shred anything else. I’ve got some stuff down below that I’d like to keep.” He ran his fingers through Steve’s hair, kept him close, until the last hitches smoothed out of his breath and the tension drained from his muscles. “Feeling better, sweetheart?”
Tony grabbed a pack of wipes out of the nightstand, gently cleaned the come off of his thighs and his cock. Steve cried out, oversensitive from his aborted orgasm. "Tony...?"
“I’m Doctor Steven Strange, Sorcerer Supreme. You appeared to be in distress.”
"Good boy."
"Yes, Tony."
"Very well." Loki fixed himself a cup of tea and brought a bottle of water for Steve. He sat down across from him, accepting the meal set in front of him. "Thank you."
A wail tore from Steve’s throat as Tony began to spank him directly over the plug, forcing it against his prostate with every blow. Pleasure mingled with the pain, enough to make his cock throb and his skin feel tight, but not enough to drive him over the edge. He pleaded desperately as Tony continued, motions as unwavering as one of his machines.
He curled closer, burying his face against Tony’s neck. “I know. I do. I love you, Tony. Please don’t push me away again.”
Loki looked up, meeting his gaze. "Bruce asked for my help, and I was willing to comply."
Steve's back hit the wall, and Tony crowded in close to him. "Is this what you want?"
Sorry for the delay. Got a little overwhelmed with real life for a few days, but hopefully a longer chapter will make up for it. We're getting to the real (lack of) plot now. Hope you guys enjoy! Comments are welcome, and suggestions for things you guys would like to see will be considered.
"You- You know?"
When he walked into the lab with a plate, Tony was shutting down all of the screens. No music was playing. The silence was unnerving. “Tony? Is everything alright?”
“You’ve left me no choice.”
“So feeling like that? That’s another side effect of havin’ a damaged omega gland. It takes away the ability to feel safe and secure. To bond with others. And they did that to us. Knowin’ what would happen. I don’t know if I can forgive them for that.”
Tony stretched and rubbed at his eyes. Slowly he sat up, letting his feet slide to the floor, and attempted to look awake. "Did you need something, Spangles? Shield need rebalancing? Uniform not spangly enough for you and you want a redesign?"
Before Steve had time to recover, Tony was on his knees sucking his overly sensitive cock into his mouth. That was when Steve broke, realizing that he wouldn’t be able to escape his bonds, that all of his sensitive places were exposed. He cried as the orgasm built within him, sobbing frantically when Tony pulled back, ruining his release again.
"Good boy. Smart boy." A gentle kiss brushed across his forehead, prompting Steve to let out a breath he hadn't realized he was holding. He picked the right choice.
Steve wasn’t sure which was worse, the desperate need or the unending pleasure. He could almost feel it draining away his will. What would he do, what would he give up, to experience pleasure like this again? But as overwhelming as it was, it still wasn’t enough. He needed his alpha’s thick cock, splitting him open, not a piece of machinery. The heavy knot locking them together as he was filled with spurt after spurt of come. He sobbed hysterically, his entire being overcome with the all consuming need for human touch. Connection. He wailed around the gag, trying to call his alpha back to him.
“If Strange sent you here, as much as I hate to admit it, there had to be a reason. But if you need someone to take care of you in… Special ways. How are you supposed to get that here?”
Tony snagged his cup, fixing it the way Steve liked it again, before carrying both mugs into the living room. “I want to watch a movie. Come watch a movie with me, Steve!”
James found a variety of truly creative ways to fail at the simple task, a small smile curling his lips. There were two more falls, a wobble where his metal arm was used to catch his balance, another break in form, a few seconds spent dropping to a single knee and pausing, and finally two more flawless one armed push ups. James finished with a brilliant smile, warming Tony inside and out.
“Such a good boy.” Tony went back to kissing him with a single minded focus that took his breath away. Steve felt his hard cock pressing into his thigh and moaned against his mouth. “Yeah? You want that? You gonna be a good boy if I let you have it?”
“Yes Sir. Shall I inform Miss Potts of the situation?”
Tony coated his rim with a thick layer of the medication before sliding the plug back into place. Steve moaned, rocking back towards it as it settled against the now sensitive slick glands. His lower lip began to quiver as he realized that his cock wasn’t hardening from the sensations. He was more frustrated than before with no end in sight. He wasn’t going to come.
"No! No, Tony, it's fine. It's amazing actually. I... I wanted to say thank you. Umm, thank you."
"There, there. You're such a good boy for me. Here, onto your back. Let me get you cleaned up." Tony's hands were gentle as he pressed Steve back onto the bed. A soft warm cloth cleaned him up, causing him to shiver as it brushed over his sensitive cock and ass. "Almost done. Just a little bit more. Anything I want, remember?"
"Yeah, I just couldn't sleep last night. Kept waking up."
(See the end of the chapter for
Purposely misunderstanding his words, Tony offered him a gentle smile. “I know, sweetheart. But you’re mine now, and I need to take care of you. Don’t worry, the doctor’s a friend of mine. I’ve known him for years. He’ll be able to help fix you.”
The door opened behind him, footsteps on the tiles as multiple people entered the room. The scent of evergreen and motor oil rolled over him. “I see he’s awake. Good.” The voice was rich and deep. The alpha he’d seen in the hallway moved around into his line a vision. “Good evening, Steve. You look lovely.”
As each gland gave, Tony noticed the sensations shifting for Steve. He was no longer crying out in pain from every motion of his fingers. Instead he was subtly rocking back against them, trying to urge him deeper. When he finished the last one and began rubbing the medication into his rim, encouraging blood flow and elasticity, he was rewarded with gasping moans of pleasure. Tony released the strap across Steve’s hips, wanting to watch him move, chase the pleasure.
Steve's smile was brilliant, eyes lighting up. "Tony, I would love to."
Tony turned around as soon as Steve entered. "Good timing, sweetheart. Just finished getting ready for you. Come here." He pulled the chain from around his neck, unlocking Steve's cage and gently removing it. "Feel okay?"
He was quiet as Tony released him from the table, standing him up and fastening the harness around his torso. The wrist cuffs were bound to the lower edge of it, immobilizing his upper body, but leaving his legs free. “See? Isn’t this better?”
Steve did scream this time, as his entire body gave a painful spasm and went slack, slow dribbles of come the only proof that his body had obeyed. He didn’t even try to struggle anymore as his alpha repeated the process again, before moving to his inner thighs, searching for the glands high in the crease and forcing them to give as well. Steve felt hollow, wrung out, as his body gave for Tony. Tears slid down his face, but he could no longer tell if they were from pain or need.
"I- I tried to take care of the problem in the shower, but...I kept thinking about you and the things we've been doing and I..." He bit his lip, voice going even quieter with embarrassment. "I wasn't sure if I was- was allowed..."
Tony spent most of the next week trying to reassure Steve, and help him navigate falling into omega-space. For the first few days, Steve felt awkward and ungainly, but by the end of the week he was starting to learn how to lean into the sensation. Let it carry him away without struggling to control it.
“When they two of you are ganging up on me? Always.”
Steve was so lost in his own thoughts, he didn’t hear the alpha enter the room. When the hand rested on his shoulder he lashed out, fist clipping the other man’s jaw. Instead of trying to wrestle Steve to the bed, he stepped back, giving ground. Before Steve could pursue the opening, the older man’s eyes began to glow a brilliant blue. The restraints around his wrists snapped together behind his back, quickly joined by those around his ankles, leaving him resting on his stomach, arched backwards and vulnerable.
All of the dishes were done. Clothes that he had never seen were neatly hung up in his closet, all tags missing of course. The bedroom had already contained the largest bed he had ever seen in his life when he moved in, and now there was a huge pile of pillows trailing onto the floor. Another room on his floor, yes, an entire floor when he had once been accustomed to sharing a tiny flat in Brooklyn, was filled with any art supply he could think of ever needing. When had all of this happened? When had this become his life?
"Anytime sweetheart. I do like being nice to you. Sometimes."
He slowed the speed, letting it continue to grow steadily, until Steve was whimpering, his hips shifting restlessly. Tony ran a fingertip around the delicate skin of his entrance, enjoying how thoroughly plugged his pet was. How much he was willing to take just to please him. When the toy had become wide enough that there seemed to be no more elasticity in the tissue, Tony allowed it to stop. Locking the setting with a thought. The version of Extremis he had developed for his personal use made life so much easier. The ability to communicate with computers and machines mentally had opened up possibilities he had never dreamed of.
Dark eyes were studying him intently, as though he had done something interesting. “No. Stay. Come sit. I want to ask you a few things.”
He heard the sound of pants being unfastened, followed by the slick sound of lube. Tony groaned at the first touch of his hand around his cock and Steve tried to turn, just enough to see him, but couldn’t. “That’s right. Now, I’m going to tell you what you would have gotten if you’d decided to be a good boy. As soon as my meeting was over, I would have let you blow me. Gotten off in your fuckable mouth good and hard before I took you upstairs. I would have tied you down to the bed, spread open for me like a gift, and I would have used my mouth on you until you were begging. Sucked your dick and licked open that pretty little hole.”
"Still no answer. Anybody know another magic user who'll get their head out of their ass, and fucking help?"
A wave of heat washed over Steve's skin, his cock pressing against the cage in a valiant attempt to harden. "Is that what you want? To punish me?"
Tony took the opportunity to run his hands over his omega’s well developed chest, thumbs flicking over his nipples, working them into hard peaks. He toyed with them idly, watching Steve’s cock twitch and flex from the stimulation. Waiting for Steve to set the tone for the day. He didn’t disappoint.
Tony obviously knew the answer, was waiting expectantly. Bucky could feel the rush of blood to his face, and disturbingly, lower. “Steve’s.” He answered honestly.
"Always, friend Stark. Could we possibly have the Midgardian delicacy we enjoyed last I was here?"
"Good boy." He sat down next to him, brushed Steve's hair back from his eyes. "Beautiful."
The older man chuckled, amused as always by tormenting him. “Not today, sweetheart. We have places to be, remember? Be a good boy and maybe you’ll get to come later. Up now.”
Tony hid his smile. This was going to be fun. Omegas were such emotional little things. They really didn’t deal with denial well. “You’re what? You didn’t think I was going to let you come, did you? Not when you’re being such a naughty boy this morning.”
Steve slowly backed out of the room, giving the two men their privacy. "Jarvis, get the others in the common room. Now."
“Tony… Tony, please… It’s too… Too much… Hurts… Don’t… Don’t know if I can…”
“Steve!” Tony’s voice was harsh, snapping Steve’s eyes up to his face. “Have you heard anything I’ve said?”
“Yes Tony.”
The only downside to the episode were the words Tony whispered in his ear when they separated to work for the day. "Laugh it up, baby boy, you're going to regret this later." Which left Steve with an entire day of training, paperwork, and coordinating with SHEILD, while wondering what exactly the other man was going to do to him that night.
He could hear the quick pounding of his heart in his ears, felt almost faint from it. A firm hand on his shoulder caused him to spin around, clutching the box to his chest tightly. Tony was watching him with concern. “Everything alright, Cap?”
Tony contemplated letting him rest. Steve was so eager to be forgiven, it would be cruel to make him wait too long to be Tony’s good boy once again. Punishing him again before bed would practically be a kindness. And Steve would be so grateful. Would thank him for that too. He waited until Steve had returned to his side, curled up in his arms with quiet murmurs of thanks. “You’re welcome, pet. You know, I thought about spacing out the punishments you’ve earned. One a day for a little over two weeks. But then I started thinking about how hard that would be for you. You don’t want to be my bad boy for that long, do you?”
It felt good. Better than Steve wanted to admit. Similar to the touches to his malformed omega gland had earlier, but more intense. An almost painful pleasure. Soft whimpers escaped his mouth and he bit down on his lower lips to try to silence them. The speed of Tony’s thrusts increased and Steve lost himself. His Ma had always cautioned him to never let someone have him like this, and now he knew why. The pleasure was as addictive as any drug, overwhelming his senses and dragging him under into the submissive headspace he had struggled against his entire life.
Bad BDSM etiquette on this one, folks. But since that’s also one of the things that I love about A/B/O fics, I’m flirting with the dark side. However, I will not be writing actual non-con or rape. More Steve struggling with himself over what he wants versus what he needs.
“That’s right, sweetheart. It feels good, doesn’t it?”
"Better?"
Steve gasped, the air punched out of him at the words. His situation could actually get worse. This was worse. The man that he secretly lusted after in his most private fantasies, who’s scent could make him burn with desire for days, was being forced to take him. In a lifetime of unfair situations, this one was at the top of Steve’s list. “I can’t… I just can’t…”
Bucky snorted. “Tony don’t care about me.”
"Mmmm... On for a while. Please."
“I’ll need to get things ready for him at the tower. Shouldn’t take long. Have him readied for mounting by this evening. I’ll bring him home after.”
“If you’re that nice to me now, it means you’ll be ten times worse later. I know you.”
Steve's jaw snapped shut with an audible click. His hips kept thrusting into Tony's fist, his body tensing as he neared release, squeezing down on the ginger. It tore a scream from his throat, pain pushing him away from the edge, teasing him relentlessly. The stimulation was too much for him to fight after being denied for so long. His body clenched tight, cock pulsing over the callused fingers still stroking him.
“Why? Do you want it, I mean?”
Frustrated, Steve tried to struggle against his grip. And found himself still held in place, just as Tony wanted him. Extremis had enhanced the other man more than Steve had realized if they were this evenly matched. "Tony...?"
Tony grinned. Steve had obviously forgotten what game they were playing. He’d be reminded soon enough, and it would be devastating for him. He gripped the tube, finger hovering over the release button. “Come for me. Now!” The moment he gave the order he released the pressure, pulling the tube free.
“Why didn’t you tell me?”
He cupped Steve’s face in his hands, forcing him to look up and meet his eyes. “You have nothing to apologize for. It’s not your fault. You just… Need a lot of care, that no one ever bothered to give you. And it makes me really fucking angry, but not at you. Never at you, sweetheart. I’m just going to have to get a little more creative to get us through this. It’ll be alright. Okay?”
Loki's smooth voice cut in. "He has been rather well behaved for his first time, Stark."
Tony nipped at the bond scar. “You tell me, or you’re getting nothing, understand?”
“Understood Sir. Biometrics activated.”
“Yes, alpha.”
"As opposed to what? Because as far as I understand, if you play like we do, you're supposed to take care of your partner."
Steve screamed again, this time in frustration. "Please."
“Yes Sir.”
"I know." He snuggled closer to the other man, letting out a soft sigh. "It was perfect. You take such good care of me."
“Alright. I think I’ve got something you might like.” The toy Tony slid into his aching passage was thick, pliant, with ridges along it’s length. It felt so good moving against his channel walls, that Steve couldn’t help moaning, trying to press back into it. It was a heavy weight when Tony released it, a bulge at the base holding it firmly in place, reminiscent of the beginning of a knot. After a moment it began to pulse within him, widening and contracting at a steady pace that pressed against all of his glands in the most delicious way. Steve gave himself up to it, letting the pleasure build higher inside of him, carrying him to the edge of release.
“Okay. Let’s try this a different way. How did you get in here? Because I know I had FRIDAY revoke your clearance.”
Tony released his grip on the torn flesh, let his tongue trace the imprints of his teeth and play over the area. He let go of Steve only long enough to shove his boxers off, and drag the track pants down far enough to reveal that perfect ass. His hand slid up further, squeezing one of Steve’s cheeks, probably hard enough to bruise. Tony knew he should slow down, at least long enough to grab the bottle of lube from the nightstand, but the urge to touch and claim was overwhelming.
That was what he wanted to do tonight. Keep his own arousal locked away so he could focus completely on bringing Tony pleasure. He wanted to be used selfishly for the other man's pleasure with no care for his own. That was what he would ask for tonight when they were alone.
"And it doesn't mean... We stop, right?"
"One more for me. Can you do that, Steve?"
A gentle hand rested on the small of his back, soothingly. “I’m not going to hurt you, Steve. I take good care of my things. This is for my pleasure. To make you mine. You want to please me, don’t you?”
“Th-thank you, alpha.” He managed to gasp as he continued to grind up against Bucky.
“But as effective as that might be, we’ve already tried something similar, and the lesson didn’t stick.” Tony’s hand tightened into a fist in Steve’s hair, jerking his head back, forcing eye contact. “So we’re going to try it a different way. I’m going to give you an enhancer, one that will last for days. Then I’m going to strap you down to a vibrator. You’re going to come for me. You won’t be able to help yourself. Over and over again. And once you’re nice and sensitive, I’m going to spread you open and start that treatment. And you’re going to come from that too. No matter how uncomfortable it is. Or how much you hate it. And you will stay that way until the treatment is over. Because showing you I can do whatever I want with your body? That I can force you to take pleasure from anything I want? That’s going to be worse for you than denial. Do you understand me, omega?”
“P-promise…”
“You can. You know this is for your own good. And maybe if you’re a good boy, I’ll eat out that hungry hole of yours when we’re done.”
"I'd what?"
"Yes, Sir."
He didn’t see Tony enter the room, or what he had brought back with him, only felt the bed dip under the older man’s weight. A gentle hand on each of them was enough to guide them into the position he wanted. Steve on his back, legs parted to let Bucky rest between them, laying against his chest, face still hidden. Callused palms ran over his back, down over his thighs. Bucky wasn’t sure what he could give them, what he had to offer, but he would try. Try until they realized that it wasn’t enough, left him cold and alone. Worse after having known something better.
“No. Please? It’s gonna hurt. I don’t… Please…?”
Tony paused for just a moment beside the bed to watch Steve sleeping peacefully curled up in the soft sheets. He was so achingly beautiful that it caused something in his chest to twist. Steve Rogers was a gift that he would never deserve. Taking a breath, he forced himself to turn away. To walk out of the room and away from the tower, even though every fiber of his being was screaming for him to stay.
“Such a smart boy. Let’s see what you think of it, shall we?” Tony moved behind him once more, and Steve braced himself for the fall of the crop on his immobilized ass and thighs. There was a swishing sound and then a line of fire seared across his exposed hole. Steve screamed, struggling against the restraints in earnest as the crop fell again, but unable to free himself. The cool leather rested against his entrance for a moment and Steve could feel it twitching uncontrollably from the abuse. “That’s two, sweetheart. How many do you think you deserve? How many people have lost their lives because of you?”
"Okay...?"
Steve’s eyes were clearing, his gaze on Tony’s face. He twitched against the restraints, trying to pull away from Tony’s touch. “No… I don’t…”
"Tony! No, please, I can't! I have to!"
“I need… Please make it stop, alpha.”
Once the cage was in place, Tony began tightening it, forcing Steve’s cocklet to compress to the smallest size possible. He ignored the growls and complaints as he manipulated the soft flesh, locking the mechanism in place. “There we go, sweetheart. All nice and pretty for me.” Tony lifted the cage in his palm, squeezing the delicate package gently. The nanobytes activated from his touch, holding Steve secure and adjusting to ensure a continuous tight fit as the area shrank over time. The metal was thick enough that all Steve would be able to feel was the numbness of the lubricant, until it wore off in a few hours. After that, only the strongest vibrations would be able to penetrate the cage.
"Thought you might like that."
"I know. Which is why I'm only going to tease you tonight."
Okay, work is really boring, so I seem to be averaging about two chapters a day. Not sure how long that’ll last, so please, enjoy it while you can.
“Because I don’t mope around up here like a kicked puppy. I go out. Now go.”
“He doesn’t love you! He owns you!”
Steve had never felt wanted before. Didn’t know what to do with the constant attention that Tony showered on him. For the rest of the first day, the genius kept him tucked close. During meals he still kept one hand touching Steve at all times. Afterwards, the alpha ran steaming water into the tub and bathed Steve with his own hands, gently easing out the plug from the morning and carefully washing the tender area.
When he next opened his eyes, he was curled in Tony’s lap on the couch, head tucked into the other man’s throat.
He waited until Steve was close, cries and moans falling from his swollen lips with abandon. Leaned in to whisper against his ear. “No. Not until I say, Steve.” He wailed helplessly as Tony continued to pound into him, the pleasure building to unbearable levels. Every time Tony was close to coming, he slowed down, savored the feeling of sliding into Steve’s tight wet heat. The way he whimpered when Tony bottomed out or moved at the right angle. He kept Steve on the edge, guiding him higher and higher, memorizing every quiver and pleading whine.
“It is a punishment, sweetheart. And you earned it. If you’d obeyed me earlier, we wouldn’t be doing this right now.”
“You didn’t before?”
"You are doing exactly what I want you to." His hands slid down Steve's arms, releasing the cuffs before curling him into his lap. "Just like this."
Contrary to his words, Tony took his time over their meal. Offering Steve little bites from his fingers. Reaching out to stroke through his hair. Wiping imaginary crumbs from his lips then leaning over to kiss him. It made Steve feel soft, cared for, and he melted at the treatment. Once Tony was satisfied, he drew Steve to his feet and into a long, languid kiss, before gently steering him into the bedroom. “On the bed, sweetheart. I need to get something.”
"Yeah, sweetheart. Damn, that's a nice way to wake up. Trying to be an especially good boy for me today, I see?"
Tony slid his fingers beneath Steve’s chin, gently tilting his face up. For a second, hope rose in Steve’s chest. Maybe Tony would let him slide. Take him to bed and forget all about the last few days. “You know, I’d be more inclined to believe that, if you hadn’t already promised it all before and lied.” Steve scowled at him and a smile broke across Tony’s face. “Ah, there’s my grumpy boy. Now, where was I? Oh, yes. Since you seem incapable of behaving, you are going to lose the rewards I have given you. It will be your responsibility to earn them back. If you can manage to behave that long.”
Tony woke him the next morning with slow kisses, exploring the depths of Steve’s mouth as though they had all the time in the world. He loved it more than he could put into words. The feel of his alpha’s lips moving against his, gently dominating him, made him feel weak in the best of ways. He couldn’t help the way he clung to Tony’s shoulders, or the soft whimpers that were immediately swallowed by the other man’s mouth.
Tony sighed. "Yes, I'm alright. That's not the point. Indignation! Outrage, I tell you, outrage!"
“But you want it to stay…?”
“Stay.” Tony’s eyes burned as he slipped from the bed to rummage around out of Steve’s line of sight. He reappeared moments later, straddling Steve’s lap again and reaching out to pinch and squeeze at his chest. “You have the most perfect tits, sweetheart. You know that?”
It was awful, and he was afraid it would never end. What if his body was so screwed up he could never release the way Tony wanted him to? Would he still keep Steve locked up? Deny him any scrap of pleasure?
Steve followed behind him miserably, all his focus on the agonizing pounding of his cock. Every step made it shift in the ring, bringing a fresh wave of sensation. He ate breakfast on autopilot, too distracted to pay attention to what he was eating, only glad to be sitting still. After they finished Tony dragged him into the living room, settling him between his legs on the couch and starting something random on the television.
"Yeah, funny how there isn't a lot of time for sightseeing during the Blitz. Thank you, Tony."
A soft gasp slipped out and Steve’s eyes closed. He could feel the warmth of Tony’s body so close to his. The words spoken in a low husky voice making him throb. “Tony, please…”
He shook his head roughly, trying to chase the thought away. The image of Steve bringing the shield down on his chest, without a care for the arc reactor or what that would do to the man under him still haunted his attempts to sleep every night. The tower was empty. Felt like a ghost town. And Tony was the one haunting it.
Not only was this a fun chance to torment Steve, it was also a sign to James. He was allowed to fail. He wouldn’t be punished for it. He no longer belonged to Hydra. Tony opened his arms and James walked into them, allowing himself to be held tight. There was a fine tremor running through him, letting Tony know he had received the intended message. It would, however, take some time for him to believe it. Finally James drew back, kneeling once more on his cushion. Tony flashed them both a brilliant smile. “FRIDAY, would you care to give us the results?”
Stark, no Tony, nodded. “Let’s start with James. Alright?” Bucky nodded, sagging with relief as Tony finally turned away from him to look at Steve. “Why don’t you go order some breakfast for all of us. Maybe something sweet. Then get coffee started.”
"No Tony. It's just..."
"Oh, I think you do. I tried to be nice to you, give you a little break. I left the cage off after we... Fuck it. After we made love the other night. Never thought I'd say that, only you could bring it out of me, sweetheart. But last night, I locked you up again, all nice and safe after I wrecked you for hours. And now you feel good again. I think you like it. I think you like it as much as I do, Steve. Want a reminder that I own you."
“It’s a riding crop.” Steve let out an internal sigh of relief. Tony wasn’t going to hurt him. Not really. As a matter of fact, with the serum, he’d be completely healed from any beating Tony could give him with a crop within an hour.
"Yes Tony." It was easy to smile up at him.
"Yeah. Thank you, Tony."
The spanking went on, no rhythm, the pattern and location of the strikes known only to Tony, but it was enough to push Steve close to the breaking point. One hard spank directly over the plug was enough. He came untouched, cock jerking against empty air. Immediately the vibrator kicked to life, drawing it out, pushing him through oversensitivity, forcing him to release again and again until his body was on fire and he was coming dry. Each time was a blend of relief and agony as he struggled in the restraints Tony had built for him, unable to escape the pleasurable torture.
He was sitting at the couch, staring out the window. He wasn’t sure how much time he had lost this time. He was startled back to awareness by the couch dipping beside him under Bucky’s weight. “Stevie. You can’t keep doing this to yourself.”
“I was happy before! I had family! And friends! I wasn’t some rich asshole’s fucktoy!”He kept his face turned away, even as he heard Tony moving into his space again. Much to his dismay, he could feel tears streaking down his cheeks and dripping off his chin. The entire situation was overwhelming. He didn’t know what to do anymore.
Bucky took a deep breath, something deep inside of him finally relaxing. For the first time since he’d come back to himself, Bucky felt safe. He pressed back into Steve’s embrace, closed his eyes, and remembered what it felt like to be home.
"You can do that?"
"Of course it does. You'll be there."
"It's my pleasure. I will always take care of you, Steve."
“You’re welcome. And as for today…”
“I don’t know how, Buck.”
A choked sound tore from Steve’s throat, the tears taking him by surprise. He was hunched over in the chair, clinging to the phone like a lifeline as he sobbed when he heard a soft sigh on the other end.
His cheeks burned as he obediently grabbed the small bottle and passed it to Tony. He loved it when the older man was firm and demanding like this. "Yes, Tony."
Steve slid off the couch cushion and dropped to the floor, pressing his forehead to the carpet. Trying to make himself smaller than his alpha. The alpha. Not his. Never his. He grit his teeth, trying to hold in the whines and whimpers that were trying to slip free.
Tony nodded, held him tightly to his chest. “So you haven’t worked any of your glands properly since you presented. Steve. You must be in pain all the time. Why didn’t you talk to someone?”
A dark chuckle vibrated against the side of his neck as the thick cock began to breech him, pressing deeper than Steve thought possible. “I thought I was the one fucking you, honey.”
Tony’s lips curved upward. “Oh, I’m sure I can think of a few things.”
"I... I'm glad I got the serum, and I'm stronger. Not sick all the time. But sometimes... I miss being smaller..."
Loki arched a brow at him. "Do you believe you could have that sort of conversation without turning painfully red?"
Tony sat down on the bed, curled Steve into his lap, pressing soft kisses to his lips. “I’ll tell you what. I know you want to be my good boy again, so instead of counting your next punishment as one, I’ll take off one punishment for each hour you’re downstairs. So you can go back to being good for me sooner. Alright?”
"That's better. I like hearing my baby happy."
Tony’s mouth moved down to his chest, licking and sucking at his nipples, hands coming up to roughly massage his pecs, fingers digging into his flesh. It hurt. Steve must have made some sound, because Tony pulled back to look at him. “You don’t touch yourself here, do you?”
The edges of his vision went fuzzy. It felt like he couldn’t draw breath. He was pushed higher and higher, straining for something he couldn’t name. Tendrils of fire seemed to radiate out though his body. He could feel it spreading like a wave.
"You remember your word?"
“And I said no. That’s final. And if you keep arguing, you’ll be punished.”
He took a long bath in the amazing tub Tony had installed on his floor. To be honest, Steve used it whenever the opportunity presented itself. After years of living during a war and on the front, it was a luxury he still took great pleasure in.
“I know it’s hard right now. It’s been a long day, and it’s a lot.” A handkerchief appeared from one of Tony’s suit pockets and he held it to Steve’s stuffy nose. “Blow honey.” Reluctantly Steve obeyed, receiving soft petting and praise in return. “We have a lot of work to do, but I promise, we’re done for today. All I want to do is get you fed so we can go to sleep. Okay?”
*           *           *
"Her life was filled with tragedy and pain. Illness. Betrayal. Somehow, she managed to transcend it all, and paint the raw beauty she found in her suffering. It didn't seem right that it stayed lost. Was never seen."
Steve whined, as though he’d somehow believed Tony would have mercy on him, hips dancing in the air. “No… No, please…”
"Jarvis said you had some time, so I thought we could have lunch?"
“I was. But I heal pretty fast now.”
Tony pulls him closer, resting his cheek against Steve’s hair. “And was there anyone who helped you through that heat?”
"Thank you, Captain. It's very good."
“Good boy. Do you like what I’ve built you? It’s fully adjustable.”
He choked as Tony pulsed in his throat, staying in place until Steve was forced to swallow his come before replacing his cock with the dildo. Steve weakly struggled to free himself, unable to budge the metal straps. The vibrator buzzed faster, and he screamed, clenching helplessly around it. He needed to come. Badly. Maybe when his alpha came back, if Steve apologized for hurting him, he would let him come… He tried to shake his head again, trying to clear the intrusive thoughts. He didn’t think like that. Didn’t feel like that. Something was wrong.
“Yes Tony. When are you leaving?”
And wouldn’t that have made it easy for everyone else. No more pain in the ass billionaire to deal with for new weapons and tech. But hey, they had a king for that now. No one needed him anymore. For anything. Which was fine. Stark men were made of iron.
“We need you too. Do you have any idea how many calls we’ve answered while you weren’t here? What happens when one of the Avengers die because Captain America wasn’t there to watch our backs?”
Steve was quiet on the ride back to the tower. He stared out the window, not really seeing anything in front of him. A part of him felt like he was floating, but that was just hormones from the bonding bite. The rest of him felt numb with unhappiness. Tony was his alpha, the man he had wanted almost from the beginning. He should have been ecstatic, but it wasn’t real. Nothing was.
"Oh..." He took a breath, and gingerly settled himself onto the barstool. Tony watched him for a moment before he turned away to pull out ingredients and arrange them on the counter. It only took a few minutes before Steve was squirming around on the seat, hips shifting to try and find an angle that didn't press the plug into his prostate and then jerking the other way from the pressure. The low buzz of arousal that had faded into the background returned with a vengeance causing his body to throb and ache. A sharp pinch to one of his tender nipples drew his attention back with a gasp.
The alpha growled, mouth leaving him only long enough to speak, before he returned to his ministrations. “Not yet. You’re being punished, remember?”
“Of course I do.”
“I-it’s cold…”
He never wanted it to end.
“Thank you, alpha.”
The omega’s mouth set in a stubborn line. “I saw you on the news. They were talking about you. About us. Makin’ bets on how long it would take before you got sick of me. Tossed me out. Like you did with that woman you were with before. Sunset.”
Stark’s voice cracked through the air like a whip, and without thinking Steve dropped to his knees. The urge to curl up in a ball and hide, protect himself from the angry alpha, was too strong to resist. When he tried to speak, his voice came out thin and shaky. “I- I’m sorry. I… I don’t know. I don’t know, I’m so sorry!”
After every round, Tony replaced his cock with a thick plug. He could see that it was driving Steve crazy, which pleased Tony even more. The plug put enough pressure on his sensitive glands to keep his body primed and ready for Tony to take him again and again. By the second day, Steve’s stomach was slightly rounded. Tony couldn’t resist resting his hand over the swell of his come trapped deep inside Steve’s body. It didn’t take long for the scent of omega in heat to send him into his own rut, triggering his most primal instincts.
Slowly Steve stretched out his stiff limbs, rolling his back, putting on a small show for the other man. "Good. What about you?"
For the rest of you, I appreciate the comment that contain constructive criticism, requests, and non flaming or insulting opinions on the story. Prepare yourself for a big chunk of massive porn, because that’s apparently what I write when I’m stressed out or upset.
“Fuck you!” Steve tried to roll off the bed, forgetting that his ankles were bound in his haste. He ended up collapsed on the floor at Tony’s feet. He let out a long suffering sigh, staring down at the angry omega. “Hard way it is. Aren’t you ever going to learn, Steve?”
“Good. Now finish your breakfast and we can get started.”
"We're okay. Better than okay. We're good. I..." A blush stained his cheeks. "I like the things we do. Before the serum... I was sick all the time. Sex wasn't even something I thought about. I never would have been strong enough to follow through on any of the things I wanted, much less try anything new. And then I was better. Stronger. But I didn't have the luxury of dating or playing around. I had a war to win, and everyone was counting on me to do it. Everything was on me."
Turning his back on the city below, Tony settled on the sofa, idly sipping his drink. His eye glowed a vibrant electric blue as he used Extremis to access the internet. It took seconds to navigate to the Omega Commission website. A little longer to find what he was looking for. It wasn’t a well known fact, but there was a quiet offshoot of the OC that specialized in supplying matches for unique individuals. Those who bore a mutation or enhancement of some form that would make a baseline human unsuitable as a match. Which was exactly what Tony needed.
“It increases their sex drive. Makes them pretty much insatiable, actually. It’s why it’s recommended for difficult omegas. I put James in a suppression cage afterwards, to get him used to how his body was supposed to work. He hated it at first, but it was the right descision.”
There was a long silence, then Bucky’s voice filled the room. “Hey Stevie. Everything okay?”
"Thanks." He sat up with a yawn, leaning forward to curl into the brunette's chest. "Missed you."
"Tony, please! Want... Want to be good for you!"
Tony took his hand, threading their fingers together and tugging him to his feet. Steve stumbled on shaky legs as he followed him across the workshop and to a closed door in the back that opened as they approached. Before he had a chance to do more than glance around, he was pressed backwards onto a padded surface. Tony lifted his arms above his head, fitting them into lined cuffs that were quickly fastened shut. The portion of the bench he was lying on was curved, keeping his back arched, chest on display. His legs were lifted into protrusions from the bench’s body and held in place with another set of cuffs. His thighs were spread wide, cock and hole on display for his new alpha. A leather strap was buckled over his hips, keeping him still.
Steve arched up against him, feeling pressure against his hole as Tony pressed inside him, moaning and clinging to him as he bottomed out inside of him. His walls clenched around the other man's length.
So, for the record I will state here *again*: I write very kinky stories. Yes, I know what a kink is. I indulge in. A lot of the kinks I write about personally. If you don’t like the kinks listed in the tags, don’t read the story. You do not need to comment and tell me how much you don’t like the story, or the dynamic, or the kinks I use, or whatever else it is that has somehow offended you. Find something else to read.
Tony stood at the floor to ceiling windows overlooking the city, scotch long forgotten in his hand. He let his eyes follow the movements of lights and people, so far below that they didn’t seem real. All around him was the perfect silence of his empty apartment atop the empty tower that he called home. For years Tony had been content, but recently something had changed. The instincts that he had suppressed for so long had come roaring to the surface. It was time for him to find a mate.
"Okay. It could be... Interesting. To see what other people do?"
“Yeah. You did.”
Right as Steve reached the edge, Tony slapped his palms down onto his thighs, keeping them pressed down against the bed. His cock spasmed leaking come across his lap, the explosion of pleasure torn away. He kept him still as the last weak spasms shook him, jangling his nerves, causing tears to slide down his cheeks. "Tony...?"
“Good. Tony, I need you. Tony, please.” He craned around so he could drop soft kisses against any skin he could reach on the older man.
"Yes, Tony." Steve walked into the bedroom and took off his clothes, folding them on the chair in the corner, before opening the dresser. The drawer was filled with pairs of silk panties in his size. Cheeks burning, he picked out a pair of light blue ones, slipped them on and returned to the living room.
"You're going to cook?"
Begging and whimpers fell freely from his lips, as he writhed and pulled at the restraints. "Please! Tony, please!" His hips ground back against the wall before jerking forward into the air, trying uselessly to get some friction against his cock. The vibrations ceased for a moment, before starting on the lowest setting once more, leaving him groaning in disappointment.
“Oh, um, thank you, Jarvis.”
“My pleasure. Now, are you ready to let me make you feel good for a while, gorgeous?”
"Good boy. Let's see just how much I can make you beg, huh soldier?"
Tony laughed. “Yeah? Then why are you trying to get hard, honey? You think I don’t know what goes on in that cage of yours? You love it.”
When the doors finally opened, Tony dragged him through the penthouse, straight to the bedroom. He shoved Steve back onto the bed, watching him sprawl helplessly across it. That strange sense of weakness was back, leaving Steve passive and unable to resist as Tony efficiently stripped him before rolling him over, urging him onto his stomach. “Present for me, my sweet omega. I know you want to.”
"No. Not like what you're thinking." Steve took a drink of the vodka and handed it back to Natasha. "You were his personal assistant for a while. Did you learn anything about the things he likes...?"
“It’s better for you, sweetheart. You know that. It puts too much pressure on your glands, and if I don’t they’re going to end up impacted again. And we don’t want that. You’ll get used to it. Eventually won’t even notice it anymore. We’ll get you trained up proper, and then maybe I can put you in one of the pretty ones that other omegas wear.”
"Oh, Tony... Fuck!"
"Anything you want."
Steve stepped out of the elevator into the lab, immediately surrounded by the pounding beat of Tony’s music. He paused in the doorway, taking a moment to observe the other man completely in his own element. Holographs of various types were being modified or tossed aside as one of his new prototype cleaner bots climbed the wall like a spider. DUM-E was mixing another smoothie that was largely motor oil as the others tried to clean up tools and discarded parts as Tony bounced around the room from one project to another.
Tony gently stroked his hair, pressing soft kisses to his forehead. “I know. We’re asking so much from you, aren’t we? And it’s not very nice. But you’re being so good for us, sweetheart. And we’re almost done. Only one more for each of you. You can do that, right? Be a good omega for just a little longer? Then you can rest.”
"Fair point. Come on, up. Time for breakfast."
“Please, alpha?”
He had expected the other man to make excuses and flee. Instead his eyes gleamed and went dark with pleasure. “Really, now? Well, I suppose that does change things a little. It seems I’ve gotten my hands on a very submissive omega. Don’t worry, sweetheart, I know exactly how to handle you. Let’s get you taken care of so I can take you home, now.”
Steve allowed his shaky legs to collapse once he reached the couch, setting the box on the coffee table and staring at it for a moment. The tower’s mail screening process was intense. How had something like this reached him? Opening the box again, he slowly reached inside and removed the two items, setting them side by side on the coffee table.
A moment later a large count down appeared on the wall directly in front of Steve. "You ready?"
"Please Tony. I want that. I want to be good for you."
The break gave Steve a chance to settle, allow the desperation from earlier to recede, and for him to finally relax. After the movie was over, he rolled onto his back and stretched, bringing his attention to a new problem. Color flooded his cheeks again as he placed a tentative hand on Tony's arm. "Tony?"
A smirk curled Tony’s lips, his voice mockingly sympathetic. “What’s the matter, sweetheart? Need something to rub up against? Get some friction on that poor neglected little cock of yours? It’s been how many days since you’ve been locked up?”
"Not getting off to a good start, baby doll. I came up here hoping to reward you, and what do I find? My bad boy trying to get out of his cage."
Steve nodded.
Tony flashed a brilliant smile. "Because I'm a lucky son of a bitch. Yes, you can quote me. No more questions, we have some art to see."
Once the last of the wax was gone, the touches disappeared, leaving him breathless, waiting for whatever came next. Another pause. Clinking sounds. Then Tony's mouth was back, sucking on his nipple, icy cold around his skin. Steve jerked, felt it sinking into his bones, drawing him under. He could almost hear the sound of glass breaking, the rush of water everywhere around him. "Brooklyn!"
“Please don’t leave me. I’ll be good for you. I’ll let you do anything you want. Just please…”
It looked like the weight of the world was on his shoulders as he sat before his desk, shoulders hunched forward. Steve could feel the grief pouring off the other man from across the room. He did the only thing he could do. He went to him, dropping to his knees before him and burying his face in Tony’s lap. “Please… Please don’t do this to me. To us. I’m falling apart. I need you. Please. Please, need me too…”
"Always, Tony."
“That depends on who you wish to contact, Sir.”
He curled up on the couch, knees pulled tight against his chest. Could feel the plug shift inside him when he moved, a reminder of the man who put it there. He thought of Tony’s arms around him the night before. How good it felt to be close to someone. To know he wouldn’t be alone again. Did alpha’s feel like that too? Or did they just pick a pretty omega and decide to keep them. “I… I don’t know, Buck. I just don’t know anymore. I’m… Afraid.”
“Would you like another cup, sweetheart?”
"Yes, Tony."
Tony watched him, waiting patiently for him to settle before speaking. “You took that very well, Steve. I’m proud of you. That was your correction for the attitude you’ve been showing me the last several days. You’ve been punished, and now it’s forgiven. But I hope you won’t forget the lesson.” Steve glared at his lap, refusing to answer. “Alright, I think we need a change of location for the rest.” He lifted Steve easily into his arms and carried him into the punishment room. Steve didn’t even consider trying to run, already defeated from earlier.
“Yes Steve. How may I be of assistance?”
"Yes, Tony."
The vibrator surged up several settings, causing him to drop his face down to his arms and thrust back against it, trying to get it deeper. His hips rolled back, pace shifting with the constantly changing setting, eyes squeezed tightly closed as he imagined it wasn’t him controlling this scene, but someone else. Someone with dark, heated eyes and a wicked grin. He could almost feel those rough hands on his skin, teasing him and drawing out the pleasure. He could even imagine the filthy words that would fall from Tony’s lips as he drove him towards his peak then prevented him from reaching it.
“Yes Tony.” Steve struggled to spread his knees as wide as he could. Until he could feel the strain in the muscles of his inner thighs.
Tony tilted his face up so he could study it. “Why is it that every time you tell me something is fine, I’m absolutely convinced that it’s the furthest thing from? You don’t seem fine. You seem like you’re falling apart. And as someone with considerable experience in that area, I feel like I’m qualified to judge.”
Steve looked up at him, a mulish look in his eyes. "Oh, yeah? Well, I'm telling Bruce."
Steve moved closer, examining the bright colors, the emotion displayed in each figure. "It's beautiful."
Three weeks after the day in Romania, he brought Barnes to the tower. To Steve’s floor. The elevator doors opened and Steve turned towards the sound. He was so beautiful. “Tony? I-“ He stopped. Eyes widened. “Bucky?!”
Steve's phone chimed with a text.
"Oh God..."
“I needed your expertise, actually. I just claimed a high needs omega. Long term suppressant use, possibly for at least a decade. Obvious malformation of the slick and omega glands. He’s a mutant with a healing factor which should help.”
The dimness of the room made Steve feel more secure, however it was the feeling of his alpha’s hands on his skin that was helping the most. His thoughts were fuzzy, hard to catch. The only thing he could focus on was needing more. More touch. More skin. More alpha. Tony let out an undignified yelp as Steve ripped his shirt and jacket from his body, pressing against his warm chest and purring in the back of his throat. Better.
"You have me, sweetheart. You always will. I promise. But I wanted to spoil you today."
Tony chuckled. "Yes, Steve. You won. I knew you could do it. Tomorrow we have a break from presentations, and I am all yours all day. We can do anything and everything you want."
Tony rested a hand on his shoulder, leading him to a padded bench nearby then guiding him to lay on his back. It was comfortable, plush leather cradling his body, pushing his hips forward and spreading his legs, leaving him exposed. Tony gave his cock a few careless strokes, bringing him to full hardness, before slicking his fingers and pressing two of them into his hole. Steve moaned, rocking back against it. This was obviously less for his pleasure and more preparation for what was to come, but it still felt amazing. Once the other man had stretched him, he was pulled to his feet and propelled across the room.
Steve opened his mouth to respond just as the man began to move, thrusting into him with an implacable rhythm. Each time he seemed to force his way deeper into Steve’s body, carving a place for himself. It seemed to take forever before he bottomed out, pausing for a brief moment buried to the root inside of him. Steve tried to breathe through the waves of sensation. The alpha was so deep. Too deep. There was pain mixed in with the pleasure as his body was forced open to accommodate the massive cock invading him.
Words finally began to penetrate the haze. His throat was dry, his ass sore, and every muscle stiff. Steve groaned, afraid to try to move. “Back with me, sweetheart?” A bottle was pressed to his lips, and Steve greedily drank the cool water.
"You'd fuck me. Please. Please Tony."
Steve relaxed slightly. "Thanks Nat. I don't know. I guess I'm still used to people being arrested for being deviant. But I like Tony. He makes me feel... Special."
He couldn’t catch his breath, it felt like falling. But Tony’s arms were wrapped tight around his waist, holding him close and keeping him safe. This was where he had always been meant to be. At home, safe and secure with his adoring alpha. It was all he had ever wanted.
"There we go." He heard the sound of a zipper, and then Tony was guiding Steve's mouth down to his cock, fingers loosely gripping his hair. "How do you want it, sweetheart? Fast or slow?"
“Override: Avenger’s team captain, Steven G Rogers. Alpha seven sierra eight four echo.” The doors hissed open and Steve pushed through them. He had intended to rage. To yell and demand to know why he had been shut out. And then he saw Tony.
"Yeah. I just felt... Unsettled? The last few days. But that's gone now."
Steve could feel the flush rising over his cheeks. "No."
Steve allowed himself to be led into the bathroom, cleaned up, and then tucked into the overlarge bed. He felt Tony press against his back, the feel of his bare skin overwhelming. The lights went down at Tony's command, barely illuminating the bedroom.
Steve pulled away, turning his back on Bucky, arms crossed tight over his chest. It wasn’t fair. He had Bucky back, and everything was still wrong. All the things he was saying, it was just too much. “So you just happily let him fuck you like a whore now?”
“No! That’s not fair!”
When he finally dared to look up, Tony was looking at him as though he had finally done something interesting. “Quite a lot you’re offering me, Steve. What happens when you change your mind?”
“No problem. Tell him I’ll be right down.” Steve rolled off the couch and onto his feet, hurrying downstairs. He’d never admit it out loud, but he was excited at the thought of spending extra time with his alpha. He’d feel too guilty to ask for it, but Tony called for him, which made everything alright.
“You’re welcome.” He set the tablet aside and turned his full attention on Steve. “Do you want to finish the last of your punishment now, or do you want to have lunch and relax a while first?”
He took a deep breath, steeling himself, before heading to the elevator. No one else was around to care about his wellbeing, and FRIDAY still didn’t know him as well as JARVIS did. If Tony didn’t take care of himself, no one else would.
Remy offered a friendly smile in return. “No problem, homme. Remy know what kinda life you Avengers lead. Don’ know how happy ah’d be to come home and find a stranger wanderin’ around. We fine.”
“Let me get James settled, and I’ll be there in an hour. I’ll have the usual treatments with me, and I can get anything custom to you later. Can you have him ready for an examination?”
It had taken time and work. Neither of them were perfect, and there was a lot of backsliding. Either Tony falling into his own bad habits, or Steve unwilling to back down from a challenge. Friction and fighting and punishments, but they were still together. Steve couldn’t imagine being anywhere else. Spending his life with anyone else. “I’m good, alpha.”
Steve struggled briefly, disoriented, then collapsed against the mattress with a groan as Tony did his best to devour him. He thrust his tongue in and out of him, lapping at his inner walls, rubbing against his omega gland until he released, the rush of slick drenching Tony’s facial hair. He sucked at the spasming hole, reveling in Steve’s cries of pleasure, working him to another quick orgasm. Tony released one of his thighs, pressing two fingers into his clenching passage, rubbing at his sweet spot relentlessly, continuing to lick at the stretched rim. He pushed Steve over the edge again and again until he was sobbing with pleasure. Swollen, soaked, and needy. Only then did he become aware of the babbled pleas falling from Steve’s lips. So lost in the feel and taste of his omega’s body that he hadn’t even heard him speak.
“Go ahead gorgeous. Why don’t you get your mouth on Steve while he plays with his new favorite toy. You’ll love it. He tastes so sweet…”
Then Tony was moving back, pressing his lips against Steve's in a last gentle kiss. "Don't touch yourself."
“The reservation’s at seven, so meet you at six thirty?”
More metal was wrapped around his legs, slightly above the knee, forcing his thighs even wider and holding them there, leaving him spread open and exposed. "Tony...?"
It was too much after weeks of denial. His body felt swollen and hot. Used. He felt Tony pressing on the end of the plug, pulsing it inside his body. He could feel another orgasm building, slowly. It felt like his body was burning, starting deep in his groin and slowly spreading out through his body, locking his muscles and stealing his breath.
Sparkles danced across his sight as the drugs began to work on him, all of his limbs feeling heavy. Blackness began to creep in at the edges of his vision, even the fear of where he would be when he woke not enough to keep the world from falling away around him.
"Such a pretty boy I've gotten myself. I'm gonna have to work hard to keep you, aren't I? Spoil you rotten, get you so used to the good life that you won't ever leave me. I should dress you up in silks and lace. Only the finest fabrics rubbing up against this soft skin of yours."
“Oh no, sweetheart. You were a naughty boy today. Got me hard and wanting during my meeting with Mr. Collins and then got off and left me that way. It’s gonna take a while for you to make that up to me.” His voice dropped to a low growl. “And don’t think that I don’t watch you. That I don’t know exactly what you love the most, and how to torment you with it. Which is why I’m not going to fuck you. You get to sit there and look gorgeous, and listen.”
Tony shrugged and gave a bitter laugh. “Yeah. Had one for all of the Avengers. For all the good it did me.”
“Thank you.”
Steve moaned when Tony removed his plug, sliding into his slick passage easily. Reaching around, he lightly stroked Steve’s cock, occasionally rubbing over the head. Steve began clenching around Tony’s cock as he hardened, rocking back and forth between his hips and his hand. “See? I told you if you were good, I’d let you come. I’ll always take care of you, sweetheart. If you’ll let me.”
And the long awaited (and deserved) punishment scene. And maybe a hint of future plot. Oh yeah, this thing has plot, did you know that? As always, comments and constructive criticism are loved and greatly appreciated. Hope you enjoy!
“No. No! They loved us.”
“I can’t release when I’m out of the cage…”
"Yes, yes, please."
“Please, what?”
Tony’s fingers wrapped around the metal, squeezing it tightly as he leaned down to devour Steve’s mouth again. None of the sensation could penetrate the thick metal. He whined, rocking up desperately into Tony’s grip, and the older man allowed it. Leisurely exploring his body as Steve chased any hint of pleasure.
There was a sting in his arm. A needle, Steve realized too late. Cold seemed to spread through his veins, leaving him conscious but sapping his strength. It was almost like moving underwater. He felt himself released from the table, unable to do more than lie there. Voices moved around him, but the words were unintelligible. He closed his eyes and waited for the worst to be over.
A shorter installment this time, but there wasn't a good place to break it up if I'd gone on further. Sorry it's been a few days. Real life has gotten a little stressful, which makes it hard to write. I'm trying to get back into the habit. As always, all mistakes are mine. I always respond to comments, and hearing that everyone is enjoying encourages me to keep adding to this little (epic) story. Enjoy!
It was after eight when Tony finally returned. "Hey sweetheart, how was your day?"
(See the end of the chapter for
It pulsed in a maddening pattern, driving him quickly to the edge before stopping completely. Steve collapsed back against the bed, struggling to catch his breath. As soon as his body had calmed, it started again. First at a low setting, then slowly increasing, until the vibrations were so strong the pleasure was agony. Again, when he reached the edge of release it stopped. It took longer for him to relax this time, his body throbbing with unfulfilled desire.
I hope this is enough to make it up to all of you. Thank you to everyone who has commented. The feedback on my stories really helps.
Steve laughed quietly. “I don’t know. Can we do both?”
Tony turned Steve’s face up towards his, waiting until the omega’s eyes slitted open. “Hey honey. How does a nice hot bath sound?”
Tony turned away to start fixing his snack, leaving Steve clinging to the counter, speechless and stunned. The idea of the other man locking away another part of him for his use only making heat burn in the pit of his stomach.
"There you go. Almost done, sweetheart." There was a tugging as the ginger was pulled free from his aching ass, his cries turning to relief as the burning dimmed to a low level.
A rush of anger prickled over his skin as he rounded on Bucky. “Tony is worth everything! Don’t you ever say that again!”
“That’s my good boy. Do you know what I want right now?” His hand dropped to the front of his pants, unfastening them and allowing his cock to spring free. “I bet you can guess, sweetheart.”
James nodded, attention focused completely on Tony, obviously trying to find the trick. “Yes alpha.”
Took me a little while to wrangle my muses into cooperating, but I'm back! I hope you enjoy, this chapter was a lot of fun to write. As always, I don't have a beta so any mistakes are mine. Comments and constructive criticism are greatly appreciated. So, with no further ado, enjoy!
Growling, he flung himself back on the couch, hands roaming restlessly over his skin. He idly played with his nipples, lightly rubbing, only succeeding in arousing himself further, still with no end in sight. Even before everything Tony had done to manipulate his body and desires, Steve had jerked off at least once a day. Now, going without for even a few hours was unbearable. He cupped his cock, knocking it side to side in hopes that the vibrations would penetrate the thick metal. In response, the cage seemed to contract, suppressing him even more tightly.
“No! It’s true, isn’t it?” The tears fell, sliding down Steve’s cheeks, leaving silvery trails on his skin.
The other change was Tony. He still worked, often times obsessively, but he tried to make sure he was there whenever Steve needed him. After the gala incident, Tony had given him full access to everything in the tower, except for areas restricted for his own safety. He started to become a regular fixture in the alpha’s workshop, curling up on the sofa to read or draw while the genius was working. Steve eventually became bold enough to drag Tony up to the penthouse when he’d gone to long without food or sleep. Rather than becoming angry, it seemed to amuse him. Though Steve quickly learned the best way to get his alpha upstairs was to suggest going to bed early.
Already his fingers were itching to touch. To run over the sweep of Steve’s shoulders, down the flat planes of his back. To feel the weight of the well developed pecs in his hands as he squeezed. One step at a time. There were plenty of reasons that Steve might not want this from Tony. Or any Tony that wasn’t an alpha.
Tony grasped Steve’s arm, pulling him onto his lap and cuddling him close. “Such a good boy for me. I mean it, Steve. You’re mine, and I’m never letting you go.”
"I- Umm... Yeah. Yeah, it does."
The base of the vibrator swelled, pressing harder into his gland. He could feel the sharp pleasure through every inch of his body, shuddering helplessly as it pounded through him. Higher and higher, until with a scream he released, pulsing around the toy still buzzing away inside of him. Steve struggled against the restraints for a different reason now. The oversensitivity was painful as the vibrator continued to move inside of him, driving him through it and working him back to climax again.
Steve felt his stomach sink. As bad as his current situation was, he had no idea what would happen to him if his alpha were to die. Would he go back to the center or get passed on to another stranger? He didn’t realize his breaths were coming harsh and too fast until a firm grip on the back of his neck sent calm radiating through him.
“Y-yes Sir.”
Steve struggled to find words and failed. He’d been silent for too long and his emotions were too overwhelming. He shook his head, clinging to the lapels of Tony’s jacket, afraid that he would leave when Steve couldn’t obey. But Tony stayed.
Eager as always, Steve slid from the chair to his knees. Tony sat in the chair and cupped his chin, turning his face up. “Such a good boy for me. Close your eyes.”
Steve moaned, realizing what he had heard. "Tony..."
The bed dipped beside him under Tony’s weight before fingers gripped his chin roughly, forcing Steve to meet his gaze. “And when do I ever do anything I don’t want to? Especially just because I’m told to.”
“You sweet boy. Don’t worry. I’ll take care of it. You stay right here.” Tony disappeared into his closet for a moment, before coming back with a triumphant look on his face. “Good thing I’m a kinky bastard. I love being prepared.” He rubbed the cool metal of the plug against Steve’s throbbing hole, using his slick to get it ready, before pressing it into his body.
"I told you. It's passed all of the preliminary tests with no issue. So, I... Instituted a long-term functionality study..."
"Yes, Sir." Immediately Tony's image was hovering in the air above the foot of the bed, making him seem larger, more domineering somehow.
Tony pushed him back against the pillows, loomed over him. “I hope you know what you’re asking for, sweetheart. Because if I take you apart right now, it’s gonna be the furthest thing from nice. I’m going to wreck you. Claim you. And never fucking let you go.”
Shock was nearly as intense as the pleasure when Steve’s orgasm crashed over him, drowning him in waves of pleasure, drawn out by Tony’s steady thrusts. It wasn’t until after Steve’s second orgasm that Tony buried himself deep and groaned out his own release. Steve pressed closer, heart pounding, overcome with gratitude. He had craved the closeness of the other man. Had not expected to find pleasure. But Tony had been generous, even thoroughly distracted early in the morning to change the setting on Steve’s implant, allowing him to find a true release. “Thank you, Tony. You’re so good to me.”
Tony made his way out of the bedroom to his playroom. He put in an order for pizza with FRIDAY before rearranging the space, laying out anything he might want to use. Tony let them sleep until food had arrived before slipping into the bedroom and waking them with gentle touches and kisses. They sleepily made their way out to the living room.
Steve dropped to his knees on the pillow immediately. He wasn’t sure what Tony had in mind, but the other man was known for his creativity. Steve wasn’t in any hurry to find out exactly what he could do to his omega.
Tony stood frozen in the hallway, blinking down at the weeping man on his floor. Steve struggled to get his emotions under control. He needed to get away before he made an even bigger fool of himself. “I’m sorry. I’ll… I’ll go… Somewhere…”
He lowered his head, eyes trained on the floor in front of him, unable to get the words out while meeting Tony’s eyes. “I want you to hurt me. Do anything you want with me. I want to pay. For all of the harm I’ve caused, and all of the lives that were lost along the way.”
The strange sensation of flowing metal returned, wrapping securely around his aching hole and tightening just enough to leave him throbbing as it hardened. The top of the plug was held securely in place, folded over the edge of his entrance and applying constant pinching pressure. The inner portion then began to swell, stretching Steve’s sore passage until he cried out, pressing relentlessly against his overstimulated prostate, increasing until his body tried to shudder through another release. Once again, a bolt of pain destroyed it automatically.
"Okay. Good boy." There was a brief pause, and then he felt cool metal sliding around his balls, drawing them down. At the same time a tube slid over his cock, curving it down. He heard the click of a lock, and Tony sat back with a satisfied sound. "There we go. Would you like to see, sweetheart?"
Hello lovely people! I’m finally back! Sorry it took so long for those waiting on an update. Finally moved, settled, and unpacked at the new house. It’s been hard to find the motivation to write lately, and being honest, a few nasty comments I have received have compounded the problem.
They stayed curled together on the couch until dinner arrived. Steve stayed on his best behavior during the evening, not wanting his time with Bucky to be cut short. When they did leave, it was with promises that they would return soon.
“Yes Tony.” He flashed a small sweet smile that made Tony’s heart flip over in his chest before obediently turning and disappearing into the bathroom.
It was unusual for Steve to sleep in, more so for him to still be asleep after Tony was awake, but the stress of the day before was apparently enough. Steve didn’t wake up until Tony gently shook his shoulder, guiding him as he staggered clumsily out to the table where breakfast was waiting. Tony chuckled when he ignored the food and immediately began gulping down his coffee.
Steve’s arms wrapped around him, holding him close, offering comfort. As if he already knew how difficult all of this was for him. Tony urged him onto his knees, weight still resting on Steve’s chest. Slipped a hand between his thighs, urging him to spread them wide, exposing himself to Tony’s gaze. His heart pounded in his chest with a combination of fear and desire as Tony touched him. His cock hung between his thighs, painfully hard. Bucky didn’t know what he’d do if Tony touched it, wanted him to touch it. He shuddered, memories of pain just below the surface. “Please… Please don’t…”
“I told you. I’m gonna own you. You don’t release. Not yet. Not until I give you permission.”
"I said stop, Steve."
Tony's teeth sank into the side of his neck as he continued to pound into Steve. "Oh sweetheart. I promised I'd fuck you, not that I'd unlock you. Better learn to read the fine print."
"I know. I'm so mean to you. I can't help it. It makes you so very sweet for me."
“You okay, sweetheart? Was it too much?”
"And the organizers are claiming you offered your full collection to be put on display at the last minute?"
"I grabbed something downstairs. It's fine. Now, are you going to be good for me?"
Steve wailed, rocking helplessly, unable to move farther than that. “I told you, baby, we’ve gotta get you used to coming the way you’re supposed to. It’s better for you, and it’ll keep all of your glands nice and healthy.” Steve shook his head frantically, tears sliding down his face. “I know, sweetheart. You don’t want it. Which is why we’re starting the next phase of your training too.” Tony lifted the thick blindfold, fastening it over Steve’s eyes, making sure that he wouldn’t be able to shake it free. Next came the noise cancelling headphones, blocking out everything but the sounds of the subliminal training tracks designed for dysfunctional omegas.
“Please what, Steve? What is it you want?”
As soon as the elevator doors closed behind him, the phone chimed and the plug buried inside of him came to life, roaring away at an intensity so strong his legs collapsed beneath him, dropping him to the floor. He dug out the phone, flipping it open to read the newest message.
I'm having a lot of fun writing this, so updates will probably be fairly frequent for the time being. No promises, but I'm aiming for one or more a week. I hope you enjoy the chapter. Comments are loved and appreciated.
A sharp slap landed on his inner thigh. "Language, Steve. What would people think if they knew Captain America cussed like a sailor?"
Steve struggled in earnest when he saw Tony approaching with the needle. “No! Please! I don’t want it. I’ll be good!”
“Of course, Dr. Stark.”
"There's my good boy." Tony pulled the chain from around his neck, and fitted the key into the lock, sliding the cage free. Steve's cock began to fill, his fingers clenching into fists. He had been restrained for so long there was an ache mixed with the pleasure that increased it in some way.
“Of course. One moment and I’ll connect the call.”
"Be a good boy, and I may even let you come outside of the cage tonight." Tony laughed at the small whimper that followed his words. "Okay, stand up. Let's get you dressed."
Tony’s brows raised in surprise. “No? You don’t want that?”
He'd made sure Steve was alright, that he wasn't upset. Everything had stopped when he'd used his word, just as promised. Temperature play, at least the kind involving cold, was permanently off the table. He'd been praised for doing what he was supposed to and using his safe word, told over and over again how good he was, leaving him feeling pleased and content.
"Yes, Captain. Would you like me to order something?"
Sorry about the short chapter last time, but hopefully this makes up for it. How am I two chapters in and still have plot rather than porn? Is this a new record for me? Anyway, enjoy and let me know what you think in the comments!
His voice dropped to the dark tone Steve was learning to love. "Did you like it? Knowing the only person who could touch you was me?"
Steve had frozen at the unfamiliar voice when JARVIS spoke, but once he realized the exam was happening he began fighting harder against the restraints. Tony enjoyed watching the omega struggle, but he also needed to reinforce the idea that he was never going to win. Using extremis, he manipulated the collar, anchoring it to the surface of the table, robbing Steve of what little leverage he had. He screamed in anger, struggling until he was breathless and exhausted.
“Tony…?”
Steve rested against Tony's shoulder, watching as a stocky man began setting up a variety of ropes onstage. Off to the side a slender man with black curls was kneeling, covered in a green silk robe, head bowed obediently. As he watched the dominant man move confidently around the space, he began to seem familiar. Something about the low tone of his voice, the gestures. He had the strange feeling that he knew him from somewhere.
“So what’s the truth?”
Steve was still struggling, trapped between pleasure and pain, unable to crest the edge. His movements became increasingly frantic as he tried to force himself over by willpower alone. Tony watched him with pleasure, enjoying the way his sweet boy was utterly falling apart, giving him and James everything they wanted and then some. “Ready to come, sweetheart?”
"Not yet. Jarvis, try the Sanctum again. I swear to fuck, if he doesn't get his ass here, the next time he needs help my answer is gonna be a punch in the face!"
His skin was covered in sweat, a pool on precum on his thighs, wrung out and exhausted, when it started again. The highest setting yet. Steve screamed, back bowing so hard it hurt. His hands flew to the cage, tugging and pulling at it, desperate for it to come off, to get some relief from maddening arousal that had been torturing him all day. The metal didn't even bend, strong enough to withstand a super soldier, as promised.
Steve was watching him, hesitant and hopeful. “Please Buck? Please let us try.”
The other man strode over to where he was standing and drew him into a kiss, hand gripping the back of his neck softly. Steve could feel his worries recede and he allowed himself to melt into the feeling of Tony's mouth moving over his. Tony drew back relatively quickly and chuckled as Steve leaned forward to try to chase after him.
Tony offered him a crooked smile. “Yeah, loved. You are my sweet little omega. My mate. And I love you.” He brushed the tears from Steve’s cheek. “It’s alright if you don’t say it back. If you never do. That isn’t something I ever want to hear you say because you think you have to. Alright?”
Finally stepping away from the punching bag, Steve went to take a shower, thinking of his mysterious Sir. A moan slipped free when the water first hit his skin, all of him sensitized from the constant denial. His hands slid over his shoulders, down to cup his pecs and tease at his small pink nipples, pinching and rubbing. It felt even better than usual, causing his cock to twitch in the metal confines of the cage attempting to harden before throbbing relentlessly when it couldn’t.
Steve took the stairs down the few floors to Tony's workshop, surprised to find it quiet when he entered. "Tony?"
It took nearly a year and a half before Steve was able to proudly tell his alpha that he was pregnant. Even better, Bucky was too. Just a few weeks farther along than Steve. Tony hadn’t let him out of his arms or his lap for days after he’d received the news. Overjoyed at the idea that they were starting their own family. He bought and built so many things for the nursery that Steve had no idea how they would fit them all in a single room.
Steve struggled against the shackles, desperately trying to break free. “I’d like to see you fucking try!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes Tony.”
“Good boy. Now… Do you think you can tell me what upset you so badly? Or do you need more time?”
"Yeah. Did you?" He eyed Tony with an arched brow.
"What?"
Hello lovely people! I’m sorry it took so long to work into the story. But finally, the reveal of who Bucky has been secret dating! Ta da! Oh, and a good helping of more kinky porn. Because apparently that’s all I write.
“Yes alpha, thank you.”
James knelt down, carefully positioning himself, metal arm folded against his back, cage gleaming between his thighs, waiting for Tony’s word. Once he was given the signal, he carefully lowered himself into a perfect push up, gaining himself a reward, and proving that he could do it. On the next, his arm wobbled dramatically, sending him crashing to the ground. Steve groaned miserably, knowing where they were headed.
"I..." Steve's eyes widened, blinking up at the other man in shock.
“I believe you.” Tony’s thumb brushed over the tear tracks on his cheek. “I’m pretty sure that you’d willingly jump off a cliff to prove yourself to me right now. And that isn’t right either. Okay. New plan: I’m going to show you to your room, and make sure you’re all settled in. You’re going to get a good night’s sleep, because you look like you need it. Then we’re going to talk in the morning. You’re here for the foreseeable future. We need to figure out if we can work together without you seeing the version of me you know, and me seeing the version of you that I know. Okay?”
Tony turned to him with a wicked grin and Steve shuddered. It was still early in the day. They had a long way to go.
Tony's eyes narrowed, boring into Steve's. His lips slid into an evil smile as he gestured to one of the barstools at the counter. "Why don't you have a seat while I make us breakfast?"
Steve blinked a few times, distracted from the words by the dark purr of Tony's voice. "Umm... Yeah. Yeah, sure. Thank you, Tony."
“No. Not really. Are we okay, Tony? Really?”
“I can! And if you’d stop fighting me for half a minute…”
Steve buried his face against Tony’s chest, couldn’t get the words out if he was looking at him. “I… Wanted to know. If it was true. I… Looked up things. How I grew up. Suppressants. Cages. You… It… It was too much. My Ma… I always believed in her. She was… So strong. And smart. And she loved me so much. Or I thought she did. But… How could she… If I was… If I’d been normal, not like this… I’d be dead. And they just, what? Didn’t care? About me? About Buck? Any of the other kids we grew up with? I thought they’d been taken in, but a lot of them… They died, Tony. My friends. My family. They weren’t taken away. They died. Because our parents killed them.”
“A week. It’s been a week!”
Now, on with the porn!
Steve willingly spread his thighs for the alpha, shocked when instead of teasing or torturing him, Tony unfastened the cage, sliding it off and setting it aside. A cry tore from Steve’s throat as Tony eagerly sucked his soft cocklet into his mouth. The warm, wet heat almost immediately pushed him into release. It had been nearly two years since Steve had felt anything but smooth metal around his cocklet. The suddenness of the contact was overwhelming, and Tony was insatiable. He kept sucking at him as Steve writhed and groaned beneath him, rocking back desperately against the dildo, needing to feel something deep and hard inside of him.
I’m feeling benevolent. Have another chapter of kinky porn, complete with some sweet aftercare.
"Captain Rogers."
“Making you what? Enjoy it?” Tony ground his hips against Steve’s ass, enjoying the way his jerky movements tugged on his knot.
“You stay right there. Do not move. Understand?”
Tony closed his eyes, took a slow breath before opening them again. "Absolutely. Sounds like I'm getting rewarded too. Jarvis?"
“Damn right I will! I’m not gonna let you do this to me!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Good, Tony. Safe. You… You always make me feel so good. Even… Even when it hurts.”
“Remember sweetheart, every hour you’re here counts for one of your punishments. I’ll see you in the morning.” Before the door closed behind him, the last sound Tony heard was Steve’s frantic wails.
“Good. Now, I need to get an idea of where you’re at, and what needs to be done. I have some questions that I’m going to need honest answers to.” He waited for Steve to nod before continuing. “I won’t judge you for anything you tell me, honey. And this information stays just between us. Before the serum, did you have a designation?”
Tony gently brushed the tears off his cheeks. “Are you alright, sweetheart? Is it too much? I don’t want to draw this out more than it has to be, but I don’t want to hurt you, either. Talk to me.”
His head jerked up. He didn't know how long he had spent lost in his thoughts, but there was no sign of the waiter aside from glasses of a rich dark wine sitting on the table. "Yeah. Yeah, sorry. I just- Sorry."
When his knot deflated, Tony gently slid free from Steve’s body, fitting the plug snugly into him, trapping his come inside. He tucked the thick blankets over them, arms wrapping around Steve’s waist, holding him close. The lights turned out, leaving him staring into the darkness until he fell into an exhausted sleep.
"Yes. Please, God please..."
Muscles spasmed in small twitches, his breath still ragged. Steve could feel the glands in his nipples pulsing against the grip of the clamps, his passage clenching repeatedly around the toy still strapped inside of him. “Alpha… Alpha, please.”
“Naughty boy. I bet I know what you’re thinking about.” He shook himself, expression becoming more serious. “Besides, you’ve been most of the way down all day, and I think you might need that even more. You ever been in omega-space before?”
When Tony returned to the couch with the specific menu he'd been looking for, extolling the virtues of whichever cuisine he'd decided was a crime against humanity that they hadn't tried together yet, Steve simply curled into his side, smiled, and agreed to whatever he wanted. He wasn't there yet, but Steve might be starting to fall for Tony Stark.
I’m on a roll today, so I’m running with it. Enjoy the update!
I can't sleep, which means you guys get an extra chapter! I really meant to get to the gala, but the boys distracted me. Next time! Comments are always welcome and encouraged. Enjoy!
Tony’s knot grew wider, pressing against the inside of his hole, making the area prickle with discomfort, similar to the pins and needles feeling of a limb going to sleep. Strong arms wrapped tight around him as he cried, until his head felt stuffy and his eyes ached. Tony slipped gently from his body, pressing against Steve’s shoulders, urging him to remain where he was on the bed. A moment later the plug from earlier pressed against him and slipped inside, pulling another painful spasm from his body.
Steve turned slightly to look up at his alpha. “I know what I want to name the baby.”
“That’s right. Would my good boy like to know what his choices are?”
“No alpha…” Steve hung his head in shame. He couldn’t even listen right.
Steve shook his head again. “No! Alpha, Tony, please. You’re not listening to me! I don’t want that. I don’t want to go further away from you. I want to stay here. In our home. With you. If… If I haven’t already ruined everything… I… I want another chance. To be good for you. I-I miss my alpha… Please, don’t send me away…”
After he had bonded with the other man, he had asked JARVIS for help learning as much as he could about omegas and how they were treated. Since he’d registered as either a beta or a null, Steve hadn’t been required to take the secondary gender education classes, and there was a lot he hadn’t known. Tony had been right. It was common for sexually dysfunctional omegas to be caged, and over time trained to a smaller size. The prevailing thought was that removing any alpha-like physiological quirks helped omegas to function better. Tony was taking care of him. But God, did he hate it.
Steve felt dizzy with arousal, slick leaking down his thighs, squeezing desperately around the toy still buried inside of him. “Yes. Please yes. Need you.” His head tossed from side to side restlessly. He couldn’t stay still.
Tony soon appeared at his side to spirit him away from the fiasco, leaving a crowd of reporters to interrogate Sunset on hiding her true designation for so long. As soon as they were safely in the limo, Tony burst into peals of laughter, unable to hold it back any longer. “You little shit! I can’t believe you did that. How long have you been planning this, sweetheart?”
“Oh sweetheart… You haven’t ruined anything. And if you want to stay with me, then I’d be a fool to tell you no. Come here.” Tony gathered him closer, bending down to press their lips together in a soft kiss. Steve trembled in his arms, melting into the embrace. Nothing had ever felt better than the gentle movements of Tony’s lips against his own. When they finally parted, Steve offered him a shy smile.
Tony sighed. “The longer my come stays inside of you after your heat, the better the chances of you getting pregnant, sweetheart. And I can’t imagine anything I want more. The idea of you carrying our child…” He shook his head. “But if you’re not ready for that, I understand and I want you to tell me, alright?”
“It’s not like that.” Tony’s arms tightened around him. “But I think it’s going to take a while for you to really believe me. That’s okay, Steve. I’ll prove it to you.”
He smiled when their eyes met, but there were shadows beneath them from lack of sleep. “Of course, sweetheart. But I did want to talk to you. Have a seat.”
“There’s my sweet boy. Ready?” He waited for Steve to nod before turning the vibrator on again. It was no longer painful, the gland itself still feeling numb. Which meant he could focus on how the rest of him felt. A different kind of torture. His nipples were still aching, the pressure from the clamps going straight to his groin. His rim was clenching around the vibrator, but it was too narrow to provide any satisfaction, and too short to press as deep as he needed it.
"Yes, Tony." Steve was out of the room in record time, determined not to give Tony extra excuses to punish him. He was waiting on the bed, as ordered, when he heard the other man enter the room. A soft clink was heard as something was placed on the nightstand.
Steve stared at the ground, more conflicted and confused than he’d been before. “I’m sorry, Buck. I… I didn’t mean to upset you like that.”
"I... Umm... I needed to ask you something."
"Thank you, Steve."
Steve let out a small huff, chest tight with apprehension. Trust for his mate finally won out. “Fine. Three days. We’ll try it your way. Alpha.”
“And if I don’t?”
"I..."
Steve glanced up at Tony through his lashes, shy and a little hesitant. His voice came out a breathy whisper. “Tony, will you please collar me so everyone knows that I belong to you?”
A part of him had been hurt too many times and was waiting for the other shoe to drop. The rejection to come. By all rights, Tony should hate him. If for no other reason than what this world’s version of himself had done to him. How could he have tried to harm a man as kind and giving as Tony? And what happened when the older man got sick of taking care of him, of how dependent Steve was, and kicked him out of the tower? God knew he’d learned exactly what that felt like only that morning. Could he survive it again?
"Yeah. Now, tell me the truth. Did you not hear me, or did you choose to ignore me?"
Steve obediently slid out of Bucky’s arms and moved to stand behind Stark. Steve who had never obeyed a single order or command in his entire life. And why the hell was he calling Stark alpha?
“I was thinking about us, and-“
"Please. Tony, please. Let me- Let me come. Please. I'm begging you. Please."
A moment later the plug buzzed to life, pressed tightly against his prostate, making him want to scream. His arm jerked hard enough to knock into the table, causing water to slosh over the rim of his glass and pulling Tony’s attention back to him. “You alright?”
Fury stood and began to pace. “Yeah, sounds about like what you’ve been trying to sell for a while now. Only you’re out of time. Your hormonal levels are so fucked up, they don’t even know where to start. I have been advised that the only solution is a medical guardianship.”
"I bet you can." Tony carefully set him down on the edge of the bed, as though he was afraid he'd hurt him by accident. "Such a pretty boy."
"You will be. For starters, I think you've earned yourself a few more days locked up. We have to teach that disobedient little cock of yours some manners, now don't we?"
“You’re welcome, darling.” Tony stretched out fully, pulling Steve along to lie on top of him, his face tucked into the side of Tony’s neck. The sudden movement jarred the plug inside of him, resulting in another spike of pleasure and a following burst of pain to ruin it. He tucked himself closer, burrowing into Tony’s body. Steve had never realized how attuned he was to this man. How soothing his touch and scent could be. He had a brief moment to wonder just how long he’d been in love with Tony Stark, before sleep pulled him under once more.
The deceptively kind tone only made Steve’s nervousness spike. Tony could be truly devious  when he chose to be, and Steve had unintentionally turned all of that attention on himself. “Maybe… Maybe we could have breakfast first? Alpha?” His voice squeaked slightly on the last word.
“Yeah. Sorry Tony. I was just thinking that I’ve been working so much lately that we haven’t really had a chance to do this much. I’ve missed spending time with you.”
"What's going on with you and Stark? Come on, you've been walking around with a dopey look on your face for a week. What happened?"
"Yeah?" Steve's voice was muffled, wavering slightly.
"Ten? Ten what?"
“You’re welcome. You just stay right there.” Tony pressed the ice pack against Steve’s cock, holding him down against the bed as he yelled and struggled in his grasp. Tony made sure the cold had a chance to seep deep into the sensitive flesh before he reset the nanobots, allowing Steve’s cock to finally soften. Steve breathed a sigh of relief when Tony removed the ice pack and replaced the cage. He made sure to thoroughly coat the inside with the lube he’d chosen before tightening it down around the numb flesh, knowing it would make it worse when Steve’s cock tried to harden later. And it would. Tony would see to it. The idea of Steve’s body getting aroused, even as his ass was on fire, made Tony want to pound him through the mattress.
Steve nuzzled into his hand, relief rushing through him. "I missed you too. I don't like you being gone."
“They said I’d be a liability…”
He blinked, head spinning from the rapid shift in conversation. "Yeah. They're beautiful, Tony. Thank you."
Steve choked on a scream as the vibrator ticked higher, heard Tony chuckle. "Please, please Tony, it- it hurts..." He trailed off on a whine.
He let out a groan and turned his face into the spray, trying not to remember the time he’d spent standing in the doorway watching Tony’s clever hands manipulate holograms and machinery. Like a creep. Or a stalker. Because no matter what he did he couldn’t get the other man off his mind. Couldn’t stop fantasizing about what it would feel like to have those callused fingers running over his skin.
I think this might be the filthiest thing I’ve ever written. I’m not sure if I should be ashamed or proud. And we have Tony’s POV. Let me know what you think in the comments, and if you have any ideas or requests for kinks to make an appearance in the story. Enjoy!
“Thank you, baby girl.” That having been dealt with for the time being, Tony let his thoughts turn to more pleasant things. Watching James and Steve fall apart for him earlier had been one of the best moments in his life. And using each of them as the other’s tool of destruction… Well honestly, it gave him ideas. Ideas that Tony was intent to put into practice as soon as possible.
Despite Steve’s protests, Tony continued his ministrations, rubbing the gel into his gland, removing his fingers only to cover them again and return to work. Steve’s entire passage was soaked in it at this point, and throbbing without respite. He was moaning and writhing constantly, no longer able to control himself. Just as his body began to tense, passage fluttering around Tony’s fingers in pleasure, he pulled out, wiping his hands on the sheets.
“I made it just for you, sweetheart. Don’t worry, it’s not permanent. Just for tonight. It’s going to keep you stretched open for me, so first thing in the morning I can slide right into you, no prep needed. Fuck you hard, just the way you need me to, so you’ll feel me all day long.”
Steve did tell Bruce. As soon as he found him working in his lab. Then stood at the back of the room, smirking, as he gave Tony the most impressive lecture on responsibility, safety, and "not fucking experimenting on yourself" that anyone in the tower had ever heard. The other Avengers may have watched on a screen in the common floor living room. Natasha may have provided popcorn.
"Midgardians are strange."
“Such a sweet boy for me.” He snagged the blanket from the end of the bed, wrapped it tightly around them both. “I didn’t push you too far, did I?”
Steve nodded. “Yes… An omega is… Trained. Not to touch. Especially after mating. Only the alpha gets to decide. It’s another way of showing they’re claimed…”
Steve could only move an inch or so back before being stopped by the plug, and a similar distance forward before hitting what felt like glass with the head of his cock. "What...?"
He offered Steve a soft smile. “I asked if dinner was alright. If you liked it. If not, I can always get you something else.”
"I do. I just didn't think..."
"That's right baby. You keep on doing that. Try to get some touch on your poor abused little cock. See if it helps."
Loki met his gaze, eyes wide. "I beg your pardon?"
Tony takes a deep breath before leaning back to look Steve in the eye. "I have a long history of pushing people away, and the ones I don't, they leave anyway. I've never been good enough for someone to stay."
Bruce continued in a professional tone, ignoring the outburst, hands sliding up to pinch Steve’s nipples and squeeze his breasts. “Responses normal. Fully developed here as well. Good.” His hand moved to squeeze Steve’s cock, exploring the length and rubbing a thumb over the head, before dropping down to cup his balls, weighing them in his palm. “Genitalia is overdeveloped for an omega. He was probably put on suppressants before he started puberty. Not the worst case scenario, but not the best either. I would highly recommend having him fixed. It’s a simple procedure. I can do it under an hour, if he’s thoroughly emptied beforehand. If he heals like my James did, he’ll be fully recovered before the anesthesia wears off.”
Just as the familiar rush of orgasm started to break over him, there was a loud crackle of electricity and a searing pain shooting through his tender cock and balls. He howled, trying to struggle free in vain. The searing agony seemed to rob all of the pleasure from his orgasm. Weak pulses spurted from the slit of the cage as Tony continued to press and rub against his prostate, but there was no pleasure or relief. He felt tangled up and agitated, body still needy and throbbing despite the release. “Tony… Tony please…”
“Yes, actually. My counterparts and I maintain the flow of the timeline, and several key pieces therein. If certain events were to occur unchecked in any reality, it could have devastating effects on all of them.”
“Most people have a secondary gender. They present sometime after puberty. Betas don’t show any outward characteristics, and have fewer instinctive drives and needs. Alpha’s are dominant. They’re strong and in control, and pretty much run society. Omegas are needy and weak. Can’t function without an alpha to take care of them. They’re… We’re… Slave to our instincts and desires…”
"Tony...?"
"Alright...?"
“Put on a show for me. Because if you don’t? I will.” He set a slim remote on the table beside him. A silent warning. Steve nodded, gathering his strength. He pushed his toes against the floor, hand resting on the front of the bench, rolling his hips against the toy. He had barely started when Tony was telling him to stop. He leaned back, waiting.
"Yes..."
The strap on the gag released. Tony’s hands gently eased it out of his mouth, before cupping his cheeks and tilting his face up. Steve whimpered, hesitantly opening his eyes. Concern was etched across Tony’s handsome face. “Steve? What happened? What’s wrong? JARVIS notified me. He said you were in distress…” The words caused further sobs to pour out of him. Tony had only come back because the AI had told him he needed to. Not because he missed him. Wanted to see him.
Almost as though he knew what Steve was thinking, the alpha wrapped a hand around his cock, squeezing for a moment before stroking over the hard length in tandem with his movements. The bulge of the alpha’s knot was slowly growing, tugging against Steve’s rim on each thrust. Soon it would be locked inside of him, the alpha’s come buried deep, marking him up on the inside. Steve continued to fight against the restraints, desperate for them to give, allow him to escape. He wasn’t used to holding back his pleasure, knew that despite what he wanted, he would reach release soon. The alpha would ensure it.
“Always.”
Steve took the elevator to Tony's office, the secretary immediately waving him in when she saw him. "Hey Tony."
." The emphasis on the word was clear. Tony wanted to show Loki and Bruce that they were here for the same reason. That they were on the same side, with no intentions to betray them.
"I love you too, Tony."
Tony smiled at him when they pulled up to the red carpet. "Ready? Let’s go." He slid out of the door with practiced ease then turned back to take Steve's hand and help him out of the car. Once he was on his feet, Tony offered his arm like he had at the penthouse. Without hesitation Steve slid his arm through and allowed Tony to lead him through the sea of flashing lights and voices calling their names and shouting questions.
Tony let out a long sigh. “Oh Steve…” He curled a hand around the back of his neck, holding him against his thigh, the other began softly stroking through his hair. Soothing. “You don’t get it, do you? You scared me today. I spent hours watching you throwing yourself right in the path of danger. You care so much about everyone else, and so little about yourself.”
Tony reappeared with a large bench, similar to some gymnastic equipment Steve had seen. It was a few feet tall, standing around hip height, with a heavily padded top. From the center a modest sized dildo stood proudly. Steve walked closer when Tony motioned him to stand, allowed himself to be lifted over it, sinking down easily on the toy. When it was fully seated, his hips flush with the padding, Steve found that his toes could barely reach the ground.
“Are you…”
Donning the suit, he flew to Romania to meet up with the rest of his “team” for this mission. Charles owed him a favor and Tony had finally called to collect. He had assured him that only the best would be sent to help him recover the man known as the Winter Soldier. James Buchanan Barnes. The love of Steve Rogers’ life.
"Yes, Sir."
"Tony... Honey..." Steve sat up, wrapped his arms tightly around his lover. "I'm a big boy. If you do something that I don't like, I will tell you. I have before. We have a safe word for a reason. And you're so careful with me. Make me feel so... Cared for. Appreciated. Special. I'm not going anywhere." A smile quirked his lips. "I'm pretty gone on you, doll."
"So pretty for me. Such a sweet needy boy. I love you like this." A rough hand twisted in Steve's hair, jerking his head back. "I only asked you for one thing. One simple little thing. And you couldn't even do that. Do you really think that's the kind of behavior that deserves a reward?"
Steve nodded against Tony’s shoulder, clinging to him for comfort. “I’m sorry.”
"And now?"
“Oh, baby. You have glands here too. They need to be worked to help you release. You should be soft here, not rock hard. Don’t worry. I’ll take care of it. But you’re going to have to be patient. It might be awhile before we can get your body ready to release like you should.” He kneaded Steve’s chest forcefully, the touch as demanding as the tone of voice it accompanied. It made a shiver run down his spine, tightening his muscles and squeezing his passage around the plug. Steve imagined he could still feel the heat of Tony’s come, fucked deep into him and trapped in place by the toy.
“I know you can, sweetheart. You’re going to be very, very good for me.”
“I liked you being here. As a matter of fact, you are welcome in my penthouse or my bed whenever you like. You always have been.”
Steve jerked up into Tony's body, all semblance of a rhythm lost, desperately chasing the overwhelming pleasure. His body was burning with oversensitivity, pain twining with the pleasure as Tony forced him over the edge again, screaming the other man's name.
“Wonderful.” Strange stood up, hands making oddly graceful  gestures through the air. They were quickly surrounded by shapes painted from orange light. Steve tried to lean forward, to see them closer, but they seemed to rush around him, causing his stomach to lurch like it had when he was sick. He dropped to his hands and knees, only then realizing he was in a dimly lit apartment alone, not the sitting room with Strange.
He lost track of how many ruined orgasms he was forced to endure. How much time had passed. Steve was wrung out and helpless, throbbing with need and too sensitive to endure even the slightest touch. He was given a reprieve. A pause in the constant cycle of torture, allowing him to catch his breath. When he opened his eyes, Tony was standing over the bed, eyes glowing that unnatural blue as he slowly and deliberately stripped.
Tony smiled approvingly. “Such a smart boy. Alright, honey. You just enjoy yourself.” He waited until James had buried his mouth back between Steve’s slick cheeks before turning the vibrator back on, this time a few settings higher. He seated himself in the chair, watching as James moaned into Steve’s hole, driving him over the edge and pulling back at the last moment, twice, causing Steve to wail in disappointment again and again, before finally succumbing to his own pleasure. James collapsed to the floor as his body twitched and spasmed through every last shock of pleasure. This time, instead of turning the toy off, Tony decreased it to the lowest level, watching James tremble as his arousal slowly built once more.
“What?”
Tony fumbled with the fastening on his pants, freeing his cock as he slid up to straddle Steve’s shoulders. “I’m sorry, baby. I’ll take care of you later, I promise. But I need you right now. Be a good boy and let me have you.”
Tony couldn’t stop staring at the man in his arms. Some of Steve’s fear had calmed, but he was still curled into a tight ball, clinging onto Tony’s arms, and begging for even the smallest scraps of affection. Given what he had learned about his own counterpart, Tony couldn’t blame him for being afraid of immanent rejection. But seeing him like this made Tony’s heart ache. He was so lovely and needy. All he wanted was to feel safe and cared for. Which Tony could provide.
Tony put on his best offended expression. “What makes you think we’re going to gang up on you?”
"Too much?" Steve nodded frantically and Tony laughed again. "I know. This? This is only the very beginning of what I like. Of what I want. Still want to promise me anything?"
“Damn right.”
"Damn it." He stood there panting and uncertain, letting the hot water wash over him. Frustrated he switched off the shower and stumbled out, barely drying off before pulling on clothes and heading down to the workshop.
Steve gasped, eyes wide. “You can’t! Tony, please!”
"I do, Tony. I have to know."
“What are we up to, FRIDAY?”
There was the sound of a door opening, voices raised in greeting. Steve let everything fall away, focused completely on the task at hand. He wasn’t certain how long he knelt there, floating along, letting the world pass by unnoticed around him. There was an occasional pulse or twitch of Tony’s cock in his mouth, but he was being so good, holding still and doing nothing to tease or arouse. But even as the thought passed, he wondered if that was what he wanted to do. Tony had given him options, after all. Did he want to be a good boy and get rewarded? Or did he want to be a bad boy and get punished?
Tony watched as Steve began to shift slightly on the mattress. It quickly graduated into squirming then desperate writhing as the lube warmed and began to work, creating a constant itching sensation. Steve gasped, grinding his hips back against the plug, trying to work it inside his passage, soothe the maddening itch, whimpering as the friction only made it worse. Tony didn’t interfere, allowing Steve to increase his own agony before the official punishment even began. “T-Tony! Oh God… It’s… It’s…”
"Well, I hope it was worth it. When I got home, I was going to unlock you and fuck you through the mattress. Now, I'll just have to come up with a punishment for that hungry little hole of yours instead. Something creative, I think. Otherwise you just won't learn your lesson. Isn't that right, Steve?"
Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve been able to update. Hope this chapter was worth the wait! Let me know what you think in the comments!
"Coffee?"
"Like that do we? My baby gets off on it when it hurts a little bit, doesn't he?"
"Well my sadist of a boyfriend had spent the entire day teasing me! Tell me the truth, Tony. If I hadn't done that, would you have really unlocked me and let me come tonight?"
Steve crossed the room to kiss him softly before answering. “I finally met Buck’s fella. A guy named Remy?”
Reaching into the nightstand, Tony retrieved a bottle of lube, coating his fingers, rubbing them against Steve's entrance. First one finger, then another, gently stretching and preparing his lover, before drawing back to slick his cock.
Steve spent the majority of the next day debriefing with Fury and writing up reports on the latest battle. He spent several hours of that time being asked questions about the mystic that had appeared long enough to help them before disappearing. Especially obnoxious as he had no clue who it was, but he refused to throw Bruce under the bus. Besides, the sheer amount of frustration would most likely lead to a code green, and no one needed that today. By the time he returned to the tower he was frustrated and unsettled in a way he couldn't quite figure out.
Curiosity was replaced with a pleased grin, evil enough to make Steve shudder again. “You do know me. Because you’re not wrong. I have a spank bank full of hundreds of evil and depraved and kinky things I want to do to you. That I want to torture you with. And I will. And Steve? You’re going to love it.”
Bare skin pressed against his back. Steve hadn’t heard Tony strip, had lost a few moments in his confused state. The head of Tony’s cock pressed against his hole, burning hot like a brand, and steadily pressing into him. Teeth sank back into Steve’s neck, tearing open the bonding bite from earlier, causing his hips to arch back, pressing Tony deeper into his sensitive passage. It was overwhelming, intense, like nothing he had felt from his own attempts.
“You built all of the sex toy tech, didn’t you?”
Steve trembled under the gentle soothing touches. “But I don’t want it… I hate it, Tony. Please?”
“I-I only had permission to come if I was hard. I’m sorry, Tony! I’m sorry! I tried! I tried so hard! I want to be good for you. I do.”
The urge to slam his head against the table came back.
“I… I can’t. I can’t!”
Tony leaned back, watching Steve’s body shudder through several orgasms, becoming increasingly sensitive after each one, the desperate need driving him never slowing. Days. He was going to keep him like this for days. “I think you’re ready for us to get to work.”
“No honey. I’ll take care of that later. For right now, all you have to do is feel. Can you do that for me?”
Tony leaned back against the bench, gesturing to the open room, before crossing his arms across his chest. “Go ahead, sweetheart. What are you waiting for, an invitation?”
He bared his teeth, growling. “Fuck off! I don’t want you! I don’t want this!”
Tony sighed. “I know you don’t like it. But I’m doing it for your own good. I’m trying, Steve. In case you hadn’t noticed, I haven’t done this before either. I don’t have a harem of omegas running around up here. I’m new at this. Maybe I moved too fast, but I wanted you to be fixed. Healthy.” There was a note of sadness in the alpha’s voice. It made Steve want to comfort him. He ruthlessly crushed the impulse, staying stiff and still in his lap.
“Institute full lock down procedures for my omega. Steve does not have access to anything beyond the penthouse unless I am escorting him. And no one other than myself has access up here when he’s alone.”
“What happened?”
"Oh, you'll thank me well enough later tonight. Be waiting in the penthouse at nine o'clock. After all, you did say anything..."
They went back to the hotel after they had eaten, spent time curled up on the couch discussing everything from the merits of artistic movements to how well the Avengers would fare against the antagonists from different horror movies before ordering up dinner.
“Okay, enough. Natasha, make sure everyone gets taken care of. Steve? We’re going upstairs right now. And don’t you even think about arguing with me.”
"Yes Captain."
"Stop." Tony's breaths were coming a little faster, obviously just as affected by the scene. "Remote. First setting. Turn it on."
Thank you everybody who commented on this story! I really appreciate it. And don’t worry, I might have wrapped this one up, but I have a lot more ideas to play with!
“Thanks.” He paused then, studying him more closely. Finally noticing the bruises, barely visible above the waistband of the jeans, the hint of a bite mark on his neck, hiding behind the long hair. “You! You’re who Bucky keeps sneaking out on dates with, and won’t tell me anything about! He’s been driving me crazy!”
“Thank you.”
Training has been incredibly boring with plenty of downtime, so it looks like I’m still on a role. Let me know what you think and if you have any requests for especially dark kinks for evil Tony. Enjoy!
Steve went limp against the desk, feeling wrung out and overwhelmed. He felt Tony's arms slide around him, gently untying the knot around his wrists and stroking the skin the silk had reddened. He gently tucked Steve back into his pants, fastened them, and sat down in the chair, pulling Steve into his lap. Tony's fingers gently carded through his hair, stroked over his back, gentle soothing touches.
“I’m not a fucking invalid!”
“Yes, Tony.”
The afternoon passed in a similar fashion, Steve lost to a haze of desire and agony. Before the end of the movie, Tony bent him over the arm of the couch and took his pleasure, leaving Steve bereft. After lunch, it was a knotting over the table. A few hours after that found them back in the bedroom. This time after Tony came, Steve broke down completely, sobbing like his heart was breaking.
“Please what, Steve? What is it?”
Steve hid his face in the side of his neck, listening to the low rumble of his laugh. "Good thing."
“Yes Tony.”
"He said the same thing. I find myself confused."
"Yes, but Tony it's too much. You don't have to constantly buy me things-"
“I do. A real family. I… Never had that.”
He shushed him, kissing his cheek, holding him close. "It's okay. That was your punishment, baby. It's all over. You didn't think you'd really get to come after you tried to sneak behind my back and take it, did you?" Steve just shook in his arms, devastated, desperately trying to process the sensations.
Hello lovely people! Sorry this one took me so long. I let me Dom decide on Steve’s fate, and it took a few days. Also, I feel like I should apologize for the extra kinky kink in this chapter. I feel like a dirty dirty perv.
“I… I made a nest out of all the things you left for me. And it was really nice. I don’t think I’ve ever had anything like that before. But then I started thinking about what would happen when… When…” Steve stifled a sob, curling back further into Tony’s grip.
"Watch it, Cap doesn't like that kind of talk." Natasha took down another slime golem, getting a mouth full for her efforts. "You know what, Stark? You might have the right idea. These things just keep coming!"
*           *           *
“Yes, Sir.”
"Tony..." Steve blinked, barely able to keep his eyes open.
Steve rolled over, spreading his legs to allow Tony to settle between them. He was rewarded with strong fingers pressing into the base of the plug, driving it forward to nudge his prostate. Slowly letting the sensations build until Steve was moaning and writhing beneath him before stopping. His fingers slid up, running over the smooth metal of the cage, curving around it and stroking over the surface. The image of Tony stroking the cage he built just for him, had Steve begging again. “God, Tony! Tony, please!”
"Good. I don't want to hurt you or push you too far. If we start to get there, you let me know. Alright?"
“Yes! Yes! Alpha, yes!”
Steve only sighed, letting his eye close, basking in the warmth and affection.
He moaned, forcing himself to draw in long deep breaths, to still the movement of his hips. Slowly he began to calm, the frustration from before fading away beneath the contentment that came from being in Tony's care. From being owned by him.
"Very well, Captain."
“Good. I’ve been working for hours. Now it’s time for a little fun. Up.” Steve slipped up onto the couch beside him and was immediately pressed onto his back with Tony looming over him. “Would you like to play a game, Steve?”
“You are most welcome, my sweet omega.”
"Now, I know we hadn't agreed on it before, so be honest. Do you want me to punish you for trying to come without my permission earlier?"
Steve shrugged. “It’s just another of the things you do to me. The ones I get no say in. I’m starting to get used to it.”
Steve immediately scrambled to obey, legs spread as wide as possible, ass up high in the air. Tony organized his supplies on the bed behind him, then picked up the plug he had designed for the purpose. He secured the tubing in place before lubing up the surface, and sliding it easily into Steve. Holding it in place, Tony accessed the programming and began to expand the toy. As it grew, Steve began to shift restlessly, groaning when the stretch became intense. Tony was careful, not wanting to tear him, but curious to see how much more the super soldier could take.
Tony settled by his side, releasing his own cock. He began stroking over it slowly as he watched Steve struggle and sob. The gleam of pleasure was bright in his dark eyes. Tony was enjoying both his own touch and Steve’s torment. He came with a low groan, painting Steve’s chest and stomach with his come. After he was done, he wiped himself off, tucking his spent cock back in his pants. Tony gracefully rose to his feet.
“He put his arms around me. Held me. Told me everything was gonna be alright. He carried me into the kitchen, sat me on the counter while he worked. Made me hot chocolate from scratch, with whipped cream and sprinkles all over it. Blue ones. Said he bought them because they reminded him of my eyes. We curled up under blankets on the couch. And he kept telling me over and over again that it was gonna be alright. And… I finally believed him. I was sitting there, warm and safe for the first time I could remember, and just though, yeah, I wanna keep this. Made it easier to stop fighting so hard. And when I stopped, things got better.”
As though conjured by his thoughts, Steve saw one of the handlers walking down the hallways with an alpha. The man was well dressed, face framed by dark hair and a sculpted goatee. He was obviously well off. Probably wouldn’t spare an unruly omega like Steve a second glance. He could see them talking, but couldn’t hear a word through the insulated glass. The alpha stopped when he got near Steve’s cell, eyes locked on his body.
“Anything! Anything, please!”
"I don't know, but I'm not complaining. Bruce? Call SHIELD. Tell them to send a cleanup crew. We are not taking this one."
Sorry about the wait everyone! I wanted to get this chapter just right, since it sets the tone for everything else to follow. I hope you enjoy it, and plan to have a nice smutty chapter up soon. For now, enjoy soft boys being soft.
"No Tony."
It had been three days since Bucky had come to stay in the tower with them, and Steve could see the strain it was putting on his alpha. He went to find Tony down in his workshop, stepping in behind him and wrapping his arms around the older man’s waist, burying his face in the back of his neck. Tony stayed stiff and still for a long moment before letting out a slow exhale and relaxing back into Steve’s body. Steve closed his eyes, breathing in the scent of his mate. This amazing man who wanted him and would do anything to please him, no matter how uncomfortable it made him. “I’m sorry, alpha.”
A thick metal plug pressed against his hole and was slowly forced inside. Steve whimpered, first at the stretch and then at the weight pressing at his rim, muscles clenching around it over and over. Tony grasped the base and carelessly twisted it, rocking it barely in and out before forcing it deep, grinding it inside of him.
"Of course, sweetheart." Tony fiddled with the bracelet for a moment before he set the tool aside. Steve ran his fingertips over the unbroken length of the chain. It was perfect.
Tony ran a gentle hand through his hair, stroking it back from his face. “We’ll consider that your punishment for all the times you tried to remove the plug. Because you’ll be feeling this for days. It’s going to be intense, but I promise I will be as gentle as possible. Because despite everything, you are my sweet omega, and I will always take care of you.”
“Yes. God, yes. So much. Thank you, Tony.”
Hello lovelies! I know it’s been a while since I posted anything. This year has been hell on my motivation. However currently, I have a shiny new job that entails a large amount of downtime. And as long as I’m physically present, they don’t care what I do!
Steve nodded against the leather. He rocked forward, testing the restraints. As with everything else Tony had made for him, he stayed exactly where the other man wanted him.
It didn’t take long for Steve to figure out what the purpose of the injection was. Arousal burned in his veins, the cage twitching in small movements as his cock struggled in vein to harden. The need was so intense Steve wanted to scream. Instead be begged in vain for release. Tony watched him with pleasure, a small smile curling the edges of his lips, as Steve gave into the urge to pry the metal free. Tony laughed as he struggled, pawing at the cage trying to find anything to grasp or pull with no success. It was seamless and smooth. As the unrelenting desire grew, Steve attempted to stroke himself through it in the hopes of even a hint of sensation penetrating the confines. Nothing. There was no relief. No mercy for him here.
Steve felt like someone had punched him in the chest. "What?"
“I do, sweetheart. You have no idea how much I want you. The things I want to do to you. I can’t fucking wait. I’m going to ruin you for anyone else. You’re mine.”
Tony arched a brow. “And…?”
Just when Steve thought he might be close enough to come from the throbbing in his ass alone, Tony stopped. He settled against the bed, clearly in Steve’s line of sight, unfastening his pants and freeing his cock. He was almost close enough for Steve to touch, but not quite.
Just to let everyone know, I've posted the first chapter of a story starring a will be kinky in the future Bruce
“An hour or so? Maybe.”
James’ grey-blue eyes sparkled with mischief. “Absolutely.”
“So is it just…”
"Spread your legs for me, sweetheart." Tony's hands stroked over his thighs, soothing him as he spread them further apart. He could only imagine how he looked, spread out on the older man's bed, writhing and clutching at the sheets by his head. "That's a good boy."
Eventually he got up to shower and fix something to eat, carefully examining his thoughts. He felt good. Better than he had for days. Why? What changed? He finished breakfast and settled in to finish the reports for the team's last mission. If his younger self had realized how much paperwork was required to be a hero, he might never have agreed to Erskine. However, sometimes a distraction allowed him to see the answers to a problem more clearly. Might help.
“And what do you know about love, huh?”
“Good.” He nodded, sliding the chair back from the desk so Steve could perch on his lap.
James seemed to consider the request for a moment, but the hint of a smirk at the corner of his lips gave Tony the answer before he spoke. “No, doll. You just settle down and rest. I think you’ve had enough excitement for the day.” After he finished, he wrapped the metal arm around Steve’s waist, holding him too tightly for him to move.
Tony turned his gaze to the wall, couldn’t look at Steve’s face if he wanted to get the words out. “I was raped, repeatedly, for a month solid. When the time was up, she let me go. Laughed in my face. Told me that I could either give her Stark Industries plans and prototypes, or she’d dump the video footage online. I refused, so she released everything. Nice editing skills. Made the entire world think I was a depraved needy slut. I was… Afraid. To be alone with her after that. So I broke it off with her publicly. Which became yet another story about me being the bad guy. Poor Sunset. I broke her heart. The only reason they stopped mocking me at every available opportunity, was because I got cancer. Can’t make fun of a guy with cancer. It’s in poor taste. But once that was no longer an issue… They went right back to the status quo. Which is what you saw. I’m sorry Steve.”
"I'll handle the rest of the team. One on one is probably best. I'm glad Thor is still off planet. Makes it easier."
"There's a fundraiser at the Met this weekend for the Maria Stark Foundation. It'll be showcasing the work of a lot of modern artists, some from my- well, Pepper's, private collection."
"Language."
“On?”
Tony stroked, squeezed, and explored to his hearts content. Until the flesh was tender and bruised. He moved on to Steve’s nipples, sucking and teasing until they were hard and swollen, every touch causing him to thrash on the bench. Still he stayed in place, held open and displayed for Tony’s enjoyment.
“I-It hurts…”
Since the last chapter was sweet and tender fluff, have more kinky porn! Because life sucks on so many levels right now, I feel like everyone deserves lost of fluffy feels and kinky sex. Enjoy! As always, all mistakes are mine. Let me know what you think, and any kink requests you would like to see. I may not use all of them, but I promise to consider everything. Comments feed my praise kink and speed up future posts.
The man standing next to him was soft. Fragile. And well on the way to being completely broken. Something that always inclined Tony to be more sympathetic. And it wasn’t as if he didn’t know what it felt like to be cast out by the Avengers. To be unworthy and unwanted. He watched him from the corner of his eye, taking in the dark circles from lack of sleep. The way his arms stayed wrapped around himself with his shoulders hunched as though he were expecting the next blow to come at any time. It stirred something inside of him. The desire to care and protect.
“Hey sweetheart. Back with me?”
Tony cut him off. “No. I don’t. I want to. Now, do as you’re told, sweetheart. Remember: I can and will punish you. And I don’t have to hurt you to do it.”
Once his knot had gone down and they’d recovered enough for Tony to guide them to the raggedy couch in the corner of his lab, Steve tucked securely in his lap, he nuzzled his throat and asked again. “Did everything go alright at your appointment today, sweetheart?”
Steve felt slick fingers probing at his hole, rubbing against the tense muscles there, and nearly sobbed in relief. Finally. Tony was going to take care of him, and this need driving him to insanity would finally go away. He was just as careful as he had been the night before, slicking his hole and stretching it slowly before his fingers slid away. "This still what you want, baby?"
Steve blushed. "Yeah, Tony. I can do that." He slid off the cushion and began to crawl down the hallway, careful to make his movements as graceful as possible. When they reached the bedroom, he crawled to the foot of the bed and sat back on his knees.
Tony released him from the restraints, gently guiding him to sit on the bed. Every movement made the cage between his thighs shift and his sore entrance burn. At the other man’s urging, Steve leaned into his side, feeling weak and broken down in an entirely new way. Tony began to gently stroke his hair again, and Steve pressed closer, desperate for even the smallest scrap of affection. “See sweetheart? I don’t have to hurt you to punish you. I can just leave you like this.”
Tony's voice was a low growl against his ear. "Please what, sweetheart?"
Tony led Steve to the door of his dungeon, immediately bringing his thoughts back to his last punishment session. "Tony..."
Sorry this one is so short, it’s mostly setup for what’s coming next. Hope you enjoy a little bit of smutty fluff with our favorite boys!
Tony arched a brow. “Sir is it? It seems I’ve gotten an upgrade. I like it. Thank you, sweetheart. Now, brace yourself. This is going to hurt.”
"Oh honey, you belong to me. I can do anything I want."
Steve groaned, arms tightening around Tony.
"Thank you, Tony." It was ridiculous, but somehow Tony completely understood. Logically he knew the other man had just been gone on a two-week business trip. However, after losing so many people that he loved to time and war, a part of Steve was always convinced that this was too good to be true. That he'd wake up one morning and it would all be gone. Focusing on the moment, Steve picked up the soap and lathered up his hands. He took his time, carefully washing every inch of Tony's body. Worshiping it in his own way. He loved the texture of his skin, the feel of the muscles under his hands. By the time Steve was done, he was starting to feel relaxed and a little floaty himself.
"I won't forget, Tony."
The familiar British voice sounded from the cell phone on the nightstand. "Yes Sir?"
"Okay, Tony."
A few days after Tony’s promised punishment, Steve woke to soft tickling touches running over his body. He tried to turn away and was stopped with a metallic clank. His eyes flew open. Tony’s mischievous grin greeted him. “Good morning, sweetheart. Sleep well?”
Tony smiled. "You're right. I think you just got very, very lucky, Steve." He slipped the chain from around his neck, walking over to his side. Kneeling down, he carefully unlocked the cage, setting in on the ground beside him. As soon as his cock was free, he swallowed him down completely, the plug jumping to its highest level. Steve screamed, coming almost immediately. Tony kept working him, through the oversensitivity, and through release after release, until everything was overwhelming pleasure and the world went dark.
"You just choose not to?"
Steve let his gaze drop. All he knew how to do was fight. He didn’t know who he was without it. “I… Yes alpha…” The words came haltingly. They were a struggle for Steve to say. He didn’t want this. Had been raised to not want this. To be better than his biology. But he was sore, hungry, and tired. He needed a break. To regroup for later.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony led Steve back into the elevator, thoughts racing a mile a minute. It was shocking to have the other man obediently follow him without making any snide comments. Even more so that having him at Tony’s back didn’t make his skin crawl. This Steve was just too different from the one he knew to trigger the same responses once he realized what he was seeing.
He reached their floor, staggering to the couch, collapsing on its surface. Immediately the vibrations stopped. Steve rolled onto his stomach, buried his face into a pillow and screamed his frustration. It was going to be a long seven hours.
"Side effect of extremis, sweetheart. I can communicate with electronics. And as soon as I figured out that little feature... I built you some new toys to play with."
"Loki is troubled, yes. But I do not believe that was the way to handle the situation. Odin wanted him gone, and there was no convincing him otherwise. Why is this a concern?"
“I know.” Tony pulled him closer, rubbing his back soothingly before returning to the kisses from before. Steve felt like he was slowly being led down a dark and unfamiliar road. But the kisses were addictive, he couldn’t get enough, as was the feel of Tony’s hands running over his bare skin. He pressed closer, willing to offer up anything his alpha wanted.
“Yeah, you like that, don’t you? Do you need it, Steve?”
“You’re welcome, little omega.”
Tony slowly drew out of his body. "Clench up. You lose any, I'll have to punish you again. And I don't think you could handle that right now. Do you?"
Hot breaths panted against his ear as Tony chased his own orgasm, burying himself deep and spilling inside Steve’s body. Groaning as the continuous clenching drew out the pleasure. “How long could I keep you like this Steve? Hours? Days? Would you pass out before your body gave in? Would you let me? Huh? Would you let me do this whenever the fuck I want?”
Steve swallowed hungrily around the cock in his throat, grinding back as much as he could in the restraints holding him, trying to get the thick vibrator buried deeper inside of him. He was insatiable, skin burning with need, the constant vibrations against his omega gland driving him insane. The only place on his body devoid of any sensation was his cock. It was numbed so completely he couldn’t feel so much as a trace of the strong vibrations thrumming through his ass.
And this version of Steve was beautiful. There was no other word to describe it. He surrendered himself so easily to Stark’s desires. Giving in and embracing it. Finding pleasure in whatever was being done to him in the moment. He’d watched from the shadows in the hall one night as Steve was pulled back into Stark’s arms, hands coming around to palm at his chest, pinching and pulling at Steve’s nipples until he’d come with a cry from that alone. Bucky had heard the whispered words that made no sense to him as he fled back to the safety of his own room. “Thirty nine to beat, sweetheart…”
Steve shifted forward, spreading Tony's thighs with his shoulders, gently sliding his lips around his cock. He worked him gently, coaxing him to hardness and slowly teasing him awake, eyes trained on his face. As soon as Tony's eyelashes began to flutter, Steve increased his efforts, quickly losing himself in the taste and feel of the man beneath him.
Movement out of the corner of his eye caught his attention. Tony slid a hand around the back of his neck, thumb pressed to a slight indent in the metal. “You ready sweetheart?” Steve nodded and Tony pressed his thumb down firmly, held it in place until a blue light glowed from underneath.
“So, my boy has manners after all. What do you think of pancakes…?” Tony took his time, alternating feeding Steve and himself. He made sure that the omega received small manageable bites, with plenty of time to chew and swallow. He also kept a running commentary going the entire time, about food and the things he liked, the things he thought Steve might enjoy. He wanted to get him used to the sound of Tony’s voice, as well as allowing plenty of time for the medication to start working.
"Yes Tony." Steve could feel his body tremble. He couldn't remember the last time he felt so helpless, so out of control.
Tony tilted his chin up, studying Steve’s face, an unreadable expression in his eyes. “And that’s really what you want? To suffer for me until you feel absolved of your sins?”
“If I see Ty.”
James turned dark bedroom eyes up to his. “That’s right, Stevie. What’s the matter, can’t handle what we’re dishin’ out?”
"I try."
“Well, yesterday I was horrifically mean to you, so I thought today, I could be nice.”
Tony straddled his lap, hips pressing down against him to feel the cool metal against his body. He dropped a soft kiss against Steve’s slack lips. “I told you, sweetheart. I will always give you exactly what you need.”
"You did. But that's things I would have been happy to give you any day. Isn't there anything you want that might be special? Maybe a little selfish?"
A pleased growl rumbled in Tony’s chest. Steve wasn’t even trying to fight him, instead submitting easily to his alpha’s will. “And if I told you I want to keep you like this for the next week?” Tony let a hint of alpha voice slip into his tone, watching as Steve shuddered helplessly against the bed. Tony pressed him back, propping himself on one arm, so he had an unimpeded view of the gorgeous omega beneath him. “You were so fucking good for me, you know that Steve? Falling apart and begging for my cock. Crying on my knot over and over again. And I bet you still want more, don’t you baby?” Steve’s shuddering increased, his hips rocking back against the bed, trying to force the thick plug deeper. Tony growled again in pleasure, wanting to reward the responsiveness. “That’s right, sweetheart. Try to fuck yourself, see if it helps. I know that plug isn’t going anywhere unless I take it out. Everything I use on you, everything you’re wearing is keyed to me. And if I want to flip you over and pound your sweet ass right now, or leave you desperate and begging for a week, you’ll let me. Because you’re mine.”
"Yeah, Tony. Thank you." He shook his head. "That was mean."
With nothing else to distract him, Steve became aware of the ache within his core. He shifted back against Tony, trying to elicit a reaction. He needed his alpha’s cock buried deep inside of him, scratching the maddening itch that wouldn’t go away. When that didn’t work, he shifted around on the bed until he could grind his hips into the mattress, rubbing his cock against the soft sheets. It was hard to get enough friction given his bound position, but eventually he pulsed against the material, closing his eyes in relief.
"Oh, you can. And you will." He tugged Steve to his feet, putting him into tight leather shorts that laced up the sides and a leather harness that framed his clamped nipples. Matching restraints were fastened around his wrists and ankles. The final touch was a thick leather collar around his throat that he could feel pressed against his skin every time he swallowed. All of it in deep red and gold. Iron Man's colors.
Steve breathed a sigh of relief as he stripped off his uniform and stepped into the steaming shower. It hadn’t been a long mission, that was something to be grateful for. But the missions he was sent on for SHEILD were increasing. In difficulty, length, as well as frequency. It almost felt like they were hoping for him to just… Not make it back. Which did not bear close examination right now. Then again, he felt the same about several things in his life.
Sunset Bane was dressed in a sparkling designer gown, holding court at the far edge of the dance floor. Steve slowly made his way over, stopping to scoop up a champagne bucket filled with mostly melted ice. As soon as she turned to face him, he unceremoniously dumped the contents over her head. Ruining hair, dress, and makeup all at the same time. The unearthly shriek she let out was so piercing that all noise in the room stopped, everyone’s full attention on the scene she was making.
He looked up, meeting his eyes. "I want you in my mouth. And... I don't want to come tonight. I want this to be about you."
Steve blinked up at him. "Tony..." His throat felt raw, his voice came out hoarse. "Tony..."
"Loki? Honey? It's going to be okay."
Since my story was rudely interrupted by real plot last time, have a wonderfully kinky chapter this time! I hope you enjoy the latest installment. Comments and suggestions are always appreciated, and if I've made any errors, please let me know. Now, onto the sexy boys!
"Good boy." Steve's thighs were spread wide before familiar shackles closed around his ankles and above his knees. His arms were folded behind his back, each wrist fastened to the opposite elbow, before he was bent forward over the edge of the bed. A collar was buckled around his neck, and when he tried to sit up he discovered that he was held firmly in place.
“Yeah… That’s… Definitely one way to look at it.”
"Promise?"
In any case, I hope everyone enjoys this chapter and is looking forward to the next. Comments, suggestions, and constructive criticism are always welcome.
"That's right sweetheart. Show me what you want. Fuck that perfect ass for me."
"I've tried, Tony."
“Th-thank you, Sir…”
The pleasure was so intense Steve was nearly sobbing below him. He could feel his legs shaking uncontrollably as Tony's movements became faster. Too much. Too much. He had to come now. He had to. His cock was throbbing agonizingly in the cage. It felt so much tighter than it had when Tony had put it on him last night, like it had somehow shrunk in the night. He could feel dribbles of precum leaking out of the tip of his cock, running down the outside of the cage. "Tony. Please. I'm so close. Take- take it off. Please."
“Yes Tony.”
“I… Umm… You- You kicked me out of the tower this morning, and… I rode the subway for a while so I could think. By the time I got off it was night, and I was starving. I got something to eat, and sat down in a doorway, but then the door disappeared and I was inside with this weird guy named Strange who kept saying all of these things that didn’t make sense about preserving multiple timelines? And then he was making glowing shapes in the air and they came rushing at me and I felt sick. When I opened my eyes I was here. I’m sorry, Stark. I really don’t mean to cause you so much trouble.”
"Please what?"
It didn't take long for Steve to fall over the edge again, Tony following him a few thrusts later. He collapsed against the bed, gasping in ragged breaths. Tony slid from his body, dropping down beside him and gathering him into his arms. He didn't say anything, letting Steve drift, soothed by the steady rhythm of Tony's heartbeat beneath his ear.
"Yes, Tony..."
Tony laughed softly before sliding his cock into Steve’s mouth, down his throat. One hand threaded into the hair at the back of his head, tightening ruthlessly. The other kept his head tilted up, giving Steve no choice but to watch him take his pleasure. He started with a quick pace, plunging down Steve’s throat, gagging him and occasionally holding him there, cock cutting off his air until Tony chose to allow him more.
"Th-thank you, Tony."
Hello lovely people! Thank you so much for all of the comments and encouragement on the previous chapters of this story. It is deeply appreciated, and definitely encourages quick turnaround on new chapters.
Steve went to the New York Sanctum to talk to Strange. It took some time to explain what he was looking for. Even more to convince Strange it was what he really wanted. A one way trip. No exit strategy. He eventually had to agree to let the sorcerer sift through the broken pieces of his mind. That was enough to do the trick. After some time spent sifting through the mulitverse, he found exactly what Steve needed.
"Good boy." He let the chain fall from his fingers carelessly, and slid away from Steve's body again, leaving him lying on the bed desperately trying to catch his breath. He could hear several things being moved on the nightstand but couldn't tell what any of them could be. The anticipation only made it more intense.
“Morning sweetheart. How did you sleep?” Tony reached up and brushed Steve’s hair back from his face, the touch proprietary, as though he had the right to touch Steve where and when he chose.
Images of Steve bound to the bed with red rope flashed before his eyes. He wanted that, but maybe not this time, when he was already so overwhelmed. “I can stay.”
"I said no. And because you're being such a disobedient boy today, I think you need to be punished. I think you want to be punished."
Steve obediently turned around at Tony's gesture, allowing him to admire his work. "Perfect." He left him standing there as he dressed. Tight leather pants with cutouts down each side, heavy boots with a sole thick enough to put them on eye level, and a black leather vest that covered the arc reactor. Once he was ready, he picked up a leash that was clipped to the front of the collar and began walking to the elevator.
“Tony…”
“Morning sweetheart.” Tony’s voice was still rough with sleep. “I’ll never get enough of this, you know. You, here with me. Thank you, Steve. For choosing me.”
"You- You can't do that..."
"I might indeed. I was simply grateful that he... Treated me so well."
Bucky was going to lose his mind. Everywhere he went in the tower, Stark and this version of Stevie were fucking. By the end of the first week he’d already seen Steve bent over a workbench in the lab, strapped to some sort of contraption in the penthouse, pushed back on the kitchen counter, and being fucked into the carpet. He had an almost begrudging respect for Stark’s stamina. The man was a machine.
Tony reached down, gripping the base of his cock tightly, soft whimpers and cries spilling from Steve's lips as his cock slowly softened under the painful pressure. He shuddered against the older man's body, pushing weakly against his chest. A firm grip on his shoulder kept him pinned against the bed. "That's it. Just let it happen. Good boy."
"Supposed... to be about you..."
The heavy weight of a blanket settled over his back, pinning him beneath it. He felt too weak to even try to move. "Thank you, Tony..."
“Alright. Let me just get this demanding little cocklet tucked away. Then you get my cock. And my knot. Okay baby?” Steve nodded, mind too foggy with desire to understand what Tony was saying until his eyes began to glow a bright electric blue. The cage around Steve’s cock began to clamp down around him viciously, the increasing pressure forcing him to release again and again. The metal continued to tighten, forcing his soft cock smaller, taking advantage of both the elasticity and sensitivity brought on by his heat. Even when the cage stopped, locking in place once more, Steve couldn’t still his frantic movements. A glance down showed that he was now as dainty as any omega was supposed to be. He hated the fact that it was now a source of pleasure for his stupid body, the crush of metal overwhelming after so long without a single touch.
Steve barely felt the needle slip into the base, only the cooling sensation that spread through the area from the injection. He let out a sigh of relief as he immediately began to soften. Tony pressed a kiss against his forehead, stroking his hair as they waited for the medication to take full effect.
"I love you too, Tony."
Bucky lowered a trembling hand between his thighs, let it run over the smooth expanse of the metal. The head of his cock was entirely shielded from touch, only a small hole to allow the release of fluids. There was only the faintest hint of sensation through the small slits along his shaft. His entire cock was held securely, forced to remain soft and small, balls tucked back out of the way, held tight and close to his body by the metal surrounding them. Nothing could touch him, not even himself. He was safe. The thought made him burst into tears.
Life was uncertain, theirs more than anyone's. Knowing that this man, who had been hurt so many times, was strong enough to be this honest with him, was the greatest gift Steve had ever been given. He wasn't falling for Tony Stark, he was already there. Maybe had been for a while, without realizing it. All the time they had spent together. The different ways Tony had been there, not only helping him navigate the future but finding a place there for himself. And now there was nowhere else he could imagine being.
Hard fingers gripped his chin, tilting his face up. "So you think I should reward this kind of behavior? Give in to my bad boy, just because he wants something? You could have asked. But you didn't. You tried to take it. And you know what that means, don't you?"
Eventually the cramping eased, turning into an inescapable feeling of pressure, overwhelming in it’s intensity. Steve continued to cry, hating what was being done to him with every fiber of his being. Dimly he became aware of his arousal, the vibrations slowly heightening it. He shook his head frantically, remembering Tony’s earlier words, knowing he would carry through on his promise, no matter how much Steve begged him to stop. His entrance clenched around the metal holding it open, Steve’s body tightening then releasing in a rush, slick dripping unchecked over the backs of his legs. He groaned, cervix still spasming painfully around the plug.
Steve nodded, eyes wild and desperate. “Yes! I’ll be good. I promise. So good. Please…?”
“Five weeks and you never touched that pretty little cock even once?”
“For what, sweetness?”
And another one down! I might not have been writing quite as much lately, but I still have plenty of ideas. I hope you like the ending. Thanks to
"Yes. More than anything. Yes. Please!"
When Tony finally left his side to go digging through the drawer he kept filled with assorted restaurant menus, Steve watched him with a soft smile on his face. Even though the morning hadn't gone the way he'd wanted it to, somehow it had still turned out to be a good day. And the reason for that was Tony.
“I know.”
“Good boy.” Tony gripped the tube, holding Steve’s gaze as he began to tighten the crank once more, increasing the pressure until Steve was arching his hips forward desperately, trying to find a way to lessen the pressure, overwhelmed by the combination or pain and pleasure it was causing.
He didn’t notice the car stopping until Tony’s hand was on his arm, leading him into the elevator. As soon as the doors closed, Steve was pinned back against the wall, arms tight around him. He hid his face in the genius’ neck, allowing himself the moment of weakness. To accept some of the comfort he had been aching for.
“Is that alright? I don’t know what your plans for today are…”
"Good. What's your word, Steve?"
Taking his own pillow instead, he slid off the bed, ignoring JARVIS’ inquiries to curl up in the corner of the room, face buried to muffle the sound of his tears. He replayed every moment they had spent together, remembering every gentle touch and kind word. The way it had felt to be held securely in his alpha’s arms at night. What it had been like to wake up to Tony’s smile in the morning. Eventually exhaustion overcame him and he fell into a fitful sleep.
When Thor landed on the roof of the tower, he was surprised at the unfriendly demeanor of the team waiting for him. The Avengers were dressed for battle, armed and ready.
Steve swallowed. "A little. I guess I'm not used to seeing you like this."
Steve’s protests were ignored, as they always would be. As soon as the cock slipped free of his passage, it was replaced with hard, unyielding metal. The plug was thick, settling inside of him and keeping him stretched wide. Trapping the alpha’s come inside of him, still burning, stoking an unfamiliar need. His hole spasmed around it, wouldn’t stop. He was no longer in control of his own body. It belonged to the alpha he’d been sold off to.
“Stop it! Stop threatening me, and calling me pretty names, and acting like you’re going to give a damn for longer than it takes you to fucking break me! Just stop it!” Steve could feel the flush spreading over his skin,  his breath coming in harsh pants.
"I did."
Steve smiled as he pocketed his phone and headed up to the penthouse.
He woke up to the feeling of a wet hot mouth wrapped around his nipple through the thin t-shirt. A vicious pinch to the other nipple followed, pulling a moan from Steve’s throat. He blinked his eyes open to find Tony straddling his lap, keeping him pressed flat against the couch as he worked his chest. Once he knew Steve was awake, he sat up to gaze down at him, callused fingers never stopping their work pinching and twisting at his nipples or kneading his pecs. “Fuck Steve. Just look at you. So goddamned pretty I could lose my mind. I saw you lying here, all sweet and innocent looking, and I just wanted to fucking wreck you.”
"Alright..." He heard the other man stand up and move away, followed by faint sounds from the kitchen. It seemed like no time had passed before he was back, fingers gentle on his face, urging him to take bits of food from his fingers. Steve slowly ate what he was given, tongue darting out to lap at Tony's fingers, reveling in the care and attention being lavished on him.
"I don't think he's up for a large crowd, but I'm sure we could come up with something private."
Finally Tony released his cock, wrapping his arms around his waist and holding him close, murmuring soothing words of comfort against his hair. “It’s okay, sweetheart. I’ve got you. Your alpha’s got you.”
"Tony... Tony, please..."
The toy sprang to life again, strong vibrations tearing through him, leaving him a needy wreck, tears sliding down his cheeks. Just like before, as soon as he drew close to release the vibrations stopped. He was allowed enough time to relax, when the toy began moving again. This time the ridges along the length of the dildo seemed to pulse and writhe within him. It was a new and unexpected sensation that devastated him completely, one of the most intense feelings he had ever experienced. Cries fell from his lips, his body straining against the restraints, he was so close. All it would take was a little more…
Steve gets an opportunity to research a variety or topics on the internet. This lead to mentions of omega abuse, such as bodily mutilation, and the repercussions of suppression use. He realizes that the society wasn’t imprisoning most of the children he grew up with, the suppressants they were put on caused their deaths.
"My name. It's Steve. I figure you've seen me nearly naked and orgasming chained to a wall in a kink club, we should be on a first name basis."
Tony paused, maintaining his hold on Steve, to glance over his shoulder at James. “What do you think, honey? Has he had enough, or can he finish this way?” He ignored the wail his words drew from Steve, waiting instead for James’ choice. Another reminder that he did have choice now. For himself and others. Tony hoped that if he drove the lesson home when the man was lost to pleasure, maybe it would remain lodged in his subconscious for the future.
Tony laughed again, and it was a dark sinful sound. "Starting to get it, aren't you, sweetheart?"
Steve gripped the cage, desperately trying to bend the metal, pull it apart, anything to escape for even a few minutes. He could feel the surface shifting under his fingertips, moving until the metal was wrapped securely around him, not allowing any freedom for him to pry it off. Tears slipped down his cheeks as he felt Tony’s firm grip on the back on his neck. “Tony… Please, no more. I can’t…”
Steve nodded, tears clinging to his lashes, blurring the room as Tony slipped out of it. A nurse came in within minutes to remove the IV and return his clothes. He dressed slowly, feeling uncertain and overwhelmed. He didn’t know what was supposed to happen next, could only hope that Tony did.
"Okay. You just lay there looking gorgeous and keep your eyes closed, alright?" Without waiting for a response, Tony began touching him. Teasing brushes over his nipples, firm strokes across his stomach, a squeeze on his hip. Never lingering long in any one spot, causing his skin to tingle in anticipation.
Tony turned his attention back to Steve, snapping his fingers and gesturing for him to stand. “Follow me.”
Then the hand was back, stroking and teasing. Tony quickly learned the most effective ways of driving him crazy, working him back to the edge of orgasm. This time he didn’t pause in his demanding strokes, using the other hand to wield the crop against his entrance. Steve sobbed and screamed, struggling uselessly against the metal holding him open for Tony’s ministrations. No matter how hard he tried, it didn’t budge. He was unable to gain even an inch of movement that Tony didn’t want him to have. The combination of searing pain and conflicting pleasure was confusing him. Steve could feel his body building to an intense orgasm, the repeated denials ratcheting his desire higher. He trembled on the edge, mindlessly pleading with the other man for release.
“JARVIS, run a bath in the master for us.”
“There’s my good boy. Why don’t we give it a few days. Get settled in, and then I can start working on your glands?”
By week three, Bucky understood part of the problem. He’d woken up hard and aching, cock swollen and standing away from his body. It was such an unusual occurrence, he didn’t know what to do with it. He didn’t remember the last time he had been hard. Bucky simply laid there, staring at the massive thing pointing at the ceiling. Feeling it pulse and throb when the sounds of pleasure began in the other room. Hesitantly he reached for it, imagining how good it might feel to stroke over the length, the way he’d seen Steve do for Stark. The second his hand wrapped around the shaft, a full sensory memory rushed over him. Chemicals being injected into the side of his neck, his naked body strapped down to a table, only the flesh arm free. The stimulant making him ache and burn with arousal, cock hard and throbbing, need turning it a dark red. The electrodes buried under his skin sending bright bolts of pain shooting through his nervous system each time he’d tried to touch his cock. Trying over and over again, the need making him desperate for release. Days spent being tortured in the same fashion. Trained to ignore the needs of his body one by one. After all, an asset had no need of pleasure.
“Hands up. Hold onto the headboard. Don’t let go. I want to touch you.”
Steve looked up at him, blinking away the haze of tears. “Is a sub this world’s version of an omega?”
"No, baby. You were perfect. I stretched myself in the shower. I wanted to surprise you."
“Stop saying that!” Tony held his hands up in a peaceful gesture when Steve flinched back at his tone. It was obvious that he knew something was off about the situation, but had no idea what. He continued in a soothing tone. “Sorry. You’re okay. I’m okay. Everything’s just peachy. Alright?”
Steve felt a weight settle in the pit of his stomach, did his best to turn his back on the alpha, outraged all over again at the facility’s denial of clothes. He felt too exposed. On display. Which he obviously was. The alpha continued to speak to the handler, gaze trained on Steve for long moments, before he turned and walked away. Steve let out a breath, relaxing against the wall. Disaster averted, at least for the moment. They’d left, which meant he’d chosen someone else. Steve was still safe.
"Now why would I be nice to you like that, when you're being punished, sweetheart? Or did you forget?"
"Yeah. Simple as that."
Steve’s voice was soft and tear filled. “Please, Tony…?”
"Let’s get you cleaned up and then into the kitchen. Get you something to eat." Tony's lips quirked up into a wicked smile. "Wait until you try walking with the plug."
"No Tony. I'm... I'm good."
New chapter! I’m trying something a little different with this story, and shifting the point of view between Tony and Steve. Hopefully it’s not confusing. Let me know what you think, or if you prefer the stories where I stick with Steve’s POV the entire time. As always, happy reading and I hope you enjoy!
A quick stop to SHEILD before they fell gave him a photostatic veil and the ability to return as a much older version of himself. Everyone wanted to believe the romantic lie, making it easier to sell. After that it was easy to pass the shield off to Sam and disappear. He’d take care of Bucky, and the two men would be good for each other. Which left Steve free.
"You use it if you need to. I won't be mad. I will never be mad if you need us to stop."
He shook his head. “No.”
"So why don't you tell me what you would like. As a reward. Anything you want. Tell me how you want to come, baby."
“How- God, fuck! How do you make it stop?”
"So pretty like this." The wax was gone, replaced with the feel of Tony's nails scratching over his sensitive skin, peeling the hardened wax away. "Just for me."
