He curls up into a ball, tries to will the unwelcome tears away. There’s no reason for him to be crying like a pathetic little wretched thing, but here he is, nonetheless.
Tony really should come clean, right now. He opened his mouth to help the poor man out, but Iron Man raised a trembling hand to silence him.
“I understand, and I admire your loyalty, Mr. Rogers. Let me give you a warning, however, because if what I fear is happening, then I must tell you about it, so that you can try to hinder it. I’ve heard from the King that he’s looking to make Tony court sorcerer, because he wants Tony to confront the Witch of the Waste. But I know what few others know: that Janet and Tony have history. They were inseparable when they were younger, and I was there when they started their relationship. We were all taking magic classes together, and Tony was one of the brightest minds of the University. He was undoubtedly the most brilliant in our year, but Janet was very smart as well. In addition, they both came from wealthy and old families, and they both had a fire demon. It was almost inevitable that they ended up together. Janet wasn’t evil, at that time, you see. She was just a highly intelligent woman. But the danger with fire demons is that they can corrupt one’s heart. Hers was easily swayed into the evils of black magic, and the demon infected Janet, until evil completely took her over. Her heart is black as coal, now, and she goes by the name of the Witch of the Waste. Her decline happened over the course of several years, it was slow and gradual, and when Tony realised what was happening, he ended their relationship before she could corrupt him in turn. But I see now that she has managed to plant an evil seed in Tony, and that the seed has taken root. Please help him kill it before it kills him.”
Tony made no move to take the cup, still frozen with one hand on the piece of metal and another on the armour. Steve shuffled forward, put the cup down on a worktable, and leaned against it.
They avoided the more serious subjects neatly. Sometimes, it was just easier to pretend that everything was fine.
He clears his throat, almost bursts into tears again when it scratches a little too much, and speaks.
Steve cuts off his internal rambling: “You listen to what I say, you do as I want, and you don’t lie. If you even think of omitting something or bullshitting, all bets are off.”
Tony choked on his voice, eyes too wide. He wouldn’t be able to explain his marks away, now that Steve had seen.
It’s everything Tony has dreamed of and more. Steve’s devouring him, enveloping him whole, taking and taking and taking everything he can take from Tony, and Tony lets himself be kissed and smiles through treacherous tears. He clings to Steve, and hangs on and hopes this isn’t a dream.
That was the moment Jarvis chose to wake up, crackling loudly in the peaceful moment, and effectively killing the mood.
A dark form fell from the sky, breaking the clouds and stopping its descent only metres from the water surface. It rose up again, meeting a yellow blur in a turquoise flash.
The man moaned in pain, shuddered, hunched in on himself, and started breathing faster. His teeth were sharper than a minute ago. Steve lost track of what he’d been thinking, faced with the man’s agony.
The others, though… They’re dangerous, yes, but Tony’s faster. And stronger. He could snap Clint’s neck in the blink of an eye. Natasha, if she saw him coming, would prove more of a challenge. Tony would let her tire herself out, then he’d sweep in, hold her down, and bite at her femoral artery, let her bleed out.
Steve held out the cup, unsure of what to do now that it was evident that something was seriously wrong with the marks. Steve had suspected, of course, but it was another thing to see it confirmed.
He saw the perfect tool on the counter. A frying pan, nice and heavy, with a good momentum if he swung it with both his hands. Also, it was large enough to act as a shield if the scarecrow attacked him. Steve took it and went back to the door, opening it cautiously and peering outside. The scarecrow was right were he’d last seen it, barely a metre from the door, swinging its arms around. Steve grit his teeth, waited until it was within hitting distance, and flung the pan as hard as he could. It almost flew out of his hands, but it did its job: it hit the scarecrow dead on, which dropped instantly. Steve screamed at Jarvis to make the castle run faster and made sure they were a good distance from the downed scarecrow before telling Jarvis to slow down to his original speed again. He closed the door, his arms heavy and legs wobbly, dropped the pan on the floor with a clang, and collapsed on the sofa.
He walked out of the blue door and looked at the surroundings. The street was empty, which wasn’t surprising, since it had never been very frequented. There was the door to his shop, the one he’d always used to walk in and out, but there was a door that he didn’t recognise on the other side of the window. He opened it, and it led to the shop itself.
He coughed again, doubling over in pain, and fell to his knees. He looked up, eyes full of fear, as his face elongated, his teeth grew, his bones shifted, and snow-white fur sprouted from his skin. As fast as he had turned into a man, he was back into a dog, this time a huge white wolfdog. He whined, scratched his snout, and lay down in front of the fire, obviously exhausted.
They didn’t seem like bad people, though. Cap was friendly enough, and even if Iron Man was more suspicious, he wasn’t hostile anymore. Besides, the advanced lab could come in handy if Tony wanted to go back to his Rhodey and Pepper. God, he didn’t even know if it was possible. For all he knew, he’d ended in a twisted dream, or he’d died and this was the afterlife. He felt his heart beat faster at the thought. He didn’t want to pretend anymore. He wanted to go home. Man, what had he been thinking? He really wasn’t cut out for spy work.
Steve didn’t really have a choice, did he? He had to help, since this was partially his fault. He braced himself for what was likely to be a painful journey to the bathroom. Steve wasn’t looking forward to carrying Stark, he could already feel his heart beating faster. Reluctantly, he put Stark’s arms around his shoulders, dragging him sideways from the stool. Stark was heavier than he looked. He was also more muscled than Steve would have thought. But he couldn’t ignore it now that he was touching the man. His arms, chest and abdomen were well-defined under the slime.
Steve isn’t forcing Tony into anything. Tony can just stay curled up and cry until he feels empty enough to stand up and leave his quarters.
Steve’s mirth at the mental imagery disappeared when he remembered that Stark was powerful enough that the King wanted him to be court sorcerer, and realised that the further Natasha was from him, the better.
It was Tony’s turn to be confused. He’d never seen or heard anything about a red and gold armour. Was this one of the new projects of the Army? Tony hadn’t given them, or SHIELD, anything on his own suit, and the Nazi Arsenal did
Steve tensed. He’d forgotten about the weredog as well, he was being so quiet. A quick glance behind him confirmed that he hadn’t moved, still listening intently to their conversation. Could he understand them in dog form?
The ice exploded around him, and Steve was on his back, his body shivering uncontrollably, gasping for air.
Tony’s alive, which means that he can die. He thinks decapitation or a bullet through the head would kill him. He isn’t sure. JARVIS wouldn’t let him experiment too much on himself.
When Steve asked Jarvis about it, the demon just said that they had both been young and foolish boys when they made the contract.
Now that he thought of it, he could see the towers and battlements that hinted at a fortress or castle.
Iron Man grumbled a bit but came to the same conclusion as Tony: Cap wasn’t going to budge on his belief that this
Armour that kept others out, but kept him in. Safe from the outside world. Imprisoned. A part of him died there, inside the first suit. The rest of him never stopped screaming.
“The audience with the King is soon, I’d like to talk about it with you, if you’re still all right with going for me?”
They were closer than before, weren’t they? Had they been so close, that their breaths were intermingling, that Steve could count Tony’s every eyelash, that he could feel the puff of warmth as Tony licked his lips, as they leaned into their shared space and—
In a few hours, it would be time to open the shop, but that was not happening anymore. He should leave before then and make sure that no one saw him and started asking uncomfortable questions. He would need to travel by foot to save money. It would take longer to reach the capital city than with horse carriage or automobile, but it would be worth it. When he’d be in Ma’Hattan, he’d find a way to be useful, earn some money. And if all failed, he could always make himself a new life there. The city should have many opportunities, even for a sickly first-born like himself.
Stark’s eyes were wide, but he seemed to accept the answer readily enough, and walked over to where Steve was sitting, taking off his coat and letting it float to the nearest chair. It was beautiful, a shining red, gold and blue thing, and Steve remembered how Stark had flown away, always surrounded by that same blue light that permeated the castle.
If the old piece of paper was to be believed, the item they were looking for was hidden in one of the thousand crevices in a rock in the cave and could only be detected at a specific time on a specific night. If the
Tony fired. The bullet ricocheted off the armour, embedding itself in the wall, and the man shot the gun out of Tony’s hand with some kind of ray coming from the palm. Tony swore loudly and dropped to the ground, but another shot inches from his head had him freeze. The man clanked closer, burned the gun to a crisp with his hands, and dragged Tony up with a hand on his collar. The palm was glowing hot against his collarbone, daring him to try anything funny.
He tried to slam the door closed, his throat choked up from the panic, but she held it open effortlessly, her fingers gripping the wood hard enough to splinter it. Steve turned away from her, tried to warn the others, but before he could move, she’d jumped past him, sinking her claws into James’ arm, her body shifting until it was more fire than flesh. Tony and Strange surged up from their seats when they saw her, but she had a claw-like hand circling James’ throat, constricting his breathing, digging into his skin. His chest was heaving, and he scrabbled uselessly at her arms, burning himself in the process. She burned a bright red-orange, the glow much stronger than Jarvis’ feeble blue.
Tony’s fingers twitched, and Strange arms tensed, but Jocasta tightened her grip on James in warning. Blood was seeping through her claws, the only sound his pants for air and the crackling of the fire demons.
Steve couldn’t believe it. He thought he had two options to regain his body, that if he didn’t manage to break the contract, or if Stark kicked him out, he would still have a chance with Potts. But there was no Potts. Potts was Stark, and that meant that Steve had no other choice but to stay in the moving castle.
“I’ve felt more alive these last few months than I’ve felt in years. You came in, and with your paintings and stubbornness and kindness you made this place a home. You helped me with the King, you got me home after fighting the Witch, you protected our home from intruders. You’ve been guarding me since you came here, you won’t let me lie to you, you saw through me and you stayed. You can’t know how grateful I am that you stayed. “
He stumbles, trips and falls on his back, and Steve is on him before he can right himself. Steve is a formidable foe, a master in close-quarter fighting, and each and every one of his punches lands. Tony is very much not an expert in hand-to-hand. Besides, most of his techniques he knows from sparring with Steve, which means that he is at a disadvantage, and that he should get Steve off him, get some distance between them.
"They threw a device at the arm," he answers, stoic. Then they walk him to sit on the chair they set up for him and start checking him up.
Pepper frowns. "But…" she trails off as she twists her wrist to show him. Her mark's turned dull. A faint trace of the black lines that formed into ‘Maya Hansen'. Tony frowns, too, and looks back at Pepper, whose face is a puzzle.
Rhodey gives him a playful shove. They take a couple of more steps before Rhodey remembers. "They opened a section for him at the Smithsonian, you know?"
me?” Tony asks sarcastically and Steve lets out a breathy laugh. Tony then draws a soft smile and leans on the bar table. “Not that I’m complaining but why exactly are you here?” he asks.
Thor unstraps Loki from his seat and, grabbing him by his neck, flies outside the jet with almost no effort at all. Tony stands up, pays no mind to the fact that he had one of the
"JARVIS is intangible, he is incorruptible. He won't do anything he's not programmed to," Tony explains, like he's talking about basic sums.
“Captain Rogers, wait!” the woman yells in the back but he just starts running his way out, any way possible. “All agents, code 13! I repeat. All agents, code 13!” her voice sounds through the place.
“Jesus, Jimmy, are you really not going to get him? I thought you finally got some sense into you,” Allen whines.
with ambushes and shit. He walks in with his beam ready and he doesn’t stop holding his breath until he hears his name.
Allen blinks, surprised. “What do you mean ‘good job’? Why aren’t you suiting up to go catch his ass before he takes a bus and he’s in a whole different country by the time you get there?”
Next to him, his other brand-new problem stands, shifting uncomfortably like he’s out of place. Tony stops to consider that.
Except that he now looks far wiser than he was when Rhodey met him, somehow more serene, but still slightly shaken.
Steve looks at him with a quirked eyebrow, amused. “Yeah? I can already feel the serum starting to heal me,” he says.
Tony hands him the glass with the drink and raises his so they can clink them together. “Wait, what are we toasting to?” Tony asks.
The sibling Gods disappear in a blue light, surely powered by the cube, and Fury then stands in the spot they were just standing on. He looks at each one of them and he nods.
Thor smiles widely and takes another bite of his food. “Mmm,” he says then, covering his mouth with a closed fist. “I would appreciate you’d let me know when Banner returns,” he asks.
“Rhodes!” comes Tony’s voice. Rhodey finishes entering and his faceplate lifts up; he’s gotta see this with his own eyes.
Natasha's green eyes stare at him and her eyebrows curve in a questioning look. "If it was the other way around, and it was down to me to save your life —now you be honest with me— would you trust me to do it?" she asks, her voice unfaltering.
“Well, I think that was meant for you,” Banner keeps going, pointing at Tony, who offers him blueberries. “Even if Barton didn't tell Loki about the tower, it was still all over the news,” Banner says, grabbing some of the fruit.
Tony blinks and shakes his head. “I wouldn’t—I mean, you don’t have to talk about it but I – I wouldn’t feel sorry. I get it,” he says, then gives Steve a look with all sorts of meaning.
"Lying on a marshmallow. Feel like I'm gonna sink right to the floor," Steve cuts in, all too knowing and Sam nods. "How long?" he asks.
“You know what I mean,” Sam says, shrugging. “Wanna play?” he says, a beat later, and offers Steve a cue.
When she sees Maya being released by the medical staff, she walks over with the Iron Man helmet under her arm. "Are you okay?" she asks worriedly, her gaze fixed on the cut on Maya's forehead.
“Call every lab you know, tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for gamma rays. I'll rough out a tracking algorithm based on basic cluster recognition. At least we could rule out a few places,” the Doctor instructs, taking off his jacket, and Nick nods. “Do you have somewhere for me to work?” he asks.
Again, I'm sorry I keep dissappearing for weeks. Feel free to reach me over @tazadekarma (on Twitter) or buckyrhodey (on Tumblr) to scream at me or something. Love to hear from you, guys.
He's desperate; his heart is up his throat and he draws breaths but they're not getting to his lungs. He doesn't know what to do.
“Could use a few more. Where’s Clint?” Steve asks. He woke up this morning to see Clint’s new gifted motorcycle gone and Tony mentioned something about him wanting a jetpack before he took off.
Agent guy is the first person Tony sees once he lands on the Helicarrier and exits the suit. He looks at Tony with a forced, loop-sided smile and Tony grins.
They don’t fill the air with any other unnecessary, dangerous statements. They’re getting excellent at saying everything they feel with their glances alone.
"For christ's sake, he is a monster," Yu says, loudly, as he points at the pictures of the Winter Soldier on the highway. "He is a traitor to this nation. He's gonna get court-martialed if he's lucky."
But he doesn’t know Tony keeps Rhodey grounded, at the end of the day. He doesn’t know Tony makes him laugh, drives him up the wall, scares the shit out of him and marvels him — all at the same time. He doesn’t know Tony’s the one constant thing in his life that’s not related to him by blood or some distant fellow military colleague. Tony is his family, his platonic soulmate. Gabriel doesn’t get that.
"Let's hope," Clint turns to say to them and opens the door. "Laura? I'm home," Clint says, calling for someone.
Tony takes a deep breath and lets go of the touch, easily, casually, unlike that first handshake which still burned in the back of Steve’s mind. “I—just,” he shrugs and looks up, like he’s struggling to come up with an idea.
“Well, we're not the '27 Yankees,” Steve says, tilting his head a little, as they make their way to the hangar to greet their new official additions to the Avengers team.
Tony steps in with the uttermost effort at not making gag noises as soon as the smells hit his nostrils and instead tries to focus on getting his hands clean. Just as he’s about to rub his right one he spots some odd, black lines on his wrist. He rubs it with the towel, too, and then takes another look.
But then Maya's smile disappears and her gaze goes unfocused. She paces around the room for a minute before she finally takes off her shoes and sits on the bed.
He's about to grab the Scepter when he feels something move behind his back and his blood runs cold.
Next thing, he's having Pepper rightfully scream at him and Rhodey calling him on the phone from a foreign number to also do more yelling.
Rhodey shrugs and lets go of the bottle. "What? Can I be happy we just saved the world and you finally got some?"
Steve takes a couple of them and studies them. Tony has a raw ability but Steve can still see a gentle, quite artistic touch to his drawings.
"You mean the villain?" Rhodey replies, quirking an eyebrow and Allen just shrugs. "Yeah, no. He's his soulmate," Rhodey replies, casually checking his phone in case Tony's left him any messages or anything.
But the guy ducks under his arms and gets inside. “Oh, wow. He made it. He made the cut,” Tony mutters.
“I know. After 44 years, I’m finally a functioning person,” Tony answers, raising his eyebrows. "You like what I’ve done with the place?”
“Rhodes, that’s not important, c’mon. It’s not like I even know her or have time to search for her,” Carol explains and Jim figures that makes sense. But he knows that’s not fair, for himself or for her. He’s wasting time on someone who’s not meant for him and she’s wasting time on someone like him.
And Tony finally understands what they meant when they said you’d harmonize with your soulmate like a second, shinier skin.
Allen has been with him since he was a Second Lieutenant at Edwards. Rhodey was one of the groomsmen at Allen's wedding. He was one of the few officers Rhodey actually considered a friend and the only one who knew he was into guys, even before DADT was repealed.
“Well, we’re not imprisoned here, either,” he refutes. “It’s just some hours, I’ll be back before the sun starts to open its pretty little eyes,” he says. Rhodey’s sleepy enough to picture an actual sun blinking.
“Listen, Tony,” Steve begins, taking a step forward. “I know I’ve been a little absent since—well, since pretty much everything that happened with SHIELD last year and I just—I’m sorry. It’s not the way I meant for it to be,” he says.
“You know what I do think we should do— seriously though,” Tony goes, bending down to sit on the chair Sam was sitting on without letting go of Steve’s hand. "We should stop running in circles. Doing this whole ‘I have to do this on my own' play of fucking, Shakespearean proportions.”
The story of his alter-ego, however, is a much deeper mystery. Like Yu had suggested, the Winter Soldier was presumed to be involved in at least over two hundred deaths in at least 23 different countries.
Tony walks over to the bar and pours water into a glass. Rhodey fights the urge to make an impressed face at that. “So what brings you by?" he asks, taking a sip. "Let me guess, our baby needs an update,” Tony wonders.
In the middle of the Afghan desert, Tony stands like an imposing statue; looking even bigger than he is with his Armani suit and Carrera sunglasses.
He goes to grab his shield resting against the couch after he's put on the suit, Tony's at his back. "I'll take Natasha and Clint," he tells him.
Pepper leads the way to Maya and they've almost reached her when the floor breaks up under their feet, leaving Tony trapped on the far side of a huge fissure while the women still have an escape route out the front door. Pepper hesitates, turning to Tony, but he shouts at her to keep going. "Grab Maya! I'll find another way out!"
Tony studies him with a look, before he huffs a smile. "Who would've thought it. Cap likes dudes," Tony says, amused.
“I slept for 70 years, sir. I think I've had my fill,” Steve answers, still throwing punches at the bag.
Tony bites his lower lip and looks behind Pepper’s back at nothing. “So, essentially, you’re telling me to ignore this?” Tony asks.
“Iron Man,” she says, turning back to look at the tower building behind her. “A lot of people eat here just to see him fly by,” she adds.
“Don’t worry, I’m sure he’s just taking a few days off, working on a tan,” Tony assures him with a hand on his shoulder.
They're still staring at each other when room service knocks on the door. Pepper goes over to open the door. "Hi, good evening. Come on in," she tells the waiter, moving aside to let him in. But with no warning, Killian appears behind the man and brutally snaps his neck. It all happens fast, in less than a second.
Pepper pulls away from the hug and quirks and eyebrow. “Speaking of Steves,” she trails and Tony groans. “How did it go?” she asks.
"Well, I wanted to repay you the selfsame gift that you so graciously imparted to me," Killian says as he grabs tiny metal orbs in his hand and throws them on the floor. "Desperation," he says and a hologram appears between them.
Tony falls dead silent and then closes his eyes and wrinkles his nose. “Fuck—that was insensitive, I’m sorry, I didn’t know—”
Being with her is like flying –not that he has yet, not outside of a simulator, but that’s exactly how Jim thinks flying feels like: sheer liberty, breeze, complete joy, the perfect amount of excitement and vertigo. Rhodes has been with other women before, about a handful of them, but none of them made him feel like his feet were off the ground. Not like Carol Danvers.
As Pepper’s hologram disappears, Steve shows up by the threshold, a paper bag in his right hand, a Starbucks coffee in the other.
Steve follows with a quiet “sure” and a frown at the name of the drink, but he's keeping in mind Pepper’s words.
He tried to have Sam bring a few of the guys from Washington, but it was hard to get it done, even with Tony providing plane tickets.
“Last night,” Tony deadpans. “The packet, Selvig's notes, the Extraction Theory papers. Am I the only one who did the reading?” he says, his arms open.
"The scepter is alien," JARVIS informs like he's reminding Tony. "There are elements I can't quantify," he adds as Tony makes his way to the blender to make Barton a smoothie.
“Indeed. He’s riding the elevator as we speak,” JARVIS informs and Rhodey waits by it until it slides open and delivers an excited Tony, crashing against his chest in a hug.
He raises his head slowly. "Steve?" He asks, the memory of the blond stuck in the back of his brain like a wine stain on a piece of cloth.
As much as he’d like to stay and talk all night, all the nights, with Steve, the New York sky threatens him every day.
The roof falling on their heads after hearing everything Zola told them perfectly symbolizes how he currently feels, Steve muses as he carries Natasha's unconscious body out of the mess without getting spotted.
Tony had gone through surgery to get his chest piece removed just a month and a half ago and had decided to recover in one his apartments in L.A. and Steve had flown back here after the first week to get settled.
"No, fuck you, Steve," he spits and shakes his arm off his grip. "I'm done talking, that's not gonna solve anything,"  he says and storms back inside his lab.
Maya flinches like Pepper's name is a final blow, and inhales shakily. Tony can only hope that Maya is realizing how wrong she's gone.
"Have you called Barton?" Steve diverts, but genuinely curious. Tony wasn't a SHIELD agent, but her soulmate was.
He squints his eyes and stares at Steve's chest. "Wow. That's weird," Tony mutters. He can even feel his skin go warmer, his muscles less strained.
"It's not that we want you, it's that we need you to do," Ross speaks, walking towards him. "I mean no disrespect to your servicemen, Lewis," he says, looking at Yu.
"No, of course you don't, Stark. 'Cause we don't talk about stuff," Clint says, an innocent smile on his face. "Which is fine, I don't need all my friends to know all my shit. Whatever. That's what I got Natasha for, but— I fear that's your problem here with Cap, right? You guys don't talk?"
Rhodey's wrist itches out of impulse. "Then, I'll act as I should," he replies with a smile and turns back on his heels to leave.
Part of those years, she lived helping a young, rebellious Tony Stark alongside a man named Edwin Jarvis.
"Oh, c'mon, you're not gonna tell me you're actually afraid of him," Allen says, trying for humor but there's a question in his eyes.
Tony walks over to the worktable with the special tab folder. “The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought— and I didn't even qualify,” Tony says, turning to the Agent just one time.
Tony puts a finger on his lips, and then he smiles like he did just before licking him. "You ready to see how that might work for your benefit?" he asks.
Happy leaves with a long sigh and they take off just minutes after. They’ve been up in the air for several minutes when the silence starts to bother Tony.
"It's not all just like that. The truth is a matter of circumstance," she says. "It's not all things to all people, all the time. Neither am I," Natasha adds.
"Two targets, Level Six," Pierce adds, walking over to him sitting on the table. "They already cost me Zola," he says, sitting in front of him, and in the back, he hears light footsteps approaching again. "I want confirmed death in 10 hours," Pierce demands.
“—atmosphere,” Tony finishes. “And yeah, to get re-inspired. Yeah,” he says, pointing at Steve with his finger. “I need a change of scenery.”
"You shaped a century. And I need you to do it one more time," Pierce continues. "Society’s at a tipping point between order and chaos. And tomorrow morning, we’re gonna give it a push", he adds.
"In his language database," Tony retorts. "He was supposed to learn slang, not go insane," he mutters.
Hill hands him her tablet. “Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins. Orphaned at 10 when a shell collapsed their apartment building,” she tells him. “Sokovia's had a rough history. It's nowhere special, but it's on the way to everywhere special,” she says as they make their way inside.
"I had to get you to shut up somehow," Steve breathes on his lips and Tony's entire body is acting like he just got an electric shot.
“—But, you know, the suit can take the weight, right?” Rhodey’s saying as he grabs a drink from the bar counter. “So I take the tank, fly it right up to the general's palace, drop it at his feet. I'm, like, ‘Boom. You looking for this?’,” he jokes but Tony and Thor only half-grin at him. "’Boom. Are you looking for’— why do I even talk to you guys?  Everywhere else, that story kills,” Rhodey says, mildly annoyed.
The man falls on the pavement and, again, draws his shield to protect himself from the bullets of his gun. They just bounce right off it and he figures they didn't tell him enough about this man.
She eyes him for a second before she comes to the conclusion: "Of course he wouldn't tell you," she deadpans.
He’s been flipping through pages when he catches something interesting. Tony sits upright and looks better at the computer screen. “Holographic illusion technology, hmmm…”
"I was hoping you might join him," Clint says, hands in his pockets, by the threshold. "I got you your spare gym shirt and some jeans you had in the Quinjet if you wanna shower and change a bit. Stark already borrowed a few of my clothes," he explains.
when I went near his stuff,” Tony says, trying not to think of any particular moment but there were many.
The flight programs and classes he took during his college years didn’t make him any less excited about the prospects of becoming an Air Force Pilot. Of fulfilling his dream. Of touching the sky.
Tony lets out another chuckle. “No, that ship’s sailed. Natasha turned me down, said she and Robin Hood aren’t interested in living with me,” he says, eyes narrowing at the last part, like he’s almost offended. “Then Bruce went back to Virginia with his soulmate and honestly, can’t hold it against him. And I don’t even know how to contact Thor,” he explains.
But Pepper needed him and it had been forever since she’d taken a leave, so he was gonna pull through and dust off an old persona he had long since forgotten.
“Raise the mizzenmast. Jib the topsails,” Tony jokes. All the agents turn to him like he’s annoying kid on a school trip. “That man is playing Galaga. Thought we wouldn't notice, but we did,” he yells, pointing out at the blonde agent. Then he spots the screens on the left side and: “How does Fury even see these?”
"Listen, all I'm saying is that we're not even sure if the guy's still alive," Rhodey adds. "Last time they saw him he was fighting Cap on board of a burning Helicarrier. He could be turning purple at the bottom of the Potomac as we speak."
It takes Tony a second before he blinks in realization of whatever Pepper means. “Oh, really?” he asks.
Tony is being a little shit and having way too much fun with this. In the back, some fashion show is making fun of Rhodey’s new brand.
But now that he had the power, they engaged in developing newer and better technology for all kinds of purposes.
“I trust everything will be fine. Plus, you have very worthy new company now,” Thor agrees, twisting his hammer in his hand and smiling at Tony before they start to walk out.
"Which is why— and I think Thaddeus agrees with me, you're the perfect guy for this next mission," he says and Rhodey swallows, confused.
"You're asking me like I don't have trouble understanding my own soulmate," Clint mutters, sinking comfortably on the couch.
"No. Ultron could have assimilated Jarvis," Bruce replies. "This isn't strategy. This is— rage," he adds.
Harley shakes his head, looking at the reactor. "Nope. I came with my mom after we got a call from— Mister, mmm, Rhodey. War Machine," Harley explains, with a big smile on his face.
Even standing on the top of the ten-story building, Jimmy feels small, just a tiny space in a universe infinite times larger. One last tear helplessly rolls down his cheek and he decides it’s time to let go. He will have to do without his backpack or the sharks will get more vicious. He will make new friends even though everybody in 5
The following week Steve signs up on a gym one train stop away from his new apartment, after deciding staying in bed without sleeping, drowning in nightmares and over-thinking, will do him no good.
“No, but you know my mom would have my head if I miss another family holiday. She still hasn’t forgiven me for last year,” Rhodey says and Tony waves a hand Rhodey can’t see.
Steve just lets out a short breath and replays the last couple of hours in his head. Absolute, freaking weird chaos.
Tony looks down at that and Rhodey just stares at Barnes laughing in the video, feeling a weird ache on his chest.
With a choked up noise, his eyes pop open. The noise makes Rhodey jump on his chair and Pepper run up to him.
Steve talks to Peggy over the phone after that first night every day for an entire week, only for half hour, about little things, when she asks him to visit her.
“Tony Stark? Great speech, man!” a guy comes from his right side, all excitement. Happy is in seconds next to him, softly pushing the guy away.
Rhodey just almost glares at him. “He’s not doing anything,” he says, pointing at the picture again.
Agent Romanoff gives the bag to Banner and he shakes her hand goodbye, then he looks at Steve and smiles, a ‘goodbye’ too.
“I'm sorry,” Rogers says, and he sounds like a completely different guy. Not the cold, judgmental hardcover he’s been talking to for the past few hours. “He seemed like a good man,” he adds.
"Rhodey," Tony says and Rhodey looks up at him. Tony moves his chin up back to the Barnes info. "He's called James. Isn't that funny?" he says.
It doesn't matter if everything he read is right, there's something incredibly off about a former US soldier, Great Depression-survivor, three-time boxing champion becoming the Soviet's very own wet-dream come true.
“No, Ed, it’s fine. They deserve it, right? I mean, when was the last time Dad took Mom anywhere nice? This is good for them,” he tells him. Jarvis closes his mouth in a thin line, at a loss of words.
Tony barely has time to figure out what's going on before the missile hits the house, sending all of them flying.
His hands go up and open defensively but he smiles. “Hey,” Tony greets, far too cheerfully considering Pepper’s current state. “I tried calling you, you know,” he adds and smacks the side of his head. “Ow!”
He gets to spend some time in Philly before he has to report for the Initial Flight Training, a couple of months after his commissioning after graduation.
Rhodey keeps watching the footage of Tony's wrecked mansion, shaking his head. "Colonel Rhodes," Vice President Rodriguez calls and Rhodey turns to him. "I just got off the phone with AIM. The Patriot will be ready to fly in thirty minutes," he explains.
"Person bodies," Tony cuts in. "The human form is inefficient. Biologically speaking, we're outmoded— but he keeps coming back to it," he says.
Tony’s eyes roll for a sec in the air until he looks at the clock hanging on the wall, it’s just about to be 1PM, right on lunchtime. “Ok, so, where’s Pepper?” he asks, grabbing a wet towel to start trying to clean his hands as he presses the button to call the elevator.
Steve shrugs one shoulder. “I think it was a good quote, in hindsight. Maybe you should sell that on t-shirts,” he jokes.
“Why are ya’ll so afraid of what’s different?” he asks the five white men standing in front of him, almost smiling with utter pity at them.
"He's easy to track. He's everywhere," Fury replies. "The guy is multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit."
"The girl tried to warp my mind," Thor says on the comms. "Take special care. I doubt a human could keep her at bay— fortunately, I am mighty."
She’s about to say something when Howard comes back, only one handbag in hand. “Do me a favor? Try not to burn the house down before Monday,” he asks.
“Then don’t,” Peggy says, a hopeful smile on her face. “You be something else, something better. Turn Stark Industries into everything your father could not, Tony,” she says, grabbing his hands in her wrinkles-covered ones.
Suddenly, Tony falls quiet but his smile stays as he looks down at his hands, clasped together as they stand just by the bar table.
Álvarez stops asking questions this time and later on Rhodey finds out he's not into Star Wars. Betrayal on all the nerd community.
“They’re not illegal, per se. Not that many casualties have happened, at least not on record, to make it so – it’s more of a medical recommendation not to do this, it’s not like getting an abortion though I’ve already seen groups pulling some BS about it, just like they do with abortion. I say it’s up to anyone who wants to go through it that’s whiling to accept this is a developing science and might come with a price,” she explains. “But if there’s nothing wrong with you, then, yes, I’d argue it might be your soulmate trying to get rid of their mark, and that resulting in your random loss of it,” she adds, looking at Rhodey.
Thor looks from where he’s standing with a proud smile. He’s always liked the big guy. “The gates of Hel are filled with the screams of his victims,” he says, raising his fist.
Tony raises his head and swallows, as much as he’d like letting Fury take all the blame, he knows he could’ve —should’ve done— something. Not letting Loki in, for starters.
"That you're not the problem," Clint says and shuts him up again. "That this whole 'being out of sync' thing is not because you two are terrible for each other. You just— have to get it out of your system," he explains, and actually gives him a sympathetic smile.
Destiny making them soulmates most likely means nothing to him, and even if it did, Steve wouldn’t risk the fate of millions of people just so they could try something.
"Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. You should take another lap," the guy replies, moving his hand around and turning his face a little. Then he turns back and says: "did you just take it? I assume you just took it."
“Ok, so, clearly the guy is not an evil killing machine. That doesn’t mean he’s stable. Or that he should be left alone,” Allen says.
Next thing, he's having Pepper rightfully scream at him and Rhodey calling him on the phone from a foreign number to also do more yelling.
Steve wants to roll his eyes at him, but it won't do any good. "Well, let's just say you haven't seen it yet," Steve says.
, he’s fine,” Tony says, waving it off with a hand. “Only has a little of boundary issues,” he adds.
The women fall quiet around him and Tony almost wants to smile. "I'm Pepper, by the way," Pepper adds, after she's done losing herself in the brown of Maya's eyes.
“And I will. Back home,” Tony repeats, at that something in the doctor’s eyes shift. Understanding, perhaps. “I promise you. I just need something for my shoulder, something to clean up a bit and then I’m good to take the ride back to our beloved homeland,” he says, and the doctor nods.
"No, I'm a visionary," Killian replies. "But I do own a maniac. And he takes the stage tonight," he adds, before he walks out.
Tony walks through the main room and stops just at the third door, the one at the back, near the dining table. He moves his hand up for Steve to come in.
Steve smiles brightly at him and he leans forward to kiss him when there's a loud knock on the door.
Lieutenant O’Conner appears in the room and all of them move swiftly to salute. “What are you all still doing here? Go back to your rooms, it’s almost 1900,” he orders and they all scatter in a poof.
Tony watches Killian leave the room with his heart racing, but then he starts hearing something from where Maya's body fell and then he sees her.
"Why, Ms. Barton, you little minx," Tony mutters. "I get it. Maria Hill called you, right?" Tony asks him. "Was she ever not working for you?"
They meet with Loki in handcuffs and the Tesseract on Thor’s capable hands the next day; a bright one it is, Steve muses as he watches that blue cosmic thing manage to still exist even after seventy years, much like he does.
Tony already had his legs circled around Steve’s waist and he didn’t even need to break their kiss to press on his floor.
"If you think back to Switzerland, you said you'd meet me on the rooftop, right? Well, for the first 20 minutes, I actually thought you'd show up. And the next hour... I considered taking that one-step shortcut to the lobby. If you know what I mean."
“Agh, I had to take care of my grandma. Sorry I couldn't make it, but I’m sure you boys didn’t miss me,” she explains and gives him a smile at last.
Pierce leaves with four men following after him and the room is left empty, only people at the other side of the door. Free people.
Then, his mind picks up with the memories of the day before, coffee and honest talk. Stories, God — so many stories about the forties and the war and 80’s music and TV shows and goddamned Star Wars.
“Miss Carter, can you give me a moment alone with Master Stark?” Jarvis asks Peggy behind him, and she leaves giving Tony a sympathetic look, all her previous anger gone. “Anthony, look at me,” he asks and Tony drives his eyes back up. “I have sat and watched for the last five months as you waste yourself away with liquor and people who do not care about you. I will do so no more,” he begins to say but Tony’s panic gets the best out of him.
"Oh, you really hit the jackpot with him, didn't you?" Tony sarcastically tells Natasha, looking at Clint make a mess of himself with his food.
"I'm being sent to the Middle East in case some people start blaming each other instead of you," Rhodey adds, noticing Tony behind Natasha.
“Good to meet you, Colonel,” he adds, an honest and also tired smile on his face. Rhodey replies back and then looks at Tony, who’s eyes are surprisingly still as he’s trying to communicate with Rhodey via telepathy.
“Mechanical Engineering,” Rhodey shares, too. It's always soothing to find a fellow nerd. Rhodey walks over to the remaining twin bed and puts his bag on it.
Tony shakes his head and against his better judgment says, “This feeling like I can’t breathe around you.”
Tony tsks. “But I did,” he replies. “The only difference is that my oath doesn’t require me to wear matching outfits and salute the flag every twelve hours.”
“I am. Wanna know why?” the man asks and then he leans into his ear and he stiffens at the warmth radiating from him.
did it, but yeah—you know…” he trails and then does a thing with his eyebrows as he points to Steve chatting with Thor far in the room.
“Did it to spite me?” Álvarez asks, that big ass smile of his coming up again. Rhodey sips his mouth shut, still embarrassed. “Listen— don’t, okay? I have no place to say that sort of shit, I’ve just—been caught up in myself lately, and that makes me an asshole, most of the times. You clearly have questions yourself, and I have no right to push yo—”
“Let me guess,” Bucky trails in English and Nadejda turns to frown at him. “English?— No, American,” he asks the man, fully turning to him now.
Steve felt a weird sense of happiness and satisfaction. “We won,” Steve breathes and Tony’s eyes land back on him.
Tony smiles softly at his mug, remembering Maria Stark and her blonde curls and dimples. “She was sweet but cunning. She could cut you with a smile. Kind, had a great sense of humor. Smart.”
So he makes up to go and decidedly not talk to him for several hours when Steve tries to grab him. "Tony—"
"Yeah, uhh, I lied," Killian replies, totally careless. "Now, this is live," he says, talking to Tony again, turning his back on Maya. "I'm not sure if you can tell, but at this moment the body is trying to decide whether to accept Extremis or just give up," he explains as Pepper opens her mouth in a scream Tony's glad he can't hear. "And if it gives up, I have to say— the detonation is quite spectacular. But until that point, it's really just a lot of pain," he finishes.
“Yeah, who doesn't love revels?” Tony mutters, laying back on the table. “Captain?” he asks, because he knows Steve’s been off since SHIELD’s collapse.
"I'm closing in," Tony replies. He lands on one of the floors and takes care of the agents pointing their guns at him. "Jarvis, am I— closing in?" he asks out of the comms. "Do you see a power source for that shield?"
“ржaвый,” the handler nearly spits. He stares back with a twist of his neck. It's fun when he puts up a fight but he doesn’t have the energy to now.
"Recall that? A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space. We're standing 300 feet below it," Tony speaks. "We're the Avengers. We can bust arms dealers all the livelong day, but that up there? That's the endgame. How do you guys plan on beating that?" Tony asks them, and Steve knows his heart is on his sleeve.
Everyone sits on the table, relaxed and at ease, ready to have their meal and Rhodey smiles widely because he can't remember the last time he had an actual group of friends and it wasn't just him and Tony against the world.
"Listen, Tony— I'm sorry. About our talk at the Tower, I didn't mean to imply you wanted Ultron to go rogue. All my fears keep, just— clouding my better judgment,"  Steve says, not really looking at him.
"I'm just asking 'cause—  I think I ought to know if you did," Tony defends but Steve hasn't stopped frowning.
Steve lets out a breath and remembers the moment vividly; remembers his harsh words to Tony on the carrier and how all he could think about as Tony flew himself out of Earth was that Steve wanted a second chance.
Like everything else was just some artificial replacement. Like he's been living in a pod and was just let out of it for the first time just now.
Steve shakes his head at that. Tony should be mad, he should be seething. Not pleading for him not to do some reckless shit again.
“If it was, maybe we wouldn’t be having this conversation,” she says and Tony gives her a faint smile. “If you’re really decided for it, I can do some research on the safest places to get it done. Call it a favor I’ll surely collect some time,” she offers.
Rhodey sighs and raises his eyebrows at him after she’s gone. “That was really out of fucking nowhere,” he says.
He gives Tony a little punch in the gut and clicks his tongue. “You know what I mean,” Rhodey defends. He won’t talk about his sexual attraction questions with Tony right now.
“I don’t care what other fellow airmen do in their spare time, as long as they’re respectable and effective out there, where it matters,” he says, collected.
Pepper hears the message right after the authorities speak to her about trying to clear the wreckage to see if they can officially pronounce Tony dead. She's too busy feeling relieved to actually be angry at Tony for pulling yet another one his stunts.
“Hey,” Steve takes a few more steps towards him, eyeing the room around once more. The place is just lackluster. “I just got back from England,” he adds.
"Yeah, I don't know, it's a tricky thing," Rhodey says, stuffing his hands back in his pocket as they got warm enough. "I think I'm gonna stick with Doctor Cho's theory, though," he adds.
Tony sighs and looks out the big window of the kitchen; in the front yard, Howard’s bright beige Cadillac Brougham is parked. “So, where is he, my old man?” he asks.
Steve lets his head fall on Tony's shoulder and sighs. "I'm quickly regretting not doing this in your room," he mutters.
"Jesus, Tony," Steve lets out, hoarse, absolutely ruined, his fingers all deep lost in thick, brown locks.
Steve props on his elbows and takes Tony's mouth again, his chest tightening with excitement and rush almost as if he's off to battle.
Remembering who he was and living with everything he did was going to be the punishment he got for allowing them to turn him into this monster.
Tony opens his eyes in surprise. “Is that a thing people actually do?” Steve moves his eyebrows in positive reply. “I hate this world,” Tony mutters.
“I know guys with none of that worth ten of you,” he says, almost spitting. Up close, his icy blue eyes seem colder. “I've seen the footage. The only thing you really fight for is yourself,” he says. The words sting on his wrist but the burning hate on his gut is all too familiar. “You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play, to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you,” he adds. Tony hasn’t even blinked, he won’t cower from the stare now.
"Thaddeus, you know Colonel James Rhodes, right?" Yu introduces him, pointing at Rhodey with an open palm.
“I'm going to take the jet to D.C. tonight,” Pepper whispers, starring at the dude with the Hammer. “You have homework. You have a lot of homework,” she adds.
"I have no problem talking about it, especially because I can't change a thing," he says. "But I understand why you wouldn't," he adds, being honest.
Inside the elevator, Steve feels expectancy bubble up in his stomach, Tony stands still next to him — a considerable distance but it still manages to make Steve’s skin pick up some form of electricity.
“Jim, wait,” Allen catches him on the way to get his armor, just right outside his office. He shoves a piece of paper into his hand and looks around suspiciously.
“I know. Just, tell him that after some time has passed. I’m sure Steve will open up once he’s healed enough,” Rhodey says.
But Tony lets out a chuckle to ease the air. "Just get us two glasses of water, please," he says, kindly.
Rhodey wets his lower lip. "It's not that I don't like him, it's just— he had this whole, odd way of going on about it, like, he said 'this is the age of freaks'. What's that about? Then there's all his history with Dr. Banner and—"
After months of more violence and blood than Rhodey would’ve ever wanted to see, President Clinton decided to withdraw U.S. forces from Somalia, deeming it more necessary to put attention in Yugoslavia and in Iraq in support of Kurdish and Shiite minorities.
Maria hands him a tablet. "Not anymore," she says, as she shows him the picture of Strucker dead in a cell.
He sits on the bench and looks up at Pierce, conveying nothing in his eyes while Pierce looks at him with a near-absolute wonder.
“—She's not like the others,” Tony says. “Come on. Let's go in the bedroom,” he tells her, grabbing on the laptop and carrying it into the bedroom. “Happy, leave her ficus alone,” he instructs his bodyguard and chauffeur.
Happy has barely time to register what’s happening before he’s flying across the air and landing with a thud that will make his back hurt for months. But at least he lies glad knowing that he’d been right about these dudes' sketchy attitudes this whole time.
"Yeah, I'll give her a kick," Tony tells her, then he turns to Steve and nods, but not because he agrees, but because he's daring him.
Tony shrugs at that. "Nah, just had time to read me through like I'm some sort of open book and then made me feel bad about it," Tony says.
Suddenly, Natasha relaxes as she goes: "Well, you seem pretty chipper for someone who just found out they died for nothing," she says, trying to dig through his emotional state, now.
“At the Pentagon, right?” he interrupts his father. “Don’t worry, you’re gonna love the Christmas menu at the commissary,” he tells his mother, all fake smiles.
It’s messy, it’s tongues and breaths and teeth and Tony’s pulling the hairs of the back of his head when Steve presses his tongue against the roof of his mouth. It’s like nothing Steve’s ever experienced before.
Pepper smiles and looks around the room, but Rhodey’s got no one near. “Tell everyone I say hi,” she says.
Tony notices Maya turning from her computer, a resigned look on her face. "Just like old times, huh?"
Pepper rolls her eyes. “If you want us to be settled in Malibu by next week, you need to get here ASAP. Work with me, Tony, c’mon,” she says, a little tiredly.
"I didn't say that," Rhodey replies. Allen stares at him like he's completely lost. "I said I don't think he's a threat, but that doesn't mean we don't have to look into him," he adds.
"Clint's hit!" Natasha yells. "Somebody wants to deal with that bunker?" she asks and then says "thank you" a minute later.
“I did something,” Tony declares and Steve looks at him with a thousand questions on his face. Fair enough. “I mean, for you –for all, all of you,” Tony’s quick to clarify, his palm slightly open. “Follow me,” he asks, walking towards the elevator.
“I mean, if you’re right, and he was brainwashed—can you really hold someone accountable for their actions if they had their brains smushed?” Rhodey muses, but he’s not looking at Tony.
“Master Stark is on the common floor at the moment,” the computer replies and Steve walks back into the elevator.
Allen smiles at the quip and rolls his eyes. "Lucky for you, I got you a Pike Place Roast," he says, raising the Starbucks cup and Rhodey feels like he can see the light.
"Yeah. For Cap. Everyone at the Pentagon was talking about it the first week. That was a few months ago, I'd just come back for a report," Rhodey explains.
“Alright, let’s see who’s next— Virginia?” Tony asks, wrinkling his forehead at the light yellow folder. At the end of the room a young woman, dressed in a black dress skirt and blazer walks inside without a sound. “What kind of name is Virginia?” Tony starts saying, unaware of the new presence.
He stops and breathes and then he notices it, faintly in the back of his mind like a far, distant place. He’s in a New York street.
“You think I'm not?” Tony retorts, turning to him. “Why did Fury call us and why now? Why not before? What isn't he telling us? I can't do the equation unless I have all the variables,” he rhetorically asks.
He gives her a look and smiles. It had been an eternity for her, but she still knew him, could still read him like an open book. "I really, really missed you," Steve says, grabbing her hand again, the golden ring shining on her finger.
“Sure, but can’t make any promises on the latter,” he says, grabbing the bag he got and taking it to the kitchen. Jarvis is nowhere in sight so Tony just goes, opens the bottle of scotch and takes one big sip before going to his father’s office.
Tony changes the face of Stark Industries in the blink of an eye; stepping out of Howard’s ever-present shadow and successfully making a legacy of his own. By the time 9/11 happens, Tony’s building weapons for nearly all the branches of the U.S. military. And if Rhodey’s division gets a tiny preference, nobody complains out loud.
When he turns back to face Natasha, she's giving him one of those cryptic, devious looks* of her. "You're a terrible liar," Natasha says, the corner of her mouth drawn up.
“I'll continue to run variations on the interface,” JARVIS says. “But you should probably prepare for your guests. I'll notify you if there are any developments,” the AI adds.
'Hey, so, I have to catch and probably kill your soulmate's best friend,' is not something one casually mentions. Especially when Rhodey's not even sure about the whole plan itself.
“Yeah, that, sure, but I was gonna say, it’s—it’s a guy’s name,” Álvarez states, his face looking something between embarrassed and amused.
One of the targets starts shooting so he jumps back to the truck and rides on the front while they make the car lose its balance and flip in the air.
He puts his flying suit, with his brand new Second Lieutenant insignia, in his bag. And with a big smile on his face, he takes the flight to Pueblo, Colorado.
She smiles at Steve as she walks over the table by the couch to grab her phone. “Hello, penguin,” Peggy greets, with a smile on her face. But as she hears on, the smile erases. “Turn on the T.V.,” she tells Steve, her eyes wide.
Thor keeps laughing. They've been discussing this for fifteen minutes now. "Please, be my guest," Thor says, pointing at the hammer, lying on the table.
Tony takes a quick gulp of water and sits upright. "Alright— uhm, I didn't mean to sound like I just did, it's just— I thought, you know— you're from the forties, I mean. I've had discussions about this with people from
“Ain’t nothing respectable about being a homosexual,” Andrews adds, but Rhodey’s heard this enough times to be sick of it.
HI, I'M BACK. Sorry, it took me forever, I just had to do a whole introspection of how I wanted this very special, particular moment to go. Listen: this very chapter is one of the first few scenes I pictured before I sat down to write this fic altogether, so, yeah. I had to rewrite it a lot, until I was satisfied with what I had.
Back then, Rhodey felt his stomach sink hard just in sympathy. He’s lived enough discrimination as it is. Who the fuck cares who you love? Biology certainly didn’t and God sure as hell didn’t either.
Dayana nods brightly and moves her fingers to her keyboard. “Sure thing. What’s the name of the engineer?”
It's not by any measure the worst catastrophe the Avengers have been at the center of. Hell, any day less than thirty casualties would be a good day.
“Yeah, I could have my own name on my wrist,” he jokes, a devilish grin on his face. All he hears is an exasperated ‘
"I kinda put that together," Sam says, still a little out of breath. "Must have freaked you out, coming home after the whole defrosting thing," he comments.
“Okay, so, it’s Monday? That is good to know, I will plan my toga party accordingly,” he adds and feels a certain kind of pleasure when his father rolls his eyes. “Can you do
He can see everyone laughing and dancing and eating and having not a single care in the world while he's there, disturbed and in pain.
And it's not that he felt like a virgin, he knew damn well how all of this felt before—in theory. But none of the women he'd been with before were as shameless as the man that was destined to him from day one. None of them felt like Tony, none of them pressed and moved against him with perfect sync, measuring just how much pleasure he could apply before Steve made a fool of himself again.
He knows it makes no sense how, but he can feel it in his bones. He can even taste champagne on his tongue.
"Right there's fine," Tony says, his finger up. "You're not the Mandarin, are you? Are you?" he says, his faceplate up.
Rhodey rolls his eyes and takes them. The next morning, he’s giving Tony another big hug at the airport, then he’s arriving at the Philadelphia International Airport and taking a cab back home.
“Is it better to be feared or respected?” he begins, all rehearsed. “And I say, is it too much to ask for both?” he adds smugly, a few officers behind Rhodey let out a light chuckle.
Rhodey turns from Ross to him and sees Yu holding an open file with redacted encryption and a picture Rhodey can't really make out.
"Do me a favor," Fury calls from the back and Tony startles in his spot just a little. The rest of him is just annoyed. "Try not to bring it to life," Fury adds.
Rhodey moves his chin to one side. "That's the thing— I know how crazy this sounds but," he says then moves one shoulder up. "I don't think there's anything to be afraid of," Rhodey finishes, completely realizing his state of mind in this.
“It’s better if you’re here,” Tony mutters and reaches out his hand for Rhodey to take it, hold it, just as the doctor is looking at his wounds, and then lets Tony squeeze as hard as he can when they move his shoulder back to its place.
“That’s his M.O., isn't it? I mean, what are we, a team?” Bruce cuts in, his arms crossed. “No, no, no. We're a chemical mixture that makes chaos. We're— we're a time bomb,” he adds, his back muscles looking stiff.
But before he can notice, one of the leaders appears at Steve’s back and Tony doesn’t even get time to blink before the alien drives his spear through Steve’s chest.
Tony blinks in near terror. "On the other hand, Barton's really funny, so you must never get bored," he says, smiling a fake smile.
“Hey, dude, it’s alright. We’re all nervous, too,” Álvarez tries, being sympathetic. Rhodey scoffs a fake chuckle for his benefit and listens to him go into the bathroom, minding his own damn business.
“So I kissed a guy last night,” he says, almost like he's yawning. Like it's not a bad thing, because it isn’t a bad thing.
He makes the mistake of closing his eyes for longer than a millisecond and immediately he sees it, the massive universe in all its threatening darkness.
*pretends like I wasn't gone for ages* Hello, people, I hope everything's good. A few things to note about this one:
Him. His past self. The man he was before becoming just a carcass, a shell, a container of anything his holders wished to put in for them.
Bruce looks back at Clint lying on the table before giving Natasha a tiny smile, but his eyes aren’t conveying happiness. “You know, sometimes exactly what I want to hear isn't exactly what I want to hear,” he says, with a bitter laugh.
Rhodey turns back to him and nods. "The fall of SHIELD. Pretty terrible stuff," Rhodey says, briefly summarizing what he just barely had time to digest minutes ago.
"We're getting access denied on every basic information streams," Tony hears Natasha tell someone through the computer.
It’s just about all the reassurance Steve needs before he pushes himself against Tony again, burying him into the mattress with the force of his kiss.
Tony's easy, friendly grin vanishes. Instead he's left in a numb-mind surprise and Steve wants to take it back and run in shame.
“Yeah, cheese clown. I'm going to ditch these clowns; I'll see you up on the roof in five minutes,” Tony says, coming out. “I'm just going to try to get my beef wet real quick. You know what I'm talkin' about?”
“Why do you say that like it’s a date with the electric chair?” he mutters, dropping into his chair behind his desk.
"I mean someone more powerful than me," Nick warned before he moved away from standing between them.
He feels cold and he smells rust; he's holding onto something for dear life but he loses that fight.
“Well, Thor left the compound and I figured if I didn’t do it now, it would’ve taken me forever and you sounded like you really needed me when we spoke a few days ago,” Tony says.
"I'm not gonna fight you," the man says, letting his shield fall through a broken window into the water below. "You're my friend," he adds and his blue eyes lock on his.
"Are you kidding me? No, no. You must eat, I'll leave now—" he begins to say and move towards the door but Tony chuckles and stops him.
Steve takes that well enough and smiles. Tony leaves before he gets far too used to Steve’s soft morning eyes.
Tony wets his lips and looks behind him. At least Bruce has finally stopped whimpering. "Everyone's— we took a hit. We'll shake it off," Tony says.
She bent down to take a closer look at Jarvis, her eyes gleaming in the dancing light. It unnerved Steve that he couldn’t see her hands. There was something fishy going on with her. He wanted her gone. Tony had left through the black door, but he hadn’t gone to see her, and now she was here. Had she seen him fly away? Had she decided to take advantage of the fact that he wasn’t home? But why would she want to enter the castle while he wasn’t here?
, Steve, and I couldn’t handle it. I could barely handle it when I read about it in the aftermath, and I don’t want to know how bad it was to live through it. I don’t even know if I would want these memories back, Steve, because I think it would break me irrevocably. And I can’t say why I did what I did during the war, but I know I did it because I thought it was the best way to protect all of you, to protect you, Steve. And I failed to protect you, and then I—then I practically killed myself.”
“She did this to taunt me. I know it. I bet she’s laughing right now, laughing at my stupidity. How could I have forgotten? How could I?”
In the end, it’s Gretl that finds him. She’s going to have her baby soon, she says. They won’t make it to the hospital, she says. It’s just like being stranded on top of a mountain, she says. But there won’t be any rescue.
Stark was already walking into the forest, but he stopped when he saw that Steve wasn’t catching up. He waited until Steve was walking alongside with him to continue. After a short walk, they arrived at the village. It was picturesque, the small houses painted in pale but cosy colours. Stark’s palms were glowing blue, he was most likely searching for the magic source of the spell.
It’s freeing, to lay all the cards on the table. He can’t let Steve down more than he already has, and now at least Steve will know what he thinks.
Steve’s chest constricted at the words. Stark couldn’t know who he really was, he would be angry or disappointed because of Steve’s earlier dismissal, maybe he’d kill him—oh God. That night, Stark was planning to seduce Steve, wasn’t he? Steve had been right in his suspicion, after all. He was lucky he’d refused, because he’d be a heartless corpse by now if he’d taken Stark up on that offer.
He can’t set a timer. It’s not a problem. He has the command line ready, he just needs to hit enter and his heart will beat again. He just needs a thought. Even if unconsciousness comes swiftly, he’ll have the time to enter the command.
When Stark had come back that evening, Steve had told him about it and apologised (he’d thought that it was better to tell Stark than have Stark discover it on his own). But Stark had told him that it was fine, that he knew the girl’s grandmother, and always gave her a discount. A
Tony hopes that Steve will let him talk, this time. He shuts down his suits, all his safety measures. Steve should be here any second now. Tony sits himself on the ground, making himself as non-threatening as possible, and hopes Steve won’t kill him as soon as he enters the workshop. The door is open, the lights are on.
He wouldn’t stand a chance against the Hulk; or Thor. He knows when he’s outclassed. The Hulk would smell his intent from a mile away, and only one of them is indestructible. As for Thor, well, Tony isn’t arrogant enough to think he can win a fight against a thousand-year-old warrior god.
After coming back to see the bathroom cleaned, Stark huffed and grumbled a bit, but congratulated Steve on a job well done. He forbade him from entering the room with the battered door and gleaming handle, saying something about his workshop being off-limits. Steve was just glad he had one less room to clean, even if his curiosity only got worse. The fear of discovering something horrible in there still won out. For now.
“Now that I think of it, you never told me how exactly this half came here. You were trying to cast the spell, weren’t you? Don’t you know that John Donne’s poems are dangerous?”
More beautiful, too. His new hair colour suited him even better than the colour he’d had before. It added a touch of lightness, almost. His eyes were the same as always, though. Hard behind a gentle exterior. Steve wondered what Stark was thinking.
When Tony was nothing more than a feathery hull to contain his magic, when the air around him was crackling with energy, Steve dived to the side, and Tony burst apart.
The tension in the room isn’t as thick anymore. Steve takes a step back, and waves Tony up, eyes steely and body tense.
He hadn’t opened the wrong door, had he? He closed it, looked behind him at Jarvis, then opened the door again. The same street was there, packed with people milling around in the early morning sun. If he listened intently, he could hear the screaming of seagulls. He was at a port, then. He took a careful step outside, and when nothing happened, he walked out, closing the door behind him.
He can’t help himself. He’s so desperate for any kind of contact that he’s entertaining his own delusions.
“No, don’t worry, my home is your home, captain. Next time you want to fly a little, ask me, though. I don’t like letting people into my workshop unsupervised.”
Jarvis was sleeping too. Steve debated on telling him where he was going, since the fire demon had been distraught the last time Steve had left without an explanation. But Jarvis needed the rest, after moving the castle, and reminiscing about his past life. Steve padded over to the door, turned the circle to red, and walked out.
No trees, barely enough grass to cushion the hard edges of the pebbles and rocks littering the hillside. All he could see, in the dim twilight, was acres and acres of grass, no caves or bigger boulders to hide under.
And he needed to know if he could save his heart. God, there might be a cure for his heart condition. Nothing was more important than that, right this moment. The rest could wait. He ignored Cap’s tentative step forward and took Stark aside and whispered urgently:
