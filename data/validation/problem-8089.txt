“You’re going to ruin your appetite,” Tony tells her.
“Thank you, I will let him know.” Tony steps in closer, his demeanor turning somber. “Why didn’t you call me?”
Be sure you’re home in time for breakfast.
Tony holds his hand up. “Just don’t let it happen again, Kate. You of all people should know what I’ve been dealing with these past couple of weeks.”
Richards maintains his quiet, arrogant reserve; Hill is polite but humorless, and Bruce suspects that she’s not entirely happy to be here. It must have been the call he made to Nick Fury the previous day. Maria Hill is not the type of person who is fond of being on a leash. That might be a problem for them in the near future, most especially when the budget war reaches its climax come September, but right now it’s a necessary risk.
And that was only a little bit after midnight
Your nest will be ready for you in the rec room as always, Uncle Clint.
Tony breaks into a smile. “You never cease to amaze me with your powers, Murdock.”
“What is this, a sleepover club? Am I supposed to share my deepest, darkest secret with you?” Natasha asks, her brows furrowing.
“Tell me about it,” Tony says with a snort.
“Which is basically everyday of my sordid existence. Well then.” He sits down and opens the files set aside for him. “Shall we begin?”
Natasha ignores Clint’s whining. “You’re going to have to talk to T’Challa, Tony.”
He saw her fall and caught her just before her head could hit the ground.
“And you think that’s me?”
The first word out of Steve’s mouth is soft and a little tender: “Tony.”
“I just want a fair fight in the House, that’s all,” he says sweetly.
“Did you get to talk to him?” Jane asks.
It's easy enough to hate those from across the aisle, but no one ever told them that it was bad news to fall in love with the enemy.
“And yet you’re making grilled cheese sandwiches for us.”
Steve inspects the item, slightly confused. “What’s thi—oh my god.” The gadget lights up. “Tony, is this a phone?”
Sharon shrugs. “Why would I be? You
“They’ll be calling it soon. We’re looking at more or less 250 seats. That should keep the Republicans in line, don’t you think?” Natasha asks, her voice dripping with Machiavellian undertones.
“What time is it, Foggy?” he asks his partner.
to help the homeless shelter get back on its feet. And this isn’t the first time your company has done this. May I remind you about the halfway house in Atlanta, or the LGBT help center in Miami? You sit there and talk about social responsibility—well, social responsibility isn’t about doing what’s legal, Messrs. Odinson, it’s about doing what’s right.”
“I am also present and voting, and concur with Miss Potts,” says Thor. “But it is early yet—things may pick up soon.”
“Obie,” she greets him in a mixture of boredom and disgust. “I’m surprised to see you here.”
he thinks,
Steve doesn’t let her finish. It’s clear that he is eager to move on. “I fully agree with the Speaker of the House.” He turns to Tony, his expression softer. “Are you up for this?” His tone is light and a little too personal for a meeting in the Roosevelt room.
Tony blinks, as if processing what Steve had just said. “I’m just a guy who likes to tinker,” he replies slowly.
The President sighs, and it’s a sigh that sounds a lot like acceptance. Of what precisely, Tony doesn’t know. “Talking to you without his consent. It’s not a very presidential thing to do, keeping your staff in the dark about important matters, but desperate times call for desperate measures.”
Tony takes a deep breath. “As ready as I’ll ever be.”
—being in this room, Tony’s place of worship—is the invitation he hadn’t known he had wanted.
Foggy nods.
“Yes, sir.”
She’s known Tony for half her life, attached to his hip as his girlfriend for five of that, yet somehow she still doesn’t completely
“It was really nice seeing you, America,” Kate admits as she puts on her scarf and turns around to leave. “I’ve missed you, you know.”
Matt chuckles. “One is never sure about women like her.” He pauses. Then, “She’s here.”
“So, why’s he here then?”
Thor grins like a child doing trick or treat and bows to Kate. “Thank you, milady.”
He smiles sadly. “For once, someone actually deserves you, Pepper Potts.”
“You know better than to keep me waiting, Stark.”
“Why do you think I’m here? Look, I don’t claim to have a monopoly on knowing what's best for this country. President Rogers and I may be with different parties, but that doesn’t mean we can’t work together. This shutdown is all the more proof that we are willing to go beyond party lines to solve this country’s problems,” Tony declares with the finesse and arrogance of a confident statesman.
That night, he dreams of blonde hair, azure eyes and the smell of old books.
“For now. Give me a couple of years, maybe. Having a full time job doesn’t give me enough time for my hobbies,” Tony jokes.
That morning, while the entire household was waking up, Loki had barged in the Odinson residence unannounced, prompting a very tense verbal exchange between him and Thor that could have easily turned violent.
“Cassie, I raised you since you were five. When I say you’re going to ruin your appetite, I know from experience that you’re definitely going to ruin your appetite,” Tony contends, his tone casual.
Kate’s eyes widen. “
“Someone cover me,” he tells his team. “I don’t want anyone interrupting us while I’m talking to him.”
“Do we know what was written on the customs docket?” Wade questions from the other end of the room.
“Geoffrey Wilder was Chief Justice until he died at ninety-five, and Irani Rael literally waited for death to come knocking at her door before handing in her notice, so to speak,” Phil replies. “So yes, under normal circumstances, Justice Pierce would be too young to retire.”
He laughs despite the fact that they’re in the middle of an argument. “No, not that, although that’s also true. I meant the other thing, when you realized how hard this job really is and you started to become jaded and disillusioned about our work. Remember that?”
attractive like this, Steve can’t help but notice. But he dismisses that thought as quickly as it had come to him.
“He was born,” Cassie teases, which earns an even bigger laugh from Steve.
“Contraceptives,” Pepper admits almost painfully. “They said religious institutions should not be forced by law to provide free contraceptives as part of employee health plans.”
Bruce takes a moment to reflect on it. “I’d say trust your gut, but also remember that Stark doesn’t like it when he’s backed up in a corner. As with the rest of his team. So try not to push him too hard, sir, or we may end up alienating both the Speaker and the most influential people in the Democratic Party.”
“Hey, Miss USA!” Kate calls out.
Fury sighs. He hates it when Natasha has the last word. He hates it even more when she’s right. He shakes his head. He’s going to need to make some very difficult and possibly painful calls. He takes out his phone.
“Goes without saying, Stinger.” He breaks the hug with a kiss on top of her head. “What’s cooking?”
And Tony, despite all that he had seen and heard in the past twenty years in American politics, asks Steve to do something that he has never asked anyone to do before.
Natasha raises an eyebrow and her eyes twinkle mischievously. “Oh, you bet, Senator.”
Thor shakes his head and sighs dejectedly. “Loki and I are not on good terms. It will not be that simple.”
And that’s how their version of the Art of War starts.
“Has Barton given a report back from his talk at our friend in Hoover?” Natasha asks.
Steve finally stands up. “Come here,” he tells Sharon, inviting her into a hug. Sharon accepts easily. “Thank you,” he tells her softly.
He truly doesn’t know what to expect. He doesn’t know how to go about this, either. It’s one thing to see Steve with all those people around them. It’s another to meet with him one-on-one. There is no protocol to follow for the latter.
Kate throws her hands in the air, giving up. “It’s your show now.” And leaves the office.
Steve laughs as she closes the door behind her.
(White House/West Wing AU)
“It’s an honor to meet you, Mr. President.”
“It’s neither youth nor being naïve. I have faith in the goodness of people, especially in those who have sworn to serve this country,” Steve defends. It may be a flimsy argument, but it doesn’t mean it isn’t true.
"Kate, I see you've gotten yourself a new pet while I was away." Kate looks up, placing her tablet beside the keyboard. She gives Tony a challenging smirk.
Right. The 14
Steve rubs his temples, his head suddenly aching. “I’m not happy about this, Tony. We’re going to discuss this, and we’re not doing it over the phone.” He takes a deep breath. “I’m going to ask my staff to schedule a meeting with you
Phil nods in agreement. “Stark is crazy, but he’s not stupid. And he’s also a pretty fair-minded guy. He’ll see the merits of shutting down the government.”
“That’s not very honorable at all,” Janet comments.
Steve gapes as he inspects it. “My god, Tony, this is amazing.”
Wow, 8 days! Not bad, right? Unfortunately, however, one of us will be away for a UN Convention and we probably won't be able to update in the next three weeks. We do have some surprises in store for you to tide you over during the wait, so check out
Tony laughs, hiding the melancholy simmering underneath the surface. “It’s alright, Pep. I’m looking forward to a quiet weekend. Haven’t had that in a while since…you know.”
“What’s this about?” Jane asks, resigned to the fact that she actually has to entertain Darcy.
“And Richard Parker?” Pepper reminds the group.
“Excuse me?” Jane called out. The whole auditorium turned to her. “Was it corporate social responsibility when you bought the land beneath a homeless shelter in Brooklyn and built an apartment building on it without so much as thinking about where all those people would go?”
With Kate on board, Tony gets to relax a little, but he cannot rest on his laurels. Each day that passes is a day closer to the deadline. Congress, especially the House, is in complete disarray. His team is on battle mode, absolutely unmerciful and bloodthirsty. Honestly, he will never be prouder of his party than when Pepper and Wade go head to head with Hill and her second-in-command at the House, Congressman Barnes. He’s sure Natasha is working her magic behind the scenes, and he’s almost certain that in some way or another, she’s working with Fury to put Hill and her lackeys in place.
Pepper laughs. “You’re right at that.” She pulls him closer. “Look, Tony, it’s been a hell of a year for us. We lost the White House, we lost the Senate, but then we won the House. You were elected Speaker and suddenly there was this huge weight put on your shoulders because people expect you to go to hell and back for them. I can’t even begin to imagine how isolating that must be.” She sighs. “He’s probably the only person in the world right now who truly understands what that feels like, and I can’t begrudge you of that kind of solace when you’re doing so much for this country.”
“On a scale of Natasha’s heart to Kate’s Star Wars collection, what’s your temperature on the idea of having Thanksgiving dinner at the White House?”
As always, comments give me life and help me write, so please do drop a word!
“And at this point, they hadn’t asked Parker to sign the contract or a non-disclosure agreement prior to revealing that they had vibranium,” Foggy goes on to say.
“That’s because we let Clint and the rest of the Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee handle it,” Tony says indifferently. “The Republicans wanted Loki, naturally. Our pick, Jennifer Walters, was too liberal for them, to no one’s surprise. The committee settled on Hogarth—unpredictable at times, but moderate enough for both sides. So ‘want’ would be too strong a word. We’re just…able to live with it.”
Tony laughs in disbelief. “I envy you. Your youth and naiveté has yet to be swallowed by this monster that we call a job."
She chuckles. “Have to keep things interesting so you don’t replace me for a newer model.”
“Alright then. Happy Thanksgiving, Tony.” She gives him a peck on the cheek and walks away.
Matt gives him a small, knowing smile. “Did anyone ever tell you never to make bet with a blind man?”
Tony, being Tony, answers Steve’s question with this: “Faith, trust, and pixie dust.”
(White House/West Wing AU)
“This is dangerous,” Jessica cautions. “If we’re being watched, then sure as hell all eyes will be on all of you during that dinner.”
Clint arrives at Tony’s house twenty minutes past six. Clint is always the first to arrive—pre-session quickie, as dubbed by Darcy. Consequently, it has encouraged numerous catcalls (ahem, Wade) and innuendos (Tony), but the truth is that Clint and Tony are surprisingly great friends.
“That sounds just like my Darcy,” Anne says proudly. Then, “You think they’re serious?” she probes cautiously.
Tony laughs. “We both know very well that it’s not, Murdock.”
I hope you guys enjoy this chapter, and remember to keep that feedback coming along! It's what keeps us going. :)
He picks up the phone before he can change his mind. “Congressman!” Steve greets as lively and as at ease as possible. He doesn’t want this phone call to be enveloped in awkwardness.
“Hm?”
Steve laughs softly. “Ah, so now I’m starting to see the true colors of the infamous Tony Stark? I’ll take your word for it. Apology accepted.” He takes a moment. “This brand of politics is unmerciful. We didn’t have this kind of ruthlessness when I was in the Senate.”
Clint thinks maybe this is a big red flag for him to not ask what he’s about to ask, but he closes his eyes and steels himself as Natasha walks out of the bathroom, all prim and austere. Her heels clack-clack-clack on the marble floor as she makes her way closer and stands next to him in front of the floor-length mirror, a small smirk already in place on her face.
We can stop the recording now, it’s alright.
Clint continues. “I didn’t see the text until later—I was already in a meeting with Justice Maximoff. But it was unnecessary, since Wanda herself said that
He jolts out of his reverie and turns to face the door. It’s Bruce, his campaign manager, and will most likely be the White House Chief of Staff. Steve laughs softly at his usage of the new title. “I’m having a hard time getting used to being called that.”
I’m not forcing you to do anything you don’t want to do.
“Doesn’t matter anymore. What matters now is what we do with the information that we have,” Natasha says, impatient. “I’m thinking weapons.”
He steps out of his office. True to her word, Darcy hands him a folder. The paperwork looks thin enough, thank god. Darcy herself looks ready to leave, with her desk clean and a new coat of lipstick on her lips. The only thing left is her computer, which had several files open. Clint raises his eyebrow.
“So these are not normal circumstances then—out of the ordinary,” Steve murmurs while rereading the letter.
Tony flops on the couch, stretches, and crosses his legs on the coffee table. “Sent by a former professor in MIT who is part of the first working group.”
“We’re currently in the Yellow Oval Room for the informal reception. Tony is currently chatting away with both Presidents. But I do think that the Chief of Protocol will be here to call us down very soon,” Rumiko reports. “At the moment, I don’t see anyone worth mentioning, but I’ll keep you posted.” A beat. “You should pursue Killian, though. I’ve never known him to be political, so it’s very strange that he’s here.”
Tony shrugs. “Well, he’s definitely on the schedule now.”
Tony shrugs, smiling. “Blame Natasha.”
“And yet you’re not willing to share information with me.”
Again, please drop a word of encouragement at the comments section. Better yet, tell me what you think! I love it when you guys are so enthusiastic about these lovely characters.
When Kate rings the doorbell to Clint’s apartment, there is no answer at first. She peeks through the windows and sees that there is no movement in the darkness. It could be possible that he isn’t at home, but no one, not even the team, has actually seen him outside of work for a while now. She rings the doorbell again. She knows that Clint needs more than a friend after the events of the past few months—even if he doesn’t know it or won’t admit it, he needs his best friend, and Kate has been a shitty one of late. She plans to make it up to him.
“I don’t understand.” Thor rubs his temples, clearly befuddled with the facts that Foggy had presented them. “Why would they divulge such sensitive information without the insurance of a signed legal document?”
“Right,” Kate replies with a laugh. “Nah. My father has too much pride to do that. And after all these years, I think he has accepted the fact that I can never be the woman he wants me to be. He has my older sister for that, anyway.”
And well, if Tony is honest with himself, Steve Rogers is not
“What ‘this’ are you talking about, Clint?” Natasha scoffs, offers up a fond smile over her shoulder as she locks her earring in place.
“I should be asking you that question.”
“How?” Thor asks.
He gives her a small, grateful smile. “You’re really something, you know that?”
She raises an eyebrow, interested. “Do we really?”
They catch up first—Carol and Rhodey updating Tony about what they’ve been up to, and Tony doing the same with all the theatrics that only he can deliver. It’s fun, light, and normal, and when their food arrives, Tony isn’t sure if he’s ready to talk business just yet. God knows that they don’t have much of these moments to go around.
Steve laughs. “They’re cute.”
stole breakthrough medical technology from Fujikawa Technologies and attempted to weaponize it. We won that patent lawsuit, Obie. We won it in the district courts, we won it in the appellate courts, and if you really can’t get over it and take it to the Supreme Court, we’re going to win that too.”
Steve nods, laughing breathily. “Yeah, yeah. I’m sorry, I just…”
Pepper arrives at the café promptly, as everyone else is wont to do when meeting Natasha. The staff greets her with great familiarity—female Democrats are frequent customers of this particular restaurant, so it’s not really surprising. She’s lead to their usual table in the patio, sits down, orders her usual, and waits patiently for her party’s fearless National Chair.
Jane looked at him straight in the eye. “It’s not a long way when the top one percent—that’s you, Mr. Odinson—continues to exploit the bottom 99 percent—that’s all those homeless people, in case you didn’t know—to enrich themselves.”
he’s seen it somewhere before—maybe in a briefing document, or a photo from the DOD?—and his subconscious will keep bugging him about it until he figures out where he first encountered it.
When their laughter dies down, the line goes quiet for a few moments.
“Understatement of the century,” Steve mutters under his breath, the technology clearly overwhelming him.
“After more than a decade of working as my assistant, you should know the answer to that question.”
“Marriage,” Tony says with a chuckle. “Another dying institution.”
“As soon as humanly possible,” Matt responds.
This is an uncomfortable chair.
“Oh God, I feel like I’m eighteen again, and Obadiah’s trying his best to convince me not to drop out of MIT and transfer to Stanford. ‘Boy, do you know what you’re getting yourself into?’” he mimics with a look of disgust. “For the love of God, Kate, when did I ever make wrong judgments about these things? No, really, tell me because I’m standing in the Speaker’s office with no recollection whatsoever of ever getting here.”
She kisses his cheek and wipes off the lipstick smudge with her thumb. “You’re a very sweet and generous man, Tony Stark. I hope, for your sake, that he doesn’t break your heart.”
“I had my reasons, Steve,” Tony says quietly.
And America did. After more than a year of wooing, Rogers finally agreed to join the race for the White House and won, of course. He was the perfect candidate—smart, charismatic, honest, genuine, among many other things. People like Steve Rogers make Nick Fury’s life easier.
“Maybe we do.”
“Hello?” Happy answers, and he heads outside of the bedroom, unaware that Pepper had also woken up to the call.
“So,” Clint cuts in. “Next steps, anyone?”
So yes, he is a little intimidated, but he’s Tony Stark. He’ll die before he ever admits to anyone that he gets intimidated. He’ll also die before he ever admits to anyone that he took special care getting ready for this meeting. Even JARVIS was mocking him without being too obvious about it. Tony didn’t even berate his AI for it, to his surprise. He blames all of this being out of character on the current circumstances, since a federal shutdown is
Jane and Thor look at each other, confusion and disquiet clear on their faces. “Did he say why my brother is here?” Thor asks carefully.
It’s seven minutes past three in the afternoon, and Steve’s stomach is grumbling. He hadn’t even noticed that they had been working for more than four hours without food. For someone with his metabolism, that just simply won’t do, and he’s sure Tony’s starving as well.
Tony suddenly stands at attention. “Sorry, Nat.”
Once again, I really appreciate your comments! Your kind words have kept me going and I'd be very happy if you could keep sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you so much for sticking with this story all these years!
The door swings open and Tony barges in, smoothly evading a bodily collision with the professor. “A good morning to you,” Scott greets him.
“I have no problem with that. Besides, photographers will be watching the colonnade, so it will be good publicity,” Tony tells him casually.
But he can see that the road is long and arduous, and it starts with Tony and getting the budget off their backs.
September 30, 2037
were the one who ordered me to come here, Steve. I asked you to trust me and you demanded that I come here like a loyal servant.” Tony holds his steely gaze, unbowed. He’s tired of it all—tired of the games, tired of Steve ordering him to do things just because he can. If all these months had been a ruse, then he fell for it hook, line and sinker, didn’t he?
“Yes,” he says, never missing a beat. “Although let me clarify that: Republicans
Wade whistles. “Hill gone wild.”
“You sure do know how to dig your own grave, Tony Stark.” She doesn’t look up at him once, her tone flat and neutral.
“It just wasn’t meant to be,” Bucky finally says, resignation clear in his voice.
No, I’m not. I’m making a point.
, we had to put up with stolen glances and lovey-dovey stares for
“Waking up beside you everyday is enough.”
Steve’s smile widens. “You could come early in the afternoon, bring all your stuff, and we could cook in the kitchen.”
Scott smiles, admiring Tony’s staunch determination. “I’ll believe it when I see it, Stark.”
Steve shakes his head. “I don’t know what those numbers mean.”
The Democrats gather around in an uneven circle, animated by the astounding legal developments of the day, all thanks to Jessica Drew’s explosive press conference earlier that morning. The excited murmuring dies down when Natasha raises her hand, drawing everyone’s attention to her.
I learned with him,” Cassie interjects.
him, and Steve knows that
Tony shakes his head. “No.”
But despite that Matt goes with the one thing that’s never let him down before—his gut instinct. “The Pierce case.”
she thinks. Whenever he’s disquieted, Tony Stark hauls himself in his basement workshop and gets lost in his machines and programs, a temporary respite from the insanity of American politics. Even when he dropped out of MIT during his second year and transferred to Stanford, he never really left engineering and robots. It’s his home, Kate thinks. Whatever he does, wherever he goes, he will always go back to his machines.
Tony sighs and opens his arms wide in resignation. “Come here.”
The picture in his wallet is suddenly hot on his rear, and Peggy’s absence is all too palpable to him now. During the time he has known him, Bruce has never stepped out of line, but he has always called things as he saw them, and Steve’s never been good with hiding his emotions. He has always worn his heart on his sleeve, and he’s pretty damn sure that his yearning for Peggy’s presence is all too evident on his face. “Did you know that she was the one who convinced me to run? I didn’t want another term in the Senate, and when Fury came to me and asked me if I wanted to run for President, I was halfway out the door already. But Peggy was convinced that I’d make a good President, that it would be good for the party and the country. She died before I could make a decision.”
“Well then, what are you waiting for?”
“Why does he need to speak in code?”
Clint doesn’t quite know what to say to that.
Bruce rests an assuring hand on the President-elect’s tense shoulder. “You’ve done a magnificent thing. You’ve inspired crowds, had them chant your name with loud voice, and lifted them off their feet. You won the presidency against all odds. The road ahead will be long and difficult, but I’ll bet my life that Peggy will be with you every step of the way. And if she could, she’d be kicking your ass right now for thinking all these pessimistic thoughts.”
He hasn’t had the chance to do any of that recently, and the worst of it all is that he misses his team. Sure, he sees them regularly inside and outside of the Capitol, but because of everything that’s currently on everybody’s plates, they hardly have any time to be actual friends. He hasn’t even had so much as an after-work drink (non-alcoholic for him, of course) with Clint since Loki decided to stroll back into DC and throw their lives into chaos.
He’s had it since last night, since realizing that he had been unreasonable with Tony and used his power and position to demand something that he probably did not have any right to. The way he’d phrased it—he
“The President is the only person I can’t control in the party, Natasha. You of all people should know that.” He sits back and crosses his arms. “And you’re the one to talk. You can’t control your iron boy, either.”
It's been a year, I know. In my defense, I was in grad school, where I had a million different things going on. But now I'm all done and settled into a new job, I'm trying to be more diligent about this...which is why this update is the longest one I've probably ever written.
The Executive Residence is on the second floor of the White House, and there is small kitchen beside the President’s dining room for his personal use. It’s one of Steve’s favorite rooms in the residence because it reminds him so much of the New Hampshire kitchen where he spent much of his time with his Aunt Hannah. She taught him how to cook, and cooking in this small kitchen—its size completely in contrast to the palatial rooms of the White House—has become a destressor for him of sorts.
“I feel very overdressed now,” Tony says softly, hoping not to startle Steve.
“Phoenix is a long way off from Palo Alto,” Steve notes.
“Tony, I know you have a close relationship with Rogers,” Natasha starts. “But we do what we have to do. At some point he’s going to find out what we’ve been up to, whether it be from his side of the aisle or ours. You’re going to have to figure out which one is the path of least resistance.”
Rhodey, however, is more malleable to Tony’s goading—a product of their decades of friendship. “I’m sure you’re aware of confidentiality rules, Tony,” he warns his best friend, albeit gently.
Pepper answers by rolling her eyes. “And so will probably ‘that shit cray.’”
“I didn’t say that,” Steve answers.
Steve smiles at her, clearly delighted. “I’ll take what I can get.”
“You got it, boss.”
In hindsight, Tony was expecting this—he did spend an entire evening with Natasha discussing every possible outcome, after all—but nothing could have prepared him for the hurt brought about by the realization that his partnership with Steve was nothing more than a convenient arrangement. He had gravely miscalculated their relationship, and he had set himself up for the heartbreak of investing so much time, energy, and emotional capital in the wrong person.
Pepper dries her hands and gives her fiancé a peck on the lips. “Thanks, honey. I’ll make it up to you, I promise.”
Kate sighs, as if to give up. “I just—come back to us, alright? I know there is no other woman like Natasha out there but maybe you’ll find another great person to get to know and fall in love with. We need you—all of you, not some walking body that looks like you—back in action.”
“I appreciate you coming today. Please, have a seat,” he says, directing Tony to couches. “Do you want anything to drink?”
Also thanks to everyone who've commented and messaged me regarding the beta position that's open! I haven't decided yet because I've yet to organize myself, but I'll keep you all posted.
“Says the woman whose religion only apologized for sentencing Galileo to death for scientific truth four hundred and fifty years after the fact,” Pepper snaps. She knows better than to lose her temper in front of Maria Hill—the woman is too familiar with her buttons and knows exactly when to push them—but when it comes to women’s reproductive rights, they’re clearly on both ends of the spectrum, and Pepper, for the life of her, can’t imagine why any woman, let alone someone as strong and independent as Maria Hill, would stand for such misogynistic bullshit.
“Hoover’s here!” Clint exclaims, snapping the TV-induced trance occupying everyone in the room.
It’s Clint who is last to say his goodbyes. “You skipping town tonight?” Tony asks him.
“I do trust you, Tony, but I don’t know what to make of what you’re asking me to do. I don’t know if selling out my party-mates is the right thing to do here.” Steve is conflicted, torn between options.
“Just admit that you miss me, Uncle Tones, so we can do away with this charade.”
“We can provide that for her,” Bruce mentioned. “If she steps aside and let’s us do our jobs, of course.”
“I don't recall you ever contacting me in the middle of the night since, well, ever,” she points out.
“I’m a member of the Democratic Party—you tell me.”
“A temporary respite, my dear,” he says as he moves on top of her for a kiss. “A welcome respite.”
“Why don’t you three head on up,” Tony tells Jessica, Matt, and Foggy. “We’ll just be a few minutes. I need to discuss a few things regarding Congress with my team.”
Kate’s face lights up, Tony’s earlier misdemeanor forgotten as she sets down the papers on his desk. “The usual suspects? Are assistants allowed?” she asks suggestively.
“You’ve not yet given us probable cause to deem you as a threat to the President, ma’am. So you’re off the hook for now.”
“You would be if your callsign was Hawkeye.”
When he enters the Oval Office, Steve is leaning against the Resolute Desk, smiling as he watches Tony walk inside. He doesn’t say anything to welcome the Speaker of the House. It’s a little too awkward for Tony’s liking. He stands there like an idiot while the President is smiling at him, and yet no one is saying anything. He looks around, trying to ease the discomfort in the room. He notices the couches in the middle of the room and asks with hesitation, “Shouldn’t we…?”
He squeezes her right arm in an attempt to soothe her. “I’m sorry I involved you in all of this.”
“Trust goes both ways, Steve.”
Didn’t your read the e-mail?
Tony tilts his head, and breaks into a proud and knowing smile. “Smart girl.”
—for a meeting. Code green,” Natasha tells him.
“You don’t admire her, you’re obsessed with her—“
“Good, that means you don’t go home and I get to keep you.”
,” Steve tells him, ogling Tony from head to toe, running his hands on Tony’s chest. “Very formal and clean and just waiting to be…”
It’s been total chaos in the Lewis household. It reminds Clint of his own family, but their chaos was more of the violent, slightly criminal kind. He had a tough environment growing up—his parents were in and out of jail constantly, and his brother Barney had a lot of enemies. When he was old enough to understand what was happening around him, he knew that there was something more than the life that he was born into, and started to distance himself from his family’s shenanigans.
“But I am listening to you!"
Tony?
Pepper shakes her head. “It’s not that, I just…think he’s acting too independently from the team, if you understand what I mean?”
By the way, where’s the old people party at tonight?
is worth being like this.” Kate hopes she’s getting through to him.
Clint in his nest dead to the world.jpg
He takes a deep breath.
“I’ve been naughty and you’ve come to punish me,” Hill replies mockingly, disdain evident in her tone.
“And if you haven’t noticed, his name is never mentioned in the Pierce case,” Foggy adds.
“Is everything alright?” Sharon asks, concerned.
When Tony arrives at the bistro, Rhodey and Carol are already seated, sipping on their drinks and chatting away. He smiles to himself—he hasn’t seen his best friend and his girlfriend for about a month now, but it’s good to see them together, happy and relaxed. The years haven’t been easy for either him or Rhodey, but it’s good to know that at least one of them gets that coveted happy ending. If anyone deserves it, it’s Rhodey.
Tony raises an eyebrow. “Now where’s the fun in that?” and they say their goodbyes.
Pepper shakes her head. “No, it’s nothing like that, Tash. I just don’t like that he’s being a selfish bastard about all this.” She jabs angrily at her scrambled eggs. “It’s so frustrating. I just want to know what he’s up to so I can help him!”
“Don’t worry about it, I’ve taken up so much of your morning already. Thank you for taking my call.”
But that was until her laugh ended abruptly in the middle of Frigga’s story. “Jane?” his mother called out suddenly, worry evident in her voice. Thor turned to watch just as Jane crumpled to the ground, and caught her head just in time.
“Are you sure about that?” Wade asks her. “You know that woman hates you as much as she hates Tony.”
Well, he’s never backed down from a hard game, so what the hell, right? He decides to take a leap of faith.
(White House/West Wing AU)
“Seeing as everyone is here—colleagues, shall we start?” Thor booms.
And Jesus fucking Christ is she beautiful.
He has never wanted a drink more in his life.
Matt pats his shoulder. “It will all be worth it in the end, my friend.”
“What do you mean, ‘you knew it?’ How could you have possibly known?”
“Hell no,” Clint throws in, a little more animated than he was five minutes ago now that the warmth of the tea is permeating through his system. “They have the entire DOJ and the intelligence community at their disposal. We, on the other hand, only have people willing to commit felonies and a disembodied voice in your property on our side.”
“Still. Thank you.”
“Nothing, really. I just wanted to see if you were okay.”
Cassie shrugs. “Who said anything about denying it? I just meant that you were a huge nerd then, and still a huge nerd now.”
Clint stops the car some 60 feet from the entrance, where a man and a woman stand, guarding the opening to the inside of the warehouse. They both get out slowly and quietly, careful not to make any sudden movements to cause a commotion.
Clint is still reeling from Natasha—that won’t go away anytime soon, and he’ll have to face his feelings in the very near future. But at the very least, he and Kate are okay. They’re safe in the warmest, most intimate sense of the word. That’s definitely something to be thankful for.
She grins. “Really great. I mean, it’s not a walk in the park but I’m enjoying it a lot, and it’s a really good batch of students—great lab partners, study buddies, and all that.”
Thor quickly turns his attention to the two ladies. “Erik’s back?”
“Makes you wish you should have listened, huh?”
Kate falters for a bit, surprised at Tony’s response. After twelve years of working for Tony Stark, she has learned so much about his history, both public and private. She has discovered his true strengths and weaknesses, and things that he tends to hide from most people, even from those who know him best. Over the years, she has put together many of the pieces of the Tony Stark puzzle, but she’s far from reaching completion. This moment of distress is a new piece, and she can’t figure out its place in the big picture just yet.
He’s in the doorway between the terrace and the spacious living room, watching the people eat his food and drink his booze, and he actually could not be any happier to see about two dozen political staffers lose it a little. He thinks back on his life a little, on the path he’s chosen to take, the decisions he’s chosen to make, and tells himself that whatever shit he’s been through, it’s all been worth it. Despite the losses and the disappointments and the failures, it’s all been very, very worth it.
Steve puts his phone aside and buries his face into his hands. He knew going in that being the President of the United States was a mammoth of a job, but he underestimated the effort that he had to put into running a country. Steve has always been a hard worker, and he had always put his 100% into everything he ever had to do, but this job required everything of him, and more. He has always been more than willing to sacrifice himself for his country—he was in the Army after all—but he didn’t know that he had to sacrifice other people, too.
Tony sighs. “Are you heading to the White House to meet with Munroe?” he asks Peter.
Tony attempts to smile. “You know, that’s the same thing the President told me today.”
that smile many times over the phone. So yeah, maybe this is the Steve that he’s gotten to know over the past couple of months. He trusts this Steve, so Tony will also have to trust that he can play his part well.
Steve grins, wide and bright. “Glad to hear you say my name again.”
“Really, Cassie, you should stop swearing like a trucker,” Tony scolds with no gusto whatsoever.
Steve closes his eyes, thinks of Peggy and the pitter-patter of rain on the windowsills of their home. He realizes that although he still aches for Peggy, wants nothing more in this world that for her to be here again, he finally gets it. He may have had his uncertainties at the beginning, but he feels it seeping through his skin—this is
Pepper tilts her head, thoughtful and observant. “I’ve never seen you like this before”
“And you’re telling me you are?”
Tony hopes that this last-ditch effort to be genuine will turn the tide of this meeting.
Steve nods. “That would be the prudent course of action. And I’ll need to meet with the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee once they are informed.”
—Steve, what are you—Jesus Chr—hngggg—
Steve can feel the man at the other end of the line shuffle and try to regain himself. “I apologize.”
“We can put some feelers out, if it will ease your discomfort,” Bruce offers.
As usual, comments are greatly appreciated. Thanks for sticking around.
Tony does as he is told. “I assume the turkey is for tomorrow?”
“Jane Foster, a PhD student from the Astrophysics department. Three years ago, Asgard Realty bought an expanse of land in Brooklyn, a part of which had a homeless shelter on top of it. That shelter housed and fed more than five hundred homeless people daily. When the deal closed, so did the shelter. There was no effort from your company to relocate the shelter or to find an alternative so the organization that ran the shelter could continue to serve all those people.” Her words were sharp, and were said without any hesitation or fear whatsoever. They were directed straight at Odin whose brows were furrowed, a look Thor knew very well: displeased at being confronted.
“I like
“Well, that’s settled then,” Clint replies, and he forces a smile, the kind he reserves for the podiums and the campaigns on a bad day, the kind that he uses for cable television when he has to face a detractor. He knows she doesn’t buy it, but he doesn’t care, can’t bring himself to.
He raises his hands in the air in deference. “I apologize. I didn’t mean to overstep.”
Pep. He built top-of-the-line phones for me and my top guys. SHIELD Security wouldn’t be where it is today if it weren’t for him. I owe Tony a lot.” He puts bread in the toaster and hands Pepper the butter from the fridge, a knife, and a grapefruit on a small plate. “Besides, he’s third in line for the White House. He needs more than Kate as his security detail.”
Well, uh, Tony and Steve—
For a moment, Sharon’s eyes widen in surprise. Then she laughs softly. “That's it?”
Kate smiles back, wide and gleaming, and throws a kitchen towel at her girlfriend. “Idiot. Go take a shower.” Darcy laughs as she exits the kitchen, Kate shaking her head while preparing to cook breakfast for the two of them.
“I do not doubt either Erik or Darcy,” Thor interjects, supporting his wife.” If they say Loki is here, then I am certain of it as well.” There is finality in his voice, and the others do not hesitate to believe the both of them.
Steve blinks, wondering if he heard Tony right. “I’m sorry?”
Tony shrugs, but does as he’s told. Steve takes hold of his shoulders and guides Tony down until his head is resting on Steve’s lap. Tony adjusts his body and swings his legs on the cushions, so he’s now lying comfortably on the sofa. Steve starts running his fingers through Tony’s hair and rubs his temples in alternate patterns.
Inside is considerably warmer. He sheds his coat and places it in the closet. It is a testimony to how often he's been at Tony's when JARVIS doesn't startle him anymore.
Peter? Mia?
He’s had the same picture in his wallet since the last semester of his senior year at Georgetown. It is, predictably, of Peggy, taken during that unforgettable spring break in New Hampshire. While the rest of the senior class went to Miami, Santorini, or wherever rich kids usually spent their spring break, Steve and Peggy were holed up in Uncle’s Michael’s farm about an hour and a half away from Manchester, doing nothing but living the apple pie life. In the picture, Peggy is in the kitchen, covered in flour, icing, sugar, and god knows what else. She’s laughing and there had been pies strewn everywhere—they were (supposedly) pecan pies, Steve remembers vividly, his favorite—and none of them had been edible. Peggy’s never been a good cook or baker, but hey, it’s the thought that counts, right? In the end, they gave up, cleaned the kitchen and had Aunt Hannah bake, which was what they should have done in the first place.
And the rest, they say, is history.
“I’m afraid I can’t do that, Mr. President. Duty and protocol and…whatever, you get the point.”
She laughs. “I’d have to bill you if you really want to know.”
“Wow,” Scott says, still in disbelief. “I mean, we’ve known about this for a while, but to have it laid out on paper like this…”
,” she tells him matter-of-factly.
“And what did the President say?” Happy is clearly enthralled.
Steve smiles at him, and they finish the rest of their lunch in companionable silence.
“Is any of this public knowledge yet?” Tony asks.
“And miss all the fun? Please,” Jessica responds with a laugh.
“Isn’t that supposed to be my line?”
“Good. Then I want to have the meeting in his chambers at the Supreme Court, as a sign of respect. Tell Secret Service that I don’t want any attention drawn to my convoy.”
He doesn't miss a beat. “Tony Stark.”
When she doesn’t finish her thought, he urges her on. “What is it, Cass?”
“Ah,” Steve replies with some apprehension, not knowing how exactly pursue this conversation.
Dum Dum gives her a toothy smile through the rearview mirror as he drives slowly to exit the St. Regis driveway. “The Chairman contracted out SHIELD personnel for the event tonight due to security reasons, ma’am. I just happen to be assigned to the Speaker.”
“The thing with Pierce is insane, though.”
“Yes, of course. Hello.” Natasha politely shakes their hands. When she turns to Killian, she gives him a shy, flirtatious smile.
“What do you mean?”
Thor chuckles. “Pray tell, Mr. Speaker.”
“You’re so full of shit, Fury.” She throws a napkin at him and he fakes a dodge. They both laugh.
“I think she’s more concerned about containing the story rather than me getting my feelings hurt, if that’s what you’re asking,” Tony tells her with scoff.
Hill smirks, seemingly triumphant. “I think you know that your comfortable majority will never pass your Women’s Health Act with a school prayer amendment. That’s why you’re here trying to convince me to withdraw it.”
“Do you want a tour of the house?” Tony asks him tentatively.
“No, I—“ Tony gathers the rest of his belongings and heads back to the bed to give Steve a kiss. “I would have wanted to stay longer but I have to go take care of something. I’m really sorry.”
Kate gives her a warning look. “Let’s not go there, America.”
Pepper sits beside him and wraps an arm around his waist. “Oh, darling. I don’t think even you can stop a bullet train with your own bare hands. He’s a great leader and an even greater man. Ask Clint, he’ll back me up on this.”
“Then invite me to the embassy—”
“Let me get this straight.” Natasha gives Coulson and Fury a hard look. “You couldn’t get the information you wanted from your own people, so you decided to browbeat us into submission.” She laughs darkly. “Classy, very classy, Fury.”
“Am I allowed to ask who you’re talking about?” Steve asks carefully.
“Ooh, someone’s antsy,” Tony teases. “Do you need a drink?”
“Steve, please—“
He walks in the dining room about an hour later. Bruce is scanning the news on his phone while waiting, the breakfast spread all laid out on the table, and stands to greet Steve when he enters the room.
Tony smiles against her hair. “And you thought you’d do my AI a favor by washing the dishes?”
I’m the luckiest man in the world.
“What did Tony want?” Natasha asks, and Clint has to marvel at her ability to pretend that she didn’t just land a fucking spear through his chest ten minutes ago. He sighs, knows it will be a long, long ten minute drive, and floors the gas so he can get into his office and have Darcy batter his ego and then maybe ask her to buy him a cupcake or whatever. He is having a pretty bad day. He deserves a fucking cupcake.
“Were you ever going to tell me anything, or was that bit about the “big picture” just a ruse to keep me interested?” Steve asks, clearly irked at the circles he and Tony keep running in.
“So Richard is the reason why Pierce was caught,” Janet concludes.
After she the door of the bar closes behind her, Foggy tells Matt, “I wonder how she’s going to make our lives a living hell for the next year.”
Tony sighs, trying to put his words together. “I don’t appreciate being strong-armed and manipulated like that. I know I have a reputation of doing the very same in the Capitol, but I have never done that to you, and I would never.” He sighs, visibly tired of the mess they’re in. “Can we just…agree to trust each other from now on?”
So, Steve and Tony.
“Next year. This is just a draft of the scientific assessment. I’ve asked him to send me the impact assessment as soon as he gets his hands on a copy.”
The whole staff is on high alert, their postures stiff and their nerves on the edge. Who can blame them, really—after all, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue was painted a proud shade of blue not even six months ago. It’s mostly about being extremely territorial, with the Republicans, barely out of a gruesome two-year campaign and still reeling from the loss of the House, more ready to attack anyone who encroaches on what is supposed to be rightfully theirs.
“For starters, how about you do what’s right?” Jane retaliated. “That homeless shelter couldn’t find another warehouse to lease despite looking everywhere because since the owner of the warehouse you bought was leasing his property to the homeless shelter for a pittance, anywhere else was too expensive. Asgard Realty did
“You’ve always worn your heart on your sleeve, sir. That’s why you won the Presidency.”
Jessica takes a deep breath and tries to center herself.
“What?”
Rumiko throws her head back, laughing heartily. “I only need to see the way he looks at you to know how he feels about you.” She inches closer and whispers, “I know how Tony and I look together, Mr. President. But you asked for a show, did you not? There’s absolutely no need for jealousy. You’re wasting your energy on something that does not even exist.”
“This is going to be a bloodbath, Tony. This is bigger than anything we’ve ever dealt with,” she tells him. “Are you ready for this?”
“Is annoying Rhodey even necessary, Tony?” Pepper asks him, a warning more than a question, really.
White House presence since the budget negotiations began.”
“Cassie,” Tony chides, “you’re going to have to talk to her sooner rather than later.”
“Burn it,” he orders her.
He’s nearly fully dressed and drying his hair with a towel when Pepper comes clacking in, gorgeous as ever in a peach power suit. “Wow, you look horrible,” she tells him head-on.
He can already hear Tony Stark’s voice echoing through the hallway as they make their way to the Roosevelt Room. It should annoy him, really, that the Democrats think they own whatever place they’re in, but it actually amuses and fascinates him how Stark can command an entire room with just a simple smile, yet Maria Hill has to incite fear and animosity to garner attention.
give Maria Hill the authority to do whatever she pleases. I don’t know if it’s because we’ve been too remiss as the administration or if Hill and the others are planning shenanigans behind our backs.” He takes a moment to regain his composure. “If any of you have heard whispers from anyone in the Party, I would like the both of you to be honest with me now, please.”
That’s my first memory of home.
“He probably is,” Tony tells them. “That’s the only reason why he’d step down before being served. He’s a formidable Supreme Court Justice and a highly regarded member of the legal profession. If the charges are hollow, he’ll stay and ride it out, but odds are the evidence against him is solid, if the charges are moving forward.” He turns to Clint again. “Who’s filing charges?”
The living room is large, although a couple of sofas do take up the space. The main attraction, however, is a competition between the massive LED television screen and the bar area. The television is off while the bar area has its spotlights on, casting a warm glow, beckoning Clint towards it. Tony is already there, behind the counter, running his hands through the bottles before settling on one that hasn't been opened yet. The room is one of Tony's special occasion rooms; these are rooms that Tony uses only when he has people coming over, a sort of stage for him to engage with everyone. The living room, in particular, is usually set out for the strategy sessions like these, small celebrations and for particular nights when Clint gets calls from him at two in the morning to indulge in a glass or two.
are all pawns in this chess game, Stark. And to win, we have to outplay the guy who’s trying to make guns with vibranium.”
Tony looks down at the book he took out of the shelf—it’s a hardcover of One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, incidentally one of his favorites. “That was the year I became the majority leader. Cassie has never come out for public appearances with me—I’ve never asked her to, and I’d like to keep it that way—but that was one time, aside from my election to become the Speaker of the House, that she wanted to be in the Capitol to see it in person. She stood in the sidelines but the camera panned to her face for a split second. Her mother saw a news report that featured that video and I guess just had a gut instinct that Cassie was her daughter.”
“Alright, thanks Dugan. I’m sorry, Steve, I’ll have to go soon. I’ll be arriving at the Hill in a few minutes.”
I—I do, Pete, of course I do.
“I’m sorry about the mess,” he mutters as he tries to clear the coffee table of trash by tossing them on the floor.
Tony shrugs, trying to keep his demeanor nonchalant and non-confrontational. “I’m not. I’m just being realistic.”
“It’s been a busy couple of months for the firm,” Foggy explains.
She drizzles olive oil over a pan and turns the stove on. “Yes, can you hand me the squid, clams and shrimps I set aside there by the turkey?”
Tony gives Natasha a sly grin. “I have one.”
Tony takes the napkin and puts it inside his jacket pocket for safekeeping. “I appreciate this, Carol. I really do.”
Tony’s head hangs low. “I’m really sorry about all of that, Pep,” he says, regret evident in his voice.
Unfortunately, this town has never been for the sunny and fluffy. Reality always comes around to bite you in the ass, and that’s something that Tony has long accepted. It’s better, therefore, to get ahead than to be left behind even if it leaves a bad taste in the mouth.
Cassie doesn't respond.
“You knew about Pierce,” Coulson continues. “And chose to withhold that information from us.”
Natasha tilts her head, seemingly considering her friend’s offer. Pepper waits. Natasha normally doesn’t take her sweet time to think—she’s always on her toes, quick to give solutions to seemingly difficult problems. Her personal life, however, is an entirely different story.
A hand squeezes her shoulder gently. She turns around to see Carol standing behind her, giving her a reassuring and encouraging smile
“Right, of course. How could I forget that?”
“Rogers isn’t very happy with the Republicans, or rather Hill, going behind his back,” Natasha shares after taking a minute to think. “He’s gone to Papa Bear to cry.”
“I knew it.”
Natasha doesn’t look angry, she doesn’t. Her face is drawn into a frown, like she’s genuinely confused, like she’s completely not seeing why or how Clint could even begin to suggest that they were anything but two colleagues that fucked when they (when she, when
He laughs at that. “At least you—or someone from your party—will have the chance to be part of history, Miss Romanoff. And for that, I envy you.”
Clint knows that Natasha Romanoff is serious business. Nobody crosses her, not even the Speaker of the House. She dislikes people that make her wait. She likes order. She drinks her coffee black, no sugar. She will rationalize with you when you disagree with her, but she has such a way with words that sometimes, you don’t even realize you’re getting played and swayed by her. There are many reasons why she’s managed to keep her comfortable place on a pillar of respect (and maybe fear, just a little, though most men will not admit to this) for so long. Natasha holds her own, has spent her entire life since her parents died doing so. She wouldn’t have made DNC National Chair if she couldn’t.
Bruce stays and has the right mind to have one of Steve’s secretaries call the Vice President. It’s always best to have Phil around when the Leader of the Free World is on the edge—they work best as a triumvirate, after all. He waits for Steve to sit behind the Resolute Desk before informing him that Phil will be in the Oval Office in a few minutes.
“Are we good, JARVIS?” Tony asks his AI once everyone had left. No bars were wrecked tonight, thank god, although he suspects something must have happened between Kate and America, judging from his assistant’s dour entrance earlier. He’ll have to deal with that later.
“Thank you, Bruce,” Steve replies, clearly absentminded.
Bruce and Phil glance at each other, and the Chief of Staff gives the Vice President a nod, as if to give him permission. It’s a strange sight to see in the Oval Office, but that’s really how the three of them work—sometimes the lines of authority are blurred and they return to operating as one unit rather than three separate offices.
Fury contemplates, eyes not leaving Natasha’s. She’s right—Stark has always been a force to be reckoned with because he has always been smart and cunning about his moves. But the President, as much as Fury respects and admires him, has yet to be tested by difficult political choices. This crisis would be his debut into the most real, and very gritty world of politics, so maybe it’s time to leave the big calls to the veterans. “Can
“Birth control, taxes, gay marriage, and implied atheism?” Tony asks neutrally.
is impressed by him without any effort expended on his part whatsoever.
Pepper finally spots him and begins to make her way towards the terrace doorway. “I’ll be on the first flight out tomorrow, so I’ll see you on the Hill,” he informs Natasha.
Tony nods solemnly. “Yes. Cassie’s never forgiven her, even when she reappeared about three years ago.”
“You know that’s bullshit, Clint.” She shakes her head and takes another sip of her beer. “Tell me what’s going on with you.”
“It’s in the job description, sir,” Bruce jokes. “But the pleasure is definitely all mine. Can I ask, though, if you will be extending the same courtesy to the Vice President?”
The facilitator for the discussion, flustered, tried to salvage the situation. “Well, the question and answer portion isn’t until a little later, but I guess we can entertain this young lady’s queries. Can I have your name, please?”
Steve is speechless and dumbfounded, his eyes wide from the realization that Tony may have just given their budding relationship some more room to breathe. He steals a glance at their table, where the President of Italy and his First Lady are standing up to take the second dance. He sees Tony, his chin resting on his hand, and a knowing, satisfied grin on his face.
Steve starts from the beginning, recounting the events that led to this very breakfast with excruciating detail. Bruce listens with studious concentration, his face neutral yet soft with understanding. Steve is grateful for that—he doesn’t know if he can handle any sort of judgment right now.
“In case you’ve forgotten Tony,
He looks at her with a tired expression, unhappy to be putting her in this position. “Yes, but I’m going to have to apologize in advance, Ru. I haven’t given you enough time to process all of this, and yet here I am asking you to do something that’s not inconsequential.”
“Tony?” Steve’s head pokes out to the hallway.
“Service second to none,” Tony repeats rather proudly.
“What about him?” Janet clarifies.
But whatever happens, nothing will rain on his parade tonight. It was only a little bit over an hour ago when California news agencies announced that he had won his sixth term in Congress with a whopping 76 percent of the vote, so the celebrations will definitely go on despite the party’s major loss.
Bruce nods. “I’ll have Sharon contact his office immediately.”
“Admit it, Steve, you don’t trust me. Not really,” Tony continues. “I wouldn’t be here being intimidated into talking if you did.”
Tony is taken aback. Did the President just admit that he’s desperate? He really needs to have his hearing checked. Perhaps the White House has an angle, a new strategy to fix this budget mess with this call. But could it also be genuine bipartisanship on behalf of the President? Whatever it is, though, Tony is definitely interested in finding out. And Tony, being Tony, well… No one expects anything less than going for the jugular. So he cuts the act and goes straight to the point. “Is this for real?”
“Could he be implicated in Pierce’s case?” Pepper questions.
“Religious institutions, especially hospitals and universities, should not be required by law to provide contraceptives, which are clearly against their faiths, as part of employee health plans,” Maria says forcefully.
“Two minutes,” says the department’s press secretary.
“Penny for your thoughts,” Tony says as he lays down two grilled cheese sandwiches in front of Steve.
That earns him another laugh from the President. “I’m going to need some of that pixie dust. Care to share some of that magic?”
“I trust you know how the game is played.” Tony opens the car door for her and they both slide in. “But you do look stunning, Ru,” he compliments her as they settle in the limousine. She only smiles.
“Seeing as we just lost the White House, not so good,” she tells him in discontent, but obviously attempting to smile. “But at least it’s not all bad news.”
“Contacting Mr. Hogan now.”
in this arena.”
Cassie looks at the screen and groans. “No,” she says with finality.
Pepper tilts her head, observing her best friend quietly. “If you’re sure.”
"Tempting, but I'm afraid you may not be able to satisfy me the way Mr. Stark does."
You actually did have a point. I’m proud of you.
Kate thinks for a moment. “No,” she answers with certainty.
Clint nods. “Sure. Alright, just for the benefit of our newcomers—“ he motions to Foggy and Jessica, “—we were alerted of the possibility of Pierce resigning about a month ago. We followed that lead, talked to people who don’t currently hate us and found out that the DOJ was building a case against him. We knew he was being charged for bribery, perhaps fraud, but we weren’t entirely sure about the details of the case.” He looks to Tony.
“Hey, Tony.” There’s a certain hesitation in Steve’s voice. “You there?”
“Would you like to bet on that?”
“See how much I love you guys?” he responds, exasperated. Tony waits for an expected retort from Kate, but nothing comes. He looks around, surprised, and realizes that she isn’t present. “Where the hell is my assistant?”
signature eve of battle food.
Major shoutout to The American President, which is my inspiration for this chapter. Y'all should go and watch that movie.
“Don’t test me, Hill,” Fury warns her one last time. “Dismissed.”
Winning the Presidency meant that he had to accept that putting on a show would be part of the job description, especially for grand nights like these where the only thing that people expected was a show, and a grandiose one at that. Over the years, he has learned how to do exactly that: play the game and play it well, even if it meant putting himself in situations he didn’t want to be in. And yet, tonight he seems to have lost his muscle memory, forgotten all those years of training, the tolerance for festivities like this somehow slipped away. He tells himself that it’s absolutely not because Tony is sitting right beside him, looking decadent in his bespoke white tie suit, chatting away with the guest of honor in flawless, exquisite Italian.
“As if you haven’t been Eager McBeaver yourself. I know you’ve been playing Angry Birds in there for the last hour,” she fires back. He rolls his eyes.
“Go right ahead,” Tony permits.
Rumiko laughs heartily as she kisses him on the cheek. “It’s faux fur. Very expensive faux fur, to be exact. But don’t worry, Tony, I’ll be sure to mention how fake it is to the reporters.”
“We just don’t work as a couple,” Tony concedes. And he knows that, really. He sighs and rubs a thumb along the back of her hand—an affectionate gesture Tony used to do when they were still together. “I just miss you sometimes.”
“Oh please,” she chastises him playfully. The clock in the kitchen reads almost five-thirty—back to business
He coughs, as if to forcefully expel that bit of introspection from his mind. “So, what’s the story?” Steve asks, trying to change the subject.
YOLO MOTHERFUCKERS
“Good.” Natasha pauses to take a bite from her toast and drink from her mimosa. “Don’t worry too much, Pep. You know I won’t let things go out of control. And Tony knows what he’s doing.”
Jane laughs breathily. “Just because he gave you a vacation…”
“Yes. Very. Especially since you had multiple orga—“
It still doesn’t make the pit in his stomach disappear, though.
Pepper speaks up after a lull. “It makes sense, though.”
“Oh my god,” Pepper utters. “What the hell is going on?”
“Uncle Tones, I was present and conscious during that Thanksgiving dinner. No man who looks at your ass that many times is straight or, you know,
“Is this one of those things that you can’t tell me about?” There’s a sad smile on Steve’s face, and Tony can’t help but feel guilty. He desperately wants to tell Steve what’s going on, to reassure his lover, and his President, that he has it all under control, that he will handle it, that he will protect the White House and protect the country with everything he has.
Anne slides the fifteen-pound turkey into the oven like a pro, takes off the oven mitts and wipes her hands on the dish cloth on top of the counter. She then heads over to Clint and pats his cheek in a knowing, motherly manner. “You didn’t answer my question, dear. But I’ll let it pass.” She pauses and gives him an amused smile. “You and Darcy are certainly two peas in a pod.”
Tony catches Steve’s eye before he leaves for the Oval, and the President gives him a small smile and a nod. It’s not over yet. There is still much work to be done.
“Truly, if Natasha brought you along to this little soirée,” Tony says with a smirk.
Steve watches as Tony spreads butter onto the pan and grills their sandwiches. He really is an enigma to him. Not just because of his colorful personal history—from being an alcoholic almost all of his young life to being sober for thirteen years, from engineering to politics, from being the heir to throne of Stark Industries to being Speaker of the House—but mostly because Steve has never met anyone so
“No, Steve, it’s
“Maybe we should have mandatory psych evaluations for your district. I’m not at all sure that any of your constituents are sane,” she teases.
Tony takes that as his cue, but Steve beats him to the punch. “Then shut it down.”
Bruce takes a moment to fully grasp the President’s admission. “You’re right that it’s not something that’s done here. Everything is quid pro quo and nothing is for free in this line of work. But you’re the President, sir. You can do whatever you want. And frankly, I find it honorable that you were willing to work with Tony Stark on such authentic terms.”
“Are you sure you know what you’re doing?” Pepper whispers in his ear.
Clint shifts, unsure about how to respond. It’s not that he knows where Darcy and Kate are at this point in their relationship, but more that he wants to protect his assistant’s privacy and let her decide what to tell her parents and when. He thinks on it for a moment. “I’ve been in this business for a long time, and I’m not the best person to talk about relationships, believe me,” he tells her in a self-deprecating tone. “But those two? They’re the real deal. If they work hard enough, they’ll make it through the worst of it.”
But art has always been his soul, his core, his center. It kept him alive in the darkest of times—the aftermath of the fire that made him an orphan, his two extended tours to Afghanistan, Uncle Michael’s sudden death, Aunt Hannah’s shortly after him, and Peggy’s long fight with cancer. Art made him feel safe in a world that had taken everyone he loved from him. It gave him hope, and reminded him of the beauty of humanity in a sea of pain and suffering.
“That doesn’t give her the right to start cooking things up behind our backs,” Steve says, his voice rising. “If she has a problem with they way we’re dealing with this, then she comes to me. Whatever happened to party unity?”
Cassie returns to the kitchen sink, where the spaghetti is completely drained of excess water. “Just some Seafood Aglio e Olio. JARVIS said you’d been stuck in the Capitol the whole day, with the whole Pierce thing. Figured you might want one of your favorite dishes for dinner when you got home.”
After a quick debrief in the driveway while waiting for their respective rides, Tony thanks his team for a job well done and sends them all home. It’s been a long, emotionally taxing night for everyone, and they all reserve a few hours of rest before they regroup in the morning.
Okay, here we go!
Steve does step aside, amused and frankly, getting a little whiplash from the sudden change in Tony’s demeanor. But he adjusts almost immediately. “Alright then, you’re the chef for today.”
they’re talking about, after all—Natasha Romanoff, the big and badass boss of the DNC, respected and feared in both sides of the aisle; Natasha Romanoff, the woman with the gaze of death, seemingly emotionless, cold-blooded and heartless. In all her years working for Tony, Kate had never even observed so much as an inkling of a weakness from Natasha. Now, looking at Clint, she’s more or less figured out how Natasha can remain so thick-skinned: by eliminating all possibilities of fragility.
Tony takes his tablet out of his bag and hands it to Kate. “He’s a bioengineer who worked for Oscorp for decades before retiring two years ago. He’s now a professor at Columbia University.”
Tony gives her a glum, long-suffering smile. “But it’s a job that should be done.”
“We’re getting close,” Janet says gravely. “Do you think this is why we’re being watched?”
“Where have I heard that name before?”
Tony pauses, hesitant to ask his next question. Finally, he gives in. “How many times did he look at my ass?”
Tony takes a deep breath, and allows himself to be lulled into a semblance of tranquility by Steve’s fingers. He thinks about his team and their frightening efficiency, their sense of duty, and their desire to seek the truth no matter what the cost. But mostly he thinks about fear, and what that cost might be if Jessica, Rhodey, and Carol were to get caught, if information about Parker were to fall into the wrong hands, if Matt and Foggy were to run into some really bad people on their search for answers. He thinks about fear and how he tries not to let it consume him, especially when so many trust him with their lives.
“I’m serious. I’ll be having turkey sandwich for a month if I don’t get more people to eat the goddamn turkey.”
Kate sighs and starts to get up, defeated. “Loki Odinson is in town. I suggest you watch out for him.” She will have to make up some explanation as to why she’s coming back to the team empty-handed, but that doesn’t mean she can’t help her friend out. They really do want to help, after all.
“The garden is beautiful,” Tony says suddenly, as if reading Steve’s mind. “I honestly never thought I’d have the privilege to walk here, especially under these circumstances.”
“Well then,” Thor offers Jane his arm and she takes it. “Let’s try to lift their spirits up. It’s not all bad news, as you said.”
Again, thank you so much for the wonderful feedback, and we hope your patience lasts until the end of the series.
“I want you,” Steve tells Tony, his voice clear and his eyes certain. “I want all of you.”
Despite his head spinning, reeling from tonight’s mix of heavy emotions, he goes to sleep knowing that tomorrow won’t be easy, but maybe, just maybe, it will all be worth it in the end.
“Let me get this straight,” Wade says. “He’s going to retire to avoid an impeachment case? That makes it look like he’s guilty.”
“It’s not the worst idea in the world,” Pepper remarks.
“You better not, because you know you’ve been leaving NASA out to dry.”
“Which means she hasn’t let me off at all. The worst is yet to come.” He raises a blue and white tie with his right hand, and a red and gold tie with his left. “Which one?”
You are a very disturbed man.
Tony shakes his hands over the sink to expel the excess water, and dries them using the towel hanging on the handle of one of the drawers. “JARVIS?”
happy, aren't you?”
“For his sake, I hope I don’t break his,” he says seriously. He offers her his hand, which she accepts as she gets up. “Dum Dum is ready when you are.”
Mia was already twelve by then. They were already a happy family and I felt that I had no right to intrude. They kept insisting, though. They were so open and loving, and I… Even though I kept pushing them away, they wouldn’t have it.
Because I've been dying to write a particular section of this chapter, I couldn't resist giving it to all of you in less than a week. Felt like I was vomiting words for a bit there. Also it's quite an emotional chapter and I had to restrain myself from giving you all the backstory, but that's not how I want this fic to play out so you'll have to keep reading to find out everyone's story.
“It’s not an anomaly, but it is unusual. I assume you’ve gone to specialists and had all the tests done with everything coming out normal?”
Then Steve gets it.
So Steve shouldn’t be surprised that he finds himself about to make a call that he doesn’t really want to do. He has never really been good at dealing with the demons of his past, but he has found that it’s also part of the job description. The entirety of his life will not be able to escape the clutches of this job, and that is something he’ll have to accept and live with for the duration of his term.
She smirks. “Fat chance, Barton.”
Stan gives him a curt nod. “Yes, the President informed us that you will be preparing Thanksgiving dinner with him. We will be happy to bring those up to the President’s private kitchen and set it up for you.” He signals to the staff behind him and they start unloading the car. Stan extends his arm towards the inside of the Residence. “If you’ll follow me?”
She goes for it. “It’s no secret that you’ve been sleeping together, but something’s changed. We hardly ever see Clint outside of the Hill anymore.” Pepper sighs, looks at Natasha as if to appeal a case. “I don’t know what’s going on between the two of you, but I just want you to know that I’m here for you if ever you need someone to talk to.”
It's easy enough to hate those from across the aisle, but no one ever told them that it was bad news to fall in love with the enemy.
The FBI agent looks at the expectant faces of this mismatched team, and sighs in resignation. “She’s the Jane Doe in the Harry Osborn case.”
Jessica groans. “Shit.”
Tony puts down his phone and turns to her with a roguish smile. “What are we betting on?”
“We haven’t tried to kill each other yet, so I believe we do.”
Steve reads the letter carefully, word per word so as not to misunderstand anything. “I honestly can’t believe this,” he says, incredulous. “He’s what, 68? He’s too young to retire, isn’t he?”
Kate sits on his desk, right in front of Tony. “But they must have given you
They dropped everything and rushed her to the hospital. She was unresponsive, but breathing the whole drive, and Thor was beside himself. It was Frigga’s turn to console her son, holding his hand after Jane had disappeared behind the curtains with the doctors and nurses. Sif stepped up and took charge of making sure that the Thanksgiving dinner would be cooked, and that the rest of the Odinson clan, who were sure to arrive in the house very soon, would be informed and entertained.
“You don’t need a fucking penny, Stark; you can have a goddamn bath in them.”
“The White House is hosting their first state dinner for the Italian Prime Minister next week, and if I’m not mistaken, some of us have already been handed invitations. I was hoping we could capitalize on the numerous human resources that the gala will offer us,” Tony schemes.
“You know, you’re just like him,” Hill says suddenly.
It could have gone worse, but he’s okay with how the conversation went. They can’t really go back to how things were—there’s too much history there—but there’s hope. They can be friends as well as colleagues, and Steve is looking forward to that possibility.
“That may have been a part of this, yes. But Tony has many masks, and he wears all of them well—you wanted a show, and he’s giving it to you.” She scans the room and sees that all eyes are on them. “Look around you, Mr. President, and tell me: what photos are the press going to be putting on their front pages tomorrow?”
“But why?” Pepper asks, incredulous. “He’s got about ten to fifteen good years left in that seat!”
Steve laughs heartily. “It’s not a walk in the park, I can say that much.”
“Look, Stark may be eccentric and arrogant at best, but you can’t deny that he’s a genius, Pep. I keep telling you, he should just quit politics and put up his own tech company. He’ll give Stane and that Jobs guy a run for their money,” he says passionately as he butters his toast a little too much more than the usual.
With most of the guests up and about, mingling with each other, Natasha orders her team into action. “Alright, time to work for a living.”
“Noted, but don’t bank on it,” she says. “Now shoo, before Clint starts looking lost. You know how grumpy he is first thing in the morning.”
“It’s not every day that a man and his goddaughter make the perfect Thanksgiving dinner. There must be a story behind that.”
The sitting room is warm and cozy, its fireplace lit and glowing. It’s very much a physical manifestation of its current resident—bright and wholehearted, all warm and earthy. Steve stands by the console table, clearly very happy to see him. Tony can’t help but loosen up and feel relaxed at the eager welcome.
Foggy glances at his watch. “About half an hour past midnight. And you didn’t answer my question. Are you sure about this?”
In between tears and kisses, the room erupts into laughter, exuberance, and gratefulness for the wonderful and unexpected blessing they have received.
“You’re kidding me.”
The ladies exit the conference room first, leaving the boys to gather their things and have a little locker room talk. “I think I’ve figured out why the Republicans hate us so much,” Wade says after having admired Pepper’s and Janet’s gracefulness as they left the Speaker’s office.
“What do you mean?”
“I’m not saying this investigation isn’t important, but…” There’s sadness in her voice. “This wasn’t the job you were elected to do, Tony.”
And don’t you know it, honeybunch.
Clint sees the alarm pass through Natasha’s face for a split second. “If he’s going to be distracted all night, that’s going to be a problem.”
Tony sighs and nods. “Let’s get this show on the road.”
Natasha is not at all surprised. “Well, then, it seems like we have our work cut out for us, Mr. Speaker.”
: Peter, stop fidgeting.
Tony smirks. “That’s all they’ve got?”
“See Cass, if you’d gone to Georgetown like I suggested, you would be able to say you went to the President’s alma mater,” Tony teases her.
“The both of you,” Tony tells the ladies, hands raised to frame their faces. “Exquisite. What a sight for the sore eyes.”
“Is he okay?” Pepper asks, a little alarmed. “Is he safe?”
Jessica clears her throat and makes a final quick scan of the room. She spots Carol’s determined face in the crowd and, with a curt nod from the Attorney General, begins with her statement.
“As of fifteen minutes ago, no. He was able to escape the DOJ safehouse in Georgia with his wife and kid before hostiles barged in, but we don’t know what his status is now. Tony, we need to call this in.”
Kate laughs, because it really is a crazy party, and their leader is nothing short of brilliantly insane.
Sharon does as she’s told, and finds a comfortable spot on the couch in the middle of the Oval. He follows to sit across from her. There’s an awkward silence between them while Steve gathers his wits about him. Earlier in the week, he had told Phil and Bruce about the recent…developments regarding his relationship with Tony. It had been a pretty straightforward conversation, neither of them turning out to be that at all surprised with how things had progressed between the President and the Speaker of the House. Their biggest concern had been the press and how the story should be handled when the time comes, but Steve had waved it off, telling his Chief of Staff and his Vice President that they’d cross the bridge when they’d get there.
“Nick,” Natasha greets him. She proceeds to take the empty seat in front of Nick Fury, takes off her sunglasses and puts it on the table. Her eyebrow is raised and there is an amused look playing on her face.
“I thought we trusted each other, Tony,” Steve says softly, if not a little dangerously."
He’s looking at the finished painting now, taking a long, hard look at what he had created, and for the life of him could not understand what it was—all whites, blues, grays, depicting a sort of light source emitting a bluish hue—but gazing at it is calming him, evening out his breathing and stilling his mind. For some reason, the painting reminds him so much of home.
“Yes,” Foggy tells her. “But his daughter goes to school in New York.”
The facilitator coughed. “Astrophysics is a long way from business ethics.”
“Very interesting indeed. Well, we all know Mr. Hammer,” Thor throws in. “But I am not familiar with Aldrich Killian.”
As Tony walks briskly through the halls to exit the White House residence, his brings the team phone again to his ear. “JARVIS, are you there?”
“I serve at the pleasure of the President-elect.” Bruce takes him in for a hug. “I’ll leave you to rest. We have a long day ahead of us tomorrow.”
Cassie and Tony are loading the last of the food and kitchenware into the black SUV that Steve had sent over to pick them up. Tony had packed up everything they needed—and then some—with an almost militaristic precision earlier that morning, much to his goddaughter’s chagrin.
Steve thinks, utterly dumbfounded.
By the way, this is the end of Arc 1. Next chapter officially begins Arc 2!
“I’m sorry, my first trimester?” Jane repeats. “But I’m not pregnant.”
“Arc reactor…” Steve murmurs, tracing the linings of the device cautiously with his fingers. “Why the need to miniaturize?”
It’s not until Kate is halfway home when she receives a text message.
“We haven’t met,” interjects a portly man with blonde hair hovering behind the guys. He extends a hand towards Jessica. “Foggy Nelson.”
has now been posted on Tumblr!
Tony pinches the bridge of his nose. “And we all talked about how the DOD could be involved too, if briefly in our first meeting here, remember? Dammit, how could I have completely missed that angle?”
“I know you are,” she responds gently.
“Good to see you too, Hill. I’ve missed you like crazy.”
Clint rubs his hands before picking up his cup. “I wish. It was in the middle of freaking nowhere. I think letting us die of hypothermia was part of their plan.”
Cassie lights up. “Of course! Had Kate reserve one for me at Stachowski’s a couple of weeks ago. Picked it up when I arrived.” She unloads the seafood on the pan and drizzles more olive oil on it.
“Shall we begin?”
“Tash, I think we need to talk about this,” Clint says, catching her stare in the glass before she turns away and searches for her earrings on the stand beside the bed.
She pouts at him jokingly. “I’m not upset, I just feel very left out.”
“I overheard Senator Logan’s assistant in the hall before I left the Capitol, and apparently the White House made a call to Fury about Hill,” Darcy narrates. They all wait expectantly for more, and she shrugs. “That’s all I know.”
“That is what we are going to find out,” Thor says, deep in thought. “As well as what my brother’s role is in all of this.”
“How are things in the Senate?” Tony asks the senators in the room.
“Involve the President if you have to,” Natasha adds.
“I'm neither dead nor stupid.”
Tony sighs. He didn’t think it was going to be this hard to convince his ever-loyal sidekick. “Kate, I’m a—“
“Let’s make this quick,” Natasha starts, clearly impatient and ready to get the meeting over with. “I know many of you are leaving for your respective Thanksgiving celebrations tonight. Clint, do you want to start?”
Clint pats his shoulder. “Will do, Tones. You take care of yourself, alright? And don’t let JARVIS have all the fun.”
“Norman Osborn being one of them,” Clint adds.
“Well, Pepper wasn't surprised. Neither was Natasha. Clint, Thor and Janet that needed a little bit more…explanation. Other than that, it went as well as one could hope,” he describes.
“That narrows the original subject easily—it doesn’t have anything to do with ixnay on mentioning atashanay, would it?”
She sighs. “What were you up to?” Kate asks as a concession of defeat. She won’t go anywhere if she argues his sleeping habits further.
He takes a moment and swallows another gulp of beer. “You know I’m in love with her, Kate. I want to be with her. Obviously, she doesn’t feel the same way, or I wouldn’t be—” he stretches his arms wide, as if to hug his whole apartment, “—
“None taken,” Pepper responds with a shrug. “Speaking of Tony—“
“Assemble the team, Kate,” he orders her excitedly. “Call in the cavalry. Release the Kraken. Winter is coming.”
“Sir, yes, sir,” he says, and she can feel him salute at the other end. “See you at the Hill.” He hangs up, and she smiles despite herself. Mastering the art of bossing Tony Stark wasn’t easy and she had to grasp at straws when she began working for him, but over the years Kate has learned how to deal with him at times like these. Besides, she’s always had his best interests at heart, and he knows that, knows when to allow Kate to boss him around.
“Thank you, sir. I serve at the pleasure of the President.” And they both hang up.
When the President does arrive, Tony feels like the air is being sucked out of his lungs. Because, yes, that is a fine specimen of a human being right there, but it’s actually a little weird putting the President and Steve in the same body—they’re like two different people to him. This Steve Rogers, the one who’s brow is furrowed, who’s lips are in a thin line, and is surrounded by Secret Service, is a little distant and seems unreachable, like the pièce de résistance of a much awaited museum exhibition. The Steve he’s been talking to for the past two months is warm and approachable, always laughing and always a little silly, like a golden retriever. The dissonance is disconcerting, and to be honest, Tony doesn’t like it very much.
“What is this?” he asks Tony carefully.
“I am,” Steve admits, and takes a deep breath before continuing. “I spent all night thinking about this, and I figured it was time to tell you. Confess, if you will.”
Did you do anything?
Tony tilts his head at Clint. “Impeachment?”
“Can I get a roll call and a quick sit-rep?” she murmurs, soft enough for the communicator to pick up.
Natasha shakes her head. “Unlikely, if he’s here and wants the seat.”
“I’ll take it,” Tony replies.
Steve smiles, a little embarrassed. “Thank you.”
Tony’s apprehension abruptly makes the air around the two uneasy and tentative. He wonders if this is all going south, if Natasha’s strategy still has any mettle at this point, even if the meeting had just begun.
“Ugh, I’m so tired of this bullshit.” Clint burrows his face in his hands and rubs his closed eyes. “Why can’t these people just do normal crime shit like stealing from poor people or manipulating the market to steal even more from poor people? At least that I can yell about at work.”
“That’s great, Tony. Makes it easier for the team, especially for the assistants.” Darcy starts to stir and stretch to consciousness, the folder on her stomach falling to the ground to join the rest of its contents. Kate starts the coffee. “And have you been thinking about your real world job at all?”
Once the three are clear of the workshop, Tony takes a deep breath and faces his colleagues with a bright, yet slightly nervous smile. “So,” he says nervously. “This might not be the right time to tell you that I’m kind of dating Steve Rogers.”
Pepper takes a deep breath. “Tony.”
you'd be dating the Speaker of the House. Clearly, you have a type.”
Pepper arrives with Janet and Hank not ten minutes after the assistants do. Thor comes in booming and Wade trails behind him. Natasha arrives last, but most definitely not the least, and Clint is thankfully sober enough to function. They all start to congregate on the sofas the moment Kate announces that dinner is served.
He smiles at her nervously and coughs, not sure where or how to begin. Sharon looks at him expectantly. “Before I begin, I just want to clarify that this conversation is between an uncle and his niece-in-law, and not between the President and his Executive Assistant.”
Well, this didn't take long at all! This chapter officially begins the third and final arc of the fic. I'm glad to be finally moving the plot along, and since I've already mapped how the final arc is going to play out, my only enemy to finishing this within the year at this point is grad school and procrastination.
And now Tony understands why this man won the hearts of 65 million Americans. He sounds strong and sure, and there isn’t a hint of dishonesty in his voice. But being a Democrat, Tony has to ask himself: can he actually trust this guy?
It’s all very thrilling to Tony, even with the danger of him losing important body parts to the two most terrifying women he’s ever known.
The Democrats shuffle in the infamous room, laughing and joking around—goddamn them for being so cheerful on a morning like this. Bruce is no longer surprised with the party Stark has brought with him—Congresswoman Pepper Potts, House Majority Leader and his right hand woman; Congresswoman Janet Van Dyne, chairman of the House Budget Committee; Senator Thor Odinson, Senate Minority Leader; and Senator Hank Pym, ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. He’s a little puzzled at the absence of Barton and Wilson, but he supposes that it must have been for a reason, and he’d bet his life that the both of them were invited to Stark’s pad for one of his infamous planning sessions.
Natasha should have some answers. Deadly ones, but they’re answers nonetheless.
“You shouldn’t be so hard on him, you know,” Clint tells her carefully after about a minute of silence. “He’s got the weight of the world on his shoulders, and we put it there.”
That stops Sharon, the astonishment clear as day on her face. “Okay. I wasn't expecting that, but okay.”
Twenty years and two wonderful children—I don’t think I could have done it alone, heck, I don’t think I could have done it at all. I’d always thought that I’d end up like dad, but aw man, Mia and Peter. They’re spectacular children. That’s all Steve, that’s really all of Steve’s work. I can’t take credit for how beautifully my children turned out, I just can’t.
he thinks with a shiver.
“There’s a belief that says otherwise?”
"Couldn't help notice how eager you are to get rid of me. Got a hot date?" he replies after a beat's moment of hesitation. Darcy laughs.
“You still think I don’t know how to play the game,” Rumiko says in disbelief. “I don’t know if this is sexism or ageism or racism or all of the above.”
Kate’s eyes widen in realization. “She was the judge that sent Norman Osborn’s son to prison.” Then, she stops and takes a moment to think. “Did we even want her on the bench? I don’t remember the team discussing names for that seat, certainly not hers.”
“Ignore him,” Cassie retorts playfully.
“We cannot do this here, Tony,” T’Challa tells him, his face grim. “Not even your White House is safe.”
“He can be a pain in the ass, though,” Pepper adds.
“Understood, Mr. President. If that’s all, I suggest we move on with the security briefing. The Joint Chiefs are already waiting outside,” Bruce proposes.
“And you told none of us of this plan of yours?” Natasha is clearly a little pissed off about being left in the dark by her own people. Again.
Tony smirks as he gets in the car with Cassie. “Right. Thank you, Scott, for teaching my goddaughter good manners from the afterlife.”
“Too many thoughts running through my mind, so I decided to tinker.”
“What sort of history are we talking about?” Natasha probes even further.
“I thought Thanksgiving was a time for family, Thor,” Loki had said, his words dripping with disdain for his older brother. “Why am I suddenly being turned away by the people who claim to love me?"
Steve grins like a child who just got what he wanted, and then turns on his serious mode. Fun time is over that quickly, apparently. “Before we begin I just want to thank you for taking this road with me. I know putting your trust in someone you don’t know couldn’t have been easy, but when I saw your small press conference earlier, I knew I had made the right call in putting my trust in you.”
Tony sighs and responds in defeat, “No, I guess not.”
He tries to make the situation lighter, more work related. “And in the spirit of friendship, listen,” Tony begins, his tone shifting to a more professional one. “Something’s brewing. We’re trying to figure out exactly what it is, but until then, keep your eyes and ears open for anything out of the ordinary.”
is special
Her phone beeps again just as she’s about to put it back in her pocket.
“And you’re looking at Greece because…?”
to lovingly bother me about stuff regarding the fic. It also has its own
“Thanks.” Tony quickly ties it, fussing over the knot more than he normally does.
“Should I send Peter in?” Tony nods. Kate pops her head out the door. “Quill! The boss wants to see you.”
Before my mom died, she told me to be a good person, because somewhere somehow the things you do will come back to you—karma and all that. And—I don’t know, I must have done something badass because I really don’t think I deserve this. Two amazing kids and the most incredible husband anyone could ever ask for, I just—god, I really don’t know what I have done to deserve this. So much love and happiness, I can’t—
Steve is clearly taken aback by the invitation. “Wow, that’s…that’s very thoughtful of you.”
“Natasha—“
Clint turns to Natasha, and she catches the hint of uneasiness that passes quickly across his face. His expression does not last for more than a split second, but she knows him well enough to spot his tells. “Tony isn’t prepared for this,” he whispers to the team. “We haven’t even begun to imagine where the DOD angle could lead us, let alone think about the potential involvement of influential military contractors.”
“And our most important and urgent bills taken hostage with killer amendments,” Pepper adds, remembering the silent threat she had made to Maria Hill three months before with the Women’s Health Act.
DON'T YOU JUST LOVE CASSIE!!!!
“I'm not,” he tells her defensively.
Happy anniversary.
“Kitchen is this way,” is all he says to Tony in reply. That still stung him, no matter what motivations Tony might have had with those words.
“I understand how these things work, Foggy,” Elektra tells him, a bit irritated at the insinuation that she can’t keep her mouth shut. She turns back to Matt. “When do you need this?”
He pouts at her. “Well, you have no cause for complaint. Your callsign is cool. ‘Black Widow’—sounds like something coming out of a spy movie.”
JARVIS can you run diagnostic tests on the latest SI designs while I wrap up the circuitry on the new models?
“The usual. Didn’t sleep at all last night,” Kate tells her girlfriend with a disapproving look. She pours two cups of coffee and hands one to Darcy.
“‘Your lot?’ We’re a little British tonight, aren’t we?” Tony teases.
“Goodnight, Stinger. Get some rest, you’ve been working too hard.”
“Yes, sir!” she says with a salute, and Tony rolls his eyes again, although with more affection than he would dare to confess. Kate has always loved the late-night planning and the head-to-head sessions in the House, and Tony would never, ever admit to anyone that indulging Kate’s war freak side is a more compelling reason to allow her in these meetings than the fact that he can’t find shit when she isn’t around.
“So,” Rhodey proceeds, wiping his fingertips with a napkin. “What’s up?”
You’ve lived here for almost half your life and you choose to complain about the furniture now, while we’re recording for our parents’ 20
“None so far.”
“I had some flowers delivered to spruce the room up,” Frigga says as she comes back into the room, breaking Thor’s trip down memory lane. “And Sif called, said she had one of Valkyrie’s daughters bring some of Jane’s things. She’ll be here in about half an hour.”
“What…does that mean,” Steve asks, confused.
“Nothing,” he says as he takes his seat behind the desk and sighs. “They wouldn’t tell me anything, which I expected, to be honest.”
in an instant. And you certainly weren’t like this when Obi came to DC and attempted to blackmail you to get you to back-off on your rhetoric on the Stane-Hammer partnership.”
Steve smiles at her and tells her with certainty, “Yes, I am.”
“Sorry, did you say something?”
Suddenly, Tony is distracted by the TV. Steve is standing behind a podium in the Rose Garden, proud and dignified, beside him a very stern yet resplendent woman. He turns the volume up by a couple of notches as the President begins to speak.
“Excuse me?” Darcy pipes up at the back, her hand raised. No one acknowledges her. “
“Is everything alright?”
Tony takes a deep breath. “I think she wanted to. She had already made a new life for herself in Phoenix, and I think she wanted to include her firstborn in that new life. But I guess she knew that Cassie didn’t want to go with her, and that I would fight for Cassie with everything I’ve got.”
“I’m already married to you,” she would say. “What’s a little more insanity in my life?” He’d kiss the top of her head and laugh because oh, he’s the luckiest man in the world to have the most amazing woman by his side.
“Is there a reason why I’m not being told the whole story?”
The household staff had immaculately laid out all their ingredients and cooking utensils in the small kitchen. Cassie reaches out to the racks to distribute aprons to Tony and Steve, and begins to work around the space like it was her own. Tony follows suit, and they begin preparing the ingredients like a well-oiled machine. Steve, being the newcomer, is delegated to vegetable duty, which gives him the opportunity to observe Tony and Cassie in a very intimate, familial sense.
Before anyone can answer that, Darcy barges in through the front door, Clint trailing behind her, exclaiming, “Victory is mine, victory is mine! Bring me the finest libations in all the land.”
“It’s been more than a week. We haven’t had any new information about this, and no one we know or trust has seen him around the city,” Pepper interjects. “Are we certain Darcy’s intel is good?”
Everyone snaps at attention. Even Wade, who was already dozing off on the couch, is now up and alert. Thor looks like he’s ready to hit something with a hammer, and the only thing between him and total destruction is Jane’s steadying grip on his forearm.
He rubs his eyes, takes a deep breath, and takes the plunge. “Sharon? Get me Congressman Barnes on the line.”
“But real talk, though,” Wade says suddenly. “Do you honestly think this administration would nominate
“Bye, Pep. See ya.” He watches as she bids a few more friends goodbye and exits through the front door.
Dad, Pops… I may not say it often enough but thank you. For everything. I can’t—I just—I love you guys. Happy anniversary.
Steve nods in agreement. “I appreciate you starting your day early to meet with me. I really needed this talk to get my head straight.”
Of course I did.
Tony knows that none of that will work on Steve. He has had three months to get to know the person behind all the pomp and circumstance, and if there is one thing he’s certain about the President, it’s that he can smell bullshit from a mile away. And the fact that Tony has been nothing but genuine to him since the start of their… relationship?... means that Steve has gotten to know the Speaker pretty well, too.
“I’m so sorry about all this, Tash.”
She raises her arms halfway in mock surrender. “Sorry, my bad. You’re not going to tell your boss, are you Billy?” Cassie asks their escort.
“Relax, Pep,” he tells her. “I’ve got this.”
She walks slowly across the room, greeting people she’s acquainted with along the way, all the while keeping her mark within her line of sight. After extracting a $150,000 pledge from the CEO of a skyrocketing IT company, she finds Aldrich Killian chatting vociferously with some very senior people from the State Department, one of which she knows quite well.
There’s a spread of sweets, pastries and drinks laid out in Steve’s sitting room, and Cassie practically flies towards the chocolates. “Oooh, heaven is a place on earth,” she sings as she takes a piece of Turkish Delight from the tray. She spots Tony, comfortably seated on one of the couches, scanning his phone. “Don’t you want anything?”
“So am I. Look, my questionable sanity is not really a secret around here. I
“Because if we do, Congress will have a field day and we’ll have a budget that is a far, far cry from what it originally was,” Bruce adds. “And that’s exactly what’s going to happen if we don’t put our foot down.”
“I do, but Tony does what he wants. He’s always been like that. He wouldn’t be the Speaker of the House if he weren’t like that.”
“Climate change: the greatest challenge humankind will face in the next one hundred years,” Tony declares. “And this is why my arc reactor design is so important.”
Suddenly, he’s not so hungry anymore.
“Yes,” the lawyer responds. “The Justice department found evidence of him bribing the judge assigned to the case to postpone the hearing, giving him ample time to then bribe Cleveland police to release the vibranium. We can delve more into that but I’m sure you’ve already read the briefing packet released by the DOJ this morning.”
” She pats the finished knot. “All done.”
“Sounds dire,” Natasha jokes.
She goes on. “I can understand accepting an offer of cooperation from the other side, but not telling your two best people about it and planning for your next move… Jesus, Tony, this is…now
“I’m so sorry, Steve, I didn’t mean to—“
Steve chuckles. “Your guess is as good as mine, Mr. President. It’s my first state dinner, but I’m afraid I had to miss my meeting with Protocol this afternoon, so I am utterly uneducated as to what happens in functions like this. And as you can see, I’m going stag tonight, so I would not know how to initiate the proceedings, so to speak.”
“That’s because it was you doing the dragging, Tony. I wouldn’t have minded if you had sent the ladies after me,” the FBI agent retorts.
, goddammit) felt like it.
Kate gives her a steely look, and begins to speak in a more professional tone. “I can understand if you don’t want to tell me the specifics of what the DOJ is up to, but it’s important that we know who’s in charge of the indictment. We want to help.”
For his sanity, he tries, for the rest of the day, not to think of Tony and what might be going on inside the Speaker of the House’s head.
“They’re not going to know because we’re not going to tell them,” he says softly standing up. “And the President is not going to tell anyone either.”
Not that she’s complaining about her present life or anything. She and Thor have a wonderful marriage, clouded only by the fact that they can’t seem to get pregnant. Both of them have done all the tests and doctors could find nothing wrong with either of them, but it’s been almost ten years. That kind of frustration can get to a person. They’re trying not to let it get to them.
He can practically feel her rolling her eyes. “Shut up, Stark.” There’s an affectionate tone to her voice, so he knows he’s off the hook for now. “Congratulations on the win—76 percent of the vote. That’s something to be proud of.”
Tony looks at her, clearly distressed. “You’re wrong if you think this is something personal.”
“Not very much, no. I had a…pretty tough childhood.”
She shakes her head. “No. Are you?”
Jane, however, was a much longer story—it took Thor an entire year to get her to see past the proud, self-absorbed heir-presumptive to Asgard Realty that she thought he was (and she may have been right for a bit there). He befriended Erik Selvig, her mentor and adviser, whose company he found that he thoroughly enjoyed. He showed a genuine interest in her causes by attending fundraisers, dialogues, and protests. They became friends in his second year, and it wasn’t until his final semester that she finally agreed to go on a date with him.
But apparently they weren’t with the President, because when they arrive minutes after Tony and his team do, they’re coming from the lobby. Maria Hill does not look happy—she shoots daggers at Tony the moment she lays her eyes on him, which is to be expected. Tony, being Tony, responds with a flying kiss, which pisses her off even more. Pepper motions him to restrain himself, but it’s obvious that the exchange amused her as well because she doesn’t try too hard to stop him.
“But that only means that the investigation is serious if Carol isn’t willing to talk. And if Rhodey’s not talking either, then the DOD must be involved, or else I’m straight as a ruler.”
Anne and Clint watch as Henry gets out of the car with Darcy and Kate, all three of them bringing what Clint assumes are more food items to be consumed for Thanksgiving dinner. All three are laughing through their conversation, and, despite being an agnostic, Clint can’t help but say a little prayer of thanks for the privilege to experience this kind of warmth during a holiday that more often than not he had always been indifferent to.
And because Kate is Kate, she decides to just take advantage of the situation. “Please tell me you’re working on an upgrade for my phone.”
Clint eyes widen in realization. “And Coulson said,
Wade grimaces into his drink. “Hands around the neck have suddenly lost its kink factor.”
“We’re running out of time,” Natasha states. “We need to find an avenue where we can hit two or more birds with one stone before interested parties realize how far we are.”
Peter nods vigorously, a manic smile on his face. “Yes! I just did!”
“There’s a reason why I am where I am,” Natasha replies nonchalantly. “You want to ask about Clint, so go ahead. Ask me.”
He asks JARVIS to switch off the lights in his workshop as he goes up the stairs back to his living room. It’s late, but tomorrow’s a big day. There is much more work to be done.
Tony rubs the back of his neck, a little hesitant. “It’s an old project. I’m trying to miniaturize a theoretical design that could potentially produce unlimited clean energy. This is just the skeleton frame of the arc reactor.”
“Why, were you expecting otherwise?” she challenges.
“Doesn’t count, she works in the Senate,” she dismisses.
As they mill about preparing for the big dinner, Clint marvels at how easily they fit into Darcy’s Puente Antiguo life. Kate banters with Anne and Henry effortlessly, and they in turn do not hesitate to dote on their daughter’s paramour. They laugh so freely—something Clint hasn’t seen his best friend do for a while now.
Tony extends his arms. “Miss me?”
Cassie shrugs. “You were alright.”
“Stop apologizing,” Tony reassures him with a smile. “I’m going to ask you to let go now,” he continues slowly. “Cassie might be back any second and I want to be able to explain this to her without the shock factor of seeing us making out.”
“Tony,” Kate interrupts him in the middle of his rave. “Shut up. As your assistant, I am advising you that that would be a terrible political move. As your friend, I’m telling you that that is just tacky when a bottle of your most expensive wine will suffice.” He huffs but stops talking.
“No, you’re not.” She prevents him from turning away by gripping his forearm. “Do you even know what you’re getting yourself into?”
The press conference outside the White House was an accident that Tony had decided to take full advantage of. Under normal circumstances, he would have lorded it all over everyone who was watching (especially Hill and her lackeys, who were
But with this news, perhaps the Democrats can’t celebrate just yet.
When Tony answers the door, astonishment clear on his face, Steve can’t help but return the reaction. He had never seen Tony out of an immaculate suit, and here he was right in front of Steve, in nothing but a dark MIT tank top and a pair of gray sweatpants. He could have never imagined the Speaker of the House so attractive and still so imposing dressed down. In fact, he was even
"I've got your files from this afternoon’s meeting ready for you to bring home," she says. Clint is currently slipping his laptop in his bag but takes the time to scrunch his nose and press a knuckle against its bridge. In his opinion, they had taken too goddamn long arguing about absolutely useless things earlier that afternoon.
Fury cuts her off. “And if you continue to become a roadblock for the betterment of this country then I swear to whatever god that is you worship that we will paint you and your ragtag team of self-serving assholes as the cause of every single problem in this country.” He stops to recollect himself. “I’m sure Stark and Romanoff will be able to get behind me on this one.”
“About five hours. You certainly gave me a fright.”
When he and Rumiko are back in their seats, he slowly leans towards Tony, placing his hand gently on his lover’s back, and whispers, “Will you stay the night?”
“Right back at you, Rumiko. I thought you had exiled yourself from this swamp when you and wonder boy broke up,” he responds, his tone of voice slimy and condescending.
Tony simply shrugs. His promiscuity is probably the worst-kept secret in Washington. “Just trying to lighten the mood. You have grim expressions on your faces.”
“I understand your disbelief. I truly do, Mr. Stark. You’ve been in politics much longer than I have and probably can’t distinguish sincerity from schemes anymore. I get that. But please just stop for one second and try to get past all the politics because I want to start governing. And call me crazy but I actually think you want to do the same.”
Clint chuckles. “Darcy’s never been your typical anything.”
“These days don’t have to be the bad ones for us, you know,” Kate replies softly. “Is Darcy the reason why we haven’t hung out in the past six months?”
They sit there quietly for a few minutes, with Kate resting her head on his shoulder, her hand on his thigh and his hand on hers. She’s missed this, missed being together like this—no words needed, just their presence and awareness of each other. She has missed her best friend above all else, and it feels good to be like this again, even if it’s just for a brief moment.
Pepper tries again. “I know it’s none of my business, but—“
Dugan clears his throat. “Sir, we’re five minutes out,” he informs Tony, and Tony peers through his window to see that they are already within Capitol grounds. Like 60% of the time, he is not looking forward to another day of being the Speaker of the House.
Steve has a hard look on his face. “Good morning everyone.”
“Oh, please. I know you’ve been having sex for three days straight. It’s time to take a break.”
“Cassie’s a book monster. Growing up she devoured book after book after book,” he explains. “This used to be the dining room. I had it renovated when she was about six—at that time her room already had piles of books, and she didn’t want to give any of them away. A library was the only solution.” Tony smiles at the memory. “She would spend hours here, just curled up with a book. More often than not, she’d fall asleep—on the sofa, the armchair, even the floor, and I’d have to carry her back to her room.”
Steve knows that he can’t, so he settles for honesty. After all, that’s the foundation of the arrangement anyway. “I want to believe that they can change their mind, Tony. I want to believe that they will be able to see reason.”
“Hey boss!” Peter greets.
Steve steps out and beams at him. Relief washes over Tony. “Hey yourself. Come inside. I made tea.”
I’m afraid your daughter has beaten you to the punch, sir. The results have already been forwarded to the R&D department.
“You don’t think he’s done that? The guy looks like he’s about to keel over, and it’s only been three weeks since Thanksgiving. This investigation is sucking the life out of him. The man lives alone, Tash, with no one but a voice in the ceiling to keep him company. No, look at me.” Clint puts his hands on her shoulders, looking at Natasha square in the eye. “There are almost a dozen other members on this team, Tash. You have to trust the rest of us to do the dirty work for you. Tony can’t bear to disappoint you so he keeps saying yes, keeps pushing himself for you, because you forget that you have me, Pepper, Thor, Janet, Darcy, and Kate. Hell, even Wade will walk through fire for you if you ask him.”
"What? Is that about— wait, your sweetie pie? She's my assistant!"
Tony raises an eyebrow. “Um, you and Darcy…?”
“Richard Parker’s been compromised.” It’s Matt Murdock. “One of his handlers is a double agent.”
“Hey.” Tony gently lifts his chin. “This is not unwanted. Far from it, actually.”
Tony breaks into a genuine smile. “Oho, look who has turned the tables. My, you learn quickly.”
Steve gives him a tired smile. “I’m exhausted, for one.”
We saw it coming long before they did.
“You better call Carol after you write that check, Stark,” Natasha commands him.
“Wow,” Jessica declares as she inspects her new phone. “This is really serious now.”
Elektra takes the last swig of her tequila. “I’ll see what I can do. But Matt, you owe me.”
“And Scott would love it, which would make it a hundred times more fun.” They both dissolve into laughter.
Cassie leaves the two men alone and they fall into a heavy silence, trying not to meet each other’s eyes. After weeks of radio silence, Steve doesn’t know how to approach him, let alone begin apologizing for what happened during that disastrous afternoon in the Oval Office.
For a moment Tony thinks Steve has forgotten that they’re in a room full of other people and not just on the phone. Lucky for Steve, Tony almost never forgets to stay in character because he’s always putting on a show. He flashes the President his campaign smile, the one that’s won over his district for six consecutive elections. “When am I never?”
Henry nods and does as he’s told. “I’ll set the table once I’m done with this,” he volunteers as he exits towards the garden.
“What’s up, Uncle Tones?” Cassie asks, not taking her eyes off her laptop.
“’A dried-up harpy with a stick up her ass.’ It was horrible. And he also called the President a Ken doll, did I tell you this?” The horror is clear on Pepper’s face as she remembers the meeting. “I don’t think it was meant as an insult, though. I think he was flirting with him, which is even worse.”
“What dealings does it have behind the curtains?” Thor asks.
Sharon grimaces. “Ew, no Steve, I love you, but I don't need to know about your sex life.”
“Am I really?” he challenges her.
“This is where things get interesting.” Matt signals to Foggy, who shuffles the documents around and picks out two sheets. “Alchemax’s main headquarters are in Johannesburg and they have no subsidiaries in the United States, but Foggy and I looked through everything that Elektra gave us and whatever was publicly available on AIM. We found one name that appeared in both files—Wilson Allan.”
Steve sets his brush down and turns around, a big, goofy smile plastered on his face. “Hey, you.” He stands up to take Tony’s face in his hands and give him a kiss. “I’ve been wanting to do that all night.”
“It takes some getting used to,” Tony comments, trying hard not to laugh.
“Please, that’s totally not what I—“ Steve struggles, all flustered and embarrassed.
“Danvers is dating Rhodes, who is Stark’s best friend. Or did you not get the memo, Nick?” Natasha says with a groan, clearly tired of the whole charade.
Natasha says nothing, which prompts Pepper to continue. “It’s like he has a plan that he’s not sharing with anyone else. I don’t know. I just don’t like the fact that he seems to be acting alone on this when we should be working together to grab this victory by the throat.”
Tony wonders why he ever thought that it was even remotely possible that he could have been ready for this meeting.
“You’re doing alright?”
“Please don’t encourage her,” Tony tells him with a groan. “Besides, technically we’ve only done this dinner eleven times. Did you really get 2300 on your SATs, or did you pay someone to take it for you?”
Pepper nods. “Alright. I’ll talk to Janet as well. The boys are a little too loyal to him, so I’ll leave them out of the loop for now.”
“Give me Stane,” Rumiko says suddenly, the forcefulness of her tone surprising everyone on the line. “I can deliver him.”
It's easy enough to hate those from across the aisle, but no one ever told them that it was bad news to fall in love with the enemy.
I’m sure it can wait until we’re done.
Coulson tilts his head, a knowing smile on his lips. “Don’t play coy with us, Natasha. We know all your tells.”
“Not at all, sir.”
“People think we’re all that, but we’re really just a bunch of misfits,” Clint adds with a little humor.
“Don’t fret, lovelies, I have you covered,” Rumiko assures them. “I’ve just stepped away for a moment to scan the room. Besides, I think it’s all part of his act.”
No… JARVIS, what the hell is going on?
“I work in the United States House of Representatives, Pep. All that shit is cray.”
Bruce leans back on his chair and eyes the President carefully. “I was wondering how you had been able to get around Congress without going through our kids at Congressional Liaison.”
“Can I help you, Ms. Romanoff, Senator Barton?” the man asks, his voice deep and vigilant.
SPEAK FOR YOURSELVES
Tony gestures to the inside of the house. “But what if we—“
“That’s awfully nice of them,” Pepper says, amused.
“God, I can’t believe you two are ganging up on me. Should we use this time of reflection and giving thanks to stop verbally assaulting Tony Stark or do you both want to starve tonight?”
She returns the smile. Hers, though, is a sad one. “They’re ready to call Florida.”
“I’m a
“Okay. I trust you. Thank you, Tony.”
Which means we need a plan,” he explains to her with a manic glint in his eye. “My house, tonight.”
He kisses Tony and it feels like a tsunami of emotions flooding inside him. Tony’s body is warm against him, and his lips are pliant and responsive. God, he’s wanted this so badly. It’s not just about the arousal of kissing someone, but that moment that you’ve finally found an equal in another person and just want to be with that person. For the past few months, Tony has challenged him in so many ways, and today, seeing him love someone else’s daughter as fiercely as if she was his own, has challenged him to become a man that deserves to be a part of that.
“You realize that this is me trying to divert the subject.”
“Someone has to keep you boys in line,” Natasha reminds them in a dull tone, completely ignoring the hidden meaning behind Tony’s reaction. “I’m assuming you’re taking someone with you, Stark?”
“You sure you won’t get into trouble for this, Hoover?” Tony asks her with mirth, but concern still clear on his face.
Twenty years and two beautiful, wonderful children later. Well done, guys.
for this.”
“Find a way to get on your State’s department delegation.” He drinks the last of his wine and sets the glass on the table. “Wakanda is the only place we can talk.”
“For all that the Republicans say about you…“ he steps closer, their faces less than a foot apart, “…that you’re a philanderer, a drunkard, a selfish bastard, a liar, and a traitor—“
be a productive member of this Congress.”
He doesn’t know if he’s right, or if he’s once again forcing himself to see the good in Tony. Steve is hoping it’s the former, because no matter what public perception is, Tony is truly a good person. That much he knows, at least.
“By the way,” Steve says, after a minute or so. “I wanted to ask you if you could be my…I don’t know how to say this…escort? To the state dinner for the Italian Prime Minister.”
Perfect.
Tony snickers. “We’re going to have a Republican administration. I don’t think there is a silver lining.”
“Why, should I be? Is she a clingy bitch?” Sharon teases.
“I heard. Catching the bad guys, saving the world, all that jazz.”
But please tell your brother he’s not allowed to take photos.
Jane looks over to Pepper. “Darcy may be crazy, but she’s not delusional. And as eccentric as Erik Selvig may be, he doesn’t joke about Loki. They have a history.”
“Willing to say that on the record?” Tony asks, as if to test Steve.
“Steve—“
“I actually have an idea, but it’s a bit desperate and will require a lot of faith on your part,” Tony tells him calmly.
Everyone claps and Tony catcalls as Janet does small bow. “Thank you, thank you. All in a day’s work, my friends.”
It's easy enough to hate those from across the aisle, but no one ever told them that it was bad news to fall in love with the enemy.
Tony tries to dodge her attacks, but to no avail. “You said we were good. What happened to good?”
Wade lets out a low whistle. “Damn. The big leagues.”
Pepper answers Happy’s question with a dry laugh. “Not after the one last June, and I’m pretty sure never again. At least, not with the House Republicans in the same room.”
I was five when Dad and Pops adopted me. I don’t remember much of my years in the foster care system—nothing dramatic happened, mind you—but I knew, even at that young age, that I didn’t have a home.
“According to the Constitution, sure. But I believe the spirit of both positions is the same. The only difference is that I have the codes to our nuclear arsenal and you don’t. But then again, you have to deal with Congress every single day, so that makes us even.”
Tony looks at her wistfully, but wipes off that expression the moment it lands on his face. “I wish we had more time for sentimentality, but it’s not exactly a long drive to the White House,” he says, breaking the softness in the air. He hands her a small plastic container. “I need you to put this in your ear.”
Now he sits in a private room where they have placed Jane, his hands above hers. Frigga is outside the room discussing Jane’s accommodations with the nurses, leaving Thor to the torment of his own thoughts.
“Fine,” she says curtly as she presses the button to answer the call.
“Tony Stark,” he answers tersely.
“Secretary Wilson is just doing his job,” Killian says in defense of Sam.
“Since the shutdown. Remember when the press ambushed you before you entered the White House? I was watching that whole bit with Natasha. She figured it out.”
“Aw, you know me, Romanoff. I often reach out to others. Asking for help in times of need is part of the human experience.”
Darcy eagerly looks at Clint, as if to ask for permission. He nods once, and Darcy turns to the team again. “It’s Alexander Pierce.”
His phone rings again, ‘Tony Stark’ coming up on his caller-ID, but he ends the call when he settles in the driver’s seat of his Prius.
Steve looks at him inquisitively, eyes twinkling in the dim light of the library. “Of course. She’s family.”
The atmosphere in the White House the next morning is so tense you can cut through it with a knife.
Cassie scrunches her face, displeased. “Fine.” She extends her hand. “Let’s shake on it.” And Tony accepts gladly.
Pepper Potts. We’re going to make history,” Hammer tells her, his eyes gleaming with excitement.
Tony finds himself pulling up in the driveway of the Executive Residence at nearly one in the morning. He gets out of the car, hands the keys to the Secret Service agent who opens his car door for him, and enters the residence with no welcoming committee to take his coat. It’s a routine he’s starting to get used to, one that he and Steve agreed on some days after Thanksgiving—to not bother the staff if Tony ever came to the residence at night.
“I’m only messing with you, Steve,” Tony teases. “I’d be honored to be your date to the ball.”
Janet jumps in. “Did you ever figure out where Oscorp got their vibranium?”
Steve turns to Cassie. “What’s wrong with him?” he asks jokingly.
“They gave me a name,” he tells her as he reaches in to his jacket pocket and hands her the napkin that Carol had given him.
“I know you are. So am I.”
“I don’t think ‘like’ is a proper—“ Something catches Steve’s eye.
“Of course you didn’t, and that's not what I'm saying at all. I’m just sorry that I put you in a difficult position. The same goes for Tony and Kate and everyone else who had to tiptoe around me because I couldn't get a grip.”
Come to bed, Tony. I’ve got plans for you.
“I suppose you both know why you’re here,” Fury tells them in a bored tone.
Ooh la la, another chapter, and it didn't take me months this time! Things are escalating and there's some excitement and intrigue in store for our favorite superheroes. Hope you guys have been paying attention in the previous chapters ;)
Kate groans in frustration, ignoring her boss’ teasing. “Tony, come on. Be serious for once. It’s important that you listen to me.”
"Shut your dirty mouth, Barton." Tony makes a show of reaching over and grabbing Clint's drink. Clint plays along and draws his hand back, snickering at Tony's half-assed attempt. They settle down eventually. Tony ends up on the countertop, legs crossed and tie loosened. Clint is doing his fair share of minding his own business. Today, that means telling himself to forget about Natasha and then doing the exact opposite of that. He knocks back the rest of the scotch and grimaces when he tastes that Tony has completely watered it down. Tony nudges his arm with the bottle.
“Huh,” Matt responds with a thoughtful tone.
“Doesn’t sound like you’re happy with him.”
Tony shakes his head. “I know, but I can’t initiate the meeting. Not if Fury is watching us.”
