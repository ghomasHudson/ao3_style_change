“You really... you really want to do that?” Steve asks, cheeks pinking even darker. Tony nods emphatically, because duh, he loves Steve, and his voice. He could definitely get off to it, easy. “Okay.”
“I told him,” Steve whispers to Bucky later that afternoon. They’re in the common room at a table, watching Tony, Clint, Sam and Natasha play MarioKart and argue.
It’s another half-hour before Tony’s bladder very pointedly reminds him that it needs to be emptied,
He doesn’t even make it to the bathroom. He speed-walks directly to his dorm room and unlocks it with shaking fingers. As soon as he steps foot in his room, he’s peeing freely into his jeans, a warm wet spot blooming around his crotch and slipping down his left thigh. The relief is impalpable. He has to collapse against the door once he’s slammed it shut behind him. He doesn’t even care that he’s wetting himself, not now that he’s in private. He’s too caught up in the fact that his bladder is finally emptying.
Tony asks himself. He likes watching Steve desperate, sure, but does he want to see him actually lose control?
Steve had found out about this on their six-month anniversary, when Tony had shown up to dinner fifteen minutes late and nearly crying while spilling apologies. Steve had actually forgotten what the date was, but Tony was a complete mess at the thought of missing their date or even being a little bit late. Steve had worked it out of him that he had this bizarre fear from watching his parents fight about it. He’s petrified of becoming an asshole like his father (Tony’s words, not Steve’s).
It’s such a minor thing, and before Tony might not focus on it, but now his eyes dart to Steve’s moving leg like it’s a bright neon beacon screaming ‘
why you’re letting Tony follow you back.” Clint elbows Steve in the ribs, giving him a smirk. “Not because you have any sexy times planned or anything, right?”
desperate. So one day, while Tony is in the shower, Steve sneaks into the bathroom to pee. He’s full, but not bursting, and it takes him a minute before he’s able to go, but he does. Tony doesn’t say anything, but Steve joins him in the shower afterward since his mom isn’t home, and he smiles at Steve before offering to suck him off. Overall, it's a great reaction.
His mind is finally distracted enough, or his bladder is desperate enough, and the pee releases in a rush. It mixes with the water rushing over Steve, and even he can’t hear it over the shower, so he keeps going and going and going, slumping with relief against the wall. He’s been holding for hours, and he finally lets it out.
“I’m gonna wet the bed if we don’t stop,” Steve says. “I want to hold it, babe, but I’m seriously about to lose it.”
Tony slides back into Steve’s dorm room, taking in Steve’s obviously more relaxed attitude and the half hard chub he’s got under his jeans. He mourns the fact that he’s already come for a second before he remembers just how mind blowing that orgasm was, and then all he wants is to get on his knees and return the favor.
“Don’t apologize,” Tony says softly. He tilts Steve’s head up from where it was hidden in Tony’s shoulder so they can look into each other’s eyes. “I love you. I don’t want you to be in pain. This doesn’t bother me. Go, if you can.”
“Cool, I’ll invite Pepperpot, Rhodeybear and Bruciebabe, too,” Tony replies, pulling his phone out and texting one handed.
. Fuck. He was right, it’s too much pressure. He feels like he's on a clock. He’s thinking about Tony coming back, now, and all he wants is to release before that happens but who knows when he’ll be able to -
“Steve, honey.” Tony softens even more. He pulls Steve close again, but not into a hug. He presses against him but keeps their eyes connected. “There’s nothing wrong with you. This is just... something you deal with. Something I can help you deal with. Lord knows you help me deal with all my shit. And, I’d say mine is much more annoying than a little pee.”
“Me too, Steve, me too,” Tony gasps. He speeds his hand up, so Steve does too, and Tony keens high in his throat. “Dammit, fuck, I love you, Steve.”
Tony helps Steve to the bathroom, because Steve is walking slightly hunched over with halting, careful steps. Steve trembles at the sight of the toilet, a clear invitation for him to release but he can’t do that. Tony turns the shower on, adjusting it to a comfortable temperature. Steve is stripping his clothes off next to him, and even though they’ve been naked together more than a few times at this point, this feels more intimate than anything they’ve done thus far.
“So good, yes, that’s it...” Tony is pressed up against him, so Steve feels it when Tony hardens in his boxers. “Steve, oh god... you’re doing so well, keep going...”
“Oh my god,” Steve mumbles, collapsing back against the bed. Tony grins. He looks well and truly fucked out. “That was amazing. I don’t know what I did to deserve that.”
Of course he wakes up full. He usually wakes up pretty desperate to go, but yesterday he’d probably done some amount of damage after holding it for so long. So, this morning he wakes and he immediately wants to run for the toilet, but he knows he won’t be able to go with Tony in the next room. Even if he somehow got up without waking his boyfriend, he’d still be nervous about Tony hearing.
“I know,” Steve finally relents. “The bathroom thing. But I’ve been getting better! I can go with you in the room now-“
Steve’s still peeing in tiny amounts, but it’s coming quicker now, so Tony keeps kissing him. He makes the kiss even dirtier, and presses his body closer until they’re sliding together deliciously under the warm water from the shower. He just hopes Steve doesn’t get hard from this, or he’ll really be unable to pee.
Tony laughs a little, but not to be mean. “You’ve never done this before, huh? Neither have I, but we both know I don’t have any shame whatsoever.”
“You don’t look like you’re studying anymore,” Steve says with a teasing half-smile. Then he cuts his eyes over to Sam and Bucky, still somehow making out at their table, books long forgotten. “Wanna get out of here?”
“You have to pee,” Tony says bluntly. Steve cringes, eyes shutting as the words hit his bladder like a physical blow.
— before the stream finally trickles off and he can tuck his cock back into his pants. The embarrassment doesn’t hit until he looks up and sees Tony’s surprised face, complete with beet red cheeks and an open mouth. The faucet is still on, and Tony’s hands are under it — he’d been washing his hands when Steve busted in and he’d just paused and never finished.
“Thanks, baby,” Tony says to Steve, waving to Rhodey. The group splits up; Rhodey, Pepper, Thor, Loki, and Peter head to south campus, while Sam, Bucky, Bruce, Nat, Clint, Steve and Tony all head to north campus.
Steve gives him that little bit to push him over the edge, sucks just a little harder around Tony’s cock and thrusts his fingers just a little further inside. Tony’s whole body tightens up and he comes with a low wail, spurting down Steve’s throat. Steve, unable to wait a second longer, follows him and comes messily into his boxers.
. It’s so good the way Steve squirms, even though he’s trying to hide it, and it’s getting late now and Tony
They probably won’t have sex now. Even if Tony isn’t totally disgusted by the pee thing, he probably isn’t turned on by the sight of his boyfriend crying and covered in his own piss. Steve hopes not. He’s not in the mood anymore, anyway, he feels fragile and small and vulnerable, but under that happy, too. Tony is staying with him, somehow, and that’s amazing. And Tony’s staying the night. Even without sex, that’s something Steve never quite let himself hope for. Before, he’d thought he would have to somehow train himself to hold it for over 24 hours, but now... now Tony seems okay with it. Just like Bucky was. Bucky had turned out to be surprisingly helpful, when he’d found out. Steve was still young then, so Bucky helped him rush home after school and not get picked on. Or he helped him hide wet pants when he was out and just couldn’t hold it anymore. He remembered after telling Bucky, he felt relieved, like suddenly he wasn’t alone in this. And he feels the same, with Tony, now. He feels more honest, too, and he doesn’t have to worry about offending Tony when he leaves dates suddenly, or can’t invite Tony over. Actually, he
Tony can’t help but follow Steve’s orders, and he comes hard into his fist, hips canting up as he chases his pleasure over that peak. By the time he comes down from his orgasm, Steve is panting heavily over the phone while he whispers sweet nothings.
“But, Steve... the whole night? I don’t want you to hurt yourself. You don’t have to-“ Tony says, but Steve cuts him off.
So he follows Steve back to his dorm room and makes out with him for awhile on his bed. He should really leave for awhile so Steve can pee, but his desperation is really doing it for Tony. At one point, a wave of pressure must come over Steve because Tony feels him slide a hand between them and squeeze at his crotch for a half second. It’s over quick, Steve pulls his hand away as if burned, and Tony pretends not to notice.
Steve’s therapist is elated when he tells her. She mentions that maybe he’s made some sort of breakthrough and he’ll be able to use public restrooms one day, but Steve isn’t really holding out for that. He’s just glad he’s comfortable enough to pee in front of his boyfriend.
Tony hums a little, pressing down harder, and Steve manages to unclench enough to let a spurt out. He immediately clenches back up at the sound, but Tony’s already murmuring reassurances.
Steve cuts him off by shaking his head sharply. “I’ve known Bucky for 15 years, now, and I still can’t go if he’s in hearing distance.”
“No, I’m sorry,” Steve sits up abruptly, looking so apologetic and guilty that Tony is thrown. “I completely ruined the moment with my... issue.”
Steve feels his cheeks flush, but he doesn’t answer. He figures Tony is just half-asleep and not deliberately being mean, especially when Tony’s eyes snap back open, and he quickly apologizes.
“The walls are very thin,” Steve says, trying to sound nonchalant, but his voice is trembling as much as the rest of him. Tony pulls him close, trying to comfort him with soothing touches and soft-pressed kisses.
is holding him back. So, in the back of his mind, he plans to spend the night at Tony’s. He doesn’t pick a specific date, he just waits for the perfect opportunity.
Though, he does try one more time to pee while Tony is in the bathroom with him. Just to test it; maybe the first time he was just
“Baby, it’s gonna be amazing,” Tony grins, sitting on Steve’s bed and patting the spot next to him. Steve sits gingerly, wincing at the new position on his bladder.
Tony’s cheeks go pink, and he turns wide eyes on Steve, but he’s got a smile growing on his face and his arms are tight around Steve’s mom when he returns the hug. She pulls back after a moment and fusses over him, fixes his hair and tightens his scarf.
“Yeah, I get there picture,” Bucky cuts him off before he has to say the words, for which Steve is grateful. “So, he knows, huh? And he’s okay? He didn’t run screaming?”
He tries to quickly make his way back to his dorm, but his need is getting critical now. His bladder is swollen out from his abdomen, a visible protrusion between his hips, and he feels like the piss sloshes inside him with every step. He’s just over halfway there when the first leak jets into his boxer-briefs, and panic makes his chest tight.
And Steve does keep going, no way he’s stopping now unless someone else came in, and by some miracle, Tony isn’t turned off by him. Tony, in fact, is aroused behind him even when they’d had mutual orgasms a few hours earlier. Even when he’s
“Okay. Why don’t I take the lead, hm?” Tony suggests, lying back in bed. “I want you to try to relax, Steve. If you’re not already, lay down in your bed.”
Steve laughs, a little nervously, and winces as his bladder pulses, still waiting to release the rest.
“How are you feeling?” Tony whispers, his eyes worried, as they climb into bed. Steve curls around the bend of his bladder, closing his eyes against the throbbing pain.
Everyone is tired from traveling, so they go to bed pretty early. Now, Steve is really hurting, he has to go
“Okay. So this has happened before,” Tony says, trying and failing not to hypothesize how many hours Steve has been holding a full bladder. It’s one in the afternoon, now, so at least fifteen hours, since Steve sent his goodnight text at ten last night. Maybe more, maybe less. “What do you usually do?”
“I swear, you don’t have to...” Tony says, but then Steve slides a finger into him and he moans lowly and his whole body relaxes pleasantly.
“He’s fine.” Tony is beside him all of the sudden, taking his hand. “I’m taking care of him, I promise.”
. He hasn’t been back to his dorm room all day; he went to classes at 9 am, and then to the library with Bucky, and then met Tony for dinner and a movie in the rec hall, and then they went to get ice cream, and got caught up talking, and now - now it’s 11 pm and it’s been fourteen hours. Shit. It’s a good thing his boyfriend is so goddamn distracting, but even Tony isn’t enough to overpower the pangs from Steve’s bladder at this point.
“Hey, we have plenty of time for that,” Tony responds. “I don’t think you could’ve waited, honey... and that’s okay! Trust me, I had an excellent time thinking of you. Really, really good. I had zero self control and had to jerk off in a nearly public place because you are absolutely
“This is the best Christmas vacation I’ve ever had!” Tony declares, not even ten minutes into their journey. Steve smiles at his boyfriend's bouncing excitement and flushed cheeks. He’s so glad he invited him.
There’s no annoyance or unhappiness in his tone, but Steve wilts a little at the words, and he vehemently shakes his head no. He’s still painfully aroused, he still wants this. He can hold it, it’s fine. He held it for way longer last night, anyway, so he knows he can do this. He doesn’t want to ruin this moment, the first moment they’ve been able to have. Tony pauses a moment, eyes scanning Steve’s face to make sure, before he continues what he was doing before. Steve notices he shifts his hips back down a little more, though, and it has the dual benefit of not rocking into his bladder anymore and pressing them together, cock to cock. They moan together, the sound vibrating against Steve’s skin, and all at once he’s getting close again.
Bucky rolls his eyes at all of them. “Guys. We’re college students. We’re all heading back to have sex with our partners, if we have them. Because we're young and horny. The end. Sam, follow me.”
Thankfully, he’s able to get rid of his boner (by thinking about Clint naked) before Steve notices. But that might be because Steve is so blissed out and completely gone that he wouldn’t notice anything in the state he’s in. By the time he’s done peeing, Steve is practically a puddle that Tony is struggling to keep standing.
They eat dinner together while sitting on Steve’s bed. Tony tries to keep a casual conversation going, and if Steve notices he’s struggling with a full bladder, he doesn’t say anything. An hour passes, and Tony still has to go,
“Holy hell, of course I was watching you,” Tony says, leaning in to kiss Steve’s neck. “I couldn’t take my eyes off you, Steve. You’re so hot, so fucking sexy, watching you squirm.”
Steve sniffles a little, calming down at the presence of Tony’s calm. “Because I wanted to. I want you over, I just - I can’t.”
The comfortable, wet heat surrounding his cock isn’t his own piss, it’s a mouth. His hands fumble for a moment under the covers, and then his fingers are twining through familiar soft locks. And he’s still peeing - he’s
They head back to Steve’s dorm even though it’s a farther walk. Tony can feel his bladder pounding is his abdomen with every step and he’s convinced that this is the most desperate he has ever been. But then again, he thinks that every time he has to pee really bad.
Bucky leaves them alone, saying something to Tony that Steve doesn’t catch. Tony turns to Steve, then, and brushes his free hand against his cheek.
So, he stays a little longer. Steve moves to his desk and works on a drawing of Tony, while Tony pulls out an engineering project that’s not due for weeks but he’s been working on anyway. They’re working on completely separate things, and they’re not even talking, but there’s a quiet intimacy to the way they can share a space and silence like this.
The answer to that is probably yes, but Tony is beginning to care less and less. This kink, that he didn’t even know he had before Steve, is beginning to take over his life. Because his boyfriend is desperate every damn day, and he enjoys it so much, Tony thinks about piss all the time. Too much.
Tony’s grip tightens on his dick abruptly, and he has to stave off orgasm then and there. “Fuck, Steve. Anytime. Seriously.”
He wants nothing more than to get a few fingers up Tony’s ass, stretch them as wide as Tony can take, watch Tony go wild with pleasure. He also thinks about filling Tony with something else,
Tony is practically sprinting across campus as soon as he sees his boyfriend’s blond head, ignoring the stares from his peers as he weaves through them in order to reach Steve faster. And when he does, he launches himself forward to hop directly onto Steve’s back, delighting in the way Steve catches him with barely more than a stumble and a soft “Oof.”
“Great!” Tony exclaims, already rushing back down the hall to the elevator. “I’ll be right back! Love you, honey! See you soon!”
They reach the lab and it’s still open for another hour for the engineering students. Tony lets them in with his keycard and shows them the two robots. Steve stands back and watches, mostly, and Tony doesn’t miss the slight winces and near constant weight shifting going on. Steve has got to be desperate now, but he hasn’t said a word, and he won’t. They spend some time playing with the ‘bots, Tony explaining how he made them learning robots and their code, mostly to Bucky who’s the most interested in that sort of thing. It’s the reason he and Bucky get along, now, since at first Bucky was a little annoyed Tony was stealing his best friend. But then they bonded over science and became friends too, and eventually Bucky realized Tony had a crush on Steve the size of Mount Rushmore, and he wasn’t really jealous anymore.
“Where are we headed, sugarplum?” Tony asks when Steve pulls away and keeps walking, shifting Tony into a more comfortable position on his back.
“Tony, I’m fine. I love spending time with you, you know that,” Steve said, feeling his face heat as he thought about what else he was about to say. “And I already told you that I - that I want to... that I’m attracted to you.”
“I’m - I’m getting pretty close, honey,” Steve admits, eyeing Tony’s arousal hooded eyes and swollen lips.
His arousal comes back with a vengeance, now, while he’s making out with Steve and feeling his piss run down his thigh, so close to his dick. He wonders for a second what it would feel like directed at his cock, and quickly has to shut down that line of thought. He definitely doesn’t want a boner while his boyfriend is trying to release hours worth of pent of piss. Except that, he totally does, because the idea of Steve holding for hours definitely does it for him, as long as it isn’t actually hurting Steve in the long run. This is obviously torture for Steve, though, so Tony reigns in his hormones.
“Wow, your room is bigger than mine, and you have a private bathroom?” Tony says, looking around at Steve’s things. “That’s just unfair. Discrimination against young, skinny geniuses. I’m suing the school.”
, yes,” Steve mumbles behind the door, and that’s it, Tony’s orgasm washes over him and he releases in long bursts right into his briefs. They were already ruined anyway. He has to bite down on his free hand to avoid screaming out his pleasure. His knees really do give out after that but Steve must not hear the faint thud he makes as he sags bonelessly onto the carpet. Or maybe Steve’s still so relieved that he doesn’t notice.
“W-Well, y’know,” Steve mumbles, and he feels his face heat as he shifts on his feet, half from nerves and half from desperation. “If tonight goes well, then...”
“You go. I’ll wait. You have to go way worse than me,” Tony decides, even as one of his hands disappears between his legs to give himself a squeeze.
Steve shudders, eyes fluttering closed, and Tony really can’t help but kiss him gently. He keeps it chaste, using it as a comfort. Still, Steve can’t seem to relax enough to release again.
a good morning,” Tony hums when Steve pulls away. “I could get used to this, you know. I wish we didn’t have to get out of bed.”
Tony isn’t quiet. Especially when something like needing to pee is pressing on his mind over and over again, and Tony’s motormouth is spitting whatever’s on his mind as it comes. Steve usually finds it endearing. Usually.
Oh. His bladder is protesting again, and loudly. He needs to go, right now. He shifts uncertainly. He doesn’t want to ask Tony to leave, not after that. He also doesn’t want to take the time to shower and leave Tony alone. He really just wants to cuddle up with his happily sated boyfriend and go to sleep, but he can’t because his bladder is full and his brain is stupid and won’t let him go.
Steve blinks. Of course Tony would want to sleep over, they’ve been dating for a month and a half. He really should have seen this coming. Actually, he's been thinking about Tony sleeping over (or him sleeping at Tony's, but that could never happen with the shared bathroom in his suite) for weeks now. He’s so focused on the idea of sleeping next to Tony - or sleeping
“Uh, what?” Tony blinks, coming to a stop in the middle of the sidewalk. A few students sigh noisily as they’re forced to walk around him. “I mean, of course! If you want to. Do you want to? Are you
“Goodnight, Tony,” Steve murmurs, kissing his ear. Tony mumbles something unintelligible in reply, and Steve grins.
He thinks it might actually kill him, and he can’t help but palm himself through his pants, biting down on his lip to keep from moaning out loud in the middle of the hallway. Thank fuck no one is around because Tony is practically giving a free show out here.
Tony had to come, Bucky was 100% on board. Tony is Bucky’s friend as well, and Bucky is fiercely protective of his friends. Steve wouldn’t be surprised if Howard Stark got a punch delivered to his face in the form of Bucky’s fist in the near future. Not that he would support that behavior.
“Are we almost there?” Tony asks, handing the water back to Steve. He takes it, and tries not to squirm as he puts it back in his bag.
desperate. He glances at the clock on his desk and sees that it’s nearing midnight, meaning he hasn’t peed for fifteen hours now. But he can’t just say he needs to pee. He’s never been able to say that out loud, let alone to a significant other. Maybe if Steve pretends he needs a shower. That’s a good excuse, right? And he could take as long as he wants. And maybe,
Their room has an attached bathroom, which no one but Steve hesitates to use. Tony is first to go, making apologetic eyes at Steve. Sam and Bucky each take a turn too, and then Bucky is herding Sam out of the room with the excuse of going to check out the game room. Steve is grateful for it, knowing Bucky is just trying to leave Steve and Tony alone so that Steve can try to pee. He’s also a little embarrassed that he’s doing such a bad job at hiding that he needs to go, though.
“Sorry,” he says. “I know it’s... it’s a problem for you. I mean, it’s not - it’s not fun for you, I know. But I just, I like... when you’re desperate.”
Steve expected it to be difficult. He’s not really used to being able to pee right away, it usually takes him a minute or two to feel comfortable enough to let go. But with Tony kneeling in front of him, waiting for it, wanting it... it’s the easiest thing in the world to just release.
Suddenly, Tony lights up. “I’ll run down to Bruce’s dorm. He’s got a single with an attached bathroom, too, and he’ll let me use it. Then we can go at the same time, yeah?”
Tony bites his lip, still squirming in place. He’s been in constant motion since leaving the theater, and Steve envies his easy movements that his body wishes he could carry out. Finally, Tony shakes his head.
Steve finally finishes, and immediately his cock starts to harden a little in Tony’s hand. It really isn’t his fault; he’s relieved, and Tony’s nearly naked, pressed against him and holding his dick. Tony tries to slide away from him, but Steve grabs his wrists, keeping Tony’s arms circles around him.
Steve and Tony are three years apart, which isn’t really a big deal in college when everyone is an adult anyway. But Tony came to college at fifteen, and was immediately granted enough initial credits that he came in as a sophomore. The age thing was a slight issue in their relationship. Steve wouldn’t even kiss him until he passed the legal age of consent in their state. And he was going to hold back on the sex, too, until Tony was eighteen, but Tony broke down one night and asked if it was because Steve wasn’t attracted to him. Steve told him, with an embarrassed flush, that his attraction wasn’t an issue at all, and that he very much wanted to have sex with Tony. So, they fought about it until Steve realized Tony was as much as an adult as he was, and now it wasn’t so much of an issue anymore.
Tony’s eyebrows pull together, and he doesn’t move. Besides his squirming at his delay to the bathroom, Tony doesn’t move at all to go any further without Steve. Then, abruptly, Tony understands, and he turns and walks out to stand next to Steve.
“It’s, uh, across the hall,” Steve says, conveniently not mentioning his own need. Tony ducks into the bathroom, and as soon as he’s out of sight, Steve’s hand reaches down to grip at his cock to keep it from leaking. He can’t tell if his underwear is wet or if he’s imagining it. He squirms in place for a moment, bobbing up and down to get his bladder under control. It wants release now, and even though he knows standing outside the door means he’ll be able to hear Tony going, he can’t help but wait there to be let inside.
Steve knows something is wrong when Tony doesn’t show up for dinner. He’s gotten better at not losing himself completely in his engineering lab work, and he never,
Well, it’s pretty hot. Tony’s not mean, though, and he can see Steve is dying to pee, now, but he can’t help it, he doesn’t want this to end yet.
They’re always in Steve’s room. Which is fine, just, Steve feels a little bad for Tony when he has to walk all the way to the opposite end of campus in the mornings to get his books for class, or change his clothes, or something else. The engineering building and lab is on that side of campus, so even if Tony brings his books to Steve’s the night before, or borrows Steve’s clothes, he still has to walk all the way across campus to go to class. But they love sleeping next to each other. Not even the sex, though they love that too. They love the intimacy and comfort from sleeping next to somebody you’re in love with. So Tony stays the night almost every weekend, and usually a couple times during the week too.
Anyway, his classes are pretty boring. Which is why when his phone buzzes during hour two of his lecture, Tony doesn’t hesitate to pick it up. Everyone else is scribbling down notes furiously, hands shooting up to ask questions, but Tony learned this when he was fourteen. He just needs the degree to say he’s qualified so he can get a job, because there is absolutely no way he wants to work for his dad.
Tony’s eyes widen, and before he knows it, he’s over by Steve, rubbing his back comfortingly. “Why? What’s... what’s wrong? Why can’t you...?”
And then his bladder squeezes so tightly in his abdomen that he can’t hold in a low groan. So, that’s what woke him, then. Now that he’s paying attention, his bladder is unbearably full, and he feels like he’s constantly a second away from wetting his pants. Actually, it feels a bit like he may have already done so, but that’s not possible. Steve reaches a hand down to his crotch, and -
“I’ll just take a quick walk, okay?” Tony says, and gets up. But then he looks down at the obvious tent in his pants. “Oh.”
The train ride is rather boring, though, once you’re into it, and Bucky falls asleep once they’re on the main train to New York. Steve and Tony chat for a bit, but Steve is soon nodding off — he’d been up early that morning to finish an art project that he had to hand in just an hour before their train left.
Tony feels heat burn through his body like nothing he’s ever experienced before. He’s so close he feels like he’s about to burst, which is ironic, because Fantasy-Steve loses it. A wet spot blooms on Fantasy-Steve’s jeans, spreading quickly, and eventually the pee makes a small puddle around Fantasy-Steve’s feet. Fantasy-Steve’s face goes slack in relief, and he moans long and low. Tony, although confused as to why his fantasy shifted to this, comes so hard and so quickly that he’s almost sure he blacks out for a few seconds. When he comes back to himself, he’s practically covered in his own come. His limbs feels like limp noodles, and he can barely move to clean himself up.
“-and that’s a huge improvement for me! I just want to be a normal college kid for, like, a few days,” Steve pouts, slumping back on his bed. Tony immediately softens, coming closer to stand in between Steve’s legs where they’re draped off the bed.
regrets drinking that now. He’s pretty full, a lot fuller than he should be at this point of the day, and he knows there’s no easy solution. Tony is watching him, Steve can feel his eyes on him, but he doesn’t say anything.
The ten minutes pass quickly, luckily, and soon enough they’re boarding the smaller train from Penn Station to Brooklyn. This train ride is less than an hour, and Steve feels a little better at a time frame for his bladder. Though his stomach does clench nervously at the thought that Tony will be in his house, too, which means he might not be able to go.
Something settles in Steve’s chest at the sight of Tony in his bed, fully clothed, just lounging like he belongs there. He suddenly fiercely wishes they lived together, even though they’re still in college, even with his issue. He wants it so suddenly that he feels dizzy.
She bounds down the stairs and wraps Tony in a hug the same way she’d wrapped up Steve a second ago. Steve really wasn’t kidding when he said his mom already loved Tony. And as a nurse in a children’s hospital, she has learned many skills — she could see a child in need of parental love a mile away, for example, and Tony was a textbook example of that.
Once Tony accepts the fact that he has a piss kink, and a large one at that, there’s no way that he can’t notice that Steve is
But when he thinks of that, he thinks he can hear Steve rushing into the bathroom and a wave of arousal comes over him again. He throws his head back, carefully avoiding hitting it on the door, and he gives in to the temptation to slide a hand into his pants and stroke himself carefully.
“Hey, no, it’s okay. We can have phone sex once you get back, if you want. I can be patient, I swear,” Tony says quickly, even though a second ago he was fully planning on jerking off as soon as Steve left.
He panics for a moment, thinking about his sticky pants and how he’s going to explain that to Steve. But then he remembers that Steve saw exactly how wound up he was, even if he didn’t know the extent to which he had caused it. And he doesn’t really have time to wait in the hallway and think up a plan anyway, because he hears someone’s door open and promptly gets the hell out of dodge.
“Good morning,” Steve responds, and leans in to kiss him, morning breath and all. His bladder is still protesting, but he thinks he can wait until Tony leaves.
So, all this to say, it’s concerning when Tony doesn’t show up to dinner. It isn't a planned date or anything, but Tony had said earlier that he'd be at dinner. Steve checks his phone five times to make sure he didn’t miss a text from his boyfriend. He heads to the engineering lab after eating, with a to-go bag of Tony’s favorites. Sure enough, Tony is there, and he’s hammering away at some piece of metal. Loud rock music blaring across the lab and there are no other students here.
“Fuck, Steve, you’re so full,” Tony says in his ear, sounding a little dazed. “You’re bladder is as hard as a rock.”
Tony whines a little, his movements getting slightly more desperate. “Ugh, no. You’re not waiting another second, do you understand me?”
Anyway. Steve has to go pretty much all the time, and Tony loves it. But he’s still a little guilty, though, because he knows Steve isn’t holding his pee because he wants to, because he enjoys it. No, he’s holding it because he has to, he has no other choice. Which, to be honest, sucks for Steve, but is it so wrong for Tony to enjoy it?
Steve tucks his head down in shame, and he can feel his body shaking. To make it worse, as he’s standing there, a spurt of piss leaves him. There’s no way to hide it while he’s naked and it trickles down his leg all the way to the floor. He wants to disappear.
long to get going. He brushes his teeth and leaves the bathroom, then he gets dressed and waits for Tony to return.
First, Sam takes the train and the bus to Bucky’s, and then the four of them cram into Bucky’s tiny, outdated car that he got for Christmas, and make their way towards the ski resort that Pepper found in Massachusetts. They decide to leave the week before winter break ends, so they can stay in the resort for the last week and head straight back to Boston for school. Natasha, Clint, Rhodey, Bruce, Peter, Pepper, Thor, and Loki are all going to meet them there. Luckily, the drive isn’t too long, but they stop early on to get snacks and drinks, and Steve is having too much fun sipping on his root beer to remember that he is heading to a new place where he will probably be sharing a bathroom.
Something inside Steve jolts at Tony’s easy admission that he needs to pee. He’s not sure if it’s jealousy or something... else.
“Not yet,” Steve admits. “I don’t see her until Tuesday, so I’ll tell her then. She’s been telling me to open up about it to Tony, though.”
Tony catches on pretty quick, as soon as he pulls back to look at Steve. It might be because Steve can feel his face turning red with a flush that has nothing to do with arousal and everything to do with embarrassment. Or the way Steve had to squirm a little under Tony in order to fend off the wave of desperation.
“I’m not uncomfortable, either,” Steve defends. “Just, y’know, I could do with a bathroom break soon.”
“Right,” Steve agrees slowly. Tony is being a little weird, but then again it’s the middle of the night. He shrugs it off and drags Tony into a heated kiss. He reaches a hand down to toy at the waistband of Tony’s boxers, grinning into the kiss when Tony shivers a little.
Tony going, hears the desperate rush of piss into the toilet, and his bladder spasms wildly. He has to go way worse that Tony, he’s sure, and he wishes he could’ve just
The ride flies by, even with Steve’s full bladder. Bucky and Steve entertain Tony with stories of past Christmases spent together. It became a tradition for the Barnes to spend the holidays with the Rogers family, ever since Steve’s dad passed and Bucky’s dad ran out on his family. Their moms tag-teamed the holiday to make it a little easier, and Steve and Bucky got the added benefit of spending Christmas together. They have plenty of stories to tell Tony, and he’s laughing along with all of them, but Steve can’t help but notice that Tony offers no stories of his own. He knows Tony was raised a lot differently than him, knows that his family dinners were quiet and uncomfortable, not boisterous and enjoyable. But he hates moments like this, when that difference shows in Tony’s strained smile, his hurting eyes.
Steve flushes a little as Bucky grins in congratulations at him. “I, uh... well, it sort of happened accidentally. Literally. As in...”
Tony’s hand flies around his dick as he answers, unable to slow himself down. “I’m - I’m close, Steve. Fuck yes. Yes, I’d love that.”
Tony is well aware that Steve can be a total troll. But this is just uncalled for. Maybe he is just as depraved as Tony.“You - you’re way too good at this. You set me up.”
“I know,” Steve says back, pulling Tony back in to keep kissing. This time his hand slides in Tony’s boxers, and Tony gives a strangled moan. Tony is rock hard, leaking pre-cum already. Steve doesn’t know if it’s the fact that they’re in a place they could be caught or if Tony really got that turned on just from touching his dick, but he doesn’t really care to know either. He’s more focused on getting his boyfriend to come as fast as possible.
Steve grins as Tony starts taking off his pajamas and changing into real clothes. He puts on his own pants from yesterday, but he pulls on one of Steve’s t-shirts. “Me too. I love you, Tony.”
“Of course I want to,” Steve huffs, and Tony smiles. He hears Steve’s breath hitch, probably as he touches over his nipples, and then a soft moan. Tony gives an answering groan as he mirrors what he tells Steve to do.
Steve just shakes his head. He already knows he won’t be able to use any bathroom besides his own, which is across campus, so he should get moving. He moves to grab a pair of Tony’s sweatpants but grips them in his hands instead of wearing them. They’re a light gray, and he’s terrified that he’ll leak if he puts them on and it’ll be so obvious. And they’re
naked, I want you to wrap your hand around your dick. In a light grip, stroke yourself, but go slow.”
Steve is very uncomfortable, but not about Tony sleeping over. He sees his escape, but Tony has this look in his eyes, one that Steve is all too familiar with. He’d been trying to erase this look from Tony since they’d met and become friends - this look that says so much about what Tony thinks of himself. He thinks he’s annoying, and useless, and a million other things that make Steve protective and angry. It’s hard to hit the bully, though, when the one bullying Tony is himself. Steve wouldn’t mind delivering a punch to his dad’s nose for good measure, though. The point is, Tony pretty much thinks he’s worthless and undeserving of love. But in the years of their friendship, Steve (with the help of Pepper, Rhodey, Bruce, Bucky, Clint, Natasha, Thor, Sam, and Peter) has managed to show Tony that despite what he thinks of himself, Steve and the others love him anyway. The self-recrimination had made a reappearance when they’d started dating, though, and Steve can see the insecurity here, now. And he hates it.
He can’t get Tony out of the room. Tony would think it’s his fault, which is out of the question. He could just try to go, maybe this time it would work. He’s
Tony’s in the middle of imagining Steve getting back to his dorm. In his head, Steve’s just a second too late, and he’s so beyond desperate that he starts leaking in his pants as soon as he closes his door behind him. He’s broken the seal, now, though, and he can’t hold it anymore, so it comes streaming down his leg, wet patches blossoming -
“Tony,” Steve says on a harsh whisper, but Tony just shushes him again. He gently taps Steve’s hands until he lets go, and Tony holds Steve’s cock instead. Steve doesn’t really know where this is going, there’s no way he’ll be able to go when Tony’s right behind him,
“It won’t work,” Steve mumbles, but he already knows he’s going to give in. Mostly because he has no other choice, he will wet himself if he tries to get all the way to his private bathroom. Even now, he has to grab himself to keep from leaking a long spurt down his leg again. “But I’ll try.”
Tony’s not thinking about that, though, he’s focused on giving Steve the best pleasure he can. Even if he doesn’t know it, Steve deserves it, after the orgasm Tony just had in the hallway. And Tony may be feeling just a little guilty at having that much pleasure at his boyfriend’s expense. So, he hollows out his cheeks and sucks, taking more of Steve down his throat. He moves a hand to Steve’s ass to push him further so he’s really fucking Tony’s mouth now and Steve keens. Tony bobs his head, swiping his tongue across the slit on the head and tasting a little salty pre-cum.
Except that his boyfriend has paruresis, which means he might be a terrible person for getting off to probably the one thing Steve hates most in the entire world. It’s something Steve struggles with everyday, and here Tony is jerking off to it in his room. Truly despicable.
He can also see that Tony is nervous — he’s twisting his fingers together and one of his legs is shaking side to side and hitting Steve’s knee every so often. He’s reassured Tony a hundred times over that his mom will love him, his mom
He quietly approaches Tony’s phone, not Tony himself, because he’s still holding that hammer and swinging at the metal like it had done something personal to him. He switches off the music, and now he can hear the way Tony is heaving sobs. Tony blinks in shock at the sudden silence, his head swinging around to look at Steve. His eyes are red rimmed and swollen, his face twisted into an angry frown, but that melts when he connects eyes with Steve. The hammer is dropped onto the table and Tony slides to the ground, wrapping his arms around his legs and pressing his face into his knees.
His bladder is sending increasingly urgent pulses, and he feels a spurt leak into his underwear. He freezes, then, and hisses under his breath as the pressure inside grows and grows and grows until he’s sure he can’t possibly take any more, and then it finally fades away to something more manageable. And it is so cruel that Steve has a bathroom
way. Tony sweeping in means that Steve doesn’t have to worry about anything at all, and Steve feels a very pleasant sinking feeling overtake him.
“Oh god, holy hell, Steve,” Tony babbles, effectively distracting him. “Honey, you’re so good at this. You feel so good.”
As soon as the bathroom door shuts, Steve is hopping from foot to foot, a hand flying down to grab his dick and squeeze. Christ, he’s still desperate, even after losing some of it in his pants. He stumbles over to the toilet, setting the clothes he brought by the sink. He pulls himself out and waits... but nothing. He still freezes up, no matter how badly he has to go, thinking of how he’d been able to hear Tony going so Tony would probably be able to hear him. He sighs, strips his clothes off and hops in the shower instead. He stands under the water and tries to lose himself in that, instead of the thought of Tony waiting for him outside.
He leads Tony to the bathroom, and they both strip down. Once Steve is naked, his body very much wants to let go, and he has to hold his now-soft cock as Tony finishes undressing. Tony’s eyes are still huge and focused on Steve as he kneels in the shower.
Steve’s legs are crossed under the desk and every so often, he’ll squirm in the chair or his free hand will disappear into his lap. So, knowing this, Tony makes a very stupid decision.
and Tony thankfully doesn’t realize anything is amiss because he’s usually doing most of the talking anyway. But there’s times where he’s purposefully quiet to let Steve talk, too. Steve really appreciates that Tony can tell this is not one of those times.
Yeah, Tony would love that, if he doesn’t come in his pants soon. Steve looks fully desperate, unable to help little squirms, and his fists keep clenching the bedspread under him every so often, his legs going tight together.
Tony leads them back into his room, and back into bed. Steve is still a little curious as to what got Tony so worked up, but he trusts his boyfriend to tell him one day if it’s anything important. Or he’d just find out.
He loves the feeling of having Tony’s cock in his mouth, loves the feel of him on his tongue, the feel of Tony’s fingers pulling his hair. He’s so hard that his jeans are uncomfortable, so he reaches down to unbutton them, and wiggles them down and kick them off. He’s still in his boxers, and he’s tenting them, he’s sure, but he doesn’t look down to check.
“I’m gonna go pee real quick, and then I think we should change into pajamas. Or nothing. We could sleep naked, if you want? Think about it.” Tony winks, disappearing into the bathroom.
Steve really hates his traitor mouth. Except, he doesn’t, because he means it. He’d love to have Tony stay over in his dorm, if only he could
Tony’s brow furrows. He hasn’t talked to Steve today, but that isn’t abnormal. They usually meet up after classes, always get dinner together. Or, more likely, Steve will bring dinner to the engineering lab for Tony. Unless they have a planned date, Tony usually forgets what time it is as soon as he’s in the lab. Steve doesn’t mind, but he likes to get Tony out for dinner every once and awhile, hence the planned dates.
Tony makes a noise of complaint as he climbs off Steve, but heads to the bathroom as directed. Steve takes a moment to make sure his legs will hold him up before standing, legs shaky after such an amazing orgasm. He takes a step towards the bathroom and -
“You’re not a freak,” Tony says, more concern leaking into his voice. He pulls Steve close into a hug, ignoring the wet spot on his pants. “Hey, we’ve all been here, you’re not a freak just because you peed your pants.”
Tony strips out of his own clothes, since it’s only fair, and then comes back to his phone. “Okay. Now that we’re
Not that he’s doing it while Tony’s in the room all the time. It’s enough to just know that Tony’s in the next room and he can still pee, even though Tony might be able to hear it through the wall. He still gets anxious about it most of the time, and his brain stops him from going, but he can talk himself into relaxing now. Before, if Tony (or anyone) was anywhere near enough to be able to hear him going, Steve would lock up and not unlock until he knew he was alone. Now, he can slowly relax his muscles and let go.
Steve comes back enough to get himself out of the shower and towel off. They get dressed; Tony puts on some of Steve’s clothes because he wants to feel comfy and he loves stealing Steve’s shirts. Once they’re clothed, Steve spins Tony around to face him and kisses him.
He’s hopeful, but he doesn’t really expect Steve to say yes. Steve rarely ever comes to Tony’s dorm, unless it’s pretty early in the day, which used to really worry Tony. Now he knows it’s because Steve can’t use the bathroom there, and by the end of the day he’s pretty desperate to go. So he’s not really expecting Steve to agree, especially because Tony
Tony shifts in his sleep, soft snores ending, and Steve knows he’s about to wake up. Soon enough, Tony wakes with a cute scrunch of his nose, and blinks sleepily at Steve before his face lights up with a smile.
“Steve likes when I surprise him!” Tony says brightly. He grins at Bucky while resting his head on Steve’s shoulder.
“Hey, wanna sleep over?” Steve asks, cheeks going pink. His eyes are soft and so blue, his smile curling up the corners of his mouth. Tony loves him so much. “We could get breakfast.”
“I don’t think that’s allowed,” Steve snorts. He sets his suitcase against his bed, and reaches for Tony’s to put it next to his own. He shifts from one foot to the other; he’s got no issue letting Tony look around but his bladder is practically screaming at him to empty it. He’s already leaked into his pants once, and he really doesn’t want that to turn into anything worse.
Steve can’t stop moving his legs the whole time Tony is in there. His jiggling them both furiously, anything to stop the pee from coming out in his pants. He can’t help but think about how long he’s been holding now — thirteen hours? Fourteen? Oh, god, he’s just dying to go, now. His bladder feels full and round in his abdomen, and he’s
but he can still hear his friends talking through the wall, and he doesn’t know how to get Bucky and Sam to leave again so that he could even try to go.
Steve’s door opens, and Steve stands stiffly in the entrance to his small dorm room, back straight and body so tense he looked ready to snap. He doesn’t smile or anything at the sight of Tony, just keeps his expression blank. Tony’s heart sinks. Maybe Steve’s mad at him for some reason? But then why skip class? They don’t share any classes.
“Me too,” Steve whispers after he finally pulls away from the hickey he’d been sucking onto Tony’s neck. Even in the dark he can see where it’s beginning to purple and it sends a jolt of arousal through him.
“Tony,” Steve breathes after a little while. “Tony, if you - if you want to do anything else, we’re going to need to stop.”
“Oh, where’s your bathroom? I have to pee,” Tony interrupts, turning back from where he was studying one of the pictures Steve had painted last year, an image of Tony creating robots.
Tony, because they haven’t done that yet - that he automatically says, “Yeah, sure,” before he even knows what’s happening.
Because that’s what Steve is focused on, now. All he can think about is Tony relaxing in a nice (but affordable) resort. No one deserves a good vacation like Tony does, and Steve wants nothing more than to give it to him.
Steve gets the door open and they go inside, and Steve flinches at the sight of the closed bathroom door. He thanks his past self for closing it, at least, so he doesn’t have to see the toilet.
. Yes, absolutely,” Tony says. “As long as I can return the favor. Tighten your grip and speed up, because I need to come,
Meanwhile, Tony keeps cupping his cock in one hand, and the other hand he moves up a little to press gently on Steve’s bladder. Steve groans, jerking in Tony’s hold.
Steve nods a little meekly. He’s still trembling and he leaks down his thigh again. “Yeah. It’s, uh, pretty bad.”
Steve lives four houses down from Bucky, so it doesn’t take them much longer to reach his house. His ma is standing on the front porch waiting for them, bouncing up and down in excitement and because it’s below twenty degrees and she’s in her slippers.
Tony’s engineering classes are so easy for him that he could probably teach them. But his advisor said he had to stick out the whole semester in them in order to pass, because he was already younger than everyone here and she wanted him to have at least somewhat of a normal college experience. Getting to do whatever he wanted and skip every class and basically get handed his degree didn’t allow that. Or so she says, anyway.
It’s not like he’ll do anything about it, though. He can’t tell Steve, because he would just think Tony’s lost his damn mind (which wouldn’t be surprising, but...). So, is it really that bad if he’s not hurting anybody? He’s just having mind blowing orgasms. And people get off to kids! People beat their meat to
Tony grabs his wrist. “Look, I know you don’t use any bathroom but your own, but you’re desperate. Please, try, for me?”
UTI. Steve shudders. He’s had far too many bladder infections in his life. When that happens, he calls in sick and sits in the shower and works hard to convince his body to release only to have a trickle of urine come out. All while crying, usually.
“Yeah, but...” Steve is turning red, he can feel his cheeks heating. “She could tell I liked you. And she told me she approved.”
So Tony strips, too, and steps into the shower with Steve. He lets Steve lean against him, even though Steve is a considerable bit heavier than he is. He listens to Steve’s ragged breathing and waits for his pain and desperation to be relieved. He’s never felt so helpless.
“Sure!” Tony chirps, clearly misinterpreting Steve’s anxiousness to get back to his room as excitement.
Steve turns without a word, but leaves the door open, so Tony scurries in behind him and shuts the door. He places the soup on the desk and stands awkwardly in the middle of the room, watching Steve. He doesn’t seem sick, but something is clearly not right.
“You didn’t ruin the moment.” Tony’s brow furrows. “The moment is still good. Great. Excellent. My boyfriend and I just gave each other mutual handjobs. I’m ecstatic.”
And, finally, it comes on a random Tuesday. Tony can’t spend the night because he has a project due tomorrow which means he has to be up early to go to the lab and make finishing touches. Steve doesn’t have class until noon tomorrow, and no upcoming art assignment deadlines. And it’s getting late but his bladder doesn’t feel filled to the brim like it usually does.
And maybe it’s weird to say that in the bathroom of Steve’s house, but he can’t help it. He’s just done something totally monumental; he hasn’t voluntarily peed with someone else in the room or even within hearing distance in — ever? He, possibly, hasn’t ever done that before now.
which makes it all too easy to slip a hand inside and wrap around Tony’s dick. They stroke each other slowly, too keyed up for anything faster, their breaths mingling in the air.
Since Tony is huge on consent, like any good person should be, he immediately pulls back. His lust-addled brain can’t remember any reason Steve might need to stop, so he asks, “Did I do something wrong?”
“Plus, it’s nice out,” Steve says quietly, trying to distract his boyfriend and himself. He’s getting close to his limit, now, and he’s really freaked out after what happened the last time he’d held it this long. He’s been heading home at eleven at the latest, in order to save himself the embarrassment of wetting himself in front of his friends like he’d wet himself in front of Tony. But he couldn’t just leave in the middle of a movie, so he tried to limit his liquid intake throughout the day. Still, he felt like his bladder was begging him to go for the last half hour of the movie, and now it was screaming.
Tony’s eyes fly open, his hands pausing. He feels his pulse speed up, and the image inside his head changes abruptly. Now Steve is naked in bed, flushed from head to toes, hands following Tony’s directions.
“Oh, god, Steve, I’ve been waiting for this,” Tony says in a harsh whisper, sounding wrecked already. “Been wanting to do this with you for so long, baby.”
“Wait! Can we, actually, try something else?” Tony asks. “No one will suspect anything, they’ll just think we’re showering together, which, I mean, we would, after. But they’re all distracted with playing Mario anyway. You don’t have to say yes, feel free to tell me no, anytime really-“
“Yeah, I could come over for a little while,” Steve says easily. Tony schools his expression so that he doesn’t look completely shocked.
“I - I just didn’t expect it, and now I’m trying to pick up my brain from where it melted all over the floor,” Tony says. “Give me a moment.”
He leaves Steve’s dorm without peeing. And he knows it’s a stupid idea as soon as he does it, because the pressure in his bladder increases tenfold when he’s back outside and putting distance between the nearest toilet and himself. He actually has to stop for a second and bend at the waist and bob up and down a little to prevent a leak, and he’s just glad that it’s late enough now that no one is really walking around campus.
he’ll be able to go. A shower is loud enough to cover the noise, right? He used to do that when he slept over at Bucky’s, sometimes, but he also made Bucky sit in the farthest room from the bathroom while he did it. And only ever when Bucky’s ma and sisters weren’t home.
“Yes, I want to,” Steve says easily, ignoring the nerves tightening his stomach and the voice in the back of his head screaming, ‘
“Wait! I was - um,” Tony begins, and he’s the one blushing now, and avoiding Steve’s eyes. “I was hoping I could sleep over tonight.”
Not being able to go right away in the morning is a little annoying, but it’s worth it if he gets to wake up with Tony in his arms, he decides. And besides, it didn't take
He decides to hold it a little longer, and grabs another cup of coffee from the machine in the corner. He grabs Peter a cup, too, and Peter grunts at him in thanks. Tony settles back at his station, but he’s not able to focus the way he was before. His bladder is pulsating in his abdomen, sending increasingly urgent signals that it needs release,
Steve really tries to relax, but all he can think about is Tony standing right there behind him, able to hear everything. But if Tony wasn’t there, anybody could walk in, and that’s even worse. Steve tries to just block it out and distract himself, but the longer it takes, the worse it gets. He’s taking
It’s full, of course. It’s always full by this time at night. But he skipped his workout today, so he didn’t drink as much water as he usually does. Which means there’s less fluid in his body, making him less desperate. He sees this as the perfect time to try to sleep in Tony’s dorm.
“Hi, Tony,” Steve murmurs, turning his head so they can look at each other. Tony beams at him, and only smiles more when Steve presses a kiss to his lips.
“I want you to pee on me,” Tony breathes, cheeks only a little pink. He looks thoroughly debauched, eyes wide, lips red, clothes rumpled, hair sticking up. “If you - if you don’t mind. I’ve sorta been thinking about it for
where I can’t pee in front of other people or even when they’re in ear shot, so I cannot function unless I have a private bathroom all to myself.’ Because then everyone would know he’s some kind of freak, and would avoid talking to him anymore. And he especially can’t say anything about it to Tony, because, well, he likes Tony. He likes Tony probably too much and now they’re finally,
“I can’t p-p-piss when other people are around,” Steve admits in a tiny voice. He’s got a handle on his bladder now, he’s not leaking, but he’s still desperate. Now he’s desperate and wet and embarrassed and terrified, though, and this is the worst day of his life. Worse, even, than the time Bucky found him crying on the floor of the bathroom the first time he tried to sleepover at his house, covered in urine. Because Bucky had somehow stuck by him, even after that incident repeated itself several times, and he helped Steve with his issue. Tony, however, is definitely going to leave Steve for this. There is no way-
Tony feels a shiver skate up his spine at the sight, and it motivates him to hold a little longer. Plus, he feels a little bad darting off for a quick pee when Steve has to hold it.
“Love you Tony, you’re so amazing,” he says. “So beautiful, so smart. Can’t believe I’m with you, I don’t deserve you. You’re one of a kind, you know that?”
“The Barnes, yes I know, and I do,” his ma reassures. “But it’s not the same as having you home, Stevie.”
“Nah, I’ll just hold it,” Tony says, smiling a little at Steve. “Public restrooms are always disgusting.”
“Wait - no, no visible marks,” Steve pants, shoving Tony away lightly. “I’m seeing my mom this weekend.”
“Fuck, I have to go so bad, babe,” Tony mumbles as the doors open. He practically bounds down the hall to Steve’s door, bouncing up and down in front of it as he hurries Steve along. “Come on, come on!”
Steve pulls away to breathe, resting his forehead against Tony’s, and this time the burst of piss doesn’t end. It becomes a thin trickle, and then a thick stream. Steve goes practically boneless, and Tony is left holding him up with the help of the shower walls.
Anyway, they talk for awhile, but again, they’re already on the bed together. So it’s really just expected that they end up furiously making out. Tony’s still worked up from watching Steve in the library, and they’re both young adults, they have very high libidos. They keep the clothes on, at least, and hands above the waist for awhile. But they’re kissing messily, and Tony’s hand is trailing lower and lower down Steve’s chest when Steve suddenly pulls away.
“I distinctly remember jerking off in this bed, right here, while you were on the phone telling me you want to suck my dick,” Tony says, and Steve’s brain melts a little. Yes, he very much does want to suck Tony’s dick. “I suggest you do that.”
“I-I-I’m s-s-sorr-rry!” Steve gasps between sobs, hunching in on himself as if to hide. Tony catches his shoulders and straightens him back out, looking him dead in the eye.
Tony just blinks at him again, before a shaky smile appears on his face. “You mean it? I can stay in your house for winter break? The whole time?”
“You could have gone at the station,” Steve says, voice only a little wobbly. He’d give anything to be able to use that bathroom.
Tony throws himself at Steve, and luckily they're still sitting on the floor, because Steve barely manages to catch him in time. Steve doesn’t say anything, but he can feel his shoulder getting wet with tears again.
“Do you... want to watch?” Steve asks, feeling his face heat. “Or - or... did you want... like this morning...”
turned on. His hips are moving frantically, even as his mouth is mostly unmoving on Steve’s still-pissing cock, and then-
Tony blinks, trying not to moan as his dick jumps at Steve’s words. For a moment, all he wants is to hold Steve down and rut against him until he comes or Steve pees, whichever happens first. But even through the haze of arousal, he knows that’s wrong. Steve would definitely hate that, and probably think he some sort of perverted freak, which is not what he wants.
Tony kisses him, and Steve melts into him. He loves this newfound sense of being controlled, trusting Tony to be in control. It’s heady enough that it makes him feel almost lightheaded, although that could be from the beer or all the blood in his body rushing to his dick at once. Tony slots his leg between Steve’s, so they can rut up against each other, and Steve moans into Tony’s mouth at the friction on his cock. He’s so turned on, he can almost forget how much he has to pee. Almost.
Steve and Tony pack up their things and walk out together, leaving Sam and Bucky to suck each other’s faces off in the back corner of the library. They start heading back to their dorms and reach the place where they usually part ways, when Steve stops.
Steve frowns. “You know that’s not true, right? You’re not an idiot, or good for nothing, or a screw up. You’re the best, smartest person I know.”
Except, the thought of peeing where Tony could possibly hear him going doesn't fill him with dread anymore. He knows about Steve’s issue, and he doesn’t mind working around it, which lessens Steve’s anxiety an enormous amount. So Steve thinks, maybe, he'll be able to go while Tony's in the next room. But he'll just have to see when he gets there.
“Seriously, what’s wrong?” Tony asks, and he’s in front of Steve now, grasping his forearms. “Honey, you’re scaring me. Tell me what’s up.”
“Okay. But if you still can’t go, then I’m going to go for a walk. I’ll text you the whole time, stay in your building, but I won’t have you uncomfortable,” Tony says sternly, and Steve can’t resist kissing him. Tony, thankfully, kisses back, but it’s cut short by Steve’s bladder painfully reminding him to get moving.
Steve’s face is on fire, and his dick tries and fails to get hard in his pants again. “Me too. That’s - I want that too.”
“Got it,” Steve repeats dutifully. Tony pulls him in for a slightly-dirty kiss, and they both forget their conversation for a little while as they take advantage of having the house to themselves for a little while.
“-Tony?” Steve’s voice jolts Tony out of his thoughts. Steve’s probably been calling his name for awhile, if the way his brow is furrowed in concern is any indication.
“Oh, trust me. Steve gets plenty of nicknames. Right, sweetheart?” Tony asks, grinning at the flush rising on Steve’s cheeks. Steve loves his dumb nickname thing, especially when he turns the sweet ones on him. He presses a soft kiss to Steve’s warm cheek.
“Aha!” Bucky holds up a random blue pen. “Told Tony what? That you’re madly and completely in love with him? That you’re a total dork?”
It’s him and Steve, of course, because there’s no point in imagining anyone else when he’s dating the pinnacle of human perfection already. They’re making out, and instead of Tony’s hands on himself, in his head it’s Steve’s hands over his cock and buried inside his ass. His fingers would be way thicker than Tony’s, though, so Tony compensates by spreading his own so his hole stretches in a pleasurable burn. As he gets closer and closer to orgasm, the image in his head loses any tether to reality. Now he’s imagining Steve fucking him, making his hole loose and sloppy, and holy shit, it almost feels real with the way Tony is desperately thrusting his fingers against his prostate until it feels bruised. He fists his dick fast, twisting around the head, he’s so close now.
“Yeah, of course. Do you want me... right here?” Tony asks. He standing right next to Steve, and Steve shakes his head quickly.
“Okay,” Tony said slowly. He continues talking about his latest invention that he was describing earlier, and this time Steve can’t follow along because he’s thinking of a plan.
Steve makes a desperate noise. He’d been just about to-! Oh, who is he kidding, he was never going to get the courage to get up and go to the bathroom, even under the pretense of a shower. He just can’t do it. And now Tony is in there, doing the one thing Steve is dying to do, and it just isn’t fair!
As they’re leaving the dining hall where they’d just had dinner, Steve asks, “Can I sleep over?” He watches the surprise flit over Tony’s face.
The image changes again, and suddenly he and Steve are standing fully clothed in the elevator in Steve’s dorm building. Steve is squirming, clutching his dick.
, but they’re both way too far gone to do that tonight. They’d have to plan that, and probably get a few orgasms in beforehand.
Finally, Steve’s expression changes. His face crumples in a grimace and he hunches in on himself, sucking in a sharp breath. His hand flies down to his crotch to give it a firm squeeze.
“I - I have to pee,” Steve admits, cheeks aflame. “I’m afraid if I let this continue any long, I might not - y’know - make it back to my dorm in time.”
If Steve thought he was close before, it’s nothing compared to now. Tony’s hand feels amazing on him, and Steve knows it's calloused from working on his machines, but it's still somehow soft and warm around him. His grip is perfect, just a shade too tight like Steve loves, as if Tony knows exactly what he wants. Steve tries to follow the noises of pleasure Tony’s making in order to make it as good for Tony as it is for him, in order to get him as close as Steve is.
Tony doesn’t respond, but he moves down to Steve’s collarbone instead, retaliating for the delay by biting down gently. Steve gasps, arching up into Tony’s hold. Tony pulls back after a few moments and licks his lips.
He’s not entirely sure on the why, but Steve knows he wants Tony there with him. Something in him feels safer at the thought of Tony in this bathroom while he tries to pee than if he was alone.
Tony turns back to the sink and washes his hands quickly. He steps back to dry them on a hand towel, and Steve steps forward to wash his own. That’s when it hits Steve — he just peed while Tony was in the bathroom with him. He didn’t worry about it, didn’t even think about it; he just walked in and peed like he was completely alone and had nothing to worry about.
misses a date with Steve. It’s something his dad does to his mom, which Tony hates, so he tries really hard to be on time to every date and remember every anniversary and holiday for Steve.
“Hey, Tony, wake up,” he says, because there’s nothing he can do about his own need. “We’re stopped, do you have to pee?”
Tony sees Steve’s cheeks go pink at that, but he’s smiling and he’s still peeing, so Tony counts it as a win. Tony shifts a little to hold Steve better, and his stream moves to Tony’s inner thigh and -
“Love you too, To - Oh!” Steve comes with a shout, not considering for a moment that his neighbors on either side of them might hear. Tony’s not far behind, muffling a loud groan in Steve’s shoulder as his hips spasm into Steve’s hand. They’re both panting as they come down, and Tony winces as he pulls his sticky hand out of Steve’s pants. Steve has to grab his wrist with his own clean hand when Tony goes to wipe it on the bed sheets.
Bucky furrows his brow for a moment, before it hits him. “Oh! Steve, that’s - that’s great, really. How’d that happen?”
“Was the train okay? Steve said you hadn’t ridden it before, I hope you didn’t get motion sick or anything,” Ma says, bustling Tony up the porch stairs and into the house. “And I hope you’re okay sleeping with Steve in his bed — it’s a bit small, but we don’t have a guest bed and the couch is just awfully lumpy. I made some chicken and mashed potatoes for dinner if either of you are hungry. You probably are after all that traveling, right? Oh, Tony, you’re so thin, you must eat something. And Steve, you too! Have you lost weight, honey? If you don’t want chicken, we have canned soup, or bread and meat for sandwiches, or-“
Steve wails. His body is trembling from the combination of stress and anxiety and the fact that he’s still holding what’s probably gallons of pee. “I’m - I’m a freak!”
“Steve, that’s nothing. That’s barely bigger than my hand, don’t worry about it. I spilled more oil than that on the other end of the bed last week,” Tony says, and moves the blanket to show a large black stain where their feet had been. “And, this is gross, but Peter threw up on my bed at the beginning of the semester and I had to flip the mattress. This is nothing, babe.”
As fun as this little experiment has been, he absolutely does not want to wet himself in public. Not at all. So, he speeds up to the best of his ability, and finally makes it back to his building with damp underwear teasing his cock to just
But for now, Tony’s working hypothesis is that Steve has to pee. Pretty badly, if he had to guess, because it’s getting close to 9:00pm, which means Steve hasn’t been to a bathroom in twelve hours. Christ, his bladder control is
Steve wakes at three in the morning and at first he doesn’t even know what woke him. He blinks up at the ceiling in the dark, feeling Tony’s breath against his neck, and wonders why his dream about the two of them as superheroes was interrupted.
Steve’s not sure Tony fully understood him. He smiles fondly at his boyfriend. “Tony. We need to get up or I’ll ruin the bed.”
“Why does my father hate me?” Tony finally asks after awhile, and Steve’s heart breaks. He doesn’t know the answer, he
, and Tony’s waiting.... He doesn’t even notice that his breathing is speeding up and he’s getting close to a panic attack until Tony comes up behind him.
Tony makes a high-pitched little moaning sound, and Steve knows that noise. That’s the noise Tony makes when he has an orgasm, which means... which means Tony just rubbed himself off against the bed while Steve pissed in his mouth.
Bucky had complained about Tony tagging along for a little while after Steve told him Tony was coming, but once Steve explained
Steve has never spent the night in Tony’s dorm, for obvious reasons. He’d like to, of course. He loves Tony, and Tony’s room is littered with his half-finished inventions, and sketches of ideas, and equations scribbled down onto scrap pieces of paper. It’s the perfect reflection of Tony’s mind, and Steve itches to draw him in that space, just as he’s drawn him in the lab. He has a few unfinished drawings of Tony’s room, but he hardly goes over there anyway. He and Tony both have full schedules of classes, and when Steve’s not in class, he’s in the art studio, and the same goes for Tony with the lab. They fit in time with each other on weekends and at nights during the week, which means they’re usually in Steve’s dorm.
And he does. After a few hours, he comes out of the engineering haze for more coffee, only to realize that his bladder is protesting that he’s already had far too much to drink. He wiggles a little in his seat, biting his lip. Peter is sitting at the next table over, head bent over his project, which means Tony can't squirm all he wants to. He’s not sure if he wants to go yet, even though he really has to. His bladder is certainly full, but it’s a pleasant sort of fullness.
“Yeah, but I want to make it so good you can’t stand it, Tony,” Steve says. “I want to take as much of you as I can into my mouth, let you fuck my throat, until I can swallow all of you down. Would you like that?”
“Hey, baby, shhhh,” Tony soothes. He runs his hands up and down Steve’s tense back first, then slides them around to the front, going down and down until they’re over Steve’s hands, which are clutching his cock. What was once a grip to point his dick at the urinal has become a stranglehold to keep any piss from sliding out.
He and Steve are in the library with Bucky and Sam. They’re all supposed to be studying, but Steve is the only one actually doing so. Bucky and Sam are making out at the next table, and Tony’s about a second away from telling them to get a room or get the fuck out, when he notices.
He starts to notice other things, now that he sees the tapping leg. Steve has an empty cup from the small store right next to the library. It’s the biggest size, probably 40 ounces or something absurd like that. Steve is super ripped, and he works out every morning, even if it's just a jog. Which means his fluid intake is an insane amount, probably. So he has the super size cup, and it’s
Steve smiles at Tony in return. He’s noticed that Tony has been refusing to use public bathrooms lately, especially when he knows Steve has to go. If he’s desperate enough, he’ll head off to one, of course, but he’ll send Steve an adorable apologetic look. Steve appreciates the gesture; he doesn’t feel so alone knowing that Tony is holding with him. He doesn’t really care how weird that is.
Tony squirms on Steve’s bed, and debates using his bathroom. But he feels bad making Steve listen to him go, knowing he can’t just go after Tony’s done, he’ll have to wait until Tony leaves.
, he thinks. He was hoping for some semblance of normalcy, but nope. He wants his boyfriend to hold his piss and get super desperate and then release it all over him. And, now he’s getting hard, and he’s naked, and Steve is totally going to notice, shit.
Afterward, he sits down and contemplates. Because he definitely just jerked off to the idea of his boyfriend wetting himself, and he came harder than he has ever come in his life, and that probably isn’t normal. Right? He googles it. As it turns out, he has a kink. Now, Tony never really thought he would be particularly vanilla when it came to sex, but he’s not really very experienced. He’s not a virgin, but he doesn’t know everything about what he likes or dislikes yet. He’s still young.
Steve comes in around 8, three hours after Tony’s last class ended, and, honestly, he’s surprised he’s held his full bladder for that long. He’s not used to holding when he doesn’t have to. Steve is wielding dinner in to go bags, and although he would be willing to wait, Tony quickly packs up the tools he’d been using and leaves the engineering lab with Steve. Mostly because he doesn’t like making his boyfriend wait even if Steve says time and time again that he doesn’t mind, but also because he has to pee very badly now.
At first, they’re just talking. They were friends for a long time before they ever started dating (mostly because Steve wouldn’t date Tony until he was above the age of consent, but whatever). So they get along very well, and Tony finds Steve is the one person who can truly keep up with him. Tony has to explain the more complicated concepts when he's talking about physics or engineering, sometimes, sure, but once is usually enough for Steve to grasp it, at least enough to hold a conversation. And Steve isn’t afraid to go back and forth with him, which is amazing, and something he almost never gets. A lot of people see his money or his brain or his status and they turn into yes-men, and act like Tony is always right. He almost always is right, at least in his own head, but Steve isn’t afraid to point out that he’s wrong. Often. Which is probably why Tony fell in love with him in the first place.
“It’s a big test,” Steve says weakly. It’s a thin excuse, he knows, but he’s at the point where he’s so full he’ll do anything to get back to his dorm. He starts to get up, but Tony grabs his wrist.
They reach his door and Steve fumbles with the keys a little as Tony keeps chatting away. Steve is trying his best to at least make noises like he’s following along, even though his brain is focused on
He stares down at his pants as a wet stain appears around his hands, spreading quickly. He imagines the pee soaking into the bed under him, and stands in a panic. The new position only causes more pee to come out, and Steve doesn’t even realize he’s sobbing now. He’s really and truly panicking, trying to think of anything to stop this situation he’s found himself in. The door to the bathroom opens, and Steve has a moment to think, ‘
“Fuck, I have to pee so bad,” Tony moans, wiggling in place. They’re waiting for the crosswalk sign to change to the white walking man instead of the red hand that means stop.
So, Tony endeavors to distract him. He rubs his hands up and down Steve’s sides, his back, along his hips, up his chest, through everywhere he can reach. He gives some sort of weird massage with little pressure and lots of comfort, trying to get Steve to focus on that sensation instead of his bladder. He also talks while he does this, something he’s excellent at. He rambles about his classes that morning, and about his latest projects, and Steve releases what he can in small splashes on Tony’s leg every once and awhile.
He has barely enough coherent thought to remember Steve in the next room, and hopes like hell Steve can’t tell he’s stopped moving outside the door even though the whole point is for Tony to get out of range.
Steve knows that Tony’s offering to vacate his room for a little while so that he can pee. And he flushes at the thought of Tony knowing he has to go, but at least he doesn’t have to say it out loud or anything.
As much as he doesn’t want to, Tony makes for the door, tugging his shirt down to hide the spot on his pants. He makes it out of the room and collapses against the door, legs too shaky to hold him anymore. He’s
Tony pretends to finally get it, puts his mouth in a surprised O-shape. “Sorry, I forgot you might have to pee!”
“Oh, hush,” Ma waves him off. She hugs him tight for a few seconds before pulling away and turning to Tony. He’s still standing where Steve left him, a few steps away from the porch steps. He’s fiddling with his bag anxiously, and Steve aches to reach out and reassure him, but his mom has that covered.
Tony settles back on Steve’s bed, grabbing a random book from underneath it, as Steve grabs a change of clothes. He heads to his bathroom, sparing a moment to glance at his amazing, perfect, breathtaking, accepting boyfriend sitting on his bed (which is thankfully pee-free).
Tony gives a quiet little cheer and smacks a kiss to Steve’s cheek. He pulls on a pair of boxers while Steve slides into the sweats he’d been holding. He keeps one hand around his cock under the pants. Tony steers him out of his dorm room, down the hall, and into the bathroom. It’s quiet, no one else is awake, thankfully. The bathroom is empty but Steve still feels his muscles clench at the idea of trying to go here. Tony walks him right up to a urinal, and then turns to leave, but Steve grabs his arm.
“Aww,” Tony coos teasingly, but Steve can see his cheeks turning pink. “I’m attracted to you too, Steve. But I really want to get you into bed. For sex. Preferably soon. If that’s okay with you.”
love him, but not even that will stop Tony’s own brain telling him that he’s not enough. Steve just has to be patient and wait for his mom to show Tony that she thinks he’s as perfect as Steve does. Well, maybe not quite as perfect.
know the answer, because his whole world revolves around Tony at this point. He loves this small, brunette genius so much that he can’t comprehend anyone hating him, let alone the man who is
“I couldn’t... go today,” Steve croaks, face still scrunched in pain. All his energy was wasted in trying to keep the mask up for Tony’s sake, and now he’s drained. “I still can’t, and I haven’t gone since last night.”
“No problem,” Tony replies, a little dazed from the kiss. His dick is hardening again, he really needs to go jerk off or something. But with the way Steve is looking at him now, his eyes soft and grateful, he’s not going anywhere.
Tony blinks, and then rolls off Steve so he can get up. But Steve pauses before walking away. He’s swaying from foot to foot, unable to help the little movement, and Tony’s eyes are glued to him.
“Yeah?” Tony pauses for a moment, debating on whether he should reassure Steve that it was okay that he left, or just move on. He decides on the latter. “Tell me what you would have done if we could have gone longer, then.”
“Alright?” Tony whispers. Steve just moans. He twists a hand between them, too, to get a hand on Tony. Tony’s wearing sweats,
, just trust me, okay?” Steve says firmly, a little irritated because he’s embarrassed now. Tony shouldn’t have to worry about his boyfriend having to pee while he’s sleeping over.
“Yeah. I’m back,” Tony sighs. His stream finally dies out and he can feel himself getting hard in his jeans now. The wetting doesn’t really do it for him — but the desperation and the final relief definitely does. He can’t wait to jerk off to the memory of his own desperation — and Steve’s — in the shower.
Tony tentatively knocks at Steve’s door, one hand clutching the hot container of soup. He probably should have warned Steve that he was coming over, but he’s a little worried about Steve’s behavior. He doesn’t really keep anything from Tony, so his short reply would be enough of a concern, but he absolutely never misses class. The fact that he apparently voluntarily skipped today has Tony jittering anxiously in front of his door.
“What I’m trying to say is that I’m here for you. I can do whatever you need so that you feel comfortable, okay?” Tony waits for him to nod. Then he leans in, capturing Steve’s mouth in a messy kiss before turning back to the sink to brush his teeth.
When Steve gets in the shower, Tony turns to leave. He says, “Well, I’m gonna go,” but before he can even get all the words out, Steve stops him.
Steve is about to say no, he really is, but then his bladder clenches and he’s the one who has to squeeze himself, making a noise in the back of his throat. “Yes. Okay. Fine.”
Steve moans again, and Tony’s cock twitches in his hand at the sound. “I wish I’d been able to stay, Tony.”
It’s Friday, which means everyone met up for dinner around 7 and they ate together in the dining hall. Then, they decided to walk to a local movie theater that offers discounted prices on Friday. Now, it’s nearing midnight, Steve has been holding it for 14 hours, and they’re walking back to campus.
Steve laughs as he catches Tony sliding into the elevator with a slightly manic grin before disappearing out of sight. Then he rushes into his dorm and into his bathroom. He pulls himself out of his pants and waits and waits and waits -
But the new position has Tony leaning a little more forward than before, and when he continues rocking his hips against Steve, this time it’s into his bladder. Steve gasps, freezing under Tony as a wave of desperation hits him. It’s not as bad as last night; he doesn’t have to go nearly as bad. But he does need to go, because he hasn’t been to the toilet since that morning. He’s still full, and of course he didn’t forget about it, but Tony can be pretty distracting when he wants to be.
“Uh, everyone already knows both those things,” Steve rolled his eyes. “No, I told him about my... issue.”
He knows what Tony’s worried about: a week long trip with a group of broke college students means he definitely won’t have access to his own private bathroom, and he’ll be in unfamiliar circumstances, which always makes him nervous. And he would be lying if he said he wasn’t worried about it, but he’s pretty confident that he can handle it. Especially with Tony there to help him.
And then Tony comes. Out of nowhere, untouched, he moans and there’s white streaks of come jumping from his twitching cock. Steve only has a little pee left, so he keeps going until Tony is jittering with oversensitivity.
Fuck. Lust spreads like fire through Steve’s veins and he has to pull Tony in for a searing kiss. “Yes,” he gasps into Tony’s mouth. “Yes, yes,
“Steve.” Tony turns to look at him in the eye instead of through the mirror. He looks stern. “You’re not kicking me out. I’m offering to leave, and I came back, didn’t I? And you can shower afterward sometimes, instead, or - or who knows, maybe one day you’ll feel comfortable enough to -“
Bucky and Steve quietly chat for awhile before Tony wakes up. He blinks sleepily at Steve before quietly requesting a sip of water. As Steve reaches for the bottle, he winces at the sound of the water sloshing inside. Bucky gives him a sympathetic look, recognizing the sign of Steve’s desperation after years of friendship. But he knows there’s nothing to be done until Steve is home, so he doesn’t say anything. Talking about it always makes Steve even more uncomfortable.
“I just want you to be comfortable,” Tony murmurs, running a hand up the side of Steve’s thigh. “And I know if we go on this ski trip with everyone else, we’ll be in a cramped rental with a shared bathroom, and I’m... just... I’m worried, okay?”
Once the door closes behind him, Steve lets out a desperate hiss between his teeth, wiggling in place for a few seconds. Whenever he’s alone, the desperation is always worse, because he doesn’t have to pretend for anyone else. He reaches down to grip himself until the wave passes, but ends up ripping his hand away too soon when Tony comes back out earlier than expected.
“Yeah?” Tony asks. He tries to ignore the way his cock is rock hard against his thigh, now, because there’s nothing he can do about it.
This piss comes out of him in a faint trickle that quickly grows into a forceful stream as he relaxes. The stress bleeds out of him so suddenly that he has to fumble his free hand to the wall in front of him to help hold himself up. And, thank god, just as he finishes, he hears a knock at the door. He opens it to see Tony’s smiling face, also relaxed and relieved.
Steve gasps, hips hitching, and he has to stop moving suddenly or he’s going to come in his pants. Or pee his pants; he’s not sure which will happen first at this point.
He hears the toilet flush and the sink turn on, and he doesn’t hesitate. He swings open the bathroom and then slams it shut behind him, stumbling over to the toilet. He barely notices Tony’s shocked face in his rush, and Tony doesn’t even get to say anything before Steve is pulling his dick out and pissing full force into the toilet. And it’s so good; he doesn’t even have to wait for his brain to be comfortable enough to let go, he just does. His whole body relaxes, shoulders slumping, mind going blank.
Eventually, Tony runs out of things to talk about. Even he has a limit. And he’s still not happy with the small bursts of liquid coming out of Steve; he wants Steve to feel the relief that comes from a steady stream. So he tries a different tactic. He kisses Steve. He keeps it slow and sensual at first, feeling Steve melt against him. Then, once Steve is as relaxed as he can be with a full-to-the-brim bladder, Tony deepens the kiss to something with a little more heat behind it. Steve moans into his mouth, and Tony smiles into the kiss. His smile widens when he feels a couple of quick jets of wet heat run down his leg.
By the time they reach Steve’s dorm, Tony feels like an overfilled balloon, and he’s just dying to sprint in the bathroom and pee. But he can tell Steve needs to go too, but he's pushing that need to the side in order to hangout with Tony. So Tony resolves to do the same.
Steve flushes impossibly hotter at the word, smiling sheepishly. “I may have forgotten for a little while too. We can continue this when you get back, if you want.”
“C’mon, you’re all done, right?” Tony asks, and waits for Steve’s head to bob in a nod, still resting on Tony’s shoulder. “Okay, let’s get you out of here.”
Tony is an unresponsive puddle on his bed while Steve stands and strips off his boxers and uses them to wipe off any cum on his skin. He tosses them away and then climbs in bed next to Tony.
“Uh... T-Tony,” Steve says. Tony’s sucking a mark onto his neck, and Steve was moaning just a second ago, but now he sounds nervous. Tony’s heart is pounding behind his ribcage in anticipation, and he’s never been harder in his life. He’s pretty sure he has a wet spot on his briefs from the pre-cum he’s been steadily leaking for
“Steve!” He immediately exclaims, alarmed. Probably because Steve is standing in the middle of the room, sobbing, and peeing himself. But the worst part of it is, he’s not really, he’s only leaking into his pants, and he still
“Good thing we’re almost there,” Tony says once they’re seated. “I could go for a piss and I can’t wait to be off these uncomfortable seats.”
Tony doesn’t last long at all. Within 30 seconds, he comes with a gasp, hands gripping tight on Steve’s shoulders. Once he regains his breath, his cheeks flush red with embarrassment and he buries his face against Steve’s neck.
They stand behind the large couch to watch the others play MarioKart. At some point, Clint hands each of them a bottle of beer. Steve takes it, even though his bladder is really starting to nag him now. He doesn’t drink often, ever, because he knows that the alcohol will make his need worse. But he’s around friends, and more importantly, Tony is pressed against his side, comfortable and warm, and he really can’t stop himself.
After he finishes, he washes himself as quickly as possible and dresses even faster in order to see if Tony is still waiting for him. He opens the bathroom door cautiously, seeing Tony still sitting exactly where he left him, curled on Steve’s bed reading his book like he belongs there. Steve’s heart warms in his chest.
His phone buzzes in his hand — he’d forgotten he was even holding it — and he sees that Steve is calling him. He swipes to answer it without thinking about the fact that he’s still peeing his pants.
Steve sucks in a sharp breath from the jab to the stomach, and stops walking for a split second. He continues quickly, but both Bucky and Tony give him a curious glance. He hopes he looks close to normal, but inside he feels a second away from bursting. He thinks back to that night with Tony, trying to discern when exactly he had lost control, where the line was that had been crossed. He prays it doesn’t happen again.
“I’m not invited to Christmas,” Tony says eventually, after several more moments of silence. His voice is carefully detached, like he’s speaking about someone else. “Apparently I’m too much of an embarrassment to Father’s friends, and I’ll have to stay on campus or make other plans. Mother didn’t even bother apologizing for him this time.”
“Yeah?” Tony pulls back to look at him. Steve looks properly debauched, lips swollen from making out, hair mussed, cheeks flushed from arousal and embarrassment both. Tony adores him.
Tony’s phone rings, and though he’s surprised that Steve actually called, he’s not complaining. “Hey, sweetheart.”
...Well, he certainly wouldn’t mind seeing that. He’s conflicted, though, because he knows that’s practically Steve’s worst nightmare. Especially in public. And Tony definitely isn’t turned on by Steve feeling awful.
He could’ve gone hours ago! When his bladder first felt full, if he was normal, he could’ve emptied it into a public toilet like everyone else on the planet. His ears focus again on the sound of Tony’s release, so faint behind the door, but it’s the only sound in the room besides Steve’s harsh breathing. And then, with another spasm, abruptly, Steve knows he’s going to lose control. His hands fly to his crotch, but it’s too late, he’s leaking into his pants. The dam is broken and Steve can’t possibly stop it now.
“Wait, don’t leave,” Steve begs, eyes wide and so blue. Tony nearly falls to his knees for Steve then and there; he would do anything for him. “Please don’t leave me.”
Tony blinks at him, shock crossing his features. “Your mom barely knows me. She ate dinner with all of us in the dining hall, once, and that was before we were together.”
“I love you too,” Tony says. His cheeks are still pink but he smiling at Steve in the mirror. “I’m proud of you.”
. But he’d sooner throw himself off the top of the dorm building they’re sitting in than tell Steve about his newly discovered piss kink.
Steve leaves pretty quickly after their conversation, and Tony can see how desperate he is. It makes him so hot that he almost can’t stand it, but he waits for a little while just in case. He’s lazily stroking himself, fully expecting Steve to send a goodnight text instead of calling. He didn’t really think Steve would agree to the phone sex thing, because even though he’s not a virgin, either, he’s still a lot more conservative than Tony. But that’s probably true of a lot of people.
But Steve can’t move because his hand has found a small wet spot on the bed - small, but still there. He
“Can you... go for a little bit?” Steve finally asks, cheeks going red hot. He squirms a little under Tony.
But Steve has to pee, too, and probably a lot more than Tony does since he’s been holding it all day again. Like always. But, unlike Tony, there’s no clear end for him in sight.
