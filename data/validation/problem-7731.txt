“I’ll let you in as much as possible, but I need to do my job without your interference.” Nat looked them in the eye while she spoke. “Too much emotion, things get sloppy,” she added softly
“Steve?”
The pup was scared. It needed to stop before they could move forward. He drew closer to the girl, kneeling beside. She was the only person he’d encountered who gained comfort from his nearness. Piper caught him a hug, knocking him back slightly. Her arms wrapped snuggly around his neck. He briefly hesitated before returning the gesture. Winter knew he shouldn’t indulge the pup like this. She wouldn’t receive this kindness here.
“Will you be coming back to bed?” asked Pepper.
The rest of their honeymoon passed peacefully with moments of intense passion. Steve spent most of his days on the beach drawing beside Tony in a chair. It came to end all too soon, but he was ready to home, get his den order.
Best to get an assessment of the situation. Winter moved to a large window facing the runway. A handsome couple was walking down the stairs of a private jet. Stars of some kind. There would be more eyes around, but their paths were unlikely to cross. Winter moved on.
His lip rose slightly, wanting to bare his teeth and snarl.
Tony shed his clothes as he walked to the shower. The water was set to the perfect temperature. It soothed his aching bruised body. The shower door opened. Steve came up behind him, gently nosing against his neck. Tony turned to kiss him. Steve carefully washed his wounds. They felt refreshed once done. The doorbell rang.
“I don’t think so. Have I told you that before that I won,” said Piper.
“We’re good to go on this end. The rest is up to you,” said Tony.
The pup laid down on the couch. And their true session began.
“Tell me if you change your mind,” said Jarvis.
“Sir, the device is already self-sustaining,” said Jarvis.
He shrugged honestly not caring. Rune grabbed his tray food taking a seat in front of her. The girl’s stomach growled.
“Welcome to S.H.I.E.L.D., Rune. I’m Dr. Edith Star,” she said.
"I'm sorry I know it's uncomfortable, but its an important part of an annual exam. I’ll be as quick as possible. Please put on the gown,” she said.
Steve got out of bed.
"I know it's nice, but you can't stay in here all day, pumpkin."
“It’s rare for you to question me on a mission,” he said.
“It made me feel sick inside,” said Piper. It was easier to focus on what she’d done than thinking of her parents. They would be ashamed.
Steve entwined their fingers. He loved the feel of the metal against his palm. He pressed himself against Tony. The alpha chuckled softly, allowing him to continue the behavior. Raising his only when the coolness faded. He picked up the helmet.
“Tony, that isn’t fair,” said Steve.
“So how long do you think this fireman obsession will last?” asked Tony.
“I can do that,” said Steve.
Such sincerity was refreshing. Most found his scent confusing too weak to be alpha or omega and too strong to beta. Steve and Natasha seemed fine with it.
"I wasn't going to throw it."
He deeply breathed in the scent of the aroused being beneath him. His reaction was swift. Steve’s purring grew louder. The scent of his slick became powerfully alluring. Tony rolled them over, hovering over the beauty. Steve's skin flushed a wonderful shade of pink. Tony threw off his shirt. He caught Steve’s soft pink lips in a kiss. Their tongues danced in a messy kiss only pulling away for only a moment.
"I broke it."
June 14, 2016
“Do you know what the surprise is?”
"You came back. Why?"
He moved his hand away. Steve whined alluring at the absence of his touch. Tony paid the delivery boy and hurried back. He placed four large paper bags of food on the coffee table.
"What did he do?"
“I’m sorry, Piper. This won’t take long. Only a few hours.”
“She knows more than she’s letting on. Releasing her will be a mistake,” she said.
"Now open. I'm going to take a swab," said Bruce.
"Love you too," said Tony.
“He an astrophysicist,” said Bruce.
"There's a decent burger place and there's a bakery. They have great pies," said Tony.
Clint and Natasha watch them for a moment. He recognized what he was seeing. An alpha and omega very much in love.
“Tony,” he whimpered.
“We’ve been together five years now. You know I’m not like that.”
“I’ll be here for you.”
“Nothing, sweetheart.”
"We'll figure it out," said Tony.
“You fell out of the sky.”
Piper smiled. They went home. The penthouse smelled of breakfast. A large plate of scrambled eggs and sausage was waiting for him. Tony traded him a cup of coffee for Piper.
His men approached the fallen hero. They backed off when a deep snarl left the unconscious man. Even in this state, the man was dangerous. A non-alpha would be a safer bet.
At eight, Steve went to the kitchen. Pepper, Maria, and Rune were already there. Someone had made waffles and there was enough batter left for more.
“Alright, I might not be home when you get back,” said Tony.
"It alright, Steve." Tony ran his fingers through Steve's hair.
“I’m not moving. You want something take it. Although the guns are all fake cause wankers wouldn’t trust me with a real one,”
“Put on the suit,” growled Steve.
“At times, it can be. One day when you're in love you'll understand,” said Pepper.
With that, the transmission ended. Pierce's reaction was what it was supposed to be. The man's face had remained sullen and expressionless. On the few occasions, Fury had witnessed a crack in Pierce’s exterior, it was due to rage. But, this time, Fury caught the flinch of concern. Pierce had shown nothing but indifference and annoyance to Piper's kidnapping until now. There were disturbing implications.
"Thank you," he whispered.
That was enough proof for them. They dug in. Piper eyed the jelly-filled donut. She cut it in half, offering a part to Rune. He happily took a bite of the donut, squirting jelly everywhere. Piper giggled.
"And you said you were a bad dancer," said Peggy.
“Rumlow got too close, ”said Steve.
“I thought you’d be more impressive, but this is to be expected given your condition.”
“He attacked Happy!”
He went up the penthouse. It was a mess. Tony went to the bedroom and joined Steve. The omega's breathing was steady.
The front gate doorbell rang.
“Will the change in my scent really be that apparent?”
“For you.”
Tony went to the garage. He’d recently bought a Porsche Cayenne Turbo S 2013. He took the baby seat from its box. After twenty minutes he was cursing up a storm. He looked at the instructions, of course, it was written in Chinese. It couldn't be written in one of the many other languages he actually knew.
Steve blushed. He placed a gentle kiss on the alpha’s lips. “I love you too."
“How did you allow this to happen?!”
“For me?”
"We have to keep him on IV drip Extremis his body sees it as a toxin and recovers every time. I assure you it's a painful process. Your CEO isn't handling it nearly as well. As soon as her body gives up its will to fight. I have to detonation is quite spectacular."
Piper was happily working on her latest project. Opera music was playing in the background. She hated the stuff, but Sir had a thing for it. While she worked, he would read or listen to his opera music. Sir gave her more freedom than Lena ever did.
Steve bit his lip. Two of the smartest people he knew couldn't figure what was going on with his child.
Tony cleaned himself with a wet towel. When he returned to, Steve was asleep. He nestled underneath the blankets with his mate. Steve's back pressed against his chest. Sleep came to him unusually swiftly.
Steve shoved her away. Natasha remained steady, while he was verging on a mental break.
Lena paused the footage right when Piper’s eyes were completely overtaken by the blue light.
“You’ll like this one,” said Tony.
“She’s safe. Look.” Tony pulled up the live feed of Piper from the lab. She was just waking up.
“I’m fine, sweetheart."
The boy whispered something in Piper's ear. "Oh, she's my Aunt Maria. She very nice, and so is her mate Pepper."
Winter crashed to his knees. An electric current traveling through him.
“Tie it to a tame one.”
"I'll drive you," offered Tony.
“I’d say that’s an unintentional benefit. I hated that thing,” he said.
“You’re her parent. She loves you, this won’t change that.”
Steve wanted to reach out and cuddle his mate. Steve sighed. He’d done his job. Now it was time to go home.
“You’ve got to loosen up. Maybe this will help,” she said.
Steve nodded and started letting go. The rigging broke sending Steve sliding over the edge. Their hand just missed.
“I’ll pick up dinner. Pizza fine for tonight?” asked Tony.
“Jarvis, target Extremis heat signature and disable with extreme predaceous,” said Tony.
“You’re joining me.”
In the earliest hours of the morning, Steve was forced awake by a powerful wave of nausea. He desperately swallowed what threatened to come up. Steve reached the hall bathroom just in time. His stomach emptied. He slowly raised his head from the toilet. The realization hit him. His hand went to his stomach. He can’t be! Steve turned on the shower and got in before the smell of his distress could reach further. He sunk to the shower floor.
Fury glanced up from his paperwork. Despite his position within the organization, he wasn't free of paperwork. A light blinked on his desk, announcing an incoming holographic call. Fury let it ring a few more times before picking up. The blue-tinted hologram of Pierce appeared in front of his desk.
“For taking on Loki alone,” said Tony.
Barny trained expression didn’t break.
“I like nonsense; it wakes up the brain cells,” said Lena. It only seemed appropriate that the girl’s awakening phrase would come from her favorite author. There was something to the irony of it, which Lena enjoyed.
"I can do both."
Steve stared at the bedroom door. His was only gone a few minutes and he was already growing anxious. He whimpered. It was a pathetic sound which he despised making. He covered his mouth. His panicked alpha dashed into the room. Tony dropped everything him and joined him in bed.
"What are you doing?"
“PEPPER!”
“Seventy-two hours.”
"So you're funding artists now," said Rhodes.
“We have?”
"No."
He’d never been to a spa.
"In a few weeks." They'd have to get used to living with an infant before they allowed others near her. Even Rhodey.
"So we'll have to plan the event of the year in three months. Before you start showing," said Pepper.
The beast dove low its belly, breaking the building below it. He flew to the mouth of the beast.
At eight in the morning, Natasha woke. From the top bunk, she saw Steve asleep on the floor. He was moaning slightly in his sleep. Someone was having a very good dream.
"Don't see any reason why not," said Tony with a wink.
Tony relaxed. She laughed.
Lena sighed listening in to their conversation. Winter reinvigorated Piper. It wasn't much of a pep talk, but it seemed to do it for her. It wouldn't last long. All she needed was a reminder of how unfit she was for the outside world. If that failed, more invasive measures were available.
“Our subject has made great progress.”
She forced a smile in place. “It’s okay, Uncle Bruce. Just thought you were someone else for a second.”
“Morning.”
"Nothing."
“Don’t know.”
“No, sir." He didn't want to speak to the man all. What he wanted to do was kill him in the most agonizing way possible.
“Ready to order?” she asked.
“Thanks, sweetheart."
*****
“Her first tantrum will be a disaster,” he said.
"Hey, guys. Can we um. Should we worry about that?" said the beta.
“Hurry, up and check him.”
“Okay,” said Steve.
“She’s done.”
“You make a move I break your face,” he said.
Steve’s hold on was loose enough for him to sit. He edged out of bed and quietly snuck out. Rhodey stood in the center of the penthouse, shocked.
Steve tensed. Tony tried to soothe the distress leaking off him. He nosed against Tony’s neck, taking comfort in his scent.
“Fuck!”
“I’ve never been with anyone under the age of twenty-one!” growled Tony.
“Bathroom third drawer on the left. Do I need to call for further assistance?"
“See you later gorgeous,” she said.
“I’ll wait upstairs,” said Rhodes.
“Lower the weapon, Stark."
Steve took a seat. On the coffee table were thank you letters from children for saving the world. Tony’s cool metallic hands touched his shoulders.
Steve followed his usual morning routine, cradling his six-month-old daughter in one arm. After her morning feeding, Piper happily crawled around on the blanket. Steve sighed, setting down his coffee mug, and started flipping through the channels.
“It was,” said Steve. His nerves quickly calmed when he saw a figure soaring down from the sky. “It’s only, Thor.”
“Okay.”
“No, let him enjoy the holiday,” said Steve.
“Yes, ma’am.”
The process of painting helped him unwind in a way in which other calming practices failed. His gaze focused on the aircraft. His thoughts traveled to Peggy. So many times he'd wanted to call her. But couldn't bring himself to do it. He didn't want her hurt by reminding her what could have been. She had her own life. It wouldn’t be fair of him to interfere now. He washed his paintbrushes and set them to dry on the kitchen counter. Steve changed from his paint-stained clothes, tossing them into the hamper. He put on his workout outfit. Today he was given the task of running exercises with the trainees.
He left a card on the desk before taking his leave. Tony waited till the man was out of his building before reaching for the card.
“Why? When so many others have died. I’ve had two chances. While some never got the chance,” he said.
“I won’t do anything like that again. I have too much to lose,” he said.
*****
*****
Winter woke up with his mind clear, feeling like he had just crawled out of a dark and never-ending tunnel.
She didn't respond to the voice. Blood dripped from her fists. Blue light coursed through her. Her hair sparkled with the same glow. She moved in front of Winter.
“If I clear the rotors this thing won’t re-engage without a jump. I’m going to have to get in there and push,” said Tony.
"I like that idea even more," said Tony.
She laughed.
The couple groaned. All they wanted to do was go home.
As soon as the order was given, Steve slammed against the door at full strength.
"Gym."
Steve shook his head.
Tony was already up the stairs leading to the jet. Rhodes rushed to follow behind him.
Steve led the way. The footing was unstable but they made their forward at steady. They avoided the tripwires and other traps set in place. The two took shelter on a rocky cliff. Below were different kinds of weaponry. All of them had Stark’s name plastered on them. There was a pile of bodies outside. Rumlow’s team lessened the numbers slightly. There were two guards outside of the entrance probably more inside.
"She came in when I had an episode."
“I’ve seen you do it.”
Press surrounded the tower. Flowers were piled high against its 30-foot windows Boxes of sympathy letters crowded the lobby. No privacy. The whole world was watching them. They'd done a press conference asking for their daughter to be returned but it was all for show.
He took Tony’s hand, gaining his full attention. “I want you to get the surgery.”
He wanted to tell of her he met her parents, but protocol would not allow him. And if he could tell her, would it do her any good?
“I’ve expanded his mind,” said Loki.
"You know I can help. Just ask. I got a ton of new tech. I got bomb disposal, catches explosions mid-air," said Tony.
“Sorry, I haven’t asked your name,” said Steve.
“Why didn’t you tell us until now!” snarled Tony.
Tony spared mercy on him.
“Jarvis, put on the news.”
*****
"Sure he isn't," said Clint, rolling his eyes. He laughed when Steve broke eye contact with suddenly more interested in the floor. Steve was acting like a kid with a crush. It was oddly cute. If it were anyone else it wouldn't work. For his age, Steve had so little experience in this area.
Give him a nuclear bomb to defuse, before comforting a crying omega. Instinct took control. He brought Steve close, allowing him to hide his face in the crook of his neck.
There were more rules, all of which she’d broken, but she managed to find some semblance of happiness within its constraints. The punishments were swift severe, patterning her with bruises. It would be a lot worse if she didn’t have Winter and Rune. On the worst days, they made her feel better. She tried doing the same for them.
"I don't know just can. How do you do the thing you do?" he asked.
She left. Steve was grateful for her absence. She seemed nice, but having another near his alpha during this time was agitating.
"It can be used in the treatment of diseases. There's less chance of rejection if it's taken from you,” said Edith.
“Do you have anyone here?" asked Matt.
“Hungry?” asked Steve.
"That’s not an answer. I have to find a way to explain this to the press,” she said.
*****
“Was there no one else?”
The indifferent tone only further agitated him.
“What do you no ‘how are you, Natasha?’”
“Thor is at the dining hall,” said Jarvis.
"I'm pregnant," said Steve.
"I'm not equipped to help."
“Give it time,” she said.
“No, you are in dudgeon. I’m free to go.”
“Hello?”
“I’m sorry that’s a terrible idea. Please don’t touch his bags,” said Tony.
Piper reached for him, wrapping her hand tightly around his finger, with a power unusual for an infant. He shouldn't be enjoying this moment alone. Steve should be here. Christina returned with one of Steve shirts.
“Congratulations my friends. You are glowing, Steve with parenthood,” said Thor.
“I’ll teach you the music is slow,” said Tony.
“Because it has no importance in your education. Either you chose from the listed subject or we'll sit here for several hours. The choice is yours.”
"What are these?" asked Tony.
Piper bit her lip, debating whether to allow herself this comfort. “Okay.”
“And you’re exactly where I left you,” said Natasha.
“Thank you, Rhodes,” said Steve.
“I should go. Keeping her waiting is dangerous,” he said.
His metal arm hung limply from his side.
“Morning, umm there’s something I need to tell you. I’m-
“You’re going to spend some time with me.”
Natasha eyed him. “You were hoping I came with a mission.” He nodded again.
"Steve?"
“Okay.”
"Like what?"
Winter didn’t reply but the lethal coldness of his stare was answer enough. She reminded herself to trust Winter. This was her friend. She wouldn't be frightened of him. The only sign of her fear the slight twitch of her leg.
They went to Howard's lab. Everything was covered in a thick layer of dust. Tony took a moment to look it over. When he was young he would constantly try to get in, only to be lectured and thrown out. It seemed bigger then.
“Shit!”
"We already have a blunt tool. I'm sure you're capable of modeling Rune into someone just capable as Piper. The true merit of a creator is not what they can do with rich material, but they can do with poorer."
Her grip on his shoulder meant he should probably stay. He nodded.
“Everyone calls me, Rhodes. You’re real,” he said.
“Hop in,” said Phil.
“Your heat,” she said.
“I don’t need much sleep.”
"Hello, Winter." Unresponsive. "Stand him up."
Steve watched as Piper strode out of the room without even sparing a glance at him. There was that confidence he thought she’d lost. It came so naturally when she was protecting her friend. It made him so proud.
“One flight is bad enough,” said Steve.
“You guy aren’t authorized to be in here,” said a guard.
"Okay, you're coming with us," said Steve.
“Jarvis, pull up the footage from the closet,” said Tony.
He went in search of his mate. Steve was circling the master bedroom.
"Likely your love affair with Captain America," he said.
“That would be nice,” he said.
He snuck into Steve's bedroom. It was freezing. Steve was asleep. Despite the cool temperature, Steve was sweating heavily. He caressed Steve's cheek. Tony kissed the omega on the forehead.
Steve’s eyes were so intensely focused on it. He didn’t seem disturbed, more curious. Tony jolted when callused hands gently touch the sensitive skin around the reactor. Steve shot to the other end of the couch.
“What did they do to you?”
“Come on people.”
“Go,” said Steve pushing the alpha from the chair.
easier to follow in some sense, but difficult in others.
It was the sixteenth of December that gave him a bit more than a month. He makes it through Steve’s heat without incident the omega’s hormones would further bond Steve to him.
“This lecture again,” he said.
“No, it isn’t.” Tony took Steve’s hand in his own.
"I didn't."
"Can I touch you?" Steve nodded. He sat down next to him, wrapping an arm around his shivering frame.
“Edith should be here soon.”
"Okay, come in visit again soon."
*****
He caught it, seconds before it could hit his face, then threw back it at her. She laughed, ripping out another page, tossing it at him. Soon, paper balls were being flung across the room. Winter dodged and tumbled around freely, despite the enclosed space. She laughed. His seriousness made it all the more humorous. By the end, all that was left of her books were the covers and a mess of crumpled pages on the floor. She jumped into the pile of paper, making a snow angel of sorts. Fun. How long had it been since she last had
“Tony, he was the same man who attacked me on the plane.”
“Because I fell two hundred feet into a pit of fire.”
"Fury and me," said Phil.
"Yes, but that was several days ago."
"Better?" asked Tony.
Clint always smelled unmated. The alpha flipped up his collar realizing his mistake. He has a mate. Steve tried not to let the shock show in his expression. It didn’t bother him that Clint hadn’t told him with the alpha’s career it was understandable for him to keep those close to him a secret.
“Take off your shirt."
“Steve won’t let me."
Tony’s heart sank as he read over the letter. Aching anger weighed heavily on his chest. The relationship between Steve and Howard was more than he thought. More than he could healthily handle. It wasn’t the one-sidedness he thought it was. The letter crumpled in his hand.
“Opening door 1013.”
“He’ll be fine.”
“May I have the rings?”
Tony laughed yanking away the pillow Steve was hiding behind. "What? It's not like she walked in on us?"
“Where’s Tony?” he asked.
Steve leaned forward, catching the alpha in a kiss. “Happy New Year."
No answer.
Natasha called Edith. Minutes later there was a knock on the door. Nat yanked the doctor inside.

The water quickly went to a boil. He put the spaghetti in. Steve purred as Tony’s arms wrapped around his waist. He placed a glass of white wine next to him. Tony nuzzled against his neck.
“Empty your pockets and throw your purse to the other side of the room,” countered Piper.
“These were in Phil Coulson’s jacket. I guess he never did get you to sign them,” said Fury.
Winter paced the room. She'd been gone too long! What was the doctor doing to her? He slammed his hand against the wall. His metal hand only made a small crater in the cement, but the tremor went up the mechanical arm to his aching shoulder.
“I want to go to Arlington to visit Bucky. I want you to go with me,” said Steve.
“Then skip the spinning rims we’re on the clock,” said Tony.
He turned his head slightly.
“I did nothing.”
"This isn't a joke, Tony. We're talking about our family. And the danger that it's in now."
“We’ve already established I’m not most children.”
Rhodes took his leave and placed a bag of bagels on the counter. Steve had lost his appetite. He jumped when Tony touched his shoulder.
He was speeding toward the ground. This was going to be a crash landing. He skidded across a road barely missing an oncoming truck. Trees snapped as he rocketed through them, before finally stopping in the snow. He slowly moved onto his back, catching his breath. Tony took off his mask. Snow fell onto his face.
“You thought it was your parents.” She nodded. The pup hadn’t completely given up on them yet.
Tony shrugged.
"What have you been up to since left?" asked Tony.
"You've controlled your strength into repression. You need to let go."
"I think he would," said Steve.
“Could you break open that door?” asked Piper.
"I don't think any less of you for making that choice. No one should. You were put in an impossible situation. Where you were forced to defy instinct."
Natasha would do anything to get Clint back to himself and to his family as safely as possible. It was the very least she could do.
“Sorry, Mr. Stark.”
She put her plate in the dishwasher before following Daddy downstairs. He pulled up the blueprint of his most recent suit of armor. But she couldn’t pay attention to what he was saying and clearly, whatever he was talking about wasn’t too important to him either. If he were, he'd be more animated about it.
Her saddened eyes widened. “What?”
"What’s that?" asked Rune, missing the heartbroken expression from Pepper and Maria.
“Promise?”
"Is she still stable? The Extremis soldiers had a pension for exploding," said Steve.
Homesickness washed over her. She had to get back to New York. But now she had a goal where she had to get. New York was her home even if her parents didn’t want her.
She started tearing up. “They hurt Winter and Rune because of me!” She lunged at him, hiding her face in his chest.
“That’s great, Tony.”
“Art was not an offered course.”
“Fifteen days,” said Steve.
“What?”
“We’ll see,” Steve said.
“Wait, there’s something else. Well, someone else.”
Winter twitched. His mind lacked the will to reach its definition, but it was nothing good. It was dark.
"I would have," he said.
Those crystal blue eyes snapped open. A kiss was pressed against his lips. He pulled away throwing up into the toilet. Tony slowly raised his head and flushed.
Natasha rushed to him. Steve relaxed slightly, taking comfort with a familiar presence.
“Who was that?”
"We have to find him," said Natasha.
“You wouldn’t drop me,” he said.
“Of the man who took the poor little pup, Piper.”
“You and me stay here on the ground keep the fighting here. And Hulk, smash,” he said.
"Time for bed, sweetheart."
“Winter?” She stared. His face was clean-shaven and his hair had been cut. Under all that scruff was a nice face.
"They have to learn to get along," said Steve.
Winter stared at the pup. Why hadn’t she run? This was her chance, yet she stayed.
"Happy, it's been a while," said Rhodes.
"I don't know him. Have you ever seen him?" Steve looked over Tony’s shoulder.
Her legs were trapped under a beam. He made his way toward her. “I’m coming.”
"Ready to meet, Aunt Peggy?"
"I thought you'd be the type to collect souvenirs," she said.
Steve would have been embarrassed about their current situation if it weren't so fulfilling. He moaned as Tony’s hold tightened as they worked through his second orgasm before his knot deflated. Steve whined at the separation as his pull away from him.
"What? No, but I do know it's happening off the coast. Something to do with uh a big boat. I can take you there,” said Trevor.
"What happens when we get home?" asked Steve.
The light blue eyes slowly fluttered open.
“Should I get Tony?”
“It's sucking its thumb,” said Edith.
He went back to work.
Steve smiled. It was difficult picturing the stern yet kind woman he worked with during the war as a parent. He never thought her a mothering type. If they ever had the chance to be together he’d be the one carrying a child.
He put her in the high chair and put on her bib. Tony placed a bowl of mashed avocado in front of her. She instantly jammed her hands into it and flung a handful of at him.
“It’s more romantic being assigned as your heat alpha,” said Tony.
"I have all the right!" she yelled.
“Daddy,” she murmured.
“Do you think she’ll keep with it?” asked Steve.
“You got what you wanted now can you leave,” said Tony.
Steve felt the slight dip in the mattress as the alpha took a seat on the edge of the bed. The smell of his favorite comfort food was not enough to get him out of bed.
Steve pulled him out of the closet. Happy had helped himself to coffee and a bagel.
He sped toward them. Dodging attacks and firing back. He wouldn’t be able to handle this alone. The best he could do for the moment was trying to keep them at their source for as longs as possible, too many had already reached the city.
Slowly, she unwound, going limp against him. Her breathing evened out after several minutes. Bruce loosened his hold on her. She stood briefly on her own before falling back into his chest.
“That would be great,” said Steve.
Steve wrapped a clean dishtowel around the alpha’s foot and grabbed the first aid kit. Tony hissed as he pulled out a shard of the mug. Steve bandaged the wound.
"Thank you. I know this wasn't what you expected, but Piper is young and strong. She'll get back to where she was," said Maria.
Steve kissed him. He gently touched the alpha's face. Steve didn't ask why Tony hadn't told before. He understood how difficult speaking of these things were.
"Is that needed?" he asked.
“Don’t leave us in suspense, Banner,” said Tony.
He looked away.
“We were just celebrating,” said Steve.
“You’re small enough to be one.” She still had pride. It was a useless thing to have here. He slid a piece of bacon through one of the vents in the class.
"I'm not in the mood for company," said Steve.
“Happy, my assistant,” said Tony. He went to the bar. After today he needed a drink to take off the edge.
“Where?” asked Tony.
"I'm sorry, Steve."
“Can I pick you up, Piper?” asked Tony.
“We've found no abnormalities in any of Captain Rogers's samples,” said one.
June 20, 2016
“Dizzy, it will pass,” he said.
“Shut it down, Dr. Selvig,” said Tony.
“About half an hour,” said Tony.
“No, that’s fine,” said Steve. He wanted to spend some time at home as well. “What’s the plan for today?”
*****
“Really?” she said with a tilt of her head.
"Were you pregnant during the Incident?"
“Hopefully, an alien,” said Bruce.
Again he followed the agent. He was tired of this game of follow the leader. He wished for some time alone.
“Pretty, I’m coming over. I’ll be there in an hour,” she before hanging up.
"When has fine ever been fine for us?" said Steve.
“I have a boyfriend,” said Steve.
Matt walked her to the door. He caught Foggy’s scent in the hallway. When the omega was sure it was safe he came running the door.
“And Jarvis will tell us,” said Tony.
*****
He risked hurting Tony if kept this a secret much longer. This was something he didn't think they'd have to deal with for several years. Steve knew his fear was verging on unreasonable. The alpha was frustrated with him, and Steve couldn’t blame him. He moved his hand over his stomach.
His eyes snapped open. Tony’s face was inches from his. He blushed. The alpha was naked. He tried regaining control of his expression, keeping his gaze focused on Tony's eyes.
“I have a plan, attack,”
“That’s the best good news I’ve heard in a long time.”
Steve wished there was more. He wanted to know all he could.
“Like what?”
“To shower. I’ll be quick,” he said.
"You're my only friend. I... I can't lose you." Again, her arms wrapped gently around his neck, keeping him close.
Tony collapsed on top of him. Steve pushed against the cool marble counter. His breaths came in heavy pants. The alpha's teeth slowly left his neck. Tony softly lapped away the blood from his neck, each moaning as he pulled out. He slowly got up, his legs still shaky. Tony gently touched their foreheads together. Steve purred.
“We didn’t. I only strengthened my claim,” he said.
“Thomas the Tank Engine.”
He froze on the history channel. On the screen was a black and white image of a young man sitting on an overturn stool staring at a burnt skeletal corpse of concentration camp prisoner. He was lost in the depravity of the moment. His head bowed as he processed the darkness before him. Steve understood the deep utter disappointment in knowing mankind was capable of such atrocity. He knew the exact questions running through man's head.
“It’s not in my nature. If I’m forced to tolerate you, I’ll make sure it’s on my terms. My head of security will be accompanying you to New York,” he said.
“I’m not going anywhere, only getting my tools,” he said.
Barny got up and followed him. “Please don’t run; trying to keep up with you will give me a heart attack."
"You want to discuss this now?" asked Steve.
“And he didn’t invite me,”
He followed after his mate. Thankfully, Tony made the smart decision of not smashing cake in his face. Tony licked the frosting from his fingers. Steve blushed turning away. Well-wishers followed them to the car. Tony sped out of the driveway.
Tony nodded. They went up to the penthouse. The shower there still worked and there was enough room for the two of them. They got into the shower together. There was nothing sexual about it. The touches between them were nurturing, reassuring, and gentle. Tony's hands would stop shy of his stomach. He moved the alpha's hand there, placing his hand over Tony's.
There were things she didn't know. Her parents hadn't told her about this.
“As you wish, sir,” said Jarvis.
“When have you given a fuck about a contract?! You know the press will find out. They always find out," hissed Pepper.
“Where are we going?” asked the pilot.
“You’re doing great. Relax.”
Steve looked a tiny wreath. It was perfect. Bucky wasn't much for flowers. For pretty omegas and betas sure but not himself. He wouldn't want anyone to go to the trouble. Tony kissed him gently. Steve smiled softly, settling back into his chair.
“I can’t even button a fucking shirt.”
“You don’t like me,” said Bloom.
“Would you tell me if you could?”
February 11, 2016
"No reason."
“Taking Vivien?” asked Tony.
“Who?” he asked.
“No.”
Steve slowly got up. His center of balance changed completely. He rubbed his lower back. For the first time in his life, he felt fat. It was impossible to find maternity clothes in his size. In the end, he had to get them custom made. Steve rubbed his stomach. The baby kicked gently against his hand.
Steve stilled despite the intensifying pain. He whimpered, begging to be released of the command. Steve snarled when Edith neared. Alpha distrusted the woman. If alpha didn't trust her why should he? He was unable to move. Why wouldn't alpha release him? He whined.
Steve started preparing her lunch, also making him and Tony something. From the fridge, he took a bottle of PediaSure. It wasn’t that Piper was too small, but as a super soldier she needed the nutrition and calories it offered. He made sure she drank it at least twice a day. Tony scooped Piper into his arms when he came up from the lab, taking her table.
“Are you alright? Should I wake sir?” asked Jarvis.
“No, problem,” she said.
He didn’t know what to do. Steve was whimpering and crying on the floor, clutching his head. He didn’t know what to touch or not touch!
“I figured. But these damn instincts are demanding that I check on you.”
“Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract. This does not mean-
"Thanks," he said.
“How are you sleeping?”
It might be a good investment. Piper seemed like she would wander. He went to the playpen, taking out all the toys. She glared him before crying. He hated hearing her cry, but eventually Piper went quiet, seeming to understand it was getting her nowhere. When the pasta was done and plated, he took Piper out of the playpen. She whimpered and cuddled against him.
"We were attacked."
Barny rubbed his temples. Despite Steve’s appearance, he was from a different time. An era where omegas feared seeking medical attention. Lashing out at an alpha or acting in a disapproved manner was enough to land an omega in a mental institution or heat facility. Both were equally horrible. Steve's reaction was to be expected.
“Meatloaf isn’t breakfast,” said Piper.
“Who is this voice you are talking with?” asked Thor.
“Steve, you’re crushing my hand.”
How could she believe that? With a mind as talented as hers, why would she waste her thoughts on the idea that someone was looking for him?
“I like the new paint job,” said Clint, gesturing to his shield.
"Like hell it's not -- " Steve reaches out again and Tony full body jerks away from his touch. "I'm sorry." Steve blurts "This wasn't -- I didn't want to pressure you. Do you need a countdown? Deep breaths, Tony, deep breaths and hold for ten, remember?"
“What?”
The song is ‘It’s All Over But The Crying’. Tony rests a hand on Steve’s hip, and curls his fingers around his palm. They don’t dance, not like they used to, Tony couldn’t take that. But they sway, and Tony lays the side of his head against Steve’s chest. He fits neatly beneath Steve’s chin, his hair tickling his neck. He sings, for what feels like the first time in decades. Tony’s voice is smooth, and strong. He’s warm in Steve’s arms, and he allows himself a smile against the crown of Tony’s head, allows himself to feel a burst of hope, and happiness.
Steve had thought they would have more time, you see. He had thought, okay, so now Tony’s depressed, but so was I once. And it gets better eventually. We have so much time left, Tony won’t always feel this way, and someday he will get better.
Maybe he hasn’t left his apartment in three weeks. He knows what people will say, when they see him; they’ll apologise to his face, and then laugh behind his back. Tony has been having bad dreams, where he’s burnt and charred and naked on the floor, begging them for help, but instead they point and take pictures and drink champagne over his head.
Tony thinks,
Tony has to physically force himself to shovel food into his mouth. It tastes of nothing, lies heavy in his stomach, thick on his tongue. Sarah is just watching him. Each time he stops, or tries to push the plate away, she reminds him he can’t leave until he’s finished.
“I swear to God, this isn’t jealously talking.”
Once, Tony had designed Iron Man on sheets like that.
Steve is back. “C’mon,” he urges, tapping Tony’s shoulder, “let’s go to the bathroom.”
myself.” Stick to the plan, Stark –
“Yeah,” he says defensively, “you know. When you can just tell that someone is – I always think it’s like a beeping. A radar, you know?”
“It didn’t work.”
“Same old. You saw what happened in Iowa?”
He’s in a rubber room. It’s not like the movies. Tony thinks he’s been put in one of these before, the soft walls and floor, like a kid’s playpen, but memory of that time is hazy. Here, the walls aren’t white, but they’re coloured a calming light blue, the floor slightly darker, and there are windows lining the top where they can’t be reached, letting in natural light.
Steve screams at Natasha when he gets back to HQ. “They just — took it!” He spits “No one even asked us, we weren’t notified, and why would they take it down, Stark Industries is still the future, we all know that — “
“It kind of just sounded like you did, though,” Tony says, standing.
“It’s fine, Tony,” Sarah says gently. “I live in the city. I can take you in after our session and drive you back.”
“He’s not here tonight.”
“Did you think that was clever?” Tony asks the man. “Saying those things to him? Did it make you feel good?”
Except, that night, he punches in the code one last time. 5232011. The day they found Steve in the ice.
Tony realises, drowsily.
“Tony!”
him, rocking them back and forth, breathing in Tony’s throat.
“I get it. I’m rich.”
“So’s mine. I’ll show you mine if you show me yours.”
“You think I made a mistake.”
“I’ll take that as a no, then.”
“You love him,” Steve notes, “obviously. I can tell you do. He’s well-looked after, isn’t he? Well-educated, too. How very modern.”
Silence. Then: “We should film it. Send it to Rogers.”
So I was on a roll and figured why not upload? It might be a while till the next one, though.
To apologise.
he tries to impress upon him, staring.
him respond. “That’s like – I don’t know. I think it just takes whatever scent I want to… that makes me feel safe,” he finishes, slowly.
“Why do you mean?”
The streets are still full of people, so they have to get cars back to the tower. Steve is stopped by friend’s of the deceased, fans, the crowd outside the cemetery gates now screaming Tony’s name, holding up placards and pictures. There’s a small, roped off group who are chanting obscenities. Murderer! Scumbag! Sellout!
“Where else could I go?” Tony mutters, bitter. “I don’t have anywhere else, I don’t have anything else. You told me — you told me that we would leave here,” Tony says plaintively. “You promised me we could move to the mansion, just you and me. I thought — stupid, fucking stupid of me to believe it.” Tony laughs, then. Laughs and stands and smashes his glass against the table.
he thinks, recalling he’d smelt something hearty, had had it spooned into his mouth while half-asleep. A radio, he thinks, calling out commentary for a football game. It’s low, though. Quiet. Fingers tapping on a computer keyboard. The smell of coffee.
“I want to die.”
Steve nods. “I guessed.”
“Sounds like Fury’s the only one with any damn sense.”
“But I don’t know how to fix it,” he says, and his voice is so quiet, almost a whisper. Tony has the awful, sinking feeling, that he’s trying to mask a croak. “I never used to be like this, Tony.”
“I get around.”
“So you went to Natasha?!”
“First omega to graduate from MIT, ever,” he recounts.
(See the end of the chapter for
“They all said that. They all say it. You know I was fifteen? And he was sixty-four.”
He knocks.
“You’ll have a plan,” Steve says, confidently.
And that’s when it comes back to him.
“Answer the fucking call, Stark.”
You fucking patronising bastard, the first voice hisses. He has less pull these days, Tony thinks. The urge to kill himself has lessened. Oh, he’s unhappy, sure. But he’s less inclined to end it. He sees now that there is a potential for life outside of this compound. Even if he never leaves, he takes enjoyment now from simple things: Mosely, walking him in the mornings, his chats with Sarah and the books he reads. He thinks he might just hold on awhile, see how life goes.
(See the end of the chapter for
He just wanted this to work, is all. He had thought – if he had Steve, he would be happy. That he might be happy, with someone like that, who kisses his cheek before he goes to work, and cuts up his toast into little squares when he makes him breakfast. Why did he think he even deserved it? And what has he done – why would something that good ever happen to someone like him?
Carry him, Steve should say.
Tony scoffs. “She was a physiotherapist, how the hell would she cover the cost of all that? A house? Food, bills, everything. You must have helped.”
“Did you love your parents?”
Overcome? The first voice spits Look at her! She’s wearing this month’s fashions, she’s had hair dyed, she’s at college! She hasn’t overcome anything, she’s played the game, she’s played everyone, picked from obscurity because she’s a fucking nazi! Don’t you dare feel sorry for her, she despises you!
“No,” he groans, trying to twist away. His hands can move now, even though it’s slow, and uncoordinated. He pushes the woman on his chest, confused. He doesn’t know where he is, really. He doesn’t know why he’s here. Someone slaps his face. It hurts, and then they –
Since then, since he got home,
“Worried?”
Maybe he can get a job. Not a crazy job, not – not a CEO, or Secretary of State, or superhero. He could work in a garage, or fix people’s cars for them. Or fix computers or something. Enough to have food, clothes, pay his bills. And he could exist like that, he could happily exist like that, if the world left him alone he would leave it too. It would be okay. It could still all be okay.
“Goodnight, Tony.”
“Peggy kept all old your inventions. Some of them still worked. Saw your toaster gun. You were quite a little firebug as a toddler,” said Steve.
Steve nodded.
“Good morning, Piper,” said Lena.
“Can you get us out?” asked Fleur.
Eventually, they went to their tents. Fleur separated him from Natasha.
He was thrown out the window. His suit crashed through the window, diving after him. It wrapped around him, moments before he would have hit the ground. He zoomed up the tower, facing Loki.
“It won’t be long until we reach S.H.I.E.L.D., try and rest,” said Hill.
Tony jumped on sliding down missing Killian’s demise. He was tossed into the sky. Tony closed his eyes accepting his fate. A suit closed around. It struggled to land him safely. He crashed down, beaten but alive. The empty helmet of Mark 42 landed at his feet. He stared at the empty flaming image. A figure emerged from the flaming destruction. The charred formed moved toward him. He struggled to get to his feet.
“I’m sorry, sir.”
Steve helped him out of his clothes then tucked him into bed.
"No."
Steve got up. He rubbed his lower back.
“This better be good, Dr. Zemo, to drag me all the way out here.”
“No, my mom was on the board. That gives me some sway. I know how you value your privacy,” said Tony.
Halfway through the episode, Piper pulled away.
“This 1200 cc of Extremis. Less than half of this can kill the average person. It could take hours for it to take effect. I wonder how it will interact with that serum pumping through you? Shall we find out?”
“Too bad.”
“It’s the right thing to do.”
“My thoughts exactly," said Steve with a smile.
He offered to teach Rune, but the boy had no interest in science. Rune preferred baking and cooking for the moment. There was nothing wrong with that. He was only five; there was plenty of time for him to learn.
Tony massaged the tension from his shoulders.
Steve walked to the nest, allowing himself to fall in. His hand traveled through the blankets, touching on something cool. He pulled it toward him. In his hand was a Hot Wheels car, a 1941Pontiac Streamliner. Piper had made him memorize every toy car in her vast collection. He found several other toys in the nest.
“Alright,” said Rhodes.
His view locked the Iron Patriot suit, soaring upward. He tried taking the air, but his thrusters failed him.
Tony pulled him away from the painting. He resisted.
“What happened?"
“Anything I should worry about?” asked Steve.
Piper pounced on the nearest one, bringing him to ground. She sent her fist clear through his chest, then yanked her hand free with a sickening crunch and hurtled the corpse toward the rest. A distraction long enough to let her grab hold of her next victim.
Piper instantly seemed more interested in a nearby toy. Steve smiled. Tony was in China, having gone stir crazy after his surgery. Bedrest was torture for Tony. At times Steve was almost tempted to tie him to the bed. That thought planted far too many blush-inducing ideas in the omega’s head. He touched the second band he wore on his ring finger. Made of the melted down metal pieces removed from Tony's heart, it was one of Steve’s most prized possessions.
“Who are your flower girls?” she asked.
The relaxation brought upon by his touch allowed the anesthesia to take effect. Tony allowed some of the tension to leave his shoulders when Steve's eyes closed. Ever so often there was a clink of the metal pieces of shrapnel being removed. Every thirty minutes Steve would wake up in the same fearful state only for him to soothe it away. It went on like that for ten hours. The most draining ten hours of Tony's life. Finally, it was over. Blackwell started stapling closed the wound. Tony cringed as the tube was pulled from Steve’s throat. Despite the discomfort of the site he was relieved to see Steve was breathing on his own. Steve was wheeled back to his room. Tony caught his name on a piece of bloody shrapnel.
“I think Loki is trying to wind us up. This is a man who means to start a war. And if we don’t stay focused he’ll succeed. We have orders we should follow them,” said Steve.
Steve noticed the beta was twitching. "We should be safe here for the time being. Tony set up the security system here."
Curiosity getting the best of her, Piper peaked around Winter’s leg, taking a good look at the woman. Her scent was gentle and welcoming. It made Piper long for the comfort of Papa's scent. Her eyes were dark brown, and light brown hair cut short. She wore a yellow shirt, khaki pencil skirt, and clogs, with a white doctor's coat on top. The woman didn't look dangerous; yet, appearances meant nothing here.
"Fair point, but it didn't win me any battles with your papa. Got me into trouble in multiple relationships, personal and professional,” said Tony.
"Don't stress yourself out. There's plenty of time to figure it out."
“She did? How did that come up?”
“Leave him alone! Even on his worst day, he could outrun you.”
He looked up in surprise when the elevator doors opened. Tony wasn't due home until later tonight. Natasha strode in, dressed in civilian clothes.
“Ask away,” he said.
"5:30 pm," said Jarvis.
Tony nearly choked on his cookie. He pounded on his chest, managed to get control of his breathing. Not commenting on the idea of a pup with Steve would be the quickest way for her to drop the subject. It proved far too appealing to his inner alpha.
“So you have nothing,” said Tony.
“Remember that game barrel of monkeys. That’s what we’re going to do,”
She glared up at him from the ground, getting to her feet.
“No!” growled Piper, moving closer to Daddy.
“Fuck, I’ll be there in a minute.”
“Where are you taking him?” asked Steve.
Steve hated the idea of taking the time to punch out a message on the small key of his phones. It seemed so impersonal. He’d much rather have a phone call and hear the other person’s voice. In this case, though, he was okay with it. After breakfast, he would go to Edith’s office. Steve went to the café. A few agents were already there. He filled his tray and went to a table. Other agents stopped staring at the quantity of food he had to eat. He poked at the scrambled eggs at his plate. Steve finished his meal before heading to the medical wing. He knocked on the door to Edith’s office.
"There's nothing to tell. I don't remember it."
“Are they kids?” Were there really others like her? Was she not as alone as she thought?
“In the lab,” said Jarvis.
"You've broken your nasal bone."
“It shouldn’t be happening. I thought the stress would stop it. It has before,” insisted Steve.
A military photo, footage of the explosion, and newspaper articles pulled up.
“I don’t know,” he said.
“I’ll let you answer that,” said Tony retreating the couch. "Come on baby girl you're with me."
“I love her,” Steve hedged.
“We learn how to control it. We'll be with you the entire way," he said, holding her hands.
"It's the law, sweetheart. I hate to have you getting pulled over."
“Tech talk goes over my head. Puts me right to sleep."
“Tony Stark.”
“We’ll find her and makes sure she pays for what she did to us,” said Piper.
“JARVIS!”
“Can’t help it," said Steve.
“What this?”
“Morning beautiful.”
"In a few months, you won't be able to do this."
"Then all the attention was going toward a good cause. It wasn't so intensely focused on my personal life," said Steve.
"Steve, I've told I don't mind. It will be good for me to spend more time with Piper."
“And Rune?” asked Pepper.
“I’m Thor.”
“How old is he?” asked Pepper.
“I’m not much of a threat to anyone. You have the upper hand,” said Matt.

"Heard muffled yelling upstairs but couldn't make out what it was about. But I'm guessing it was about me."
“She’s crowning. Give me a big push,” said Edith.
“He’s perfectly healthy, sir. It’s only a matter of time. Preparations need to be made. It's been repressed for seventy years. It will be horrible for him,” she said.
“Watson let him be,” she said. The dog yielded and trotted back into the house. “You’re just in time for tea."
Hours ticked by, the pup only abandoning her work when meals came. She fell asleep in the center of the images. Winter stood over her, taking a look at her work. It was an exact image of his arm taking up half the floor. The crayon she was using was only a small nub. In blue, she's scribbled something that resembled words.
“He's running into some traffic. I’m sure he’ll be here,” said Phil.
Steve settled by his side again.  He was never much for cuddling, but he could make an exception for Steve. The touch of their skin was almost electric. The movie started playing. Steve started purring softly.
“Yeah/”
The receptionist dropped the phone. “Of course, Mr. Stark, I’ll have a nurse show you right away."
Tony went to the footage of Extremis human testing. The subject began to glow as they were injected with the serum. Their screams were a jolt to his system. One of the subjects showed signs of rejections. The others were escorted out of the room. The man exploded seconds later in a flash of orange light.
“I know he’s back,” she said.
“Get changed,” said Natasha.
"Steve, I think it might be better if you left." It pained in him to say it. He was sure Steve would understand. He was only trying to do what was best.
Tony was working on omelets. The last time he cooked for anyone was Pepper. He considered renting out the MoMa but decided against it. It would bring to much press. He wanted to keep Steve hidden for his own reasons. As soon as the news of Captain America being alive, there would be countless suitors pursuing the omega. Steve came in, smiling brightly. Tony almost burnt the omelet. He was so caught in the smile.
Breakfast finished around ten.
Steve tore open the gift, tossing off the lid. Inside was a key.
“My physical capabilities, yes.” His mind not so much. “I wasn’t speaking of that power. I believe you’re capable of more than you know in a normal state.”
Tony made room for him in bed, taking him into his arms. They touched their foreheads together. Closing his eyes as Tony fingers ran through his hair, Steve said, “I love you.”
She took her parents’ hands as they went down to the garage. Piper glared at the car seat, but she buckled herself in anyway. She looked out the window, trying to figure out where exactly they were going. Piper screamed with joy when they pulled into the FDNY Firehouse Engine 54, smiling brightly as they exited the car.
"You're good," said Piper, defeatedly.
"When will I see you next?" asked Steve.
"Yes, and they are far more relatable for a child soldier, even though Piper and Rune started their training at a far younger age than most."
“Pup?”

“And that was enough to make you feel better?”
“Does Pepper know?” he asked.
Steve only scowled at her. Best to go with the truth no matter how little he'd want to hear it. Or how bad he'd take it.
“One of the best in Brazil," said Tony.
Theodore nodded. Piper brought the tray over and they ate silently.
Tony rolled a fresh sheet of paper on the table. Piper preferred working out everything on paper. She'd have to get out of the habit when she was older.
"Cute, you should frame that."
Steve and Tony were relieved to hear that sound. It was terrific after not hearing it for so long. Out of habit, Steve took a napkin and wipe the powdered sugar and jelly from her cheeks.
“It’s all tall buildings so tall they seem to touch the sky. And nestled between all those buildings is Central Park. A great big piece green in the middle of the city. When it dark is when it truly comes alive. All the lights go on. There are so many you could probably see them from the moon.”
"Yes. And even if I fail, he still makes for marvelous experimental material."
He flinched before obeying.
*****
“Why not?” asked Peggy.
Around three Jarvis alerted them to Dr. Banner’s arrival. Steve put on a shirt.
Steve smirked.
"Your a once in a generation genius, Piper."
She let him in. He took the top bunk above hers.
“Alpha’s it’s fine." He patted Tony's shoulder.
“This is the Mandarin?” said Rhodes.
“How are you feeling?"
“Fine,” said Tony. He placed a quick peck on Steve's cheek before heading to the shower.
“Sir, there’s been a visitor at your family’s grave plot in New York,” said Jarvis.
“I love you.”
*****
“You aren’t."
“You’re being modest,” said Tony.
“I’m sorry, Uncle Steve.”
Lena hoped it was a needless precaution. With an organization such as Hydra, one could never be too careful. The child stared at her blankly, awaiting a command. It had never taken Lena so long to put a subject under trance. Piper’s willful mind was likely the cause of the delay.
“Do think I’d be asking a pregnant omega to do this if I wasn’t desperate,” said Fury.
"Sir, a Dr. Star is here," said Jarvis.
“I’m your government-endorsed babysitter. I’m being paid to be here, but I think it's unneeded. It's clear all you want to do is get back to him."
She waved her little hand. The bots mimicked the motion. She giggled. Tony smiled and placed Piper in her playpen. Dum-E and U moved to watch her. He played with her for a few minutes. Piper nearly yanked him into the playpen when he tried taking his hand away.
“I hate it when they fight. They've been doing it more since I got home,” said Piper.
“Jarvis.”
Maya faded away. Her body was dragged away. He would find her. Her family should have that. The metallic scent of her blood lingered.
The older alpha had gone still in his shock.
"What about you, dear friend, Winter? He has more blood on his hands than I do."
“It’s fine.”
Fury was beyond pissed. Somehow a bomb managed to sneak through security measures and blow up a great bio lab, killing three of their scientists and maiming the survivor. What was more agitating, the geniuses under his payroll were struggling to recreate the device.
“Stay," said Tony. He pulled his hand away.
“I’ll try not to,” said Piper.
“Time.”
“So what else do you want to?”
"Aren't you a little old for me to explain this? Well, when two consenting adults love each other-
He couldn’t agree to marriage without being honest. Tony's hand went to his pocket.
“I didn’t. Your attack was a lot easier to catch than Winter’s.”
Three weeks passed since Steve returned from his mission. His free days were spent with Tony. Talking with the alpha every night helped him sleep. It gave him a few extra hours of sleep. Tony even comforted after his night terrors. They went out as frequently as possible. Clint and Natasha teased him, but they were happy for him. Steve closed his locker.
“Good. Don’t forget. And don’t leave it, either, I don’t want him to — I have to go. Tell him bye, and I miss him already.”
"You need to get as much support from this relationship as I have, Steve. That's all I want. It's not one-sided. If you need me to do something for you, if you need to vent, I'm here. Hiding this from me is insulting. I'm not stupid. It makes me feel like you don't trust me, and there's more to a relationship than taking me down and making me breakfast in bed, understand?"
“What did I – why are you…” Tony trails off. He thinks, the carpet is scratchy under his palms, and he hopes it isn’t bugs. “What did I do?”
It's so sweet, the way he trusts. Steve runs a hand through his hair, sighs. He wonders what goes through a subs mind when they're like this. He knows all the scientific literature, of course, certain states trigger hormones that send the sub under, but he can't imagine. A dom high and a sub dropped... those are two very different feelings.
“Dinner,” he explains. “We’re still on for dinner, right?”
He can’t imagine Tony ever willingly doing something like that now, laughing as Steve worked himself up in bed and kissing him deeply when he was finished, with his spend dripping down Steve’s balls. He can’t imagine him ever sleeping in a bed like he owns it, or ordering Steve to do anything at all. He wants to brush Tony’s soft hair from his brow, cheeks, but he knows that luxury is no longer afforded to him, not after what happened.
“That there was anyone out there? You’d have believed it, sure. But not like this.”
The words sound strange out of his mouth, it’s obvious they haven’t made them many times before.  Strange must have tried to comfort him, talk to him. The kid is hanging on by a thread. “It’s fine,” Steve says, to medical staff who creep close, offering to take him off his hands, “I’ll handle it. Help the others.”
choice
“My turn,” says another, and they pull him off of the knee, sprawl him out on the couch. This one is old, and he is large. The weight of him crushes, when he covers him entirely, starts to kiss him. Tony’s hands are above his head, unbound and useless. His fingers barely twitch. His legs are spread, one wrapped around the man’s back, the other in the air. He moans. The man starts to suck lines into his throat and Tony acquiesces, makes soft little sex sounds. It feels good. Everything feels good.
“And Pierce, he – “
Pierce dabs at his cheek, spits blood. The knife caught him deep; had punctured the skin, into his mouth. “Bitch,” he croaks, frothy red bubbles dribbling out the side of his wound.
“Hmm?” He’s half-asleep, now.
“You don’t
Steve turns to the girl. “This one,” he repeats. “Does he have a name?”
“Enough,” Bruce says, abruptly. “That kind of talk – it doesn’t do anyone any kind of favours. Just forget it.”
Sorry for the lifetime long wait. I will finish this eventually. Warnings for suicidal thoughts and general depression.
“Do you trust me?” Steve asks, ragged.
“I didn’t say that,” Tony starts, choosing his words carefully. “I’m just saying, I like your whole – you know,” is he – is he fumbling for words? No, that’s not it, that can’t be it. “Uh,” he gestures with his hands, “this. Very alpha, very nice.”
“I loved them as much as… any kid who was taken care of mostly by nannies, and shuttled between tutors and private school by a driver, can love their parents.” That’s not fair, Tony thinks. He
“He can’t. They won’t let him.”
Pierce looks at him, uncapping the bottle. “It’s – very expensive,” he says.
It’s Steve who holds out his meds with a glass of water, helps him swallow. Tony longs for their dreariness, for their cover and the way they make the world go beautifully fuzzy at the edges. Sometimes they scare him. Most of the time, they quiet the voices and allow him to sit peacefully, reading or watching a film, or TV or whatever.
“I did,” Tony mutters, balling his hands into fists. “I did try. Almost had him. We almost had him, and the Quill fucked it up – “
So he stretches. “J,” he yawns “who’s up there?”
“You should follow the thought through.”
He wonders if that means Steve’s lived here before, or if he worked extra hard to make sure Tony wouldn’t be left without a bit of him. Even now, staring up at a corrugated iron ceiling with a switched-off fluorescent light, Tony is starting to feel sick at the loss of him. Like he’s lacking a limb. Like he’s missing a sense.
Fury’s lips twitch upwards. “Fine,” he says, kicking the shredder underneath his desk, depositing the file. “You got me. I bat for you. But can I show you something spooky?”
“You sure are obsessed with my mouth.”
Thor rounds on Clint. The air crackles, and almost bursts. Natasha’s hair is floating in air, standing on end, and Clint looks like he’s been electrocuted. “Don’t be simple,” he says heavily. “Where I come from, fighting side by side with a man is enough to bind you together for life.”
A beat. “But he doesn’t sleep well if – “
You agree, don’t you, Steve? You have my back on this? Because I think we need to start now. Build this team, ground up, I know what you’re thinking, ‘who’s this crazy guy, why’s he asking me to live with him, I’ve known him five minutes,” Tony laughs uneasily, “but this isn’t going to stop. They know us, now. We have a big fat target on the back of our – “
“Yeah.” Tony uncovers his eyes, slowly. “I do,” he says, more firmly.
“I mean touch. That’s all. It’s not a big deal, you don’t need to make a scene. Just sack him and get someone else.”
“That’s right. Put your head down, go on. On the pillow. You’ll feel better lying down.”
"Remember what I said?" Steve says, softly.
“That’s very old-fashioned of you, Tony,” and Steve sounds approving. “Are you offering to move in?”
“You couldn’t… move out? On your own?”
embarrassing that even you don’t want it released?”
“Hmm?”
reflects badly on all of it. It makes us look uncoordinated, it makes me look weak.”
He flinches. “Pierce is going to help me make it go away,” he says, eyes tightly shut. “Please. I know what people will think. Please don’t think that. It was a mistake. I made a mistake, it was a mistake. I didn’t want it, but it was too late, and…”
“He was a hero,” Thor says. “A soldier, a brother, a partner. We wish him well.”
He doesn’t say, Caracas won’t turn into a sinkhole. Instead, he says, “That would never be your fault. People have to stop eventually. You’re not lazy.”
“Still sleeping,” Steve says, taking the tray. “I don’t know if he’s up to seeing anyone yet.”
“If you want… I don’t…”
“He wasn’t religious.”
“Yeah,” Bruce says out the side of his mouth, “or whatever they call PTSD on Asgard.”
Tony snorts. “Sure, Cap. Sad and pathetic life, that’s me.”
When they’re far enough away that no one can hear Peter’s curses, he loosens his grip, lets him pull away. “Bastard!” He screams again, bent double with it. No one hears it. “He
“Shawarma.”
“I can’t, Tony,” Steve soothes. “Here, shuffle.” He’s sliding under the covers, gently letting Tony lower his head onto his chest. “I can help. It’s fine. I know it hurts, but first you have to just shut your eyes, and it’ll get better.”
It pains Steve to think that that year and a half is the best year of his life ever lived. How they were all so full of hope. Steve, so close to finding Bucky, with a family, and friends. Tony, believing in the change he was enacting, free of the reactor in his chest. Tony smiled often back then. He stopped drinking so much.
There’s an awkward moment where — Steve can see, it’s on Natasha’s lips — where she almost says ‘he’s not here anymore, so it doesn’t matter’. But she curtails herself before she can open her mouth and cause irreparable damage. “I know,” she says gently. “But I’ve called the old firm, and they’re sending a new cleaner. So you won’t have to worry about it, okay?”
sceptical, but he should.
“He probably has better things to do.”
“So Pierce is dead. And Rumlow. Rogers doesn’t do things by halves, does he? Not that I need to tell you,” he adds. “I hear Tiberius Stone is wheeling himself around these days. And Killian’s body is in a freezer somewhere, one head down.”
It’s strange, being in this room –
"Excellent." Steve says, deftly tightening it behind Tony's head. "You're doing so well tonight."
Tony seems to accept this, solemn, quiet, lips pressed into a line. It’s his duty. Tony is man of duty, if nothing else.
“I don’t know, I guess I just thought – sex is sex, right? You already have sex tapes online.”
“I’ll just tell the truth.”
“C’mere,” Steve says softly, pulling him up. “Yeah. I’m sorry, I didn’t want to wake you. You seemed tuckered out.”
“After you,” he insists, glaring. It’s a short, tense stand-off, that Tony predictably loses.
“You smell like shit.”
“We should take off the make-up,” he says, conciliatory. “Here.” He helps him sit on the edge of the bath, balances him with a hand to the shoulder. “Is there – is there something I should use? To take it off better?”
Steve is eating the slick out of him, determined, very thorough. Precise, is the word Tony thinks haphazardly, moaning like a whore in heat, head tipped back. He wishes, they were in bed. He wishes, it hadn’t been seven months. He wishes, just once, that he had picked up the phone.
“Good,” he says, succinctly, “if you promise me you did it clean, and you didn’t get anyone else involved.”
Pierce cards his fingers through Tony’s hair, lifts up his head. He tsks, and dabs at a string of drool from the corner of his mouth. “Good boy,” he says, as if Tony has done something, and then strokes him back down onto the pillow, scratches his nails absently against the back of Tony’s neck. “You’re the most responsive omega I’ve ever seen, did you know that, Tony? Unbelievable. Even at your age, you just feel it all so keenly, don’t you?” He rubs his knuckles behind Tony’s ear; he shivers.
And Tony doesn’t care. Steve pulls away, lightly thumbs his lower lip. “I’ve got to do the rounds,” he says, “I want you naked and in bed by the time I get there.”
he thinks before he can be shocked by the possessiveness.
“I should – “ Steve murmurs, voice thick with sleep. “I should say, thank you.”
“I understand,” Tony says heavily, eyes closing.
His hand is glowing red, like an ember, his fingers tipped almost molten white. Tony can feel the heat radiating off of him, fire, raw, bare flame. He shakes his head, best he can.
Steve manages to push Tony's head between his knees just as he vomits. Nothing really comes up; it's just his stomach reacting to the vertigo as he gags onto the floor. The sudden movement probably doesn't help, though. When Steve tips Tony back, his eyes roll into his head and he groans.
“It’s fine.”
“I love you,” Tony says again, and his fingers trace Steve’s cheek. Touch him, really touch him. For just a second, Steve is there, in a golden hall, drinking, dancing. His friends cheer, and air is warm, soft against skin. Tony is smiling, his eyes are laughing. “I’ll see you on the other side,” he whispers against Steve’s lips, and pushes him away.
“Deal,” Fury nods, even though he doesn’t seem happy about it.
This was Tony’s game, now. Set them off against each other and accuse Steve of taking Bucky’s side. Steve didn’t rise to it, he wouldn’t. He may have dealt with everything else piss poorly, but this, at least, he has: he would stand up, take Tony’s arm, lead him to the bedroom, and let him smash and break and scream. And afterwards, when he was exhausted, vomiting, sick with withdrawal, Steve would lay him in the bed, tuck him up, and turn out the light.
“Thank you,” he says. “
“Tony,” he agrees. “Tony. Here,” he inches closer, “you want to scent me, sweetheart? You can, if you want, I don’t mind.”
For the country.”
Steve frowns. “There’s… there’s something. I can’t.”
His chest is hot against the line of Tony’s back, sweating. Tony’s cock remains untouched, hanging between his thighs.
Not the whole truth. Tony had told him plenty. Even when Steve felt he couldn’t bear to hear it anymore, Tony kept telling him, because it was his way of baring it all.
be put down on paper, recorded. Such was his fucking beauty.
He’s deadly serious, calmly rolling up his sleeves. Tony is – kinda turned on, to be honest. It’s hot, watching him defend his honour.
Maybe Nick has Tony’s back more than Tony realised in the first place. Or, he’s being a manipulative bastard. He
“Hey, birdbrain.” He croaks, and Clint crouches, checks his pupils, presses the comm in his ear. “Affirmative,” he says “we have Cap.” He pulls out water from his pack, glances briefly at Gus’ inert form. “Who is he?” He says after he tugs the bottle from Steve’s lips “Where’s Tony.”
“Yeah,” Steve had agreed. “Amen to that.”
Steve pulls at his bowtie, shrugs off his tux jacket. “You look so fucking sweet, and you have no idea.”
“Nick, I’m just going to steal it otherwise. Let me make a copy.”
It’s not nice, it’s not pleasant, it’s true. Steve knows – Steve has always told him – the way he behaves reflects on them, it does. Tony knows this. If anyone sees this picture – if anyone ever –
“You don’t mind,” Pierce says regretfully, kissing his hand. “I know this is torture.”
He sits him up, tells him to breathe in and out. Tony shakes his head; he doesn’t want to breathe. He wants to hyperventilate until his lungs can’t contract or expand, until he’s wheezing, choking, gone –
Seconds stretch on. He hears the voice sigh. “Wait,” he blurts “I’m here,” he whispers, furtive.
And in hindsight, Steve was telling the truth. He didn’t leave. Tony did.
Steve drops his hand to the back of Tony’s neck, cups it, thumb dragging over his sensitive nape. He seems to like the little shudder Tony gives him, the appreciative wiggle, because he does it again.
“I don’t ever have to tell you. You wanted to know where you’d be, after I came home from the job? You’d be in bed. Naked,” Steve adds, “always, because you know you’re not going to be needing clothes, not for a long while. Only thing on you is my collar, with my tag. And it’s the best you’ve ever fucking had, Tony, I can tell you that for sure. You fucking love it. Maybe I take you on your knees, or I let you ride me. By the time I’m done? You’re so loose I can use four fingers, easy enough, and you beg for that, too. You clean them off when I’m finished.”
Peter turns. “Daughter?” He whispers.
Two hours later, and he finds Steve in conversation with last person he’d expect to find at a military shin-dig. Dalcher, pretty young Dalcher, with the perky tits and kind smile, whose hair is now greying in places, and whose face is lined. How long has it been? “You never kept in touch,” she says, but there’s no vitriol there; she likely understands, given the circumstances.
There are too many ghosts.
Worse. Send him into Pierce’s arms.
It’s brown, crumpled. Very inconspicuous, could be anything. Steve’s cheeks – flush slightly, maybe. It could just be because the fire is close, and too warm. It’s nice, Tony thinks, the way he gets that blush high on his cheekbones. It reminds him he’s not just a righteous, angry alpha with a complex. He has a nice side, probably.
Steve is stiff. He isn’t looking at Tony, won’t even turn his head. “It doesn’t interfere with my work,” he tells him, like that’s the most important thing.
The man leans over him to grab something, salt or sauce or whatever, and Tony reels back, blinking rapidly. Sam Wilson raises an eyebrow, but he smiles gently, in a friendly way, rests a hand on his shoulder and asks ‘are you alright?’
“I’m – kinda trying to figure out what to do with you, Stark.”
A lull. “How’s the hand?” Steve asks.
He rubs his eyes. "I hope you're happy," he says, "truly. I don't even mean that in a cynical, jack-ass kind of way. I hope Barnes is still there, and you two are happy. I hope you get some kind of closure, Stevie. I hope the nightmares aren't keeping you up at night, still. I..." Tony waves his hand. "I guess I don't have it in me to be resentful right now. Let's see how I feel if I live, huh? For what it's worth -- it could have been you. I don't know. It's not worth burning up the mental energy for now, anyway. I love you, Steve. I hope I make a pretty corpse."
There’s something thrown in his face, freezing, dumped over his head. Ice slips down his chest, burning cold liquor. The smell of it – he feels violently sick, he doesn’t know why. They laugh. “Go on, then,
“Don’t sweat it,” Natasha tells him. “We’ve all been there.”
He wonders how long they’ve been here. He wonders who wrapped his arm. He wonders…
Steve blinks. “Is he — ”
Tony hastily throws on his jacket. “I’ll leave first,” he says, “you follow after, two minutes behind, agreed?”
me, Steve. What kind of monster am I – “
Steve shrugs. “Isn’t here fine?” He moves, pushing forward, Tony stumbling back and back until his back hits the glass window. “You’re not shy, are you?” He mocks.
Steve frowns. He’s slowly stroking Tony’s leg under the blanket. “Sure, Tony. Of course I do, how could I not?”
Steve shifts him. He grunts, and lifts Tony’s hips, bends him over the railing so his chest is hanging over air, the only thing stopping gravity from doing it’s job is
He doesn’t hold the charade for long, looking over his shoulder and smiling, naturally good-natured. “Tony,” he says, like he’s genuinely happy to see him, “you came.”
Tony slides down the wall, grips the bruise where Steve’s fingers had held him. “It’s okay, I’m fine, please don’t – “
Tony stumbles forward. “Oh yeah,” he agrees, dazedly, drifting towards the elevator. “Very productive. Should do it again some time. Definitely.”
Sarah throws him a pillow and settles down with the cake. “Eat that,” she says “make my day.”
And then he starts to cry, and the sobs are so loud and vicious Steve folds easily, onto his knees, so Rhodey can clench his fingers in his shirt and scream into his shoulder. It’s not fair, Steve thinks objectively. It’s not fair.
It makes his chest curdle, a heavy weight settle on his shoulders. He leaves the coffee grounds, takes his breakfast back to the bedroom that he and Tony shared.
Tony is loosening his bowtie so it hangs around his neck. “Do you still like gags?” He asks.
As usual, I love to hear how you think the characters are coming across? So Diana and Natasha and whoever else. It's a big help!
“They should fuck,” someone says, abruptly. The laughter stops. The song runs out.
Steve slaps him, three fingers, once, twice, against his cheek. Tony’s prick is so fucking hard, he can feel the slick wet on his thighs, thick inside his hole, slipping out of him humiliatingly, dribbling onto the concrete. “You like that, yeah?” Steve says roughly, gripping his hair, shaking him. “You like it when I treat you like that, Stark?”
“Mmm,” Tony agrees, carefully climbing into the tub. He slips between Steve’s legs, his back to his chest. He intertwines their hands.
“Alright. Get comfy. I have some spare toothbrushes under the sink, and you can wear one of my shirts. If you give me your clothes, I can have them washed by tomorrow.”
Steve steadies him with a hand on his shoulder; light, grounding. “Open your mouth,” he asks, quietly. “Any last words?”
But he can’t remember standing on Pierce’s patio, with Steve near lifeless, bloody and beaten. He doesn’t remember shaking him until he woke, slowly, only to take Tony’s shoulders and squeeze him, and sob, even while the house smoked behind them. He doesn’t remember that. In Tony’s memory, what’s left of it, Steve shushes him gently and that’s that.
“The word is ‘avenge’. Revenge would mean – getting revenge on the people I miss. You revenge the lost. You avenge them.”
“Fine,” Tony says, making sure his voice is sweet and soft in the way Steve will say he doesn’t like, but will love when he thinks it’s been offered up genuinely. “C’mon. Don’t steal all of my side of the blanket.”
“Maybe that’s for the best.”
“About earlier,” Steve says.
Tony doesn’t, really. He thinks Steve might have tried to take him to see Rhodey, and Tony might have — sounded off, a little, in the back of the car. “But I was in New York today. I was actually in the city.”
“Home?”
Steve’s hands on his shoulders. Tony’s back against the lockers; he grunts. “Ouch,” he says, pointedly.
“They
Tony nods. His collar clinks.
you’re there, you fucking perverts, he’s not your plaything, he’s not your tool, you don’t get to
“Tell me what to do,” Tony asks, because he can’t be bothered to dress it up. He just wants to hear Steve’s voice, giving him instruction.
Steve is sobbing.
He coughs, bile and blood. “You don’t make this easy, hmm, Tony?” Pierce says quietly, dabbing at his chin with a napkin.
“I will,” Pierce smiles at him, gently, letting open the door. “Here. Nice and safe now, hmm? Why don’t you put yourself on the bed, I’ll get some water.”
Tony sighs, lets Steve run the water over his head. He feels it spill over his shoulders, down his spine, loves the way Steve's strong fingers work against his head. The sound of water soothes him. "Thank you," he murmurs "for earlier. It was a good scene."
Tony kisses him. It’s harsh, and his fingers are digging into Steve’s chest, possessive, painful. It’s over in less than a handful of seconds, and then he’s pushing Steve away, collapsing so fast Steve has to hold him up. “It’s not the same,” he breathes, and then his face starts to screw up. “Oh God, it’s not the same, it’s not — “
Tamping that down. Holding back. So he can move his finger around Tony’s palm?
Tony falls on his task with vigour. He bobs his head, taking Steve's fingers as best he can without the flexibility of his lips to ease the way. He looks up, as if to check that Steve approves, and Steve smiles, nodding. Tony can be that way, sometimes, slightly needier than any other sub he's ever had, but it's not so bad. As long as he knows he's doing well, he's so much more eager to please.
“The father? He put the ropes in your hand? He told you where to stick those bottles?”
“Is it?” Tony asks weakly. “Because — even if I leave here, I have nothing. And no one.”
It feels good, though. Maybe. Just a little.
“Not a real one. But sure.” Tony pokes Steve with his toes. “If you ever want to… tie me up,” he says, lightly, “just let me know in advance. I’ll buy the rope.”
And then no one touches him.
Tony’s smile is kind, his eyes crinkling. His hands are ghosting Steve’s shoulders, as if pulling him into an embrace. He seems to be imploring him, somehow, and so Steve nods. “Death is nothing,” he says.
He pulls his hand out of his panties, swipes them on the duvet. Curls on his side and goes back to stroking his neck, listening to Steve’s soft groans. He wishes he could be there. He wishes he was there to make those noises come out of Steve’s mouth. “I love it when
“Not everything,” Steve tries, although he knows the words are bitter in his mouth, that – that at the time, had he been in Tony’s place, he would have felt the same way. That after the war, and after what happened, he also felt abandoned by Tony. That he couldn’t understand why Tony wouldn’t just – why he couldn’t help, or see, or at least – try to understand the way Steve, at least, tried to understand.
of the thing. It’s not like he can stop Steve from unbuttoning his shirt anyway.
Natasha is the one who pours the blood into his mouth. Gus grips weakly at her wrist as she gently lays him down, careful not to spill a drop. Steve is thankful for it, that she has little fear, and that she can so easily pour Gus’ food down his throat.
They have to carry the body.
“C’mon,” the man blusters. “He’s not a – it was a joke.”
And it’s better, gone. It’ll grow back. It doesn’t matter. It feels good to just take the whole thing off, giggling. He hopes it disgusts them all. He hopes when people see him, they recoil and think,
that you read those books to try and make up with me. And I really love that you care enough about me to bother.”
Tony watches the back of Steve’s head. Each of the little blond hairs on his nape, the freckles on his shoulders. His hair is darker than it was when they first met. He pillows his head on his arm, traces out a figure of eight on his back. Gentle, like. Maybe, not eight – a snake eating itself. Or, infinity.
“Maybe over dinner?” Steve blurts. Tony grinds to a halt. “I mean – if you’re not busy. Maybe over some dinner, I don’t know.”
Tony thinks, drowsily, but he doesn’t know why.
“Known? Known what? Steve, do you know what it’s like to have everyone just — leave you? And I mean, not have them forcibly wrenched away by — by some time spent in ice or a freak accident or aging or whatever. I mean everyone literally deciding that there are other places, other people, they would rather see. And I sunk — I sunk fucking everything into this project, Steve. Every fibre I had, I gave to the Avengers. And then you all left. I was happy. I thought — I don’t know, that I had someone who loved me? And friends. And I was making a difference. But you, you hurt me most of all, because you told me you loved me, and then you went. And after, all you could send me was the fucking letter, and you never called, and during the trials you didn’t try to reach out, and oh I know you probably had your reasons, that you couldn’t risk your team, which I understand, I understand that the good of the many comes first, but — but it hurt. You see? That’s all. It hurt me, Steve, real bad. Somewhere deep. And it still hurts. And no matter what kind of guilt driven help you think you can give me, no matter how many times you tell me you love me and force feed me till I choke, I can’t forget it. Because it happened. And I was never your first choice. I was never anyone’s first choice. Except maybe — except maybe Rhodey’s. And now he’s gone too.”
he’d said,
“Oh, God, alive,” Ross quickly reassures, apparently aware of Tony’s mild panic. “Nothing like that, no. He got himself into a – well, it’s hard to explain. We need your help.”
“Well, I was glad to be invited,” Steve tells him, warmly. Tony thinks,
Steve could say,
“This place is a dump,” Clint mutters, family gone. “He didn’t have it cleared?”
“Then get a job.”
“Yeah, well.” Tony leans forward, kisses his nose. “Light on or light off?”
“I want a new physiotherapist,” Tony says one morning without preamble.
“On your knees, Mister. We’re not savages here. Do it the way I know they taught you at whatever fancy school you went to.”
Steve’s hands pull away. “I shouldn’t do all the work,” he says, “after all, you’re the one wanting to make reparations.”
“Dating sounds childish. We were partners. Real, actual partners. We dated for three years, from around the first Chitauri attack right up to Siberia. After, he would tell me he still loved me. He said he wanted me to get better. He promised we would move away together, live in my old home in New York, but we never did. After I tried to kill myself for the second time he sent me back to the ward.”
“I’m not a doctor. Shit, Tony, I don’t know, I’m not a doctor. I don’t know what to say.”
Richards won’t look at it, turns his chin to the side. “It was a long time ago.”
“Well we have to stand up to the truth eventually,” the nurse sighs dramatically. “Jim, can I get you another pillow?”
“Nah,” Steve says, “I figure I’ll just finger fuck you till you come in your pants. Then you get to walk back to your floor just positively reeking of sex, huh Tony?” Steve’s voice is rough, and he’s half-smiling. Teasing.
“Come to bed,” he murmurs against his lips.
“Which is?”
Tony doesn’t let it phase him. He laughs. “Using big boy words, huh? Didn’t your mother ever tell you it’s bad to curse?”
“Well,” he says, “he certainly learnt never to steal from
Oh please, the first voice laughs, you won’t leave here, idiot. There’s only one way you get to leave here. They don’t want you, Tony, but they know how to use you, and there are still things you’re good for. Hey, maybe they’ll trot you out in front of the crowd, dress you up in a suit and use you for press tours, or get you back on those weapons. Maybe Steve will truss you up like a pony and use your ass, maybe you can be their beating boy, maybe Barnes will use you like a slave and Clint for target practice, it’s what you deserve, it’s what you deserve, it’s what you deserve –
She's propping him up with one hand, keeping him sitting on the edge of the bed -- not a bed, more like one of those things you get in doctor's offices, covered in a flimsy sheet of paper. He's wearing a blue hospital gown. It's chilly, and very, very bright.
“Why is it always me?! You’re an asshole, no one’s – oof.” Steve’s bracketing his head with his arms, the window freezing against his bare ass, sucking a line down his throat. “Oh,” Tony says, because his tongue has found his sweet-spot, just behind his ear, “oh, fuck.”
“Oh, God,” Steve tries to roll out of the bed, “I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry, Tony.” What a fool he is, a selfish fool, bringing that home for Tony to smell. He should have showered. Is he stupid? What did he think, how did he think Tony would react when he brought home to smell of his rapist into his
“So, it’s always been a status-symbol,” Tony continues, “to have an omega. Alphas, you make up, what, 25% of the population, tops? We’re 10%. So, no matter what, you’re always going to end up with an alpha that mates a beta, and goes on to just have beta and alpha kids. The real power comes when you’re an alpha – a prime alpha,” Tony winks, “much like yourself, who has the ability to
His instincts set his back up when he’s with him, but then, all alpha’s do that.
I killed five men, Tony, five men, with my own bare hands. And they have families, you know. They were
*warnings: both Tony and Steve are drugged at separate times in this chapter, and both have coerced/dubiously consensual sex*
Steve nods. Tony doesn’t sleep, not straight away; he listens to Steve’s even breathing, his thick arms curled around Tony’s chest. He nearly killed Stone for a few bad words and one bad touch.
Hands shaking. He flags down the cab, tells them Steve’s apartment building in a clipped, short voice. It’s burning a hole inside him, by his ribs. He should tear it up. Instead, he turns his nose into the collar of the Pierce’s coat, takes comfort from the scent. He wishes he wouldn’t.
Steve had said, well then what’s wrong, please Tony, let me help you. And Tony had told him, to his face, “I love you. I love you more than you could ever love me. And I’m so sorry I — I screwed it up, I fucked it up with Ultron. I’m sorry I made you see a side of me that wasn’t what you could handle. I — you’ll leave again one day, Steve. You’ll leave me. In ten years time you’ll still be young and I’ll be sixty. But I’m — stupid, and weak, and I love you, so I tell myself if I can have you even for this small time — “
Steve takes Tony's face in his hands, checks his pupils. "Are you dropping?" He asks.
“I – Steve,” he starts again, desperately, “
I'm not telling you to trust; the world is an ugly place. But never let paranoia take your brain like it's taken Howard's. Don't drink, if you can avoid it. Try your best, maybe.
“Since New York.”
flesh and blood.”
They had found Tony in the bathtub of his apartment in D.C.
Steve watches him silently. "I'm sorry." He says again. "I'm sorry I snapped at you."
He doesn’t knock on the bedroom door, they’re way past knocking. Steve is naked except for the briefs Tony told Natasha to buy him, channel surfing. “Hello,” he says, not peeling his eyes away from the TV.
Steve nods. “You couldn’t tell,” he says, putting his hand in his pocket. He pulls out the cigarettes, jerks his chin. “Want one?”
“Well, I’m awake now.”
“All of them,” she finishes, shortly.
Light fades fast. When Steve blinks, he’s gone. But he hears the humming, sweet and happy and somewhere distant. Fading now, but there all the same.
"It was a different kind of relationship. I was a lot smaller. And that almost his way of serving, you know? I think it kept him grounded. Gave him purpose." Steve pauses. "You know he was tortured."
“Sorry. I mean – yes. I can see why you might worry, or – I can see why.”
One foot in front of the other. The door, he sees, isn’t even closed – it’s been left slightly ajar, a soft warm light burring through the crack. Listlessly, Tony rests his head against the concrete wall, all cool and still; he listens to the sounds from beyond it.
“Sir,” one of the men in black says, pressing a finger to his ear. “There’s reports of rioting downtown. We need to get you somewhere safe.”
Tony shuts his eyes. “He’s safe too,” he lies.
“What is this, a party?”
“I can pick him up, after, if it’s easier for you?”
Tony sighs. He closes his eyes. "I'm concussed." He mumbles as he starts to slide out of the machine. "I am concussed."
He presses into Tony's mouth. "Suck." He says, again, and Tony cleans his come off of Steve's hand, movements sloppy and uncoordinated.
he manages, sucking a bruise into Tony’s throat.
The human’s suit tries to wrap around him, but it was damaged in the fight. Frail, he tries to crawl away, to lie himself out on the rock and wait to die. Nebula rolls her eyes. “Don’t you have
Why had he lied?
When drunk, Tony could go one of two ways: he could be your best friend, or your worst enemy. Steve learnt early to tell the two apart, to predict who he was getting before Tony even took a sip. If Tony arrived at his doorstep eyes shuttered, disheveled, shoulders tense and — most likely — briefcase in hand, Steve knew to silently pass him a shot, get it over with, like ripping off a bandaid.
Tony looks at him. Looks at the cards. Nudges them in his direction.
“Oh, it might hurt,” Tony admits. “It hurt me, a lot. But after? It’s not so bad.”
“Who said anything about fucking?”
you,” he teases, climbing his fingers up his chest, one by one. “You’ve won me.”
Rumlow jerks his chin to indicate he’s understood, but Tony feels his eyes on his back the whole way down the hall.
"No," Steve says, quietly. "He wasn't."
I am including this letter as a part of my will. Which, generally speaking, means that if you are reading this I am dead.
Steve shakes his head. “You were the only one,” he tells him. “All these years, you told me. Sometimes, you’d tell me, and I’d laugh. I thought you were – “ Crazy, eccentric, attention-seeking, joking, “worried. But you were right. And I’m sorry.”
Steve doesn’t give him that. Steve is a dependence. Steve is the very opposite of autonomy: if Tony stays, now, it means sharing beds, and breakfasts, and – power of attorneys. Very likely marriage. There will be children, and then Tony will never leave, no matter what. Steve will have him, always. Tony will be Of Rogers. A part of a whole.
“Bailed. Not like yours, huh?” Rumlow turns to him, smiles in a way he probably thinks is charming: Tony hates him on sight. “It’s good to meet you, From Stark. I work with Rogers, for my sins.”
Steve remembers the first time, after DC; Tony had told him, no, this wasn’t going to work. They were never going to be what Steve wanted them to be. He should be happy with the quick, dangerous fucks in supply closets on board the helicarrier, and accept that Tony loved someone else. Still, after insight was done, it was Tony who called him, put that aside.
“Maybe. I spoke to doctors,” he says casually, “they think it might have something to do with your scent, even if it’s just a small factor. Maybe, you smell like Howard. That reminds his hind-brain of home, in some tenuous way.”
Sam’s eyes are big and brown like saucers. He sees them expand, bigger and bigger, chocolate and melting, running down his face. Tony smiles, and nods. Sam smiles back, bigger. He picks apart the toast the Natasha lays in front of him, hands jittery.
“Bad,” Steve says again, snarls it in his ear. “Bad, bad, bad.”
“Sorry, apologies,” Tony pinches the bridge of his nose, “are they red white and blue with an eagle on the ass?”
“No sudden movements, Captain. We wouldn’t want to confuse our soldier, now.”
He bends him over the railing, spanks him once, twice. “I’d put you over my knee if I had a chair,” he says casually, “act like a child, get treated like a child.”
Tony hardens. “Shut up,” he says, flatly. “That’s not – it’s not sexy. Shut up.”
“Yeah, but I
“Why not?”
“Mr Cain. Sure. He wasn’t so old back then, obviously. Why?”
Tony slides his hand past his cock, fingers gently rubbing slick around his rim. “I’m not very – vocal,” he admits.
Pierce cocks his head to the side, looks sad, or maybe – bemused. “Tony,” he says, softly. “You are one of the dumbest smart people I’ve ever met, did you know that? But then again, you are only omega.”
“Tony, I think you’re misunderstanding. Please, look at me.”
He can hear Sarah knocking about downstairs; the sound of coffee brewing, bacon frying. His stomach roils at the thought, but he knows if he wants to stay here he’ll have to eat. Outside the window is green fields, forest, flat enough that he can actually make out the Avengers compound in the distance.
“Sarah,” Tony croaks. “She hasn’t — been recently. Did she say anything to you or…”
the kind of pulling power I have, Tony.”
The kid draws the back of his hand across his eyes. “It’s not fair,” he breathes, “it’s not fair, not for him.”
you what I’m going to do, not asking for permission.”
He ties off the end of the bandage, carefully pats his arm once, twice. “It was awful what that man did. I hear Rogers – what was it. Decapitation, in the end?”
Steve’s throat is thick. He wants to be like Rhodes. He wants to tell Tony’s body that it’ll be okay, he wants to thank it. God – he wants to thank him. He never did.
I feel I should put a word in for your father. He has not got long left. If you're reading this, and he is still alive, then please, take you chance while you still can. Talk to him. Try to understand him. You only have one father, Tony. While I am damaged, and most likely incapable of love, your father does love you. More than anything, I think. And he's broken, too, he doesn't know how to show it. I forget, we all forget, he was a war man. He saw things. And years of building weapons hardens you. Although he's not a sentimental man, I can know he wants the best for you.
Clint closes his eyes in resolute acceptance. “Say your prayers now, boys.”
"I know." Steve says simply. "I know."
The desire to keep what they had, to keep it going, was paramount. At the back of Steve’s mind, there was the knowledge that Tony had done something bad. That he’d built this robot, this AI, and it had nearly destroyed the world.
Nick stands laboriously, snatches the uneaten bowl from under his nose. “I think it’s time you went to bed, don’t you?”
“But how are you feeling,” Steve asks him, after. He’s standing, gingerly pulling off his shirt. Tony winces to see him; his right side is yellow and purple all the way up, swollen and achingly bruised. “Other than the words. I want to take you to a specialist, first thing tomorrow. I know it’s getting better, but – just in case.”
Steve’s hands are on his lapels, pulling off his jacket, popping buttons. He presses kisses against the side of his jaw, throat, and then down to his shoulder, sliding off his crisp $300 shirt just enough to bare the skin, like any more would be an affront,
“I do, actually,” Tony smiles, propping up his chin on his hands, twitching his toes in the air. “How was it? Any questions about your quick exit?”
“It’s not – a conspiracy,” Steve manages, which is the wrong thing to say. It belittles Tony, and he can see it in his face. “I mean – the doctor isn’t purposefully trying to stop you from thinking, you just – you’re having a bad reaction. A bad reaction, or side-effect. But if – no you’re right. You’re right, Tony, tomorrow first thing we’ll drive down to the ward and demand answers, okay? We’ll sort you out, see if you can change your dosage, anything. Anything for you, Tony.”
“It was – weird,” he agrees, slowly. “When you went to DC, like that. I don’t know – I don’t know what I did wrong.”
“No, I don’t want to hear,
“You didn’t hurt me,” Tony says guardedly, even though his arm is still bruised. “You were out of your mind.”
“I’m telling you,” Steve murmurs, mouth by his ear, breath warm, “that your actions reflect badly on us.” His thumb digs into the pulse point on Tony’s wrist. “Do you understand?”
“Tony?” He whispers. “Tony, are you — ”
Where the hell is he? What the hell is this? He stares at the pie on the table. Then to Natasha’s face. Natasha Romanoff made a pie. Natasha Romanoff made a pie? And, and Captain America is sitting at his table. Captain America is sitting opposite him, giving him the eyes, because none of them want to eat a pie Natasha Romanoff, world renowned assassin, has made.
“I wouldn’t change a thing,” Thor announces.
“And me, I guess.”
Steve thinks, they went to college together, didn’t they? Tony and Rhodes. They had known each other longer than anyone here. Pepper’s fingers are tearing at the kid’s armour, her nails digging into his chest, knees tucked beneath her. Jesus, the daughter. She’s going to have to tell Morgan. And what will she say?
"Comforting your hindbrain."
I’ll do what I like, Pierce answers, petting his hair. Would you like a cigarette?
He’s pleased to discover that his new sweater is Steve’s, too – again, he wonders how it got here, if Steve has had supplies holed up in this bunker, wherever it is. The pants are slightly too big, but keep him mostly decent. They don’t have a smell. Generic sweats, fresh from plastic packaging.
He sits and starts tugging off his shoes. The laces are tricky; his hands are still so bad, they barely respond. Steve stares at him with alarm. “What are you doing?” He barks. “Tony – “
“Relax.” Steve says “Breathe.”
“Would you like to try it?” Pierce asks, indulgently. Tony feels like he’s being treated by a kindly old uncle. Like when Obie would bring him presents, before – well. Before all that.
Steve sighs, cups his own tea. “She’s growing soft in her old age.”
Sarah jerks her chin at the oven. “You’ll burn the rice.”
Steve had not seen Tony at all between the fight in Siberia and the psychiatric ward. After Ross was denounced, and the Accords with him, Steve knew there would be a show of investigating Tony, of seeing what side was on, but Fury had assured him that he would never press charges, that it was all formalities. And he was wrong.
“Do you do that often?” Tony asks calmly, taking off his coat. “Do you update Steve?”
Tony closes his eyes, rests his head on Steve's shoulder. "Let's sleep." He murmurs. "Let's just," he sighs "sleep. And we can talk in the morning."
"How's the drop? You feeling steady?"
And that’s it. This is Steve’s home, now. On the main floor, he can see Alexander Pierce and Thor caught in a tussle. “He took it!” Pierce is screaming, “You stupid, fucking – my God, the
he thinks, drowsily. It’s not like Tony
Despite himself, Tony does.
“Steve would be here,” Tony whispers. “He would be here. Anyone would be here, to find me, save me, but they haven’t come yet. Why?”
That hadn’t been what he was responding to. He doesn’t know. He wants out of here, he wants to – to die, maybe. He wants Rhodey, he misses him so much. Why did Rhodey have to fall? Why did he have to fall, that was Tony’s fault. Pepper doesn’t talk to him, no one cares. He’s alone now. Why can’t he die. Why won’t they let him die.
“You didn’t plan on it,” Steve says, quietly, “but you did, anyway. Or at the very least, you did whatever caused those.” There’s no judgement behind his eyes, but they aren’t kind, either.
“No. I mean, I didn’t just do it out of love for you, or for the sake of good human nature. I wanted a change too. I was in a position to give up everything, and so I did. And I don’t regret it. I love what we have here.”
“I know.”
Tony’s shoulders heave, his body shaking with the effort of just
This is fight. Tony is locked in cell with an alpha in fight.
“I don’t understand,” Tony hears himself say, voice slow, even. He rubs at his nose. “What was that?”
We talk when he talks, Steve demands. Take off the gag.
home, he hasn’t left. And that’s how it’s going to stay, until he fixes it. And if he doesn’t?
“Last man standing.”
Tony has to turn his head away. There are tears burning the corners of his eyes. “I don’t want – “ he manages before his throat chokes up. “Can’t talk about this now.”
Steve wraps his arms around Tony shoulders, let’s him rest his head against his chest. Like the old times, like how they would watch TV together, old black and white films. Are they just pretending, now? Like they’re the last people left on earth, and so they’re together by necessity? Or is it just comfort, like pulling on an old sweater. Pepper is gone. Bucky is gone.
he thinks, deliriously.
“Three days ago.”
“I didn’t think he’d be so open.”
Reluctantly, Tony tugs it off, hands it to him, twists on the couch so he’s facing away. The knot is snug, secure – Tony could probably break it, if he thought hard about it. But he’s not really thinking very hard right now.
He twists, looks over his shoulder at the elevator doors sliding open. Steve might have been waiting a long time. He’s anything if not persistent. He raises a hand, as if in greeting, and Tony watches his face for any sign of – disgust. But he probably rehearsed hiding it, earlier. Tony would.
Tony, for his part, keeps up the charade. He’ll make sure his breathing stays slow and measured, and that he keeps his limbs loose. Steve seems to believe it, or at the very least, pretends he does.
“Wait,” someone is laughing, and then hysterically, it’s spreading around all of them. “Get the soldier.”
dick.”
"Okay, Tony."
He reaches out, follows the line of Tony’s cheekbone with his finger. “It’s interesting,” he says, “I guess – I know all of this stuff, but it’s interesting to hear what you think.”
Steve looks up. “Natasha.”
“Did he have a choice?”
So he pulls out the cigarettes, lights up. It sets off the sprinklers, but jokes on them: after the impromptu shower, no one can smell Steve on his skin.
“How so?”
“No. That’s dangerous, right? I want you to tell me what they look like.”
And he gently brushes his hand up Tony’s nape, pins it in his hair. Pins him.
He strokes the soft skin behind his good ear, wraps his arms around his shoulders so he’s held safe and tight, tucked properly into the warmth of his body. “It’s okay,” he tells him, like that means something. “You’re alright, sweetheart.” His lips brush Tony’s brow.
It isn’t fair, or right, of Tony to string him along like this. To tease him with something – a monogamy he might not ever be able to really offer. “It’s not you,” he tells him, helplessly. “I’m not – I’m not made to belong to one person. I’m not bred that way.”
(A lie: they were lovers.)
He wakes up thirsty, desperately. His throat feels too tight, and his dreams were visceral, and he only allows himself a few moments to let the relief of reality tide him through to the now before carefully pulling back the covers, swinging his feet onto the carpet.
Tony stares at him. Pierce’s face is a blur of skin. “What?”
“Sustainable development,” he parrots. “Great. I love that. A worthy cause.”
Steve grunts, accepting. Tony chose his words carefully, appealed to Steve’s hind-brain: thank you, alpha, for protecting the pack. You did the right thing, alpha. Listen to me talk so softly and gently and sweetly to you, alpha, so you know that I respect your choice.
She’s sobbing still, but gently. For Steve, tears don’t come. He thinks, maybe she expected this, maybe she’s always expected it. Always prepared.
“Are you okay?” asked Tony, searching Steve for injury.
“You wouldn’t call in a favor for something as simple as this.”
“Goodnight, Steve.”
“I’ll show you," said Tony.
“Pepper!”
“I can’t imagine how terrifying this must be for you.”
She climbed the bookshelf, reaching for the red and gold book. As soon as pulled it, the shelf slid away, revealing a secret entrance.
“About me?” She pulled up the story on her iPad and handed it to him.
She nodded.
"Sure."
He went to his friends. The rest of the climb was fine with the exception of Fleur’s flirting. They reached the base. Two large metal black doors had been dug out. Blue tents surrounded it. Scientists were running scans over the doors.
There was a boom of thunder. The clouds started to gray.
With all that happened, she hadn't been able to focus on them in a while. That painful longing returned, like hit. She sniffled, trying to force back the tears. Winter didn't like crying.
"I don't know. I didn't think so." She didn't want to linger on how scary that was. Her mind was the one thing she thought she could rely on. She didn’t remember a fight. What she did remember was playing chess with Lena like they always did. Now that was in question. Maybe she’d just blacked out during the struggle.
“Having someone to sleep with helps,” said Steve.
“What do you want for breakfast?”
“Not yet,” he said.
“She’ll deny herself a chance of escape to protect him. Her sense of loyalty is amazing for someone so young. It's hard to come by nowadays."
Steve slowly pulled his head from the pillows. He'd slept through the night. The last time he did that was before Piper was taken. Startled, he felt a wet substance underneath him. Had he wet the bed? He tossed away the blankets, groaning at the realization that he'd slicked himself. He brushed it off as a one-time occurrence.
“Piper!” scolded Steve.
“A little longer. I’ve almost got it,” said Piper.
He glared at Rumlow. The alpha had taken some shrapnel to the leg and was overplaying it to get out of the heavy lifting. They’d spent the night there. Steve went back in to grab another crate. It would take days to catalog, which meant hours of work potentially in front of a computer. He tossed Rumlow a clipboard.
“I don’t need anything big, but I’m getting it anyway,” said Steve.
“Ready to go on?”
“My apologies a did not mean to insult your alpha status, but his stamina is beyond most human. I’m sure with your wide collection of sex toys, he’ll be fine,” said Jarvis.
“What no pinup girls for you?” said Tony.
“Piper, we’ll talk about this later.”
"Wait!"
Steve needed a few minutes to collect himself. He walked to the car. Phil followed behind him. They returned to the training base.
“Then why fix the engine?”
“For what did I miss something?”
“I’m not even trying,” said Tony. He leaned in closer, causing Steve’s blush to deepen. “Does it just come effortlessly?”
“I need a minute."
“Tony.” If it went any further it would lead to sex. Sex outside of heat was different it was clear, lacking the intense animalistic need. In time he would want it. But not now. He wasn't ready.
“He’s Thor’s son?!” said Pepper.
“What? Help an omega through heat, yes. If this works out, you’ll have the best sex of your life. Once it’s over, we’ll be done. And I’m clean,” said Tony.
"And lost five. While Joe Louis only lost three of his sixty-nine fights. He had fifty-two knockouts and held the heavyweight title from 1937 to 1949. Louis still holds that record. I listened to his big fight on the radio.”
“I surrender.”
Piper slowly regained to consciousness. Everything was numb and heavy, her eyelids immovable. Fear was the first reaction. But paralyzation trapped her inside with every hurt, every threat encroaching on her sanity. It was too overwhelming. She wanted to scream but couldn’t. Then she caught a familiar pine mint scent, her only comfort here, Theodore. His heartbeat and breathing were calm. He must be asleep or unconscious.
He stayed with her until she was sound asleep. The wall of the cell sunk into the ground allowing him through when he was ready to leave.
“Why am I not wearing underwear?” asked Tony.
“Off!” growled Steve. He wanted the collar off, so alpha could mark him if he wished.
“No, that will only make things worse.”
“I should get to her.”
“Tony Stark, but I assume you already know that,” he said.
“Are you sure a blunt tool like Rumlow the right tool for the job?” Steve questioned.
She reached a S.H.I.E.L.D airstrip hours later. A jet was waiting for him, autopilot was set to the New York S.H.I.E.L.D facility. During the drive over, she had to update Fury on her progress. She took off her wig, letting lose her red hair. S.H.I.E.L.D satellites were already scanning Antarctica. She called Clint.
“Should we get started? Where’s your laptop?” asked Natasha.
“He’s HYDRA best. She deserves the best.”
His eyes locked on a familiar figure. Alpha! He couldn’t purr or cry for his alpha’s comfort, because of the tube down his throat. But he didn't need to ask the alpha was providing comfort freely. He still wanted it out. Steve reached for it, but his arm was gently pushed down.
“You fucking ape what have you done to project?!” growled Zemo.
“What do you want?”
"Soon enough, all those troublesome emotions will be wiped away. Once you're warmed up, you'll be erased. And hopefully useful." Rumlow smirked at the apparent fear twisting through Winter's expression.
“Let me.” Steve quickly helped his mate, his hands stopping at the shirt’s collar, fingers tracing over the fresh mark he’d left there. He nuzzled against it, tenderly lapping at the wound.
“I don’t care about that. You are good to me.”
February 1, 2016
Tony found Pepper’s photo in the trash while cleaning up. He vaguely remembered throwing it away. Tony left it there. He went into the guest bedroom and found Steve sleeping on the floor. Tony gently nudged him awake. Those blue eyes slowly opened. Steve smiled sleepily.
“Normal and freakish are relative. Compared me, Thor and your Papa, you are normal,” reassured Bruce.
“Only crack this time I think,” said Steve.
Piper set up the pieces on the board, as she'd done many times before. So many times she'd played. Thinking back on it, she couldn't remember the exact moves she made, but she was sure she'd done it before. It felt real. More real than the idea of her being pinned against someone in battle, but facts proved the battle had happened.
“I don’t need your help,” said Piper. She almost regretted saying when she saw the hurt in Papa’s eyes.
“Steve, it’s Rhodes."
“She sounds wonderful,” said Steve.
Steve instantly stopped his feet. Instead, he clenched the armrests. In his head, he kept repeating that Tony was okay. He was probably making something over nothing. Steve bit his lip. He should have never gone.
Steve showered and brushed his teeth. He didn’t feel like putting on real clothes. Tony had given him a second drawer. It was filled with comfy clothes. Steve put on a pair of plaid sleeping pants. He didn’t want to know how much Tony spent on them. Steve slid a sweater over his head. It was so soft against his skin. He walked into the kitchen. While Tony caught up on sleep he would make breakfast. After last night Tony deserved a break.
"You aren't fine, Tony!"
Happy dropped Edith at her apartment. She opened the door. Something was wrong.
“Sleep well. I left you present on the table,” whispered Tony.
Steve groaned at the idea of eating.
Edith nodded. It was a reasonable request. Omegas were protective and skittish of strangers during their labor. It could prove deadly to push their presence on Steve when it was so clearly unwanted. The couple would seek them out them when they were needed. The elevator door closed behind them.
“Almost had me worried.”
Again he was answered by another nod. He slowly ran his fingers through Steve’s hair, never wandering any lower. Steve shivered but started unwinding. The omega’s arms were wrapped firmly around his waist with his head resting on Tony’s lap. Tony got as comfortable as he could. Steve wouldn’t be letting him go any time soon. A screen pulled up in front of him. He worked with his free hand, while his other went through Steve’s hair. Tony searched for reliable information on PTSD. He wanted to be prepared for the next time this happened. Around one in the morning, Steve began to purr. Tony sighed in relief.
“I’ll be out in a minute. You get started on making us something to eat,” said Steve.
"See you soon," she said.
“They won’t want me anymore,” she whispered, hiding her face in her hands.
“Yeah, you want to give it a try?” asked Clint.
“Thirteen seconds,” said Phil.
“Do you got anyone looking for you, Winter?”
Tony turned on the news. He always watched CNN or MSNBC. When Steve asked of other news channels he turned on FOX News to prove its idiocy after five minutes he grew frustrated and told Jarvis to block the channel. It left the alpha in a mood for a good ten minutes. Tony was the most liberal alpha he’d ever met. It was refreshing.
"He's endured worse. I know his limitations. It will be finished before he reaches a point of concern," said Lena.
“I’m studying a very special chinstrap penguin named Theodore.”
“I said let him go!” she demanded. She was holding a syringe to her neck.
He relaxed a little when she left. Winter took the soft stuffed item from the floor. Its texture was foreign to him. It wasn't a weapon or tool. What was its purpose? It smelled wonderful. He'd encountered that scent before.
“He isn’t here,” said Steve.
“I’m glad you shared this with me,” said Steve.
"Where am I supposed to find comfort in that?" asked Steve.
“My people want nothing, but peace with your planet,” said Thor.
“What’s your relationship to him?” asked Steve.
“Daddy and Papa are really dangerous, but only to bad people. We aren’t bad people.”
“It’s all right you were only making sure I was okay,” said Steve.
“Where’s the hamper?”
“How many are in the air?”
Steve rubbed his temples. That was the last thing he wanted to deal with. “I don’t want to talk to them.” He couldn’t put up that public façade. Not now.
“What kind of bike is this?” asked Steve.
“Next time wake me up,” he said.
Tony got some blankets and pillows from the bedroom, creating a makeshift bed. Steve was quick to settle into.
“If you don’t wake up by the count of three the tickle monster will come.”
“I want to know. Why is it that you can go and I can’t? I because I’m omega?”
“Steve, I don’t want you to stop needing me.”
She was faster. Every time he got close, she'd shoot ahead. He was forced into this game of tag. Rune smiled, actually finding it fun. He slowed, fun wasn't the purpose of this fight. If he didn't beat her, he'd be punished. He had to catch her! No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't.
"Okay," he said.
“My apologies but I’ve been programmed not to allow anyone up at the moment,” said Jarvis.
“No, too much energy,”
Pierce smiled. “I don’t know why I doubted you, Dr. Zemo.” Piper was pure power in its most ruthless form. It only needed time to be harnessed.
“Thank you, thank you, Winter!”
“Uh, say Jarvis is it that time?” asked Tony.
“And you need to focus on the problem,” said Steve.
"I don't want to hear it," said Steve, getting up.
“Steve.” A small, fearful whine touched his ears. Steve was tucked under a worktable, shaking. His face was hidden. How had Steve managed to squeeze himself into the small gap? “Steve,” he whispered.
“Phil hasn’t set up your bank account yet. You must have a chunk of change saved up by now. Next time you’ll be treating me,” said Clint.
“Steve, are you alright?” asked Tony.
“Are they safe?” asked Steve.
Steve rolled his eyes, allowing the alpha to leave. He waited for the elevator doors to close, before going to Jarvis.
“Yeah, me too,” said Bruce.
“I have a husband that already does that consistently,” said Tony.
“I'd put them on the same level," said Phil.
“Is she upset?” asked Steve.
“Anything you want to watch?” asked Tony.
“Why didn’t you call me sooner?”
Tony went through a thoroughly detailed plan of how the gauntlets worked. Steve was out after ten minutes. Tony purred deeply. Hopefully, it would help Steve sleep through the rest of his early labor. Steve was asleep against his chest. He tried reaching for his tools. The motion was impossible without waking his mate.
"When will he land?" asked Steve.
“You’re zip-tied to a bed,” he said.
“I know the baser part of your mind that you try desperately to deny agrees. You’ll eventually come to accept what your inner alpha has to say. You should listen to it more often,” she said.
“I didn’t want to unload that on you.”
“You’re the second. I rather not drawl upon my first experience."
“What do you remember?”
“With those pretty locks of yours out the way, you should be able to see better,” said Sir, running his finger through what remained of her hair.
“Will they erase you again?”
"Can't make it worse."
Steve nodded guilt still heavy in his expression. He took a shaky breath. Tony gave his hand a comforting squeeze.
"Dada?" She reached up, wiping the tears from his cheeks.
"No problem, kid. Where's your parent?" asked Tony, searching for a guardian.
“I didn’t mean to wake you. “
“I need –” Tony’s voice, though calm now, was filled with months-long strain of having to be the strong one.
*****

“We made her how could she not be?”
“I’m sorry, sweetheart.”
“Once things calm down, can we move to Malibu?"
“You’re not fine! Look at you!”
“I’m not asking you too. I don’t how we get her back as long as we get her back.”
"You aren't." The stench of Steve’s distress killed his arousal. Protection overrode his urge to mate.
"I'm heading there now. It would help if I knew the other party's full name," she said.
“I can’t remember the last time I had one of these,” said Tony.
The nurse’s eyes widened.
“I know,” said Steve.
“Jarvis will put the direction through the helmet,” said Tony.
“Mmm, I love the authoritative tone, Captain,” said Tony before dunking his head under the water.
“S.H.I.E.L.D. has a leak,” said Tony.
The alpha held his limp arm. She approached his corner, slowing as he glared at her. Piper made herself as unintimidating as possible.
Steve settled in bed with Piper. He turned on the TV to fill the quiet. The impatience in Tony's posture was clear, but he would not ruin this important time with Piper. After several minutes Tony surrender to a project. Piper was ready for a nap. He set her down in the playpen.
Their short vacation went wonderfully. They were on their flight home. It was filled with great food and amazing sex. Steve hadn’t been able to build up the courage to ask Tony about their future. There was one it was just the fact of figuring out what it entailed. He could face enemy troop and giant radioactive bears, but this was so much more difficult.
Tony nearly dropped the phone.
She scowled. It wasn’t the answer she was hoping for.
“Tony?"
“What’s on your mind?”
“Piper, I’m so sorry. Are you-”
“This isn’t a consultation,” said Phil.
"Steve has the ability to produce full-fledged super soldiers naturally. Theoretically, the child’s DNA would allow it to adapt and absorb the super-soldier serum to become stronger if reintroduced to it," she said.
"That includes the pheromones I release," said Steve.
“You’re not a target. I don’t miss my targets.” Winter explained.
“I liked fighting you. Fighting is the only thing we get a choice. Learn to like it. It's the only thing we have any choice in.”
“Too many to keep track of,” said Tony.
“That’s not a good enough reason.”
“Bad different or good different?”
“What are you smiling at?” asked Tony.
“I love you.”
“One last question, doctor. Can you help her?”
“Still, good news."
“I have to,” said Steve.
“I need a few more hours. There are bottles in the fridge if she gets hungry."
"It will be alright," whispered Tony reassuringly.
“Yes,” he said.
An arm wrapped around his neck locking his head in place. His mask was yanked off. He flipped their position, the alien taking the hit from its ally. The other scrambled on the floor for the bomb. Steve jumped tucking himself behind his shield. He launched from the window, landing on a car. His pup was safe he’d land on his back. He was slow to get up.
The question left him speechless. It had never been an issue for him. He felt guilty for her losing the opportunity to be with Steve. When he was young, she always spoke so dreamily of Steve. He was developing feelings for a man he once despised as a child.
Now that her panic had cleared, she smelled Play-Doh, not the chemical smell that would have come with a substance like C4.
"Sorry, Nat I lost track of time."
“Sleep.”
“Do you want to sleep in Piper’s room?” asked Pepper.
Maria took Rune out of the car. “Where should we put them?”
“Well, performance issues are not uncommon one out of five-
Tony scowled, but it was a step forward. He was willing to comply with a reasonable request.
The phone kept ringing now through Jarvis.
“We will be here a few days,” she said.
“Didn’t think I'd meet the merit," said Steve.
“How?” asked Clint.
“It’s fine, sweetheart. Call me when you want me to pick you up,” he said.
“I love you too. Kiss Carl for me you when get home.”
“We’ll drop you off at the nearest S.H.I.E.L.D. agency. There are other things that need to be handled,” said Phil.
"It will tell me if the seal has been tampered with after drawing, and the case has a location lock to Stark Tower. The labs there will have all you need. Where you can work under Jarvis's supervision," said Tony.
“I’ll save that image for later. How do you feel about French food?” he asked.
"You'll have some of your own soon enough," said Tony.
"10,000 feet."
He cupped Tony’s face in his hands. “I’m fine, and so is the baby. We’ve survived an alien invasion. We can survive this,” said Steve.
A young alpha pup huddled in the corner of his cell, awaiting the appearance of his handler. His brilliant blue eyes kept flicking toward the door.
“You might as well have. Do you think I like having to be strong? Having to force myself to stay together for you. It's the most draining thing I’ve ever done in my life and I’m sick of it!”
Steve and Natasha nodded in agreement. Dreamy fit the man perfectly. He’s the type of alpha an omega fantasized about.
Tony didn't pry further, just glad that Steve was eating again. He sat next to him rubbing his back. When Steve was done, he pushed the tray away.
“No, it’s pretty basic,” said Tony.
"You okay?"
Tony raised a brow; he was sure Steve would have sent her back to bed.
“I was going to talk to Uncle Bruce,” said Piper.
*****
“So this is why Jarvis locked me out.”
“And the pup?”
"What kind of cake is it?" asked Oliva.
"My Aunt May was getting cereal but then I saw you," he said.
“And place a rush order for a limited edition Dora the Explorer watch.”
He trudged into the elevator, stepping out on the research floor. The lab space was littered with half-finished projects, tools strewn underfoot. Tony was asleep at his desk. Sleep did nothing to ease the stress in his expression.
“Sì.”
Piper wasn't sure how long she stayed there, but, after a while, she heard someone crawling toward her from the left. She was relieved when she caught Rune’s scent.
"He lived a good life. That's nothing to be sad about," said Steve.
"You lost eyes, captain."
“When the time is right,” said Phil.
"What's the score?"
“Bucky, no it’s an empty grave. He isn’t there. What’s the point?”
“Night Steve."
He kneeled beside Piper. "Your DNA isn't what makes you -
"No." Even if he did, she'd just make another. He put the figure back into the castle. "So, is Elsa his girlfriend?"
“Engine three, I’ll meet you there.”
Tony groaned, yanking blankets over his head.
“Sir? Do you want me to fetch Steve?”
“You’re stressed. What aren't you telling me?" The idea of his omega stressed and scared without him there, drew out his most protective alpha instincts.
“Sorry,” he repeated.
“What were you thinking of doing?” asked Tony.
“Steve, you have to wake up!”
“Umm sure,” he said. Steve quickly fixed the issue.
"You've got it bad." Laughing when he looked down apparently more interested in floors. “Steve, your inner omega is what you can trust most. It only seeks to do what’s best for you. Let it do that. Mine has never lead me astray. There’s a reason your instincts lead you to Tony."
Steve settled for breakfast while Tony made his business call. He hoped he'd be able to spend this upcoming heat clear-headed. He wanted to be truly present when it happened. Tony came back several minutes later. His expression told him it hadn’t gone well.
“Tony!”
“I’m guessing, Thor wasn’t careful in cleaning up after himself,” said Tony.
Tony knew what his omega wished of him. He wanted to give it to him, but he wanted that choice to be made when they weren’t like this. Tony sucked a mark onto the juncture of Steve’s neck and shoulder. His omega shuddered at the sensation, but he was unsatisfied. He managed to soothe and soon lulled the two of them into sleep. A week passed in the animalistic passion.
“I don’t know.”
“I probably have an assignment," he said.
“She showed me that video,” said Piper with a shiver.
"Sure." The background noise would be nice.
Piper spotted Rune starting at Barny. She shook her head, signaling that it was alright. Papa came out to greet Barny.
*****
“He’ll be placed on the gifted database and given to S.H.I.E.L.D. That’s no place for a child.”
"It's hardly noticeable," said Nat.
“Hey, are you nuts,” said Steve.
“Thank God! I’ll be right over,” said Pepper.
*****
"Thank you."
“Like Percy Jackson,” said Piper.
She took a spoonful of the oatmeal. It shook in her hand. Then it dropped from her grip. She pushed the tray away.
“Is she asleep?” asked Bruce.
“Why haven’t you gotten him to move?” asked Tony.
“Then what’s the problem?” asked Lena.
“I’ll ask Barny for some recommendations,” said Steve.
“He needs time to snap out it,” said Pepper.
“I’ll be there in a week.”
"Come on, Nat. They'll be fine now."
"Less than three months to plan a wedding," said Steve.
Piper followed not wanting risk punishment. Rune was already in the small classroom when she arrived. He looked tired and was twitchy. Something happened. The beta took a seat at Lena’s desk, setting a timer. It was the closest thing she'd seen to a clock since arriving there. Piper tore a page from the easel and laid it on the floor. Rune did the same. She began drawing. Rune picked up a crayon and began to scribble. Rune’s state had to due to the visitors. That beta that was supposed the be watching them was hardly paying them any mind.
“You’re the fossil,” she said.
"He was caught in an explosion."
"And what a great way to start so far," said Tony.
“You think so?” said Tony.
“I would have to do further testing, but I would say there's a five to ten percent chance of rejection of an alpha’s claim mark,” said Edith.
“White or red,” he said.
Clint nodded.
He nodded.
“You’ll want to hear this,” pressed Natasha.
"I know you won't hurt me. So, it won't happen again," said Piper. She tried leaving, but Bruce was still holding her. "Uncle Bruce, you've gotta let me go. I'm okay now, I promise."
"You were there every time I woke up, keeping me calm."
“Yeah, I want to play with Rune.”
“What we call ourselves. Sorta, like a team. Earth’s mightiest heroes. You’ve met them,” said Tony.
“It’s a big bunny relax about it!” said Tony.
Mark 5 seemed to be opinion box for Piper. They unfolded the notes together, finally reaching the last note.
“I’ve seen worlds you’ve never known about. I have grown, Odin’s son, in my exile. I have seen the true power of the Tesseract and when I wield it-
“It’s okay.”
“Did Captain America just roll his eyes at me?” said Natasha.
The drive to the hotel was uncomfortably silent. Steve’s gaze was focused out the window. They pulled into the hotel. Tony tossed his keys to a valet. He couldn't take much more of this silent tension, but he had to wait till they got to the privacy of their room to address it.
“Can you sew?”
She ignored him, turning her back to him, and traced the painted patterns. “What did you do while I was gone?”
"You built me a nest?"
Tony’s arm wrapped around Steve’s waist. Steve purred into their kiss and relaxed. Finally, he could drop his guard. Today was the day. It was a massive weight off his shoulders.
Mrs. Davis's location was a bar called Walker's. The kid followed him. "No, you stay here."
"Thanks for the shower I feel a bit better," said Steve.
“What about the window?” he asked.
“Yes”
“Every time I put it in I taste metal and coconut,” he said.
"I don't mind. It would be best if you were where you're most comfortable. I should get going. I'm sure two have packing to do," said Edith.
“I just sent them to your email, Mrs. Potts,” said Jarvis.
“How is unconscious fine?!” snarled Steve.
“I don’t like him,” said Rune. The alpha was deadly. He wasn’t like Piper’s dad that was dangerous but kind. Someone he was sure wouldn't turn against them. "What's he the director of?"
“Why is that?” asked Fury.
“Press your tongue to the top of your mouth.”
“Name?”
Edith smiled. One small change to a pattern cause that much of a reaction. She pulled up the information from Stanly, sensors in the fabric having survived Piper's safety check. There was a spike in her adrenaline and norepinephrine. She needed to do a physical on Piper. For the time being, she would allow Piper to believe it was her choice.
“How long does the last?” he asked.
"Nothing."
The two went to sleep. When he woke up Natasha was cuddled against his chest. Steve thought nothing of it. She was only seeking warmth in her sleep. Steve carefully moved away from her.
“Thanks, Fabio,” said Tony.
Tony grabbed his hand. Steve sat back down on the side of their bed, taking the alpha's head into his lap. He ran his fingers through Tony's thick hair. Soon the alpha was asleep. He carefully moved Tony's head from his lap and snuck out of the room, grabbing his gym bag before he left.
“It’s time to go,” she said.
“Do Clint and Natasha know?” asked Steve.
“Is it?”
“Steve!”
A set hand led them to makeup. Steve twitched, not used to the sensation of getting his makeup done. He hated it. Steve refused to wear it. They were led to a waiting room.
“Sleeping!” hissed Tony. He closed his eyes, focusing on the wonderful honey vanilla scent.
“I’ll watch them,” said Maria.
She was pretty! Wasn’t she? It was something she’d never really thought about before. Does how she look truly matter?
As soon as Tony entered the room he caught him a hug. Tony turned and pressed a kiss on Steve’s soft pink lips.
She still remained cold. The distress leaking off her was driving his instinct. She was terrified.
"He's stable."
"Her request seemed reasonable given the circumstances," said Jarvis.
Tony forced back his feral mind frame. He wanted to enjoy this. Tony licked the wet dripping slit, causing the omega whimper. Before Steve could whine Tony mounted the beautiful being. He slid in with one thrust he sunk into that wonderful tight heat. Steve cried out in pleasure. Instinct drove him into a brutal pace. It was too powerful to fight he need to clearly mark the omega as his.
The alpha relaxed slightly. Edith didn't let her guard down. Stark was one of the most dangerous alphas she'd encountered. He wasn't only powerful but intelligent. She could counter strength, but what he could do when he set his mind to it worried her. Not only could he destroy a person physically, but in every other way, he had the smarts and funds to do. And this alpha saw her as a threat to his family. Gaining his trust would be impossible.
Their fingers entwined.
"I can stay awake a bit longer." He didn't want to say goodbye to his love.
“Drop it,” warned Steve. He didn't think he could describe it even if he wanted to.
“Tony, I don’t want to jump to conclusions about what this is. If this is only about my heat, it’s fine." It would be painful, but fine. Tony expected something with no strings attached. At first, that was what he wanted as well. But that changed as he got to know Tony. The sex was amazing, and he was sure the alpha ruined all others for him. "I’d rather know now, that’s all. This is all new for me. I want to know what to expect,” said Steve. He readied himself for the answer.
“Sure,” he said.
“It’s serious, but Dr. Star is a skilled physician. She expected this may happen and made sure plenty of his blood type stocked,” said Christina.
There no doubt in the alpha's mind that Steve would do it again to prove a point to him.
“I think I broke my hand.”
"I'm sure we'll be seeing more of each other. There are still eight months left in Steve's pregnancy," said Edith.
“How do you comb your hair?” he asked.
"You okay?"
Steve was slow to get to his feet, still shaky from orgasm.
She had him there.
“His big brain and she likes it. Here, I’ll show you.” Happy raised his iPad. “See?”
“I don’t have another option,” said George.
"Sir."
February 9, 2016
He nodded.
Natasha had arrived a week ago in Sokovia. She wanted some time to study the Zemo family dynamics. Even if their connection to Piper’s disappearance was as slim as it seemed, it was the only lead they had currently. Unless Tony’s research on Winter’s arm came back with anything. She rented an apartment that granted her a view of their property. From what she’d seen so far, they were a relatively normal family, with the exception of Helmut Zemo. He was the current commander of EKO Scorpion, Sokovia’s paramilitary death squad.
The light extinguished from her and she went limp in his arms. Winter lost consciousness seconds later.
Steve carded his fingers through the alpha's hair, singing to him. It took Steve a few seconds to realize he was singing their wedding song. He sat them up, holding Tony closely to his chest, so Tony could hear his heartbeat. The slowly alpha came out of it.
"I'm not going to give up the chance to confront someone who took someone from me again."
She snarled. Winter raised his head at the sound, carefully observing the two. The beta was harmless as long as they were within the cell.
“Why?”
“He saw it as a way to be reunited with his family,” said Tony, sadly
She seemed okay enough. The pup tiredly rubbed her eyes. He picked her up and plopped her on the bed.
Tony laughed softly. “Sweetheart, I ask myself that every day I wake up with you next to me."
“You won’t have to watch her much longer, Nat.”
“Neither did I.”
Dark, greasy hair hid his eyes so Piper’s eyes slid to the man’s arm metal. The engineer in her couldn’t help being curious. A union of metal and flesh was unnatural. He was forced to accept it. Deep claw marks mauled the flesh around his shoulder joint. The alpha tucked his arm away from Piper’s lingering gaze.
“What’s this?” he asked, wiping away his tears.
"I don't think we should mention what happened to you. We don't want to overwhelm her," said Tony. He could barely tolerate talking about it himself.
“Pretty, pretty, please with a cherry on top,” begged Piper.
“I don’t want to think about that,” she said. She shook her head, trying to shake out the bad thoughts Winter put there. There were other things she had to focus on, like how they were going to get out.
“I may be a little late. I’m just leaving now,” said Steve.
Steve cleaned his paintbrushes then went to fetch his alpha. Tony was so absorbed in his work he didn’t notice him. He took a seat on the lumpy couch. Watching his alpha work was calming. His eyes closed in a deep sleep.
"No, I have it handled," he said.
“You're welcome to stay another night,” said Tony, nuzzling the omega’s neck.
“I’ll consider it.”
“It’s ready,” said Steve.
“It could get better,” said Piper.
“Alright,” said Tony. He followed Rhodey to the elevator. The doors closed.
“Hmm.”
“Who gives this omega away?”
"We'll have to wait till nightfall to make a move. So we have some time to burn," said Natasha.
“Boiled cabbage but I grew to like it when I got older.”
“I’m willing to wait,” said Pierce. The girl would help tow Hydra’s goal, help bring upon a new era and keep them in power.
"And how does she know you?"
Tony felt like banging his head against the table. He didn’t want to talk about this. Feelings like these were meant to be kept to himself. Talking about them was too exposing.
"I mean socially," said Steve.
“I would say it matters,”
“I promised I’d tell you when the time was right." He took a shaky breath. “I’m pregnant."
The deal was too good to be true. “Swear on it.”
There were so many exhibits.“Can we look around?” asked Steve.
"I liked it better when you couldn't talk," said Steve pulling a pillow over his head.
“And your pups?” he asked lifting the photo from the table.
“Cause you love him?” said Bethany.
“Love you,” whispered Steve.
“Nothing, which was odd he always willing to share his conquests. Sometimes overly so,” said Rhodes.
“May I come in?” asked Pepper.
“How many shoes do you have?”
The kid stopped but it was too late. He got up not wanting to be anywhere near Harley if this went bad.
“An idiot trainee,” he said.
“Got caught in a lesson,” she said.
"You can be angry, sweetie, but you can't let it take over." The blue glow fade from her eyes. She took a breath, closing her eyes. "Better?"
"How much more can he take? Winter is a valuable asset. We can't afford to lose him for a child barely out of diapers."
“What would I gain from you?” she asked.
"Just trust me, get down here."
Steve’s coat and shoes were still here. He was running around New York barefoot in winter. The idea tugged painfully at him. His omega hated the cold.
“Tell me exactly what happened,” she demanded.
She looked up from her laptop when she heard a door slam. Helmut stormed into the backyard cursing.
“Do you have to go somewhere you have to go?” asked Barny.
