“What the hell are you doing Stevie?” Bucky asked as soon as they heard the faint sound of running water coming from the bedroom.
"Why would I want to deny it?" Ian asked, confused, and Rita and her friend traded a glance before bursting into giggles.
Received date September 23
Despite himself he could feel his smile twitching at the corners of his mouth.
“Are we going to build boats?!” He demanded eagerly. Tony nodded, daintily sipping his soup to hide the smile tugging at his lips and the boy whooped. Natacha frowned and scolded him to control himself but James largely ignored her, beginning to inhale his lunch as if he could not eat it fast enough.
Stefen had finally managed to have that talk with Bucky and to collect the final names for their list. List in hand they’d met that morning in the small flat above Mittlestaedt Press, where Franz Mittlestaedt had lived and worked for the past twenty years.
“You heard him,” Hammer was crowing in the background. “The Czechs will clear out quick if they know what’s good for them and if they try anything our boys will show them what’s what.”
They would have to be on the move soon after that, and Tony was determined to outfit them with the tools and skills they’d need for the journey. The children talked tentatively at first of how proud their father would be of all their new skills, as if the hope of his return was still thin ice beneath their feet, but with more confidence as the days ticked by.
“What’s wrong?” Péter asked after the silence dragged on. “Has...has something, happened? Is everyone alright?”
“Another family moved on this morning and three beds have opened up. You can stay the night but not beyond that. Many suffering families depend on this synagogue for charity, but if the authorities discover they are giving refuge to foreigners they will shut it down.”
“Be very careful, Stark!” Steve growled at him, teeth clenched so tight they were all but bared and Tony shivered, but refused to back down.
Next was Ian.
“Péter. Look at me” he waited till he had Péter's full attention again. “This is an opportunity you will never have again. Your friends will understand.”
“I shall keep my men on their guard,” he finally allowed and Neuman smiled down at him with stiff satisfaction. It angered the lieutenant. Made him want to strike the other man. It would have been tantamount to suicide, but it would have felt clean.
They all watched as Steve took a breath. The hand that he had sat on the table was clenched in a white knuckled grip.
Devastating life interruptions aside, the children had a leg up in their studies.  Surely, the professors who taught their maths and sciences would have noted the brightness of Tony’s young pupils, but it was unsure whether they would have the time or the resources to focus on the specific needs of any one student. That was the situation all of the educators were facing.
Tony beamed at her.
“Been awhile, since I wasn’t rushing to get somewhere is all.”
He wanted to listen but it was too painful to swallow. Weakly Steve lifted an arm to push Bucky away, but it felt like pushing at a ton of bricks. This must be one of the really bad spells. He couldn't remember being this sick in a very long time. Ma must be so worried. She was the best healer in the caravan. She wouldn’t leave him with Catalina if she could help it. She wouldn’t trust the jealous woman not to curse him. He thought he could hear Catalina’s familiar laughter, a wet cackle emitting from her heavy chest.
What was more, Tony believed in his own cleverness. Between Stefen’s good and Tony’s shrewder nature he was sure they would be able to rescue Stefen’s friends from Dachau and get the family to safety in Switzerland before things got too much hotter here. And Tony did mean all of them.
) here is a visual aide.
“Yes. Herr Stark has been very diligent.”
“My apologies General, but surely a change in timing can only help us throw off rebel intervention.”
“Yes… but they said I’ll have to send my rolls back to the manufacturer to get them developed. It could be months before I got it back.” Péter revealed, his hands tightening protectively around the camera. He never went anywhere without it Tony had noticed. He didn’t know if it was because it had belonged to his mother or because it had been a gift from his father. Maybe both.
The baroness held a hand to her mouth, delicately trying to mask the smell, and addressed the young woman, a Julia, instructing her to finish up and the doctor would see to Rogers.
Rogers continued to write.
“On paper.” Stefan replied dryly, missing the flicker of hurt that crossed Péter's face.
Tony leaned back, studying him with an open intensity that made feel both exposed and rooted to the spot.
In the army, a team only worked if everyone worked together and pulled their own weight; but Tony wasn’t ready to let them take risks even if those risks were in the best interest of their entire unit.
but kept that to himself.
The police had answered the call to crack down on crime by arresting more and more of the cities displaced and desperate, whenever the whim took them.  The Italian government had always thought poorly of the Slavic nationals who had called these shores home through the changing of borders, and the prejudiced treatment dished out to ‘
Péter was thrilled to be leaving, but nervous as well, and those nerves were often echoed in his siblings. They’d never been separated for any great stretch of time, and now Péter would be gone for months on end. James had thrown a fit at the news. A full production of tears and tantrum that Tony thought even Stefen had seen through. It wasn’t just that the boy was jealous his older brother got to have an adventure and was leaving the others behind. It was the leaving altogether that James was just not prepared to handle. Even Natacha had seemed shaken by the news. She’d never carry on like James but she was quieter than usual, and eating less.
Steve smiled at him, awash with relief and mouthed a thank you as he carried Artur into the bedroom.
“Rogue is stationed at the weapons factory and has been of great assistance to me. I trust her with my life. She’ll be your eyes and ears and assist you with getting in and out of the barracks.” Vis explained. The girl nodded in agreement adding quietly, “at half day on Saturday, workers start their leave time. Many of them go to church or go home to see their families.  There’s a trolley that picks us up and drops us off at the factory in the city. “
“You say your network plans to sabotage their efforts. What do you need from us?”
"… entirely not the point." He finished lamely and Natacha, finishing brushing out the snarls in her sister's hair, quickly set about braiding it, her nimble fingers practically flying as she answered him.
“Yes, then why don't you keep it a secret and let us eat.”
“You weren’t happy when she taught me to dance. You weren’t happy when she tried to tell us stories. I thought you were ashamed of her, like the Osbornes, but that wasn’t it. It was because she was different.”
“It’s alright I’d like to meet – ” Dr. Fischer began but was interrupted by Baroness Schrader descending the stairs at a rapid pace, her face pale and strained.
He cupped a hand to his ear, leaning forward and asked her to repeat it (too many years of getting boxed around his ears) and she giggled, ducking her head as she repeated herself. Not that it was much louder, Tony was still at a loss.
“Been colder Sir.”
Didn’t Tony know it. He suddenly felt beyond exhausted, on the verge of tears that would only humiliate himself and worry the children. Heaving a sigh Tony straightened, releasing the coiled rope in his hands and turned to look at them all.
And since the boy insisted on shepherding him to the Abbot’s office by pelting him with small stones, Tony considered it a show of his own maturity that he only just barely decided against the former.
“Very.” Tony answered tightly. Vonkov had taken up teaching as a young man as a means of supporting himself. He’d been snobbish and judgmental, Tony remembered, and not at all thrilled with having Tony as a pupil. He’d not left his position on good terms, but it was more than Tony wanted to explain.
“Just promise me you’ll keep me in the loop this time. If you accept that I have to know where you are and how to help you Stefen, then I can accept that you have to try to save them all.” Tony murmured hoarsely, his throat constricted by a swell of emotions he had no hope of expressing. He licked dry feeling lips and pressed them against the arm Stefen had wrapped around him, where it was closest to his mouth. “It’s because you still believe in the good in people.”
Schmidt reached for his plate again and took a bite. Again came the soft wet sounds of mastication, teeth ripping thin layers of bread, pummeling them, then the obscene sound of Schmidt swallowing almost thunderous in the silence.
"Shit!" Bucky exclaimed, he and Harold jumping back at the same time to avoid the splash.
Though Tony combated him often, Tony could admit privately that he did not hate this part of Stefen. That unwavering commitment to duty and justice was as much a part of Stefen’s soul as it was his training. And Tony could never truly hate anything that kept Stefen alive. Time was all they needed, and pride was not too high a cost to pay. What was pride to either of them now? Tony could make his voice small and gentle; he could sit at Stefen’s feet with hands folded and telegraph the faithful obedience of a postulant if that would speak to the soul of the man.
A/N 1: I want to just put a general warning here that Steve is a depressed kitten. He is suffering from a combination of severe depression and PTSD, and his thinking as a result is not always clear or healthy. There is an element of Dub/Con that comes into play here - through no fault of Tony's own - but nonetheless, Steve starts doing things because he feels he needs to do them, because he wants Tony and is afraid he'll leave if he doesn't make him feel loved. This is obviously messed up, and is something that they will adress when Tony becomes wise to it.
“You think the Führer should just allow us to be bullied?”
“Most of leopoldstadt is gone. Deported,” he murmured, unsure why he said it.
“Da?” Ian’s voice was fragile as he held on tightly to the hands holding his face.
"What?" Steve asked indignantly.
He ducked his head towered Anamarie as if they were intimately whispering to one another. She was trembling against him but there was strangely no fear in her eyes. Their green was lost to silver in the moonlight but not their quiet confidence, and Péter had the really weird thought that if he was going to be arrested he was glad it was like this with her.
“Nothing’s happened.” Steve assured him, but Ian did not look as if he was relieved. “You know I won’t let anything happen to you, don’t you?”
Steve’s eyes flickered warily around the table before meeting his, face stupidly confused. The god damn prick!
Tony bit his tongue, caging the hysterical laugh that bubbled up behind his teeth.
Harold was saying something about how the bulk of the riots had not bothered to come out this far, but a few synagogues had been burned. A truck full of men had come by, looking for Jews but there were not many this far out in the country. Steve kept watch because he knew better than to relax. Refused to even. He had too much to protect.
“Here you go Tony. Lucky you came when you did. We’re near out.” She said. Tony nodded distractedly, more interested in downing Stefen’s best beer than holding conversation.
Speaking of barely contained aggression, the Captain turned on his heel and held open the door, eyes boring into Tony with silent command. Tony resisted the urge to scuttle from the room like a cockroach and cocked his head ever so slightly. Despite the air of tightly coiled fury emanating from the captain it was broad daylight. He was not going to die. No, not here. And even if he was, he refused to die toe heeling to anyone least of all this man, this
She put one mittened finger to her lips and made a small shushing sound. Artur and Maria immediately fell quiet and Tony’s heart began to pound. Natacha jerked her head back in the direction of the cabin and Tony immediately followed the wordless instruction, reaching for Artur and Maria’s hands and holding tightly before following Natacha’s lead back through the wood.
“Are you so eager for a return to war that you’ve forgotten what the last one was like?” He snapped, drawing the wary eyes of the women. “Or that the Captain is one of those men whose lives you’re so willing to throw at all your imagined enemies?”
She waved a little pink canister labeled ‘
"It would be much easier if you allowed one of us to carry you Bambina," he tried again when she tipped over for the fourth time, landing fast first in the snow. He reached for her, but she was already getting back onto her feet with a wobble, her cheeks bright red and snow clinging to the wet curls peeking out from under her cap.
“What is it? What have you heard?” Stefen, now jacketed to Tony’s satisfaction, barked impatiently at Grig.
“Weapons, transports for men and information when we need them.” Bucky immediately answered. “Our contacts in London are doing what they can but the English government wants to avoid war at all costs.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“That's all settled then, after your other lessons tomorrow we'll start on your electives.”
“No more yelling.” Sara cried, burying her cold nose against his neck and Tony heartily agreed.
Steve lay in the dark, his focus drifting in and out.
The children, having already gobbled down their meal and grown bored with the adult conversation had been told to go “play, but they were mostly just wandering about the paved paths whispering amongst themselves. Natacha and Péter had elected to stay behind, perhaps to feel more adult, but Tony could tell Péter was regretting the choice as his eyes glazed with boredom.
She’d asked Natacha to look out for him and she would!
“Let’s do away with the formality shall we? I’m sure you’re all curious as to why I asked you here and I won’t keep you in suspense. I thought we’d focus on a special lesson this afternoon and it’s lengthy so let us get started. Please take your seats.”
But I don't see you with me, with me
Christ. Just thinking it left him breathless, the fear clawing at his throat and the adrenaline spiking through his veins. It was a suicide mission. If this went tits up (oh and there were a hundred different ways) they’d be better off dead than being taken in by the police.
“I'll do my own examination of course, but I've only to look at him to know the man is too ill to waste time.” Fischer responded rigidly.  “Now if you’ll all be so kind as to leave me with my patient.”
“To do this.” Steve took Tony by the hand and held him by the waist, ignoring the confused tension in his body, and his own certainty that he was about to make a fool of himself. It didn’t matter if Tony was happy. “I only know how to lead.” He snapped it. Steve flinched. He hadn’t meant to snap it. He’d meant to apologize...
“Her birthday is not till April. Who is that girl with her?” Rather than argue the point about a handful of weeks, Tony’s gaze followed the direction of Stefen’s nod and found Natacha standing by the fountain, her head bent in close conversation with another girl, whom Tony recognized instantly by her familiar purple coat and haphazard bow. Caterina clutched Natacha’s hand tightly. They whispered for a moment more before setting off arm in arm.
Tony blinked at the five-year-old girl, remembering the book she’d been sounding her way through during his lesson. She’d actually been trying to read it. She clearly comprehended enough to know what French was at least. Clever girl.
“I think I’ll take this one where he’s not in danger of drowning himself.”
“I thought I made it clear that bedtime was to be strictly observed.”
"Sorry," the young man apologized before turning away and moving forward.
Tony had a hand rubbing at his throat, soothing, helping him swallow. Steve fought to keep his eyes open – he had to see, had to know if it was real - but his eyelids might as well have been weighed down with stones. He closed his eyes and let the darkness take him once more.
Tony considered him. His stare was so potent it made the hairs on Steve's arm stand on end.
Stefen’s grip tightened around the phone. He kept his breathing even despite the cold sweat that broke out on his skin.
“You’re welcome Tony.” She replied solemnly, holding his gaze for a moment before letting it slip away replaced by a eerily Pepperish glare as she admonished him under her breath. “Don’t drink so much. It tells them how scared you are, and Father hates it.”
Prazak’s lower body had nearly been fused to the cannon tank, his legs unrecognizable.
“I’m afraid so.” Tony replied with a wan smile but the soldier did not return it. If anything, the confirmation just made his back go all the straighter and his tone all the more militant as he gave Tony the customary salute.
Steve’s marks were below his rack, hard to reach and out of sight to him but also to the guards.
“Get up!” Bucky kept urging him, his hands hot against Steve’s back, pulling insistently at the back of his shirt. He must not see the boot Schmidt had against his back, or the bruises purpling Steve’s skin from where that boot had come down over and over until he’d felt his ribs crack.
Stefen held her stiffly but Maria didn’t seem to care, after only a moments hesitance she wrapped her arms tightly around his neck and did indeed seem content to lay her head against his shoulder, silent tears trickling down her cheeks only interrupted by the occasional sniffle.
The news castor was reading studiously over silent footage of The Führer walking side by side with Mussolini, Chamberlin and the French Prime Minister, deep in discussion as they were swiftly escorted inside a building by stern faced security officers.
“Artur, eat your food.” Steve commanded softly. “And don't encourage him,” he added under his breath bitterly. Rather than listen Artur sank further into his seat glancing back and forth between his siblings, one hand straying to his mouth with anxiousness.
"Not quite." Steve gritted out. “I don’t care what the abbot wants Tony.”
He felt a small smile forming as he leaned toward her, making a show of looming as he crossed his arms imperiously and waited.
One, two, just one foot in front of the other. He could do it. He was brave. Ian clenched his jaw and marched onward. Over the sound of the crowd and the under-hum of music Ian thought he could hear the click of his younger brothers boots behind him. Three four five, perfectly measured thirty inch steps. Now pivot. He clicked his heels together and let the standard slide through his fingers until the stub thumped the ground and stared straight ahead, at his father who was standing upon the short stage.
"He is. How did you know?"
"We left Sara's bear. She can't sleep without it." the boy said and the baroness twisted around in her seat, her pretty mouth turning down in a sympathetic frown. "Darling I'm sure it's in her trunk. We'll get out and look as soon as we've settled," she said, but the boy adamantly shook his head.
There was a police vehicle blocking the drive with a smaller black state car parked behind it. A man in a long trench coat stood beside the state car, smoking a cigarette as he looked up at their window. There were two officers with him that Tony could see, but he didn't doubt that there were more crawling over the grounds.
All her life she'd been taught the importance of obeying her authorities, and Father more so than most relied on their ability to follow command. He needed to know that they would behave because he couldn't always be there for them, not even when he was in the same room, and he didn't want them to get hurt.
Of course. Literature was closely watched by the Germans but was still one of the easiest ways to communicate across great distances. The Nazi’s wouldn’t pay much attention to a rag of this sort clearly meant for the entertainment of children and house wives. What better way to share news and ideas than through a publication?
“Alright, alright,
“Flighty as ever. Worse even, if you can imagine it, now that there is so much pressure to enlist. Of course, all Jonny wants to do is race.”
Rogers tucked the letters into a satchel and swept it under the desk with his heel before shoving aside the chair to sit in, and beginning to scribble, his brow furrowed, the graphite making large dark strokes on the paper. Dvořák surveyed him over the tip of his own document.
Dr. Fischer raised a brow, his expression unchanged, as if it wasn't even a possibility that they would arrive and find that the worst of the rumors were true, that Rogers was not ill but merely defiant.
Tony’s uncle had parted ways with them after they had safely reached Genoa.
“Yes Captain,” the maid answered quickly and expectantly.
In moments like this, he pulled up the memory from December. Tony had lost himself so often in the memory of dancing in Stefen’s arms, under moon and shadow, that it had all started to feel like a dream. Did it ache to remember? Like an open wound. But Tony did not know what he would have done without some sort of sign, that no matter how broken things were, Stefen still cherished him. Tony had only to close his eyes and remember that night to know the promise he wore hidden under his shirt still held true.
Major Rogers. Who was that?
"Please ignore me. It will fade," she insisted but Deiter ignored her and reached for his hand radio.
Tony’s mouth went dry.
“A boy and a girl. Twins. My nephew, has a mouse and his sister has the family cat. He likes to play a game with the mouse- little Hans he calls it. He’ll set the family cat out and let little Hans try to out run him.”
“What?” Khalmmer gaped, startled. “Major are you al-”
He didn’t want them to know. Sometimes he didn’t even want to know what he was thinking. It got very bad inside his head.
“Peliali?” Tony asked, though he didn’t truly need to. The girl had her mother’s look, Maria’s South-American roots still telling tales through the dusky hue of her daughter’s skin. The young woman nodded but did not step closer.
“His symptoms are progressed, but he shows all the signs of Scarlet Fever. Which makes him highly contagious.”
"Tony informs me you've been accepted into the International school of Geneva. I think you should go."
“Because we’ll never get anywhere without a head start. Father’s going to come after us as soon as he knows we’re gone. Somebody has to stay to stall him.” And Natacha
Even so, she pressed her lips together and shook her head arguing, “If you could walk faster than Patroche I’d let you. You won’t make it on your own.”
Bucky sighed, listening to Steve move about in the washroom. No doubt scrubbing away all evidence of his slip the night before.
Ashamed? Natacha could only stare up at him in numb shock as his eyes blurred with tears and his big hands cradled her cheeks. He kissed both, one after the other with tender reverence, like she’d seen priests kiss statues of saints. He was shaking, and the realization made her heart twist. Her grip on him tightened unconsciously, desperate to give reassurance but not knowing how to give it or even how it could be that he was the one shamed.
“But horses get tired and that is a lot of land to cover.” Tony pointed out. “It seems Péter would need a steed capable of flight to be able to cover that much ground so quickly. Not to mention strong enough to carry him."
Cruel hands gripped is face, brutally twisting his neck until he was eye to eye with the blurred creature swaying above him. His eyes leaked with tears from the wave of pain. There was nothing he could do but ride it.
“What did she say to that?” Steve wondered, because hearing Charlotte say it like that, all prim and cool, it just made the whole thing sound so cold blooded.
the water. She just wasn’t any good at the swimming part yet.
“Right. So you say you’re going to take down the Nazis. How?” Steve pushed down the emotions that Dernier’s letter had dug up, needing a clear head and focus.
He latched onto the thought like a lifeline. He had to stop her. How wasn’t a thought. How was irrelevant as he stalked toward her with clenched fists. She had to be stopped. That was all, and he couldn’t let anything stop him.
It was an endearing sight to be sure. He was glad for their sake that the authorities had enough mercy left in them to put them in the care of their mother's kin. They would need a woman's tender devotion after the horrible way they'd lost their father. The way they'd been made to bury their grief and disavow him was a senseless cruelty on top of it that Deiter found it hard to stomach.
“There's a man-” Ona began, voice small and shocked, fading out to nothing over the distance.
“I figured that would be high on your list. What else? We have hours before sundown.”
"We can start with my zoogly book!" He exclaimed and Tony chuckled.
"He threw the knife." Natacha's fingers tightened in Bucky's shirt, her heart thudding like a drum behind her ribs as his meaning sank in.
Herr Bakhizen blinked slowly, as if shocked and then barked a harsh laugh.
Ian gave a tiny giggle at the ticklish touch, holding on to Steve’s forearm with one hand. His eyes still closed in a look of contentment.
“Yes, pray tell Herr Stark. What is this mission?” Rogers followed with another tired drawl. Tony ignored him.
“You have mail from Berlin.”
However it wasn’t either of them Péter was looking expectantly at.
“Stefen…” Tony sounded scared. Which was funny. Funny that they should both realize they scared one another in the same day.
“Hello, Captain.”
Possibly it made him an asshole but Bucky was privately very pleased that nature wasn’t going to let Stefen burry all his sins. Not forever.
“… Actually. The Führer says that intellectualism and vain artistry has made Germans soft. He says that books provide too wide a window for corruption to enter the mind and that good citizens know that what Germany needs is dedicated men and women for labor and service.”
She liked music and would like to learn to sing. Tony's mind instantly went back to his first day, how she’d hidden in the music room and how she’d calmed during the storm when he’d taught them all how to yodel.
"This is Péter Maximoff and his sister Anya. They're part of a new act James is putting together. I'm sure he must have -"
needs my help? I am done helping him.”
The boy didn’t answer, grinding his teeth mulishly in that (patented, Tony was going to get the damn thing patented) stubborn Rogers way. Next to him Ian was already reaching for his own roll to offer to him and Tony frowned. What was wrong with him? Tony didn't know eleven-year-old’s existed who gave away their food by choice, and Ian’s little brother was terrible to him most of the time. Where on earth had Ian learned to be so self-sacrificing?
“-boats, please.” Ian insisted a touch louder and a lot more stubborn and Tony gave up while he was ahead.
“Really?” Péter needled, munching on a corner of his sandwich. He barely finished swallowing before he finished with, “I bet if one of those fellows you read about in your magazines called you his stars you’d give him a second look.”
The dark stain on his pale skin was unmistakable and coupled with the vivid fingerprint bruises dotting his neck he looked like someone had attempted to murder him (and succeed).
"I don't know." Charlotte answered, her mouth tightening. "But I bet you will enjoy a few more days without schooling.”
"So that was the plan was it? Hide out and live under the stairs?" Tony tilted his head, eyeing the old boxes and forgotten things that cluttered the space around them with a curious expression. "But won't you get hungry? A growing boy like you needs to eat."
“There are few things with more power than a myth.” Farkas leveled him with an intense look, holding him in place with his stare. “It’s not the name, Stark, but the legend behind it. Hughard understood that. He told me he believed you would change the world. Change the war.”
It rang once more and Tony felt Stefen begin to move.
He pulled back with a sniff, shaking his head until the tears had been banished, but his voice was still rough when he spoke again.
He should probably try and eat something himself before he went to fetch Charlotte, who was returning from Vienna on the morning train, but he didn’t have the stomach for it that morning. He’d been forced to go without enough times to know his body’s limits. Tony on the other hand was revealing a worrisome propensity to forget his bodily needs entirely in favor of his work in the workshop.
"Hey! You there." A voice called sharply and Péter realizing in an instant of shaking legs and pounding heart finding none of his father's bravery and ease with command, in a split moments decision decided to try and be somebody else instead.
making them better singers. Cushioning around the larynx produces a more pleasing sound, and it’s nearly impossible to have cushion around the throat without a little padding elsewhere.”
We can't thank you enough for being here, for providing us with this safe space to express our creativity and work through our thoughts on family, identity, and the importance of loving your fellow man. It's definitely the story we needed to write for us. We hope there are others out there who can get just as much out of it.
Willamina turned with a horrified look on her face as she deposited a long wooden board and a few small jars of spices in his arms.
“Yes. He barely has a voice but-yes.” Tony pulled his weary body away from the captains and rubbed at his eyes, heavy in their sockets. “His temperature evened out to 38.9 about an hour ago and hasn't moved, thank god. His voice sounds like someone took a shive to his vocal chords.”
Stefen was clearly on some sort of mission, and somehow it involved the children.
Shame flushed through him. What would father think, Ian not wanting to comfort his crying baby sister?
His friend's brow was puckered with worry, his plump lower lip bitten red from where he'd worried it raw with his teeth, his mess of dark hair hanging ragged over his eyes - his ma was going to come after him with the scissors again.
Tony woke slowly and stared at the ceiling of the cabin. He breathed deeply in and out for a moment, listening to the crackle of the fire as the tears dried on his cheeks.
There was nothing wrong in nature with a man seeing his long time employee off on the train, but in these times there was nothing quite right about it either when that employee looked like Sam. It was frustratingly stupid, in Steve’s opinion but he had a dangerous letter on his person and the children to think of. That man outside had been watching so closely, it still gave Steve the shivers to remember it.
He could hold his liquor, he was a captain after all, but something about the sight of his cup being filled with black made him nearly giggle.
Ian turned at the sound of Tony's voice to find their tutor leaning against the door frame watching him with a strange look on his face. Tony was thinking again, those thoughts that made him stay in the garage hours on end, the ones that made lessons hard to follow and Tony brittle at meal times.
“Of course! It'll give me a chance to say goodbye to the dwarves. Willamina baked a few berliners for me to take with, I thought I might give them some, bribe them into writing me.”
“He told me… that I didn’t need to apologize.”
Steve didn't like it.
“Stefen! Breathe. Look at me!” Tony’s voice sliced through the fog, sharp and hot.
When the food was served, and she and her daughter were escorted out (Steve refrained from jerking Bucky back by the collar when he wouldn’t stop his flirting, but it was only just) he made himself of use and brought rations to the squad on watch.
Steve took a breath and because he was fucking selfish, continued.
Steve would close his eyes and remind himself that soldiers didn’t get to choose when they died. Sacrifice was what they did. But then his thoughts would flitter over the months that Tony had been with them: a lazy summer day on the lake, building boats, teaching the children to shoot and strolling hand in hand in Vienna.
No, I am here on the Abbot’s errand and hopefully God’s as well.  There have been unspeakable rumors of mistreatment the prisoners have faced here at Dachau. Cardinal Rossi wrote all the way from Rome to urge the Abbot to intercede on behalf of the Church. Together we journeyed to Dachau to investigate these rumors (myself to take notes).
"You look like you”. He’d finally admonished himself and got on with it. It was a simple matter of science really and required that sort of perspective. A face was nothing more than a composition of scrambled traits.
“Do you know what you're asking of yourself, Stefen?”
The house was quiet and dark, but Steve knew how deceptive the quiet could be. Quiet nights could erupt with the sound of exploding shells, come alive with flashes of fire, and have your ears ringing with the booming of canons in seconds. A quiet evening could become swallowed by the roar of a mob before a man could blink.
But Tony had no time to take himself apart or let himself cry and worry about the future. What right did he have to do any of that? His future was set wasn’t it? He was safe because Hughard had falsified his birth documents and paid the right public official to ignore it. He was safe because Hughard had sent him to St. Péter’s abbey and to the world, Antony Stark was just an ordinary monk. Tony was safe because he was Captain Roger’s lover. He got to sit in the lap of luxury, safe and comfortable, while better men risked their lives.
father’s rules and still decided to disobey-”
Dead. Dead eyes.
“No one wishes to upset the good Captain, or to imply that he is at all involved in this, however it is a large house with many staff. There is a lot someone could miss in a house this size,” he said.
Tony merely glanced into the nursery where the little girls still slept. It was distressingly free of children. If the ring leaders were gone then there was barely any point in looking for the others in their rooms, Tony was thinking to himself as he turned his thoughts toward the outside and searching the house grounds.
Stefen was so still that it didn't even look as if he were breathing. It was almost a marvel, how close the violence in him had come to the surface, only held back by the iron grip of his will.
He struggled to recall the details of the night as he blinked his eyes clear. The night was a smear in his mind, but slowly it came back to him. Billy had left with the book and just as they’d planned, Bucky’d left the villa not long after, leading the tail Striker had set on him on a pointless and winding chase through salzburgerland that had ended there at the inn. He'd passed out on the bed almost as soon as he'd laid eyes on it.
It seemed somebody else had the same thought, or maybe enough people had complained, because not a breath later a police officer blew sharply on his whistle and began to holler.
“Evening Cap,” Tony greeted, poking his head out the bedroom door as Stefen walked into the sitting room. “They’re almost ready for you. We’re doing hair, which isn’t as easy as it looks when you’ve only the one comb between each of the sexes.”
Tony fumbled to catch the envelope as the man moved his hand, and the shape of whatever was inside must have excited him because a moment later he’d torn open the top and dumped a tiny metal ring with two iron keys on it into his hand. Péter expected him to turn and try and open the door again with the same urgency he’d had before, but Tony paused, his brow furrowing deeply in confusion and in curiously wounded tone, asked single question, “You’re leaving?”
“You look well enough. I will say that, but I would like to speak to you privately regarding how you’ve been treated since you’ve been stationed here.”  Tony announced as planned and Bruce, going right along with it gently nodded.
“I have some news, though whether it will be helpful to you or not, time will tell.”Grig spoke again after some time and Tony turned his head to him quickly, unable to help the rise of apprehension tinged with hope in his chest.  Tony called for Stefen’s attention, having to wave and raise his voice before it seemed to register with the captain. Between Bucky’s loss, and having to part from the youngest children, Stefen had become depressed and withdrawn. He’d closed everyone out, and Tony’s only plan was to keep on offering comfort and hope that time healed some of Stefen’s heartache enough to allow him to let them back in.
“What is this? Do I look like a child to you Stefen?”
Tony whispered in his ear.
“Perhaps you could share with your father?” he suggested, hoping that the child’s desire to be close to his father would win out over the fears that came with sleeping in a new place. It was a good gamble because Tony could see the moment the idea took hold and the resulting war that crossed the little boy’s expression.
“You mean when the shopkeepers all but saluted you?” Tony scoffed. “You were there, doing something for the resistance effort. Picking up that parcel in your hand I imagine.”
) to ask what had gone so terribly wrong in the space of hours for Natacha to behave this way – when the sound of running footsteps drew both their eyes to the door and Ian came bolting in, terror plastered across his face.
‘Why, Mr. Stark was looking through our records for information on an Isiah Carboni’ they would say, and from there it was only a short trail to the truth of his birth that not even Hughard’s money could completely wash away. It was a risk he’d had to take, but it still left him feeling jumpy. It had been over twenty years since he’d left Pola and he needed something more to give the solicitor than one old address.
This was madness. How could they do this?!
James, who had sprinted up ahead to peer into the window of a toy shop trotted back agreeably enough (Tony could only thank their lucky stars) and seemed happy to walk next to Natacha, his eyes sparkling as she pointed at a display of sweet breads in the window of a small café house.
Artur’s company had been nice, made his stomach less wibbly, but then Artur had fallen asleep, his face buried in Ian’s shoulder. Ian let out a shaky breath. His thoughts inevitably turning once more to his father leaving.
“Of course, we are.” Artur snapped and the man looked at him like Artur was a bug he wanted to squash.
“You don’t have a choice.” she hissed in reply and he flinched. “You’re going to get a hold of yourself and go out there. You will not run away from this like a coward-”
The captain gripped his arms, his back stiff, head swiveling as he looked back and forth for danger, until his eyes followed where Tony’s were locked on a flyer plastered to the side of the lamp post.
Tony heard his feet crunching in the snow before his cousin Grigur appeared, joining Tony where he sat on the bench in the yard watching Stefen go about his morning exercise.
The man in the cap gave him a scrutinizing stare before shrugging and turning his attention back to his paper. The woman on the other hand looked stunned, her eyes flicking over his uniform in disbelief as if she had to check to be sure her eyes weren't playing tricks on her. But she wasn't brave enough to challenge him on it further and for once he was grateful.  At that moment the whistle for the next train filled the cafe, the windows beginning to rattle as the train approached the station. The cafe filled with motion as most of its cliental, including the man in the cap, hastened to wrap up their lunches and head toward the station down the street. Deiter watched him go, trying to determine why the sense of familiarity still nagged him as the man disappeared into the crowd.
Every day after afternoon lessons Péter and his siblings, except for Maria and Sara who were still too young for the youth programs, made their way into town to meet up with their units. And every evening at five o'clock with the squads released them to go home to their dinners, Péter met up with his siblings in the square to begin the journey home.
Khalmmer closed the door softly behind himself, and then came slowly into the room until he was standing behind Steve like a too large shadow. The silence between them was heavy with tension, and the hairs rose on the back of his neck.
Tony couldn’t help but still at her words, thinking of the mouse Artur had caught awhile back and how he’d teased his younger sisters with it before Tony had intervened. All he could see was Natacha taking notes in her journal, watching Tony try and choral the circus Artur and his latest little friend had created with a smirk on her face.
The rioting was like a tide going in and going out. One moment the street outside was quiet the next, someone had started a fight or broken a window and the wail of fire engines would shatter the stillness.  They were doing everything they could, a neighboring tenant had assured them, to protect the homes and businesses of Good Germans from the flames engulfing they synagogues and other Jewish establishments.
“He should stay.” James shot them all a glare, daring Peter and Ian to challenge him. As if he were the only one who cared that father was going back to the army.
Tony looked at each of them, reassuring Ian and James with his gaze before locking eyes with Péter and nodding his head toward the window. Natacha would be waiting for a signal.
Bucky smiled at the thought. He and his little shadow were alike that way. Bucky’s mother had always warned there was power in names. First time he’d held the little brat, Bucky had determined that James Rogers was going to get a better hand out of life than he himself had been dealt.
In which we learn more about what Steve was up to in Vienna and discover that Steve is neither the shining picture of Aryan supremacy that the government likes to tote nor is he anything close to as put together as he appears. But we knew that.
Tony was still gaping at the housekeepers informal use of his name even as Maria shook her head, looking back at him as if he might grow another head. Then she leaned to her left and whispered something in Artur’s ear and the little boy pinked sticking his hand into his mouth in a nervous gesture.
His tone was terse and did the job of cooling off the rest of Tony’s thoughts. Stefen seemed irritated now. Irritation that, Tony guessed, had less to do with his inability to shoot and more to do with his blatant refusal to try. Well, he could just get used to it. If Stefen wasn’t going to be honest than Tony wasn’t going to exert himself. Every action had an equal and opposite reaction.
Tony spent a very cold (very undignified) couple of hours with the sheep. The familiar monk's habit was thick, but no match for the winter chill even so. Despite the discomfort, he was thankful that the bitter weather provided him a ready excuse for keeping his hood up and his body hunched over when a soldier stepped out of the barn for a smoke. Even from a distance he could feel the man's eyes on him, and he did his best to keep his face shielded but not look like he was hiding. Thankfully the soldier with the cigarette didn't prove curious enough to trek through the snow to question the miserable little man who'd obviously gotten the unluckiest task on the abbey chore list.
General Striker plucked it out of his hand and turned to father, a small smile playing over his lips. It didn’t match the cold gleam in his eyes Ian thought, frowning a little. His eyes jerked back to his father to find that Da’s eyes were on Striker now. They were ice cold.
“Forget the lessons for today. Virginia says you’ve been pounding away in here every night since Joshua left.” His too intelligent eyes roved over Tony’s body like he could see through his skin and Tony fidgeted. “You don’t come to dinner and you don’t come out till somebody comes to remind you what hour it is in the morning. Have you slept in days?”
“Herr Hammer what is the –” she began but Hammer didn’t wait, rushing forward to grab the woman by the arms and hiss lowly as if he expected someone to overhear.
It smacked him in the face on the way down, but Tony grabbed ahold of it gladly, using the secured rope to climb the rest of the way inside of the loft with ease.
Tacha gave him a smile but it was hesitant. Péter had gone back to his bowl, almost hunched over it as he ate.
They hadn’t spoken since Tony had sent that scathing letter, blaming him for once again abandoning the children when they needed him most. Met with Stefen’s silence in reply, he regretted parts of it now, or at least, regretted perhaps not moderating his tone so that the words did not read so harshly. He’d expected the Captain’s reply to be clipped and harsh in its own way when it finally arrived; but what he held in his hands was the exact opposite of either.
Steve and Tony spent the afternoon carefully drafting a reply, knowing that communication would be excruciatingly slow and that they may not have many more chances to speak this way before this avenue closed to them.
“I didn't know.” Tony replied, gathering a little enjoyment from the way Ian's eyes widened even further in confusion. “It’s called deductive reasoning. If you’re interested, maybe it’s something I can teach you.” He turned and then with a wink he tossed over his shoulder, “Carry on.”
"I aint going to argue with you about this.” Bucky barked back. “You step near that bed you better be prepared to get knocked on your ass."
It was set up, as most of the more private rooms where, with a small bar, and practical sofas opposite the large desk. Distantly he realized that it might be considered rude to enter his hosts private study before he’d even arrived, but the room was empty and it let him breathe and that stuck at the front of his mind.
How then, did one ask a brother to risk everything on this one, and now perhaps final, venture? Bucky had a family, a father and sister, that he supported. Austria had made good on her promises to them both. Bucky had happily retired from the military with his citizenship and built a respectable life for himself. How could he ask him to betray that now?
Steve desperately clung to consciousness, sucking in great lungfuls of cold air.
“There is a ship waiting in Belgium to take the twins to England.” Tony blinked, startled at the bald honesty Stefen offered him so quietly. He looked up just as Stefen took another step toward him. “We found someone at the immigration office willing to forge their papers. I can’t tell you more than that, Tony. The less you know-”
Tony’s room was on the same floor as the room that Pepper used when she chose to stay the night. They shared the floor with the family. An odd choice, but Tony couldn’t complain. It did make spying ever so much easier.
“We respect your need for discretion.”
So Stefen was getting married. Fine. Good. Expected even. He was still young after all. People would find it odd if he never sought female companionship. And the Captain was not the sort of person who engaged in light hearted affairs – at least not where women were concerned, Tony thought with a sneer. Clearly where men were concerned Stefen didn’t feel so bound to be forthcoming about something as monumental as an upcoming marriage.
“We’re going to brunch with the Baroness.” Natacha supplied helpfully and Stefen nodded quickly, finding himself babbling.
Shaking his head Steve turned and entered the bar.
“It’s been my pleasure, Captain.” Was all Weiss said in reply, but to Tony it seemed that a wealth of words had passed between them. And then the gardener’s dark eyes fixed on him as he said, “you be sure and take care now, Herr Stark.”
“Since you seem too hung up on picking fights, Sara and I can take care of the supplies. In fact she can build the damn puppets herself!”
“What do you want Péter?” Tony asked and the boy’s eyes flew from the mess in the corner back to him. As if snapped from a daze Péter’s mouth shut into a firm line, his back straighter and prouder than it had any right to be on a body so young and untried. Tony didn’t know what to think about the feeling of mirth that overtook him, watching this gangly boy (all limbs and bravado) square his jaw and ask with the sobriety of a seasoned General whether or not Tony was feeling fit to come out of his room.
’, but it was not Tony who had mistaken a perfect stranger for one of the children. Tony was not that weak minded.
Dvorak didn’t see him fall, because he was already falling himself his momentum halted by the violent punch of bullets.
Tony could see the slow dawning of awe as Rogers realized that Tony was talking about him followed by a sort of wonder filled bewilderment as if he couldn’t comprehend himself as a hero to anyone, especially a young boy grappling with the harsh realities of war and the terrible loss of his parents.
“They arrested him in Munich.” Stefen answered, voice pitched equally low. “By the time we heard they’d already transferred him to Dachau. I’ve asked after him but I have to be discreet. There hasn’t been a Deurr scheduled for execution.”
“Jal avree.”
Maybe he'd realize that playing hero never did their father any good either and find his way home. She only let herself dwell on it for a moment, because she knew what unfounded hope felt like by now and there wasn't time for that kind of foolishness. Péter would come home, or he wouldn't. The family would go to Switzerland with or without him and there was nothing she could do about it either way. Father would come out of his dark mood or he wouldn't, and whether he did or didn't, somebody needed to find an excuse for why he was ignoring his orders.
The thing was. Tony wasn’t so good with orders.
Natacha, who had been looking down at her plate with her shoulders hunched, jerked her head up and stared directly at Charlotte with cold blue eyes.
“This is happening in other parts of the city? He asked, his pulse beginning to elevate. Something was about to happen. It was a metallic taste on his tongue with every breath he took. A feeling on his skin, like a hand passing too close.
Natacha raised her hand then, snatched it back down, blushing faintly at the ingrained reaction before she straightened regally in her chair.
*~*~*~
Coulson looked surprised, and then speculative.
When he walked in that night Hedwig (Etta and Henrick’s middle girl) was at the bar. She smiled brightly when she recognized him and Bucky gave her a wink before going to claim a table in the corner, in view of the door but tucked away from the others crowding the bar.
“These are decent. You must be well connected,” he commented, spooning the last of the sauced meat in his tin, using the remaining wedge of bread as a spoon. Carol chuckled.
“It’s foolishness I tell you.” Willamina grumbled.
He let the conversation flow over him, chiming in with platitudes when it felt like he was supposed to answer. He took another warm swallow of wine and then breathed in and out, slow and deep.
Mahrim- unclean spiritually, impure. A person as opposed to a status.
“I know, you’re a man now. Congratulations. You’ve been at it now for what, a week?” Tony replied with a snap, exasperated and too exhausted to have this discussion. “Your father and I are a bit ahead of you. We have learned a thing or two while we’ve been out here. Let us protect you where we can.”
"Sara?" Stefen dropped his razor into the wash bowl and took a step toward the little girl.  Sara extended her arms, letting the blanket fall to the floor as she ran toward her father, who was quick to scoop he up.
The man moved above him, leaned close, his blurred shape shifting as he drew closer. Not Schmidt – he hazily thought as he tried to focus on his attackers features through his blurred vision. The man’s lips were moving he realized, but there was sharp painful ringing filling Steve’s ears, so it was a moment before he heard anything at all. And when he did it was muffled, under water, because he was sinking.
Stefen’s jaw locked and he took an angry step forward and Tony tensed, muscles locking into place, bracing instinctively for a blow that didn’t come and Stefen jerked like he’d been struck instead and came to a sudden halt.
He'd gone straight to his room. Straight to his bookshelf.
But only if it worked.
Natacha swatted Péter away and took another sip of her drink. Snuggled comfortably next to Péter she flipped the pages off her magazine and for a time they sat in silence.
Tony gave him a loose two fingered salute and a grin to rival the Cheshire cat’s, jauntily wishing him farewell with an, “
“It’s so damn easy for you!” Stefen shouted at him. “You get to waltz in and do and say whatever the hell you want, and who the hell cares if you do? The only one who gets hurt when you fuck up is you. This is my family, Bucky! And they will
“The class overflowed again.” She answered, reaching for her coat hanging on one of the hooks by the door. She got herself into it, barely pausing to finish. “I volunteered to help get the new room set up.”
Tony shivered. A dangerous trek through the mountains with seven children in tow (in freezing temperatures no less) would be fraught with its own perils. There was a high chance they wouldn’t make it, and he wouldn’t put the children through that for anything if he didn’t have to.
“You barely slept Rogers, go back to sleep.”
Frauline Werner returned the salute and smiled down at her.
"I don't want to leave!" came one voice and before she could even determine who had spoken came another.
“Péter, I’m trusting you to look after our family while I’m away. Can you do that for me?”
First he unwrapped one of the small chocolates on the tray and placed it at the bottom of his cup, then he covered it with a thin layer of milk from the small pitcher before filling the cup to the brim with coffee. Stirred twice and it was perfection.
“Maybe I’d better take him for the night?” the monk fretted, but Artur didn’t seem to like this suggestion any better, sobbing now as he locked both arms around Steve as he shook and shuddered.
“Then why did you help me?” Tony snapped. The girl fell abruptly silent. What she didn’t do was move. She was trembling from head to toe and still planting herself in front of him like the mountain that wouldn’t be moved.
"I told you not to interfere, Tony! I have a plan and it might have a chance of working if you would fucking leave well enough alone!"
"Damn the staff, Bucky!"Steve snapped, already weary of the long argument ahead of him and in no mood for it.  "Say they're orphans. Say they're your long lost bastards! Say whatever you like, just do it without running your damn mouth!"
Péter and his sibling stood in the hall watching as Tony turned on his heel and disappeared.
“I’ll drink to that.” Kroger raised his polishing cloth in agreement.
"Everyone talks about your beard you know. They say it's eccentric."
And to finish us off on a high note. Another lovely visual by the amazing
“I’m sorry,
“I don’t want to leave Austria. I want things to go back how they were.”
“A soldier like your father?”
Steve jerked when something touched his arm.
“I know of a way to reach British Intelligence. Well, potentially.”
"Got to get back on my feet." Steve grunted as he struggled to catch his breath, but deep down he was grateful that Tony had made him stop. He wasn't convinced he hadn't been trampled by a horse when he wasn't looking.
"You got any more tricks in that case of yours?" Bucky asked, a wild sort of roundness in his eye that made Tony think he was as close to panic as he ever got.  He could commiserate. In answer Tony turned around, praying he wasn't about to be shot and shimmied his way through the shattered back window.
James Bakhuizen.
Searching for Charlotte in the crush of bodies Steve’ started in surprise as Duchess Siv appeared beside him looking unbothered at all by the heavy rain. He held his umbrella out for her and she smiled gratefully at him, her red mouth a stark contrast to her pale skin, the sight hitting him rather viciously in the gut.
“It is most certainly not
Péter caught Tony’s eye, his face full of question and Tony shook his head. James’ dark moods could prove volatile at the drop of a hat and the last couple of days had been peaceful. With their projects wrapping up he doubted there would be much more of that in the days to come.
still called her Ginger Rogers to tease her. He called her other things too in the gypsy tongue. Lovely little names, ripe with fondness and paternal affection. Little one, gypsy girl, darling. He said them in German sometimes too, but privately she liked it best when he spoke in Romany because it felt like an invitation to discover parts of herself that she hadn’t dared yet to explore.
James didn’t go with the others to wave goodbye because it was pointless, and the way that everyone kept looking at him as if they expected him to explode at any moment made him mad. It wasn’t like James had never been left before. Father had always left them behind. Only it hadn’t mattered as much at first because he had mama, but then his mother had gotten sick. She’d left too. Everybody left eventually.
He wiped his eyes with the back of his palm when they began to sting and finished with a grunt.
“One, it will teach you not use me as a way of avoiding things. And two, there’s no reason that they shouldn’t. The cat is already out of the bag about their talent, and they sing whenever your General Schmidt calls for it anyway.”
"For you Pep, anything, but don't tell Hammer you had the monk answering the door or he's liable to have kittens."
“He’s really going to play!” Tony heard Ian gasp and a moment later, as if drawn like moths to a flame, the rest of the Rogers children had emerged from the crowd to collect around their father and their uncle. James handed Bucky his violin and Bucky winked at him, his smile just as big and bright with anticipation as the little boys.
They found Tony bent over the piano, concentrating fully on the music he was plying from its keys. Over the weeks the sharp pang Steve felt every time he heard the sound of his wife’s piano being played after all these years had lessoned into a dull thud, like a bruise, but it ached sharply now for an entirely different reason. Tony and the children had slowly infiltrated the room.
Steve took a deep breath and choked on the putrid smell of burning paint and chemicals. The smoke in the air making his eyes sting. He pushed aside the fear in exchange for red hot focus. He was hardly a block away but it was clear he’d have to leave the bike if he was going to make it through this crowd. Steve let it fall and began to elbow his way trough the crowd toward the Music Hall.
On his left between Natacha and Ian, James threw himself back against the pew huffily, with a great show of misery. Then again perhaps not, Tony thought with a wince. Pola had spoiled them all.
Lt. Steven's chest swelled with pride, though he stayed silent as his captain glared the agent down. The tense silence was finally broken by a rapid knock on the door.
“But something magical happened then. The magic stone heard them say that they were hungry and began to glow, suddenly the table was filled with pots and pans containing every delicious food you can imagine. And from that day forward whatever the boy and his mother needed, the magic stone would give it to them.”
A moment later Stefen stood in the doorway as imposing a figure as ever despite his hanging suspenders, rolled up sleeves and untucked shirt. Tony blinked in surprise at the man's rumpled state. It wasn't as undone as he'd been on the lake (and not nearly as undone as Tony wanted to undo him) but leisure certainly agreed with the man.
He’d been expelled for misconduct but at that point they had just been looking for reasons to be rid of him. As usual, Tony had been leagues ahead of peers and teachers alike and met with near instant dislike for that very fact. Forced with prejudice at times to go at the snail’s pace of his peers he’d been a very bored and often times belligerent student.
"Then catch up on your school work! You've fallen behind in your English, haven't you?"
His dress uniforms hung pressed and ready for use. Ian always had them ready, that was just how you did things. He snatched them off the hanger bed and without stopping to think and ripped off the patch Julia had sewn on. It lay limply in his hand like a crushed butterfly. Gritting his teeth, Ian began to rip off the buttons.
Charlotte looked down. Though she chuckled softly, her gloved hands clenched tightly in her lap.
“Medals for child bearing?” Tony asked incredulously from the backseat and Charlotte nodded.
He didn’t have to think about how, in the end, they all might.
"Best do as they say love," he heard Pepper mutter and then the stroppy retreat of footsteps as Péter left the room, slamming the door shut heavily behind him.
“I think with your children is a good choice.” Tony offered gently. “What you gave them today is priceless Stefen.” Tony wanted to say so much more than that, but he couldn’t. He hoped Stefen understood.
He shut the door with a click, satisfied that for once Stark had nothing to say.
“My family are patriots...” She struggled to get out, her voice growing hoarse.
Tony’s throat constricted, and he lowered his head, unable to finish the thought. It was still so hard, after all these years, to think about his parents. He jerked slightly in surprise as Stefen’s hand cupped one side of his neck, the unexpected touch drawing his gaze back up until their eyes met again – Stefen's clear and bright, as well as firm in their conviction.
Péter froze, eyes wide at the strong language coming from his tutor (not to mention a monk) and Tony hastened to amend. “What I mean to say is, not everyone has the benefit of being believed in. Not something I’d rely on personally. If you believe in you that’s all that matters.”
"Did he now?" Tony asked as Maria clamped onto his side. Tony picked her up wordlessly, looking toward her father who suspiciously couldn't seem to meet Tony's eyes just then. "Well I imagine that Uncle Bucky didn't want Herr Rabbit to be in any more pain than he already was."
.” Tony squeezed his shoulders, looking up at him with a face full of worry.  Steve jerked away, because Tony didn’t need to worry about him, and he was late to start his morning routine. Natacha was safe and that was all that mattered.
Bucky laughed, but it fell flat as Steve’s hand tightened on the velvet box, a strangely wounded expression flashing through his eyes before it was replaced by familiar anger. It was an anger Bucky felt every day.
Tony encountered the first snag since leaving the house that morning while trying to direct their attendant with the luggage. There wasn’t a hotel grand enough in all the world to provide enough beds for seven children and three adults so it was quite obvious that they’d have to share. Less obvious was how to pair off.
Ian had decided to fuss over him it seemed, and Tony didn't have the heart to tell him he'd chosen the worst day to start. It was still hours to sundown... but oh well.
“Well if you must know, since you’ve forbidden anyone to go near the perfectly good radio I built, I have a mind to transform the smaller sitting room into a workshop. For the children.”
He watched Stefen and Natacha as they began to dance, completely focused on one another and forgetting about him entirely, but for once Tony didn’t mind so much being left behind. Not if it meant he got to watch Stefen dance with his daughter, both of them wearing identically shy, coltish expressions of delight, their burdens put away for the duration of a dance.
“Sit. Down.” Steve bit out. The last of his patience snapping.
“Ach, the Germans can’t force us to forget we are Italian. That will never change for us.” Antonia wiped his cheek with her thumb as if he had a smudge of dirt there. Considering that every knock on the door sent him down to the dirt cellar it wasn’t impossible.
Bucky kept up a calm façade because there was nothing else to do at this stage. Whether Dvorak had told them the truth or sold them out, they’d be ready for whatever came their way. Bucky took another deep breath, letting the ice in the air fill his lungs and steady his resolve. A flash of movement in the white landscape caught his eye and he stiffened, raising his binoculars and peering through them down at the distant stretch of road peeking through the snow laden trees.
Logic also said that Stefen blew too hot and cold to be trusted with such a monumental confession. Not so readily. Not until he proved he could take the things Tony had said seriously. Stefen had talked of permanence but Tony had to wonder how much Stefen could really know of his own feelings. He doubted if Stefen had ever been with a man before. How could he be so sure he understood what he was undertaking? An affair of the moment was one thing. Tony had lain with many a lover behind closed doors while bar keeps and bell hops had seemed happy to look the other way, but it was an entirely different sort of risk one took when they tried for permanency and Stefen had the children to consider.
,” Isiah had said, the hand on his shoulder moving up to squeeze the back of his neck.
not. He’d given them to Stark!
“… so, since U-235 is far more potent than U-238. We’d have to isolate it and frankly progress in the area of isolating these kinds of isotopes is still very new.” Tony explained. The bed was littered with open books, papers and charts which had finally arrived from the abbey, curtesy of Bruce. Péter scribbled furiously in the journal on his lap, his face screwed up in thought.
Why, in the right light he and Bakhuizen looked like a pair of gypsies. Lucky for Stefen he was hardly ever in the right light for it and that golden hair of his was all the credit he needed and besides Tony had never seen a gypsy without a caravan. It simply did not happen.
Stefen Rogers leaned against the door of his office for support. What a sense of humor Father Farkas was turning out to have. What a waste of his time and energies (energy he had too precious little of at present). Surely the Abbot had not meant to send that man in answer to his request, unless it was in jest. Herr Stark was not fit to watch a cat let alone a child!
“Then we face them together.” Steve promised. Swore it on his soul. “Tony I need you to come downstairs. I need – I need you where I can see you.”
Tony watched as Stefen backed away from him, face shuttering once more, erecting walls of silence between them and he could have cursed.
1. Due to busyness with family, life, and work, we've fallen off answering your comments and we feel horrible about this. Consider us trash. To rectify this we've both cleared out a few hours on Friday the 5th where we're going to get together and answer all new comments, and start chipping away at the back log. We love you guys and want to be sure and show our appreciation for taking this long journey with us.
Tony clenched his hands, struck by the realization that he wasn’t sure. Maybe Obadiah would have thought to write him if his grandmother had passed. Probably not. It wasn’t as if they’d kept in contact. The Carbonis had been held at a distance before Tony was even born. The reality was that Nonna and Nonno could very well have died and Tony would have no idea. But the thought was too painful to bear so Tony shoved it away, buried it so far down it would have no chance of rising again to haunt him.
Steve was drowning. He could recognize that. The rage that surged through him in waves was only superseded by the panic sucking at his insides. It was too
“Major Rogers is right.” Khalmmer finally said into the silence and Steve’s eyes flew to his. “We are not the monsters our foreign enemies paint us. Only, just last week I oversaw the removal of a band of illegal Jews…”
“Up to no good I tell you.” he barked in the direction of the officers who pointedly ignored him. “She never mentioned a sister to me.”
“What’s the second thing?” he asked and Bucky paused before grumbling.
Willamina scoffed as the radio host paused for breath, and then launched into a report on the mobilization effort of the army and the reputably countless demonstrations of support popping up all over the country as they prepared themselves for the inevitable pushback of Hitler’s plans to invade the borderlands.
“Alright love, there’s some beef cut up and some sour cabbage in the pot there,” she relented with a sigh, jerking her head in the direction of a large clay jar on the counter not far from a row of jams.
“But it’s our understanding you attended the Academy of Sciences in Berlin?” Hoch questioned hopefully.
With his stomach in his throat he rushed to find his father.
“I’m sure she didn’t think it was a bother.”
It was true. Ian had stayed on the bank hovering around his father like a moth to flame as the captain had gone about his work, mostly ignoring the boy’s presence. Only once had Ian ventured away from him to have a look at some interesting rocks that Péter and Artur had dragged up out of the lake.
But things were different now. Steve was a captain in the German army and definitely a traitor by anyone's standards. His superiors suspected it but couldn’t prove it.
“Because they will hurt us if you don’t.”
“Fabels Metals has their headquarters in town. At least they used to. We used to buy all of our steel from Fabels.” Tony rambled. Stefen just stared at him, though it was with a quiet intensity that made him sure that Stefen was observing him very carefully.
He paused, worrying his bottom lip while he considered what to do.
"My entire Romani identity is invested in my grandmother and what she taught me, and her identity springs from what her family could pass on to her while simultaneously obscuring their ethnicity and shedding their culture, attempting to avoid the gas chambers or a bullet in a ditch. My beautiful and resourceful great-grandmother decided to re-marry a cruel-but-useful gadjo and bring her three children with her to his farm in the countryside. There are whispers that her papers were forged but the details were lost a long time ago. This saved our line but left holes in our Romanipen. We lost parts of our Roma soul" - Jessica Riedy 2014, Blogger.
Stark moved away from him, his eyes raking up Steve's form. He was suddenly very aware that he was standing in his wrinkled day clothes in the middle of Stark’s room with a gun tucked away in his jacket. Well, today had certainly been eventful.
Special note.
"What about the monks? Maybe the abbey - " Scott began, but he trailed off as the back door opened and a man in a long coat shuffled into the alley. There was nothing to identify him openly as a threat. His clothes were neat and plain, and it wasn't uncommon for a man to want to smoke in peace. But Steve suspected there was more to him than met the eye. His back was too straight.
From there Ian could see out over the mountain side from here and down into the valley below. It was beautiful, but what had Ian’s heart kicking into high gear again was not the stars above, but lights twinkling between the trees, further down maybe about a hundred feet. He didn’t know if those lights belonged to an outpost, or perhaps another cabin but there was only one way to find out.
He’d not seen it then, how Tony had hung on the razor edge of bravery and stupidity. How much he’d trusted Steve to keep him safe. But Steve had failed everyone he loved. The children were... and Tony was...Tony was a Jew. If not for his own genius and the Reich’s greed, he’d be right beside Steve in this miserable hell and that was the truth.
~~*~*~
“Hurry up, Buck.” Stefen called from the door. “You don’t want Herr Stark to have all the coffee.”
He glanced up, looking for Stark and found him retreating back to the shore with James, his head bent close with the boys and saying something too low for Steve to make out.
"Yes." Herr stark replied politely but he offered nothing further. Charlotte got the distinct impression that he was bothered by her, a similar one she’d taken from all their other interactions few as they were. That was fine. She only needed his compliance, not his friendship.
The staff were digging into their meal when Steve walked into the kitchens. Their conversation immediately stopped and Herr Hammer jumped to attention, clearing his throat loudly.
"Do I even want to know why you have those?" he squeaked and Farkas gave him a stern look as he placed the folded garments within Tony's arms.
What had he expected was going to happen between him and Captain Rogers anyway? That they were going to run off to Switzerland and live happily ever after like a pair of old bachelor buddies?
As for Tony: Tony is in love with Captain Rogers. He's somewhat shocked by how not new this is.
From inside the loft it was easier to hear the goings on below. Their unidentified visitors were shuffling about, scraping the floors and occasionally banging a pot or a pan in the kitchen, bickering while they worked. It became clear to Tony after a few moments that the bickering couple had no idea that they were there. It sounded like they cleaned up and made repairs for the ageing owner. The husband was of the opinion that Philips had just forgotten to send word that they weren’t needed this season. The wife had found a stray toy and thought it odd that Philips would have a child with him. Odder still when the door to the loft stuck and refused to open, even when the husband took a hammer to it to knock it loose.
He hung the wool coverings Tony had made them by the fireplace and set a dozen stones on the grate to heat. He prepared, and he watched, and he waited.
“When do we receive our orders?” he asked.
"We were boxing today." Péter lied, shrugging off Ian's hand. "I got a few good licks in too."
His father couldn't eat and Péter had seen blood on the towels Bucky had been using to wipe his mouth. Péter knew what all those things meant. He'd watched both his grandmother and his mother get sick and die before this, so he knew what it looked like.
Virginia’s brow puckered with worry as Julia nodded and quickly disappeared through the serving door and into the kitchen to relay the request.
He just wanted to be left in peace, to close his eyes and not be chased, to drift away on a black river rocked into sleep, no fear of either dreams or waking. It was a terribly selfish desire, but Stefen had never been as good as he tried to be.
“We are engineering boats, steam powered boats.” Stark explained, though it was no real explanation at all. “And not to worry Captain, the crew has been warned to only use the steam power in controlled settings such as the bathtub, as unfortunately the steering will be limited.”
“Captain. So wonderful to see you.” General Schmidt stood just behind the girl, his arms crossed behind his back and posture ramrod straight as he smiled down at the child in a somewhat cold fashion. He seemed to suck the warmth out of the room just by standing there. “Ah and you brought your children. And what a fine recovery they have made. Perhaps our many prayers for them have been answered?”
"We've got the uniforms as well, though you'll have to do your best with sizing." The young woman Vis had brought announced, setting her basket down at his feet and Bucky knelt down to lift up the top of the basket and examine the shirts and bands inside, before looking the woman up and down.
Stefen’s thumbs stroked his cheeks and Tony’s eyes stung as something shifted within his chest, and he closed his eyes to keep the emotion from overwhelming him. He took a deep breath. He would not be silly and do something utterly embarrassing like start crying.
“Vater told us about the pamphlets. Lecture me when
, Frau Hogan, but
Rogers coughed again, a grumbling wet sound rattling his lungs that drew Dvorak's gaze back in time to see the man grasping weekly at the woman's wrist. He garbled something low through the wheezing in his chest that Dvorak failed to catch but it sounded horribly like pleading. Rogers was looking at his fiancé with exhaustion written all over his skin.  An exhaustion so deep it could only lead to the sleep of the dead.
Steve nearly missed the whispered words. He blinked out of his desperate thoughts to find Tony looking up at him, brown eyes wide and jaw set. Steve’s throat was tight with emotion, but the struggle for breath eased the longer he stared back at Tony. It seemed simple suddenly. Tony had said he could give no reason why Steve shouldn’t throw him out, but he had. He'd given every reason. After everything he'd done for Steve and the children, all the secrets he’d kept for them, Tony was a part of them.
“So if Artur has the runs again like tonight-”
But Tony was who he was. That was what Steve had maybe been missing. Tony wasn’t meant for confinement. If Steve built a cage he’d only break out of it.
Tony swallowed back the violent urge to protest. She'd made her point, she was not a child any longer, but that very fact only made Tony want to howl with outrage and beat at strangers.
He’d made up his mind several days ago to send for the children (and of course Tony). in truth, the moment he’d stepped inside his suite and got a good look at the empty room and an ear full of silence the first day they’d arrived he’d made his decision.
Ian's gaze moved to his father, the other person in the crowded room he found himself watching closely. He wasn't the only one either. Baroness Schrader had barely let him out of her sight. Probably so she could stop him from making a scene when either he or Natacha inevitably slipped out of his line of sight.
“Yes, those! I want to learn about spiders! And all the other animals, bugs too!” the boy paused for a quick breath and then added as an afterthought “Please!”
But besides sending word down the network, there was nothing he could do. It was well and truly out of his hands. Steve balled up the comforter between his fists and forced himself to keep his breathes even.
If Tony and Stefen’s path took them to a foreign battlefield, and the children’s paths diverged, what then? He didn’t know. He was facing that same demon that had dogged his steps in the mountains. Tony Stark was reduced to being just as lost as everyone else, and just as powerless to do anything about it.
He let a hand ghost over Ian’s chest, sliding over skin that was familiar in sight but so long untouched that it felt new, until he reached the boy’s sides.
One. Two. Natacha and Ian were visible by the floor to ceiling windows and overstuffed chairs, mingling with Emile and a group of other children.
“But I can’t help but think of Ret and Frank, and wonder what they would do without you. I wouldn’t blame you for sitting this out.”
The door to the music room creaked and Ian jerked, startled, sitting up to crane his neck and watch as the door creaked open.
“I’m sure, Dr. Erskine will be along...” He stopped, too winded to continue, but attempting to look as if speaking had not done just that. “I’m sure he’ll be here any...”
You could choke on the silence. Bucky reached for the maple sauce and drizzled it over his müesli and ham. The little droplets sounded like gongs and he mentally cursed the two of them for making him feel like he was one of the children. One thing was for sure if Stark didn't play along and keep quiet, Bucky was going to-
Steve stumbled to a halt and looked down at him. Artur blinked back and gave him his best smile.
“Okay.” Tony, never one to give up easily clapped his hands together. “Let us start from the beginning. Names, ages, and something important about yourself that I should know.”
Tony didn’t say anything more but his eyes said it all. Bucky had been wrong, Steve thought with wild elation. Tony really was with him. At least he wanted to be.
Bucky paused in his playing to draw his gaze back to where the kids were playing in the water. His eyes were drawn to Ian who was cutting a noisy line up and down the length of the dock, dogged in his efforts to become an accomplished swimmer and pleased as punch at the completion of each lap.
Tony swallowed. It wasn’t scarlet fever, Tony was certain, but that only meant it was something else. It went without saying, that those anyone who came into contact with the captain or anything that touched him was risking exposure. Stefen wouldn’t have wanted the staff taking that risk.
Stefen was sitting up in bed, Bucky sitting at his feet on the end of it. Both men had turned to look at him but it was Brother Filip sitting in the chair across from the fireplace wearing a smart suit, with his hair neatly combed and polished shoes that flabbergasted Tony.
“Oh. So that’s the way of it? I slave away making a perfectly good meal and he barely touches his plate, but when he decides he’s hungry I’m supposed to whip up whatever suits his fancy?” Willamina scowled dangerously and Ian quickly shook his head.
“My mother is on her way up from Villach. I stayed to see him through.”
“Now you” he called down, just as Steve was considering the small space and what his options truly were.
“Herr Bakhuizen, I’m surprised to see you here.”
"We've a lot of people to feed." Bruce replied simply, as if that explained everything. Though perhaps it did for Bruce, because a moment later the older monk had reached out to still Tony’s hand nervously tapping upon the table top (he had not even realized he was doing that, so caught up in his own thoughts) and shoved a blunt knife into his palm. Tony glared at the tarnished little knife and Bruce's mouth titled upward in a faint smile.
thought fourteen was nearly grown he was still a kid where it counted.
Their guests kept to themselves and didn't speak much unless prompted. When they did it was in a funny accent, though they spoke German well enough. Anya was weird. She had really big eyes and her thin face made them look even larger. She mostly let her brother do the talking but when she did talk it was to say strange things. The only time she seemed to really open up was during their music lessons, which made sense Péter guessed, if they were going to go on tour with Uncle Bucky.
In over a year and a half nothing Stefen had said or done (or not said and done for that matter) had shaken that confidence. Antony Stark however, was another matter entirely.
“His name is James. It’s where you got your name from. Didn’t you know?” Péter asked and James huffed.
“Go inside.” he instructed, low and firm. “Say
Gypsy. Tony's mind supplied over the fearful pounding of his heart as he reached the child who was banging her fisted hands against the floor and screaming at the top of her lungs.
But almost as soon as he’d thought it the stillness erupted as a set of doors burst open just up ahead and a woman with bright red hair in a sensible bun came charging into the room. Judging by her plain clothes and the set of keys clinking ominously at her waist this was the housekeeper. Only, Dvorak thought he’d seen less threatening expressions on seasoned generals as she intercepted them, asking quite plainly and forcefully who they were and why they were there.
More designs, this time concentrated on ships and naval weaponry. Long pages of notes on the construction of a battleship to be outfitted with some new type of torpedo that was giving them problems… Steve faltered. Wait a minute, these were notes, an engineer’s notes concerning ongoing work outfitting the German Navy!
As war looms, Captain Rogers is called away and Tony finds himself in the entirely unforeseeable predicament of raising seven children he didn't even have the pleasure of making. Okay, not
Tony swallowed and when Stefen’s eyes followed the movement his cock twitched with interest. For a split moment he entertained the thought of slipping Stefen’s fingers into his mouth, but however stirring a fantasy it was, he was keenly aware of both the fact that they were in public and that the captains seven-year-old boy was giggling gleefully at their silliness not even an inch away.
"He's the only one who can –" she began just as Baroness Schrader's voice began to drift up the stairs, calling the girls name, and she rushed to finish, “- fix vati. He’s the only one!”
“Péter,” Natacha reached one hand up to grasp a loose fold in Péter’s trousers. “It’s alright.”
Steve swung him up into his arms and leveled with Artur's very serious expression. His little body was warm against Steve's chilled skin and he shifted hoping the rough canvas of his uniform didn’t scratch Artur's newly clean skin. The thought of blundering around in the dark looking for whatever the hell a crustacean was after everything else that had happened that day seemed impossible. But Artur was so hopeful, blinking at him and wiggling in anticipation.
“If I give you five mark will you do something for me?”
Austria's Lake district is comprised of over 70 lakes and numerous cities and towns that border them including the city of Salzbug. In other words it's GORGEOUS and it should be a life goal to visit there. It's also where we've placed the Rogers family home.
Thunder rattled the walls once and the girl shrieked, clamping her hands against the side of her head, and Tony startled; but he rushed to reach her when she flung herself over the side of the bed writhing and kicking like something possessed, screaming intelligibly now in that foreign tongue.
Thanks." he muttered accepting the offering gratefully. He winced as he pried his numb fingers away from the steering wheel. The warmth of his breath stung the chilled flesh as he raised the bread to his lips, but he ignored the discomfort in favor of filling his belly. He'd been too anxious to eat that morning and he was regretting t now.
He was exhausted.
“Who is it?”
"Isn’t she wicked? Tony built her." Clint informed him proudly and Tony felt several pairs of eyes land on him at once in quiet speculation.
But somewhere between trading ruined clothes for nightshirts and tucking the children into bed, Steve’s skin prickled, the hair rising on the back of his neck with sudden realization. He couldn’t hear Tony. Virginia and Charlotte where there, Virginia stroking back James bangs and whispering to him softly as she tucked him in. Sara was sound asleep in Charlotte’s arms as she walked in between the makeshift beds, intent on finding an empty space for them. Maria was curled up with Artur, looking like a pair of conjoined twins.
“Have you met my children?” he rattled through their names one by one and then to Charlotte’s shock, instead of turning to her as was the only proper thing to do (she could understand falling second to his children after all) he turned to Herr Stark and said, “And this is Herr Stark. A good friend. Oh and of course, the lovely woman on my arm is Baroness Shrader.”
“You saw what they did!” Steve snapped, taking a lunging step forward when Tony would not let go. His face was close enough for Steve to see the lines of tension around his mouth, the steely determination that had replaced the fear that Steve couldn’t shake from his memory. He remembered the way Tony’s eyes had looked on the stairwell of that apartment, flinching away from every sound (flinching away from
Steve grasped her hand and she pulled him up and out of the crate he’d come to believe would be his coffin. He set his feet down on soft soil, covered in a thin layer of retreating show, the air crisp and cool around him. Behind them, down in the valley, the lights of Shillersee burned brightly in the windows of sleepy houses, and the lake stretched out like a soft velvet blanket.
A shiver went up Tony’s spine as his blood decided to set a southern course.
“He’s very ill and we haven’t a moment to lose. It’s best if you wait outside,” he instructed the baroness with a gentle but no less commanding hand upon her shoulder as Rogers finished his fit of coughing and slumped back onto the bed breathing heavily.
“We must round the children up, keep them together and keep them quiet” she said, pressing a long thin skeleton key into Tony’s palm and the monk nodded silently his agreement.
The thought alone was hopeless.
“And I trust you’ll look out for each other?”
Neither Artur nor any of the other children dared to answer. Everyone, including Rogers, was watching Tony like he’d just grown a second head and declared himself pope. Until over in Péter’s arms Sara, around gummy fingers once again stuck in her mouth, piped up with a solitary “No missing anybody!”
Tony jerked away from the stranger, returning his frown with a peeved expression of his own and continued on his way without so much as a word of remorse or thanks. It was rude of him. But if Tony were honest, he’d found something really unsettling about the gentlemen.
Steve’s mouth twitched, brow arching as if to ask why he had to be so dramatic and Bucky couldn’t help a huff of amusement.
Steve grabbed his shoulders and held him down to keep him from getting up further out of the chair, and running away, because that’s what Tony did. He never stopped moving, and when he was upset with you he just moved all the faster.
It was all he’d said, but it might as well have been his death sentence. Schmidts lips had twitched and he’d nodded his head slightly at one of the prison guards. Steve had been forced to the ground, face pushed into the dirt, a gloved hand around the back of his neck choking off his air. The men had ripped and pulled at him until he was naked, stinging and shivering where he lay on the ground. A plain shirt and trousers had been thrown at him and he was told to dress himself.
Our prayers have been answered. The Brothers are to be released into the hands of Cardinal Rossi. I am to journey with the brothers and the Cardinal to Engzall Abbey and then further onto Rome at the abbot’s request to give his report. I must admit the thought of standing before the cardinals makes me sick with nerves, but I am so grateful for the Mercy our Lord has shown the Brothers from Engzall that there is hardly room even for nerves. Arrangements are still being made, and these things take much time and paperwork as you know, so I will likely be here in Dachau for a few weeks longer. I will send word to you when I am to depart, and when I am home again at St. Péter’s.
“You fight for one emperor you fight for another.” Tony shrugged. He wouldn’t let on that Nik’s predictions unsettled him in any way. Who was Captain Rogers to him, accept another German? Austrian or German it was all the same since Anschluss. And Rogers whether he was a saint or a sinner was one man in a world gone to the dogs and he’d undoubtedly do what all the rest were doing.  Click his heels and fall into line like a good German boy; meanwhile Tony would bend his knees and say his prayers like a good German monk and if the S.S. ever came knocking he’d wave the expensively purchased papers that declared his greatest fault was a hopelessly Italian mother, but not a drop of Jewish blood.
“This lovely creature at my side is my wife, Siv. She does me great honor by ignoring a multitude of faults and continues to gift me with her adoration.”
“Let me worry about my investments Kirk. Tell me about Stark. How did you meet? What was he like?”
“No no, don’t bother. He looks busy and it’s not all that pressing. I’d never even heard of it before yesterday.”
Since studying animals was just about Artur’s most favorite thing in the world, second only to eating sugary confections, Tony wasn’t surprised a bit at the near feral gleam of anticipation that lit in his eyes, the boy practically shaking with excitement.
He heard movement at the other end of the hall and shifted his glance just in time to catch Charlotte’s lady’s maid watching him. Caught the woman sniffed loudly, as if she’d caught a bad smell in her nose and turned away, disappearing into Charlottes room.
It was silent for a time while Tony ate his sandwich and Ian resolutely refused to acknowledge the issue of James as he leaned against Tony’s chair and watched him eat with all the scrutiny of a nurse at patient’s bedside.
“I don’t know why that horrible woman always thinks she can cheat me. I can spot the handiwork of a machine a mile away.” She grumbled as they trudged through the crowds with their many boxes and bags towards the automobile where Harold waited, lace placemarks acquired on discount.
Natacha had buried her head into her knees, shaking it slowly. Tony had thought that the firelight looked pretty dancing against her red hair and mused with a heartache he kept all to himself that Stefen would have thought the moment worthy of a painting. Natacha, sitting with her knees curled up, Péter with his arm slung around her. Angular bodies caught in tandem in that vast valley between child and adult, finding their own kind of poetic symmetry together not explained by anything rational.
He felt stab of pity, reminded once again of the children’s isolation. Why a trip into town was proving an absolute marvel for the little ones, as if they’d never been. From all that Tony had heard about Péter's illness and how it had kept him from public school he wouldn’t have been surprised if Péter had not been outside the grounds of his home all year. In a way, he was almost as cut off as Tony had been at the monastery.
“Go on with Péter. I’ll be back.”
“Stark! Can I have a word please?” Stefen growled intending to put a stop to the whole affair but he halted when he felt a tug on his hand. He looked down, startled to find Artur standing beside him.
“Artur!” Tony let the boy drop onto the grass with a heave and a thud, gasping for breath and trying to blink the spots from his eyes. He couldn’t panic. He wasn’t a scared boy in the woods anymore. Yinsen wasn’t here. Yinsen didn’t need him anymore because Yinsen was dead. These children needed him.
“Certainly, Herr Stark will like it.”
It was probably for the best that Tony didn’t drink anyway. Stanislov was dangerous, and Tony needed all his wits to handle him.
“That’s fighting dirty.” Péter remarked with an air of accusation from the sidelines, but Steve let it go, chuckling as he wiped the sweat from his brow.
Stark eyed him, his eyes roving, searching Steve's face for something. Steve stood still and let him, his body practically humming under the scrutiny. After a moment Stark seemed to find what he was looking for and nodded.
“Ah Péter it’s alright. Your dad he’s just… he’s just trying to protect you. He sees these skinny arms and thinks ‘my baby, a soldier?’ No way!” Harry shook one of the skinny arms in question and Péter reluctantly smiled, a chuckle bubbling out of him. “But we are men now, and the Reichland needs us. We are her sons and if we won’t fight for her honor, who will?”
“Well, consider yourself lucky Herr Stark. They put a headless chicken in the bed of the previous governess.”
“Of course, it’s just chemistry. Mind you, we should have someone experienced show us the ropes so we don’t damage your film.” Tony mused. “The news office will have a dark room. Fancy another trip into town?” He asked, and Péter’s face lit up as he laughed and shot up from his chair.
Against gritted teeth he added, trying to smooth his voice, “Peter still has trouble with his heart. It’s easily overlooked when he’s so energetic but it’s a fact that I cannot forget easily, seeing as I’m his father and all. The school in Geneva is better suited to Peter. It'll help him become everything he needs to be to better himself, better his people. It’s a better match than officers school. I weighed the options carefully General. Don't think I didn't. Or that I'll be swayed.”
Of course he’d felt envious at times, but they were shallow and fleeting moments. Steve’s fair face and golden head was not all blessing. Bucky’s mother had called it the curse of halves, always being a part of something but never whole. Over the years Bucky had witnessed firsthand the pain Stefen had endured, torn between his two parts. Everybody had their curses to bear.
More simply put, he did not see the point in starving ones self to receive words, boons, or earn mercy from a god who was not there.  And yet, here he was.
After a moment a look of determination settled over him and quite decisively he looked back at Tony and announced, "I am going to get him a horse for his birthday. It was awfully far to walk."
“And what games would those be?”
He'd be better next time. Braver, so Da wouldn't have to worry about them so much.
Well not that unfathomable, obviously. Clearly not as he stooped in a cramped toilet with his hand around his cock, remembering the things he’d asked for in the dream. Begged for.
“What’s the delay here?” Tony demanded as he ran up, huffing for breath and trying to look suitably terrified and indignant.
It didn't take a genius to see how two boys largely left to their own devices in this big cold world had forged such a strong bond. They'd been forged together,
"Susann has the means to get herself and Frank to London. The borders aren't closed and there's no warrant out for her arrest."
“Group Captain Carol D’Anvers. Sorry for the dog and pony show but the mail wasn’t secure and we figured giving you my alias was safer,” she explained, fighting to be heard over the rumble of the engine. “Oh, and I have some rations there in the box under the seat.  Sorry it’s not much.”
“The boy went to the dragon’s parents and told them that he knew where their son was, but he would not tell them until they give him the magic stone. The dragons screamed and threatened him, spewing great columns of fire, but the boy kept silent. Finally, the father dragon agreed and gave him the magic stone he kept under his tongue.
Dvorak stared at her for a moment, replaying her words over in his mind. Rogers wasn’t allergic to morphine. But only someone who had served with him or someone who had looked at his medical file would know that with certainty, and it was increasingly apparent that Fischer had done neither.
“Alone?” Tony questioned, and Charlotte shook her head.
“The Captain did not order this.” Tony reminded her, because if she knew Stefen even a little bit she had to know how he was going to react when he saw this. “You had no right to do this!”
War was a bloody business, and businessmen didn’t let go of valuable assets because fair play said they should. Sure, Tony had spent the majority of his life in a monastery, but he was trained by the sharpest businessman in the world. Hughard Stark had nothing on Niklas Farkas, and Tony had a plan that didn’t even rely on him calling in the one-eyed bastard; but first they had to survive the mission and make it back to English shores, and before even that, they had to get out of Pola with Stanislov none the wiser.
"Tony Stark, is he here?!" Steve demanded to know.
~~*~*~*~~~
“Since yesterday. I think. I got a good score on my test because I practice. That’s why I need to find the crustaceans. I need to study them and Mon Amie needs a friend. He’s all alone when I’m exploring. May we please, vati? I've never held one.” he asked Steve shyly looking up at him from under his lashes.
Because thinking of home was too painful. He’d made his peace with it, shut the door on anything else aside from working to free Austria with the resistance. But now there were all these things he couldn’t stop thinking about. His children. All the things he would miss. Tony and the way he tasted.
“Perhaps not, but Péter could do a better job.” Steve pointed out, his mouth tightening with displeasure. Tony released his arm for decency’s sake and Steve ignored how cold the limb felt for his absence. Péter never should have allowed the others to go to the woods in the first place, let alone lose track of his sister. “Don’t give me that look Tony, he’s a man now. He needs to take responsibility.” Steve would make sure he understood what that meant. No more games.
Tony snorted, shaking his head and waited for Péter to go on.
If Tony had stopped over the last few days to consider what he was undertaking cycling into town with seven children he might have reconsidered, but hindsight was twenty twenty. The children were lined in a row, the bicycles that Tony had fixed up for them gleaming in the sunlight with new life. By some miracle he’d managed to get each of them into the play clothes he’d painstakingly stitched for them, though Natacha had been anything but happy about it. After all it wasn’t the smart blue skirt and crisp white blouse he’d caught Pepper helping size that morning.
“I’ll go. Please. They’ll never have to know I was here.”  he croaked, wincing at the returning tickle and the threat of another coughing fit.
“You remember Joseph Aust?” he asked and Bucky nodded, frowning thoughtfully.
The lad who had kicked him caught his eye and then jerked his head toward the structure they’d pulled up beside. Bucky did not think he had seen a sight as welcome as the Rogers family villa in a long while. He moved to get up and groaned at the dull fiery ache that spread up from his injured arm, deciding to give it a moment more for his flesh to warm up. God damn but it was cold.
Artur’s face fell in disappointment and Tony was grateful when Cameron, finished with James suitcase stood to his full height and ran a hand through his hair with a bashful smile in Artur’s direction and thanked him for the thought.
“I was there, I ate and drank with them, so I know it to be true.” Stefen murmured the words so quietly that Tony doubted anyone but himself and Bakhuizen could have heard him. He frowned, wanting to insist that a story fanciful enough to include dragons could not possibly be true, but he bit his tongue.
-The Farm-
Charlotte waved the words away with a light laugh.
Steve swallowed thickly. The ever present urge to find one of his children and... He wasn't sure what he wanted to do, actually. Hold them? Stand by them? Margret had always been so much better with them, had a gentle way of showing Steve how to hold their little bodies or what story was best before bed. The feeling of failure where they were concerned had become a familiar ache.
He always did.
Coming up: In Nice, Steve and Tony meet up with Carol D'Anvers of the "Baker Street Irregulars" who drops a bombshell. The Germans plan to move on Norway earlier than anyone thought. Will Steve make it in time to save Prince Thor? What happens to the children now?!
Long after Stefen’s heart had slowed against his ear and Tony’s was marching steadily alongside it he felt the captain’s fingers thread into the hair at the nape of his neck and in a very calm and quiet voice he finally broke the silence that had been hanging between them for days.
He grit his teeth, trying not to let the thought bother him. He was so tired of trying to figure out what to do in order to make his father happy. He said he wanted them to study and take advantage of their education but hated it that Péter was ‘too smart’. He said he loved them but Tony always had to bug him to spend time with them. He hated the Nazis and the things they stood for and yet he wore their uniform and one day soon they were’ going to call him and he’d go and fight for them.
"Yes Baroness?" the maid panted as she rounded the corner at a near run, eyes darting franticly between Frau Hogan and her mistress as if she expected to catch the woman trying to strangle Charlotte with her bare hands. Charlotte's mouth tilted toward a smile. She'd miss Milthede most of all when she was gone.
She’s got a chance to go back home. She’s young and pretty. She could maybe find some fellow willing to overlook the fact that she married outside of her own people the first go around, sit pretty and maybe once a year think back and wonder what might have become of Naomi; but instead she sticks by her, journeys into the mouth of the unknown just so they can be together. She had faith that whatever life they built together no matter how poor would be better than any she could find on her own if she turned her back and walked away from what was right. She must have found who she wanted to be in Naomi’s family… I’m envious Péter. I’d like to be so certain. Wouldn’t you?”
The dream of stopping this war before it began, and going home to his family, it was over. Just like Clinton had said.
Steve drew to stop just outside the open doors of the music room but not because of Bucky’s warning.
Even eating with the children had grown into an exercise, a drill of sorts. After Peggy had died Steve had forced himself to eat. He'd mechanically lifted fork to mouth, rarely ever tasting the food and somehow it had become a regular thing. He was so very aware he was alone when he sat down. He'd look over the expanse of table and at the other end would be a void, a space left and never filled. Steve had always been keen on seeing yourself for who you were if you could help it but the empty spaces left by his wife proved overwhelming at times.
since when was Stark, Antony, to her? He was so taken aback by the woman’s slip he almost missed her last words. When they sank in a feeling like rage lit within his belly and he did nothing to mask it. To her credit Virginia did not flinch from his obvious fury. “- But he did ask for my permission Captain and I gave it.”
He couldn't help himself. He was so out of sorts. What was wrong with him? It was just a boat ride and yet he felt too large for the vessel, swollen and stiff.
Rarely did Steve have to compete for tallest in the room. The prince however stood at least a head taller than most of the guests. Thorson Axel of house Odinburg was a beast of a man, his form suited for battle rather than the refined life of a prince. His midnight blue uniform stood out in sharp relief next to the gray, black and lighter blue of the German officers.
He’d had a fair point. So why did he feel suddenly like a terrible bully? Maria’s trembling lip and downcast gaze as she slunk from the room was like a punch to the gut, and Tony flushed with shame.
Natacha started speaking more after that, perhaps deciding that there was wisdom in allowing her younger siblings to believe there was still a chance their father lived. Tony didn’t think there was much chance of convincing practical Natacha to put her heart in that belief, but he was grateful nonetheless to hear the return of her voice, and on one memorable occasion to see the return of her smile.
The jacket and the scarf made her fairly indistinguishable and a woman with an escort was less likely to be stopped. Clever, the part of him he wished would take control acknowledged. But the part that saw only the practicalities of the mission and appreciated effective strategy was overcome by a creature of raw emotions. Rage. Fear. Horror. It all churned inside him, the emotions reverbing in on themselves with such speed that they created force, a ballooning pressure within his chest that he was sure would explode.
“He’s a soldier,” Tony supplied pointedly and Nik immediately parried with,
“They’ve shown great improvement.” Stefen answered tonelessly and Schmidt’s face spread into a humorless smile.
But the ceiling above him began to adjust itself, his eyes diligently refocusing until the room around him became solid and the rocking stilled as if it had never been, revealing the sharp square features of the operation theater.
When he got like that sometimes he even called her Peggy. Natacha didn’t mind.
Tony recalled Bucky’s odd behavior at dinner with sad realization. He was sure that was what he’d witnessed, Bucky had been leaving food out for the dead. Tony didn’t have overly warm memories of boyhood Christmases. Hughard had always been busy and Christmas was no exception, and his mother was always melancholy from missing her family. He’d resented them for that as a child. For not being able to put themselves aside and making Christmas as joyous as everyone else claimed it could be. He was ashamed of that now.
Stefen shook his head.
Steve shook his head, frustration pooling in his gut again.
Tony highly suspected that Stefen was asking out of politeness, because his tone definitely brooked no room for argument. Shooting was to be a regular part of their lives, because the captain would have it so.
“Dr. Leshnerr and Dr. Richter are good men.” Bruce explained simply and some of the tension in Tony’s shoulders eased. They had everyone they needed. All they were waiting for was -
“It is no wonder the man drinks,” he murmured and Tony could not tell whether she halted so quickly because they’d reach the door of the room that was apparently to be his or because of his assumption but she turned to him with an arched brow and an expression of polite inquiry that did nothing to belay the underlining command in her tone as she asked him who he meant. Since his foot was already in it Tony decided on the direct approach. Frau Hogan had responded to it well thus far
He’d gone to the automobile first, because it would have been rude to ignore a lady, the black surface winking at him as he'd run a hand over her hood, imagining it to still be warm with life. He could fix this, a broken belt, perhaps a new engine. All in do time, all a matter of the right tools and the right hands and she would be restored. The car was fixable, like so little else.
“Tony?”
If any song is the "title track" of this story it's this one, and as Tony and his new family say goodbye to the happy days of summer and step into a much darker phase of their journey, we'd like to introduce it to you. So, you might be wondering. Out of all the music out there why did we choose a song released in the 1990's as our story's signature piece?
It had never made any sense to Steve why a woman like Susann would saddle herself with a man even less romantic than him, but love was funny like that he guessed.
“Yes, Sub-prior of course. Brother Aldrich was supposed to see to it, but Brother Antony insisted that you had instructed that he take over, only he has been nowhere to be found all day.” Nik closed his eyes, imagining himself far away from the monastery and upon the waves of the deep blue sea surrounding his home land, and not having to deal with a problem like Antony Stark. He'd loved the ocean as a boy, and even now as a man it was still his preferred place of refuge. Antony would have had something fresh to say about that no doubt, he did so like to liken Nik to a pirate.
"That's a very considerate present Artur,” he acknowledged instead with a serious nod. He was sure there was mirth dancing about in his eyes but Artur didn’t seem to mind it as he beamed back at Tony.
Hammer’s face barely changed but Steve could still sense the quiet irritation coming from his butler. Herr Hammer turned and jerked his head at Sam.
Time would certainly tell them all if they were strong enough to weather it.
“Péter your Da said he’d talk it over with Herr Stark and he will.” Bucky reminded him, but Péter didn’t seem to be in the mood for it.
Ian thought she was called Rita, and her friend was called Elizabeth like the queen. Or maybe it was the other way around. He should have paid more attention. Natacha probably knew which of them was which.
And when one was minding seven children of various ages already, it didn't leave a lot of time between demands. Tony had left the boys too long unattended it seemed because at just that moment a thump came from overhead, startling those gathered below as their eyes flew upward, drawn to the sound of heavy footsteps and raised voices.
“Just stay calm,” Stefen said for what must have been the eleventh time. Péter lowered the rifle to glare at his father.
“The one on the floor is the ugliest.” One of the officers smirked from the end of the table, because dinner and a show never went out of style, but he sobered up and quickly went back to his meal at the sight of the baleful glare their lieutenant gave him and his comrade.
He did raise an eyebrow as Tony knocked back his drink with all the hasty professionalism of a practiced drinker.
“I’m here.” He said once more aloud, “what were you saying?”
Unconsciously Steve’s hands curled into fists on his lap. He only realized when he felt the sting of his nails digging into the flesh of his palm. He unclenched them carefully with a slow exhale. He couldn’t think about that. He and Tony had made their choices, the best ones they could make. Right now, the children were his priority.
"Better to die chased down by the SS?" Tony scoffed.
They’d never been raised to trust people easily, not when any Roma man could be killed or mistreated with next to no consequences. It didn't really lend a hand to believing in the best of people, but somehow Steve had always found that easy.
"Baroness Schrader, we have to go back." A voice suddenly piped up from the back, drawing Deiter's attention. He glanced in the rearview and saw that the speaker was the quiet boy. Ian.
He didn’t know how many times he shoved against the door until it popped open, just that he barely managing to keep from tumbling inside the darkened room beyond it face first. He caught himself, clinging to the side of the door to keep from sliding to the floor, panting for breath as his vision swam before his eyes. Furiously he blinked them clear, glancing hungerly around the room.
“Really?” James gapped. “How do you know?” and Stefen answered with a somewhat bashful shrug.
So that was how Tony wanted this to go. Steve clenched his jaw.
"Shh. Shhh now. It'll be alright. Stay with Tony. Do exactly as he says. All of you." Stefen looked up and over his shoulder to where Péter and the others had collected in a huddle. Péter had his arms wrapped around James and Ian who were both leaning on him as if the earth had buckled beneath their feet. Natacha held the younger girls as they cried, her eyes horribly blank as she watched her father deposit her crying brother into Tony's arms.
“You want to visit a steel merchant.” The captain reiterated, and Tony nodded.
The children attacked the racks with relish, and Steve tried to keep an eye on their progress while sneaking furtive glances at the counter where Susann was whispering with Frau Neumann, thankful that Tony was there to make sure they didn’t destroy any of Susann’s merchandise.
injured or otherwise, weren’t the priority anymore. Steve watched the clock and the trickle of activity on the floor below. From the rail, Steve had a good view of the main hall, including the doors that lead out to the receiving platform.
uniform with her painfully white blouse. Her black neckerchief was tied precisely under her neck and her red hair was perfectly pleated to form a crown around her head. And my, did she not look every inch the queen at court, poised to pass judgment on them all.
“Tony,” Stefen’s voice was quiet but it was enough to halt Tony’s verbal diarrhea in its tracks. He glanced anxiously in the captain’s direction, relieved when he saw that he didn’t appear to be angry. If anything there was almost something fond about the small smile tugging at his lips.
cleaning up blood and sick. He and all the other good Austrians should be made to line the walls with their own insides. How
Steve glanced out the window once more, at the German Chancellery rising high above the rest. It was empty now, save for a small guard of only eighteen S.S. soldiers. The bulk of Hitler’s elite fighting force was on the Czechoslovakian border, which was the entire reason for his absence from Berlin.
“With the lessons I have planned I think they very much do.”
Thankfully he’d paused to yank off his shoes and socks before he plowed into the water, but the dark blue of his trousers had gone black in the water and Tony prayed his stitching would hold.
Tony slowed the car into the driveway and glanced behind him again just to make sure he wasn't being followed. He hadn't counted on how exposed he’d feel at the Library of Records in Salzburg.
“I see that in you," he said earnestly " Every day. You're going to do great things and I- The work you’ve done with Tony is… Péter, you gotta know how proud I am of you."
"It's nearly finished. Captain Adventure has just agreed to rescue little Kurt from Dr. Doom. His mother is very appreciative."
Someone chuckled, the sound low and full of promise. It sounded like Tony. But when Steve opened his eyes of course Tony was not there. He was still alone in the room with Khalmmer.
Harold snorted as he set Steve’s trunks down, and Steve rolled his eyes to the ceiling.
In the photos he’d perused on the desk the young Captain Rogers hadn't quite managed the same emotionless gaze as the rest of his company, but he was doing a first rate job of it now.  It must have come with age.
Christ. Tony expelled his breath in a rush, eyes flying open. He could feel tears leaking out of their corners but he didn’t mind them. Couldn’t have stopped them even if he had.
“Yes.”
“Virginia?” He snapped, worry tightening his gut once more, his hand itching to reach for the pistol tucked into his jacket.
The conductor had offered to take his things when he boarded but Tony had waived him off. He just had the one trunk and saw no need to store it in the luggage van when the journey would be no more than a few hours.
“You sad?”
“They left with Harold this morning, on their way to Voggenberg.”
Tony could feel eyes on him, and he wasn't all that surprised to look up and discover that Stefen was watching him.  Natacha was still enjoying the dance but Stefen had gone still, his gaze narrowing on Tony with concern that made a spark of anger ignite within his chest. Tony raised his cup to him with a bitter smile and downed the rest of it, before he turned to Hortense. He didn't bother looking back at Stefen as he grabbed the girl by the hand and tugged her away from the drink station.
It was there. It was all there. Journal entries with notes, numbers, dates and maps. Lists of resources, names of men, and horrifically detailed plans for their movement in a full-scale invasion of Europe, and then the east and west. It was staggering to take in. To see written out so barely the scope of Hitler’s hubris and his hunger for power.
A half hour or so into the ride Péter asked the boy sitting across from him where they were being taken and the boy, who said his name was Daniel, told them that the train was taking them to a boat on the coast.
Tony had gone from Pavlok’s office directly to the telephone booth across the street; but had made the decision to make the call from the house instead at the last moment.
It took them some time, with seven children in tow to choose the perfect tree. And it was something of an ordeal bringing it down. Tony's idea to use the sacks to help drag the tree turned out to be brilliant and allowed all of the children to help out, but that’s just what Bucky got for trying to argue with him over matters of engineering. They’d managed to get the humongous thing back to the house in relatively one piece and installed in the family sitting room without too much mishap.  Stefen went outside to fetch the carp that Harold had caught the day before and left chilling next to the back door. While the children scarfed down the lunch Willamina had left for them, the adults all rolled up their sleeves and began to prepare that night’s dinner.
“Charlotte!” He wheezed, thumping his curled hand against the bed. “This is a mistake!”
“Sit down!” Steve bit out, anger turning his words sharp and the table froze.
Tony turned his head and rested his lips against the side of Stefen’s neck, the arm he had wrapped around Stefen’s chest tightening and drawing back so they were flush back to chest. Stefen breathed better when he was closer to upright and Tony breathed better when Stefen was breathing.
Ian wouldn’t have to do anything with Gisela Keats, besides race her to the sweets trolley after training and it would all just be fine.
But just in case, he stooped down to have a look under the furniture, searching for false bottoms, and even took up the couch cushions searching for rips and tears where things might have been stuffed.
“That’s exactly what they’ll do.” That was the show. They’d pass them out to members of their party. People who would make sure they learned their lines, said all the right things, stamped all the rebellion out of them.
Clapping his hands together smartly Tony pushed himself up and climbed off the bed with renewed purpose.
Tony stared at the man for a long moment, but when Stefen just stared back, non-pulsed he set his cup down decidedly and rose from his chair. He sat himself on Stefen’s lap, his mouth curling into a smile at the way Stefen’s pupils widened and he seemed to hold his breath before Tony claimed his lips in a slow and
“Novice actually,” Clinton mumbled, shoving more cake in his mouth but Natacha was looking down, quite focused on pouring coffee for everyone. Tony narrowed his eyes at Clinton in warning.
“Might be something fell against it. A roof beam maybe.”
Tony hadn’t told Stefen what he’d seen. He might have, had things carried on and Stefen not come to his senses about sending Péter away, but as it stood Tony saw no reason to cause an undo uproar that would only upset the household and damage the tender understanding Stefen and the boy had reached. Then again, he thought snidely, maybe Tony was just all too good at keeping secrets and there was nothing altruistic about it.
Ian rolled his eyes, but that amused little smile still didn’t go anywhere.
“Is she… I mean will she be alright?” Stefen asked in a hushed tone, tense as if he feared the girl might explode and Tony rolled his eyes.
“They want me and the children to dance like monkeys, distracting the Führer’s audience from the trick happening right before their eyes.” Stefen grit out bitterly and Tony stroked his fingers gently over his collar bone in a silent bid to soothe.
“I heated water.” She murmured, guiding Tony toward where she’d set up the designated washing tub. Tony was grateful to see steam rising out of it and made quick work of stripping James out of his wet clothes and lowering the boy into the tub. It was just big enough for him to sit, mostly covered with the water just above his knees.
“We can’t swim in our clothes, so how do you suggest we go about this?” Tony was asking.
Tony’s mind raced. Dachau? The name tickled at his memory and it was a moment before even his powerful mind could dig it up out of the millions of bits of stored data. They’d built a prison in Dachau for all of Hitler’s enemies. When the church in Innsbruck had been raided they’d taken the men they’d arrested there, Tony remembered. The brothers at St. Péter’s had whispered about nothing else for weeks.
“This is our home, bambino. Where do you go but home?”
"Until they are done with school?" Tony pressed and Stefen pulled him closer by the hand, until they were toe to toe and he could settle a hand on Tony’s hip, as if they might start a dance.
While Nigel was distracted gushing at Tony Steve made good his escape, nodding apologetically to both as he hastily murmured, "If you’ll excuse me? I’m being called."
, let go.” Uncle Bucky tried to move and James wailed. No! Don’t let go. Don’t let go. As long as he didn’t let go of Bucky things would be alright.
They did finally reach the station, and it was the clogged-up mess people had begun to expect since the Germans had begun enforcing their "Jews Out" policy in earnest. Everybody trying to get out before they were forced into the ghettos and nobody on the outside willing or wanting to take them.
“The coldest.” Tony agreed with a warm laugh, reaching up to squeeze Steve’s wrist. His expression sobered as he spoke Steve’s name softly and Steve’s gut twisted, afraid that he might be having second thoughts about what they’d done.
“Are you looking for Stefen?” she finally asked. “I’m afraid he's overtaxed himself tonight and wishes to stay with the children. They’re in the music room if you’re looking.” She gestured over her shoulder, where the music was coming from. Indeed, Stefen was in the music room. The whole family was there, winding down in the wilting hour at their leisure.  Stefen sat on the piano bench next to Stark, facing out toward the children. He leaned up against Stark’s shoulder, seemingly unbothered by the occasional jostle he received as Stark expertly played for his small audience. Bucky couldn't see from this distance, but Stefen’s relaxed posture, his head tilted just slightly back, suggested his eyes might be closed.
“Yes… you know how he and Harry are. Péter only has a few days left at home. He’d want to see Harry as much as he can.”
“On the house, Captain,” the host said with a wink. “It’s good to have you back.”
“I’ll be back as soon as I can.” He promised, and when he turned to go this time she didn’t try to stop him. It would have been silly to try and Natacha Rogers was not a silly girl.
“No, Nonna, I’m safe. He wouldn't...” He let out a rush of air. Anxiety and defensiveness building in his chest and said slowly. “He wouldn't do anything to hurt me.”
As his back sank into the mattress Stefen’s hand was there behind his head, and then his larger body was covering Tony’s, heat and firm muscle pressing against every inch of him and Tony sucked in a breath in one violent gulp, like a drowning man coming up for air. It was only some buried instinct for self-preservation that had him biting his lip to stave off further sound as Stefen’s hips moved against his. His mouth roved over the chords of muscle in Tony’s throat, wet suction against the sensitive skin there and Tony shuddered, fingers sinking into the flesh of Stefen’s back, and reveled in the low hiss of breath Stefen released.
"Last I heard, a town up north near Vienna."
“Nonsense, your father doesn't want to sit around being useless-” Bucky began to interject and Steve barked.
Heart thumping fiercely within his chest Tony took out another, spell bound by them in a way he could barely explain even to himself. And then it happened.
Just when he thought he’d managed the impossible and shut the man up, Stark took a breath and turned to Péter.
Frauline Werner had been so pleased to learn that Father had been invited along with the Baroness. She had prepared Natacha in advance, urging her to memorize the heads of the four other families as well as their wives and children.
The weasel twisted his lips, sighing, as if the whole endeavor had cost him. His eyes flickered over Tony's frame as one might flit fingers over a dirty rag and Tony might have felt intimidated, if the man where in any way intimidating. Even in his shabby suit and third hand shoes that looked even worse for wear next to the weasels three piece uniform, pressed slacks and pristinely slicked hair, Tony couldn’t help but feel bored by the man’s pretension. The man was impeccably dressed for a servant. People like him, in Tony's experience, we're so consumed with self that they failed to see what was right in front of them.
“What do you mean?!” Steve snapped once more. “What has he done?” Had he hurt one of the children? Steve found it harder to believe than he’d have imagined weeks ago. Stark’s letters kept playing through his head, his obvious fondness for each child leaking through every word.
“Then perhaps you think I’m a child?” he snapped in reply, finally finding whatever it was in his trunks he was looking for and closing it with a snap. As he came forward Steve saw he had an old journal in hand. The same one Steve often saw him scribbling in at home.
Outside the gate, Bucky was standing near the open door of the truck staring up at where smoke was rising above the prison walls.
“What happened to waiting for Stark to be out of the line of fire?” he asked, and from the dirt Stark looked up, glaring accusingly at him with bleary eyes. Bucky shrugged.
“I always thought his mother gave birth to him with uniform on and everything.” Johan’s added timidly, and the dam broke. The group of soldiers laughed loudly under the lanterns of Hugel street, inhaling the crisp night air and for one moment at least, ignoring the fear they carried.
That was unfortunate because they were headed to another big boat, Steve thought and Bucky laughed and laughed.
Tony froze up, wanting to tell her that it was over and that everything would be fine now, but he knew better. They all did! Why were they all ignoring the obvious? Hitler would never be satisfied with this small slice of Czechoslovakia. He’d said as much in all his grand speeches about Germans inheriting the earth. What did people think was going to happen here?!
"But where are you going?" The baroness asked not for the first time. Natacha could tell that Charlotte was close to panic, even though she kept her volume low and her tone controlled. It was in the tight way she kept her shoulders, and the nervous clenching of her hands - as if she had to keep fighting the urge to grab Father as he whirled around the guest room, throwing pieces of his uniform around haphazardly as he traded them for travel clothes.
“Am I to understand that you nearly killed your sister over a frog!” Tony glared down at Artur, and he had to struggle not to shout or reach down and start shaking him. And Tony could only watch as the boy’s face twisted up once more, this time in anguish as he crumpled once more into heartbroken tears.
~*~*~
“Jessika is a strong woman. She’ll take care of herself and Danijella. She knows her own mind Buck.” the captain replied and something clattered on the table.
Bucky barked a humorless laugh. Little shit was right though wasn’t he? Nothing about this felt right and no amount of gabbing was going to change that. Fuck.
“What about Italian?” Tony offered, pausing only to roll his eyes right back at Natacha before continuing.  “All the greatest music is in Italian Maria and you’ll want to know how to read it yes?
More footsteps now, closer this time, and Steve heard. Patroche began to pace, grunting anxiously.
Steve went cold at the words, turning sharply and to take a lurching step toward the man.
“Alright tell me what you need.” Bucky commanded, waving for the bands attention. “And quit with the Bakhuizen shit. It’s Bucky, or James if you have to.”
Tony shook his head, trying to rid himself of the ringing in his ears. The goblin of a butler only smiled and waited.
Steve winced as Tony hit a sour note, the muscles in his back inching back toward rim rod straight.
He squeezed his eyes shut.
"Oh fucking hell-" Bucky groaned, because he was doing it. Steve was digging his heels in and refusing to hear any sense but his own. Over
There was another crash, followed by a surge of cheers from the mob. A wave of boys in brown shirts swinging batons, grimy faces distorted in the light, poured out from the apartment building like a plague of locusts to surround them.
“What about Beutlin?” Stefen suggested abruptly, the spark of inspiration leaping into his eye. Tony didn’t know who that was, though it didn’t take more than a moment's thought to recall that he’d definitely seen a Beutlin on the list of names written in the little book Stefen kept locked away in his study.
Hammer’s face went red, his smile fixed and fake as he rounded on the housekeeper. “Now, Frau Hogan-” but the woman was having none of it.
The days were moving by too quickly. Stefen’s mornings filled with meetings and paperwork as the army mobilized itself and prepared to take its first steps into what inevitably would become a war for the world (for life as they knew it).
“I hear you say something like that again I’ll smack you. Understand me čhavo?” Bucky growled at him. “Damn it, Péter you don’t know the first thing about what he’s sacrificed for you, so that you don’t grow up like we did.”
Bucky’s da had the most animals of anyone in the famila, and Steve recalled long summer days in the fields with Bucky, chewing on breadsticks and making up games that only they knew the rules to. Bucky’s favorite game was to imagine the kind of bride his father’s goats would pay for him, and what traits could be traded for what price. Was it two goats and a chicken enough for someone curvy and slender? Perhaps a finely crafted pot thrown in if she had a sense of humor.
“So you said.”
When had she learned to dip her bread? It was a habit Steve himself had had to break long before she was born. Good table manners helped make the difference from one class to the next and, in his opinion, was one of the only differences.
Steve had never been more serious about anything else in his life. He couldn’t give Charlotte or Tony what either of them deserved, and he couldn’t give his children all that he ached to but he could give them all this. Safety and a home where they could be together. He could give them this one small gift.
“Was there anything else, Captain?” Stark’s voice brought him back and Steve grit his teeth before turning to face the man again.
That practice had served him well after the Great War, through the Austrian Civil war that had followed, and on past losing his wife.
“It's about time.” Bucky drawled “Charlotte's only been throwing herself at you for months. Well as much as woman like that ever does. When-”
The woman would talk to the goat when she came to feed them. Quiet affectionate babble while she rubbed its head and neck. Sometimes she even spoke to Steve the same way, eyeing him as if he were as unruly as her pet and too pitiful to lift the cool cup of water to his lips, all the while admonishing him for whatever foolish and cowardly actions had led to imprisonment and near death. She didn’t seem to desire or expect an answer from him, which suited them both. She seemed like a good woman, and he was glad not to have her blood on his hands, but she was still an enemy. A wall standing between him and those he loved.
“He’s not with Harry. He’s with the Klein boys.”
“Flatterer. Ah, Christ!” Jann cursed, and Bucky winced as the last of the bandages peeled away, sticking to the seeping wound in her side.
“No, I want to learn singing. In Italian, please.”
“Harry's going to stay in Salzburg instead of going to the school in Vienna,” Péter continued on when the silence dragged too long and Steve arched his brow in surprise. “Frau Osborn is very worried about the amount of laborers they've had to replace. She wants Harry to come and work the business instead of spending so much time in the HJ. She doesn't want him to be a soldier.”
When the morning of the twenty third arrived, Tony rose from his bed early, barely having slept and crept up to the attic to run one more test.
“We will do no such thing!” Countess Schrader exclaimed with afront and Tony tensed. As much as he loathed the thought of Stefen marrying Charlotte, or anyone else for that matter, he knew what was at risk if he didn’t.
“That mouth of yours is going to get you arrested Stark.” He warned darkly before sighing and folding the paper to toss aside as if he couldn’t stand the sight of it any longer. “They’re tightening the curfew again. No one out after dark without stamped papers. Apparently, the revolutionaries struck again last night and pose a public danger.”
But it wasn’t the only thing he could do. He could run, as Tony and Bucky were always urging him to do. He could lay down his weapon, his pride, and forsake his duty, and simply walk away from it all.
"As wonderful as the Ardagger Priory is they are in fact not serving food at this hour and even if they were, I'm not in need of it." Tony wrenched the door back, perhaps harder than he had meant too. Beetle eyes glared, the butler's face turning a very unbecoming shade of violet.
“I’ve got conditions” Farkas finally said, and that didn’t surprise Tony in the least.
Tony finished with a shrug, as if the admission didn’t hurt, as if there was no old wound in danger of seeping with every poke and prod. He bit his lip, fingers clenching around the pen, wondering why he’d even brought it up in the first place. What possessed him to tell Stefen something like that?
The man’s smile didn't reach his eyes as he tapped Steve’s arm with the cool edge of the glass. Steve could feel the coolness seeping through his uniform like a phantom touch.
Tires. Windows. The plates above their gas tanks. Anything that would slow them down and give Steve time to get away. The men had stopped, their focus on Dvorak and protecting their general, but even from here Bucky could hear Schmidt screaming for them to pursue the prisoner.
“Ah see, didn’t I tell you girls the boys would be along to protect us? Boys? Didn’t anyone teach you it’s rude to keep a lady waiting?”
“I would have thought they couldn’t spare you from the sanitarium.”
“I’m sorry you felt like you had to do that.” Steve apologized for what he should have seen when it would have made a difference.
“Tony, no one is going to volunteer to take all seven of them.” Pepper pointed out, but he’d already thought of it, had already worked out that even if someone did, they’d want to separate them it would be easier to mold them that way.
“How old were you?” Tony asked, sympathy lacing his tone and Ian hunched further in on himself until he was almost hugging his knees. He didn’t answer.
“Tony, be careful.”
Brave words, coming from their jailer.
He felt a stare and glanced up, unsurprised to find Tony watching him, curiosity written on his face.
“You shouldn’t have gotten me anything.”
"My boy Emil has a good eye, wouldn't you say so Captain?" a boastful voice startled him.
"Stark." He greeted with a cordial nod and Tony replied with a smirk.
, he’d said. And what a time for Stevie to decide to listen! He hadn’t given them to the woman who’d agreed to be his wife and help him escape the noose. No. Oh no
She stood out like a flag amongst her siblings in the newly fitted dark blue skirt of her
Anger so potent he could taste it swelled inside him. He should have been paying closer attention! Where were the others?  He’d been a fool to think he could keep an eye on them all at once, here in this place. It felt like he’d gone into battle naked and he wasn’t used to that feeling. This time around there was no one watching his six. It was up to him to keep them all safe and he wouldn’t fail.
anymore. What was the point now of holding a grudge? He and Stevie were
Tony frowned at the words, trying to picture it in his mind's eye.
There was something primitive in the way his hands marveled at the flesh, like a sculptor molding clay, gripping the swells in both hands and nuzzling against his neck like a contented jungle lion.
Amen garadjovaha  - You must hide.
(Romany) beloved.
“Magda!” Franz- her brother he remembered- snarled, reaching out for the weapon. She backed away, keeping it out of reach and Franz faltered, his expression shifting from shock to fury. He was shorter than Magda, his dark hair trimmed in the stylish manner kept by most students. But they had similar jaw lines and the same eyes. Eyes that were widening in recognition as they shifted back to Steve, taking him in.
Maybe he’d projected too much of himself on the boy, or perhaps too much of Stefen, but Tony kept seeing the bruises on his knuckles in his mind’s eye. He didn’t think so. Backed into a corner he knew what Péter would do.
Tony would not like this plan but it was all Steve had, the only way he had to be sure that he wouldn’t be leaving his children penniless and at the mercy of the Reich when he died. It would change nothing about them or any of the promises Steve had made to him. Tony would just have to understand and if he didn’t, then Steve would just have to make him.
“Yes, let’s talk about Uncle Bucky.”
“Thank God!” Bucky’s smile turned into a wince as the cook kissed his cheeks, jostling his arm in her enthusiasm. “No one would tell us a thing! But the captain has been so worried -”
plot, only to abandon them!”
Since he was not welcome in the parlor room with the aryan elite any more than Jan was, Bucky ambled down the hallway, drink in hand walking with the goal of...fags he deiced. Yes, a good smoke was in order, but damn he was out again. Stefen had some, or rather he had the spare square he always kept handy for Bucky when he inevitable ran through his own.
“No.” Tony heard himself snap, surprising even himself but he said it again, firmer as all eyes turned to him. “How dare you come here with that.”
“Susann, you look wonderful …” And she did, every inch of her Swedish heritage from her height to her fine blond hair presented at its best in the simple but elegant style Themen was so known for, but Steve stiffened, feeling the unmistakable poke of her stomach against his, and hastily stepped back as if he feared he’d burn her. “God you’re… congratulations!”
“shame on you, sir, If you’re not here when you’re not on tour I don’t know what you’re doing, clearly not living’
“James?”
And that was where the line between reality and fantasies was so starkly drawn.
"You weren't supposed to know." Stefen grumbled and the rebuke was obvious.  As far as apologies went Tony's ignorance was a poor one, in light of the tragedy he could have brought down on all their heads, but Stefen had been the one to open this door, to hide a pair of fugitives in his attic, which only said that he'd already accepted the danger and the possible consequences.
Bucky, ever antagonistic, shrugged and grunted a simple yes. Tony resisted the urge to kick them both.
He took another sip of his drink, the fruit tasting sour when it hit the back of his throat.
If he never said anything else to Péter he had to say this. Péter stared at him, his gaze rapt with attention.
Tony laughed through his tears at how quickly she switched tracks from spitting on the memory of his father to fussing over the most mundane of creature comforts. Was he warm? He felt like he’d never be cold again.
Feeling wrong footed Péter called out pitifully to the man’s retreating back.
Stefen flinched.
Steve’s heart began to pound. It was an uncomfortable sensation. On some level he recognized that he was aroused, but rather than please him he felt detached from it. Angered even. That buzzing in his blood was distracting and confusing. He had to keep shoving everything down and that was exhausting. But if he pulled away, he’d hurt Tony. He couldn’t deal with that either. He’d end up drowning in the water again. So, Steve dug holes instead. He dug deeper and deeper still, burying everything that wasn’t important to the mission until he couldn’t feel any of it anymore.
“Your da needs me now.” he said, taking in a quick breath, the rattle in it barely perceptible, and then he looked over the rest of them, the light from the fire tossing shadows over his face but providing just enough illumination to reveal that his eyes were red.
"It is. Yesterday, Frauline Werner had all the girls in our group line up. She measured us and took notes, then she had Sophie and me stand at the front. She had the girls point out our genetic strengths and weaknesses. Sophie's hair is blond and fine but her eyes are brown. My eyes are blue, like Father's, and my hair is red like the first Germans. My waist is perfect for child bearing but Sophie is too skinny for bearing healthy children."
“Good, you keep rubbing, and keep telling him to breathe.” Tony squeezed Ian’s shoulder, and turned toward the stairs leading to the loft where Péter had just finished climbing down. He and Natacha were keeping the others upstairs, on the chance that whatever virus James had caught wasn’t contagious.
Artur squeezed him all the tighter. “You'll come in the water?”
Steve rammed an elbow against his side, nodding shortly to Thor and Siv in understanding.
~*~*~*~
Updates on the status of Harold and Virginia Hogan and their children.  Asylum, or their freedom if they had already been interned. Following the mission, guaranteed safe passage for Stefen, the children and Tony to Elise Island, where Tony had agreed to build weapons from the safety of American shores.
Either way he complied and Bucky seemed content with that.
“Vernon L. Kellogg’s, Elementary Zoology. Artur would go mad for that!” Tony exclaimed pointing.
“-There’s a brother back at the abbey, brother Filip.-”
“Stop Franz. No one is here!”
“Dio Mio.” Tony panted, repositioning both hands upon the headboard and pushing his hips forward. He had no illusions of lasting long. Not with Steve looking at him that way and holding onto him as if he were a lifeline. Not when he just lay there and let Tony
“Captain!” Virginia darted forward to catch his arm.
Steve grit his teeth and muttered for Bucky to shut up.
“And then you’ll be back?”
“Are you dying?” Stefen called, switching back to German and sounding for all the world bored. How he managed to look and sound so composed after an exchange like that Tony didn't know because he felt like he’d had an electric shock to the heart…and possibly his groin. Most definitely his groin, he thought begrudgingly as Ian continued trying to drown his younger brother.
“But I’ve still got to go,” Father sighed.
If Steve had his way they’d spend every hour cloistered in his office hashing over maps and letters trying to win the bloody war before it ever started.
“Stefen...” Charlotte called his name again, like she’d been calling it before. “Stefen, I know how it feels, but they should be in their own beds. Things will not be normal again until they return to their routine and see that it is safe.”
He shrugged out of his own wet clothes, down to his drawers, and ignored Tony’s pensive stare as he laid them out.
. The captain gritted his teeth and for a moment Tony thought he was going to march away just to be obstinate (stubborn goat of a man that he was) but then Rogers caught the gardner’s eye, of all people, and something about Wiess’ expression thankfully got him to turn back to the children and attempt a better parting.
“Norway is not inevitable, Stefen, it is a choice. You want to lead this mission. Do you deny that?” Tony turned to pin him with a direct stare.
Steve didn’t really need him to say anything.
“Stefen?” Tony urged him gently and at the sound of his name that lost look on the captain’s face was swept away by grim resignation.
Steve shook himself and stood, stumbling toward the wardrobe. “I'm fine” he insisted.
“The meetings have ended, the Führer signed a peace deal and is on his way back to Berlin. They’re calling it off. The Chief, he says say if you attack now the army won’t back you up. It’s over Captain.”
On Air: KNIGHT and unknown 3
"We were better for it. Sam is one of the bravest men I've ever known."
He slowly reached into his pocket for his square of cigarettes and lit up.
Footsteps sounded on the path and Steve glanced up to watch Péters approach, memorizing every last detail of the way he looked with his brown hair streaked with summer sun and his knees bobbing beneath his brown shorts. He couldn't say when his shoulders had widened like that or his arms gotten such definition, but it was all there in the details. A young man had taken the place of his little boy – the knock kneed little imp Peggy had called her gyspy boy, always climbing over the furniture and attempting to fly, confident that his father would be there to catch him - but as much as Steve wanted that boy back, he would never trade the man Péter was becoming.
“Did she die like mine did… like my mother did?”
Tony lapsed into silence, lost in thought.
But Stark appeared to know what he was about, banging about down there, every movement smooth and confident. He was focused in a way that Bucky hadn’t observed in him yet, the man always twitching and talking a mile a minute… he looked at home.
. Stefen!”
“Something’s happened to Cameron,” Hortense filled him in with an anxious whisper, eyes flickering fearfully to the backdoor.
He went back to tapping. Grounding himself.
There was a pause, in which Steve wasn't sure if he was going to combust in unexplained rage or embarrassment. It felt like an age, his balance on that knife point shaking as he teetered between finishing what he started and melting with shame. He took a deep breath in.
He heard Charlotte groan softly just under her breath. Khalmmer cocked his head, his gaze near identical to the appalled expression Charlotte had given him only a moment before. The silence stretched for a moment longer before he snorted, lips stretching into another smile; only this one was devastatingly more real than any Steve had ever seen from him previously. It brought out the green in his eyes Steve noticed with a startled blink.
Tacha said they liked him and that he had to do something about it, and that the best thing to do was to either start walking one of them home or say he was saving himself for God and country. When Ian told his father that he looked startled before he laughed.
“Ian?” Tony lightly rested a hand on his shoulder. Ian turned to him without a word and buried his face against Tony’s chest and cried.
“Why are you doing this?” She hissed at Cameron instead. “Father said he’d take care of you both. Why are you stealing from us and running away?”
“You’re right Buck.” Steve said with a blink and an air of finality that didn’t do much to comfort Bucky. “You were right all along. They take everything… but they can’t have this.”
His beedy gaze flitted around the room like a fly before he homed in on Steve. He ran a hand through his slightly unkept hair and said hurriedly, “There you are Major. Hurry, we’ve not a moment to lose.”
She didn’t stay on the phone long, not wishing to clog up the lines any more than they had to with so many people trying to connect with loved ones. She would send Harold with the car as soon as the roads cleared up. He rejected her attempt to call for the baroness. Tony didn't have the energy to try and convince Stefen to leave his post and certainly none to field comforting the man’s fiancé on his behalf.
Tony nearly jumped out of his skin when a shrill whistle blew just behind his ear.
Lt. Wolfe led them quickly and unceremoniously out of the administrative building to the medical ward, the sounds of rapid gunfire and shouts coming from the yard beating at their heels. As Tony and Clint walked through the doors behind him, the smell of blood and other bodily fluids rushed to meet them like a toxic cloud. Tony immediately covered the lower half of his face with his hand to block out the stench.
“Will you be alright?” he asked under his breath for Steve’s ears only. Because the pallet was narrow and Steve’s shoulders were wider, Tony was turned just slightly against Steve’s side, tucked into him like...
“We've promised our aide to several suffering families. How are we to see to them if this is allowed to continue?” Tiberius demanded full of rancor and Nik held up a hand, commanding the young monk to silence.
“And this is how you plan to show it?” he entreated and Steve jerked as if Tony had shot him, staring down at him with naked surprise, like Tony had caught him undressing and Tony’s mouth tilted toward a soft smile, even though his chest felt weighted.
He jerked away but she kept coming, hands snatching at him, grasping everywhere. Why wouldn’t they stop? All night, unwanted hands gripping him possessively, touching and claiming what they had no right to. He pushed her back, rougher than he meant to – he heard the children gasp as Charlotte stumbled with a cry – but she kept her balance. Shock slammed into him at his own actions, the room suddenly ceasing its spinning and coming back with horribly sharp clarity.
"The right thing often does." Stefen twitched, uncomfortable; though whether it was from the praise or the intensity of Tony’s gaze was hard to tell. And then he turned slightly to stare directly at Tony for the first time, something almost nervous in his eyes before he took a breath and soldiered on.
Stark men were made of iron and he was the best built of them all. Still as Tony struggled and the gates finally sprang open with a groan and a horrible creek he couldn't help but think it an omen.
Stefen led them to a small, cluttered looking shop with chipped paint that read Herr Tuck’s Essentials and Delights.
No one could render Tony so wrong footed so quickly. Well no one outside of his father, but that was an entirely different sort of wrong footed.
"That's... quite alright, Willamina. Thank you."
“Your girls will have been taken to the ghetto with the other Jews. Maybe to one of the work camps already. You know what happens to them there. The only chance for them now is if the Reich is stopped,” Bucky said slowly, pausing until Dvorak’s sniffling had quieted and the other man had lifted his gaze to look back at him. “If you’re any kind of man, eventually you’ll start thinking about putting a bullet in their leader. Big public execution. He’ll be right there and you’ll be close.”
Below deck was cramped, the cabin only just large enough to fit all of them and the five other strangers they found there. There were two young men who might have been brothers who sat close to one another, their heads down as they whispered in the dark. Opposite them was an older woman who sat upon the only bed, her thin hair graying at the roots, holding herself as far apart from the others as their small quarters would allow.  A middle-aged man with a small boy on his lap sat against the bed frame, and Tony caught the way his arms tightened around the boy as the light from Luzzato’s torch shone down on their faces.
“In the future Herr Stark, I expect you to stay where you are told,” the captain warned and Tony tried his best to diffuse the tension.
The children looked particularly giddy about the chocolate bars, not that Tony could blame them, but he sternly withheld them until after salted mystery meat and chalky bread were valiantly consumed. Hunger ensured that the children got on with it without much complaint, but only Stefen had the audacity to look as if he were actually enjoying himself. He was the last to start eating and the first to finish.
Warnings in this chapter: reminder for period typical phobias, racism, derogatory speech, and sexism. And an additional warning for period typical uninformed drug use.
Steve watched her like a hawk as she set down a steaming mug of black coffee before him. Maybe she’d seen, but she wasn’t acting as if she had. He would just have to hope that her regard for Jarvis’ memory was stronger than any disgust she was feeling if she had.
Tony’s eyes found Natacha where she sat in the back row, at the farthest end nearest the window. Their “schoolroom” was actually a donated room within a seamstress shop. During class hours the bolts, fabrics, and machines were moved aside to make space at the tables for the children.
. In that moment he had, and he didn’t know how to keep breathing with the weight of guilt filling up his chest.
Too quickly the jarring ringing of the telephone broke through the fog of desire in Tony’s brain, the sudden loss of Stefen’s body heat against his like a physical ache as Stefen drew back, eyes full of heat as he murmured, “That should be clear enough for you.”
“Bucky will save him,” she insisted, but her tone was hollow and bare of any inflection. “There’s still time.”
“Buck?”
He was looking down at Ian, who was looking up at his father with his arms crossed behind his back in what Tony could only classify as parade rest.
“Herr Stark.” The monk looked up, his gaze slow this time, feigned innocence replaced by something more frigid. Steve had known his share of bullies and he'd be damned if he'd be backed into a corner by a mad monk and his looks. “I think we've had quite enough stories to curdle our stomachs for one night.”
“And that’s why your Uncle Bucky will forever be finding himself running from trouble.” Steve remarked equally dry and Bucky scoffed, leaning down to faux whisper in James ear.
"Oh Captain," Tony had the audacity to greet him as if they'd happened upon each other by chance. "You'll never believe who showed up this morning. Aren't these your newest sensations Herr Bakhuizen?"
Steve had barely spoken to anyone in days. First there had been the expulsion of the Polish Jews, then Péter’s disappearance, and now the country was in an uproar once again, since a Jewish teenager had shot a German diplomat over in Paris. Those with enough charity whispered rumors that it was because his parents had been among the Jews ejected from the country, now suffering in the border camps. Most echoed the sentiments shared in the broadcasts over civilian radio and in the papers, that the shooting had been an organized attack by an international Jewish threat.
We also want to thank you from the bottom of our hearts for sticking with this story and all of your feedback. It gives us inspiration to keep pushing through. You're all lovely. What do you think Steve's going to do when he learns what Tony has been up to?
“Forgive me Father, Sub-prior,” Tiberius nodded shortly to he and Filip in turn before rounding on Nik with every last drop of his pent up frustration and demanding, “something must be done about Antony! I know that you’re fond of him Father. Perhaps you find his antics amusing, but he isn’t a child anymore and I insist he be held accountable this time. The man is a menace!”
