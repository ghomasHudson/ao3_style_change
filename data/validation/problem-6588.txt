“Shit, aren’t they supposedly death-” Tony shoots him a look and the teenager backpedals with a wince. “I mean, wow! That will be... fun?”
flashing across his face at the words. “My father wants me at a party. It’s… it’s a company thing. I’m expected to make appearances.”
“You think that’s why I want to be with you? Because I want to be able to say I’ve fucked a celebrity?”
The question is no longer accusatory, but resigned. There is no smile on Obadiah’s face anymore, not like last time, and the man straightens the lapels of his jacket, looking Tony dead in the eye.
He flinches, spinning around and relaxing as he sees Rhodey. The feeling of unease that had accompanied seeing the jar vanishes.
They pull up outside the SI tower, and Tony feels like a block of ice has lodged itself in his stomach.
They’ve gotten… closer. So much closer. If Tony was honest with himself, which he never is, not with this, he’s pretty sure that he would opt to spend every second of the day with Steve.
Steve comes back almost a year later, and Tony isn’t ready, but he doesn't think he'll ever be ready for Steve Rogers. Seeing him feels like he's been punched in the stomach, but he feels… awake.
It’s steel in Tony’s voice now. It’s a tone that’s taken down billionaires, the same ice that he used on the nurse before. The same one he used on Steve that one time in the cafe, so long ago. He’s too tired to fight with Tony like this, doesn’t
He doesn’t wait to hear her answer, turning to the woman who’s now waiting for someone, and trying to reassure himself that Tony will be fine.
Steve is blushing again, and Tony brushes a thumb over his cheek. His eyes are so fucking bright and
Steve is looking at his face, at the bruise that is still fading. He reaches out to touch it, but then stops, pulling his hand away again.
The billionaire’s laugh rises above the roaring noise of the crowd as he pulls Steve into the middle of it, fighting to get to the spot that they’ve saved. He’s surprised the pounding of his heart isn’t audible. Tony’s grip doesn’t release, doesn’t give an inch, even for a second. So Steve lets himself be pulled along, trusting the person leading him.
Tony narrows his eyes, placing his glass of water on the spotless island, assessing Steve, lips curling into a smile that not many people see. It’s small, quiet. Real.
Obie shrugs. “It’s not my problem what went on between the two of you. You’re lucky your father still knows nothing about it.”
He has no fucking clue what to wear. Jeans. Shirt. Jacket. He doesn’t have one of Steve’s hoodies; he wants one of Steve’s. He wants Steve now, wants Rhodey, and wants a fucking
Tony glares at his best friend, and Rhodey, who’s gotten rather good at doing so over the years, just ignores him.
The men crowd forward, and in seconds, Obadiah is surrounded by people escorting him out of the room.
The bartender pours him one, and then tops it up on request. He probably drinks it faster than he should, but he doesn’t care right now.
She knows Ty’s name, Steve told her in the car. He’s unbelievably grateful that she doesn’t say it though. Steve glances at Tony, gauging his reaction. For a second, there’s a flash of savage pleasure in his face before it rearranged into something more neutral. Steve wonders where and
For a second, Tony wonders if Steve is going to say something else. His eyes flicker with something unreadable, and there’s a part of Tony that wants to ask. The other part of him is so very afraid to.
“I love you,” he says quietly, and the rain keeps falling. Steve is warm. “But I don’t- I don’t need you to say it back-”
They all spin around as someone Steve guesses walks through the door. He recognises the voice from that phone call. James Rhodes. Rhodey.
Steve’s dressed differently this time, more normal clothing taking precedence over the SHIELD uniform.
“The police warrant was necessary only because I’ve always wanted to throw one onto a desk. This seemed like a more appropriate time than any. Also, I enjoyed seeing the look on your face. I've got to get my giggles somewhere.”
Two weeks later, Steve asks him to come and see an exhibition that some of his art is in. Tony doesn’t hesitate before saying yes, calling Pepper and asking her to cancel whatever meetings he has on his calendar.
“You remembered.” Steve says quietly as Frank Sinatra sings, and some restless part of him that had never known what it’s like to have Tony Stark in his arms settles into sleep.
He glances at Steve, eyes questioning, clearly wondering if it Steve was okay with him ordering on his behalf. He nods with a half smile, finally feeling his nerves ebbing away. Tony knows the restaurant, so he trusts him to know what’s good to eat too.
Steve hears a few muttered curses in Italian on the other side of the line, and resists the urge to smile.
When Steve opens the door (it opens fast), he smiles, and even though it’s a sad smile, it’s still so goddamn beautiful.
Steve opens his mouth, but Natasha gets there first, and he loves her, but she’s never been particularly tactful.
“What-” he swallows, taking another sip of water and pushing himself into a sitting position so that he can turn to look at Steve. Everything
Steve seems to think that changing the subject is a good idea, and Tony agrees, because it’s much less likely that he’ll end up saying something that he’ll regret. So instead, he flashes a smile at Steve that he
The press would die to get their hands on something like this. Though that can be applied to most stories when it comes to him. Ty had once called him the
the waffles. Or maybe that’s just how hungry he is. He waves at Nat as Tony pushes open the door, offering her a hesitant smile. For a second, there’s no sound in the room, and then Nat is walking towards them, holding out her hand. Tony shakes it and Steve sees something in him relax, most likely out of relief.
“Not in the slightest.” Steve says with a grin, sitting up with a tiny wince. He feels better, a lot better. He feels stiff, still tired, but so much more functional than before.
He watched as Steve takes a step back, hurt flickering over his face, and part of Tony wants to just run, and get as far away from the entire situation as possible.
His knees ache as they connect with the floor, waves of nausea rolling through him as he throws up whatever's left in his stomach. It’s from the alcohol, and whatever the
The worst thing is that he’s not even surprised by the words. Obie knows how to twist it, just like Howard does. A double act, Tony thinks bitterly. He never really stood a chance.
Too many years knowing Natasha has trained him out of the jerk reaction, but old habits die hard. He doesn’t even think the Captain realises what this is doing to his heart rate. To him, it’s just a casual question, a curiosity.
“You want to see if Nat and Sam will come out for drinks?” He turns the phone off, sliding it into his pocket. He needs a break from worrying about the billionaire’s son, and he needs a break from the apartment.
Obie smiles. He’s always had a predators smile. “Your coffee boy. Steve Rogers, right? Goes to the NYU institute of art?”
Tony shakes his head, not giving an answer. He’s not sure if he can. He grabs his keys and jacket and pulls it on. The cold is back with a vengeance, and so is the noise in his head. He can’t meet Steve’s eyes; he doesn’t want to see the look on his face.
Tony shrugs, pulling out his phone and tapping a few buttons on it. A second later, the doors open, and the room is filled with people in black tuxedos. Steve is
Rhodey stretches. “I’ll get you the warrant. I’m owed about a thousand favours by the NYPD, so I’m sure we can work something out.”
Natasha laughs, waving at Clint as he leaves, and he blows her a kiss as he saunters out of the door, the shit eating grin never dropping from his face.
“Natalie.” He steps in before this drags out for longer than necessary. “No offence but… What are you doing here?”
Sam comes up behind him, and something about his face must give him away, because his friend laughs. “That didn't click straight away, huh.”
“I’m not going anywhere.” Steve murmurs, pulling Tony’s head into his lap and making himself comfortable. He brushes a hand through Tony’s hair, wiping gently at the tearstains that are traced into his skin.
“I hate you,” he says, nothing more than a whisper. It’s a lie, he could never. He thinks he’s crying, he knows he is. But he doesn’t care about anything anymore because Steve fucking messed it up and now Obie will hit back because that’s what he
The cold air helps him to relax instantly, soothing the building headache. Howard, Obadiah, Ty- when one backs off, another is there to haunt him. He still has vague memories of the previous night, vague memories of everything spinning and Ty's hands just-
“No,” he snaps, spinning to face him. It’s a lie. He’s so scared. “But they fucking get off on power, all three of the parasites, and I’m trapped in the middle.” His voice is rising, not quite shouting, but he’s not relaxed either.
He waits as Tony makes the coffee and then he comes over to hand Steve a mug, retaking his seat on the sofa with a smile.
Somehow, he manages to get to his room, collapsing onto the bed. The jumper smells like Steve and he’s blinking tears away and
He knows Steve doesn’t miss the tinge of bitterness in his voice, but the pity he’s dreading never comes. Instead, there’s something sharp flashing in his eyes.
“It’s okay,” Steve says softly, taking his wrists gently and pulling him tight against him. Tony fights it, because he doesn’t want his pity, he wants to protect him and he just wants him to be
The rain doesn’t care about anything, about him or Steve or anyone else in the world. It’s nature, it’s powerful, it’s clean.
“Happy told me about a sweet little coffee shop that you like. I need some caffeine, and it’s close by. Know the one?”
There’s something that flashes in Obadiah's eyes at that, but for the life of him Tony can’t work out what. He counts four seconds of silence in the pounding of his heart and then-
Steve still isn’t sure how they got onto the subject of dancing, but they’re here now, and Tony is leaning against one of the kitchen surfaces, glass of water in one hand. Steve watches as he reaches into the cupboard with the other, grabbing one of Nat’s secret stash of cookies that she keeps hidden.
The first thing he does when he leaves the next day is go to Steve’s apartment. Obadiah has left a note on his floor about how he can leave when he wants, and he’s one hundred percent sure it’s some sort of test, it always is, but he doesn’t care right now
Steve immediately moves his hands away, but Tony grabs his wrist in a loose grip before he can get far.
Steve’s eyes are so blue, the sunlight hitting them and turning everything golden. They’re so close that he can see the different colours in his eyes, see the reflection of the light on his hair.
He doesn’t focus on where he’s going. Doesn’t really matter anyway. Rhodey seems to have a sixth sense when it comes to knowing where he is at all times, and it’s not like the teachers are that fussed.
“It won’t take long.” Rhodey says, voice flat. Only Tony catches the way his hands tremble slightly with anger as he slides them into his pockets.
Steve isn’t sure he’s breathing anymore, never wants to do anything else again other than hold Tony, be with Tony,
. Tony pays with his credit card, and leaves a tip for the waitress that’s roughly equivalent to Steve’s weekly wage, and will undoubtedly make her night. But he doesn’t care right now, because as they leave the restaurant, Tony takes his hand.
Tony laughs, and there’s something so honest about his laugh, it’s refreshing. Steve feels his own smile widening, and there’s a part of him that wants to make him laugh again.
He knows Rhodey is out of town. So Obie then. He ignores the dread that settles in his stomach, ignores the fact that he wants to do nothing more than turn back time to kissing Steve.
“Steve.” Tony snaps, clearly losing patience. “You’re talking to a fucking billionaire. I’ll pay for what the class would’ve cost. Hell, if you would
He thinks of his mother, how much love she'd had for him, the love that he still feels now, even when she's gone. He thinks of Rhodey and Pepper, people who have never left his side, not even once. He thinks of Steve, Steve who's hurt him, but also saved him more times than he can count, saved him in so many more ways that one.
“I’ve just been emailed your schedule for next week.” It’s Pepper, and he loves her for calling this phone, for keeping it professional, because he doesn’t think he would be able to keep it together if she hadn’t. “Your parents-”
Steve is used to loud, used to fighting and shouting orders and surviving on the battlefield. Everything is hard, sharp edges and the knowledge of saving lives. He hasn’t had anything soft in a while.
He’d gone back to the stupid, tiny place again, and it hadn’t been for the coffee, (though it’s his favourite so far) but for the barista with the blue eyes.
“That’s my job,” he says, flashing another smile. “Or it was until Fury poached me to go on your cute little death mission.”
“Yeah, I’m sorry to bother you this late but the tech I gave to you earlier, I was wondering if you’ve had a chance to look at it?”
Steve reaches out, gently taking Tony’s hands in his own, and he looks up, question in his eyes. Steve's expression is hesitant, a little sad.
Something flashes across Obadiah’s face and he takes a step backwards. Steve doesn’t move, not letting himself relax, hardly daring to breathe. Tony is still in front of him, unmovable.
“No. But did I forget to mention the cameras? I said they were mine, technically I loaned the footage to SHIELD. Apparently, they’re rather invested in taking down power hungry businessmen. I mean usually, they’re far more interested in global scale threats, but your scheming plus a rather large donation convinced them to lend a hand.”
Tony pulls away, and there’s something so vulnerable in his eyes, something that makes Steve catch his breath. Tony leans forwards, pressing their foreheads together, and then they’re both just breathing, and Steve can feel something inside of him relaxing, every part of him sliding into a sort of peaceful bliss. Happy. Tony’s happy, they’re both
Tony lets out a breath, shaking his head a little. “I don’t even know if I’m angry about this. I’m- it feels like shock. He was ready to kill me, he
“Are you okay?” Steve asks, and Tony knows he means it in more than one way. But Steve shouldn't be asking him, shouldn’t be worrying about him, he’s fine-
When he opens his eyes, the room is filled with light, the sort of light that you can only get when its a cold December morning.
That’s what Rhodey had told him anyway. When he had moved back from MIT after the summer, he had first moved into his parent’s house in New York.
It’s a lie, and Fury knows it, Tony knows it, and Nat knows it. Tony Carbonell doesn’t do tech, not at this level. Tony Stark… Tony Stark has made billions from it.
the smile in Steve’s voice, hear the warm curl to all the words that are coming out of his mouth. “I just don’t understand the problem.”
He has just finished the first mug when his phone rings. He ignores it, because if Obie wants to fucking shout at him again, he can drag his ass all the way over here to do it.
“Well intel suggests otherwise.” Fury snaps, and Tony, jolting back to the present, wonders if the director has always been this bad at keeping his annoyance in check. Unlike Tony, who learnt how to keep everything off his face more than fifteen years ago. Steve sucks in a breath, and Tony watches him relax back into the seat.
“Tony may have let you back in here, but that doesn’t mean I, or anyone else, has forgotten what you did.”
When they’re done with the wine, Tony stands and kisses him, and it’s slow and sweet. Steve tastes like mint. It’s warm in the apartment, and the lights are soft. It’s quiet, but not silent. It’s never silent in this city.
When Tony smiles, Steve’s heart breaks a little, because he hasn't seen a smile that sad in a while.
One day, almost a week after Steve comes back, Rhodey is with Tony in the kitchen when Steve walks in from a morning run. Tony looks away from the clothes that cling to his body, very firmly avoiding his eyes. He feels Rhodey tense up next to him
Okay so hi, this one was a little more exciting! Sorry for the wait, unfortunately my updates aren't going to get much better, especially once I start school again in september. I'll try and keep you all updated, and will probably do so either through my instagram or tumblr (both are linked below, and my username on both is @/wordsxstars)
“Okay.” Tony sounds scared, and Steve’s throat tightens. “That was a stupid question. Just stay with me, okay?”
The Captain sits on Peter’s discarded seat, and it only takes Tony about thirty seconds to realise he’s so goddamn hyper aware of Steve’s gaze on him as he works. So it doesn’t come as a surprise when, a minute later, he hears rather than sees the shifting of a seat. Another beat and Steve is right behind him, watching over his shoulder as he takes the tracker apart, replaces the model of the computer inside it, and then puts it all back together.
she’d had more to drink than he had. Her and Clint on a team in drinking games is terrifying, and usually results in too much alcohol, and both of them out like lights by the end of the evening.
He jolts out of his own thoughts as the first person pushes open the door, and despite the dull throb in his head (less now that the aspirin has kicked in), settles into an easy rhythm. Despite all her teasing, an hour into his shift, Nat places a glass of water next to him with a sympathetic smile.
“Sure Tony,” Steve says gently, and something tense in his chest uncoils. “But if Clint wakes us both up at three in the morning, you’re not allowed to complain.”
And then suddenly, all Steve can think about is the story his mom had read to him about mythology so many years ago. It had been somewhere in a bedtime story, a random book of Greek mythology with a single purpose to get children to relax. It was essentially Plato but simplified. He doesn’t know why this memory is coming back to him
With Nat’s help, they manage to get Tony  out of the car, but he’s barely upright for five seconds before he’s throwing up on the side of the street.
“You love me.” Tony says again, quiet and disbelieving. Steve leans down and kisses him again because how can he not, and then again.
The panic has long since faded, and he wonders when Steve became someone who could make that happen. He isn’t sure. It feels like a lifetime ago that they met in the coffee shop, but it’s been less than a week. A week, and so much has changed. A week doesn’t feel like enough time, but he feels like he’s known Steve forever.
“Yeah,” he says, brain not really processing the words. “Just- I’ll forward you Rhodey’s number. Can you call him?”
They talk for hours in the tiny restaurant. Tony orders them both desserts when the clock hits 11, and it’s a cake that’s sweet and soft, and it’s
Obadiah Stane had been reported as dead not even a week after being transferred to one of SHIELD’s high security prisons. Apparently, the man had an uncanny ability to make enemies everywhere he went. Steve had seen the relief in Tony’s eyes when he had heard the news, the relief and the tiny shimmer of regret, because maybe there would always be a part of the genius that cared for Obadiah.
A jar catches his gaze, focus shifting as he moves closer. A small plaque gives the name of the piece.
Steve doesn’t reply, eyes wide as he takes in everything around him. There’s a countdown on one of the huge screens, ticking down from the five minute mark. He can’t see the route they came from, it’s long since been swallowed up by the crowd. For once, it doesn’t bother Steve. They’ve made it just in time.
Steve shakes his head, closing his eyes for a second. If he tells Tony, it will only add to the guilt, and there’s already so much of it in Tony’s voice, his eyes. He can’t be the one who makes it worse.
There’s a hand on his arm, guiding him out of the room and down the hall. The grip is too tight. There's a sound of another door opening and closing. Silence. It’s finally quiet. He doesn’t feel anything, and his
He opens his eyes, and when he takes his next breath, he strengthens the walls holding the pain back. Breathe. Strengthen. Breathe. Steve is staring at him like he’s seen a ghost.
Tony flips her off without looking, resting his head on Steve’s shoulder and closing his eyes. Steve’s arms wrap a little more securely around him.
“Yep,” she says, popping the P and smirking in a way that makes Steve feel more than a little afraid of her, and very glad she’s his friend. “That sounds about right.”
But then he thinks of Obie’s smile, the blackmail, the manipulation. Threatening Rhodey. Threatening Steve.
It makes his chest ache with longing, to see Tony like this. He looks relaxed, happy, his curls that are usually so perfectly gelled still messy from sleep. Steve forces himself to focus.
Tony shakes his head again, looking at the floor, and Steve takes his face in his hands, tilting it upwards.
Their shirts go first, and there’s a second where Tony is grateful for the dim lighting because then Steve won’t see his arm. He shoves those thoughts out of the way. Another time.
A second later, Steve sees the walls going up, all those invisible defences sliding into place. When Tony meets his gaze again, he knows the smile the billionaire gives him isn’t real, because his eyes are so, so empty.
“You have three minutes and thirty seconds. I’ll be over here with Clint and Sam, pretending not to be listening to whatever Tony has clearly been itching to say since you two arrived.”
He sees the look in her eyes as she recognises Obadiah, but it’s quickly covered by the smile she gives him.
Slowly, so slowly, the tears subside. The shaking takes longer. Steve doesn’t know what time it is when he stops feeling Tony’s grief seeping into his skin, but it’s well past the night and into the early hours of the morning.
He shifts slightly, reaching out and brushing some of the hair out of Tony’s face. Tony huffs, and Steve feels his grip tighten, hands curling around his shirt as Tony burrows deeper into his chest.
Some hard edge in Tony’s eyes softens at this, and Steve realises how tired he looks. Exhausted, worried.
He meets his eyes, releasing the breath slowly. The anger has vanished, the will to push him away has vanished. He doesn’t care, he doesn’t. But he can’t have Steve looking at him with pity, he
“I thought you’d be older.” The Captain says eventually, a half smile crossing his lips. “You’re twenty five, right?”
He was 13 when he discovered that the real monsters aren’t the ones from the stories, but the businessmen in suits and expensive cologne. He won’t forget it.
Steve knows what that means, knows that Tony is definitely smart enough to figure it out with or without his help. But he can’t bring himself to say it.
Nat turns around, throwing her hands up in exasperation. “You’re both dumb. Glad you finally managed to get that one out Stark.”
For some reason, he can feel guilt settling in his stomach as he types the name into the search bar, even though he’s completely entitled to look him up.
The voice on the other side is a little louder now, and Tony grits his teeth, turning away from Steve. It’s like he doesn’t want him to hear, even though they’re still so close that it would be impossible for him
He leads the way out of the apartment, and tries to work out if Steve, the most honest person he knows, will ever forgive him.
He flashes her a smile and a glare at the same time, and she just grins back, slipping into a seat next to him. Despite everything, Tony feels himself relax slightly. “Full of surprises. Though I’m not sure
And then he’ll know that all he has to do to get Tony to stop fighting him on every tiny thing is go after Steve.
Steve’s shirt is soaked with Tony’s tears, but he doesn’t care, just adjusts their positions so that he’s leaning against the wall, pulling Tony into his lap.
“I’m afraid I can’t allow it at the moment. They’re still running tests on him, and so far it’s nothing to be too worried about. I can tell you there’s nothing life threatening. But I can’t let you see him yet, I’m sorry.”
There’s a beat of silence. When it comes back to him, Rhodey's voice is carefully controlled. Tony can still hear the ice in it, the cold anger. It’s not directed at him, but it’s still a little terrifying.
Tony’s stomach flips, and he takes another sip of his drink, hands shaking as he puts it down again.
Steve reaches out, smoothing his curls away from his face, trying to convey every part of the love he feels for Tony into a single look. Tony tilts his head into the touch, letting Steve runs his fingers through his hair for a second. Tony’s eyes are bright, open, and Steve lets himself relax into the almost untouchable, yet so tangible beauty of the man in front of him. It’s a second of stillness, a moment of peace in all the chaos.
“According to myth, he doesn’t trust anyone.” Tony mutters, heading over to where Peter is sitting. “Looks good.”
Unfortunately, his luck isn’t good enough, and he leans over the counter with a smile that Steve is sure people would kill to have directed at them.
He flinches hard, flinches back like he’s expecting Steve to lash out, to hit him, because it’s an instinct, just an instinct, and with Howard-
He takes the subway to Steve’s place, keeping his sunglasses on and his hood up. He doesn’t get recognised, which is a relief, because he doesn’t have the energy for that today. When he gets there, he knocks once, trying to keep some sort of control over his expression.
“I'm sorry.” Steve says quietly, feeling the burn of tears in his eyes, and he blinks them back. “Tony, baby, just-”
He lifts his chin, walking over to the front. There’s no queue, so he’s got five seconds to figure out how to do this, how to say
“You’re late,” Howard says as he walks out of the elevator, and Tony keeps his expression neutral. They’re the first words he’s said to him in a month.
When Steve pushes open the cafe door, he’s twenty minutes late for work, and he’s met with Nat, Sam and Clint leaning against the counter. They all have crossed arms, are all clearly trying not to laugh.
of what Natasha would do, Tony knows as much from hours spent working with her at SHIELD. But of course, this is not Natasha Romanoff at all.
“Yeah,” he says, tipping back the glass, barely feeling the burn of the alcohol. He doesn’t look at Steve. He’s not sure he wants to see the look on his face. “Busy with work.”
Then his phone buzzes with a text and he groans, pulling it out of his pocket carefully, trying not to move Tony. It’s Clint, and he needs help with an assignment. For a second, he considers saying no, but then he remembers how much help his friend gives
It seems like a thousand years pass before Tony shakes his head again slowly, but Steve sees his shoulders relax, eyes losing some of their defensiveness.
Steve smiles, lacing their hands together, and Tony leans into his warmth. It scares him, how different he is with Steve. It scares him how much he cares.
his body anymore. It’s like his brain is working on autopilot, and it’s so stupid because it’s just coffee, and it’s just Steve but he’s so
“You’re so beautiful.” Steve whispers, brushing his fingers through his hair, smoothing it away from his face.
Tony smiles, something he’s been doing more and more recently, and squeezes Steve’s hand in thanks. Then he moves, dragging Steve towards the door, barely giving him time to pick up his jacket.
He breaks away from Steve, a smile spreading across his face. It’s a genuine one, not the camera one. Tony at least, knows the difference.
Tony turns his full attention on Steve, narrowing his eyes slightly. “I told you, I left. I have no way of knowing. It’s no longer any of my business anyway. Plus I thought you had wiped out Hydra completely until about two minutes ago.”
“Obadiah, let me introduce you to Nick Fury. He’s certainly not as nice as I am, he’s got all the necessary evidence, and he will be in charge of your trial. Or lack thereof.”
“I love you.” He says into the quiet, because Tony makes him brave, and Tony makes him smile, and Tony- “I’ve loved you for years.”
Steve’s voice is soft, but it isn’t a voice that’s telling him he’s weak. It’s a voice of someone who cares.
Tony runs a hand through his hair, flopping down on the sofa next to him. They’re back in Tony’s apartment, and the place is warm.
“Hey Steve?” Tony says quietly, and Steve wonders if it’s normal to feel such a sense of total peace at the sound of a single voice.
“You’re good at so many things, you know.” Steve finally says when he trusts his voice, clearing his throat a little, glancing at the floor again to check he’s not about to break Tony’s toes. But the dancing is coming back to him now, from what little he’d done before and during the war. No professional… but enough.
He rolls over gently, leg tingling as he moves. But a dead leg is definitely worth it as he focuses in on what is around him, or mainly who is in his bed.
Tony’s lips are a little chapped, but still soft, warm. Steve can taste something sweet, maybe from the cookies earlier. He wants to stay kissing Tony Stark forever.
He’s out like a light now, and his breathing is steady but there’s no way Steve’s going anywhere. He gently cleans his face, brushing a hand through his hair. Then he slides down until he’s sitting on the floor with his back against the bed.
“I’m well aware of what he did, I was there.” He snaps, and instantly regrets it because Rhodey has been
He swears under his breath, turning to Obie with a look of apology in his eyes. “I’ll pay for this, just text me the details. I’m so sorry, I really have to go and help.”
If his mother had been driving, and she was always so careful, then it meant that maybe it hadn’t been an accident.
“Because you can control New York traffic now?” Steve shakes his head, no real annoyance in his voice.
But he wants him, more than he’s wanted anything in a while. He’s always been selfish, far too selfish to deny himself this.
When Steve finally notices him, his voice is hesitant, worried. That’s good, it’ll make Tony feel less guilty about having a conversation that will probably end in him being an asshole.
If he could be anywhere else right now, he would be. Bed preferably, but sitting down could also work. At least the cafe is warm. Warm, with the smell of coffee lingering in the air. Coffee. That’s
That gives him pause for a second, makes a break in the wall of ice that he has been busy constructing in his mind.
Tony hisses out a breath, knowing that the kid isn’t about to let it go. “Fine. Fury called me, he needs to debrief me about something. Well actually, Natasha called me, and then interrupted my lunch. Anyway, there’s a mission that apparently they need me for. And no, I can’t tell you anything, mostly because I don’t
Hope you liked this! If anyone wants to come and yell at me, my instagram and tumblr are @wordsxstars. Thank you for the support on this!
Rhodey looks between them again before sighing. A minute later he’s gone, and Tony turns back to Fury. He's scrambling a little, trying to put up the layer of arrogant confidence that he usually wears around school like a second skin. But the don't care attitude is evading him for some reason today, and it's making him feel jumpy, on edge. It's like Fury can see behind it all and see
He considers calling Ty again, just for the sake of it, or maybe finding one of the far too many women desperate for a few hours in his bed.
When his heart rate has slowed slightly and he feels a little more human, he takes a deep breath, meeting Steve’s eyes. They’re so blue, so bright. But they’re worried, he can see that much. Not pitying, because he thinks if Steve has looked at him with pity he would have broken.
It’s a dream, it’s a nightmare, it’s the only thing he’s been thinking about for the last three days.
“The answer is no,” Tony says steadily, even though his heart is still pounding in his chest. “You can tell Howard whatever you want.”
He wants to ask, wants to know what made him look like that, what it was that made him think that all Steve wants is sex…
He knows it’s not a threat, and it’s just Steve asking a question, but a tiny flicker of fear runs through him all the same. He squashes it fast.
Someone’s sitting next to him now, he can feel a tight but not too tight grip on his hand. There’s a shaky laugh, the coldness gone from his voice. Maybe he’s crying, but Steve can’t hold onto anything for long enough to open his eyes and see.
The email screenshots comes next, and Steve swallows down bile as Tony reaches out, scrolling through the information on the screen. There are endless emails, endless photos. Evidence, easily enough evidence. Words jump out at Steve as he reads, words that make him want to break glass, or maybe break the man who’d left only hours before.
“Okay then.” Happy doesn’t believe him, he never does. And Tony isn’t even a bad liar. “Call if you need anything.”
“I know, I just-” he hesitates, but then pushes on because does he really have anything to lose? “Your designs, what you build, the way your brain works. I love it.”
“Okay,” he says, releasing a breath. If it’s a breakup line, he deserves it. “I’ll be there in half an hour.”
He reaches out almost hesitantly, running his fingers over Steve’s face, brushing against his hair, touching his lips. Then he makes himself comfortable against his chest, kissing him gently.
The snow is falling heavily now, but he can’t feel the cold. Snowflakes settle on Steve’s face, and he’s so beautiful that it hurts.
“I know baby,” Steve murmurs, pulling him closer and just holding Tony as he breaks, shatters over and over into a thousand pieces. Steve is holding him together, is the
“Apologies.” Tony casts a glance at Steve, a once over that he knows will leave him feeling like nothing but dust on the bottom of a shoe, like a mild inconvenience at best. He’s always been good at giving that particular look; his father had taken care of it. “The staff here don’t seem to know the meaning of speed.”
He shuts his eyes, shaking his head to clear it. He doesn’t need anything else to make an appearance in his dreams, least of all this.
Tony, still trembling, doesn’t move. Steve can feel his fingers curled around his shirt, and he doesn’t know what to do, doesn’t know how to deal with this, doesn’t know how to
“My parents want to catch up.” His voice doesn’t waver, and he’s grateful. “They’re coming tomorrow, and I’ll be in a hotel with them. Probably won’t be able to talk much.”
Tony is soft even though he’s iron man, because the suit is the mask, but the man underneath… Steve is terrified of breaking him, even though he would die before he hurts him. He’s never been this close to anyone and felt like he does now. But he would throw away anything,
Tony raises his eyebrows, and when he speaks, his voice is flat and emotionless, the change in him instant. “You’re that eager to get Tony Stark into bed?”
And Steve is shouting now, taking a step closer. “You were a goddamn kid Tony, and no one did anything, and your dad was-
With Pepper, it’s a little less violent, but a lot more dramatic. She ignores Steve for a week, and then shouts at him for an hour when she accidentally bumps into him in the kitchen, her voice echoing through the tower.
By the end of the day, his nerves have reached breaking point, and a headache is building behind his eyes. He doesn’t bother letting Obie know he’s left, he’s probably been watching him all day anyway.
It's the shock in his voice that makes Tony feel defensive, feel the need to explain himself, even though there's really nothing to explain.
If he ever comes back to the cafe that is, now that Steve has made such a monumental fool of himself.
The exhaustion is hitting him now, hitting hard, but he isn’t complaining as he sinks into the cushions, body relaxing.
And then it’s December 16th, a year after Steve came back, and for the first time in longer than he can remember, Tony feels lighter when he wakes up. He feels happier than he has in a while. But maybe happy is the wrong word. Maybe the right word is peaceful, calm.
Steve hits him lightly with the closest cushion, still blushing like mad, and Tony laughs again, the sound sending a shiver down his spine.
is the right word to use. He’d backed out of Obadiah’s company five years ago, and hadn’t had any desire to go back into weapons manufacturing. That hasn't stopped Obadiah from wanting him to keep in touch. Even after his mother's death, Obie had wanted to keep catching up with him, despite Maria being the person to really connect them in the first place. Or at least she had been, until Obie had hired him straight out of college.
He heads down the street, taking a shortcut to the left because if he’s going to be wandering around New York at 11pm to find junk food, he’s not doing it for longer than necessary.
Peter grins at him, and it’s shit eating. “You’re a mechanic. The Captain is the most talented agent SHIELD has, an assassin, and the legends say he’s probably a demigod.”
Steve clearly hasn’t gotten any better at masking his looks of surprise, but Tony doesn’t comment on them, and a minute later, they’re out of the back door. He lets the cool air hit him, something that has been tense all day uncoiling in his chest.
The man has his goddamn spies everywhere, and it’s sets Tony’s skin crawling. He once went through seven phones in a month, because he kept finding bugs on them. Now he has two phones. One is his personal one that Rhodey set up for him. It has three numbers on it. Rhodey, Pepper, and Happy. The bugged one is what he considers his work phone, and it’s for Obie, Howard, his mother, and anyone else.
He closes his eyes, tipping forward and resting his head against Steve’s chest. He can feel his heartbeat, the rhythm is steady and solid and
Tony laughs, burying his head in Steve’s shoulder and pulling him into a hug. When he speaks again, his voice is slightly muffled. “Well okay then.”
The rain is coming down hard now, but he can still fucking see Steve’s face and Steve’s eyes. They’re breaking him, because they’re in so much pain but they’re still so fucking innocent and god this is Tony’s fault, he should never have involved him in any of it. Selfish, selfish, selfish.
“Shouldn’t you be getting home, kid?”  Tony says quietly. He can hear the exhaustion in his own voice, and normally he would be working against letting anyone hear it, but right now he doesn’t care.
Eventually, Tony drifts off to sleep, but even unconscious there’s a shadow of a bone deep grief on his face. Steve shifts slightly, standing up, and gently lifting Tony, biting back a hiss of pain. He carries him through to the sofa, lying him down again and grabbing one of the blankets. As he goes to move away, Tony’s hand tightens around his shirt again.
“I know you always told me to be happy,” he continues, fingers brushing the faded name etched into the stone, “and I’m trying. I am, I promise.”
Tony laughs, and it’s humourless. “Don’t bullshit me. I’m going and risking my life to decode information for you. I’ll know more than anyone here by the end of this. I want all the facts, don’t pretend to be protecting me here.”
He takes a deep breath, adjusting his iron grip on the stupid amount of emotions that are making it had to get air into his lungs. He pulls the pair of dark sunglasses out of his pocket, sliding them on. He hasn’t worn them in a while, hasn’t had the need to.
Steve sits up properly, gritting his teeth at the flash of pain. It’s nowhere near as bad as it was before, but
A humourless smile twists Natasha’s lips. “Maybe he needs to pick your alter ego’s brain for something.”
He tries to put Tony Stark out of his mind. He doesn’t want to date, especially not this year when he’s only just passing his classes apart from art, and even the art doesn’t seem quite right at the moment, despite the goddamn
the movie, Tony is the one who is falling asleep on top of him. He can’t say he’s complaining, because Tony’s weight on his chest is strangely comforting. He can only see the top of Tony’s head, a mess of curls. The rest of him is covered in a giant hoodie (it’s
The eye of his teacher that he can see is dark. “I get the sense you’re not that sorry at all Mr Stark, but just don’t let it happen again.”
Tony holds up a hand. “One more thing. I found some bank transactions earlier. He’s been making transfers to known terrorist groups, presumably the ones who were getting paid to kill me.” He frowns a little. “I cancelled the transactions, hacked his account and shut it down. He won’t be getting anything else from selling under the table, and neither will the people he’s been paying off.”
” Nat nods towards Tony, who still hasn’t spoken, still hasn’t really moved at all, “is okay with that?”
Tony just looks at him, looks at him for a long, long time, and for a second, Steve thinks it’s worked, thinks he’s going to stay. But then he shakes his head and walks out without another word. Even before the door closes, he hears Tony speaking, already on the phone.
“Whiskey. Drinks.” The words are barely tangible, but it makes sense because they all have the money, so Ty paying the bartender to spike Tony’s drink can’t have been that difficult.
” Tony whispers against his mouth, and Steve feels like he’s floating. This is something he could do forever, he thinks. Kissing Tony is addictive, and he never wants to stop-
When he finishes work, he goes to one afternoon class (who the hell said Saturday classes were legal?) and then goes home. He shares the apartment with someone he only met this year but got on well with fast. Clint is in the shower when he gets back, so instead he collapses onto his bed.
Steve grabs his arm as he turns away, and Tony guesses it’s to stop him, to just get him to just wait for a second, but all Tony can think about is Howard grabbing his arm less than three days ago, and his head empties of anything other than panic.
There are sketches of New York, paintings of his friends, photos of what Tony guesses are his favourite places. Eyes, cuffs of sleeves, hands holding coffee, a flash of red hair. He can feel the effort in everything that Steve does, everything he creates.
Obie had said that when they’d died, had looked at him with empty eyes, hand closing around his arm in the way he’d hated more than anything.
So of course Steve has to be sitting right next to him. Steve, the barista he had asked out. Steve, the barista who had definitely
“She was driving. They were both killed instantly.” Obadiah says quietly. “They wouldn't have been in any pain.”
He only sees the Captain nod once before Tony is out of the door, bolting up the stairs to the room number Nat had texted him about.
His boyfriend turns to him, and there’s a nervous look on his face that tugs at Steve’s memory. He realises where he’s seen it before. It’s the same look Tony had been wearing right before Obadiah had knocked to deliver the news of his parents and interrupted what Tony had been about to say. Nervous. Hopeful.
Obadiah's shouts continue down the hall, rapidly morphing into threats that send a chill snaking down Steve’s spine. Threats aimed at Tony, at Steve, at
“I know.” He forces his voice to remain neutral, calm. “I know, sorry. I was talking to the Captain about some of the tech he needs repairing.”
Then he follows, makes another pot of coffee, and locks himself in his workshop for the rest of the day.
“Oh?” Tony says, and he only half cares. He left that world for a reason, the world of weapons and destruction.
He doesn’t move, and he knows his expression is blank. Knows it because there’s a look on Steve’s face that he never wants to see again.
“I’m putting Pepper in charge of the funeral arrangements, if you have any questions, take it up with her.”
When they reach the restaurant, Tony smiles slightly, because it’s another Italian place, and he’s pretty sure it’s one his mother picked. That’s at least one comfort for the evening.
She shrugs innocently, moving past him to take over his shift, smiling at the next customer with ease. He knows it’s fake, because it’s directed at the same woman who had come in last week and ordered five coffees, didn’t tip, and then called Nat something that nearly had all of them launching across the counter to kill her.
Tony smirks, and it’s razor sharp as he pulls the slim folder Pepper had given him out of his jacket.
He’s pushing back against an onslaught of memories. Ty’s mocking smile, Ty’s hands all over him, Ty’s laugh that still plays in his nightmares.
“It’s just-” His hands are soft, and Tony leans into the touch as Steve cups his cheek. So gentle, he’s so gentle. “It’s a lot.”
Steve just stares at him, taking another step forwards. Tony goes still as he moves, eyes wide as Steve reaches out to touch the bruise, gently running his fingers over the damaged skin.
His knees buckle, and Steve lunges forward, ignoring the flash of pain and catching him before he hits the floor. Steve lowers them both gently down into a sitting position, holding Tony tight.
“But,” She continues, “I think-” she swallows hard. “I think it has gone that far. Before. From what he was saying…”
“I’ve never done this before,” he murmurs against Tony’s neck, and he nods, pressing his lips against Steve’s gently.
Romanoff?” He whisper shouts, unwilling to attract too much attention. “Why the hell couldn't you have just
with his experiments. He keeps smiling, even though he feels sick. Throughout it all, Obie remains at his side, hand resting on his arm. As if he would risk saying anything here. He hasn’t for the past ten years, there’s no reason to start now.
Clint is on his feet in less than five seconds, which Steve finds somewhat impressive, considering how low he had been sliding down the chair a minute ago.
“I hate you both.” He says, but he’s smiling as he speaks, shaking his head. “I can’t believe you’re opening late just to make fun of me.”
“Hey, give him a chance.” Steve smiles at the first customer who comes in, turning back to Natasha. “Just… can we try this again. Maybe all go for drinks together or something.”
“No I-” there’s a second of silence, and Tony can feel his heart in his throat. “Who was that man with you in the cafe the other day?
to have him in his life. So instead he reverts back to the method of getting people to back off he’s actually good at.
is just a tiny bit of an inconvenience, rather than the thing that has guest starred in his nightmares for three years.
Steve tilts his head to one side. “Twenty three, and you’re one of the most successful businessmen on earth?”
She leads them to a booth at the back, and Steve feels so unbelievably out of place here amidst all the men in tailored suits and the fancy silverware. But once he sits down, he can feel himself relaxing slightly, because Tony’s eyes are on him, and he can feel the intensity of his gaze from across the damn table.
ended in sex. Girls, it’s always girls, and he’s always drunk, and they’re always desperate to spend the night with him. Most of the time, he’s not interested, not really, but it’s fine. As Obie says, he created a reputation for himself at college, and now it’s his job to uphold it, even if he never remembers the night. He always remembers saying yes though, so that’s something. Apart from with-
most people would pay for, and tries to ignore the fact that his heart is beating far too fast to be casual.
Maria, the one who had been the softness to Howard’s harshness, who had stepped between them too many times to count, who had sat with him through the night, taken him to the hospital, covered for him, protected him, loved him.
Steve blinks hard, everything that had happened over the last two days finally catching up to him, leaving him drained, exhausted. His arms tighten around Tony and he brings his hand up, gently running it through Tony’s hair.
The party is in one of the hotels his father likes to stay in. They’re downstairs in the bar, and the whole area has been reserved for this evening. He’s been booked into one of the rooms on the same floor, but all he wants to do is
This chapter is more of a love letter to you all (and to Steve and Tony) than anything else. This is the first multi-chapter fic I've written and completed, and I have loved writing it so much.
He makes a humming noise that passes for an answer, opening his eyes. The alleyway is still empty, thank god, because if he had to deal with the press and their opinion on Tony Stark having panic attacks at the age of 18-
The waitress brings their drinks, and Howard gives him a look that says everything when he takes the full glass Obadiah hands to him. It’s like standing on hot coals with the two of them. Please one, piss off the other. Frankly, he isn’t sure which is worse anymore.
“I trusted him.” Says Tony faintly, staring at the screen. He’s pale, Steve notices, and reaches out to take his hand, gently winding their fingers together. “I fucking trusted him. I hated him, but trusted him.”
Steve nods, not trusting himself to speak as Tony’s hand finds his waist, accidentally brushing over a bit of exposed skin. He doesn’t think he could form a sentence now, even if he wanted to. All he can feel is Tony. Tony’s hand on his waist, Tony’s fingers touching his, Tony’s eyes glittering with a secret amusement, like he knows something Steve doesn’t.
“No.” But despite the glare she shoots him, Steve knows there’s no malice behind it. “No free coffee.”
The boy, Ty, pulls away from where he had been whispering something in Tony's ear, presses a kiss to the hollow of his throat and smiles. Steve sees Tony flinch slightly at the contact, and every rational thought leaves his head.
He splashes his face with cold water, closing his eyes for a second. He feels more jumpy than he had earlier, and some of the numbness has faded. He just-
“Dinner. I really want to go for dinner, but I didn’t know how to say that in a text, and I was worried you didn’t actually want to and I still don’t know if you do or if you were kidding or-”
He remembers when the news had come in, around this time of the morning last year. The week following had been a blur of people apologising for his loss, shaking his hand and telling him that his father
Steve pulls away, taking his hand and tugging him into the bedroom, and Tony doesn’t hesitate before following.
He thinks something cracks, but he’s not sure. Red-hot pain lances through him, but he grits his teeth, turning to face his father again, and lifting his chin because that’s all he has the will left to do, all he
“You’re going to tear your stitches.” Tony says quietly, reaching out as if he’s going to touch him, and then pulling his hand back. “You need to rest.”
is making him feel a little lightheaded, because he loves him, but this is Tony Stark, and Steve knows that he flirts with pretty much everything that breathes. It’s not personal. It’s
“Always good.” Tony says with a quiet laugh, lacing their fingers together and leading him back to the sofa. “Now sit down and relax for a bit, okay?”
“Tony,” Obadiah says with a smirk, stepping into the hall. “You know your father doesn’t like you and Maria saying things he can’t understand.”
“Bullshit.” Says Fury, a quiet smile on his face. The smug bastard knows. He knows he’s won. “Shall we do some introductions? I feel like everyone should be on the same page here before we continue.”
Steve rolls his eyes, waving as he closes the door gently behind him, Tony's laugh still ringing in his ears.
“Okay.” Tony whispers again, and maybe he’s lying, Steve isn’t sure. All he knows is that both of their grips are tight, and there’s no one else in the world right now apart from the two of them.
Fury’s voice is still that blank calm. “We have it on good authority that the second in command is currently residing at that base. No names are in that file. Captain Rogers will be receiving a digital copy of the updated version later today.”
“Is everything okay? Aren’t you meant to be at a party with him right now?” He doesn’t try to hide the worry in his voice.
When he gets up to his office, (top floor, he wanted the bigger windows) Obadiah Stane is sitting at his desk.
Also, I am not Italian, so any Italian in here is a mix of three different translators and my friend who's taking Italian classes. If it's wrong, I'm sorry, and I swear I'm not trying to make anyone mad :,)
that it’s a shame we couldn’t finish it off this time. I’m patient though. Oh, and my father won’t be taking that business deal after all.”
Tony is a solid weight on his chest, a warmth that he can’t feel. He doesn’t remember falling asleep, but it happens at some point, slowly, then all at once.
He feels fifteen again, trapped, claustrophobic, and scared. His thoughts feel jumbled, and everything feels wrong, heavy, terrifying.
“Please,” he says, and it slips out because that’s horror that he can feel now. Obie could tear Steve apart, could ruin his life, could organise an ‘accident.’ He’s done it before, Tony knows he won’t hesitate to do it again. He doesn’t make empty threats.
“So you think it wasn’t an accident.” Steve finishes for him, nodding slowly. “Okay. So what can we do about it?”
Natasha pulls the paper out of his hand and starts to flip through it as information comes to life on the screen before them. Seconds later, Fury starts to talk.
“I’m fine,” Tony says, and it’s a lie, of course it is, but he doesn’t care because at this point, it’s all okay, and Steve is
Peter rolling his eyes, even if the kid is way too star struck to actually do it in Tony’s view. But then he deflates as Tony sits up, glancing over his work.
, who blackmailed Tony, threatened him, made him uncomfortable, controlled everything he could, pushed him into what ultimately resulted in him nearly having his worst nightmare repeated, and finally, tried to have him killed for nothing more than personal gain.
Now that he’s closer Steve can see the damage on his face in a lot more detail, and wishes- he doesn’t know what he wishes. That it hasn’t happened? Of course. That he had been there to stop it maybe, even though he still doesn’t know
“Nope. I was just finishing off work, but I can take it home! Tony was hovering, it’s probably a good idea that I leave now.”
“You need to go.” He says as soon as he’s within earshot, and watches the surprise flicker to life on Rhodey's face.
He glances back over his shoulder, a small smile rising on his face as he sees Steve lying asleep face down next to him, the laptop abandoned on the floor. He rolls back over, just letting himself admire the boy in bed next to him. He’s half in shadows because of the dark lighting in the room, but
He doesn’t know what time it is when he becomes aware of a low humming noise, and then he hears JARVIS’s voice.
The person in question folds his arms, dark eyes narrowed, and definitely not falling for any of Steve’s bullshit.
Point is, it’s usually an assumption, even if he’s not really sure it’s what he wants. Have a drink with Tony Stark, make out with Tony Stark, and fuck Tony Stark. In that order. Apart from Steve, who just wanted to watch a movie and kiss him and make him laugh. It makes Tony want to cry, and then protect him from the worst parts of the world.
Tony raises his eyebrows and Steve gives him a faint smile before walking out. The door clicks shut quietly behind him as he leaves, and Tony is left wondering if the conversation was really wholly real at all.
, just under the surface, but he’s ready for it now. He shoves it deeper. Breathe. Later, he can deal with it later. It won’t help now, even if all he wants to do is let go, give in, and let the storm drown him for a while.
Steve coughs, flushing bright red, and Tony takes his hand away before he can even blink. He’s leaning back slightly in his chair now, and Steve can see that every line of his body is a little more tense, even though his tone is even.
Obie shrugs. “Okay. I just had to ask. It was nice having you working with me. Maybe one day you can reconsider.”
“Shit,” mutters Rhodey under his breath. “Okay well Ty is someone I would love to rip in half, and he’s there. I just…I don’t want Tony to get hurt, so would you be able to maybe check up on him? Pick him up or something?”
This- he’s so frustrated he could break something. He’d been so damn happy because of everything, because of Tony, and now only because he refuses to open up-
But then Pepper knocks on the door of his lab, and she’s holding a paper bag filled with jam donuts and a cup of coffee, and she doesn’t say anything.  She just sits down, handing him the food and coffee wordlessly, and they sit in a comfortable silence for the rest of the evening.
Steve is lying next to him, arm stretched out behind Tony's head. For the first time in a while, he looks totally peaceful, expression almost serene in sleep. He can feel the warmth that Steve gives off, and itches to curl back into it, to just fall against him and sleep for another three hours.
Ty holds Rhodey’s gaze for a long few seconds, and then laughs, standing up and taking his drink and smirking at Tony.
There’s a flicker of a smile on the Captain’s usually impassive face, and it’s a secretive amusement, like he knows something Tony doesn’t.
“You like it?” Tony says close to his ear, breath warming Steve’s skin. “You said a while ago that you’d never done New Year in Times Square, so I thought I should change that.”
Happy laughs, and Tony manages a smile. He hired him two years ago, the one thing he’d had a choice on when it came to staff. Obie says he likes to pick people he trusts, but really that’s just another way of saying he likes to pick spies.
“I love you.” Tony murmurs against his shirt, hands pressing against his back like he’s afraid Steve is about to break. “I really fucking love you.”
Steve blinks, gaze clearing slightly. “Goodnight. I’ll see you tomorrow. Get some sleep, it’s better to be well rested”
As soon as the door shuts behind him, Tony exhales, turning around to face Steve. The burning anger is almost gone, a tiny sliver of it still lingering in his eyes. He doesn’t speak, just wordlessly leaning into Steve. He can feel Tony shaking, and he’s not sure whether it’s anger or fear, or maybe both.
“Fine.”Tony's tone is more even now, and he sounds pissed. Good. “Are we done here? I have work to do.”
And then suddenly, all at once, it crashes back into him with the force of a tidal wave. The party, Obie threatening Steve, Ty there, Ty giving him a drink. Ty-
After a lot of swearing and shoving, they finally break through to the spot the others have saved. It’s close to the front, but still surrounded by people.
That, and the whole working for a secret government agency deal, which he doesn’t intend to mention any time soon.
what Obadiah is about to say and he wants to yell at him not to, even though that won’t take away the truth-
Steve swallows hard, letting his hands drop. Too late now. The song comes to a close, and for a long moment, there’s only silence.
The job at the cafe might just be for extra cash, something to help with the stupid amount of student debt that he seems to have landed himself in, but it’s a job he enjoys, despite having only done it for a couple of days. On top of that, it’s only 10 minutes away from the college he’s at, which is a bonus for getting to class on time.
“Okay. Lead the way.” He doesn’t bother paying for the drinks. If Obie is spying on him, he can pay for them himself.
“Do tell,” Tony grits out, because the last goddamn thing he wants to do is talk about Ty fucking Stone and his silver tongue with Steve.
“I gathered, and I missed you too.” He says with a laugh, and Tony reaches up and gently kisses him again.
Tony is already moving, making his way over to the laptop on the other side of the room and bringing it over.
you're staying here.” He doesn’t give Peter a chance to respond, instead glancing over his shoulder again.
“That’s my life!” He shouts, and dimly, he realises that at some point the rain has started, because it’s New York in November so of course it has. The cold is a shock for a second, but he grits his teeth.
They would have taken him, tortured him until he broke, and then killed him. All so Obadiah Stane could have his moment in the spotlight, could get a tiny fraction of power back, could finally win.
“Rhodey called me last night.” Steve avoids his gaze slightly, looking at the tiles. “He asked me to pick you up because he was worried after leaving. Me and Nat came to get you, found you in the hall with-”
Tony doesn’t answer, just taking another sip of his drink. The mix of adrenaline and panic is making his head spin, and everything feels blurry, almost muted.
Tony closes his eyes, forcing himself to relax. It’s a name, just a name. The fact that Fury’s blackmailing him into revealing it doesn’t matter. The fact that the only people on the planet who know who he really is are Fury and Nat doesn’t matter. Even Obadiah doesn’t know.
He doesn’t recognise his own voice. The panic hasn’t hit yet, he hasn’t given it the chance. It’s just numb. Detached.
Ty smiles again, and Tony swallows down bile. Not here, not now, even though he can feel the panic crawling up his throat, clawing at his skin.
Tony nods, feeling a shiver of unease race down his spine. Everyone he interacts with knows him as Mr Carbonell. His mother’s maiden name had been an obvious choice for his entire life, especially once he’d decided to open Stark Industries. People knowing he’s Tony Stark can’t bring anything good. So Carbonell it is, and the myth and mystery surrounding Tony Stark and who he really is only grows.
When they get back to the tower and get out of the car, he feels a hand rest on his arm. He thinks he flinches, opening his eyes. Steve smiles sadly at him again, pulling his hand away. Tony doesn’t beg him to put it back, doesn’t beg him to stay, doesn’t ask for any of that because he knows it’ll only hurt more in the end. Steve walks inside, and Tony watches him go.
Steve looks at him, searching his eyes, and for a second the apartment is silent. Tony can feel his heart beating fast, and forces himself to relax. It’s Steve. It’s
He isn’t breathing, forces himself to start again. He doesn't know how Steve figured it out so fast, but maybe he's not as good at hiding as he had originally thought. In, out. In, out. His mother- she doesn’t know, and she never will because he’s just trying to
They try. They’re trying. Tony gradually, slowly, opens up his life for Steve again. He puts him in his old room in the tower, avoids him as much as he can.
“Yes to the question you just asked you idiot. Yes I want to move in with you, yes I want to live with you. Yes.”
“Thanks,” he mutters under his breath, grabbing a glass and filling it up with water, and giving Nat the middle finger as he catches her laughing.
They start to eat, and he is so glad for the distraction, for something to occupy his hands while he thinks.
“I don’t care,” and Steve’s voice is strong, calming. An anchor. “I don’t care what anyone says. I’m not letting you give everything up for me, okay? I’m not.”
There’s a heavy silence apart from the machines. He can feel himself drifting between a state of awake and asleep. The voice filters back to him, his brain taking a second to process the words.
Steve kisses Tony again, hands tangling in his hair. Then he closes his eyes, and lets the rest of the world fall away.
Tony laughs, and it’s light, happier than everything else he’s done since walking in. Something in Steve relaxes at the sound, and he lets his fingers trace over Tony’s shoulders, his collarbones. He wants nothing more than to stay with him here for the rest of the day.
He knows he fucked it up, because the look on Steve’s face will probably haunt him forever. The betrayal, the hurt, the sheer confusion because only hours before, Tony had been in his bed, kissing him, smiling.
“What happened to model student James Rhodes hm?” Tony says under his breath. “Listening to music in class now are we?”
“Nothing to concern you Stark. I need an answer from you both about this mission, yes or no, and I need it now.”
Steve laughs, and it makes Tony feel stupidly warm which is dumb so of course he completely ignores it.
right now. But art is something he loves, and he’s not going to fail at something he put half his life’s savings into.
“He totally did.” Says Sam with a grin as Natasha pushes herself up until she’s sitting on the counter top
Tony shrugs, playing with a strand of Steve’s hair, and shifting his gaze away. His forearm is covered in bruises today, but the long sleeves cover it completely.
Steve thinks, but he doesn’t say it. How can he? Tony is 18 now, and perfectly capable of looking out for himself.
Steve steps towards him, and there’s so much in his eyes and Tony can’t breathe because he fucking loves him but all he does is hurt him, even when he doesn’t mean to.
“To summarise. He wanted to sell weapons under the table to terrorists, knew I wouldn't agree. I was meant to be in that car, but I was here with Steve. So he killed my parents as a plan B, and organised with these same terrorists to kidnap me and kill me, keeping me out of the picture so that he would be able to take over Stark Industries. Did I miss anything?”
“He’s your father.” Steve’s brows are furrowed, and a part of Tony wants to reach out, to smooth the worry from his face. Another part of him wants to keep laughing because it’s not funny but he feels almost delirious right now.
Rhodey looks like he’s about to step in and argue, but Tony gives him a tiny shake of his head. Because he can’t do anything here, and Obie could destroy Rhodey’s entire career in a second, and it would be done without an ounce of hesitation.
Pepper’s face softens at this, and Steve goes around the table, grabbing the phone that he’d been looking at before she had arrived and sliding into the seat next to Tony.
He shouts, and his voice breaks, and now he’s crying too, tears mixing with the rain on his face. He can taste salt. “You fucking do from them Steve!”
“On what in particular.” Tony says, tilting his head to one side and keeping his expression carefully blank, controlled. He doesn’t bother to hide the annoyance though, not even a little bit. “He likes to push on everything.”
anymore because Tony wasn’t more goddamn careful. He would leave now, except Howard is blocking the door, and there's no goddamn point in running from this.
“I only wish you’d consider my offer Tony. You were a real asset to the company. I know I made a mistake-“
Steve drags himself into his afternoon classes after their late breakfast, even though there really isn’t anything he’d rather do
Nat shoots Tony a questioning look, as if she thinks he knows anything about this entire situation. He just shrugs in return, bringing his attention back to Fury who’s talking again.
“I love it,” Tony says with a quiet laugh, glancing around the room. “It’s personal.” There’s a pause, and Steve can see him looking around, taking it all in.
Tony won’t pretend it doesn’t make him nervous, but he’s always been good at hiding things like this.
Tony’s wearing jeans, Steve’s jumper, and sunglasses, but as he pulls the glasses off, they get a full view of the bruise spreading across his cheekbone, a mess of colours.
“Yeah Cap.” He says, and it sounds a little rough, a little imperfect. It’s still Tony, the voice, the eyes, the light on his face, his steady warmth that’s sleeping into Steve’s bones. “I’m happy.”
“So Hydra. They came onto our radar again relatively recently. Apparently those assholes don’t know when to give up. We’ve been putting spies in there for the last three months, every one of them has come back dead. I need people in there who won’t come back dead, who can go in and get the intel that is so essential. Their leader is currently anonymous, we need a name. Sources say they’re building up to something big, and we can’t stop it without more information.”
Tony leads him inside, smirking at the waitress in a way that makes something twist in Steve’s stomach. He’s
