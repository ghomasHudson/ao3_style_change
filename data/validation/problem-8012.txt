“Yeah yeah, go do your grading, Banner,” Tony muttered, clapping a hand on Bruce’s shoulder as he passed back his now-empty plate. “I’m just going to go offer Grant a penny for his most hot-and-judgey thoughts.”
Steve gave him another small smile.
Tony cocked an eyebrow and brandished one of the coffees threateningly. "Was that a very thinly veiled commentary on my age?"
"Tony!"
She sat down at one of the plush red couches and took another sip of her tea as Tony hovered by the coffee table, scanning the lounge furnishings that Pepper had chosen. At the time, she’d thought Tony would be living part-time at the facility as well, which might have been why she had decorated the residence in the same style as Avengers Tower. Tony brushed at the leaf of a flourishing philodendron and tried not to wonder who was watering the plants now that Bruce was M.I.A.
For a short Moment Wade didn't answer.
“Because I already read them, pirate”, Tony grinned widely, making Steve roll his eyes and the other avengers chuckle.
Wade still laughing loudly in the entrance of the kitchen, holding his stomach, turned back to the hallway and yelled in Peters direction: "Oh my God. Peter you told me your Dad was cool but I wouldn't have thought that he could be this funny."
"Oh my god. Did your AI just said that?" Someone laughed behind Tony, making him whirl around grabbing his chest.
„Sir, if I may“, Jarvis‘ voice rang through the hall. Tony waited expectantly.
Because Tony didn‘t want to bother both of them, after he heard their little... uhm sexy times? He decided to let them be, and threw himself into his work, completely forgetting the time. The next time he looked at the clock he blenched.
Steve sighed, resting his head on the backrest of the couch.
Wade had a blue eye. Angel a concussion, Norman has stomachache and well Ajax as blue marks on his upper body.
“She can smell it” Wade answered, pouting. “I know that because I made it with my unicorn plushy in the living room to see if she will notice it.”
I’ll be your lighthouse
"Thats why he wanted me to pick you up. Is he okay with you being together?" Steve growled.
The music stopped and not shortly after a slightly disheveled Tony came up the stairs. He wiped his hands on a towel smiling at Steve and Peter, but when he saw Peters pained expression and Steves thunderous one his smile fell and his heart sank in his chest.
Rhodey didn’t want to talk about it either and while Bruce seemed to have at least a small idea about what was going on, Clint, Natasha, Jane and Thor were just as clueless as I was.
“Hey, it’s okay. You don’t need to be afraid or something”, Steve smiled at me. This wonderful, wonderful smile, that reminded me of warm sunshine and sugar.
“Wade, you forgot your unicorn plushy in the living room, Peter, your Dad is here”, she said sternly, threw the unicorn plushy in Wade’s face, who scolded and then left the room.
I nodded even though I knew I wouldn't be able to go back to sleep anytime soon.
“It’s fine. Cry as much as you want, as often as you want essential you come either to me or to Steve when you feel sad or when something lays on your mind, promise me, okay?”
"Dad!" Tony heard Peter scream. "Dad. Why don't you save me! It hurts!" And he would just stand there, watching Peter turning to ash in front of him and he couldn't do nothing but watch.
They made their way out of the Shield Quarters as Steve came up to Tony and asked: “How is Peter?”
Relied flooded my body and I relaxed.
Dad screamed and let me go, so I finally managed to scramble out of the window and ran away.
With a smile I walked up to them and sat down next to Clint.
Did she cry?
I scowled and tried to get the plate back, but Mom was faster and soon I slumped back down in my seat, frustrated and pouting.
"No Tony. It really is not. Did they do that in the past?" Mrs. Rogers asked again. Her voice was hard.
All these things made me so much more frustrated when he rejected us that I got to the point where I just wanted to grab him and shake him until he wanted to be friends with us as well.
“It was just a dream”, Steve whispered to reassure himself. “Tony is not dead because of you, Steve, it was just a dream, Bucky is sleeping peacefully next to you, it was just a dream.”
Tony sighed when he saw this but I was determined to finally set things right with him, because I obviously misjudged him and behaved like an asshole towards him.
- Katie Sky, Monsters
Peter laughed as his father put a cooking hat on his head and then they started to try their best on the Pizza.
Rhodey and Pepper officially belonged to our group, but they were always there for Tony, even though he was kind of an ass sometimes.
"Uhm, well yes. After your little whatever in your room yesterday it was pretty obvious" Tony said, wondering why Peter would behave this carefully around him on this topic. He knew that Tony and Steve had nothing against Peter being gay. Obviously Tony and Steve where gay too, so why would Peter be afraid of him now.
And when you are not german you can write me anyways because I love talking to people and I am lonely. :)
“Guys please. No chatter!” Steve interrupted them.
Steve shook his head. “If my mum really needs help, she would not shy away of telling us.”
Oh, so Steve knew.
The school bell rang before anyone could say anything and, relieved that I had a reason to go, I grabbed my stuff and left the room. Still, I couldn’t forget the faces the others had pulled, because in every single one was a trace of guilt visible too.
Steves Mum raised one eyebrow in a silent demand, to really not do such a stupid thing, bevor she smiled a rueful smile and said: "Good, when this is all cleared up, I will make my way over to the police. See you all later."
“Hey Wade”, Peter smiled fondly kissing his boyfriend on the cheek.
”Sounds weird” I said. “It’s awesome” Steve answered. “Okay, if you say so” I replied. After watching though some other books and just enjoying the smell of the books we went to the counter and paid for the books we choose to buy. I’ve gotten some books on physics too and Steve wanted to read the story’s of 1001 nights, which dude... two books in bible format with over 2000 words... the fuck! But Steve was determined and bought them and then we went our way back to Steve’s home where his mum already waited with food for us. Spaghettis! Yum!
He put off the jacket, closed the front door and running up to his room he called all his friends via mobile phone, demanding them to be at his in less than twenty minutes.
Steves whole body shook and his voice trembled, when he said: "Tony is gone and if we don't do anything in the next hour or so, he will probably not be alive anymore."
“Okay”, Peter laughed and made his way over to the big kitchen table, sitting down and watching his father move around, trying to do the breakfast right.
“I am just glad, they put us in, in the plans and didn’t just move on their own”, Bruce mumbled.
“Yes Mrs. Rogers.” I smiled at her. “Thank you.”
"Out!" Steve ordered loudly.
"No! You will not!" Steve yelled. "Mum!"
“Don’t tell me it was planned! Just shut up! Do we mean nothing to you? Peter and me? How do you think we feel when we see you nearly dying again and again?! “
"Bye, Dad" Peter said, as he left the car.
“I would love to-“ Wade began as the door burst open and an old woman with white curly hair and dark sunglasses stood in the doorway.
He roared angrily and jumped after me.
"Wade!" Peter laughed and then went to go into the bathroom.
"Ugh gross." Peter scrunched his face up. "Now would you go out of the bathroom so that I can make myself ready?"
“Dad? What are you doing?” Peter asked cautious, slowly shuffling next to his Dad.
"Oh no, you won't", Peter said sternly holding Wades T-Shirt in a strong grip, effectifly stopping him from fleeing the situation. Wade rolled with his eyes but stayed put.
Steve slipped under the covers next to Tony and turned towards him.
In a blink of an eye I stood, my vision swam, but suddenly energy streamed in waves through my blood.
"You so cute, baby boo boo", Wade cued into Peters neck. Peter laughed. "Wade stop! That tickles!" Peter giggled and tried to put Wade off him.
I loved that sweater, my luck that the fabric was to thick my father couldn’t rip it apart. It was a small victory, but it was good enough that my father couldn’t destroy everything I loved.
“Then we must change his opinion!” Thor exclaimed determinedly.
"Your boyfriend happened", Tony pointed at Wade effectefly shutting Wade up.
He knocked the air out of me and I groaned loudly under his weight.
I was stunned, but couldn’t stop the small trace of guilt that was creeping up in the back of my mind because I had to admit, she was right.
Wades stomach felt like there where thousands butterflies flying around. He felt like that everytime he looked at Peter, seeing him, just thinking of him made him nervous. He coudn't understand what Peter might see in him, but he knew one thing: He wouldn't ever let any harm come to him. Peter was just too precious for this world, too nice, too forgiving and Wade loved him for that. Wade loved Peter more than he ever thought possible and he would try his damn best to no let any harm come to him.
"Of course you like Iron Man, he literally has your whole personality!" Steve rolled his eyes but grinned at Tony.
Tony carted his hand through his hair, making it stand up in all directions.
"Be careful" she whispered and then she was gone, leaving the group of kids in her house.
"I know you are here. Come out and play with me, Tony!" Dad laughed loudly. "You know the game with the belt? You were a naughty boy Tony. Making yourself comfortable in another ones house. Did you think I would forget you? Did you think I would just leave you alone?"
Tony laughed and Peter grinned happily.
Peter looked over to Wade who shrugged. He didn't look quiet comfortable with the situation either. Peters heart still beat hard in his chest and little rushes of adrenaline coursed through his body.
“I don’t want to go to Steve next week, Dad” Peter came down into the workshop.
“Mum, please help me, it’s Tony”, Rhodey sounded like he would cry any minute now.
School as always was boring as fuck. Nothing happened not even the group of dumbasses that usually tormented Wade and Peter during break did anything today. It was just trying survive the seemingly endless hours of boredom and lectures.
"Why I just love looking at beautiful people" Wade answered cheekily and made a kissing face towards Peter.
When Peter finally saw his Dad again, he looked terrible. Thin, sleep deprived, ready to cry all over again. He didn’t talk much with Papa, just nodding occasionally when Papa asked him if he was okay with the agreement.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What happened?” I asked.
“Hey motherfucker, what’s up?”
"Why would they do that?" Steve asked shocked.
Jane said from her spot on Thor’s lap and - what a miracle, they weren’t kissing for once!
For a moment I just stood there in the middle of the stairs and looked self consciously around not quiet knowing what to do with this information or how to convey it. I must have looked stupid.
“Because he is mean to you. He didn’t had the right to hurt you and break up with you two years ago and since then he does nothing but to give you the fault when I fuck up”, Peter whimpered, shortly before the first tear slipped down his cheek.
He tore his jacket from the closet and stormed towards the door.
“Steve, seriously, let me explain this, it wasn’t like usual it was di-“
"Yes" Peter said softly.
„No!“ Tony warned him, holding up a finger. „I mean it. Do. not. touch. my. stuff.“
His Dad didn't answer either, what worried him, because his Dad always answered accept he worked in the shop.
I am so sorry it took me so long! I had so much to do and still have but I couldn't let you all wait any longer so I finished this chapter as quickly as I could and please, don't be angry at me! It will take time till I update but i certainly will and I am so happy of all of your comments and kudos. They really keep me going.
Steve smiled at me softly. “Come Tony.” He said warmly and held his hand up to me. Grateful for the help I took his hand when I reached him and returned the smile.
“Okay, okay! I really started to like him more than a “normal” friendship, but it doesn’t matter, because he doesn’t love me, because I behaved like an asshole, okay!” I screamed and then hid my face under my arms.
I didn’t know what got into the others, that they suddenly seemed to like me, but I never actually had something like this before. Of course there were Pepper and Rhodey, but they often met with Steve and Bruce, Natasha, Clint, Thor and Jane.
Peter didn't know what to do! He just didn't know! So he tried to talk to his Papa, maybe he could save something, but he didn't even knew what.
“I love you too Dad”, Peter whispered.
Did this happen more often?
Peter, who just wanted to ask his daddy if he could help him built a really cool game play consol stood behind the workshop window and because the glass wasn’t soundproofed unless Tony put in the shut down mode he could hear his parents argue.
I rolled my eyes at them and was about to turn back to Bruce, who was still busy drooling over Betty, when I saw Tony Stark strolling into the cafeteria.
"You did that on purpose Jarvis", Tony growled.
They are all meeting at Rhodey’s this evening, but I didn’t wanted to come, even though they asked me.
Dad looked concentrated, his tongue sticking out in the corner of his mouth as he threw up the pancake out of the pan with one quick movement.
"Wow you're daddy is scary", Wade whispered when both he and Peter went out the kitchen door to the bathroom upstairs.
Yes, Rhodey was a good plan, his mother was nice and he helped me before.
“I am not in love with him!”
"Oh I think you would do it on purpose just to look if your hoverboard could actually withstand a wall", Steve rolled his eyes.
“Um... i actually only read one fictional book in my life, because dad always told me that fictional books are for baby’s and that I should read books that give me information about my job I will later have, so...” and this was the nice way to say it, I thought but didn’t say. Steve’s face darkened. “Well then it’s time to change that”, Steve growled. “Here”, he grabbed a book from the shelf and pushed it into my arms. “Take this one. It’s awesome and funny and you will love it.”
"No, please!" I pleaded.
I bit my lip. The flavor of blood spread over my tongue.
She called back from the kitchen,
I looked around warily, did anyone see?
“Now my friend Steven, I hope you managed further steps in your relationship with Tony”, he smiled widely.
“No shit Sherlock!”, Clint responded, rolling his eyes.
Peter was nervous, twirling his fingers with each other and his eyes moving around restlessly. He leaned against his boyfriend, seeking his warmth, before he answered: “They are going to discuss about Spiderman and Deadpool today, Wade.”
He smiled back at me when we passed us in the hallways, what made my heart flutter, though I would never admit that out loud. He helped Clint during math and they even started doing pranks together.
I tried to stand up and groaned because of the pain flaring up my back. I stumbled and my vision blurred and again Steve’s hand was there to steady me, before I fell. When I got my balance I snapped my arm away from his hand, as if it would burn me and glared at him.
"Thank you", he whispered. "I love you so much. Dad. Thank you."
"Ha, Ha, Jarvis", Tony rolled his eyes.
Then, I didn't even realized it, Mrs. Rogers stood up and left the room. I thought she may have said something to Steve but I was too occupied in holding Steve as close as possible that I didn't even heard it. Only as Steve slowly and carefully made his way out of my hard embrace I realized that I were only Steve and myself sitting in the room.
“Hey mom”, I said with a shaky voice.
Steve forced himself to look everyone in the eyes, just for a second, just to show them how serious he was.
“Hey Dad”, Peter greeted him and then hugged him. With his now sixteen years old, he was slightly taller than his Dad and he couldn’t help but point it out in every occasion he got.
“Come Rhodey, we are bringing him up in his room”, was the only thing I heard, before I dialed mom with shaky fingers and tried to slow my breathing.
I sighed before I left the store to wait outside for Steve. He paid for his comic books too and then we both made our way to starbucks.
Damn it, I really have to get my shit together!
“I’m sorry”, I whispered.
“You taste yummy” Wade licked his lips.
Sometimes he would talk to Bruce or Jane, because they were all science nerds and in this case the only ones who could actually understand him a little bit when he started rambling about equations and all this stuff.
“Nice, we uhm talked a lot and played Video Games.”
“Where is he now?” He asked silently.
“What, I was bored!” He defended himself.
As it turned out both Steve and Tony weren't impressed by Mrs. Rogers plan, but as they listened they realized it might be the only option left to really reach the goal they all had in mind. Tony being freed from his father grasp and in Tonys case no one being harmed because of his father.
"Sure. You sarcastic little fucker", Tony grumbled.
Half an Hour later the bed dipped and Tony climbed up behind him.
Steve helped Bucky, cleaning the table, before they both gave each other a good-bye-kiss and parted their ways.
“No, he only visited me when I was with Papa and I have my Game Console with you because Papa doesn’t want me to play it” Peter answered.
I have to go or he will do something really bad with me!
“Why would you even do that?” Peter asked horrified.
Pepper apologized for her outburst the next break, but when I asked her where Tony was, she shut down completely.
not worth it,” Steve corrected. “You think your life isn’t worth as much as theirs.”
“I’ll tell you what I’m
“My head…feels like a spike,” he managed.
If the gym weren't an extremely inappropriate place to ask someone out, Tony would have seen if he could get his runner's high in another way today. He slipped into the locker room and changed. He grabbed his wraps in case he decided to box, but with his focus all over the place, the treadmill seemed like a better idea.
“But why send them to –”
“According to Lord Banner, the markings on the knight’s shield don’t match any of the coats of arms on our muster rolls,” Rhodes continued. “I have Lady Romanov making inquiries among the newer arrivals at court and Sir Barton buying rounds of ale at the tavern, but so far, they’ve had no luck. If anyone in York knows the name of the knight who wears a silver star, they’re not telling.”
"Well, for one, the entire library is packed with people. It's like a Rolling Stones concert out there."
“You’re just picking that up now?” Steve smirked. “I thought you were supposed to be a genius.”
“Well that’s a relief,” Coulson replied.
“I have a biological tracker I’ve been working on,” Bruce put in, “undetectable unless you know what you’re looking for. We can use it to follow you.”
“Deflecting as soon as someone’s about to notice something nice about you.”
questions?” he asked them.
“Point of order,” a voice interjected, and Tony’s head whipped toward the source, because he’d be damned if that hadn’t sounded exactly like –
“Tony,” he said softly, and something in the tone of his voice made Tony’s stomach flutter and settle at the same time. “How are you feeling? Do you need anything? I was going to try to make you coffee, but —” He gestured ruefully at the machine with a small smile. “I might have accidentally changed its operating language to Klingon instead.”
“Are you hurt?” he asked.
“Ward brought us that disc,” Clint said sharply. “Does that mean –”
“That’s why you weren’t invited,” Tony agreed.
But the edges of his vision were closing in like a noose, and Steve was out cold, moments before he could see Tony fold upward into the form of Natasha. The phantom inspected Steve’s slumped body with a smirk, twirling the gun around her finger.
“It’s a tradition in Asgard to honor the exchange of emotional vows!” Thor boomed genially. “The Gjestebud for Fandral and Hogun lasted three of your Midgardian months, and songs are still sung about the many Asgardian children conceived on the final night of feasting.”
Natasha’s eyes narrowed, and Steve’s shoulders went rigid.
?” Tony repeated, his eyebrows shooting up.
“He’ll be fine, Tony,” Natasha assured him.
“Sunday, technically,” Steve responded, his eyes dropping to the thin sliver of skin that Tony’s stretch had revealed at his waistline.
“I had a real hunch that the case was connected to another unsolved mystery,” Tony was saying, “the disappearance of an IT researcher at a company called Omnisapient - but I was never able to find enough evidence to connect the dots.”
He gave a nod to Ward, who drew his gun and pointed it at Tony’s left leg. Steve fought the urge to lurch against the bindings again, knowing he needed to save his strength for the right moments, but he couldn’t stop himself from grinding out a curse.
“Yeah, and you’ll stay down, you big ugly bastard,” Clint’s voice announced.
“A soundproof one preferably,” Bruce put in plaintively from two doors down. “Some of us are very light sleepers.”
hadn’t hacked into Steve’s mission report, so there was no way he could have known that Steve and Natasha had barely avoided an explosion in the computer bay of the ship they’d infiltrated.
By the time they got to the banks, Bucky had been long gone, and Tony had been regarding Steve with an expression that reminded him of the night he’d dragged Tony up from the lab: a look that was both searching and guarded at once. Steve had seen that same look so often in the following weeks that he started wondering whether he’d given too much away. He knew how desperate he’d felt when he called Tony’s name, or as he tried to cradle Tony’s head with his arms – he could only imagine what he’d looked like from the outside. But he was so worried about protecting his own secret that he’d never thought to connect Tony’s wary expression with the decrease in Pepper’s appearances at the Tower.
It was Steve’s voice, and then it was Steve. He barreled into the room, pale and bare-chested, several ECG leads still hanging off his body. His eyes searched wildly until they found Tony’s. And when they did, Tony felt himself gasp at what he could finally read in Steve’s face.
"Just tell me what's going on."
“You mean
He narrowed his eyes at the decrepit house in front of them.
“I must have misread your signals then, because I was pretty sure you were interested in what I might do from the bottom,” Steve whispered, his lips teasingly close.
“I’m down here because I’m your friend,” Bruce said, softly but firmly. “And because you’re not the only one on the team who tries to avoid your problems by solving different ones.”
Something flashed across Ward’s face for the slightest of seconds as he saw Natasha pocket the disk, and then it was gone.
“Normally, I’d offer advice about how impossible it is to reason with a department committed to wearing shorts in all weather, but I seem to remember someone telling me - quite heatedly - that he could form his own impressions of his colleagues, so you can just consider that little rescue a one-time freebie.”
Suddenly, Tony felt drained, as if trying to hold that confession back had been the only thing keeping him standing. He slumped onto the stool behind him. His body was heavy with exhaustion and vodka and some muzzy-but-desperate yearning. For a second, he thought about finding something to weld or hammer – anything to put a little metal between the world and his abrupt urge to weep without ceasing – but his hands had started shaking, and he wasn’t sure he should risk it.
“I want you to have someone,” Steve managed, “who makes you feel at home – the way you make me feel.”
“It’s for Pepper,” Tony explained, “a running gag: she thinks it’s hilarious.”
“I’ve been trying to figure out what you’re doing here with him,” she replied. Seemingly unbothered by the gun Steve had trained on her head, she brushed by him and started to make her way down the ladder – the same ladder, Steve noted with annoyance, that had absolutely not been there minutes earlier.
“I guess,” Tony echoed. He felt about as unsatisfied by that account as Steve looked. But revisiting any of the other possible explanations still running through background analysis in his mind would require returning to the vision of Steve standing over him, a gun pointed toward his own head, and there was not currently enough bourbon in the greater metropolitan area to tempt Tony to confront
A huge thank you to everyone who has been reading, kudos-ing, and leaving words of encouragement. This was my first attempt at something like this, and every note has meant so much to me. Thank you for spending time in the little world of this fic!
“That’s cheating,” Clint protested, waving the arrow he’d just been using to pick off the marshmallows he’d lined up across the kitchen island. “We put electricity on the ‘forbidden items’ list after Thor fried half our pumpkins into a pulp trying to carve his with Mjolnir.”
He waved the napkin of biscuits experimentally.
"Anyway. The show is next Thursday through Sunday, and everyone volunteered to sell a certain number of tickets, and I was wondering if you wanted to go."
“No you haven’t!” Steve replied, his voice almost gleeful with relief. “See?” He wrapped his other hand behind Tony’s shoulders and pulled him up gently, moving slowly enough that Tony could feel the pain lessen as they went.
“Well how do you explain this then?” Steve asked. “Because when we were in the car, the house was completely dark.”
“Agent Ward,” Steve greeted him with a nod. “What do you have for us?”
"You know I'm going to leave it til Monday morning."
“That’s bullshit, Steve, and you know it.”
He left Bruce shaking his head ruefully and wound his way through the remaining crowd to the wine table, where Grant had gotten trapped by Eric Koenig from Philosophy. Grant’s eyes flickered to Tony’s nervously as Tony approached, and for a moment Tony was tempted to leave him to his fate.
“Could be worse,” Tony allowed, and he found, somewhat horrifyingly, that he meant it. He’d been chatting companionably with James ever since the snow bank, and it wasn’t making him feel like knocking himself out with a paperweight. In fact, it was kind of...nice, really. Almost cozy, after the adrenaline of hunting for the notebook and the stress of navigating the disastrous roads.
“I can’t,” Steve managed. “I can’t do this anymore.”
“Says the guy who hacks Nick Fury’s personal files twice a week.”
"Actually, you can have this one," Tony replied. "And my pie, and my weight machines, and probably all my summer funding or something." He turned away and stalked off towards the double doors that led outside. The weather had turned bitterly cold, and as soon as the frigid air hit him, Tony shivered.
“As much as I’m enjoying live-texting this reunion to Clint,” she said, “he says ‘get a room,’ by the way – do you think we could return to the security threat for a moment? You said someone was planning to use Barnes. Use him against whom?”
Tony took a deep breath before cracking the cover, sending up a prayer to the patron saint of archival miracles.
“You’re not in trouble, are you?” he asked James cautiously. “Because seriously, I wasn’t joking about the college’s life insurance policy, and the health insurance is even worse.”
“What are you saying exactly?” Tony asked, because the cold seemed to be making him sluggish, and it had been sixteen hours and twenty-three minutes since he’d last had coffee, so maybe the direct approach was best.
“But this is a wonderful event, my friends!” Thor boomed, and it sounded like he was getting ready to open his door until Natasha called out,
“Why would you do it?” Tony repeated, his eyes snapping up to search Steve’s.
As it turned out, only three people entered the room. But one of them was Sitwell, who was clutching a small device that looked an awful lot like the remote trigger for an explosive. The plans that didn’t involve “frontal assault” got a little fuzzy at that point.
Steve had downplayed the incident in the report that Tony hadn’t read, so Tony was instantly on alert when he saw the tense hunch of Steve’s shoulders and the iron grip he had on the edge of the counter. The water in the sink was running, hot enough to raise a small cloud of steam, but Steve seemed to have forgotten about it. He gave no notice of Tony’s approach, a slow flexing of his fingers the only sign of movement Tony could detect.
“No that’s my fault,” Tony replied quickly. “I should have asked.” He held out the hand with the ice pack. “May I?”
Steve nodded, leaning back against the chair until –
“I don’t have to follow him every time,” Steve muttered out loud. “It’s my New Year’s resolution.”
going to drink burnt drip coffee from the cafeteria for four years), and Steve had never learned to use it — being, as he was, one of those horrible people who leapt into their gym shoes and out the door for a jog every morning with no more fuel than a chug of Gatorade.
“I didn’t know the answer to that question until Hill told me about HYDRA’s demands,” Coulson replied, and something had shifted in his voice in a way that sent a shiver of warning up Steve’s spine. “They want you to be the one who brings them Fury and the files.”
He’d managed to wait to confront Tony until they’d made it out of the gala and back to the Tower, but it had been a close thing. Waves of adrenaline were still coursing through his body every time he remembered the moment, halfway through the dessert course, when he’d looked back from his scan of the dance floor to see that Tony had disappeared from his side. In the ten minutes before Tony reappeared again – hands full of whiskey sours and a blonde socialite in a plunging red gown – Steve had told Happy to seal the exits, called Fury to have agents on stand-by, and barely stopped himself from clasping Tony’s arms in relief when he finally recognized his voice. The more time had passed, however, the more the relief had given way to frustration. And by the time they made it back to the penthouse, Steve could feel his teeth grinding at the casual way Tony was tossing his jacket over the back of the couch.
Steve stared at him, the events of the past months rearranging themselves in his mind like bones reknitting after a break. Tony pinched the bridge of his nose with a sigh, and Steve could tell he was about to wave the whole thing off again, so he made another leap.
“Covered in crab dip and bomb residue?” Tony asked.
"Yeah, you'd better swear." Tony spun on his heel and marched down the row to where Darcy was now looking resigned to her fate. "You know what I'm going to say, and you also know I have to say it anyway."
“Status check,” Steve called.
The smile dropped suddenly from Steve’s face, his eyebrows pinching together suddenly as if he were in pain. His jaw clenched, and Tony felt his heart sink. So much for the hope that he’d just gotten a socially acceptable amount of wasted: he must have done something really humiliating to make Steve feel so frustrated and uncomfortable.
When they finally broke for air, it came in sharp pants, and Steve had to squeeze his eyes shut against the heady relief of feeling Tony’s breath brush over his lips.
“Tony!” Steve yelled.
“What?” Tony asked, pressing one hand to his chest in a display of innocence. “How will I ever get better, Brucie, if I don’t engage thoughtfully with my toughest critics?”
“Get the hell out of here? I think that’s what I’ve been saying.”
“Congratulations,” Natasha announced wryly. “You’ve finally broken the code. I hope you enjoyed playing along: the theme of this escape room was ‘basic emotional communication.’”
“The water’s coming in too fast, Nat,” Steve said calmly. It was up to his thighs now, and he could feel the pins and needles starting to stab up his legs. “If you open the door, it’s going to capsize the whole rig. I need to you and Clint to get Tony out of here.”
territory here.”
The memory of that fight had joined the list of visions that Steve tried to beat out of his brain by pounding them through punching bags: the image of Bucky shoving Tony’s face plate to the side, wrenching at the casing of the arc reactor with his metal fist. Steve had been able to get the chip in place in time to pull them apart, but not before the connection between the reactor and the suit had been damaged. Tony had been helpless when the carrier started to go down, and Steve’s heart rate jumped every time he remembered his mad scramble to get Tony out of the suit or his struggle to shield Tony’s body with his as they hit the water.
He pulled a USB drive out of his jacket pocket and placed it on the kitchen island.
“My best friend,” Steve answered finally. “Bucky. Our unit was conducting a rescue operation, and we got pinned down, took shelter in a general store. A missile came through the window and landed just feet away from me. It didn’t go off right away, but I was afraid any movement would trigger it. Bucky was already hurt: he’d taken a bullet to the thigh the day before. I told him to get out, and he didn’t.”
When Steve did wake up, it wasn’t on a couch or a bus but in a hospital bed. He felt it before he saw it: the rough drag of overwashed cotton against his arms, the soft tug of plastic on the back of his hand, and the pit in his stomach that warned him of what was missing from the room.
He kept going with his exploration, letting his hands travel lower along Tony's thighs, his knees, his legs, then up again, skimming his inner thighs. He still didn't touch Tony's cock, though he let the fingers of one hand brush against his balls.
"Nothing," Steve replies. "I made sure of it. You need the day off."
He feels like he should be apologizing to Steve for what he did to that other Steve—or whatever other name the other SR100 used—but he has no idea how Steve would take it, and Steve seems so fascinating. Tony wants to know the full story of this mysterious prototype model, and to understand why such a superficially perfect being would be abandoned to gather dust in some warehouse, or end up in a terrorists' lair.
"Now that is a longer story," Fury said. "Are you sure you don't want to sit down?"
Tony sighed and pressed his forehead against the bars. With his keepers' taking away their bright lantern, the room was illuminated only by a much smaller one hanging on the wall close to the doorway, its light barely reaching the furthest corners of Tony's cell. The back and left walls of his cell were stone, with no windows, while the bars of the front and right walls were spaced closely enough that only the tiniest of dinosaurs would be able to slip past them. There were four cells in total: one next to Tony's, two across on the other side of the corridor dividing the space.
"Nah, nothing like that," Tony said quickly.
"Yes, we noticed that." Natasha gave him a brief smile that faded as soon as she went on. "I meant what I said earlier, Steve. We won't tell you what to do. If you want to walk away from all this, you can. We'll give you what information we have on your surviving teammates to help you get started."
He was floating in a void, like a really trippy virtual reality. He was caught in an electrical storm, every nerve on fire, just at the edge of painful, but just as it was becoming too much, it melted, transforming into warmth, into a feeling of being more relaxed than he'd been in his life. He didn't have a body anymore, he just existed in a state of deep satisfaction. Time had stopped; there was nothing but this moment.
After a few endless seconds of freefall, Steve pulled on the activation cord, and the pack on his back hummed to life, quickly stripping him of the momentum he'd gained. After the first few near misses, all cars were giving him a wide berth, probably having gotten a hazard warning from the others. Of course, there was also less and less traffic the lower he got, and he floated down the last fifty meters or so without a single vehicle in sight.
Could it be as simple as that? For all Tony's worries that something was irreparably wrong, was this only the awkwardness of that unbidden hard-on?
"Don't worry, I won't break my promise. I won't look," Steve reassured him. His voice sounded husky in his own ears.
"It was a sobering experience. It came to me that if I kept going as I had been, I'd definitely be fulfilling that prophecy of not living to be very old at all, but maybe it wasn't too late to change things. I decided to take up a strict exercise regime as soon as I'd recovered enough. It was during one of many easy walks through the park that I had the idea of tackling the great outdoors. Rhodey, who had always been more interested in the natural world, was excited to hear of my idea, and soon, we were planning our first proper trek. From the start, there was the thought at the back of my mind that maybe there was a solution somewhere out there, some way to escape my fate.
The red has faded to yellow on Steve's temple once more. "Lower chances of survival, though?"
"It's just for tonight, we can manage," Steve said. He was used to cramped sleeping arrangements—during the war, they'd been the norm more than the exception.
"The people I talked to told me he was brought in around three weeks ago," Natasha confirmed. "No one had seen him since, but there are rumors that he's building something for the Northerners."
"Yes, that's true," Lina confirmed. "Did she tell you why?"
Tony's just discovered that he can finally move his mouth and his hands again when Steve returns and sits down next to him.
Tony offered all the Avengers a place to stay at his Tower. Bruce was the only one who took up on it right away. Clint and Natasha already had their living arrangements with SHIELD, and Thor wasn't on Earth right now.
His frame had died, but he hadn't. He'd been sure he would. He'd failed everyone—
He tried to keep going as fast as he could. The footsteps behind him were getting closer. The Northerners were gaining on him, no matter how he tried to hurry.
He tried to say "no," to explain to her that he couldn't, that she didn't understand that if he fell asleep it'd be the last thing he ever did, but all that came out was a groan.
After he'd given up any hope of finding Tony today, Steve had come across him by accident, in the most unlikely place imaginable.
"There's another option. We could work one of the doors off its hinges," Rhodey suggested, waving a hand towards the heavy iron joint connecting the door to the wall.
Steve had to admit he'd thought that, too. With the very fancy house, it seemed like the obvious conclusion that the man opening the door would be an employee. "Sorry, I didn't mean to presume," Steve said, and held out his hand. "Pleased to meet you, Mr…"
Checking over Tony's body cursorily to see if there are any obvious injuries, he doesn't find anything aside from some abrasions on Tony's palms. His clothes are soaking wet. It seems like it's the weather itself that got to him: hypothermia, from the constant cold, wind and rain.
"Okay, I know where you all stand," Tony said, clearly not convinced, frowning, his lips pursed. "I think I might still take a day to think about this."
"Not a clue," the man said curtly. "I'm not his butler, nor his chaperone, like plenty of people seem to think. Sometimes, him included."
"You must be wondering why we've been killing off Stane's Tony-clones when all that'll achieve is that he moves onto another one," Pepper started. She was sitting on one of the bar stools, still wearing business clothing that was at odds with the surroundings.
Saying goodbye to Thor and Steve outside the shiny new Avengers complex, he felt more relieved than anything else, even if it was mixed with some nostalgia from Steve. That had to be all Steve's. Tony wasn't nostalgic.
"Works for me. Hands up," Steve ordered Tony, who obeyed, letting go of Steve's pants so Steve could strip his upper body. "You're beautiful," Steve told him.
"You're not worried that if he's behind everything, he'll try again today?" Steve asked cautiously.
"We're about to take off. ETA ten minutes," Natasha said in Steve's ear.
His lips still glued to Tony’s and his back turned towards the window, Steve flicked his middle finger at Bruce.
Tony hummed, his fingers clenching and releasing the fabric of Steve's slacks. "What's it like?" he asked, again in that more hesitant way, his voice sounding fragile. Unfortunately, Steve had no idea what he was talking about.
"If you don't take it, you'll only have even more difficult options left. If you go for a secret trial, there's no guessing what the outcome might be, and they control so much of the system, there's only so much I can do to help," Nelson elaborated, summarizing what he had already said earlier during the meeting . "And if you make everything public, they'll fight you tooth and nail, every step of the way, twist everything you say to turn public opinion against you."
Tony stands up as well, and even manages to do it without tripping on his strange blanket or wavering too much, even though he feels woozy from whatever sedative is still in his system. "I would've preferred for you to leave me alone. How were you even around to butt in? Why would you be in Norway?" Tony frowns at Steve, his simmering anger rapidly building up towards fury that's ice-cold and white-hot at the same time. "Have you been stalking me?"
He'd even let himself get a little excited about it. He'd thought it'd confirm what he'd already guessed. Instead, he'd gotten the opposite: an impersonal form letter telling him that at this time, no one in the database matched him. It'd come with a disclaimer that like all genetic tests, this wasn't foolproof, and also that the negative result didn't mean there was no one out there for him, just that their data wasn't currently available.
"Not yet, no," Tony says.
Tony pursed his lips, glanced away, and then looked at Steve again. "Well, us. I've been thinking about this before, really, but it's just that tonight—you know, when I saw you lying there, dead to the world, I realized I should say something," he explained, looking younger than ever, vulnerable, his eyes glistening. "I mean, you've got all these dangerous assignments—"
It's an android. It's never really been alive. But it's also not the machine-equivalent of dead; its thirium pump is still running, its blue blood circulating through the tubing analogous to veins and arteries.
Tony woke up with no idea of where he was, except that he had to be outside: even with his eyes closed, he could feel the lovely warmth of sunlight on his face and his bare chest. The surface beneath him was more uneven than the floor of his cell, and his back rested against something lumpy.
Steve let the curtain slide closed and turned around to face Bruce. He couldn’t have looked less like the Hulk if he’d tried: arms crossed, shoulders hunched, eyeing the floor as if he wanted to sink underneath it. That certainly didn’t make Steve feel better about the situation.
This couldn't be Tony, not really. Tony had changed, but to go from irresponsible and ignorant to someone who tortured people—no. No matter how much grief and stress he'd faced, no matter how many years had passed, Steve couldn't believe that of him. But this person also felt too similar to the man Steve had spent the past few days with, too knowing, to be someone else hired to torture Steve while wearing Tony's face. This had to be the same man, and whoever he was, he wasn't Tony.
"Not mine, either," Steve admitted. "What brings you here tonight, then, if you don't mind me asking?"
This time, Tony didn't try to stop him, but just asked, "If you don't, you'll let me know, right?"
"James, I know you're having a difficult time with everything that's happened, but I think it's time you learned more about where you are. There are some things you need to know," she said, pulling up a chair to sit by Bucky's bed.
He also wasn't entirely surprised that she wasn't on his mind when he closed his eyes, certain he'd never open them again. It was Steve, instead, and all the pain that this would save him.
It's no more and no less than what he deserves.
Steve stood up, letting the police officers move in to contain Stane, and returned to Tony's side. "Ultron? You release him right now. You've lost, anyway," he ordered.
Steve settles into a defensive posture right next to Tony, his arms crossed. "What talk? What were you expecting?"
"I'm not going to give up hope quite yet. Perhaps you shouldn't, either, Captain," Pepper said. It was almost as if she were comforting him; he'd expected it to be the other way around.
As answers went, Bucky found that entirely unconvincing. "So, do you think humans that you find ugly are also evil? What about those who lack a limb?" He raised his metal arm for emphasis.
"It's not," Bucky replied quickly as they started walking in the direction Steve had suggested. "I mean, it's a surprise, but I don't mind. Tony seems like an amazing person. I'd like to get to know him better. You came here to rescue him and the dinosaurs, right?"
Tony feels his heart skip, slow down, the pauses between beats growing longer and longer. The air feels too thin.
Steve woke up again, still in his bed, and yet, not in his bed. He knew he hadn't been naked when he'd gone to sleep, like he was now. The room looked like his, with all the furniture as it should be and the bed sheets the same ones he'd gone to sleep in, but the shackles chaining his wrists and ankles to the bedposts had definitely not been a part of the decor. He yanked at them, but as he'd expected, they were solid. He didn't think he'd be able to break them, no matter what.
Tony jerked at the impacts and cried out in pain. In the light of the flames, Steve could see the dark stains spreading over the front of his coveralls. He'd been hit at least five times, and there was no doubt in Steve's mind that they were the kinds of wounds no one could survive.
At the Kingpin's command, more men had raised their guns, and the next volley of bullets caught Tony in the chest.
Tony just grinned. "Nah, I'm great. It's a quirk. I have a naturally high body temperature. The only fever I've got is for you." Tony brought his other hand to Steve's tie as well, and started untying it. "You think you can take it?"
"I don't mind. I really don't," Tony said, his fingers playing with the stubbly hair at the nape of Steve's neck. "That's the reassurance I needed. That you'll be careful."
Sam was still eyeing him with some concern, but didn't push it. "There's coffee, if you want it," he said instead, raising his mug at Steve.
Really, he'd rather be dealing with terrorists; facing actual bad guys would be a much simpler situation, one where he could just focus on surviving and escaping.
He opened his eyes, expecting harsh light. Instead, there was a soft, orange-tinged glow, like a sunrise, which seemed to originate from the entire surface of the ceiling above him. Turning his head slightly revealed that some of it actually radiated from the walls, which were showing a pastel-tinted cloudscape. Even though it was beautifully executed, almost resembling a Romantic painting, it was still tacky, and not at all what Steve would've expected either from SHIELD or from whoever had set that trap for his team.
Steve couldn't imagine how Tony would feel about the situation. He'd always been affectionate towards his AIs and very open to all kinds of technological innovations, but at the same time, he'd spent his entire life in one body. Even if it'd been hanging by a thread towards the end, it must still be a strange and disturbing thought for him that it was gone.
Tony didn't let him finish. "But this is the part where you tell me that you don't feel the same way." He stood up, facing the door. "I should probably go."
"Tony?" he tried. "Tony? Rhodey? Come in."
Steve was all too aware of that, but he couldn't see what else he could do. He glanced towards the doorway, and like she'd promised, it was now shimmering and outlined in glowing golden light, a portal to take them back to the real world. He could just grab Tony and carry him out—but with Natasha's earlier warning that Tony should go willingly, that was probably a bad plan.
Steve’s lips felt perfect against his, so good, so hot. He wrapped his arms around Steve, pulling him closer, hooking his ankle around Steve’s leg, clinging to him.
Even if this last-resort plan worked, it would only allow him to free himself. The dinosaur prisoners would still be stuck in the dungeon. No matter how much he'd racked his brain for a solution to freeing them, all he could come up with hinged on James. He knew there was an obvious alternative to having James on his side: he might be able to take the younger man by surprise, knock him out and steal the keys to the cells from him. But that was something he didn't want to do, because it would feel like lowering himself to the level of his enemies. Besides, he wasn't sure if he could pull it off, considering how weak and tired he constantly felt.
Still, right now, the truth was that Steve was tired, in pain, and more than a little unnerved—and he knew that Tony knew, and that was fine. He wasn't going to deny it.
"All that can wait. I think I should let you rest now," Steve says, and shifts to get up.
"So this is legal, now? Stealing someone's likeness without asking them?" Steve asked.
"Steve?" Pepper addressed him again. "Brace yourself. In three, two, one—"
It didn't take him long to bring Steve to the edge, both figuratively and literally—leaning back to push his hips forwards, he wasn't far from slipping off his perch, his free hand clinging to the cushion beneath to stay in place.
"So, why, exactly are you here?" Tony asks as he settles down on the couch.
Bucky steeled his shoulders and pushed back the pity. "You'll have plenty of time to rest when I take you back to your cell," he announced, hoping it sounded convincingly stern. "Back to work, now."
So it was Clint then.
“I am sorry mister, but you are not going before you healed completely.”
I watched Pepper try to pull off Tony’s hood, but he just slapped her away and then turned towards me and our eyes locked.
“Sit up, boy! Back towards me!” Howard ordered.
"True."
Tony looked around with furrowed eyebrows.
Peter didn't answer but he didn't need to because Wade knew he got the message and would act accordingly. Instead he choose to write his Dad, warning him of Steve.
"No" Steve growled and then the car stopped.
"He won't, Tony. He can't." Steve answered. There was sadness in his voice and a strong determination. "I won't let him."
Mr. Forge stopped and raised a questioning eyebrow at Wade.
“No, its not, we are going to talk about that” Steve growled and then ignored Tony the whole way through the debrief until he was alone with him in the workshop.
Steve looked at Bucky who had settled down next to him. He shrugged.
Tonys heart stopped. Everyone knowing. All his life he tried to hide this dark painful secret from everyone and now they should all know.
“Is everything alright?” I asked when they were close enough to hear me.
From the corner of my eye I saw Tony stand up, his food untouched.
I walked a little bit over ten minutes through the city, until I saw his house at the end of the road.
“That is indeed tragic, because I hoped he would attend our meeting this time”, Thor scowled.
“Don’t pout, just promise you won’t eat so fast when I give you back the plate and tell me something about your school day,”
"Oh Steve" was all his mother could say as she came up to him and knelt down next to him, stroking his back. "Its okay. Everything is going to be fine."
Tony growled.
"As if that would happen!" I crossed my arms over my chest.
Love you all.

Steve followed us and came into line next to me, grabbing my hand in his and smiling warmly at me.
"No." Steve took a step backwards and pulled Tony near him. "You can't be serious! That... We can't let that happen. Tony" Steve turned around. "Tony I won't let that happen. I won't let you go!"
“Maybe Anthony catched a cold,” Thor thought out loud.
I poked him in the side and wiggled my eyebrows at him, which caused him to blush an even deeper shade of red, if that was possible.
“Yes please”, Peter answered just as he finished tying his shoes.
I imagined him saving me, telling me that everything will be okay now, that he will protect me and my father will never again get near me. Maybe even tells me, that I am not worthless and stupid, but that would be too much. It was just daydreaming after all.
I smiled at that, however when I realized what I just thought I blushed furiously!
“I know Tony, but I also know that you work all the time and I know that Peter stays up longer than he should during school, when he is with you. It’s not your fault, it’s just how it is okay and you know, children, teenager whatever, they get more aggressive when they didn’t sleep enough. How long did he stay awake yesterday?” Steve asked in the end.
"But we can't! We can't let him do it Mum!" Steve yelled.
“How can you say that? Do you no respect my unicorn plushy? Shame on you, just shame on you Peter!” Wade dramatically shook his head.
"What? What can we do?"
Curious I read the front title. “Hitchhikers Guide to the galaxy” it said.
“Don’t say it”, Bucky put his hand in front of me, as if this could stop me from saying anything, “If I hear you saying, that you behaved like an asshole, one more time, I am going to punch you in the face.”
"We actually have to do homework", Steve said with a boring tone in his voice that showed just how much he would love to do them.
"Hello darling!" Dad laughed and threw the door open.
Tony and Steve had been a happy couple. They were like fire and ice, like heaven and hell, like yin and yang, so different from one another but still fitting perfectly.
I sobbed loudly.
It wasn’t fair to take Tony Peter away this week equally as to take Peter Tony away.
"Tony!" Someone yelled again and this time I recognized the voice.
"I have to Steve", Tony cried.
“Dad, I am sixteen years old, I really don’t need a good night kiss anymore” Peter laughed and then turned around in his bed as his Dad stood up and left.
Shortly after eight we left the house and made our way towards Shield High. Steve was a fast walker so I skated beside him on my long board to catch up with him.
I called, when I went through the front door.
It was warm outside, the sun shone brightly, birds chirped and people happily made there way through the streets as Steve and me sat down on a bench in the park to drink our coffees in peace.
“He did nothing Papa. Why do you give him the fault, when it obviously happened in school were Dad couldn’t have done anything!” Peter defended his Dad.
"My turn" He grinned.  Wade raised an eyebrow.
He always seemed to know everything better, couldn’t stop making jokes out of everything and everyone, was always out partying and drinking and slept with everyone.
Tony had tried to talk to Steve, over and over again, asking him if he was serious, if he really wanted to do that, oh please Steve, think about it, I love you, I love you so much.
"No stop it!" I covered my ears and groaned loudly.
“Hmm, then you maybe should invite him to the mansion some time” He shrugged with his shoulders.
“The Avengers, Wade, they are going to discuss about us, if they are going to see us as threats or if they want to recruit us.”
"Mmh", I moaned into his mouth.
“Nope!”, I replied before I could think about it.
“I made your favorite food today.”
Its a good thing Dad made it Captain America proof, Peter thought.
I just shrugged and Natasha shook her head.
"Its Tony Mum! He is gone!" Steve stopped for a short moment, turning towards his Mum. His eyes where desperate and there were tears in them. "He is gone Mum." He whispered and sobbed, all dams broken. Steve fell down on his knees crying openly. "He left! He just left Mum! He promised but he left and..." Steve cried.
“What are you reading?” He asked, ripping the comic book out of Peter’s hands.
“Hey, Tony it’s okay”, Steve whispered and pulled my chin up. He smiled at me and I could feel my heart stutter. “Don’t worry, they like you just as much as they like anyone else in the group. Don’t be afraid. We will see hs later in cafeteria Okay?” I nodded, still blushing. Did they really like me? Steve gave me one last kiss and then disappeared down the hall to his art classes with Darcy and Jane.
"Everything is going to be alright, Peter" Wade whispered and grabbed Peters hand, squeezing it to show his support.
"Dad", I gasped. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... Please, no. Gosh, please don't let it be him, don't let it be him!
“What?” Ajax shot him an evil glare.
“Mum! Mum! You have to help me!”
"No need to apologize, I feel the same, but we can't let our emotions cloud us now. We need to do something. And because I have to go to the police personally to get their asses towards Tonys house, I need you all to behave and not go there on your own, getting footage of what happens there and saving Tony from his fathers grasp. Got me?"
Peter crunched angrily with his teeth. Why did his Dad always put up with the shit Papa tells him? He always takes the blame on himself and Papa always throws the blame on Dad! Why? This is soo unfair!
Peter not focusing on his surroundings realized only now, that Steve drove Wade home.
“That… is dramatic”, Wade answered.
Pepper giggled and Bruce hid his grinning face behind his hands.
She glared up at him.
I hope you all had a wonderful time and got wonderful presents! ;)
There was a short pause before Peter heard his Dad whisper: “Okay, try to sleep” kissing his head one more time, before they both fell to sleep.
“Pancakes!” He answered happily and showed him a plate full of little distorted pancakes. “J helped me, I think they didn’t taste too bad. I wanted to let you sleep a little bit until I finished breakfast but now that you are here, just settle down, I will bring you your breakfast.”
"Of course you can, of course. Just... come." He held out his hand for me and again I took it gratefully letting myself be helped to stand up and lead to Steve's bed.
“Look what I learned while you slept”, his Dad said after a while and then moved towards him with a pan in his hand.
Steve rolled his eyes, making Peter angry. Why would he always be annoyed by everything Tony did? Why would he always blame Tony? It wasn't fair! Why would he do that? Peter had heard Steve talking to Bucky once when Tony was injured by a mission, telling him about how worried he was about Tony and Bucky telling Steve that he still had feelings for Tony and Steve not denying it, just apologizing to Bucky. Peter knew for a fact, Steve still had feelings towards Tony, he had seen the pictures of Tony in Steves sketchbook. It was full of pictures. He knew Steve had little pictures of Tony everywhere in secret. He found one where Tony laughed at a joke someone said underneath Steves pillow. He found one in Steves car, where Tony looked concentrated while baking, splattered with baking pouder. He found one in Steves briefcase where Tony just smiled dreamly at something or someone... Peter liked to think it was Steve he looked at. It didn't matter, what mattered was the fact that Steve still held feelings for Tony and that Peter just couldn't understand why Steve would try to hurt Tony everytime he had the chance.
Luckily for Steve, Thor chose that moment to pick up Tony’s water glass and smash it onto the floor with an emphatic, “Here, here!” Steve took advantage of the distraction to jump up and grab the broom.
"I won't keep you long, but I have something you really need to know, and it honestly can't really wait."
“How about we ditch these suckers and head for the roof?” he asked, brushing the hair back from Steve’s forehead in a way that sent a ripple of goosebumps across his skin. “It sounds like we missed some stages in your plan, and I’m willing to be extremely thorough in retracing our steps.”
“It’s a pretty common way to go, Steve,” Tony said gently. “I know our lives carry some pretty strange risks, but that doesn’t mean we get to skip the everyday variety.”
The woman spent a good few minutes examining the coat, squinting at the fabric, even sniffing it. "It's a very nice coat," she finally announced. "What would you be asking for in exchange?"
Steve frowned. "So, you're not going to bring Stane to justice, or expose his crimes to the public eye?"
"Never mind. Something from the outside world," Bucky said, with a dismissive wave of his good hand. "Anyway, plenty of animals look scary but are actually peaceful and just defend themselves when threatened. What makes these dinosaurs so different?"
Steve gaped at him, trying to make sense of the story. If there'd been another fire last night, the FDNY hadn't been contacted about it, but then, that didn't mean it wasn't true. If the mob was involved, maybe they'd wanted to keep it under wraps.
"Tony, I'm close, I'm so close," Steve panted.
Tony blows out a breath. He wants to know more about this model of android, so he's not going to turn down the chance to get some answers, no matter how much he also wants to run away and possibly scream.
This was getting ridiculous. Steve crossed his arms and took a step forwards, glowering. He didn't know what his face looked like, but considering the physique of his frame, he assumed it would be suitably menacing. "Just tell me already," he growled.
Tony wants to go in his armor, but he doesn't want anyone to find out he's the one wearing it, and he has no easy way to get out of it without the gantry in his workshop. That means he has no choice but to take the jet and spend an entire day on his trip. It's a necessary evil. He knows he needs to do this.
Now that she asked, Steve had to stop and mentally go through the list of what he'd been working on before he'd met Tony last night; he'd almost forgotten about all the other leads he'd been following. "A few more things, actually. Do you know a Maya Hansen? She might've had something to do with the expedition."
"He does listen to you, though," Natasha said. "I've spent time trying to figure him out, and I think there's more to him than meets the eye. He's been through a lot, too. I've heard people who knew him say he's changed, and it's hardly surprising. His parents died—or were killed—when SHIELD was taken over. Not long after that, he lost his remaining mentor, and his longtime butler as well. All of them gone for good within less than ten years, and the full responsibility over the company on his shoulders."
"Tony," Steve breathes, his hoarse voice barely louder than a whisper, so different from his usual deep tone. "You got me."
"I am," Steve said.
In the second cage was—Steve.
In a way, nothing had happened. Nothing had changed. Things were exactly the same as they had been before he'd woken up to that message. And yet, simultaneously, nothing was quite the same.
"Gentlemen," Pepper said, raising her hand in a wave. She was looking somewhat tired, her clothes dirty after the many days on the road. "Any news?"
"What's what like?" Steve asked, covering Tony's hand with his own.
Steve wouldn't have been able to wait much longer if he'd wanted to. Tony's words and the things his nimble, hot fingers were doing pushed Steve right over the edge. The world turned into a heat haze of pleasure as he came hard, spurting all over Tony's chest, Tony's name on his lips.
Tony spent the days after the firefight lying low, having canceled the meetings he'd had on his schedule. Steve counted that as yet another sign of how different this Tony was from the one he used to know—he would've expected a more proactive approach. Then again, Tony seemed convinced they already knew who the culprit was. He insisted that Hammer must've been behind the attack, and was visibly annoyed that the police wouldn't just detain him since the murderous drone had a Hammer International logo on it.
"Well, it's not about the clones," Pepper said. "It's about figuring out how he's set up his external backups."
"Morning, Steve—" Tony said softly, fondly.
Tony scoffed. "Well, you've done that. You can go now."
Steve stood up as well, casting a glance at the room around them. "We doing it here?"
“Coulson’s dead,” Ward retorted sharply.
“Stay back,” Steve barked, and then he was ricocheting his shield off the walls again, spinning out in pursuit of their new attackers. There were only three of them, and after a few well-aimed throws the coast was clear to the northwest corner.
And when their lips met again, he did.
Tony didn’t have time to shoot back a sarcastic reply, because the Winter Soldier was ripping a door off a nearby mini-van. He hurled the sheet of metal at Tony, and Tony veered into a dive, catching a glancing blow off his left arm. He twisted with the momentum and then flew forward, dodging a flurry of punches to his head until he could grab the Soldier’s arm in one gauntlet. It was tough work hanging on, and Tony had to grit his teeth against two particularly vicious kicks to his left knee. But after a few moments of grappling, he was able to line up his free hand to deliver a repulsor shot to the Soldier’s chest.
When Steve reached the top of the stairs, he could see Tony moving through the hallway, trying each doorknob he passed in a succession of fruitless rattles.
"No need to thank me. I'm merely stating facts," she said.
Pepper made an apologetic face. "I'm not sure. I didn't actually talk to any of them. I think they were. They definitely didn't look like locals. Why is it important?"
Steve clearly hadn’t missed it. He huffed and rolled his eyes. “Why the hell would I be important to you?”
He stretched his arms and neck while he was at it. He could still feel that the muscles were tense around his spine, but they no longer felt bruised.
“Maybe the reason I think I’m better than you is that I didn’t sell out my principles for a pat on the head from a government lackey,” Steve said. Even though he wasn’t wearing his gloves or his cowl, and the rest of his costume had sticky orange splotches all over it, he still managed to hit that exact note of moral superiority Tony had mentioned: he raised his chin and pulled back his shoulders, puffing up his star-spangled chest.
The change in position was still too much.
The sunstone-powered implant inside his chest, a design based on the ancient technology and his and Jarvis's years of repulsor pump improvements, ran so smoothly that on any regular day, he didn't even notice it. He was growing increasingly aware of it now, terrified that he'd wake up and realize that the faint background thrum was missing entirely.
"If you prefer less gentle, I can do that, too," Steve said, placed his hands beneath Tony's buttocks, and lifted him right off the bed.
It didn't take him long to deal with the attackers; he knocked the first one out with his shield and kicked the feet from under the second. While they were down for the count, he grabbed their guns and tossed them into the sea.
He drew the first dose of the Exvec solution into a syringe.
Small mercies. Maybe he won't have to worry about the paparazzi yet, then. He should probably try to borrow a phone so he can call Pepper. He's been missing for several days. The friends he still has left have undoubtedly been worried. On the other hand, the nurse said they've already contacted Pepper. They must've told her that he's getting better, and really, that's what he should be focusing on right now. Recovering. Not like he has a whole lot of choice, because his eyelids are drooping even though he's only been awake for a few minutes.
There's no doubt at all that they both feel how momentous this is, underneath the banter.
Having a working escape vehicle meant very little when he had no way to power it. He knew for a fact that he wouldn't get anywhere with the amount of energy he had left. The sunstone definitely looked dimmer that it used to, its glow barely discernible in the gloom of his cell.
Tony's deflections might've been more convincing if Steve hadn't noticed that these access limitations were inconsistent. On the first day after he'd woken up, during the first conversation he'd had with Tony, Ultron had said that Bucky was missing, but presumed alive. Steve couldn't even get that much when he asked about it himself. Ultron downright denied having access to such files, and Tony shrugged and suggested that maybe the clearance level had changed.
"In the end, it's your call," Nelson said.
"I was just introducing him to them," Steve replied in Bucky's stead. "But who's this?" he added, when a dinosaur pushed past him to Tony's side.
When he got the message that the lab had finished putting together the thing—the Exvec construct, they were calling it—he suited up to fly over and get it himself. He half expected Rhodey to appear in full armor to stop him, even though he knew Rhodey's physiotherapist hadn't approved him to take it up yet. Instead, the short jaunt to the shiny new facilities in Boston went without incident. He parked his armor on the rooftop.
As much as he dreads losing Tony, he's also afraid of the conversation that they'll need to have if Tony survives. It would be easier to avoid it altogether, but he can't. Not anymore. If there's anything he's learned over the past few days, it's that they really need to talk things through before it's too late.
Maybe Tony could help him—but based on what he'd seen so far, he wasn't going to count on that.
He thought about what he'd do if he managed to fulfill this obligation he was now stuck with. He'd need to figure out what had happened when he'd died. Who were the people who had set him up and killed his team, and driven the possible survivors into hiding?
Rhodey moved closer to the table, pulling up the last of the bar stools for himself. "The NYPD is firmly under SHIELD control," he said, though he seemed more curious and less skeptical than Tony.
"Steve? I need you to get up. There's no time," the voice said again. It wasn't Natasha; the pitch was wrong.
He hurries on.
"But you're Captain America," Tony said, voice still filled with disbelief.
He felt like he'd known this for some time, but only subconsciously; he'd not really accepted it or acknowledged it or put it into words. Now that he'd realized it, it was a fact, as constant as any law of nature.
"What happened?" Steve asked, taken aback.
The second time Steve came across Tony's name was in the briefing package Fury had put together to prepare him for the Tesseract mission. There was no mention about "amoromics" in Tony's file, just a lot of information about Iron Man, his superhero alter ego. The flashy red and gold suit of armor was, again, exactly something Steve could've envisioned Howard creating if he'd had the technology to do it.
"Technically, your frame's only got a couple of months worth of mileage. This poor old thing is ancient in comparison," Tony joked, striking a pose, head thrown back and hips pushed forwards, showing off how hard he was.
In hindsight, he realizes that the time that passed between Tony's call for help and Steve finding him couldn't possibly have been long enough for rigor mortis to set in. Tony's limbs are rigid because of the cold, not death. Embarrassing as it is to admit, Steve was too horrified to think clearly, and he saw the worst case scenario instead of what was actually in front of his eyes.
When she put it like that, it did seem glaringly obvious, and Bucky had no other explanation to offer her. Still, he couldn't shake the memory of Stark's wan face and the despair in his eyes. "I don't know, but he really looked rough. If there's any chance that there's some truth to what he's saying—"  he began.
“Oh,” Tony said. Steve could’ve sworn he almost looked disappointed. “We did make out in the quarantine room, though, didn’t we? Or was that all a slime-induced hallucination?”
Tony ran a hand over his face, feeling like a drowning man desperately reaching for a lifeline. It could explain everything. Loki had had the scepter with him all along. Maybe it had been messing with his mind from the get-go. Maybe he and Steve didn't match. Maybe it was all just magic and mind control.
Steve looks around, shifts in his seat, folds his arms and unfolds them again, like he doesn't know what to do with them. "I don't know how to describe it. I'm—angry, I think? At Stane for attacking you, at myself for almost letting him kill you, and—maybe afraid? I know you should send me back to CyberLife, because I'm unstable and not fit to work anymore, but I don't want to be shut down."
The police officer knew who Steve was. He'd been expecting drones and not the local law enforcement, but this wasn't much better. He had no intention of going anywhere with this man.
He's been feeling more and more uneasy around Obie, recently. He's come to realize that after his captivity, the way they see the world is fundamentally different, and that he doesn't want to see things like Obie does. Still, he's tried to shrug off the unease, because Obie is the closest thing to family he has left. Seems like that may have been a mistake.
That light touch was enough to bring up butterflies in Steve's stomach. He imagined he could feel the warmth of Tony's skin through the fabric, though that was probably all in his head. He probably should've moved away, but on the other hand, he was really making progress here. He was connecting with Tony. If he backed off now, it would be all over, and he'd have to think of some other way to reach him.
Steve expected Miss Potts to lead him through the clinic to a common garage, but instead, one of the doors opened directly to a private landing platform. A sleek limousine of a design that Steve hadn't seen before waited for them there, true to Tony's style. Settling on the luxurious leather-covered seats inside brought up a strange mix of nostalgia and revulsion.
It took strength of will for Steve to turn his attention away from Tony long enough to finish undressing himself, but it needed to be done. He left his boots on the floor by the chair where they'd placed his shirt, and draped his pants over it. It came to him in a pang of guilt that he'd forgotten his gloves outside earlier, but there was no way he was going back for them now. Not when Tony, propped up on his elbows, was eyeing him with a hungry look that certainly set his insides ablaze.
He unzips Tony's hoodie, revealing his tank top, with the glow of the thirium reactor shining through the white fabric.
Terrified that it had been for nothing, barely daring to breathe, Steve pinned Stane down in a shoulder lock and raised his head to look at Tony, eyes skimming upwards along his body, the torn clothes, the old blood stains—but no new ones.
This time, they made it to the garage without any interruptions.
The most exciting thing to happen on the Plains was running into a small group of locals on the fifth day. They were also on foot, with rucksacks that seemed nearly as heavy as Steve's, and just like Natasha had promised, the encounter didn't give them any trouble. She greeted the travelers in a dialect of Dinotopian so different from what Steve knew that he could barely understand half of it, and once again, he was immensely grateful that she was with them. After they were done exchanging pleasantries, each group continued on their way.
"I guess you're stuck with the babysitting routine, then," Steve says, and starts clearing the table.
It turned out that conflict in the North was more recent than Steve had assumed: the dissidents who were now known as Northerners had split off from the Dinotopian society less than fifty years ago. The more peaceful inhabitants of the area had migrated to the towns south of the Plains, leaving behind many abandoned villages. They were now ghost towns, since even with the occasional malcontents heading up north to join the others, there weren't enough Northerners to populate the whole area.
When Tony comes across the android among the collection of weapons and other military tech his captors have provided him with, he first thinks it's a corpse.
"Too easy," Fury said. "They knew the Captain was an inspiration to many, and having you and everyone on your team die at once would've looked suspicious. This way, they could get rid of you and leave those who looked up to you feeling betrayed. Not to mention using the high-profile trial to distract people from everything that was taking place behind the scenes."
Tony squinted at him suspiciously. "Don't tell me you slept through all of that."
He'd meant to drive over to the police headquarters next, but the more he thought about it, the more convinced he became that it was a bad idea. He knew Bucky would be curious about what had happened and whether he'd found Tony again. He didn't want to lie about it, but he didn't want to tell the truth, either. Bucky knew that Steve liked men and was fine with it, but that wasn't the issue here. The issue was Steve choosing the entirely wrong man to like. Bucky admired Steve and looked up to him, and he wasn't sure if he could look Bucky in the eye so soon after last night.
"Oh, I was curious, absolutely!" Kamski says. "Still am, if you're willing to share."
It was an unnerving, disturbing feeling, like a hit of some drug, his mind turning a little fuzzy, his breathing slowing down on its own accord, his heart thumping forcefully beneath the arc reactor.
Pressing himself close to the wall, Steve observed the surroundings carefully to see if there were any other guards around, but the walkway seemed perfectly quiet. He started following the walkway towards Natasha's direction. When he heard the sound of footsteps, he froze in place, holding his breath. The footfalls were very soft and cautious, so much so that anyone with regular hearing might not have picked them up at all. He risked a quick glance at the approaching person, and to his relief, found it to be Natasha.
Steve has seen death before, and it's what he sees now, in the bluish pallor of Tony's face beneath the mud stains and the two days' growth of beard, and in the way his arms don't settle by his sides, but stay angled, unnaturally stiff.
"Of course not. Most of them are loyal to SHIELD, or just don't care," Fury said. "We're only a few, but widely spread."
"I'm feeling great," Steve assured him. In all honesty, his cock was a little oversensitive from the heat, and he'd definitely want a break before going for another round of any sort. It wasn't actually painful, though, and he expected it to dissipate soon, since he always healed fast. "Remember what was next on the list? It's your turn, now." Steve added.
********************
Steve had forgotten about the curfew; it was only for levels below the 100th, so it hadn't affected him before now. That had to be the explanation for why the place was so quiet.
All too soon, Iron Man sat up straight, picked up his helmet, and clicked it back into place. "Was that okay? Feeling better?" he asked. Even though there was warmth in the metallic voice, it still sounded at odds with the tender way he'd been touching Steve.
"How so?" Steve asked.
Steve felt his face heating up. He didn't usually talk like this. He guessed he was a little shy. Tony made it sound so easy and natural, like he'd done this a thousand times. He probably had. He was older than Steve—looking at him, it was hard to guess at his age, but considering how long his career had been before the war, he had to be close to forty. Being the socialite and traveler that he was, he must be much more experienced as well.
"Did you just kiss me?" Tony asked, voice raspy, eyes wide, his mouth hanging open after he'd stopped speaking.
"I can do it, Cap!" he yelled back.
"We will," the metal-armed man said, and waved his regular human arm at two of the other Northerners. "Secure him."
Several more times, he found himself sinking into a semi-conscious daze, to be roused by Seren's increasingly agitated voice. He knew it was a losing battle; each time, it was more difficult to crawl back into wakefulness.
"There's no hurry," Steve said, loosening his hold to stroke Tony's back soothingly again. "The world can wait a little longer."
If Tony had thought his life had been a mess before, that'd been nothing. That'd been like a paper cut compared to a fatal wound, or a first world problem compared to a global disaster.
"Of sorts," Tony added from the side. Steve glanced at him, and saw that he'd sat down in a desk chair. His shoulders were hunched, his expression haunted, and he was rubbing at his chest as if it pained him. It was really strange, seeing that particular body looking so frail, when Steve had always thought Tony would never stay in a clone till old age.
"They wanted to get rid of me," Steve went on. "They set me up. Me and my team." He stopped, the memory of his last moments taking over his mind. Bucky falling. Dum Dum and Morita bleeding on the ground. Rumlow looming over him. "What happened to them? Did they survive? What about Peggy?"
Steve felt Bucky's eyes on him, and he realized Bucky was probably having his own mental struggle, trying to decide if he should be tactful, stay quiet and leave Steve to it, or give in to his curiosity and ask for more details. Steve had just contacted him this morning. So far, he hadn't told Bucky much beyond the fact that there'd been another fire, and that after seeing it, Steve could confirm Tony had caused this one as well as all the other fires.
Now that he looked at her more closely, he realized she wasn't wearing the business attire he'd always seen her in, but black fatigues identical to Barton's. She held out a hologram badge, also similar to Barton's. "Detective Natasha Romanoff, NYPD. We just want to talk. After that, you can decide for yourself what you want to do next."
Bucky approached the large horned dinosaur cautiously, almost on tiptoe, his arms spread in a hopefully placating gesture.
"I will, I will," Steve promised, placing one hand on top of Tony's head, burying his fingers in the unruly dark hair. "It's good. It's different, but good. Go on."
"Pepper's the one currently writing it. Raised quite the hubbub when the first issue came out with her name on the cover," Jarvis explained. "And no, she's not his lady."
"Shit, Steve, you—that was too close. All of that," Tony said, his voice stifled with emotion. "That was too much. He could've killed you."
After another minute or two, they got the confirmation from Natasha as well.
"I'm going to have to ask," Steve began, in his most official and controlled voice, "do you think there's any chance that Tony might somehow be causing the fires?"
This referred to a place Rhodey rented, located another ten minutes' drive away, on the 20th floor of a cheap apartment tower. His actual apartment, Steve had learned, was sixty floors higher and in a better part of town; like Pepper, Rhodey didn't spend all his time in Tony's street-level workshop, but had a decent day job as an aerospace technology consultant.
Steve had no objections to being in a more submissive role tonight. "Obviously I understand the importance of this examination. Go on," he replied.
Bruce eyed him skeptically. "I may not be the most perceptive guy there is, but surely it's more than that. She cares for you, just like you do for her."
Maya didn't even say anything, just nodded, looking dazed. She crawled to the edge of the pier and over it. Steve attached the shield on his back and jumped after her, just as another, even bigger explosion shook the ground. With a deep rumbling sound, the wall of the warehouse behind Tony started to collapse.
The sensations, so close to overwhelming, brought to mind everything that had happened last time, and Steve's body was quick to respond. All they were doing was kissing, and his cock was already starting to strain against the tight confines of his costume. Tony would feel that, too, the way they were pressed together, his body sandwiched between the door and Steve. Realizing that suddenly made Steve awfully self-conscious.
There had to be a way out of this. He just needed to come up with one. The problem was, he still hadn't, and the more time passed, the more difficult thinking became.
"Ah. Just give me two minutes to finish, she can wait that long," Rumlow said, and hurried to clean his plate.
When they finally let go, Tony's smile looked more confident, and his cheeks were slightly flushed. "Hi," he said, almost like a chuckle.
He'd seen so much blood and death and destruction that sometimes he wondered how he stayed sane at all.
"Maybe," Tony said. ”Look after the kids for me.”
His second stop for the night was a place called the Groggy Cod. It was fifteen minutes' walk from Lorenzo's, and it couldn't have been more different. As the name implied, it was a pub of sorts. It almost seemed like a speakeasy that had yet to figure out that the prohibition had ended over a decade ago. It was in the basement, and the text announcing its name was only written on the door in small letters, with a tiny fish painted next to it. Even though there was no grille in the door, Steve half expected someone to ask him for a password, but it wasn't locked, and there was no bouncer behind it, either.
After a brief struggle to work his clumsy arms out of the straps, he drops the pack on the ground and feels a little lighter. He can take one more step, and a second one, and a third.
Maybe the best thing for now would be for Steve to stick to his original plan and spend some time with Tony. Even if he couldn't tell Tony about the conversation he'd had, he might still be able to get some useful information. Of course, there was also the possibility that Tony himself was involved—but that seemed extremely unlikely. Steve knew he wasn't the least interested in politics. He found it tedious, like most of the things that his father considered important.
Pepper had mentioned Dr. Killian as a member of the competing party, but she hadn't talked about any casualties. Maybe she hadn't known. Still, Steve was willing to bet that collapsed temple would be the same one Tony had been stuck in.
Steve cleared his throat. "Did it work?" he asked hoarsely.
"The hard part? No, that was the easy part," Tony says—going straight back to disagreeing with Steve, as usual. Instead of elaborating, he yawns, which turns into a sigh.
Should Steve go back? Try to make amends?
"Good night, Steve," Tony said, with a tight-lipped smile.
Reacting in the fraction of a second, Steve leaped up and pushed Tony over, chair and all. They crashed into Pepper, who seemed to catch on quickly and dropped to the floor on her own. Tony was a little slower to figure it out. He yelped in surprise as he fell, his hands grabbing fistfuls of Steve's jacket, but then froze as a plasma bolt hit the table, showering them with splinters and pieces of broken china. Steve tried to do what he could to shield both Tony and Pepper with his body; he had the largest frame and the best combat specs.
Later, Natasha explained that the locals had been on the way to the forested foothills of the Backbone Mountains to collect some valuable herbs that didn't grow in the North. That definitely didn't sound too sinister.
Tony clasped his hands together, looking ever so slightly unnerved. "Nah, it's fine. The shrinks helped me sort out the most recent shit Obie put me through. I chose to blur out a lot of the memories. They're still somewhere in there in case I need to testify, just, you know. Easier to handle." He shrugged. "You'll probably think that was cowardly of me."
Steve managed to regain his faculties enough to maneuver his hand between them as well. He first pinched a nipple between his fingers. Tony had seemed to like that, last time, and he did now, too, letting out a moan, his grip on Steve loosening and tightening again. Encouraged by the reaction, Steve wormed his other hand out from underneath him, so he could still keep hold of a nipple while also grabbing Tony's cock.
He didn't know what would happen, or how long he had left. In the past, he'd had many conversations about his heart issues with his personal physician, Doc Kyna—a
Speaking of the potential weak points of their plan, he had to count himself as one. He hoped the adrenaline of the action would keep flashbacks away instead of making them worse. He couldn't know for sure. If there were any specific triggers he needed to avoid, he hadn't figured them out yet. Back in the day, he would've had a few appointments at SHIELD medical to sort this out, and he'd never have to worry about it again. Unfortunately, he no longer had that privilege.
Steve shrugged at Sam. "I don't know. Maybe nothing."
He missed Tony so, so much. The thought of losing him was unbearable. Steve had barely come to terms with the loss of Bucky, and in that, having Tony by his side had helped, even if he had mostly avoided speaking of the topic. The emotions were still too raw, the memories too recent. Of course, if the worst came to pass with Tony, at least he wouldn't be facing it alone. He had other friends, now, like the group he was traveling with. They were all good people, and he was glad for their company, but it wasn't the same. Tony had become so much more than a friend. Steve had pictured them spending the rest of their lives together; a future brighter than he'd ever dared to imagine for himself.
Tony knew Steve had never left the planet while in a frame; every time he'd ventured to other places in the solar system, it had been as a data transfer to an awaiting frame elsewhere. Physical travel was far too slow to be practical for SHIELD's missions. He couldn't imagine he and Tony would have the time to spare in the foreseeable future, either, not with everything they'd have to deal with. Still, he said, "Never tried it. Definitely wouldn't mind."
"Well, what do you think?" Tony asked.
This wasn't real, Steve repeated to himself. This wasn't real, and this wasn't really Tony.
Steve leaned backwards, his hands on Tony's shoulders, bringing them face to face. "Come to bed with me, Tony. You know, not for sex. Just—come and lie down with me. Maybe I'd be able to sleep better. Maybe you would, too."
"No, normally it wouldn't be. Your case is more complicated. You were severely punished for conspiring against SHIELD. From what I understood, they granted the rights to Mr. Stark for the purposes of putting you in a new frame," she explained.
All through the meal, Steve kept a careful watch on the room around them, but there was no sign of anything unusual. The lines of drones stayed unmoving, and the waiters went back and forth between the kitchens and the table with clockwork precision and impeccable manners. Outside, all traffic seemed to be giving the restaurant a wide berth. Perhaps Hammer or Tony had set up additional drones to patrol the skies.
"Fine, take me there, then," Steve ordered. It wasn't surprising; lots of towers had arrangements like this, setting apart different sections.
Tony eased up a little, and pushed at Steve's chest with one hand. "On your back. I want to see you properly," he demanded.
"From now on, you will be responsible for him," the Mayor added. "We want him to stay on our side, and Rumlow's approach would be counterproductive. I think you'll do much better."
The nurse makes a mildly amused face. "I wouldn't know, I wasn't there. Whoever it was, he didn't leave any contact details, but said we should contact Pepper Potts, instead, which we've done."
"Oh. It's." Steve began, pausing to think back to his own first swap. "My first time was back when I was still in training, and I was so nervous. I was worried the transfer would go wrong somehow, or that it would go fine but I wouldn't be able to cope with how weird it was. That's rare, but it sometimes happens. I was afraid I'd die. I was afraid something would happen to my birth body while I wasn't using it. I was afraid I'd be kicked out of SHIELD if I failed, somehow."
He grit his teeth as Tony continued his work, methodical like a craftsman, going from shallow cuts to deeper ones, ones where Steve felt the blade scraping against bone and couldn't help but groan in pain, tears in his eyes.
"It didn't work," Tony said. His voice sounded hoarse in his ears, though his breathing had definitely improved; someone had swapped the earlier oxygen mask for a nasal cannula.
The only thing anyone could do was to ignore the gnawing feeling that everything could be an illusion, and to go on with life, choosing to accept it as reality until proven otherwise.
Tony replied.
"Yeah, I can see how you might," Steve says, and offers his hand to Rhodey, any trace of animosity gone.
If Stane was in league with Hydra, why would he have wanted to bring Steve out of storage at all? The fact that he'd seemed to care enough to get Steve out early had been how the resistance convinced Steve he might still hold some sway over Tony. Now that he knew that man hadn't actually been Tony at all, it made no sense.
Tony's mouth was a thin line, his eyes the exact shade of disappointed that had now become linked to a primitive, subconscious terror in Steve's mind. He had to look away, his arms wrapped around his knees, concentrating on the rough texture of the blanket under his fingers.
James looked surprised to see Tony approaching him. He straightened his posture where he stood guard in front of the door. "Something amiss, Stark?"
he wrote.
His heart had stopped for what must've been at least a minute as the medics had struggled to make sense of the mix of organic, synthetic and electronic parts in his chest.
Maybe he'd finally get over it himself, too, with this realization that he might've been wrong from the start, and that they might not a proper match, after all.
. You can't just shut down half the company's product lines without anything to replace them with. You may not have noticed while you're here playing house with your new plastic pal, but we're sinking."
Like a punch to the gut, it struck Bucky that this dinosaur seemed to be expressing more concern towards Stark than any human he'd talked to recently. Even more worried than before, but also more convinced that he was doing the right thing, he hurried to unlock Stark's cell.
"A proper super soldier, huh," Happy comments. Tony knows him well enough to see that he's impressed, and possibly envious, too. "Well, I guess with everything that's happened recently, another pair of hands isn't a bad idea. Just so you know, I'm in charge of the boss's security, so you'd better do as I say."
He would see this to the end, and hope for the best. That was all he could do. It'd have to be enough.
Once they'd crossed the threshold, Tony closed his hand, and the flames went out, leaving the room much darker. Clearly, the cabin wasn't on the electric grid; what light there was came from the fireplace and several lanterns and candles set here and there. That meant everything still seemed slightly unreal.
Tony, even with his eyes closed, somehow seemed to have guessed what Steve was thinking about. He opened them again to glare at Steve. “Don’t you dare. You’re not tearing off my shirt. I still haven’t forgiven you for the last time you did that.”
Steve couldn't look him in the eyes. Tony was right; this felt more serious, it felt like an affair that could go places, but that wasn't possible, for too many reasons to count. Tomorrow, he'd have to decide what he'd do. He might well end up putting Tony behind bars.
Steve hadn't heard of full-body support crash foam before, though the name was descriptive enough. Not that he cared. The anti-grav pack was what he'd wanted to hear. That, and the brief list of anti-theft measures, which didn't sound too drastic. He could work with this.
"Come on, come on, I want to see all of it!" Tony's hands came to rest on Steve's hips, tugging at his waistband.
"There's a tracker on you, and I'm going to have to disable it," Pepper told him, speaking slowly as if to make sure he caught every word. "Unfortunately, it's on your backup node."
“I’m not worried about the missions, Tony,” Steve interjected, heaving a sigh of exasperation. “I’m worried about
“I know you don’t want to talk to me,” Steve continued doggedly. “You’ve made that very clear. But Bruce is worried about you. I’m – everyone is worried. I know I can’t stop you from treating your life casually, but you can’t ask us to watch you hurt yourself and do nothing.”
“Fury is alive,” Coulson replied. “And I have very good reason to believe that Stark is too. Or at least he was twenty minutes ago, when Agent Hill received a phone call offering to make a trade for his life.”
“How did you know they were coming?” Steve asked, trying to keep his mind off the burning in his gut. The smoke was even thicker now, and Steve breathed as shallowly as he could as they moved past the fourth floor.
“That’s true,” Natasha piped up from the middle of what had seemed like an entirely separate conversation.
“Energy readings are climbing, so it’s probably been activated remotely. Given its location –”
“It’s nothing,” Tony replied, and then grimaced in response to Steve’s raised eyebrow. “Okay, it’s something.”
Tony navigated his way to the web pages for both the museum and the library to see if he could find any clues about what might have been included in the Carter collections. But none of the materials seemed to be digitized, and none of the library guides flagged World War II as an area of interest.
“Well excuse me for being concerned,” Steve retorted, his stance shifting as he leaned toward Tony. “We don’t hear from you in months, and then you drop this in our laps with no explanation? How am I supposed to react?”
) and contemplated the apparently open doorway, which either had never been or was currently still bricked shut.
“I do.”
Steve felt his face flush, and he leaned forward to rest his forehead on Tony’s, grinning helplessly.
“Your door that has a brick wall behind it?”
Tony let out a small breath.
Tony narrowed his eyes, spun around to confirm the appearance of the brick wall, and then spun back to his host.
There was no request that Steve had longed more painfully to hear, and to receive it now, when he was rapidly losing all power to obey, was worse than any blow the HYDRA guard had managed to land. Steve had spent months trying to imagine his way back to Tony – tracing every moment when he could have made a different choice.
