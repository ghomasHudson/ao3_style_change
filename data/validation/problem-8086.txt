Antonia’s project of forgetting Mr. Hammer for a while made her rather to sorry to find, when they had taken all their places, that he was close to her. She could not understand his insensibility towards Virginia, especially since he not only sat by her, but was continually intruding on her notice, and addressing her on every possible occasion. Instead of being able to forget him, his behavior was such that Bruce’s earlier words took soil and rooted in her brain.
He kept observing him with heightened indignation, with sadness an eye on his blinded companion in Antonia. He saw a short word prepared for Antonia, given to her with a sly look. He saw Antonia had soon made it out, before judging it proper to censure; “Oh nonsense – for shame!”
“On that Antonia, trust me if my father or mother was still alive, not even Cerberus could keep me away. I would rather answer to family than be my own master.” The words are spoken with feeling, and Antonia wants to pull her own back into her mouth.
Steve finds him like this, unfolding from the old Chevvy looking every inch the enlistment dream. Pressed cotton and starched linen, lines crisp against his endless shoulders. He’s stuck, a little, on the
“It is not the most attractive quality to have,” Mr. Barton agrees, eyes holding a secret Antonia did not feel privy to.
“Tony, it’s fine.” Steve turns to him, “I’ll see you soon.” And it feels a bit like a goodbye, Steve trying to hold back tears with a horrible smile that looks pasted on, “I love you.”
He pulls his own shirt over his head, and feels Tony’s lust kick up a gear, feels Tony’s eyes like a brand across his chest. He senses the moment Tony feels his insecurity at his scars, feels his nervousness about the ugly mottled marks across his right pectoral where it looks like someone grabbed at the skin and
“Pepper!” Antonia shouts now, voice trembling, wishing the words to stop as she realizes with dawning horror what sorry state she has allowed this to get into, “Let us understand each other now, without any further mistake. Are you. Are you speaking of Captain Rogers?”
“I’ve no idea what you mean.” Steve, instead, chooses the vague response, knowing how she hates it, hoping to throw her off. But he knows better. She’s a former interrogator and if she’s set you in her sights you better make sure you are more prepared than Steve currently feels.
Steve, however, is noticeably quiet. Normally he chimes in here and there with a dirty joke delivered in a sickeningly dry monotone that has even Natasha cracking a smirk. Tonight, however, he’s perched on a stool beside Sam instead of in his usual spot by Tony’s side
There’s a Chevy burning rubber down the road to them, driver wearing his military issue cap low across his head. As it rumbles ever closer Tony can feel his heart uptick in response, feels his feet moving without needing told towards the car as it pulls up and cuts the engine. The driver steps out, and it feels like a piece of deja vu, feels like when Tony first caught his gaze on him. But now he’s here, and he’s not going away, and they are going to be together. His heart sings, free and beautiful and so happy he could burst with it.
To the majority of them, he’s still “Cap” and he sure as hell hasn’t earned the right to be called “Steve”.
"Fuck!" Sam curses from beside him, and throws the phone at Steve in a flurry of panicked movement before bolting for the front door at a speed so fast Steve was sure he must have had wings.
“How are the others?” Steve questions, hating the fact he wasn’t there to watch out for his team.
” with a leering wink and a loud bang of the door. And they both know it.
He knows this person is for him, but he doesn’t know when. So when military enrolment officers come to his school, size him up with dollars in their eyes, and offer him a free ride through university should he serve, he sees no other choice. He thinks to his mother counting coppers out for the laundrette, her wrists thin and eyes tired, and thinks how he needs to have world experience for anyone to want him. It’s a double edged sword, the knowledge that this other half of his will love him no matter what, but still being utterly determined to be worthy of such a devotion.
“What got repealed?” Tony asks, still in a state of shock at Steve’s sudden appearance, at his state of disarray.
“Shh it’s alright, it doesn’t matter. You’re awake now. I’m here.” He waves the nurses away and cradles Tony’s hand in his.
” Tony hisses into Steve’s mouth, and Steve lets loose a grin, sinful and dark, before walking them to where Tony directs. Tony’s weight is delicious, heavy enough to feel, but light enough to allow Steve an idle swipe of his thighs with one hand. “You are going to be the death of me.”
Alexander. So yes, I'd like some more detail."
They left his sight with a giggle, thick as thieves, “What
He licks and kisses at Tony’s softening cock before Tony bats him away and so he lounges now between the v of Tony’s legs, head on Tony’s stomach, knees bent. It’s not the most comfortable of positions, but Steve doesn’t care. He is viciously proud of the contentment and happiness he feels radiating off Tony, the bone deep satisfaction that sits in his lungs like ambrosia.
“I’d have to be blind to not think so.” Steve answers, surprising himself with the flirty tone that spills out. It’s not like him to be direct, he’s been compared to a Labrador in the past. All boundless energy completely directed in the wrong places.
As expected from such an agreeable man, he was up in short time. His broad presence made the already busy room feel smaller, and Antonia’s eyes settled on him with joy. It was always good to see her dear friend, though his eyes settled on the closeness of herself and Mr Barton and she watched his jaw clench. For what reason, she was unsure, but she made sure to smile widely at his presence.
myself to marry beneath me.” Fury rages in Antonia at his dismissive tone, “No. My hopes were all entirely for you. Led, in part, by the marked encouragement you gave me –“
had her struck by the sight. His double breasted waistcoat was a beautiful cerulean lace that shimmered as it caught the sun, matching the tint of his eyes perfectly, and the rest of him was the most beautiful sight of dark creams and slate greys.
“Mr. Barton, you spoil us.” Her mother spoke first with a smile, watching them both in a way that confused Antonia no end.
Upon arrival, he found a parking space in the garage with his shield’s symbol painted in the middle already there for him, and he hasn’t been able to pause for breath and take the bike out for a spin since.
Clint groans, “Dude, you are being so offensive, I don’t even know where to begin.”
“Well I’ll catch you guys later I guess.” Steve speaks awkwardly, assuming that now Natasha is here to care for Clint, he’s no longer needed.
“Good afternoon all, Miss Stark, Miss Hill, Miss Romanov.” He nodded his head in a sharp bow, hat in his hands.
“Steven, please, if you like me even a bit you will hand your horse off to one of my groomsmen and help me inside.” Antonia speaks fast, pushing the words out and ignoring how her face flames at the request. She feels stupid, but she knows she cannot give any quarter to Mr. Hammer’s bizarre behavior this evening. She isn’t sure what has given him such airs this evening, but knows in her heart it cannot be encouraged, in case he thinks he can set himself at a higher prize than her beloved Virginia.
“Steve –“
‘To fall in with each other on an errand as this,’ Thought Antonia, ‘this will bring a great increase of love on each side, perhaps even a declaration. God’s – what I wish to not be here and allow the flames of love to kindle and grow.’
Tony’s raised a fist before he can stop, feels Steve behind him at his shoulder. He pauses, lets his hand hang there. “You think I need you?” He laughs, the sound acidic, “I don’t need you. I will be bigger than you ever were, better than you ever could be. You haven’t created anything of any worth since I was eight years old, and it kills you that your success is off my back.”
Every invitation was well met and successful, and then something to make it greater. The eldest little Banner was engaged to pay her grandparents a visit, and Mr. Banner was proposed to bringing her, and staying one whole day at Hartfield – the day of this very party. So Miss Stark considered that ten people were indeed a large party, but she refused to miss on Mr. Banner’s company.
“Hello Anthony,” she replies, voice reedy and thin, “what have you been up to.”
The Miss Stark was puzzled, unable to understand whether his compliments were to be considered marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance. In any certainty she could not deny her vanity was flattered disproportionately, almost flushing as she saw her mother’s eyebrows raise across the channel of the room.
In general, their evenings were far less engaged with friends than their morning, but there was one dinner engagement they could not hope to decline.
When they mutually call it, their chests are both heaving from the exertion. Natasha is sporting a wicked bruise across her right eye, and Steve’s missing a chunk of hair from where Natasha grabbed hold and pulled. Natasha grins, teeth bloody and Steve can’t help but bark a laugh at how ridiculous the pair must look.
He can’t remember Rhodey finding him, sobbing endlessly caught on a silent scream. He only remembers coming to with vicious clarity, finding his phone with shaky fingers, typing in a number he wished he didn’t know.
It’s not long before they get Sam bundled into his flat, Steve taking off his shoes before wrapping him up in bed with a glass of water and bucket beside him. Tony watches him with a strange look of fondness, and Steve feels a heat on the back of his neck.
“You must forgive me for gossiping. I spent my whole childhood hearing her virtues sung from the tree tops. We are poles apart – she is just
He keeps telling himself that as his phone lights up every other minute with Steve’s Caller ID flashing across the screen.
After taking as long as she could, drawing out the moment as far as it would stretch, she set out once more, slowly ambling forth as casual as she could make it. She gained on them, however, involuntarily; even the slowest pace she could make was still a fair sight faster than theirs, cursing her long coltish legs, overviewing their fairly exuberant conversation. Mr. Hammer was speaking with animation, Virginia listening with a very pleased attention, and Antonia was beginning to think on how she might draw back a little more when they both looked around, and she was obliged to join them.
Still, with every turn in the dances following she could not help her eyes drifting to Steven’s figure at the side of the hall. There he was, among the standers-by, where he ought not to be. Such a fine figure deserved to be cutting a swathe through the attendees, not classing himself with the husbands and fathers and whist-players. His tall, firm, upright and bright figure, among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men, was as such that Antonia felt must draw everybody’s eyes. There was no one among the whole row of young men in the hall that could be compared with him.
“Of course.” Virginia nodded, “but what shall I say. Oh please Antonia, do advise me. I am aware of my station. I am aware of what this means.”
The food was over before too long, Steven having arranged a
She asks him with eyes wide, cautious, and the moment is dashed. Steven clears his throat, stands up, pats himself down, wills his heart not to break so very loudly in this quiet room.
Oh Antonia, you really don't know your own heart at all.
“Shall we head into the jaws of the beast then?” Steve’s voice shakes, “I can only apologize in advance for my friends.”
“Do you truly require me?” Steven asks, serious now, and upon Antonia nodding he moves quick. She adores him for this, for this serious side he can possess where required, for his dependability. Before long he has handed his horse over to one of her groomsmen with a few muttered instructions before stepping back toward her. “Mr. Hammer, please make your appearance at the door, Antonia and I have some catching up to do.” His tone brooks no argument, and Mr. Hammer sets his jaw in an grimace most unpleasant before nodding and sharply turning for the house.
“Testy.” Tony retorts, but comes to sit down beside Steve on the lounge chair. It’s meant for one person, really, and not two especially when one is a super soldier, but they make do. Neither one wants to complain, and if their arms brush and legs accidentally intertwine more than once, it’s not their fault. Steve has to calm the racing of his heart, fearing it is so loud the whole group can hear it, and misses the look that Clint and Natasha give each other whilst watching the pair.
Steve unwinds the bandage slowly, carefully, and what is underneath nearly stops Tony’s heart.
The husband and wife walked off together, and once out of earshot Clint Barton immediately spoke up, “What a happy couple!” he said, scorn ever so slightly coloring his tone, “How well they suit each other. To think they only knew each other a few weeks. Particularly lucky. Any real knowledge of a person’s disposition cannot be given in any public place. No knowledge can be gained until seeing them in their own homes, among their own set, that you can form any judgement. Short of that, it is all guess and luck, generally ill luck! How many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance, and rued it all the rest of his life!”
No more than a few days passed after this adventure, when Pepper came one morning to Antonia with a small parcel in her hand, and after sitting down and hesitating, thus began:
you, Antonia, she did. She has talked of little else since, for you to have heard her. How
“Why are you?” Clint replies.
The receptionist comes running forth with a man whose badge proclaims his as manager, indicating that at least they are beginning to step in the right direction. Tony firmly vows to himself to fuck Steve so fiercely and loudly in every room available to buy just to piss them off.
There she was welcomed, with the utmost delight, by her mother, as well as a man who had caused such emotion in her in one night. Her mother departed for bed quickly, safe and sound in the knowledge all her most beloved people were comfortable under one room, but Antonia could not sleep yet. Her mind was still roiling.
thing.” Tony huffs, and Steve laughs and kisses Tony’s forehead in a move entirely too tender for Tony’s poor heart to take and he has to move away before he does something stupid like leech onto Steve’s suit and never lets him go.
Antonia’s color was heightened by this unjust praise; and with a smile, and shake of the head, which spoke much, she looked at Captain Rogers. It seemed as though there were an instantaneous impression in her favour, as if his eyes received the truth from hers, he looked at her with a glow of regard.
Antonia huffed a laugh at this loud and heavy flattery, “Your gallantry sir is unanswerable. But (
Antonia paused, gathering her thoughts, before proceeding gently, “I hope it does not proceed from – I hope it is not compliment to Mr. Hammer?”
“I come bearing gifts.” Steve smiles, and Tony grabs the proffered coffee and sandwich with fast hands.
–“ before he realises that he’s not in the midst of a humid forest, but an air-conditioned room. His bed is soft under his fingers, not brick hard, and the buzz of life is noticeably absent.
“And how did you find Miss Romanov?”
“I need to drop off this idiot and check he gets in safe, then I’ll drive you through.” Steve answers, and Tony shakes his head with a wry smile.
more kid home. Tony yells at him after these sort of moves, the times he goes up against the enemy alone and goads them in order to give those hostages a fraction more time. He doesn’t deal in no-win scenarios, and Tony would make a Star Trek reference if he thought Steve would get it.
“There has been a solemn engagement between them both since long before his arrival, since before October. Kept secret from everybody, not a creature knowing it but themselves.” Antonia took this time to sit down, to think about what she just heard, rocking back deep into the chair.
He nods “I’d like that.” Killing the ignition and unfolding himself from the car, he looks up to the Tower. It almost seems to lean over him ominously, and he wonders what on earth he’s playing at.
Antonia is devastated by it. “I’m sorry for my outburst. I stopped you ungraciously just now and have caused you pain. But anything you wish me to hear, I will hear it, as a friend. You may ask or tell me anything you want, command me as it is your will to – as a friend. I will tell you exactly what I think.” And Antonia thinks if a heart could shatter it would of just then, almost surprised Steven could not hear it tear in two.
. Baby, I can feel you
Antonia ignored the trembling feeling of
The mistake had been slight. The carriage was sent for them momentarily. Antonia longed to know Clint’s first impression of Mrs. Hammer, but there was talk of rain and when the carriage returned he spoke “I will see that there are umbrellas, sir.” Clint said to his father, “Miss Hill must not be forgotten” and away he went to collect the two errant women.
“I saw her answer. Nothing could be clearer.”
, as Pepper proclaimed it a blush fell across Miss Romanov’s cheeks which gave it meaning not otherwise obvious. Steven connected it with the dream, although how was beyond his comprehension. Disingenuousness and double dealings met him at every turn. Letters mere vehicles for trick. Concealment for a deeper game on Clint Barton’s part.
Antonia balked at the praise. Such expressions, made Antonia feel that she had never loved Pepper so well, nor valued her affection so highly before.
It was indeed, so odd. Pepper’s behavior was odd. The engagement was odd. This entire day was so odd and Antonia did not know how to understand it. Pepper seemed to show no disappointment, concern or upset at the discovery, and Antonia found herself speechless.
Antonia’s thoughts were wild in the slight pause, initially thinking of herself, and then Pepper.
“It is one I shall never change, however.”
“You and Miss Coulson are like sisters, almost?” Antonia turns now, smile wide, attempting to engage the quiet Miss Romanov into the conversation about her. Natasha nods and begins to speak before Miss Hill powers on.
Natasha Romanov has grown into a beauty not even a dimly lit room can hide. She looks like a renaissance painting, fiery hair falling in corkscrew curls past her waist, framing a porcelain face and emerald eyes.
“We will have my strawberry party now then,” replied Captain Rogers, perhaps a touch jokingly, “That may be done without horses. Come, and view the bushels, they are ripening fast.”
The wretchedness of the entire excursion did not stray far from Antonia’s thoughts, no matter how time passed. A whole evening of cards with her mother was not enough to supplant it from her mind, despite the probing and pushing Maria Stark granted her with.
“You mean most don’t break something? How utterly boring.” Tony dares to tease, wants to eat up the delighted laugh Steven grants him with in response.
“It is very unfair to judge of any body’s conduct,” Steve snorts in response to this, but Antonia merely raises her eyebrows and barrels on, “without intimate knowledge of their situation. If you have not been in the interior of a family, how can you comment or say what difficulties of any individual of that family may be. We cannot be aware of his aunt and uncle, whether they have a particular temper or anger toward him showing any favour to his father.”
He takes the back passage stairs two at a time, jumps down the last one to avoid the creak. Tony’s not sure why he does so, he’s always been friendly with those that work within the walls of Stark Manor, but never felt this all-encompassing need and desire to introduce himself press against his lungs, sing against his heart. In his haste he arrives almost too quickly by the kitchen, skids to a stop just shy of the doorway, and waits there with a thundering heart and his lungs in his throat.
"You cannot be seriously turning us away because we are
He thinks, as he slips off into dreamless sleep, that he hears Steve whisper something.
A reasonable visit was paid, Mr. Marvel began to move – “he must be going. He had business at the Crown about his hay, and a great deal of errands with Mrs. Marvel, but he need not hurry anyone else.”
“Or wish that I behaved as I should. But I promise you, I would never to do anything to injure Miss Romanov in any way. But if Mr. Barton was attached to Miss Romanov in any way, which he is not I assure you, he would never – he”
“Not yet, I hope,” the love of his life says with a grin, “I’m not nearly done with you yet.”
“Well I’m glad.” Sarah says, “I hope that you’ll feel comfortable enough to come visit now when you are stateside, and not just end up on Bucky’s couch or in that old apartment. It can’t be good for your back, Stevie. Now go fetch the rest of my stuff in, would you?”
. Miss Romanov’s perception seemed to match his; her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning, the superior intelligence, of those seven letters so arranged. She was evidently upset; looked up, seeing herself watched, blushed more deeply than ever perceived before, and saying only, “I did not know that proper names were allowed” before pushing the letters away with an angry spirit. Being resolved to not be engaged by one more word uttered to her, she turned toward her aunt.
in cursive sprawling round his whole bicep. He hides it with tight t-shirts, not risking them riding up because Tony knows Steve watches his face crumple whenever he sees the offending name.
“That is quite alright, Miss Hill! I would love to hear from Natasha. How lovely that the Coulson’s have allowed you to visit.” Antonia speaks to Natasha warmly.
“What to do? In what respect? Do you mean with regard to this letter? What could possibly be in doubt? You must answer of course – and speedily. It will not do to leave a man – even of his standing - waiting.”
“I’ll follow your lead.” He says, heartbreakingly firm and honest, and Tony feels like he means it as more than just leaving an extra 100 in the hotel room.
Clint Barton whispered, just enough for Captain Rogers to make out, “I shall give it to her shall I?” and he as clearly heard Antonia giggle and say with notable warmth, “No you must not, you shall not indeed.”
“Pretty?” Maria crows, eyes cunning, “Beautiful rather. She is stunning, my darling girl.”
Tony acknowledges him with a grunt but keeps on working and Steve reaches for his sketch pad he keeps on the desk and the pencils stored in the top drawer. They sit in the quiet for hours, the only noise Steve’s pencil scratching against paper, occasionally peppered by Tony asking questions or opinions.
“I have excused you for too long, and you have grown indulgent in the room we have allowed you. I would do nothing but indulge you, and live happy for it. But not anymore. You, who she has known from an infant, who she has seen grow up from a period where her notice was an honour, to have you now, in thoughtless spirits and arrogant pride laugh at her, humble her. Before her niece and before others, some of whom would be entirely guided by your treatment of her. This was badly done, Antonia.”
The air hits him like a slap, stinging his uncovered cheeks and making his eyes water. Clamping his hands to his sides, he falls faster than a stone and the wind whistles in his ears.
“No, Pepper, dear heart. The fault lies with me. I thought Mr. Hammer worthy of love, but instead he’s a rogue.” The words are reminiscent of Steven’s, and Antonia’s voice catches furiously on the curse. Pepper’s tears fall abundantly as Antonia speaks, only furthering Antonia’s belief that Pepper was truly the superior creature of the two. Incensed now at the sadness she had bestowed on her friend, she could no more than swear to herself that she would not allow this state to linger around her friend for long.
“Don’t have a favourite sports team? Great, it’s now the New York Yankee’s, no argument.” Steve jokes before his tone turns somber, “and I suppose I rush because. Because well, that’s maybe a good way of telling you I serve in the United States Military, and I ship back out for another tour tomorrow. I didn’t know - I didn’t think -“ Steven starts, before exhaling on a sad note, “I didn’t know I was getting to meet you today.”
Maria Stark’s eyes grew stormy, “If I could allow her to travel alone without the constant worry probably sending me into an early grave, I would. But as it stands I simply want what is best for her within the comfort and safety of Highbury. And whatever she wants within that, she will have. Antonia wants for nothing, yet I see her bored to her wits end. The books that litter our house have been thumbed over so much the letters are near faded. Every nook and cranny explored and discovered. If Virginia will allow her to be challenged, then she can be allowed to do so.”
He had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did, to spend his evening at Hartfield. Antonia and Pepper were going to walk; he joined them, and on returning, they fell in with a larger party. Mr. and Mrs. Marvel and their son, Miss Hill and her niece, and the Hammers, who had accidentally met. They all united; and on reaching Hartfield’s gates, Antonia, who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that her mother would welcome, invited them in offering tea and an enjoyable end to the evening.
“Yes, yes, pray pass me,” added her husband, with a sort of sneering consciousness, “I have nothing to say that can entertain Miss Stark. Shall we walk, Augusta?”
“I am delighted to hear you so moved on regarding the subject,” replied Antonia, smiling; “but you do not mean to deny that there was a time – and not so distant – when you gave me reason to believe you did care about him.”
“It’s my duty to know what my client might want on an evening and be prepared for it. I’m paid well enough to do so.”
Steve cuts off his babble with a stroke against Tony’s thigh, “I know you can. You are so good for me Tony. Look at you, so good for me already. Tell me what you need.” And he didn’t think this would come that easy, didn’t think that the command he threaded through his tone would be so familiar and comforting.
banging Tony Stark, with feelings involved. Who is one of our biggest clients, who we’ve just signed. You go to his office to discuss the contract, and manage to convince him to play along with your hairbrained scheme? On the fly? And what’s more it
He seemed very engrossed in writing a letter, and irritation scuttled across Antonia’s back at the notion that he could not pay her similar attention. “Mr. Barton told me that the Cages are to celebrate their new improvements with a party.” She says, out of nothing, just wanting to hear Steven’s voice.
The next decision was to the house; they must all go in and eat; and even once seated and busy Clint Barton still did not come. Mrs. Marvel looked, and looked in vain, believing it some attack of his grandmother that prevented him coming. Antonia looked at Pepper to see if disappointment played across her features, but she behaved very well, showing no emotion over the news.
Jarvis drives Tony back to MIT, only stopping for an hour to refuel at a diner just off the interstate.
“What the
Antonia attempted to smile but it felt more like a grimace, she couldn’t tell which offended her more. Mrs. Hammer talking of Donwell like it was hers, or calling Highbury
It was well to have a comfort in store on Virginia’s behalf. As Clint Barton’s arrival had succeeded Mr. Hammer’s engagement in the conversation of Highbury, now Clint Barton had disappeared, no sooner did Mr. Hammer reappear in everyone’s minds and mouths, much to Antonia’s dismay. With it brought the wedding day named, and Clint Barton was forgotten. She yet again idly wondered whether the ease in which he left her mind suggested her fanciful notion of being in love was wrong, but she left that in her head for another time to examine. Antonia grew sick of the sound of Mr Hammer’s happy day, particularly because it seemed to drive a knife into Pepper’s heart with every utterance.
“What is it, my dear friend? Something of an unpleasant nature has obviously occurred – let me know directly what it is. I have been walking all along in suspense, and you know how I abhor surprises, particularly those that are unpleasant.”
“Oh!” Antonia crowed, “To be sure, always utterly inconceivable to a man that a woman should ever dare to refuse an offer of marriage. A man always imagines a woman to be ready for anyone who asks her.”
He wonders if all marks feel like this, spares a moment to feel sorry for those who don’t, then returns to feeling viciously glad that it feels like this for him, for them. If he gets this, if he gets Steve panting against his mouth like he’s ran a marathon, everything else doesn’t matter.
To Antonia’s horror, upon opening this parcel not only did it contain a gift from Mr. Rhodes two sisters (who adored the ground Virginia walked upon) but also a letter from Mr. Rhodes. A letter that was a proposal of marriage!
He would be sure to report this all back to the lady of the manor, for it seemed that only continued intervention of the two of them would succeed in moving these two hopeless cases forward this century.
The Clint Barton so long talked of, so high in interest, was actually before her – he was presented to her. And Antonia could admit that she did not think too much had been said in his praise: he was indeed a good looking young man, and his countenance had the spirit and charm of his father’s. She immediately felt at ease in his presence, that she should like him: and there was a well-bred ease of manner, and a readiness to talk, which convinced her that he came intending to be acquainted with her.
And, well, anything he doesn’t, Tony is sure to explain.
“I believe I have.” Pepper replied, quiet.
Unlike what movies would lead you to believe, consciousness is not sudden, but a slow, pain-staking process that starts with fingers twitching and ends with eyes opening an hour later, by which point Steve’s nerves are shot to dust and his palms are full of half-crescent marks from his fingernails so sharp they’ve drawn blood.
“That’s it honey,” he says, and he reckons Tony might have something to say about the nickname later, but
“Yes!” – said she, “Even Mrs. Stark has been persuaded to it. But… you will not want to go, Mr. Hammer, with Virginia so very ill?”
Steven now lived but a mile from Hartfield, visiting often to her mother’s delight; who loved him every part as much as she did Antonia, apparently for his “words of advice and wisdom”. He split his time between his own sprawling estate and London where he visited his friends from his time in the infantry often. Antonia loved her mother dearly, but her inability to relinquish the hold on her was close to stifling at times. She had never travelled beyond Highbury, never visited the world as she so longingly wished to. How she wished, every time they waved Steve off, to just jump into the carriage and ride off with him to London!
So he lay in bed, not sleeping, barely breathing. He had no clue how lying to his friends had ended in feelings soaked in something frighteningly close to love. But he had always been this side of an idiot, so what else is new.
“So Bucky once was so well known for fucking up missions that our whole unit used his name for five years as a verb for shitting something up so horrifically.”
“Exactly. We both are!” Clint talks over him. He turns his gaze back to Tony who is hiding a grin behind
“I’ve had worse.” Tony, as ever, tries to crack a joke, though it falls flat in the otherwise silent room as they remember the experiences that have led Tony to experience ‘worse’.
He knows two things. The first is the irrefutable fact that Howard does not have a soulmark, he wears that fact like a badge of honour, that upon his sixteenth birthday, the day of the change, there was no burning in his soul. The second is that (for what it’s worth) not everyone is born with one - and in fact it is said you can love without one even if the love tastes different - but a couple where the balance is tipped and the scales don’t weigh the same will make for an unhappy marriage. It’s too much of a hill to climb, too much history to manage. These two facts scrabble for purchase in his mind, jostle his very heart for answers.
“Sleep my darling, we can talk of how glad we are to have you back when you have had a moment or two’s peace.”
Tony is the first Stark to be born with skin that isn’t ice to the touch. It’s an old story, one Howard likes to claim is folklore even though he knows the truth. It says that Stark men are made of iron and in birth they feel as cold as the metal they come from. He knows the heart of it, knows in medical notes discreetly buried that the attending physician at his own birth had noted how cold he was. Knows that some say it’s linked to Stark men never being burdened with a soulmark. Yet when he holds his son for the first time, he feels nothing but warmth transfer through skin-to-skin contact, and he stares down at this creation of his that even upon its first breaths defies him.
Mr. Hammer returned, a very happy man. He had gone away rejected, mortified and scorned by Captain. Rogers (
His meeting today is with Miss Potts, so the surprise is genuine when he steps into the room agreed upon and doesn’t just see the tall redhead, but the man of the hour himself. He recovers quickly, he thinks, from choking on air (and really, did Miss Potts need to offer him a glass of water with such amusement?) and smiles at his now-client with a grin that probably sidles on the manic, given Stark’s look of alarm.
Tiberius is cynical and witty and hates everyone. Tony likes him instantly, enjoys his hatred for what it is, honesty (and how he’ll laugh in years to come for ever thinking Ty honest). He smiles at Tiberius, a small and perilous thing barely deserving of the name, and Tiberius doesn’t call him out on it. In that instant, they are friends, if for a time. Two products of broken upbringings uniting in misery for as long as their leashes will allow them.
Maria’s cutlery scrapes across the china of her plate, “This starter was delicious, wasn’t it Howard?” She speaks quickly, voice trembling. Tony looks at her sharply. Maria never speaks, Maria is always silent, “Shall we ask Jarvis to bring through the mains?” She makes a move to get up, to start clearing the plates, lets cutlery clatter and picks up speed and sound.
“I think neither will do the other well.”
“I should not have thought myself so high above my station.” She muses, later, and it is all Antonia can do to not leap across to her friend and shut her mouth with her hands.
Steve feels the weight of his joy screaming through his skin. His hands skate over Tony’s figure, land on his ass, and make a home there. He absentmindedly kneads the flesh, delighting in the groan against his lips he’s rewarded with. They don’t break for what feels like an eternity, a battle to see who can crawl first into the other’s bones and stay there. Tony scrabbles for purchase against his shirt, needy fingers clawing at anything he can reach. Steve thinks he hears the rip of fabric, and idly thinks about how this is one of his favourite shirts, before he can think of little else than Tony’s incredibly
brave and leaping before looking never letting Tony take the risk first.
“Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her, or that she admired him? It’s just that lately, I have imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment – secret looks and expressions, which I did not believe meant to be public.”
“Hey lover boys - we’re over here!” Bucky crows from their regular booth, and Steve waves an awkward two fingers before stepping closer to Tony.
“You sound proud of them,” Tony murmurs in response, before shaking himself, “and I appreciate that and the honesty. But right now my reputation is in pieces, my stock free falling, and I could use a home win.”
“You were just going to end up in a bizarre one-upmanship between you and Miss Hill. I don’t think your mother needs to watch that.” Steven jibed, “Besides, Bruce is here from London and looking for you.”
“And you can’t kick yourself whenever a piece of your technology doesn’t pull off.” And Steve finds himself quoting Natasha of all people (and how is that for irony considering she is the quietest of them all), “We cannot be angry for things that cannot be changed, Tony, we can only strive to make them better next time. I can only hope to duck faster.” He tries for a grin to lighten the mood and makes to leave. He imagines Tony is shattered and wants to be left alone.
,” He says, setting Steve in his sights, “need to get laid.”
by her
The kiss that follows is less sharp, slow and easy and there is too much teeth still cause neither of them can stop smiling. Steve can’t bring himself to care. He gets
So he presses a kiss to Tony’s forehead, cleans him up gently as Tony mewls and leans into the feeling in his sleep, and shrugs into his clothes thrown across the floor.
He stares at it for a while, completely wrapped up. He senses Tony’s gaze on him, and answers it with, “I wrote about how this piece is an artist’s answer to the Rorshach test. Pollock slicing open his veins, offering the world his blood, and demanding they answer him with what it resonates to each individual. It’s a perfect inkblot of humanity.” He stares at it a second more, fingers flickering out as though to touch it, before blinking and blushing, “I’m sorry, I’m sure I’m boring you.”
, she thought to herself.
“It’s my particular brand of hobo chic.” Tony counters, voice sharp because he does battle with words and sarcasm, can arm himself to the teeth with acerbic wit and insults meant to hurt. Bucky’s steady gaze tells him he knows it too.
She stares at him a minute, judging him quietly. Steve stays still, not moving an inch.
To dislike a young man, simply for being of a different disposition from himself, was unlike the liberal and intelligent mind she was always used to from him. His high opinion was one she valued overmuch because he never put stock into anything incorrect, but now she was not so sure. She had never believed for a moment it could make him unjust to the merit of another.
“Service! The very recollection, when I saw him coming to my rescue with a noble look, and my wretchedness before. In one moment such a change to be incandescently happy!”
and that is such an alien thought to the man who had nothing left to lose because all his friends are dead and gone he’s not sure whether to laugh or cry. He instead grabs Tony’s metal arm and pulls him close and grins right up into his face.
She watches as Steven takes a moment to digest her statement, before recalculating, “You
In the afternoon Steve brought the sunshine to Hartfield, and news followed him not soon after. Pepper had arrived shortly after Mr. Barton’s departure, and the two had been bent over the pianoforte for an hour. Admittedly, not much playing was occurring, simply whispers and giggles that caused Antonia to fall off the stool more than once.
She should have done better, for nothing but reaching forward and shaking Miss Hill out of the words that dripped from her mouth with abandon would stop her once she was in motion.
There, with spirits freshened, thoughts a little relieved, did she see Captain Rogers striding down the hill, coming towards them. He had always cut the most handsome, broad-shouldered figure, but her new realization of
“Pray Antonia,” said he, instead, “may I ask what the great amusement, the sting of the last word given to you and Miss Romanov, and am curious to know how it could be so entertaining to the one and so very distressing to the other.”
Certainly, she had thought his manners unnecessarily full of syrup and gallantry. There was being a gentleman, and then there was a façade that went no further than the surface. She had given him the benefit of the doubt, and had assumed that it was merely proof that he had not always lived in the best society, that true elegance was sometimes wanting.
“You alright there Steve?” Nat calls from across the fog, searing through the haze that’s cluttered Steve’s vision.
“But he speaks so highly of her. The interest he takes in her – his anxiety about her health. I have heard him speak – and so must you – of how well he finds her. He is an admirer of her skill with the pianoforte.” Even now, as these words found Antonia horrified, Natasha Romanov was sat at the keys of the Cages own piano, playing to entertain whilst Clint turned the sheets. Antonia watched Steve gazing on with a feeling akin to terror. “Mrs. Cage and I believe the pianoforte may even have come from him, rather than the Mr. Murdock we believe. He is just the person to do it, even if not for love.”
“It is in fact, I maybe started wrongly. It does not
, their hopes, dreams, aspirations. There I am the expert.”
And, well, it got repealed. And I couldn’t wait.”
When the monster finally gives way with a shriek, Steve can’t resist looking round to grin at Tony, and in that moment of distraction, he misses the beast’s tail swinging round.
“Can this be true?” Antonia wondered aloud, tears threatening to colour her eyes.
“Do not attempt to sway me from this conversation Maria,” Steven sighed, “I know you far too well. I will not attempt to deny Antonia’s being pretty.”
“It’s not like he has feelings!” Tony cries back, heart full and heavy. He has the window rolled down, breathes in the air that hits his lungs, lets it burn and snap in his throat.
Tony is silent, which is unlike him, and only speaks up to agree with Bruce.
Frank was standing by her as Steven did his rounds as host, but not steadily; there was a restlessness, which showed a mind not at ease. He was looking about, he was going to the door, he was watching for the sound of other carriages – impatient to begin, or afraid of being always near her.
All at once, it’s like the light goes out from Virginia’s eyes. Her shoulders wilt and she takes a moment before replying, quietly, “Oh. So – so you think I should refuse him then?”
his stifled laughter. Mr. Hammer continues in this syrup-like fashion; anxious about her comfort, so delightfully interested in her mother, excitable about Mrs. Marvel, and even crowing about Antonia’s own drawings with so much zeal yet so little knowledge it seemed so terribly intimate that she nearly forgot her good manners on several occasions. For her own sake, and Virginia’s, she could not be rude in hopes fortune would turn out right. Yet how it pained her to be civil when news was stirring amongst the others, yet in the height of Mr. Hammer’s nonsense she could not understand it! She heard enough to know that Mr. Marvel was giving some information about his nephew; she heard the words “my nephew” and “Clint” repeated several times over, yet before she could quiet the nonsensical Mr. Hammer, the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would be awkward.
The one luxury of Tony’s house that Steve loves more than life itself, is Tony’s bathroom.
“Break it to me!” cried Antonia, absolutely aflame with panic now, “Oh is it Captain Rogers? Tell me at once – please!” her voice was loud, shaking. “Do not attempt concealment from me.”
“Oh look how well Miss Potts looks, how prettily she dances!”
Clint flips him off, “Shut up Stark and either come the fuck in or fuck the fuck off.”
“Your friends are great.” Tony says, breaking the heavy silence, voice soft, “Really great.”
Mrs. Marvel. To come amongst us with affection and faith engaged, but with manners so very disengaged. And how could she
“But to walk quite so alone – let my mother’s servant go with you. Or – indeed! Let me order the carriage, it can be round in five minutes.”
Pepper’s smile was beatific, and Antonia felt her heart twist at how striking a couple Steven and her looked. Pepper’s marble skin contrasting with the golden tones of Steven, her fiery hair clashing wonderfully against his blonde.
“But you are so assured. So sophisticated.” They share a laugh, slightly stilted.
Mr. and Mrs. Bruce Banner were not detained long at Hartfield. The weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move; and Maria Stark having, as usual, attempted to persuade Elizabeth to stay with all her children, being obliged to see them off.
. And this amplification of feelings between them only served to feed that drumbeat of ownership back to Tony, who, damn him,
Steven stops her in a rush, “Oh, no please. Antonia. Please allow me to apologize first, I was improper and out of turn in my words.”
Antonia could do little else but reach forward in a kiss achingly tender. She catches his lips, once, twice, teeth clashing as they both cannot stop smiling. “I find, I do not know what to think.” She says, before he grins, wide and ecstatic, and reels her in by her jaw to mark her lips with his once more.
would he not mention it in the letter? Why would he risk her reputation? A
She was the only child of a most affectionate and indulgent mother; and had, as such, the use of their sprawling household as she saw fit. Hartfield was a large estate, and her mother often commented on how she brought movement and noise into it, the lifeblood of its brick walls. Her father had died too long ago for him to be any more than a whisper of a thought; and his place had been supplied by an excellent man as household butler Jarvis, who had fallen little short of a father in affection.
He knows that Cayce suggests that all souls are born androgynous, that they halve upon separation from God and the marks are placed upon each part to call the other home again. He knows that Greek mythology calls them a kiss from Zeus, that the Chinese believe the matchmaker god Yue Lao creates souls together and when they are ripped apart leave them with matching scars that can mend and make them whole again. It is all achingly romantic and idealistic and nauseatingly perfect. It's so far away from science and order and math it may as well be in another language.
Steve laughs, incredulous, and senses the room nod in agreement, “I do not need to get laid.”
as his boyfriend. The look on Fury’s face when Steve turned in the official paperwork to sign off on them dating was possibly the best moment in Tony’s life.
“If Mrs. May wishes to dance,” said he, “I shall have great pleasure. Though my dancing days are beginning to come to an end as an old married man, it would do me great pleasure to stand up with an old friend like Mrs. May.”
“You’re not using that excuse because I happen to know a demi-god who sticks to his bedtime routine better than a two year old.” He chides, and Tony chuckles. The laugh makes Steve’s chest practically burst with pride that
It is of course Steve’s luck that when things are just beginning to look up something destroys the fragile hope that had begun to bloom in Steve’s chest.
“Antonia, I thought we were beyond lying.”
Her views of improving her friend’s mind by reading and conversation that was useful, had never led yet to more than a few chapters scattered here or there, not to Virginia’s attempts. It was Antonia who was far more easily distracted, much more pleasant to allow her imagination range and work so fluidly with Virginia’s own, than be constrained by novels Antonia had read thrice over.
“You can’t call a robot Dum-E, Tony!” Steve laughs, eyes on the road, “it’s not very nice.”
“Steve,” Tony huffs an incredulous laugh, “kinda hanging on by a thread here. If you continue down that path I don’t know how long I’ll last.”
“Hmm... I’d say the homophobia, darling.” Steve answers from behind him, hands already firm and kneading at the knots in Tony’s shoulders, rolling out a groan from Tony’s lips.
Nevertheless, she smiled and inclined her head slightly, noting how the set of Mr. Hammer’s shoulders relaxed upon this assent. Tucking the portrait lovingly back into her reticule, she turned to focus once more on finishing the portrait of Virginia, encouraging Mr. Hammer to compliment her at every turn.
Antonia turned back towards Donwell, smiling when her eyes caught on Captain Rogers stood not far away. She bound up to him with a grin and a playfulness that had his eyes soft with indulgence.
Steven barks a harsh laugh at this, grating, “No, he is not her equal. He is far her superior.” Antonia laughs in return, “Your infatuation with that girl blinds you. Miss Potts is a natural daughter of nobody knows whom. She is bright, to be sure, but with no experience and little education to lend her. She has no settled provision at all, and certainly no respectable relations. At her age she can have no experience, and whilst her wit protects her it won’t do anything but comfort her if she grows older and alone as gossip shrouds her for rejecting the one man who loved her to abandon!”
Steve’s tirade seems to run him weary, for he steps back, looks down at the ground. In the pause Antonia’s eyes fill, but she for once is speechless, dancing on the knife edge that this conversation is. All too worried that one more wrong word might banish her from him forever. And that thought seizes her heart like a vice.
Rousing from reflection, and subduing her emotion, she turned to Pepper again.
worth fighting for), he stumbles out whilst Steve is still asleep and wanders down to the local tattoo parlour.
Steve packs a bag that evening, clothes folded and filed into his rucksack with a military precision that was drilled into him all those years ago. He avoids the rest of the group, embarrassed at how his actions must have been so loud for the rest of them to be worried. He’s not angry at them, he can’t be, and it is the team’s duty to look out for each other. He’s just disappointed in himself, frustrated he couldn’t be a strong enough leader.
for sending me
said it would be rude of them to ask.”
A joke murmured whilst Fury is talking.
Steve pauses on his way to the practice room when he hears a frustrated yell from down the hall. He walks up to the door the noise came from quietly, and knocks. When he gets no response, he wanders in to find Clint struggling to get from his wheelchair to the sofa. He darts over to help, but the movement is arrested when Clint growls.
And, well, Steve’s never been one to shirk orders. Especially when they come wrapped up in a package so stunning.
“I hope you did not venture far, Miss Romanov, this morning, or I am sure you must have been wet – We scarcely got home in time. I hope you turned directly.”
His clothes are now nearly starched onto him, sleep hardened with sweat enough to make him wrinkle his nose at himself. It’s a quick job to clean himself up in the attached small bathroom underneath the dim light that flickers like a candle. It’s longer work to summon the strength to shuck his own clothes aside his boxers and pull on a jumper and shorts of Steve’s, because yet again his mark is perfect and has left them folded ready for him. He’s reminded vividly of their differences, the wrists of the shirt comically hiding his hands, the bottom of it scuffing the tops of his thighs. He pulls the drawstring of the shorts tight around his waist, in a futile effort to keep them from slipping.
Tony doesn’t need to ask who. He only has to look at how she thumbs over the flowers at her wrist to know who she means.
"Mr Carbonell..."
“Mr. Hammer, stop this at once. You have obviously been drinking! Might I even dare remind you of your attachment to
Clearly, none of them listen, because the first words out of Bucky’s mouth are, “So Tony, Clint tells me he found you two a minute away from decorating your conference room yesterday.” And Steve can do nothing but inhale the beer he’d just began to sip up his nose ensuring he sounded like a dying cat. And based on the grin Bucky gives him, he knew exactly the reaction he’d intended on.
The persons to be invited, required little thought. Besides the Hammers, it must be Captain Rogers and the Marvels; so far it was all of course – and hardly less inevitable than Pepper making the eighth. Antonia had preferred to spare her the occasion, to have to see Mr. and Mrs. Hammer together in nauseating togetherness, yet she was adamant she would be fine. Antonia admired her for it, but she would not pretend to understand workings of the heart. She invited Miss Romanov, aware it may make it uneven as a pack and that Mrs. Hammer was more than likely to comment, but she could not care when it was her own house and her own guestlist. She rather thought that if Mrs. Hammer took to calling the Captain
“Not all bad I hope.” He says, and Tony blinks out of whatever reverie he was in.
Of course, Antonia could not stew for long. But she could definitely be miserable for longer – what an awful business! It destroyed everything she had wished for – each blasted part of it pain and humiliation. And most of all, god, the pain for Virginia. She would have gladly suffered all the pain and humiliation alone, to spare the effects of her blunder on anyone but herself. If she hadn’t persuaded Virginia into liking the man, she could have borne anything. He could have doubled his efforts towards me, confessed devotion in public for everyone to see, should it have been solely confined to herself.
Because of this he tends to try eat alone, snatching a sandwich or piece of fruit here or there and then excusing himself from dinner early, rather than obsessively staring at the portions people take, ready to save whatever is left. On the field, he is the embodiment of a team leader, but at home he’s still the fish out of water who hasn’t a hope in hell of understanding half the cultural references Tony, Clint and even Bruce drop in conversation. He figures its best to save them the bother of having to explain every sentence, and the awkwardness of retelling and dissecting a joke just so he can understand it, by simply not showing up.
Steve catches one finger with his lips, pressed a kiss to the pad, “For you, bond of my own.”
“You don’t think I kick myself thinking I could have been under him as he fell?” Steve asked.
Her words seemed to have gone remiss, as Mr. Hammer stared out the windows before turning and looking at Antonia. He was so close Antonia could see the line of sweat beading his fat upper lip as it curled, “I don’t know when I have ever looked forward to an evening more. The modern days have indeed rendered carriages perfectly complete. One is so guarded from the weather, that not a breath of air can find its way without permittance. Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence – despite the snow that seems to be starting outside.”
He won’t let Tony fight alone, constantly one step ahead protecting him at the expense of himself.
“No offense, kid.” And Tony bristles like a particularly perturbed cat, he’s only three years younger than Steve, “but you look like death warmed up.”
“I’d wait for you forever.” Steve says, beautifully bare and honest and brutal.
He speaks of their little broken family and halfway through a story about Clint’s habit of leaving his romantic novels round the house Tony reaches out and grabs his hand. Steve is so grateful for the contact he has to choke a sob, and he looks up into Tony’s eyes, feeling a crick in his neck from the position he’s assumed for the past week.
Antonia thought he looked gorgeous like this, and it caused a vicious bite to her tongue, shaping her words to be acidic, “Why couldn’t you come in a coach?”
Tony doesn’t think he can really be blamed for crashing into that tower. It wasn’t his fault – it had just sprung out of nowhere. Besides, he’d build them a better one. One with lasers and shit. People love lasers.
And so they forget, for a little while.
Tony looks up with soft, dark eyes. “I’m amazing – it’s just – well, let’s just say you are definitely in proportion. I’m going to feel you for days.” The last is on a whisper, sending arousal shooting up Steve’s spine. Tony tracks his shudder with a sudden laser like focus, “Oh you
“Hey – HEY GET OFF ME.” Clint starts slapping his chest, and Steve just laughs before depositing him as gently as he can onto the couch.
So lost in his thoughts, he doesn't recognize Sam's stupidly obvious attempts to get a good camera angle.
“What news do you mean?” replied Antonia, unable to guess by Pepper’s happy countenance, what news she could mean.
“Now I will tell you something, in return for what you have told me. He did speak yesterday, or indeed he wrote, and was refused.” She shrugged, and made to move across the room. That flower arrangement by the portrait of her parents needed fixing to be sure.
“You have done remarkably well, Miss. Stark,” said he; “You have made her a graceful beauty whilst teaching her much of custom and etiquette. She was a beautiful creature when she came to you, but the additions you have added are infinitely more superior.”
And Steve, the little shit that he is, is smirking like he knows, keeps tilting his chin up to bare his throat in submission that licks at the flames of Tony's desire. Tony doesn't think he could love him more. Steve, behind closed doors, is filthy. Steve is dirty, Steve is rough and gorgeous and dangerous. Steve will try anything at least once, and then he'll try it again to make sure he was right the first time. Steve will wear lace under his stealth uniform and find a way to text Tony about it halfway through a covert operation when he's informed by insider info
hit metal, he chokes out a sob of relief and works feverishly to remove the rest of the brick that covers Tony. Without a second thought he rips the face plate away like Thor did in the last battle Tony lay down on the wire and he’s only partly conscious of the fact tears roll down his face.
The officer who meets them on the ground is tall, swallows up the sun, speaks loudly to be heard over the helicopter’s blades as they wind down. “Mr Stark, Ms Rogers, with me.”
“Oh yes, ever since Natasha left the vicarage to live with Captain Coulson. Like her parents, Miss Coulson is kindness itself, she is elegant and gracious. Even if she is not as … handsome as Natasha.”
“Obadiah Stone speaking.” The voice is friendly, warm, but Tony knows what’s below the surface. Obie is a politician through and through, and Tony knows better than most than you don’t want to arm him with secrets unless you fancy being blackmailed. But it’s this, or it’s Howard. And Maria’s warning still rattles in his chest.
The bacon on the stove burns. Forgotten. Steve wrestles his lips from Tony, takes a step back, Tony mesmerised by the rhythm of his chest rising and falling. “Wait.” Tony’s not sure if that’s directed at him or directed at Steve himself, “Wait.”
“Oh.” Steve says, “Me too.”
“How did you all meet?”
“On that Antonia, trust me if my father or mother was still alive, not even Cerberus could keep me away. I would rather answer to family than be my own master.” The words are spoken with feeling, and Antonia wants to pull her own back into her mouth.
“You’re passionate, I can get behind that.” Steve answers, “I like ambition.”
Mr. and Mrs. Banner, upon marrying, had quickly moved to London, for Mr. Banner’s line of work. A doctor by trade, Bruce Banner was a tall, gentlemen-like man not only highly intelligent, but also in the line of work that could afford to pay him well for his thoughts. Sometimes out of humour, he was not an ill-tempered man; but his temper was not his great perfection. He could sometimes act ungracious, or say a severe thing. As such, Elizabeth Banner paired him so perfectly it seemed faultless.
“In all seriousness though, what’s going on? You’ve got bags on bags on bags under your eyes.” Clint asks.
This is a shockingly long note already, but I want to say thank you AGAIN to everyone who stuck with this and even those who didn't. It's been something I've thought of deleting every time I see it, or even orphaning it, because of how I never finished it. I'm glad I stuck it through, and I hope you are too.
Safety in numbers must be sought, she resolved, and as they were just approaching the house where lived Miss. Hill, she determined to call upon them. Miss. Hill loved to be called upon, and they were quite safe from any letter from Natasha Romanov by her calculations.
When Sam slinks back a couple of minutes later, ready to be chewed out, he is incredulous at the story Steve grants him.
He moves closer, slowly, giving her every opportunity to push him away, but Antonia finds herself loathe to do anything but wait for his arrival with pursed lips and heavy eyelids. She can practically count every eyelash. Yet suddenly, the moment is shattered between them as the far off sound of a door closing breaks into their reverie. Steven’s hand drops, and he quickly steps back, Antonia having to will her body not to follow him into his intoxicating space again.
But will there be enough good room for the couples to dance – I really do not think there will.”
you will treat him no better than a street urchin! You have an inflated sense of self, one far worse than what I ever thought. It would be better to be without wits than to apply them as you sometimes do, Antonia!”
The kind-hearted, gentle Mrs. Marvel had left her seat to join him and say, “Do you not dance, Mr. Hammer?” to which his prompt and slick reply was, “Most readily, Mrs. Marvel, if you will dance with me.”
She missed Steven’s eye roll.
The misfortune of Virginia’s cold had been pretty thoroughly gone through before her arrival. Mrs. Stark had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it, as well as the history of his own and Elizabeth’s arrival, and Antonia to follow, when the others appeared. Mrs. Marvel, almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to her, was able to turn away and welcome her dear Antonia.
The doctor pushes Steve out the way, syringe at the ready, and that just appears to anger Tony more, who begins thrashing and panicking on the bed, tangling in the sheets. Steve struggles for his own voice, unsure where he stands and overwhelmed with relief that Tony is awake. However when two nurses pin Tony’s arms down with force and have a syringe of sedation poised he jolts himself out of the reverie he was stuck in and strides forward.
“No.” Antonia replies, catches her mother’s glance and quickly makes sure to follow, “but Highbury has all I want. I never need to travel.”
of your bedroom a particular fashion statement? Maybe I should bring my own to match.” Steven delivered with a smirk and a glint of humour in his eye, and Antonia felt an unbecoming flush rising to her face, hurrying to put herself together. This side effect of Steven’s attention was becoming increasingly hard to bear, making itself apparent this past season.
“But Miss Hill and Miss Romanov!” said Mr. Barton, looking around, “We thought you were to bring them.”
Apparently karma had actually banked him an entire shitload of good vibes because there was no possible way Tony’s life could be going
“Well shit, Tony. What’s in it for me?” Obie sounds indulgent, sounds like a shark scenting blood. Tony’s walking wounded, feels like if he presses a hand to his chest he’ll find a bloody mess there. But all he can think is
"I don't know why you are smirking. For once I'm not being presumed to be the one dragging down this relationship." Tony counters, practically ignoring the hotel staff now.
There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. Bruce Banner, in this short visit to Hartfield, going about every morning amongst her old acquaintances with her child in tow, and talking over what she had done every evening with Antonia and Maria, two very close friends falling just shy of blood relative in affection. She had nothing to wish for otherwise, other than that the days did not pass so swiftly.
In that moment, Steve doesn’t see Tony as a genius or a billionaire or a playboy or a philanthropist because the Tony before him is just a man.
This wretched note was the finale of Antonia’s breakfast. Once it had been read, there was nothing to do but lament and curse. The loss of the ball 0 the loss of Clint – and anything he may have been feeling – too wretched! What an evening it would have been and everybody to be so happy!
Steven, her beloved friend, required her, and she would not disappoint. Cost her what it would, her heart breaking like glass beneath her breast, she would listen.
“In short,” said he, “perhaps, Miss Stark, since you do know everything – I think you can hardly be without suspicion.”
Tony waits until the room is finally empty before he breaks down.
. He can’t help but kiss any part of Tony he can get his hands on, kiss down his throat, his collarbone, until he’s face to face with the mark that shows the world that this gorgeous, beautiful man is
“Don’t - my control is - it’s not great right now.” Steve admits, “and I want to know you, want to love you. Don’t want our first time reduced to a quick thing with Bucky in the room next door before I’m called back to war. I want to spend days learning every little thing that makes you tick, want to spend lazy days with you. Want to visit you on campus, and meet Rhodey. I want everything, and I’m willing to wait for it. Can you?”
“Thank you Tones.” Steve says, voice soft. Tony still has one of his hands clasped in his, though he’s lowered it from his heart, and Steve gives it a quick squeeze, reaching forward to kiss him with dry lips. It’s quick and there’s no heat, but the pair feel better for it.
It was no wonder that a train of twenty young girls followed her to church like ducklings. Mrs May was a plain woman but who bore the brunt of hard work in her youth and as such felt she deserved a seat at Hartfield, occasionally losing a few sixpences at Maria’s fireside through a particular thrilling game of cards.
“Ah Miss Stark, how kind you are! I suppose you may have heard and are come to give us joy. This does not seem much like joy, indeed, in me – it will be trying to part with her. But she wrote all morning, terrible headache now, such long letters – to be written to Murdock and others. Tears in her eyes perpetually. She has accepted the situation for a governess found by Mrs Hammer.”
The day they've had has been utterly ridiculous from start to finish. Tony thinks he can still feel ash clinging to his skin, smoke embedded in his pores. The tower was a mess, wires exposed against the walls like raw nerves, rock and rubble littering the floor. They'd stayed long enough to confirm the lab was secure, to make sure everyone was safe, before Tony had taken the initiative to book a hotel not too far away under a false name to avoid press and whisk his new husband away.
She noticed Mrs. Marvel, who looked perfectly wretched now, look past her at the door, and upon looking glanced Mr. Marvel standing, abjectly miserable. She controlled herself, in a far better state than she would of done months ago, and forced through a smile, “I suppose, then, we should wish them very happy.”
Antonia wasn’t so sure.
“The same way we do when we all watch you nearly die on us each time Steve.” Natasha says sadly, “We don’t.”
“Apologies, Steven, I do not know what I spoke of.”
“Unless,” Steve stops now, desire doused in a wave, mistaking the look he sees now in Tony’s eyes as regret, “Unless, unless you don’t want to.”
that, don’t you. Like the idea of me thinking of you with every step, feeling the delicious slide of you for hours. Flushing red in meetings with every cross of my legs.”
In order to prevent Mr. Marvel’s knowing eyes digging into her, she thought and realized yet another road block to the ball that never seemed to be able to appear, “Ah!” she cried, “but the Crown is not free anymore for our ball! We may be struck down yet!”
“How are you so perfect?” Tony asks huskily, perhaps a shade too close to real and unflinchingly honest. Steve, god love him, doesn’t break for a moment, hitting stride with his character now enough to make Tony cramp with lust.
In spite of all her faults, she had assumed that she was dear to him; so dear, in fact, that no other woman held more esteem in his eyes than she did, and she had believed this to be in due course of family affection until now. The idea of being like a
After a few minutes of entire silence between them, Bruce Banner began with –
It takes a moment to get familiar with the feel and taste of Tony, opening his mouth wide and letting Tony’s cock sit there before closing his lips around him and sucking. Tony shouts and arcs against him with an aborted thrust that has him pushing up further into Steve’s mouth, deep enough Steve can feel him against the back of his throat, and he swallows against the sensation of a cough. His finger slips into Tony’s dark heat in the movement, and he pumps it experimentally a few times, lust twisting his gut at the sounds he rips from Tony.
Now, Antonia knew, this had to be perfectly orchestrated, else lose the appeal completely. She dressed Virginia up in some of her finest attire, cinching the waist in where it was slightly too large (and oh, how that wounded her ego some). She curled Virginia’s hair with her iron and made sure it framed just so.
“Very true – Well, a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have Natasha Romanov walking home again, late at night, and cold as the nights are now. And as I looked at her, it struck me that she was heated, and therefore be liable to take cold. Poor girl! I could not bear the idea of it, so I spoke with Mr. Marvel and we agreed.” Her voice grows hushed still, and Antonia has to strain to hear her over the other voices echoing in the room.
Steve laughs, “He could bench press an entire house and I still wouldn’t care. I want
“Bruce, London looks good on you.” Maria voiced exactly what Antonia was thinking. Bruce wore not only London, but marriage, well. He’d always carried a slightly harried look, as though everything was all too much at once, but it had weathered into contentment and pride, in particular gazing upon his wife and babe. “But pale. How I wish you had come here in autumn, rather than the seaside.”
man break out into a cheshire grin.
Tony shakes his head, “Steve.”
She grinned as he opened the door for her, and held her hand as she stepped into the carriage. “See now
Tony removes himself from Steve’s lap slowly, like he can’t bear to do it, trailing his arm across Steve’s shoulder in a way that sends shivers up Steve’s spine. There’s surprise in Tony’s eyes, but also a wicked glint that’s making Steve realize that yes, this could distinctly get worse.
“Have you never heard that good things come to those who wait?” Steve replies, near panting through the desire that clogs his throat.
“Ah, Mrs. Stark I suppose.” Mrs. Hammer said, not kindly, with a sneer affixed to her face.
Antonia was always struck by how Pepper could hide remarkably clever musings within a shy and faltering countenance. The intelligence, and beauty, of the girl could not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connections. The acquaintances she had formed on her stay away in the country were unworthy of her. The friends from whom she had just parted, although very good sorts of people if what Pepper was saying was to be true, must be doing her harm.
“Tony will survive Steve, I am sure of it.” Thor, as ever, is honest and direct, not beating around the bush or hesitant to offer anything but a 50/50 verdict like the doctors Steve is beginning to loathe. He clasps a hand on Steve’s shoulder and squeezes, “He’s got too much left to give this world.”
“Oh, hey Cap.” She murmurs, and Steve thinks it best not to comment on how her eyes are an angry red.
“Never be sorry,” Tony says, voice fierce, “You are safe. You are here. You are mine.” The words are soaked in fierce adoration, “Sam said it was likely they’d kick up again as your mind begins to process therapy.”
with it. He should be worried about Bucky wandering in, should be worried about what his mother thinks of his empty bed. But he can’t think of anything else but Steve’s lips on his own, can’t think of anything but his mark taking on its own heartbeat against his neck.
Antonia had not thought him this deeply in love that the mere thought of leaving her cost him so. She did not know how to feel, how to look. How did one behave when in love? Why did no one tell her?
“Yeah, sorry. Didn’t mean to kidnap you.” He says, tone hollow, and Steve shakes his head.
It feels like the first time Steve got tinnitus. They’d been ambushed, off a chokepoint in the providence of Kandahar. Steve had always had good hearing, and it had probably saved his life, the fraction of time he’d heard the high pitched screech of mortar shells giving him a head start to scream “Down!” and pull him and Bucky to the desert floor. They’d been blown back with the force of it, an odd ringing piercing Steve’s ears, looking up and terrified that he couldn’t make out what Bucky was screaming.
Virginia marry James Rhodes, it is impossible; she has refused him, and so decidedly, I think, that will prevent any second application. I won’t pretend I did not influence her a little, but I assure you she doubted the match more than I had any sway in. I can imagine that before she had seen anyone superior, she might have tolerated him. But having been accustomed to my office now the case is far altered, and she knows what gentlemen are now. Nothing but a gentleman with education and manners has any chance with Virginia.”
The air turns syrup thick as they both have a moment to realise what’s to come. Tony, proudly and gorgeously naked spread out underneath Steve, chest to chest, skin to skin. Tony pulls at his trousers with grabby hands and Steve huffs an indulgent laugh before pushing his pants down and off until they are both finally and gloriously naked together.
Rhodey and Pepper leave early next morning at his request, with promises they will come back and drag him out for lunch later. Tony smiles, a broken and limp thing, and tries to summon the energy to nod along. He feels so unbelievably empty.
“Positive.” Steve steps out the bed, pulls Tony by the wrist behind him.
"I'd make an
nobody speaks except ourselves and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people.”
So that had happened, and it was amidst the dust and rubble with Clint cackling in his ear and Natasha muttering about stupid idiots who should learn to drive their fancy machinery that Tony realised he was several shades of fucked.
“Hi Maria.” He says, because she, like Howard, has not only been deemed unworthy of the namesake of mother, but probably wouldn’t know what to do with such a title if she was granted it. She’s beautiful in a way full of melancholy and heartache, in a way that’s fragile and soft. Only her age betrays her, the slow and violent ravaging of time.
“Yeah well, I’m a curious kid.” He shrugs, scratches the back of his neck with a nonchalance he doesn’t feel. He can tell Ms Rogers doesn’t buy it.
is here and you left me in a room with Miss Hill? I think you have a sadistic streak Captain.” She is all set to continue when he hears laughter from outside.
“Steve. Trust me, I’m in your bed because I want to be here. I’m just embarrassed I fell asleep on you.”
“But leave it to me! Married woman are by far the superiors at this kind of thing.”
It was such a fate she found himself in one Friday afternoon before she noticed a broad figure cutting a swathe across the garden toward Hartfield.
This is
“Well, he is coming, you see; good news, I think. Well, what do you say to it? I always told you he would come back soon, did I not? Carol my dear, did I not always tell you so, and you would not believe me? In town next week, at the latest. As to her illness, all nothing of course. But so good to have Clint among us again, they will stay a while nearby and Clint will come and go as he pleases.”
Antonia was not really in a state of spirits to care about Clint Barton’s arrival, except the disappointment it brought to Randalls. The acquaintance at the time held no charm for her at all. She needed to be out of temptation, for a while, until she could be assured that Pepper’s heart was mended.
“I – yes.” Pepper says, voice soft now, “In my mind, there was no room for anybody else. I thought for a moment of James – but after the ball there was no mistake. When we talked about him, I thought it was utterly clear. There could be no room for error – I even spoke of his gallantry in saving me at the ball.”
So Steve agreed, because how could he not agree when the terms were that much in his favour? He could take on Stark Tower as a solo project and the team were unlikely to blink an eye - assuming it’s an excuse to spend more time with Tony. Which, at this point, is probably true.
century.
“I say nothing of which I am ashamed,” he replied, eyes sparkling with cheek, Antonia could feel Miss Romanov’s eyes on them both, wide and searching, “I saw you first in February. Let everyone on the Hill hear me if they can, since I first saw you I found you irresistible.” And then whispering, “Our companions are boring. What shall we do to rouse them?”
When he’d imagined his first time with Tony, he hadn’t expected much. He’d expected awkwardness and perhaps a bit of unease from both of them. He had never expected how comfortable he’d feel, how they’d both feel, how it’d feel as easy as breathing, as natural as everything else that has come to pass between them.
“What would Clint do without her?” Antonia speculated, wondering how Clint might be affected by the event, how benefited, how freed. She saw in a moment the possible good. Now, an attachment to Pepper Potts would have nothing to encounter. No hazard or road block to the contrary. All that remained to be wished was, that Mr Barton should form an attachment, but Antonia could feel no certainty of its being formed.
Tony nods, head like a puppet on string, “Yes. Yes. Please.”
“Never, madam.” He cried, “Never. Miss Potts is a very good sort of girl; and I am sure to see her happily and respectably settled, someone will look over her circumstance. I wish her well, but I am not, I think, quite so much to
“I resent the implication.” He puts his hand to his chest, mock offended, “I’ll concede to take back my ‘universal’ statement, and instead apply it to this room. You can’t deny your work has got better since you got together with ‘The Agent’, Clint.”
“I cannot believe that he has not the power of coming, if he made a point of it. A young man, brought up by those who are proud, luxurious and selfish, is likely to be proud, luxurious and selfish by default. If Clint Barton wanted to see his father, he would have contrived it between September and January. A man at his age – what is he? – three or four and twenty – cannot be without the means of doing just that. Of leaving under his own power. It is impossible.”
When he finally gets sweet and utter relief in the form of retreating back to MIT, he tells himself he’s excited to see Rhodey. He tells himself it’s unlikely a letter will have made it to him already, and that he should not get his hopes up.
“I was just telling your mother what a good pair you make.” Spoke Clint’s father in a clumsy fashion, “I told Clint you’d be his guide to Highbury!”
Yet when so many were devoting him to Antonia, Captain. Rogers began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with Natasha Romanov. He could not understand it; but there were symptoms of common intelligence between them, symptoms of admiration on his side, that he could not believe were entirely void of meaning. Antonia was not present when his suspicions were peaked. Dining at the Hammers with the Randalls family, and Natasha, when he spotted a look, no, dozens of looks, at Miss Romanov. From the admirer of Miss Stark, it seemed out of place. And once spotted it was all he could do to notice them like moths to a flame at every common connection.
“I am happy, that Mr. Murdock has furnished Miss Romanov with such a generous gift. Although you look skeptical.” Antonia eyes light up, “do you have another candidate?”
Steve doesn’t talk once, just watches the others, and is thankful for the contemplative quiet. It is there, sat round the table with the only people he’s met since waking up after the ice who don’t expect him to be anything other than what he can be, that the super soldier finally begins to try to heal.
“Who is trying to seduce who?” Natasha has somehow slipped into the room whilst Steve and Clint were holding conversation without them realising, and at this point Steve isn’t even surprised – the woman is all grace and poise and stealth.
Antonia had every reason to be satisfied with the party as she was with Captain. Rogers. She was received with a cordial respect which pleased, and given all the consequence she could wish for, and Mr. Barton approached her with a cheerful eagerness that marked her as his peculiar object, and at dinner she found him seated by hear – and, as she firmly believed, not without some dexterity on his side.
It speaks volumes about Steve and Clint’s friendship that the look has a specific category, and that this doesn’t even rank for the top five times it’s been wheeled out. Maybe top ten.
“Weymouth?”
Nat in his vision across the room, down and bleeding. He can smell death in the air, and fire in his lungs.
The last time he took a risk this miscalculated, he nose-dived a plane into the Atlantic.
“Well for once we are in agreement that those within the circle she resided in before meeting me were not good enough for her!” Antonia retorts weakly. To be on the receiving end of Steven’s disappointment was a heavy burden indeed, and one she was not accustomed to.
“I - Jesus Tony.” Steve starts, gathering the words as he moves to pull the bacon off the stove, switch it off. He comes back into Tony’s space. He puts his hands either side of his face, press a kiss to his forehead, his cheeks, his lips. “I want you so badly.”
Shield has been their local haunt for what feels like forever. They came for the 20% Armed Forces discount, but stayed for the greasy and sinful food that could quite easily force them into an early grave. It was run by Clint’s other half, Phil Coulson, who was so scarily efficient Steve had tried to recruit him for AVNG several times over. They ran a veteran outreach centre on the off hours, every Monday evening hosting any veteran who needed a helping hand, and therapy groups every Thursday. It was a second home, and bringing Tony into it panicked Steve, only because it didn’t nearly feel as weird as it should.
Antonia was more aware now than ever, that she loomed over Mrs. Marvel still, having not taken a moment to sit down opposite her before hearing the news. She had to steady her feet, “Natasha Romanov?” she spoke slowly, as though that would give her more clarity, give Mrs. Marvel time to take the words back. Mrs. Marvel could only nod. “You are not serious.”
Clint’s halfway through an anecdote that has Bruce cracking half a smile, betraying the tremors in his hand. Clint has an ability to set everyone at ease, to move past whatever is bothering them without even a look in that direction. When Steve has particularly bad nightmares and Tony is on the other side of the world unable to reach him, it is Clint that can be found in the kitchen, handing Steve a spoon and offering half of the opened Ben and Jerry’s tub without a word and Tony is eternally grateful. Steve has this stupid notion he has to hold everyone else up, to be strong so that others can afford to show weakness and Tony refuses to let him shoulder it all by himself.
Steve snorts into Tony’s hair, and Tony chuckles slightly against Steve’s collarbone before continuing. As he speaks he feels Steve slip back into sleep, and let’s a bone-deep contentment settle in his skin.
Steve grew louder, angrier with every word and it was all Antonia could do not to run backward and shove them all back in her mouth. “Oh I
Tony’s breath trembles, a frightened thing, and through slow going he finally comes to Steve as naked as he is.
“Your phone number got banned from phoning into Rocky 101 because you kept boring them with twenty minute segues into players form, I think that’s strong evidence to the contrary.” Natasha points out to muffled laughter.
“I did not know you could speak Chinese, Steven.” Antonia’s mother gracefully interjects, and she thinks everyone is thankful for the relief. Steven strides over from where he stood and grins, raking a hand through his hair.
“I have no quarrel with his trappings to family, I simply have quarrel with the fact we hear of him as an idle wanderer – why he was seen at Weymouth only a few weeks ago. This proves he can leave the Bartons. Yet he desires a trip of five or six hours to Weymouth over the two it would take him to grace his own family with his presence. This makes no sense to me.”
they were to get married, it is because they themselves wish to, not because you have schemed it.”
Tony flushes a deep wine red. He comes from a family of liars, he socialises with cheats and philanderers and sociopaths. He forgets how direct and achingly honest Steve can be, how he doesn’t hide behind pretense or joking words. Every single letter is chosen precisely for Tony’s ears. He stares at Steve for a pregnant moment, watches the flush begin to set in on his still gorgeously naked chest. He thinks of how that skin will feel against his own, how they’ll move together, and blushes nuclear.
Bucky makes his excuses at some point between dusk and dawn, bumping shoulders with a shattered Tony. “Hey,” he speaks quiet, like he’s trying not to frighten him, “it’s real good to meet you. I worried he wouldn’t find you quick enough.”
“Had you any idea,” Pepper asked softly, “of his being in love with her? It is clear now, unbelievably so, to the point I do not understand how it was not obvious to me.”
There was a little blush and then this answer.
He sighs as the doors close, rolls his shoulders.
kill him. He’s not immortal. No one can cheat death. No matter how hard he tries.
“You’re certain you want to do this?” She asks now, “Even knowing what it will cost you?”
He’s jolted back to the present when a far off sound makes him rip his mouth away, both of them heavy breathing and smiling against each other. He’s suddenly overwhelmingly aware that they are stood in the eaves of a house with enough eyes and spies for Howard it would make the White House jealous. “Not.” Tony says, “Not here. Do you have some place we can go? I won’t be missed”
“Miss Stark shall have to excuse me, Mr H, Rogers, Natasha. I am afraid I do not think I have anything remotely clever to say that will entertain.” Mrs Hammer’s words were heavy with judgement into the thick air.
Antonia then took a longer time for consideration. Should she proceed no farther? Should she let it pass, and appear to suspect nothing? Perhaps she might think her cold and angry without appearing to query where her thoughts were. No no, she must speak all she knows. Plain dealing was best, safer for both to speak.
“Not you, of course, you’re not the romantic sort.” Antonia bites out, missing Steve’s face falling, “But your cousin and Miss Ross…”
Without much preamble, Nat launches straight into it. She’s not one for small talk, it’s one of Steve’s favorite things about her.
“Tony, you look -“ Steve starts, stops, swallows. “Let’s just say you look better in my clothes than I do.” He’s stepping toward Tony like he’s powerless not to, trapped in Tony’s gravitational field. A pull as inevitable as gravity.
Mrs. Stark on the night was delighted, able to see one of her favourite young charges in the young Banner, and able to see one of her favourite older charges in Mr. Banner, devoted to making himself utterly agreeable for the whole evening.
“After that, you can have all the minutes you want. Jesus.” Tony’s voice is hazy and indulgent, and Steve feels a hand thread through his sweat slicked hair, strokes soft and slow. He lets out a rumble close to a purr, before shaking himself and pulling out slow enough they both whine with the renewed sensation.
“I’m going to ask Captain Rogers to teach me Chinese.” Antonia bolts headfirst into the conversation, earning her a stern look from Jarvis who sits to her mother’s right, and an indulgent look from her mother herself. Emboldened, she continues, “Do you think
you must have been with her all these years when you found her company so tiresome! How lucky she was for your mother and yourself to indulge her so when clearly she was such a bother!”
"Sweetheart, you can't help but see the best in people." Tony's voice is soft, before it hardens again, "unlike you, I've had enough experience to know differently."
and a lot more like
They part, and smile stupidly at each other for a minute more.
” Sam leers, eyebrows wriggling across his face in a gesture Steve assumes is supposed to be lewd but ends up looking like two caterpillars trying to fight across his forehead.
“Hey Shellhead.” The words are practically whispered, quiet and nearly shaking with relief, “Thought we’d lost you there.”
It seemed all too quick before the song came to an end, and Antonia looked up to Steven for the first time and became ensnared in his heated gaze. His eyes were nearly cobalt now, dark and stormy. He gazed on her with a look so turbulent she felt rudderless. He looked as though he was about to speak, his mouth opening before clicking shut again.
It was alone, basking in the view, that Steven found her. Out of spirits and out of sorts, she smiled at him, before it quickly slid off her face at his look of sadness and fury.
He takes a long breath, Steve’s hand a comforting weight on the small of his back, continues, “You think I can’t exist without your money? I can’t create without your company? Watch as I rise higher than you and burn it to the ground.”
“You’ll hear nothing but the truth from me. You always have. I have lectured you, I have scolded you, and you have not only born it like no other woman would, with your own observations – you have grown into a woman so incredible I am constantly amazed you would allow me to be in your presence.”
that greets him every time he does. It could be his wishful imagination, but he likes to think different. He wraps a scarf round once, twice, and finishes the look with a MIT beanie. It’s a particular brand of “hobo chic”, as Bruce likes to say, that suits Tony like a second skin. He’ll have to take it all off when he reaches the labs, because even he isn’t stupid enough to risk the wrath of his supervisors if he causes another fire this month on the premises. But he’ll hang Steve’s jumper up as close to him as he dares, make enough excuses to walk near and let the scent of Steve ground him in its wake.
Antonia sounded scorning and doubtful, huffing a laugh that had Steven balk, “Goodness me, no.” she gestured at him to sit down before her, and she sat opposite, the fire warming them both, “It was perhaps a little indiscreet, but the word certainly did not speak of an attachment between the pair. In fact, it’s about Miss Romanov seeming to have an admirer and Clint and I are working out who it is. A childish pursuit us fanciful folk like to pursue.
“You too, hotshot. The leather definitely suits you.” Tony’s eyes linger on his arms, and Steve resists an urge to flex, just barely, to show off.
accusations that I felt ill-equipped to do anything with than threaten him with my house, and yours, coincidentally. Oh what have I done.” And with that she deflated, would have sunk to the floor had Steven not caught her and wrapped her in his arms.
She deserves a better fate.”
“You said once,” Tony starts, voice fond and heavy and thick with emotion, “that you wanted to know me before we took this further.” He swallows, and Steve can feel Tony’s nerves dance across his chest like tapping fingers, but can feel that darker undercurrent of
“Oh you tease.” Tony says with a noise of shocked arousal, “How did I not know you were going to be an utter tease? Was I really good in a past life?”
If he takes a deep breath, Thanksgiving becomes nothing more than an ugly memory in his mind.
He’s not really aware of how the small class of students around him are still silent, of how Steve‘s face, at once joyful, has gone more and more solemn as the quiet has stretched. He’s red faced now, flush with embarrassment, moving to pull the ring box closed and back in his pocket.
The next chapter shall see the long awaited arrival of our Mr. Clint Barton! Oh and the upset it will bring...
“And so what if I did. I did no wrong. Mr Rhodes is a respectable young man, but I cannot admit him to be Miss Potts equal and rather show surprise that he should have even ventured to address her.”
Steve looks at him, really looks, and how can his eyes be so sad when his lips are still bee-sting red, his hair finger teased within an inch of his life, “Sure, T. I got you.”
“You have me.” The words are out of Tony’s mouth before he can stop them, choked out on instinct. He knows it to be a fact, as clear as the sky is blue.
Mr. Hammer guffaws, face sweaty and flushed, and Antonia is finally struck with how ugly he is, when he doesn’t have to please someone, “Oh of course, your only thoughts lie with that Captain!”
It’s some indeterminable amount of time later, that Tony comes back into himself like he’s just had the most incredible bout of lucid dreaming. Steve’s collapsed on top of him, the steady inhale-exhale of his chest the only beat Tony ever cares about, only song he’d listen to for the rest of his life.
“What an inference! He wishes exceedingly to come, his letters speak at length of his desire; but his uncle and aunt will not spare him.”
I'm so sorry this has been a long time coming - I couldn't seem to write Clint for the life of me. But we have a ball coming! Our first one - how exciting.
She came in quickly from the garden, with a look of harried escape, little expecting to meet Miss Stark so soon, startling slightly.
“So – uh – what are you working on?” he asks, inwardly cursing at how
Each has their demons they like to pretend don’t exist. Steve’s have brown eyes and a wicked attitude and in his nightmares they thump and beat at the ice as he stares wordlessly from beneath it. He thinks that’s what terrifies him the most, the fact that in his nightmares he makes no move to attempt to help them break the layer between them – just watches Bucky or Peggy or even Howard sometimes scratch and scream at the ice until it’s stained red with blood.
He stares at his love for as long as he can before blinking, filling up on the sight of him, feeling his equilibrium return.
He shakes the image free.
“A man can always, if he chooses, do his duty; not by maneuvering or finessing, but by vigour and resolution. It is Clint Barton’s duty to pay this attention to his father. He knows as much by his promises and his messages; but if he wished to do it it might be done. A man who felt rightly would sat at once, simply but firmly, to Mrs. Barton – ‘every sacrifice you will always find me ready to make to your convenience; but I must go and see my father immediately as a mark of respect to not fail him on this occasion’ – if he were to say to her with kindness but certainty, there would be no entreaty.”
“Capital idea! Miss Hill is certainly someone predisposed to always be happy, and Natasha can be one of our principal dancers.” Mr Marvel agreed as Clint stepped back to Antonia, taking her hand in his.
“How lucky that I should get to escort you this evening!” he remarked jokingly as they set off, “For if not, and we had not arrived at the same time to the Cages, surely you would not have been able to discern me as more of a gentleman than usual. You might not have been able to distinguish my more gentlemanly air this evening, and then the carriage would have obviously all been for naught.”
" He spits.
And well, Antonia was not known for her patience of character.
“I don’t think I’ve ever wanted someone like I want you.” Steve’s shocked by the words that fall out his mouth, and he thinks Tony is too, judging the look on the other man’s face. They aren’t a lie though, not even close, the words truthful and twisting his stomach in the way that only truth hurts.
“But! – I have never paid the slightest bit of attention to Miss Potts, except as your friend. For herself, I could care less if she lived or died.” Antonia gasped at such a confession, “No no no, everything I have done or said these past few weeks is to show my marked adoration for
“I speak of your regard for Miss Potts, this last month, your visits to Hartfield! And now you profess your love to me – what fickleness of character I am astonished! And angry!”
He’s naked in the way only true beauty can be, proudly and defiantly. Steve sees his hands shake and go up to hide his scars, but Steve pushes them away gently, reaching forward to kiss the puckered skin, causing Tony to groan long and low like it’s punched out of him.
“Well?” He asks, voice gruff, and Tony doesn’t have to think twice for what it means. He spares not a second to shake his head, hates the smirk that Howard fits to his face in response.
- again.”
Now Antonia was quite lucky, that Pepper did not seem so truly attached to Mr. Hammer as to cause any considerable upset. However, she still was grieving the passing of a romance Antonia herself had (with admitted idiocy) heralded as her one true great love. And Antonia hated to say this, but oh it made talking with Pepper tiresome at times! Any possible recollection, any possible memory, and Pepper was back reminiscing of the scoundrel. Why just in the market square this morning she had caught sight of a pair of gloves in a shop window that ‘looked so strikingly like the handsome pair Mr. Hammer had worn last summer, wouldn’t you agree Miss Stark?’.
Upon getting home last night, he didn’t sleep a moment. He could still smell Tony on him, an earthy smell of motor oil and cinnamon. He could still feel Tony’s hair under his fingers. He could still feel Tony’s hands on his back. He could press his palm into his spine and feel it catch on scratch marks left by Tony’s raking fingernails.
Steve allows it, too rushed and lust-fuelled to think anything of it. He doesn’t need the light to embed himself in Tony so deep they are both shaking well before they reach their release.
The pressure is overwhelming, the heat that slowly surrounds him intoxicating. He listens to Tony’s every gasp, stutter, and sinks slowly into a world he never wants to leave. The only sound their heavy breaths, Steve falls further, until he’s fully seated with a moan that tears out of Tony’s lips, mingled with a groan of his own.
Now the cynic in Antonia could see this engagement for what it was. Flattery and infatuation from what, objectively, is a handsome man to a young and naïve women was enough to have her indisposed to accept his advances. Not many aimed for what Antonia required from her match, and most were far happier to settle for less. And there was no shame in that, in and of itself, but the fact she had to smile at a woman settling for
“Miss Stark! We are in need of insistence that only you can give!” his voice was light and full of merriment already, the glass in his hand clearly not his first. But equally not so in his cups as to be embarrassing like Hammer.
“Don’t know what you are talking about, I’d dominate a fight with a bear. Like ‘Leo Dicaprio in The Revenant’ dominate.” Steve jokes weakly.
“The Almighty’s.”
The door handle shimmies once, a warning, and Tony leans in and asks a breathless ‘is this okay?’ and Steve is powerless in the face of such tornado like movement to do anything but nod his acquiesce.
“I am sorry my dear, but it is the truth.” Miss Hill continues, not aware of the odd atmosphere the room is adopting.
“Oh no! The letter must be all your own.” Antonia continues, “You write so prettily. You must be very clear and properly conscious of the pain you will inflict.”
being the key phrase.” He replied, before biting his lip, pausing a moment, and ploughing on, “But come, my dear Antonia, let us be friends again, and say no more about it. I will give you one apology, for my behaviour toward the end of our quarrel. It was foolish and impulsive and I do hope I have not overstepped my mark.”
Tony takes a gulp of air against the sadness in the room, lets it percolate around his lungs. He lets the warning wash over him for what it is, an ally. Maria has good as told him she won’t tell Howard, and the worst of his fear is released to the wind. He also knows what this means for her, how Howard will only see failure if he learns she has kept it from him. “Thank you.”
Antonia nods with an innocent look that she knows isn’t fooling anyone.
Mr Barton had danced once at Highbury, and longer to dance again; nd in the last half-hour of an evening which Mrs Stark was persuaded to spend with her daughters at the Marvels, was passed by the two young people in schemes on the subject. Clint’s was the first idea; and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties, and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance. But Antonia could admit she too wanted people to see how delightfully Mr. Clint Barton and Miss Stark could dance – for doing that she need not compare herself to Miss Romanov and find herself wanting.
“Steve, this team cares about you too much to fall apart on us now. Not when we’re just getting good.” He smiles slightly, awkwardly even, and knowing him as Steve does, showing emotion other than sarcasm and wit is probably difficult for him, which makes Steve appreciate the words even more. He throws an arm out and gives Tony a one shouldered hug.
Some time later, Mr. Barton made his excuses to circle the room, and Antonia acquiesced, well aware of how much of his time she had already marked as her own. His chair was not empty long before it was taken by Mrs. Marvel.
all because of his stupid actions, and follows Bruce blindly downstairs.
. Like meeting Anthony Stark was some precious gift. Tony hears the far off noise of the front door slamming, of the dogs barking to signal the masters return. If he listens hard enough, he can hear the trademark Howard Stark thunder as he storms down hallways and tornadoes into empty rooms like a hurricane. He’ll be looking for Tony, soon, if only to have someone to sit in his shadow as he sips scotch and fingers blueprints, to whisper ideas in his ears for him to steal and stamp as his own.
"Uh, he ran, because he's an idiot." Steve muttered the last part under his breath, and because his treacherous mouth loved running on, "He was only taking a photo because he thought you were handsome."
The words twist in Steve’s stomach, and despite how he might want to desperately read into them he knows better than that. So he smirks, a little thing, heady on the knowledge that Tony’s near out of his mind and he did that. He did, no other memory, no other person, will come into their bed tonight. It’s just them and it’s glorious.
“I’m so excited for you, my darling.” Is all she says, all she has to say in that soft and melodic tone of hers. She strokes her fingers across his left tricep in a familiar rhythm, one he’s familiar with from days gone past, when she’d read softly to him against the dying light and run her hands up his arms until he fell asleep against her chest. He fights the Pavlovian response of shutting his eyes and smiles when he hears the familiar sound of Bucky’s knuckles against the front door.
he must sound.
“A man can always, if he chooses, do his duty; not by maneuvering or finessing, but by vigour and resolution. It is Clint Barton’s duty to pay this attention to his father. He knows as much by his promises and his messages; but if he wished to do it it might be done. A man who felt rightly would sat at once, simply but firmly, to Mrs. Barton – ‘every sacrifice you will always find me ready to make to your convenience; but I must go and see my father immediately as a mark of respect to not fail him on this occasion’ – if he were to say to her with kindness but certainty, there would be no entreaty.”
Mrs. Marvel look surprised, “I did not know he had such a plan.”
“No, but it did not absolutely rain when I set out.”
Steven spoke very little of his own family, the destruction that littered his birth and upbringing. The scythe followed his lineage, followed his friends, closely and furiously. What little he let slip out in a puzzle only slowly unweaving itself even now to Antonia, was nothing but full of love and praise. How very callous of her to suggest.
“If I find him conversable, I shall be glad of his acquaintance, but if he is only a chattering idiot, he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts.”
"Hi Mr. Carbonell, my name is Alexander and I am the manager. Liam here has informed me you want to understand our policies in a little more detail." The tone is dry and snooty and Tony is up to here with
And well shit isn’t this a turn for the books. Why did his fake boyfriend have to be so unbelievably
“Steve - I - Steve - please.” Tony gets out between moans.
Steve is home, Steve is safe. The rest is white noise.
Ghibli movies) and they are about to begin Howl’s Moving Castle that Tony stumbles in.
He turns back to the room, looks at Maria, so broken and brittle, “Steven Rogers is my soulmate. We are bonded. And you can’t do anything about it.”
They see each other on the weekends, Rhodey and Pepper adore Steve, Tony has a mountain of respect from Steve’s friends for managing to hold Thor’s homemade liquor. For a while it is perfect, this fucking golden time that Tony loves and hates in equal measure, because he knows that it is going to hurt like a motherfucker when he has to say goodbye.
He sits, completely naked, in front of the bathroom mirror. He’d pulled a chair up an hour ago, because even though he knows the change has never been documented to occur before midnight on your sixteenth birthday, he still doesn’t want to miss it, just in case. He held a motorbike manual in one hand, having skimmed the pages without anything sinking in, before giving it up as pointless and condemning himself to staring at his skin. The seconds drip past like treacle, the minutes sliding into one another as slow as he’s ever felt. It leaves him with his thoughts for too long. If nothing happens, it means he’s alone. If nothing happens, it means he’s unlovable. If nothing happens, it means he is his father’s son. And that thought terrifies him.
“I’ve heard so much about you it is almost as if we had already met.”
“Now aunt,” Natasha said to Miss Hill, “shall we join Mrs. Hammer?”
“Clint came by this morning.” He said, by way of nothing, “Just to ask us how we did.”
Whilst she was gone, Antonia busied herself by irritating Jarvis with constant quick-witted questions, and sitting with her mother for as long as she could (which, naturally, amounted to less than a half hour. Antonia was never one for sitting still).
“Between Mr Barton and Miss Romanov? Oh yes, perfectly – why do you make a doubt of it?”
“You haven’t moved out of here in three days.” The words are spoken quietly, calmly, as if worried Steve will spook.
Virginia was bright, to be sure, and in that she was aware that her circumstances of birth would not allow her to climb a much higher ladder than that of Mr. Hammer’s occupation. She was a true beauty, one that shone from within. And as such, Antonia was also thoroughly convinced in Mr. Hammer being close, if not all the way, in love with her. He talked of Virginia often, if perhaps mainly when prompted (perhaps he was simply shy), and praised her so warmly, that she couldn’t think anything but time would add more to his regard.
“I went only to the post office,” she spoke, “and reached home before the rain was too much. It is my daily errand. I always felt letters when I am here. A walk before breakfast does me good.”
Ms Rogers is quick, hasty in her reply, “No I couldn’t possibly trouble you.”
He tries again, “Sorry. Sorry. I mean
And in that lapse of concentration a Jorgenheim batters into him from behind and forces the breath from his lungs. Spluttering, he looks for his shield and can’t find it – probably buried between another animal’s ribs, and for the first time as he watches the eagle-like thing rear up onto its hind legs he offers up a plea hoping the man upstairs isn’t calling his time.
He chomps in happy silence, taking shelter in the knowledge that kids his age usually don’t understand unspoken words, nervous tension. He can play for oblivious, and she doesn’t know enough about him to see through it. She sighs, a long and weary thing, reaching to push her greying hair back past her ear, when he sees it. A bouquet of flowers sprawl across her left wrist, and he has to smother a gasp.
“I assume so considering how Thor kept roaring about how he throttled one of their ‘kin’ as a toddler. Surprisingly didn’t do well to calm them down.”
. It still felt bizarre to say it. He thumbed the wedding band encircling his finger, spinning it round the digit in a patten already familiar to him. It didn't take long for Steve to notice him doing it, for him to reach forward and clasp his hand. "Some post honeymoon gift from Von Doom." Tony scoffed quietly to him, "remind me not to send him a thank you card."
refuse –“ Antonia stopped, rudderless, “Oh! So, you weren’t just asking for help regarding the phrasing. You actually want to accept a proposal from
Antonia shook off these words now, convinced of the match. Mr. Hammer, whilst quite the gentlemen himself with no low connections to be worried of, was at the same time not of any family that could object to the doubtful birth of Pepper. He had a comfortable home for her, and Antonia imagined a wonderfully significant income that would keep Pepper well in the years to come. He seemed good humoured, well-meaning and respectable as a young man could be.
She might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments, her influence enough to smother the flame. And now she was embarrassingly aware she ought of prevented them. She had risked her friend’s happiness on most insufficient grounds. Common sense would have directed her to tell Pepper she must not allow herself to think of him, and that it was unlikely for him to think of her. But common sense and Antonia did not go hand in hand.
Tony had never thought he would hate the fact he was born with unmarred, unscarred skin. He used to wear it like a badge of honour.
He’s pulling Steve’s shirt
“I shouldn’t have let you convince me to stay here tonight,” Steve says, pain lancing through him, “I could have hurt you.”
“I will obey you.” Steven says in a tone coloured with mortification, and not another syllable followed. The silence was oppressive, and the pain tore Antonia in two. Steven starts to walk away from her, the distance between them yawning and groaning like a chasm, Antonia powerless to do anything but run to him, run after him like he was as inescapable as gravity.
“Yes,” said Bruce Banner, short, “and I think we shall have a good deal of it.”
The pair look so cowed, and Tony can only feel the heat of Steve radiating at his back like a furnace, and sigh. “It’s fine. Well, it’s not fine, it’s a disgrace. Sex workers are people too, and your assumptions make a mockery of this hotel. I would like a copy of the minutes and follow up of revision to company policy, however. And if I find another couple has experienced this behaviour there will be hell to pay.” He fixes them with a trademark Iron Man stern look, and the pair nod like puppets on strings.
Tony’s heart calls for murder now, calls for blood and betrayal. He watches Howard smile, wide and lecherous, and suppresses the urge to leap across the table and carve it out of his skin.
“I wish you would learn to arrive at a dinner party in the correct manner.” Antonia hissed as she stepped out the carriage.
So when Maria questions further she simply shakes her head, and prays that Steven will come to terms with her lack of forgiveness. Her stomach roils with the thought of never speaking to him again.
when the man comes downstairs looking like every military fantasy Tony has ever had rolled into one. He can’t possibly be real. He can’t possibly be the man that Tony gets to come home to every night.
And that takes the wind out of Steve’s sails as quick as it began, “I’m sorry to hear that Mr Stark.” His voice goes soft.
Tony rouses later in Steve’s arms, coming to with the knowledge that he is
“Sam’s a hopeless case, it’s like trying to convince a sloth to sprint. Pointless for everyone involved.” Nat reasons.
“There is my news – I thought you two should know.” Said Steven, softly and full of kindness. His gaze flitted between Antonia and Pepper, and Antonia turned to her friend upon hearing a muffled gasp, wrecked by what she found. Pepper’s eyes were cloudy, unshed tears trembling at the corners.
, she has a moment to think bizarrely before he pulls her out onto the dance floor, and bundles her into his arms.
“I was mistaken by Mr. Hammer.” She speaks now, “There is a littleness about him which you saw, and I did not.” She pauses for a minute, “He always was a small man, made smaller by his wife.” He snorts at this statement, and she can’t help but answer his wide grin with her own.
“What are you doing then, S?” She asks, direct hit to the gut.
“LET’S FINISH THIS.” He roars, and bounds off with the rush of adrenaline headier than any drug coursing through his veins leaving the man in metal still standing stock still.
The man's eyes flick to Steve. To beautiful, delightful Steve whose hands that have been stroking a pattern into Tony's sweatshirt stop still at the insinuation. Tony watches his husbands eyes fill with heartbreak, and steels himself.
perfectly reasoned and moral rationale.
“Oh thank you,
“What it will cost me?” Tony asks, “I’m not the one divorcing him.”
Mr Jarvis couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows at Antonia with a particular meaning, stoke any flames of jealousy that might slowly be rising within his charge. Antonia shook her head once in skepticism.
“Oh, do go today. Do not defer it. And besides, I must give you a hint, Clint. You remember her from the Coulsons, when she was equal of everybody she mixed with, but here she is in reduced circumstances. It is indeed important you call early, to show respect..”
, it is just the rationale of ‘my life is less important than that of a million dollar man who is the only face of clean technology and has Pepper and Rhodey and Happy and people who care for him’.
she has been dealt with. Imagine living day to day with the sobering thought that if the daughters of the Colonel had suitors, and Natasha found herself in the way of those – and with her being as attractive to the male eye as she is rumoured to be this is sure to occur – that the Colonel would send her from the house without a second thought? Not out of spite, but out of success for his daughters. Antonia, you have never been collateral and so I understand that you cannot see this but be fair to the girl. You cannot live a fully happy life with that hanging over your head!”
Nevertheless, she swallows her anger and turns hastily to him, “Oh yes, we are all so very concerned. Maybe you wish to leave soon so that you can find out the latest news of her condition?”
The next hours are spent in a frenzy of math and exploration that makes him dizzy in the best possible way. Bruce is over his shoulder for some of it, spurring him on. Reed interjects every so often, but his involvement normally causes Tony to throw a spanner in his general direction. The hours bleed into one another, the morning dripping into the afternoon with the slow and steady tick of time.
Antonia’s eyes sought out Steven’s, “How did you come about this information?”
“Steve.” He whispers, like a prayer, and the officer melts away. He’s vaguely aware of Sarah on the other side of the bed, talking and fussing on a gasp that could be a sob. He sinks to his knees beside his bond, and takes a hold of the undamaged arm with a shaky hand. He feels the bond between them crackle like static electricity, before curling up like a sated cat. Steve returns to him like the waves of an ocean, and tears slip unbidden from Tony’s eyes when he can finally feel him again. Finally feel whole.
Antonia was grateful for her life, of course. She knew of the evils of this world, of the poverty she could have been born into had fate been so unkind. And as such, she knew it was indulgent to be churlish toward her circumstance. But she sometimes wished for a mother not quite so tight-fisted in her affections that meant a complete inability to leave anywhere more than ten miles from Hartfield. She watched Bruce, able to come and go as he pleased, and Steve talk of a time in the infantry, of friends from the ton, and wish she could follow them and have stories of her own.
“How fantastic it is that you are here my friend,” Thor’s voice, for once, is fairly quiet but full of sincerity, “I was worried I would have to carry the burden of eating this entire feast on my own shoulders – not a hard task of course – why once when we caught our first Tribekerak we feasted on its flesh the same evening and had a feast that lasted over a week.” He smiles, and Clint punches his arm good-naturedly.
I can’t! You will never be successful, will never amount to anything if you let this
However this particular evening she had requested of Miss. May that Pepper be allowed to attend, and as such she was incredibly excited to have what was shaping up to be an exciting evening ahead. Steve to her left, Pepper to her right, and every inch of her scheming laid out in front of her.
you.”
The end result was overwhelmingly pleasing, or at least definitely gained the right attention from Mr. Hammer when he arrived.
“She is so very adept at French, did you know? She speaks it as well as any native. French is such a romantic language, I have no doubt she will find a partner. Only someone as accomplished as herself of course. But in the Colonel’s circle there are bound to be many up to the challenge.”
Steve’s at his side before he can blink, “No problem, Tony. I’m here. I’ll stay. I promise.” He folds one of Tony’s hands in his, interlocking their fingers and letting the heat of him bleed through their shared contact, “I’ll be right here, you just go to sleep.”
before death yawns wide and tries to devour him.
“Ha!” Steven laughed once, voice sounding pained, then allowed the room to silence. Antonia made no answer here, trying her best to keep her face still, despite the discomfort that crawled across her back. She did not repent for what she’d done, she thought herself a far better judge than Steven on these matters; but yet her habitual respect for his judgement had her vehemently disliking having it so loud against her. To have him just opposite her in an angry state, with her knowing she was the sole cause, sat at a dichotomy in her bones. Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence, clear that he was thinking. When he at least speaks with evidence of these thoughts, it is far quieter than before.
It’s in this state of dreamy disarray and euphoria that he trips into the serving quarters, thinks nothing of the light still on in the walk in. Jarvis often leaves it on, a beacon for Tony to guide himself back again. He hums to himself, pulls a bag of crisps down from the cabinet, and succeeds in stifling a scream when he notices he’s not alone.
They draw closer now, Steve’s eyes impossibly blue, “I would do right by you, and live in bliss.” He says, and Antonia feels like she will float in this cloud of joy forever, “So answer me, please, and send me from this misery I feel, and do me the honor of becoming my wife.” She’s speechless a moment longer, “Antonia please, tell me what do you think?”
He’s pretty sure he wrote about this as a senior. If he was to reach out he could probably touch it - wait hold on -
He has a moment to realise he’s probably not giving the most reassuring impression of himself, grinning madly on her doorstep, hair like a birds nest, eyes sunken with lack of sleep. But
Antonia’s thoughts were whirring, upon hearing this, all unpleasant ones uppermost. She was too completely overpowered by her naivety to immediately reply: ad two moments of silence being ample encouragement for Mr. Hammer’s state of mind, tried to take her hand again.
Or at least until he had found out that the Captain had a seriously filthy mouth that could probably make a sailor blush. During their first battle, one that wasn’t very demanding due to the fact the things they were facing were simply giant puppies whose biggest safety hazard was the strands of drool pooling from their mouths, Steve used the private comm to explain to Tony
It was all he could do to keep his mouth shut.
“You look like shit, Steve.” Bucky says.
“Well Miss Stark,” said Pepper, when they had quitted the house, and after waiting in vain for Antonia to finish stewing, “Well, Miss Stark, what do you think of her? Is she not very charming?”
“He did not make you who you are.” Steve says, with finality. When Steve speaks, so it shall be done, “you did. You had every reason, every reason, to be full of hate yet here you are. You are a marvel.” Steve speaks like stardust, magical and full of rapture. “I don’t blame you seeking his approval. But please tell me, so that you won’t ever be alone. To feel - to feel you in pain and not know the source - I - I can’t do that Tony.”
“No.” Tony is quick to reply, coughs and recalibrates before continuing, “sorry, no. No it’s not an issue. I - I can’t believe you’re real.” The last words are barely above a whisper, and
“I was going to observe, my lady,” said Clint Barton, “that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of anybody catching a cold! We shall have no occasion to open the windows at all – not once the whole evening; and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold air upon heated bodies, which does the mischief.”
“Now on that I can acquit him. It was a private resolution of hers, not communicated to him. She grew tired of waiting, and once her plans burst on him he came forward at once. Threw himself at the mercy of kindness, put an end to this miserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long. To the months of misery.”
The evening of the very same day brought a letter from Mr. Hammer to Mrs. Stark. A long and sprawling note that was perfectly civil to say, with Mr. Hammer’s best compliments, that he was “proposing to leave Highbury the very following morning on his way to Bath”. His compliments and favour of Mrs. Stark did not go unnoticed throughout the letter, and Antonia was too thankful of his disappearance to care that her own name had been omitted throughout the letter. Indeed, there was not a whisper of recognition or askance after her throughout the note. Such a striking turnabout did not escape the sharpness of Maria Stark, who sent a pointed gaze in her daughter’s direction.
In comparison the Hammers were a little more than an inkblot across a canvas. Irrelevant, and one that could easily be brushed over if given the right motivation. The Starks had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighborhood which Mr. Hammer had first entered not two years ago; where he had attempted to make his way as he could without any alliances or anything to recommend him other than his situation and civility. And to look above so highly to think her in love with him! She would admit that her own behavior had been so complacent and obliging, full of courtesy and attention. If
“Well at least make yourself presentable, Miss Hill is arriving shortly.” Steven reprimands slightly, and Antonia groans.
). Disappointed in a very social climb of hope; and not only losing the lady, but finding himself debased to the level of a wrong one. It was only Antonia’s deep seated need to not embarrass her mother and Steven both that his sins had not been made public. It made for him returning engaged to another so utterly bizarre and rankling – not least that he returned self-satisfied caring nothing for Miss Stark, and defying Miss Potts.
with promise and potential that he could practically burst. He’s watching Widow jump on one of the animals from behind, Tony use his repulsors to turn one to ash, Banner take down two in one swoop of his wrist and Thor demolish four with a throw of Mjolnir and he feels so proud of this little dysfunctional family he almost takes his eye off the animals trying to kill them all.
“Oh I’ve had mine.”
“I only wish I had been able to come
“Careful Cap, I think I’m rubbing off on you.”
It wasn’t long before Miss Hill opened the window to cry out once more, “Captain Rogers!” she called, “oh please come up to see Miss Romanov’s surprise gift! We have a delightful group up here with Miss Stark, Mr Jarvis and Mr Barton! Please grace us in our little room to make it one more.”
“Good.” Is all his father says, clapping his hand across Tony’s shoulders who hides a flinch under the weight, “No distractions.”
“I’d normally retort, but I’m scared you’ll cut off my head and eat me like you do with your other spoils of war.”
he feels Steven’s tender smile across his shoulders like a balm. He thinks now, that this is as happy as he has ever been. That is, until Steven takes Tony’s hand in his, holds it close.
“What just happened?” Tony sounds a little dazed over the comm.
However now Captain. Rogers, who had certainly taken on an early dislike to Clint Barton, was only growing to dislike him more. He began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of Antonia. That Antonia appeared his object appeared indisputable. She was the most elegant, intelligent, and well-made of the women of Highbury. Indeed it was a small mercy that sights of the gentlemen of Highbury had not been placed on her sooner, at least for Steven’s sanity. Everything declared that Antonia was his aim; his own attentions, his father’s hints, his mother’s guarded silence. There was no mistaking it, everything in unison of telling the same story.
Compliments, charades and horrible blunders; and it was not to be supposed that poor Pepper should not be recollecting too. Yet Pepper held herself well, strong and poised, fiery hair elegant and porcelain skin pure. Antonia never valued her friend more highly than in this moment, the picture of serenity when she was sure her mind could be nothing but, and she hastened to make the visit short.
Now, perhaps if his friends had been a little bit more normal, and he hadn’t picked a name so famous it stung, they could have left it there. Happily. Steve could have told them a few date anecdotes he picked up from
Mr. Clint Barton did not come. When the time proposed drew near, Mrs. Marvel’s fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse. For the present, he could not be spared, and his letter spoke at length of his “great mortification and regret”.
He doesn’t notice the set of Steve’s jaw, his eyes turning flat and dark as he strides inside alone. Tony only feels the cold absence without Steve’s arm around him.
Next morning, Jarvis leaves the house on errands for the Starks, thick envelope under his coat containing every word Tony wishes he could say into Steve’s open and trusting gaze.
would do the trick at such a late hour. But now I see I am employing
Such an adventure as this – a fine young man and a lovely young woman thrown together in such a way, could hardly fail of suggesting certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest of brain. So Antonia thought, at least. Could the most indifferent dare to witness their appearance together, hearing the history of it, without feeling that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other? Her imagination as it was, she was on fire with speculation and foresight and anticipation.
could look at a man like Steve. They change, shift, every night, but the common thread is the same. It’s always rejection, always Steve left wanting. So he smothers his feelings, chokes the air out of them until they are nothing but simmering embers. He may not have anything left now but stilted conversations and Natasha breathing down his neck, but he wouldn’t trade it for the world, and would lay waste to those who wanted to take it from him.
the first to get news of this sort!”
“My being charming, is not quite enough to entice me to marry; I must find other people – or rather one person charming. I assure you, I have no intention of marrying at all. Someone very superior would have to come along. And even then I would rather not be tempted.” She squirms as she speaks, ears aflame as though she’s been caught out on a lie. She brushes away the thoughts of golden hair and deft fingers.
Tony’s face is kind, and soft, and when he speaks his voice is a quiet whisper, “Let me describe it for you.”
Tony is still silent, his fingers having lifted by unbidden accord to trace the words spanning Steve’s bicep softly.
“Ask no more questions – my wife will break it better than I can. Most unaccountable business! But it will all come soon.”
“Yes.” Clint agrees, “Yes that’s true.”
“Yes, true indeed.” Spoke the aunt, though Natasha had not uttered a word, “It is time for us to be going with the evening closing in. We must wish you a good night.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“It is not just a name,” Tony nearly barks. He’s too naked and too sober for this conversation, and he hates how whiny he sounds, “He’s your soulmate. He probably volunteers at a puppy shelter at the weekends and bench presses cars by the week days.”
The only other time he has seen Steve this broken is when he sat him down to talk him through the wars that have been. Of Afghanistan, of his
“Wait! Wait! Please stop.” She pulls at his arm once she’s caught up with him, and the look on his face is so

“Yes of course she is! And were she prosperous, were she a woman of fortune, I would allow you some liberties. Were she your equal. But she’s not!
In moments like this Tony reminds him of his motorcycle. All humming, lithe energy, not a part wasted or for show. The man is wearing a tank top, stained with grease and oil and sweat, jaggedly cut around his arc reactor.
seduce you and fuck you into a marriage that won’t last out the month!”
Later, when Howard spends an hour berating him for his failures, he has to stifle the grin that stutters around his face. He thinks Howard knows it too, cutting his rant short to tell him to get out of his sight, utterly discombobulated by this exuberant son of his.
Antonia gasped, and Maria looked on at them both with fond affection, “Oh I am sure of who you must have in your head for that notion – since
He stares out the window at Steve’s waving figure, until it becomes indistinguishable in the distance.

new friends, “You know, as your boss, I could technically fire you all.” He says, darkly.
The worst part is that he seems to believe that the rest of his team are indispensable, with the exclusion of himself.
They walk shoulder to shoulder in the crisp air of a July evening, or at least as close as Steve’s height will grant them to it. He’s never more aware of how frail he is than when he’s walking in Bucky’s shadow, the dark eating up his skinny build and hiding him from the sun.
“This got something to do with why you look like you’ve just gone twenty rounds with a grizzly bear and come worse off?” he asks, soft like he’s trying not to spook him. And well, Steve’s never been able to lie to Bucky with any success.
His defender stands above him, chest heaving with exertion, face so ferocious that if he was a dog Tony thinks he would probably be growling around this point. His would-be attackers stand in a fractured circle around the pair, hovering and unsure whether taking on all of Steve in his six foot glory. Steve throws a last punch at the ring leader and they scatter off as fast as they can.
Jarvis at this moment, could not help but poke slightly, for surely Antonia must be aware of her own obliviousness? Surely these ardent feelings cannot be clear to everyone but herself? “Are you sure? He is so very discreet, as is she. I think they are well suited.” He hid a smile as he heard Antonia splutter beside him, “Unless of course you think someone more his opposite would be best attracted. Someone not afraid to challenge him.”
He continues opening Tony up, scissoring his fingers when he adds another, and on the third finger Tony’s incoherent. He’s sweaty and flushed and gorgeous and Steve hasn’t fallen so hard so fast in a very long time but it doesn’t mean he’s not making it up for it now.
“Drop it Sam.” Steve’s voice is weary but firm. Sam flashes a look of pure murderous intent before slinking away from the bar.
A week had not passed since Miss Hawkins’ name was first mentioned, before she was, by some means of another, discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind.
to understand Tony.” Natasha’s voice is dry and Clint grins at the look of slight horror on Tony’s face.
Tony is nine when he runs away for the first time. He packs himself a rucksack mainly full of Red Vines and Asimov, swings it onto his small shoulders before nearly falling backward with the weight of it. He pulls it firmer onto his back, ignoring the smarting of his arm. If he looks hard, he can see the imprint of Howard’s fingers round his wrist like a brand, sees the indentation of Howard’s club ring.
mistress of Donwell. But she wished to be alone. She would not be stopped.”
Tony is as sweet and smooth and golden as honey, draped across his bed, “tell me.” He goes back to his ministrations, laving kisses over his soulmark until Tony’s near sobbing.
It’s as terrifying as free fall, Steve completely shocked still and Tony almost thinks to run, to curl into himself and beg forgiveness forgetting that some marks are platonic, no matter how all encompassing this may feel. Like tectonic plates shifting against each other, inevitable as an earthquake. But Steve shudders, lowers his hands to curl around Tony’s waist and
"Be cool about it, but take a look over there." Sam cranes his neck, looking to all the world like a stork that has dislocated its neck.
“We think so very differently on this point, Captain. Rogers, that there is no point in canvassing it. We are merely making each other angry. But as to the idea that I would not
Jarvis is waiting at the mouth of the door, smile bright, eyes wise. He helps carry the last of their belongings, the last of what little good memories they have of this place, packed to cardboard. Tony takes vicious pleasure in the knowledge that Howard’s return from his conference in Russia will be met with empty silence and a sheaf of papers pinned to his door that starts with the word “Divorce”.
Antonia flushes, mind rocking back to that scene so overplayed in her heart.
“Oh marvelous taste to be sure.” Miss Hill confirms it, seemingly oblivious to the sound of Pepper’s heart shattering quietly in the corner, “My mother liked the rump most of all. Her name is Augusta Hawkins and she is worth
“So, how did Steve trick you into a relationship? We have bets to fulfill.” Clint makes an awfully obvious subject change in the silence, but everyone’s thankful for it.
Rhodey and Pepper sleep on the couch that night, far enough that Tony doesn’t feel trapped but close enough that he knows they are there. His eyes hurt from where he has tried to blot out the visions of Steve and
“No, Mrs. Rogers.” He countered, feeling the room going slightly quieter for it. He could feel Antonia’s gaze on him, willing away the flush that was determined to fill his cheeks, “And until she is in being, I will manage matters myself.”
“He wants… I don’t…” Steve tries, and with every word Tony sinks further, “I won’t see him again. I promised you.”
Antonia was a good deal surprised; but begged her to speak. There was a seriousness to Pepper’s manner that made her think she may know what was yet to be uttered, but she would not speak it.
does he know how it feels to have your failures displayed in front of your eyes taunting you with the abundance of alternative realities where you reacted faster, smarter, angrier,
“I do not presume to know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Stark,” said Steven, “of this great new intimacy between Antonia and Virginia Potts, but I don’t think it is a good thing.”
Mr. Hammer must now be left to himself. It was no longer within Antonia’s power to superintend or quicken his thoughts or actions. The coming of her second family, of Mr. and Mrs. Banner, was so very near at hand, that first in anticipation, then reality, it became her prime motivation. During their ten stay at Hartfield it could not be expected that anything beyond occasional assistance where fortuitous could be afforded.
The smile Steve graces him with could fuel the Stark Tower for years.
I am.” His voice breaks on the last words, “You deserve better. Do you know there are days I wash my hands until they bleed because I can still see the blood of my friends on them?” it’s too honest, too raw. But it’s all he knows. Here, he says, look under the hood, see enough to scare you off and let me lick my wounds in peace.
Almost as much as he loves how Steve’s face takes a turn for the wonder when he strips his shirt off to show the new piece of art in the middle of his chest.
"Oh. Um. This isn't my phone! Yes, this is you on the phone though. As in, the picture, here, in my hands. But I wasn't the photographer! That is to say, I wasn't, I didn't- But I didn't take it! I swear! It was a friend!" Steve rambled, panicked.

Steven’s grin is achingly fond, the kind that rots Antonia’s chest, “Well, what are you waiting for?” he asks, soft and steady, cheekily too, “Surely you must refuse them at once.”
He hears crunching footsteps behind him, and knows better but to look, “Hi Jarvis” he says around the lump in his throat, blinking through the tears in his eyes, the humiliation he feels coursing through his veins.
“You. Everything. Anything.” Tony replies, voice hoarse and words stripped bare, “This.” He says, swiping desperately at the zip of Steve’s jeans, Steve helpless to do anything but groan and resist the urge to come undone right there and then, “in me.”
That is at least until Sam takes a photo, click and flash loud enough to stumble everyone in the cafe out of their thoughts. The man,
Steve barely the presence of mind, pleasure clouding his vision, to remember vaguely Tony’s comments about command, and he’s surprised that he’s even barely able to talk, so close now to supernova.
“By the way,” Tony speaks on a laugh, watching Steve’s face take a turn for adoration, “I love you too you idiot.”
but desperate and self-destructive tendrils take root in his mind. They shriek at him to run, tell him he’s too fractured to deserve this, and he can’t hear get his head above water. Tony stops, closes his mouth, and his mouth turns into a grimace.
Tony doesn’t reply, too scared that the moment will break and shatter into a million pieces in front of him.
Antonia turned, “How do you know Mr Rhodes did not voice his thoughts yesterday?”
“Remember when Howard said you’d just seduce and fuck me into marriage?” Tony says through laughter, and Steve grumbles at the memory. He doesn’t want the sour taste of a man who is nothing but a disappointment to clog up their afterglow. Tony soothes him with a hand through his hair and the feeling of inescapable love and adoration that soaks through their bond.
“Tony?”
Her mother had always quite enjoyed the lack of thought on the matter of marriage. She knew she was farther from approving matrimony than most parents of eligible rich young women could claim to be, and happy for this circumstance (
Steve doesn’t eat as much as he should. With a metabolism like his, S.H.I.E.L.D. had advised him to be eating over 12,000 calories a day. The reason he doesn’t heed the recommendation is apparently, according to the psychiatrist S.H.I.E.L.D. employs, due to a latent form of PTSD. She loves to tell him over and over again that
Keying in his access code, which despite practice he still couldn’t help but rapidly fire out in case the pad that appeared in front of him dissipated whilst he was still typing out the digits, he stepped in as quiet as he could.
“Holy shit, you look ready to throw up. Aim for Sam.” Clint crows.
“Okay, okay, okay, okay” Tony babbles, “I need that thing in me yesterday.” He twists underneath Steve and reaches up toward the cabinet by the yawning expanse of his bed. When Steve realises what he’s searching for, he stretches beyond the other man and blindly grabs at the drawer handle. It takes Tony reaching up to suck at Steve’s left nipple to spark a delicious spark of desire course through him and distantly he heard the cacophony of wood scraping. He’s pulled the drawer out completely, the contents spilling to the floor. Tony giggles against his chest, the vibration twisting Steve’s gut something fierce.
But it’s not the fact he was just completely floored by an extra-terrestrial beast that has him pausing whilst the battle continues around him, but the fact that in that last moment Steve didn’t want to die and that is such an alien thought to the man who had nothing left to lose because all his friends are dead and gone he’s not sure whether to laugh or cry. He instead grabs Tony’s metal arm and pulls him close and grins right up into his face.
