“I’m not in trouble, Tony,” he confirmed. “Well, not any more trouble than you are, seeing as we’re both going to be trapped here for at least another few hours.”
“Damnit, Steve. I chose you as my attendant to keep you
Grant’s brow furrowed, and he shoved the last notebook into his bag with so much force that the leather creaked ominously.
And, shockingly, Tony meant it. Because after the incident at the restaurant, Steve had started to add silly doodles of the team to the group text. Bruce had dragged Tony up to the kitchen to ask for his help on a research problem while feeding him curry. Thor had begun demonstrating a cluelessness about how to work the television that Tony suspected was a ruse to rope him into watching – and explaining the differential merits of – various series of
Tony blinked in confusion, his mind struggling to process the sight of Ty’s limbs sprawling across the floor, but soon Steve was facing him again, his forehead creased with concern.
“That obvious, huh?” Steve replied.
“It’s my deal,” Steve said finally, and Tony snapped out of his reverie in time to notice that Thor had won the last hand, and Clint was now heading to the pantry to grab potato chips wearing nothing but a pair of purple boxer-briefs.
“You and I both know that’s not true,” Steve said. “Because you betrayed him and your team.”
Dr. Grant's expression flickered like he was trying to figure out if Tony was making fun of him or not. "I'm used to the YMCA."
Judging by the imprint that a set of pliers had left on his cheek and the impressive grease stain stretching across his forehead, Steve guessed that Tony had reached his final stage of exhaustion: an event that the other four Avengers had started privately referring to as a “Code Wipeout.”
Steve had replayed the sound of that voice so many times in the months since Siberia – pressing it to surface of his memory like a needle until it traced a groove deep into his mind. It was probably inevitable that when he finally heard it again, he would do whatever it asked; so he did his best to breathe through each new slash of sensation as Tony held his weight and someone else – Colonel Rhodes, he thought – cut through the manacles around his wrists.
“Well in that case,” he said, grabbing a fistful of Steve’s shirt with one hand, “you want to take me to bed, soldier?” He pulled Steve in for a kiss, and Steve felt his stomach dip, as if he had taken the first leap off a plane.
“Then quit micromanaging and concentrate on knitting that left ankle back together,” Tony said. “Don’t think I didn’t notice you favoring it.” He settled two larger logs into place around the pyramid of kindling, blew once on the first coals to encourage them, and then closed the door and opened the vents.
“What do we do?” Steve asked, holding one hand to the side of Harrison’s head to steady him as he convulsed in pain again.
faculty meeting – introducing a
“We could do that thing we tried last week, with the carabineers and the jump rope – or that position from last night, where you used the back of the couch to...” He illustrated with another hitch of his eyebrows. “That put me right to sleep.”
It had taken a while for him to admit the extent of the damage, because it was the opposite of the problem he’d expected to have when the two of them had gotten thrown into living together senior year. Before that August, Steve and Tony hadn’t really moved in the same circles. Steve had lived in a cheap, off-campus apartment for the first three years of college with two fellow athletes, Bucky and Sam, and Tony had stayed in the dorm rooms with his best friend Rhodey — largely in an effort to choose the living situation that would irritate his father the most. But then Bucky and Sam had gone from the occasional hook-up to what Steve (not
“Or what?” the other man grinned. “You’ll shoot me? Wouldn’t be the first time. Wouldn’t even be the first time
“I get shot all the time, Stark,” Clint said. He kicked his legs up onto the table: a move that Steve suspected was calculated to show Tony how quickly he was healing. “You’re not that special.”
Grant was nodding along gamely, clearly unaware of the net being cinched tight around him, and Tony finally relented. Not even a glass-juggling, meeting-prolonging pie thief deserved to be tricked into LARPing with the Philosophy Department.
Tony glared. Any forgiveness he'd been feeling towards Dr. Grant immediately evaporated. "Doing just fine on my own, actually. I wouldn't want to disrupt what must be a very carefully crafted workout." He indicated Dr. Grant's carefully crafted calves. "Thank you, though."
“Sorry,” Steve said, grimacing even harder.
Steve, on the other hand, had yet to shed a single item.
“Seems like a bit of a pot, kettle, black situation given, you know –” Tony gestured toward Clint’s bandages. “Not to mention the whole ‘starting fires with your mind’ and ‘appearing noiselessly in locked rooms’ thing.”
“Your majesty is fortunate, then, to be so rich in confidence,” Steve replied mildly.
“Virginia Pepper Potts – I have no choice but to listen. You have literally extorted my attention at the hands of my own A.I. My ears are completely at your mercy, you devious tech-jacker.”
Fuck. This book was going to be the death of him.
“Steve’s right, Tony,” Natasha nodded. “It makes sense to avoid playing by his rules when we can. Clint and I should go with you too: we’ve walked into more traps than the rest of you combined. Also Clint could use the exercise. His reflexes are slowing down in the countryside, and it’s really throwing off the field-injury betting pool.”
"She said you were a bit of a dick, but in what seemed like the nicest way possible."
Darcy suddenly tipped her head to the side. "You know you're drinking out of both coffees, right? Isn't the other one for Ms. Potts?"
Steve’s jaw clenched, and for a moment it looked like he was going to refuse. Then he sighed, nodding slightly in resignation. Taking in a slow breath, he held his arms carefully away from his torso and allowed Tony to remove his belt and raise the hem of his tunic.
They were only a few meters away – close enough to see Tony depositing Clint near the front strut and Rumlow examining the stolen case – when Harrison suddenly shouted and dropped to his knees.
He used his grip on Steve’s shoulders to ease himself forward, pausing when his lips were just an inch away from Steve’s, offering Steve a chance to shift away. But Steve was already moving toward him, his hands coming up to cup the sides of Tony’s face and pull him into a kiss. It was gentle and quiet, each press of lips or brush of noses bringing a tingle of warmth back to the places where their skin had been exposed to the cold.
, he thought to himself furiously.
“Not a chance,” Tony hissed, gripping at the fabric of Steve’s shirt as if worried Steve was going to physically shake him loose. “Don’t you dare say it.”
“Excuse me, sir,” JARVIS announced, “but Ms. Potts has initiated the override sequence, and I will have to put her call through the building P.A. system if you do not pick up your phone.”
Content warning: violence, canonical minor character death, scary medical situation, but a HAPPY ENDING
He was just about to let out a sigh of relief, but when he glanced across the room in search of more of their friends, the breath caught in his throat instead: because Steve was glaring in the direction of Ty’s retreat, irritation written on every line of his face.
He stood up and walked over to the open doorway, standing casually in a space where minutes before there had been nothing but brick.
Tony stared at the man, who was still just standing there, but apparently he had nothing else to say. He huffed out a frustrated little noise and turned and walked away.
Finally, Tony dropped his weapon to his side and let his head fall back on the floor.
"She spoke very highly of you."
For the first few seconds after Steve hit the floor, Tony thought it was his own heart that had stopped.
“Everybody’s fine but you, Steve,” Tony assured him. “And the doctors said you should be able to move to the general floor in a few hours. So shut those baby blues and let the serum do its job, because there’s a whole team of keyed-up superheroes waiting to see you, and they’re emptying the hospital vending machines fast enough to cause a run on the Frito-Lay factory.”
He illustrated his point with a jaunty five lines about his “plans” to model the production process for Project Rebirth with his summer research students, tied off the application with a nod to
Her voice was light, but she held Tony’s eyes the whole time. And if Tony had still been entertaining any doubts about whether she’d figured out what happened between him and Steve, they were gone now.
“Project TAHITI is no longer in operation,” Fury said firmly. “There’s no chance of it being revived unless it falls into enemy hands. I don’t know how the Mandarin found out about it, and I don’t have to tell you how cranky that makes me. So until I know where my leak is, Project TAHITI gets more dangerous the more people who know about it. You can accept the need-to-know, or you can leave an agent with sensitive intel in the hands of terrorists. Those are the only terms I can offer, Captain.”
Tony’s smile widened cautiously, and Steve would have felt like someone had knifed him, except that he knew he was the one holding the blade.
“Then let’s bust this guy out, Cap,” Tony declared. “And afterward, we can find out what Fury’s keeping from us this time.”
He reached into the pocket of his jacket in search of his keys but found only the boxed edges of an old baseball ticket. A quick pat-down of his other pockets yielded no better results, and Steve cursed slightly under his breath as he peered through the windows of Tony’s car and then his own to see if the keys had fallen out onto his seat. No luck.
“Okay, well, that’s me tapping out then,” Clint announced. “Trust the two of you to finally figure this out in the middle of a HYDRA facility. I owe fifty bucks to the betting pool, by the way, and I’m probably going to steal it from the team take-out fund.”
His research, however, was finally showing signs of clearing up.
“Ah ah!” Tony protested, “not so fast, Colonel I-Could-Outrun-A-Racoon. You’re going to tell me why it took me three years of research and forty-eight years of life to find out my father helped found some covert, document-redacting, archive-evading organization called SHIELD.”
is in them,” Arnie corrected. “Met him right behind this building, as a matter of fact – had to help him out of a dumpster after he confronted some schmuck trying to feel up his date.” He walked through the door to the reading room and held it open for Tony.
“No, Steve,” Tony said patiently, “I just wriggled my hips in front of
Tony was about to tease Steve about coming crawling to the espresso machine at last when his smile suddenly turned to a frown. He couldn’t think of any reason why Steve would need caffeine this morning, he realized; nor did he feel entirely sure what morning it was — or how he’d gotten back to his room.
to Coulson?”
“I know JARVIS,” Tony interjected. Then, after a pause: “JARVIS?”
Any trace of stoicism was burned off in a surge of adrenaline, and suddenly Steve needed to get out immediately.
She broke off and pressed a button on the remote. On the television screen, the footage of the Mandarin’s dressing room was replaced by a CNN news feed. Video was looping of an incident downtown D.C.: a black SUV surrounded by men in uniform; a barrage of gunfire; police cars giving chase; and finally an explosion that flipped the battered SUV onto its roof. With a horrible lurch, Steve recognized the man barely visible through the broken window of the car as Nick Fury.
“JARVIS,” Tony prompted, and the flatscreen flickered to life, revealing footage of a smoldering office building in what looked like Washington D.C. Most of the action seemed to be over, but the lights of ambulances flahsed through the plaza. Tony scanned the foreground of the shot, and sure enough –
The instant when Sitwell shot the explosive into Steve’s skull had felt like having the arc reactor ripped out of its socket. When Steve had dropped to his knee, the bottom of Tony’s stomach had fallen out. And in the end, all of those moments had just been a warm-up for this one: the horrible, never-ending seconds when all Tony’s muscles screamed and locked in protest because Steve was lying on the floor, eyes open, not breathing.
He could hear Ward and Rumlow cursing, and he knew he couldn’t give them time to realize they could still use Tony for leverage. Reaching for a tray of implements on the table beside him, he whipped it at Ward’s face and followed it with a flying tackle, colliding hard enough to knock the gun out of his hand. Ward struck back, forcing Steve to fend off quick jabs to the throat and ribs.
“And Clint broke the claw machine trying to win that Hawkeye plushie,” Steve confirmed.
“Ah, I see,” Tony smiled humorlessly, “you’re trying to tell me that Steve’s going to shoot me. Well you picked a tough sell there, Anya Amasova, because Steve is even less capable of that than he is of picking out clothes that fit him.”
?” Steve demanded.
The better part of valor might have reminded him that his ancient Honda Civic wasn’t exactly a road warrior in inclement weather, and so perhaps a drive to Medford should not have been attempted under current conditions. But the worser part of desperation had kept him up until the wee hours of the morning watching Dummy hit his cardio peak zone on the wheel and speculating about when and where his father might have crossed paths with the names in his research notes. And in any case, the worst of the storm wasn’t expected until later that afternoon.
“The two attacks must have been almost simultaneous,” she said grimly. “But no word from Hill, or from anyone at H.Q., for over an hour. Whoever ordered the hits is doing something to slow down our response.”
he wanted to say – or its companion,
A little bit of petty delight flushed though Tony, and he ate the rest of his pasta in celebration. "Looks like Professor Perfect isn't so faultless after all," Tony mused. "Wonder if the new Dean has noticed one of his recent hires is a Truant Tricia."
“Guess I should have asked what week it was too,” Tony muttered. The cords of muscle in his arms flexed as he ran his hands through his hair. “Are we headed to a floor that has coffee – or maybe a giant syringe of adrenaline? If the Spy Kids are back, I could probably get Romanov to stab me in the neck again. Actually, if she just looked at me the right way, I’d probably have a Pavlovian fight-or-flight response that might be good for a few hours of terrified wakefulness." He cleared his throat. "Uhhh...Ground Control to Major Tom: do you read me?”
Tony’s mind was whirring through the gear changes of about eighteen – wait, twenty-three – possible explanations for what he was seeing, and he could feel the puzzle pulling his attention mercifully away from the rattle of anxiety he’d started to feel when the door slammed behind him. He holstered his gun and slid into the chair opposite Clint (or, in eleven out of the now-twenty-eight hypothetical scenarios, Ghost Clint) and watched him over the top of his folded hands.
“I hate that man,” Pepper growled, giving Tony’s arm a fierce squeeze.
of the army. You’re not trained for combat – you didn’t even have the proper equipment. What were you thinking?”
Steve hauled himself upward, ignoring a new string of profanities from Tony, who moved quickly to brace Steve's shoulder and hold him upright. Steve ran his eyes quickly around the room. Luckily, HYDRA’s hideout was not up to code, because the overhead lighting was connected to a circuit breaker through cables of exposed wiring. Steve gestured toward the wall.
“I didn’t believe her,” Tony whispered. “I didn’t believe you would do it.”
"Bingo," Tony informed Dummy, his long-suffering hamster, who poked his nose out of a messy pile of fluff, blinked blearily, then retreated when no sunflower seeds were forthcoming.
Tony was almost lost in the haze of kissing Steve Rogers – the half-desperation, half-relief inspired by the sharp pant of Steve’s breath against his lips – when he felt Steve wince. Tony pulled back immediately, and Steve chased after Tony’s retreating mouth with a noise of frustration.
“– anyway, it didn’t take, and then that first night after the gym...what you were offering me was so much more than I ever thought I’d have in this century, and I was so…God, I was so fucking lonely. So I just grabbed it.”
And he must have been right, because the searching hands had reached the place on Steve’s abdomen where his uniform had been torn open by a crow bar, and Tony’s face had frozen in horror.

“Tony! How fast?”
button when he set up his faculty account, unlike about 90% of the rest of the staff.
“You’ve got a smart mouth, Rogers, and I mean that on any number of levels. Now what floor can I get for you, Captain Sass-a-lot?”
A little knot of people entered from the direction of the science building, and Tony shifted his feet back to the floor to allow Bruce Banner to drop into the seat next to him. Bruce was clutching a load of books under one arm and holding onto a Styrofoam plate of precariously piled snacks with the other. When his attempts to shift the books to the table dislodged a cheese cube from the stack, Tony plucked it out of the air and popped it into his mouth.
“We’ve had agents casing all five possible locations,” the Director continued, “and we’ve determined that these two are the most likely for hostage holding.”
“Tony?” Clint came flying into the room, his eyes widening as he took in the sight of Steve’s body –
kidding me,” he groaned, tumbling down the last set of stairs and into the entryway, where he could finally see Tony crawling toward the door. Tony heaved himself onto his back when he heard Steve’s voice, pulling out his gun and aiming it shakily at Steve’s head. Steve drew his own with a painful effort, and for a moment they lay there in a standoff, staring each other down while Bing Crosby crooned in the background.
Steve walked over briskly, digging a pair of gloves out of his pocket. As soon as he had them on, he held out a hand to ask Tony for the paper. Tony chewed on his lip for a moment and then handed it over, leaning back against the counter as Steve read it through.
Pepper Potts had only spoken to Steve once before today’s meeting. But everything about her appearance – from her impeccably coordinated accessories to the promise of efficiency she had telegraphed with just three taps of her nails against the conference table – tended to confirm his sense of someone who would tighten any ship she was running. Even Steve, who had taken orders from four-star generals, had found his spine straightening when she shook his hand. And considering the finely honed stare she was currently leveling in her boss’s direction, Steve supposed that Tony Stark’s display of nonchalance might have been almost impressive – if it weren’t also so annoying.
“You know,” Tony reflected, “if I were a less secure man, I might wonder if your sudden interest in wall hangings was an attempt to avoid my notice.”
He rubbed the hand not holding Tony’s across his eyes, and for the first time Tony noticed the faint tracks running down Steve’s cheek.
The first thing Steve realized as he lurched back toward consciousness was that Tony was no longer next to him. The second was that he was no longer in the library, and wherever he was, it was dark and cold.
, but then he finally caught sight of the Ace bandages wrapped around Steve’s right wrist — a make-shift splint holding his hand at a stiff angle.
“Don’t fuck around, Rogers. Four,” Ward warned, and Rumlow’s hand twitched threateningly back toward the back of Tony’s head.
Steve distributed his armload of snacks before returning to his spot on the couch, readjusting his arms as Tony sat up to claim a spoon and a carton of rocky road. The anxious claws that had been sinking their way into Steve’s chest while he was out of the room retracted slightly as Tony leaned back against him, and for a few minutes he let himself bury his face in Tony’s hair and breathe. With each inhale, the scent of coconut and jasmine from Tony’s shampoo became stronger. With each exhale, the memory of the Iron Man armor bent over a tangle of explosives – faceplate lifting as Tony shouted at him to run – faded just a little further into the background.
Tony arrived at the Triskelion just after Clint and Natasha, who were debriefing with Steve outside the conference room. Natasha was still dressed in an evening gown, and Clint was sporting an impressive black eye, so they must have been pulled off their previous mission abruptly. Steve had changed from road-trip casual into a generic SHIELD tac suit that had absolutely no hope of making him look inconspicuous. Tony was just making a mental note to send Fury thank-you flowers for the particularly clingy cut of those pants when Steve looked over at him with a smile that was warm and shy, and – shit. He had to admit that Rhodey may have had the tiniest, most infinitesimal point, because Tony’s heart rate really should not be more responsive to a little smile than it was to super-soldier physique.
of the old floorboards echoing the clock strikes, so that both sounds seemed to resound through the house. Steve’s jaw clenched – in annoyance and something else he preferred not to name.
“I need to call some colleagues,” he said. “Do I have your permission to send this to Dr. Banner in our lab?”
He’d expected to find an Individual Deceased Personnel File at the bottom of the box – or perhaps a telegram of condolence addressed to a parent or sibling – but the last sheet in the stack was an unfinished letter that appeared to have been written by Rogers himself.
“No kidding,” Tony shook his head. “And here I thought Brucie was just on a sugar high from all the funnel cakes Thor kept buying.”
Steve cleared his throat, feeling his cheeks flush slightly as a chunk of armor the size of a pea pattered onto the couch next to them with a barely audible fizzle.
No one had ever accused Tony Stark of being too patient. So when the team had to wait a full twenty-four hours for news about whether their latest mission had been a success, it was no surprise to anyone who knew him that Tony’s response was not what they might call “chill.”
Tony paused for a sip of coffee, allowing himself to glance toward Pepper and Bruce so that he could steady himself with the sight of their thumbs up and encouraging nod, respectively. Pepper, bless her, had her phone set to record, and Tony had no doubt she'd be emailing the file to Rhodey.
“Sorry, Cap, reunion’s over,” he said, blasting forward to scoop Steve over one shoulder and fly them both upward, away from the circle of armored vehicles squealing into place around them. Steve let out one noise of frustration and then went silent, and Tony was almost glad that the armor made it impossible to feel the tension he knew was probably radiating off of him as they flew out of D.C.
into a pre-printed chart. Then added
“I have no idea why Pepper threatened to staple the definition of ‘low-profile’ to the inside of your jacket,” Steve greeted Tony, wandering away from the counter. “You’re so naturally subtle.”
Ever since Nick Fury had run him down in Times Square, Steve had felt locked up inside – like part of him had decided to go back into the ice when he realized there was almost no one left alive who knew what he looked like happy anyway. After days of crash courses in the Cold War, SHIELD filing systems, and something called a “phishing scheme,” Steve had fallen into a rhythm (run, study, punch, run, collapse) so numbingly repetitive that he could summon a smile or a smooth line without thinking about it. That had been the goal, as he was forcibly reminded every time he woke up screaming Bucky’s name or gasping for air as ice water filled his lungs: don’t think about it.
Tony took a few deep breaths, trying to take in the newest low in Ty’s long list of predatory behaviors while also scrambling for something he could say that might distract Steve from how horribly bad Tony’s judgment had been in letting such a vicious asshole into his life.
“Hey,” Tony said softly, squeezing Steve’s hand in his, “you didn’t lose me. You can’t. That’s what I should have told you that night at Barton’s instead of walking away, but I was too jealous and scared to admit it. I’m so totally gone for you, Rogers. I have been for a long time. I can’t promise I’m not going to make terrible decisions because of it. But I won’t leave you. Not ever again.”
Tony gave up on pretending to do chest presses. "You talked about me?"
That line of reasoning was still holding up, barely, by the time that Tony arrived at the storage facility, where his car only took a second longer than usual to come to a stop in the first two inches of snow. He took a few moments to prepare himself for the cold - and for the possible disappointment of a wasted trip - and then he bundled up to face the results of his risky cross-town drive.
sorry if it makes things awkward for you.”
“You barely knew me then,” Steve said, his brow furrowing.
Tony dug his laptop out of his bag and started it up. Dummy ran up and down his sleeves while Tony navigated to the faculty calendar. He scrolled through, but apparently Dr. Grant knew enough about digital security to have unclicked the
“I’ll never get tired of you,” Steve said. “And as someone recently reminded me, I’m a pigheaded son of a bitch. So you know I’ll fight every day to prove I’m right.”
Tony tried to use the pause to process as rapidly as possible the revelation that Steve had had a relationship with a man. It wasn’t a surprise, of course, that Steve was attracted to men. Steve hadn’t talked to Tony about his taste in partners, but Tony had spent decades perfecting his sixth sense for when someone was checking him out. He knew the effect of his impeccably tailored pants was not lost on Steve. But he hadn’t known Steve had actually been in love with a man – with Bucky freaking Barnes, of all people.
“Yes,” Steve said firmly.
Well, morose and hot, Tony allowed. But the “hot” part kind of went without saying at this point: it was the unspoken subtext of every sentence his brain generated about Steve Rogers. “This is my (hot) roommate, Steve.” “Where’s Steve? Oh, he’s at football practice (being hot).” Or, if it was a day ending in “y,” “stop looking so judgy (and hot), Rogers. I already told you: I ate dinner yesterday.”
Tony's mouth fell open. "You
“You’re terrified of losing him,” she mused. “And you know it’s only a matter of time before that fear makes you do something disastrously stupid. The lovers’ pact frees you from all that.”
On what Clint called the “soggy side of the shit burger,” plan B was definitely still up to their standards. They’d had no problems dispatching the few hired thugs they’d found patrolling the rig: the men in question seemed so ill-prepared for any kind of skilled combat that Steve felt sure they couldn’t be intended for much more than a sacrificial stalling technique. But the rig itself was another story. Twenty minutes into the mission, the team had already been forced to ditch their comms and Tony’s suit (thanks to a specialized EMP that had been coded to the sound of Tony’s voice), change course several times (due to sudden eruptions of some kind of purple gas), and split up (courtesy of a series of metal doors that slid down from the ceiling and locked into place whenever something triggered the accompanying control panel). And that wasn’t even counting the large explosive device buried somewhere in the lower levels, which FRIDAY had detected shortly before Tony’s suit had gone offline.
“So they just dressed him up like that to – what? Make him seem scarier? That’s super racist,” Clint shook his head.
------------
“Okay, since you’re determined to make this a thing: I hereby absolve you, Steven Grant Rogers, of all emotional support duties, henceforth and in perpetuity. The end. Is that what you need to hear? You’ve made it pretty clear that you’re not interested in being involved.”
"My boyfriend the last three years of grad school. At least it wasn't a tattoo."
"Duh."
“I will make the tiny potatoes,” Thor offered magnanimously, rising from the recliner fast enough that it gave a creak of surprise. He looked by far the least battered of any of them, despite having taken a header from a load-bearing wall when the bomb had detonated. “They are an excellent vehicle for ketchup.”
“Well, unfortunately for you, I happen to have a lot of experience in that area,” he replied finally, a new, sour note creeping into his voice. “And you’re right: the benefits package never quite covers the costs.”
“The sun’s going down…sun’s getting real low!” he boomed, rubbing vigorously at Bruce’s shoulders as the doctor slid to a halt.
All the theories sounded plausible, and none of them seemed sufficient. Steve couldn’t shake the feeling that he was missing something – something that should be right in front of him.
“Tony -” Rhodey started, but Tony cut him off by hanging up the phone.
Steve’s eyes held his for a long moment, and Tony wished, not for the first time, that he could see whatever battle Steve fought against himself in these moments. Normally, Tony’s instinct would be to experiment until he got a bigger reaction: to find a pressure point to squeeze or a sensitive spot to needle. But right now, Tony realized, all he wanted to do was to run his thumb gently along Steve’s jaw until the tension drained away.
He took a deep steadying breath. Tony was alive. They had hurt him, but he was alive. And Steve had to keep him that way. He tried to catch Tony’s eye to communicate this determination, but Tony’s gaze was fixed on Steve’s nose, where Steve could feel a small trickle of blood moving toward his lips.
“It does?” Steve asked, the pressure against Tony’s chest lightening as Steve pulled back to search Tony’s face.
“Unidentified Suspect Dead After Resisting Arrest,” the chyron read.
“You mean these?” She dangled a New York Mets keychain in the air.
“I don’t have a great track record here,” he admitted. “Seems like I’m always giving up too easily or waiting too long. But I don’t even know if Tony thinks of me that way. I mean sometimes I think he might be interested –”
He was just pulling himself to his feet when the door that he and Tony had originally walked through (or one of its copies – Steve honestly couldn’t be sure) cracked open, and Steve had his gun in his hand almost before he formed the conscious intention to draw it.
“We need a better plan, I agree,” Tony broke in. “But from what I hear, you’re the just the star-spangled man to see about getting one of those.”
“That building in Toronto was not short on personnel,” Natasha demurred. “Maybe not enough to take down a high-security target, but enough to give us another warning shot. I think it’s more likely the threat was a decoy than a bluff.”
“On it, Cap,” Clint confirmed, and Steve heard a faint whizzing noise as the archer shot an arrow that carried their zipline into position near the evac point. Steve beckoned to Harrison as he took the metal handle out of his utility belt. They got to the window just in time to see Tony shoot around the building, positioning himself to cover their exit. An explosion rocked the building from below, and Rumlow came hurtling out of a first-floor window, clutching a case under his left arm.
“Technically, this is my driveway,” Tony responded, stepping out of the car and following her into the sprawling first-floor common area. “I think the guy who financed the building retains a lifetime right to lurk anywhere on the premises.”
“You are…a hot door knob.” That didn’t seem quite like what he had meant to say.
“Water, Tony,” Steve responded, indicating the glass that Natasha was bringing over.
“With my phone charger and a butter knife,” Tony confirmed. “Had to get everyone else out of the hotel. But I didn’t have time to get to the stairs before I got cornered. I had to climb out the bathroom window, and it seemed easier to go one story up than four stories down.”
Steve seemed to notice his grip for the first time and let go with a grimace. He leaned forward to shut off the tap, his head tilting just enough for Tony to see the bruises mottling the left side of his face.
But even as he spoke, the pieces were falling horribly into place: the leak at SHIELD, Harrison telling him to turn off his comms, the bad intel during their extraction missions, the Mandarin disguise, even Rumlow’s behavior on the Lemurian Star – and most of all, the nagging feeling that he was missing something he should recognize.
“Steve,” Tony prompted. “Talk to me. What’s wrong?”
“This is why Bruce is my favorite,” she announced.
He stood up and strode toward the Christmas tree, gauntlet charging.
“And did it ever occur to you that someone might be living here?”
Bruce sighed and pulled another box of onion rings out of the bag. Tony took it and stuck his tongue out at Natasha, who flipped him off without a change of expression. Steve cleared his throat, struggling not to smile.
“That smile was not goofy,” Tony countered. “It was mocking – it was a show of richly deserved derision. You should see how Captain America is representing the Avengers to the heartland. It’s a sartorial disgrace.”
Dr. Grant waved and walked off towards the leg curls.
Coulson’s team had joined them for the first round (and then the second and third), and Steve had spent most of the evening watching quietly from one of the pieces of assorted furniture he and Thor had carried out from their bedrooms. Skye and Clint had designed a version of “margarita pong” that integrated the shrapnel strewn across the kitchen, and they were facing off against Natasha and May. It was hard to tell who was winning or losing, but it was very clear which team was drunker. Coulson and Thor were swapping stories about Asgardian adventures on Earth, and every once in a while Coulson would pause to let Thor make a toast with the large brass planter he was using as a beer stein. Simmons and Bruce seemed to have gotten halfway through a unified theory of something called “gravitonium” and were drawing equations energetically on what remained of an end table. Tony and Fitz had gone down to Tony’s workshop, and it wasn’t until they reemerged, gesticulating and talking eagerly over top of each other, that Steve realized his muscles had been tense the entire time Tony had been out of sight.
After a long moment, he rolled his shoulders back into an indolent slouch.
“Hey.”
The team chanted along with the countdown, Clint gathering a handful of tater tots for a ketchup toast with Thor and Natasha dancing her way over to plant kisses on Tony’s cheek and Steve’s forehead before sliding back in next to Bruce.
“Agent May is part of a special task force designing the op for this mission,” Fury explained. “This is –”
“Bite me,” Clint grinned, clapping a hand on Tony’s shoulder. “And nice hairdo, by the way. It really screams ‘I blacked out in my workshop again and slept in a puddle of motor oil.’” Steve’s face pinched tight as he scanned Tony’s face, but Natasha just rolled her eyes.
Careful is my middle name, Tony thought to himself wryly as he watched Rhodey leave, swiping right to answer the call and settling into his chair again.
“I never got the sense that it bothered Agent Carter too much that so few people came to see the papers,” he continued. “But for myself, I would have liked them to get a bit more air.”
“It wasn’t for a break, Tony,” Steve sighed, a deep flush burning over his face. “I was getting you flowers.”
“We’re not lovers,” Steve pointed out wryly.
James pulled the door open a crack and peeked out. His entire stance had changed, his shoulders broader, a military tension rippling through his body. And damn, now that he was flexing with purpose he -
Relief flooded through him as he recognized Steve’s voice.
“Access to lurking is one of the many perks of my position,” Tony said finally. “Not taking advantage of it would just be wasteful.”
“Now that’s an experiment we could try if you’re bored,” Tony suggested. Bruce’s frown deepened. “That was a joke, Bruce: to show you how well rested I am. Don’t look so dour. I’m fine, okay? You don’t need to keep mother-Hulking me just because you drew the short straw and got ‘manic Tony’ duty.”
"I'll fix it," she mumbled.
Tony choked on the words, and Steve squeezed his hand. He knew the end of the sentence before Tony finished it, because his own throat was tight with the memory of a portal stitching itself shut in the sky, the unbearably small speck of red that was a body plummeting to the ground.
Steve froze. He
“Nothing serious,” she assured him. “Just got knocked around a little.” She was sitting up now, already surveying the remains of the common room for additional threats. Normally, Steve would try to insist on a medical exam, but until they could figure out who to trust at SHIELD calling in their location could put them in even worse danger.
He had waited to corner Steve until they made it out of the press conference and into a quiet hallway. And watching the slope of Tony’s shoulders shift from indolent to exhausted the moment the two of them were alone, Steve was forced to adjust his assessment of Tony’s tendency to play bored in public.
Tony realized the line had moved on without him, so he scurried up to the window. He caught sight of a familiar mess of brown hair and leaned on the counter. "My darling May. How are you this fine Sunday afternoon?"
Thank you *so much* to everyone who has shared this fic with me. It has brought me so much joy to know that you are reading it and spending time in this little world. I hope it has brought you some bright spots as well, and I would love to hear what you think.
“Stop saying that,” Rhodey muttered in exasperation. “We have to get off this line. Do
“Is it —” he hesitated. “Is it okay if I touch you?”
“HYDRA?” Natasha asked.
“What – you’ve already got my replacement lined up?” Tony grinned. “Rhodey’s older than I am, you know, and he walks like the Tin Man for a full day if he falls asleep on the couch for too long. Don’t let him pull that ‘clean living’ line on you.”
May startled around. "Tony! Well, well, well. Didn't expect to see you today."
They had been in the middle of close-quarters practice – trying out different ways to incapacitate an attacker with hits or twists to the instep, ankles, wrists, groin – but it had devolved fairly quickly into a tripping contest.
“Romanov has an awfully big mouth for a spy,” Tony said with a rueful smile.
Tony slid into his usual seat at the back of the lecture hall, kicking his feet up onto the chair next to him and letting his sunglasses slip far enough down his nose to conceal the direction of his eyes as he poured over his notes from yesterday’s research. He’d been making decent progress on his book project – a study of unconventional military technologies in World War II – until he’d discovered a footnote in an old article about Margaret Carter that had made no sense at all: a reference to the pivotal role that something called “Project Rebirth” had played in the course of her life.
“Maybe you should have thought of that earlier,” Steve grumbled.
“You got hurt,” he continued, holding up a hand as Steve opened his mouth. “And don’t give me the ‘just a graze’ bullshit – a few inches to the left, and you could have been in critical condition. Just a foot to the right, and maybe it’s Happy. Or Pepper. Or some guy with a wife and three kids. And it’s not worth turning over my privacy, my freedom of movement, my ability to fucking
He was almost to the first steps when he heard a muffled crack. The wall next to him buckled, and he had to dart quickly to the side to avoid the collapsing metal. His lungs screamed in protest, but he gripped the railing of the stairwell and hauled himself forward, kicking steadily as he made his way up.
From somewhere on the bedside table, Steve’s phone erupted with the voice of Whitney Houston, the violin track reaching a crescendo just as Tony and Steve broke apart.
“You’ve got to be
“Hello everyone,” Coulson greeted them. “It’s an honor to be joining you here at Stanley College. I look forward to meeting each of you in turn, but as time is precious in the first week of classes, I’m going to call this meeting to order and then give the floor to Dr. Strange, the chair of the Faculty Affairs Committee.”
Tony noticed that Steve had to hide a small smile behind his hand and added a mental hash mark to the “Iron Man vs. Director That’s-Classified” tally that he kept running in his head during briefings.
“The fuck you don’t!” Tony retorted, his eyes snapping up to meet Steve’s. Something in Tony’s expression speared through Steve's chest like a second bullet, leaving a burning trail through his center. But almost as soon as Steve registered its presence, it was gone again, a blank stare falling across Tony’s face like the slamming of a door.
“Steve!” he yelled, scrabbling frantically at the hands that Natasha was now using to shove him firmly back in bed.
Grant shrugged. "I've been stuck before. It's about applying force in the right spot."
“So just to be sure I’m getting this right,” he murmured, “because I haven’t slept in a while, and it’s possible I’ve been the tiniest bit emotionally compromised this week: what you’re telling me is –”
“Well, I’ll be damned,” Tony whispered as Steve finished enveloping Tony’s other hand in his.
"And what about you?!"
He needed just one moment. His skull was pounding, but the sight of Tony – vibrating with energy, pinched with suppressed fear, but warm and pissed off and alive – was like coming up for air. Since he’d seen the footage from Malibu, Steve had been aching to see Tony’s chest rise and fall, to see the glow of the arc reactor that meant his heart was beating. The need had been so strong that Steve had barely been able to acknowledge it; and though he hadn’t let himself work out the odds, he knew this could be his last view. Maybe that’s why what came out of his mouth was:
“Right,” Steve replied.
, Tony finished silently.
He had just toggled over to his college email account to rectify the oversight - taking advantage of a free moment while the students prepared their discussion questions in small groups - when he saw the Google alert pop up in his inbox. It wasn’t the alert he’d set up at the beginning of the year to catch any mentions of Peggy Carter, he realized a moment later: it was the one he’d set up two weeks ago, partially out of idle curiosity and partially out of book-proposal-related panic. And apparently, it had paid off, because someone had just published a blog entry that mentioned Howard Stark.
“I wouldn’t,” Natasha cautioned. “You haven’t seen what he’s been like in here. I have. That man is not stable.”
forget what you really smell like.”
“Hey, I’ll be happy to pass my trump card whenever one of you wants to fly an armed nuclear weapon through a magical portal into space.”
Steve chewed his bottom lip.
Steve grinned back as he perched on the bed next to Tony, bringing his uninjured hand up to cup Tony’s face. Tony’s breath hitched slightly at the contact, and Steve swept a thumb across Tony’s cheekbone, his smile softening at the way it made Tony’s eyelashes flutter.
“I loved them both,” Steve replied, a stubborn set to his jaw. “Bucky and I didn’t know how to picture a future for what we had before the war. So when he decided to enlist, we gave it up. We both figured we’d get married eventually anyway. Have families. But some things really are better nowadays. If I could only tell him what was going to be possible later –”
“I don’t think so, Tony,” he smirked. “You look pretty unsteady there. I think I’d better stay nice and close —” He demonstrated by yanking Tony toward him. “You remember how much you’ve always needed a firm hand.”
“Nat said you gave her a very generous severance package,” Steve replied, a small smile tugging at one side of his mouth.
Harrison threw his arms over Steve’s shoulders and clung to his back as they shot down the line. Steve took three running steps as he hit the ground and then let Harrison disengage. Tony flew over their heads, Clint in tow, and they followed his path toward the waiting helicopter.
He pulled a small metal disk out of his pocket and clicked a button on the side. A video image appeared projected above it.
“Those tubers had truly been abandoned by the gods,” Thor agreed solemnly. “But I maintain that the Big Band Banana Pie was actually quite delicious.”
“I’m resting right now, Brucie,” Tony grinned, shooting another micro blast from his gauntlet at the sensors. JARVIS added the readings to the graph, and soon Tony would know exactly what frequency of electromagnetic pulse would have shorted out the explosive attached to Harrison’s skull with the least collateral damage.
“But that’s my point,” Tony retorted. “Grant is brand new – I bet the ink is barely dry on his final transcripts – and yet he comes charging into every meeting like he knows exactly what’s wrong with the college. No way you make yourself that vulnerable as a VAP unless you’ve got an angle.”
“Hey, you brought up Daddy – not me,” Clint smirked. “But before you go – or try to, anyway – can I give you some advice?”
“I’m sorry, did you say that was ‘retaliation’ or ‘deflection’?” Rhodey retorted, and Tony had to concede (privately, of course) that that was probably game point to Rhodey.
Grant stared at him blankly.
“Is that what you told Ty?” he asked, hoping the breathless edge to his voice came out as “playfully offhand” rather than “actively swooning.”
He barely made it around the corner and into the hallway before he was being swung around and held against the wall, one of Steve’s hands planted firmly against his chest.
“I didn’t come down here to fight, Stark,” Steve practically growled.
“Don’t,” Tony snapped. “We are
"I have a class…" James shifted towards the door.
“I know I’m a mess, Cap. It might look I’m not trying to stop it from hurting people, but I am. That’s why I’m down here.”
She and Steve were in the common room going over the footage Ward had brought them. They’d been at it for over an hour already – freezing frames, playing them backward, anything that might make something new pop out of the five-minute clip. But Steve had gotten distracted by the photo Tony had sent to the group text that morning. The picture had been taken in the foyer of the Malibu house: Tony was grinning manically, Pepper had her eyes raised to the ceiling in exasperation, and behind them loomed what appeared to be a giant stuffed rabbit.
“You’ll find out what happened to him.”
Tony twisted gracefully out of Steve’s hold and then jabbed a few rapid rounds at his outstretched hands.
“Glad to know you’re still discovering new reasons to be disappointed in me,” Tony continued, interrupting Steve’s thoughts. “Even after all the years you’ve known me, it’s good to know that I can still find new ways to let you down.”
On the one hand, it was an incredible windfall: more facts to go on than Tony would have dared to hope for when he was staring at walls of redacted text at the Houghton. On the other hand, it still told him frustratingly little about the human elements of the story. Why had Steve Rogers volunteered for multiple (apparently quite risky) weapons initiatives, and why had such an illness-prone private soldier been chosen for operations so sensitive? What was it about Rogers that had moved Carter enough to hold onto his personal effects - or to prompt the footnote about Rebirth having an incalculable effect on her life?
“I have to go to L.A.,” he told Steve. “Apparently this mutiny is a multi-front affair.”
“I know it’s me he’s after,” Tony said finally, “because he sent me a letter with a set of coordinates, a date and time, and a photograph of Barnes being watched through the scope of a rifle.”
“You and I both know that’s not true,” Steve said. “Because you betrayed him and your team.”
“Sure, yeah, of course,” Tony replied, tucking the notebook into the inside pocket of his overcoat. “I’ll get out of your hair.”
By the time they arrived at the location Maria Hill had given them, two bruises had bloomed on Steve’s temple and jaw, and Tony had to fight the urge to reach toward them as he set Steve down on the walkway above the dam. Instead, he retracted his helmet and stepped out of Steve’s space, waiting.
Tony’s feet hit the floor almost before the final thought had formed. He made it just two steps before his knees buckled, but it didn’t matter, because Steve had started moving as soon as Tony did, and when Tony half-jumped, half-collapsed into his arms, Steve caught him. Tony wrapped his legs around Steve’s hips as Steve pressed him against his chest, and then they were kissing each other with a desperation that allowed for no other sensation.
On the display, the man who had called himself the Mandarin in the broadcast weeks ago was sitting at a long, cluttered dressing table with his face angled toward a large mirror. He was talking, seemingly to the person recording the video. But his voice didn’t sound anything like the measured, lilting intonation the Mandarin had used when issuing his demands. This time he sounded British – and extremely drunk.
Dr. Grant didn't move.
Coulson stared at him evenly for a moment.
“Fair enough,” Steve grinned.
“Get the fuck off him, you goddamn cowards!” Tony was swearing up a storm as Ward and Rumlow took turns landing blows, and Steve could hear the sounds of Tony working to finish freeing himself from the chair. It wouldn’t be long before he jumped into the fight. Steve just needed ten good seconds.
“But I didn’t say that,” Steve protested.
be there. Tony hadn't actually booked the library space yet, so he had some leeway. Maybe he could find a time when Dr. Grant had class, or professional development, or was on vacation. Then even though he had nothing at all of substance to present, he wouldn't be embarrassing himself in front of his arch-nemesis. At the very least.
“Kinky,” Tony joked. And then, because he knew Rhodey had been very worried about him ever since his meltdown two weeks ago (when he’d run out of a date with Pepper and called his armor from an alleyway because someone was letting their cell phone ring unanswered, and suddenly he was blasting toward a hole in the sky, air thinning and light fading, and he was going to die up there, and no one would hear him screaming), he dropped the shields for a moment.
Tony’s hands moved to clasp Steve’s sides, and Steve couldn’t hold back a gasp at the sudden stab of pain through his ribs. He’d lost track of how long he’d been chained to the ceiling by his wrists, but the wrenches in his shoulders and back had eventually become monotonous enough that his brain had turned them into background noise. Now the tiniest shift in his position sent a spear slicing across his nerves.
“Okay, I know that one’s a lie,” Steve muttered, and Tony grinned back at him.
“What the fuck?” Tony muttered for the second time, and suddenly Grant’s cancelled classes seemed like they might actually be a big deal after all - just not for the reason Tony had imagined.
“It’s nothing,” Tony retorted easily. “I’ve got tons of these rattling around for when I need to reengineer something during a boring meeting. Plus I’m pretty sure I can write this off as a donation to an elderly veteran.” He paused to acknowledge Steve’s eye roll. “Just take it, Rogers. Use it to call home once in a while.”
Dr. Grant turned bright, innocent eyes on Tony. "Pardon?"
“Has anyone ever told you you’ve got a bit of a melodramatic streak?”
“Barton, please tell me you brought a suit.”
“Huh,” Tony acknowledged. “Would you look at that? So that means – and I’m saying this totally casually, by the way – because there is definitely not a part of my soul that’s trying to crawl its way screaming out of my body at this observation – but that means these two corpses –”
"Excuse me," came a cool voice from behind them.
Steve swept the smaller man up easily in his arms, running over to where Rumlow and Clint were waiting. He was just getting the agent arranged on a stretcher in the helicopter when he heard the sound of more blades warming up. Shit. That meant the terrorists were going to mount a pursuit. Steve looked over at Tony.
“My ass,” Tony put in, “just to clarify.”
“Funny, I don’t think you mentioned a killing spree when we were in the car.”
That earned him an eye roll, and Tony wondered how fondness could feel like someone was sewing your insides together with hot wire.
Steve stood staring at the place where Tony had been, grinding his teeth as he counted slowly to ten in his head. Five weeks on the road, and whatever clear air he had managed to store up could still be punched out of him with one look.
“I should go, actually,” he blurted out, trying to ignore the quick flash of disappointment on James’s face. “Gotta get the files from my office, and then I’ll probably just...look through them there. Get in a few hours of work.”
“Hey,” Tony repeated, and this time he gave Steve’s hand a tug, using his other hand to tap the spot where his arc reactor had been years ago. “Come here.”
was an interesting development.
“Well fuck me,” Tony breathed, and Steve felt another thrill of giddiness when Tony continued to grip his arms, though he looked steady enough on his feet by now.
“Nice of you boys to show up,” Natasha called out, and Tony saw two gunmen drop off the overpass as she ducked out from behind a tractor-trailer.
He shot Steve directly in the heart.
“I don’t know what you heard or saw in there,” Steve said, “but I wanted to tell you that the reason I care about the X-Files – it's not because I always need to feel like I’m in the right – or, that’s not the only reason anyway. That’s not why I wanted to be out there with you.”
Tony turned, surprise flashing across his face again. And that wouldn’t do, so Steve pulled Tony gently toward him. Tony relaxed into his chest with a sigh, wrapping his arms around Steve’s waist as Steve nestled Tony’s head against his chin. He traced his fingers lightly across the back of Tony’s neck and into his hair, breathing in the smell of coconut from his shampoo, the hint of motor oil that meant he’d been checking on the bots when he visited the workshop.
“The bruise is fine,” he responded.
“Good talk,” Tony said, and the doors slid shut between them.
“You gonna knock over an old man?” Steve grinned as Tony tried to hook his ankle with one foot.
wasn’t “concern” - which is what he was explaining patiently to Bruce while they mingled over cheap wine and cheaper crackers during the reception.
“Steve’s alive,” Clint said quickly. “Tony, he’s alive.” He gripped Tony’s shoulder as Tony pitched forward, clutching at his chest.
“Great,” he said. “Well, it’s been fun while it lasted, Rogers. We’ll never have Paris, etcetera. I know the drill.”
“It’s part of the job to stand next to each other when the fight starts,” Steve said firmly. “You know that, because you’re the one who knew we’d all show up in New York. You’re the one who invited us all into your home. You made us a team. That means your enemies are our enemies. And if someone comes for you, we’ll be there. Every time.”
“You’re right,” Steve told him. “I do love you.”
“Was that an attempt to butter me up, Stark?” he asked. “Because if so, I would estimate that your chances of getting on my good side are going to be inversely correlated to the amount of time you spend in my office.”
“I’ve been wondering for a while,” Steve said. “Bruce almost Hulked out on me when I told him I led Nat into a booby-trapped HYDRA bunker. And I’m pretty sure I saw them holding hands when we dragged him onto that roller coaster.”
That threat must have been effective at clearing the room, because Tony heard no more interruptions as Steve lowered him carefully back onto the bed. Tony twined one of his hands into Steve’s hair to hold him in place, indicating with a low growl and a squeeze to Steve’s hips that he was not, under any conditions, letting go. Steve seemed eager to take the hint. He followed Tony onto the bed, carefully holding his own weight on his elbows but continuing to kiss Tony greedily into the pillow he was arranging under Tony’s head. The movements were so gentle and hungry at once, and they made Tony ache with tenderness. He arched his hips off the bed so that he could feel the movement of Steve’s breathing against his chest. Steve responded by pressing one hand into the small of Tony’s back: holding Tony up or holding them together, Tony couldn’t tell.
Tony was vaguely aware of Natasha grousing at Sam and a bedraggled looking Bucky Barnes for their failure to keep Steve in bed – and even more vaguely aware of Sam suggesting that Natasha was welcome to try getting Steve to do anything at all when there were alarms going off in Tony’s hospital room. But he could only spare about 5% of his brainpower for that. Because Steve was alive, and there was no wall between them.
The effect of this pronouncement was somewhat marred by the fact that it was issued upside-down and almost directly into Steve’s lower back: the position Tony had been occupying since Steve had thrown him over his shoulder in a fireman’s carry a few minutes earlier.
“Not when I knew him,” Arnie retorted, waving his hand again to indicate that Tony should take a seat. “When I knew him, he was taking night classes in life drawing and getting his scrawny ass handed to him behind every brownstone in the borough. The skinniest, scrappiest son of a bitch I’ve ever seen.”
“Rude,” Tony replied, moving into the kitchen to grab a mug from the cupboards. “That one doesn’t count for your total, because it’s rude and it’s unfounded.”
“Well, it’s you, Wilson, so that could mean anything,” Tony pointed out. “Steve could pin you while leaking spinal fluid out of both his ears.”
“Don’t be,” Tony responded. “Hey, look, it’s not your fault you don’t feel the same way.”
Rumlow drew his gun and started to move toward the struggle, but Tony lunged forward with his own, suddenly free right hand and – using a grip they had practiced while sparring – broke Rumlow’s wrist. Rumlow howled and dropped the gun, and Steve leveled a sharp punch at Ward’s jaw before rolling to the side to grab the firearm. Ward had stayed down after the last punch, so Steve trained the gun on Rumlow as he moved slowly to collect the other weapon.
“Yeah, fuck yeah,” Tony said. “Fucking, now, yes.”
He turned and walked out of the workshop – to go find people who ate and slept like functional adults, Tony assumed – and Tony turned back to the electrical sensors.
“No no no no no,” Tony whispered, compressing frantically with every syllable. “Please, Steve. Come on. Don’t do this. Don’t leave me. I can’t –”
Tony stared down at their tangled hands, his face as still as Steve had ever seen it.
Tony gave him a tight smile, leaning back in his chair and forcing Steve to move quickly to avoid yanking his hair.
Steve felt like someone had dropped hot coals into his chest. He wanted to lie – to tell Tony he would be fine, take some force out of the fear that was pinching at Tony’s features. It
he could say instead,
“You’re awake,” he managed, wrapping one of his hands around Tony’s. “The doctor said you’d be out for hours, so of course you had to show him up.” His face pinched toward a smile and didn’t stick the landing.
“Rhodey, I am offended. Are you implying that I am developing a crush on Captain America as a coping mechanism?”
He dropped quickly into a crouch and swept his right leg at Tony’s ankles. Tony jumped, almost in time to avoid the attack, but he lost his balance as Steve’s leg grazed the tips of his toes. Even before his brain could fully register the possible danger, Steve shot forward to grab Tony by the waist and stop him from landing awkwardly.
Tony stilled for a moment and then started bouncing faster.
Tony barked out a laugh, and Steve smiled.
“You’re…Captain America,” Harrison managed blearily.
“Luckily, Barton, little HALL-O here is solar-powered,” Tony said, patting the bot, which swiveled one if its laser-equipped arms toward him in response. “So you can all suck it, because tonight I’m going to be drinking the sweet apple cider of victory.”
Nearly tucked behind a stack of binders on top of the filing cabinet was another frame with a faded sketch of Lake Como that looked vaguely familiar. Tony couldn't put his finger on the artist, but it looked like it could be an original.
“What the hell,” he swore.
“Anything that involves preheating is self-serve,” Steve shot back as he rifled through the cupboards for popcorn and chips.
. But hey, I feel like we’re getting off on the wrong foot here. Why don’t you pull up a chair?”
“Is there anything that shuts you up?” Steve murmured with a smile, pausing in his progress to press Tony’s back against the wall of the hallway and capture his mouth in a searing kiss.
“Neither do I,” Natasha admitted. “And it’s starting to seriously annoy me.”
Bruce must have fetched him from the gym, because Steve’s cheeks were pink and his skin was covered in a sheen of sweat. His shirt clung to his chest, and wow that last shot of vodka had been a mistake, because Tony actually gulped at the way Steve’s arm muscles flexed as he gripped the worktable.
Steve followed the trail of Tony’s voice back toward consciousness, shaking his head to clear the last layers of haze and heaviness as the taupe walls of the hospital room swam into focus.
And then he raised the gun to point it toward his own temple.
“I’d like to raise the bet,” he said. “Nothing shy of two yards of fabric.”
Tony turned to see Dr. Grant storming out of the cafeteria after him. He was so tired and frustrated that he snapped out, "What? Do you want my shoes and my favorite cereal spoon too?"
"Tony, please," he said, reaching out to shake Grant's hand. He found he liked the way it had sounded coming out of Grant's mouth earlier, and there was only a 43% chance it was the commanding, assured way he’d said it. "Thanks again for helping me out - though I still don't get how you did."
What he found was not an abundance of matter. The sheets of paper, many yellowed with age, didn’t even fill the box to the brim. At the top of the stack was an Enlisted Reserves ID card, which gave Rogers’ date of enlistment as July 1943, for the duration of the war plus six months. He’d joined the reserves at twenty-six years old, and according to the second half of the card, he’d had blonde hair, blue eyes, a fair complexion, and stood just 5’4” tall. Tony supposed that last fact explained some of the ass kickings.
good time again — help you loosen up.”
A moment later, Steve saw Tony collapse sideways into her arms. Natasha retrieved the needle from his neck and gripped his wrist and thigh to pull him over her shoulders. She hefted his weight carefully, and then looked up at Steve through the water rising against the window.
Steve let Tony continue his monologue while he conducted a sweep of the room. He knew his habit of checking the undersides of tables and couches was probably drawing eye rolls from the direction of the kitchen, but Steve had his own strategies for unwinding the tension that bunched up like barbed wire at the back of his neck. This time, however, he barely made it to the coffee table in the common area before his nerves started firing in alarm. Something was wrong – something
The man standing across the room from him was pale-haired and broad-chested, his muscular arms crossed across a purple shirt that looked too old for his age. A large bandage had been wound around part of his head, and a range of smaller wraps and plasters dotted his forearms and hands. The bandages didn’t give the impression of a man who was particularly careful in his comings and goings, and yet Tony had heard no sound of his approach.
“You’re going to tell us where to find Fury,” Ward commanded, cocking his gun and keeping it trained on Tony. “You’ve got until the count of five, and then I start shooting appendages.”
“You don’t fucking say!” Tony replied. “By the way…did you seriously shout ‘over here, assholes’ when you came out of the stairs? Is that the kind of advanced tactics they teach you in basic training these days?”
“Pepper, what’s wrong?” Steve asked, fighting to keep his voice calm. Natasha jerked toward him, her expression going tight and hard. “Are you okay?”
“So I want to ask you a question – which you do not have to answer,” Natasha said. “But I feel like if you don’t answer, that’s kind of answering, you know?”
"No! I'm not leaving until you tell me what the fuck is going on!"
After a horrible silence that might have lasted a second or a century, Steve sat up with a rattling gasp. Tony barely had time to register the fact that he was now tucked in Steve’s lap before Steve had swept Rumlow’s gun off the ground and pointed it toward the door, his other arm curling Tony protectively toward his chest.
The result was that Steve had been finding it increasingly hard to say “no” to Tony’s pitches about the paranormal, even when they involved ex-soldiers who appeared to be spontaneously exploding in public places or a creature called the Fiji Mermaid. Steve found it especially hard to say “no” at close range. There was something about the way the corner of Tony’s mouth tugged upward when he came across a case that he knew Steve would find particularly irritating. Or perhaps it was the way that, even in the gloom of a starless night, Tony’s eyes always seemed to reflect some extra source of light Steve couldn’t otherwise detect.
“I think I did this in the wrong order,” he blurted out.
The silent auction had been a night full of glad-handing and photo ops for Tony, which meant a night of scrutinizing New York’s wealthiest for Steve. By the time Tony congratulated the last of the auction winners, twisting his head over his shoulder just far enough to mouth “finally” at an angle only Steve would catch, Steve felt sure that he had scanned more Botoxed faces and overpriced cuff links than there were people in Manhattan – let alone people rich enough to afford a $50,000-minimum-bid dinner.
"What?!" Tony's jaw dropped. "I'm cut to the quick. How could you?"
He rolled over on the double bed that Laura Barton had set up for them, his face turned toward the ceiling so Steve could see his profile faintly silhouetted against the moonlight from the window. It had been hours now since their argument in the yard, and since then they’d been treating each other carefully. But Steve could see the lines of stress still pinching Tony’s features.
There was so much else to apologize for – for not seeing the field clearly, for letting his feelings cloud his judgment, for leaving Tony alone – but before Steve could continue, they both froze at the sight of the third-floor door swinging open just two feet in front of them.
It wasn’t “disappointment,” or even “frustration” - and it
Had that come from the direction Natasha and Tony were headed?
The man leaned around Tony to look at the doorway.
“What the fuck?” Ty hissed.
“I’m picking up a small explosive device,” Fitz started.
“Just don’t start warming up without me.”
Pepper laughed. She turned away from her computer and leaned her elbow on her desk. "Decisions are made by those who show up."
What about the students?"
, if a person wanted to demonstrate that he had a working knowledge of any pop culture that postdated Jerry Lee Lewis – and thus that he was not, in fact, born with the soul of a 94-year-old man – that person would be able to tell me who their favorite Spice Girl was.”
“Hey,” Tony said, poking at Steve’s shoulder as Steve tried to concentrate on the movie the team had chosen, “you’re really strong, right? But also, like, precise. I bet if you hit me on the head with this remote in just the right way…”
“I followed him,” he said, as evenly as he could manage, “because I needed my car keys.”
Pepper sighed deeply, pinching the bridge of her nose in a move Tony recognized as analogue to the Jaw Clench of Judgment.
How was Grant going to make any of his own research deadlines at this rate?
“God, you’re such a pedant these days,” Ty laughed, swaying further into Tony’s space in a way that Tony knew was not remotely accidental. “Is that Steve ‘Stick up his Ass’ Rogers trying his best to rub off on you? You need someone to show you a
Of course, this whole process would be a lot easier if he had taken time to catalogue the contents of the unit on the previous visit - or if his dad hadn’t been such a goddamn paranoid hoarder in the first place, Tony amended.
He buried his face in his hands, gripping at the curls around his temples to fight back the tears burning in the corners of his eyes.
The two of them exchanged gifts and took up their usual positions on the living room couch, Steve chuckling when Tony instantly started shaking the wrapped box for clues. Steve pulled the blanket from the couch over Tony’s shoulders absent-mindedly as Tony affixed the bow from his present to Steve’s chest. Neither of them paid any attention to the television – where Scrooge was asking a passing child what day it was – or to the windows, where the snowy remains of the earlier storm were pressing lightly against the panes.
“Well, you’ve got me there, Tony,” Steve replied. Slowly and deliberately, he turned over his cards to reveal a king and a ten.
Darcy groaned and leaned back against the shelf, making the whole thing creak concerningly. "I should go back to Poli Sci."
The old wistfulness filled her again as she remembered their faces: all the lovers they'd help escape the poor, cramped forms of devotion that the mortal world would allow. And perhaps Clint could feel the pull of nostalgia too, because he ambled over to wrap his arms around her from behind.
A chorus of boos and a smattering of tossed cookies followed Clint’s laughing retreat back through the ducts.
It was infuriating, really, because Tony had spent all day reviewing the World’s Most Coma-Inducing Slide Presentations ahead of the Board meeting tomorrow – a meeting for which he’d also promised Pepper that he would stay sober – and so the very least he deserved for so much good behavior was for the supersolider with whom he’d been hopelessly infatuated for the last two years to show a little skin, for Christ’s sake. The only consolation available was that Tony was playing about as well as Steve, having sacrificed only his tie and a pair of cufflinks to win a button-down shirt from Bruce on the previous hand.
Steve moved quickly to put himself between Tony and the door, but before he could get to work on Tony’s restraints an agonizing pressure hammered through his skull. The pain was so sudden that Steve stumbled and dropped to one knee, his hands coming up to grip the sides of his head.
He held both his hands out to the side to demonstrate. But he had barely gotten his gun pointed toward the ceiling when Steve’s fired, and Tony looked down to see a horrible flowering of red unfolding across his gut.
“Especially not then,” Tony replied. He pulled Steve toward him and kissed him softly, letting their noses brush together until Steve let out an impatient noise and pressed deeper, pushing their clasped hands above Tony’s head and running his free hand up Tony’s back. Tony found his lips curling into a smile, and he hooked one thumb under Steve’s chin.
Today was not a good day. Today there had been too many civilians and far too many close calls, and the mood in the elevator, which was silent except for the faint sound of Bruce’s fingers worrying at a loose thread on his blanket, was heavy with the latent anxiety they were all too tired to blow off. Even the ding that announced they had arrived at the residential floor sounded hollow as it resounded through the cabin.
“Please,” Tony replied, so quickly that he winced internally. He stepped back to let Steve through the door. “Is everything all right? You’re not hurt?”
“Steve,” Tony managed.
“The time we went to Six Flags?” Tony asked.
Tony stared at him.
“I’m very stubborn,” Steve explained, letting out a sharp hiss as Tony put pressure on the wound.
Steve had been called away shortly after the meeting with Ward and had been gone for two days on a mission somewhere in the Indian Ocean with Natasha and the SHIELD strike team. It was pure coincidence that Tony was catching him so soon after he got back, because he definitely hadn’t told JARVIS to alert him as soon as Steve and Natasha returned to the Tower. And since he couldn’t have known the mission was over, Tony definitely hadn’t moved up his coffee run to increase the chance of bumping into them to confirm they were okay. Why would he be worried? After all, he
“Sorry to interrupt, but I have to borrow Dr. Grant here,” he announced, wrapping a hand around Grant’s upper arm for reasons that were purely tactical, “there’s an oil-paint-related emergency in the Fine Arts building that is very real and definitely not something I’m making up right now to get him out of this conversation. Thanks for coming - always a pleasure to get another question about ontology from the author of both ‘Ten Ways of Thinking about Ontology’ and ‘Ten More Ways of Thinking about Ontology.’”
“He doesn’t even go here,” Tony whispered theatrically.
“That is a flagrant violation of the treaty protecting adolescent activities,” Tony protested. “According to the Geneva Convention, I am required to inform you that all references to my freshman dorm room – or to any matters concerning my physical appearance at age fifteen – will be considered an act of war, and thus open to retaliation. I have photo evidence of your attempt to grow a mustache junior year, and I am not afraid to send it to the Joint Chiefs.”
“So what do you say, soldier?” Tony asked, a new, sharp note in his voice that cut through the narrow space between them like a shard of glass. “Can I give you the world’s most life-affirming blowjob? I’ll pull out all your favorite stops.”
“You and me both,” Tony agreed.
“I’m in a suit of armor,” Tony pointed out, “and you’re the one who asked to be thrown through glass into a room full of armed terrorists.”
He paused, jabbing a cardboard coaster at Bruce for dramatic effect.
Steve’s mouth twisted.
“If Tony wanted to hear from me, he would have stuck around,” he said finally.
in the privacy of his own home.”
“You don’t have to come, you know,” Tony said, ignoring the part of his mind that was already shriveling at the possibility that Steve would take the out. “I know big parties aren’t really your thing. If you’d rather just catch up with Sam and Bucky —”
Tony lingered longer over the next sheet: a light pencil sketch of a train thundering through a mountain pass. The lines were soft but assured, at least to Tony’s amateur eyes, and the cheap quality of the paper somehow made the scene feel more moving. A series of drawings followed, some of landscapes and a few of what appeared to be fellow soldiers, and Tony wondered what had made an attentive, chronically-ill artist want to go from getting beat up in Brooklyn to getting thrown on barbed wire at the front.
Ty’s face was slightly flushed from the alcohol, but his eyes were sharp as they roved over Tony’s slim tee-shirt and tailored jeans.
Steve looked up, and the fight seemed to seep out of him. His grip on the table went loose, and he let out a long sigh.
Tony grit his teeth together hard enough that he felt his dentist wince from fourteen blocks over. "Thanks…"
Steve swallowed past the lump in his throat, trying to give his team an acknowledging smile.
“You're going to tell us where to find Fury,” Ward commanded, cocking his gun and keeping it trained on Tony. “You’ve got until the count of five, and then I start shooting appendages.”
“Agent Harrison,” Steve said, laying one hand gently on the man’s shoulder. “My name is Steve Rogers, and I’m here to get you home. Do you think you can walk?”
"It's an
It had been one week, three hours, and just over fifteen minutes since Tony had spoken to him.
“Play nice, boys,” Natasha admonished with a small smile. “Sam’s just tired of Steve moping around all the time.”
“Hold on,” Steve told Harrison. “Help is coming. We’re going to –”
(See the end of the chapter for
Crisco-based dessert, Steve was sure he had gone far enough to reveal the joke; but Bruce and Clint had continued nodding encouragingly and jotting down notes.
“Fuck that, Steve,” Tony snapped, popping back into view to slam one fist against the door. “I am not leaving you: do you hear me? I will stay right here, and the water will get through eventually, and then we’ll both drown, so you might as well use your stupid, miracle-of-modern-science muscles to open this goddamn door so I can get your stubborn ass out of here.”
“Right,” Tony agreed, “cover me.”
“Thanks for bringing this to us, Ward,” Natasha said, in what Steve recognized as her Black Widow voice. She moved in close to the other agent, swaying into his space, and then pressed his hand warmly before smoothly sliding the disk into her own. “This footage is going to be a huge help to us.”
“I thought it was Fury’s intel they were after,” Steve said. “Why wouldn’t they send the videos to him? Or to Nat?”
As it turned out, Tony
Rumlow yanked Tony’s head backward, and he came up spluttering and gasping.
“Tony,” he called, “I really have to get home.”
“First of all,” Tony said, “and I need everyone to hear this on multiple levels: how dare you?”
Tony felt a flutter of nerves that was both familiar and not - a slight racing of the pulse he’d felt at the gym, and again when he saw James walk into the room for his talk - and suddenly a truly terrible suspicion started to take shape in his mind.
Tony dropped his head into his hands.
“Everybody down!” he yelled, grabbing Tony’s shoulder with one hand and pulling him backward and toward the ground. With the same momentum, he lunged forward, twisting to put the bulk of his body between Tony and the man in the jacket. As Steve dropped to cover Tony’s position on the floor, two shots rang through the room, and something hot and sharp snicked across his side like a bee sting. Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s head, hunching his shoulders to be sure he had shielded his torso completely, but he couldn’t hear any additional shots over the screams of the guests.
“I needed a distraction.” Steve chuckled, and then winced when the movement set off a fresh burn of pressure across his stomach. “And you’re one to talk: did you set fire to our hotel room?”
“Clint,” Tony repeated, looking back and forth from the stranger to the suddenly roaring fire, “as in Clint Barton. As in the ex-military sniper who changed his name to Charles Rushman when he married Soviet spy Natasha Romanov, and whose real identity only became common knowledge after he and his lover killed each other in this house forty-three years ago.”
“All of you out of here
“I don’t believe anything you’re saying,” Tony insisted. “So you can cut the ESP-KGB mind tricks and open the goddamn door!”
The speech had poured out of Steve in a rush of feeling. But now Tony was staring at him with an inscrutable expression on his face, and Steve felt a flush creeping up the back of his neck. That had probably been too much, he thought ruefully, because Tony’s eyes were searching his face, and Natasha was giving him a smirk across the table that looked too knowing by half.
“Oh, I’m sorry. I ‘don’t need to worry’ about the woman whose honey-blonde tresses fall perfectly into place after every backflip like she was anointed at birth by Vidal Sassoon?”
“It’s the same room,” Steve remarked. “And don’t –” He held up a finger as Tony’s mouth opened automatically. “– call me Captain Obvious. Let’s check the next one.”
“We can get out any time,” Steve tried again. “If it takes longer than a few minutes to get us moving, I can always just wrench the doors open.”
“I’ve got company on the first floor,” Rumlow put in.
“What? Boy Genius, you’re killing me with this monkey,” Tony responded. “You built a set of automated forensic drones in your dorm room and you’re coming to me with monkeys. Coulson, I’m hiring your team.”
Tony gently shuffled the papers out of their protective sleeve, laying them flat on the table so he could snap a photo of each one with his phone. When he got to the third sheet in the pile, he came across more names to add to his notes: “Abraham Erksine,” who appeared to be the author of the notes; “Chester Phillips,” whose name Tony recognized as belonging to a colonel who had been briefly attached to Camp Lehigh; a U.S. senator named “Craig Brandt”; and a couple of private soldiers by the names of “Gilmore Hodge” and “Steven Rogers.”
“Careful waving that thing around, soldier,” a voice chastised slyly, and by the time Steve had settled into a defensive stance there was a red-haired woman in a black dressing gown leaning against the second-story doorway, a small smile playing at her lips.
“Interesting,” Tony muttered, training his flashlight over the third, identical sets of sconces. Steve might have chosen a different word to describe the situation, but just at that particular moment, he didn’t feel like reflecting too hard on what it would be.
know what I'm talking about!"
At the end of the line was a train in Austria. A few seconds faster, and his hand would close around Bucky’s: he would be so strong that the fall would never come.
Just the epilogue left to go! Thanks for sticking around!
, Bruce scrawled under Tony’s note. Tony’s eyes narrowed. He remembered now that Justin Hammer had just started his post-tenure leave, but Tony had been sure the Fine Arts department had only hired for a one-year position.
. But Tony had somehow been juggling a product launch and a major acquisition at Stark Industries while also suiting up to fight Doombots, HYDRA agents, and something Clint had dubbed “the cuttlefish from Hell.” Steve had been trying his best to give Tony his space, but after the battle with the Doombots – when Tony had apparently nodded off mid-flight, clipped the side of a building with his shoulder, and ended up plowing through a billboard – Steve had been feeling extra vigilant.
He walked out of the room, signaling to Sitwell to follow him. Rumlow moved out of Steve’s line of vision, running his mouth as soon as the door closed.
“Thank God,” Tony murmured, and then he cupped Steve’s jaw with his free hand, leaned forward, and kissed him.
“Barton, Romanov,” nitroglycerin greeted them with the barest of nods.
A polite smattering of laughter followed, and Tony flashed a tight smile, only to have it stretch a notch tighter when he saw Dr. Grant slipping into an open chair near the back. So much for Tony’s hopes that Grant would be too busy getting ready for his students’ gallery opening to attend the talk - not that anything about the past few months had suggested Tony would catch a break.
“I can’t,” he groaned.
“Because ‘we tried our best, and that’s all we can do’?” Tony asked, not quite in the mood to be talked out of his stomach-full of dread. “I wasn’t under the impression that anyone in this room was wowing their therapists with an ability to accept their personal limitations.”
Exhaustion slammed sideways into Tony like a Mack truck, so he saved a screenshot of Dr. Grant's next month so he could book the library and logged out. "We deserve ice cream," he told Dummy, pushing out of his chair. He took Dummy's silence for agreement.
“No,” Steve said firmly, his gaze painfully earnest. “There’s no ‘but’ here. Any trust you put in him that he betrayed — that’s on him. No one does anything to deserve that, and you —” Steve trailed off, uncrossing and recrossing his arms with an energy that seemed suddenly nervous. “You deserve the best.”
“Fury said there might be a leak,” Clint chimed in. He was leaning back in his chair, balancing it on two legs while he juggled packets of soy sauce. Every few minutes Thor threw another packet into the air, and Clint caught it and added it to the mix. “Maybe the Mandarin’s got a homicidal inside man,” he continued, and then, at a glance from Natasha, amended, “I mean a homicidal inside person.”
There, he thought wryly, that sounded a little bit less like, “I didn’t ask to be woken up into this world, but you were the first person in it to make me feel something that wasn’t emptiness, and then you almost died, so I’m afraid that if I stuck around another day I would blurt out something extremely embarassing to the whole team, not to mention to the gorgeous woman you’re dating.”
“This is how you want to say that for the first time?” he asked teasingly, his hands coming up to brush at Steve’s sides just above the hem of his jeans. “On the couch, surrounded by our catcalling friends and the scorched remains of the homicidal holiday ornaments I created?”
Steve responded with a noise that sounded embarrassingly close to a growl, and by the time the doors slid shut behind them, the flicker was already forgotten.
“Hmm?” Tony asked absently. “Oh yeah, sure. Knock yourself out.” He was still staring down at the paper, and all the lines of his body that had been relaxing since they got home had snapped taut again. Steve felt his own chest tighten at the sight, his jaw clenching as if preparing to take a punch.
Tony woke up to the feeling of a hand brushing softly across his forehead. It took a moment to register the shape of the fingers – and for some part of his brain to notice that they didn’t fit with the scenes his memory was conjuring – before he was shooting upward in a jolt of fear.
“How about adored?” Steve asked, feeling himself flush with the embarrassment and pleasure of saying it. “If you’ll let me.”
When the smoke cleared and the ringing in his ears stopped, the first thing Steve could hear was JARVIS.
“Tony,” Bruce groaned.
Tony blinked twice, shot Darcy a look, getting a
“I didn’t know we were already picking favorites,” Tony complained, reaching out to grab an onion ring only to have Natasha slap his hand away with lightning speed.
“So you admit I saved half the Eastern Seaboard,” Tony replied, marking the point with an emphatic wave of the banana.
Thor, Clint, Bruce, and Natasha filed out – Thor clapping a heavy hand across Bruce’s shoulders as they passed through the doors – but Steve hesitated, the tight remnants of fear tugging at him as if there were a string tied between Tony’s chest and his.
“Nat! This fucking idiot locked himself in, and the place is going to flood,” Tony explained rapidly. “Help me get the door open.”
The two of them were observing their monthly ritual of hitting the local dive bar after a lecture by a visiting speaker. In any previous semester, the talk they’d just attended – an analysis of the figure of extinction in the poetry of Alfred Lord Tennyson – would probably have led to the kind of meandering debate that had first brought Bruce and Tony together over a pitcher of margaritas and a plate of over-salted nachos during their new-faculty orientation. They’d settle into a booth by the door and wander toward a topic about which they both knew
“The dwarves are reading some promising heat signatures on the third floor, northwest corner,” came a voice that May had introduced as Leopold Fitz.
“Our mission almost went sideways,” Steve resumed. “It turns out Rumlow had separate instructions – something about data extraction. He missed the rendez-vous point, so we went to look for him. When we found him downloading files, I lost my temper, and a grenade almost blew up in Nat’s face because of it. I can’t stop replaying it. It was like I was back in that helicopter again – people getting hurt because I can’t see the whole field.”
“Shit,” he sighed again, ending the call before the tone could prompt him to leave a message.
“I don’t owe you mission reports, remember?” he continued, and he had the satisfaction of watching a twist of annoyance at the corner of Steve’s mouth.
“Who’s Sharon?” Tony asked.
Maybe Rogers had played a larger role in Project Rebirth than Tony had thought, which might explain how Carter had come into possession of his records. But why would she give the files to his community college with so little fanfare? And why hadn’t Tony come across any other mentions of Rogers’ name in the studies of her career?
“You’re overreacting,” she said, raising her voice to be heard over the crowd of people gathered in the living room of the Delta Phi sorority house. “You’ve only been here for fifteen minutes. How much could you possibly have ruined?”
charm. He was probably planning to spend the evening helping Parker paint cartoon trash cans on plywood for the production of
"Oh yeah, for sure. It was a very low-speed spin-out, and the snow was still soft. Not even an elbow bump." Tony wobbled his elbow to show how fine it was, and James laughed.
“What?” Pepper asked him, her eyes darting in the direction of his gaze.
Right before he went downtown and helped little old ladies cross the street.
He had to call it – they couldn’t just sit here. He tried to pull his thoughts together, feeling as if he were dragging them up from a great depth. From the looks of it, the attack had happened over an hour ago. Why had it taken them so long to get the code? Was something happening at SHIELD headquarters? No one without SHIELD intel could have located Fury outside of work. Was it possible that this new HYDRA cell could be so well organized?
“I just never could resist a nice pair of ankles – or the ability to stage a murder-suicide in under an hour.”
“Those bodies right –” Steve pointed at the place where Tony had uncovered the corpses dressed in their clothing and found himself gesturing toward a completely unremarkable expanse of solid floor. “– there,” he finished faintly.
“I was going to say that I don’t negotiate with banana pushers,” Tony said, “but now that I know it will annoy Barton, I’m in. JARVIS, order us the finest fruit baskets in the land and cue up
Tony’s eyebrows shot up, and Steve waved his hand dismissively.
“I promise I’m going to start shooting if you two don’t
“What?” Tony asked with exaggerated innocence. “I have models for the whole team. There’s even a little Cap ornament with magnets for the hug and fly.”
“Though Howard Stark was never able to capitalize financially on his work for the U.S. Army, rumors in the weapons-tech industry suggest that he was later instrumental in the transformation of the SSR into a government organization known as S.H.I.E.L.D.”
They both knew what he meant, of course – in the same way that Tony would always hear an echo of her brother’s voice in the way she said his last name. For a moment Tony wanted to ask her, “when you saw what I saw, did you know it would make me do this too? Did you know I’d have to get in a car every time he got hurt?” But her being there to greet him seemed like its own kind of answer to that question.
"I'm not the one in trouble," Tony breathed. He sat so they were knee to knee. "Okay. So let me explain this. I found this note in my dad’s things - after you mentioned something about SHIELD - and at first I thought it was a code name for a weapons project, but now I know it’s a whole goddamn secret government agency -"
Steve had been so young when he made this deal, Tony remembered – so much younger than Tony had been when he shot his way out of a cave, already on borrowed time. Steve had thought he was signing up to die for people. He couldn’t have imagined the highest cost of his bravery would be that he’d have to outlive them.
“HYDRA?” Bruce wondered. “Like from the 40s?”
“You've been what I need since the day we met,” Tony said, and as he wove their fingers together, he felt the warmth thread through his chest, tying off edges he hadn’t even realized were frayed. “But you’re going to need a better suit of armor.”
“Come on, baby,” he whispered as he calibrated the pulse. “Come back to me.”
A spasm moved across Steve’s face, and Sam let out a low whistle.
“What if this obscure footnote has remained an obscure footnote because there’s actually no there there?” Tony jumped in. “What if I blow my chances of getting this book under contract before I go up for full professor by obsessing about a tiny detail that may turn out to be nothing more than a heavily redacted military boondoggle? What if this time next year, Hayward is climbing over my prone body on the way to his new office as Associate Dean, and I have only these loose pages of inconclusive notes and a middle-aged hamster with obsessive-compulsive tendencies to comfort me as I slide slowly into ever-increasing professional obscurity?”
"I…" Dr. Grant's cheeks flushed slightly. "I thought you two were arguing in the library earlier, and I wanted to make sure she was okay. She assured me she came out the victor."
“Need your help?” he responded. “Always.”
“Listen to me, Tony. I don’t know how you heard that name, but you have to drop that thread immediately. Do you understand?”
Thirty minutes later, Tony was forced to admit that he had not, in fact, driven through worse. His knuckles were white around the steering wheel as he made his way gradually down a backroad, leaning forward to try to peer through the pounding sleet. It was getting nearly impossible to see further than the next ten feet, but he was over halfway there already, so turning back would be even more time in the snow than just continuing on his way. He could easily wait out the worst of the storm on campus; he had a key to Pepper's office, and her couch was the most comfortable to sleep on, if it came to that.
“Historians of weapons technology in World War II have the blessing and the curse of being spoiled for choice,” he began. “The atomic bomb, the cavity magnetron, and even the disastrously ill-made and unconscionably named Panjamdrum: the second world war produced no shortage of objects designed to alter and shorten the course of human life.”
“Perfect,” Steve muttered. And with a deep sigh, he turned toward the house and strode resignedly up the front walk.
“You too, Tony,” he said.
“STOP!” Steve yelled. “Okay. Okay. I’ll tell you anything – please! Just let him up.”
"Ok, so, you know my girlfriend, MJ?"
“I’m in my workshop, where I work, Captain Melodrama. If you’re all going to call in the crisis negotiators every time I have a casual Tuesday night—”
Steve fought back a grimace, concentrating on slowing down his shallow breaths. His newly released muscles were screaming in protest, but only along one side of his body: his left arm was recoiling like a snapped rubber band, while his right only prickled with pins and needles. He knew what that meant about the dull pressure in his torso and the black borders at the edges of his vision.
“I wouldn’t let him hurt himself either,” Steve insisted.
“Tony?” Natasha’s voice echoed down the hall, and Tony whipped his head around to watch her run into view.
Clint and Natasha shared one of their looks – the kind that made it seem like they were speaking Morse code with their pupils.
“So maybe he shoots himself,” Natasha shrugged.
“What was more likely, my ass,” Tony had grumbled, earning a pat on the shoulder and a “you tell him, man,” from Clint.
“I’ll do my best,” Tony repeated, feeling only a little foolish as he lifted the lid and peered inside.
“The devil take Lord Hammer,” Tony grumbled, his eyes still lingering over the tense lines of Steve’s shoulders. “That a man so bereft of any higher faculties should be so blessed in material goods is a feature of the divine order that surpasses human understanding.”
On seeing the blood on Natasha’s face, Bruce let out a growl that sounded distinctly Hulk-y, his whole face going green in a flash. Natasha made her way toward him, speaking calmly as she approached.
“Deal the cards, Nat,” Tony said, taking care to wet the tips of his fingers with his tongue before he plucked his off the table.
But they were already so close together, their knees almost knocking against each other each time they shifted. If he touched Tony now, with the gash from Tony’s fight with the Hulk still sharp and angry on his cheek, Steve knew he would risk communicating far more feelings than just reassurance.
“Let me go!” Clint yelled, pretending to grapple with Natasha’s arm. “Let me go!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I made them mention the donations in the announcement because I hoped someone would come,” he reiterated. “I watched Rogers out-stubborn asthma attacks, scarlet fever, and half the assholes east of Manhattan, and no one was ever able to tell me why everything that’s left of him can fit in this box.”
Training his gun on the agent who was padding toward Tony from behind, Steve stepped onto the roof.
Bruce’s voice was slightly distorted by the walls of his blanket fort, which Steve had suggested building as an anti-Hulking measure when the first wave of ornaments flew off their branches and into attack formation. So far the strategy had proved successful, with only one close call after Thor almost collided with the fort during an enthusiastic mid-air tackle.
“We’ll need to strategize about the press conference next week,” he tried, proud of how casual his voice sounded.
“God, you scare me,” he whispered.
"No." Tony dug his phone out and checked the time. "Yes."
"Hey, Dr. Stark. How are you feeling?"
“I didn’t know you were back in the field,” Natasha said.
“I’ll come collect you later,” Ty said, giving Tony a wink that made his stomach turn over, “when you’re in a better mood.”
“I’m here and I brought the files you asked for,” Steve said evenly. “So let Stark go, and we can do this the easy way.”
“I’m sorry, Tony,” Steve said.
“Oh yeah? Do tell.”
“I haven’t,” Steve said, his frown deepening.
“Nat, this isn’t your fault.”
He broke off, and no painkiller in the world could touch what it felt like to see Steve’s last effort to hold himself together crumple.
In eight months of fighting with the Avengers, Steve had learned that his teammates’ post-battle antics were a barometer for how much pressure they’d absorbed during the fight. On a good day, Clint would complain to an eye-rolling Natasha about his urgent, unappreciated need for to-go pancakes while she pretended not to fuss over the bullet graze on his shoulder. Thor and Tony would concoct plans for their victory celebrations, using the opportunity to retell outrageous party stories in what Steve suspected was a private game of “two truths and at least a dozen lies.” On a really good day, Bruce wouldn’t be there at all.
And whether it was because his brain hadn't quite kicked back into gear or because he'd watched a fatal bullet wound disappear from his stomach hours earlier, Tony did something that had never felt possible before. He stepped forward to close the distance between them, pulling Steve forward by the front of his shirt until they both stood under the arch.
“That is some pretty smug psychoanalyzing coming from you,” he said. “I’ve seen your military records, Rogers: multiple promotions, service with distinction, wounded during a high-profile rescue operation that pulled a dozen soldiers out of enemy hands. When you got discharged, you were getting recruited by West Point, Academi, Halliburton. You could have waltzed your way into a position at any private security firm in the country, and instead you ran straight toward the first job you could find that would allow you to take bullets professionally – the only career that would take your pathological need to be the first one in the line of fire and turn it into a job responsibility.”
his father’s work on unidentified objects and unexplained phenomenon but in
“No need to thank me, Romanov. I’m just the messenger,” he replied. “I’ll be in touch personally if we find anything else. Some members of my team were pretty shaken up by what happened in New Jersey, and I want to take care of these guys as soon as we can.”
“Why not just come after me then?”
He had been waving the pudding cup accusingly as he spoke, and Steve reached out to take it, almost succeeding in suppressing another wince at the renewed tug against his side. Tony growled in annoyance, moving Steve’s outstretched arm back against his chest and tucking the pudding cup in his hand.
“Does it?” he asked mildly.
“Oh yes,” she murmured, “the dreamy fellow with the fussy goatee and the movie-star eyes.”
James took a deep breath and let it out slowly. "Tony… I'm not who I said I am.
“Yeah, and how’d you get him to come into the house with you?” Clint asked knowingly. “You steal his keys?”
The reactions were subtle, and Tony might have missed them if he hadn’t been looking. Skye’s eyes flickered to the image of redacted files Tony’s phone was displaying, and she skimmed nervously over the visible words before returning her gaze to Fury. May barely moved a muscle, but the corners of her mouth tightened ever so slightly, from cool to grim. Fury turned to face Tony, one hand slipping just slightly toward the holster on his hip. Steve must have seen that last movement too, because he shifted the angle of his chair, putting himself more firmly between Fury and Tony.
The only option left was to hit something.
“Where the fuck is he?” Tony demanded, twisting in Natasha’s grip and searching frantically around the hospital room where he now found himself. Clint was rising from a seat by the door and coming over to help Natasha keep Tony in bed. Rhodey was rushing over with a cup of water. But there was no Steve.
Tony folded early this time around, partially because Clint was squinting one eye in a way that meant he was going to bet big, and partially because Tony wanted to watch Steve’s face as he checked the bet. Tony had learned more and more of Steve’s tells over the years: the vertical furrow between his brows that meant he was worried, the crossed arms that meant he was remembering something he couldn’t talk about. The data set grew regularly these days, filling out with the little signs that let Tony predict how Steve was going to move and what he was going to need. But still, for the life of him, Tony could not read whatever it was that flashed across Steve’s face in moments like this one, when he glanced up at Tony as he thumbed the edge of his cards. The expression came and went, leaving a sensation like a hot coal in the center of Tony’s chest.
again.”
,” Rhodey said.
"It doesn't take much." Grant peered close, frowning. "Hey, you still look a little pale. You headed to campus?"
Tony raised an eyebrow. "Ye-up. That's Darcy, alright."
: it’s all been pretty much downhill from there.”
“There’s no time to remove it. It’s too close to the brain stem.”
Steve let out a slow breath as the sound of his partner’s voice settled around him, his feet feeling steadier as he turned them toward Tony. After all, what other choice did Steve have but to see this through? Either he was letting his nerves get the better of him – in which case there was no harm in staying until Tony had satisfied his curiosity – or there really was something else going on here (maybe some local kids playing a prank) – in which case he had to stay to ensure that Tony had backup.
He knew that Steve felt the nerves too: not only because he was sitting with his arms bunched across his chest like loaded springs, but also because he had turned down an offer to spar with Natasha and elected to work through several punching bags instead – something he only did when he was afraid he didn’t have enough focus to keep from hurting someone.
“Look we’ve all taken a few hits lately,” he pushed on. “But it isn’t all on you. That’s what you told me, right? Let the team take some of the punches with you. And you know what else that means: you’ve got backup wherever you go. You don’t have to fight for SHIELD if you don’t want to.”
“Shit,” Tony swore, louder than was probably merited. “JARVIS you’re a traitor, and I’m scrapping your programing for this insurrection.” He grabbed the phone and swiped angrily to answer.
Steve reached out instinctively to steady Tony’s elbow, and Tony shook him off irritably.
Tony was lowering him to the ground as he spoke, one hand cradling the back of his head.
“I don’t need a doctor,” Steve assured Happy.
They passed seventeen floors in determined silence before it happened. First the lights flickered, then the cabin walls shuddered, and then the whole elevator hitched to a stop, the cables emitting a faint squeal of protest.
"Oh." Dr. Grant stood, and Tony instantly felt bad. He'd been expecting him to snap back, not concede. "I'll just spray it down for you." He cleaned the seat then stepped back a bit, still hovering, and Tony had no choice but to adjust the weight down a truly embarrassing number of notches and take a seat.
“Yeah, so I’m just going to…go be over there now,” Tony said, in what he felt was an impressive display of self-possession for someone staring at the retreating ass of Steve Rogers.
Steve obliged, turning off the engine to his own car and sliding in through the passenger door of Tony’s. He must still have been carrying some tension from defusing the crock-pot riot that had threatened to break out in the Macy’s cookware section, because the muscles in his shoulders began to unknot as he settled into the leather seat next to Tony.
“Uh, about that,” Steve replied, the corner of his lips tugging up into a small smile. “I should warn you that I
“I love you too!” Tony yelled as he flipped the switch, and then all the anguish in his voice was pulsing through Steve’s body until everything went black.
For reasons Tony didn’t want to examine too closely, the first person his eyes found was Dr. Grant, who gave the photo the briefest of looks before staring back down at the notebook in his lap. His face looked pinched, and Tony resisted the urge to start grinding his teeth, already anticipating Grant’s four-point objection to the way Tony had framed the gendering of historiography.
“I’m okay,” she replied with a sob. “The armor – he got me out. Search and rescue just came, and they found his phone. But Steve. The whole house is gone. God. He was still inside, and he tried to call the armor back, but I don’t know – I don’t know if he made it.”
“Well, shit,” he muttered out loud, staring back and forth between Rogers’ ID card and the utterly blank search results. “What the fuck?”
“Tony, for the twentieth time, I am not knocking you out until the news comes,” Steve replied patiently.
“It’s going to be okay, Tony,” he promised, trying to will some calm into his voice as Tony heaved air back into his lungs. “I’m going to tell them.” Tony shook his head violently, trying to shout something behind the tape that sounded suspiciously like, “shut up, you idiot,” but Steve pressed on. He looked back and forth between Rumlow and Ward, trying to hold their gaze. “I know where Fury is, and I can take you to him. But you’ve got to let Tony go first. Let him go, and I’ll take you right to the Director. You have my word.”
“Are you cutting me from the Thanksgiving roster, Rogers?” Tony asked. “Just because
“Not about the door, no,” Steve admitted with a small smile. “You would have made the same call if you’d been on the other side. No, I’m sorry I didn’t tell you about Bucky. I’ve spent months trying to figure out how I screwed things up so badly. At first I thought I was protecting him from people who wouldn’t understand – or protecting you from having to learn something so horrible. But I was really just protecting myself. I never figured out how to make it mean less to me – what you thought about me, how you felt. I was so afraid of hurting you or losing you that I ended up doing both.”
“A car accident, Tony,” Steve answered finally, jaw clenching around the words. “God. All the time we spend training for the field, trying to prepare for every possible scenario, and then a car accident. We could take down half of HYDRA in a week, and still all it would take is one asshole missing a stop sign.”
Tony leaned forward on the edge of his bed, wondering vaguely what stage of “romantically fucked” it was when you felt like someone had filled your chest with a flock of electrified hummingbirds.
“They’re everywhere,” Coulson confirmed grimly. “There are incursions at the Triskelion, the Academy, the Hub. I started flying to New York as soon as I heard.”
“We’ve got evac incoming,” Tony said, his free hand moving over Steve’s arms and shoulders as he scanned for the worst injuries. “What’s your status, Cap?”
"I know, but at least this way I can tell myself I'm trying to teach you a valuable life lesson about procrastination."
“…the use of ‘he’ in this section seems unnecessary and unclear,” Grant had continued, “and I think we should consider revising these paragraphs to make the language more inclusive.”
“You’re okay,” Steve said, needing confirmation.
“Third-party feeds?” Natasha asked, and of course she would zero in on the one thing Tony had hoped to breeze by. “Who else is looking?”
situation’s going on back home. But Banner’s moving in this week, and I’m going to work on the spy kids. I could use a man of your talents in the Tower to protect me if Banner hulks out when we run out of tortilla chips – or if Romanov decides to stab me in the neck with another needle.”
“Yes,” he said. “I think that’s the best tactical plan.”
“Well, the joke’s on him, darling,” Tony said, running his thumb up and down along the edge of Steve’s hand. “Because I’m going to make sure you get every last drop out of this ‘til death do us part’ business. I swear to God. I’m going to get you thrown out of so many government offices: you’ll feel like you’re flunking the draft again.”
----------------
"Mhm."
“Shoot, sorry,” Grant muttered, digging his cell phone out of his pocket. “I have to take this. I uh - your talk was really something, Dr. Stark. Thanks for finding those things.”
“He’s early career, Tony,” Bruce pointed out. “You remember what we were like when we got hired: job market behind us, plenty of postdoc work still in the pipeline. No one had ever invited us to a workshop on ‘models for assessing assessment models,’ and so we’d never known true despair. A lot of things looked different then.”
“Dockers, Rhodey,” he explained. “The man is wearing Dockers.”
“I’m going to take care of it,” Steve said, all the feelings that could slip past the ice concentrated into that one promise. “Tony is a fighter, Pepper, and if there’s any way – I’m going to get him back.”
Tony swore under his breath. This could not be happening. What the hell was
"Tony,” he said, wrapping his free hand gently around the back of Tony’s arm, “we’ll find out who’s doing this.”
Natasha cleared her throat loudly, and Tony almost jumped. Steve blinked back at him, looking as disoriented as Tony felt. Judging by her smirk, Natasha seemed to have noticed their reactions.
“If you’re worried about whether I’ll be mission ready, Cap, there’s no need. I aced all my freshmen finals with nothing but a bottle of Lipvitan-D, a bag of Funyuns, and adrenaline – and I hadn’t even set foot in two out of the five classes. That razor-thin line between ‘oh my God, call the MacArthur Foundation’ and a total fucking mess? That’s my sweet spot: that’s where I live. So if Fury has concerns –”
“Well, okay,” Tony tried again, plucking at the collar of Steve’s tee-shirt, “if you won’t knock me out, maybe you could…you know…knock me out.”
Tony was about to ask Steve how he could possibly make the situation with Ty
“Damage was contained to this floor, and the rest of the building is being evacuated,” JARVIS responded. “I have alerted Agent Barton, who was already on his way back to the Tower after receiving the code from SHIELD. Dr. Banner and Thor are en route from the lab. I believe that Dr. Banner is –”
He let Natasha move slowly to her feet before he got up to take in the scene: the charred husk of the couch, the twisted hunk that had been Tony’s flat-screen television, three smoldering chairs still being doused by the automatic sprinklers, and a gaping hole where the coffee table had been. Steve felt bile rising sharply in his throat as he realized HYDRA had violated two of Tony’s homes – two places where he was supposed to be safe.
again was going to distract them, and more because they’d gotten used to filling tense moments with the sounds of each other’s voices.
He took advantage of James’ focus on coffee preparations to scan the shelves of his office. They were a bit on the bare side - Tony supposed that traveling light must come with the territory for a short-term position - but James had made the most with a minimalist style, including a few gorgeous modernist prints, a collection of poetry from the Harlem Renaissance, and what looked like a first edition of
Rumlow yanked Tony’s head backward, and he came up spluttering and gasping. Steve could feel his own muscles constricting in agony and rage, but he forced himself to concentrate his reaction into a controlled jerk of his right arm, which snapped the restraint on his bicep without revealing his free wrist.
“So,” Tony breathed when they finally broke apart, “if I understand the story correctly: you cobbled together discarded armor, snuck into the ranks of my guard, and then threw yourself in front a sword rather than tell me you loved me.”
Tony couldn’t help but punctuate the last word with a triumphant wave of his arms: a gesture that, judging from the long sigh on the other end of the line, Rhodey could picture without seeing it.
“Oh, I’m starting to want you to make me,” he said, leaning back against the railing so that his hips jutted ever so slightly forward.
“That’s classified,” Fury said stonily.
Steve was still hovering in the hallway, his stance turned halfway toward Tony and half back toward the gym. Tony suppressed the urge to check the expression in his face again and continued addressing his communication to the rest of the group.
“Gear upgrades wait for no man, Rogers,” Tony demurred, attempting to emphasize his point with a wave of one hand and almost knocking over the glass of water that Steve had put in front of him. “I needed to get the new belt ready in case we got another call. While I admit that having those tight, spangly pants of yours start to slip in the middle of a battle would probably be a pretty effective distraction for a certain class of villain, I think it’s best for your public image to leave a little bit to the imagination, if you know what I mean.”
“We’re all still here, you know,” Clint pointed out.
“Listen, Cap,” Clint replied, waving a dolma at him, “if you’re going to apologize for anything, apologize for the purgatory potatoes you tricked me into making last year. At least this year we have food that doesn’t have the texture of fast-drying cement.”
“Would you like to -” James hesitated, “sit down for a while? See if we can wait it out? I wouldn’t mind the company.”
Steve shifted his weight marginally before continuing, and Tony added to his list of “frankly heroic feats of self-control” by not pointing out how heroically self-controlled he was being.
“People could be hurt,” Tony shouted up at him furiously.
"I barely hit the gas…" Tony stared down at his own feet.
Something twisted quickly across Tony’s features and then disappeared, but he made no other move to respond. The quiet stretched out between them, and Steve felt a flush creep up the back of his neck. Shit. Natasha had bet him fifty dollars that he wasn’t going to be able to keep his feelings secret for longer than a week, and here he was blowing it already, just three days after he'd realized he was falling for Tony Stark.
“Open the door,” Tony snapped. He drew his gun, more out of frustration than out of any sense that it would be an effective motivator.
“Yeah, on second thought, no,” Clint said, hitting the button for the next floor.
“No, it’s not fine, you fucking idiot. That’s your arm — that’s
“It would appear so. Skye ran the video through voice and face recognition searches, and she thinks he’s an English actor. Trevor Slattery. No priors and no hits in the SHIELD databases.”
“Tony, you have to relax, man,” Rhodey said. “If you don’t get your heart rate down, they’re going to call a code, and Steve –”
“I mean, feel free to take an ogle to go,” Tony continued, his voice slowing to a teasing drawl. “It may shock you to hear this, but I don’t mind the attention. Go ahead: get your fill. I’d say ‘no sweat,’ but you’re clearly past that point.”
“Cap, Wonder Twins,” Tony replied. “Barton, glad to see the minor villains of the world find your face as punchable as we do.”
“Did you notice the clock downstairs is keeping perfect time?” Steve asked.
“Bodies?” she asked, both eyebrows shooting up this time. “What bodies?”
He looked behind him as he bolted full speed for the north stair, fully expecting James to be right behind him, but he wasn't. James was also running, but not behind Tony,
“No!” Steve yelled, and Tony froze instinctively, turning toward the sound of Steve’s voice.
Clint looked up finally and locked eyes with Coulson. His muscles were tensed, his weight forward on the balls of his feet, a stance Steve recognized from watching hours of post-battle footage: the last moment of balance before Clint decided whether to jump.
“You should have seen him getting a drink from Nat at your party,” Steve chuckled. “She was pulling out all the stops. He looked like he’d been hit by a bus.”
Almost before Sitwell was down, Tony was lurching back toward Steve. He straddled Steve’s waist, crossing his hands over Steve’s chest and heaving downward.
“Turn off your comms,” he said urgently.
James fingers twitched on his lap, and Tony looked up to see all the colour had drained out of his face.
“I know you can, Tony,” Steve said firmly, arranging himself on the chair next to the cart. He pulled off one of his gloves and put it between his teeth to stop himself from biting his tongue when the current hit, and then he let Tony position his bare hand carefully in the tub.
“Did you take my car keys?” Steve asked.
“I could have lived without that part,” Steve allowed.
"You’re probably right about that,” Steve replied, stroking the side of his thumb over Tony’s ribs. “I don’t know what it would feel like to be sure I’d done enough. But I’m sure about what you’ll do. I know how hard you’ll fight. It’s something that scares me, because no matter what happens today, the fight won’t be over. And we don’t know how much it’s going to cost us to keep going. But at the end of the day, I know this team is going to take care of each other. I don’t always trust myself, and I definitely don’t trust the world out there, but I trust that. I trust us.”
Tony traced his fingers along the still-unfamiliar contours of Steve’s beard and brushed a stray lock of his hair back from his face. The ends were still the tiniest bit damp, and Tony tried to suppress a shudder at the memory of ice water working its way up Steve’s body.
“Sorry if I scared you,” she confirmed, detaching herself from the doorframe with a graceful curl of her shoulders. “I sleepwalk: the most unbelievable nightmares. Then again,” she stepped closer, looking up at him coyly, “maybe it’s you who should be apologizing. After all, you’re the one who has a gun pointed at me in my own house.”
getting roped into more service right now. This year I’m saying ‘no’ to everything that doesn’t help get this book written, and I’ve got a hot date with manuscript A188.3 at 5:00 to prove it.”
His train of thought was interrupted by the ding of the elevator. The doors slid open, and Steve froze at the sight of Tony and Clint standing on the other side, caught up in a debate about whether
“If you didn’t want us to use corporate money to get tacos, you shouldn’t have hired Nat as your personal assistant,” Clint pointed out sagely. “Which reminds me: celebratory margaritas are on you tonight, and I think Coulson and his team are joining.”
Fury was standing at the head of the table, flanked by two women Tony had never seen before. The younger of the two was busily at work on a laptop, but she looked up and let out a small “Oh my God” when she saw them enter. The other woman had more of the dress and demeanor of a SHIELD agent. As she turned to face them, her crossed arms and impassive expression made Tony suddenly think about the thin metal lids that sealed the containers of nitroglycerin in his workshop.
“Tony, open the door!” Steve shouted, pounding on the outside of the door next to the fireplace.
He'd lost track of Grant in the parking lot, since their spots were on opposite ends of campus, but he knew where Grant’s office was, and he decided not to ghost on their date. Uh. Arrangement. Agreement. Thing.
But he knew he couldn’t say any of those things and mean them if he didn’t say this first.
Clint gave him the finger, and Natasha rolled her eyes. But Steve hummed non-committally in a way that sent off an instant warning bell in Tony’s mind.
“We all are,” Wanda added. “If Clint had told me being an Avenger would involve watching so much sad
“It was so obvious he wanted to say something, but he was holding himself back. Why?” Tony demanded, helping himself to one of the riper-looking melon chunks from Bruce’s plate. “The guy’s probably got ‘More of a Comment than a Question’ tattooed on his ridiculously oversized biceps, but he just sits there in silence? Maybe
He was about to leap to his feet, ready to make a run for Tony’s position, but before he could move, Tony was there in front of him, setting the first HYDRA agent’s gun on the ground so that he could assess the wound in Steve’s side.
“I’m ruining everything!” Tony complained loudly into Pepper’s ear, causing her to wince and give him a shove on the shoulder.
But he could only hold the team on pause for so long waiting for another shoe to belatedly drop. Tony was already behind on his work for Stark Industries. Thor and Bruce had never gotten to finish their research visit to New Mexico. And Fury wanted Steve, Natasha, and Clint for other missions. So Steve tried to put the unanswered questions to the back of his mind.
for ten goddamn minutes - just so someone else can get shot instead of me.”
“You’re the ones who attacked him,” Steve said, allowing some of the desperation he was suppressing to creep into his voice. “The wreck was all over the news. You killed him.”
They made their way across the library a second time, and Tony opened the door on the other side to reveal a walkway, books, Persian carpets, and a hole in the floor.
“Trust me, if this were an interrogation, you would have no idea. And it’s sweet of you to think I’d need one to figure this out. No, Steve. This is an intervention. We all want this to work out for you kids – especially because all the mooning around is driving everyone nuts.”
“It’s you,” Steve said. “You’re the woman I saw downstairs.”
“It’s a little offensive that you’re being so reasonable about this,” Tony muttered to Steve. “This is a horrible day, and I don’t know what you have to feel so irritatingly peaceful about.”
Steve’s chest tightened, and he had to look down and grip the handlebars for a moment to ground himself. It wasn’t the phone really, though that was nice enough. When Steve grew up, there hadn’t even been enough money or copper wiring for their building to put in a party line. But more than that it was the warmth he could see in his own eyes in the photograph – the promise that he could call home and someone would answer.
Thank you so much to everyone who has been reading and sharing the world of this fic! I can't tell you how much warmth it's brought me, and I hope you're finding a little bit too. I'd love to hear what you think!
“Tony,” Steve sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose, “please tell me you did not call me out here on the night before Christmas to go ghostbusting.”
“I’m not alone,” Tony retorted. “I’m here with my partner.”
He paused to consider the half-eaten bowl of Rocky Road that was partially covering his photocopy of Dum Dum Dugan’s enlistment form.
Clenching his jaw against the scalding pressure in his torso, Steve hauled himself over the edge and started down the stairs. It was agonizingly slow going – the slippery surface beneath him a reminder that he was losing blood with every heave forward – and so when a record-player somewhere in the sitting room crackled to life and started playing “I’ll Be Home for Christmas,” Steve swore violently.
It was, however, the first time that Steve had encountered Tony sleeping in a way that left him quite so open to the element of surprise. Steve slung his gym towel around his neck, moved carefully into a spotting formation, and then called out the words “expense reports” in a clear, slightly urgent tone.
Not that it was Tony’s fault, Steve allowed.
The Avengers didn’t have the best track record with Thanksgiving. The first time the dinner had ended in disaster, it had been Steve’s fault. One rainy fall Sunday, just months after the Battle of New York, Steve had been picking at a bowl of mint-chip ice cream, feeling tired of getting looks of sympathy about the holidays and absolutely exhausted by feeling sorry for himself. If Bruce and Clint hadn’t chosen that particular afternoon to ask him whether there was anything special he wanted for Thanksgiving – raising the question with just enough gentleness to make Steve’s jaw tighten – he probably would have said, “I’m a sweet potatoes guy” and left it at that.
“You’re messing with our heads,” Tony replied, keeping his gun trained on the other man’s chest. “And I don’t know if this whole ‘House of Usher’ vibe you’ve got going on is a cover for something more sinister – or if someone’s been experimenting with some very dangerous imaging technology – but you need to tell me what the
“Do you think we could save this conversation until after I’ve had my hospital pudding?” Steve asked, trying to massage one of his temples and wincing as the movement pulled at the stitches running up his side.
?” Steve asked.
Steve reached up and clasped Tony’s hand. He laced their fingers together and then brushed his lips gently across the places where Tony’s knuckles had cracked against the door.
Sitwell’s eyes had been widening gradually as Tony spoke, and he seemed momentarily frozen with indecision. Then the sounds of an explosion erupted from somewhere nearby, rattling the windows and creating what Sitwell must have thought was an opportunity. Sitwell’s free hand darted toward his hip, and Tony fired.
“It’s really creepy when she does that,” Coulson observed. “And my team makes their own decisions, Stark. But SHIELD isn’t done with me yet. I’ve made messes I need to clean up.”
“I won’t bring them Fury,” Steve continued, “Coulson, whether you give me the files or not is up to you. But I’m going.”
“How bad is the damage?” Natasha asked. “Anyone else hit?”
Steve only looked away when he could no longer make out their retreating forms. He was treading water now as the hallway continued to flood. He supposed his best bet was to swim toward the lower levels and try to find the site of the blast. If it was on the near side of the rig, there might be a chance he could make it to the surface.
“Oh good, it’s not just going to be non-verbal.”
“Don’t even try to pull the aww-shucks, old-timer card with me, Cap,” Tony fired back. “Your joints only qualify as old if you count the 70-year ice pack you applied. Your ligaments are probably sprier than ever after decades of RICE.”
When Tony showed up at the compound after the mission in Lagos, it was the first time he had seen Steve since the battle with Ultron. In fact, the two of them had barely spoken since the night at Barton’s, when Tony had finally gotten up the courage to make a pass at Steve, and Steve had revealed he’d been sitting on the news that Barnes killed Tony’s parents for almost a year. Other than a second round of yelling at each other about Tony’s decision to animate Vision and a professional attempt at battlefield communication during the fighting in Sokovia, Tony had kept his mouth shut, and Steve had kept his distance. As soon as they’d verified that all of Ultron’s bodies had been wiped out, Tony had flown to Malibu and asked Pepper to pack his schedule with work trips so he would have no reason to be in New York while the Avengers moved out of the Tower and into the new upstate training facility.
He’d known he was in trouble for a while, of course. If it hadn’t been clear the first time Tony raised the faceplate of his armor to reveal the kind of deep, expressive brown eyes that had always made Steve go weak at the knees, it was painfully apparent by the time those same eyes looked up at him from a rubble-strewn street in New York. But Steve had told himself he was going to tackle the situation head-on: ask Tony out on a date; use full sentences and appropriate eye contact; and do it while Tony was awake this time.
It was on one of these occasions that they got a visit from Agent Ward.
Natasha hummed noncommittally.
“Let go,” Tony said, trying to twist his arm out of Ty’s grip and finding it surprisingly, almost tear-inducingly hard to move Ty’s fist.
“What’s wrong?” Tony asked quickly, and in an instant he had one hand pressed against Steve’s forehead and another clasping his wrist. “Do you need the doctor?”
“Sorry to disappoint,” Steve replied. Tony had leaned in to adjust the collar of Steve’s shirt, and Steve let his hands drop to Tony’s waist, feeling just daring enough to sweep a soft circle across the crest of Tony’s hips. “But you got scooped by a hair-and-makeup artist for the USO tour.”
“Yeah, sure,” Tony allowed, waving one hand vaguely in acknowledgment. “Ty’s a massive douchebag: no argument here. But then again, I sure know how to pick ‘em, right?”
Steve grimaced as he spun the cup slowly in his hands.
Somewhere behind him, Tony swore furiously, and then the rifle was being ripped away. Steve looked around to see Tony slam the butt of the gun into the top of the attacker’s head – leaving the man Steve recognized vaguely as Jasper Sitwell to collapse in a heap – and then he was slumping down the wall behind him, his torso on fire with agony.
Right, family. Tony cut sideways across the page in search of “Carter” and started running through the names of Peggy’s close relatives, popping each one into Google to check for any time spent at Brooklyn Community College: brother, Michael (no), husband, Daniel (no), great-niece, Sharon (no), daughter, Ana (no), son, Steven –
“You’ve heard of them,” Tony said in a stunned voice. “Wait, they actually exist, and you
“Tony, I could never –”
“Didn’t I?” Tony mused. “How forgetful of me.”
“Hey, Tony,” Steve sighed.
“What are you doing?” Tony demanded, his own gun snapping from Natasha to his partner automatically.
Steve folded his arms across his chest and hunched his shoulders – a posture that suddenly reminded Tony of the first time Steve had tried to program the TIVO at the Tower, when he had only ended up catching half of the documentary on the Apollo missions that Tony had said he wanted to watch.
“What do you need?” he asked softly, his hands hovering near Tony’s elbows but keeping a careful foot of distance.
"Out of
“What? No. Absolutely not. I am not a young man, Rogers. You had one opportunity to have a go at me and you used it to knock me down more times than the lead singer of a mid-nineties, one-hit-wonder, indie band that you’ve definitely never heard of – seriously, if I actually said their name right now, you’d think I was mumbling random syllables just to screw with you.”
“The first meeting today is with a delegation of farmers from the south,” Steve announced, turning to retrieve a stack of ledgers from an oak cabinet in the corner of the room. “They are petitioning for relief from their taxes, which have just been raised by Lord Hammer.”
“Giving SHIELD the supernatural strong-arm,” Tony said to Thor. “A bit surprising after how many times you volunteered for the ‘trust fall’ portion of Hill’s team-building exercises.”
“You shot me!” Steve protested.
“I have a naturally retentive mind,” Tony replied archly. “I acquire knowledge almost involuntarily — it’s a curse I have to bear.”
“It’s a deal,” he promised.
“Ward’s here – the specialist from May’s team,” Natasha said. “They have some new intel they want us to look at.”
Clint had just stepped off the helicopter and begun to make his way in Steve’s direction, but he stopped when May called out his name. Clint turned to look at her, and Steve could see his posture go rigid when she pulled him into a hug. Over her shoulder, Clint’s face looked startled, then alert. As she pulled back, his eyes scanned rapidly across her face, and then his tense expression shifted into a carefully harmless grin.
“So it’s uh...a game?” Grant was saying, managing to sound both confused and encouraging - and he might as well be lathering himself with honey really, because that combination was absolutely irresistible to a pedant.
beside it. Tony caught a glimpse of what was written on the top of the page and blanched.
“It’s what I was literally made to do, Tony,” Steve shrugged. “I’m government funded and Stark engineered.” He winced. “Sorry, I didn’t mean –”
Tony grasped Steve’s forearms, whether to steady himself or out of surprise, Steve couldn’t tell. But he didn’t let go; so when Steve stood up from his lunge, he found that he was looking down into Tony’s eyes from very close range, his fingers still pressed against the slivers of skin exposed at the hem of Tony’s shirt.
“I think the other interested party leaked me the footage on purpose,” Tony admitted, and Natasha quirked an eyebrow. “I dig some digging, and it turns out he’s from Sokovia. His name is Zemo, and he lost some family when my homicidal bot-child dropped a city on them. The report on the incident had been recently published – planted, really. Zemo wanted me to find out. That’s how I realized he was leaving me a trail: he clearly wants a showdown of some kind.”
“Has he told you about Sergeant Barnes?” she pressed. “Because he told me. And
“So what cat has got your normally unstoppable tongue, Barton?” Tony asked Clint as soon as the team was alone. Clint glared at him for a moment, looking as if he were considering a flat denial, but then he sighed, his shoulders sagging.
would work?” he asked as the movie started.
“I know, right?” Tony grinned, setting his new bot on the kitchen table triumphantly. “It scans the pumpkin wall for structural integrity and irregularities in surface texture, and then it matches the results against a database of classic and contemporary art.”
Unless Dr. Grant
“Roger that. Meet you at the secret lair,” Tony affirmed. He turned to where Steve was still trying to get through to Barnes. Unfortunately, Steve’s pleading seemed to have rather increased than decreased the fury of the Winter Soldier’s attack. Tony winced when Steve took a punch to the head and then figured that turnabout was fair play.
“There was some arm twisting involved,” May replied dryly.
"Why not just get a large?"
They were alone now, surveying the sedimentary damage done by the bomb and the margarita night. The rest of the team had gone off to bed a few minutes ago – a planned retreat, Steve would guess, judging by the glare Natasha had given Clint when he tried to linger over the last of the queso dip. Tony was standing in front of the remains of his flat-screen TV, surrounded by scorched carpet and discarded Solo cups, but his eyes were warm, and the glow of the arc reactor was just visible through his tee-shirt, and Steve had never found any sight more stunning.
“Oh someone’s getting lucky, for sure,” Clint smirked, and then he ducked — almost in time to avoid a projectile potato chip from Natasha.
“Is this a test?” a sophomore named Miles asked carefully.
There was something more, he thought – something else he had meant to add. But the ground was rushing up to meet the soft sensation ghosting across his forehead, and he couldn’t bring the words to mind.
Suddenly the gun was falling toward the ground, and Steve reached instinctively to catch it. By the time his hand closed around the cold metal, Natasha was gone.
Grant was still loading his notebooks into a worn leather bag as Tony approached, and Tony found himself idly noticing the flex of Grant’s forearms underneath his rolled shirt cuffs. Luckily, his sunglasses concealed the angle of his gaze when Grant looked up to meet his eyes.
“No comment.”
“Do you?” Steve asked, the pale skin on his cheeks flushing furiously. “Need help I mean?”
Clint swayed visibly enough that Natasha caught his arm. Her own face had gone very still and pale, the red line of blood on her cheek standing out in stark contrast to the set line of her jaw.
James flew at two of the men, catching them both across the chest and knocking them down. But instead of swarming him, the rest of the group pushed right past and took off towards Tony.
“Aww man,” Clint sighed, “but tots and shots.”
“Surviving?” Tony asked, a small smile tugging at his lips.
“Ah, Mr. Stark,” Vision greeted him, breezing into the room through the wall to the gym, “you are here to check on Captain Rogers, I presume.”
"You said it didn't need to be complete."
the military’s argument that they should be trusted with more Stark tech, unless –”
“Hey,” Bruce muttered, “I waited in line for those.”
More and more, Tony would banter with Steve too – even call him over to lift something or to test a piece of equipment. That’s how Steve learned that as bewilderingly fast as Tony’s words moved, his mind moved faster. Watching Tony work was like being on his bike: the more the machine accelerated, the quicker his instincts would get.
“You injected yourself with a serum suppressant and let them walk you straight into an unmarked van!” Tony hissed.
James snorted, then seemed to think better of it, and he quickly schooled his expression into something more neutral. “I’m on call as a volunteer firefighter,” he explained, his voice taking on the even carefulness Tony had first noticed at the YMCA.
“It’s fine, Tony,” Steve replied, his smile broadening
“I’m on it, Cap,” he acknowledged, and shot upwards to provide air support. Steve jumped into the back of the chopper and yelled a tense “go” to May in the pilot’s seat.
“I was following up on a tip you gave me, actually,” Tony replied. “Last night? Before you got your mysterious phone call and climbed into a shady van with a bunch of Men-in-Black cosplayers? You asked me if I had come across any references to a shield.”
you’ve done with my partner.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve said with a sigh. “I know it was selfish of me to tell you that way. I shouldn’t have pressured you to say – I know you can’t feel the same way. But it doesn’t have to change anything. I mean, I can’t change how I feel, but I hope we can still be friends –”
And without waiting for a reply, Tony snapped his faceplate down and took off.
Steve looked over at Tony, and he had just enough time to watch the realization dawn in Tony’s eyes before he had to move.
“Wow,” Tony breathed, uncovering his face to look up at Steve.
Tony was relieved when he heard the cafeteria doors close behind him again. Grant could go back to charming the entire student body and faculty with his stupid hair and his
“Everything okay?”
Steve was just winding up for an eye roll when a muffled thumping noise issued from the floorboards to their right. Tony moved toward it, and Steve fell in behind him, one hand hovering near Tony’s arm as he scanned automatically for anything that looked like an explosive. But there was no detectable force causing the wood below them to heave upward. In fact, it looked for all the world like the something underneath was fighting to get out.
“I don’t know,” Steve responded, shaking his head against the itching sensation on the back of his neck – like seeing a face that should be familiar but being unable to remember the name.
(last week a group of Stark Industries shareholders had been treated to the first thirty seconds of “I’m Every Woman” when Steve had forgotten to silence his phone before a Board meeting), but the corner of his mouth was tugging upward as he slid right to cut off a dramatic key change.
“Got some energy to burn, Cap?” he asked. Then he caught his lower lip lightly between his teeth, and just like that, Steve’s heart was hammering so hard he could feel his pulse in his fingers.
The late end to the meeting meant even more crosstown traffic, and by the time Tony made it to the Houghton, he only had time to call up one box from special collections. He got ready at one of the long tables while he waited for the materials, running his hand through his hair to stop himself from drumming his pen against the table. Goddamn library etiquette.
“Ahhh yes,” Tony acknowledged, his mind stalling out briefly at the image of the small green branch hanging almost over Steve’s head. “That was a gag gift from Rhodey. He was in town last week. Apparently he thinks I need to get laid to take the edge off – said I need all the help I can get.”
“So,” Tony murmured, turning back to Steve after Clint had gone, “Speaking of people who have been hiding things. I think we were discussing the rather dramatic revelation that you love me.”
“That’s very sneaky of you, Rogers,” Tony replied. His voice was a bit slow, he noticed, and he couldn’t quite muster the focus to wag a finger for emphasis. “I don’t know if it’s good for you to be spending so much time around spies.”
“I could demonstrate some of the options on you right now,” Natasha offered casually.
They didn’t pull apart as much as they curled inward, Tony sliding down onto Steve’s chest as Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s shoulders. Steve adjusted the flannel duvet around Tony’s neck and then let his hand rest there, his fingers weaving into Tony’s hair.
because you fill me with incredibly casual, ordinary thoughts. Of course you drive me nuts, you idiot. I’ve been crazy about you for years.”
story about the afterparty for the men’s World Cup quarterfinal, Steve was less surprised to find himself on the receiving end of Tony Stark’s attention than he was to realize that the tabloid photos had totally failed to do justice to his eyelashes.
He found Tony standing with both arms braced against his worktable, designs for what looked like the paneling of Steve’s uniform projected in front of him. Steve cleared his throat, and Tony whirled around, the slump of his shoulders morphing into a graceful lounge by the time he was facing Steve.
Then Tony had made his way toward the couch where Steve sat, and something had clicked back into place. Steve could breathe freely again.
“I’m trying to contain my disapproval,” Steve replied.
But then the worst of Tony’s bad decisions — a blonde, abusive cheater of an ex-boyfriend named Tiberius Stone — had started dropping hints about Tony giving up his room on campus and moving downtown to live near the college’s wealthier set, and suddenly Steve had started looking like a safer option.
“My apologies, friends,” Thor replied, still beaming at them as Steve bent to sweep the shards into a dustpan. “I found the Captain’s speech very stirring.”
Tony felt his lips form a tight smile.
. The HYDRA agents hadn’t searched him carefully enough to find the small bobby pin that Fitz and Simmons had attached to the inside of his sleeve:
He went down.
And that was when he had pulled Tony carefully over his shoulder and marched him out of the lab.
“How long have you been in love with Stark?”
"You should get some potassium too,” Bruce said, dropping a banana onto the table and picking up Tony’s wrist to take his pulse. At first it looked like Tony was going to protest against the gesture, but he seemed to think better of it when he saw Steve staring him down from across the table.
“Okay, I’m going to ask the really obvious question here,” he began.
Steve felt a sudden tightness in his chest, and before he knew what he was doing, he had reeled backward, leaving Tony swaying slightly in his wake.
“God, I know,” Tony replied, running his hands through his hair with a grimace. “I know! Every rational part of me says that I should put a pin in ‘Rebirth’ and move on. But I can’t shake the feeling that there’s something here. You know when you wake up in the middle of the night halfway through writing the next paragraph, because even in your sleep, your brain keeps working the problem? I’m dreaming about these files, Bruce.”
“I’m okay, big guy,” she promised. “Steve and I are both okay, but we need the Doc right now to figure this out. So deep breaths.” She reached out slowly and took one of his hands in hers, running her thumb rhythmically against his palm. The green receded slowly from Bruce’s face as he followed her breathing.
“Tony!” Steve yelled, a spike of adrenaline making his chest tighten. He ran toward the place where his partner had disappeared, but he already knew what he was going to find.
Steve had drifted in and out of consciousness for a while after that, finally waking up long enough to eat a holiday dinner of contraband take-out, which Natasha had smuggled into the hospital using only Thor’s tendency to knock over delicate instruments and Bruce’s oversized jacket.
Steve wanted nothing more than to relax into Tony’s touch, letting him soothe the aches and stings the way he had in the kitchen that night, but another jagged pulse in his skull reminded him they were on the clock.
And with that he whirled away, leaving Tony blinking in confusion as he watched Grant stalk down the stairs and whisper fiercely into his phone.
A long pause followed, and Steve felt his hand tighten around his phone.
He turned to scan the lot for Clint. He needed to get out of here and find something he could hit hard enough to make the welts and bruises on the outside more painful than the ones inside.
Steve went momentarily still with surprise, and then he was kissing back greedily, one arm wrapping around Tony’s waist and sliding up the small of his back as he pulled Tony in tighter. Tony brought his hands up to the sides of Steve’s face, clinging onto the heat returning to his cheeks. He tilted Steve’s chin so that he could part his lips, and Steve rushed upward to meet him, his fingers weaving through the still-damp waves of Tony’s hair.
“Sure, Rogers. Fine. Whatever you want. No need for the two week’s notice: don’t let the door hit you on the way out.”
“Hands on your head, Rumlow,” he snapped, all the fury he had had to contain during the interrogation flooding into his voice. He tucked Ward’s gun into the holster on his belt. “If you move a fucking muscle, I will put your face through the wall. I’m taking Tony, and we’re getting out of here.”
Steve was interrupted by an eruption of chimes from the grandfather clock next to him. He looked over to see the small hand tick toward the ornate number eleven, each hour punctuated with a hollow strike of the brass rods. Just as the clock reached its final toll, a cold wind blew through the entryway, whipping at the hem of Steve’s trench coat and shutting the front doors with a slam.
Steve paused and then nodded. Tony gently took Steve’s chin in one hand to anchor himself and touched the ice pack to the largest clump of bruises, near Steve’s left temple. He tried to keep the pressure light, but Steve’s face remained drawn, his jaw flexing under Tony’s hand.
“Your one condition,” Tony continued. “It’s because you lost someone?”
Steve had taken the eggs off the burner, curled up on the couch, and been asleep ten minutes later.
The mission had gone wrong from the start: bad intel, a junior HYDRA agent who was far too twitchy with self-destruct buttons, and the first Code Green in months. After picking up the pieces of their weapons and uniforms, the team had flown back to the Tower in near silence, shuffled through a cursory medical check, and collapsed across the furniture in the common room. It had been a solid fifteen minutes before Clint had flopped over and pawed at the remote long enough to turn on “New Year’s Rockin’ Eve,” and another twenty minutes before Steve heaved himself off the couch to raid the kitchen for snacks.
“I’m awake!” Tony barked, stumbling momentarily before catching himself on the railing. He blinked blearily at Steve. “Oh, you’re not Pepper.” Another blink. “Oh, you’re an
“There is no team take-out fund, Barton. Now get lost,” Tony said.
“Are us,” Steve finished.
“Steve,” Tony breathed as soon as his partner entered the room. Steve’s face was tight in a way that Tony couldn’t quite sort into his catalogue of Steve expressions, but he was alive and apparently uninjured. Tony felt his thoughts slow to a simmer, like someone had finally turned the burner off under a teakettle.
“We’re both going to get out. You’re going to shock me, you’ll short out the chip, and then you’ll bring me back.”
Clint was across the room in a second, his hand snapping up over his shoulder, where he had strapped one of Tony’s briefcase suits to his back.
May Parker always hid a piece of whatever the Sunday dessert was - if it was good - in case Tony stopped by, and he'd heard a rumor today was lemon meringue. The cafeteria was pretty quiet, just a light smattering of students mixing bowls of every kind of cereal from the all-day breakfast counter to get them through a binge study session. There were a few people in line, though, so Tony pulled in at the end and dug his phone out.
, Natasha’s voice murmured in his head.
“I...what?” he managed finally. “When?”
The door closed behind them, leaving Steve alone with his nerves and the familiar pressure of the plastic phone in his hand. Taking a deep breath, he typed out a message, his fingers shaking only slightly over the keys:
The water was already rushing in around his calves.
“I knew you would say that, Stark,” Thor replied, “which is why I have asked Banner to design a great contest of warrior prowess, at which I will officially earn my title as strongest Avenger.”
“Ah that gives me an idea!” Thor exclaimed. He popped his head up from behind the kitchen counter, where he had apparently been braiding one of the garlands into his hair. “The tiny Iron Soldiers seem determined to guard the spirit of the holidays. Perhaps we can use that to our advantage.”
look in return, then turned back to tall, rude, and handsome. "You must be new here because only someone who hasn't actually tried to find a book in this hellhole would be so generous as to call it a 'library.' I'm pretty sure the entire linguistics section is actually cardboard standees of books. It's called 'Smith' for Christ's sake. I don't think there was actually anyone called Smith ever involved. They just wanted it to look like a benefactor had ever had a hand in this cursed knowledge desert so they picked the first name that came to mind. Have you seen a plaque somewhere thanking Atticus or Tessa or Robert Smith for his contribution? I haven't. I'm just saying."
“Kind of stepping on my moment here, Gumdrop,” Tony replied.
Grant had appeared at his side, and he opened the door. "No problem at all," he said.
“How many left, JARVIS?” Tony asked.
“Mace and Sitwell are on the committee this year,” he observed to Dummy, “so we’re going to put a little experiential-learning cherry on top, and those pencil pushers are going to eat it right up.”
“Yeah, you were doing so well that you blacked out in your garage after dropping your suit through several stories of your home,” Clint pointed out with a grin. “We’ve all seen the footage.”
The man bristled. "Regardless of what you may think of it, people are trying to study here, and it's rude to be so loud. Surely you can take your conversation outside."
Tony snorted.
Tony huffed out a sharp breath and then turned to face him.
The last chapter of the collection is here! Thank you to everyone who has read these short stories here and on Tumblr. I am wishing us all more justice and more peace in the new year to come.
Steve nodded. “I don’t like splitting up either, especially when the person running the op is withholding information,” he admitted. “But if there’s a chance that we can save a life and stop another attack, I don’t see how we can walk away.” He looked around the table to invite the others to chime in, his eyes lingering when he met Tony’s gaze.
“You’re the ones who attacked him,” Steve said. “The wreck was all over the news. You killed him.”
“Fine,” Bruce sighed. “I’m sorry to do this, Tony, but you leave me no choice.”
“I’m not sure I’m fighting the right battles,” Steve said finally, snapping Tony out of his reverie.
“You’ve been staring at that photo for ten minutes,” she pointed out. “You look like you’re about to start doodling new initials in your sketchbook.”
Steve’s foot slipped slightly on the final rung of the ladder. He tried to cover the misstep by exaggerating his hop to the ground; but judging by Natasha’s wry expression, he didn’t think he’d succeeded.
“Did you just call my phone so you could make out with me to the soundtrack from
“What was that?” Steve asked.
“Nat, please,” Steve said, just loud enough for her to hear.
“That Wilson guy’s with her,” Clint responded over the comms. “I gave her the high sign – she’ll know how to get them off the grid.”
They glanced back and forth between the tan trench coats and maroon button-downs adorning both Steve and the body buried in the floor.
“I'm glad you stole my keys,” Steve replied with a soft smile. He took a step forward and then paused, staring up at the archway he’d been about to pass through. “You have mistletoe,” he remarked in surprise. “I wouldn’t have thought you’d be the type to decorate.”
“Get him out of here, and you’ll have saved us both,” Steve promised. “Go.”
“You’re going to need a crash course in how to work an interrogation,” Natasha nodded. “Tony’s a pro at this, and if you can provide enough of a distraction, he’ll get free.”
“Steve,” Pepper managed, her voice shaking almost too hard to be understood, “I’m sorry. I couldn’t find a phone. Someone came… Tony got me out.”
“You got shot again,” Tony said accusingly, quickly shimmying out of his jacket so he could press the fabric to the growing pool of red on Steve’s abdomen. “How did you make it in the army so long if you keep getting shot all the time?”
In the corner were the cartoony outlines of Iron Man carrying a shield-wielding Captain America. The level of detail was probably pretty impressive, but Tony didn’t notice any of it, because in the center of the pumpkin – in soft, sloping letters – Steve had carved, “will you marry me?”
“How did you get those?”
“That’s impossible,” Steve said.
She left to go rally the rest of their caravan (how she’d managed to coax Bruce Banner away from his textbooks and houseplants every Friday that fall Tony didn’t know and didn’t care to learn), and Tony heard Steve take a deep breath, as if he were readying himself for battle.
“Obie is my business partner,” Tony said, throwing his hands up in exasperation. “You can’t just give him the forearm shiver on national television.”
With a sound almost closer to a moan than a creak, one of the doors that Tony had just tried swung open behind them, sending a shaft of warm light cutting across the hallway.
“Shocking,” Natasha murmured fondly, running one hand up and down Clint’s arm. “But not everyone is like you
“It’s okay, Tony,” Steve replied evenly. “We’re just having a chat.”
“Oh my God, Steve,” he managed, at the same time that Clint let out a loud, “Fuck.” Tony could hear Steve’s pulse thundering against his temple, and it was the most beautiful sound he’d ever heard. He pressed deeper into it, retracting the gauntlet so that he could dig his fingers into the warmth of Steve’s arms. If he held on tight enough, he couldn’t feel how hard his hands were shaking.
“It’s a trap then,” Natasha murmured.
“Yes, sir,” the cool voice acknowledged, his tone tinged with what sounded like the faintest hint of amusement. “System diagnostics show no indication of either an electrical or mechanical failure. I’m running further analysis now, but I do not believe you or Captain Rogers to be in any immediate danger.”
“It’s going to be okay, Tony,” Steve said evenly.
“Please be a door to Steve,” he muttered. “Please be a door to Steve.”
“The what?”
"I'm fine. Trevor is stuck."
“Is it weird that I’m jealous of someone whose grandkids probably have mortgages right now?” Tony asked, hitting the button for the penthouse suite.
They shared a long look – searching each other’s expressions for confirmation of something neither of them could have named out loud – and then bolted for the door. Once they made it to the porch, they paused momentarily to notice that the dark stains had disappeared from their clothing. Tony reached out, as if to touch the undamaged fabric of Steve’s shirt, before pulling back. And then Steve placed a hand on Tony’s lower back, and they sprinted to their cars.
Tony flailed for a moment then grabbed a handful of the back of James' shirt. He seemed to know what he was doing, so Tony's best option seemed to be to obey.
“I’m right here, big guy,” a voice said. And Steve realized he must have spoken the name aloud, because there was Tony, smiling in a way that didn’t quite soften the lines of worry around his eyes. Steve let out a deep breath, hearing the beep of a monitor slow gradually as he oriented himself. He was lying in a hospital bed, IVs attached to his left arm and a large bandage wrapped around his midsection. Tony was perched on the edge of the bed, and – with the exception of the dark circles under his eyes and a bandage on his right hand – he appeared to be unhurt.
It took him a few minutes to understand what he was seeing. The first pages were so dense with notations and calculations that Tony’s eyes did quick circuits of the words “vita radiation,” “nitramene,” and “vibranium” before landing on the ones that made him let out a distinctly unprofessional whoop: “Project Rebirth.”
Grant had been staring fixedly at the slide, but now his eyes flashed back to Tony’s, and the look on his face was so searching that Tony found himself blinking in confusion, his train of thought completely derailed.
“Not exactly,” Tony hedged. “Let’s say it seems like someone was hoping to use him, but things didn’t go according to plan. Like I said, it’s being handled.”
“Did you ever consider that they would use that against me too?” Tony retorted. “They sent me videos, Steve. Every hour, a new video. Do you have any idea –”
“I rest very actively. This is me at rest.”
“It’s at the base of the skull, by the olfactory nerves,” Simmons added. “They must have injected it through the nasal cavity.”
“You know, there’s a really interesting X-File from a few years back about some unknown entity that was breaking into elite research facilities by making itself intangible,” Tony called down the stairs. “Witnesses called it a ghost, but for a poltergeist, it was unusually interested in sabotaging corporate technology.”
“This was too lightweight,” Natasha shook her head. “They sent military-grade equipment to take out two men alone and could only manage the digital equivalent of a homemade pipe bomb for five sixths of the Avengers? They’re either stalling us or sending some kind of warning.”
Coffee.
They turned to see May standing in the doorway, giving them a look that managed to express both a total lack of interest and the possibility of their imminent demise.
That earned him a clenched jaw and a furrowed brow. Good. At least Steve angry was better than Steve distant or stoic – Steve as he had looked in the helicopter, so goddamn impassive that Tony couldn’t tell whether he was literally made of stone or whether he was trying to conceal a mortal injury.
After checking the team’s progress against his itinerary, Steve turned to the next task on his own list: bringing Tony Stark his emergency coffee. Bruce had just made a second pot, and Steve poured some into the largest cup he could find: a purple novelty mug, featuring a drawing of the Hulk and the words “You Wouldn’t Like Me Without My Coffee.” He paused to tuck a few biscuits into a napkin (Tony’s relief at sighting fresh coffee sometimes opened up a narrow window during which Steve could feed him breakfast without being noticed), and headed down to the lab.
Coulson’s lips compressed marginally.
“I mean I’m handling it, Steve!” Tony snapped.
“I couldn’t sleep,” Steve explained, one hand rubbing at the back of his neck. “Can I –”
“He’s lonely, Pep,” Tony had said instead. “You should see his face sometimes when he thinks no one’s looking. It’s like someone yanked out his insides months ago and he’s been trying to hide it by keeping his superhuman abs clenched all the time. He needs the team. He needs a friend. I can’t mess that up just because I’m a greedy son of a bitch.”
” to the list of Tower rules on the refrigerator, Steve had been making a real effort to stop micro-managing Tony’s coping strategies. And so, despite a worrying number of coffee mugs littered around the room and what looked suspiciously like a muscle twitch developing in Tony’s left cheek, Steve had tried to limit his expressions of concern to one pointed look, which he directed at the spoon that Tony had picked up, not in order to eat the chili, but rather to tap out a drum solo against the side of his desk.
Tony started off in the direction Steve had indicated, but Steve found himself hesitating at the fork, glancing back behind him at the way they had come. Something seemed off. Zemo had obviously gone to elaborate lengths to weaponize the rig, but now he didn’t even seem to be trying that hard to hurt or capture them. The gas wasn’t fast-acting enough to incapacitate them, and the doors had never shut in a way that would trap them all in one place where they could be picked off.
The past month had been hard on the whole team: at several points, the calls to assemble had gotten so frequent that even Thor admitted he wouldn’t mind a few days off to catch up on
"Me? Give up on my May-time? Not in a million years." Tony flashed her his most charming smile. "You know I come for you and not the pie, my dear."
“I’ve seen my bed in the last 72 hours, which I gather is more than you can say.”
“We’ll go see if we can rustle up some better food than that travesty of a mac-and-cheese dinner they were bringing around earlier,” Sam offered, rising to his feet along with Wanda and Natasha. “While we’re gone, maybe you can think about why you kept muttering his name the whole time they were prepping you for surgery.”
“I can’t believe I’m going to die in a place that just got cut from the ‘25 Most Haunted Houses in America’ list. Christ, that’s embarrassing.”
Pepper raised an eyebrow at Tony.
Disclaimer: I still know next to nothing about technology or anatomy.
Tony was probably telling the truth when he said it was nothing to him. He couldn’t know what it meant to Steve to hear that word offered to him so casually. Tony was generous. He was asking a group of practical strangers to move in with him: maybe it really was easy to give a lot when you had so much to give.
He was rolling already by the time he hit the glass. He landed in a crouch, grabbed the shield from his back and held it in front of him as he quickly scanned the room. A young man Steve assumed was Harrison was lying in a medical chair near the center, and three guards with assault rifles and masks had been scattered around the room. One of the three had managed to get his gun pointed in Steve’s direction, so Steve aimed the shield in his direction first. As soon as it was in the air, he charged the man closest to him. He collided in time to rip the assault rifle upward, then spun the guard’s body to put it between him and the final assailant. He twisted the rifle out of guard number two’s hand and shot guard number three, just as a bullet from guard number three hit guard number two in the chest.
embarrassing addition aloud, because Steve’s expression had somehow grown even more moody as he spoke.
“See now that was two jokes in a row. That’s got to be some kind of personal record, right? You didn’t even have to pause to regroup with a stern one-liner. I think that’s a sign that I’m having a good influence on you.”
A knock on the side of the wall outside the unit interrupted his thoughts, and Tony looked up to see a U-Haul employee standing tentatively by the sliding door.
“You know what’s weirder?” Steve continued. “The other guy is wearing yours.”
Steve stood in the middle of the library, staring at the remains of the doors he’d kicked down, arms crossed in contemplation. He hadn’t been able to raise Tony by shouting through either of the room’s exits, and he still wasn’t sure whether moving through the identical rooms was getting him farther away from their original entry point or getting him nowhere at all. Half of his instincts were telling him to stay put: when you’ve gotten separated from your men, running around without a sense of direction only makes it worse. The other half were screaming at him to tear through every door of the house until he found his partner, because absolutely anything could be happening to Tony, and how dare you sit around here, Rogers – if you don’t move your ass before you’re too late again, you’d never survive it, and who could say you’d even deserve to –
"You've got til Monday, lady, and yes I'm fully aware Chi Omega is having a party on Saturday night, which means you're going to want to get it done by Friday." Tony sipped his coffee again.
Tony took up a position on the opposite side of the elevator from Steve, and Steve crossed his arms tightly across his chest, wishing, not for the first time, that he didn’t always take up so much space. Clint stood in between them, muttering something that sounded like, “I’ll show you a horse,” after which a long silence fell.
“Team needs a goddamn marriage counselor,” he muttered to himself.
Steve’s mission report.
“Sam asked me about retiring once,” Steve said slowly. “I couldn’t picture it at all – didn’t even know where to start. That bothered me for a while because I thought maybe I had lost myself in the fight. But now I think it’s because I found myself there. I couldn’t build a home in D.C. or Brooklyn because I already had one. I had it the moment we stood together against the Chitauri in New York. Just took me a while to realize it.”
Clint anyway?”
“Tony –” Steve started, but Tony whirled on him, eyes blazing.
"I deserve it," Pepper said.
“Why?” Tony whispered hoarsely. His stomach was roiling as the battle replayed in his head – only this time when the unknown knight rushed between Tony and his attacker, it was Steve’s blue eyes behind the visor, and Steve’s broad chest curling over Tony’s body as the sword fell. Tony traced a finger along to the edges of the wound, and when Steve shivered, Tony felt the sensation reverberate up his arm as if he’d swung a hammer against hot iron.
“– the damage will be lethal.”
“One,” Ward counted calmly.
No photographs of family, Tony noticed - merely as a professional observation, of course. If he filed that information away for any reason, it was as further evidence that Dr. James Grant was a workaholic.
“Seriously, Nat. I don’t really have a plan. I can’t exactly pull him aside after a team meeting and say, ‘Tony, I know you just broke up with the woman who may be the love of your life, but I fell for you almost the first day I met you, so would you like to go steady?’”
“Stay still,” Tony replied.
“I’ve trusted May with my life on missions, and I’d do it again,” Natasha said finally. “But she was
“I have a working theory,” Natasha continued, glancing up at him as she reached the floor. Steve sighed and holstered his gun so that he could follow her down. “I think you tell yourself that you follow him out of duty or loyalty. But that’s because you’re too afraid to admit your dirty little secret: that the only pleasure you really know how to let yourself feel is self-righteousness.”
Tony was almost finished fashioning a battering ram out of a footstool, the fire poker, and three hacked-off chair legs when he became aware that someone was standing behind him. He took his time turning around and kept his face carefully neutral when he saw who it was: a gorgeous redhead, leaning against one edge of the demolished chair, her black dressing gown pulled slightly back to reveal the bullet wound in her stomach.
