From Steve, whose hand tightens around Tony’s wrist—the opposite of what Tony anticipated, but everything he needs and knows he can’t have. He wants it and doesn’t deserve it.
, even after all this time, after everything they’ve been through, he still manages to sound so goddamn earnest, like everything Tony does for him is an unnecessary expenditure of Tony’s invaluable time and effort and not what Tony loves doing most in the world.
,” Steve tells him, voice a low growl in Tony’s ear. Before Tony can respond, Steve latches onto that same spot on his neck, sucking a bruise high and hard into the sensitive skin there. Forget weak, Tony’s knees are
Steve groans something hoarse and needy and takes his hand away from Tony’s back, just long enough to grab the bottle of lube Tony forgot he’d retrieved from the bedside drawer, pop the cap and slick his fingers with a wet, telling squelch.
Tony laughs along with everyone else, warmed by Jarvis’ voice offscreen telling “Young Master Anthony” to show off his latest invention for the camera. He feels Steve’s eyes flicker over to land on him whenever young Tony smiles at the camera or laughs at something Jarvis says, but Tony ignores it.
Autopilot is as useful a function in the Iron Man suit as it is in the rest of his life, especially these past six weeks—buttoning his shirt, Tony notices but doesn’t worry about how he can’t feel the fabric under his fingers, or the pinch of his dress shoes as he pulls those on; the world has been slightly out of focus ever since he and Steve broke up, and the feeling of walking through life with only half the lights on upstairs and a black hole where his viscera used to be is all too familiar.
of Steve, everywhere, inside and around him, and he’s never felt safer or more cherished. Beautiful.
Steve smacks him on the ass again for that, the opposite cheek, smothering Tony’s cry with his mouth before it hits the air. Each kiss is a brand on Tony’s heart, on his
Before Tony can retrieve his wrist from Steve’s grasp, the fingers around it squeeze ever so slightly. The energy in the elevator shifts just as subtly, a frisson of
“Oh, you know, lock myself in the workshop for a few days until I forget about how much I want a drink.”
“You’re an idiot, Tony Stark.” Steve presses the words into the skin under Tony’s ear before latching his mouth to that spot and sucking so hard Tony’s knees buckle. The hand on his ass clenches, holds, and lifts, suspending Tony off the ground for Steve’s pleasure as he bites and sucks the base of Tony’s fluttering throat a livid purple. The brand of him against the inside of Tony’s thigh is a heavy, constant reminder that this is
,” Steve sighs, awed, taking in the sight of him the way an artist appraises a masterpiece, methodically absorbing every square centimeter of what’s on display with wide, blown-black eyes, licking his lips when he sees the mess he’s made of Tony’s ass and releasing the arm around Tony’s middle to reach down and play with it, pushing his fingers through the hot, sticky mess of come between Tony’s trembling thighs and slipping it back inside him just because he can. “Perfect. You’re perfect. And all for me,” he says, and Tony’s throat clicks. He wants to respond, tell Steve
,” over and over, losing air on every plea until Steve decides to show mercy and slip a third finger inside him, slow and steady and dripping wet. “Please, please—
That would be enough to make Tony mewl with want, seeing how badly Steve wants him. But then Steve starts
He can feel every inch of him, thick and hot and so fucking long it has to be illegal in a few states. Tony must say something to that effect because Steve is humming again, not quite a moan, not quite a laugh, as he firms up his grip on Tony’s jaw and grinds against his ass like a sealed promise Tony has to sign for.
That’s dangerous. That’s inching toward a line he wouldn’t go anywhere near if he were in his right mind. But it’s late, and Tony is tired, and strung out, and in love with this man who doesn’t love him back, and he’s trying so hard to compartmentalize that along with everything else, but Steve won’t let go of his fucking wrist and it’s dissolving what’s left of Tony’s nerves.
Which was an issue, because then he couldn’t stop noticing certain things about Tony when he was around, and especially when he wasn’t: like how Tony knew how Steve liked his coffee despite the fact they’d never talked about it, or how Tony always made sure to keep to Steve’s right when they walked or sat next to each other, because Steve carried his shield with his left hand and Tony knew he felt better with it open. And when they were apart it was almost worse, because then Steve noticed how much
“Delores,” she replies, shaking their hands. “But please, call me Del, or I’ll never hear the end of it.”
“Mmm, that’s nice. That’s perfect, Tony,” he groans, right into Tony’s ear. At this angle Tony can fuck back, and he does, pushing his hips back every time Steve thrusts up, and he drinks in the low, punched-out sound that comes out of Steve’s mouth with a smile and a long, laving lick to the column of Steve’s throat, tasting his sweat and memorizing the heady salt tang of it on his tongue. “O-oh, fuck,
“You can’t answer my question with a question, Tony,” Steve says, smirking when Tony’s expression flickers.
“I have to go to another event tonight,” he says. “Wanna dress up? Be my date? Watch my back?” This is something he can do now—he can touch Steve, take him out, kiss him,
“Isn’t it?” Steve huffs. “What else could it be?” Natasha’s lips form a perfectly straight line, which is the closest thing to a tell Natasha has. “What?”
And yeah, maybe Tony’s been at a loss for friends most of his life. Maybe this thing with Steve got off to a bumpy start because of his profound self-esteem issues. Maybe this will all blow up in their faces. But he loves Steve Rogers, and that has been and always will be the truth.
fall any more in love with him? Granted, that ship sailed eons ago, but Tony likes to think he still has some degree of restraint left in him. Maybe. After this, though, probably not. But that’s a problem for Future Tony to deal with, after Steve
like it’s everything and nothing all at once—the simplest, most obvious answer to a question that didn’t even need to be asked. An absolute, indisputable fact.
He’s spent the past ten years and change like this—halved by a love that makes him feel whole, which is an equation that shouldn’t work, but does, because Tony’s math is always right—so what’s one more night? In the grand scheme of things, not much, and every second of it is more than Tony could have ever hoped for.
“I can’t do this,” Tony whines. The conversations happening around them are loud, but not so loud Steve doesn’t hear him say it. The words cut him like a cold knife sharply through the middle. His head feels woozy, and not in the airy fun way it should be after drinking good wine for two and a half hours. How did things end up here so quickly? A minute ago Steve was having a religious experience and now Tony face is ashen and drawn. He looks like he wants to be anywhere but here.
and he needs the space to work it out for himself. you're always there to fish him out when the water gets cold, and by that time Tony's ready to tell you about whatever's eating him.
“That’s right, big boy,” Tony hums, fucking Steve’s cock between his hands slow and twisting and long, “two can play at this game.”
they shouldn't even work together, as a couple, and yet, here's Tony waking up next to Steve on some random sunday morning, bed-headed and groggy because he went to sleep late, after Steve was already conked out, and it works, because really all they did was add physical and emotional intimacy and a lot—
He doesn’t realize he’s said that last bit out loud until Steve sighs as he presses a kiss to Tony’s slack, drooling mouth and says, low and sex-roughened to a coarse grit, “That’s all I want, Tony. All I want. Always.” Tony can’t kiss him back at this angle, so he does the next best thing, pulling his legs tightly together under Steve’s and squeezing around Steve’s punishing cock with every ounce of internal strength he can still muster, squeezing and clenching his loose, sloppy hole until he hears Steve choke on a gasp and curse. “
for months you watch this doubt flicker like a guttering little flame in Tony's bright blue eyes, every time you say "I love you, Tony" with your voice. it's never there when you're brushing your teeth next to other in the morning, bumping hips and giggling like the children you never got to be; it's not there when you silently hand him his coffee and kiss him on the temple on his way out the door to a morning meeting, grousing on the phone even as he blows a kiss to you before the elevator doors close; it's not there when you sit down next to him after a battle, on the steps of some middle-of-nowhere courthouse that just got blown up by some no-name villain, taking unspeakable comfort in the radiating heat coming off the armor that kept Tony safe in combat, and without having to ask or say anything at all Tony takes the helmet off and you lean your foreheads together and just breathe each other's air, too relieved and too exhausted to kiss; it's not there when you make love to him, slowly, excruciatingly sweet, your hips rolling in a steady, undulating wave between Tony's long, golden thighs, his arms loose around your neck, his gorgeous voice gone raspy and quiet from screaming through two orgasms already, and you tell him to look at you as you come together one last time.
,” he sobs, shuddering like he’s being electrocuted, trapped under Steve’s body so all he can do is let it roll over him, every brain-melting wave of hot, electric pleasure, over and over again until he’s grinding his spent, wet cock against the mattress, heaving in long, dragging breaths and sobbing out Steve’s name.
“God, Tony…” he says, a low rasp that comes from somewhere deep inside him. In the low light of Tony’s bedroom, the arc reactor lights up Steve’s roving eyes an even more vivid blue, deepens the unfathomable black at the center of them until Tony feels like he’s falling in headfirst. “You’re the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen.”
on his lap and coffee in hand, he analyzes the photo with a more measured eye than he had yesterday, when he’d been so blindsided by seeing
magic. And his heart was made of pure light. He’d placed it in Steve’s hand. Steve never told anyone how it burned him to hold it, or that he’d prayed for the wound not to heal.
, big and sturdy and so fucking strong, hard up against him and exerting just enough force through the hand now plastered on Tony’s ass to keep their hips joined as they move together. Steve uses his whole body to kiss, rocking them every time he darts the tip of his tongue fleetingly across Tony’s lower lip so Tony gasps, adjusting Tony into new positions with little nudges of his dexterous fingers, and Tony is absolutely blissed the fuck out on how helpless he is in the face of Steve’s desire, riding the wave that is Steve’s thick thigh being nudged between his legs, the breath-stealing pressure of Steve’s lips, and the hot, wet curl of Steve’s tongue against his.
Steve relaxes back into his hold on Tony, relieved beyond words. He didn’t fuck it up by mentioning the scepter; nearly, maybe, but not entirely. Smiling, he says, “It’s a kiss, Tony. I’m not asking you to marry me.” (Which is objectively hilarious, Steve thinks, because he has absolutely thought about what it would be like to be married to Tony and the results were
True to his word, when Tony wakes again, Steve is there, sitting in the same crappy plastic chair Tony sat in last time and holding Tony’s hand, watching him come to like Tony is something magical to behold.
. Tony applies pressure, pulls away, applies it again; tilts his head left and does it again, a soft rasp of lips, and Steve is left gasping for his return every time. He knows he should show mercy to Tony’s suit jacket, but as long as Tony insists on keeping it on, he’s going to hold onto him with it. God, it feels like his skin is the only thing keeping him contained when Tony presses another kiss to his bottom lip, tasting it ever-so-sneakily with his tongue before pulling away.
As soon as he says it, Steve starts to pull back, flushed cheeks blanching so fast Tony worries he might faint. It’s worrying, but a good sign, too, Tony has to imagine, his own head still spinning from the fact that Steve Rogers was about to kiss him just now, which.
Looking at Steve now, Tony withers, wishing the kitchen floor would open up and swallow him whole. Steve still looks a million times better than Tony feels, but there’s a pinching around his eyes that Tony recognizes as concern, and it shouldn’t make his heart sing to know Steve can still feel that about him, but it does. Backlit by the morning sun coming in unobscured through the mansion’s massive windows, Steve looks like an angel come to earth, bright and warm and golden. Tony feels small and twisted and hollow in comparison. Weak. A coward, who let this man slip through his fingers for fear of losing him later on down the line.
Instead of a kiss, Steve wraps an arm around Tony’s back and pulls him in close, mirroring the hug he’d given him before…all of that happened.
He expects Tony’s mouth in response, given that perfect opening, but instead Steve feels his hand come up and hold him by the shoulder. Not to push him away, but to pause. “Tony?”
Steve Rogers of 2023 knows this kid won’t hesitate to seize the opportunity he’s about to be presented with.
. Painfully so, from the looks of it, the whole gorgeous length of him a deep, throbbing pink, that blunt head Tony had felt through his jeans earlier so slick with precome it’s practically
A sound like a hammer on an anvil echoes through the basement, followed shortly by another cry. Angry, this time, not at all like Steve’s. Tony floods the place with light from the armor, both arms up and ready for action, drawing the attention of the four behemoths fighting blind all the way in the back.
” he cries, literally, big fat tears leaking out of the corners of his eyes as he strains his neck almost backwards to look up at Steve, who gazes back with those big blue eyes of his, awed like Tony’s pleasure really is the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen.
Before he’s even finished shaking, Steve moves his hand off of Tony’s hip to fist his own cock, collecting Tony’s come and slicking the way with it, groaning hoarse and hot against Tony’s slack mouth.
In their wake, Steve’s ears are buzzing, and he realizes with a jolt that he’s now alone. With Tony.
He banks hard around a corner when he hears Steve curse, gauntlets up so he can see: Piledriver at Steve’s back with an arm around his neck, and even against Steve’s considerable size the guy looms large, threatening the choke the life out of Steve with a smile on his face.
Then Steve notices the high-and-tights, the form-fitting, drab beige shirts they’re all wearing, the multiple pairs of combat boots lined up behind the loveseat, and he realizes, much like he did with Sam that morning in DC,
. Has him in every way he’s ever wanted him, and they’ve barely just begun. And Steve doesn’t just want Tony—he wants others to know he
Picking up his fork, Steve licks the taste of Tony from his lips as he looks across the table at his date and takes another bite of pasta. Tony looks back. He looks
Steve gasps, throat clicking as he pumps the blunt, purpling head of his leaking cock with his fist, tight little circles and twists until he comes with a grunt against Tony’s shoulder, shuddering as he comes, and comes, spilling all over his own fingers, his cock, and Tony wants to cry, it’s so beautiful, how much Steve comes, dripping through his fingers and down the shaft of his cock with it. Perfect, squeaky-clean Captain America, covered in his own spunk—“Fucking
, where was Steve hiding this part of himself all this time? Tony gasps and clenches as around his knuckles tight as he can. Steve’s breath stutters against his throat. “Yes, so good, so—
, too sluggish to form syllables and turn them into words. He’s a goddawful mess of tears and lube and come, so much come, and he can’t even
There is a kitchen—because where else would Tony be at three o’ clock in the morning after a gala where the only offerings were inscrutable fish tarts (greasy, possibly made with fake crab) and stuffed mushroom canapés (sodium bombs waiting to go off), neither of which he ate—a tuxedo jacket draped over a chair, an open takeaway carton of cold pork fried rice, a glass of water Tony wishes was something stronger, and Steve.
“Ha,” Tony wheezes. “Speaking of Legos.” He drops it into his pocket along with the laser pointer and whatever else is in there and hangs his head. Rubbing his brow, Tony says: “God. I could sleep for a
He’d cried the next morning—for their losses, yes, but mostly because he had healed. It was torture, feeling one way but appearing the opposite. It was one of the ways he and Tony had come to understand each other, over the years prior: sometimes what appears on the outside isn’t the truth of what lives on the inside.
“I’ll get plenty of rest on the other side of this,” he says. “Just need to ride out the itch first.”
“You’re never ‘just’ anything, Nat,” Steve says, looking the woman pointedly in the eye. Natasha shrugs.
. The part of Tony’s brain—a scant centimeter, at best—that isn’t currently blasting a hundred sirens at full volume is actually kind of impressed.
Tony puts down the razor and stares at himself in the mirror. A mask of dread with a freshly sculpted goatee stares back. It’s too early for that much feeling, but this is the position he’s put himself in.
it, how wet and sloppy he is inside with Steve’s spunk. “That’s right, all of that come inside you,” Steve husks, massaging one of Tony’s trembling ass cheeks with one hand, “all wet with me inside. Feels good?” Tony can’t even
Steve gives him that little smirk and says, “Maybe I want to.” Tony scoffs, flicking one of the shoulders in question for good measure.
While Steve draws on those memories often enough with others on the team, it’s a rare occasion for Tony to be on the receiving end of Steve’s nursing hand like this. Jokes or angry silence over cuts, breaks, and bruises, sure, but this? Tender hands and a voice pitched low and soothing, lullaby-soft, speaking words of gentle encouragement? Tony’s head feels light with it.
He wants to tell him to stop. Stop lying. Stop saying things he wouldn’t mean in any other context. But Tony is helpless, greedy, needy, and starved; he’s wanted Steve for so long. He should let himself have this while he can get it, as long as he can get it.
, wet and weak and shivering violently head to toe as he careens head first off that highrise, coming hard against the mattress while Steve fucks him with those hard, short, breathtaking thrusts, never letting up even as Tony thrashes under him, bucking and
, and fuck if it’s not the hottest thing that’s happened to Tony in his entire life. Between the emotional outpouring and the manhandling and the feel of Steve’s massive length through those goddamn chinos, Tony’s about fifteen, maybe twenty seconds away from coming in his jeans like a teenager, and not a single part of him gives a shit.
Tony sets the clean fork back down on the counter. “…an arrangement with JARVIS,” Steve finishes, which isn’t what Tony was hoping he would say there, but it’s also not a variation on the theme of
fingers into him, slow and easy, because Tony is already loose for him, loose where Steve tongue-fucked him open, sweet and sloppy and ready for Steve’s big, strong, beautiful fingers. Tony moans, moans, can’t stop, can’t
Steve turns his whole head to look at Tony then. He notices the shaking and knows it’s not from wind chill.
It’s Wednesday, and Wednesday means movie night at the mansion. A time-honored tradition that goes all the way back to the Avengers’ inception, back when Steve was still finding his way out of the ice—literally and figuratively—and Iron Man and Tony Stark were two different people.
, Steve.” These words have been building up and building up for a week, and they’re so easy to say now—Tony can’t stop them from spilling out. He holds onto Steve for dear life, hoping for a net. “I’m reckless with myself, my things, my words, but,
Rogers is hesitating. He doesn’t want to be selfish—that’s not in his nature. Steve smiles and reaches out, cups his hands around the one with the device and closes Rogers’ fingers around it.
“What’s done is done,” Schmidt says, sadder than Steve ever heard him in life. Turning around, Steve looks at the cloaked figure floating, weightless, a few inches above the ground. He doesn’t feel pity, per se, but there’s a misery to Schmidt’s expression that looks deeply carved. Earned.
, he loves it, arching up for another one that never comes, because Steve is too busy undoing his own belt buckle. But he does hear the man hum thoughtfully, even as he shucks his own jeans and kicks them onto the floor to join the rest of their clothes.
“I missed you,” Steve whispers, warm breath ghosting over Tony’s tingling lips. Before Tony can take in the blush he
When Steve smiles, it’s not cute, or goofy, or sweet. That same frisson from earlier shoots through Tony’s gut, hot and burning, when Steve cuts him a look with a dark, sideways smirk that promises only the filthiest, most terrible things Tony can imagine.
“Nice try,” Steve says. His dark, promising smile is the last thing Tony sees before he’s being lifted and dropped down belly-first across his own California King, face landing in pure white 1,000 thread count sheets that haven’t been slept in once.
“I learned a lot of things before I met Sharon,” Steve’s voice rumbles in his ear, and Tony gasps, because
” Tony answers dumbly, too gone on the way Steve’s fingers feel inside of him, so deep in his ass, dripping wet and so, so clever, seeking out Tony’s prostate and pressing against it with two flat fingertips, holding perfectly still as Tony cries out and grinds down against the heel of Steve’s palm, riding Steve’s fingers like nothing else in the world could possibly matter. “Yes, Steve,
I’d see you again and find out it was all just a…a fluke. It was perfect, and I got it in my head that it was better to have one night of perfect than ask for more than you were prepared to give.”
Even as Steve's words fill Tony with an overwhelming, lung-squeezing surge of happiness, the woman's derisive, chiming laugh stings him right where it hurts; he has to set his glass on the floor because his hand is starting to shake. “I thought Tony Stark didn’t go in for friends
He sounds—god, he sounds miserable, is what he sounds like. Tony can sympathize, since he feels just as awful, and that was before he jumped on a bomb to save Steve’s life.

lucky. He feels like he’s gotten the heady hint of a taste of what he wants most and can never have and come tomorrow he’ll go back to the way things were, keeping Tony at arm’s length when he wants to hold him close. The Picture™ is seared in his memory, as is the moment itself: Tony, kneeling. Their hands clasping, holding. Tony’s smile. The smile Steve only ever sees directed at him.
is? because he knows what it feels like to love Steve—he's had years, decades of experience with that, after all—but so far in their relationship he's just been waiting for some shoe to drop, for Steve to realize his feelings don't match the sheer depth and breadth of Tony's, for him to
The burning light at the center of Tony Stark is so blue, a glowing circle shining out from behind that silly threadbare band t-shirt like a beacon in the night, guiding Steve home. How is no one else marveling at this? At Tony Stark, alive?
The doorknob jamming against Tony’s hip kicks him back, panting, into reality. “What was the second thing?” he whines.
A pause as JARVIS scans the building. Tony bites a nail and taps his foot nervously, out of sync with the music.
The answering glide of Steve’s knuckles past his loosened rim, so slick and easy, frictionless where Steve’s worked him nice and open, makes Tony’s head loll forward onto Steve’s shoulder even as he tries to summon up some other protest. All that comes out is a long, breathless
A man’s flustered voice appears suddenly from behind Duncan, cutting through the noise, words spilling out in a rush. Steve notices heads whipping around to gawk, bug-eyed, at whoever’s just appeared.
, that’s so good, Tony thinks, shivering at the scrape of Steve’s perfect teeth against his swelling bottom lip, but it’s not an answer, and this is too close to everything Tony’s ever wanted from Steve for him to just let it
“Really?” she asks, panting only a little bit as she pushes her bangs back from her forehead with the heel of her palm. “You think so?”
, of course he does, but Tony was always especially weak for slightly disheveled and endearingly domestic Steve Rogers wearing a T-shirt and sweatpants. It doesn’t help that Steve looks
“Ah, you love me,” Steve teases. As they reach the bottom of the stairs, Tony turns toward him again and smiles, bright and brazen. Steve turns and looks a little stunned at what he sees written there on Tony's face.
Tony takes a long drink of black, bitter coffee, the perfect remedy for post-three hour long meeting with Pepper and the hospital board-brain. He sighs. Steve is sitting
“Aye aye, Cap’n,” he whispers, laughing wetly against Steve’s shoulder before pulling away from the indulgence of Steve’s embrace. Tony even manages a fraction of a real smile as he wipes his eyes with the back of his hand, breathing through the residual tremors until he’s mostly settled in his own skin again.
“Uh-huh.” Steve sits on the arm of the sofa, legs stretched out in front of him. “And who are they really?”
and we’ll see,” Tony says, smiling down at Steve’s hand wrapped up in the tie still hanging from his neck.
Tony downs half his drink and barely conceals a little hiccup behind his hand, which shouldn’t be so goddamn cute on a grown man Tony’s age, on
maybe even reality. not in a "you might be a Skrull" kind of way, but in a "this is too good to be true" kind of way.
“Are you doing okay? I know we—things kind of...ended, abruptly.” Steve says the word ‘ended’ like it tastes bad. His face screws up like he’s sucked a rancid lemon. It’d be endearing if it wasn’t directed at Tony for Tony’s sake. “I’ve been worried about you.”
But Steve doesn’t balk at the comment. He doesn’t pull away and give Tony that look, the one that screams
Tony wants to live in this moment forever. He’s going to invent time travel and come back to this over and over and over again until he dies or the machine breaks, whichever comes first. He never could have guessed Steve would be like this, so beautiful and intense and so fucking
“Ah, hell, Tony, take it, sweetheart,” Steve groans against Tony’s sweaty temple, brushing the damp hair back from his eyes before replacing the hand on Tony’s ass. Tony nods, reaching up to hold onto the side of Steve’s neck, just to feel a thundering pulse that isn’t his own. “Take it so good for me, don’t you, baby. Yeah, just like that. You’re so loose now, you feel that? Taking me so easy now. So good. Perfect, Tony. You’re
They breeze past awkward and straight into comfortable after that. Tony apologizes for being late again and Steve shuts him up with bread.
But tonight is Steve’s pick for movie, and Tony wonders if it was planned that way the moment Luke Cage asks what they’re going to watch and Steve gets that glint in his eye. The one that Tony can recognize from a mile away now without even trying, the one that
, Steve had called him all those years ago, and yet as he watched Tony bend himself over Bucky’s arm for hours, fiddling and tinkering and fixing and keeping up a one-sided conversation until Bucky decided it was safe to join in—or rather that Tony wasn’t about to spring some murderous trap on him—Steve realized Tony really was, at the end of the day, a civilian who woke up and chose to do as many good things as possible for the world, even at risk or cost—financial, physical, or otherwise—to himself.
Steve hauls him in closer until they’re chest to chest. Steve is a wall of warmth and soft cotton and the unmistakable smell of what Tony’s logical brain knows is a combination of dish soap and laundry detergent and leftover Chinese food and leather and aftershave and gasoline and whatever pomade Steve uses and that fancy lavender-and-amber oil diffuser that Natasha gave Steve for his birthday a couple months ago, but what his emotional brain, his hindbrain, his
,” he breathes, tracing the seam of him where he’s squeezed tight around Steve’s cock with a reverent thumb, the one Tony had so badly wanted to suck earlier. “Just look at you. All full of me. You take it so well, don’t you, sweetheart? All that cock, deep inside you…”
Like a shot, Steve is up and holding on to Tony so he doesn’t hop backwards into the glass coffee table. One arm wrapped around his back and the other hand on his bicep, Steve steadies Tony as Tony searches underfoot for whatever hurt him.
It’s the most forthright question Steve has ever put to him about his alcoholism. The sheer shock of it makes Tony’s mouth drop open. He’s not offended, just…surprised. Steve’s done a lot of growing over the years—sometimes Tony forgets, and then sometimes Steve says something like
“I had him!” Sam shouts, even as relief washes over his strained features. Iron Man shrugs, hovering a few inches above concrete.
His past self is still lying unconscious on the glass walkway where Steve left him when he returns. Arms and legs akimbo, that charmingly ridiculous uniform stretching to compensate for the awkward splaying of limbs, Steve Rogers of 2012 looks like a child who went down for a nap,
Steve looks at their hands where they’re joined next to Tony’s thigh on the hospital bed. Tony can’t help but think how much better it would be if they were at home, in bed, together.
on what planet, in what universe, in what timeline—alternate, parallel, or otherwise—is Tony Stark lovable? in general, and specifically in the eyes of Steve Rogers, who is dorky and sweet and earnest and honest (most of the time) and strong (except when he's not) and a bastion of moral goodness and rightness and everything Tony wishes he could be but never can because his past weighs too heavily on everything he does, always, forever.
Steve smiles. “Sam’s fine. A little pissed off at you for not giving him enough of a heads up before you threw me at him like a glorified football, but he’ll live.”
Between them, the steam rising off the rigatone alla vodka swirls, disturbed by the sudden breeze, then continues curling lightly upwards like nothing out of the ordinary has happened. Like Steve’s entire life wasn’t just irrevocably changed, upended, by a single kiss.
Steve nods once and steps in close to cradle Tony’s head in his hands. The touch is so sweet; the look on Steve’s face is not. It’s hungry and burning and Tony’s blood is singing. He tugs on Steve’s narrow hips with a whine, bracing his head against Steve’s hands as the man dives in for another kiss that steals the breath right out from Tony’s lungs.
“Steve, please,” Tony insists, reluctantly prying his fingers away from Steve’s neck and holding them against his shoulders. Only when Steve stops trying to Hoover Tony’s soul out through his mouth does Tony realize he’s a good four, almost five feet off the ground. Steve lets him down with a pout that Tony refuses to capitulate to, but it’s a near thing. Panting like he’s just run a mile, Tony looks Steve in the eye and says: “Not that this isn’t—”
“The cube was just a housing unit,” Steve explains, slipping back into his old by-the-book tone of voice like one slips on a pair of well-worn leather shoes. Pierce takes it with an eerie smile.
blind, Captain,” he says, voice low but good-humored. Next to him, Natasha smothers a smile behind her hand.
That’s the plan, anyways, until Steve’s hand appears out of nowhere and shoots out to stop the elevator doors from closing.
the most beautiful thing Steve has ever seen. “Just like that, baby, keep looking at me like that, so gorgeous, beautiful,
Steve struggles harder, gritting his teeth against the pressure cutting off his air supply. Piledriver holds the bomb out to his side, cackling again—that manic laugh always unsettles something in Tony. All he has to do is drop the bomb on its tail to hit the pressurized switch and in seconds, they’re all goners. The only good news is that the blast radius itself isn’t significant: if he can get Steve and Sam far enough out of the way, that should be enough to save them.
“Don’t you dare,” Steve husks before diving in for another kiss that knocks the air right out of Tony’s lungs. And that’s great, that’s—
That is, it does, up until the moment he feels Steve brush a kiss against where Tony’s hairline meets his forehead, soft and uncomplicated, but lingering, like Steve wants to stay there. To do
,” Tony chants, pushing against the hand on his neck as he moves against Steve’s face, shameless now, wishing he had a mirror to watch this in, because Steve is always gorgeous, but he’s never seen Steve with his face buried in Tony’s ass like he wants to live there, licking him loose and sloppy wet while Tony gasps against the mattress, trying to maintain enough higher brain function to memorize the feeling of Steve fluttering his tongue against Tony’s rim before sliding it past and fucking him with it and failing. Miserably. Gladly. Jury’s out.
It’s not a big deal when Tony texts him that afternoon to say there was a delay in scheduling the press conference—Pepper is in Tokyo and wants to be there in person to help with damage control. They’ll do it Monday. Tony offers to take him out to a nice dinner to make it up to him, and Steve couldn’t have said no if he wanted to (which he didn’t). He spends the entire meal trying not to fantasize about playing footsie with Tony under the table as he listens to him talk excitedly, animatedly about the latest updates to Steve’s suit.
except this particular morning, for some reason. because when he wakes up, Steve is already awake, which is par for the course—he's usually gone on a run, come home, showered, and made coffee by the time Tony has barely managed to crack an eye open—but he's just. in bed, lying on his side stretched out next to Tony, in a t-shirt and boxers (tragic), deep pillow lines on his face; he's got one of Tony's loose curls twirled around a finger, and usually Tony gets nervous when people watch him sleep, but with Steve he just feels safe, and protected, and—loved. Loved? Is that what it is? Is that was
The man’s words trail off as Duncan steps aside to let him through to his seat. Steve is standing—when did he stand up?—and realizes with a jolt (and an unmistakable, overwhelming
“Shh,” Steve hushes him with a soft, delicate smile that twists something in Tony’s chest. “It’s okay. You did so good, Tony. You were perfect.”
Steve reaches up with the hand he’s not using to play with Tony’s sweet, sloppy asshole to turn his face in for another breathtaking kiss, fingers gentle against Tony’s cheek as Steve licks him open, kisses him deep and thorough and hard until Tony’s lips are tingling tender and slick with Steve’s spit. He stays soft against Tony’s thigh as he kisses him, seeming to enjoy this on its own merits, Tony’s soft, panting breaths against his mouth, the quivering, messy center of him on and around Steve’s delicate, searching fingers as he pushes his come back into Tony and keeps it there, plugging Tony’s hole with the heel of his palm for a minute while he kisses every last coherent thought out of Tony’s head. Then Steve lets go, kisses Tony deep, fucking his mouth with his tongue as Steve’s come dribbles out endlessly over the backs of Tony’s thighs and pools between them on the mattress. Steve leans back to look and groans.
That gets a laugh out of Steve, finally, short and low and sweet. “Right in front of me, Shellhead.”
They watched that one together. Just him and Tony, early on, when things were still good. Tense, maybe—brittle, but good. Before Steve knew about Bucky, or HYDRA, or Tony’s parents; before Steve realized he did in fact know how to lie, but only when it came to Tony Stark. They’d drank good beer and talked gingerly around the subject of Steve’s adjustment to the 21st century; Steve couldn’t help but think of Tony when Indiana shot the swordsman, remembering what Tony had said on the helicarrier with startling clarity, the opposite of how he’d been thinking in the moment:
As Tony rights himself onto his knees, he hears running water and a long gargling sound, followed shortly by the sound of Steve spitting in the sink.
. “Listen to you, moaning my name. Think we should open a window, let the whole city hear you?” he says, using all that beautiful strength to push Tony back enough to get some leverage into his thrusts, really take advantage of his length and thrust into Tony long and hard and faster, faster, until Tony is moaning with every stroke like he’s dying, the only sound louder than the lewd
Then Tony realizes his own hands have come back up to rest on Steve’s shoulders of their own volition, and one of Steve’s hands has drifted down ever so slightly. It presses and Tony goes, stumbling forward until they’re chest to chest again.
Tony’s tongue cleaves to the roof of his mouth, cutting off his inhale and subsequent response. Steve stares as his warm hands migrate upward; so much has happened in the span of ten minutes, it’s dizzying. Tony wouldn’t be surprised if Steve is the only reason he’s still upright.
it, gorgeous like Steve said, because if Steve said it, it must be true. Never let it be said he can’t come around to seeing things from Steve’s perspective.
. “I think I could keep you like this all the time. Filled up with my cock, all loose and wet and open for me whenever I want it. I could come by anytime, slide right in,” he says, drawing his cock all the way out in a long, wet slide that Tony can
He’s so distracted by the man he doesn’t even realize Tony has asked him a question until Steve is being prodded—literally, Tony pokes him in the shoulder—to respond.
And then he made Bucky, who hadn’t cracked more than a smirk in the months since his rescue and rehabilitation despite Steve and even Sam’s best efforts,
“You’re it for me, Steve,” Tony whispers, trying to preserve that perfect stillness, “and that’s what scares me.”
Tony had been awake, and thank god for that. A little rattled from the impact, but he’d improved the suit’s systems after his last bad fall so that the armor absorbed shock and redistributed it as electrical power. That way, Tony said, the suit would recover faster, as would he. Hypothetically.
“You got it, honey,” Steve says, laying a kiss to Tony’s slack, drooling mouth before pulling out with a filthy wet
is a word they’ve ever used with each other. When he pulls back, Tony’s face shutters quickly, but even Steve can’t miss the look of pure shock there before Tony turns away. Maybe he can’t believe he said it, either?
“Please…” he gasps, groaning at the amount of lube Steve pours out onto his hand and smooths up and down the length of his cock, smears messily against Tony’s asshole and presses inside for good measure. Even the cool touch of the gel isn’t enough to chase away how burning hot Steve is between his legs, against his cock and his empty, needy hole; Tony jerks himself absently, mostly to keep himself loose and relaxed while Steve presses against him, nudges the thick hot head of his cock against his rim with a cool wet kiss before easing it in.
He’ll deal with stocks and the PR fallout (and Pepper’s wrath) tomorrow. Right now all that matters is the way Steve whimpers when Tony nibbles and tugs at his bottom lip and keens every so quietly when he swipes the tip of his tongue suggestively against that warm pink flesh, leaving it shiny and kiss-swollen for the world to see. When Tony gently pulls away, he can’t help but chuckle: Steve’s expression, dazed and slack and flushed past the collar of his shirt, is practically a neon sign that says
under his hands, strong and warm and just small enough to envelope in a hug if Steve let himself, if Tony wanted him to, and Tony
The way Steve’s eyes darken at that little remark is definitely something Tony intends to investigate further, later. For now, he leans into the hand now resting on his cheek and sighs.
Tony’s not okay unless Steve is with him, because Steve challenges him, Steve inspires him, Steve builds him up and makes Tony want to be the good man Steve somehow sees him as. In this scenario, he skips the question and kisses Tony breathless, instead, reminding him with his plush, pink mouth and a little bit of teeth that Tony
“Yeah, I do.” Tony squeezes his hand again, hard so Steve will look at him. He loves it when Steve looks at him—no one’s ever looked at Tony the way Steve does. He can’t even quantify it with words. There’s just Steve, and the way Steve
Steve crosses his arms across his chest to make himself feel safer, more contained. If he doesn’t, who knows where these ridiculous feelings might go. He feels silly enough as it is, blushing and stammering while dressed in his uniform, sans helmet. Even Tony’s probably wondering why he’s wasting his time talking to a red-white-and-blue fossil when he could be downstairs destroying Clint and the others at pool or showing the airmen around the tower, giving them the bells-and-whistles tour.
The coffee scalds when he drinks it, but the burn is good. It reorients the pain currently trying to wring the blood out of Tony’s heart, gives him something to focus on that isn’t this unbearable, overwhelming sense of regret. Heat to burn away the creeping chill that breaking up with Steve was the biggest mistake Tony’s ever made in his life.
he’d said softly, urgently but without force, waiting until Tony looked him in the eye to say what he’d been holding back for years and even then it was only the tip of the tip of the iceberg:
Tony doesn’t have to think twice. He reaches out and takes Steve’s hand. Something in him melts to see the nervousness fall from Steve’s eyes; an easy happiness taking its place the moment skin meets skin.
Steve doesn’t even have to use his Captain America voice to get Tony to do as he asks. By the end, it was like that all the time: Steve would ask, and Tony would oblige, and the ease with which they learned to communicate as a couple was unlike anything Tony could have hoped for, except for the part where Tony didn’t want to go public with their relationship and could never get Steve to understand
,” he says in a rough, low voice, growling out the last word like a swear. Tony arches against him to hear it, feeling the way it rolls out of Steve’s chest and into Tony’s. The iron grip on the back of his neck forces him to keep still, eyes straight ahead while Steve does something with his opposite hand—the one, Tony realizes, that has been on his cock this whole time.
—sweet nothings in Tony’s ear as he skims his big, warm hands lovingly up and down Tony’s back, over his shoulders to his neck, cupping his jaw and stooping a little to kiss him on the forehead…
Tony groans the moment Steve grins and says, “Home movies!” while revealing two armfuls of reels from behind his back, some of which are so dusty and small, Tony wonders if they’re Steve’s.
“What? Did I get some on my face?” he asks, retrieving his napkin and wiping his mouth with it. Tony makes a rough, strangled sound in the back of his throat and, when drowning it with wine doesn’t help, puts his fork all the way down on the table and buries his face in his hands.
to say, all of the potential—and potentially disastrous—offshoots this conversation could have. But as Steve’s learned over the years, planning out a conversation with Tony Stark before it happens is the definition of a fool’s errand.
Tony giggles at Steve’s huff, which is really a laugh disguised as exasperation, another one of Steve’s tics Tony knows by heart. The pain and joy of knowing that secretly splits Tony right down the middle—the joy of knowing Steve is a much bigger troll than anyone realizes, the pain of wanting to grab him and kiss him for it—but he hides it all with an elbow to Steve’s ribs and a muttered “jerk” under his breath.
“Want to watch you come on my cock,” Steve rasps, coming down on his forearms on either side of Tony’s head to speak right in his ear. His fast, deliriously hard thrusts never falter for a
His laughter comes out in a sharp burst, anxiety soothed away by Steve’s presence and the delightfulness of his wicked, whip-smart sense of humor. Tony muffles his giggles against the man’s shoulder as they turn and start walking down the stairs. Steve keeps him steady all the while, never allowing him to fall out of step, never letting his grip falter. Balanced. Safe. Secure.
in a single frame it’s a miracle he managed to think about debriefing or damage control or anything else related to the battle.
“I know you’ve got big shoulders, Steve, but you don’t have to take on my baggage on top of everything else.”
And no one—not even Tony—will know if Steve indulges himself by pretending, if only for a minute or two, that this actually
.” The image of regret, Tony starts pulling away, his tie still looped around Steve’s hand. “I’m super into you, Rogers. A truly embarrassing amount for a man my age. But I know myself, and I know my track record; what I don’t know is if the potential we
Tony has heard and seen Steve speak in front of angry mobs. Politicians. Royalty. Children. Intergalactic super-beings. Hydra. Nick Fury. Not once has he ever heard words come out of Steve’s mouth so confidently and with so much conviction. He says
He can hear Tony in his head again, a welcome rupturing of the tension that’s making it hard for Steve to even breathe, let alone think his own thoughts:
Steve tips Tony’s head back to look at him directly. Have Steve’s eyes always been this blue, this atoll-deep? A man could drown in those eyes if he’s not careful. Tony would go willingly.
. The overwhelming stretch is still there, shifting his muscles into new places; he’ll feel it all tomorrow, for sure. But it’s so worth it for the way Steve breathes against him, chest heaving, the way he presses a worshipful kiss to Tony’s sweaty shoulder before rolling forward, lowering Tony onto the mattress and following him down, never leaving the hot clutch of Tony’s body as he settles in between his legs and folds his arms over Tony’s head. Like this, Tony can hold Steve, too, tight against his body, and revel in Steve’s warmth, the perfect heat that radiates from him like the purest sunlight. When Steve kisses him, it’s soft, slow and sweet, a taste of lips before Steve thrusts again, deep and thick and steady.
It’s not a big deal, telling the press and the world besides that he and Tony Stark are not, in fact, engaged. It was a lucky shot, that’s all. They sit three feet apart and do not look at each other once in the fifteen minutes it takes to get the message across that Iron Man and Captain America are not in any way together.
,” he croaks, turning his face so he’s not being muffled, and tries to catch a glimpse of the man who just ate him out like a starving man at a buffet. He catches a hint of shine on the corner of Steve’s mouth before he’s got both of Steve’s hands grabbing and manhandling him onto his back like Tony is a featherweight. Which is impressive, because he’s not. He and Steve are pretty evenly matched when it comes to height, and while Steve’s definitely got more mass on Tony, Tony isn’t
“I—well, shit, what is any drunk looking for?” Tony bites out, a little more harshly than he intended, but it’s not like Steve’s plucking at a particularly
Steve turns around, and there’s Tony, flipping shut a panel high on the woman’s left arm with a smile. He pockets the pliers and drags the back of his forearm across his glistening forehead. Somewhere in the back of Steve’s mind, a saxophone is blaring.
Tony’s relieved, of course he is, but the knot in his throat starts to taste sour the longer he thinks about Sam waiting up at home for Steve while Steve fusses over Tony, who only has a concussion and a broken heart to show for having a building dropped on his head.
He’d swoon if he had oxygen to spare. As it is, Tony struggles for breath as he waits for Steve’s response.
“We’ll test that theory another time,” Steve husks before leaning forward to press a kiss to each eyelid. Tony hums happily, sinking further into Steve’s arms. “Can I carry you to bed?”
Slowly, thoughts of Howard, of hurt, start to melt back into the shadows. In their place is Steve, filling up all of Tony’s empty spaces with light, even some of the ones he didn’t know he had. For such a strong man, Steve is unbearably gentle, handling Tony the way he might handle spun sugar or thin glass. Tony has never felt so genuinely cared for, and the fact that he can’t pull back and thank Steve with a kiss smarts a little in the face of it.
“You’re still thinking too much,” Steve smiles, carding his fingers through the hairs on the back of Tony’s head. When he presses with a faint upward movement, Tony goes without a word of complaint, up over Steve’s thighs and down onto his lap, too riveted by Steve’s mouth so close to his to realize their cocks are barely an inch apart. “What about?”
. Capable only of making breathless, broken sounds of pleasure against Steve’s soft mouth while Steve pulls Tony’s leg up and fucks him sideways, every thrust deep and massive and twisting and
as Steve plows into him, sucks the skin of his shoulder and tells him how beautiful he is, how sweet he is to let Steve have him like this, fucked open and still somehow desperate for more of Steve’s gorgeous, heavy cock.
Steve goes from room to room up and down the compound, looking everywhere for Tony, for the suit, for any sign of life. It’s quiet for the summer, and Tony is impossible to miss, unless he wants to be. It happened like this not too long ago, Steve remembers, when Tony and Pepper broke up once and for all—Tony disappeared for days, radio silence, only reappearing when he felt like he was capable of showing face without cracking. He’d been in the tower under their noses the whole time, but Tony had made himself so scarce it was like he’d went and found himself a pocket dimension just to be alone.
But then, the image shifts into a sharper memory still, and Tony feels something old and awful claw its way from somewhere deep in his chest, remembering all too well what comes next. It tastes like bourbon and cigar smoke and the metallic taste blood leaves on the tongue after you’ve been smacked in the mouth. Tony’s hands fly out to clutch the sides of his chair and stick there; he can’t move them to stop the projector in time. It just keeps playing out, each frame worse than the one before.
Tony has never been one to look a gift horse in the mouth. When Steve tips his head to the right and kisses Tony like one of them is dying, hot and hard and openmouthed, Tony follows suit, throwing his arms around Steve’s thick neck and his legs around Steve’s hips, surging forward to kiss back and finally,
Steve closes the suitcase and nods. He tries not to think about Tony’s funeral. The way the first arc reactor Tony had ever built floated off on a wreath of flowers across the surface of the lake, quiet and all heart, the way Tony had been at the last.
, as much as any smile could. It dissolves something in Tony that his nerves had calcified, something elemental; he feels lighter in its absence.
It’s just stress, he tells himself. And nerves. A lot of those. But that’s to be expected, isn’t it? A few days ago he was doing the Lone Ranger thing again, and now there are two Spider-people in his living room, and Luke Cage is talking about moving his wife and unborn child into the tower.
, and he’s still bright red and tongue-tied when the chef personally brings out a heart-shaped chocolate soufflé drizzled with seedless raspberry sauce and dotted with gold leaf to congratulate them on their engagement. They eat it, of course, and Steve may enjoy listening to Tony’s delighted moans and gasps more than is appropriate. He certainly can’t help but reach out and wipe away a bead of raspberry sauce from the corner of Tony’s mouth when he sees it.
“I think all is clear,” Vision says smoothly, drifting forward with Wanda, who is visibly fascinated by the woman’s tattoo until she steps into the throng and sees something that makes her face fall.
Clint is already deep in conversation with the redheaded beanpole, who talks so fast it’s dizzying; Natasha is standing next to the third man, keeping her eyes forward, and together they watch Tony disappear back into his work, muttering things back and forth to each other, so quiet even Steve can’t hear.
Steve looks—he looks so fucking gone already, Tony thinks, flushed and panting, staring at Tony’s mouth, his chest, their hands moving on his cock, like
“I know he does.” Steve expression turns dour, then, a complete one-eighty from the face Tony had been looking at a second ago. “I’m sorry,” he says. “Did anything else happen? With Hammer?”
“We’ve got company, Tony.” He knows Tony can hear the reporters through the receiver, but the cursing on the other end of the line confirms it.

, Tony thinks, giggling to himself only for the sound to cut off when he hears Steve’s jacket hit the bedroom floor. Suddenly, he needs to turn around; he needs to
Tony picks up one of Steve’s hands and starts unwrapping the bandages from his bout with Natasha, over and under and between the knuckles and back again like a dance.
“Honestly,” he continues, shamefaced, “I didn’t think Captain America went in for that kind of thing.”
Steve just hums, licks the burning bruise on Tony’s neck before bringing a hand up to cradle Tony’s jaw and turn his head toward Steve. Tony goes willingly, because of course he does, and it’s worth it, because he’s seen Steve Rogers in a whole host of states: angry, vengeful, depressed, happy, but he’s never seen him like
Coupled with the fact that Tony would much rather be at home in the tower with Steve, and his nerves surrounding recent developments with said supersoldier, it’s any wonder that he’s still willing to go on that stage and stump for a charity that definitely spent more money on this event than on—Tony peers more closely at the name of the foundation on the pennant—
He’s so preoccupied with holding all the disparate parts of himself together and hiding them so Steve can’t see, he doesn’t notice Steve’s hands start to rub his back in long, soothing strokes until Tony is half-melted in his steady arms, weak-kneed at how comforted he feels. Steve doesn’t say anything—just keeps moving his hands, up and down Tony’s back, across his shoulders, along his arms, and over again. He can’t remember the last time someone touched him like this, without motive, ulterior or otherwise; his skin feels warm down to his toes.
, Steve,” Tony breathes, drinking in the sight of dazed, sex-flushed Steve Rogers like it’s his own personal art exhibit, bought and paid for and his for keeps. It’s a dizzying sight, sweet and a little bitter.
Tony’s lips are yielding and taste faintly of wine and carpaccio piemontese. Kissing him feels more right than Steve could have imagined (and he’d imagined a lot, elaborately and often). One peck and he knows without a doubt he could kiss Tony for hours. But that’s all besides the point. The point is now,
There’s a give and take to it, just like everything they do together, on the battlefield and off. Giddily Tony reminds himself
Tony smiles and gives him one more lingering kiss, promising more with touch than words could ever hope to because now, at last, he can.
) that this love was one-sided. Watching Steve’s eyelashes flutter and his Adam’s apple jump, feeling the restlessness of him under his hand, remembering the desperate way he’d shoved Tony up against the bathroom door earlier just to begin making up for lost time—it’s like looking through a window at his own heart. Both of them: the blue and the red.
Steve chuckles. He pats Tony on the shoulder as he walks by, wanting to get out of Tony’s immediate vicinity before indulging himself in ways that may or may not involve some very
He must manage okay, because the look that passes over Tony’s face is the same one Steve’s seen in the mirror a thousand times since the day he realized he was halfway in love with Tony Stark: wonder, one part lost, one part found.
There’s nothing stopping him from slowly pushing his hands under the front of Steve’s now-untucked T-shirt to stroke the hard plane of his abs. Tony preens to see Steve’s eyes flutter dazedly at the contact.
Steve muffles his hitching breaths against Tony’s shoulder, trying desperately to compose himself even as he falls apart. He’s failing, but can’t bring himself to care. Tony returns his embrace haltingly, like he can’t believe it’s happening, but then neither can Steve.
Tony had said to him once when he’d found Steve awake in the communal kitchen at 4 AM, too riled by a nightmare to go back to sleep. At Steve’s confused look, he’d smiled—kind, soft,
After the funeral, Bruce sends him back with the stones. Clipping branches takes time, but it’s hardly tedious: First he returns to Morag, walks past Quill’s prone, snoring figure, and returns the Power stone to its place in the timeline.
Should he tell them the truth? Or does he reinforce the fantasy he’s been happily living in for the past few days? Natasha will see right through him, either way. By the look on her face, she already does.
“Look at me, Tony,” he says, as if Tony’s not already drowning in Steve’s eyes, but then his meaning becomes clear when he presses and drags his massive cock, hard pressed against the zipper of his jeans, against Tony’s ass, and Tony’s eyelashes fucking
“Glad to hear it!” Tony almost shouts as he pivots back to his coffee, pressing down on the plunger too soon, but he’s so harried by being there in the kitchen with Steve on his first day back to worry about a weak brew.
“Seriously, barely two minutes in and you military guys are at it like frat bros at a kegger.” Tony looks sidelong at the woman, who rolls her shoulders with a pop and a groan. “How
, and then plunges back into Tony’s waiting body with a groan that shakes Tony to the core—and again. Tony squeezes his eyes shut to hold back tears but he can’t stop the way his body thrashes under Steve’s, the way his moans pour out of him like he’s drowning in pleasure, because that’s what he is. Drowning. Falling. Hard.
For some reason, the first thing that pops into Tony’s mind is Robin Williams, of all people, standing on a stage in front of a giggling James Lipton, wearing a pink scarf like a prayer shawl and asking, ‘
Steve keeps walking, offering Vision a quick, distracted wave in lieu of a response before disappearing down the main hallway leading to their staggered suites. He walks past Bruce’s door, past Natasha’s and then Clint’s, wondering all the while what he’s supposed to say to Tony versus what he
Tony falls into it, Steve’s kiss, the hard, kneading hand on his ass; his own erection catching against the duvet is practically an afterthought. He just wants
“Careful, Steve,” she coos, “keep talking like that and people will start to suspect something’s going on between you two.”
“Nat, most people who consider themselves friends would say they like each other. We’re not special.”
Tony drops his sleeve and leaves the bar empty handed. He’d meant to order a scotch, but he’s too preoccupied wondering where Steve’s gone to bother going back for it. It’s not important, anyways. Given the choice between Steve and alcohol, Tony would choose Steve every time.
“Not at first,” Steve replies immediately, a fond smile spilling out of him when Tony looks up. “Not until I realized I was the only one being left out. Even then I wouldn’t call it ‘jealousy,’ more like...envy.” With the hand not on Tony’s waist, Steve makes slow and patient work of Tony’s fingers, just touching—feeling the battle scars and soldering scars and myriad other workshop scars Tony’s incurred over the years, then tripping upwards over his cuff to run up under his forearm, lean and firm, over his elbow, behind his shoulder; Steve holds him there and leverages himself closer, chest-to-chest with Tony, and wishes he could feel the arc reactor pressing against his sternum. But feeling Tony’s racing heartbeat, the nervous hitch in his exhales—he can live with that.
“Really? Because I’ve all but designed a ring for you in my head over the course of this conversation, and that’s enough to scare
“You fall, I’ll catch you,” he whispers before dipping in for a proper kiss that floods Tony’s head with incandescent light. It’s chaste and measured and
“Later,” he says, leaving Tony’s wrist to reposition his legs for him. While Steve works, pulling Tony’s legs out and down and open, Tony swallows down the burning need to beg Steve
“What are you talking about,” Tony smirks, “I kiss everybody. If anything I thought you’d be the one to tell me I should kiss people less.” He comes to a stop between Steve and a nearby armchair, which he leans against as he drinks, all lazy legs and elbows and what Steve has come to (obsessively) suspect is a deceptively strong body.
“Steve, I’m—oh, God, I’m getting close,” he breathes, rocking up to cling to Steve’s head and mash their mouths together in a graceless kiss that’s more teeth than lips, but it’s so hot, feeling Steve like this, panting against his mouth as he fucks his thick, slick fingers in and out of Tony’s fluttering hole. The pressure is right there behind his groin, deep in his pelvis, buzzing and terrifyingly close. He hasn’t come untouched since he was at MIT, young and soused and fucking anyone who’d have him, but with Steve it’s easy, too easy, to let go like this. And really, if anyone could break that particular streak, it’s Steve.
Steve thinks to himself as he does it, but it’s not his voice he hears. It’s Tony’s, because only Tony would see a dangerous, precarious situation like this and make a pop culture reference.
“I’ve got a few minutes to spare,” Tony replies, ignoring JARVIS’s indignant beeping. “Have a good talk with Lady Capulet back there?”
“I think we need to compare our respective strategies,” Natasha says, taking Wanda’s arm on her way to greet the other woman. “This is Wanda; I’m Natasha.”
And god, is Steve ever fucking him. Relentless, so damn thick, bussing his prostate on every withdrawal only to drive against it on every return thrust, intense, blinding pressure and deep, throbbing heat, so deep inside him. He’s so hard, cock pulsing against his belly as Steve fucks him, but he can’t touch himself. If he does he’ll come, and he wants so much more of this. He never wants it to end—Steve being so deliciously dirty, talking like a goddamn sailor and fucking him like it’s his job, ruthlessly sweet with his hands on his skin, pinching his nipples, squeezing his cheeks as he thrusts long and deep into Tony’s ass.
“Not to you, it isn’t,” Steve counters, and there’s not much Tony can say to that. “I’ll talk to the team. They might have questions, and you shouldn’t have to answer them. Not tonight, anyways.”
“Not that I don’t love a good makeout session,” Tony says, pulling away from Steve’s mouth disdainfully, “But I thought you were gonna fuck me stupid?” He’s happy to continue to let Steve drive but he’s helplessly curious all the same. The question is just a little
that is Steve’s huge and heavy cock covered in come, gripped in a loose fist and still, unbelievably, hard. Tony licks his lips and thinks again about how much he wants that in his mouth, as much as he can possibly fit, suck Steve off with all of the mastery he’s acquired over the years and make
Because of course Steve can see his pinched expression, even in this dim light. Steve sees almost everything. Key word: almost. But Tony is so wrung out, if he so much as glances at Steve right now, he knows he’ll give something away. Steve will see one of Tony’s little fantasies playing out behind his eyes and that’ll be it for this witching hour rendezvous routine Tony’s come to enjoy too much for his own good.
Paramedics rush in even as Steve bows his head to Tony’s chest, palm covering the arc reactor in a vice as they try to pull Tony away from him. They’re trying to move him away gently, but Steve is inconsolable, throwing hands and spitting mad, all but launching himself at anyone who dares put a hand on Tony.
Everyone—Bruce, Thor, Natasha, Clint, Bucky—has been on the receiving end of that particular display of Tony’s affection. Never untoward, never aggressive: Tony knows how to read people, (“It’s part and parcel of being an effective businessman, Cap”) so he knows when to leave well enough alone, like after Natasha’s been going at the heavy bag for an hour and the angst is pouring off of her, and it’s never anything more than a peck to the cheek or the forehead. Chaste, brushing, affectionate.
Tony is insatiable when it comes to debauching Steve, he’s learned—quite thoroughly—over the past few days. Not that he minds, because he’s not exactly keeping his hands to himself right now, either. They’re pretty evenly matched in that department. But he’s
Their last battle had brought down one of Dr. Strange’s colorful enemies, along with an entire wing of a children’s hospital. It had been vacated for construction at the time—Tony wouldn’t have let them get anywhere near it had it been occupied—but a lack of casualties doesn’t negate the fact
anymore, Steve’s got him so blissed and fucked out, there’s a good chance he’s not even going to be able to wake up tomorrow, let alone
“Ah, well, welcome to the octagon!” Clint says with an easy smile, stepping forward to shake hands and say hello like a normal human being. Natasha gives Steve one of her looks before she and Sam follow him into the living room—
and now Tony's got his whole face smushed into Steve's chest, because he's lowkey (not lowkey, not even a little bit) having a crisis/meltdown and Steve is happy to wrap him up in a hug and hold him there in bed with all the lights off as the morning rain comes down outside.
“Oh, God,” Tony moans, distantly aware of himself like he’s left his body out of pure overwhelm. Steve is pressed against him, hot and long and so fucking thick, Tony has to put his hands on him to believe it. He takes Steve’s moan into his mouth with a smile of his own when his fingers wrap around Steve’s cock, and fuck, they barely meet, he’s so thick, all the way around, hot and slick with precome, enough to smooth the way when Tony decides to push down, down, all the way to the root, knuckles brushing the golden thatch of Steve’s pubic hair before he pulls back up. Steve pants against Tony’s mouth, ragged little noises of want leaking out of his beautiful, unblemished throat, his eyes burning through Tony’s as he works Steve’s cock with both hands, arching up into every push and down into every pull, his ass brushing Steve’s thighs on every twisting pass of his palm over Steve’s weeping slit.
“He reminds me of Steve,” Bucky tells the room when young Tony is shown with a replica of Cap’s shield, posing triumphantly to the sound of Jarvis’ delighted laughter. Jess aww’s.
“I’ve got you, sweetheart,” Steve whispers, and that little brush of his thumb against Tony’s belly absolutely
, and even Tony can tell Steve is pained by the change of address by the way his fingers clench around the towel in his hands. “You?”
Steve in particular notices the way Tony looks, because he’s developed a bad habit of doing that over the past year and change, and he’s kind of helpless at this point. Tony’s backlit by the afternoon sun, preoccupied with whatever he’s doing with the strange woman’s arm to distraction, and Steve can’t be judged too harshly—anyone with eyes would drag theirs over the exposed muscles of Tony’s arms, the shift and flex of his shoulders, the firm taper of his waist, the pronounced curve of his a—
Tony flings his arms around Steve’s shoulders, gasping hotly every time Steve pulls away to reorient himself and moaning every time he returns, mouth falling open further to let him in deeper, longer. When Steve buries his fingers in Tony’s hair and tugs, Tony shivers and his legs—which had wandered up around Steve’s hips at some point in the proceedings—go slack. His moans turn high and strained until he’s all but keening wetly against Steve’s soft, gentling lips, a heady contrast to the fingers dug in against his scalp. Steve tugs again, rumbling approvingly when Tony whimpers, and then keeps going. He buries one hand in Tony’s hair, plants the other on his ass, and kisses him until Tony’s mouth is slick and tender and open, swallowing every last one of his increasingly desperate little noises with encouraging groans that vibrate against Tony’s ribs.
“D’you think Nat and Clint placed bets on whether or not one of us would cancel?” Steve asks. Tony laughs outright. Not for the first time, Steve watches Tony break out into a smile and wonders if the heat he feels is a blush or the fact that looking at Tony when he’s grinning like that is like looking at the sun—bright and dangerous and so unbelievably
himself, more like, until he’s leeching Steve’s body heat for his own and chasing his hot, unhurried tongue with his.
“God, how are you still such a horrible liar, Cap? Is there something in the serum that makes it impossible for you to keep a good poker face?”
And all the while Steve holds Tony’s tie in his hand, smooth silk secure against his skin like a promise that needs to be kept.
But tonight Tony is dead on his feet, eyes bloodshot from strain and fatigue and very likely a minor panic attack, and instead of giving Steve a rundown of his evening (he had a great story about a famous actor falling headfirst into a fountain and everything), Tony finds himself slipping into thoughts he usually saves for when he’s alone, of a timeline in which the island disappears and in its place is Steve, and he is as desperately in love with Tony as Tony is with him.
Tony stoops to pick up and pocket what looks like a dissected nine-volt battery. Steve kind of wants to ask, but he’s too distracted by Tony’s ass in those black Levis to ask any cogent questions.
process, but just seeing the photo the first time had been enough to put Steve in a bit of a state, and he’s still trying to shake that off. It’s not real, after all. There’s nothing to be in a state over, period.
Steve tells himself he shouldn’t be surprised or disappointed when Tony pulls away, breaking Steve’s hold without effort. The deed is done. He almost wants to crack the joke,
But like everything else in Tony’s life, he’s happy to take what he can get. And if it’s Steve Rogers offering to fuck the need for alcohol—however briefly—out of his head, then Tony is hardly going to complain. But he will hurt, tomorrow, and the next day, and every day after this point, because Steve is going to give him a perfect memory and then leave him to face the future alone.
, Tony thinks with a glance at his watch—a one-of-a-kind Roger Dubuis he only takes out when he’s feeling particularly exposed. Vulnerable. Its parts and pieces tick and move together in perfect synchrony, twin tourbillons keeping to the rhythm of 4:4 time. Skeletonized, they call this design, because among the many intricate moving pieces one can see straight through to the beating heart of the thing.
. If Steve brushes a finger over the empty space where a ring should be before he lets go, that’s for him to toss and turn over later.
Steve squeezes his hand. “I’m sure she’ll get some decent mileage out of the gossip once she picks her jaw up off the floor.”
“I’ll handle it,” he says. He’s taking a page out of Tony’s book here, winging it where he’s used to planning. Bucky was proud when Steve told him his half-cocked idea to go back in time to be with Tony Stark, however Tony would have him.
“Is that okay?” Steve asks. Like he didn’t just fuck Tony to within an inch of his life. So sweet, his Steve; sweet, and hot, and dirtier than Tony could have ever guessed, could have hoped for, the evidence of which is still leaking out over his thighs. “I’d like to stay. With you.”
, you loved each other. it wouldn't have hurt nearly as much—felt like a piece of you being ripped away, phantom pain aging you inwardly until every step in any direction that wasn't toward Tony was agony—if you didn't.
, and Tony knows without having to ask JARVIS that the focus of the attack was on Steve and Sam, whose location was just broadcast to the entire world.
Steve likes how tight he is. He likes his noises. He touches Tony so carefully even as he talks the dirtiest stuff Tony’s ever heard, keeps himself steady so Tony can writhe away, further down onto his hot, hard, girthy cock until Tony can feel the thick base of him push past the traitorous ring of muscle and
“I think he has,” Steve sighs. At Natasha’s quirked eyebrow, he crosses his elbows over his knees and sighs, “He doesn’t kiss me.”
,” he keens, grabbing and tugging at the man’s jacket with fumbling hands until it finally comes off enough to hang from Steve’s wrist. He knows they need to talk more, like adults, but the lid has come off the pot and they’re both boiling over. Tony can’t remember the last time he felt this goddamn
, fuck,” Steve hisses, finally breaking that perfect resolve with a curse, and God, isn’t he gorgeous when he curses, Tony thinks, kissing the word right out of Steve’s open mouth.
“Hey, heart-eyes! Next reel!” someone (see: Bucky) shouts. Not for the first time, Tony’s glad to be concealed in relative darkness back here—even Steve’s enhanced vision won’t be able to make out the blush Tony’s knows is all over his face right now. He also gets a reprieve from sitting so close to Steve, hyperfocused on his warmth and all of the sensory trappings of home that come with it, while he swaps out the old reel for a new one. New-er, rather. He doesn’t look at the case or look at any frames before feeding it through the projector.
“Candygram for Mongo,” Tony chirps as Thunderball takes a running start at him. He brings him down with a power-dampening electric net, which drops him like a sealed sausage onto the cold basement floor. Bulldozer is next, rushing Tony on his left flank while his hand is down. Classic mistake, thinking that just because Iron Man’s gauntlet is down he’s defenseless: Bulldozer takes a swing and clips Tony’s shoulder, which only unbalances Tony for a moment before he recovers and fires a volley of flares right into Bulldozer’s masked face.
, but that sounds too cruel. Steve is caught somewhere between floating and crashing when Tony returns, slipping his hands under the hinges of Steve’s jaw. He must be able to feel as much as see and hear Steve’s gusting sigh of relief, because the next thing Steve knows, Tony is pressing another kiss to the knitted space between his eyebrows.
“Sure, PJ—you just wanted to see what real Air Force muscle looks like,” the man grins, flexing his barrel chest hard enough to strain his shirt. Sam guffaws and gives him a friendly punch to the shoulder, which the man returns in kind with a fist to the kidney.
“Mr. Stark was about to come looking for you,” comes the serene reply. “I’m sure he’ll be pleased not to have to make the trip.”
“Y-you first,” Tony gasps, voice breaking around a cry when Steve responds with a thumb against Tony’s fluttering rim. It’s
in a nutshell, isn’t it? He wants too much, and in his wanting he loses everything, every fucking time.
, Tony thinks, who does Steve think he is, being this hot and this sweet all at once. What is Tony supposed to do—
The response to the first part of this fic was so overwhelmingly positive and supportive, I felt it necessary to write a little follow up chapter. I hope it satisfies! Happy new year!! xx
“What—what is this,” he gasps against Steve’s lips when the other man pulls away to let him breathe. Steve moves a hand under Tony’s ass, clasping a handful and squeezing,
The food is delicious and borderline excessive, coming in wave after wave along with wine and bread and cheese and free courses compliments of the chef, and by the second hour of their meal even Steve’s increased metabolism is starting to feel sluggish. Of course, that’s when Duncan places a massive, beautiful, steaming bowl of rigatone alla vodka on their table. The smell of it alone is enough to rouse him.
But then he’d put Tony to bed and left. So maybe Tony isn’t the only one to blame for his current inability to step foot in the living room. Maybe, if Steve had stayed that night, and if they’d talked the morning after, Tony would know where they stood now. Which would be great, because not only does Tony miss his best friend-turned-maybe-lover worse than anything, he really needs to ask Steve a favor.
a full thought anymore. Steve really did it—he really fucked Tony stupid. Now all that’s there in Tony’s head is
“I won’t ask how it all went,” they whisper conspiratorially, “but do tell me one thing: is Bruce alright?”
Steve, having caught his own breath, tips his head forward with a sigh. Expecting-slash-hoping for another window-fogging kiss, Tony closes his eyes. He huffs a high, breathless moan and opens up for it, arms around Steve’s neck, panting humidly against his mouth.
Just the thought lodges a cluster of something uncomfortably prickly in his chest. Steve puts his coffee down and massages the heel of his palm against his sternum to try to ease the anxiety blooming there.
“How have I never seen these before?” Steve whispers, leaning closer as he does. Tony swallows hard against the shiver that ricochets down his spine hearing that low voice in his ear.
. And sure enough, Tony is looking at him like regret is the last thing he wants to be feeling, and yet…: “You coming in here, looking and talking like that...I’m not gonna lie, I’ve had a lot of wet dreams that started like this. Problem being, I always wake up from them alone, and if that happens for real this time, I don’t know how well I’ll be able to handle it. Not without putting a lot of distance between us, literally
is there, Steve buries his face against Tony’s neck and hugs him closer still. “God, I missed you so much.”
“And you liked it,” Nat smiles. “Seems I didn’t get as good a read as I thought, though. Once I realized Tony couldn’t go anywhere without you or your eyes following him, I couldn’t un-see it. Kind of surprised he hasn’t caught on.”
“I missed you too,” Steve says. Tony blinks but still can’t really see straight. Those bricks really packed a wallop. “Rest, Tony. I’ll be here when you wake up.”
They stay like that for a minute, maybe two, breathing each other’s air. Steve can’t even open his eyes. He wants to, but his brain feels disconnected from his body, his whole nervous system tuned to Tony and only Tony, who stands there and holds him like he isn’t the busiest, most famous man on the planet; like he doesn’t have anywhere better to be than kissing his best friend because he
natural and easy doesn’t mean that seeing Steve Rogers in a tux and knowing he’s going to peel those gorgeous clothes off that stunning figure later isn’t a
“Hey! Sorry, I tried to keep it to the lab, but these guys wanted to see where the Avengers hang out, and I couldn’t say no.”
Steve stands up and steps forward a handful of paces until he’s barely two feet from Tony. He’s still warm from sparring, his shirt clinging to his back even as the front dries to a smudgy grey. He’s plenty nervous, yes, but Tony can barely look him in the eye. Tony’s hands fidget wildly with his cuffs, his tie, the second button on his two-button jacket, and he looks literally anywhere
The blood rushing in Tony’s ears drowns out the sound of voices past and present. All he can see is Howard filling the frame in that horrible tan suit, gripping a bottle of bourbon by the neck. The image catches on young Tony’s terrified expression, the way he hides behind the shield that’s almost as big as he is. He watches his own mouth move—
he can’t even muster the energy to be mad when Steve uses the pillowcase to wipe the lube from his fingers.
The man is too busy looking for something in Tony’s eyes to respond. Whatever it is, when Steve finds it, he smiles bright as the sun, grinning like Tony has given him something infinitely precious.
“Me,” Steve says gently, scratching his palms with dulled fingernails. “They’re strangers, and they’re in our
It gets caught in his chest the moment he sees himself filling up the screen, young Tony standing alone in Howard’s office, having perched the camcorder on the big oak desk to record himself with Cap’s shield—the real one this time, not a toy. On screen, Tony has his back to the camera, the vibranium shield clutched in his too-small hands. He has to perch it on the floor, its weight just enough to counterbalance Tony’s, but holding it…even now, he remembers the thrill of that first time. The cool touch of vibranium humming under his fingers, the knowledge that he was holding his hero’s greatest treasure…his adult fingers clench against his thighs at the memory.
It’s like Steve knows where to find and how to switch on every last one of Tony’s spots to get him buzzing like a live wire. “
“Tony!” Steve’s voice comes through loud and clear and audibly relieved, which melts some of that frozen terror still lodged in Tony’s chest. “124 5th Avenue—we managed to lure the Crew down to the basement, but—” Steve’s report cuts off with a startled, agonized cry. Tony curses and heads for the address, flying right through the front entrance (which isn’t really an entrance anymore so much as a giant hole in the wall) and dropping down through the gaping hole in the center of top floor all the way to the basement. The Wrecking Crew did some heavy damage in a short amount of time, as is their way, but Tony isn’t worried about the bill right now.
doesn’t know where that came from. They both stand there for a moment, staring at one another like deers in each others’ headlights. Tony’s eyes are a bright golden brown, and Steve is locked helplessly in their orbit as he inches another step forward.
, like Tony is weightless, his own personal fuck toy. Every thrust hits that spot inside that makes Tony’s voice do funny things, makes his vision go a little fuzzy around the edges and his mouth water. It’s so hot, Steve fucking him like this, but all he can get out are variations of
“At least ten, no more than thirty. If he passes thirty he has to come and talk to me.” Steve pushes himself up onto an elbow and shakes his head. God, he needs to change out of this shirt, it’s so saturated with sweat it’s gone from blue to black. “Anyways, what’s your point?”
It’s not the same as getting blackout drunk when the shit hits the fan, but a good 72-hour uninterrupted workshop binge should just about do the trick.
with mutual restraint, tastes faintly of the buttered popcorn Steve ate earlier, and the only way it could be better is if it never ended.
, like the past six weeks have done exactly what Tony dreaded and hoped they’d do when he broke up with him, like Steve’s had time to finally breathe freely, spread his wings a bit, experience the world in ways he never got to with Tony when they were together.
“You always do,” Tony says. He won’t look at Steve, even though they are sitting an inch apart from shoulder to knee and breathing the same air and have been fake-engaged for going on half a week. “Sorry if I worried you, Cap.”
And, god, when did Steve ever laugh like that with Tony? Sometimes he got close, coming up with little
, hard and fast, taking Tony’s briefs and socks and shoes with them, incredibly, until he’s left in nothing but a black Henley, spread-eagled on his own bed.
The four are all of remarkably different builds and backgrounds, not a similarity between them: an African American man, no taller than Steve was before the serum, sits on the couch; a white man, thin as a rake and twice as tall, is reaching for a glass of water on the coffee table; an Asian American man, whose shoulders are somehow even broader than Steve’s, stands rigidly next to Tony, arms folded across his chest; and the lone woman, whose glossy black hair is wound tightly in a bun at the back of her head. Steve notes the beautifully elaborate
, Rogers holds out his hand, palm to heaven. Steve’s stomach tightens painfully to remove the device from his hand, but he thinks of what’s waiting for him downstairs, and letting go has never been so easy. Rogers holds it like a bomb waiting to go off, wary and fearful, but excited, too.
“Gotta admit, you’re doing wonders for my ego right now.” Tony’s low, wry voice brings Steve back to the present. The present, Steve thinks, is warm and close and very,
This was the moment when Tony, so tender and impressionable even at that “advanced” age, learned what his father really thought of him.
On the one hand, she means well. She knows Steve is lonely for companionship in ways his friends and the Avengers can’t satisfy. She might even know about his crush on Tony and this is her way of trying to help him past it. On the other hand, Nat is a notorious troll, and she could just be doing this to him for laughs. But it
you kiss his scarred fingers, with their fresh cuts and scrapes and bruises from working in the shop, with a reverence. you draw baths for him and don't join, even though it's one of your favorite things to do in the world, because you can just tell Tony is going through
“I’ll buy you a new one,” Steve replies, gaze never straying from Tony’s mouth. “I wasn’t about to stop kissing you,” he husks, and then he’s proving his point, laving Tony’s bottom lip with the flat of his tongue before slipping it between his teeth and pulling Tony in for a kiss that makes him keen, helpless against Steve’s sweet, perfect mouth, those slow, soft passes of Steve’s lips against his, so lulling and so good it makes Tony want to cry, because this really is everything he’s ever wanted. Steve in his arms, in his bed, taking up space in his life the way he’s been taking up space in his heart for years.
Then he’s rearing up, hips still pistoning, and grabbing Tony’s left arm, then his right. Tony’s head collapses against the bed as Steve folds his arms across the small of his back. “Right there,” Steve says, squeezing Tony’s arms with one massive hand for emphasis. Tony grabs hold of his elbows and braces himself against Steve’s thrusting hips, moaning wetly into the sheets as Steve fills him up again and again and again, deep shuddering thrusts from tip to base, so thick and unyielding Tony can’t not give way to it, can’t not feel the warm, spiking pleasure of orgasm pulling him higher, closer to something he can’t fathom but wants, desperately, enough to keep his hands to himself and drool into the sheets as every one of Steve’s bone-shuddering thrusts nudges the tip of Tony’s cock against that wet spot and pings his prostate simultaneously until Tony is tingling all over, fingers flexing helplessly against his own elbows.
, Tony…” Steve taps Tony’s sweet spot once, twice, three times, gets him to squeeze his cock just so on ever pass, and then Steve gasps and comes, mouth smearing a sloppy kiss against Tony’s neck as he spills inside him again, hot and thick and so beautifully much. Tony works Steve’s huge cock as best he can, milking him for all he’s worth, until Steve is trembling, too, pressing sweet kisses to Tony’s lips and holding him close against his shuddering body, filling him up until Tony can feel it leaking out around Steve’s softening cock, which pulls out of him with a filthy, thick, slurping sound and a telltale feeling of something slick and hot slipping out of his hole and down his balls to coat his thighs. Tony can’t even muster the wherewithal to
against him, so much so that Tony can feel the absolute monster filling out the front of Steve’s pants even as Steve dips his head down to press a searing kiss against a deceptively soft spot under Tony’s ear that Tony refuses to admit makes him weak in the knees.
,” Steve gasps, kissing Tony’s mouth tender and open and wet, fucking it with his clever tongue like he’s fucking Tony’s ass, punishingly gentle, inescapably deep, scraping Tony’s moans off his loose tongue with his teeth and then biting his lip before kissing him again, kissing him breathless and insensate before he starts hitting that spot inside Tony again, over and over, pummeling his prostate even though he knows, they
Bruce has joined Natasha, standing apart from the rest to talk to her and her new friend. Steve stops to say hello, as is only right, waiting until he’s entered the man’s line of sight to do so. Only then does he realize that the man has no line of sight, because both of his eyes are prosthetic.
The rattling has settled somewhat, but Tony still has to rely on Steve to tell him when to breathe and how deeply. He forgets, sometimes, that Steve has experience dealing with panic attacks, which so often came before an asthma attack. Steve once told him that even years removed from his sickly days, he still remembers what it’s like to lose that grip on reality, feeling the heart too acutely as it beats against too-brittle ribs.
Steve reaches out with his other hand and holds Tony by the wrist. Stops him a few inches shy of the button.
they got the stuff out of Dr. Foster—maybe Thor didn’t even know, since he’d been having a conversation with his mother at the time, according to Rocket’s later recounting of events—which means Steve is left standing over a sleeping stranger with a syringe filled with dangerous miasma with no clue what to do.
Tony yanks Steve’s pants down with a groan. “God, I can’t wait to marry you,” he says, then gets to work.
, it’s impossible to move an inch and not feel him. It’s liable to make anyone lose the run of themselves, even someone with an indefatigable brain like Tony’s.
he shrugs. “It used to be booze; now I sublimate the urge with tech benders. It’s a win/win for everyone, when you think about it: I don’t drink, and the Avengers get new toys.”
When Steve speaks again, he’s much, much closer, and Tony wishes like hell that that didn’t make every single hair on his arms stand on end, that the low baritone of Steve’s voice didn’t make Tony shudder and want to bend himself over the counter. That part of their relationship is over. He has to
Tony is still laughing gleefully (while Steve’s burning face is still buried in his hands) when Duncan arrives with two oversized menus. Steve waves at Tony when he offers to order for them, too embarrassed at having learned that Tony knows about the D.C. incident to speak for himself, at least for the moment. Besides, Tony knows everything he likes. (Well, almost everything.)
He turns around as the door clicks shut. Steve stands there with a hand on the knob, staring at it like it holds all the answers to every question he could ever hope to ask. His jaw is tight; for all that Steve looks impeccably put together right now (Tony has to stop his eyes from repeatedly dropping to look at Steve’s ass in those slacks), his energy is all over the place. Not nervous, not anymore, but…wary. Gun-shy. If it were anyone other than Steve Rogers, Tony would call that full-body tension
Tony laughs, then groans, remembering as his lungs contract the fingers still lodged in his ass. Steve slips them out with a beatific smile, the smug bastard, but at least he takes care not to trip on Tony’s prostate on the way out. Mercy, indeed.
it would take Tony to get with the program—that program being Steve Rogers, and Steve's feelings for him, and the fact that when Steve says "I love you, Tony," he actually means it. because honestly, on what planet?

him, pressing him into the duvet with the full length and breadth of his body and sealing his lips over that same spot on Tony’s neck as before, purpling the bruise even deeper and darker with his hot, humid mouth while Tony gasps and moans against the bed.
The Sanctum Sanctorum is remarkably unscathed despite being surrounded on all sides by Chitauri carcasses and broken alien tech. Dust from the rubble and ash permeates the air so thickly it’s like trying to breathe plaster of Paris without a mask. Steve coughs as he knocks on the front door, grateful all over again to be cured of his asthma.
Finally, Steve makes his way to the rooftop. Natasha’s vegetable garden is flourishing in the open air, which smells distinctly of fresh herbs and flowers. The sun is hidden behind clouds at the moment, but Steve can still see Tony clear as day: sitting in the same T-shirt-and-jeans combination from last night, plus a suit jacket to ward off any chill, on a bench. Behind him, the ill-advised extra large gazebo Tony had insisted on during construction stands mournfully empty, a gaping shadow looming over the man in a way that makes Steve deeply, profoundly aware of how
It started small, as these things do: a flutter of excitement whenever Tony’s name appeared on his phone on a text or incoming call, usually while Tony was still in flight between the city and the compound (“
“Grab lube!” comes Steve’s voice from the bathroom, muffled slightly like he’s chewing on something. Lucky for Steve, Tony’s legs still work; he moves up onto his knees and reaches across to the bedside table, tugging open a drawer and rifling around for the bottle of lube he knows is in there. (Hedonism, thy name is Tony Stark.)
Tony huffs a laugh, shaking his bowed head like Steve just told a bad joke. “What brought this on, all of a sudden? I mean if you’re touch-starved, Thor is always good for a bear hug.”
kisses like—not how Steve thinks Tony wants to be kissed. So Tony works his own magic, dropping his head back with a soft moan, trusting Steve to keep the hand on his jaw steady, and then arches forward, rolling his body against Steve’s in a long, sinuous wave.
Steve is slow to answer. When he does, a minute or so later—the longest of Tony’s life, he’s pretty sure—it’s with a gentle hand against Tony’s sternum, below the arc reactor, nothing but the barest touch of fingertips to naked skin. Tony shivers, his cock twitching even at that chaste touch. He looks up at Steve from his place on the bed and shivers harder, thighs dropping open ever so slightly, on instinct, at the voracious expression on Steve’s handsome face, the slick shine of his own saliva all over his lips and nose and chin.
He’s in a SHIELD recovery room. Nothing is immobilized, which means nothing’s broken, which is a relief. He can hear and see, but his head hurts like a building fell on it.
Tony steps forward and Steve opens for him without prompting, legs spreading so the other man can stand between them. Steve’s often wondered what it would be like to be the sole focus of Tony’s attention in a moment like this—it’s heady enough in everyday life, being on the receiving end of that intense gaze, all of the blistering intelligence that lives right behind Tony’s eyes on Steve as they discuss tactics and after-action reports and what the other wants for dinner. Now, as Tony stares him down and slowly unravels his own tie from Steve’s slack fist, Steve can’t even imagine
,” Tony groans, hoarse and needy, throwing his head back against the sheets as Steve presses that last little bit forward, pressing him wide,
He doesn’t hear Tony’s answer to any other questions after that, but he is acutely aware of Tony’s warm and steady [left] hand on the small of his back guiding him into the tower to safety.
If there’s beeping, Tony thinks, he must be in Hell. That’s the only possible explanation for it. It doesn’t cross his mind that he’s in a hospital until he hears a sound like a relieved gasp somewhere out there where the world isn’t pain and nausea and everything spinning in the wrong direction.
“Bit of a downer, I know,” he says lightly, staring up at the ceiling, hands hovering undecidedly on either side of his head.  “You can just turn me back over, I don’t mind.”
,” he says, like Tony is a revelation. When Tony glances at him, Steve’s eyes are wide, blown black, his expression a little dazed. “Does that feel good, Tony?” he asks. Tony moves his hand, nodding, sucking his lip into his mouth only to release it with a groan when Steve pulls his fingers out to graze Tony’s rim oh so softly.
,” Tony says. He hasn’t touched his pasta. The fork is just kind of there in his hand, like he’s forgotten he’s even holding it. Steve looks at him again.
It kills him that even if he has no idea who this woman is, it doesn’t change the fact that she’s right. Mostly. Kind of. To be fair, up until very recently Tony Stark-plus-friends was a zero-sum equation—Rhodey and Pepper and Happy being preciously rare exceptions to the rule. Tony had had to
“Honestly?” he says, looking away from Steve’s eyes to stare at their joined hands, where it’s safe, “I mostly keep swinging between ‘pinch me I’m dreaming’ and ‘don’t wake me up if I am.’ And you can’t really blame me—I spent years wanting that night,
When Steve pulls away, folds his arms across his chest, cold air rushes back in, dousing whatever inappropriate thoughts Tony was thinking of having before they can materialize. Tony assumes the conversation must be over. He offers Steve an awkward half-smile and goes to reach for the button for the workshop floor
Face to face now, it’s hard to ignore the familiar ache of want that shadows most of Steve’s interactions with Tony nowadays. Hair in sweaty spikes, purple under the eyes, blood crusted in a jagged line above his eyebrow, Tony somehow looks awful and gorgeous at the same time, and Steve wants, god, he
after all, that Steve is happier not dating Tony—it’s why Tony broke up with him in the first place. Steve was miserable, and now he’s not. Mission accomplished.

him, his girth, how wet he is. He can feel it alright, just like he can practically feel his own heartbeat in his rim, throbbing against the shining head of Steve’s dick. For Tony. Everything is so slick with come and lube already, Tony is surprised Steve doesn’t just slip right in, easy and deep, but Steve still takes a moment to retrieve the bottle of lube that had rolled away somewhere over by the pillows earlier. He pops the thing open with a
“Sounds dreamy,” Tony sighs, reaching down to cup his half-hard cock and biting his lip when he does.
The Time stone flashes a vivid green from the safety of its cradle of dense foam inside the carbon steel suitcase, which Steve holds out to the Ancient One like one would a box with an engagement ring inside.
Steve feels something flicker to life inside his own chest. It’s faint, but glows steady. Only he can see it, feel it; only he knows what it means.
Tony feels lightheaded; his thoughts are sluggish, and he probably looks like he just went ten rounds with an angry leaf blower, but he can’t bring himself to care. He can’t do much of anything except blink dumbly at Steve and stroke the broad planes of his back through his T-shirt, but Steve seems okay with that. He seems

Steve shifts, his heavy blue jacket lifting from his hips as he raises a hand and rests it on Tony’s shoulder. Even at arm’s length, Tony can feel the heat radiating off the man, as bright and infectious as the day they met.
, Tony is never going to forget that as long as he lives. He’s not going to forget Steve’s fingers, either, holding perfectly still inside him now as Steve brings himself off fast and hard, chasing Tony’s orgasm with his own like he can’t let Tony be the odd man out. The sounds his fist makes as it flies over his cock are lewd and filthy and

But what steals the show isn’t the bad guys being paraded out into the waiting SHIELD trucks, still immobilized by Tony’s tech—it’s Steve, carrying Iron Man out onto the street in a bridal carry while Sam waves bystanders back. Both of them are covered in dust, but Steve catches the camera’s particular attention: it zooms in on his dusty face, which is streaked with crisp lines of tears as Steve lowers Iron Man onto the pavement and rips off his faceplate. The camera is too far away and there’s too much ambient noise to hear it, but Tony can see Steve’s mouth shaping itself around Tony’s name, can see him gritting his teeth as he begs Tony to wake up and cries all the while like his world is ending.
“It’s alright, big guy. Party’s over,” Tony chuckles into his ear, nervous, patting Steve on the shoulder from under his arm in an awkward bend. “I’m fine, I promise." He does the unthinkable, then, Tony: he steps back and takes Steve’s hand and lays it flat against his chest so Steve can feel the strong thud of his heartbeat and the low, steady hum of the arc reactor at the same time. “See?” Tony says with a quicksilver smile, “alive and well.”
—of sex to an already deep and intensely bonded friend + partnership. it works, and Tony is happy, but he still struggles to believe it when Steve says "I love you."
Tony laughs. “Steve, that’s not your job. Besides, I’ve tried replacing booze with sex, and it’s really only a quick fix at best,” he says. Something dark flashes in Steve’s eyes at that, the same way, Tony realizes, they did when Tony had mentioned
“We’ll see about that, Shellhead,” Steve says, flexing his thighs hard and fast so Tony almost bounces up off of them and pressing two dripping wet fingers into Tony’s empty hole as he comes back down.
noises. He earned them, he said. And who is Tony to deny Steve what he wants? He never has before. He can’t. So he comes on Steve’s perfect fingers, shooting all over Steve’s abs, his huge, leaking cock, trembling bodily and gasping for breath as his orgasm rolls through him bright and hot and perfect and Steve tells him he’s
But before Tony can scamper off, Steve steps back into the hall and pivots crisply on his heel to face him. Tony gawps, wordless, as Steve looks him up and down through the pristine glass with a burning look and a knowing smile that screams
, because those are Steve’s eyes falling to Tony’s lips, bright with realization and hope, blue as fire, blue as the light of Tony’s exposed heart—
Steve tamps down the urge and rage long enough to present Pierce with the last stone. The look that flickers behind Pierce’s shrewd blue eyes is telling enough—Steve could punch
before. Sure enough, Steve is moving in closer in response, his grip on Tony’s body tightening noticeably, promising in a way that sends something deliciously,
that made Steve throw his head back and guffaw, but that beaming smile and the way his laugh booms and echoes across bustling 5th Avenue is unlike anything Tony ever saw when he and Steve were together.
Tony’s breath leaves him all at once. He hates how wet it sounds, shuddering on the way out and hanging in the empty air between their bodies. Steve cares
. He looks even more excited when Steve approaches, leaps to his feet and doesn’t even balk at the fact that Steve is a head and change taller than him and a superhero—he just steps right up to Steve and jabs him once in the shoulder with a grin.
“Uh-huh.” Planting herself next to him, Natasha prods Steve’s shoulder with a bare toe. “How many times do you think he’s texted you since we started sparring?”
But he was a coward, and now he’s watching footage of Sam on a date with Steve play on a loop while vapid, boneheaded commentators speculate about their relationship.
“Hah?” Tony breathes, still wincing slightly from stepping on the magnet. “Oh yeah. For Bucky, when you find him. Ow, mother
After a week apart, Tony worries about that night in the kitchen being a fluke. Steve seizes the chance to set the matter straight.
“Sir, there are reports of an attack on 5th Avenue,” JARVIS announces. Dread drops a block of ice down Tony’s throat, so cold and horrible it almost freezes him in place.

The footage unspools, harmless—albeit embarrassing—at first: it’s a home movie from when Tony was young, no more than eight or nine. He’s wearing what looks like the remains of what was once a nice suit, something his parents forced him into, probably, but devolved into undershirt and slacks and suspenders hanging down past his knees. He really was a gangly kid, wasn’t he?
It’s also his first day back in the city after spending the past six weeks in Malibu, “to make sure SI feels equally loved,” as he told the team at their last group dinner (while pointedly ignoring Steve sitting across from him at the table and the fact that even then he couldn’t
Steve comes up onto his knees and holds Tony’s raised hip with one hand, keeping him steady on his raised lap as he babbles hot nonsense into the humid air, talking about how hot Steve is, how gorgeous, how much Tony wants this. When Tony feels the blunt, fat head of Steve’s cock kiss against his stretched hole, he keens, words dying on his lips. Steve holds it there, just pressing, letting Tony
if there ever was one. Steve bats his eyelashes in response, because of course he does. Unfortunately for Steve, Tony is mostly immune to that tactic by now.
, his brain is still in the process of rebooting. Because of the kiss? Because Tony admitted he loves him back? Who knows. That’s for Future Tony and Future Steve to discuss. Right now, there’s a beautiful, dumbstruck man with the bluest eyes staring at Tony like he hung the sun, the moon, the stars, and possibly the International Space Station—and that’s not an opportunity he intends to waste.
but even though Tony says it back, and he does, every time, even when you're yelling at each other after a battle goes "tits-up," thank you, Logan, he has this look in his eyes, and the only word you've been able to put to it is
“Come on, Tony,” Steve purrs, stretching his head and neck up to press hot, open-mouthed kisses to Tony’s jaw, his neck, his chin, his collarbone, so sweet and gentle and whisper-soft where his fingers are hard and driving, deep in his ass, glancing against his prostate, “ask me nicely.”
The dissonance doesn’t make sense. But it does put hope in Steve’s heart where there wasn’t any before.
Tony husks a laugh. When the coughing subsides and the ice chips ease a path down his throat, he says, “I’ll probably always have them. The press is awful and it’ll only get worse. Just means I’ll need you to reassure me more often.”
At 5:56, Steve glances at his watch and takes a sip of water, opting to watch the bubbles in the champagne glass rise to the surface and pop instead of drinking it outright. At 6:08, the same waiter refills his water glass. They make small talk even as Steve fidgets under the tablecloth. In all of his gearing up for this blind date, the thought had never crossed his mind that the other person might be the one to duck out.
Rolling his hips, Tony presses a kiss to Steve’s neck and holds on, whimpering when Steve instead slows to a stop. Thick and heavy and deep inside, Tony can feel Steve
“It is normal-people sleeping hours, to be fair.” The neon green microwave clock over Tony’s shoulder can testify to that.
He shrugs. Smiles, easy, the way he couldn’t when he was Rogers’ age, fresh out of the ice and soul-broken, hopeless.
“Feel that?” Steve asks, breathing hotly next to Tony’s ear. Against Steve’s hand, Tony nods, never breaking eye contact, even as Steve slowly pushes his own hips down to drag what is unmistakably the thick, blunt head of his cock up and against Tony’s balls through his jeans. “Tell me you feel that. Feel me.”
there, the worry writ large in those beautiful blues, but he’s relieved to note that Steve isn’t disappointed in him. He’d see it if he was. The frowny face is cute, though.
Sitting down isn’t working. Steve doesn’t want to intimidate Tony, he just wants to...get the point across...that this isn’t about Thor, or being touch-starved, or any other rambling excuse Tony can come up with on the spot. This is about what Steve
longer than he’s wanted anyone in his entire miserable life—it will hurt so much to have it and then watch Steve leave after.
“I’ll still make an exception in your case, Staff Sergeant,” Steve replies, shaking his hand, “for not saluting a ranking officer.”
“I was planning on holding out a little longer and make love to you properly, but you had to play keep away for a whole week,” he says with a hard thrust that rattles the door. Those chinos aren’t exactly dense, and Steve, apparently, decided against underwear today—even through his jeans Tony can feel the hot swell of the head of Steve’s dick as it bumps and drags against the length of his. Tony muffles a cry against the black cotton of Steve’s T-shirt, biting down and relishing the incredible, gut-churning
Before he can finish that sentence, Steve’s arms are coming around him, biceps pressing in on either side of Tony’s ribcage, warm hands splaying out against the middle of his back, and his chin is being tucked against the spot where Steve’s long, beautiful neck meets his mountainous traps.
, Steve reminds himself as he opens the door to the restaurant. He’s immediately enveloped in dark tones of bluish green and the smooth voice of Frank Sinatra. He’s early, but the staff brings him through immediately to an intimate but decently large corner table in the back. A waiter, bald-headed but sporting an impressive mustache and wearing the hell out of a purple three-piece suit, pours Steve a glass of champagne and another for his date, who’s starting to cut it close, time-wise.
If it weren’t so late, Tony would make a joke out of that, something clever and just this side of lewd, because he’d feel like it and it would make his night to see Steve blush. Those lips and those cheekbones that fair skin are so criminally attractive in their own right, but a flush of rosy pink to top it all off?
“Top of the line!” Tony smirks, saluting Steve with his Phillips Head. “Nothing more high tech in any of them than a heart rate monitor and some other odds and ends—no rocket launcher eyes, don’t worry. I kept my baser urges in check with these.”
Warmth spreads from Steve’s fingers through Tony’s shirt and into the skin high up on his back between his shoulders. Steve can probably feel how fast Tony’s heart is racing, but spares him his overt concern and instead keeps telling Tony what he’s going to do before he does it: a hand on Tony’s forehead, an arm around his back, asking JARVIS to turn the lights down to thirty-five percent.
Tony can’t even muster the energy to balk at his own nakedness in light of his deliriousness as every last thought in his head is pushed out of alignment by Steve’s sweet, hungry mouth. And then there’s Steve’s nakedness, the hard, hot planes of his perfect body against Tony’s, the slightest slip of sweat already easing the way between them. But Steve’s hands stay on Tony’s back. He doesn’t move to take Tony’s cock in hand again, or even slip his fingers into Tony’s wet, loosened hole; he can feel Steve’s spit on his rim, cooling in the open air as he sits spread out over Steve’s massive, muscular thighs.
Steve has just enough brainpower left to remember that 1) they’re surrounded by onlookers, and 2) if they keep going like this, Duncan’s going to have to throw them out.
Tony’s expressive mouth is slack with surprise and Steve wants to know what it would feel like against his. When the elevator doors open, it slams to like a gate. Recovering quickly, Tony gives him one of his trademark smiles and gestures at the empty elevator with a flourish.
“I don’t kiss you because if I did I don’t think I’d be able to stop,” he says, more confidently than Steve anticipated. His left hand free, Tony moves on to Steve’s right, glancing up now and then as if to check that Steve’s still paying attention—like Steve can think about anything other than every brief brush of Tony’s long, dextrous, calloused fingers against his hand and wrist, or that sheen at the base of his perfectly arched throat. And then Tony’s words hit him and Steve’s lungs
, he’d said, quiet so only Steve could hear, like the whole city was listening in and Tony wanted to keep this moment between them.
Nope, he’s definitely still a bit hysterical, but Steve hasn’t let go of his wrist. His expression is mostly concerned, possibly even a little bit hurt. Tony’s heart sinks against the side of the arc reactor casing: is that hurt his fault? Of course it is. It always is. How could it not be?
at what must be an absolutely mesmerizing sight, based on the devastated noises spilling out of Steve’s mouth with every short thrust into Tony’s loose, wet heat.
in sparkly gold letters against white ceramic—another one of Natasha's inspired birthday gifts) on the island counter and sighs. Again. The marble under his hands is cool to the touch, now, he notices, not warm like he remembers. Tony has to remind himself that it had been warm because he’d been sitting on it long enough for it to leech his body heat, what little of it hadn’t been going into Steve.
Turns out, every late night host has a joke written for the Cap/Iron Man union. The Avengers laugh at every single one of them. Steve’s neck aches from the effort of not looking at Tony, who sits next to him on the couch in silence the whole time.
When Natasha plants both hands on either side of his face and makes him look her in the eye, Steve realizes with cold-blooded dread that she’s not kidding.
Tony finishes his meeting with the clean energy consultant—an engaging, exciting discussion about bringing arc reactor tech and associated jobs to underserved communities in the mid-west and Appalachia, for starters—just in time for a text from Rhodey:
Tony can’t talk, but he can make those noises Steve likes so much, moaning around Steve’s tongue as he sucks it into his mouth, gasping out little broken noises on every long, powerful thrust of that huge cock inside him. He wheezes when Steve speeds up, drops his head onto his shoulder and cries out as Steve smacks his other hand to Tony’s ass and hauls him up and down, slow and deep and dirty, holding him down to spread him out on his thick base before pulling him up, teasing his sore, slick, prickling rim with his fat cockhead before shoving him back down on it, filling Tony up with one shuddering thrust.
Steve sips his coffee, staring at the picture splashed luridly across the front page. Anyone would have rushed to him to make sure he was okay. It’s what teammates do—they watch each other’s backs, pick each other up when they fall. It’s normal. Totally normal. Any teammate would have collapsed on their knees at Tony’s side and pried the faceplate off while crying his name like a prayer, the way Steve did yesterday.
feel the beast in Steve’s pants where it’s pressed up against his ass—but he’s off of him enough to take off his t-shirt, which Tony can tell by the rattling of dog tags on the ball chain that never leaves Steve’s neck. And then Tony feels hands reach under his hips and grip the waist of his jeans and
“Not far,” Tony replies. Steve grunts, pulling back. “Too far—” Steve kisses the words out of his mouth as Tony says them, one hand splayed across Tony’s cheek to hold him there. It’s like burning, this—wild and instantaneous, a hot glow flaring in the fraction of an inch of space between their bodies. He wants to tear off their clothes and live skin-to-skin with this man, fuck him and taste him and know him and—
“Hey,” he finally manages to respond, even as he ducks out of Steve’s path toward the kitchen to make coffee (he’s already had a cup, but he needs to busy his hands and have something to look at that’s not Steve’s perfect fucking face). “California’s the same as it ever was. Rhodey says hi.”

Tony pours the hot water into the press and watches the grounds float up and swirl around in the dark.
He’s not wearing the armor, but he might as well be for how heavy he feels all of a sudden, fatigue calcifying the marrow in his bones. Tony’s knees start to give. Exhausted by a working day spent at SI, an evening spent kowtowing with people he’d sooner jettison off the tower than invite in, and now thoroughly beaten back into his sad little corner of unrequited love, Tony shakes his head, wobbling slightly when he pushes himself away from the island. He sets his eyes on the still-open doorway and definitely not on Steve, who stays perfectly still while Tony shuffles past him.
as Steve plants his massive hands under Tony’s thighs and lifts at the same time Tony hops, walking them back over to the island and dropping Tony with a soft bounce on the marble counter. Stepping between Tony’s spread thighs, Steve drags him forward with a low growl and kisses him openmouthed.
Tony licks and kisses and bites a roadmap across Steve’s neck and throat, leaving bruises that’ll heal all too quickly on his shoulders and the sweet, bulging join where his shoulder meets his neck. When he nibbles on Steve’s earlobe, Tony is rewarded with a hard, hot gasp in his ear and a thrust so hard he about loses one of his fillings,
, to see the expression Steve’s currently wearing, now that the rush of pleasure from Tony’s kiss is simmering below the surface of everything: giddy, predatory, hungry, horny, lovestruck, and a little bit stupid with happiness. The mirror image of Tony’s, if he knows himself at all.
you really thought the moment you kissed Tony the first time—you were sitting next to him on the living room sofa, a whole empty seat on either side of you because you were so unnecessarily close together, but then you were struck by the thought
Reducing Tony to an object just so happens to be one of those sore spots. Steve knows he’s hit a nerve when Tony’s eye twitches, his mouth thinning ever so slightly. Any moment now he’s going to turn on Steve, hit back with some smart-ass remark about
By 6:20, the back room is filled and noisy with other dinner guests, many of whom are also on dates and are doing a

a command, and Tony tells himself that that doesn’t do anything for him—“when you used to drink. What were you looking for, at the bottom of the bottle?”
It’s a short distance for his hands to travel, up from Steve’s heaving chest to his neck. For all that Tony was the one crying a minute ago (and he might very well be on the verge of tears again—jury’s out), Steve looks like he’s not far off, himself, bright eyes noticeably wet.
Leaning forward to kiss Tony is the shortest distance Steve’s ever had to travel to feel a sense of belonging. Soft and careful, Steve brushes their lips together once, twice, and when Tony’s mouth parts, he moves in a third time and stays there, kissing Tony until the tension rushes out of him with a sigh that Steve swallows without a second thought.
Even Tony, with his unenhanced ears, can pick up on the scandalized gasp that escapes her when Steve says it.
“I’m here, sweetheart. I’m here.” Steve urges him to eat some of the ice chips with gentle nudges of the cup against his mouth. Tony obliges him, because of course he does. The water soothes his sore throat and clears the fog from his brain a little, enough to get a better sense of his surroundings.
Tony stands at the island, elbows on white marble, rubbing his tired eyes until little white lights start to sparkle in the black. The pressure is fantastic, and the sheer relief of it is enough to pull a quiet, pitiful groan from deep in his chest.
Helpless, overwhelmed, Tony sits on Steve’s hand and jerks his hips, chasing that impossible pleasure to its peak, moaning against Steve’s mouth as loud as he wants, because those are
Tony strolls around the corner into the kitchen, still pink from a shower, wearing a cheap white T-shirt and expensive jeans, humming a classical song Steve recognizes but can’t remember the name of off the top of his head. Even at this sorry moment, Steve is helplessly enamored with the awesome scope
Oh, that’s cruel, Tony thinks, already blinking away tears and biting his lip again to stifle the heartbroken moan he feels building in his chest behind the arc reactor. Steve can’t say things like that, pet names and promises, when he doesn’t mean it—at least, not in the way Tony wants him to. Because if life was fair, Tony would tell him everything, how much he wants Steve every day of his life, how much he wants Steve to be
Steve turns off the TV with a sigh. “It’s been playing nonstop for almost twenty-four hours,” he says. He won’t look Tony in the eye. “I’m sorry.”
So he forgives himself for forgetting, in his not-so-subtle idolization of Captain America, that Steve Rogers has also been around the block a few times since he got de-thawed. Which is why Tony squeaks a little when Steve uses that firm, unyielding grip he’s got on Tony’s body to press him up against him,
“Please,” he whispers, hand softening on Steve’s chest. He never wants this moment to end, being held in the soft safe circle of Steve’s powerful arms, never wants Steve to stop looking at him like that, like this is everything
At first, Steve thought he had to learn how to toe the line of Tony’s ego. Every conversation would devolve into shouting the moment Steve brought up Howard or the suit or Tony’s past. Steve’s learned a lot since those early days, like how it’s really about learning Tony’s sore spots—the hurt, vulnerable places of him that he keeps so carefully hidden—and knowing when not to push them, if at all.
Looking back on it now, those six months were just stolen time, a pocket-life Tony knew he’d never get to live out to its fullest, but he likes to think he took advantage of every second of it.
And, Christ, has Tony thought about kissing Steve Rogers. A lot. A man can fit a fair few fantasies into the span of a decade, after all. But here he’d thought he’d imagined them all: post-battle snogs, sweet and lingering kisses under sprigs of mistletoe; hell, he’d entertained more than a few iterations of their wedding day kiss at the altar. But this: this hot, almost devouring kiss, Steve’s hands firm on his hips, lifting him bodily without struggle and keeping his feet a few inches above ground, is beyond anything Tony could have ever imagined.
The elevator dings, announcing their arrival, at the same time Tony drops his hand and Steve surges forward, taking up the dedicated space between them that’s been there for years and that Tony has never called into question until this exact moment, because one minute he’s ranting about how he’s trying not to let his need for a drink get the better of him, and the next he’s got a mouthful of Steve Rogers, whose arms come around him and
The team settles in with enough snacks to put a rhino in a coma while Tony and Steve head to the back of the room where the vintage projector Tony pulled out of storage for the occasion awaits.

Tony looks down, can’t help it: Steve is just so gorgeous, massive where he hovers above him, and Tony gasps when he sees the absolute work of
Tony wouldn’t be the first to admit it—he wouldn’t be the third or the fifth or the fiftieth, even—but he’s a very physically affectionate person. For a man who doesn’t like being handed things, he loves using his hands to show his fondness for others. He has his little touches, arm pats, shoulder squeezes, handshakes; hugs are almost exclusively reserved for Rhodey and Pepper (Happy, Steve’s learned, isn’t a hugger), but no one is exempt from being kissed when the mood strikes Tony Stark.
, but that’s not what they’re discussing right now. Pushing his misplaced feelings aside as has become the norm recently, Steve watches Tony—bruised and tired and favoring his left side following their latest battle against Doom—stand up and disappear FRIDAY’s projection of the image with a flick of his wrist.
, Tony thinks, leaning his forehead against Steve’s, but it wouldn’t be the first time the thought has crossed his mind.
Tony had looked out over the city, not gloating or smug the way Steve had assumed he would be when they first met and Steve learned billionaires were a thing that existed—quite prevalently—in the 21st century, but wistfully, like he couldn’t believe he had the view at all.
The words—carelessly indifferent as they are—pierce Tony like rebar. As his stomach sinks somewhere around the vicinity of his feet, the woman’s words circle round and round in his head like the gears in his watch:
“Not if you don’t mean it,” Tony whispers, inches away from the long swooping bow of Steve’s mouth, hands bracing the hard column of Steve’s neck where he can feel the man’s pulse leap under his palm. Their foreheads tip forward and connect, breaths comingling in the half-dark. Voice thick, Tony says, “I can’t—I can’t, if you don’t mean it,” and he’s tired, so tired of waiting, tired of touches with no meaning, tired of holding his breath when Steve’s in the room, tired of keeping this love to himself. But Steve’s right in front of him, standing tall and broad and looking for all the world like a man on a mission.
—the way Tony’s fingers twitch against his scalp when Steve tightens his arms around the other man’s waist, the way Tony suspends them in that first kiss like a highwire artist. Steve is
. Steve’s footsteps, meanwhile, are coming closer, and the only thing concealing Tony at the moment is a literal glass door. He picks up his champagne glass with a silent curse. Run away now, he tells himself—save face and find Steve after the speech. He’ll pretend he doesn’t know about this little conversation on the balcony, that Steve didn’t admit to
Tony’s first thought is quite tame, he’ll remember later. He thinks, wryly, that Steve is just making sure Tony goes to bed instead of going to the workshop. That he’ll order Tony under the covers and wait until he starts snoring to leave. Because Steve is a bossy mother hen, and this week has been rough on all of them, to say nothing of the past year. It wouldn’t be the first time.
“You’re the worst,” Tony wheezes. When he looks up, Steve is grinning down at him, skin and hair and eyes beautifully aglow in the light of the chandeliers. He looks like something out of an angel’s wet dream, or maybe a Renaissance painting, or a particularly stunning line of code.
, hard and hot and massive inside his abused, fluttering hole, pulling out with a thick, sloppy wet sound to run his length across Tony’s asshole, smearing his come over Tony’s too-sensitive perineum and his hot, puffy rim with a groan that sounds like it came straight out of the earth before plunging his heavy cock back inside with a hoarse shout that makes Tony’s traitorous heart skip a beat. It’s so good, so hurting and so deep, slow and deliberate where Steve was rough and fast and hard and wild before; this is just for Steve’s pleasure, this time, and there’s something liberating about that, being soft and spent while Steve fucks him again, pinning Tony’s hands above his head in a rough, unbreakable grip even as he’s works Tony over, so sweet and gentle with his motions, paying special attention to the squeeze of Tony’s rim around the hot, blunt head of his cock, pumping himself there, thumb spreading Tony’s cheek so he can
. Of course any mention of New York is enough to puncture a hole in the moment. Immediately Tony is clamming up, laughter dying a sudden death in his throat.
“—but I have a…” and, oh, is that a blush starting to creep its way up Steve’s neck? Forget fried rice,
did Tony miss that look for so long? How could he have mistaken it for anything else?), “why were you staring holes in the back of Clint’s head when I walked in?”
Tony wants so much. Too much. Asking Steve for this would tip things precariously toward the latter. But the question is taken out of Tony’s hands the moment one of Steve’s perches itself under his jaw and tilts his face up.
me—this is what Tony Stark is all about. And he would never be able to live with himself if he disappointed Steve in bed. Not after all the years the man has had to deal with hearing about Tony’s sexual prowess.
“Shh,” Tony breathes, hushing him and kissing as he goes—Steve’s temple, Steve’s jaw, the flat bridge of Steve’s nose, his forehead—until Steve is grabbing helplessly onto the back of Tony’s jacket just to hold onto something and keep from shaking apart.
reboot (so many science critiques you didn't understand a lick of but you are more than happy to play audience to the things Tony cares about, loudly) when you leaned forward and placed a lingering kiss on the corner of Tony's motormouth, which apparently was all the invitation Tony needed to crawl into your lap and press his warm, warm,

Tony fingers the end of it absentmindedly as he scouts the room for the man in question. There are hundreds of people milling about, holding fine crystal champagne flutes like college sophomores at a frat party, talking out their asses about nothing, and Steve is nowhere in sight. Tony huffs as he leans back against the bar. Here he was, hoping to whisk his new—

) in both hands and tries to collect himself. “Wait, just…wait,” he breathes, thumping the man’s sternum gently for emphasis. When he finally looks up, Steve’s face is inches from his, lips wet and parted and waiting, but that’s not what gives Tony pause.
The scene is typical for Avengers work: rubble, some smoke, a few busted Doom Bots in pieces on the ground. They’d managed to keep the damage nominal and localized, thanks in part to Tony corralling the bots to the North Lawn. But keeping a tight perimeter meant they’d all been at a higher risk of getting hit, and Iron Man had been hit hard. And when Iron Man goes down, he goes down harder than almost anyone on the team.

in the early days, and their friendship seemed more like a minor miracle than a natural result of time and proximity and genuinely liking each other as people. But after Steve put those helicarriers in the Potomac, when Tony found him on the shore and bridal carried him to the nearest hospital (Tony gleefully showed him the pictures and cell phone videos later)—when the hard and ugly truth of Tony’s parents’ deaths spilled out and left them both hurting and vulnerable and raw—things changed.
like he’s got the chills. Steve just rolls with it, taking every shift and judder of Tony’s body in stride, his tongue never leaving the tight furl of Tony’s hole; if anything, he presses his face
Tony can feel Steve’s come frothing around his hole as Steve fucks in and out of him, slow and leisurely, all that spunk smoothing the way for Steve’s bulging cockhead to spread and press against his hole before he slides all the way in to the root, filling Tony with the whole massive length of him in a single thrust that tears a broken wail from Tony’s throat, squeezes more tears from his hazy, unfocused eyes.
Younger, smoother around some edges and sharper in others, beautiful like a sunset and a sunrise rolled into one—an astronomical anomaly of the rarest kind. The
“Death would have been preferable,” comes the reply. Steve doesn’t have to go far to remember Tony’s slack, expressionless face, how sickeningly
his prostate now, hips flying, and Tony is scratching him, leaving long red marks all over Steve’s back and shoulders, but Steve doesn’t seem to mind. If anything, his own noises get louder, deeper the more Tony marks him. And Tony is lost in sensation, barely capable of higher thought; all that comes out of him are high, breathless, fucked out noises of pure
“Welcome back!” Steve says with a bright smile, wiping sweat from his brow with an end of the towel hanging around his neck. “How was California?”
you make,” he rumbles into Tony’s mouth. If he is making noises, Tony’s too busy having a nuclear brain meltdown to notice, let alone care. Steve kisses the same way he plans an attack: deliberately, precisely, patiently; he knows when to grab Tony by the back of the neck and hold him there and when to let him go, when to rasp his tongue hot and heavy against Tony’s and when to give him the long, steady pressure of both lips against his until they’re both gasping for air.
Steve picks at his wraps as Tony ushers him inside with a wave, flicking away glowing projections with snaps of fingers and wrists like a conductor to his symphony. Steve can’t even marvel at the display like he usually does. Every nerve he has seems to have gotten caught in his neck and throat, a crawling, aching sensation that makes it hard to breathe. Things like asthma attacks shouldn’t be possible with the serum, but of course, anything that has to do with Tony could never be
“Thanks,” he says, scraping the word like so much sand off his tongue. “No need to stay up any longer for my sake. I’m just gonna polish off my ill-gotten dinner and head to bed.” Tony picks up his fork and pokes around inside the carton of fried rice but doesn’t dish any of it into his mouth. Just thinking about Steve and all the ways he can’t have him, plus the shit that happened earlier tonight, and his appetite is all but gone.
Tony wouldn’t be standing in the kitchen with him at three o’ clock in the morning if he didn’t—but Steve’s care is universal when it comes to the Avengers. He’s vigilant in his need to know his people are safe. He’s the man who checks in over comms moments after the bad guy goes down to make sure they’re whole (Natasha), who texts the hardest hit two days after the battle to ask if they need more ibuprofen (Clint), who boils enough water for two pots of tea without having to be asked (Bruce), who volunteers himself to spar when the clear blue sky outside the tower suddenly goes dark (Thor).
They’ve known each other long enough, been in enough battles together, played enough Mario Kart together, that Tony doesn’t even register Steve cursing. He’s too caught up in that blush, and the push and pull of Steve’s muscles under his T-shirt, and all the other words coming out of Steve’s mouth.
, his heart beating somewhere up between his ears, he thinks, and the only thing keeping him anywhere close to earth is Tony, whose name he hears in his head like a mantra:
“Knew you’d be so good for me,” Steve murmurs against his neck. Tony is slipping—he almost doesn’t hear it. “You’re so sweet like this, aren’t you, baby. That’s it,” he says, scraping the back of Tony’s neck with his blunt fingernails, “ride my fingers, just like that.”
“There’s almost no daylight between you guys,” Natasha tells him during a sparring session at the compound, a blank observation coupled with a ferocious jab. Steve blocks it, openhanded, and pulls right; ever the acrobat, Natasha cartwheels in tandem with the motion and lands back on her feet without blinking. “It’s cute.”
So Steve waits, breathing evenly, until Tony braves the journey from staring at his collarbone to looking Steve in the eye—only then does Steve smile with all of the affection and patience and admiration he has for this one-in-a-billion man. Steve watches Tony swallow air, a sheen of nervous sweat gathering at the exposed notch at the base of his throat; when Tony reaches out, Steve holds perfectly still, the way a person would trying to rescue a stray cat. Patience. Patience. Be open, be gentle, be soft.
before surging forward to press Tony against the door and oh good, that’s Steve’s hand on his ass, palming the curve and digging his fingers into the inseam hard enough that Tony can’t help but shudder and melt into them.
“Do you want to sit down?” Steve asks. Tony shakes his head against his palm. “Okay,” Steve whispers, his voice the only one in the room, which makes for a funny kind of one-sided conversation. Then, before he can think better of it, Tony turns toward Steve, wraps his arms around the man’s impossible waist, and hugs himself close to Steve’s radiating heat. He’s too gone for shame, and too weak; a soft, gentle Steve is hard to resist, even on good days. And this just became a no good, very bad day.
Steve visibly swallows. "I’m fine,” he says, and he sounds like it. He certainly looks like it, smiling like the free man he is. Fine might actually be the truth, in Steve’s case, even if it isn’t in Tony’s.
“—wonder what he thought about bringing on War Machine on a full-time basis, but the man continues to be infuriatingly committed to the Air Force, which, as far as one-sided marriages go, I really think he could do better—”
Tony burns with embarrassment. He knows his face is bright red, because Steve is staring right at it and grinning like he just won a prize.
“There’s plenty of daylight,” Steve replies, thrusting an elbow out and up towards Natasha’s briefly exposed diaphragm, a little Muay Thai move she showed him the other day. She blocks it easily and uses his momentum against him, dropping him to the mat in a blur of wrapped hands and red hair.
Sensitivity be damned, Tony rolls his hips against Steve’s hand. It’s worth it just to hear the noise it shakes loose from Steve’s chest, a deep, shuddering gasp that sounds almost surprised. The hand on his cock moves impossibly faster.
to make a tear spring from Tony’s eye, the traitor, but there, he’s watching it roll off the tip of his nose and land right smack dab on the top of Steve’s infuriatingly perfect left foot. Even in the low light of the kitchen, it glitters noticeably against Steve’s pale skin as it rolls off the slope and onto the floor.
him grinning. Is that even possible? Should they have discussed this first? And why the hell is his first instinct to go out there and blow Steve on the balcony right this second? Just the thought gives him tunnel vision (and a semi).
Steve squeezes his wrist, a hint of pressure against delicate skin. Tony watches the gears turning over in Steve’s mind, a sure sign that he has more than a few questions he wants to ask Tony and is struggling to narrow it down to just one.
“I know! It was hilarious, and I want to get it on camera this time so I can send it to Alan Rickman. He’ll
Steve rewards Tony’s plaintive, mindless moaning with a lewd, wet suck to his hole; Tony’s senses are so focused on that spot, he can
The smirk becomes a full-blown grin. Steve squeezes his other arm around Tony’s lower back and hums, deep and resonant, in his chest as he leans down to brush his lips feather-softly against Tony’s.
. Even after I licked and fingered your sweet little asshole open, huh? That’s okay. I’ll open you up. Gonna fuck you wide open. Keep going, sweetheart, that’s it. That’s so good…”
“You’d like that, wouldn’t you,” Steve rumbles in his ear. He unfolds Tony’s arms from behind his back only to take both of Tony’s wrists in one of his massive, rough hands and pin them above his head against the bed. “Such a good little cockslut, you’d let me fuck you over and over and over again. Wouldn’t you, Tony?” Even as he says it, Tony can feel Steve growing again inside him, thickening against his overstimulated rim, stretching it out wide around the base of him. “Just lie there and let me use you however I want. Whenever I want.”
, filling the room with that telltale wet slap of skin on skin as Steve’s hips slam deliciously hard against Tony’s ass, faster and faster, favoring speed for depth, now, with every soul-jarring thrust. His cock drags against the wet spot on the mattress with every push of Steve inside him, but with his arms crossed behind his back Tony can’t do anything to help it along; he just has to lie there and
It happens often enough that the fact itself isn’t jarring, but something about being alone with disheveled-frazzled-happy-sweaty Tony sets Steve’s nerves on high alert. Tony is loose-limbed and relaxed, moving in and out of Steve’s space as he picks his way around the living room barefoot, looking for discarded tools.
“Alright. Bedtime for me. Crying means I’ve officially turned into a pumpkin, and it’s not even October yet.”
“If you’ll excuse me, sir,” Steve says deferentially, already moving away from Pierce toward the circle of black suits hovering around Tony and Thor like expectant vultures at the feast. His heart is in his throat, racing.
Just imagining Steve’s reaction to that is enough to make Tony’s still-empty stomach flip unhappily.
God, he loves this man. Loves him so much it pushes out anything that isn’t this effervescent feeling, like flying but
died in the hit that was meant for me. I figured, the least I could do was find five of their closest buddies who needed help.”
“Stay there.” Steve’s voice is raspy already, Tony thinks wildly as air rushes back into his lungs in Steve’s absence. Not that Steve’s gone far—oh no, Tony can still
,” he groans, breath hitching in his throat with every pointed thrust of Steve’s hips. Steve presses a sinful kiss to his slack lips with a chuckle.
comes one week after their small hours rendezvous, when Tony finds himself back in the communal kitchen drinking fresh coffee, staring a burning hole in the back of Steve’s head.
Plus, his life is complicated enough as it is. Adding an unsuspecting stranger to the mix would only complicate more. And how would he explain it to them, his life? How could he ask for understanding when what he does is so outside the scope of the average person’s day-to-day reality? How could he ask anyone to wait up for him, not knowing if he’d make it back to them alive? In what universe would that be fair to a partner?
“I don’t want you to stop being yourself, but I do want more of you for myself.” Once Tony shakes himself from his stupor and settles his arms around Steve’s shoulders, Steve sets to loosening the knot in his tie until it hangs open and Steve can start looping both ends around his hand. Their noses just touch when Steve speaks, his head bent so the words don’t have to travel far to reach Tony’s ears: “You’re my best friend, Tony. I trust you. Even when we disagree, I know your heart is in the right place, and I admire you so much for that—the sheer power of your convictions alone, it’s incredible. And when we fight together? God, Tony. I feel
“I should have realized you’d be all about equal treatment,” he jokes, but it comes out flat; he’s grasping for words to fill in for the ones he doesn’t want to say. Because Tony has his sore spots. He’s been so badly hurt, by so many people; evasion is just one of the many weapons in his bristling arsenal.
, a little voice reminds him. It sounds remarkably like JARVIS. Steve deserves happiness. It’s why Tony let him go. After their heavy-duty pillow talk (and another memorable round of lovemaking, with Tony taking the reins and fucking Steve on his stomach through the mattress until he was crying and begging for release), he’d asked for a little more time to work through his issues. Steve, ever the patient boyfriend, had granted it to him. Tony had offered up moving in together as a compromise, which had thrilled Steve endlessly. But when two weeks became a month, and a month became two, and Steve’s mood only soured further and further until every conversation became an argument and every argument ended in slammed doors and heavy silence, it became clear to Tony that this wasn’t an issue he was going to be able to work through in time to keep Steve, keep him happy, keep him
“Aren’t you supposed to be somewhere else right now?” Steve asks, stepping around the edge of the door. Seeing him reach a hand out, Tony turns his just so to allow their fingers to connect and weave together. Easy. They walk away hand-in-hand down the hall toward the staircase at their own pace. It feels like they’ve been doing this forever.
The woman turns to face them. Her features are striking in a way that makes Steve think of old friends from the war, men he met on those rare occasions he had leave. He’d listen to Native American Code Talkers tell stories of land and legacy and home, stories older than anything Steve had ever known. He’d never been so humbled.
and only that, forever. But work had come calling the morning after Steve had thrown Tony’s whole world off its carefully calibrated axis and then ever-so-sweetly put him to bed—alone, and no Tony is absolutely not still fuming about that—and then it kept calling, to the point that Tony is amazed he’s managed to get any sleep this past week between workshop sprees, board meetings, and the Avengers PR rigmarole.
” he’d replied instead, pinching his thigh hard enough to dissuade his blood from flowing further south.
glad they’re already in the tower and can go straight up to Tony’s floor on the private elevator after this, because he’s not going to be very presentable in about five minutes, judging by the way Tony is mouthing desperately at Steve’s neck as he undoes his belt buckle and fly before sinking down with a lascivious grin to kneel at Steve’s feet.
“I thought I was doing a good job of keeping that under wraps,” Steve says, sitting up now so they can have this conversation eye-to-eye. And he did, really—at some point between telling Tony the truth about Bucky and his parents and opening the compound to trainees and new Avengers recruits together, Steve could no longer deny the fact that he had managed to develop a frankly
“That was torture,” Tony whines, kissing the base of Steve’s throat and following it with a nip of teeth that makes stars burst behind Steve’s eyelids. “Why did we agree to your plan again?”
“What—” Tony’s brain is still rebooting, recovering from the concussion and now trying to parse what he thinks his eyes just saw. “Why are you sorry?”
“All good then,” Tony chuckles, but he won’t look Steve in the eye anymore. He picks up his fork and starts to tuck in, chewing so fast it’s like he’s racing toward a finish line Steve can’t see and doesn’t know how to keep from approaching, except—
when Steve fucks him like this, breaking him open and stitching him back together again. He’s never been too nervous to come, but like this, pinned under Steve’s huge, sweltering body, being fucked open and full, it feels daunting, like jumping off a skyscraper without the suit. There’s no promise as to where he’s going to land, or how hard the ground’s going to hit him when he does; all he can trust is that Steve will be there with him, falling too.
“Nowhere else in the world I’d rather be, S—” Tony starts, his voice gone watery and catching on Steve’s name. Steve doesn’t let him finish—he stands up from the bench and kisses Tony deep and slow, giving as good as he got, and when Tony starts pulling him toward the bed by the front of his shirt, Steve follows without a second thought, heart safely in hand.
Only when Tony sighs, and quite heavily, that Steve realizes this was more than just a friendly house call (of sorts) on Tony’s part. He watches Tony stand up, facing the floor-to-ceiling windows bright with the glow of sunset, and admires the way Tony suits the view so perfectly. He looks good all the time, but like this—skin burnished gold, brown eyes honeyed by the light—he’s something else. Someone Steve wants, desperately, but like most things in his life, knows he’s not allowed to have. Tony Stark is beyond him in so many ways. Reaching for him seems futile, so Steve stays on the ground, and looks.
Tony’s not sure how the rest of it goes, traditionally, but he’s pretty sure a Jewish Seder ritual doesn’t involve a six-foot Irish Catholic man with a face carved by angels turning the faithful in place to look him in the eye.
“Yeah, you did,” Steve answers, smiling at Tony as warmly and happily as he feels. This isn’t a real date, but he’s still having a fantastic dinner with his best friend and crush, so it’s a fun, memorable night for him either way. Steve dishes a heaping spoonful of rich, glossy pasta onto Tony’s plate first, too preoccupied to notice Tony glancing at his mouth before he takes another drink of light red wine (the price of which Duncan didn’t mention and at this point Steve doesn’t want to know).
Even as the world whites out in a deafening blast of fire and stone, Tony thinks he hears Steve screaming his name.
It’s incredible, how shockingly little effort it takes for total strangers to unravel him, even after all this time. Even remembering what Steve said earlier, and last week:
After Siberia, Steve spent most nights awake, standing on balconies and rooftops just holding the flip phone and thinking back to those earlier days with the kind of bitterly pitiful regret of the truly stupid: of course he’d been infatuated, back then. Of course he’d run away from the very thought. There’d been Pepper, obviously, and it was
There had been a couple of years there, the good ones, when he’d spent a lot of time watching Tony in his workshop, learning the ways in which Tony’s genius applied itself to the world. Everything from DUM-E to JARVIS to the suits to their comms to the reactor powering the tower to proprietary satellites to pasta carbonara, Tony’s mind was capable of it all, and then some. And it all lived inside a man who drove Steve crazy with anger and frustration and awe and lust and who gave Steve so unbelievably much without asking for anything,
, humming as he licks and sucks Tony’s rim, opening him up with infinite patience and that insistent, wet tongue until he goes from prodding little licks to a deep, languorous tonguing that leaves Tony drooling even as he babbles himself breathless, “Fuck, Steve,
and nearly dry-humping him through a door that are only a few hours old. He’s allowed to feel little unsteady.
The late afternoon light coming through Tony’s floor-to-ceiling windows bathes his motionless body golden. He looks like he’d be hot to the touch. Steve’s never wanted to be burned so badly.
Tony mock-gasps, pressing a hand high on his chest. “Mr. Rogers! Are you saying you think you’re better than
know Tony can’t get it up again. Tony’s hands fly out, grabbing wildly at Steve’s ass, his thigh, the back of his head, his thick, muscled forearm, as he sobs under Steve’s relentless assault, realizing with a plaintive yell that Steve is zoning in on that spot because every time he does Tony’s ass clenches around him, flutters and squeezes, full of Steve’s come, and how that must
It takes Tony a moment to realize that Steve’s hands are still on him. Holding him, palms pressed flat and fingers fanned out on either side of Tony’s spine, low enough to suggest but high enough to maintain his innocence, if need be. The hold keeps their hips aligned and their chests apart, a gap of plausible deniability wedged firmly between their bodies.
It’s not. That’s the point. Nor is it the point that he’s been nursing a crush on a certain someone on the team for the past year, a man so far out of his league it makes Steve’s head spin. That’s just background noise, at this point, an asterisk at the end of a sentence:
“Can I take this off?” Steve asks, pulling at the hem of Tony’s shirt. It’s the first question he’s put to Tony that requires an answer, and it takes Tony a second to respond. When he does, it’s in the form of stripping the offending article from his own body, revealing the whole of himself to Steve’s eyes—the backside, anyways. And that’s fine, he can handle that much; Steve doesn’t have to see the scars, or the arc reactor, in this position. Maybe that’s why he laid Tony out like this in the first place, so he wouldn’t have to see how painfully, boringly
For a moment, Steve holds him there under his searching gaze, one massive hand still wrapped around Tony’s wrist. The heat in the elevator is climbing, Tony notices, sweat building up in the small of his back. It’s hard to think with Steve this close, even if he hasn’t moved any further into Tony’s space; alone together in an elevator, alone for the first time in god knows how long, and all it takes for Tony’s higher thoughts to dislodge and fall headlong into pining, pining,
Tony’s eyes flutter closed. He kisses Steve back, reaching up to cup his face, feel the sweat of exertion there, the kind that makes Steve glow. Breathing each other’s air, they come down like that, wrapped around each other and kissing, breathing, kissing, touching. Tony’s face is wet from crying, but Steve doesn’t seem to mind. If anything, he takes particular care to wipe every last trace of Tony’s tears away, whispering sweet nothings in his ear as he goes, kissing away a new tear when it escapes.
The way Tony had stared back at Steve then is not unlike the way he looks up at him now: from the floor of the lobby of Stark Tower, roughed up and shellshocked from the battle and his brief introduction to outer space and a minor cardiac episode, but relieved and inarticulately
“Fuck,” Steve gasps, and that’s how Tony knows he’s all the way inside: that gasp, Steve’s fingers squeezing his side where he’s holding him, and the feel of Steve’s hips against his ass, holding him up halfway in the air. There’s a frisson of pain as Tony adjusts, nothing that won’t pass in a few seconds, but it serves as a reminder that this is what they’re doing. That Steve is
Blinking away the haze of his own orgasm, Tony presses in closer, cradling Steve’s head in his hands and taking advantage of the moment and his own clarity while he can, licking his way into Steve’s mouth with a groan and sucking on that cunning tongue while Steve fucks himself noisily with his fist, covered in Tony’s come, wet and rock fucking hard. Steve’s fingers never leave his ass the whole time, just hold there in stasis, like he doesn’t want to forget what it feels like inside, and Tony knows what that’s like, wanting to stay in that warm, perfect place forever.
The tux he chose for the occasion is simple, classic, no-fuss, but the tie is custom: a gift from Steve he’s never worn before tonight. He’s looked at it hundreds of times, hanging among the countless many in his closet, but it was too special to wear out for just any event—rich, red silk spotted with tiny gold Iron Man faceplates, each with eyes embroidered a bright, burning blue. He
Obviously that’s only half of the story, but no one needs to know about how Tony spent most of those six weeks moping around in that big empty house wearing grubby shirts and eating pints of half-melted Half Baked ice cream out of the container (and then exercising himself sick to make up for it).
“Fair,” Tony laughs, fingers hooked into the waistband of Steve’s navy blue slacks. “But I still get to call you ‘fiancé,’ right?”
And Steve. Steve is here, back in his life in a way he hasn’t been in ages, slotted back into place like he never left, and that fact isn’t the thing that makes Tony want to drink, really, but it’s definitely pushing him over the edge of something he doesn’t want to acknowledge, or dwell on, but he recognizes it all the same. And usually when that happens, he turns to alcohol to blur the view, but there’s no alcohol in the tower. Not even mouthwash. But he has the workshop, and blackout protocols in place to keep people
“It happens,” he says, genuine sympathy (but mercifully no pity) writ large across his middle-aged face. “In any case, you probably dodged a bullet. Want something a little stronger?”
As if to drive home his point, Steve rocks back and Tony is crying out, loud and unrestrained, when he feels that long, scalding tongue push back inside him and lick, deep and wet, all the way back out to lave Tony’s hole before Steve is spearing him again and kissing his rim with all of the dedication and attention he paid his mouth before, hard, sucking kisses that make Tony moan like he’s dying, but what a way to fucking go, pried open on Steve Rogers’s tongue while he holds Tony’s impossibly hard cock so, so gently, lets it drool precome thick and heavy over his fingers as he works Tony open.
, Tony, yes, shit—just like that,” he babbles, staring deep into Tony’s eyes as he dips his cock in and out of him, drinking in the sight of what must be Tony’s flushed, fucked-out expression with a soft, heartbreakingly earnest smile, like Tony really
The moment their lips touch, Steve gasps like Tony did the first time they did this, back at the tower in the middle of the night. It starts soft and gentle; a careful touch that sends warmth through him until he feels lit from within. Then, stealing the advantage, Tony hauls Steve in with a firm hand against the small of his back and kisses him, deep and dirty—a short, spit-slick preview of what’s to come. Tony angles his head and delves in to lick the bourbon off Steve’s pliant tongue, drawing soft noises from him while around them people gasp loudly in shock like poppers at a New Year’s Eve party.
“They’re from the same company as the guys in the convoy I was with when I—when they—” his voice sputters out before he can say the words. Steve doesn’t push. He doesn’t say anything. He just waits for Tony to gather himself. It’s one of the hardest lessons he’s had to learn about Tony Stark—sometimes it’s better to let him get a handle on himself, rather than jump in and try to handle Tony
and the other usual clichés, but one kiss from Steve has Tony ready to list all kinds of superlatives. Steve kisses steady, and Steve kisses kind; he waits for cues from Tony before adjusting the pace, or his position, or the pressure. He gives and gives and doesn’t take.
Tony is gone before JARVIS can remind him that it’s ten minutes to speech-time. He bolts for the stairs—lushly carpeted for the evening in dark blue, the color of Steve’s eyes on a rainy day—and takes them two at a time, breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth the whole way up. It pulls him like a hook on the end of a line, this need—to see Steve, to feel him, to know that it wasn’t all a dream. It pulls and pulls until Tony is loping down the exposed corridor overlooking the ballroom below, glancing at every balcony doorway en route just in case.
He should be stronger than this. He should be past having panic attacks that leave him winded and jittery whenever someone mentions taking the reactor from his chest, and he should be able to talk to Steve about it without breaking down. But between the stress, and the hunger, and the fatigue, and the whole loving-but-not-being-loved thing, and Steve’s sheer proximity, Tony can’t help it. One tear becomes two, then three, and now he’s shielding his eyes and whispering apologies and a panicked
Tony huffs. Before he can cross his arms defensively, before either of them can think another thought, Steve reaches out with both hands, pulls Tony forward by the front of his too-nice shirt and kisses him, fast and firm and warm. The kiss is a point being made more than anything else, but a point nonetheless.
to be a part of Tony's life like this. it's also frustrating, and infuriating, and dangerous, but that was always the case. the only difference is now, you can have make-up sex.
coffee,” Steve replies, quietly. Clint’s still in the living room, bitching about picking up after everyone else even though he’s got actual kids to deal with, but Tony doesn’t really have the capacity to talk to or think about Clint right now. He notices Steve’s hand is hanging in the air between them, trying to bridge the gap, but he’s too far away. Steve notices Tony noticing.
, and he tells himself he won’t, but nothing changes the fact that right now he is so strung out and overwhelmed by everything that’s happened the past few days that he
He has more good days than not, which, for an alcoholic, are pretty decent odds all things considered. It used to be the other way around, and that wasn’t good for anyone. Especially the Avengers—new, old, or future.
Tony doesn’t know if he can describe how Steve is looking at him, even with his brain on high alert, borderline fight-or-flight mode, because he’s
Tony steps toward the open glass doors, ready to announce his arrival. The happy-swooping feeling of finding and seeing Steve short circuits when Tony gets close enough to take in the whole of the scene and realizes someone else out there with him.
The bomb drops. In the spare second he has to react, Tony grabs Piledriver and hurls him across the room, mostly out of harm’s way, then launches himself on the bomb just as it hits the floor.
—that would be him taking Steve shopping, making him laugh and smile as he tucked his hand around that lovely hip and held him close while the world watched on in envy.
Rogers looks at the time-space GPS with a degree of skepticism Steve forgot that face was capable of. After talking trees and raccoons and living Norse gods and alien armies from outer space and Titans and time travel—after
Like a dog with a bone, this guy. That’s why he won’t let go of Tony’s wrist—it’s not an affectionate touch at all, Tony realizes despairingly, but a way to keep Tony in place, rooted to the spot until he tells Steve the truth.
“Hickies optional, obviously,” he says gamely, winking at Steve, whose shoulders are creeping up toward his ears. “We could just muss ourselves up before we get home and they’d never know the difference.”
