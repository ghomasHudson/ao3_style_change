“What’s the issue with him ordering in if it’s hurting no one? He has the money, he doesn’t have the time to cook, and he’s not good at it.”
“Yeah Cap? I’ll be honest, this is a dream come true for me. If I had a camera and less of a moral imperative to preserve your dignity, I’d have so many pictures of your all-american ass and cock right now. But I’ve been good. Don’t you think I’ve been good, Steve?”
“Perhaps. Or maybe there’s more there if you look. But to do that, you have to let Tony make his own mistakes.”
“Well, if that’s the case, then Fury wants to see you,” Natasha replies.
“I don’t do nice, Winghead.” Holding Tony’s knees open with his elbows, Steve leans down and aims his hand at Tony’s hole.
“Stalling me won’t change a thing.” Tony doesn’t know if it will, but he has to think that it’s better than nothing that Cap and assassins make it here sooner rather than later.
And like a truth serum has taken hold of his vocal cords, Tony opens his mouth.
He was, terrifyingly, about to find out.
Unashamed, he humped Steve’s leg, grinding his cock along the solid muscle there.
Nat tips her head up as if thinking before she speaks.
“I said no.” Tony looks at him, eyes shifting back and forth as he waits to see if Steve is going to respect his decision. Steve really wants to prove to Tony that he means it. That Tony is beautiful and perfect in his arms, and there’s no need to hide. But that’s not what this is about. He lets his hands drop to Tony’s sides, unwilling to let go of Tony.
The package comes while he’s working with Rhodey on his braces. It’s gotten better now; his friend can walk and stand on his own with support. The new muscles he’s been using are beginning to strengthen.
It doesn’t happen.
I need to hear you.” Steve’s voice was low and dangerous. While Tony’s omega side delighted in the intrinsic threat, the rest of him struggled against the need to obey, his fingers sluggishly reaching for the latch.
Tony won’t stop talking about how Steve has saved his life, and how he’s going to repay the favor as soon as Bruce stops making him work. Steve has to kiss the man again to shut him up.
is going to do. He has no idea what it is, but it’s not a wolf. His whole body shivers and he reflexively swallows.
“Steve, I want to be alone. May I?” Steve’s taken aback, but realizes it might have something to do with whatever is going on with Tony’s chest. He likely doesn’t want to take his shirt off in front of Steve.
“I don’t think I want you looking at that. I’m not sure it pertains to you anymore. Now this on the other hand, is Agent Romanoff’s assessment of you. Read it.” Tony dropped the other file, snatching his personal folder from Fury. There was no denying he was interested in what Natalie had to say. Even though she was an Alpha, her scent, designation suppressants, and acting had been so sound. She’d played an Omega so well, but when she’d strode into the diner, that walk was all Alpha.
Steve breathes deep and lets his chest fall deeper into himself. His cock starts to take an interest in the proceedings, and he can feel it perk up, the sensation hot as sparks. He doesn’t dare look however, not with Tony here in front of him, breathing and breathing out his nervousness and anxiety. Tony’s eyes are maddeningly close, the heat having wicked color from his eyes, what’s left of the brown bleeding into the black, leaving pinpricks of light in their wake. It’s utterly captivating.
“So you are that Captain America boy. Well then. You take care of that Tony Stark of yours. Remember what I said.”
“Gonna fuck you full of my cum. Know you need it. Want to get you ready for me.” With that, Steve dives for his body again, and Tony is sure that he’s going to disappoint him with using his tongue when Tony
“So, what’s the plan then Cap?”
“Yes. He’s called in when necessary.”
Oh shit. His mask is off. They know.
“Already taken care of. Check your closet and try it on tonight. Make sure it fits.”
“It’s about time you figured it out. Just treat Tony with respect. And me. But I suppose if you don’t treat me well, I’ll just shoot you. Added incentive, that.” Clint is cleaning his fingernails using a knife as he threatens Steve. It’s not necessary, but it is endearing.
Now that Tony had time and distance from the events in New York, he knew the look Steve had given him over shawarma was the full force of America’s disapproval. Steve didn’t like the way Tony handled missions. Didn’t like it when he got injured. Always found time to try and bother Tony, as if he had a homing beacon for wherever Tony was.
. It’s disgusting, low, and dirty, but Tony sees the table to his right and wonders if Steve is going to take him over there, bend him tight over it, hips bracketing Tony’s ass, and
Tony cries, sweeter than anything Steve has heard before, and that’s more than enough. Steve shudders, slowing his hips as he pulls in and out, knot starting to catch at Tony’s seams. Finally it seats fully in Tony, and Steve tugs at it from behind before he nestles it in deeper. Tony doesn’t need anything more, and his Omega comes solely from the stimulation of Steve’s knot. Tony’s orgasm is a gutted, wounded thing, tears streaming down his Omega’s face while he’s slack-jawed and trembling convulsively.
“Steve! I’m—”
How fair was it that something that meant so much to him was just another Omega for Steve? He’s probably one Omega in a line of them who have been serviced by the man. Steve was only saying what his idiot Omega side wanted to hear. That he was wanted, unique, adored. That he was accepted.
“Talk to Tony, ok?” He smacks the bottle on the table in front of him, and Steve makes to swipe it away before Bucky can change his mind. Bucky grabs tighter to the bottle as Steve closes his fingers around Bucky’s fist.
“I’d love to tell you that this contract isn’t airtight, but Howard’s legal team has always been thorough. It’s not a bad idea on his end, all things considered. No one ever expected… well.” Right. No one had thought that Captain America was alive, and thus either of them having to endure the rigid terms of this contract. Anthony could stay married, his assets secure, without ever having them interfered with.
“So. Magical healing dick!” Tony is sitting up in the bed drinking a cup of water and staring at Steve with glee in his eyes.
Because this was ridiculous. Every three months everyone in the tower went through this. Tony was apologetic after, showering Pepper with gifts and the like. He’d make Clint some more arrows, or construct an interesting fabric for Widow’s skin-tight outfit. Heck, he’d even repair Bucky’s arm. Such was the extent of his apparent regret. Yet without fail, Tony had violent ruts. Ruts that he did nothing to appease.
. Yet… it feels like it is.
“I’m not fucking sick!” Tony’s arms flail out and he slams a fist on the counter.
“I’m working on it Tony.” Steve suppresses a laugh and takes a bite of his food, thinking of all the future nights ahead of him with Tony that will be just like this. Besides when they’re fighting as a team, the only other time that Tony is amenable towards Steve is when he’s eating.
“You’re so good, Tony. So sweet for me. Want to see you like this. Yeah, that’s it.” Tony’s shoulder blades press into the couch, his spine forming a shallow slope as he arches. It’s so good. So very good. Steve is melting Tony’s inhibitions and he bites back a low moan of appreciation, wishing that he could take his pants off or reciprocate. Something, anything other than this slow, cruel descent into fire that has him melting inside even as his body grows rigid with impending orgasm.
“It’s ok. You’re not wrong.” She rubs her hand up and down Tracy’s arm. Trevor is still sitting there with his arms crossed defensively.
God, even Fury is here, wearing exactly what he usually wears. The man is deep in conversation with Agent Hill, who looks rather fashionable in an emerald getup.
Finally he plants the device, and strolls around to the other side of the table while explaining that the other materials are… immaterial. As Barton can get them pretty easily. They just need a power source to kick start the cube.
The elevator doors jangle open, harsh and discordant. Steve takes the hallway at a dead run towards the glass doors to the workshop. They slide open as he approaches, and slam shut behind him.
“The clock is at four hours of Tony being under. He’ll have brain damage by now.”
“Also, we had a statue fall in the garden. It’s too heavy for me to lift, if you wouldn’t mind giving me a hand?” Father Jacobs looks at him consideringly, as if Steve would refuse.
“You’d think that people who get up to helping us designated deviants hump it out would do this over drinks and dinner. Is this an ambush, Pepper? A forced meet cute where I’m expected to be overwhelmed by the amazing scent of coffee and dick?” There was also the tiny, insignificant problem that he was dying. Yet, he didn’t feel guilty in the slightest that his bucket list did not include enacting a tragic harlequin novel by spending his last heat with the perfect Alpha. The end of the story would not be magical, containing a healing dick that abruptly rid him of palladium poisoning. Best to let Pepper have this though, he knew.
In his mind, the leathery scent of Tony has turned to the sweetness of amber, the black pepper heightening and becoming a tart citrus, and the cedar becoming the secretive, woody scent of sandalwood. These are not Alpha scents, and in his mind, Tony is on all fours, presenting to Steve. His hole is slick and open while Tony’s mouth does its best imitation of his ass, drooling and agape.
“Excuse me for one moment.” Steve smiles cagily at the justice and yanks Tony by his elbow towards the back of the room. The omega lets it happen, though his face is an open ‘o’ of shock.
“Alex got me off of a family friend who was supposed to take care of me. My parents thought that he would be there for me, as we’d known his family for years. But when he got into some bad debt, he traded me off to Alex. My parents could do nothing. I could do nothing. I have a hard time thinking of what Alex did to me as rape. Not like Trevor. He—he was kind to me. Built me nice nests, was with me through all of my heats, bathed me, and fed me. But I was just an object to him. He would tell me that I was cherished, loved. But I existed in this narrow space for him.”
“You can go, Captain. Please take care of sir.” Steve manages to pull Tony’s jeans off of him, leaving him ass-naked in a lover’s carry. He has to trust that JARVIS can take care of this, because Steve is not having his first time with Tony on the floor of the workshop or its ratty couch.
“What game, sweetheart?” Bucky looks bewildered, and Tony blinks but continues on with his protests.
“I’ll stay, as CEO. But no more secrets about you. And you’ll deal with your heat.”
Tony would look so beautiful if he were pregnant. But that’s a measure of control he’ll give Tony over the situation. Steve trusts that eventually he will want the same things Steve does.
He could still hear the guttural, metallic shrieks of the Chitauri soldiers, hear the whir of their speeders coming towards him as he rose up to meet their attack. He remembered the moment he thought that maybe this wouldn’t be as bad. They could shoot fish in a barrel, even if the barrel was New York.
The result is unreal.
The endearments start then, how sweet he was, how good, how
“Where is Steve located?”
. I’m so good, please I’ve been so good, I promise! I’ll do anything you want, anything—” Steve groans and comes, plastering his hips to Tony’s as he pumps away at his ass. The knot takes so beautifully, Tony contracted around him like a vice. Tony moans and whines, bucking up against Steve and trying his best to get closer.
“Pep, stop, please.” Her eyes widened and narrowed, and she heaved out a breath before stalking over to Tony. Tentatively she reaches out, her hand open and waiting for Tony to grab a hold. His Omega does, and Steve feels something sharp twist in his chest. There’s something here he wants, but he has everything he needs, doesn’t he?
. No. He doesn’t want…
It’s a Vendorian wearing an Andorian suit, and not very well by this point. A red tentacle works its way into Tony’s ass, bright and shining with lubricant. Tony activates the gauntlet for his wrist, nanotech cascading down his arm to form metal around his hand.
It doesn’t do a damn thing.
“Is that so?” It doesn’t come out sounding like a question. Steve is inscrutable, his body painted with sweat and slick, muscles in stark relief from dehydration, as beautiful as Tony has ever seen him, achingly so.
But it’s not over with yet. Nat won’t act without proof, and Tony is convincible.
“Maybe. But through God, all things are possible. You owe it to yourself, and to him that made you, to try to move forward. Don’t get me wrong, that’s hard. It’s a long road, and it’s lonely. Which is why you have to walk with god. And if not god, you have to walk with someone or something. Do you have anyone to talk to?”
From that, he’d developed alpha-like characteristics, which would presumably revert when he ceased his suppressants.
A part of him wants to die, but that would leave Tony alone.
It was fine for so many years. I’m in my late 30s. I never wanted for anything. My husband signed for my birth control and expensive heat suppressants so I could do my job traveling doing software installs for a healthcare company. My money paid for all these things, but as with everything, you need your alpha’s permission to use your own money if you opted for a joint account. And even then your alpha can close down your individual checking account without you present.”
“So what’s next?” Tony asks.
“Well, I don’t have the answer Mr. Persnickety. Or would you rather zombie-out in a room full of people and eat them all? We have our safety to consider.”
“I’d say I was disappointed with you lying Tony, but we both know that wouldn’t be true.” Tony didn’t have to move his head to see Steve through the viewscreen. The man’s every muscle was taut, spring-loaded for action.
“Whatever. Ms. Potts? Got a sec?” She mumbles something to Phil before coming over to join him.
It’s been a week since the thing with Steve on the couch, and Tony has been desperate to not think about it or process it at all. Bucky and Steve are still at each other’s throats, only now it seems worse than ever. Today in the field, Steve’s shield almost clipped Bucky, and there were definitely some stray bullets that went Steve’s direction that didn’t need to. Everyone on the team noticed and even Fury had called them to have a word. Which is why they weren’t here at the tower just yet.
“There’s no punishment. But where did you go?” Steve grips the countertop, asking God for patience. Reminding himself that the priest said that Tony’s choices are his own, and if he wants to sin, it’s Tony’s responsibility to deal with that sin, not Steve’s. It doesn’t make it any easier though when he wants to explode, pull Tony over his knee, and give the omega ample reason to never disobey again.
“Stark Tower? That big ugly… building in New York?” Tony glares at him now. It took less than a minute for garbage to come out of Rogers’s mouth. His building is a stunning example of modern architecture. So what if the Captain probably likes his late victorian with a side of musty old curtains and brass fixtures. Tony notes that the Captain must have all-around bad taste. Has he seen his own uniform even?
“It’s the lack of effort on that last insult that really gets me, Cap. There’s nothing wrong with being an Omega in arms manufacturing, even if I don’t personally want to do it. Oh look, you’re going to make the face again. Jaw all tight with your eyes boring holes through me. Sorry cupcake, you’ll never get the satisfaction of my guilt.” They’re left glaring at each other, Tony rolling his eyes even though he wants to stride right up to Rogers and show him how much more creative he can be with his words.
He’d only synthesized a type of hormonal suppressant when he was fifteen, which was highly illegal. But when his neck had started tingling with sensitivity, he knew Howard would barter him to the highest bidder if he found out that Tony wasn’t a beta or an alpha. It was enough incentive to do a crash course in chemistry at MIT.
He can tell that they’re alive. They bleed like humans and die just like them. This is nothing like having an enemy you know is evil. He suspects these are all innocents under some kind of thrall. It makes him feel an immense sense of guilt as he pummels them to pieces.
“Not yet, you aren’t.” Tony shoves out his hand, as if he already knows that Steve isn’t going to shake it, and holds it there for a beat before returning it to his side, wiping it on his leg as if he’s touched something disgusting. Steve feels the heat of indignity at his back, the sudden desire to see this through, and he knows now that he’s hooked. Steve’s never backed down from a challenge, and there is no problem too big.
“Hi there! Welcome to Nest! Can I get some sample swatches started for you today?” Steve looks agog at the woman who stops in front of them. She’s omega, and she smells bonded.
“There isn’t. Ok? I have to live this way. This is my life and if it’s going to be like this, I get the choice to not let it hang over my head.” Tony’s brow furrows, and he’s willing his words at Rhodes with a desperation that Steve doesn’t understand. He knows that even though Tony will come to accept and like his new circumstances, today it seems impossible. Yet here Tony is, asking Rhodes to accept that Tony is resigned to this. Steve doesn’t believe Tony, doesn’t think the other man has given up so easily. It’s another facet of this game he’s embarking on with his mate.
“I think that’s his choice. Don’t you agree?”
“I’m in the military, it counts. And shouldn’t breakups, even not-breakups, be done in public anyway?” Pepper smiled, the sad moment pierced by Rhodey’s brisk humor. He was so thankful for the both of them. No, he didn’t get what he wanted, but he didn’t lose them. Either of them.
“No, no, this isn’t on you. I wouldn’t have thought this would happen either. Just– let it go– I need you to let it go.” Tony’s eyes are begging, filled with some kind of emotion that Steve can’t explain. Again, his jealousy spikes, and he wants to consume whatever Tony is giving Rhodes. He wants everything that Tony is. Not understanding Tony completely is usually a challenge he’s willing, able, and entertained by taking on. But not knowing in this moment is gutting him. What is Tony thinking in that head of his?
“You mean I don’t smell fucked. I sprayed some beta cologne before we came, and that will have to do,” Tony says before he takes a large sip of his glass, tilting it back quickly before smacking his lips. “Ok, to battle.”
Steve’s heart lurches. He never realized that he wanted that, but now that he sees it, it’s all he can think about. He never wanted an omega, but never did he deny that there was some fulfillment to be had in having one. It just never seemed like it was him, to have someone who wasn’t quite a partner, but more like a burden. Tony doesn’t seem to be all that much like what he suspected, yet he does remember the pictures and the profile he read at SHIELD. It’s hard to forget.
Almost as if it had been timed perfectly, Steve gets a call from SHIELD. The Director, Nick Fury, wants him to come in to discuss what work he’ll be doing for the organization. Steve hadn’t considered what his source of income would be or what he’d be doing in the future, but he figures he’s obligated to work for SHIELD considering that they found him. He doesn’t know what else he would do, to be frank. Currently he’s just surviving off his back pay from the army.
“I guess super soldier senses aren’t all they’re cracked up to be?”
“I can do nothing less.” It’s a promise to JARVIS. An assurance that if Steve is worth anything at all, he will give Tony all that he has. Tony is everything in this world that is good and pure. All he waited for after the war that he never got. The very breath in his lungs, he thinks, as he breathes in Tony’s unadulterated Omega scent.
The soft whine of repulsors fills the room as War Machine barrels his way in. Everyone already knows what’s coming, and they all dive out of the way. Natasha hustles Bruce out of the room as Clint pulls his bow and knocks an arrow. Thor raises his hammer, eager to fight.
“Might as well own the rest.”
Bucky gazes at Tony from beneath his hair, and he looks like a repentant angel. Tony fucking
“I forced nothing. Tony chose to bite me back.” He’s getting angry now. Tony is his. Not a thing in the world is changing that. Any attempt to kill him could result in Tony’s death. Their bond is strong. Steve made sure of that.
He thanks Thor and makes his way back to medical, hoping that Tony will tell him he can give more blood for the cure.
“He’s a businessman, and I tend to interact with them fairly regularly. It should be fine. Just… don’t do it again.”
“I don’t regret the things I do. I mostly regret the things you do, like come here and give me disapproving looks. Do you have anything better for me?”
It’s not even a question in Tony’s mind as to whether Rogers will show up or not. He will. There’s something tense and unspoken between them now that a man like Rogers won’t let alone. No. He’ll be back.
“Could be. Don’t know until you try.” Iron Man tilts his head to the side, like he does.
“You should have seen Stern’s face when he had to give Rhodey and me that medal. There weren’t any cameras facing that direction when he shook each of our hands, which was a grievous error on my part.” Tony’s face is lit up, his joy in the story infectious but for the malaise that’s laying over Steve.
“Sure, follow me to the sacristy here while I drop these off. We keep the records in the basement, along with all our other old records. Are you looking for a grandparent or great-grandparent?”
“How? These processors aren’t going to light themselves on fire. And I’ve got some upgrades to do for the suit. Did you know that JARVIS gets bigger as he ages? I’d say he’s getting chonky, but my baby boy is growing up and out of the harddrives in my suit. Gotta upgrade!”
“Well, sweet thing, ask not what your Captain America can do for you, but what you can do for your Captain America.” At that, Tony leans in for a filthy kiss, which Steve returns with enthusiasm. The bed is stripped of all the bloody sheets, and as they pull at each other, Steve finagles them onto the narrow mattress, their legs intertwining as they plunder each other’s mouths, lips sucking on the other’s tongue before pulling at lips with little bites.
Steve all but growls.
“Clint is a better operative than you will ever be. You’re flashy, destructive, and generally anti-authority. We could live without you. Don’t think we need you for a second. Tomorrow, 0800 hours, SHIELD, same room.”
The other man grunts as Tony sinks his mind into the array of the left arm, twisting it to lock onto the rough surface of the Kaiju, grasping at the plated biological armor of the thing, hoping to twist off a piece or otherwise secure it in place so that Steve can activate the beam. It scrabbles at them, squeezing down on the metal plates and releasing a shrill cry of victory that’s ahead of schedule.
Steve uncrosses his legs and leans forward on his knees, putting his face as close to eye level as he can without being flat on the floor himself.
Inside—
Something about that name does it for Tony. Thinking of himself as Bucky’s slut gives Tony an eager sense of belonging to the alpha in a deeply sexual and visceral way. That his wanton nature is ok, and Bucky wants it. Tony knows he’s a needy omega, and being ashamed of it has only made him feel that much more desire to get on his knees for an alpha and just
“If Loki takes over me, I need you to lock me out. Don’t let any of the suits be used for combat.”
“Please, I need you so badly, I can’t—” Tony burrows his head into the warmth of Steve’s chest. Steve. Perfect Steve who still smells like his own delectable scent, even amongst all the myriad olfactory delights of this space station. Steve is reliable, solid, like nothing can move or change him. Tony just wants to
They release their grip on each other as Trevor goes to shake Natasha’s hand.
“A lot of things have changed Tony, but we’ll get to that.” Steve nods at Tony’s Resident Annoyance.
“Oh, um, I don’t think I’m the best person to explain. There is the internet, you know?”
“Well, no—”
“You can leave them by the door.”
“Steve.” It’s a whisper on his lips as Tony draws himself in, his hands now resting at Steve’s waist like parenthesis, exerting enough force to rub them together like two matchsticks, their bodies ready for the flame. With Steve’s neck tilted back, Tony tucks his face into the curve there, his breath a breeze on Steve’s skin.
“I know Tony.” She pats his leg before getting up, and he thinks he sees the silvery line of a scar on her neck that he should have really noticed.
“I got hit with the spell that changed me back, remember? I am the only authority that matters, Cap. This is my world, you’re just living in it.” Tony’s eyes are dark with menace as he replies. The newer suit he has coils and vibrates around him, angry. Steve suspects it’s connected to him biologically, and he wonders if Tony knows that it’s an easy way to read his emotional state.
“You make it impossible not to mean it, love. You’re everything to me.”
“All right, fine, let’s get to work then,” Steve says.
“You know how it is. I am the trouble I want to see in the world,” Tony continues, now looking at Steve like he’s in on some secret joke.
Tony wakes up again, pressing his backside to Steve’s already hardening cock. It slips around in Tony’s crack as Tony backs into it, needy.
“As I was saying, Tony, it’s lovely to see you out in full force tonight. On the cusp of heat and no alpha in sight. You need a hand sweetheart? You always loved it when I helped out.”
“With all due respect Fury, I’m going to completely ignore what you just said. Captain, I am delighted by your shiny-gold hair and facial symmetry.” He snatches Rogers’s hand, and he’s struck by just how warm the Alpha is. As an Omega, he’s always struggled with cold. It would be so lovely to wrap himself up in a blanket of muscle. He somewhat reluctantly lets Rogers go before he holds on too tight. After all, he doesn’t actually know the man. Even if he knows just about everything in his past that there is to know.
Most vomit up various parts of other people they’ve swallowed, leaving the floors smelling of foul death and stomach acid. There’s too many to let stay in hospital beds, but in terms of relapse, not a single person turns back into a mindless, hungry beast.
Tony’s shirt is intent on scrunching itself up in the middle, leaving his midriff and lower back exposed. Steve doesn’t seem to notice, his fingers kneading at Tony’s skin, every point of them a warm throb that Tony never wants to end.
He should have never come here.
“I don’t need lunch. I’m having some of this. This is fine.”
“Why was Tony out of the suit?” He was trying not to be angry, but he couldn’t think of a single reason that Tony should have been unprotected.
Tony should be embarrassed that he can’t make a bed. Or do laundry. Or clean the house.
“Hmm.” Steve tilts Tony’s head back and to the side, kissing him like sips from a glass. Slow and honeyed.
What was done was done.
“I’m Edith by the by. I always get ahead of myself and forget the niceties, and I certainly know better than that by now. Maybe someday I’ll learn.”
“Is that within the budget?”
“Sweet. Ugh, I haven’t had shrimp in forever.”
Steve wants to go back into the ice. He wants to un-fly the plane. He wants to go to Brooklyn, find Edith, and take her away. If only he had known. But he hadn’t wanted to see, not at all. All the fine pieces of his conscience grate and grind at him. Conall had been a firm man, someone he’d not necessarily looked up to, but Steve had thought he was a good one. One of the good ones. Steve hadn’t known what lurked underneath that surface. That he’d lay a hand to his omega to hit. That he’d take his omega against her will.
“Take your time, Tony.” Steve is trying to be nice, Tony knows, and it helps spur him on.
“No. I don’t care. This is not a part of my life Fury. I don’t do heats, and by not doing them, I am not defined by them.” His voice is a croak, an utter betrayal of his underlying thoughts. Because Tony does want. And it does matter.
There’s fires, cars, and smoke for miles, and surrounding him are the milling people who collectively take up the call that Steve figures means ‘food.’ It ripples through the crowd of them, echoing off buildings and reverberating back towards the creatures that stand before him.
But sitting in a pit of self loathing wasn’t doing much, and he only allotted five minutes a day to think about his inevitable doom.
Tony wrenched up Steve’s shirt, fists buried at the hems as he stripped Steve, leaving that beautiful chest exposed for Tony’s mouth. He immediately sucked at those gorgeous nipples, Steve tossing his head back with a groan. Reaching out, Steve grasped Tony’s wings again, drawing them around him as he rubbed into the marginal coverts. It sends shivers all over Tony’s body, and again he has that sensation of every pleasurable nerve ending being caressed and touched.
“Language is the first thing. You are done with swear words in front of me. Every time you do so, I will take you over my knee and spank you for each one, daily. Act like a child, get treated like one.”
No, Tony Stark can’t be left to his own devices, it seems. That’s when SHIELD shows up on his private property, finally.
His shoulder storage opens as the tiny darts of explosives ratchet out, seeking their targets with JARVIS automating the tracking.
“This is Nat.”
“The Avengers initiative. Something to think about, should the need ever arise. Take it home and read it over.” She abruptly closes the file and pulls it off to the side. Underneath is another file, which she also tabs open with a finger.
“Lead the way.” Steve still feels like he’s trespassing here. Something about the way everyone is holding themselves around him makes him wary, but not as wary as they look in return.
“I haven’t–I’m–it’s something he’s agreed he’s ok with happening.” Which is a non-answer. Nat is adept at puzzling out what’s not said.
Damn, it would have been nice to have a uniform, but he’s clad in a tight t-shirt and khakis.
He wants to see. Needs to.
“Man, you both are real downers. I can’t believe I made out with you guys.” It’d been years, but Tony had gotten a few drunken kisses with Rhodey at MIT. And well, there was Pepper, obviously. Those had been the good days, before Afghanistan, his impending heat, and the Avengers took a giant crap on his perpetual good mood.
“I’m Maria Hill.” She shakes his hand and sits down across from him.
“Omegas shouldn’t be involved in weapons manufacture—”
Cap scents nothing but beta suppressants, of course, and he pulls back, nose crinkling, eyes locked on Tony’s.
“Come on, guys, let me go.”
Tony had woken Bruce up early. The files he had found had kept Tony up most of the night, but he figured Bruce deserved some sleep before he wreaked havoc on everyone with what was on SHIELD’s servers. Tony can’t sleep well anyway; the inflammation is getting worse, and his body is starting to feel overheated, his skin tight. They’re muttering over a file when Fury walks in, surprised they’re not working on the Tesseract.
And he wanted all those things to belong to him. To Steve.
The omega side of him reasoned.
And Tony might beg to be bred, which sends Steve’s mind into paroxysms of arousal just thinking about Tony pregnant. Even though he knows that he wouldn’t be able to get Tony pregnant, that doesn’t stop his body from thinking that it wants to try anyway.
“I’m not your Omega. And I’ll never forgive you because there will be nothing to forgive in a few hours.”
“Tell me it’s like you imagined, Tony. Tell me about how you thought of me, full in your ass, pumping you full of cum.”
and to cherish, till death do us part. Peachy?”
“You’ve reached the life model of Tony Stark—” He cocks his head to the side, a little customer service voice creeping into his tone.
Tony is sweating, the booze pouring off his skin in the way it does when you marathon drink and then take a short break to catch your breath. He thinks they notice, but he doesn’t really care.
“Where were you?” Tony’s voice is tight with concern. His omega was
“Start over.”
“If I really was narcissistic enough to try and take over the world, I’d leave some plausible deniability in there Stevie.”
“I apologize if there is some confusion here, but Tony can’t change his habits that easily, and everything he does for SI now is necessary. He’s the lynchpin of our entire company. Every new design goes through him. He’s a genius, Captain, not a homemaker.” Pepper sounds concerned, and her smile falters a little.
“I think I would just cut the wire.” Cap’s eyes are so blue, glittering and sharp. The intensity with which he’s looking at Tony only makes the ripple of his muscles stand out.
“I’m really not sure you want to do that, Steve.” Tony knew he must have a twisted up expression on his face because Steve’s eyebrows furrow in just that way and his jaw gets a little more rigid. Determined, stalwart. All indelible qualities of Captain America.
“Tony is a unique omega, a unique person. All of what they say about him, that’s not the whole story.” Her gaze is alert, and she gives him direct eye contact, daring him to say more.
“Ok, let’s get this over with, Rogers.”
“Fine. But don’t expect me to remain silent when the council asks for weapons, assuming you have him on a leash.”
“Yet you’re confused about why they don’t want you around?” Ouch. The Captain’s lip twitches with what could be impatience or passive aggressive hostility.
“I’m capable of making sandwiches.”
“No, I’m just his husband,” Steve deadpans.
“Like what you see?” The question is a little aggressive, but he wants Tony to want him too. He dreams about the man, even if sometimes it’s only in sensations and the wistful shadows of touch that he imagines.
There were treatments for it, but the quickest way to resolve it was spending time with an Omega. And with Captain America, well, Tony didn’t know what the serum would do.
“Tony’s heat is coming, and he asked me to spend it with him. He wants me to get things for the nest, but I don’t know what to get.”
“I’ll– I’ll try to make you happy Tony. You’ll say yes if I agree to those terms?” Tony’s head ached, his body trembling and sweating. To be frank, he’d agree to anything at this point if Steve could fill the yawning emptiness inside him. It hurt, the clenching of his cunt around nothing. He was slick now, his slit drooling down his legs. Tony bet Steve could smell it.
“As if you could kill me.” Tony swallows and levels a glare without any heat in it at Steve. From this, he knows he has Tony. Tony is listening at the very least.
“It’s Steve.”
“Want your— children, Steve. Want you— to fuck them into me.” The words are broken by Steve’s thrusts. Steve feels almost helpless as he nails Tony once, twice, and three times before he pushes in as deeply as he can go, and
“After protracted coercion, Steve. How do you not see what’s wrong with this? I swear, you are–” That’s all Bruce gets out before the windows shatter.
“Even an old man like me keeps up with the news. You married Tony Stark?”
“Stop, Tony! Stop!” Hands at his wrists, pinning him, as light after light cascades over his form. He’s moving. They’re going somewhere. Without Steve.
So really, he could just skip all that yelling and such and hop on the knot carousel like a good little Omega.
“Steve would want you to show up.”
Impatience takes over Tony, wanting Steve to be the one doing this for Tony, and so he snatches up the plug and draws it behind him, pressing the hard tip to the perfect slot of his hole. Pressing in, he feels the telltale ache, the harsh stretch of it, and Tony lets out an unconscious mewl. It pops in easily, and Tony whimpers, pushing it all the way in with one smooth glide and a shout of Steve’s name.
“Maybe,” Steve says, like he doesn’t believe Tony.
“We’ve made our appearances. There’s no point in staying. I called in my donation earlier.”
Unbidden, the image of Tony plays in his head from their last mission.
When Tony rocks into Steve, he takes this as acquiescence and he
“Hey, I know I am terrible and I accept that. Just one drink, and in front of Loki. It’ll make me feel better,” he wheedles. He doesn’t want the drink specifically, but now that he’s outed as Iron Man to his teammates, putting up a front on his personality doesn’t seem important anymore. What does seem important is liquid courage.
“This is just animalistic need. That’s all this is and it ever was.” The words are out before he can stop them, crisp and cutting. He doesn’t regret saying it. He doesn’t.
Tony has never considered that he would have either of them, much less have to choose.
“Ok, yes. I love you. I love you, Tony.” Tony grunts, crowds himself close to Steve, and comes. Steve feels every filthy pump of the other man’s cock, the warm sluice of fluid a balm on the fissures inside his body.
“The standard issue guns don’t make a dent. They’re getting thicker rounds, but they figured we would be better for containment.” Widow sounds strained as she replies.
“Well, we can cross-reference with our birth, marriage, and death records. See if they pop up.”
“We won’t stop looking until we find something. But you have to accept the fact that he might be gone. And with that, we’ll be looking at new drift compatible candidates for you. Your mind is malleable and we can work with that.”
They stay like that, one being, one soul.
“What? That’s—what in the fuck are you thinking?! I’ve been living like a ghost in my own house trying to escape you!” Chin held high, his voice shakes with rage.
tight, the only sound between them the creaking and buckling of the suit as it brings the enemy closer, closer.
But here it is, offered by both men, freely.
. I want to fix it. I need to fix things, Steve. I’m a mechanic. It’s what I do.” A month ago, Tony wouldn’t have been so openly emotional with Steve, but things have changed. Bucky is his friend, and being around him makes Tony feel like he’s on some kind of adventure he doesn’t have the quest map to, but Steve grounds him. Steve has been there when Tony has needed him, and especially the times when Tony has pushed other people away.
“What’s wrong over there son? Steve, your name is? Natalie told me. Oh don’t cry now, it’s all over. It’s been said and done.” She reaches a leathery soft hand to pat his cheek as tears stream down his face.
“I will sweetheart. I’ll mate you. Just be a good boy and wait for me.”
The time he had spent with Tony in the nest had driven him desperately to his room, and once the door slammed he had torn off his pants and fisted himself to completion within seconds.
“It’s not nothing. Tell me.” Steve’s voice feels like a pry bar, and Tony wants so badly to just let Steve in on his thoughts.
Heat covers him like a veil now, making him languid and easy. Slick leaks out, and Steve’s breath stutters as he scents it before the Alpha goes back to mouthing Tony’s neck like he can’t get enough contact. Tony is filthy wet there with Steve’s saliva, and it feels so right, he begins to cant his hips up, trying to push Steve’s hard cock into the crevice where the warmth from his hole radiates against Steve.
He should have known that nothing about this could remain isolated, idyllic even, as the world bled to pieces. The lab is quiet, the cage that both Steve and Clint have occupied in turns is clean now, waiting for whoever was bitten next. Steve thought it was inevitable that it would happen to someone.
The door jiggles, and Tony hears a muffled “Tony?”
“I wanted to say I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. Clint, I never should have implied you were less than at your job because you are an omega. You’re a great operative, and I’m glad to have you at my back. I had prejudices against omegas, and I realize that now. Is there anything I can do to make it right?”
“Just taking care of something, Tony.”
And that was his mother protecting him. Not from the omegas themselves, but from the lives they were living.
They both go at each other, almost competitive in their movements. Steve twists his head as he pulls up and twists it back as he goes down. Tony opts for tightening his mouth as he squeezes the base of Steve’s cock with it. It makes him want to feel what it would be like to be inside Tony in another way. They both start to thrust minutely, keeping in time with one another’s movements. Steve doesn’t want it to end, but he’s eager to nail Tony to this bed with his cock, make the man feel it for days.
“Look, I feel genuine anxiety when someone asks me what I want to eat. This is ranked a 6 on a scale of sweaty workmen to Tiberius Stone. Do I have to?” Maybe she’s forgotten about how he prefers these things wiped down, since he doesn’t know whose hands it has passed through.
“Out of character.” Tony wildly gesticulates at him, open-palmed hand moving down to up in exasperation.
“Um, Steve, hey.” He feels the sinew and muscles of his wings
And no one wants a pity fuck, least of all Tony Stark.
“Do you want to find out?” He’s not above using a gag on Tony, if it’s needed.
Tony grabs the letter and the lockbox. The lockbox holds a fingerprint scanner and Tony presses his finger against it, waiting half a second before the box beeps and unlocks, revealing a key.
“Fuck.” His gut suddenly churns with pain and he takes a stumbling step forward. It roils again, rumbling from his stomach up to his ribs and down to his groin. He falls to the ground, curling in on himself. Looking up at the path to escape, he sees that the wolf has come to stand before him, stock still and watching.
Mainly, that Bucky, as an Alpha, needed to be able to knot. Invasive, expensive, and profoundly painful in its recovery, Bucky had chosen to undergo the procedure to become a full-fledged Alpha.
When Steve looks back, he’ll wonder why he didn’t think of this sooner. How long had this been haunting him without Steve knowing the shape of the specter?
“Tony?” Steve scents the air, super soldier senses so much stronger than the average human. “Why’re you drinking? Did something happen?”
“No. I’m not going to take it. Anthony needs a keeper. I would be failing my friend if I allowed him to go on like this.” It’s decided. Anthony is not going to like this, he can already tell. The man is vibrating with pent up energy, tapping his fingers on his leg while his eyes twitch and his brows furrow.
And Steve is that ideal. When Steve had closed the portal, he’d made the right call. A call that if the situation had been reversed, Tony’s not sure he could have made. Even knowing now what waited beyond the portal. There’s an inaccessibility to the Captain. He’s beautiful, but like all things beautiful, he is indifferent. Tony wishes being a good person could erase the terrible things he’s done. Steve is so far above Tony in morality and place, that it makes no sense for Tony to admire the man. He can’t ever aspire to him, can’t be seen as a viable option for mating or close friendship. Not that he’d want to hitch wagons with Mr. Self Righteous. He wasn’t that much of a masochist. It hurts anyway.
“Can I go now?” Tony’s face is closed, and he looks so very sour. It’s enough to make Steve feel some amount of regret that this is happening. It’s not Tony’s fault he is the way he is. He’s been left unattended for too long after his parent’s deaths.
“This is urgent.” It sounds that way, but does SHIELD have to call their favor in right now? Right this very second?
“Oh! Oh. Let me—” Father Jacobs bolts up from his seat and closes the basement door and looks outside the sacristy into the church before closing that one too. “There we go, that’s about as private as I can get it. Now, I’d ask you how long since you last confessed, but we’ve divined that already, haven’t we?”
“And why wouldn’t Tony think it’s a training accident?”
“I think he wants to be my little fuck toy. Permanently. Don’t you Tony?” Bucky doesn’t bother to look at Tony, instead stepping forward and in front of him in order to block Steve from reaching him.
Tony can hear a high pitched, long whine. It’s him, he knows it’s him, and he bites down on the words that want to come streaming out of his mouth. He’s given enough of his shame to Steve that he refuses to give one more inch over to the man. Steve is hunched over him now, teeth to Tony’s skin, so close to his glands, a fierce ache settling into his used body that zings up from his ass to his neck.
He wishes for a détente, like a teacher in a schoolyard shoving bullies apart, but for that to happen, for him to referee, he has to know what the problem is. And that’s the thing—he doesn’t know.
Instead, Tony gasps brokenly, heat rolling up his cock, into his body and down his spine where it explodes in his head. His back bows, bearing down on Steve’s fingers that he’s shoved in, which are squelching into Tony at a rapid clip.
It’s then that the Captain accuses Tony of something he frankly doesn’t deserve.
“Why doesn’t he know any better?”
There’s a slight shift, and the Vendorian gives up the game, sloughing off its disguise and changing into a chittering, thin cephalopod-like alien with six tentacles writhing all around it, along with the one that’s inside Tony.
“I’m glad you’re still talking to me. I was wondering if I could confide in you.”
“And what would it be like if you had no self control?” His soon-to-be Omega is smiling as he speaks now, blush dappling the tops of his cheeks as those beautiful crinkles of skin ride up to his eyes and the happiness leaks straight into them. Tony is alluring, engrossing with his straight white teeth and just wide-enough mouth. Steve wants to pull his hips forward, leaving Tony spread out in front of him. Wants to see those doe-brown eyes widen and invite Steve to do whatever he wants to Tony’s lithe body. And there are so very many things Steve can and will do.
“I’ll sell my stocks and look into mutual funds.” Tony’s voice is mechanical, and the omega takes a hand to rub his forehead with. Steve feels tension loosen. Tony can be biddable; he just has to knuckle down on making sure Tony follows the rules, and eventually they will get there to a point where Tony is, if not a model omega, at least a passable model of one.
“Should we go help rebuild them? It’d put SHIELD in your debt.” He’s wheedling, he knows, but he loves to get Tony riled about things. The man is ever so animated when he’s ranting. Steve thinks Tony knows he’s being baited and does not care in the slightest.
So he allows himself this. He shuts away his discomfort. He leans into his arousal, letting it color in the lines of his thoughts.
Bucky.
until I’m
“Fire away.”
The problem starts with Tony. Fiercely independent, he’s done everything possible to keep himself unattached. And it’s been successful.
He pushes his hips back to meet Steve’s thrusts, whimpering and crying, unabashed. A single twirl around the length of his cock, and he implodes. Hot, white-out pleasure races from the tip of his head down to the base of his scrotum, tightening up into his ass as it spasms around Steve’s hands. Cum shoots out of his jerking cock in fine, thready ropes that paint his belly and the bed below.
“I can’t help it. You could pick a different punishment.”
There’s no possible way that this army couldn’t find their way to earth at some other place and time. This isn’t the kind of army that you use to conquer a city; this is a planetary invasion.
“And you have to come to the realization that they might not.”
Tony turns and walks towards his room, already starting to unbutton his jacket and his shirt. They get inside and Tony disrobes quietly, without fanfare or any shyness.
When Tony does, he looks at Steve with a sourness that Steve thinks he’s going to see a lot of.
“This isn’t for Fury,” Thor says.
Steve hears a siren song, pulling him to the depths of an ocean of pleasure, and it molds around him like liquid heat. Steve must rise, to meet his omega at the edge of Tony’s need, and beyond it.
“Please, Steve!” Steve groans around Tony, his own cock pressing down harder.
Steve’s pace stutters, once, twice, and then he’s knotting Tony, the sore give of him opening for Steve, allowing the man to bind them in flesh. It still feels like the first time. Like the last time. Steve’s forehead is pressed to Tony’s back as the Alpha lets each of their orgasms wash over them with reckless abandon, groaning into Tony’s skin. A loss of control that Tony doesn’t want to touch again. He is
“I’m sorry Tony, Bruce is gone for the day. So are Nat and Clint. It’s just me.” Steve sounds a little bitter as he says that, and Tony imagines that Steve wishes Bruce were here too.
“So this is about money?! What about the creation of an underclass of people that don’t have access to Extremis?”
“No, let me finish. I’m sorry I lied to you once, and then again. I’m not Alpha, or beta. Or maybe even an Omega. Not anymore.” Her eyes are piercing green in the low light, a contrast to the lighter tones he’s seen during the day, as if her eyes change colors under their own power.
“I just don’t believe you. Just go. Leave.”
“I’d like to speak to Captain America alone.” Fury eyes Tony, using a slight alpha tone. Steve sends affirmation along the bond, while Tony feels trepidation at what they’ll ask Steve to do.
Thank god Fury didn’t care to speculate on what they thought about the nature of their relationship. Only that it was effective. Only that so few people were mentally aligned enough to endure the rigid abuse of the suit together, and come out alive and sane.
“Do I have to?”
It changes everything. Suddenly the position isn’t so much about beating Tony, but something else far more sinister. When Steve’s hand slides down and his fingers curl into Tony’s waistband, Tony knows instantly what Steve wants.
“JARVIS, find me a way into that ooey gooey center.” Tony’s decided to take one of the big dogs—whales—on. It’s teeth look like sharpened dinner plates in its narrow, reptilian head. If he could catch it in the eye, that would be a major win. But as he gets close, he realizes he doesn’t see any.
Of course, Fury spots him and disengages with Hill, making his way over to Tony. He darts around to look for his honey bear, only to see him hamming it up with some Air Force bros in the corner. Longingly, he searches for Pepper, and sees her engaged with Sunset Bain. And he’s too kind to spoil that kind of fun for her.
He clicks out of the documents, and back to the search screen.
“This is beyond you, metal man. The Tesseract belongs to Asgard and Loki will face Asgardian justice!”
Steve is
Nature is horrid.
He was still going to have to get him back though for crashing his birthday party that had mostly been filled with people he couldn’t give a rat’s ass about. Hashtag Let Iron Man Pee. It had been an urgent mystery that wasn’t going to solve itself! Yet the look on Pepper’s face as he made a fool of himself, of Iron Man, in front of a crowd of coked up strangers wasn’t leaving his brain. Granted, Tony had spent some time out of the suit, to give credence to the narrative that he wasn’t Iron Man. But it was too opportune to not give himself a little present in the form of pretending, just for a moment, that everyone was in on his little secret.
There aren’t any couples that he listens into as intently as last time on the train, and he feels sort of sad about that. He’d like to see more of these modern relationships.
“So no more accosting me in the halls or trying to kill each other with eye contact?” Tony says lightly.
He’s not hiding in the containment area now, per se, but he’s not interested in company either. Which is of course where the Captain finds him.
“Something amazing, something Tony did badly, and something I did badly.”
“Tony, you’re a good friend, but wait five minutes and you can go be shameless in the tower,” Bruce says, a wry smile on his face.
Thankfully, everyone is kept out while he seizes in the hospital bed, teeth grinding against a mouth guard until his jaw aches. They pump him full of sedatives and anti-inflammatories as they tsk over his bold stupidity.
“I got out though. After years of Conall punishing me for something or other by tying my leash to the bed and tying my hands behind my back. More fool he, I’d been slipping that leash at home since he got me to marry him. He used to be kind, Conall. He used to like me singing. But after we went home, he told me that my voice was for him, and he didn’t want anyone else to hear it. So I stopped, but for church. And even then, he didn’t like that either. It was the church that helped me get out, you know. They knew people. People that could help.”
“And what if he is?” Half-hard in his pants now, their faces are leaning closer over the bed, breath warm on each other.
“Don’t worry Rogers, I didn’t listen to you in the first place, and it’s not like you ever checked.”
“Good. The undershirt stays on. I have scars. I don’t want you to look at them.”
“Fury didn’t say he was calling in Iron Man.”
He felt a slither of guilt under his skin, the kind that only Steve could make him feel.
“No, Tony. I know you can handle yourself. I just thought—well I thought maybe I was supposed to help you. But I realize now that it doesn’t help. Though I honestly hope you don’t have to see him that often, or ever, alone. And that I can be by your side.”
“No, Tony, that’s not—” Steve tries.
“Generous of you,” Tony snorts and then looks afraid for a moment, at Steve.
“Well, I don’t have any other explanation for it. But it’s no matter. I’m going to take some stabilizers, knock it out of my system.” It’s matter of fact and Steve clenches his fists.
“Steve, I…” Tony trails off. This was nothing and everything like he imagined it. He doesn’t know what to say, what to impart to Steve to let the other man know how much this meant to Tony. Because it does mean something. He felt the sheer outpouring of Steve’s desire, his love for Tony, and it humbles him to know that Steve feels so deeply for him.
“I promise I’ll stop terrorizing SHIELD. If you give me what I want, I won’t kill another soul. Sounds good, doesn’t it Steve? A fair deal.” Steve tightens, his grip on the table in front of him unable to crack the reinforced material.
“The only reason I haven’t asked Nat for help is because Tony will perceive all of this as a betrayal, and if SHIELD and myself are the only people he’s mad at, I stand a better chance of having him forgive the transgression.”
But, amazingly, there’s also a sense of relief at the idea that it’s just sex. The wolf doesn’t want to rip him to shreds, or it already would have. Tony can always get back to camp and clean up the bite mark. It may be dark all around him, but he’s sure that he can just go the direction he came from and find where he’s supposed to be. Hope curls through him, and he tries to shunt all the other sensations he’s experiencing away. He just has to endure. No matter how sick and wrong this is, it
“Crushed a couple rose bushes, but hopefully we can get those back up and blooming.” The statue is a saint that he doesn’t recognize, and it’s laying on its side in the garden bed. He walks in and grabs it, hoisting it up, and places it upon its pedestal. He wiggles it from side to side to make sure it’s lodged on tight, for good measure.
“It’s a very good thing then, that it’s just a few nights. Most aren’t worth keeping around, it’s true.” She said, demur, but with a certain kind of temerity when it came to admitting the product was flawed. Tony agreed: Alphas were cancelled.
When the screen comes up, he sees chaos. Videos of a giant green man laying waste to the area around him. A piece of technology that should rightfully be in SI’s hands if he’s correct, but has somehow been jacked by a Norse-freaking-god.
“You should be grateful I opened him up for you. He took three fingers and looked so good doing it.” Bucky sneers at Steve, arms crossed, his face triumphant.
“Won’t bother you again.” Tony’s fingers enclose Steve’s, and he pets at them, trying to scrape the essence of what Steve has done off of them. Steve belongs to Tony, and Tony belongs to Steve, and if their deaths are Steve’s, then they’re Tony’s as well. The tight squeeze of his gut begins to loosen, and he feels delirious relief swell inside of him.
Steve whispers, almost to himself. Tony feels the warm churn of the reactor tech, revving up its power to deliver a single, focused blast to the enemy. The structural integrity of the suit is holding;
be over at some point. Making it there is all that matters.
Finally, he strides towards an oblivious Tony, finding himself standing behind the man’s chair, looking at a computer screen with endless numbers and letters in wild configurations. Steve snaps the hacking device to the back of the chair. It’s close enough.
“Give me my plate and get out.” Steve does so, knowing that it’s pointless to argue about it.
It’s around 3 am when Clint first stirs, the machines hooked up to him screeching that the situation has changed. Steve has spent most of his time with Tony in the lab, but Tony is out looking for food, and Bruce and Steve are the only ones on hand to help Clint wake up. Natasha had been carried to her room after spending several days in medical by Clint’s side. It had taken a complete lack of sleep to get the better of her to the point where anyone could drag her from her friend’s side.
He wants to have more.
Barnes to feel what it was like to have someone punch his father in the face so hard that he died. To know what a hand held tightly around his throat felt like, for his mother. Tony is sick with it, the desire to crush everything that Barnes is into
“I’ll see what I can do.” How smug could a smug intelligence director smug? Very, was the answer.
Tony can’t stop insulting Steve, because if he does, he’ll do more than obey. He’ll be whatever is closest to happy.
Trevor’s hard eyes rise to the surface of his thoughts and they superimpose over Tony’s. He doesn’t want Tony to look at him that way, to hate every alpha including him, for the betrayals of his gender.
“It doesn’t matter. I still won’t knot you. You don’t deserve it.” At that Tony’s face morphs into something hurt and vulnerable. He steps away from Steve, touching the front of his chest in a way that looks like he’s reassuring himself of something. The skin around his eyes is pinched now, and his shoulders curl down over his chest.
“You know I was responsible for the death of those agents yesterday, don’t you? I love how you don’t even care anymore.” Steve did care, it just wasn’t enough to keep him away from Tony. And how he hated himself for that. Tony wasn’t shy about claiming lives if they stood in his way. Steve tried to tell himself that Tony didn’t intentionally kill; he killed by what he deemed necessity.
“Show some respect.” The Captain is apoplectic, and it’s glorious. Tony swears he’s seconds away from stomping and gesticulating. Or maybe he’s one of those guys that gets even more self-contained. Tony doubts it. He thinks Cap wants to tussle. A stray thought about how fun it would be to be pinned by all that power invades his mind, and he tells his inner Omega to shut its trap.
“Language. I’m agreeing to this because it’s clear you need minding. Maybe Howard didn’t intend for me to be alive and there, but he certainly wouldn’t have intended your behavior.”
Instead, he feels like when she died, she took with her the piece of Tony that she’d claimed for herself. He’d never gotten it back. He needed to get it back from her, but he very well couldn’t reach into the grave to scoop it out of her dead body. No, she had eaten it, and now she would never divulge her contents again. Whatever journey her sad soul took, that piece of him went with.
“Ok, ok, now, the new Armani or the Gucci?” If they wanted a show, they would get one.
His shame spiraling down the drain, he goes back out to pick up the dishes before heading back to bed.
“Steve, that was fucking amazing. Are you going to eat that? What is it? Oh, did you get any garlic bread? You gotta try that next time–”
Steve is already arranging a routine for Tony in his head, examining where he’s going to have to interfere with Tony’s life to get the omega man on track. Lifestyle is a special problem. Steve needs to see that Tony is behaving himself in a professional manner by being the best example of an omega example that he can be. He’ll have to cut down on Tony’s spending and maybe even cull clothing that’s not appropriate. Alphas did this all the time for their omegas in his time. Surely it’s not fallen too out of style.
The lab is the same as it always is, and that’s a comfort to Steve. It’s bold and beautiful, and everything that Tony represents. He’s there currently, tittering at some piece of technology. Tony doesn’t turn around, though Steve thinks that the other man knows he’s there.
there. Waiting. Like nothing is different or wrong. Tony knows he’s no longer entrapped by the quaint notions of his formally moral self, but Rogers doesn’t know, or he shouldn’t. “Ok second rule here, no angsty freakouts. You’re done pitching a fit. Also, that name. It has got to go. What’s your real one?”
“Steve, yes, please, please, please.” Tony is chanting now, his words coming out in soft little mewls. As Steve positions himself behind Tony, he can’t resist looking down between their bodies. Steve groans when he sees Tony’s wet hole dripping spend and slick between his perfectly curved cheeks. He reaches out to touch the pucker of Tony’s hole as Tony tries to back into it, moaning and looking for friction.
His new life after his body was altered had been one of relative ease and achieved expectations. Steve had never been the kind of omega who wanted flashy things and an alpha’s knot. He’d never been interested in the slightest, and nor was he capable of heats when he was young, so he’d never gotten married. It was further affirmation that his body now was as it should be.
The nest is warm, and while it’s not very clean, the fabric is still soft and pliable. He lays there for a while, thinking about Tony and how an omega’s heat is not the terrible thing he thought it was. He’d been under the impression that it was a burden for an alpha and an omega to endure. But this has been anything but. It’s the most intimate thing he’s ever experienced in his life, something he feels like he was born to do.
He snaps his jaw shut and gives a terse nod.
Steve keeps coming inside Tony for what must be minutes. It goes on and on, scooping his insides out and pouring them into Tony. It’s a sensation he knew could happen, was possible, but the experience is heart-stopping, mind-altering. His body feels like it’s expanding to fit the whole universe and his world is exploding outward and inward at the same time. If there are seams to his person, they’re coming undone and Steve is falling to pieces inside Tony.
“I can see we’re not going to agree, but I’ll take what you said under consideration.”
But he realizes that even though omegas aren’t property anymore, a married omega has fewer rights than an alpha. They have no protection against sex without their consent, and even though what Steve has done is despicable, it’s not yet illegal. Steve can’t believe what he’s done now. He knows that none of these omegas likely deserved their circumstances, the ones that brought them here.
“What’s wrong now? Don't tell me you did something to Stark you shouldn’t have. Fucking damnit didn’t we go through this?”
Steve gives him another once over, eyes going down to his chest before flicking back up to Tony’s face.
The next morning he gets up for a run, feeling exhausted from restless dreams that leave him with morning wood that only abates under a cold shower.
“Why Captain, is that the name of your sex tape?” He fixes the Captain with a lascivious smile, so that the other man knows he’s talking to him, before turning back to Banner and listening for the telltale sputter of one Steve “teasable” Rogers.
Tony leans forward, his forehead rubbing on Steve’s sweat-slicked back, the wet hair tickling at his skin. Steve is still hard, waiting on Tony’s pleasure.
Tony hums, noncommittal. The less he talks to the Captain, the better. When he reaches the helicarrier, he’ll shuck his suit off and have JARVIS take over. That way, when Tony Stark does meet the Captain, he can ensure that he controls the stage. Tony is good at this. But what is he not good at?
He manages to look composed, while the others look on at Loki. He’s so grateful they haven’t noticed. This thing with Steve is freaking him the fuck out, but all he can do right now is keep some distance between them.
“Yeah, yeah, I get warned about it all the time. What are you going to do, gag me?”
“Yeah, I heard that.” Steve wants to swallow his own tongue. He hit Tony. He can acknowledge that now, that he hit him. Steve had done that with his own two hands.
“Good, good Omega.” He’s so proud of Tony, admitting that. His Omega is perfect. And it’s enough, including his rough, last thrusts, to make him explode inside of Tony. Steve groans, pressing his expanding knot inward while Tony squeaks with shock and cries unintelligibly. It’s the perfect moment to watch Tony’s face come apart, and Steve yanks at Tony’s cock ruthlessly, forcing his orgasm to bubble up to the surface as Tony paints both of their stomachs with hot threads of cum.
“Why not? I have more money than God.” Tony gives him a questioning look.
“I can endure that.” Steve nods, crossing his arms.
been omega. And if Erskine hadn’t come along… He’d be an omega, and likely dead. He never would have gone to war with Bucky, met Peggy, met
“Time to test something, sweetheart.” Fisting both wrists in one hand over Tony’s head, he gently presses two fingers into Tony’s mouth. Instinctively, Tony starts to bite down, but it’s not hard. His Omega is straining now, looking consternated at the inability to close sharply on Steve’s fingers. The tentative beginning-bond formed by what Tony has swallowed is there.
Steve realizes that this isn’t going to be as easy as he expected it to be. Pepper seems convinced that Tony’s place was doing exactly what he was doing, which he didn’t think he’d encounter opposition to. But here it is in front of him.
Steve takes a moment to look at Tony, gorgeous in his well-fitted suit. The front is unbuttoned as he drives, showing his nice heather-colored vest. The pocket square is a bit more ostentatious, or at least loud.
“How can you say that? Everything I did, everything I do, is for you. Even though they were the wrong things to do, it was only with you in mind.” Tony has to understand him, and see reason. They just spent Tony’s heat together, and it was meaningful, beautiful. Why would Tony want to throw that away?
After peeling the suit off, and storing it in a SHIELD approved containment unit, he makes sure to summon one of his old suits to the carrier as a precaution in case they have to fight again. He’d had to wrench the crushed gauntlet off, and now he’s not so sure he can get it back on again. Checking his watch, he figures the new suit will be here in an hour or so. Plenty of time to start looking for that weighted companion cube, aka the Tesseract, and euthanize it.
. His omega thought the food he provided was good. Maybe Tony would let Steve feed him more things.
Another yes.
“So you can you get pills?” The idea is fire now, burning through his mind and seeking all the places where Tony has damaged their relationship. Those things can be repaired now. They can’t be saved, but they can be regrown with a new identity for Tony. Steve just knows it.
It’s three hours this time before Tony wakes up, and when he does, it’s like he’s forgotten everything that had happened before and is reaching for Steve as if Steve has salvation for him.
“I’m not here for that. I just wanted to have dinner with you.” It’s the wrong thing to say. Tony tilts his head and narrows his eyes.
There was so little time left and far too many projects to do.
“What should I do?” What should he do? He wants to say he doesn’t know how he ended up in this situation, but he realizes now that he should have at least been making sure Tony got enough food.
“Tony, you know what I think already. You need to take breaks. Here, let me give you a shoulder rub. Come to the couch.” Steve gestures at Tony, hands curving in to pull him forward.Tony goes to Steve, tethered to Steve’s request like a balloon, floating forward, reeled in.
“I guess not. I’ll go get the nest things for you?”
It doesn’t seem to matter, as Steve grunts on top of him, his hands stretching Tony’s cheeks wide apart, the seams of his rim pricking with painful sensation. He doesn’t know how much more of this he can take.
He’s going to add more.
“I shouldn’t have brought you here. Into this. I don’t know what I was thinking.” Tony hugs his knees to his chest and looks away from Steve.
They’re both watching each other, tense, but Tony, ever the brave one, strips down first. His cock is half hard and it bobs as the waistband catches it, revealing a neatly trimmed mound of flesh where his pretty pink cock rests over his balls. Steve’s mouth waters and he licks his lips, thinking about getting his mouth around Tony.
As he disembarks from the train, the couple lingers in his mind, taking up space and forcing him to question his views on food. Perhaps now it’s ok for alphas to do that sort of thing, but in his time it was looked down upon. Steve has always been a good cook. And it was ok to do when it was just him and the Howlies. It’s not like there was anyone else to cook for them.
Finally, they’ve worked through every viable piece of robot that’s left to where none of it is moving. Steve for one is glad that they don’t do as much cleanup. He thinks that whatever two-bit villain did this wasted a lot of metal and technology.
“Hey, poking Banner is what Jesus would have done.” Steve does not like his tone, he knows this, but Tony’s not stopping now. “You’re tiptoeing big man. You need to strut.” He tells Banner.
The Iron Captain is built for so many things that it doesn’t know what it wants to be. It’s as eclectic and strange as its pilots: glutted with power, but fast as lightning. Built to endure, but outfitted with delicate components that inevitably ended up wrecked. State of the art reactor tech, but the oldest drift tech in the stable. The kind that was unforgiving, and required perfect balance between its pilots. They are the only pilots who can stomach its rigorous mental requirements.
“No, Tony no, it’s ok. Shh, sweetheart.” Tony starts to squirm underneath him, but he’s locked together with Steve by the knot, and there’s no escape for the omega as he whines and tries to pull away from Steve. “Tony, stop, sweetheart, shh, stop struggling.”
Steve had him on his back now, fingers tracing gently up Tony’s slit, over to his cock, the blunt fingernails dragging over velvety skin. The red head of his cock was drooling precum, and Tony watched in slow motion as Steve leaned down and ever so gently stuck his pink tongue out to taste. He groaned when he swiped some of the liquid away from Tony, and without compunction, shoved his tongue into Tony’s waiting cunt as he sucked Tony down and into his throat.
Again, silence.
Steve doesn’t want this to end, and he wants to stay here with Tony, both of them addled by the sweet sickness of heat that’s overtaken Tony. Nothing he’s ever done or had with anyone before has come close to this feeling of wholeness, completeness that he feels with Tony now. Tony is perfect. He’s everything. Steve doesn’t feel so alone in this world anymore, because of Tony. The creeping sensation of the ice has receded with the introduction of Tony’s warmth.
Such loss of life is unprecedented. No matter if they win, they’re going to have lost.
“Ok, I don’t understand why or how, but I agree with what you’re saying.”
“Right.”
“What is this? We’re getting called for every little thing now?” Iron Man is already tapped into their coms.
There’s something about it though, where he feels like he’s a part of it somehow. Like he’s right in the center of it in a way that the other Avengers are not.
“I’m going to need you inside me. Take me over to the couch and fuck me until all I can think of is you.” The words tremble through Steve, and he shivers all over before standing up and looping an arm around Tony’s legs and middle, sweeping him into a bridal carry. The couch isn’t far, and he carefully tilts Tony onto it, the omega falling to the cushions on his hands and knees with his legs spread, a thick film of fluid coating his supple cheeks.
“Just good to work with you. I’ll see you around sometime, yeah?”
You know that’s what I love about living now, in this time though? I can tell you all of this. Back then, it was shameful. Us omega women stuck together as best we could, and we tried to get some of the male omegas into our clutches too, but some of their mothers wouldn’t have it. Thought they were protecting their children from the worst of it, I think. And maybe they were, what with male omegas being allowed in the army at the time. A lot of us were going through it together. Brenna and Colleen had it the worst. I always wondered what happened to them. We all did our best, smiled pretty outside, but inside, things weren’t right.”
Then, as surely as it ended, Steve woke up to Tony sitting up in the darkness, and then… Now Steve was here. Lonely. Alone. Empty.
“What are you talking about, Tony?” Steve feels desperation come over him. Something’s gone so off the rails that he’s afraid of how to steer the train back onto the tracks. Tony has a propensity for running people over when they try to get him to do something he doesn’t want. That’s not a position Steve wants to be in; he’s found himself against these kinds of odds before with an Alpha Tony many, many times. He wants this, to cling to the cloying and calm aura that’s started to saturate Tony. The one that calls to him now in a way he’s always been waiting for. His perfect Omega.
“I guess we will.”
“You think I’m not? SHIELD has like ten different motivations for doing something before breakfast. Fury didn’t call me until now. Why? He’s not telling us something. The man is a spy. He’s the spy. His secrets have secrets.” It’s almost unbelievable how Rogers doesn’t see this. Is the man just that naive? The ice must have done something to his brain if he thinks that everyone has the best of intentions. Except for Tony, of course. Tony hadn’t even been born when Cap disappeared, so it’s not like Howard could have spoiled Rogers already on what a piece of shit Howard thought his son was.
“You won’t do anything because it would upset Tony.” She doesn’t move away from him as she makes her declaration.
“No! Don’t touch me!” The vehemence with which he spat out the words surprised even him. Steve looked wide-eyed, an innocent expression pasted across his gorgeous face.
When Tony leaves the hospital, he feels Steve’s shadow, even though the man isn’t present.
“I’m fine being an old Omega harridan with cats, except instead of cats, robots. It’s a perfectly acceptable life choice, given that robots don’t even shit in a box. No offense, JARVIS.”
Creating the new Reactor that would go into his chest was a thing never before seen on this earth, a leviathan event of such breadth and complexity, that when Tony finally shoved it into its socket, the Arc Reactor could only respond like Carrie White at the prom, rotating and spewing out energy. Tony thinks it’s the best school dance he’s ever been to.
He’s grabbing Tony another drink when he returns to find Tony in the company of a single alpha. The man is tall, like Steve, and blond, but after that, the similarities end. From across the room, Steve can see this man leer at Tony, noting the way he tilts his face just so to catch the scent from Tony’s gland. Steve sees red, and blackness creeps into the corner of his vision as he stalks over to them.
Steve wants to know every part of Tony. Every patch of skin and bone that makes up his love. Tony shivers and shudders under his exploration, eyes screwed closed from the sensation.
“That’s it. Show me how good you take it. Next time it’ll be my knot. Fill your hole full of my come until you’re crying. I’ll make you so full, you’ll
Bucky steps back, seeming to admire his handiwork, leaving Tony a panting mess. Tony gazes at him warily, despite the endorphins that make Tony want to slouch into Bucky.
A quick glance around the bar notes almost exclusively humanoid forms, and Tony breathes a sigh of relief. He knows what he’s here for. He’s agreed with the rest of the Avengers that he’s still the best person to do it. But damn if he’s just relieved each time he goes out that he scores at drinking establishments more frequented by vertebrates that have two legs and two arms than the alternative.
“I can see that. Good luck Tony. You’re going to need it.” Ty looks red in the face as he strides off to destinations unknown.
tight, letting himself to come, and come, and come.
Steve settles in, waiting for something, for Tony.
“More. Deeper.” Tony is not above begging. He loves Steve to the very depths of his being, and through him, he feels the ghost of Sunset’s neck, of Ty’s broken body, and the empty hunger of Killian broken beneath him. He stands atop those feelings, striding like a giant. With him throughout is Steve, pulsing inside of him with a steady throbbing. Steve, who is the better half of his soul, his dark north star.
“I’m good?” Tony asks, hesitant and coltish, even as he sits pinioned on Steve’s cock. Tony’s face is brittle, like glass that breaks with a touch. There’s a sadness in Tony, buried deep and hard to see, but easy to feel. It’s untouchable, even with Steve’s hands over Tony’s skin. But Steve tries to reach it nonetheless, to eradicate it.
“He was the one who tried to get your suits, yes? I bet the paperwork saying no hit him so fast he needed reconstructive surgery.” Now Tony cackles at Nat’s crack at the Senator in question. Nat places a proprietary hand on Tony’s shoulder.
“I can’t comment on that. But I think you need to prioritize his health. Is what he’s doing harming himself or someone else?”
. Cap’s shield is more than a match for his armor.
“Would you have him another way?”
,” he begs.
“I treasure Tony as an omega. I want to take care of him.”
A growl emanates from deep in his chest as he stalks over to the consolation prize that is his breakfast.
Once in front of it, he knocks carefully, as if anything more forceful will send Tony a message that Steve doesn’t deserve to be with him.
“Maybe, or maybe I never considered why I’ve always thought you’re the most beautiful when you’re in pain.” Tony sucks in a breath. He doesn’t know where this is going. Of all the things that Steve could confront him with, the admittance that Steve
Steve chuckled and manhandled Tony to the bed, forcing him flat on his stomach. Tugging at Tony’s pants, Tony got with the program and unbuttoned and unzipped himself, letting the legs slide over his skin until he’s down to his boxers and a shirt. Steve made short work of the former, leaving Tony exposed. His wings flap once, twice, before settling out on either side of him.
“Tony, tell me what you want sweetheart.”
“Looks like you’ve got something figured out, doll.” Bucky is the first to move, uncrossing his arms and resting his palms along his knees, strings of wet hair falling out of his messily tied bun.
“And you think he’ll come to see that I do care for him?”
“Bite me, Steve. Claim me. Fuck—”
“An errand, that’s all.”
Tony stays in the Iron Man suit after the attack. The Captain had listened, done what he’d needed in order to get the engines back online. It would have been refreshing if it didn’t compound the fact that he could never let the Captain find out about his identity if he could help it.
They move him out on a stretcher to medical, Bruce, Thor, and Natasha carrying Clint with them. That just leaves Tony and Steve.
Steve wants to bite Tony again as Tony nuzzles at his neck. But he remembers what Tony said and instead just runs his tongue over his teeth, reliving the first time he bit into Tony at their wedding. Tony had tasted so good, he remembers, but at the time he hadn’t wanted to think of that at all. Now it’s all he wants to remember, to cherish that singular moment that bound Tony to him. He wants to rewind—no, he wants to unmake—everything he’s done to Tony to keep himself from this moment.
“I think it’s too late. I think it’s far too late.”
His whole body lights up in arousal.
Steve isn’t here right now.
Tony’s arm flops against the empty bed besides him. Steve’s scent has only just faded, like he had been here next to Tony moments before. The rays of light from the window leave the bed warm and toasty, but it’s not the same as Steve’s arms around him.
The thought of Tony pregnant with his pups flows over him, and it is startlingly arousing.
“Well, he drank the other night, which is an overindulgence on its own.”
Is this what Fury and Natasha wanted? Did they want him to come apart?
“He’s right, you don’t smell taken. I should have done something about that before we left, but I forgot to say anything.”
“Bucky! Treat him with respect.”
He wakes up with a shout, body aching as if he’d just gone into the ice. Visions of swirling dark water flow over his mind, and he clenches up, shuddering.
Before he knows it, he’s at the church, and he’s feeling hopeful. Like he might finally be making progress in the right direction. Maybe if he gets a good working relationship with Tony, Tony will be more amenable to learning things with him, like how to do laundry. Steve had seen the pile of clothing in Tony’s room, unfolded and wrinkled on the floor.
Steve understood why the man had done what he did, even if he wasn’t pleased with the results. If Steve had been in a similar position, he maybe would have thought of this solution, though he definitely would not have implemented it. Respect for the dead was the first reason that came to mind.
“So that’s what I’m left with? An alpha who has good intentions, but flawed execution? I think I deserve more than that.”
They’re sealed now, in an incontrovertible bond with one another that no law or force can sever, but for death.
“Gross.” Tony hears Clint say, and he smiles into the kiss, Steve’s lips at Tony’s teeth.
“Five.”
He’d call Sunset brazen, but it would require her to understand she’d done something wrong in the first place. The woman had no fear. She’d gotten away with it.
Tony’s body twists up and bends forward as he comes, his ass leaking around Steve as his cock spurts onto Steve’s chest. Letting go is easy, and Steve knots Tony right there at the climax of Tony’s orgasm, burying himself as deep as he can go and releasing streams of come.
Coyote? Those are common enough.
So here he was, drinking these concerns along with some expensive whiskey. Cowardice, like alcoholism, is a lifelong condition, of which Tony is more than passingly acquainted with.
“–what he’s done–”
“—do.” Tony hits the shield with a well-timed repulsor, sending it flying overhead. He slams another blast into Steve’s chest, shoving him back several feet.
“It’s–well–he just needs to–”
They pull to the curb, and it takes Tony by surprise to look out his window and see Steve’s old apartment building.
well, hips shoving back to meet Steve’s urgent thrusts, rocking upwards until he attains a perfect rhythm between them. They’re glossed with sweat, an almost pearlescent sheen of it, and he licks a hot stripe across Tony’s neck as he takes Tony’s cock into a fist. Tony promptly makes a desperate keening noise, throbbing with unrepressed need as he snaps his hips back.
“Tony?” The other man immediately stops and turns to where Steve is, looking hunted. His eyes narrow and he wipes sweat off his brow as he stands there, waiting. Steve offers the plate then, without saying anything, and Tony slowly comes towards him, sweet scent muted by the clean smell of sweat and hot metal. As he stands before Steve, he can see the bags under Tony’s eyes and a pallor to his face that concerns Steve.
Should he tap his fingers as well, just to multiply the annoyance factor? Yeah, yeah he should.
“Hey. Rough day? Hope Fury didn’t ream you too hard.”
For which Tony was expected to be suitably grateful. But he wasn’t going to be. He’d been ready to accept the Encephalitis due to heat inflammation that would surely put him in a coma, if not, give him brain damage beyond recovery.
“You are harboring the fugitive known as the Teen Abomination.” Maria looks
“Oh Steve,” Tony sighs.
“You know what? I’m sorry, I don’t want to get off on the wrong foot. Do I look at the patch or the eye. I’m gonna say I’m a bit hungover, I’m not sure if you’re real, or if—” Tony said.
“I hate seeing you like this.” Is all Steve says. He looks defeated, shoulders slumped and his face screwed up tightly, lips pursed with what is likely disgust.
“Pancakes?” Steve tries. Lips pressed flat, Tony sets his mug down in a punctuated motion, his jaw set in that usual stubborn way of his, his eyes boring into Steve’s.
So this was good-bye. And good riddance.
He half thinks he should fire a repulsor at Bucky’s head now, and finish it.
“No, I just thought…Well I was thinking that perhaps we could try to get along.”
“Tony, I’m warning you now about your mouth.” He thinks he’s going to have to do a lot of things about it at this point.
Tony Stark takes what the fuck he wants, when he wants it, and doesn’t
“That’s not up to you.” Natalie smoothly slid into the booth with Director Fury, their ease with one another apparent. Of course the government would have access to any kind of scent they wanted.
“I have to be sure that I don’t miss any opportunities with stray Captain Americas that cross my path.” Steve chuckles at that and strokes himself back to hardness. With Tony in front of him, all long lines and mirth, it’s easy to get back to firmness.
“Tony, they’re going to knock you out and intubate you if you can’t stay calm.”
“Is that what you need to feel justified? Then yes. He’s been better than he’s been in the years I’ve known him. And it is that reason, and only that reason, that I am not going to say a word. Unless you screw this up, which you still very much could.”
Tony doesn’t care. It’s only been 48 hours. It’s not enough
He was methodically pursuing an Alpha for heat. Not dating, or asking around, or even soliciting a friend. And if that wasn’t the bee in his iron bonnet, because after this heat, there’d be another heat. The type of inflammation Tony had due to avoiding his heats wouldn’t be cured with a single heat. He needed some therapeutic fucking. Presumably his next heat would be with this same Alpha if he couldn’t find a second one to avoid the first Alpha thinking he had a claim to anything.
But Steve does something much different than expected. He begins to pull at Tony’s armor, stripping him. First, the breastplates come down in chunks, and then the shoulder plates follow after, wires sparking with leftover processes.
“What am I supposed to have heard?” Iron Man crosses his arms, looking quite judgemental for a man in a robot-suit.
Tony’s tired of all this, to be honest, and he’s not one to keep his mouth shut.
Tony is looking down at him as if he’s a ruler on a throne, shifting his hips forward and back, rubbing his abused hole around the circumference of Steve’s cock. Steve’s hands settle at Tony’s hips, gripping him as if Tony could somehow float away and grounding himself even more so. Steve is dehydrated, his muscles standing out in stark contrast to Tony’s softer and leaner curves. Tony splays his fingers on the muscles of Steve’s abdomen, working them over as if he’s tuning some instrument.
Neither of them address him as he arrives, and he takes that as his clue to wade in.
“And what if your serum eradicates the memory block, and you remember? I still won’t, Stevie. And won’t that just be awkward for you?” Tony says. Tony figures if he could just get a leg free, he could make a break for the door. Sure it was locked, but that was a very near future Tony’s problem. Screw Steve’s rut, but not literally.
“Tony?” Oh no. Tony’s wings ruffle and the tips of them shoot out and upward in some kind of display towards Steve, whose eyes are locked onto Tony’s feathers, his cheeks pinkening.
“No, of course not.” Tony searches Steve’s face for a moment after he speaks, but then a small smile appears and Tony tucks his head into the crook of Steve’s neck once more. They stand like that for so long that Steve wants to fall asleep on his feet cradling Tony.
“I mean it, Iron Man. Don’t think I’ll forget.”
“I just thought it was a carrot and stick situation where he would get better if I withheld privileges.”
As he leaves the room, he speculates that while Steve and he share a primitive emotional connection, that doesn’t mean that Steve couldn’t somehow block Tony out, or do disappointing things regarding Tony.
that he’s a cat, that he’s supposed to love the sun and its warmth over his skin. After all, Tony has Steve for that. Steve, who is—
In a series of tragedies, he’d used up his suit’s stash on the last mission and hadn’t replaced them for this one.
“You can take your suit off, you know. It must be sweltering in there.” Steve said.
This is going to be so right, for both of them.
“God, Tony–” Steve approaches and kneels down on the hard floor next to Tony, grabbing his shaking hands off the table and clutching the nearest close to his chest.
He bolts from the bed before the woman can stand on her shaky legs, and makes his way out the door.
When the car is brought to them, they both settle in their respective seats and let a blanket of quiet come over the car. All Steve can hear is the roar of the engines, Tony’s and his breathing, and the sounds of the city.
“Just go to bed.” Steve is done with this evening. He’s exhausted and he feels like he’s betraying himself even now as he looks at Tony and thinks about what Tony would look like nude and splayed out before him. He shoves that thought down, hard, but it keeps rising like there’s air trapped inside of it. Like there’s something substantial to Tony’s claims.
He licks a quick stripe up Tony’s crack, catching a little roughly on Tony’s rigid hole. Coming back around for another lap, he stops and focuses on Tony’s entrance, pleading with his tongue for it to open. It’s so charming how Tony tries to keep his body closed to Steve, but eventually the delicate petals of his ass loosen and Steve has his tongue shoved inside while Tony starts to moan.
“Oh, no, you don’t.”
Things get testy after that. Tony is headbutted.
And then there’s Steve. What would Steve think of Tony taking advantage of his friend? They’re not getting along, but that doesn’t mean you stop being friends. Steve would be so mad. He’s already gone out of his way to do Tony favors. He’ll think that Tony is greedy and that his lust can’t be contained. That’s too close to the truth, given his thoughts about the both of them.
The doors to his room slide open, and Natasha steps through.
Steve is left trying to think about how things have changed so much. He’s so tired of everything that’s new and loud in his ears and eyes. He doesn’t want to think of Tony, but when he finally pushes those thoughts away, he feels cold inside.
“Give it to me. Give it back to me, Steve.” His breath is heavy, like puffs of wind over a discontent sea as he gazes up at Steve. Their arms are slung around each other in lazy satisfaction as Tony begins to mouth at Steve, like a baby animal hoping to be fed from its parent’s mouth. Steve obliges him with peppered kisses and the sweet marrow of what he’s done for Tony.
“No. I won’t. You don’t know anything about me. I’m a person. Not an object!” Tony’s face is flush with rage now, and if he wasn’t so ornery and hard-headed, Steve thinks he might have been attracted to the omega. He doesn’t want one, as so far it’s been so much work. But after all, he does have one. He’d be within his rights to possess Tony. Not that he wants to go anywhere near the man.
“It’s too late, isn’t it. Fuck the rules, I should have called Thor,” Nat mumbled, her hands covering her eyes as she strode away from the bed.
“Uh, I’m just trying to understand more about omegas. I have a betrothal to one, and I’m trying to do right by him, but it’s been hard for me to understand what to do. I was taught some different things. And I just don’t want to hurt him.”
“Kindly fuck off, Doctor,” Fury coughs and says loudly to the room. Dr. Geiszler sputters, but drags his board away, grumbling about the lack of appreciation.
“What’s it to you?”
“—and you start sleeping with me.” Steve steps into his range, bringing their chests flush to one another. Tony backs up faster than a repulsor blast, scrabbling to escape Steve’s personal space.
“You cannot be serious. You can’t do that!” Tony is straining at him, his posture erect and bristled with antagonism. His fists are clenching and Steve has a wild hope that Tony will physically attack him so he can put him in his place easier. It’s best to get the rebellion out of the way early. Break them down so they can be reshaped.
“I surely wouldn’t know what you’re talking about, ma’am,” Steve says, bashful. He lets his Brooklyn accent slip out as well. He was definitely one of those boys she’s referring to.
“We need Tony for the rest of it. I think it’s ready to aerosolize.” While Steve is proud that Tony is a part of the cure, he’s also on tenterhooks regarding his lover. He’s hoping beyond hope that Tony’ll be fine. He has to be fine.
When the music cuts out he knows that Pepper or Rhodey are trying to get him out of the shower, so he acquiesces and hops out, toweling off in front of the mirror. He looks lean, almost anemic, but his hips are still Ganymede-narrow and his skin is olive toned, the bones of his clavicle jutting out at appealing angles. It’s not much, he’s never been much, but he isn’t un-fuckable. Sighing, he throws on a pair of boxers and picks up a robe, strolling out into his bedroom.
But his mental preparation doesn’t seem to matter when he hears the voices that are in Tony’s room from down the hallway as he makes his way towards the kitchen. His hearing is only just better than Bucky’s, which is good, because the two people speaking are Bucky and Tony.
, in real time, as Tony fucks himself for Steve’s body.
Rhodey walked at his side, uniform crisp and gorgeous in the navy blue suit that Tony had not-so-secretly altered and made just a bit better. The fabric looked exactly the same as the standard-issue, but the quality was all in the texture and malleability of the fabric. Pride surged through him to have such a friend as Rhodey. Throughout all these years they’d been together, he’d always shown up for Tony. Been there.
He passes by Nat, who is
“Just going to work on some things on the tablet here. I need you to prep food for the next few days. Easy things to make, because I’m going to be hungry and not very capable of feeding myself. Lots of orange juice, fruits, cheeses, cold meats. Finger foods mostly. Can you do that?”
There’s a storm inside Steve, and he feels the very moment, the very second that Tony’s body seizes up in an answering orgasm to his knot that takes them both up, up, and
Tony was helpless, has always been helpless when it came to Steve.
No. The very idea of being with an omega roiled his stomach. They were needy and wanton, spreading their legs for whomever if allowed. Anthony looked to be no exception. He’d live with the man, he’d help manage the chaos that is his life, but he won’t be lured in by the siren call of an omega’s scent and body.
“What is it with you two?”
“Then you don’t know him as well as I do, Sir.” Tony’s heart is so expansive, it covers the world. The truth of Tony, is that he’s a soft thing, underbelly vulnerable against certain incursions. Like the one that Steve is about to commit to Tony.
“I never thought I’d thank Stark for sleeping with someone, but here we are. You got this Bruce?”
Even if that means Steve is left with nothing.
He tries to feint right, but the wolf doesn’t take it, and walks forward again, this time not stopping its movement at all. Tony, who is terrified out of his mind by this point, decides that he has a better chance of running back to the fire.
“Have you shared a heat yet?”
Being lost in his thoughts, he doesn’t register that Tony is rushing as he gets up from his chair, but as Tony runs over to the sink, he realizes that there’s something wrong. It’s then that Tony vomits, spilling out chewed up red and yellow into the sink. Tony is hunched over it now, arms on either side as he grips the bottom of the countertop. Steve can smell the sour odor of bile and Tony’s distressed scent.
“But not for good reasons.”
an omega like Tony. Tony is a slut, a side piece, who never gets the alpha. Wanting Steve feels like the worst kind of sin, because Steve is
Divorcees don’t receive the same rights. If you were disruptive to your marriage as an omega, there was still a need for you to be under an alpha’s guardianship. But widowed omegas were usually considered to be steadfast on their own, only needing appointed guardians in a few circumstances. Anthony is, of course, a unique case in every way.
“Where are you Tony? Come back.” Steve says, his weight pressing down harder on Tony, if that were possible. If only it could have been uncomfortable, but instead Tony watches as Steve licks his own finger, and swipes it down the glands behind Tony’s left ear, giving Tony the most lovely shiver of
“Sunset? Ty?”
“I’m never that desperate to fuck anything with tentacles, and I think you very well know why you don’t do this to humanoids. Yuck, I’m going to have to get checked out for this. Do you even have the engine?”
However, if he’d never gone into heat at all, never been kidnapped and held in Afghanistan, he wouldn’t be here, spending the last of his time with Pepper like this. He’d have figured out his heat situation a long time ago.
“Weird? Yeah, well, yeah, weird like.” Pepper backed away and wiped at her face, looking downward in awkward embarrassment.
“So tight sweetheart, am I the first? Tell me you’re all mine.”
“I’ll be in DC Tony,” her heels click away as Tony is glued to the screen, half because he doesn’t want to see her leave him, and half because he’s entranced by the video footage. Particularly the centerpiece of all of it, Captain America.
were going to leave behind!”
Rhodey catches him on the way out, Carol a creepy little shadow behind him. Tony no more understands how these two are drift compatible than he understands how Steve and he are. Hidden depths.
The accusations about privacy are laughable. If people think they had privacy before his drones were in place, they were fooling themselves. Tony is in every home, every crevice of technology. Does your fridge connect to your phone? Then as does Tony connect to you. This was just removing the thin veneer of illusory confidentiality. There is nothing Tony is not inside, nothing he doesn’t know.
“Hey, so I’ve got a emergibeacon on me, so don’t think to cross my limits. My ass is yours for an hour, no marks, no pain. I’ve got embedded protection, so no need for condoms. We good?” Tony has a hand on the door as he observes the Andorian. The guy seems to be a little out of it, but he clearly had enough presence of mind to accept Tony’s offer and walk all the way here, so it can’t be that bad. After, they can go get the part they need. Tony has to go get their credit chip first, anyway.
“I don’t think of you that way. I promise I don’t care about those things anymore.”
Nat raises her eyebrows at Steve and taps her fingers on the counter, but doesn’t respond.
“I know. I would give up everything for him, too.”
It’s heaven, and Tony mewled, crying and twitching while Steve fucked into him with determination.
He can’t bring himself to.
That only lasts as long as Bucky isn’t in his space because Tony blinks, and there’s Bucky, hip to hip with him, the knot of his towel digging into Tony as he stands there. The look on Bucky’s face is indescribable but for the fact that Bucky’s eyes are razor-sharp focused on Tony’s face.
Tony gasps as Steve moves, back arching like a bow, body trembling. Steve feels like a child’s balloon, let go to drift through the air and reach ever-higher for the sky. He can already feel his rut coming on, as that’s what it must be. His body forces him to accommodate his omega in all ways, to be everything Tony will require.
“That wasn’t the point of the exercise, Captain. It sounds like you know them and that’s what I needed from you.”
“Ok.” He escorts Tony off the gala floor back to the front entrance. Or it’s more like Tony takes his arm and leads him instead. Steve finds he doesn’t much mind it.
Steve makes the sign of the cross.
He rides the subway back, thinking of the changes he’s going to make in his behavior. He doesn’t believe that it will make a difference, but he trusts the priest’s guidance more than he does SHIELD’s.
“Just come to us when you need to, Tony. Can you promise me that?” Rhodey tries to be so gentle, he does, but it comes out fraught with desperation, with the sick knowledge between them that there isn’t a Tony without Steve. That if Steve doesn’t come back, Tony is never coming back.
“Such a good boy. So pleasing, sweet for me.” Steve is gutting him with rough, deep strokes. It rocks him, his mind as pressed as the pressure inside of him. This was like nothing he’d ever thought, or believed could happen. The pleasure was a peek he was falling over again and again.
“Omega-napping.” Fury pauses, his single eye narrowing and his lips pursing intently.
The workshop always has a quiet buzz of faint electronics to it, a kind of mundanity but for the fact that Tony thrives in the lack of silence. Needs that delicate hum to concentrate, when he’s not playing much louder music.
“This is how it’s going to go. You’re both going to date me, exclusively, and you’re going to be at least cordial with each other, or neither of you are going to date me.”
“You don’t know. You don’t know how I am,” Tony protests. He wants Steve so badly, it aches. He knows that Steve isn’t
Natasha walks in wearing a pair of jeans and a t-shirt, something he’s never seen her in before.
“Caring for someone is not a deficiency, Nat. If you were in the same position as Tony, I would care what’s happening to you.” His voice is as level as he can get it, his pitch low. Steve keeps whisking the pancake batter, using action to hide how he feels inside as best as he can.
Which is when things go to shit. Steve gets a hold of Tony as he tries to fly out of his grip, slams Tony to the ground and mounts him there, fists battering down onto the face plate. Each punch is accentuated by a grunt, and Tony thinks about how he once longed to hear those noises in far more pleasant circumstances.
“Steve?” Tony swivels around to gaze up at him, all soft trust and wide-eyed concern. Steve relishes it, because it’s the last time for a while that Tony will look at him this way.
“They’ll make it. Steve will get him back.”
The sun doesn’t care for Tony’s hatred of it; it rolls in minuscule waves of light over his skin anyway, glittering like stars on a wall, and Tony hides his protesting eyes into his pillow. He doesn’t
, not a single crack leftover.
Steve runs.
“I don’t know how to do that Tony. I’m trying, but it seems like I’m doing the bare minimum.”
“You’re fine with it.” Steve’s tone is as bland as rice.
Tony is none of those things. Pepper is and was right to reject him. He’s never had a chance with Steve, and he has to remember, to keep it in mind always, that he never wanted an Alpha either. He’s never wanted the weight of an immutable bond. There was never going to be a time when he didn’t carry the burden of not belonging. Tony lives on the outside of the world, building things for inside of it, his very own dollhouse that he can’t shrink his ego enough to play in.
“Yeah, well, Steve wasn’t there at the time to reel you in. You’ll be impossible if he doesn’t come back. So, he just has to.” Carol crosses her arms and glares at Tony, as if Tony is the
It’s enough to jar him out of whatever thoughts he had about finding out where this place is. He needs to get out. His tactical mind suggests there are more of whatever she is waiting outside. That’s just how it’s going to have to be. It’s instinctual too, that he should not let these creatures touch him if he can help it, much less bite down.
After a shower for each of them in their respective rooms, Tony locks down the living room using JARVIS and awaits the two alphas while wedged into a fluffy couch with a Starkpad. He could really use a whiskey, but he needs his faculties more. Tapping at the screen, he picks at Iron Man upgrades, sending instructions to his 3d printers in the workshop with almost mindless clicks.
“Because—because they need alphas. Or I thought they did. I don’t—it’s that they’re weak, they’re not capable of—no that’s not right. It doesn’t feel right to say anymore, but I thought they were weak.”
“You like that Tony? Gonna fuck my children into you. Breed you so full.” His words make Tony shiver. Carrying their pups would be a joy. Something his body is made for and he wants with a fierceness that surprises him. He’s never considered himself a family man or deeply contemplated what it would be like to be a mother. He never thought he’d get the chance.
“I think JARVIS would want you to care for yourself first and foremost.”
And hell, he means it.
Clint is a quiet presence next to him, while Natasha’s hovering is louder in attendance, her hands fiddling with Clint’s clothing and trying to wipe the blood off of his wounds.
“JARVIS, electricity to subsystem B5, ping the server to test the latency while running five hundred thousand tasks on the processor.”
The Andorian hadn’t even haggled with him! That should have been the first sign. Tony is such an idiot.
His dress shoes acquired, he goes to wait in the lobby by the elevator.
Steve tentatively enters the room, allowing the door to open slowly. He’s greeted with the sight of Tony in boxers and a t-shirt cuddled up amidst his nest. Tony added all the blankets from his bed too, it seems. He’s in a swirl of fabric, and he looks breathtakingly adorable. His hair is mussed in every direction and he looks at Steve, wide-eyed.
“He just—he needs to be a proper omega.”
Steve thinks that Angela leads a good life so far, and it sounds like her alpha took care of her as best he could. While he wouldn’t take Tony’s money from him, he understood the need to work together to ensure a good future. He wonders what went wrong for that to change.
“Tony, sweetheart, what can I do?”
“Twenty-one.”
“Steve, I need you so bad– Always wanted you, needed you, please–” Tony would beg. Then maybe Steve would touch him.
At least Tony isn’t outright ignoring him. They eat lunch the very next day after their intimate talk that ended with Tony squeaking that he had to work on something very important. Steve let it slide, endeared by the fact that Tony felt so overwhelmed he had to distract himself.
coffee Steve has learned to make. Yes, he’s forced to eat things like toast, eggs, bacon, bagels, donuts—if it’s a typical breakfast food, you could name it and Steve would make it for Tony. In order to acquire said coffee, Tony has to eat, Steve says—but all in all, that’s a fair trade to make.
“I’ve only got so much patience. But, now that you’re here, we can get started.”
“You will all fall before—” Loki takes a repulsor to the chest and slides across the floor.
She takes him to the cafeteria, which isn’t serving food, or shouldn’t be, but seems to have a small buffet laid out on the table that’s surrounded by their friends. Jennifer and Bruce, Thor and Loki, Wade and Peter, Clint and Natasha, Rhodey and Carol. They all look at him without pity, or remorse. It was the Spiderpool suit that rescued them the other night, finally tearing
So yes, Steve is very pleased today. Things are going so well.
He’s really fucked up.
“Tony, is this hurting you? I can stop—” Oh god, Tony’s channel is so very tight, like silken velvet over his cock, soft and taut.
He can’t hold on, not with Tony stretched tight around him, the pink rim gripping with each extraction of his length. Reaching around, he grasps Tony’s cock and starts gently twisting it from base to head and down again. Tony howls into the bed and erupts onto Steve’s hand as Steve follows him, bottoming out and filling Tony up as deep as he can. He wants his cum leaking out of Tony for hours.
“Has he been overindulging?”
Tony thinks.
“I think so. It’s very TMI, but I think it’s possible you’ve given him antibodies through—well, you know.” Bruce is red-faced, hiding beneath his salt and pepper curls and not meeting Steve’s eyes. A sharp bark of laughter comes from Nat’s throat and she gives him the barest hint of a smile.
“A nest isn’t soft enough?” Natasha tilts her head in askance.
It was coming on strong now, like a cancer of the soul where the only chemotherapy was going to be a good dicking down. Tony wondered how this was his life. How in all this modernity he hadn’t been able to find a way to circumvent a most basic biological system in order to give himself a choice in all this. Now he was here, standing outside an ugly door with security code that would take him into what was presumably a sex dungeon that, shudder, Fury had probably overseen the putting together of. Soon after, a random alpha was going to show up and ask for his consent, and Tony wasn’t sure if he wanted to give it.
It hits him then that wolves are dangerous predators, and he probably shouldn’t be encouraging this behavior. He very carefully leans down and picks up a stick before tossing it at the wolf, who stops in his tracks.
Tony hops into the driver’s side of some kind of sleek sports car as Steve gets into the passenger seat. A month ago, he would have insisted on driving, and probably killed them or ruined the car itself.
He makes toast and eggs with some bacon and makes sure not to put too much on the plate. After he eats his own, he readies Tony’s and brings it down to the workshop.
“You’d look so beautiful swollen with my children. I could make you forget what it’s like to be alone in your own body, I’d keep you so overflowing with my seed, my pups.” Steve’s voice is overawed.
“That’s fine then. You can do it under my rule. It’s more power than you have right now, anyway.” He lives to see the outrage on Tony’s face as it passes through, his eyes widening in the blip of a second before they narrow in anger.
The campfire wavers in the distance and he takes another drink. God, it’s gross. Some kind of flavored Brandy.
At this point, he doesn’t care where any of them end up, so long as he gets a shower and some coffee. They can deal with the Tesseract and Loki tomorrow.
“We’re saying circumstances have worked out in your favor, for now.” Nat says.
“I’d say that I’ll be there for him when he realizes, but I think he knows deep down what you’ve done. This is the only way he can have you, so he’s going to take it. No matter what you do, how you love him, or how you treat him, underneath it all is falsehood. Your love for him is a lie you tell yourself.” Nat leaves the room before Steve can respond, though he doesn’t know what he would say.
“Hmm. Good to know you have a line. Something where you’ll say ‘there and no further.’” Tony’s face is back to casual disinterest, as if he hadn’t just been seducing Steve into having his way with Tony. Tony strolls back to his seat, not seeming perturbed in the slightest. “Well, if you have nothing else to say, you can go.”
“It’s not about the contractors, sweetcheeks.”
“Better?”
“Let it go, kitten.”
“I don’t like what you’re insinuating. There are some things you can’t manufacture, Mr. Stark. You’ve got to earn them. If you want to change anything about the world, save the Coulsons in it yourself, you’ve got to try a lot harder than that. At least I was there during the fight.”
He makes his way to SI, peering at the well-appointed building before turning and entering the cafe. Pepper Potts, he sees right away, a tall red-head beta sitting refined at a table with only water to keep her company. Approaching the table, she spots him and her brow furrows before her face smoothes out and she smiles at him.
Steve comes hard, fluid warm and hot in Tony’s channel as he fucks in and out of the tight heat of it. Watches as it turns frothy when Steve continues sliding through the mess he’s making of Tony’s ass.
He thinks he can help these people. He must. Because as he relaxes into the 21st century, he realizes the world really hasn’t changed too much, besides the obvious. There are still people that need saving. And that he can do.
Steve kneels, leaning down to hook one arm under Tony’s legs and the other under his back, lifting the omega into his arms and holding him close. Tony’s thighs are slick and his midsection is flaky with spend.
What comes out of the hole is like that first initial fear Tony had when he saw the fossil. And it gets worse from there. The metal plating on it should preclude it from flying, but it operates as if swimming through the air is as easy as water.
“—Right here.” Loki links arms with Tony as Thor does the same, and walks all three of them back towards the tinny voice that’s calling all pilots.
“Well, we can’t always be correct, but we’re mostly certain that this particular manner of death is suicide. The way it’s written, how it was in the home, and they don’t note what caused the asphyxiation, it was probably hanging. That was common, not mentioning the cause to preserve the family’s integrity. This—this is what we work to prevent now. Things are better, but they’re not all better.” Brenna died, alone, in her house. She would have rather not lived than go one more minute with her alpha. Steve wants to be sick. Brenna gave him a little flower once. Something she had been handing out to the omega girls. He remembers taking it carefully in his hands so no one could see and taking it home.
“Fine, I’ll clean up, but since you’re sick, you should stay in bed.” Steve crosses his arms and leans into Tony’s space, using his alpha stance to make Tony back down. Tony doesn’t respond at all in the way he expects.
“Steve. I need you. You don’t understand. I need you and I don’t want to need you this bad.” Tony’s breath is hitching as he speaks with artificial calm. The words are warbling slightly, and Steve’s heart breaks at the thought that Tony doesn’t know how much Steve would give for him. How critical Tony is, and has become to Steve. Steve adores Tony with a gnawing emptiness that craves nourishment, craves anything at all that Tony deigns to give him.
But Tony is far from apathetic or angry. He’s so pleased he wants to text Steve right then. His smile turns into an outright grin as he leans back in the chair, imagining what Steve will do when he gets ahold of Tony next time.
It’s just his luck that the guy gets up again, and when the lighting hits, he’s sure he’s a goner. The beam heats the armor to maximum, the burn inside the suit immediately causing him to sweat and overheat. It’s like drinking out of a fire hose. But when it stops, JARVIS kindly informs him that he’s overpowered by, like, a lot. The repulsor blast that comes out is ridiculously powerful, smashing into the man at top speed and bringing him to his knees.
Finally, finally, they escape, and the whole ambiance, every sharp laugh and cackle, is sour in his mouth thereafter. Being near her rots his life. The bad apple. The bad seed.
“Steve, god, Steve?! It’s–it’s agony. Please! I don’t know what’s–”
It’s so profound a sensation, his brain turns to liquid silver; Tony is moaning underneath him. The gland tastes like electricity, jolting his mouth over and over. Steve grabs at Tony’s hips and presses his cock to the back of Tony’s ass. His omega is crying out, needy, as Steve laps and suctions at the gland, persistent as a bulldog. Instinctively, he hooks his left leg around Tony’s, pulling it back and pressing his thigh and groin deeper onto Tony.
He’s haunting his home now, and he can feel Steve’s eyes on him as Tony fades into the background of his own life.
“Inside me, please. Now, now, now.” Tony is a broken record, and the omega tilts back to try and catch Steve’s cockhead on his rim, succeeding just a little before Steve reaches down and helps him the rest of the way.
He wants all this to stop.
“I’m sorry, I fucked up. I never meant to imply that you weren’t—ok—whole, without those things.” Nat looks soft in this light, and he can see it now, the gentle curve of her jawline, the baby softness of her forearms that’s been sharpened by effort. She hides so well, in plain sight. She’s an Alpha, a beta, and Omega, and none of these things at all.
So, onward with the plan. He’ll hide some of Steve’s DNA inside his body somewhere before they dissolve the mucosal plug around his cervix, have JARVIS analyze the scent left over on him to recreate it so he’d have a baseline when he starts his search, break into SHIELD’s little heat house service, and identify Steve later.
“Thank you, love. My caretakers will consider you the devil himself, but in my book, you’ll always be a saint.” Nat gives the woman a genuine smile before turning to Steve.
Good thing that instinct isn’t all Steve is.
“Nat, can you show Cap to his room? He’s coming up the elevator now.” She gives him that sideways glance of hers and he feels like he’s transparent under it, the things he doesn’t want her to know swimming around, exposed. “Please Nat? Pretty please with new knives on top and more widow’s bites in the middle?”
“Yeah, but well you see here, in 1938 she was institutionalized for a few months, again in 1941, and again in 1947. This institution in particular dealt with deemed problematic omegas. Rape was common there, by the guards. The treatments were what we now define as inhumane: full restraints, denial of nests, heat prevention tactics, non-consensual gland rubbing. A lot of omegas didn’t make it out alive. She must have been so strong to go in three times and come out each time. Those places were death traps, designed to do away with unwanted omegas. She probably had children.” Steve doesn’t even know what these things are. He’s never heard of denying an omega their nest. Restraints, yes, he’d thought, maybe at one point he would have restrained Tony if it hadn’t been made illegal. Now he can’t imagine Tony tied down by a leash and collar, much less a full set of manacles.
