“We’re usually having a good time,” past Tony elbows past Steve in the arm, “aren’t we?”
“Tired,” he groans, tossing his arm over his face. His head is beginning to pound and the afternoon sun isn’t working miracles for him. Even when he has his back turned to the windows, the sun somehow seeps into his bones, beating down mercilessly on his back. “Thinking. You know, the usual. When did it get so fucking sunny in here? The temperature in here is hot enough for an Easy-Bake Oven to actually bake something.”
He has enough time to realize that what the nerd is holding is
“At least we know one more thing about them. Whatever they’re doing, it’s still in the testing stages. That’s why they’re choosing people they think no one will notice.” Steve says. “But now we’ve noticed and they know it. This is the opposite of what Fury wants – he even warned us about this. We might make them slip through our fingers.”
Tony shrugs his shoulders, trying to ease his growing doubt as he stares up at the ceiling, “So you just want us to crash this party and find some files?”
“I have an entire laundry list, Rogers. Do you want me to read off every single reason why somebody like you should not trust me? Do you want to start with today’s incident or should I take it from the top?”
Steve rolls his eyes. “I already know what sarcasm is. Anyway, you’re not supposed to be bored on a dangerous mission from Fury.”
a relief that you think I’m so honest.” Tony casually says as he raises his arms up above his head in a stretch, his back arching at a small angle, before settling back down and folding his arms across his chest. He realizes Steve is staring at him and he prompts, “You go first.”
“I’m alright. Tell me about what happened, then. You didn’t go picking a fight with them for no reason.” Steve says and Tony resists the urge to call him by his rightful superhero name, aka Captain Obvious.
“Friday, any exits around here? Preferably not through the front door?” Tony asks his watch.
Steve was the one who dragged Tony out of the confines of the hotel room and downstairs into the dining area, where free breakfast is being served from seven to nine in the morning.
i'm gonna be honest, i had the draft done for a while already, i was just slacking with proofreading. proofreading takes a lot out of me
Deciding not to continue with the direction their conversation took, Tony begins to walk in the direction of a small table with chairs in the corner of the empty dining area, making sure that no one is anywhere within earshot of them before settling down on one of the chairs closest to the wall, placing his coffee cup down on the table. Steve takes the chair across from him, staring as Tony makes himself more comfortable, “Are you done?”
Tony thinks for a moment but honestly, he’s already thought of this while he had been working on upgrades to his sunglasses. His incident with the homeless boy earlier this morning inspired him to think about something they haven’t considered yet. He shakes his head. “No, change of plans. Ready to resort to a life of crime?”
“You and what army?” Tony retorts only to flinch in surprise as his voice comes out not slow and deep as he intended it to be but high-pitched, as if he’s been gulping down helium all night.
“Do you get the odd feeling that we’re bad at this?”
“Yeah?”
Tony immediately starts voicing his protests and Steve does, too, both of them for different reasons. Together, their voices form into a mix of “we can’t do that!”, “innocent people are getting hurt”, and “if I wanted to take a vacation while this group of people is off doing evil experiments, I’d be in Florida right now swimming with alligators.” Natasha puts her hand up and both of them fall silent at the gesture but Tony remains seething.
Steve groans. “Are you
At first, Tony considers doing another scan for good measure, but then decides,
“I’m trying! How about you do something for once? I’m always the one doing the dirty work.” The smaller male hisses back before reaching out and roughly grabbing the kid’s arm. “You don’t have a choice, buddy. You’re coming with us. Consider it a promotion.”
The information they have is minimal and, in all honesty, absolutely pathetic. As Tony sits on the edge of the bed with Steve by his side, they both seem pretty disappointed, the only clue they have is that their assigned bad guys work in a tightly knit group.
“No, we were out of there before they could see us. Worst case scenario, one of them saw my ass,” Tony responds nonchalantly as he sits on the edge of the bed and screws a tiny screw into his watch. He had been tinkering with it ever since they rushed into the hotel room, constantly looking over their backs to make sure they weren’t being followed. Steve even took a few different routes to the hotel to shake off potential threats, their ridiculously old rental car barely driving along. Tony had already made a few mental notes to fix it one day or another.
Tony blinks in surprise, replaying the words back in his head.
Tony barks out a laugh. “If you ask me, it is fully appropriate in this situation to use the bad words I taught you.”
They both fall silent but the air around them remains slightly tense, hanging over them like a dark cloud. Tony has nothing more to say for now, so he decides to try to busy himself with more adjustments to his already overly advanced watch, only to have his phone ring once again. They both stare at it for a few seconds, and Tony notices that this time the caller ID is different. He supposes that it’s a security measure, as Natasha had once told him that Fury sometimes contacted her with different phone numbers to erase the chances of one phone number being traced back to one location.
The wall is a heartbreaker. By the time Tony skids to a halt and aims to run out the way he came, the nerd blocks his path, panting, sweat glistening on his forehead. Tony backs away, his chest aching, his eyes searching for anything that could help him. On his left there’s a dumpster a few feet away from him and on his right there’s a discarded sign leaning against the wall. In other words, he’s fucked.
Steve drops it, thankfully. They’re both silent as Steve bandages any cuts Tony got and judging by the bands of white that wrap around Tony’s torso, there’s a few of them. None of them seem too bad, though, since he was able to sleep without bleeding out. Something tells him that Steve is just being a worrywart, but he lets it slide.
“We can’t afford maybes,” this voice is deeper, and hell if it didn’t sound like a voice that belonged to a big boss or administrator, “we need to do a sweep of this room immediately. Take note of anything out of place, whether any paper, any chair, anything. Now!”
“Do you mind?” he snaps at the confused person behind him, who is most likely the culprit of the shove. “Do you even
“I guess there’s a lot you don’t know about me, then,” he casually says as he takes the plate from the waitress and warmly thanks her as she leaves. Tony isn’t sure why but some part of him takes Steve’s response as a challenge, though before he can force stupid and borderline impulsive words out of his mouth, the subject changes.
Above them, seagulls caw annoyingly, sometimes dropping down to the boardwalk like missiles whenever a crumb of food is in sight. The waves crashing against the sand make a loud sound compared to the voices of other people around them, but the more time passes the more the waves become background noise, only audible if one remembers to pay attention to them. Despite the fact that the rain has stopped, the sky remains overcast, the sun hidden behind steel blue clouds.
Suddenly he no longer has the desire to look at what’s on the flash drive. He already knows. That’s not the worst part. The worst part continues to haunt him, following him like a shadow.
She turns and leaves, dragging the nerd with her. Even before she left, Tony can tell that Steve is dying to go after them.
As soon as he hears the name, Tony feels his heart drop all the way to his stomach in realization. He nudges Steve, who seems to have gotten the message, too. They both exchange glances before Tony’s charisma takes over. “No, we’re just looking around, sweetheart. Tourists, y’know? Got any places you wanna recommend to us?”
“Oh, come on, Tony. You’re one of the smartest men I know, this is going to be a piece of cake for you.”
He busies himself with his watch again but this time the voices get louder.
“Alien tech? Or did your nerdy colleagues make this? How is it powered? This is way out of my field of knowledge.” Tony breathlessly asks, taking note of any feature of the weapon. “Something tells me that you don’t know how to use it yet. Or maybe you’re just shaking because of the cold spring breeze? Does your boss know that you’ve stolen it?”
it…” Steve begins to say but stops when Tony throws him an unimpressed glance. “Okay, maybe we didn’t do as much as we thought we would, but tomorrow will be better.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Natasha:
“We did manage to get a flashdrive.” Steve, who’s been sitting beside Tony on one of the hotel beds, adds as he lifts it up to the camera for Natasha to see. “We’re not sure if we should run it or not, just in case it has the same effect.”
i actually really like this chapter to be honest. i had fun with the balcony scene.
A brief pause. Steve folds his arms across his chest and thinks it through, before his eyes light up. “You’re right. Fury never mentioned them.”
“Anthony Edward Stark.” Steve echoes, as if getting a taste for the name.
He considers draping the blanket over Steve since the blanket is halfway on the floor and the other half is loosely on his body. His mind stays on that thought for a few seconds, as if it were reluctant to leave.
"Hank Pym always said, you never can trust a Stark."
Tony was, in fact, very angry. Two more deep breaths. He put the phone down. He could worry about that later.
“Anthony,”
Bucky’s placid face, calm, curious, unchanging as there was a hollow
When Bucky rejected his money, Tony froze. He was just…confused, at first. He handed the fifty back to Bucky, and they played hot potato with it for a few seconds before Tony got frustrated.
He walked up to the cafeteria, pleased with the amount of food choices. Sizable donations (under the name of Howard Stark but funded entirely by Anthony Stark and without the knowledge of his father) had transformed a meager amount of food options to a near damn restaurant. It took him all of five minutes to get food for his friends. Clint would want cereal, maybe a parfait but probably just fruit, wings for Natasha because, well,
“Mr. Stark, this kind of technology has not been tested or in any way been attempted in lieu of morals and lack of human testing capabilities-”
meant, and because he was only vaguely there, he missed his face flushing pink when Natasha whispered “Hey, stupid, don’t tell him now, surprise him later,” even though she knew it wouldn’t actually happen. Tony sat back down with a huff and let his mind wander.
His face settled to disinterest and calm in seconds.
And Tony pinched the pad of his pointer finger with his thumbnail to stop from cringing. He could feel his posture change automatically, feeling the hod rod poking his back like it was still there. His face went on autopilot, falling expressionless.
and Tony was
Tony Stark was fully justified when he stormed into the cafeteria. At least he told himself he was, and he kept doing so until he started to believe it. He saw Steve
“JARVIS
“I spend this money because I care. I know that You, Bucky, Thor are on the football team, eat twice as much as we do. Yet, you and Bucky don’t eat breakfast most days, and today may have been an exception but you digest too fast to be able to make it through the day.”
“Uh… fuckfuckfuck where’s-”
“Captain, I don’t want to see your face for a week at least. Eat your fucking burrito, and don’t call me to apologize at midnight this time.” How unfortunate.
mine and I’m trying to wire the money I spent to your account but it won’t go- there! It should have transferred. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to-”
Tony refused to admit just how much that affected him- “The world is not a glamorous place.” And, well, Tony could admit to setting his things down for a second. “When I was six, I was kidnapped. The people who took me had other boys, my age and looked similar as well. Every day, we were sent out with a name, a photo, and a place. We had to get to the place, and talk the person in the photo into coming back to the house.” Tony grimaced, and resumed work on Bucky’s arm. “When we weren’t
Bucky’s chest was on his- Bucky’s hand was on Steve’s chest, pushing him gently. Saying something about his week. Bruce and Natasha made a Harry Potter reference, Bucky is now scolding everyone.
He passed the comb once more through his hair. Then, looking in the mirror, made a face. Mussed his hair after the dime amount of gel started to set.
“That’s not funny to even suggest, Anthony.”
Robotics, frustratingly enough, had frustrated the everloving frustration out of Tony. Which was frustrating, because he almost never got frustrated with robotics no matter how frustrating and tedious it was. He took a deep breath. Electromagnetic bonding into neurological systems was proving to be far more difficult than they thought it would be, especially because the rest of the class was programming and he was working sans goggles under his lab table. He raised his hand for the first time all year with a confused expression on his face. The teacher looked equally astonished.
“I know you’re not alright, Tin Man.” Tony nearly snarled at her but she leaned in and all she had to say was “I’m sure it was justified, but settle. Calm down.” Oh right, Tony had no right to express justified emotions. “Smile, sweetheart.” On reflex, Tony’s lips quirked into a smile, his eyes dead.

“Your jeans are hanging from the ceiling fan, sir.”
Bucky came up from the impromptu surgery two hours after Tony had finished cleaning his various scars, cuts, and holes in his bones and putting in the new metal shoulder base. Tony jumped at the sound of movement, and metal on screeching metal. He took a deep breath and did his best to calm his racing heartbeat.
“Okay, this should be relatively easy I think.” Tony told Bucky three days later. He hummed as he looked over his current arm. “I took the measurements correctly, did my research, made an off switch for your nervous system while I’m fucking around in there, hm…” Tony muttered to himself, like checking items off a list. He clapped his hands. “Shirt off, Freeze Pop!” Buckky rolled his eyes.
he had right before he made a (stupidly) witty comment. Fuck him. Tony’s lip curled as he turned around. “Clearly, Tony’s got a host of trust issues he has yet to sort through, and has plenty experience manipulating others into seeing his side of things, how else would he be able to see the small implications of it in a simple statement?” the brown leather jacket, the khakis, the damned combat boots.
Rushing to his room should not have been as big a problem as it became. How hard is it to avoid one room of a house with 40 of them, four floors and at least three staircases each? Easy. Very, very easy. Stupidly so. Which is why, when Tony looked up from buckling his watch and found himself (in sweats and a half opened button up) eye to eye with his father (who was in a purple suit) he started. Hard.

“Ah, sir, I believe you may have an issue, sir.” Tony frowned at Jarvis, who was wearing out clothes. How was date night now
Tony watched, amused, as Bucky started handing out bottle caps. He had been glaring at Steve pointedly,  and Tony paid no attention to the voice in his head saying that he should be more wary of it.
Time for a game of tag.
“Okay. Try flexing your fingers. Since clearly, it didn’t disconnect all pain, it might be able to- oh. Oh-oh. Forgot I did that.” Bucky looked down at his buzzing finger curiously.
Tony’s breath shook for a second as he tried to separate himself from his memories.
“That
“Hey guys, hi. Good morning. You look like you got a good night’s rest! Happy for you, I did not!” He said boisterously. “In all seriousness, guys, you're gonna piss off a lot of people. You’re standing in the middle of the hallway, and blocking half the staircase. I’ll hit you myself if you don’t move, just know I still love you” He squeezed a random shoulder, winked and clicked his tongue. “Stay safe. No fights. Use protection when necessary. Alright, bye,” and with a wave like he was greeting someone with a tophat, he left them standing there, mouths open in shock.
on the other side of the line, before it went dead.
More deep breathing. More not working on the deep breathing’s part.

he made small talk with his favorite Italian cook for a few minutes before requesting “Pollo Alfredo con più formaggio possibile, per favore” as sweet as he could for Bucky, a burrito for Steve, a salad with fruits and nuts for (the actual rabbit) Bruce (because he loved remembering what flavors were when he stopped being sick), and he saw the pans loaded with hot cinnamon buns and immediately picked up five for Thor and Loki.

Time to run.
But before he would think up a master plan, Bruce had an unfortunate, unfair turn. Nobody had head Cap swear, that wasn't fair. Then Clint cleared his throat and looked at him pointedly and- oh.

Tony wouldn't say he was being generous to distract his father, even if that's exactly what he was doing. Honestly, it didn't matter because he and his boys were getting puppies, and ultimately, the only person who would get hurt would be himself, so... what problem would there really be?
Jarvis said, then quietly added,
“Um, it’s more throbbing pressure than actual pain at the moment, and not the nice kind of throbbing pleasure.” Tony made a strangled noise, not sure if Bucky had realized he had switched the words.

“An hour? I have time.” Tony twisted the solder metal in his hands. “Hey DumE, does this look off to you because something-”
“No, Bucky. I have the arm. Take a deep breath in and hold it for a second. I think you’re going to feel the dislocation, but I need you not to tense your shoulder so it’s easier to remove. Because the prosthetic is metal, it's going to be a pain in the ass. The meds I gave you should be kicking in right about now.” Tony went on talking to Bucky, keeping lazy eye contact as he let his fingers run over the metal joint. Something felt off, and he couldn’t place what. He locked his fingers into the sensor triggers, ready to take the arm off.
Adonis sat on Tony’s lap, and Jarvis didn’t say anything, but he smiled to himself, when Tony started talking to the puppy to get it to calm down from his shaking.
Jarvis pulled up in a sleek, quiet and subtle black car and Tony rolled his eyes.
“Hey it's not my fault you don’t take me seriously. Okay. How’s it feel?”
“You know,” He said, turning to the kid next to him with a sharp glance. “I might just kill the man. I might, I’ll do it, you know I will” He pointed at the kid (Jared? Jerry? Justin? Ja-) who looked terrified. “I know you know, I definitely-”
“I need to take a leak. I’ll be back.” He said swiftly, paying no mind to Clint, who had begun his ceaseless, pointless babble.
and Tony was
“I was a lure.” Bucky said, slowly closing his eyes. Tony supervised as Bucky fiddled with the base and the arm. He laid back down slowly.

came the steady voice. Tony set down the soldering device he had been holding and rolled his eyes.
“A lure?”
I need a nap, I can’t move, holy shit.” Tony smiled sadly, detached and threw Bucky a blanket.

“Stark.”

“Ja- oh. Bless. How’d you know I’d want it?”

” He hesitated, if just for a moment. “When we weren’t luring, they kept us next to and sometimes inside this giant refrigeration unit in their basement. It was so cold, I watched a few of the boys go to sleep, and never wake up again.” Glancing up, Tony could see the far off look in his eyes, as if he had forgotten where he was. “They killed, every single one of the people we brought to them. The screams echoed in the walls, in our ears, for months. Disobedience was never a question.” At Bucky’s pause, Tony looked up through his eyelashes at him, letting him continue. “Well. At first it was. I was their worst child, they told me so all the time. I refused to do anything. I would wake up in panic trying to find Stevie and eventually, eventually the amount of times they sht me up in that freezer did a number on my brain.

“Tony Stark?”

“Jarvis! How can I help you?” Tony beamed at the sight of Jarvis and Ana standing hand in hand. Jarvis snapped and whistled a bit, and Adonis went running.
“Howard,” He nodded professionally, and walked away in the wrong direction, without coffee. Didn’t listen to his father yelling. Didn’t turn, didn’t care.
“I mean, you could’ve worn a shirt without sleeves like I

punch in his gut. For a second, he saw Ty’s face swimming in his eyes, before Steve stopped talking, Natasha stood up, and Tony saw red.
Imagine his surprise. Tony allowed a vague flicker of satisfaction and confused emotion to cross his face. Calmly, he said “That's right Spangles, keep your lips for doing more useful things than berating me and making me look like a fool in front of entire groups of people,” Steve leaned back. He looked momentarily confused and concerned.
“Wish you had sunglasses like me?” Tony teases as he watches Steve adjust his baseball cap so it shields his eyes more. They are leaning up against the counter where the coffee machines are located, and Tony is waiting for his coffee to finish brewing. The air smells of pancakes, syrup, coffee, tea, and various other breakfast foods, creating an overall sweet aroma that helps Tony feel more at ease.
Tony sees Steve mouth “you wish” and he playfully flips him off in response.
“The only solid address we have is all the way across the city,” he mentions, remembering the address by heart despite only reading it a select few times, “and I don’t know about you but I’m not feeling city traffic today. It’s a weekend in April and you bet your ass that everyone is going to bustling in here. We’re going to be stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic for hours.”
“What makes you think I don’t?” Steve cautiously asks.
Tony huffs and trails after Steve; even though Steve sounds confident, Tony can hear small hints of doubt in his voice. Tony knows that Steve is just as restless as he is to save lives and kick butt. He knows that he wants to know what is on the drive more than any of them, perhaps even more than Tony himself. However, it’s his strong sense of duty that stops him. The desire to do something right no matter what it takes. In a way, the two of them are two different sides of the same coin.
Tony lunges forward in an attempt to grab it from Steve only to almost fall straight off the bed as Steve moves out of the way. He pulls himself up and grabs Steve’s shoulder, though he topples over in the process and hooks his arm around the back of his neck to bring Steve down with him. Tony doesn’t even realize how strange they might appear until he looks up and their faces are only mere inches away from each other.
“Sunny side ups? I always thought you were an omelets type of guy.” Tony admits, surprised that he turned out to be wrong. For someone who believes that he’s right 99.9% of the time, this is more than a huge blow to his pride.
“Cap? Rogers? Steve?” Tony finds himself calling out, surprised that he even has the voice to do it after being so close to an explosion. His ears ring loudly despite the fact that they were thankfully able to avoid the blast and be at a safe enough distance away. If he weren’t so terrified for Steve, he would definitely be having flashbacks to Afghanistan. When he doesn’t hear a response, he immediately stands up, his facial features contorting to an expression that can only be described as one of pure terror. “
Finally, by the third petulant whine, Steve huffs and drops his pencil. “Can you make it any more obvious that you’re bored?”
The good thing is that she doesn’t know their names nor recognizes them as their true identities. Contrary to her belief, that puts Tony and Steve on the upper hand. Now all Tony has to worry about is somehow getting out of here when he’s clearly out-numbered.
Steve doesn’t say anything, instead stuffing his hand into his pocket to fish out a crumpled up map. Tony watches as Steve spreads the map over the surface of the table and carefully traces his fingers over the surface of the map, as if he’s afraid to accidentally poke a hole in it or crease it despite it being just a visitor’s map and nothing of value.
Steve gets up after him and promptly cuts him off. “Wait, Tony.”
“Oh! Um, no. We’re not.” Steve awkwardly explains, and through vision blurred from tears Tony sees him rubbing the back of his neck, his ears a bright crimson. “We’re just traveling together. Do you have any recommended places we visit?”
By the time he chokes out an awkward “no problem” Steve happens to be already asleep.
Steve squints at his phone screen, “Sorry, where are you, Stark? I just see myself here. Wait…are you that tiny little speck there?”
Suddenly anger starts bubbling in his stomach, traveling up to his chest, his body heating up. His Reactor seems to glow brighter, but he doubts it’s anything other than a trick of the light. They have
The woman speaks this time, her voice low, as if she is trying to deliberately keep quiet. Another alarm goes off in his head. “We need to get the kid out of here fast before people start waking up. Boss needs this one fast. He says we’ve got spies on our tails.”
Despite his curiosity, Tony simply makes an unimpressed noise, rolling his eyes as he turns his attention back to the window. “Whatever you say, Leonardo Da Vinci.”
Once Tony stopped complaining and begrudgingly agreed to accompany Steve (though he swore it was just so he can get some coffee), they both changed into something more casual, since they are still undercover after all, and they decided to look like tourists fresh out of the city. That meant a pretentious black T-shirt, dark blue jeans, and his signature sunglasses for Tony, while Steve wore a more “dad-at-his-son’s-junior-league-baseball-game” look with a baseball cap, a light blue T-shirt, and light faded jeans. Basically, in Tony’s opinion, they looked like themselves but heavily downgraded. The Arc Reactor thankfully shone very faintly underneath his black shirt, barely noticeable, and if anyone asked he can always say it’s part of the shirt’s design.
“Good luck, Stark. Send my best to Rogers, too. Check in after you find something, and we’ll decide on the next move. And remember, nobody knows who you are. Keep it that way otherwise I’ll kick your ass so hard you’ll find yourself right back in that workshop-”
“Welcome to paradise.” Steve notes as he parks the car a safe distance away from the building and turns off the ignition and makes his way out of it, Tony scrambling out after him.
With the decision finally set in stone, his body seems to move on its own accord. He quietly gets up from his bed, making a beeline towards Steve’s bed. His legs feel like they’re weighed down with heavy boots of lead. The paper left in his jacket, which is discarded his bed, sneers at him. He stops as soon as he’s standing in front of Steve’s sleeping face and the sight of him brings daggers to Tony’s heart.
“Yeah, it won’t. I have a history of being hard to kill.”
“Now you’ve done it,” the other one groans, swatting the back of the nerd’s head. Her eyes return to Tony and he knows by the look on her face that she has inconspicuously pulled out a gun. He wishes he had his armor surrounding him but Steve would kill him before the gun has the chance. “You’re officially coming with us thanks to Mr. Running-His-Mouth here. We have no idea where your partner is but I’m sure our boss will appreciate your help finding him.”
He had been working on upgrades for his suit when he turned around and found Fury sitting on one of his work benches, drinking a cup of coffee as if he’s been there for hours. Annoyed with his surprise appearances, Tony asked him in a not-so-nice way what he was doing here, only to have his words drown in his throat as he realized that Steve Grant Rogers was awkwardly standing a few feet away. The blonde offered him an awkward smile and waved, while Tony simply stood there, trying to think of all of the possible world-ending scenarios that can possibly be going on. Just when he thought that things were finally calming down!
Tony needs to take a walk. They’re still temporarily fired and he just needs the air, especially after his nightmare last night – not to mention that it will take his mind off of this morning. He snaps the watch on his wrist and makes his way to the door only to stop in his tracks as soon as his hand is resting on the handle, craning his neck to look back at Steve without having to turn his body away from the door.
“If you stay up again, that’ll be two nights with no sleep, and no unholy amount of caffeine will help you.” Steve points out, and Tony is only vaguely surprised that he stuck around to argue.
“Now that we have the other information, we can finally look at what’s on the drive!” Steve says in a triumphant voice as he falls in step with Tony.
“You’re impossible.”
“We should get some sleep.” Steve murmurs before he gives Tony one last look and turns on his side, breaking eye contact with him. Tony waits for a few minutes, staring at the form of Steve, his body slightly illuminated by the moon’s reflected light streaming through the cracks of the blinds, before doing the same, met with the sight of the faraway closed door to their room.
“You have something on your mouth.”
“Don’t shoot the messenger, alright? We’re all on the same team,” she tries to assure them yet to no avail, “and waiting this out
This goes on for a while, the reporter asking specific questions and receiving vague answers in response, until it finally ends around the three-minute mark.
Suddenly, he hears a commotion on the other side of the room. Quickly folding up the paper with the descriptions of their injuries and tucking it into his pocket, therefore leaving the other papers in the file, he speed-walks around the shelves of information until Steve is in his sight. Whatever happened seems to be already over since Steve is standing over an officer lying on the ground.
He’s not entirely helpless without his suit of armor but when he’s outnumbered in a fist-fight, well, he’s no Steve Rogers.
“-Next time he calls, we’re sending Nick Fury straight to voicemail, I don’t care what anyone says.” Tony says in as commanding of a voice as he can muster as he wags his finger. “We’re putting this mission in our own hands now, where it belongs.”
“Bad at this?” Tony scoffs, pressing a button on his watch and speaking in a suddenly feminine voice, “This is our first time and I think we did great. In fact, I think we can replace Nat and Birdie on every mission from now on. Fury is popping champagne bottles and hugging every agent he sees as we speak. Houston, we’ve done it!”
“Why, yes, I can. Thank you for asking. I’m also digging the sass you have going on there. If there’s anything that you learn from me through this entire mission, it better be sarcasm.”
Deep down, Tony knows that Steve is right but that doesn’t stop him from wanting to continue the argument for whatever reason currently unknown to him. He thoughtfully chews on the inside of his cheek, staring at the doors behind Steve. His attention is forcefully torn away as a waitress walks up to their secluded table, a small but kind smile on her face. She has strawberry blonde hair, hazel eyes, and appears to have a generally sunny disposition that matches the bright lighting of the dining room. On one of her hands is a perfectly balanced plate and Tony cranes his neck in an attempt to see what it is, trying to remember if he ordered breakfast or not. Before he can ask, the waitress smiles at Steve and hands him the plate, “Your order, Mr. Boreman.”
“Get down!” Steve suddenly hisses and a rough hand on Tony’s shoulder shoves him to the ground before he can protest or ask what’s going on. As they crouch on the ground, Tony notices that the two of them are unusually close to each other, close enough to feel each other softly breathing, but he no longer cares as soon as he hears distant voices near the elevator.
Tony looks up and sees Steve arching an eyebrow in disbelief. “You’re really bent on something spontaneous like that happening? Do they even know that we’re men?”
Tony muses as he confidently pulls the flashdrive out of the laptop. As soon as he does so, the computer screen flashes once and a bright red countdown appears, starting from 00:05:00, which translates to zero hours, five minutes, and zero seconds.
hey, long time no see! this chapter is a little slow but things pick up in the next one! also, tony is very much pining but he's too oblivious to notice it himself.
“Really? I thought that was one of the perks of being a supersoldier.” Steve teases back and before Tony knows it, he’s dumped on top of the sheets of his bed in an ungraceful heap. As Tony indignantly sits up, preparing to launch himself off the bed and do whatever it takes to get back to his earlier position, Steve manages to catch his attention once again. “What were you working on over there?”
“The man we’re looking for mentioned the basement level as being off-limits and this is the last floor. Not to mention that I took the key from him with the old bump-and-apologize trick,” Tony points out as he casually makes his way out, motioning for Steve to follow him, and then he looks at the watch situated on his left hand, “Friday, any security cameras around here?”
Tony fakes a horrified gasp and dramatically places a hand on his Reactor. “Mr. Rogers? Are you assuming that I haven’t done it hundreds of times before and still living to tell the tale?” He’s satisfied to have gotten another laugh out of Steve, even if it does sound weary, and leans his head back against the headboard. “We successfully wasted one day of our week punishment. T-minus six days.”
“Nat said we should lay low until the next event, where they’re more than likely to be. I trust her, she’s done this hundreds of times before.”
“That was easy.” Steve comments, looking over his shoulder at the closed door behind them. “Way too easy, don’t you think?”
about what Tony is making him, even if it is purely for the mission.
Tony shakes his head, “No, if this were a cult, Fury wouldn’t have called us in. That’s
As the man struggled to get his sentence out earlier, Tony had finished preparing his cup of coffee in the meantime and now holds it to his lips, more than grateful for the first sip. Unfortunately, as soon as the stranger finally speaks again, he ends up immediately regretting it.
“Don’t go after them,” he warns, and Steve turns back to look at Tony before he begrudgingly makes his way over to him. He looks at Steve through his cracked sunglasses. “You took your time getting here. What, did you stop for drive-thru?”
There’s an incredibly long sigh of relief.
The sound of the window breaking, accompanied by shattering glass scattering across the floor, echoes through the room and the voices get louder, and much closer. White flashes bounce off the walls and thudding footsteps accompany them, like thunder following lightning.
“Where is your common sense?” Steve shoots back. “My pants are in the hotel room where we were supposed to be staying
“We’ll talk to Fury about it later tonight or tomorrow.” Tony decides as he stands up, reaching for his shirt and putting it on again. “I have some video and audio footage of me getting my ass handed to me. I’m thinking Fury can run some background checks on our new friends and –”
Tony can see Steve make a disgusted expression in the reflection, “I’d rather not think about that. I still think he should leave the spy business to Nat. But since both she and Clint are out of commission, I guess he had no other choice. He said this is important, I know he wouldn’t have bothered if it wasn’t.”
“Like what?”
“It’s not for me,” Tony pointed out, “and I appreciate it. Thanks, Cap.”
for some reason. Probably because of who he’s currently talking to.
Steve doesn’t need a reminder of all the shit he’d let happen to come back here, back to Tony. The decision had haunted him ever since before he left with the stones. It was selfish as hell by anyone’s standards. He still hadn’t told anyone his real reason for coming back, but in his defense, no one had outwardly asked him until now. Leave it to Tony Stark.
Steve could barely see through the frosted glass that Tony was sitting on an exam table with Jim on one side and Shuri on the other. They were talking about Tony’s injuries. Gotta love that enhanced hearing. Tony had been stabbed among other things, but Shuri already had him on the road to recovery. He couldn’t really understand the sciencey medical jargon they used, but Tony was sitting up with his legs dangling from the table, he wasn’t laying down and he wasn’t unconscious so that had to be a good sign.
Steve was terrified, but he would not leave. He had to do this, he had to give the man a real apology. Even if Tony hated him for the rest of his life, he still owed him that.
He walked around the huge desk and plopped down in the chair with a loud thud. “Friday, play my Long Day mix,” he requested. The A.I. complied without a word and a slow, melodic Jazz tune filtered into the stodgy room. Steve leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes, allowing the soft sounds to wash over him. He needed a break, or better yet, a release. Tony had been bouncing around the Pacific all week with Nat for some diplomatic, baby-kissing bullshit and he was missing him terribly.
“Anything else, Mr. President?” Wanda asked, tapping notes on her tablet.
“You’ll have to find another VP,” Tony snickered before playfully sucking the head of Steve’s dick into his mouth and quickly releasing it.
The man looked like Christmas morning. His grey suit was flawlessly tailored, as usual, hugging his hips just so and Steve could picture what his ass looked like in those pants. Honestly, he could draw Tony’s glorious bubble butt from memory. Unlike Steve, Tony was at home in a suit. He floated gracefully in clothing that should have been restrictive or at the very least, a little uncomfortable. He discarded his jacket, vest, and an oxblood tie on the couch next to Steve’s clothes and undid the top two buttons of his shirt, revealing the glorious dip of his collarbone. Steve’s mouth went absolutely arid and he tried to school his face to no avail, mesmerized by the way Tony was purposely accenting each step with a subtle swing of his hips. Walking painfully slowly, and staring directly into Steve’s eyes, Tony finally made his way to the desk where he sat audaciously.
Against his better judgment, Steve slid between Tony’s legs and embraced him, pulling the billionaire’s head to his chest tightly, stroking his hair.
Steve wanted to reach out and grab his man by the collar, pull him into his lap and kiss him senseless, but he was having a difficult enough time forming a complete sentence. “I uh—I thought you guys were uh—coming back Friday,” the President stammered, taking in the sight of his gorgeous boyfriend perched amongst top secret briefings and executive orders.
“Don’t come a step closer, Rogers. Not a single fucking step!” Tony shouted.
why some of my teammates don’t believe you are who you say you are.”
Steve hiccupped in shock before pulling his chair back to its original position. He bit down on his lip as Tony resumed his vacuum-like suction.
“I’ve passed every test, even gave you guys information that panned out exactly as I said it would.”
Being in a romantic relationship with one’s Vice President was a double-edged sword. On one hand, Tony was a great VP. He knew how to work everyone from foreign dignitaries to the press. He was just so goddamn likable, he could charm any world leader into a peace treaty or nuclear weapons agreement. He was Steve’s right hand, and a natural fit to take his place in the highly unlikely event of his death. On the other hand, the role of a Vice President was a very public one. Tony was traveling even more than he used to for S.I. and the separation was making Steve downright cantankerous. They rarely traveled together, as was the policy, and missions together were a definite no-go. It was difficult enough to convince Congress that they should continue their super-heroics, on an emergency basis of course.
“—pen?” Pepper asked and Steve had to bite down on the inside of his cheek to keep from whimpering.
“I bet I gave you hell when I got back to Earth,” Tony correctly assumes, completely ignoring the part about him dying to save the universe. He’s lying on his back now. Understandable since they’ve been talking for hours at this point.
Steve shrugged off the navy-blue jacket and undid his tie before tossing both on the couch, relieved to finally be rid of them. Soon, he fantasized, he would strip down to his skivvies and enjoy the chocolate chip cookies he’d special ordered from that bakery he loved. God, he hated wearing suits. It reminded him of his days as a USO performing monkey during the war. But alas, the President of the United States was expected, required, to wear a suit. Every. Fucking. Day. He craved the good old days of his red, white, and blue Captain America uniform. Any one of them (yes, even the one from the Battle of New York) was more comfortable than these designer straitjackets. And the shoes. Lord, the shoes. His personal stylist must have some type of political ax to grind. He was sure of it.
Tony inquires, moving closer. “Past tense?”
“I guess that’s the end for us then?” Steve asked, implicitly.
“As you can see, Mr. President, I can do both. Very well I might add.”
Jim turned towards the lab doors and they opened automatically. He walked a few steps ahead, likely to talk to Tony first, before dropping Steve on him like a ton of bricks. They turned the corner and there he was, Tony Stark. He looked so small sitting there. Tired, weak, and hurting, but still smiling. He was covered in scratches and bruises and his torso was bandaged all around. He was so distracted by whatever conversation he was having with Shuri, he didn’t see the Steve standing less than 20 feet away.
“Mr. President?” his Chief of Staff’s voice called from the hall.
“We were,” Tony hummed, absentmindedly fiddling with some papers on the desk, “but your dear Secretary of State thought it best I forego the final leg of our trip in favor of my…
It’s been one month—30 days, 16 hours, 3 minutes, and 47 seconds to be exact—since he arrived in this timeline. One month since he’d confronted his teammates and himself (again) and told them who he was and (most of) why he was here.
“Lucky for you, Spangles, I got nowhere to be today.”
“No argument there, Spangles.”
“You did,” Steve smiles. “Called me a liar, told me I wasn’t there when you needed me—”
“No, that’ll be all, Wanda. Thanks,” Steve replied, tugging his tie loose, “have a good night.”
A hush falls over the gym before Tony asks, “You love him, don’t you?”
Steve complied without a word, undoing his button and zipper in record time. When he managed to free his achingly hard cock, Tony’s beautiful brown eyes lit up like he’d been given a precious gift. Tiny, silky beads of pre-cum slid down from head to the shaft as he squeezed himself at the base.
time, specifically? You could have gone back to any time. You could’ve gone back to Peggy, saved Bucky on the train, coulda stopped Hydra getting its claws into SHIELD—why now? Why here?”
Steve had convinced himself that Tony didn’t need an apology, that he had too much going on in his life to caring about a few hollow words from an old man. But seeing, first hand, the way it is now affecting Tony, he’s ashamed and angry with himself. At least now he can literally kick his own ass if the spirit moves him.
“Mmmm, look at you. So ready. Let me see it,” Tony begged as he continued to stroke himself.
Steve could hear his heart beating in his ears as Jim walked over to Tony to grab his attention. Everything was suddenly in moving in slow motion. Tony’s head turned to him and that bright smile morphed into a look of disbelief, and then rage.
“I’d say so.”
Tony was silent at that. He’d expected more of that patented Captain America stubbornness.
“Yeah, I guess you’re right,” he admits. “I do still love—” he didn’t know if he wanted to say
Steve instantly turned beet-red and opened his mouth to say something, anything in his defense (what that was, he really had no clue) but Tony released his cock abruptly, causing a shudder, and hollered from under the desk, “G’night Pepper!”
Tony went back to teasing him, taking in more of his cock at a time. Steve longed to feel the back of his throat, to hear to the sounds Tony made while gagging on him, to coat his esophagus with cum. Just as he allowed his head to fall back in ecstasy, there was a knock at the door.
Now, he finds himself restricted to one of the residential floors of the tower,
“Hey yourself,” Steve said in a breathy voice, barely able to contain his surprise.
Tony backed away slightly and Steve could make out the rigid outline of his cock pressing against his pants. He tipped his head back and palmed himself, letting out a husky moan as he writhed in Steve’s lap.
“Not even a little bit, Shellhead.”
The words cut him like a knife so he can only imagine how they’d hurt Tony. He’d felt like shit about it for weeks after the battle, but he never did give Tony an actual apology. They’d shook hands and left it at that.
“Shit,” he hissed through clenched teeth.
Steve felt his cock twitch at Tony’s mere implication but he swallowed hard and took a deep breath to steady himself. “How incredibly thoughtful,” he sighed.
“Yeah, we’re gonna give you two a minute,” Jim said slowly as he walked backward behind Shuri who was already halfway out the door.
“No yelling, I promise. If he starts yelling, I’ll just leave,” he pleaded.
“I can—
“Sorry to bother you so late, Mr. President,” Pepper apologized while thumbing through some papers on her way to his desk. “I have that briefing from Director Fury and Reports from Secretary Wilson and Secretary Strange,” she said, gathering the appropriate paperwork.
Steve pressed his lips together and groaned deep in his throat as his boyfriend continued to plant gentle kisses all over his face and neck. Tony started to roll his hips, grinding against Steve’s ever-hardening cock, and there was a moment he was sure he saw stars. Tony’s kissed became deeper, more passionate as he moved down to his neck, undoing his buttons and pulling at his collar as he went.
“I’m so sorry,” he whispered over and over as they both cried there in the lab.
He's not properly melted into it before Tony backs away with a curse. “Why’d you stop?”
Fury had told him and his super-hearing had picked up Fury's request for Tony to
to be a hero.’ Sound familiar?”
“I know,” Steve croaked.
have a Tony. Well, I—didn’t exactly have him, I—” Steve doesn’t even know how to talk about this. He’d worked out what he would say to them, to Tony, once he returned to this time, but it seems impossible to get out now.
Steve walked, as casually as he could muster, by Shuri’s lab for the 5th or 6th time. He was a nervous wreck. Almost three hours ago, Bruce told him that Tony had arrived with some blue alien girl in tow. In that instant, he felt both unbridled glee and encumbering dread. Tony was alive, and that was a great relief, but Tony was here, which meant a talk was inevitable.
It's so soft and tentative, like a whisper of a kiss.  Just like the first time, so long ago. A feeling of relief washes over him and Steve exhales into Tony's mouth.
“I—I can’t tell you how happy I am that you’re ok, Tony,” Steve said as he stepped toward the exam table.
“For me? Don’t you have your own Tony? Don’t be greedy, Rogers. One Tony per timeline,” Tony teases, smirking. Steve wants to kiss that smirk off his face.
Steve’s hands finally left the armrests and found their way to Tony. One hand carded through thick, spiky hair, and the other gently cupped his face. Tony replied with a devious smirk and licked his lips.
which will be awesome by the way, get the metal I need to help Bucky because his arm is all fucky recently, and return the money Ms. Rodgers paid me, all in one action that’l most likely result in nothing more than a shove down the stairs or something.”
Tony took a shot.
“If you talk about murder, you get caught with the murder. Shut up and watch this film,”

to wait a few hours so your body could at least become not entirely hostile to it, but I'm bored and you heal stupid fast.” Bucky nodded in understanding. Tony carefully explained what he was doing as he was doing it, let Bucky run his fingers down scabs, precision cuts, old unhealed scars. “I need a favor from you, while I’m working on getting this thing-” Tony waved the metal arm “attached to you.” Bucky blinked a few times as if he could just realize he could see and smiled wide. Tony watched his fingers twitch somewhat nervously before he realized Bucky had started talking.
“Okay, Buckaroo. Imma needya ta take a deep breath. Does your arm hurt?” Bucky grunted, and sat up with his eyes closed.
“Nope!” Tony said, popping the
off of his leg. “Ah. Here, Donie.”Tony squatted down, beckoning the little mutt with a curl of his fingers. The little Mutt, dubbed Adonis, happily ran over and began nosing at Tony’s hand. “You’re not letting me out of here without you, are you? Are you? No, I wouldn’t leave anyway, of course I wouldn’t, look how precious you are!”
He rolled his shoulders back and cracked his neck to the right.
“Why the grocery?”
“I will not lie to you, I expected you to stumble through the doors.” Tony frowned. “I mean no harm, Ant- Tony, I mean no harm.” Tony bristled, and cracked his knuckles.
“Nonononononono, that’s what I’m trying to-to say, that was me, that was me, it was an accident, you gave me your debit card and it looks just like mine so I thought it
If Tony gulped, he wouldn’t have admitted to it, and anyone seeing it would’ve believed it to be a mirage. Too late to check, his eyes were ice and his jaw was set.
“Tony, Tony you’re rambling. You’re fine.
Or, that one where Tony accidentally-on-purpose uses his father's bank account to withdraw thousands of dollars instead of his own (with good cause) and then of course, rest of the story from his perspective.
“Ah, Sir, I don’t think you have a reason.”
“...I don’t suppose I can talk you out of this.”
“He-ey, Ton-y, what’s happening,”
Getting into the Rodger’s house was easy, leaving everything everywhere was easy, setting up the wire cage and small bed (and petting Cabbage until he fell asleep) was easy, giving the doorbell lock a slight boost was easy.
The total came out surprisingly high, but he paid with a smile and balanced three trays walking back towards his friends. He was
“I'll call you Tony when you stop calling me sir, Stark.”
and pissing me off? I need to scream at him!” Tony was sure to be loud enough that Steve would not only hear, but wince as he heard him. And wince he did, wince he did. Tony’s lip curled. He hardly heard Natasha’s reply.
Captain.
“Sup, Jarvis?” Jarvis just smiled, and ruffled his hair.
A dry but amused voice added, “Genius, soon-to-be billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.” from all the way down the hall came-
to Adnois, who promptly laid down on Tony’s feet.
No, he couldn’t, who was he trying to kid.
“I’d say his examples are perfectly clear.” Tony whipped his head around, trying to find his savior. Upon finding him, Tony’s face fell. Golden Boy was smirking that
that is walking around in a body
but he tacked on Loki and Sam at the last second. “
“Eyes on the road before you run somebody over. Didn’t anybody ever teach you that?” he promptly ignores the question and responds sharply, and almost immediately regrets it. Mentally cursing himself in multiple different languages, Tony bites his tongue to keep from saying anything else, staring out the window, watching the waves of grass roll by. However, after a few uncomfortable seconds of silence, Tony murmurs in a voice just loud enough for Steve to be able to hear, “I’m sorry.”
“Tony? You might wanna look at this.” Steve’s voice interrupts Tony’s process and he looks up to see the faint figure of Steve near the back of the room, looking down at a table. Curious, Tony makes his way over to him and follows his gaze, briefly reading the words stamped on the file before both relief and excitement wash over him like a tidal wave.
Tony buries his face in his hands, groaning loudly even though it’s muffled. “They put that address in the files as a trap, Nat. They knew that whoever had the files and didn’t recognize the address as a trap was someone who was not meant to have the files in the first place. They’ve tried to get rid of the threat without getting their hands dirty.”
Steve rolls his eyes, “This mission isn’t a joke, Stark. Pick up the phone otherwise I will.”
“Hey Tony,” Bucky asked. His name snapped him straight from feeling his float-y, unfeeling state of mind. “Wanna go first?”
of us on a good day, everyone wants something different and I don’t have a bill smaller than a fifty. Take it, pay, or I’ll do it myself.” Bucky helplessly looked to Steve, so Tony huffed and took the money from him, ready to take care of it himself.
“Jarvis, oh my god, J, look at him!” Jarvis smiled warmly as Tony held up a small, squirmy mutt with a patchwork of colors in his fur. “Look at him!” He shoved the puppy into Jarvis’s face. “Remind me why I can’t own a dog, right this second.” Jarvis, confused, said nothing.
“I have to get something from Father’s lab. And before you freak, yes, it’s not much of a possibility, yes, I have a plan, yes, I will likely get hurt.” Stunned and speechless, Jarvis rolled into the parking lot of the small grocery.
“No.”
“Sir?”
Shortly after Tony dislocated the metal arm, he found that Bucky just...wasn’t in a lot of pain. He had been sort of surprised, sure, but the dull shock had echoed in him and the pain immediately dissipated. Or so he had been told. He had already removed bolts in his shoulder joint, metal from around infected muscle and skin, and an incredibly horrifying patchwork of connections, welding, and monotone colored wires. Horrifying, terrible, frightening, awful. Horrible work, horrible results.
“Weather?” There were a few soft clicks after the tiles in the ceiling let a few rays of light change the sterile lighting of the lab. Tony tapped the screen in front of him with four fingers. “Hey, Jarvis?” The intercom buzzed softly. A cool comfort. “What time is it?”
Trying to wire the money from his account to his fathers, as it turns out, was not. Tony sat on his bed, ignoring Adonis nosing at his elbows and trying to get pets from him, frustrated that he couldn’t get the money to his father’s account. Eventually, he gave up, and called his father (who, unbeknownst to Tony, was arriving at the Rodger’s building) on his cell.
“So here we are.” Tony repeated quietly. He lightly gestured with his foot and Adonis lept onto the chair, onto the table and curled up under Bucky’s right arm. “I have one more thing to connect. It’s going to hurt like hell for about three seconds, but I already have my finger on the trigger switch. It should cut feeling pain and movement from your arm, it
After a while he feels the man next to him move. Tony turns around so he can face him.
Steve walks to the counter and take a deep plate to serve the soup he found in the fridge. He goes back to Tony and hands him the plate.
Steve comes back and snap me back to reality. I look at him. I have stop crying so I can see him clearly. He's not much older than me but I can say he has graduated. He's tall and I can see his muscles under his shirt. He is blond and he has the most gorgeous blue eyes.
"What? "
"You're lucky. Maybe it doesn't seem like it but you're really lucky you've got friends that care for you. Most of the people I hung out with are rich spoiled brats I guess I'm one too but we're not really friends. "
"Well If you want to use the bathroom be my guest. Sorry but there's nothing you can do to kill your time I have no Wi-Fi. I was planning on doing some Math but of you want I can keep you company. "Tony says. "Huh sure. So how do you spend your free time? " "That's an easy one. I don't have any. In the mornings I work at a workshop after at the cafe and when I'm home I study. " " Oh man that's a lot!"he sips from his glass and then adds quietly "You don't have to talk to me you know. You can study" "Okay".
It's a quiet and boring evening, Steve has just finished showering after an intense workout with Natasha but now he's alone. The redhead left just after training for a mission and took Clint with her as well. Thor is at Asgard doing whatever it is he's doing and Bruce had decided to stay away for a bit trying to manage his anger. So Steve now is alone. Well there's Tony but who knows what the man is up to? He's probably down at his lab for three days still functioning only because of the extraordinary amount of coffee he consumed.
For a moment he thought Howard would just leave and he'd lost any chances on going back to Tony but then the older man gestured for him to follow.
"Eighteen" I answer. "You? "
They didn't realize that they reached the cafe till now. Tony turns to Steve and locks eyes with him. "See ya around Cap" After that he gets in before he hears Steve's answer
T: I know a good coffeehouse I'll text you the address.
"Come on punk tell meee. I'm your best friend! "
(See the end of the chapter for
"I... ugh... I...ehh...he..." Tony started only to be interrupted by Natasha. "Come on Clint you really didn't recognized him? "
Tony pulls himself on Steve's lap moaning softly. They part and the blond leaves soft kisses all over Tony's face and neck before find his lips again .The keep kissing as the ride comes to an end.
-Later that day-
So when he received the call of his mother asking him to go back because his father got ill and he was close to the end Steve didn't care to hurry up. He never got to see his father again. He didn't feel sad or empty or something like that. He felt like nothing changed. He was 16.
"Mm good morning Captain" He mumbles in his pillow and he's sexy rapsy morning voice causes Steve's morning wood stir.
As we walk out we meet a boy. I look more carefully and I realize that it's Tony!
"Shit Nat! Of course you know why don't you just spare me for once?"
He really should've wait to make a better plan and then quit. What is he supposed to do now? He's going to end up homeless again. His paycheck from the cafe is bearly enough for the basics. His main income was coming from Obadiah.
It's been a week since the incident and Tony's spent it considering his options and if he really should move in with Steve. At this point he's sure he's in love with the older man but he can't help thinking the what if's. What if they break up? He'll end up homeless again. What if Steve isn't showing his true colors? Maybe he's an ass, they don't know each other for that long.
(See the end of the chapter for
He kicks again and again until the bell rings. I sigh in relief.
"Oh my god! I knew Maria was right when she said I should work less" The man mumbled under his breath and started walking away still lost.
"Start talking" He demanded and the soldier complied.
"Omg! Tasha! Clint! What are you guys doing here? "
So this is just a filler next chapter will never better.
"You said I could. " Steve replies." I came to tell you that last night... I..."
" Is it not a good time? I can come back later... " The blond asks awkwardly.
He's waken half an hour later by a loud knocking on the door. With a groan he untangles himself and goes to answer. As soon as he opens the door he's face to face with a familiar redhead good looking woman and a man with dirty blonde hair right behind her.
"Awesome" Says the brunet and leans back in his seat.
He walked in casually looking around but before he could go any further than the entrance he was stopped by a well built man. Well not as well built as him but still he was a super soldier after all.
Thank you for leaving kudos
Tony stares surprised " Would you trust me for this? I mean I haven't even graduated from high school. "
"Welcome to my house!" Howard said as he unlocked the front door of the huge mansion. "I think my wife and son are  somewhere around. They'll be happy to meet you."
"Sure" The redhead answers but before Tony can sigh in relief she speaks again "But why? "
The tension cuts hesitantly the brunet man " Hmm I would like a hot green tea if its not much trouble. " He says politely. "Of course whatever you want sir" " Bring me a scotch and quickly "comes from the blond who now has gotten over his surprise and leans back in the chair looking Tony in interest.
"I'm glad you have him and Natasha as well. "
"And?" Bucky asks the inevitable.
And to this Steve can't help his own groan. What Tony said went straight to his own dick and  they're both desperate. An even louder shout of his name is the only warning he gets before Tony comes down his throat. Steve without second thought swallows all of it before backing away.
The boy with a nod goes to the counter and starts making the drinks. He has learned how to make everything in the menu by now. He's working there more than a year. His only friends are the kids that he works with: Natasha the scariest girl he's ever seen (and he has lived in the streets) and Clint who is the most annoying person to ever walk the earth.
"Hi! You must be Tony, right? Steve, Steve Rogers. A pleasure to meet you!" He couldn't believe how formal he sounded!
After their first date they come closer. Steve takes Tony to some fancy places and buys him small gifts but they have the best time when they do fun things Tony recommended like going for stargazing in the highest place of the city.
"Back off!" Clint says laughing but there's a protective note in his voice.
" I don't know things were tensed when we parted. I hope to... " the teen sighs. "Oh I have a costumer. " And like that Tony goes to take the woman's order and the topic changes.
"Good because I made you breakfast in bed and I have a small present for you later! Besides everyone knows birthday sex it's the best" The blond winks.
It's been weeks and me and Tony text each other every day. He's told me things. My heart aches for him. He's been through a lot. At school everyone hates him and they bully him in daily basis. His dad is an asshole. He doesn't care about his son's life as long as he doesn't do something embarrassing.
"I quit" He says simply surprising himself. He didn't expect to actually say the words.
That day he finally got fed up and packed his stuff. He waited till night and ran away.
" Well you would helped me if you leave but you're not going to so no" He answers.
Hey! I'm sure I owe you a huge apology. It's been over two months since the last update guys I'm  so so so so sorry. Also an extra apology for this chapter. I wrote half of it half an hour after I woke up during an online class and the second half at night after long day.
"California but obviously I've never been there. Favorite celebration? "
With that Tony storms out of the cafe running to his place. He puts on his best clothes, a yellow t-shirt and jeans, and waits for Steve to come.
"Give them back"
"That's what I told him and he said he would stop or if he kept doing it he would let me know. But today I found out he didn't stop nor told me so... " He stops and takes a deep breath. "So I quit".
They get out of the restaurant together. It's cold outside and it's started raining. Steve notices that Tony wears nothing but the red t-shirt. "Aren't you freezing? " The boy just shrugs and keeps walking " I've had worse" "You'll get sick that's why people wear coats and jackets when it's cold"the blond insists.
He doesn't say anything so I take a deep breath and continue. " I just want to say thank you for being there for me and help stand on my own feet. You make wanna live and this means a lot to me. Steve Rogers... You saved me. " I stop talking and he looks really surprised.
"Sorry sir, but I can't allow you to go further without an identification. " The man said.
I text him the address and get ready to leave. Thank god my father's not here.
"Tony! Language!" Steve said blushing.
While living in the streets Tony realized how important is to be able to take a warm bath and have an even cold meal a day. Fast though he found a quiet safe corner that no one knew about and make it his.
"Clint! It's not like that I barely know him and I'm sure as hell he did it of pity. I mean he saw where I live and... "

"I don't know. I also have nothing to wear... I mean what if he wants to go to one of those fancy places? The most appropriate outfit I have is a t-shirt without holes... "
-Sunday-
These weeks I can't stop thinking. I don't want to die anymore. From the moment he came into my life I just want to be with him and make him happy.
He gets out and finds Steve. " I'm ready let's go "he says and the other man takes his eyes off of the screen of his phone. "Excellent do you have any preferences or I choose the place? " "I don't know Steve I only eat McDonald's or tomato soup in can we can go wherever you like. " " Okay how Italian sounds?"
"Are you alright? "
"People wear coats huh? You think everyone can afford that? There're people who don't even have a roof over their heads did you know that? " As Tony talks Steve can't help the feeling of shame how could he be so stupid he's seen the boy's apartment!
Tony is not surprised at all by his rudeness. It's obviously not the first time someone's being rude to him -life in the streets can be tough- but he can't accept it. He's annoyed when people who consider themselves better because they're just luckier don't give a fuck for the others so he doesn't let it pass.
"Please can't you call him or ask him or something? " Tony begs.
In the beginning it wasn't that bad. He had a roof over his head and a hot meal. He tried to make some friends too but nothing much he soon realized that children there weren't very friendly.
The first hit came unexpectedly and he let out a whimper. The beating continued for a while and by the end his back was red and sore and bleeding. He was left there alone again trying to put himself together. That's how he came out of the numbness...
He walks out of the bathroom and calls in both of his jobs to let them know he's not going. He spends the day in his bed trying to keep in whatever still remains in his stomach.
"I wish we didn't... Anyway I'll give you two some privacy. " The man - Obie- says knowingly and goes to the office at the back of the store.
"I can assure you that my presence here is not a problem sir. " He answered the best he could.
On the way back Tony notices some fireworks in a short distance " Hey Steve what's there? "
"Em... Sorry how can I help you? "
He was a sincere man that always kept his word, so the first thing he did was find Peggy and finally dance with her just like he said he would. Truth is if he hadn't fallen in the ice he probably would've end up marrying her. But he did fell and now everything was different. He woke up years later and met the love of his life in a different century.
"Probably"
Tony heard Steve's soft voice whisper just before he let sleep take him. Now he's laying awake in the blond's bed watching the older man snoring softly and can't help thinking about those words.
And they're happy.
"Couldn't be better"
Congratulations your application to MIT has been accepted...
Tony wakes up in the same position the next morning to see that the man's gone and has only left a note on the table.
Silence drops after Tony's words. It stretches the time and neither can say if it lasts a minute or an hour.
"Tony stop it! The only one who pities you is yourself. I'm pretty sure he admires you. If not he's just an asshole. Sweety you're so strong. " Natasha smiles affectionately.
Tony lately has discovered that Obadiah deals with outlaws and they had plenty fights about it. The boy was outraged when he found out. He deserves to know if it's something dangerous. He works in the shop after all he could be in big trouble.
No beta.
"What are you talking about? How could you even know of my existence? How are you even alive? This is all very confusing and I'm a genius" the teen argued.
"Hey hey hey! What are you talking about? You're not going back there not as long as I am here. Please baby just come live with me! You won't even need your job in the cafe. You'll finally focus on your lessons. Please I can give everything you need! "
"Wow! This is all too much to take in! You don't have to answer this but... Did we fuck?" Tony asked with a smug smirk in his face.
And yes Steve would be able to recognize this voice everywhere. He turned around quickly and he was faced with his soulmate. After all this time of picturing him dead he found it extremely difficult not to jump on the teen and hold on to him for dear life.
He glances at the caller ID. Bucky... Of course he'll call the most inconvenient moment. He answers anyway.
"You came." Tony says.
"Omg Tony! Are you okay?" Steve blurts out before he can say anything.
"Oh Tones!? What are you doing here baby? " Now the blond finally looks away from his papers.
"Yes, hello Natasha. How can I help you?" He repeats.
"You're Bucky? Steve talks a lot about you"
About twenty minutes later there's a knock on his door. He takes a deep breath and opens it.
"No really I'm grateful. "
Last chapter was posted just few minutes ago .
"Ehh sure... We can go to my room"
"Oh sorry, i thought you were elsewhere." The younger boy blushed.
"Omg and you didn't say anything!"
" It's okay. " Howard answers and turns to me " Steve this my son Tony. Tony, Steve and I just made a good deal and he's coming this Sunday for dinner. " " Nice to meet you" Tony mumbles. "Nice to meet you too. " I say and I walk out thanking Howard again.
After a while he figured he should go back and as he walked out the room the moment he had been waiting for so long  finally came. Out of the door stood Tony. Alone.
After a while he realized that once again he was in an era he didn't know a thing about. Sure Tony always talked about the 80s and how many wonderful things he had lost while being a capsicle but he never got to see them by himself. He laughed softly at the thought of Tony. Really since the battle his mind had been in a never ending loop of TonyTonyTonyTony.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I'll show you" Tony says quickly and I know he wants to talk to me too.
"If that's what you want... " Steve looks at him.
As Tony's preparing some customer's coffee the bell on the door rings letting him know that someone has get in the shop. He lifts his eyes and he's looking directly at the gorgeous man that just entered. The man is tall at least 6 ft and Tony takes in the way his dress shirt stretches in his muscular torso. The guy has also the most ocean eyes and soft blond hair. Across the table sits an other man who looks kinda awkward. Tony's gaze drifts again to the first man and he thinks that he has seen this face before.
We sit there in an awkward silence. I am not afraid of him I just don't want him to ask me about what I was ready to do. But I know he will and I wait...
"So you admit you do have a crush! "
*POV* Steve
"He's almost 18 jerk"
Sorry it took me so long but here's the next chapter. Hope you like it. Also it'll probably have 16 chapters but this may change.
"I have a date with Steve"
"Hahaha okay punk got it" Bucky says as he comes into view. "Hey Tony! What's up man? Oh I see you have company! Stevie where's your manners won't you introduce me to the lady? "
"Calm down my boy you're out of your mind right now. " A male voice says.
Now it's my turn to be surprised. "Ughh I love you too so much. " I say as I let myself get lost in the kiss .I didn't even realize when he pressed his super soft lips against mine.
"No! That's not what I meant sweetheart. I don't regret anything! Actually no... I regret not doing it earlier. " The boy blushes a little at the pet name.
"Sure"
" I didn't know where else to go that's why I'm here in this hour. " The younger boy breaks it at the end.
"I went to the cafe and your friend Natasha said you're sick I was worried about you. "
"You know what I want? To sleep" Tony deadpans but as he's sees his boyfriend happy face fall he adds " Okay you big big baby I'm up! "
When Tony's done he comes back in the main room. He's changed clothes and now he's wearing an old shirt and sweatpants. His hair is wet and falls on his forehead. He's not very different from his younger self. He's still cute.
"Promise you won't tell Clint"
"Okay you both stop it! And Tony tell us about him. When? How? I want every single detail!"
