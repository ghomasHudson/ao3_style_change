“ I guess that babysitter you call a PA decided to drop you off at daycare.” Fury quipped. Tony stuck out his tongue. Fury paid him no mind as  Maria passed out the assignment folders as Fury opened his own.
“ You made it clear that I disgust you so stop following me.”
Tony wrapped his arms around himself as he looked around the apartment. He was wearing comfy sweatpants and a plain black cotton shirt.he had been cleaned up and groomed. They had shaved his goatee, but pickers can’t be chosers especially if he hadn’t bathed in over a month.
Bruce Was currently passing around ice packs from a large mixing bowl.
Peter nodded and began to wiggle out of it.
2) Bucky was captured with the rest of the group while Steve, Peggy and Sharon escaped. It sounded like Steve was trying to go back for the rest but Peggy wrote that a cave collapsed. And Tony didn’t really understood what that meant.
“ I didn’t rush you when you had your turn,” Grant snapped. Tony remembered how Steve had basically thrusted into him with minimal prep, holding him against the wall with his legs and arms wrapped around him. He had thrusted into him quickly with a hand in his hair pulling his head back as he attacked his throat. Grant was different though. He rather have Tony leaning over a table as he thrusted into him with said table roughly moving against the wall with each delivered thrust.
Tony’s been with a lot of people. A. Lot. Of. People. But Steve was by far the loudest.
Tony looked up and saw Pepper with The agent at her side. The distraction gave Winghead enough time to buck Tony off and scurry back to the water. Tony sighed as he stood up.
“ So.... how was the sex?” Clint asked with a mischievous smirk adorning his features.
“ Oh come on!”
“ what are you doing?” Tony asked.
“ Fuck! What the hell!” Tony snapped as he pushed both mermen off of him.
Coulson sighed in relief. “ Thank goodness he’s still fine. We are going to be there to pick him up.”
“ Today was a nightmare!” He whined. Steve began to rub soothing circles on his lower back. That always seemed to
Thor just shrugged. “ He wanted to be a war prize one time and the next one of my father’s prisoners. He told me once it helped him with the bad memories he had of being a prisoner and made him feel as if I’ll be there instead and be able to love him. We both consented and it was his idea. It was kind of fun actually. We had started to laugh part way through when he accidentally tripped over the skirt of his own slave outfit.” Thor explained.
“ Can we go to work now and do recon on that shady politician guy or are you going to continue to ogle at Starks ass?”
“ How can you even possibly know?” He growled. How could anyone know? He made a fool of himself in front the love of his life and said love of his life had tried to leave him.
“ Give me a second so I can adjust. Shit... so big Steve.”
The baby cooed and reached out to him. Tony smiled and nuzzled his head. The baby giggle and ran his hands over his beard.
Tony looked at  Grant. “ Grant, what is he talking about?”
Steve released Tony and back up. Tony have him a once over before going to the nearest suit and opening it. He quickly stepped inside.
“ I’m their defense you were aggressive to two of his colleagues, one of them being a close friend of his. Some you can understand his reservation right?”
He walked over and placed the sandwich in front of the bastard on the couch. He smiled at him and Tony swears his butt was wagging as if it still had a tail. “ You eat that and behave. Your boyfriend is coming up.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“ We like you,” Grant continued. “ we just have been feeling frustrated that’s all. You are always so busy and... we might have gone overboard. Don’t worry we will fix it.”
“ Shit... fuck... so good... don’t stop.” Tony screamed. Steve gripped tightly onto Tony’s thighs, no doubt leaving bruises behind as he continued to thrust.
“ I love you, my little one. I shall always love you.”
“ You know what I just realized? Aunt Wanda is still hot as fuck. Especially with that mini shirt she was wearing today. And she still has a nice set of tits. How the fuck did she end up with Uncle Vis-ow! Fine I won’t talk about anyone else and how hot there are. Fuck, you didn’t need to bite.”
Tony sighed and let himself be dressed by his mom. Dear god why was he in this mess.
He knew what was coming next. He didn’t want it. He didn’t want to go out like this.
“ I’m not answering a phone call from my dad when I’m about to get laid. Karen  can you say that I’m busy and will call back later.”
Tony just nodded at him in greeting.
“ I don’t want to play right now. I’m going to sleep.” To make his point Tony quickly finished washing himself and stepped out of the tub.
Clint let out a sarcastic laugh. “ Pietro pulled the fire alarm at school so he wouldn’t have to take a test.”
“ How hard is it to catch him or notice that he is flopping around to the kitchen? He’s a literal fish out of water at that point.”
“ I love you two,” Tony said quietly as he felt them entangled their hands with his own and curl their bodies into him.
“ And by the way, what up with the kid.”
“ And I’m guessing you’re Tony based form this morning, correct?”
“ Yes. Yes you are.”
A hiss interior red the conversation and they both turned to see Bucky at the ledge hissing at Howard, as if he were offended by his statement.
You are someone I want to be with.”
“ Can we come in. I know that you probably don’t want to talk to us right now but we need to decide what we are going to do with the 200 pound problem locked in the cell in the basement.” Natasha said.
Clint rubbed the back of his head where Schmidt had hit him with a case file.
Steve grabbed his hips and began to thrust into tony. Tony gasped as he felt the air punched out of him.
“ yeah, but I know that tone. And I’m just going to say it once again: I’m not that kind of Doctor. I don’t care what it is, I just know it’ll be something out of my field.”
Tony felt someone grab his arm and pull him toward a muscular chest. He began to struggle. “ Get off me you prick,” He snarled.
Steve scoffed. “ I don’t see how that is any of your business.”
“ Because i want to romance you. I want to walk down the street holding hands. I want to cuddle on te couch and watch horrible movies. I want to take you to Paris-“
“ What business does your father want you to learn? L- like what does he do?”  Peter winced at how nervous he sounded, as if he didn’t know how to speak.
“ Just wanted to make sure I didn’t have to call the funeral home yet. After your last stunt I thought you would be more careful,” He quipped.
“ Is that possible? I don’t doubt you Bruce, I just...” The Red Skull asked.
“ You came so hard you blacked out.” He explained. He was wiping Steve’s stomach down with a warm rag. It felt nice.  Iron man stood up and tucked Steve back in.
“ Watch it,” James growled at him as he moved by him in the hallway of their suite.
Steve turned around and that was going to be the end of it. Or so he thought. What he didn’t expect was the hand on his shoulder. Steve grabbed it as he quickly turned around. Tony cried out as Steve’s stomach fell when he heard a sickening snap.
“ The Taskforce, our form of the Avengers had formed.”
“ You know he hates you right?”
Tony inhaled sharply as a pain coursed through him. Shit that wasn’t good. He looked up and saw Steve standing defensively in front of the other brunette. Tony felt Coulson grab him and Clint on his other side helping them retreat.
They stood stock still and just stared at him.
Tony pushes down his hand and smiled. “ All the time.”
“ Come on you stubborn ass, “ Tony hissed as the large were wolf ran around aimlessly through the car and the workshop. The creature would run into the open door of the car turn around and rush out just to run around the workshop.
The man he was to bond with stood nervously by his mom, fidgeting with his fingers. His mom nodded at him and gently guided him to the bed so he could sit. Tony went to the other side and laid down. The blonde man looked at him and positioned himself similarly.
Tony has been dropped off at a bathroom with a few servants. Steve told them to clean him up and return him when he was finished.
“ Tony... if I scared you or offended you somehow.... I’m really sorry. Please let me know what I did wrong.  I’m really worried and I promise not to do it again. Just let me know that you are okay.” It sounded as if his voice cracked a little at the end. There was a lot of emotion behind his words. Tony sighed and let his head hit the wall that was behind him. He was going to die an early death. He had no sense of self preservation what so ever. No wonder he was always down in medical. Hell, he because of that freaking lack of self preservation he ended up in an alternate reality.
So, by the end of the week the Avengers each had their own floor of the tower, complete with a common area for
And so he did, the man removing his fingers as he slid the condom on with practiced haste, and was quickly sliding into Tony.  Slow, at first, then faster as Tony withered under the man, hot, panting breaths escaping him.  It was hot and needy, Tony muttering pleads as he was pounded into, the headboard shaking as the springs in the cheap mattress creaked.  With a shaky hand he grasped his cock, jacking himself off into a quick, shooting climax, Steve’s name on the edge of his lips as he screamed his release into the stranger’s shoulder.
Again, Tony locked himself up in his lab for another three days.  But this time, however, it wasn’t Bruce or Clint or Steve who came to retrieve him.
This happened more than Tony was willing to admit.  It wasn’t every day, but sometimes Tony just had Bad Days, and on Bad Days, sometimes, the voices inside his head were just too much.
“Yes.  She was…she was going to be my girl, Tony, and I wanted that time with her, I wanted to be with her like that…right after she kissed me for the first time I jumped right into the Valkyrie, and I never got–I never got to be with her.  I never got to be her partner.  And it just seems that you keep shoving that in my face.”
Tony pursed his lips, eyes darting over towards the discarded gun.  “You sound like you speak from experience.”
“It’s good for him.”
Was it out of wedlock?  Peggy was a powerful woman, one who defied the standards of her time, but some things might’ve still be inescapable.  Was she ashamed, in her day and age, to have a child without a husband?  That felt...unlike her to Steve, but it’s not like he’d ever discussed the thought of children with her.  They weren’t even dating, not really.  He wanted her to be his girl, sure, but they never went that far, never talked about stuff like that.
When he tries, and fails, to focus only on finding a cure, he thinks about Tony.  Far too often.
“Yeah, sure, whatever, does it matter?  I’m alive, so it doesn’t matter, right?”
that it was going to be a close call because it always was, wasn’t it?
He could’ve called Thor in to help, but he could still hear the mechanical cries of the machine monster in the distance, and knew that this was something he had to do alone.
Yeah.
Sue him.
“I don’t think I will,” Steve huffed, and walked out.
Before they could do so, however, the thing had swung at one of the bridges, just as a train was approaching the now giant hole in the tracks.
Steve gulped, nodded, and grasped the purple handle, staring at his hand.   What he saw, however, nearly made him drop it.
Steve didn’t have any classes till 2, but Steve know that Bucky had Lit 101 at 10:15 and he also knew that if he missed the class one more time, Bucky would fail the semester, despite it only being October.
“It’s
“Wait?”
“Tony, I-”
Natasha nods, her own drink untouched before her.  “I’ll be there when it opens, to make another statement--”
Well, maybe that’s when it started.  But not even JARVIS counted that.
So when Tony found himself plastered against a wall with Steve’s soft, sweet lips against his own, his big strong hands resting on his hips, Tony most definitely
“Oh, Tony…”
Steve considers it, he really does.  He wants to ask someone, too, if it’s the right thing to do.  If it’s even worth it.
He’d barely made it a block, however, when an approaching roar of a bike caught his attention.  He turned, squinting into the headlights as the motorcycle stopped beside him.  A broad man stepped off, approaching him.
Tony burned the rest of the papers.
It was shocking, really, that Tony got a reply as fast as he did.
Finally.  Finally.
He could’ve said what would it matter, if he’d lost his life in battle?  What would it have mattered, really?
Right?
When he reached the level however, JARVIS piped up again.  “If I may, Sir, may I make a recommendation?”
“It’s okay Pepper, I’m here, I’m…”
He curled himself up onto the cool, marble floors and after hours, minutes, days, he let sleep take him.
But Steve didn’t have time to think, no, he didn't have that luxury because he was confused out of his goddess-damned mind, but he needed to get to Bucky, needed to needed to needed to--
to know.
Rhodey eyed the contents in his hands, sighing as he moved to let Steve in.  “Tones, you got a visitor.”
-----
But now, now he wasn’t alone.
“C’mon, you’re going to bed.”  Steve lifted himself up off the couch to hover over Tony, his gaze stoic.
But the man--
Those days, however, were becoming few and far between, and Tony was getting better, Steve would say.  They were fixing it, Steve would say, running a hand through his hair as they laid sprawled across Tony’s bed.  It was all going to be okay, Steve would say.
No.  Nope.  Fucking
So Tony ran to him, ripping the guitar from his hands, stealing the smooth, silky lyrics right from the mans lips with his own and he was kissing him, he was kissing Steve, they were kissing, pure and simple.
“And if he doesn’t answer?”
And that...hurt Steve more than he thought it would.
Mentally shaking the thought from his head, Steve nods.  “Travel safely.”
And it was normal.  It was so close to normal that Tony wanted to scream, because would he really ever get “normal” ever again?
And that was that.
, so wrecked and it wasn’t fair, it wasn’t because Steve deserved life more than he did, really honestly and truly because Steve was someone who fought for the good of America and Tony, Tony nearly destroyed America, didn’t he?  He’d almost destroyed America and New York and the Avengers and Pepper, oh god Pepper and Rhodey and Steve,
“Nine percent, Sir, I-”
He flirted his way through the red carpet; a smooch here, redirecting a nasty comment there, a high pitched laugh here.  It was like baking; a spoonful of that, a pinch of this.  And before he knew it, he was through the door and into the ballroom.  Simple as that.
This time, Steve genuinely looked confused and, Jesus, shouldn’t Tony be the confused one?
Yup.  Steve was fucked.
Captain America,” Steve replied, eyes narrowing.
“But I mean...did he track the phone?  T’Challa told me he couldn’t, but…”
It was one week since the odd encounter with Tony Stark, when Steve was cleaning up his side of his shared dorm.  As he was digging through a pile of laundry, however, he came across a pair of pants that definitely wasn’t his.
Steve nods, sipping his coffee without meeting Natasha’s eyes.  He didn’t even have to ask, this time.  She just knew he would ask, because every time they’ve met up for the past four months, the only thing on Steve’s mind is Tony.
“Pepper can handle it, she’d done it before and she’ll do it again, I’ll buy her a new dress, I’ll buy her fifty dresses.  It’s not a big deal, Cappy, I don’t know why you’re so worked up about it.  This isn’t the worst thing I’ve done,
“That sword will do you good, but it’s not like you can go up against Loki without a proper shield.  Unfortunately for you, my rat bastard father managed to--”
She gives him a pointed look.  “I’m not asking you too.”
His head was pounding, his frail body shaking, his knuckles white from the grip he had on his reigns.  His horse was pounding hard, through the village and into the woods.  He rode harder, faster, never losing sight on his target.  He couldn’t even think about what he’d do when (not if, never if) he caught up to the man.  He just knew he had to do something, he had to
Steve pulled harshly on his reins, forcing his mare to a halt as he turned towards the source of the noise.  His jaw gaped in horror at the sight, muscles seizing as he stared in disbelief.
But really, he was the reason Tony was really, really fucked up.  Obviously.  Or that’s what he told himself.
was ever going to happen.
, for years and years now.  Less so after the whole, uh, thing.  But yeah, flirting.  Tony Stark was legendary for it.  Leg.  End.  Ary.
“Tony, if you’re not going to talk to me about….this, then can you call my therapist?  Please?”
At the tone of Steve’s voice, the room went stiff, the air thick and coiled with tension.  Bruce went to grab Steve’s shoulder as he inched closer to Tony, but the Captain merely shrugged him off.  “When are you going to learn, Tony when are you going to stop doing this shit?”
At the time of Pre Afghanistan, he probably would’ve told himself that those days were better than his MIT days.  Obviously better than his Pre MIT days.  Obviously.
He knows he’s trying to protect people.  Because that’s what Tony does, that’s what Ultron really was meant to be.  A protector to protect against something like New York from ever happening again.
Steve turns to her, a frown growing across his face.  “He went after Bucky too, you know, you weren’t there, he--”
“It’s a thing…” he muttered, reaching for the other man’s outstretched hand, being tugged off the ground with ease.  He wobbled, and Steve steadied him, hands grasping at his shoulders.
The building was a hole in the wall, with stained concrete slabs for walls, worn out flashing neon lights indicating just what the place was.  A bulky, tall man stood in front of the stairwell that lead down to the joint.
in his hand, and if he had the landline, then…
He was expecting this, of course he was.  But so close to the limo and so soon?  The Pierre usually had better control over the vicious animals that were the New York paparazzi, but apparently they were slacking tonight.  How distasteful.
Steve blinked, but only smiled, a small, breathy chuckle escaping his lips.  “I’m kissing you, Tony, what does it look like?”
It’s disgusting, it’s the end of the line, bottom of the barrel, nothing left to give which is so ironic because he was the man who had everything.
But damn was it
And Steve left and god did it hurt, did it ache, but it was for the better it really was because he was no good for Steve, no good for anyone, no good for Pepper, no good for himself.
He knows that if he had just signed the damned thing, things would be different, but that doesn’t mean anything would be better.
clouding their faces and no.  Just, no.  That was not going to fly, at all.
He shook his head, a sad little smile playing at his lips.  “Do you really think I give a shit about your money, Tony?  Really?  Tony, if you’re gone, I’m going to be miserable.  Because I’m your
Inside, the house wasn’t fairing much better than the outside of the establishment.  The place reeked of beer and heavy smoke, along with, well, the stench of sex.  It was thick in the air, buried in between the cracks and crevices of the worn couch cushions, lingering along the cards and chips that drunkards at the tables used to play poker and rummy.
What Tony had meant to say to that was something along the line of

Salty, the water was

, me okay?  I have to figure that out my own.  I have to learn how to help myself, how to stop my own panic attacks, how to force myself out of my own head.  And, fuck, I can’t deal with this
Clint barked out a laugh, rolling his eyes as he reached in to grab a package of Pop Tarts.  “Don’t you need to go off and think of some more bird jokes?”
“You rang?”
He stuck out his hand, looking...amused?
It’s not like Tony hasn’t been in love before, because he has.  He was in love with Pepper, loved her, and still loves her.  Not in the same way as he once did, but it’s still love.  He knows what love is.  Obviously.
Fortunately, the universe seemed to hate him less than normal that day, for no one was in the communal kitchen.  Or well, so he thought.
Not to mention he was a total, overcompetitive dick.  They could be twins, really.
“Figures.”
true--
He sighed.  “Sure Steve, you can stay.”
can’t you, like, get a refund?”
The same fantastic smile Tony had been wearing moments before returned upon his face, eyes glinting.  “I think I could try that, yes.”
Tony Stark on the MBTA.  Now that would be a feast for the media.  Between the sunglasses and scarf, he felt he was well enough disguised, despite the crowd of people.
But Tony needs time.  More time than Steve.  Steve came out with what he wanted, Bucky safe with him.
Slumping his still tender shoulders, Tony succumbed and allowed the man into the room.  He didn’t meet Steve’s eyes, however, deciding instead to focus on the schematics he was throwing together for the new Mark.
okay, Tony!  How could you say that, really?  Really?!  Y-you tried to….to-”
Shit.
Merchant of death.  Yeah.
“Would I?”
“Well, it’s not the craziest thing you’ve--” Clint cut himself off, his eyes falling onto an open box at his feet.  “Oh my god.  Oh my
He was the reason Tony was a mess, he was the reason Tony had been in the weapons making business anyway, he was the reason Tony became the Merchant of Death, and he was the reason Tony became Iron Man, really.
He tries to regain himself, turns toward the Natasha, then to the box, then back to Natasha.  “No...no you can stay.  I’m sure it’s not…”
“Yeah well,” Tony answered lamely, shoving by Steve, eager for a scorching hot shower.
“Pep, Pepperoni, I was so...caught up, y’know how it is, I didn’t even know it was Thursday!  I’ve been working on specs for new gear for Natasha, and I’m on the Mark 19 now and it’s been….”
Steve began shrugging into his clothes, and Bucky moved towards the other side of their small, shared bedroom to do the same.  They were worn out and threadbare, but to his dismay, Steve hadn’t grown in the past 3 years or so, which gave him no real reason to waste his resources to make new ones.
With haste, he pushed open the door to the desired room.  He’d barely taken in the area before a tall, broad man with coarse chest hair and a black mess of hair down to his chin.  His eyes were scalding, heated smile bright even in the dim lighting of the room.
It pained her, it really did, but she knew she couldn’t offer her son what he needed.
knows him.”
“C’mon, Stevie.  May needs us to heard those damn sheep.”
“Hey, hey what the fuck?  What do you think you’re doing?!” Tony squirmed, cheeks heating.  It was no use, of course; Steve’s arms were
“So don’t be.”
Downing half a bottle of jack in one night?  Also, probably not smart.  Probably.
Slowly rising to his feet, he let her lead him into the elevator and up to his floor.  Once the doors opened, she placed a small peck on his cheek, and then she was gone.
Oh.  Well.
“Captain.”
Tony heaved a sigh, running a hand through his hair.  “Yes, okay, I’m just going to say it.  I did try to kill myself, okay?  I did.  But that had
“I...that wasn’t right of me...before,” Steve mumbled, looking anywhere but into Tony’s eyes, and that was fine, really, because Tony was slouching in his chair and he probably couldn’t maintain any form of eye contact, anyway.  So instead, his own eyes loomed into Steve’s short, blond locks and wow, if Tony had been happy drunk and not...
Oh, God.  The look on Steve’s face should be
Nope, nada, not happening.
to see you, I’ve noticed how well your firm is doing, and from experience I know that’s, well…”
An arm.  Tony built Bucky an arm.
And to think that he’d only gotten worse.  But nowadays it was easier to hide it from her.  So that was good, really.  Probably.  Sure, whatever, it didn’t matter.
Holy hell.
“Vanessa, so
“Are you going to tell me what happened?  Was there--don’t tell me there was a call and you decided to do that lone wolf shit again because I swear to--”
“Uh,” Steve fumbled, looking more anxious than embarrassed, which was odd, really.  “I don’t know if we’re dating but...her name is Se-Sabrina,” he finished, nodding lamely.
“But somehow, I couldn’t deny it.”
So he didn’t.  And it was after 78 sleepless hours that Steve found him sprawled across the couch at three in the morning, surrounded by coffee mugs and chinese take out containers.
She eyed him, clearly hiding something.  Steve figured he was about to find out what.
It was narrow enough to walk down the street without hitting any buildings (unless it swung its arms, and thus the first thing the Avengers did was attempt to disable them) so it was somewhat of a saving grace.
“Uh, yeah….” Tony didn’t have to look to know that the Captain was hunched over slightly, rubbing the back of his neck.  “I wasn’t really Howard’s friend, Tony, and I had no idea that-”
“Steve?” Tony asked, hopping off the barstool to greet the man.  “Thought you had a hot date.”
Without thinking, without hesitating, Steve kicked into his horse, chasing after the man.  He could hear Uncle Ben screaming after him, telling him not to go, that it was too dangerous, that the legends were true, that the kingdom wasn’t safe anymore.  But none of that mattered, nothing mattered, he had to get his friend, save his friend, save the village--
“It has been a pleasure serving you, Sir.”
Tony didn’t notice the doors of the lab swing open, and he didn’t hear Natasha swear when she saw him, a withering mass strewn across the floor of his workshop, and he barely noticed when she snatched the gun out of his hand, throwing it across the room as she cradled him within her arms.
A loud, shrill beeping, followed by a red blinking ‘1%’ filled his senses.  He could feel it, the suit caving in on him, the bruises forming across his skin, the cracking of ribs.
Before he could regain conscious control of his body, his arm had swung out, knocking the man out cold.
Yeah.  Sure.
Exhaustion crashed over him, suddenly and all at once, and he’d barely managed to make it to his bed when sleep took him, collapsing onto his mattress with a muffled
Steve whipped around, meeting Tony’s smirking expression.  “Would I lie to you?”
He swings open his door, and freezes.  On his bed is a plastic crate, the
“No!  No, I just…”  Steve’s voice sounded off; distant, somehow.  There was a pause, and Tony could almost visualize the other man shaking off whatever had come over him.
At seven on the dot, however, a familiar face strode into the diner that was most certainly not Nick.
She sighed.  “Fractured ribs, a broken wrist, dislocated shoulder, a bit of internal bleeding and a mild concussion.  They said you got lucky.”
“Uh, sure.”
She feels herself fading, but a weight is lifted from her chest, a weight that should never have been there in the first place, and now she can sleep peacefully.
The did some tests, asked him basic questions--his name, his age, where he lived.
(Unbeta'd, all mistakes are mine)
And really, that seemed so strange to Steve.  None of Rhodey, of Pepper (they were broken up, sure, but from what Steve saw they were still the best of friends), but more so, there were none of his parents.
In which Tony nodded, scratching his goatee as he turned up the volume on the latest episode of Game of Thrones.  Tony, of course, was smirking to himself because at that moment in time, he believed that he still had Steve convinced that the Stark family on the show were his long gone relatives.  At the same time of course, Steve was smirking to himself because he did, in fact, know the show was completely fiction.
, actually,” Tony corrected, throwing the notebook into the fire pit.
It was three days later, from what JARVIS said, that Tony saw Steve again.  And he’d all but forgotten about their incident in the lab.  Yup, definitely.
Of course, he hadn’t, but Tony could dream, right?
Steve narrowed his eyes, but once he saw that Tony was merely curious and somewhat amused and
“Well, I think that’s settled, then.  Pack your bags, we’ll have you all moved in together ASAP.”
And Steve
It was a seedy place, really, as was the bar it was attached to.  Girls with tight shirt and three nose rings, with half their hair buzzed off.  Guys with too big biceps and dark, flowing tattoos plastered across their sweat stained skin.  It wasn’t a place where you’d expect to find a genius billionaire.
he wasn’t hungover.  A miracle, really.
But this time...this time...

Well, it’s not like

“Tony.  Why didn’t you swim up?  Why didn’t you even put the faceplate down?”

He hits send, and he breathes.
lean into the kiss,
The other man cackled, because apparently his name was hilarious now.  Which it was, really, the man was a joke, and it was about time the man himself realized that.
No, instead he donned his overly expensive shades and swung the limo door open.  Before he could even make some witty remark to the rest of his team, he was blinded and ambushed by photographers and reporters alike.
he was--had Bucky, and fuck all if Steve wasn’t going to give his damn life to save him.
I didn’t agree to this, when did I agree to this?  You’re really going to move them into my tower?”
“He’s
“What did he…?” Bruce called, but Tony was already pounding up the stairs, two at a time.
Steve shakes his head.  “How was Lagos?”
Tony blinked.  And blinked again.  The words hit him like a bucket of bricks; sure, Steve could stay there, he could do whatever the fuck he wanted.  But what Tony couldn’t figure out for the life of him was
God, even in his license photo he was radiating snarky confidence.
Tony’s head snapped up, almost glaring at Steve.  He winced at the ferocity of it.  “Perhaps I shouldn’t have, but I’m not sorry I did.  She was your mom, and now I know, but I didn’t know at the time.  No matter...what we were, she still meant so much to me.  I was briefed on what had happened to her, on her legacy with SHIELD, but I didn’t know anything about her personal life.  I’m happy that she had you.”
After what felt like hours Steve pulled back, staring down at him with sad, sad eyes.  “Let’s go, I can yell at you in the morning, but you can explain yourself when we get back to the tower.”  Smiling slightly, Steve handed Tony a helmet.  With shaky hands, he took it, throwing it atop his head.  Steve turned, throwing himself onto the bike as Tony paused, furrowing his brow.
Steve merely looks at him before he sits himself on the couch beside Tony.
It was his fault, no matter what she said.  But she didn’t try to pin the ‘it’s not you it’s me’ schtick on him, no.  He just….knew.  She couldn’t deal with his self destructive behavior anymore, it was ruining her.  And really, it wasn’t fair of him.  Not at all.
“Do you know how Pepper and him are doing?  Are they…?”
Winghead growled.
Schmidt just rolled his eyes. “ Good of you to grace us with your presence Commander. I assume you wouldn’t mind helping lead the brief?”
“ Sounds Like he wants to meet you.”
“ I think he likes you.” Ned said.
The door was slammed open and everyone looked up.
Wade pulled off and held Peter down by his hips. Wade looked at one waiting for a confirmation.
Tony smiled and traced the contours of his chest. Steve closed his eyes And breathed heavily through his nose.
“ It has come to out attention that we can improve as a team. Lately our teamwork and fighting has become sloppy. We can’t afford that in the field as many lives depend on us.”  Steve said.
“ Please, call me Grant. That’s my middle name. I don’t want you to confuse me with this bastard.” He flicked his head toward Steve.
Peter looked down sadly at him and Harry felt his heart break.
Steve groaned at the memory. This is why Tony won’t date him and Keeps on ignoring him. This is why is has to result to following him (not stalking, mind you). But hopefully that  is all about to change.
“ You understand him,” Tony asked.
“ They’re harmless.”
Tony then turned to Ste- Grant. Right. He wanted to be called Grant.
Steve quickly undid his belt and zipper, not bother to push down his pants. Then froze.
“ Well get unbusy. He found out about Tony and wants to see him and you know how that pain in the ass gets”
“ It’s just a joke Steve. We all know that you are the real pet and this human has you by the balls.”
Flash blocked his path, a cocky smirk adorning his face.
“ Baby girl, I need you to make sure that the security feed around the city is placed on a loop, I have uploaded what I have completed to far. Make us invisible.”
“ What? I can’t see those colors looking good on anyone.” Tony laughed again.
Strange waved his hand and they transported in what looked to be a study.
“ Wait-? What!” Steve spluttered and he saw Tony reach for his fly. Maybe that idiot archer was on to something.
Nat rested her elbows on the barrier and just stared at the strange couple. “ Clint radioed them to try fish at the other end of the pen. That should give you enough time to make it over here.”
“ Why were you under?”
“ Operation: Little Mermaid is a go.” Clint said over the comm. Tony just rolled his eyes. Winghead looked up at smiled brightly at him. Tony noticed that his hair looked as if it were combed with pompade placed in it. It made him wonder if he had escaped the pen again and stole from one of the SHIELD agents.
“ He really is not that bad. And in his defense every time he sees you your stealing something.”
“ Yes it does.”
“ Tony you don’t-“
“ Nah, Cap here is having trouble with his kids again.”
“ Oh yeah? Want to talk about Geometry Wanda?”
“ You idiot! Why the hell did you think it was a good idea to go down there with a Hydra shield!”
“ Nat...” he said softly and he took a step closer, “ Your alive I can’t believe... shit!” He yelled out as an arrow nearly hit his foot.
Steve sighed before looking at the door for Tony’s room. He shook his head and headed toward the gym.
Howard roared in anger and Steve looked as if he was going to piss himself especially when Howard pulled out a revolver . Steve paled and jumped through the window, shattering it.
Tony looks at him perplexed. “‘Want you more?’ This isn’t a competition. That’s the exact thing I’m tired of.”
“ Prick said he’s busy.”  Tony said as he sipped on his milkshake. He needed to get out of the house and thankfully Rhodey had taken him out for milkshakes and a walk through Central Park. And fucking Strange. What the hell was he doing that was so important. It wasn’t like he was actively practicing medicine. He was just sitting in his freaking magical apartment going god knows what with god knows who. Seriously, what could there possibly to do in an apartment that took up all of someone’s god damn time to the point where they can’t step a foot out of it for a week straight? He had orgies before and they never lasted this long. And his orgies were awesome. Like the stuff that goes down in legends and shit. So Harry Potter has no excuse to just ignore him.
The Red Skull just rolled his eyes. “ As mature as always, Barton.”
Tony felt his brow tick in annoyance as they ignored him.
“ I know what I’m capable of” Steve interrupted.
The man smirked. “ Well i don’t care what you call me, but Stevie over there just call me Tony because he will be yelling it later once you all leave and let us do the horizontal tango.”
Peter nodded. He was still thinking about what happened with Wade. He had told him it was okay, but Peter felt guilty. He wanted to be with Wade in that way, he really did. He even told him so. But he just freaked out.
“ They seem to be planning something. The two hate each other why would they get along now?” Nat mused as Grant seemed to be making wild gestures with his hands. Steve just looked at him and nodded as if he were agreeing with something.
“ Well are you going to tell us what it said?” Clint asked.
“ Honeybear! I want more ice cream.” Tony whined as pouted at Rhodey.
“ Just like that. Yeah. So god for me babe. I’m gonna fuck you until you can’t walk.”
Steve was balancing himself over his body. He looked down at him, smiling, with sweat gathering in his brow. Tony nodded, signaling that he was ready.
Grant sighed and ran a hand through his hair. “ Steve should I tell him?”
“ What?”
He nodded.
His fur was matted with blood, half of it more likely than not was Steve’s. The white wolf limped over, one of his legs cut open. Tony was frozen to the spot. Bucky stopped in front of him and looked at him, with big, soft puppy dog eyes and titled his head curiously. He whined petulantly and pawed the ground with his metal leg, as if he were expecting something.  This creature was dangerous. He brought this to the Tower. And oh god, he killed steve. This was all his fault. He killed Steve, the love of his life.
Little does she know.
“You can help me Steve, for fucks sake, but you can’t do the work for me.  Okay?  You can’t coddle me through my depression, through my anxiety, through my PTSD.  You can help, Steve, you can always help, because fuck if I don’t need comfort in my life, but I also need the goddamn truth.”
Tony’s stomach dropped.  No, no no.  Fuck that, nope.
“Not really.”
let out a small whimper, and instead he
The one that tugged down at the corners of Steve’s lips, dusting off the shine from his blue, blue eyes.  But he didn’t dwell on that, because he couldn’t, not now.
He says that a lot.  But mostly, he tells Tony how he knows Tony feels the same way, and that Tony’s too stubborn to admit it.  But Tony’s
I know that you travel, Howard, but where as I have no nanny, you have the money to hire fifty.  You have Maria, and as I’ve already talked to her, I know that–”
It was late, which he was thankful for, and as long as he kept his head low, it was easy enough to make his way through the dense streets of New York.  The deeper into downtown he got, however, the more the streets thinned out, until he was far into the red light district where he was one of the few people wandering about.
Steve had just managed to open his mouth, when Thor popped his head into the pantry.  “Ah, Tony!  Steven!  I see that Tony has once again passed out in a sack of rice, eh?  I didn’t realize it was a Tuesday.”
“I...I wanted to apologize for...earlier.  I-I didn’t realize it was such a…”
“I’m sorry, Tony.”
Steve grumbled, shoving Bucky away from him as his eyes adjusted to the bright sunlight seeping into the room.  The other man had a good 70 pounds on him, but he moved away from the bed and out of Steve’s face, holding his hands up in defense.
He didn’t realize that Steve was clutching him, tears in his own eyes as he pressed ginger kisses to his forehead, his cheeks, his jawline, muttering
“Well, I know I didn’t--”
Steve’s kept busy himself, of course.  With Bucky under, he’s trying to focus all of his energy on finding a cure, finding a solution, finding
Steve Rogers?  Eh.  He wasn’t exactly so sure on that, not like he’d had the time to test it out.
And Steve stayed silent through the whole thing, with shaking fists and tears rimming his eyes.  And, fuck, Tony would feel so guilty afterwards, guilty about the destroyed punching bags and knowing that yes, Steve left for a run 3 hours ago, and he’s not coming back for at least another hour.
“You’re a fucking idiot, you know that, right?”
Still.  He had to try.
“Sir has been awake for seventy eight hours now, Captain Rogers.”
A pause, followed by quiet, “As you wish, Sir.”
Peggy narrows her eyes, stepping away from the alcohol crawling towards her.  Howard, however, isn’t done.  “Do you know what a PR nightmare that’s going to be?  The kid’s already famous, and if they found out Maria wasn’t his mom…do you know what a clusterfuck that would be?  The mess I would have to clean up?”
you, J,” Tony singsonged, and the AI shut it.  “But no, yeah, the human Jarvis of course.  She only knew a few real dishes, but what she did know…it was great.”
He feels, sometimes, as if that is the case, as if he is living just for Steve, only for Steve.  He knows Steve relies on him too, of course, but, fuck, he knows it can’t work like that, it can’t be like that.
So, no, Steve hasn’t heard from Tony, but Natasha did bring him his shield back after the first month.  Just said that Tony knew it would be better with Steve.
somehow knew anything, but it was Natasha who spoke first.”
Again, when he awoke, the room was empty except for the tear stained redhead perched towards his right.
Tony wasn’t one to go on a stroll, but, God he needed to get out of the house, out and away from everything, from his feelings, from Steve, from–-
Eventually, Pepper’s sniffling died down, and with a hastily whispered
“Give it, Barton.”  He knew he should’ve burned that first.  “Barton you fucker, come back!”
Four months since he gave Tony the phone.  Four months since he’s heard a word from Tony.
“It’s urgent.”
“Tomorrow?  Yes, Tony it’s tomorrow.  And judging by that face, you completely forgot.”
Good.  He didn’t have anything to say to her, drunk or not.  Drunk at eight AM, no less.  But who cared, who fucking
Thor was grinning wide as usual, and nearly grasped his shoulder with his usual force, before Natasha stopped him.  His smile didn’t falter, however.  “It’s good to see you wake in the world of the living!”
And then, it was Steve and Tony once again, with Steve looking utterly and completely confused.  Tony just shrugged.
.  He didn’t really have an opinion either way.  He’d gone to a few once he’d buffed up and made varsity football, but he didn’t really understand all the hype that led up to one.  So once Bucky announced that the whole floor was throwing a rager the weekend he was supposed to visit back home, he didn’t feel the need to change his plans.
And he would get there.  Somehow.
been thinking up some sort of excuse for his behavior both during and after the gala.
His fake name was called and he stepped into the ring and found himself face to face with a man about a head taller than him and twice as wide.  Thick, dark stubble wrapped around his jawline, long locks slicked back with sweat.  His build was similar to Steve’s but while the Captain was perfectly proportioned, this man was too much, too thick, not
He rolled his eyes.  “Next question.”
It used to be a once in awhile thing.  Really, it was.
“Why don’t you look at yourself and see?” Prince Anthony sounded almost….amused as he said it, lips pursed, as if he was trying to keep himself from laughing.
“For someone posing as Howard Stark, I expected more from you, you fucking pussy.”
“It was football, back in high school,” Steve swallowed, hoping his face wasn’t as red as it felt.  He’d received many lewd compliments in the past and usually he could deal with if fine, but something about the man’s snarky lips and blazing eyes made Steve feel like a scrawny high school freshman all over again.
Turning the thing on, he made his way through the door and down the stairs, clambering through the main room (nearly empty now), and through the door.
But after it all, after they yelling and screaming and the shaking and the crying, Steve would hold him so, so tight, and remind him that he was loved, and that Steve was here, and that it would all be okay, because Steve was here.
because he’s
Unfortunately, however, he hadn’t driven himself.  So here he was, outside his own fucking gala in the middle of New York, in his finest Armani.  Not exactly inconspicuous.
Once dressed and outside their shack of a house, Steve was greeted by Epona, his horse.  She trotted up to him, nuzzling into his face.
worried,” and that, of course, made Tony scrunch up his nose because Steve would never admit that he alone was worried, he always had to bring everyone into this, because god forbid Steve admit that he was the one who was worried and it was his idea and his alone to confront Tony, because that would just be pathetic, wouldn’t it?  That he’d stooped so low that it was his idea to come give the drunken billionaire a pat on the back because that, that would be just
“He’s fine, like I said.  He’s in Kakariko, with some of my best guardsmen and personal friends.”
to do with anything any of you did, okay?  It was all me, one hundred percent.  So don’t change your behavior, just because you’ve discovered my dirty little secret.”
“You were right, Doc,” Tony said, as soon as Garner walked into the office.  The other man smiled, raising a brow at Tony.
Because it wasn’t sweet or cute or romantic and Tony most certainly didn’t want to kiss the man, deeply and sweetly just to get a taste of that beautiful voice and--
“Tell me when it really started.”
calling after him, but he elected to ignore it.  Once outside, he ripped off the bloodied mask, throwing it onto the ground as he took his sweatshirt off and balled it up, pressing it to his nose.
What he sees nestled inside the box nearly causes his knees to buckle.  He steps back, hands clutching at his own face but it doesn’t feel like his own hands because how could it how could it he can’t believe can’t believe can’t believe it why would Tony do this how could Tony do this how could he have ever done all those things to Tony said all those things because Tony is just so.  So.  So so so sososososo.
“I told you, I go see Steve.”
His brain was still oh so confused but this was the goddess damn
He’s at her bedside, telling a story about some SI board members with a strained smile.  He stops, frowns, and Peggy realizes she was supposed to laugh.
At that, Steve almost stopped, almost, because if he’s going through the gate and out of Faron woods, that meant he was on his way towards Hyrule field, which laid way to monsters and creatures Steve had never seen the likes of, only heard the stories from the elders, like Ben and Dr Erskine...
Steve, in ways he couldn’t explain...and was somewhat afraid to look into..
Maybe.  Maybe not.
“--because I’m asking you, why is that even on the goddamn server?  I don’t care if it’s redacted, if shouldn’t be there in the first place, if it can be hacked into so easily.  I swear, your security is so flawed it’s a fucking miracle an NYU freshman hopped up on too much Redbull hasn’t gotten access to all of your dirty little secrets.  I could’ve hacked it when I was still drinking my milk out of a goddamn sippy cup, I swear I--”
Steve nodded, not sure what else to say.  That seemed to be good enough for Tony, however, for the kid simply stared at him a moment longer, still smirking, then dashed down the hall without another word.
Steve didn’t even wait for an elaboration on the situation.  Instead he bolted through his door, nearly knocking it off his hinges as he made his way toward the stairs and down to the lab.  His chest ached with anxious, crippling fear, fear of the worst, as he made his way to the correct floor.  He didn’t even have to punch in the override code, the doors opened for him at his presence.
It isn’t until T’Challa is gone that Steve realizes he’s clutching the little, black phone in his hand.
Finally, Tony paused, turning toward him with a wicked grin.  Steve’s mouth was gaping, in too much shock and confusion to so much as close his jaw.  “Or, I should say,
Tony’s breathes began to even out, and he could make out his surroundings now, he could feel Natasha’s petit hand rubbing small circles into his back, could hear her soft, soothing words without them being obscured by the chaos in his head.  Eventually he was able to detach himself from her, refusing to meet her eyes.
He swings open his door, and freezes.  On his bed is a plastic crate, the
Peggy nods.  It’s only fair.
A pause, followed by a solemn, “Of course, Sir.”
It was his own damn gala, and he’d punched a grown man across the face, jumped out the window, and walked himself down to a whorehouse.
She regretted that her job wouldn’t let her be with her little boy the way a parent should be there for their child.  She regretted the times that the boy was brought into–where having a child out of wedlock would most likely damage her position in the career she’d fought so hard for.  She regretted that she took out her grief with sex and alcohol, instead of in a more positive fashion.  She regretted that it was with
For Tony, who spent the last twenty-five years doing what made him happy - doing what avoided the responsibility that had fallen on his shoulders - it was a lot to consider.
Steve smiled. “You remember when I broke out the 107th from that Hydra prison?”
to know, either; he could already feel himself growing too close to Steve, and he knew it would become an unmitigated disaster the moment Steve found out the truth about Tony’s double life - not that he could ever be allowed to know. But for all his genius, Tony always sort of assumed he was living on borrowed time - not just from the arc reactor, but it was only a matter of time before SHIELD put two and two together and they or the Squadron Supreme put Iron Man down.
"You've got a sprained ankle and a couple of bruised ribs," Jarvis announces as soon as Tony makes a sign of movement. "And you almost ran down your bloody repulsor pump.
Steve lunged from the bay doors into a controlled dive, while Iron Man’s boot jets launched him with effort into the fray. His onboard guns were already prepped and ready to return fire to the troops on the ground.
"Thanks," he said.
The Krampus wheeled around. "CAPTAIN AMERICA," it said loudly. "YOU HAVE BEEN NAUGHTY."
Baron Wilhelm von Strucker's castle - and base of operations - is exactly the charming sort of place Tony would have expected out of such an upstanding Hydra official. Perched on a mountain, it is not only difficult to reach, but cold and drafty. Everything looks gray in the bleak colorlessness of the late winter sky. It's a damn unpleasant day for a raid, though Tony wouldn't exactly have wished for spring flowers, either.
to hear you say that."
Steve still had a few hours until the party, and a little longer after that if he didn't want to show up in a weirdly punctual fashion. He almost never took naps during the day, but decided as he stretched back out on the couch that it wouldn't be a bad idea. He hadn't slept particularly well the night before, and he would probably need that extra energy to cope with tonight.
The twenty-first century - progression of history, technology, and pop culture references aside - wasn't particularly more daunting than the 1940's had been, and the leisure time was certainly new. He had lunch with Natasha, they watched a few more episodes of a documentary series on the universe, had dinner, and finally it was time for Steve to start getting ready.
It was almost worth it just to see the surprise on Barton's face, but Coulson didn't doubt his gamble, and it wasn't mere hero worship. Steve Rogers just had a way with people, a genuine quality that was hard to ignore, and regardless of Stark's investment in Captain America, Coulson was sure that a little of the old fashioned approach was just what the situation needed.
Steve went at it with enthusiasm now, bobbing up and down, sucking with intent; Tony just slumped bonelessly in the chair and put his hands on Steve's head, playing with his hair, letting his lover go for it. When Steve slipped his hand up between Tony's slick thighs and pushed two fingers into his hole, Tony tensed; the press of Steve's fingertips against his prostate was enough to send him right over. Tony came with a shout that he didn't bother trying to muffle, his hips jerking up reflexively until he was buried even deeper in Steve's mouth.
"Trust me," Tony said, looking up at Steve with a raised eyebrow. "Justin Hammer is
“It’s a miniaturized arc reactor,” Tony said. “Like the really big one that powers my factory.”
"Tony is a close friend of mine," Steve says. "I saw he had an appointment with you yesterday -"
Natasha paused after a sip of beer, and peered at Steve with shrewd, narrowed eyes. "And what else?"
to write
"Get down!" Steve cries.
give into the urge to put his head in his hands. "Tony is dying," he says, as evenly as he can manage.
"About today," Steve finally blurts. He shifts his weight from one foot to the other, a self-conscious gesture that does not seem to belong to such a powerful man. "On the deck."
Tony laughed, accepting the help as he lurched back up to stand. “Why, thanks, Cap,” he said. He patted the edge of the shield that was still strapped on his right arm. “You know, I almost don’t want to give this back. I’m thinking about adding a shield onto the armor, what do you say?”
Maybe, Steve has to admit, Peggy's fears are well-founded. Steve has difficulty remaining objective where Tony is concerned, especially after the way things ended between them ... with Tony simply leaving. In all that time, there had been no letters, no phone calls. Steve hadn't harbored a great deal of illusions about what life after the war would hold for them, he'd found it too hard to think about the future beyond the desire to live to see it, but he never imagined it would end without a word.
He didn't get any further than that, as Tony closed the space between them, surging forward for a kiss. Steve caught Tony up in his arms and drew him in close, kissing like his life depended on it. His heart was pounding, like it might leap right out of his chest, and yet Steve felt like a huge weight had been lifted, one he didn't even know was there. He knew it couldn't be so easy, that there were still things they had to discuss, to work through, to make this work, but Steve also knew it would be worth it, now that he knew Tony wanted it, too.
So far into his career, Tony had managed to avoid giving away his secret. His
"I fit the profile!" he said. "I have military background, I'm a native Iowan."
Steve was enforcing that rule by sitting on the couch with him, gingerly cuddling Tony and feeding him an occasional bit of gingerbread cookie while they watched
Steve was on edge for the rest of the drive to the party, periodically glancing at the wing mirror to see if any headlights seemed to be following them.
eight, and ... it was a lot. “I’m sorry about what I said earlier,” he said. “About my dad wanting me to be like you. I, uh ... it was weird, you know? Adult brain, childish feelings.”
Tony laughed, slinging his arm around Steve’s shoulders as they headed for the door. “Maybe I’ll make a reprisal this year.”
Steve can't decide whether he wants to punch him or kiss him. "No, Tony. I'm not here to arrest you."
“He sent it on another ship headed this way,” Jim says.
“None for me, thanks, JARVIS,” Tony said. He lifted a gauntleted hand in a weak wave. “I just want to sleep this off. The post-power cosmic feeling is like about the worst hangover ever.”
Tony shrugs out of the robe, letting it fall to the floor. He steps in close, and runs his hands down the lapels of Steve's suit jacket, before undoing the buttons on the front with sure fingers. Tony pushes the jacket from Steve's shoulders, before dropping his hands to Steve's belt buckle, beginning to unfasten it.
By the time Tony’s hand came down to wrap around Steve’s cock - Steve determinedly, stubbornly, leaving things very literally in his lover’s capable hands - Steve felt like the slightest stimulation would send him right over the edge, he was so wound up from their languorous pace. Tony stroked him once, twice, then Steve was spilling into Tony’s hand.
Steve let himself in, and nearly backed out again when he saw Natasha was abed. She had cleaned up as well, but lounged on her bunk in a set of what looked like silk pajamas and a robe. Strangest of all, though, the thing that made Steve reconsider, was that she had two cords running out of her pajama shirt, to what looked like a small generator.
“Together,” Steve agreed. Like it was always meant to be.
They get out of the rest of their clothes when they go to clean up, and Tony is finally granted the opportunity to see Steve naked in a scenario where he is actually welcome to look. Steve seems surprisingly at ease under the scrutiny of Tony's gaze; maybe there's an unspoken rule that shyness has no place between two people who have just had sex.
"I hate castles," Tony still complains, maneuvering his armor with loud clanking sounds across the rickety bridge. "My last time in one wasn't exactly a party."
"As in Captain America?" Tony asked.
Steve made a grumpy noise. He knew he was being childish, but he still couldn't help noting, "I went the entire
, or something - squints in confusion up at Tony, but as soon as he turns his head and sees Steve, his heart rate calms and he relaxes back against the table.
"We should." Tony drags over a stepladder and climbs up the first two steps, to get a better look at the control panel on top of the tank. Then he pauses, laughing softly to himself. "You know, I didn't think you'd take me at my word on that."
Steve passes him on the way to the sink with a stack of dirty dishes, and pauses to kiss Tony on the cheek. Understanding now that Steve clearly just doesn't mind these displays in front of Anthony, Tony turns his head for a quick peck on the lips, then heads for the elevator.
"I could say the same for myself with you."
he should take it, but before his brain properly caught up with his body, he was sitting up and peeling off his t-shirt. There was an undershirt beneath, woven with a special, extra-thick fabric of Tony’s own design over the chest. He hesitated long enough to brace himself, but not long enough to question his decision, then peeled that up and off, too.
Tony carefully looked away, wincing. “There’s an entire team of superheroes who have been trying to bring him in for years,” he pointed out.
“Don’t worry, Tony. The Guardians
. It's funny, because I always think of Brooklyn as home, and it's a thousand miles away."
Steve pressed a teasing kiss to his ear. “That’s the idea.”
“That was ...” Tony began, before giving up on the effort to decide what it was.
movies, either.
Steve drops his duffel on the floor with a sigh. "I'm not disappointed by the apartment."
"And I take my work very seriously." Steve's hand drifts a little further south than is strictly necessary for this pretense of helping steady Tony on the ladder. The ladder where Tony happens to be standing all of a foot and a half off the floor.
Steve looked suspicious, but Tony could see him let it go in the next second. "I slept pretty well," he said. "I smelled coffee."
Agent Drew murmurs an encouraging word to Steve right before she kicks him to his knees on the hard concrete floor. He grunts when he lands, but otherwise remains silent, staring stubbornly up at the woman who approaches.
Besides, Steve knew Clint meant well enough, and in many ways Clint could sympathize with Tony as Steve could not. They were both men with questionable pasts, physically normal human beings on a team full of superpowered humans and a god, making an example for a younger generation of heroes like Sam Wilson to follow. It was no wonder to Steve that Clint had actually tried to get through to Tony back on the planet, to speak to the man inside the power cosmic.
, right until the entire room began to shake.
Tony didn’t know what reaction he was expecting, but for Steve to take a small step forward, for his shoulders to round down in something like relief, was not it.
Steve glanced back toward Tony’s private elevator. “I should ...”
," JARVIS replied, not sounding very sorry at all. "
Tony doesn't say anything, just closes the distance and kisses Steve, which is answer enough.
"Are you leaving?" Steve asked, a little anxious.
I should be shouting when -”
Baron von Strucker only laughs harder, moving to stab the needle into Tony's neck.
"I do have to admit I'm a little jealous," Tony admits.
who I want to be thinking about right now. Ultimate boner-killer."
“What?”
The words hung in the air for a split second, long enough for them both to stop short and consider their implications. Steve ducked his head, self-conscious, and Tony looked down and away, rubbing at the back of his neck.
And like that, the tension is broken. Steve kisses his way down Tony's abdomen, lovingly brushing his lips over every little scar from Tony's days as a daring adventurer. He nips at Tony's hip, laves his tongue down the divot, relishes in the way that Tony arches and gasps beneath him.
"So ... pardon my asking, but how are you simultaneously both twenty-something and ninety-six right now?" Tony asked.
"I am ... surprisingly okay with that," Tony agreed, getting himself comfortably situated on a heap of pillows.
Tony was exhausted and his feet hurt (he’d only worn a pair of flip-flops down to Steve’s apartment earlier) by the time he paused on a street corner to watch Steve enter the glow of an all-night laundromat.
"Usually it's that I kill them at the end," Natasha said.
"We won," Jarvis says, grudging and more than a little grumpy. "You're down for the count for a while at any rate - the Iron Man needs too many repairs."
Steve nodded, stepping up closer to rest a hand warmly on the small of Tony’s back. “I believe in this, Tony. I believe in you. This is going to work, and we’re going to get our lives back.”
Tony shrugged, sliding his hands up Steve's arms, from wrist to shoulder. "Not really thinking about practicality right now, Cap."
"That's arguable." Tony laughed, a thought occurring to him. "In retrospect, it seems a little ridiculous that I showed
This is almost certainly where Steve was headed earlier with Tony, before they got interrupted, but Tony isn't jealous; he's wasted a lot of his time being jealous over one lover of Steve's or another through the years, wanting what they had, and it's the benevolence that comes with being confident over his own place in Steve's life that allows Tony to keep such an open mind now. It helps, too, that Tony
Steve reached his hand out, and Dum-E dropped a small remote control - a garage door opener, Steve realized - into it. He'd thought Tony was joking about his experiment into artificial intelligence ... or maybe the robot was just programmed to help show people out. Steve glanced back into the theater area, where Tony hadn't moved, and shrugged.
Tony blinked. “Uh ... yeah, I guess.”
"Expensive," says Steve. "Flashy."
"What?"
"Do you see?" Zemo adds. "Together, we have accomplished what my predecessor, what Baron von Strucker, what the Red Skull himself never could!"
Tony's expression flickered for a moment; was it empathy? "I know the feeling," he said softly.
Von Strucker straddles Tony's lap and gets a firm grip on his chin, and holds Tony's head still while he depresses the plunger, letting its poisonous contents burn through Tony's veins.
“He has been keeping a low profile, leaving you alone a lot lately,” Steve said, breaking Tony out of his thoughts.
that it's Tony, but the evidence strongly suggests it. What we do know is that Tony Stark disappeared just a few months after Wilhelm von Strucker was brought in."
Tony grins. "
Natasha nodded, satisfied. "Just remember that the best lies have a grain of truth in them. If you can answer a question honestly, do it. Don't get too elaborate, make sure you tell the same stories to everyone so you don't slip up. So, Steve," she went on, dropping into a conversational tone, "tell me about yourself."
"Good morning," Steve says softly.
The conversation stumbles a little on the introductions, but Steve is a fan of the magazine, and before Tony knows it, he’s invited Captain America into his workshop and is showing off the Iron Man. The way that Steve regards the armor with a mixture of reverence and awe, the way his hands look as he traces the dents and dings with his fingertips, convinces Tony that he just might be in trouble where keeping this one at arm’s length is concerned.
Tony shrugged, turning to walk away. He sat down on the edge of the bed and kicked off his shoes. "I don't know, I don't go home with a lot of strange men."
"Yep." Steve nodded.
Steve, determined to take things more slowly this time, reaches for the belt on Tony's robe and tugs it loose. The robe falls open, baring the fact that Tony is naked beneath it.
After breakfast and cleanup, Steve turned his attention to making himself presentable. He felt sort of wrong doing it, but if part of his supposed allure to Tony lay in his appearance, Steve supposed he needed to look as good as possible. He enlisted Natasha's help in choosing his clothes, and finally left the house in jeans, and a cardigan sweater layered over a shirt, with his coat, gloves, and scarf to keep warm.
"I know that," Steve said, a little embarrassed, once he finally managed to clear his throat. "Anyway, he invited me to a Christmas party he's having tomorrow."
Stark is more at ease now, but he still reaches up and begins to paw at the oxygen mask. Tony checks a few readings, then moves to help him with it. Seeing Tony just confuses Stark again, though, and the man spends a long moment glancing between Tony and Steve.
And, alright, maybe doing this in the kitchen was pretty far from being as romantic as Steve would have liked to be right now, but little in their relationship had been conventional, and it suited them well enough, didn’t it?
“But,” Tony added, “that was ... before.”
Steve glanced up with a mischievous look on his face, but he was merciful and chose not to tickle Tony, likely aware that it would hardly be pleasant under the circumstances. Instead, Steve shifted his way further down Tony's body, until he was situated between Tony's legs, hands framing Tony's hips and breath warm where his mouth hovered tantalizingly close over Tony's straining erection.
Steve muffled a louder noise against the pillows when his cock was freed to brush against the soft sheets. He reached for the bedside table, nearly pulling the drawer off its track in his search for lube and a condom.
At that moment, as he eagerly scrambled out of bed after Tony, Steve was relieved that Natasha had insisted he take the master bedroom with the bathroom attached. They indulged in quite a bit more shameless touching once they were in the shower, and Steve patiently waited through Tony's inspection of the now nearly healed bullet wound in his side. The mark was down to just a vaguely pink spot with shiny new skin stretched over top, and Steve was a little self-conscious of the fact that Tony paid it so much mind.
Steve opened his mouth to respond, but paused after the significant look Tony leveled at him. “Is that so?”
"I'm greedy," Tony adds. "I'd really, really like to watch him fuck you." He flicks a glance up to Anthony, and smiles. "You want to know what it's like, don't you?"
Tony certainly seemed relatively unaffected by the day, all things considered; his hands were sure and determined as he worked open the front of Steve’s uniform. Tony’s confidence was a reassurance, his fingers steady while they unfastened Steve’s belt.
great of a movie. Everyone just has false nostalgia for it being great because the copyright ran out and, with it being in the public domain, lots of television networks played it because it was free. And you
don't want to sleep with him?"
Steve reached his free hand between them and wrapped around both their cocks, long fingers offering a tight space for them to thrust into; Tony rocked his hips to keep up with the rhythm of Steve’s, moaning softly between kisses. Steve’s pace was leisurely, but they were both wound up enough that it didn’t last long. Tony came first, orgasm shuddering through his body, making him gasp for breath. Steve was quieter about it, he always was, shifting thoughtfully to rub off against Tony’s hip until, at last, he came between their bodies. He gave up the ghost on trying to prop himself up after that, but shifted to one side, somehow managing to wedge most of his weight between Tony’s side and the couch cushions.
"Right now?" Anthony asks, raising his eyebrows.
Steve smiled at that, and took up a slow rhythm with his fingers, slowly drawing them out before thrusting back in again, gradually tucking in a third with the first two. Once Steve did that, Tony was half gone already, stretched tight around Steve's fingers and nearly begging for it as he worked his hips back against the touch, fucking himself on Steve's hand.
"No shit," Tony said flatly. "What kind of genius would I be if I didn't recognize a SHIELD agent when I see one?"
“Iron Man has spent too long terrorizing you,” Steve said. “If someone could bring him in ...”
“You got one of these things at home?” Hawkeye asked.
me. Saved me from myself, whoever I thought I was there. Actually, I’m not sure that’s much different than reality.”
On the cover, Iron Man stood with
Steve turns, looking over his shoulder at Tony, eyebrows raised significantly. Tony just gives the tiniest of nods, meeting Steve's eyes with determination. With that, an unspoken agreement passes between them, and Steve turns back to the door.
“Right,” Tony said. He finished fastening his pants and stepped over to the nearest computer terminal. “I’ve been experimenting with a few different options for you to disable the armor, but the most obvious answer - an electromagnetic pulse - isn’t as viable as it would be if he didn’t have my stolen tech on board, which is shielded
The med evac team, true to May's word, arrived within seconds, and one of them urged Tony away so that the professionals could take over Steve's care. They got Steve loaded up onto a stretcher, and pressed an unnecessary (he thought) oxygen mask over his face.
“I think -” Tony took a breath. “I think I saw another
Choosing not to be offended by way of ignoring that remark, Tony slides beneath the covers again and shifts close to kiss Steve. He keeps it light at first, but Steve slowly wakes from the attention, returning the kiss in a much lazier way than he typically does anything. Tony loves waking Steve up like this for that very reason, though this morning he resists Steve's typical attempts to roll him back into the pillows.
Natasha nodded again, an understanding expression on her face. Steve glanced at her, and shifted uncomfortably in his chair, still unable to put the pieces together.
Tony smiles, pleasantly surprised by the offer. "If you think this makes up for abandoning date night ..."
Steve’s face was hot with his rising anger, but he worked to keep his temper in check and his voice level as he answered, “We thought you were
"Before he died, he gave me this. He said it was the cure, that Tony would know what to do," Steve says all in a rush, excitement surging through his veins. "I had forgotten all about it, but ..."
Tony sighed, slumping down to nuzzle at Steve’s shoulder. “Relaxing is good. I can relax. I’m
"Nothing like that. I can't get drunk." Steve thinks privately, though, that he would probably not, even if he could.
"My heart?" Tony wonders, glancing down at the glass bubble. He never has gotten used to the sight of his own heart, beating away in his chest. He didn't explain the truth in
Tony waffled for a moment between disdain for the idea of Steve's pity, and desperately wanting the comfort being freely offered. He finally went for the comfort (he was a hedonist, after all) and admitted, "I think my bruises have bruises."
Tony's clothes came off much more easily, t-shirt and jeans falling into a heap on the floor where Steve's boots and trousers followed in short enough order. Down to their skivvies and barely accomplishing much by now thanks to their efforts to continue touching and kissing, they moved in an awkward, tumbling shuffle toward the shower.
Tony gripped Steve’s shoulders, and put his genius to work in the way he shifted against Steve until they could move together in a better rhythm, Tony’s cock a hot and hard length against Steve’s own.
Steve glances around the lab before he moves any closer, and Tony is momentarily thrilled by the idea that Steve might have sought him out for an afternoon rendezvous.
"We haven't had much opportunity to talk since the accident," Jarvis said. His tone was as soft and comforting to Tony as it had always been, his accent mild after so many years living in the States, and soothing to the ear.
Steve tightened his arms around Tony, thinking of Quill’s earlier words:
“You speak madness,” Thor said.
"This is Obadiah Stane," said Fury. "He took over as CEO of Stark Industries when Howard Stark died. We have reason to believe he is aware of Tony's whereabouts and possibly even complicit in convincing him to stay away."
"The teaching credentials, I earned on my own, though," Tony added, with a hint of pride in his voice.
"No travel, then?" Coulson was not normally given to asking intrusive questions in casual conversation; in fact, he quite disliked it, but in this case it happened to fall under necessary information for his job. He watched Tony's reaction carefully, but there was nothing suspicious about it.
“You want us to attack the Squadron because you have a warm and fuzzy feeling we were once teammates?” Hawkeye scoffed. “Sorry, I’m out.”
"Don't be," Tony answers. "Please, darling, don't be."
feel around ten hot showers away from being clean again?
Steve laughs softly, leaning in for another kiss. "I don't want to live in a hotel, Tony."
"Peggy and I are friends," Steve says.
“I mean ... no lecture?” Tony asked. “No guilt trip?”
Steve rolled his eyes behind the faceplate - not that Tony could see him do it - and fumbled at the helmet while Tony walked through the armor disassembly.
Feeling like a creeper and really hoping that Steve wouldn’t take it the wrong way, Tony decided to walk inside, figuring that he’d come all this way and it was pointless to go back by himself. Maybe he could talk Steve into a cab, or call Happy around with a car.
It should have been more surprising when Steve answered, “Sure.”
"Huh?" Clint looked puzzled for a moment, before realizing that Steve must have been referring to the mission. "Oh. No, I'm just here to hang out with you guys for Christmas."
Hydra's old
Steve sits down at the tiny kitchen table, and watches while Peggy fills a kettle with water and puts it on to heat. "He knows about the Hydra presence in Madripoor ... he said they're collecting scientists."
Steve flushed slightly, and looked away. "Not exactly. I know you can take care of yourself, and that Director Fury will make sure you have plenty of people there to watch your back."
Steve wasn't exactly happy about the idea of being a librarian - couldn't there have been an opening for an art teacher? - any more than he was about the idea of going in deep cover, but he listened to the details, nodding in all the appropriate places, and fled as soon as the meeting was dismissed.
"Oh, yeah," Anthony assures. He actually has a flush on his cheeks, which Tony finds endearing, while simultaneously certain he isn't, himself, capable of anything of the sort.
Steve was great, and his hands were warm, skimming under the hem of Tony’s shirt and up Tony’s back, around to brush over Tony’s sides, like Steve was trying to map him.
"Krampus," Cap said. "It's -- like the --"
Tony looked reluctant, but the lure of sleep was clearly too much for him. He let Steve help him get settled under the covers, but Tony reached out and caught Steve’s hand when Steve turned to leave. “Stay with me,” he murmured.
With a ripple of nervous anticipation - the paranoia of the others rubbing off on him, clearly - Tony opens the box.
Christmas movie," Clint said. "You gotta watch this one with us - Nat, start it over."
Tony Stark sits with his back turned toward Steve all the while, fingertips idly dancing over the ivories in a faux jaunty tune. A cigarette smolders away in the crystal ashtray to his right, next to a tumbler of whiskey. The good stuff. Neat.
"My flight out's in a couple hours," Clint said. "I don't like flying on an empty stomach, so breakfast at four it is."
on the Cabal’s submarine.”
Steve lowered the tablet and looked up at Tony, an easy smile appearing. “Tony.”
"Besides," she added. "
Tony sighed. "I see your point, okay? But, Steve ... I'm not just doing it because it's you. You're great incentive, don't get me wrong, but - my brain doesn't work that way. I see a teammate in the line of fire and I'm not thinking about whether they're better able to take the hit than I am, I'm thinking about doing what I can to keep a bad situation from getting worse."
“I thought you might,” Tony said. “You’ve taught me that people tend not to like handouts.”
>>I'd love to. How about noon, and I'll pick up the Chinese on the way?
By the time he went to bed that night, tired and happy and with a comfortably full stomach, Steve thought it was about the closest he'd come to feeling normal in the twenty-first century yet.
Here in the Bavarian Alps, no one in German command suspected that any Allied forces would be so foolish as to attempt a ground incursion (least of all with merely two men), so the presence of the dirigible was certainly a surprise to them. Intelligence reports had gotten out prior to this, of course, about the Allies and their crack team of super-powered men, but the enemy remained ignorant of the knowledge the Allies had gained about Hitler’s growing collection of occult artifacts.
Tony groaned with relief, even as he shuddered at the sensation of cool air against his erection. "
"Thanks." Tony padded into the kitchen, found a mug in the cabinet over the coffee maker, and poured himself a cup. He skipped the cream and sugar, but helped himself to a glazed donut from the box on his way back into the living room.
Anthony takes a deep breath, and nods on the exhale. "Okay."
"Then come home. Clear your name." Steve steps up behind Tony, and winds his arms loosely around the man's waist. "It's dangerous for you to stay here. We're not the only ones who know you're here - Hydra knows it, too."
Of all the things Steve was feeling at the moment - and they numbered in a confusing jumble - chief among them was ... relief?
sex," Steve pointed out, keeping his voice quiet. If she was trying to get a blush out of him, it wasn't going to work.
"Steven Larsen."
Mr. Jarvis has closed the hatch, anyway.
"Pretty sure eeeverybody knows that one."
"It's just a nosebleed," Tony says.
to lose himself in it, but his mind keeps drifting back to the things that are sticking in his brain, until the words just sort of slip out: "Why wouldn't I even
"Tony ..."
"Call me Natasha," she greeted firmly, holding out a hand to Tony.
"I can't do that, can I?" Tony wondered. He couldn't imagine Howard would approve. But, a little voice in his head reminded him, Howard wasn't going to be around to approve or disapprove of any of his decisions, anymore.
friends.
“How are you feeling?” she asked.
"What? Like everyone doesn't know about his massive hard-on for --"
Steve was exhausted, and he knew Tony had to be, too, and it showed in the sloppy desperation of the way they rutted against each other in those last few seconds - as Steve climbed toward his climax, and the force of it punched a moan out of him as he finally came, breaking that tension. Tony followed within seconds, and Steve had to hurriedly put his arms tight around Tony’s waist, just to keep Tony from sagging and sliding away as he went decidedly boneless against Steve.
“So that just leaves Black Widow,” Steve said.
“We all do, sometimes,” Steve said, trying to keep diplomatic about it.
Tony stopped, shutting his mouth with an audible click.
Tony didn't question it, when Steve got out his cell phone and started firing off a text message to Natasha, but he wasn't telling her about his plans, which she already knew of; he was alerting her to the presence of the mysterious sedan. She texted back almost immediately that she would look into it, and after that, he put his phone away, not wanting to be rude.
Everyone turned to look at Steve as Steve turned to Peter and Quentin.
Tony Rolled his eyes and sighed. “ It’s really not that bad.”
“ Really? ‘Spider ass?’”
Wingheads entire body including his tail had turned a bright red and  Tony felt his body suddenly become slack.
“ Yep.”
“ And what’s the exact point of having me here?”
“ I found a cabin boss. It’s off season so it should be empty. I have sent the coordinates.”
“ You know you can just bye a cruise ship ticket right?”
“ Jesus fuck! How did you do that?” Steve chuckled as he kissed Tony again and began to grind against him.
Steve Gave an exasperated sigh and looked up toward Tony. Tony noticed his eyes were red and swollen, almost as if he had been crying.
“ Well you need to exercise. The doctor said you need more cardio.”
The salutation went unanswered.
“ Yeah I’m hoping not.”
Rhodey had flabbergasted when he saw the disaster zone and then he broke out laughing when he saw the table set with a bouquet of roses in the middle with a single candle.
It looked very similar to his own office. There were pictures of the Avengers and Stark family photos. There was even the college photo of him and Rhodey and MIT sitting on the exact same self as his own office. His mahogany desk was still the same, expect cleaner and the office chair was turned facing the city.
“ I need a condom.”
Tony rolled his eyes.  “ Bruce?” Tony asked.
Short chapter. Sorry
It was just them and Winghead getting ready to enter the enclosure that Winghead had stayed at until he decided to move in with Tony.
“ It is-“
Bucky tilted his head as if he didn’t understand.
Steve smiled, “ Of course.”
Tony get his throat constricted. He felt as if someone was trying to rip his heart out of his chest. Oh god. He was really
Loki gave him a strange look, “ Uh, like no. Why would I want to do that? Does it look like I want to go to war? That’s just stupid. I rather be sipping wine and eating expensive pudding.”If Tony didn’t know better he would have thought he was a teenage girl from the attitude he gave. Well at least it was nice to know that this Loki wasn’t obsessed with being king.
“ What the- Tony?” He asked in surprise. Tony pushed him against the closed door and kissed him.  Steve froze in surprise before placing his large hands on his waist. Tony pulled back and looked at him.
Quentin rolled his eyes.
“ Yeah just like that baby. Suck it. Show me how good you can suck.” He encouraged. Steve swirled his tongue and moan loudly. Iron man pulled out his fingers and gave Steve a loud spank on his right ass cheek. “ You like that? Huh? Like me spanking that ass? So tight....I can pound you all day..” he delivered another spank to his rear. Steve cried out at the impact.
The Avengers war has they saw Steve and Grant walk through the common area. They greeted them happily and smiled in a way that was too happy. They then saw Tony walking behind them slowly and then settling himself down gingery on the couch.
Steve looked up from his book.
“ Tony,” It was Steve.  “ Tony, please open the door. I’m worried.” His voice was soft and he did genuinely sound worried.
“ Hi, darling, just came to check in on you.” He said happily as he leaned forward to press a kiss on his cheek. “ Everyone treating you okay?”
Tony was going to make a trip to school tomorrow.
Grant chuckled. “ You know, I can show you a good time Tony.” He walked over and deposited himself next to the couple on the floor.
With that Tony began walking away. Steve just sighed as he leaned back. That was a close one.
“ You didn’t complain when I stalked you.” Nat quipped with a smile.
Rhodey smiled down at Tony and wrapped an arm around him. “ You in a military base? Yeah that’s not a good idea.” He leaned down and placed a kiss on his temple.
“ Watch your mouth.” The guy holding his leash growled.
“ Well i guess you can’t deny that,” Wanda interjected.
“ Hey Pete.”
“ So is he hot?”
“ You Can bring your friends if you want. I’m totally cool with that. I know it kinda sucks to be at a party and not like know anyone. It is more than fine with me.”
“ Well he’s pissed with me. Maybe he will like someone that hates my guts. Might want to team up with those tabloids. They will love each other.” He was glad Pepper was ok. The wounds were only superficial.
Steve growled at the semi-insult aimed toward Tony. Tony saw the other vampire exaggeratedly roll his eyes.
When he got there he pushed the love seat in front of the elevator door to block access and ran to his- the other Tony’s- room.
He pushed Grant down and began to straddle him.
“ Keep your eyes on me.”
“ Yeah. Do I have to? I mean.... ok. Ok. I’ll be there. Give me an hour.”
“ I know it sounds silly for you. How about Edward.”
The baby giggled again and began to suck on his hand. Tony wasn’t one for children but this one would be the exception.
Steve looked affronted and opened his mouth to retort. But Tony was faster.
“ You stubborn fish it isn’t that bad.” Tony snapped as he tried to manually pry open Winghead’s jaw as he had clamped down on a toothbrush and refused to let it go. According to Strange’s report, Winghead he the ability to regrow his teeth, but first any damages teeth had to be removed. While Steve was never actually caught by Hydra, he had been caught in one of their traps and Strange had said he probably escaped by chewing his way through. Due to this he felt that he probably broke a tooth or two. That would make sense if that was the reason Winghead didn’t want the close to his mouth especially if it was still sore.
“ Get back here you asshole!” The door burst open and Bucky ran through the room and clamberedover Steve and Tony, followed by an irate Clint.
“ Be Good Tony. Let me know if you need anything!” He said as Bucky dragged him through the door, shutting it once they were out.
“ Has he been tested?”
“ You fell through the fucking.... ceiling,” Bucky laughed.
“ It’s Fine. It really is. It’s probably nothing I’ve never heard before.”
Peter pushes himself onto his elbows and noticed he was in his NASA sweater and blue sweatpants. He immediately gets embarrassed as he saw Harry basically naked expect for a pair of Calvin Klein boxer briefs. My god did he look like a model, Peter thought.
“ Of course he does! It’s a mutual agreement.”
Tony smirked, “ Hi.”
“ Is that so?”
Grant smiled and rolled himself over Tony.
It was true once the guy had said he was ready Steve was very gentle and a completely different person. He seemed extremely surprised at the change in temperament and seemed to be genuinely enjoying himself. He then offered to come back tomorrow if Steve was interested. Steve just shrugged in response. It didn’t matter if it was just a copy. Anyone could be a copy, no one could be the real thing.
“ He can, your grace. He most definitely can,” he said quickly.
“ really Tony?” Steve sighed.
Peter smiled and gave him a chaste kiss.
“So before I was with Nat,” Tony rolled his eyes as Bucky began his speech. He knew how this was going to turn out and he glowered at Nat who was doing nothing to hide the smirk on her face behind the book she was reading. “I was with a variety of people, Some of them occasionally older. I found that it was better if they got a massage Afterwards, especially doing anal. It relaxes the muscles especially after a hard rutting.”
“Team Hydra.” Tony turned to his left and saw a giant screen showing Schmidt. “ There’s a fire in...”
It turned out Howard and Peggy, the female mermaid with the short brown hair,had been best friends during the war as both were ecstatic to see one another. Out of the original pod only Peggy, Steve and Bucky had survived.
“ He’s been talking to Bucky about that since he first saw you in the conference for renewable energy. Said you looked so stressed and probably needed a massage. Did he make it weird?”
Harry chuckled. “ Were you expecting someone different?”
Tony quietly walked up to him and embraced him. Jarvis hugged him back.
Everyone had been stupefied to say the least as Loki glared at a sheepish looking Thor. He had his arms crossed at his chest and was tapping his foot irritably as he waited for Thor to answer. However he was never given the chance as he went on a tirade of how he left his bed before morning and never returned his raven ( was that like Asgardian for text?) and He then accused Thor of sleeping around with ‘ Midgardian  whores’ ( has he really though? Jane dumped his ass then he has been pretty busy saving the world and all. Then Captain asshole and Commander dickhead have been keeping him busy with workouts).
Steve shook his head. “ No he seems really tired afterwards and he’s not hard.”
“ TV has the best view.”
Tony rolled his eyes. “ Not even close.”
“ Well it won’t be over night and it will take teamwork. And you all have to be honest with me and each other. Usually I would start with one on one sessions, but I get the feeling that you all will protest. Am I correct?”
“ It’s just an idea.”
Steve nipped him.
“ Uhhh...”
“ Fine then. No super fun time. “
Maria was sobbing uncontrollably and it broke his heart. Those assholes left him in the medical bay with just Maria. He couldn’t believe it.
Their first kiss happened one night when they were alone in Tony’s penthouse. They were laughing and had been horsing around. Tony has goaded Steve to a wrestling match and Steve had followed along.
Tony just stared in awe. It was absolutely beautiful. Then the lab the Howard at ushered him to was like a wet dream on steroids. The beautiful machinery glistened under the bright lights and seemed to sparkle like diamonds. The holographic display was quite impressive too. Tony listened eagerly as Howard went through different projects he was working on currently. He asked Tonys opinion on what material would be best and the functionality of each design.
“ Well that did not last long,” Bucky grumbled.
She pushed him off her lap, “ Stop your theatrics, you’re scaring him.”
“ Listen it’s actually a good idea.”
Morgan and Greg should also be here soon. They were trying to manage the PR about Tony as best as possible. They had wanted Howard to stay with Tony. As much as they were annoying Howard had to admit that they were good brothers.
With the way Steve was acting…Tony swore the omega was actually asking for something else…
The bigger teen beside him was wearing a white form fitting tonk top, that showed off a bit of the blond’s abs. He had topped it with a denim jacket, paired with some denim pants and light blue sneaker. Sunglasses and cap not forgotten as he glanced down at Tony’s side with a smile. The blond immediately got a few unwanted attentions from the park as they past people by. Tony felt like shrinking beside the other teen as Steve must of probably looked like a super model, while he probably looked like Steve’s tiny chihuahua.
“Your not seriously gonna just leave me here all alone are you? You know how i feel sleeping alone...” Bucky had said in a soft, embarrassed voice that made Tony bite his lower lip at almost forgetting Bucky hated being alone. He had grown up with a few siblings and so always didn’t feel comfortable when he was left alone on his own. In a way Tony could understand him as he decided to lay his head against the other’s chest as he settled himself comfortable on top of Bucky, Smiling as he felt really warm pressed against the other cozily.
Tony moaned and whimpered from oversensitivity, and clamped around Steve like a vise as Steve moved inside of him. Steve knew he wouldn't last long that way, and within a few moments his own climax came like a relief, nearly wrung out of Steve in a slow, sweeping unwind. Steve stifled a noise of his own in response and buried his face in the crook of Tony's neck, while Tony sagged against him, tired and utterly spent.
Steve pauses, lifting his head to level Tony with a look. "
“Only two left,” Steve said.
"A friend of mine would say you've got very good taste," Natasha said, looking amused.
"You can't think it's Tony," Steve protests.
Tony blinked at the sudden stop, and remembered he had bothered neither to put on any clothes, nor to get under the covers. Trust Steve to have been balls deep in a guy, but still act like he had never unexpectedly seen a naked man before.
Tony was silent for a moment. "And your plane went down when you were ..."
(the animated one, of course).
"Dr. Sternberg!" Steve surges to his feet, surprising the doctor into lurching back. "The cure!"
Banner reaches out and takes the vial from Steve's hands. "Well," he says with a good natured quirk of his lips. "Let's see what we can do."
Tony was the one to walk them back toward his desk, keeping Steve bent over uncomfortably for the sake of continuing to kiss. Steve didn't mind, too busy getting his hand down Tony's pants, stroking him the rest of the way to hardness - though, if Tony was being honest with himself, he'd have to admit the excitement started in around the time Steve stepped into his office earlier.
Madriporean peacekeeping is an odd beast, with the authorities of the largely corrupt nation content to overlook things until they become an inconvenience or a burden. The attention drawn to the conference is certainly something they would like to prevent becoming any kind of international incident, so it's little surprise when they begin to evacuate the premises.
“Well,” Tony said, a laugh in his voice, “last time we saw each other, I hadn’t done time as the Herald of Galactus, either.”
“I know,” Steve admitted. “I think I should be better at it - with the nature of what we do, I should be better at accepting the reality of ... of what’s possible. But it’s hard to be objective when you ... when you care for someone.”
Tony, on the other hand, was pretty noisy when he didn’t put his mind to being quiet - and why was there any reason to be quiet in his own home? - and he did shout Steve’s name when he came, spilling out messily between their bodies.
