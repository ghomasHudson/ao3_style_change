“But, you’re right,” Tony interrupted him, clenching his fists. “I won’t try to start something between us. What’s dead is dead. There’s no changing that. I will move on.”
“Why are they doing that?” Peter whispered to Bucky, drawing Steve back to the situation. Bucky affectionately rubbed the top of Peter’s head as Steve and Tony separated.
He’d changed out of his stiff uniform the night before so he didn’t have to throw anything on to protect his clothes from the bacon grease stains. He may have hung his dress uniform up nicely but his current clothing consisted of boxers and an undershirt. He’d changed enough times in front of the Avengers into his Captain America uniform though that his undressed state did not really bother him. He grinned to himself as he realized this was just another sign of him belonging with these people..his family.
With a shaking voice, Tony said, “You’re in the future, Cap…” He met Steve’s eyes and was momentarily stunned by the emotion within before he continued, “You can stop pinching me and start kissing me you jerk.”
Steve was standing in front of the TV with a hard expression as he watched the news coverage about Peter unfold. Tony hung up his cell and wrapped his arms around his husband’s waist. He quickly relayed to him his conversation with Peter and his plans to fly out to him.
The doctors worked on him for about 30 minutes. Steve was silent throughout it. The last bullet to be removed was buried in his femur and its extraction was so painful he thought he might blackout. It was a blessed distraction from his warring thoughts.
Ms. Potts eyes searched Steve’s face and Steve could not but help feel sad for Tony. Was that true? Was he really unable to connect to people and make friends? He was such a good guy…
“Maybe you should ask him how he feels about it?” Peter countered, “He’s done press junkits before and is used to dealing with the paparazzi. It might get worse but I think he could handle it.”
Steve pulled him into a tight but gentle embrace and wetly gasped, “Why are you apologizing? You’re the one who’s –who’s –.”
“Is it really my home? I thought
He wanted to be with Steve if this was the end…but it also meant Steve would return to the dreamworld with him and be in pain.
Steve was pulling on his pants but grinned and pressed another kiss onto Tony's cheek.
Thor acted without prompting and swooped down upon the Goblin. The Thunder God moved as quick as lightening and struck the Goblin across the head with his mighty hammer. The Goblin was large and strong but it was no match for Mjölnir. It was hit clear across the room and its grip grew lax as it flew and he dropped Tony.
He distantly heard Peter scream out to his father and Fury command his men to attack but…
Feeling awkward, Peter asked, “Can I help you with something?”
day.”
Steve smiled happily at his friend, lover, and the man who was mutually in love with and caressed the side of Tony’s face. Gazing into his warm eyes, Steve whispered, “And I love you, Tony.”
Tony smirked at Bucky and then grasped Steve’s shoulder as he said, “I’m going to get some food, I’ll be right back.”
Steve spared one last small smile to Bucky and Natasha and then let his fiancé pull him away.
“Well, since it occupies the top four floors, I’d like to think of it more as a penthouse than an apartment,” Tony stated, leaning against one of the support pillars. He couldn’t help but smirk as he added, “Or we can call it home, if you’d like?”
Steve smirked and said, “Who do you think sent me down here?”
Tony pushed himself out of Steve’s arms and sat up, awkwardly rubbing the back of his neck.
The team laughed and Tony clapped Eddie’s shoulder, saying, “I’ll give you an honorary participation badge. How does that sound?”
They reentered the building. The note that Steve had ripped off the wall was still on the ground and they stepped over it. Natasha only spared the paper a glance.
Tony threw himself into his work and would go days without sleeping. But, even in the dreamscape, he’d keep working, drawing out plans or discussing weapons or their history with Steve. Steve always lectured him on getting proper sleep but Tony seemed to enjoy being “babied” and would smile joyfully at Steve whenever he did it.
His soulmate replied incoherently, mocking speech and chewing on his fingertips but obviously portraying joy.
Tony’s eyes widened in horror and he spun around, following Steve’s eyes.
“Direct away,” he replied to the AI and nodded to his reflection before stepping out of the room.
“Take Peter now!” Steve yelled, tearing Peter off him. His shirt tore but he did not notice as Ross came running toward them. He shoved Peter into Tony’s arms and screamed, “RUN!”
They were all over each other and the dozen or so feet to Tony’s room and bed took thrice as long to get to. They mostly rolled over the walls kissing and running their hands over each other. Steve had only managed to unbutton Tony’s jeans by the time they reached his bedroom.
“…Stepan.”
Once inside, he leaned Tony against the granite counter and turned on the shower. He adjusted it accordingly then tested it to make sure it was fine. Satisfied with the water, Steve turned back to Tony.
He dreamed of terror, blood, gore, and his lover’s death.
Bruce inhaled deeply through his nose and slowly stated, “I think…I need to be excused…”
“Oh, my God,” Steve gasped, looking down at the wounds in his soulmate’s chest with renewed horror.
“’It’s nothing’ says the man making goo-goo eyes at the man of his dreams who he just so happened to walk off into the woods alone with today
“You okay?” Tony murmured, cupping the back of Steve’s neck.
Eddie rounded the counter and sat himself opposite Peter, putting the beaker between them. He stated, “Then we’ll just have to find out!”
Tony was smirking as if he was reading Steve’s mind. Slowly playing with and undoing the top buttons of his shirt, Tony murmured, “Jarvis, lockdown the room.”
“No,” he gasped, his voice breaking.
Bucky dropped his head, his hair obscuring his face, and he nodded again.
Tony’s grin grew larger and he said, “Me too.”
Wade’s internal clock was pretty good but he double checked the digital clock at Peter’s bedside and confirmed, “It is almost noon…”
“Stable!” Eddie hissed excitedly.
He confirmed that Bucky was alive and was the agent SHIELD called the Winter Soldier. He knew they would all look online later at the SHIELD released records about the Winter Solider but he briefly explained what happened to Bucky, hoping everyone would understand his old friend was not in control.
Peter slid out of the car and from Wade’s touch as he said, “Okay, cool! Let’s go upstairs.”
He didn’t want to lose this.
Did the others begin to suspect? Were they wondering why Tony did not act like a typical solider? Or did they attribute it to the eccentric nature usually found in the 107th mechanics?
On that same shelf were a few books his father had published and Tony’s eyes almost ran over them went he suddenly noted an old leather bound journal strangely inserted in the middle of the books. Tony pulled it out and recognized it as one of the ones his father always used to write notes in. He also remembered the countless occasions his dad had berated him for touching them.
“This is the best course of action,” Jarvis stated from the StarkPhone in his pocket.
“Yes, Sir, he will be with you in another twenty seconds. Master Rogers ha –.”
“I’ll…I’ll hang your suit on the door,” Steve said and clipped the hanger on the outer doorknob.
Dad would not let him go and he doubted any of the other Avengers would either. But…Peter gripped the dog-tag tightly – but there was still someone who might be willing to help…
(See the end of the chapter for
After that second had passed, Venom made his move.
If there was a loud noise, Tony might come to investigate.
. I know exactly what he can do…” She shook her head and then whispered, “I will not let him do that again.” Her gaze spanned the entire group and she added, “To any of us.”
The civilians screamed and began to run away. The Avengers ran forward against the tide, Peter included.
His words trailed off as he stared at the small trail of white smoke beginning to rise from Tony’s chest in the parting of his shirt. Everyone else’s eyes focused on the smoke, except for Steve. As soon as he saw the smoke and he looked to Tony.
And poor Maria…Tony was clearly going to be badly hurt when he first got the reactor and his wife was going to be devastated by every little scar and hurt Tony suffered.
Sorry for the long wait but here's another angsty chapter!
Tony sighed happily and murmured, “I’m already counting down the days to crystal clear waters and white sand beaches…”
And she did the same of him.
Steve roughly jerked the man to his feet and hissed, “Shut up.”
The Goblin just – he just -.
Steve had to swallow down his exclamation of joy. He was alive! He was alive and in the same era as his soulmate!! Barely, holding back his smile, Steve asked, “Where can I find Tony Stark’s Tower?”
"I recently transferred over," Tony replied with a shrug. "I even got myself somewhat groomed last night so I probably look vastly different too." Tony rubbed his bare chin and grinned at Steve.
Wade’s spine tingled as he remembered the last time Peter had taken a shower and Wade had joined him. As Peter slipped out of the bed, Wade shadowed him and playfully said, “I’ll join you!”
“Lucky you,” Steve teased.
“My mate was the reason I deflected to SHIELD in the first place. Our masters had killed him when he refused to fight for them anymore,” Natasha replied in a small voice. She was still leaning into his side so he could not see her face as she informed him, “SHIELD doesn’t want anyone to know he existed. He was Russia’s ‘Winter Soldier’ and he was a super soldier like you.”
“You always overthink things,” Steve murmured. He lifted his face from the flesh of Tony’s neck and lay his head on his shoulder as he rolled his eyes.
“Peter…” Steve whispered, “Our son…he – he said that we told him the story of how we met except…except we never told him how our reunion ended.” Steve pointed to the notebook in Cable’s hands and said, “What if that’s it? What if we always time traveled? What if us ‘changing’ the future was what was always going to happen? What if I was always find this notebook? What if I’m always meant to complete the circle?”
Bucky glanced down at his shoulder, now bare of the red star. He put his hand over it and looked at Tony with a conflicted gaze. Finally, he whispered, “Can I think on it?”
Cap chuckled and his eyes lit up as he looked at Peter. His smile was still warm as eyes moved onto Wade and he instantly stiffened under the Captain’s scrutiny. He stated, “Welcome, Wade.”
Peter tipped back his head and stared at the ceiling. He processed his step-father’s words and finally let himself truthfully say, “Not good…I always knew this was a possibility but now that it’s happening…it’s terrifying…”
Tony knelt beside and gasped, “Beloved, what can I do??”
Because Tony’s countdown time never changed.
“- be the next singing sensation?”
“He’s not slowing down,” Thor hissed urgently and began to spin his hammer for flight.
Tony’s breath caressed his cheek and Tony whispered, “Orders, Captain?”
"Stark Tower is your home. My home is yours," Tony whispered to the floor.
He listened to Steve’s words and those churning emotions began to flip flop faster inside of him.
“Yeah, we watched it all from the ship,” Tony said, as they all broke apart. He exchanged glances with Steve and revealed, “But we also
Mr. Stark??
Pepper testified to the firing of Tyler and the reasons why. She also provided the video evidence of Tyler putting the Avengers’ trash into the trunk of her car that got her fired.
is here.”
Tony chuckled and turned around in Steve’s arms to pressed his erection into Steve’s again. Steve bit down on his lip and Tony asked, “How do you like it?”
Tony spun on his stool and was grinning madly like a fool because he knew what Steve was thinking. He parted his legs so Steve could more easily slide into his arms. Tony released his hand to run both of his hands over Steve’s hips and tugged at Steve’s shirt, untucking it from his slacks. He slid his hands underneath his shirt as Steve carded his fingers through Tony’s hair and drew him into a kiss.
The world twirled around him like the inside of a kaleidoscope and Tony’s voice was fractured and spinning with the images in a grotesque combination of senses.
“H-How did you find us? Weren’t you two in the Middle East?” Steve gasped.
“Well, in the first movie, Ripley thought the alien was dead but it was really in the escape pod with her,” Eddie retorted.
Steve would have done the same.
“I’m surprised I didn’t hear about it! Usually when an American goes missing everyone knows within the minute it happens! And I can’t believe America doesn’t have half its armed forces searching for you already! I will get you the phone! Wait here!”
He spun on his heels and stomped back into the building. His friends looked concerned, but Tony ignored it in favor and stating, “J, contact Coulson. Tell him I
And then the Terminator showed up…
Steve and Tony flew to the helicarrier without exchanging a single word.
“You know that’s not true,” Tony hissed.
, the only movie he could think of at the time that wasn’t a war movie or too violent. Bucky was quiet throughout the movie, but he didn’t look away from the screen either, so Tony interpreted it as the man enjoying it.
They kept it PG-13 and the only action below the waist was by rubbing their hips into each other. Okay…Tony’s hands may have crept down a few times to squeeze Steve’s ass but –
“Powers?” Bruce asked, taken aback. His eyes flickered to Tony uncertainly.
“Nothing that would affect this!” Tony argued.
Steve inhaled sharply and asked, “You never checked in on him in all these years?”
. The man sitting in front of me is a wise, joyful, giving, heroic person. You are someone I have always looked up to. I don’t think you are vain or old or a mess. And I take care of you because I want to. But most importantly, I love you.” He paused to measure Tony’s reaction to his words. He could see the muscles twitching in Tony’s jaw as he clenched his teeth.
The fate of the future was up in the air now.
They were in all three branches of government.
And Tony.
Steve lean forward and pressed his forehead to Tony’s. Tony adjusted his arms, wrapping them around his back and sighed contently as he settled against Steve. Their eyes met and Tony tiredly smiled at him, making Steve’s heart contract.
?” Both Natasha and Bruce gasped for clarification simultaneously. They both looked at each other and then Natasha looked at Steve and Bruce looked at Tony.
“Alright, Avengers, move out!” Steve yelled. He and Tony ran to his lab where Tony’s suit was and Steve’s uniform and shield were. Bruce went to the elevator and was already beginning to look green.
He took off the bandages on his head next and blinked open his left eye. His vision was watery and blurred at first but returned to normal after a few blinks.
“Haha, no,” Peter laughed.
“Yeah, not going to happen,” Tony murmured and dropped down, evading the sudden burst of neon red that exploded from the weapon.
In his lawyers’ office, they came across another check-in desk, however, they did not need to sign in again and were quickly ushered into a conference. They sat at the end of the table and huddled close together. Steve nervously strangled his fingers and stared at the sealed door with an unwavering and hard gaze.
Harry stepped into the room and awkwardly scratched his arm then asked, “How…How’s it going?”
“Hem,” Tony cleared his throat. To Pepper he yelled, “Yes, this is normal.
He heard the blast of air that resonated from the hammer a millisecond before it knocked him off his feet and threw him into the wall behind him. All the glass in the room shattered. The machines and furniture were all thrown away from the hammer and into the walls like Tony. The only reason Steve’s bed did not move was because Thor had gotten a hold of the railing at the foot of the bed with his free hand and held him there. Alarms went off, the unsuspecting people in the affected area screamed, and the lights in the room flickered before everything went dark.
“I shouldn’t have run away,” Tony whispered. “Maybe in another life, I would have sta-.”
Peter relaxed into Wade’s side as a wave of relief washed over him. Everything was starting to finally work out in his life. He may have been outed as Tony Stark’s son but, he had this: his family and Wade. They were the most important people in his life…
“I was right,” Steve chuckled sadly with a forced smile. “When we first started this, I joked about me not changing personally despite forming a relationship with you…but that obviously is the case now, isn’t it?”
As Natasha carried Tony away, Steve heard him begin to wake. Despite the ringing of the alarm, he heard Tony start to moan which quickly evolved as he fully awaked and he began to scream Steve’s name. Steve curled his fingers tightly around the shell of his ears to block out the sound.
He remembered Stepan.
The green beast put up no defense like the other green giant. Devouring him would be easy.
“Oh, my God, you broke him,” Peter laughed. Peter clasped Wade’s cheek and made him look down at him. He stated, “Wade, babe, calm down. It’s just
Wade’s rocking slowed to a stop and then he wiggled against Peter teasingly with a chuckle. Wade murmured against his lips, “Breakfast is served.”
Tony was slumped on the chair next to Steve, nursing a coffee and picking at his single pancake devoid of any syrup. Once the coffee kicked in he would be his usual animated self and start eating in force.
“You’ve been having a lot of those,” Steve murmured with concern. He scooted his chair closer and reached out to run his fingers along Tony’s jaw. “You’ve been getting sleep only a few hours at a time…We can talk to your doctor about getting you something –.”
Tony wished there was some way he could tell them he was alright...
How would Peter react if she walked through the door at that moment? Would he become more traumatized? Would he cry? Or would he yell? Or…worse, would he just stare at her blankly, his mind broken because it could not handle another shock?
Peter stood up straight with his arms slightly flexed at his sides in a loose defense. He agreed, “Yes, it turned out to be a little more defensive than a simple shield.”
This was bad. Tony had barely touched him and hadn’t even kissed the man yet. He already wanted to consume him.
“What do
The sudden thought washed away any and all feelings he had on the matter, except for one. He was bitter by this simple fact.
“We found him in the plane, he’d been frozen in the ice, and, when we started to defrost him, his vitals returned with the warmth. We tried to wake him in a controlled environment but broke out, calling my men ‘Hydra’ and has disappeared into Brooklyn’s underbelly. Do you understand now why I didn’t want Barnes in the room?”
Tony grinned widely and the elevator closed with a light ding behind him as his son stepped into his home and took his first steps into Tony's life.
condition?”
“And we both like blondes!” Tony added with a snicker and all the good humor Peter felt vanished instantly.
Upon his communication, a large piece of Venom broke away from Peter and hit the pole of a yield sign across the street. The sign bent at a ninety degree angle from the impact then Venom squirmed around it for a few seconds until the sign fully broke off.
Because the information he and Jarvis were uncovering was just…
“That’s no way to talk to your father, young man!” Tony mocking yelled.
“Finally,” Tony sighed, “Bring him up.”
Bucky’s brows pinched and he gave him that confused look again.
“What the hell is he doing here, Thor?!” Tony hissed, getting to his feet. Peter grasped Tony’s shirt tightly and stared at his father with obvious concern.
Norman’s eyes focused on the black mass that he originally thought to be his son’s shadow. The answered dawned on him and he smiled.
“Nothing happened,” Bucky whispered monotonously into the glass, speaking for the first time since they entered the car. His gaze did not break away from the window but everyone’s eyes were drawn to him, even Clint’s eyes flickered in the mirror to look at him.
to know why.
Bruce peered sadly up at Steve and Steve saw in his eyes a battle raging within in him. Bruce did not want to tell him. What did Steve have to sacrifice?
Natasha chuckled, “You two are not going anywhere anytime soon.”
“Yes, Cap, it’s a very good thing,” Tony said with a roll of his eyes. He let go of Steve’s hand before Steve could decide what to do with it. Tony paused and scrutinized him for a second before saying, “Well, you could loosen up a little…”
Peter flushed and glanced away from his dad and he replied, “Maybe? I don’t know…I was…I was thinking about spending the night at Wade’s…”
“You like Aunt Tasha?” Peter asked, finally catching on.
The anger melted away and concern flickered across Tony’s expression. He crossed the room, rounding the couch, and sat next to Steve. He grasped Steve’s hand and vehemently stated, “We are together and love each other.
Pepper returned to his side with a mug of coffee. He accepted the mug and peered down at the dark liquid. He remembered telling Steve how he wasn’t a morning person because his spirit lingered with him until he drank a cup of coffee…
Steve could not sleep.
He was on a first named basis with Captain America.
Peter’s breath caught in his throat. Wade wasn’t looking at him and Peter was suddenly reminded of all the fanfiction on the internet starring Spider-Man. His usual romantic interest was usually a certain merc with a mouth.
Steve lightly sighed then kissed the top of his head.
All the players were taking their places.
With his chest still tight from anxiety, Tony stepped into the unit and it closed around him. In his ear, Jarvis stated, “Charge commencing.”
Steve frowned unhappily and Tony’s back. He wanted to reach out and touch him but clenched his hands together instead. Steve dropped his head, focusing on his hands, and spoke from the heart. He whispered, “I don’t want there to be any conflict between us. The future is uncertain and I know I’m to blame but…I’m not afraid of it. I’d sacrifice myself to Hydra a million times over if it meant saving your life. I only got a glimpse of the future thanks to you, but I’d still make those same choices even if I had the complete knowledge of what awaited me. You’re important to me, Tony. I’m sorry I told your father about you but I’m not sorry for trying to help you…”
“Oh…Okay,” Steve replied uneasily.
Venom slowly stalked up to him and the green beast murmured approvingly, “Yes, come, come to my loving arms, son. I will feed you. I will take care of you. Then, together, we shall destroy all of those who have wronged me.”
“Rogers,” she replied.
“Anti-gravitational boots!” Tony quickly stated. “I tested them out last week!”
and his mind immediately imagined what they would do if it were true…He was hard as a rock within the first five minutes of laying down and he refused to touch himself as it reminded him of Tyler.
“…It may be,” Tony retorted. “But it brings me one step closer to easy mobility and freedom.”
Peter looked up at him curiously and asked, “Wha awe you doin’?”
“…Your Pops just felt like dancing,” Bucky explained to the little boy. Peter and Harry exchanged confused glances then shrugged. They went back into the living room and started playing again. Bucky continued, “I think Steve is right about Natasha hitting me. She will punch me before I get that close. Dancing is out.”
The Avengers exchanged confused glances and Clint gasped what they were all thinking, “What the fuck?”
Peter finished his food and then cleaned out the bowl in the sink.
“I’m looking into apartments in Brooklyn right now,” Steve stated. He and Peter were currently staying in a nearby hotel. Steve was uncomfortable returning to the bugged apartment SHIELD had given him. It was hard finding a place now that he was so well known but now that he had a child to care for he had to limit his search further. Steve murmured, “I just haven't found one yet.”
Peter bit down on the thumb and sucked on it lightly, making Wade groan again. He began to rock faster against Peter and thrust down harder. Wade gasped, “Your eyes are swallowing me whole.”
“You and me both,” Tony sighed. He tugged on Steve’s hand and murmured, “C’mon, Steve.”
Jarvis nodded and stated, “I estimate I will have a remaining 5 hours of charge if no events happen that force me to use more energy.”
Peter went to the lab again, leaving Steve and Tony alone with clear schedules thanks to their canceled honeymoon and nothing to do… except, well… each other.
Steve waved to Peter but went to Bucky first and quickly repeated the terms Coulson told him. Bucky wordlessly nodded and made no other comment so Steve had to ask, “Can you do it, Buck?”
“Alright, Pep,” Tony announced, his voice a little higher. “Good talking to you.”
Tony laughed, his eyes crinkling at the edges as he did, and he put his phone back into his pocket. He pulled on Steve’s hand and they went over to the empty spot on the couch. One by one, the others told them some of the more amusing things the media had come up with about their relationship. It was entertaining, sometimes it was alarming, and a lot of it was ridiculous.
“No,” Steve instantly spat.
Peter replied, “Spidey will just start to swing out of the Tower until the press calms down. It isn’t that much of a life changer…though Spidey and Deadpool probably shouldn’t have any more rooftop dates.”
Silence blanketed the table and Steve tensed, waiting for Natasha’s explosive anger. Steve stared tensely at her but her face was blank, revealing nothing. She stared at the flowers and her lips thinned.
you…”
Peter closed his eyes, expecting oblivion to take him any second.
It was not Tony himself who confirmed his presence but Iron Man… well, Iron
The two men exchanged credulous looks then the doctor pulled another small device from his pocket. It was rectangular like the SatPhone but sleeker. He tapped at its smooth screen and it lit up. He said, “We do not get newspapers up here but I do have a calendar on my phone.” He held it out to Steve and asked, “Is this proof enough?”
Steve nodded and said, “He has my strength.”
“S’Alright,” Tony murmured, his hazel eyes found Steve’s blue and Steve suddenly realized how close he stood to Tony. He looked down and flushed when he saw he had automatically place himself between Tony’s legs and he’d even placed his other hand on Tony’s opposite hip.
Steve nodded and he cupped Tony’s face as he agreed, “Let’s find our son.”
just as kind a person as you are, Steve…”
“Yes, he and Mr. Wilson are currently eating in your private kitchen,” Friday stated.
“When you suggested this farce, I was under the impression that we would actually put some thought into this,” Bucky grumbled.
Tony celebrated Steve’s return with a mini festivity and brought out all of Steve’s favorite foods. They talked and laughed all night long. Neither strayed too far from the other’s side and they were almost always in contact as if both of them were afraid to lose the other again. They watched Steve’s favorite movies until they both passed out on the couch, late into the night.
“It is not 1945, Mr. Carter,” the doctor explained, turning on the machine and it hummed to life. “It is the 6
Peter rolled his eyes but went back to the group event to see who was invited. He always talked to his dad about his life so he saw the usual suspects on the list like MJ, Betty, and Ned. The interns were invited too and the Avengers of course. His dad had used their SHIELD run Facebook pages for the invites so Coulson was probably shaking his head at it.
“Did you check the lab for clues?” Peter interjected. Steve and Tony glanced through the holograms to his son. Peter was sitting on the end of the couch, kicking his feet lightly against the bottom of the couch. Peter explained, “It’s how they do it on Scooby-Doo.”
He put up a few posters, had a closet with clothes, a desk with a computer and notes from the lab scattered throughout. It had been designed by professionals before he moved in and relics from the designer’s flair could be seen in the rug, the random portrait of a close up of lizard scales, and the modern headboard for his bed. It was his home away from home but…it currently felt confining.
“Almost there, Dad,”  Tony replied. “Almost there…”
“Natasha?” Clint hissed. The Avengers watched her with shocked expressions. None of them had ever seen her so compromised. They didn’t know James was the Winter Soldier. They didn’t know this man was her soulmate, back from the dead.
swallowed him. He demanded, “What happened?”
Tony stopped his pacing and fell back onto Steve’s queen sized mattress. He placed his hand over his arc reactor as if to stifle his frantic heart beneath.
He left the door unlocked so he entered the apartment without any hassle. He closed the door and fell back against it, too shell-shocked to venture any further.
“I expect you to be nice and ready for me when I get back,
Peter’s knife slipped, spreading marmalade onto his finger. He glanced from his aunt to Steve to Wade and back to May. He looked back at his toast and slowly continued spreading the jam before he continued.
“Usually they only notice me at my worst,” Tony said with a sigh. He picked up one hologram with a smirk and then threw it at Steve, saying, “I like this one.”
“How are you doing, Bucky?” Steve asked cautiously.
“How do you want to do this?” Peter questioned, “Do you want to carry me? Or should I sit on your back?”
“Pete, you knew the moment I got my period,” MJ deadpanned. “We share everything with each other.”
He just couldn’t see Tony. The thought made him sad, but he had to be strong for Tony’s sake.
"My shield?" Steve gasped.
Pepper hit the button in front of her and the enormous reactor in front of them started to shoot off lightening and rumbled.
With his newly discovered and unexpected frame of mind, Tony wasn’t sure how he was going to react to his lover. He still wasn’t sure how he was going to handle his scheduled death. He pushed it out of the forefront of his mind but it was still lurking in the background.
It had happened. The incident was no dream. Why it did, he could not say, but Tony had kissed him.
,” Tony corrected him with a lecherous grin which made Steve’s flush deepen. Tony sat up, gritting his teeth as his own erection begged for release. He turned to Steve and suggested, “You probably want to jump in the pool to clean that off of you before it dries.”
“Should I bring one of my robots to the club?? Do you think they'll let me bring it in!? I bet I can sneak it in…Or maybe create one small enough to hide in my backpack. Chicks dig tiny robots, right?”
Steve should have known that was going to be Tony’s response. He was bold and forthcoming as ever and it made Steve smile at the coals.
“Let’s jump in the shower and then get down there before he burns the place down,” Steve suggested.
Or maybe it was the fact that he was clearly upset. She probably assumed it had something to do with the role she played in the deception about his parentage and it made Peter feel like an ass for the way he responded to her.
{He was upset that his relation to his father was
Norman sat at a café on the beach, sipping his cappuccino and watched the people walking by on the shore with an amused grin. The naïve fools had no idea the knowledge he possessed. They still lived in a black and white world where the headlines were mostly about celebrity gossip and not the latest alien invasion or super-powered mishap. Iron Man hadn’t even officially taken the stage yet…not that he was going to…
Peter and Harry came over and stared curiously at them. Steve’s flush deepened with the extra audience.
He turned back to Tony and saw his boyfriend staring at the box in his hands with an ashen expression.
“I don’t know how to act around him either.”
“Tony, this is a little shocking to hear about to say in the least,” Bruce gasped. “And… Nineteen years? All this time?”
“Yes,” Steve gasped, his voice hasher with the danger of joyous tears threating to spill. He remembered! Bucky remembered his name!
“I concur,” Jarvis agreed. “I suggest putting the suit to sleep until you need it to return to the future.”
Next Time, Ch. 10: New Friends, Spandex, and a Dash of Jealousy
Very little cloth lay between them and it was dizzyingly arousing knowledge. Peter bit down on his lip to keep from groaning as Wade’s hard length pressed against Peter’s own softened one…not that it was going to stay soft for very long…
“I know you don’t,” Steve whispered as he rubbed his back. Peter shook in his grasp and Steve felt totally helpless.
“I’ll fly,” he replied. “I can give you a lift.”
Peter crossed his arms over his chest and returned to glaring at the bed.
Tony turned to Steve, his heart still racing, and felt immediate relief when he saw his soulmate.
. Steve mumbled, “We’ve been more than friends for the last week…”
Peter retaliated by dragging his fingers over Wade’s chest until he hooked his hand on Wade’s neck. He asked with a sultry undertone, “Should I be?”
Anndddd now that song is stuck in my head. You can watch the music video for Queen's The Show Must Go On
Happy pulled up in Ben’s car and parked it in front of them.
“Forgive him, he’s only on his third cup of coffee,” Ms. Potts stated sarcastically.
No matter where he ended up... whether it was in Ultron’s clutches or at the Tower…
Pepper stepped away to rejoin the lawyers. With her gone, Steve came back to his side and lightly grasped his forearm.
this.”
No, he was asking how they were going to live on without him and – and…
Peter stood in front the lab door for several minutes as his nerves battled with his bravery.
“I went to you because Jarvis told me you were having a panic attack! Calling the vultures was the furthest thing from my mind! I only wanted to help you!” Tony yelled back, coming within inches of his face.
“Determination and fortitude,” Wade replied in a serious voice. Peter laughed and began to pull away some blankets.
He smiled sadly and cocked his gun, pressing the barrel to her forehead. He whispered, “I love you too, Nat.”
Wade whispered, “You're back…”
Iron Man shrugged and replied, “When SHIELD found you, they realized you weren’t dead and brought you back. For what ends, I don’t know.”
“What is it?” Steve asked unable to take not knowing anymore. Tony’s face went white and Bucky and Natasha laughed. Steve was instantly confused. Wasn’t Tony’s health at risk? Why were they laughing?
When they returned to the dreamworld, Steve was still on the verge of losing everything but Tony looked…fine. He was tired and the glow was back in his chest but he’d clearly been through the ringer.
Bruce brushed past Steve as he rushed forward. He excitedly grasped Mary’s arm and said, “
She raised her eyebrows in silent question.
“Fine, I promise,” Tony agreed hurriedly. “Who is it?”
Cable was grumbling to himself again as he sat back down at his desk with a bag of SunChips. Steve lay down on the bed and pulled the photo from the future out of his pocket. He stared at it for a long time…because, this, this was what he was striving for…
“I’m Agent Romanoff,” she said, nodding to Tony in a way of greeting. “You can call me Natasha.”
Bruce jumped to his feet and gasped, “No, Tony wai—!”
The ideal image of the American male is heterosexual after all… not to mention Peter was handsome so he was expected to date someone equally beautiful…
“Fuck,” Tony groaned, tucking his head against Steve’s neck and dropping his arm across his chest as he snuggled in. “That was good.”
They were the only two who would have known anything about the Goblin.
“I will announce my presence next time,” Bucky stated, nodding his chin.
As a man surrounded by technology, Tony was used to immediate results so it was no surprise he was not too happy when all his PIs were able to amass was that Solo and Chewie were good friends and squat buddies that patrolled the city in an uneven pattern.
Tony pulled at the belt to his robe until he completely removed it from Steve’s robe. Steve stood still as the robe shifted but it remained in relatively the same position thanks to his damp skin. Tony snapped back the belt and threw it somewhere behind him. Steve did not see where it landed. He was drawn into Tony’s gaze and was locked in. He couldn’t look away from Tony’s voracious gaze.
would
“What are you going to do?” Steve asked breathlessly, “Charge me? In the middle of the close corridors of a waiting room? Do you realize how many people can get hurt?
Tony put his hands on his head as Steve leaned in and began to wrap the bandages around his body. Every time he wound the bandages around Tony’s back they came into an indirect hug. This close to the man, Tony was able to distinguish his personal scent of soft soap and tough leather. He noted that this close Steve just looked younger. His face was clearer, his eyes bluer, and his hair less perfect. It just made him more human and less the fictional superhero Tony had grown up with.
He shook his head to knock the thoughts out of his mind. It was clearly a misunderstanding and now it was all cleared up. There was no need to keep thinking on it.
“No, but I am big on making my boyfriend happy,” Tony countered. Steve’s grin expanded into its happy smile again and Tony’s heart fluttered happily.
Bucky groaned, “I thought it’d be easier in this era with you two.”
did Bucky have to die with him? And
Peter pushed Wade off him and growled, “What are you talking about?!”
“Y-You almost died again,” Steve gasped.
Tony and Pepper had planned out who’s going and when all before lunch. Nothing could be approved without Peter’s say-so and, according to Friday, Peter was out as Spidey. He placed an alert to be notified when his son returned and went down to his lab.
He paused before the front door and lifted his hand to knock but paused again before rapping on the hard wood.
Peter was fine. He was back to sleeping and Wade was resting beside him, sitting in an armchair beside Peter’s bed. His head was nestled in the crossing of his arms on the bed and Peter’s hand rested on top of one of his biceps.
“Hm?”
He had to wait for the elevator since his pops had used it to go after his uncle…He paused in the line of thinking and corrected himself. Pops had used the elevator to go after
Primarily, its timer counts down to the moment soulmates first make eye contact. If their eyes don’t meet, then the timer will not stop or go off. Soulmates can unknowingly be in communication for years before their eyes meet. Some of the top romantic comedies use this prompt in their movies.
Steve flinched and his stomach clenched uncomfortably. He kept his gaze down, unable to meet Tony's eyes. Steve whispered, "...He did not force me. I just... gave in."
way. It reminded him of those sappy romances that he never thought possible. But here stood Steve, flushing madly and smiling at him with that small cute but nervous smile.
He relaxed his hold on Peter and peered down at his son. Peter was hiccupping and tears were still falling from his eyes.
In midair, he caught Pepper then used his own momentum to throw her on the container beside Tony. His feet hovered over the container for a second but since his entire body hovered over the open air he began to fall.
The suit began to close around Tony, but he gasped, “Wait!” The moving pieces froze and a shallowly panting Tony looked at each one of them, even Howard, and then gasped, “Thank you…I won’t forget this.”
"Okay...Okay, punk, I'll pick you up first thing."
“Well now that we found you, Natasha and I will probably go back to following any leads we have on the Mandarin,” Clint speculated.
Wade glared at him, daring him to repeat himself as the others hastily let go. Vision nodded to him and then pushed the end of the broken cord into Venom’s struggling form.
Solo scoffed and sarcastically said, “Alright ‘Steve Rogers’ let’s keep moving before the boys in blue show up and forcibly move us along.” Steve kept his eyes on the tower as they walked away and Solo laughed and added, “Hey! You should ask your friend there for some booze! I hear he has the best in the country!”
Or had he returned to the future? Was he healing? Or did he…die?
By the time the Red Skull returned to one of the last standing Hydra bases, the war was over, Hitler was dead, and Germany as defeated. The Red Skull railed what remained of his forces and began to rebuild. It would take decades to get back to their former strength, but he was a patient man, and he knew if he wanted to continue to be superior, he had to be quiet, else his organization would falter under a powerful country’s might. But that did not mean his organization was weak. He’d pity the man who would ever insinuate such a lie. No, Hydra may have had its head cut off but it was regrowing two more.
“Benefits,” Natasha grinned. “As in no romantic attachments but all the good sex you can get.”
Poor Stevie... first I give him nightmares of losing a friend and then this...
“I…saw the signs. I knew there was something off about Venom but, I did nothing.”
It was estimated it’d take them a month.
Neither of them made a move to do so at first. They both lazily grinned and then Tony bent over him and lightly kissed him.
Peter dropped his face into his hands, not knowing how to proceed. It was all too much at once.
Wade quirked an eyebrow at him and put his hands over Peter’s on his waist to better push into him. Peter was mesmerized by the way Wade’s ab muscles moved and how his panties moved, revealing a little more skin every time he was pressed into Peter. A flush burnished his cheeks as his imagination ran wild and Peter wondered what Wade would have looked like with no clothes on and rocking like this on his cock. Peter licked his lips, suddenly feeling his mouth go dry.
“Cap.” Steve turned back to Coulson and the man explained, “SHIELD was created after your plane went down. Your friends Peggy Carter and Howard Stark were some of its founding members. Our purpose is, and has always been, to protect the country from outside threats.”
Stark frowned at her and reluctantly said, “Yes.”
“Well, I’d like to at least remember saying yes!” Steve countered.
But none of this weirdness, however, could distract Tony from what was most important: Steve.
“Oh, yes,” Tony gasped, Steve wasn’t sure if it was in reply to his statement or the feel of his lips on him.
“We did it,” Tony weakly cheered.
It finally dawned on Steve what Ms. Potts had assumed and blood rushed to his face in embarrassment. He gasped, “I-I’m no flint! Neither of us are!”
Tony would handle getting Bucky.
But he was not expecting...this...
There is a Part 1 to this story, I go over the basics of what happened in the content of Part 2.
‘>:(’ was Wade’s reply so Peter copy and pasted the same face back to him in response.
Eddie nodded. Venom did it. There was nothing more for Eddie…He was back to being his weak self. The power he once had the symbiote was lost to him forever.
“Like I said last night, we need to be in each other’s personal space and touching all the time,” Tony said and elaborated by grasping Steve’s hand. Steve jerked in surprise and his muscles tensed beneath Tony’s grasp.
He sat next to Tony and, after a pause, ironically stated, “I’ve grown so used to its light that I might have some trouble sleeping now…”
“Yes,” Steve replied.
“P-Peter’s fine,” he gasped.
Peter smiled sadly and replied, “I love you too, Dad, and…it’s alright. I knew this was going to happen eventually. If I was given the chance to go back and change the past, I wouldn’t. I rather have you in my life than out of it.”
Tony frowned deeply, surged forward, and grabbed Steve’s face. Tony pulled them together and they shared a second kiss.
Norman’s grin twitched as if he was suppressing laughter and replied, “I don’t see any problem with that.”
SHIELD had a headquarters in Denver and they’d taken the priest there for questioning. After a few threats about calling Fury and noting how grumpy he was due to the lack of sleep he was getting, the agents relented to let Tony speak to the man.
Coulson’s usually stoic face was marred by a slight frown and he murmured, “I will be just outside. Call me if you need me.”
Wade followed them to the outdoor kitchen. The barbeque was already on and Steve lifted the top and turned to them. He stated, “I’ll start now and Tony should be back before we’re done. You two sit! Can I get you anything to drink?”
The article commented on the media speculation that ensued. It was speculated that the resentment between Richard Parker and Tony Stark grew as a result of Parker buying out the biological department of Stark Industries, forever destroying the foothold Stark Industries had in the biological sector.
Steve did exactly what he would’ve done in the past when he needed to get some where far and fast with no cash.
Steve lay immobile and a puddle of blood was growing under him.
Used to Tony’s antics, Steve did not look up from his sketchbook and dryly said, “Sure, Tony.”
No one had ever said that to him before nor flirted so aggressively. Tony was certainly a handful but…he was turning into Steve’s handful. Steve smiled to himself despite the fact it shouldn't happen. He still wasn’t too sure about Tony’s idea but it was a nice thing to imagine.
The 107
“Forget about them,” Venom whispered. “All you need is me. All you need is us…”
They had been leaving the house more and even Natasha was starting to join them. They were small excursions, walking down the road to the fruit vendor selling fresh strawberries off the back of his truck or getting a cup of coffee from the local hipster joint. Bucky liked getting the coffee the most and had gotten into the habit of pulling his hair back into a messy bun. Tony sometimes teased that he was turning into a hipster and Bucky usually scoffed or rolled his eyes at the idea.
“Where did Loki take him?” Natasha hissed.
“You zeroed out?” The jerk asked, grasping the spot on his arm where his soul implant must have been under the sleeves of his long shirt.
She turned on Steve with a snarl, “You choose to become a super soldier. I was a child, only a few years older than Peter, and an orphan! Department X found me and erased who I was and what I was going to be! Were we supposed to have a moment? Was the fact that I am a super soldier too going to make us the best of friends? Were we going to braid each other’s hair and have sleepovers?” She asked cynically.
Coulson reached the counter where Ms. Potts sat and looked down at the visual menagerie of paperwork laid out before him. As usual, it was mostly schematics of the tower and forms that needed Stark’s signature.
Steve offered a hand to Tony and smiled as he asked, “Are you guys alright?”
Marcel gave him a few words of advice and encouragement and then nodded him toward the courtroom. Steve regarded the sealed door warily and then strode forward, leading the lawyers into the court and the eventual turning point of his future.
–,” Tony warned.
Tony stiffened in surprise but, strangely enough, his first thoughts were Steve’s serum was gone and he was tiny again.
Tony pulled the phone away and kept admiring the accidental picture. He stated, “But it captured my favorite part of you!”
Steve’s face split into a wide smile after noting the look. It’d been so long since they had last shared it…
,” Tony elaborated for him to continue.
“Zola’s algorithm is a program! For choosing targets!” Sitwell gasped.
! I just…” Tony gripped Steve’s hand tightly and his shoulders drooped. He whispered, “I thought you were going to die in my arms and ever since you stabilized….” Tony his face into the center of Steve’s chest where his heartbeat was strongest. Tony whispered into his shirt, “One moment I was carrying a tray of zucchinis and feeling like the happiest man on the planet…and the next…Peter was gone and you –
Peter let go of T’Challa as soon as he reached Wade’s side and carded his fingers into Wade's. He confidently stated, “
“…No, we can’t,” he replied and drew away from her. She watched him in shock as he sat up and pushed himself against the wall and away from her.
His eyes spanned over the other pictures. There were a lot of the Avengers, the teammates they had yet to meet. There was one official looking team photo, but most were relaxed. They were all clearly friends. Bucky and Natasha were mixed in there and…Peter.
“It’s not fine!” Tony retorted angrily, “You are in pain! I’m afraid to touch you! Your flesh is charred! I'm afraid if I touch you it might crumble off!”
Clint’s hands shot forward to grasp Tony’s abdomen and put pressure on the hole in his gullet.
“Peter?” Steve he asked breathlessly. Had he escaped too? His heartrate began to pick up as panic set in.
! What turned me into Spider-Man, was made by my father, with his DNA! If anyone, but a relative, used it, it would kill them! Richard Parker is my father,” Peter stated, he looked to Tony and his brows knitted together. He repeated to Tony with venom in his voice, “Richard is my father,
“They want me to build weapons, I refused,” Tony gasped hoarsely but still managed to smile cheekily at Steve.
Steve was originally going to bring it up with Tony but when Tony excused himself to grab Peter’s new toy in his workshop he had called Steve “Captain Handsome.” Now Steve could not think of Tony without remembering the pet name and he automatically blushed furiously.
Steve had been a wreck when they first broke up but now he was a shadow of himself.
“For everything,” Steve retorted, smiling happily at Tony and carding his fingers into his significant other’s hands.
Peter opened his eyes to find Wade watching him and Peter wished he could see his face. He wished his mask was gone too. He felt separated from Wade with these barriers to protect their identities.
“Thanks!” Tony replied and quickly followed her direction to avoid her inquisitive gaze.
Steve let off a whoop. He and Bruce both smiled at each other.
Peter smirked and took a sip of his coffee. The coffee slid down his throat, leaving behind its rich, bitter taste and Peter lingered on the taste as he ran over what he wanted to talk about. The Captain’s last comment was encouraging. He was happy to see he was not a stickler and had some humor. He also didn't seem to hold a grudge even though Peter had made him upset with his prior phone call.
He stared fearfully at Tony.
“Ben?” May gasped.
Thanks for reading! :)
Wade jumped to his feet and Peter caught him as he ran into him. Wade was grinning excitedly and it seemed infectious because Peter copied it. Peter grasped his friend’s arm and pulled him in the direction of the surprise wedding.
“Consuming raw eggs to fix a hangover was an urban myth,” Bruce murmured, pointedly not looking at Steve’s mug, looking a little unwell. Betty rubbed soothingly on Bruce’s back, sparing her mate a pitying look.
“I know, J,” Tony waved off his AI but the suit remained where it was standing, watching Steve and Tony with an unwavering gave.
. My. God,” Bruce gasped. “It that-?”
Natasha was right behind him and she quickly drew him to the stage.
“…You’ve got to be shitting me,” Tony flatly stated.
Peter chuckled, grinning shyly, and he murmured, “My parents are throwing a party for me this Saturday and you’re obviously invited. You’ll come, right?”
Tony inadvertently clutched his chest and gasped, “Listen, it’s Osborne, right? You don’t have to do this. Just give us back the reactor and we’ll return it to the past. I’m sure Fury will take into account your willingness to hand it over when handing you over to the judge.”
“You’re not alone,” Steve reminded him, reaching out to grasp his arm.
“May…I’m fine. You – you should sit down,” Wade murmured, leading her to the nearest sofa. Pictures were splattered all over the living room and Wade kept his head downcast to avoid all the angles of Peter’s once smiling face.
“Oh, no, man, don’t do that,” Tony gasped, sitting up. His eyes were focus on Steve’s waist with a pained expression. He gasped, “It’s human, Steve, don’t torture yourself.”
He clicked on his father’s and began to read.
When Bucky returned, Steve's eyes were with him immediately. He looked strange in white and tugged uneasily at the suit as if he knew the pure white color was not suitable for him.
“Is that my tub?” Tony asked incredulously.
“Nah…Nah, we can talk serious…it’ll make this –
“Nothing,” Bucky supplied.
The Chinese food came and was brought to the community room but neither Tony nor Steve had the energy to move. Bruce also did not go up but that was only because he was too wrapped up in his research to hear Jarvis tell him there was food available.
She started to walk away, and Bucky was right behind her, stating, “I am more than competent.”
“Good morning,” Steve whispered. Tony’s gaze rose to his and his smile grew into that loving smirk of his that he only showed to Steve.
“Are you my soulmate?”
The young woman squeaked as he loomed over her and she pointed out the door. Steve barreled out as his legs shook unsteadily.
“Sorry, your honor, but this dress should have never been put into evidence.” He held the photo out to the medical examiner and asked, “This was the dress Susan Tyler claimed to have been raped in while she was cleaning Captain Rogers’ room?”
he also loved Bucky. He had smothered the feelings when he was younger and never reflected on them much other than that they had existed. But Bucky’s declaration had brought them back out in a driving force.
The acid curdled in Tony’s stomach. What was that assassin going to do with Steve?
Both Tony and Peter froze and Peter asked, “Y-You sure about that?”
Tony rounded the building, rising in the air as he did. On his screen, Jarvis projected the shield’s location on Tony’s screen with a red single dot and Tony murmured, “Zoom in.”
“No, I started to live with you and then started to rag you when it became apparent you do not know how to take care of yourself,” Steve replied.
“Hey, Baby got Back, move over so I can see with my own eyes my stupid ass husband.”
Steve wrapped his arms around himself and fell back against the metal wall. Tears began to drip down his cheeks. He tried to answer Jarvis but his lips were trembling and his throat was so tight that he would only be able to squeak if he tried.
here…I’m sorry if I scared you just now…it was just…shocking to see it again…”
“Well?” Tony implored.
Nonetheless, he was going to survive this. Venom was not going to hurt his son anymore. They accounted for everything and even had SHIELD as backup this time.
“What’s going on?” Clint demanded. The rest of the team would have heard him over the communicator.
are the reason they wiped his mind in the first place because he started to remember
going to fix it?” Steve asked incredulously. He was under the impression Tony was the only one who knew how to use arc reactors.
“Yeah, after the –,” Peter stopped himself. He took a deep breath and then reassessed, “I am not going to reveal the bumpy bit…”
Steve hurried away, trying to get distance between him and the scene. He ran into the bar and collapsed at the counter. Ever since Bucky died, he never wanted a drink to intoxicate more than he did at that moment.
Venom tried to slip away but Tony’s suit was locked onto its genetic code and automatically moved with it.
The thought involuntarily struck him and Steve bit down on his lip. He should not be thinking about this right now. Peter needed all his concentration. That was all that mattered at that moment...but he could not help but feel dishonorable as he buckled Peter in.
He showed Steve to a small guest room and Steve fell unconscious as soon as he hit the mattress. The train was terribly uncomfortable and he was on alert for Hydra so he didn’t get much sleep.
“What?”
Thankfully, the man spoke English, as he replied, “I'm Joe…”
“Yes,” Peter huffed breathlessly. “Yes, you certainly do have an erection and good morning to that – I mean you! Good morning to
Tony replied, “You should get some sleep and I need…to-to process things.”
Marston quirked an eyebrow but rolled with it and joked, “Jeez, Tony, I knew you loved being on my show but I think you’re taking it a little too far…” They and the audience laughed at Marston’s jibe. Marston continued, “Seriously, guys, everybody wants to know…what’s it like in that Tower? Steve, what’s life like with
Steve had originally planned to wear his best clothes and walk around Central Park until he ran into his soulmate. Instead, he was downtown in his new Captain America uniform, fighting a horde of aliens. Civilians were running away and, as Steve fought, in the back of his mind he worried if he’d be able to meet his soulmate in the late afternoon.
Wade was kissing Peter where ever he was able and, while Peter was cupping his face like he was precious gold, he saw something odd on Pete’s wrist.
Tony nodded and the suit closed around him. He turned to the machine and wobblingly walked up to it.
“And..?” Tony pressed, placing his hand on the door and opening it slightly.
The American camp had only two security cameras. One at the hospital where the medications were kept under lock and key and the other was overlooking the docks to watch the comings and goings of the port.
Steve turned and lay himself over Tony. Tony grunted from the weight but Steve sighed contently, “I’m never going to let you go again…”
“Boyfriend,” Tony stated loudly. He, Steve, Natasha, and Clint were in a car Steve had “borrowed” for them. Natasha was driving them back to Sam’s, Clint sat next to her up front, and Tony sat next to Steve in the backseat.
Tony gasped when their lips met as if he were not expecting it. Yet, not a moment later, he hummed encouragingly and dug his fingers into Steve’s scalp to draw him in closer.
Hello all! I’m sorry for the mega hiatus! I took on a second job and then volunteered to plan my friend’s bachelorette party that was taking place in a completely different state and, well, working two jobs on top of being a party planner takes up a lot of time! XD
“Steve,” Tony squeaked, his plea as tiny as he felt.
Wade nodded and said, “Ok, good.”
Steve sighed heavily again and took a sip from the coffee Tony had given him. The coffee was black with none of the milk or creamer he would have preferred but he did not taste the overly strong bitterness. It tasted like nothing and he barely noticed its burning temperature.
Tony grinned, his smile lighting up his face, and said, “Yes! I wish there was a way to make it blacker than black but I just make do with more cups of coffee!”
“I’ve got to,” Steve whispered in reply. He ran his hands over Peter’s brittle cheeks and placed his forehead to Peter’s. Their eyes met, blue meeting blue. Steve’s stare was steady and Peter’s eyes were beginning to water.
Steve chuckled and walked in direction of an exit that would deposit him somewhere in Flatbush. He needed to get out of New York, that was for sure. And he was going to California, there was no question about that either.
Steve looked back to him and, for a moment, it felt like they were the only two in the room. Tony leaned toward him and impossible thoughts ran through his head. Steve looked away and Tony was knocked back into the real world. No, it was not possible. It was just Tony’s imagination running wild again…
Mary placed the crumpled photo on the desk beside the monitor. It unfurled and revealed the smiling faces of her targets. She focused on the boy’s face, so much like her own, and almost felt guilty.
It’d been years since he last saw it but he would recognize it anywhere.
After a pause, Tony tipped Steven’s face toward him to study but Tony found himself being wrenched back instead.
“Bucky!” Steve yelped in warning, reaching out to his friend, but was stopped as he forgot about the cord railing of the boxing ring.
Rogers sat at a table outside the shop wearing the same baseball cap and sunglasses as he had when he had knocked on Peter's door. He had a small cup of coffee with him but he only held it and never once took a drink.
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
Steve chuckled and shook his head. He gave no retort to Jarvis because he heard his son whimper from the bedroom.
The knife was gone but Solo still had a hold on the girl. Tony locked in on both of the man’s arms with his sensors and retorted, “Sorry to disappoint you but I’m an Earthling, born and raised.”
As the hole in his chest was revealed, Peggy was surprisingly the first to curse with Bucky joining her by agreeing, “You’ve got to be fucking kidding me.”
. But there are other times, like with Wade, in which your Dad-Radar narrows too much on somethings…and I’m not the only one you should be apologizing to…” Peter replied gently. Tony nodded in understanding.
He could not break his smile even as Steve kissed him. Their kiss was mostly teeth and Steve made an annoyed noise when Tony didn’t pucker his lips. Tony chuckled, “Sorry, just too overjoyed to stop smiling.”
When the time came for them to part, Peter held Steve around the neck tightly. At first, he feared he might have to forcibly tear Peter off him but Peter let him go with a trembling pout. Steve transferred him to Ben’s arms and Peter automatically grasped the dog-tag on his wrist.
“Perfect,” Tony stated, turning his attention back to the other two. “That leaves us enough time to discuss all of
Peter’s entire life was his family. If Venom denied him access to them then he had nothing. All that remained was Venom and his feedings. Peter cringed at the thought and felt nauseous.
?” Tony hissed, perplexed beyond words. He thought Steve was fine with this?? What was going on??
She tactfully avoided his question but Peter’s head shot up and he gasped, “If this is ‘the worst’ then what else is there??”
Since he’d taken down his tent in the morning, he had absolutely no where to retreat for privacy and he started to crave it as the stares around him grew.
Peggy nodded and patted Tony’s shoulder, saying, “You did good. Now don’t move unless you have to. I’ll send a medic to you as soon as I come across one.”
He paused but Natasha continued to refuse to turn around.
Coulson’s mouth thinned and he replied, “I’ll try but I can’t stop Jarvis from telling him.”
That was right. Cable was a time traveler too and he was wearing the glove again. He must’ve gotten it back from the Goblin! They could go back –
Peter leaned forward and lightly pressed his lips into Wade’s.
“…I know many people have told you that it is not your fault –.” Bruce paused wondering how to phrase this and murmured, “But that isn’t the truth is it?”
His mind was still blown away by the fact that Steve was in fact the mysterious Agent Edwards...but he was also now able to piece together some of what Steve had gone through. He remembered Edwards mourning a lost fiance...and that had been Tony. Not to mention all that time that had passed...
“W-Wade’s here,” Peter gasped.
“What?” Clint gasped.
Steve shook his head and chuckled darkly. Without facing Tony and keeping his stride, he retorted, “That and the photos.”
So…how does one change the future of two men fated to die without changing the future itself?
“I’m not sulking, I’m just distracted,” Tony mumbled to deflect her question.
exhilarating went unsaid.
Tony’s thigh was still pressed into his crotch and he couldn’t really think beyond that. Steve's arms were beginning to shake and he’d barely held himself up for a few minutes. He usually could do hours, no problem, but Tony…Tony made his muscles feel weak and his mind hazy. And then there was also a growing erection Steve could not stop from growing in response to Tony’s leg.
Tony felt a lot of different emotions about his father. He loved him, hated him, idolized him, and reviled him. But he was his father…and he was
Tony grabbed his forearm tightly and pulled on his arm as he gasped in a frightened voice, “
The first half of the month no one saw Steve or Tony so the public did not know of the sad period Steve went through but the second half of that month was spent out with them in the public eye and they showed everyone they were together, happy, and confident. Their relationship quickly became so mainstream that the paparazzi were asking them more questions about the coming trial instead of their liaison.
“I am a master at Junior Prom dance style but if you want to learn some actual dance moves like the waltz or whatever then we’re going to have to take a class,” Tony stated.
Ok, J used “sir.” That was more normal and Tony’s tense shoulders loosened a little more slightly.
Wade went to Peter’s side and lightly touched his shoulder. Peter flinched back and Venom acted immediately, turning its tendrils into sharp points and skewering themselves into Wade. Wade’s entire body jerked back as he was stabbed in multiple points.
It was one less person who needed Steve.
“Buck…” Steve didn’t know where to begin. He made a promise to Tony to keep his secret and protect the future. But this was his best friend, a man he considered his brother… He’d never lied to Bucky before which was why Bucky was so concerned right now. He knew Steve’s deepest and darkest secrets, especially the one he thought Steve had let slip.
“It’s real,” Steve whispered in assurance. He took one of Tony’s hands and placed it over Steve’s chest, above his heart. Tony could feel the warmth of Steve’s body, the rise and fall of his chest as he breathed, and the strong pulse of his heartbeat. These small details were never there in the dream world unless one of them focused on it.
Everything was perfect.
“I…I don’t know how you expect me to help you?” Steve murmured.
“Right here!” Peter gasped, pointing triumphantly to the spot where Tony had helped him screw back in some larger gears.
The prickling at the base of his spine had evolved into a stabbing fear that cut its way into his gut. With a racing heart, he ran back into the main room and quickly scanned the room, hoping Peter had crawled under the coffee table or had been hidden by some balloons but his son was nowhere to be seen.
,” Peter moaned.
Bruce’s gift was a few shirts all with the Hulk and the scientist joked, “Now he can wear more than just Iron Man merchandise.”
Eddie and Peter excitedly pulled the ‘goo’ out of the fridge. They both exchanged glances and Eddie asked the obvious, “Who’s going to test it first?”
Tony tiredly nodded to her and shivered as he was hit by a light breeze. He was laying down on his back to give Pepper better access to his chest and Pepper put the spare arc reactor down beside him as she knelt beside him. She hissed, “Wh-Where do I start??”
Tony crossed his arms over his chest and stubbornly stated, “The future is not written in stone. Despite all our precautions, my presence is changing it as we speak. For all we know, it’s already changed. Maybe when I get back to the future, Captain Steve Rogers will be the first man in line to marry his partner when it gets legalized in New York.”
Bucky kept pushing him until Steve broke and exclaimed he didn’t like dames.
Tony shifted his arm and went to wrap it around Steve. However, the body was smaller…too small to be Steve. Instead of the expanse of Steve’s back Tony’s arm moved drastically inward and came into contact with a tiny body and boney shoulders.
Steve never got a break with his position. He made his rounds, talking to the leaders of the various squads or individual soldiers. He was checking in on their progress but, was mainly checking on moral. The men seemed to mostly be in good spirits, they had taken down another Hydra base after all, but he made sure to sit down with the few that were in bad ways. Casualties happened. It was the way of war, but that didn’t mean the soldiers had to easily accept it.
Uncle Bucky also looked disturbed by the silence but he running until Aunt Tasha stated something grimly in Russian. She did not use English, knowing Peter might overhear, but Peter could clearly make out Pops’ name in her message. Uncle Bucky collapsed upon her message and they skid several feet across the linoleum floor.
With his lips wobbling, Wade couldn’t help but agree. He’d never felt more relieved or happier in his entire life.
An alien ship must’ve crashed into one corner because the entire north side of the building was caved in and all of the windows were blown out. Most of the kitchen was gone and looked like it had been on fire at one point.
“Yes, really,” Peter replied and did so somewhat cheekily too.
This was the man he was going to spend the rest of his life with…who loved Steve as much as Steve loved him. He was a romantic, that would jump at the chance to woo him even after he’d won him over…Before meeting Tony, he’d never thought this possible…that’d he would be so blessed.
“He did neither,” Steve attested.
Tony put his hand over the empty hole in his chest as his emotions twisted and turned uneasily within him. He didn’t want to believe it…it shouldn’t be so easy.
Natasha instantly drew her pistol and shot at the ceiling. Fire was returned and Clint pushed Steve aside to avoid being hit by the bullets. Natasha did the same for the men in the front and kept firing until she emptied her clip.
! Oh my God, no!” Peter laughed. The image of the blonde with a boner nonetheless came to mind and Peter's laughing increased and he had to roll onto his side to properly breathe.
Tony grunted from the unsuspecting impact and sleepily gasped, “Wha – Wha’s goin’ on?”
I will not be posting a chapter title this time because I don't know if I will be able to get it all into one chapter! XD
Steve read the article and quickly mastered the ability to move the screen down. He was acutely aware as Tony watched him as he did. He shifted in his seat and may have straightened his back slightly with the knowledge.
Tony didn’t seem ready to settle either as he stared at Steve with a thoughtful expression.
Hundreds of photos were taken that day but a single photo stood out among them all and would become one of the most iconic photos of the year.
No one had entered the plane upon its discovery. They waited on the diagnostics team to do a scan to make sure it was safe. The Red Skull planned to destroy several cities and for all they knew there could have been radioactive materials onboard.
Tony rested his hand beside Steve’s and Steve lightly touched his hand with his pinky. He whispered to Tony, “I missed you today.”
Tony’s eyes focused on the coffee machine and he added, “Make me a double shot too.”
“He did risk the future for his boyfriend, sounds like another brave time traveler I know,” Steve teased, lightly bumping Tony’s side with his elbow.
They had not interacted much during the fight other than Steve giving orders and Tony complying with a dash of sarcasm. Steve kept his anger in check during the fight but he did not reply to Tony’s teases and the older man noticed.
“So are you saying you fucked her and left her to cry herself to sleep?”
Her instructor snarled and he slashed at her, catching her arm with his blade.
“He makes me laugh,” Peter countered, his heart breaking as he had to defend one man he cared about from another he also cared for. “He gets me. He knows both sides to me and he’s been there for me ever since the media found out I was your son! I
“What about last night?” Wade asked, humming into the crook of Peter’s neck.
Peter’s lips upturned into a coy smile against Wade’s lips. The younger man shifted wantonly beneath him and then grasped Wade’s hips before driving his own hips up and pressing their sexes together with repeated thrusts.
Wade lay himself between Peter’s split legs and lightly sang, “Can you feel the love tonight?”
Jarvis opened the door for him, so he landed in the living room, scratching the floor a bit with the rougher landing. Pepper would be thrilled but Tony didn’t even notice as he leapt from his suit and called out, “Steve!?”
“James,” he stated. “My
“…So there are no leads on your end either?” Steve asked.
With his superior strength, Peter barely noticed the weight and agreed with a grin, “Sure.”
“Yeah, it’s about Tony…” Steve sighed. “Howard said he needed a centralized location…him being in the field will make him useless for Tony…”
“I’ll go easier on you next time,” Wade promised, kissing Peter’s neck lightly.
Tony’s head snapped up and he gasped, “I am considered one of the smartest people on Earth, no, strike that! –In the universe! I am one of the smartest people in the universe and am in no way an idiot!”
“That settles it, this is going to be our wedding dan-dance,” Tony stated the last bit uncertainly. Steve stopped and peered down at Tony. It was not a proposal but it was talk of a future they never discussed. He knew many couples did it but they never broached on it before. Steve had never even considered it. He knew that men could get married now but just dating Tony alone was revolutionary to him, marriage was mind-blowing.
She shook her head gravely replied, “It’s not that either, Howard. Do you remember Dr. Erskine’s assistant? That quiet, tall man? He was found dead last week in his home. Apparently, he fell down his stairs and broke his neck.”
Steve.
Steve winced and started, “Natasha –…”
She stared to pace and hissed, “When he shot me, years later, without a flicker of recognition I knew they wiped his mind and I knew there was nothing I could do. His body was there but the man I got to know, the man I loved, was still dead. But it still pissed me off enough to join SHIELD…though I never told them my connection to him or that I used to be the Winter Soldier’s companion, the Shadow Soldier.”
He moved into her apartment under the guise as her soulmate and fiancé but they slept in different rooms and rarely spoke.
The Iron Man suit knelt down to his level and peered with him as he prodded at the device.
“I didn’t,” Tony muttered tersely. “I…I didn’t tell him…He found someone else. I was too late.”
…” Eddie said warily, taking a step back.
“Stand down, Stark. This is all legal. We have a warrant for you and the Captain’s detainment,” Fury stated as he strolled into the room. He was followed by a mass of more agents. Tony pointed his repulsors at Fury and Fury’s lackeys all pointed their guns at Tony.
Peter turned back to his dad with a happy smile, saying, “Yes, swimmingly in fact.”
He kicked off his shoes and fell face first into his mattress. Everything that had been weighing him down seemed to press him even deeper into the bed. Steve sighed heavily and closed his eyes.
“That’s great!” Tony said with a smile.
Once they were inside Steve paused just inside the main room and waited for everyone else to file in. When the door closed and the reporters and protesters’ voices were muffled, Steve released the breath he had been holding in a loud rush of air. Tony placed a hand on his chest and asked with concern, “Are you alright?”
Steve rubbed his face and groaned, he felt like a teenage girl with her first crush. When he was attracted to Bucky, he never went through these kinds of reactions. Then again, he had known Bucky his entire life and Bucky never used pet names like “Captain Handsome.” He knew what to expect with Bucky but Tony was always an enigma.
“Guys? You there?!”
He barely tapped it before it swung open.
When they got home, however, Steve’s heart still had enough in it to break again, because their new home was destroyed.
Many religious organizations claimed it to be a gift from their god or gods and the S.I. Organization did not confirm or deny their statements (a century later it will come to light that certain Norse Gods had a hand in creating the soul implant but that’s another story…).
“Wade.”
"Extra olives and extra dry, so I am better prepared to hear about the person who has Tony Stark tripping over his feet to avoid talking about."
Wade cupped his cheek and murmured, “Whatever you want, baby boy.”
Peter approached Rogers from behind and then wordlessly took the seat across from him.
Tony snorted up his carbonated water and then laughed as Rhodes rolled his eyes. Tony chuckled, “He’s got a point! Venom was totally the alien from
Tony took a step closer to the super soldier and murmured, “Me too…”
Bucky usually enjoyed the time off by scouting out the local villages, seeing if there were any bars open, or a pretty dame looking for a date with an American soldier.
Steve shook his head and looked back to his friend and said, “I’m fine.”
Steve made agreeing noises and nodded when appropriate. He knew he needed to be careful and he knew just how to do so but he listened to Bucky’s advice all the same so Bucky would feel better about Steve leaving.
The darkness was gone and he was back in his bedroom and so very awake. He could tell he was awake by the way his heart hammered wildly against his ribs.
He walked past his aunt and she got to her feet. She reached out to him and he flinched away.
With each weapon, Peter's heart grew heavier and heavier.
Steve nodded and replied, “He’s a stand-up guy.”
Natasha’s fingers dug into his shoulder.
His eyes spanned the room and then landed on the broad shoulders of one Captain Steven Rogers. Tony smirked to himself and walked over to the man. Steve was eating with the rest of the Commandos, sitting in the middle of his collective band of heroes.
When Dum Dum fell into a chair and didn't get up, Tony quickly finished his beer with one last swig and announced, “I'll step in.”
“Good,” Peter said, nodding curtly. He flexed his fists releasing the tension and repeated, “Good.” He spun around and went back to his room.
“That was
Steve stayed silent, not wanting to interrupt Tony. He adjusted Peter in his hold and darkly wondered who had shot at them.
He’d only just told Rhodey about his little side project that morning, after the whole jet plane fiasco, but had the government already known?
Natasha and Wanda were at the bar, mixing drinks and trading secret smirks as they whispered together in Slovenian.
Steve gave quick goodbyes to his newfound Russian friends. He’d only been with them a little over a week but they had helped more than they would ever realize and he was eternally grateful. They surprised him with hugs and kisses to the cheek. He had to conclave his torso in order for them to not feel his shield and no one seemed to have noticed thankfully.
“…If I have to fake a relationship with someone…I think my best friend is the best option, don’t you? No one knows me better,” Steve replied and Tony’s heart clenched a little.
“I wish you had a glass so I could toast to that. Deserts are fucking freezing at night.” Not as cold as, oh, being frozen alive, but still. “Water. On my face.”
"We've just received intel from Steve," Natasha explains when Tony turns to her for translation of Barton's words. "Yesterday, actually, but last night you were..."
"Well," Obie chortled, breaking Howard out of his thoughts. "I have always been the carrot to your stick, old boy, haven't I? Besides, we can't really blame the boy for being born defective. Poor luck of the draw, I say. But if anyone can overcome it, it'll be a Stark."
“I like that you think I went to bed at all,” Tony quips, wondering at the strangely coaxing tone to his voice. “What about you, Cap? This isn’t cramping into your five AM wake up call?”
He throws himself into a room and the door hisses shut behind him. It is dark here, and cold, he's trapped and there is something dangerous out there waiting for him. They've been so stupid, coming out here like this, unprepared. He'll be better, he promises to the God he's not sure hears him anymore, he'll be better if He just helps them survive this.
Steve watches as Wanda runs her hand over Bucky's chamber. "Can you feel him?" he asks her in a near-whisper. "Is he okay?"
"I wish. Harry was
"I guess...I'm in, too," Spider-Man says. "My uncle always told me there's no shame in asking for help. I've...I've hurt people before, because I didn't know what I was doing. I could have hurt that girl," he says, mask rising till the eyes meet Tony's, and Tony wonders if Peter sees Gwen falling at night in his dreams like he sees Rhodey, like he still sees Pepper. "I'm in."
"Three days."
"I'm assuming FRIDAY filled you in," Tony says, dragging a finger across the black marble table top. "She told you I'm heading out."
“Barton,” Barnes said softly, and Clinton took another look at Steven and sighed, stepping aside.
“Oh!” Anthony exclaimed when a cask was brought in for them on orders from the king himself. “A toast!”
"You pushover," Rhodey laughs. "You hate
you get your hands on her."
"You have to be used to that by now."
. The only thing that even compared is when he saw Bucky again, alive, on that road in DC.
He knew, even as he was yelling at Tony, that Tony had just gotten excited like he always did, that half of everything that came out of his mouth was just nonsense, even to Tony himself. Stark talked, everyone knew that. But Steve knew how much Tony just
"That machine," he begins, standing and approaching the window that separates them. T'Challa had offered to let them stay in the same room when they talked this time but Tony wasn't ready for that yet. But Barnes is more - bearable to look at, this time. It's easier to look into his eyes and not see the thing that looked up at him from a tiny screen in a Siberian bunker, blood still dripping from its metal hands. "Was made as a sort of vanity project. Spent millions of dollars building it, but hey, I figure I've done a lot worse to sort out my issues."
T'Challa had fixed him with a steely gaze then. "The Accords allow us to say no. You and your friends were not eager to fight before; I can't imagine that has changed."
“No,” and Steven breathed out a sigh of relief. Anthony was the king’s heir, and so he was kept to the camp, where he was safe. “But you’re not going to have to worry about Anthony’s particular brand of tender care.”
Today was the only day he was ever tempted not to. Steve sighed heavily, not wanting to put this off for one more second. The conversation with the other Stark weighed heavily on him. The fight, which seemed so far away now and so oppressively close at the same time, weighed even heavier.
Tony stared at him, then looked down, pressing a button that would summon his armor. He needed to take some readings on the Time Fog. It was dark now, and Big Steve looked ethereal in the glow of the arc reactor.
And he will do this anyway, all of it, because every bad thing he wants for Barnes, Barnes has already known, and then known worse. There is nothing Tony can do to him, no vengeance he can exact that will surpass what he's already been through. Steve could argue until he was blue in the face that it was HYDRA and Bucky was innocent and Steve would be right, but that would not and could not change the fact that Barnes was the one who did it.
“You know,” he says. “It’s not all gone.” When Steve raises an eyebrow, he gestures out at the city. “New Yorkers are nostalgia-ridden fools, near as I can tell. Never tear anything down. They just built around it. Or on top, more likely, I guess, there’s not just excessive amounts of space here. But they make something new of out it. The old, I mean.”
"Tony-"
Tony's breath catches hard in his throat and he coughs, hard. God, his chest hurts. Bruce lays a cautious hand on his shoulder, rubbing soothingly, before continuing on in the same calm, careful tone. "I know what it's like to see...something like that, Tony. I know what it does to a person. I don't blame you-"
And indeed underneath the cool surface of the stone he could hear his mage’s heart beat proud and true. Steven didn’t know what his face might have shown; Anthony covered his hand with his own and whispered lowly. “For you, my knight.”
, I’ve determined the exact moment intervention is necessary.” She preened when Natasha lifted one impressed eyebrow, even if it wasn’t enough to draw her away from her sandwich. “Too early and Tony gets defensive. The fight will escalate.”
(”Those were my parents,” Tony said, deadly quiet. “That was my family. My history. It had nothing to do with you but you took it anyway. Do you get that, do you understand? They were my parents. Mine. They belonged to me like I did them and you
Vision looks uneasy but nods. "This is the best possible place for Tony. We will be in contact the whole time."
Matt Damon, not
"Stop that. You've spent every moment since you became the Hulk trying to fix yourself. You know DNA backwards and forwards. Maybe you aren't that kind of doctor, Bruce, but you are exactly the person she needs." He can tell Bruce's innate goodness is telling him to say yes but Banner shakes his head.
“No, the first time I asked about me.”
"You sure about this? After everything we've discussed about her-"
" he repeats incredulously. She glowers at him. "Did you just say
The man frowns. "It will be nice to see the backside of him."
"I'm afraid it's not any more exciting than whatever you've read, sir," Natasha finally breaks her silence. "The team had a sharp ideological difference regarding the Accords that was exacerbated by Helmut Zemo's plot to frame the Winter Soldier for the United Nations bombing. We tried to detain the other members at the airport when they attempted to escape. We were unsuccessful due to my letting Captain America leave with the Winter Soldier. The others are now fugitives from the law after breaking out of the Raft."
“Your son is
That small flush of victory only lasts so long. War Machine and Iron Man make it to Oscorp just in time to see the glider burst from one of the top stories, Daredevil pinned between two of its blades and barely hanging on while the green figure ragdolls Spider-Man around.
. His eyes were distant, fixed on a point somewhere over her shoulder.
. "It's not even close to done."
-I will.
"What's a-" She leans forward, squinting slightly as she tries to puzzle out what's on screen. "Tony, I never knew you were so fond of Madlibs."
"Look," she sneers. "It's just insulting, you know? My actions had nothing to do with you. I did what I did because I wanted to do it. So I better not hear about your prostrating yourself in front of Fury begging for mercy for me."
He takes the hand. "Secretary Lukin. Honor's all mine."
Alright, so I'm never going to be a fan of Clint Barton but just so it's clear: Clint is fucking terrified right now. Also, I know in a lot of stories Bruce is understand of Tony's position but like - Bruce is a really angry person and Tony did put too much trust in Ross. That's gonna take some time.
"Sam," Steve says shortly.
Steve nods. "We were honored to have you, Ant Man." He rises and offers a hand that Scott takes with a shaky smile and a weak grip. He exchanges a one armed hug with Sam and turns towards Wanda.
"What are you talking about?"
There are things to be done, of course. He's already called Pepper to arrange for the Stark Foundation to give its customary contribution to aiding the fallout from extra-human affairs. He has a new sample of Terrigenesis to study in the lab. He has a council to meet to discuss how the Avengers will respond. He has even just now gotten off the phone with President Ellis, arranging a phone call between the two of them and Director Glenn Talbot of the ATCU so the Avengers and Not-SHIELD can work together to end this threat and he is sure to get phone calls from the Prime Ministers of Belgium and Britain to work with their secret task forces.
As he talked, he watched the line of the stranger’s spine grow stiffer and stiffer, and, without looking up, the man rocked upright onto his knees, one hand fiddling at the other wrist. “Godammit,” Steve heard him mutter.
it says underneath it in his scrawl.
When they do, Tony sighs. "Well, I'll get right on that, Panther King. In the meantime, this thing with Lang - just let him know his options, okay? I have some things that belong to him that he needs to see. You seem big on choices but I'm pretty sure Team Cap over there doesn't know all of theirs."
Tony's typing blind. "You picked me up out of that bunker, Vision, we both know I'm not okay. Would it -" Jesus, this is hard. "Would it be alright if I told you how not okay I am? We used to talk-" He bites his tongue hard. Vision is not JARVIS.
"Wakanda, of course, will not," Tony says, teasingly, and T'Challa smiles back even if he doesn't dispute this. T'Challa, as much as he tries to work the wise king act, is still young, barely thirty, and still very proud. It would gall him to have anyone but Wakandans protect his country. "Good work, Sir Pounce-a-lot. I owe you."
There's nothing here that can't be fixed.
"I've read the files," Steve says as he sits down next to Dagger. No, wait. They aren't on a mission, and she prefers to be called Tandy. "But explain it to me in your own words. How do you and Cloak work?"
"Fuck, fuck, fuck," Tony chants to himself. "Widow, Panther, fall back to War Machine, lend a hand. Vision stay with me. Spider-Man, do you read?" The crazy man is laughing as Black Widow and Panther retreat.
Is that authorized is your contract?
I'm doing this for Clint. For his family. I won't let anything happen to him.
"Captain Danvers. To what do we owe the pleasure?"
It's a simple operation as they go: taking out a terrorist cell antagonizing a Croatian village. It is nothing the Avengers haven't handled before, but that was before. This is now and Tony - Tony is scared.
He is surprised when T'Challa strides in, holding a very plain envelope in his hands. "Avengers," he greets them cordially. He always calls them that, even after Steve attempted to correct him. T'Challa is an Avenger now himself; maybe he likes the idea of camaraderie.
Tony could say something here, say he's confident that when
. More time, more information, more wits and smarts and strength.
“Come now, Barnes, don’t tell me you were growing tired!”
"Sir." The younger man pushes off the wall and circles his fingers lazily as he begins walking. "After me."
"What?" Tony asks, thrown by the question.
"How do you figure that?"
Tony shrugged. “I’m not saying it’s undeserved, alright, waking up seventy years in the future can’t be fun. But you’re gonna what? Brood and mope on your own and not let anyone help. That sound like a solid plan to you, Cap?”
"No. I don't suppose you do," she says softly. "But I would have tried to make one for you." She did it for Steve, back at the airport. Carved a choice out of the chaos for him and hoped he did good with it. Tony doesn't know if Steve let her down, but he'll try not to.
He shoulders past his father, and with careful hands pieces the brain back together and puts it where it belongs in Barnes' head.
did it," Barnes pushes.
There's nothing here. It's not fair of him, to hold them to ghosts and find them wanting. He should try harder. But the thought of - of making a team out of this, caring for them and having them all ripped away is just -
"What do you want, Barnes? Really," he asks quietly, eyes staying fixed on the wall.
But James Barnes is no wilting CEO. "Is that flattery or accusation?" Tony quips, smoothing down his tie as he takes a seat.
. Does he not count, Kamala?"
"Fury here wants a sit-rep," Tony says to the group, all fake cheer. "Well, post sit-rep. Apparently he was off in Timbuktu during the civil war."
His wife didn't know about his present. Nobody did. Reaching inside his breast pocket, he pulled out the pamphlet and handed it over to Obie, who just barely glanced at it before doing a double-take.
Tony sucks in a sharp breath that makes his already aching chest sting. "Goddammit," he curses, because they both know T'Challa's a liar, that Tony hasn't. He still has so much more to do, so much more to say. "I want to see him before I go. Barnes."
"Maybe they do not know of her crime," Vision postulates, his voice hesitating on the last word.
Rhodey collapses beside him. "If any of you die I will kill you so hard."
"Why is this so important to you?" he asks her, retracting his hardlight shield into its wristband. Rachel aims a confused glance at him.
"How are the new calibrations looking, Bliz kid?" Tony calls from where he's coasting in the air. Rhodey is somewhere up above him in the War Machine and below, Donnie monitors their readouts on a Starkpad while Barton, his wife, Hope, and Vision relax on the roof.
(Also, I just wanted this out, so any mistakes I will correct later.)
That finally gets her to look at him. "You've been talking at me for the last half hour about how shit happens and you have to cope and its the most hypocritical bullshit I've ever heard. You're not
"Everybody loves an underdog," he grits out. Then he explains, more slowly, his plan to use Tiberius to sway a whole world's worth of skeptics and juries and judges (and executioners), to predetermine the outcome of for a trial that, if they do everything right, won't even happen. Barnes' gaze never wavers the entire time. "Your story's already out there, Barnes, if someone wants to dig hard enough. Zemo proved that. Why not tell it your way before it can happen again?"
"Equivocation is no man's friend, Your Highness," Tony warns, straightening up. He gathers up his courage and meets T'Challa's eyes. "I want to tell. I do. But not tonight. I've got to get some sleep. What time are we heading out tomorrow?"
"I already know the answer." He doesn't drop eye contact but something in them goes very dark. "But I want to know."
“In my arms,” Steve mumbles. “Through my fingers…”
"Yeah, suppose that is a bit of a morbid pick, what with the murder," he heard Bucky muse, the blood rushing so fast through his ears the words seemed to come from a great distance.
Another laughed and said, “What do you expect from Tony Stark and
The cut did not really bug him, the lie bugged him. Sadly, he was used to it, however, what really bugged him was that he was going to have to sew up his mask
“Jesus Christ,” he swore loudly as his eyes locked onto Tony’s chest. He stomped over to beside Steve and he demanded of Tony, “What the hell did you do to yourself??”
“We kept it a secret to protect the timeline and discourage anyone from attempting to time travel,” Steve added into the comms.
Natasha’s heart seized in her chest. She wordlessly crossed the room and rounded the body in seconds.
Peter stared desolately at his feet and asked, “Wh-What can we d-do then?”
“You got out of bed, didn’t you?” Tony deflected, dragging himself back to the struggling pair. Wade was impaled but refused to let go and Venom was trying its damnedest to get him off of it.
Bruce must have leapt after him and transformed mid-fall because, as he landed, the ground shook behind him and Hulk roared. Thor had been following the quinjet and he blast forward when he saw the rest of them taking up the charge.
“Maybe…” Natasha murmured quietly. “Maybe we can broker a truce for a period.”
They were followed by reporters from the moment they left the Tower. Their vans were like an unconventional escort that shadowed their every move. When they reached the courthouse, they saw that police had to set up a barricades to make a walkway for them to the building.
The door slammed open before Bucky could finish the sentence. Steve froze, half draped over Bucky, whereas Bucky instantly drew his gun and pointed it at the doorway.
“I also blamed myself, Peter. To block out the pain I drank and I made risky decisions in my life and business. It was only years later that I realized I was squandering away what Yinsen sacrificed his life for and from that point on I knew I could not continue my life mourning him...Think on it. Would Gwen want this? Would she blame you for what happened? Would she approve of how much you blame yourself, Peter?”
Wade nodded and then darkly murmured, “Then our countdown has already begun.”
“Yup!” Steve grinned excitedly.
Something happened. Something that they had been dancing around for weeks but, whatever it was, they had leapt away and now were warily circling each other.
And Peter’s fingers were literally itching to work with it.
Wade sprinted up the stairs, his footfalls loud from his heavy tread. Venom tried to drag him to the window but Peter dug his fingers into the wall and the symbiote shrieked in frustration.
He’d heard stories of the merc with a mouth, but he hadn’t met him yet...well, Wade hadn’t met Steve yet. Timelines and who meeting who didn’t really mean much to him when faced with his unmoving child.
Tony was gone.
“Alright…We can go to the Tower now. That sound good?” His father replied gently.
Pepper asked, “Why didn’t we work?”
Nothing could tear them apart.
Steve sighed lightly and Tony felt even worse for his cowardice.
Before she entered, Steve positioned himself between the door and his teammates. His right hand twitched for his absent shield. For a moment, he felt nauseated and weak without it. It had never been far from his hand in all his battles but now it was gone. He clenched his fists and pushed aside the uneasy feelings. If he needed to fight his fists would do just fine.
Tony pulled the chair closer to the bed and he asked, “Are you really fine?”
“It’s not like that,” Peter replied with an eye roll. He lightly pushed Eddie in the arm and said, “Smell you later.”
“It’s just a feeling, I can’t help it, but I can…I can suppress it and it’ll go away,” Steve promised.
Instead the doctor came back with a rectangular item, smaller than a handheld radio and held it out to Steve. Steve stared at it blankly.
Tony dropped his head in his hands and gasped, “Why’d you say that?”
and Steve turned into his enemy made no sense. Bucky would
Tony landed, his sinking heart weighed him down.
“They’re really going to think we’re clones now,” Peter groaned.
What was he supposed to do now?
“This is
“I know that road,” Tony gasped in shock, not expecting to see the place his parents died.
Then it was just darkness.
Steve sat down next to Tony and sarcastically sighed, "Sadly, he's afflicted with the inability to stop being a jerk."
Tony shrugged at Pepper’s allusion about Steve and said, “I guess.”
“Did…Did he say anything about…me?”
Peter withdrew his hand from underneath Bruce’s. He tucked his hand close to his face and buried his into Tony’s side. Bruce sighed heavily and ran his hand through his hair. He regarded Peter for a moment then stood. He lightly caressed Peter’s soft hair and whispered, “Don’t give up on hope…I love you, Peter.”
He was useless.
After all these years, he was finally able to save his son’s life.
“The show must go on,” Tony sadly murmured to Steve, doubting he would know he was referencing one of Queen’s songs. He looked up at his friend with a wide smile and asked, “Ready?”
he comes to help.”
Tony turned to him and whispered, “Stop apologizing, dummy.” He bent down and pressed a needy kiss onto Steve’s mouth which Steve greedily accepted. Steve cupped the back of his neck to pull him in closer. Tony broke their kiss gasping, “Kissing you never felt so good as it does now.” He leaned back in and hungrily kissed Steve again, exploring Steve’s mouth like it was the first time all over again. Steve returned the kiss with a similar feeling, reminding the man he loved that he was alive and they were still together.
“What was that, beloved?”
became scared,” Steve said.
He may have betrayed his master once, but could he do it again?
“Favorite position?” She asked, ignoring Peter and his resulting groan.
“I’m liking you already, Wade,” MJ said, leaning back into the couch and poking Wade’s legs with her knees. Her expression lost its teasing tilt and softened as she asked, “But seriously, tell me about you two. I want to know everything about the guy who my best friend literally can’t let go of.”
“Um…I…” Tony said uncertainly.
He was saying it more to himself than the Captain. He was affirming the fact in his mind, making it real…He was telling himself that there was more to himself than what he had been programed. He once had a will of his own and if he reached out enough he might be able to grab it.
fight for Hydra!
“Brother won’t come out,” Hulk grumbled, glaring at Venom.
“Are you okay, Petey?” Steve asked softly.
Questions were being thrown at him from every direction and flashes from cameras blinded him.
He vilified is soulmate and quickly began to irrationally hate this person.
“Oh! Yes!” Pepper gasped, “You’re done already?”
When the doors opened, Peter and Harry’s laughter became louder and Steve’s smirk became an all-encompassing grin. He heard the familiar buzz of Peter’s toys and knew where to find the boys.
Tony pursed his lips and grudgingly admitted, “He was one of the first names I wrote.”
Wade’s lips trembled but he smiled widely and agreed, “Yes.” He gripped Peter’s hand tighter and leaned into his shoulder. Peter tilted his head up to accept a kiss and, as their lips met, his heart felt so full of love that it was overflowing into the rest of his body with its warmth.
Tony’s brows pinched in confusion and he asked, “Yes?”
And there was nothing Steve could do to help him.
He was still reading the article when Happy pulled them up to Tony’s Tower. They drove into the lower garage and Steve was surprised to see reporters outside the main doors.
“We need to know being frozen for over 70 years didn’t impair you. We need to know you are mentally stable and won’t go on a killing spree when someone makes you angry.” In the back of his mind, images from the calamity of Harlem flash through his mind and he repressed a shudder. If the Captain turned out to be as volatile as the Hulk…a cold shiver ran down his back at the thought.
“I have no record of an invitation, sir…Shall we be calling this charity ball ‘Enigma’ as well?”
"Peter, that is not Tony. I suggest you get to know him before you start judging him."
“…Who is that?” Harry asked curiously.
He mutely cleaned up the mug and the remains of his failure of a hangover cure.
Tony chuckled lightly and murmured, “I hope it has a happy ending…”
“Rusted,” the Red Skull continued and James shot to his feet, dislodging Steve from his side with a single push. He could already feel it. It was like the machine had metaphorically stepped forward and was hovering ominously behind him, waiting for the rest of the words to free it. The hairs stood up on the back of his neck as he imagined the machine breathing deeply in anticipation against the nape of his neck.
Peter stared at Tony in shock but a storm of emotions was building up inside of him and was going to break through the stoic veil any second.
“Very,” Steve pressed. “Wade is becoming a big part of your life and I don’t want you to have to split it because we all don’t get along…”
And like that, he saw hope flare into Steve’s eyes like a mighty inferno, burning away the despair, and Tony’s heart pinched with guilt. Tony couldn’t tell him that it was utterly hopeless. He couldn’t let Steve die with it on his conscious. The super soldier gasped, “Yes! What??”
He didn’t care if these people worked for the U.S. government. If they wanted Steve, they were going to have to step over his dead body before he let them any closer to him.
“Almost done, Steve, you’ve been doing great,” Sam assured him.
“I bet we can make a really good guess,” Bucky stated, staring pointedly at the robot.
“Everything Mac did will be thrown out by the end of the week,” Eddie stated, picking up the flask. Turning to Peter, he rebutted, “What do we have to lose? Our solution is going to die no matter what we do! With this, at least we can try something! There’s a chance the symbiote will latch onto it and infuse itself with our molecules!”
Solo glanced at the building almost lazily. It was one of his good days so Steve knew he’d get a straight answer as he replied, “The one and only. You’ll see Iron Man fly into it every once and awhile. Tourists love it.”
Before Steve could break the archer’s heart, Tony leaned in and said, “This may very well be zombie ground zero.”
Buchanan Barnes, was the James I knew. I thought what he was remembering about New York was about a past mission, until he confronted our supervisor about it. I thought they had killed him the night they took him away for remembering something he was not supposed to!” She laughed ironically and gasped, “That’s why I changed my codename to Black Widow because I thought I had lost the only man I could ever love. It was stupid really. I should have known they would just erase him again. A damaged super solider is still better than no super soldier at all!”
Peter grabbed the back of his neck, almost like it pained him, and he stated, “You do not know what you are talking about.”
Before Tony, he had never considered going into a “casual” relationship nonetheless doing so with a man. He didn’t like the idea of having Tony one night and him being free to go to someone else the next night. And, if they were doing this, he did not want it to be merely physical…
He was grateful for the shirt and the flip-flops because they were tools in getting him closer to Tony. He picked up his tread as he ran. Tony was closer than he had ever been and Steve had no idea his condition and every moment wasted was another moment wasted without Tony.
Jarvis opened another file and Tony began to read and the tightness in his chest became even more tighter and he felt like he was going to break.
Steve went to sit up again and hissed, “Is there any –?”
“The Winter Soldier has finally met his match,” Tony teasingly stated as soon as Bucky disappeared.
“Oh,” he said, unable to hold back his distain. Internally, his anger simmered lightly to the surface. He trusted Deadpool just as much as he could throw him without using his Iron Man suit, and that wasn't far at all... He didn't know how the merc convinced Peter to enter into the relationship but Tony was sure as hell going to make sure it came to an end.
Still touching his lip, he looked at her and the significance of the memory came racing back to him.
going wrong. Steve and Bucky were going to die; Tony was dying; and now Howard was meddling in his business thanks to Steve.
For a moment, his sadness almost knocked aside his anger as he remembered his soulmate smiling, laughing, and
Natasha cupped the side of his face that was uninjured and stared into his eyes. His gaze revealed his true feelings: his despair for their fate and his love for her. He never thought she was a distraction.
“He’ll be back before dinner,” Tony shrugged it off. Peter hadn’t been getting out in the field recently so Tony was happy he was finally doing what he loved. Tony hooked his arm through Steve’s and murmured, “Since Pete is out having fun and you can’t ask him about his bio-shield, you’re going to help me with finding a gift.”
"It can if she's still alive," Bucky stated.
“Yup!”
. Don’t think about it!
Telling the rest of the Avengers was much easier.
Steve’s heart dropped when he saw his son. Peter had transformed overnight and looked like he was just skin and bones. His eyes were sunken in and dark, his skin was tight and dry, and his once thick brown hair was thin. Peter trembled where he fell and the tendrils of Venom which were still attached to him shook his body all the more.
When it stopped screaming, Wade wiped of a particularly large glob of spittle off his cheek and then suggested, “You want a Tic Tac?”
“One of the guest rooms obviously,” Tony retorted. He opened the fridge and frowned at the contents. He asked, “Should we get pizza?”
They were stealing his memories and Tony with it. The love that had grown between them was being shredded and he was beginning to question his feelings.
He didn’t know how long he sat there just staring at the reactor, waiting for the pain to eventually make an appearance. But it must’ve been some time as Jarvis eventually announced, “Sir, Master Rogers is back and is headed in your direction.”
Peter slipped his hand into Wade’s, pulling Wade with him in Steve’s direction, and Peter asked, “What can we help you with?”
Steve’s heart clenched and he whispered, “I’m sorry…”
Tony nodded and grasped his arms, pulling on him as he murmured, “Come to bed with me.”
“Said it wasn’t a concussion…” Tony stated smartly.
“I kinda ambushed you,” Peter murmured. “With my parents and when I asked you to…not kill anymore…”
Peggy cupped his jaw and made Steve met her caring eyes. She whispered, “He’s not fine
Tony wasn’t going to be the cause of Steve’s death. He knew that but that still didn’t stop the guilt. He knew
wouldn’t,” Tony corrected him with a sly grin.
“H-Have fun but be careful,” Steve stuttered. He was trying on his daddie shoes and Tony thought it was adorable.
one of those people. When he is with someone, he’s with them 100%. You two might be ‘faking it’ but he’s still putting his heart on the line, so don’t you dare crush it.”
Tony huffed and sarcastically replied, “Yeah, bet you weren’t expecting this kind of drama when you agreed to come up here.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Peter leaned toward him and lightly kissed Wade, breaking him out of his line of thinking. Peter murmured, “I’m going to take a shower and drink half a pot of coffee.”
Steve pinched his eyes shut for a second as his emotions rose and he held Tony a little tighter. He still wasn’t used to having his Tony back.
Peter mentally let it go and the shield sunk down. He turned to his friend and gasped, “We need to conduct new tests!”
“Thank you usually is the go to,” the priest teased.
Steve’s arm was lying on his dad’s shoulders and both of them were smiling ecstatically. His dad waved at the camera and said, “Hey, Pete! I just wanted you to be the first to know! He said yes! Now say hello to your new step-father!”
"That was Ross' doing?" Bruce's hand is abruptly very hard, biting into Tony's skin. "Tony, I told you-"
Sam is pretending not to listen, flipping through the copy of the Accords that Steve has been taking everywhere, jotting down notes and improvements whenever he thinks of them. "You gonna say something about this in here? T'Challa's contract allows him free movement in Wakanda. Perhaps the others need the same thing for the United States."
Tony bristled. "That's rich coming from the guy who volunteered for an experimental serum on the off chance it might make him a super soldier."
Tony blurts, "he kept talking about a doctor. A doctor coming from the glow, from beyond. You ever heard of anything like that?"
"And why aren't you doing this?" Maria Hill interrupts his thoughts.
doing?
and Tony can't even - Tony can't even -
When Steve is five, his soul-name solidifies, securing his future.
"No," the kid says. "No, you can't. And saying that whatever this is isn't because you don't trust me isn't the same as saying you do trust me, by the way."
"Thanks, kid."
Donnie's so pale he's nearly sparkling in the sunlight and the kid has never looked so excited. A tug of guilt weighs Tony down; even today he'd hesitated at bringing him up out of the basement, out of the safe walls of the compound. Exposing Donald to outside stimuli runs at thirty eight chance of backfiring spectacularly, Tony's calculated. Never mind that FRIDAY's reprimanded him for not including Donnie's own emotional response in those calculations. Emotions are rough and not to be trusted, especially under pressure, and Donnie has managed to amass more issues than all the Avengers combined.
Steve straightened, going stiff, and a cold breeze seemed to shiver down everyone's spine. Tony was still smiling, as cheerfully manic as he ever was, but those words...they didn't sound right from his mouth. He didn't sound like himself anymore as he babbled on.
There is a loud crackle in Tony's ear, making him involuntarily jerk to the side. As he course corrects, he barks out a roll call, but Luke and Daredevil are as fine as they were ten seconds ago. "Spider-Man?" Tony tries.
"Tony," Rhodey says, and a hand closes down over the fingers that had been beating wildly against the table top. The four men sit in the silence for a moment and Tony can't bring himself to look up.
"Well. I did try to kill you. Blew off your arm," Tony points out, then looks to the side. "The arm you used to kill my parents." Barnes raises his eyebrow and inexplicably, Tony finds himself almost smiling. "You're right, why
"Agent," he says softly. "I see the rumors of your demise - blah blah blah."
"They never remembered her before." He feels like he's speaking around broken glass. "She was just - Howard's wife. Tony's mother. Now the whole world is going to know her name. Maria Stark. Loving wife, devoted mother, strangled to death by the Winter Soldier. God, I hate this, Pep."
Tony looked down at himself and, very slowly, lifted a hand to rest over his heart. He pulled a bit at the scrubs and the neckline dipped low, revealing the top of a spiderweb of scars and the curve of a truly hideous bruise. No, Steve thought dimly, horrified. He had seen his Tony’s chest; everyone had, it’s not like the teen was shy. It didn’t look like that, it was clear and smooth except for the reactor-
Tandy is watching him out of the corner of her eye, most of her attention focused on making sure Cloak doesn't swallow Diamondback up and send her to Antarctica. "Oh, Steve," she says, and she's the only one besides Sam who calls him by his first name. "Don't look so sad. Those two will kill each other one day and put us all out of their misery."
Zemo chuckled.
"Of course he didn't deserve it, Tony," Pepper whispers to him, like Tony doesn't already know this, but it helps nonetheless.
Tony rubbed the back of his neck. This could not be happening to him. “But, um. Behind you?” Big Steve obediently looked. “That’s the Time Fog. It does weird things to the space-time continuum. Things from other dimensions slip through the cracks here all the time.”
"These facilities need to be taken out," he had snapped, and he cannot forget the sneer on her face.
"You think I don't know?" he whispers. "I didn't go to Leipzig up on my moral high horse because the Accords were just oh-so-righteous. I didn't go for the Accords at all. I went for
“It was there, back then-”
"Manila?" he jokes. His voice is shaking. "When are you going to join us in the twenty first century, Doctor Banner?"
"Barnes has been through a lot," Tony points out, wondering why he's bothering.
, a flower nickname. My man, you are one step away from food nicknames, the ultimate sign of Stark affection!"
Tony doesn't reply and Fury walks out. Tony strolls over to the kitchen, hearing the subtle clink of Rhodey's legs behind him. "Tones, man, you okay?" Tony holds up a finger, opens the lid to trash can, and empties the contents of his stomach.
Kamala's blush intensifies as a small, hopeful grin blooms on her face. "Really? That - well I was thinking, maybe everyone won't like it but since this was my idea they can deal - but I'd really like to go see
His gaze falls on the phone he's cobbled together for Barnes, lying on top of the drawing Steve left behind, the one Tony has been adjusting and improving, over and over.
T'Challa honest-to-God growls. It is astoundingly hot, or it would be if he weren't still in his terrifying outfit with his terrifying claws. "Your Highness," Tony begins. "T'Challa. Please." T'Challa actually turns towards him at that, but Tony isn't sure what he's asking for. He is saved from figuring it out when General Thaddeus Ross walks through the compound's front door, already bellowing out orders.
.  The old Avengers didn't start really functioning until about two years after our creation, and it still wasn't perfect. You're both incredibly smart, but you don't know tactics or teamwork. If I'm taking over training, the first thing I want you two to do is take the comms for the next few missions, watch the field footage, and see how it works."
not seen the darkest parts of the man he considered a true friend.)
“You didn’t have to,” Steve says automatically, but his mouth clicks shut as Tony brings up the shield and places it over his lap.
and I can't leave him with them alone but Jesus, I've got nightmares of my own, I don't need his."
"You are both wrong," Vision butts in serenely. "FRIDAY is only making four."
“If you need help looking-”
"I know."
"And since then," Fury goes on as if Steve hadn't spoken. "You've given up your shield, your position, gone into hiding and turned your back on Captain America. Your choice, Rogers, I've made my opinion on all that clear. But Captain America - I knew that kid. Stubborn son-of-a-bitch, not big on authority, but a more decent man than the rest of us deserve. I knew what he fought for. I just need to know: are you still that man?"
"Categoric Armistice Regulatory Tactical Emulation Rostrum," he says in a near whisper. "CARTER."
"You're not dreaming," he said bluntly.
Sure enough, Peter yanks his uniform back together, bad shoulder be damned, and stands up straight through the hologram, disrupting and dissipating it. "I said I'm fine,
"It's got a pun and alliteration, Cap. The man's not made of stone." And with that parting crack, he leaves, Steve's laugh following him out.
"Square deal. Hey, see if you can snag one of their interns for the spring semester. Stacy, Gwendolyn." That'll give Peter a nice little heart attack when they both show up for work. Tony glances over at Rhodey, sprawled and snoring over two seats and Vision sitting peacefully two rows away, then back. "Thanks for coming with us, Pep."
“He said he had a brilliant plan, yes?” he mumbled. “The man shoots fire out of those gauntlets. It is hard to say no to that.”
," in the most unimpressed voice that Tony has ever heard.
"And, Tony," she says, cupping his face in her palm. "I would never, ever put you through that. You're a good man, Tony Stark, and you deserve someone who'll love you through everything. I'm sorry I wasn't that person." Her eyes flicker down and the spark fades away and Tony is such an ass, such an all-consuming jackass of the highest order to have not seen that look of disappointment in Pepper's eyes for what it was. For whom it was.
He buys a piano and puts it in the den and plays it to distraction, the same song, over and over again.
In between the moments of unconsciousness T'Challa takes the armrest at his feet. "I have been called back to Wakanda and must leave immediately. If we are to talk, it has to be now." The king stretches out a hand and blearily Tony takes it, letting T'Challa pull him into an upright position. Tony, still half out of it, pats his bicep appreciatively. He thinks T'Challa might be smirking now.
“What are you even talking about?” Tony screeched, then threw his hands up in the air. “Why am I even asking? You don’t know! You don’t know anything except punching things and doing the Charleston!”
“Only time he sits down,” Steve said, squinting in that direction. Sure enough, he spotted the bright flare of Tony’s arc reactor. He stood with a sigh, squaring his shoulders.
Tony wrenches himself upright by DUM-E's arm, bringing the bot close when he whines. "Sorry, buddy, but I need - Wakanda, FRIDAY. Now."
. All the tech and the – sometimes just the way he talks! He keeps…suffocating me! I don’t want to know! I don’t want to know the latest song, or what a Furby is, or how to turn off Safe Search, or who Will Smith is. I don’t want to know yet! I want –“ He caught himself.
Peter grinds his teeth together, thinking hard and not liking any bit of it, probably furious at Tony's very salient points. "What about Harry?" he finally asks. "I mean his father's essentially dead to him now, and this could be what caused it. Maybe Mr. Osborn was experimented on like that Barnes guy. Maybe it wasn't his fault. Don't you think he deserves to know what happened to his dad?"
"I want the Spyder."
"Thanks," Tony says. He doesn't elaborate, T'Challa doesn't ask, and Tony boards the helicopter.
Rhodey leans back in his chair. "You planning on getting back at a reasonable hour tonight?"
"He gets very grumpy. Grumpy-
"I will," Bucky replies, absolutely determined. Steve breathes a little easier. "Stark seems like a real handful. I can't imagine the rest of them are much better."
To his utter relief, Rhodey contradicts him. Brings out the debrief, points out where Natasha can be better utilized, debating if Vision and Tony's roles shouldn't be switched. The others chime in with their opinions and Tony has never loved them more.
"And the research found?" Tony persists.
"I've done that," Steve remarks. "Trust me, it was a lot easier than this."
Spider-Man remains silent but there is a scraping sound on the marble as Kamala plays with her cup. "It sounds like you're asking us to just sit on the sidelines," she says, sounding heartbroken.
Anthony was being held in the infirmary tent. His bodyguard, Clinton Barton, went a little pale when he saw Steven storming through camp towards him.
"I don't care about him, I care about you. And tomorrow you're gonna feel really shitty about this."
A flash of green, and he was sent flying once more.
And he wasn't naive enough to think that it went both ways, that Steve would follow him into the gates of hell or whatever charming phrases those army types said, but he thought Steve would follow him far enough.
“Like you said. A lot has changed.” It doesn’t sound agreeable, or even kind. It’s miserable, Steve’s voice, and angry.
where he is."
think there's something wrong with Lukin?"
"Is she going to hit me?"
Some make him hopeful. Steve has taken one of the parts of the charter that discuss the rules within the Avengers Initiative itself to task, pointing out that nowhere in there does it necessarily protect the council from deciding they can change these rules to suit their own whims, and suggested a fix. Tony has circled this multiple times.
"You said you'd protect me, I didn't think that meant you'd lock me up in your basement. You're just like them!" Tony feels his whole body flinch. He doesn't know who Donnie is referring to, SHIELD or HYDRA. He doesn't want to know. He doesn't - he isn't -
. It makes something loosen and warm in his chest that he thought he'd left behind somewhere in Siberia, or the caves, or maybe even earlier, some lost Christmas his parents never came home to.
He heads out towards the hallway and Steve all of the sudden goes boom-down into the couch before he can even think about moving. It's like a post-battle crash, but he hasn't been fighting. Wanda and Sam are by his side in an instant but he just pushes forward through their comforting grips to rest his forearms on his knees and breathe deep.
"What
"Excuse me?"
"I'm trying, believe me," Tony says quietly, watching the still remaining Terrigenesis cloud drift up into the sunlight. Half the city has been evacuated for fear of contamination. "Ellis has already approved our cooperation with ATCU and Coulson will let us into SHIELD if he's smart. Which he's supposed to be, but I don't know, death does weird things to people."
"Natasha. Stop talking like you know me." Tony didn't realize his voice could get
He leads them to a section of barracks, the walls a slick gleaming white in contrast to the concrete of earlier, and points to two near the end. "Those are yours. General passcode is 1-6-1-0. We'll get you new ones tomorrow. Now, since someone had me keep a portal open for his weepy goodbyes, I am beat. See you in the morning, boys." In direct contradiction to his apparent exhaustion, he summons up another portal and steps through it, disappearing.
Most nights, Steve walked the perimeter of the campus.
God, Stark always made him feel so
"Are you? Shouldn't be shocking to the woman who betrayed her teammates and electrocuted royalty to let Rogers and Barnes escape," Sharon shoots back, and Tony has to grin even as Natasha stiffens a bit. Sharon sighs, demuring to Lukin. "Don't start, I already know what you're going to say. I should play nice, shouldn't I?"
"Because I said I know who you are. Because giving up your mask was never part of the deal, its just Ross being a
"I'm not alright," Tony says bluntly, meeting Rhodey's eyes. "But I don't want to talk about it right now. Okay? Are you satisfied?"
"Thank you, T'Challa," Steve manages. "Can we have a moment?" The king narrows his eyes minutely but bows out of the room. Steve takes a deep breath, reaches into his pocket, and throws Fury's phone on top of the Accords Sam is looking through. Sam jumps, eyes flicking between the phone and Steve before he realizes the make and model aren't Wakandan.
Barnes stares at him, so completely blank and gutted. "And then it will be over?"
"He will for today," Bruce growls. "Talk to him, okay? He shouldn't come back in here until he's settled."
This is what he wanted, isn't it? Just a chance that they could go back to the way they were before, together. Well, Tony's met him halfway. They can't go back. Steve can't go back. But this is
"I have been told that, yes," Tony remarked, unruffled but for the tightening in his jaw. "Still not seeing the connection here."
"We're gonna have to fix this," Rhodey says evenly, Tony's ragged breathing clogging up the airwaves. "Go back to the drawing board. You and me, we'll set a precedence, Tones, the council-"
"Now that he knows about it, though, now that he knows it's the only thing that can help him," he continues to the window. "I won't withdraw it if he decides to stay hidden - I'll hand it over to you. It's patented to hell and back and besides, I can trust you. Probably."
She rung out the washcloth one handed, dipping it into the chipped bowl on the floor and placing it on Steve’s scorching forehead, and then settled in for the night, listening to her son’s breathing, welcoming each one.
"Bucky, it's okay," Steve says firmly. "However you feel about it, it's
"Well. Well enough. I worry."
"The company is collapsing, Tony. That's two thousand people out of jobs in New York City alone."
It's low. Too low. "Does Donnie know?" Tony says around the lump in his throat.
He doesn't want this. He doesn't want the way Natasha has looked so surprised at his actions, the pride in Rhodey's eyes, the way Barton clapped him on the shoulder and said "Good on you, Stark." He doesn't want gratefulness, he doesn't want to be the bigger man, he doesn't want to be logical about this. He wants Bucky Barnes to rot and burn, he wants to smash his face in and strangle him, he wants him to know what they felt like.
, Steve. This is everything you've wanted since coming here. Doesn't that strike you as strange?"
"I am. On my life, Barnes." He wants to punch himself in the face as soon as he says it. He inexplicably aches for the armor; he's always a better person inside it than out. Ready for anything. He's not ready for this.
"Yes," T'Challa says fiercely. Tony's mouth closes with an audible click. "I do not want your fear to drive you, Tony Stark, because you are a better man than that." He snatches up Tony's hand like he did a week before and holds the fingers up between them both until Tony stops shaking.
, do you think you’re the only one who’s ever loved somebody?”
"He can freeze people, Mr. Stark," Coulson replies.
"Well, I'm certainly not doing this out of the goodness of my
A sleeve pulled back, and a name revealed. But it did not fill her with the sickness and hatred it did last night. Her heart rose up into her throat, buoyed by joy. There was a name where once there were smudges.
He pauses on the ramp, his eyes staring at Spider-Man re-entering the scene, fighting with the masked, green figure. Peter's still weak on his left side. Peter might lose.
Steve doesn't know how to handle that at all. Sometimes imagining Tony's forgiveness - imagining his own forgiveness to Tony - hurts too much. Steve will never back down from a fight, but that doesn't mean the scars never ache in the aftermath. And Steve is still healing from the war.
Taskmaster called out in his gruff voice, and every one stopped what they were doing to shield their eyes against the sun and watch a Chitauri head sail through the air. Near the end of the field, playing with Cosmo the Spacedog and pretending he wasn't enjoying it, Loki obligingly waved a hand and the scoreboard added another point for the red giant as the head soared right over the walls of the Academy.
(See the end of the chapter for
The last part is hard, directed towards the Captain. Her already ram-rod posture grows even more stiff but otherwise she shows nothing. "Of course. I just wanted to let Jim know what his options were."
-Are you okay?
"Captain Rogers," the lightly accented, feminine voice greets him, and a few lights come on. "You followed the scent right to my lair, like I knew you would. Such a good boy."
"FRIDAY," he says. "Give me a sitrep."
that dangerous and apparently, neither did Natasha because she actually stops. "Look," he says on a sigh. "First thing: phones work both ways. Second thing: FRIDAY, 121691 to Agent Romanov's phone."
Vision, the wonder that he is, lets it slide. "I am always here to listen, Tony."
Aamir looks away, then down, staring into his cup like he's trying to read the tea leaves. "I hold much admiration for Dr. Banner," he finally confesses. "I would like to be like him. I would like to help people like my sister."
"What would you have us do, then, Stark?" Another slam. "You haven't read the reports I have. Cap is completely lost out there."
Forewarning: In this chapter Tony is going to think things about Bucky Barnes that are Not Nice and will probably rub you the wrong way. He also comes dangerously close to depersonalizing Bucky because it makes it easier for himself. It's not healthy.
She brushes aside the pieces of the Accords to grab two slips of paper. She holds them carefully even though her knuckles are turning white with strain and her face is agonized as she reads over words she must have read a thousand times, probably has memorized.
“See that you continue to do so. There might be a reward.” She turned back to the preceedings just in time for Rhodes’ ‘Of all the stupid-!’
She eyes him as if she's thinking of taking that literally and then she sighs. "There's good and bad in the world, Stark, but the 'right thing?' That's all relative. All we can do is fight for what we believe and hope that it's good enough. The Accords aren't easy and they aren't perfect, but we're all here because we believe that they're better than what we had before. This is the right thing, for me and for you and everybody on this team. This isn't just about you, so don't think for a second that I'd be here if you were doing this all out of spite. What, do you think the rest of us are sticking around because of your magnetic personality?"
"He'll never get better that way," Howard scoffs. "I could have built him again, out of that tiny little piece. I could've gotten him back." Suddenly the body on the table is no longer Barnes, and Tony's hand isn't in someone's head, moved down to be buried inside a broad chest.
"I hope we reach an understanding, Mr. Stark," the general says carefully. His words seem sharp and over-enunciated and blurred, all at the same time. "We both want what's best for the future. There are so few ways to achieve that; you perhaps know that better than anyone. I can only pray we walk the same one." Tony merely nods, feeling vaguely like he's been stuffed with cotton, and Lukin smiles. "Your rogue Avengers - you truly have no clue where they are?"
"You do make a pretty good sacrificial lamb, Parker."
Clint's face has grown terribly blank. "You just sat back and did
It takes time, effort, and more than a few skirmishes with Thanos’ forward scouts, but he and Tony stop fighting each other and begin fighting side by side.
His AI almost sounds scared.
That - that he doesn't
"Who's going to tell?"
"He's just scared," Tony tells Rhodey and Bruce, but Bruce is shaking his head.
, he had once called that shield, and he had known Tony had understood him completely.
"No way."
"Don't lie to me, sweetheart, we all know he's immortal. He also has been known on occasion to push too far, and this is one of them. Remind your boss which gives first when you put Steve Rogers to the wall."
You called. We responded.
Peter snorts in derision.
“Real swell, Buck!” Steve replied. James clambered onto the bed with him, ignoring his mother’s protestations about Steve needing rest, and slung his arm around the younger boy’s shoulders, Steve’s left arm squeezed between them. James laid his own wrist next to it, the dark smudge taking up the entirety of the inside of his wrist.
He, and all those other blank-wristed people, were outside the norm. Worse than second soulmates even, at least those people had names. Tony lacked a basic function of humanity. He certainly didn't feel human right now.
HE STOLE MY SHIELD:
"I still think it. I just think it wasn't enough. Not for Tony," Steve says, thumbing at the Accords. "Not for a lot of people, it seems. But I stand by what I said. I'd have stood by his side. But Tony did all this without me. He does that a lot, leaves me behind." Steve glances back at Bucky. "Or maybe I just can't catch up."
"Kid," Tony cuts him off. "You
Steve's eyes went wide, and a bit scared. "What if I do?" If there was anything in the world Steve hated besides bullies, it was disappointing people. Joseph had seen to both.
CLINT:
But the worst things Tony tells me aren’t about Bucky, or Afghanistan, or the wormhole, or Stane, or the civil war. Or me. The worst things, in the grand scheme of his life, almost seem tiny in comparison but for the lasting effects they have on the man. But they stick with me, for days, weeks, months, years from now when Tony and I will be happy again. I will still look over to him, long after the other hurts have faded, and remember these two small things, and pull him close to me to hold him tight.
So why didn't you tell Tony? Or for that matter me, when I asked you what the hell had happened
Peter cocks his head a bit at that, gears clearly turning in that mastermind of his, and no, call Tony a hypocrite, but he's still not ready to drag all that into light. "You're a good friend, Parker." Peter's mouth twists a little at that, something between a smile and a grimace.
It's not like he had been expecting it to be easy. He has a whole new team now; he has to start over from scratch. But he can't quite recall it every being this hard before. He can't recall waking up in the morning and thinking to himself that this is the day he'll just stay in. This is the day he'll hide, let his team sort themselves out, let someone else handle it. Even in those first few months with the Avengers when he and Tony could barely stay civil through one conversation and everyone kept pushing into Barton's sore spots completely unawares, there had still been something there that held them together.
"How did Ross find out about this?" he finally manages.
Nat enough.
"You'll be alone with them, Tony," Rhodey says. "No Iron Man, just you and a bunch of people who really don't seem like your biggest fans."
Jan turned her nose up at him. "I'm sorry Steve won't let you sneak tech into his clothes, Sam, but there's no reason to be jealous of me and Tony." Confused and feeling just a bit judged, Sam turned a pleading eye towards Steve, who fixed with a flat stare and mouthed 'no.'
"HYDRA's not laying a single finger on you," Tony promises him. Donnie shakes his head, hands going around Tony's shoulders.
If we can find out how this was created - if we know the basics we can stabilize the formula, it won't hurt anyone anymore, we could neutralize-"
"To which part?"
He brushed against the Time Fog, thinking, for just a moment, what it would be like to just walk into it. The thought of time traveling again, though, was just a bit too terrifying.
"The scientists here are making me a temporary prosthetic. Should be ready in a day or two, and Stark wanted his answer around then," Bucky answers.
“I wish you would not call me that, Your Highness.” The wizard turned to Steven and favored him with a gentle smile. “The stone calls to like. Prince Anthony, in his infinite wisdom, used his gauntlets to implode the enemies’ supply. Jarvis dragged him away after they were hit with debris, which almost pierced his heart, but this should halt its procession.”
Steve leans back in his chair. He's been played by Fury before. He's probably being played right now. Fury said all the right things during that phone call, subtly pressing all of Steve's buttons even as he pretended to berate him. But if this is anything like before, Steve can't just sit back and let it happen to him; he has to act. Tony's not the only one who knows about working from the inside.
He found Sam surrounded by a gaggle of kids who all cried out when they say him. “Glad you could make it, Steve,” Sam said with a warm smile that Steve let himself return over the shoulder of the little girl he’d gotten down on his knees to hug.
Rhodey sets the tablet down with a huff. "Whatever, we'll all end up calling her Jo anyway. What can we do for you, Ms. Khan?"
"I'm sorry I keep doing this to you," he mumbles to the screen. T'Challa laughs in a sleep-heavy rumble that has Tony swaying towards the sound.
As for Tony and Iron Man, he finds himself for the first time working from the weaker position in relation to the Accords. Clearly after what happened revisions are still needed and luckily King T'Challa's word is still practically gold, but Tony already has a reputation as a 'loose cannon' that no amount of Accords-signing can change, and he's now on his second strike.
"I...well I was wondering if we could get out of the compound?" she asks, toeing the ground. "It's just that I haven't really been out since the funeral and I kind of miss the city."
And the universe refuses. The terrible things that have happened to Steve and Bucky don't change. Peggy and his old life go and
. He just had to hold on a little bit longer. The lines would solidify, and Steve would be safe.
"Really?" Tony says, canting his head to the side.
He is promptly shoved into a couch cushion. "Don't be weird, Tones. She's cool. Actually gave me some intel you might want to hear. Seems Ellis has already lined up Ross' replacement. You heard of General Aleksander Lukin?"
"Why?" Barnes asks simply. He pushes the paper's away from him, not closer to Tony, not as a gesture, but simply
"I'm not a Sheriff," Steve snapped. "I'm a Captain. Captain Steve Rogers." He felt a little guilty using such a sharp tone with a lost and confused Tony, but the other man didn't even blink. If anything, his delight only grew.
She holds his gaze for a long moment - normally when people do this, their eyes flick a little back and forth as they move from iris to iris; not Natasha. She stares at him, true and steady, until she's satisfied, and the moment passes. She'll accept it for now, and push when she has to. Natasha's learned some things, too. "So," she says, breaking the gaze and the moment. "What are the top three picks so far for your new bundle of joy?"
Steve scowled, dim horror retreating behind familiar irritation and not even recognizing the bitter jealousy in Tony’s voice. “Yes. He does that.”
"Any time," the other man says sincerely. They both straighten up. "What'd Barton say to you?"
"You were a bullet," he manages. "HYDRA aimed the gun and fired. It's not your fault."
"How do you know?" Peter spits.
"Well, I'm in," Dagger says, leaning back. "I'm not sure I'm Avengers material, but the rest of it sounded...pretty nice." Just the tiny little smile she gives lights up the entire room. Cloak glances sidelong at her and Steve's heart clenches: he will follow her anywhere, but Steve wants him to come along willingly.
"I can't say the same. What I can say is this:
(‘Don’t leave me,’ he had asked, and Tony had promised, and Tony had kept it in the end.)
"I do. I really do," Tony tells her, completely sincere and abruptly already done with this conversation. "But I am not the sole arbiter of the Avengers. We do things by committee now. It's a
Here's the thing:
"Tony!"
"Civil war," Fury harrumphs. "I saw that in the news. Civil war. There were twelve of you, that's not war. More like a street fight in a Wal-Mart parking lot. Now, since we're all here how about you stop dodging the question and tell me what happened."
FRIDAY asks him, worried, but he doesn't reply, letting his elbows slide further and further apart until his forehead is resting on the cold marble of the kitchen counter.
Tony stiffens, standing up straight to face this kid head-on. "It's a miracle you got him back then. Last guy that did that took down three Helicarriers on the way."
Vision is quiet for a long moment, eyes tracing something under Kamala's skin that Tony can't see. "I believe Ms. Khan would call you her savior. I would call you creator. Colonel Rhodes would call you friend, Agent Romanov her leader, Spider-Man his mentor."
control entirely. They've been fighting the yoke of the Accords for awhile - the incident in New York City with Green Goblin fanned the flames that were sparked by the loss of Captain America to parts unknown seven months ago - but he's worried that some senators will spy the gap the US is trying to force between itself and the Accords and set up legislation of their own.
"Tad dramatic," Tony mutters, and surprisingly, one of talking heads agrees with him.
Tony picks up his glass of whiskey and fits it to his lips. "Yeah, well. Starks aren't much known for our patience."
Barnes' eyes widen a little, recognition and acknowledgment, before he twitches in an approximation of a shrug. "The floor for me. Wasn't used to anything but."
"Stark."
. You're not moving on. You wanna do something, then you're gonna do something, Rogers, that's how you operate. I think every country who signed the Accords can attest to that. But you're not doing anything. Fury's playing you because you tied on the puppet strings."
Her husband’s second soulmate. The name that ran parallel to her own, the one that was whispered in Sarah’s wake at the market. Joseph had never gone looking for the woman, but her presence persisted anyway, a specter in their marriage. Of all the scars left by the Great War on Joseph’s body, this was the only he could not carry with honor. If a soulbond was meant to make a person whole, then needing a second must mean that the person had fractured somewhere on the inside, and in doing so, had fractured the original connection. It spoke of weakness of the mind, and weakness in the bond.
“Changed my mind. Throw me back into the river. Put me out of my misery.”
"Jewish," Peter corrects, setting the kettle to heat on the stove. "On my mother's side."
what it felt like. “You’re at Avengers Academy.”
“I know that face. Not a fan of – crap, I’m getting old, what is that?”
NATASHA:
I know. I trust you guys.
"Spidey, I'm patching you through to Luke Cage and Daredevil, give them your location-"
"Give it here," he said. When Tony didn't move, he held out a hand. "I need somewhere to start from, right? You've gotten me this far, Stark, you can't abandon me now."
He knows his father never meant for his formula to fall into HYDRA's hands. And hell, his father had gotten into bed with Nazi scientists before that, working on the bomb, he'd probably thought it was the same thing with Zola. The ends always justified the means to Howard, Tony remembers that best of all things about his father. It didn't matter what he wrecked along the way. But to know Howard might have had a finger on the trigger the whole time, it helps, in a way. It's Machiavellian, if true, cold and calculating. It's his father, down to the inability to realize he could just let go instead of gripping tighter. It's Tony, too.
Tony nods. A better reason than most. "Alright, then. We'll see about getting you re-enrolled and I'll help you hunt down a job. FRIDAY, make a search based on Aamir's resume. As for Kamala," he adds. "We'll see how it goes. If all else fails, she'll be the first ever Avenger with an official stipend. I'm sure she won't be the last."
"I knew, too, you know," Natasha tells him, watching him out of the corner of her eye while he strips some wires and works at the gauntlet at the dinner table.
"When Sergeant Barnes was first taken into custody, there was an offer on the table to extradite him to the United States-" There is a ripple of disquiet and Tony speaks louder. "-where he could receive the best psychiatric care. I have developed a technology that can assist him in this, you might have seen the video of my demonstration at MIT. But I'm saying again, Rep, this is not what we're arguing here. This is about Barnes' past, not his future, and Barnes is innocent. I'm hoping the courts will see this as well."
Steve laughs, too, because he can't do anything else. It shouldn't be like this, but it is. Bucky's right. "You still sound...you sound just the same."
There is a low hum as the call disconnects that ebbs away into silence. Kamala is staring up at the ceiling in awe, coming back to when Tony waves his mug in her general direction. "Hot chocolate?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony grins, sighs, hangs his head. He needs to say this. "I'm kind of a control freak, Pete. And now apparently I have to control my controlling-ness, which seems all sorts of counter-productive, but the larger point is this: I am sorry. What I did was not cool. I should have called back instead of ignoring you. And don't think for a second that you're not always welcome at the Compound."
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony strained, but there was nothing but their breathing and the far-off music from Club A. “No. What is it?”
"No," Steve said, swinging his shield off his back. "Right now I could really do with a good fight." With that he stomped off in the opposite direction from where Tony had flown. The girls watched him walk away silently.
. Barnes wants words. Barnes wants meaning.
And yet. Rhodey is conversing with Donnie about the fix to War Machine while Bruce is painstakingly explaining Hulk cell replication to a rapt Aamir while Kamala smiles at her brother, a hint of pride in her dark eyes overshadowed by wistfulness and grief (she will confess to Tony one day that her parents always called Aamir brilliant but lazy and would have been ecstatic that he's showing interest in something for once in his life. She will cry about how sometimes she gets so angry that it took them dying for Aamir to make something of himself. She will let Tony hug her tight). Hope is chatting with Lila Barton because it only took her two days to stop pretending she wasn't good with kids while Clint steals food off Cooper's plate amid his son's protestations and grabby hands. When Laura finally breaks it up she lets Nate, bouncing on her lap, decide 'who started it' and Clint pouts when the baby points at him and gurgles. Tony eats with one hand while he and Vision pass holograms between them, working on a new set of codes that could become War Machine's first-ever AI.
"I'm fine!" Tony nearly shouts, then turns away from him, grabbing his rolling stool and placing it close to Rhodey just as Bruce walks into the lab as well, rubbing at his eyes.
Tony opens his mouth, but nothing comes out.
"Canadian government has approved casualties but would prefer prisoners. It's out in the middle of nowhere so they don't particularly care if we blow it up. We'll be working with their army and SHIELD agents to take this place down. Primarily goal is to retrieve as much information as we can and getting a sample of the terrigen mist. Spidey, you're keeping your distance, got it. Round them up and put them away. Widow, you and T'Challa have the ground. We'll be the internal team. War Machine and I will take the outside, try to funnel them in. Vision, you're the only one who can survive the mist. SHIELD wants a sample, Canada wants a sample, and most importantly, I want a sample. Can do?"
"This isn't a normal life," Tony echoes.
"He's going to a Black Lives Matter protest?"
Her own mother is in her thoughts now. Poor Hope, half-orphaned by loss, then guilt finishing the job. She still rarely speaks of her father in anything but a professional manner. Tony can empathize; hell, most of them can. Maybe that's how they found each other - maybe that's why they can do this. So often people talk about 'living through' pain, but Tony can't think of it as anything but surviving. And they are all of them a rag-tag of survivors, huddling together for warmth.
Steve didn't point out that the Accords also allowed the council to put their foot down in certain situations and order the Avengers to operate, though T'Challa's has worked around that in his contract while Hope van Dyne has not. The Accords are rapidly shaping the Avengers up as some kind of military force under the council, establishing a chain of command, and while Steve could appreciate that this has some benefits it still makes him uneasy. The Avengers shouldn't be used as a puppet army for the United Nations. Tony, Natasha, the other Avengers, and himself - these are people he could trust. Everyone else is a potential threat; SHIELD and the World Security Council proved that.
Her eyes go wide, mouth thinning to a pale pink line. "It isn't up to me, or you. It should be his choice. You can't control him."
"Okay, yeah, no, you're not my dad," Peter agrees, laughing at the expression on Tony's face. "But you sounded exactly like my Uncle Ben just then. It was trippy."
"Please slow down," Rhodey says to him one day, out of nowhere. Tony just stares at him. "Please," his friend repeats.
Come to think of it, he might actually enjoy it, having the Avengers in his mansion, wiping away all the shit that happened there. If it didn't manage to fill like a giant violation of his parents' memory, and that - that was a big if, knowing himself like he rarely did.
They have come to a stop again, and this time T'Challa's gaze is very wary. "Wanda Maximoff remains. Sam Wilson went with him. As for Scott Lang, he is currently here in Belgium."
Fury sits him down thirty minutes before the debrief looking more tired than Steve has ever seen him, and Steve has seen him one foot in the grave. Its 0747 hours and Steve didn't sleep at all last night. By the way Fury grimaces, it shows.
He exhales shakily and then pulls his game face on, acutely aware of the cameras. A shot of him and T'Challa will probably go for a couple of thousand to the highest bidding newspaper. He lifts his eyes to the king and grips the bicep of his outstretched arm. "Sorry, I didn't mean to - I'm glad you're here, by the way."
. He'd known for years. He started a war for the man
"Cap's a kitchen mouse," Sharon says laughingly, her eyes blue,
Steve realizes with frightening clarity. It shouldn't have been a surprise; Fury trusts nobody beyond his most loyal lieutenants. But the fight over the Accords, the Civil War as the press had inanely started calling it, seems to have broken what little faith Fury had in them in the first place. The man is scrambling, desperate for a way to regain control over a situation that had gotten away from all of them.
Through which a person promptly fell through.
"He broke the law," he corrects her gently. "Natasha, why did you do this?"
, Tony had always heard, with a certainty that had puzzled him.)
"Because it's all about you. It's probably 'for our own good,' too, right, that's a platitude you haven't thrown out yet. Or maybe 'the ends justify the means,' that's always a good one." Steve said tightly. His lips were pressed so tightly together they were growing white, fists clenched at his side and for the first time those in audience realized that Steve was
Did you tell Sam?
"Kid, do you think I want to worry about you on top of all that?" It is a brand of emotional manipulation that Tony is not comfortable with using, but he's tired and willing to take shortcuts. Donnie's face registers surprise and just the slightest bit of wistfulness before he shakes his head. "Tell you what, you give me twenty-four hours and we'll give it a go." Donnie nods, looking relieved, but Tony goes on. "And give me that band."
Natasha wants to know.
"He's her brother! He was in the Middle East when the bomb struck, he's been trying to get back for weeks. He's on the next flight in to JFK. Should I - should we call him? He probably thinks his whole family is dead."
“Besides. I ain’t say nothin’ that wasn’t true, do I?” He was more present for a moment, staring at the door like he could see through it to his son within. “‘S torture, it is. Watching him suffer.”
"What's going to happen to him?" Laura asks quietly. Her kids are playing on the spot where Thor called the Bifrost down just outside the window.
Steve reaches for his phone when he's gone, and types out a message - not to Natasha, but the email that's been sending him the information. He hopes they all see it. He hopes they see it for what it is.
. Point still remains. You gotta recognize that doing will mean that you understand I am training you to be the future of the Avengers. And I'm not gonna settle for anything less than perfection. So are you in, Spidey? Kamala?"
Her tone becomes suddenly brisk, and he is very awake in the next second. "What is it? Trouble back home? Who did I-" Jesus, he hurts, he thinks again as he swings his legs off the bed and onto the floor. "I left Rhodey in charge this time, yeah?"
"Was that not it?" Tony teases. T'Challa huffs out a laugh. "You'll do fine."
Natasha snorted. “They don’t deserve it.”
,” she hissed, trying for his attention. Joseph’s face twisted up, a shade of his old smile crossing his face, all malice now. She did not want to hear his next words.
The blonde woman steps forward, uncharacteristically demure up until this point. She catches Tony's eyes from under her eyelashes and ducks a nod to the others. "The Avengers. We're acquainted."
Bruce finds him sitting at his computer, still fiddling with FRIDAY's codes, beefing up her hacking and security suites as well as a few new upgrades. Silently, he places a bulky folder at Tony's elbow and waits.
"If you say red and gold I will 'accidentally' roll over your toes for the next month," Rhodey says, all air quotes and dry sarcasm. He levels Tony with a frank look. "Tony."
Of course he did
"Yeah, you know. I built bombs, I killed thousands, I built Ultron and killed hundreds, I outfitted the Avengers and they killed dozens and I mean, golly, my kill-count's going down I guess, but
