"I won't," Tony agreed. He slipped his prosthetic hand under Bucky's and pushed it back a bit. He stared at their hands, metal palms resting against one another. "It's good to know there's someone in this fucked up world that understands me."
A high pitched ringing noise split through the air. Peter winced, his already sensitive ears feeling like they were going to bleed. The symbiote shrieked in agony, quickly melting away into nothing but a puddle of black sludge.
Peter stumbled, regained his balance, and took off again, jumping over Natasha and sliding between Clint's legs. "My spider sense says not to trust you guys. I don't want to believe it. I thought you guys were my family." He perched himself in the rafters, looking down at his team.
Peter made it back to the facility with only five minutes to spare. He went straight to the lab, not bothering to speak to anyone. Clint tried to talk to him but shied away when Peter gave him a death glare. Tony followed his son, speaking up when it was clear Peter wasn't going to do so. "Everyone's waiting in the conference room. We need to form a plan."
"We've only been sparring for an hour." Tony got to his feet and twisted his head from side to side. He knew he was going to have a sore neck in the morning and wasn't looking forward to it.
For a long minute, no one moved. Slowly, Harry lowered his gun. "I can't do it. I can't shoot you, Pete." He dropped the gun on the carpet. Michelle snatched it up while keeping her own trained on Harry. "You were a good friend," Harry continued. "And I'm sorry our friendship had to end this way." He left the apartment right after that, closing the door softly behind him.
Wanda crouched next to Peter, who was curled up in a tight ball on the couch. He whined in his sleep and scrunched his eyebrows together. Even in the almost unbearable cold, sweat dripped down Petet's face. Wanda stroked his hair, feeling slight guilt for leaving the boy with a single negative memory.
Bucky looked over the food Pepper had brought. He picked up a potato and tossed it between his hands, debating on whether or not he should chuck it at Steve's head. Maybe it would knock some sense into the super soldier. In the end, Bucky cooked up a meal that was very reminiscent of something he and Steve would've eaten back in their army days. The meal was by no means pleasant, but the familiar smell alone was enough to grab Steve's attention. Rhodey took Iron Man downstairs once Steve vanished into the kitchen.
"Stark?!" Falcon landed next to them, wings folding neatly behind him. He pushed his goggles up, wanting to see Tony with his own two eyes.
"The world still needs Spider-man." Tony tried to pass the suits back to his son, but Peter refused to touch them.
After a few months of Bucky living with the Avengers, Steve came to the conclusion that having him here was both the best decision of his life, and also his worst mistake. On the one hand, he was glad to have his oldest friend back at his side. Tony was making an actual effort to be nice to Bucky, and he could tell the two were starting to become friends. So everything was fairly pleasant on that front. But on the other hand...Peter and Clint had taken Bucky under their arms. Which was great, Bucky deserved to have friends. But Steve did not deserve the number of pranks he had been subjected to in the last few months. Steve could barely handle the combined forces of Peter and Clint when it was just them. Bucky was too intimidated by the rest of the Avengers to mess with them, so Steve was always the go-to person for his nonsense.
"I am," Tony nodded once. Bucky noticed him tightening his grip on the shield. "Is everyone alright?"
The person pressed the scalpel against the inside of Peter's forearm. "Try not to scream too much. Okay? I don't have the patience for it."
"No," Iron Man said bluntly. "You can't help me. Please just leave me alone. And let Clint know that the next time he sets foot in here I
"Fantastic." Ditching his backpack on a roof, Peter changed direction and soon arrived at a gas station that was being robbed. The assailant wore a cheap Iron Man mask. "Really? A part city mask? Again? You criminals have no creativity." The crook growled and pulled out a gun, only for Spidey to yank it out of his hand with a web. Another person came out of nowhere and tried to punch him upside the head. "Too slow, buddy!" Spider-man dodged punch after punch.
Iron Man took the drawing over to his desk and taped it to the side of one of the monitors. "Jarvis, I'd like to open a new project file. Titled 'Reset'."
Before Steve could answer, a high pitched ringing noise paralyzed him. His eyes were forced wide, and he felt like his brain was being squeezed. He tried to speak, but his mouth wouldn't obey him. Iron Man seemed to be experiencing something similar because he had stopped running his hands through the sand. Stopped moving altogether. Iron Man's visible eye was locked onto Steve's. Steve was a little surprised by just how much emotion there was in that glowing orb.
"Hey, don't question good things," Tony clapped Steve on the back before walking over to Spider-man. "He helped us out back there, remember? Good to have you back, Pete-"
Steve lounged in a chair on the balcony, deep in thought. The sun had set a while ago, and the cool night air ruffled Steve's short hair. Steve was out here in an attempt to calm his nerves. But the silence just guided his thoughts back to the events of today. Steve pinched the bridge of his nose when he thought about the absolute mess they had all found themselves in. Pepper assured him that everything would work out, and Steve wanted to believe that, but he still had his doubts. He pushed his concerns to the back of his mind and tried to relax. But the soldier found himself unable to do so. His mind once again wandered to the memory of Iron Man writhing in pain, with the electrified rope cutting through his throat. Iron Man's agonized scream echoed in his head. Steve shuddered.
"What for?" Tony frowned. He was currently hovering above an apartment building. Spider-man stood on the roof below, staring up at him, not at all happy that he had been followed. He raised his middle fingers. "Damn kid." He muttered. Thankfully, Steve didn't seem to hear him.
"And he doesn't leave the compound unless he's with one of us," Bruce pointed out. "When would he have done all this?"
"Bad idea. Steve's still the perfect target," Tony took a sip of his coffee before giving Clint a sly smile.
"Stark?!" Steve lowered his shield to see his friend standing in the broken doorway. Standing. And very much alive. Steve had never been so happy to see the other man in his life.
Tony felt a smug sense of defensiveness at Nick's answer.  "He didn't have nowhere to go," he repeated, voice dripping with mock sympathy.  He couldn't place the kid's accent.  Bronx?  Brooklyn?  He was already thinking of the omega as "kid" even though he looked maybe three or four years older than Tony.
Being an Alpha, Natasha could smell him; he didn't smell like sex.  But he and Bucky had been together the better part of the day. Who knows what they'd gotten up to?  Their bond was stronger. That much was obvious.
Steve whimpered as Tony began to mouth at him in earnest. They didn't do this to often, or rather...Tony didn't too often to him. But Steve
He downed another drink before he felt wobbly and confident enough to go down and face his childhood friend.
"Break anything and I will light you on fire," Iron Man threatened. He waved a hand, bringing up several holographic screens around the workbench that the murder bot had been placed on.
Peter shrugged. "I want to help take her down. Besides, where else am I supposed to go? Stark took my memories. I don't even know my last name. Much less, where my home would be. Or was, if it's even still there."
"Weird..." Peter stared at his reflection for a minute before speaking again, "where are we? Do we live here?"
"Where is the Man of Iron?" Thor demanded, holding his hammer with both hands. "Who are you really, he who is not Tony Stark?"
Strange as well. But it is the future after all. Howard Stark must have something to do with that one.
"Nothing. C'mon, we're falling behind." His hand drifted over Tony's arm as he turned and walked away. Tony fell into step behind him.
"No, I got this!" Spider-man made for the door only to be tackled by Clint. "Oof!" Spider-man got his arms up under himself and pushed Clint off, flipping him around and putting him in a headlock.
Tony took a defensive stance. He held his arm out, and Steve watched wide-eyed at the prosthetic shifted. The metal plates gliding apart and blue light poured out of the gaps. The smaller parts of his hand moved at the same time, spinning and forming a barrel around the repulsor. Tony didn't aim the weapon at Steve, but the threat was still clear. His eyelid shutters spun tightly as if he was zeroing in on a target.
"That was reckless! And stupid!" Bucky said to Iron Man as soon as everyone got back to the compound.
Tony set the bowl in his lap and looked around the room curiously. His hair had grown out a bit, a few strands falling into his eyes when he turned his head. The bedroom was minimalistic. White walls, gray bedsheets, matching curtains. Some weird abstract painting on the far wall. There was an even weirder abstract sculpture on the sleek brown dresser. It was made of sticks that were rotating around each other. Tony never understood the appeal of modern art. And that sculpture, in particular, was ticking him off. Why the fuck was it moving like that? "Where am I?"
On screen, the two groups seemed to have come to some sort of agreement. The camera panned out to show the police were backing off. The paramedics who had just arrived went about tending to the deceased. Captain America pulled Spider-man aside and spoke to him for a solid minute before the arachnid retreated to the Quinjet.
"It's going to be alright. Everything's going to be alright." Steve gave him a warm smile. "When we get out of here I'm going to take you somewhere special. I don't know where yet. So I'm open for suggestions."
"Three? I thought it was four. I must have miscounted. What day is today?" Tony retrieved his bowl and settled back against the mountain of gray pillows.
Bucky felt guilty every time he looked at Steve. Steve told him everything. He had trusted Bucky with his feelings for Iron Man, and now Bucky was hiding the biggest secret of all from Captain America. Steve was a generally happy, upbeat person. But Bucky knew him well enough to know that he was not happy. Not completely. Steve was lost and confused. Steve needed to know the truth. He deserved to know the truth. The fact that Iron Man was cuddling Steve at this very moment bothered Bucky. How much longer was Tony planning on keeping this up? Was he going to allow a relationship between him and Steve to happen? Without the other ever knowing the truth?
Hulk growled, slowly turning to look at the person who dared shoot him in the back. Happy Hogan stood several yards away, gun raised and looking angrier than Peter ever thought possible.
Tony opened his eyes to see the suit's hand wrapped around Peter's throat. The tasers in the suit's finger tips activated.
Iron Man connected to their comms, "you could use a bit more firepower." He heard Bucky and Rhodey protesting, but opted to ignore them. He nodded to the two men next to him before leaping into the fray. The aliens barely stood a chance against War Machine. And with Iron Man at his side, the battle wasn't going to last much longer.
Iron Man flew over her head, tackling the bot closest to her. He tried ripping it apart, expecting the metal to be just as flimsy as the last Iron Man look-alikes. But Obadiah had gotten his hands on the same titanium alloy Tony used. Iron Man's fingers scratched uselessly against the bot's armor. The other bot clawed at Tony's faceplate.
"That doesn't mean anything!" Clint yelled back. "That bot will flirt with anything that moves, and he makes the most dick jokes out of all of us, so I don't see why friends with benefits is all that far-fetched!"
"That...that wasn't me, I swear it wasn't..." Iron Man's voice shook out. None of the Avengers tried to defend him this time.
It was Rhodey who approached Steve one evening, telling him that Tony had lifted the lockdown and that now might be the best time to talk to him.
Spider-man looked around the room at his family, doing a head count just to put his mind at ease. Clint was laying on one of the beds, with Natasha sitting cross legged next to him. Steve was sitting on the couch with Sam, talking in hushed voices. Rhodey was messing with the TV, and Vision hovered in the corner. And Tony...
Tony flinched at his words. "You're not the revenge type, Pete. If you go through with this and survive...you won't be the same person you were before."
Tony didn't bat an eye when Peter hurried into the lab. The younger man was wearing his spider-man costume, sans the mask. It was only when he heard the wallcrawler rummaging through a pile of scrap metal that Tony finally set down the repulsor he was working on and looked over at him. "Lose something?"
"Oh hell..." Tony groaned. There was a gaping hole in the animals head. But it wasn't dead. The buck snorted and charged once more. Thor threw himself against the animal, wrapping his arms around its neck and forcing it to the ground. The buck thrashed in his hold and managed to throw the god off, nearly skewering him on the antlers in the process. Thor glanced back at the sound of water splashing. Two more bucks were running at them. These ones bigger than the first.
Bucky watched them from a distance. He felt sick whenever he looked at the oil. Another second with that rope around Tony's neck and that oil would've been blood. Bucky shuddered. He didn't want to think of the injured man trapped in the armor. Not right now. "How are we going to help Tony without Steve knowing?" Bucky whispered to Rhodey.
" Bucky shook his head, "And I don't know if I should be apart of this team. You guys are like a family. A family that I don't really have a place in. I'm trying my best to socialize. Cause that's what Steve wants. He wants me to be friends with everyone like he is. And I want that too. But I'm bad at socializing and everyone here is kinda intimidating," Bucky's eyes flicked around the room nervously. "And like I said, you guys were already a family long before I got here. Even if I do get closer to everyone, it still won't be the same."
"This morning, one of his enemies captured him and gassed him with something that messes with his spider sense. He attacked us this morning, too, thinking we were his enemies." Steve explained.
Tony stumbled into the lab around noon. He found Peter asleep at one of the work tables. Papers and small mechanical parts were strewn around him. "You need to stop pulling all-nighters, kid," Tony sighed. He decided to pick the web-slinger up and take him to his actual bedroom. Tony had plans to work on his new suit today and didn't want the sound to wake Peter up. It took a few tries, but Tony managed to lift Peter into his arms. The kid didn't way much, which worried him, but Peter had always been on the small side, so he tried not to think about it.
"Yeah, Tony really has his heart set on my taking over Stark Industries," Peter looked down at the half eaten sandwich in his hands. "We figured it would be best if I just started working for the company now." It wasn't a complete lie. Tony's intentions for the future of his company were clear. But Peter still hadn't taken him up on the job offer.
"Food fight!" Thor brought one of his fists down on the table, smiling around his mouth full of food.
"Anything for you, Steve," Tony smiled softly behind his helmet. The last forty-eight hours had been absolute hell, with the entire team scrambling to find their missing leader. Iron Man sent out a signal to the rest of the team, letting them know he had found Steve and that he would be bringing him back to the compound shortly.
"Protection from what? We aren't a threat to your kid," Clint said, carefully setting the arrow on the coffee table.
"I'm going to rip you limb from limb. I'll leave your head in one piece, though. So you can watch me kill your precious Avengers. Let you watch as I bash their skulls in."
Back at the compound, the rest of the team was scrambling to get on the quinjet. They had been called to battle by Steve less than ten minutes ago. Suddenly, there was a loud bang and a roar of an aircraft. Iron Man sailed overhead and landed on the steps of the medical building with a loud metallic thud.
A lockdown warning alarm blared throughout the hangar. Red lights flashed above them as the heavy metal doors slid shut. Extra plates of metal slid over the windows and exits, reinforcing any escape routes. The main lights shut off, switching to the emergency lights that the lined the floor.
"You look a lot like him," Steve commented, pointing at Richard. The older Peter got, the more and more he looked like his father. But he was also becoming more like Tony, which Steve always found amusing.
"We can't do that. Especially not without all the facts," Steve reminded him. "Also there's the other guy we still have to worry about..." Bruce was starting to look a bit green around the edges. "Tony, stay with Peter. Keep him safe if Wanda shows up." Steve finally let go of Tony. "I'll let SHIELD know of the situation.
Peter wasn't sure when he had fallen asleep. But the next thing he knew he was waking up in a blanket nest on the floor. Steve and Tony slept peacefully on either side of him. Tony had his back pressed up against Peter's own. Steve rolled over, slapping Peter in the face with his arm. Peter shoved the Avenger off and sat up. A single beam of moonlight drifted through the drapes and landed on Sam, who was asleep on the couch. Rhodey reclined in the armchair and the Vision floated silently in the corner. His eyes were closed, but Peter wasn't sure if the android was actually sleeping. Natasha and Clint were nowhere in sight, Peter assumed they were sharing the bed in the other room.
"You made Ultron based on your own brain, right after going through extreme emotional trauma. Why the fuck do you think he's aggressive?" Bruce spat. Tony flinched. The scientist took a deep breath, "Sorry, I didn't mean to snap at you. Seriously, Tony, why did you think this would be a good idea?"
"We shouldn't do anything until we know for sure that Osborn has Peter." Steve retorted. "We can't just hand over a dangerous weapon!"
"Where are we going?" Peter looked up at the Captain. Steve hadn't said a single word to him since they left the kitchen. They had left the main part of the building and were heading towards the hanger that houses the Quinjet and other planes.
Tony glared at her. She was the only Avenger who knew the true purpose of the reactor, thanks to her time pretending to work for him. "If I can find the right tools I should be able to fix this," he tapped the reactor. "We'll worry about it later, though. Right now we need to rescue the princess."
Michelle and Ned had worried themselves sick trying to get ahold of him all night, and practically attacked him the moment he snuck through the bedroom window. The three ended up falling asleep on the bed in a massive heap of limbs and awkward cuddling.
Natasha clenched her fist. She took a deep breath, trying to remain calm. "You can't just give a child an Iron Man suit and expect everything to be fine. You better call your son right now-"
"People inject me with whatever gets the best results. Whatever makes me less human than I already was! Whatever they want me to be! They just keep fucking it up!" There was something off about Peter's voice. It was murky. Dark, and threatening.
They ended up walking a few blocks to get hot chocolate. It was almost November, and the skies were covered with threatening gray clouds. Tony wasn't sure if they brought rain or snow. He peeled his eyes away from the sky when he heard Peter hiss in pain.
"You do?" Peter took the other earbud out. The video was still playing, but he paid it no mind. He tried to remember the last time he had given a report to happy. He realized his last one had been two years ago, a bit before the outed himself to the Avengers.
"No. Tony Stark made the one you are wearing now. Another way for him to control you," Wanda explained. "It could have a tracker in it. You don't want Stark to find you, do you?" Peter wrinkled his nose in disgust and took the other suit, marching off behind the stairs, where he could change in privacy. The first thing he noticed when he had the old suit on was the odd bit of paper sticking out of the belt. Peter frowned and plucked it from the fabric. Upon unfolding it, he found it was a photo. It was of him and people who he assumed were the Avengers. And they were playing monopoly? Wanda and Bruce were in the photo as well. It must have been taken before Stark went mad. There was a note on the back, but the message just left more questions than answers.
"Ge-get the suit ready." Tony kicked off the blankets and swung his legs over the side of the bed. His whole body ached. The alarm clock on his nightstand read 4:10 am.
"So, Spidey. We have a mission for you," The Captain leaned forward, folding his hands neatly on the table.
After that, Steve moved in with him and Michelle, unable to keep living in the house Tony had died in. The super soldier serum didn't allow Steve to age like a normal human. If you took out the time trapped in the ice, Steve was in his early sixties, but he looked much younger. He was destined to live a much longer life than a normal human. Going on without his husband was difficult, but Steve managed to keep busy. There was talk of him rejoining the Avengers. Steve needed the distraction but didn't know if he would be able to do it without Iron Man at his side.
Steve kissed his forehead, "I'll be right back." Steve only made it a few feet from the couch before Iron Man jumped up and hugged him from behind. "Anthony," Steve scolded gently.
"PETER!" Michelle screamed. Scarlet Witch floated behind her, crimson energy radiating from her entire body. "You bitch!" Michelle spun around, throwing a punch at the rogue Avenger. Wanda flicked her hand, catching the punch and flinging MJ to the ground. She drifted over the fallen teen and into the school.
"Plus, Peter will be pissed if he finds out we went to the donut shop without him," Tony said when he returned. He plucked a glazed donut from Steve's box. "And if Peter gets a donut, then Clint will want one, and then Sam...slippery slope."
Tony asked about the Avengers. He wanted to know what was happening outside the facility. Tony was in for quite the surprise when they parked him in front of a TV, the team's most recent press conference playing before him. Today was his "healing" day, and they were letting him move about a small section of the facility in a wheel chair. A wheelchair because he had been relieved of his legs yesterday. They watched him like a hawk, but at least he had some freedom to do as he pleased. He gathered from the limited decorations around the facility that it was the holiday season. Perhaps these people were feeling generous and that's why they were allowing him this small freedom.
Obadiah landed in front of them, holding a small remote in one hand. "You remember this, don't you Tony?" He waved the sonic taser in the robot's face. He didn't answer. "Fun times. Fun times. How about you...what do you call sleep? 'Powering down'?" Obadiah chuckled. "Yes. How about you power down,
"She has it out for everyone, don't take it personally," Clint assured him. Tony's sight locked onto him easily. The archer was perched on a rooftop, dealing with the small bots.
"Don't call me a lab rat," Peter snarled. He wished he still had his mask. He didn't like it when his enemies could read his emotions so easily.
Peter grabbed onto Venom's head and shoving him to the ground. He applied a great deal of pressure to Venom's head, trying to crush the skull that wasn't there. His hands dipped into the ink-like substance, tendrils twisting its way up his arms. Peter punched Venom in the face, but instead of making contact like last time, the symbiote momentarily liquified its head, then reformed around Peter's hand, successfully trapping it in the black goo.
Wanda frowned. "Let's move things, along..." She snapped her fingers, sparks flying from the tips. Pointing her fingers at the far wall she snapped them again, sending the sparks shooting right at it.
"This dinner is supposed to be about your anniversary and you're over here getting drunk and flirting with four random women!"
"Steve, I'm not going to leave you," he said softly.  "...what was it we used to say? That... that we'd..."  He fumbled for the words. They were just on the very tip of his tongue.  "...that we'd be together 'til the end of the line?" He gave Steve a weak smile; it felt weird; he was out of practice, making facial expressions like that.  "...ain't no one gonna scare me off. You're stuck with me, kid." He watched Steve longingly on the other side of the glass.
Brennan sighed and pinched the bridge of her nose.  "Have you ever been in a situation where you're feeling low and you can't talk to Tony about it because he's inebriated?"
"...Christ, do you ever turn it off?  They're just pretty flowers.  The only people who are being oppressed by them right now are my gardeners."
"So now what?" asked Clint, managing to navigate the toast around despite Lila's best efforts to grab it.  "Me and Nat know what our next assignments will be, but you... you're on hiatus, yeah? What'll you do?"
He grabbed Steve's hand and kissed it.  He wondered how aware Steve was of his instinctual drive to nurture.  He wondered if Steve read Dr. Frond's books, if he would start noticing it and fight against it.  Tony liked being pampered. He didn't want Steve to stop. But he also didn't want Steve to turn into some mindless zombie like DeSoto.  He liked Steve being a person, with agency, even though that person woke up obnoxiously early every morning and did yoga and shit.
When Tony just opened his chest like that it was incredibly alarming. Steve didn't see how it could possibly be safe but also assumed that Tony knew what he was doing and was considerably less reckless (understandably so) now he wasn't dying. But still, Steve didn't like to be reminded of his mate's fragility. Sure, Tony was practically untouchable in the suit. But the arch reactor would always be a weak point. Steve ripped the one out of Ivan's chest. Sure it wasn't easy and it hurt like hell but he'd done it. And there was plenty of other people out there as strong or stronger than Steve.
"Tony.  Your actions last week were extremely inappropriate.  First of all, you can't kiss people without asking their permission.  Second of all, we are co-workers and our financial entanglements means any sort of romantic relationship would be highly inappropriate.  Third, and most importantly,
Steve shivered as Tony sucked and bit at his ear, trembling beneath as he slowly rocked into his hand. He moaned, pushing his hips up into Tony too and encouraging him to move. "I know it's not a secret that we have sex. But that doesn't mean I should have to try and have a sane conversation with anyone while your dick is up my ass."
Stevie's part," said Tony, still edging through the crowd toward Pepper.  “You’re McCarthy until you prove you can actually do Stevie’s part.”
Steve moved carefully into the room, each movement oddly graceful and thought out as he knelt down in front of Tony. And then he moved to practically bow, his forehead pressed to the floor and his back arched over in an utter gesture of submission. He let his eyes slip shut. Steve exhaled. He didn't feel Bucky's bond, but he felt Tony's. He felt it burning hot inside of him like a furnace. It felt like passion and confusion and fury. Steve wanted to make it clear he was
, from the soft blond hair to the relatively hairless jawline.  (Steve maintained sideburns that had taken him well over eight months to actually grow.)
Rhodey had been here and then left; he was in the kitchen, probably arguing with Pepper and/or Aria about the party.  No
"Well, if you're scared, then maybe don't do it," Steve said and Seven looked at him like he'd just grown a horn out of his forehead.
Kerry scribbled the names onto a sticky note.  "Steve mentioned. We're trying but it's hard. A lot of omegas change names after bonding and then, if they get sent to the camps, get changed again... makes tracking them down hard.  But we'll see what we can do."
"I guess we'll see when the time comes," Steve said, feeling like that was the appropriate middle ground answer. He squeezed Tony's hand again. He could feel that he was uncomfortable.
Bucky eyed the man, lip still curled up, but the man was in a submissive posture.  Bucky was easily the most dominant one there. He eased himself back onto the barstool and turned his attention back to the television to watch Steve longingly.
He went to the bathroom, a bit embarrassed about the hair-ruffle, and began aggressively brushing his teeth.  One hour? Tony could be ready way before that. He was in and out of the shower within five minutes; he put in his contacts and gave his beard a quick trim.  It occurred to him that he didn't need the contacts since he'd be in the helmet most of the night. Oh, well.
"We went to the beach yesterday," explained Tony, calming a little, expecting to see himself at any moment.
than them," Steve breathed. "Please. Don't fight me with this. Just give me this chance. If I get hurt again I won't go on another HYDRA mission, okay? I just want
When Tony woke up the next day, yawning, he took his time in the shower, brushing his teeth and shaving under the warm spray of water, not wanting to face what he was sure was a total clusterfuck downstairs.
"Tiberius Stone," said Phil.  "Head of Status Alliance. Tony's in the kitchen, probably on his second White Russian by now."  He realized what he'd said and added, "Sorry, Steve."
Dr. Brennan was nodding slowly, thoughtfully.  "A break from SHIELD would probably be a good idea.  And focusing on your charity work sounds very fulfilling."  She gave Steve a small smile that was a little crooked. "You know Irshad Nazari of the World Omega Rights Council?  She's fighting for you. And so are the Walkers. The Horseshoe Society is lobbying hard to get you and your friends pardoned."
Every bone in Steve's body wanted to tear downstairs and scream in Mike's face, or go up to DeSoto's Alpha and clock him in the jaw. These Alphas had no love for their partners, not if they resigned them to this kind of fate. Steve felt like he was going to be sick, maybe, and DeSoto being all sweet and submissive for Tony beside him was not helping.
about him. He creeps me out. I told Donner that if he ever wanted to leave him and wanted support, he should call me straight away. I hope he does call."
His ribs were bruised and his neck... dark, thick, finger-shaped bruises arched around the back of his neck. They were an ugly purple color. Steve trembled when he looked in the mirror.
"N-no," sniggered Tony, shoving Gleason's hand away.  He cleared his throat, trying to regain his composure.  "Pepper, turn around, I'm pulling out my dick."
Sure enough, back in Tony's home, those watching the monitors were ashen-faced.  But it had nothing to do with the money.  Seeing Donner so cowed and vulnerable was terrible; Pepper had a strand of hair in her mouth and was chewing it thoughtlessly; Happy had a hand on her shoulder but was visibly tense; Aria had pulled out a cigarette and was clearly hoping Tony might bend the rules about smoking in the house for her so that she could light it; Tony's arms were crossed and he was jiggling one leg impatiently, a look of disgust on his face.
Tony frowned.  He hoped Clint had the decency not to say anything to anyone.  Or that he'd been too drunk to remember.  Tony didn't want to have to answer any of SHIELD's questions about it.  An omega with a mark was like a woman with a big diamond engagement ring; everyone reacted with enthusiasm.  But an Alpha with a mark... well.  That was just wrong.
They headed downstairs. Fortunately another couple got into the lift with them so it wasn't as awkward as it could have been. Steve was getting almost nervous at the thought of talking to the omegas up for auction. How the hell was he supposed to convince them they were better than all this when he had a whole night with DeSoto and couldn't?
Tony's eyes narrowed at the look of concern Steve shot his way.  He could feel his heart pounding uncomfortably in his chest.  He didn't like how intuitive Steve was, didn't like how the other man was reading him like a book.
He chewed slowly, mulling it over.  He hoped wherever Bucky was, he was looking at the photo of Tony holding Steve and felt fucking scared.  Tony's next suit would be better than ever.  He would never admit it to Steve but part of his desperation to get to work and to improve his design was that he now had something worth fighting for, worth defending.  As surely as omegas in heat built nests, Tony, a newly-bonded Alpha, felt compelled to protect.  But he wasn't going to waste his time whacking a punching bag.  No, Tony knew his strength was his intelligence and his engineering ability, and he was going to milk that for all it was worth.
"It is appreciated," said T'Chaka.  "I wished to see you, in person, to tell you that I do not hold you accountable... I know that your weapons were never sold to our troubled neighbors, and that you have, in recent years, stopped their development and production."
Steve's eyes flitted up to Tony's face in recognition. 2010. Malibu. His Alpha. He let out a ragged breath. His chest was still falling and rising too quickly but Steve was beginning to regain the feeling in his ankles and wrists and neck, the pins and needles buzz under his skin slowly fading. He let his head loll back against Tony's chest, eyes half open as he focused on breathing. Jesus. How embarrassing. Steve couldn't even hold a phone conversation with Fury about it.
"It is.  Inducers were banned by the Geneva Convention and they're illegal.  You want to see chaos? Throw a half-dozen omegas in heat onto a battlefield and watch a couple hundred Alphas go feral.  It's not pretty. Come on, let's move," said Natasha grimly.
"Can't you just... tell him to back off?  Reject him? Pepper said you get to choose.  Right? That's the whole rage nowadays, omegas choosing their mates.  Can't you... mentally... just say no?
"You can have coffee after you've saved your life, Mr Stark," Coulson said from where he was watching next to Clint and Nat, his hands clasped neatly before himself.  "But considering you did not sleep last night, caffeine will only serve to exhaust you further." Phil, the king of passive aggressive. Steve sometimes thought it would just be politer if he just said 'no' once in a while.
Tony rose, nearly falling over because of his injured leg, and limped over to the vase to move it.  He didn't want to have to look at them.  He would get rid of them as soon as possible.
"Killing him won't change what he did," Steve said calmly and suddenly he twin looked furious. Steve straightened up.  "Killing Johann Schmidt just made me more like him. I enjoyed doing it but it wasn't a good feeling."
Actually, that had all been addressed in Frond's book.  They were evolutionarily designed to be fucked, to get pregnant, to have babies.  When they were in heat, they wanted one thing, and that was completely natural. Tony shoved the thought aside; he hated how Frond managed to make such a convincing argument for treating them like shit.
If Donner went back to Gideon after this Steve wasn't sure he would cope. He was pretty sure he'd have to break something big, maybe a car or something...it would make him angry beyond words. It would break his heart. How much pain had Donner endured at the hands of all these Aces? Or had they used the glands behind Donner's ears so he wouldn't feel it? Steve wasn't sure which alternative disturbed him more. Shit. He actually was angry crying now. He thought this night would be happy...or at least offer a sense of relief. Right now Steve just felt like a big fat failure.
The longer Tony waited the more Steve began to anticipate what was coming, his mind racing with possibilities. The collar was still a little cool on his neck despite Tony warming it up, almost pleasantly so. And the weight around his neck was familiar and possessive. Steve exhaled softly, feeling the press of metal against skin.
"And what about when you were twenty, or thirty, or thirty-five?  What did you do then, huh? Throw lavish parties and release sex tapes and see how many bunnies you could fit into one Jacuzzi?"
Felt what?  He couldn't put it into words.  But he'd felt fear, fear and hurt, and it was definitely not his own, and he could smell Steve's uneasiness.  He was in Steve's lap before he could stop himself, covering the other with his body, nuzzling comfort into his neck.
After she'd left he'd grappled with his feelings, then been hit with such a sense of panic that he was overwhelmed by it.  He didn't remember crawling under the bed or shielding his head. He just remembering babbling about Germans and trying to figure out where the hell his extra clips were, which made no sense.  Maybe he was quoting
"Sleep well," Steve told his mate softly, moving to sit by him in bed, Steve running his hand through his Alpha's hair.  He petted Tony to sleep and Tony drifted off easily despite the heat on his neck.
Steve was tight from his release, but still soaking wet, and the moment Tony pressed into him, Steve's body responded; Tony pushed the head in, moaning at how smoothly the shaft slid in; beneath him, Steve was whimpering and writhing and had torn a hole into the sheets from clenching them.  "You want my knot?" asked Tony, probing him. "You want it, omega?" He pressed in; Steve's body shuddered, clearly wanting to please.
"Why don't you ever wear clothes?" demanded Rhodes, shoving Tony off of him.  "And why the hell do you have an erection, Jesus..."
"Oh my moms love her to pieces," Aria hummed, finishing her espresso. "Right. Let me know if you chance your mind about interviews, or modelling; I'll just try and keep the shit storm at bay so you guys can enjoy your quiet time."
Pepper stormed after him.  Barred from the garage, his normal go-to sanctuary, Tony was heading for his second-favorite hole, the second-floor lounge.  He entered, but it reeked like Steve; this was where they had nested on the sofa.
Tony's fingers were rough and warm in his hair. It made him shiver as he tugged against his hair lightly. Steve still didn't speak. He just savoured the feeling of Tony's fingers in his hair, stroking gently. He didn't have words for this moment- he just knew Tony was going to be okay. That was all that mattered.
While Pepper had offered to take Tony, Happy was left to wrangle Steve.  With some awkward coaxing, he helped Steve get dressed. He'd drunk almost all the water in his cabin over the space of the journey; Happy grabbed the last few water bottles before helping Steve to the car.  Steve was panting and sweating like he'd just eaten a hot pepper.
Natasha let out a long, low sigh.  "...fine, whatever. It's nothing personal, Tony, it's just that... well... actually it
They took the blood first, and then Clint helped Steve walk to the bathroom so he could pee and they could collect a sample.
Tony began giggling.  "Who, Sam? Yeah, he's an Alpha who likes Alphas.  You're single, right? Play your cards right and you might be able to get a free meal."
There were a few clanks.  Across the room, the torso of a suit without arms or a lower half was hung from the ceiling by chains bolted to the concrete ceiling; wires like viscera were trailing out of the suit's interior.  It looks rather like a person on a meat hook and it was unsettling.
"...I missed sex," he admitted quietly.  "I missed boring, missionary-style-before-bed sex with my omega.  I missed breakfast the next morning and accidentally breaking furniture and ruining the sheets.  God, Stevie, I
"Well, maybe I'm entitled to a pain attack.  My work is compromised and I can't go down to the shop and my mate is bonded to another Alpha who can apparently hijack his brain and try to kill me."
Steve's calm proclamation settled into the apartment like a heavy blanket of dust, muffling everything, stilling time.
fingers," Steve mumbled in agreement against the floor, his eyes half open. "Your stomach is empty right now, Tony.  A sandwich with...something would be great," he hummed. Pepper began taking cheese and ham and pickle out of the fridge, making sandwiches for each of them. She placed a banana and apple on Tony and Steve's plate too, and grabbed Phil the bunch of grapes from the fruit bowl.
The colonel came back with a phone pressed to his ear.  "I'm on the phone with Councilwoman Hawley. No extraction of Steve Rogers was ever cleared by the WSC.  Clearly this was a big misunderstanding. Rogers, Stark, you two are free to go. Malick, Rumlow, the council has requested that you stay for questioning."
Steve had no idea what Tony was talking about with the girl, he was just glad it was stopping her from trying to seduce them. He was very weirded out by the whole experience. He was expecting to see miserable omegas, who were desperate to leave. But she had been confident, almost peachy. She had seemed, well, very much for it.  Then again, who knew what she'd been through.  If HYDRA could brainwash Bucky the way they had, why couldn't Athena be brainwashed, too?
"No, it's fine... take Steve... I just need to go do something real quick, get some fresh air... please, Pepper, I gotta, he got me all worked up, you don't know what it's like..." begged Tony.  He was itching to leave, itching to go do something wild and reckless.  Adrenaline was coursing through his veins and if he didn't leave he was positive he and Justin would end up in a fight before the end of the day.  It didn't help that the faint aroma of an omega in heat was floating around the room.  Tony doubted Justin would have had the balls to touch Steve at all if it weren't for that.
Tony slung an arm around Steve's shoulders.  It was the first time they'd touched since Monaco; Tony was tipsy and when he was buzzed, he always got a little more touchy-feely.
"Maybe I've said that before.  I dunno.  ...about tomorrow, Cap.  Look.  I want us to be on the same page.  I don't want to hide anything.  If we walk around together, being us, people are going to talk.  I want to just go ahead and quash any rumors right out of the gate.  I want to get up on stage, announce it, and be done with it.  It'll be better than letting everyone say, are they, aren't they, you know?  Are you okay with that?" asked Tony.  He leaned on to Steve's arm, snuggling up to the larger man.  Steve's arms were huge; Tony had never felt self-conscious about his biceps, but Steve was like a bodybuilder and Tony was struck, once again, with how strange it was, this well-muscled omega, this man that smelled so submissive but had such a strong jaw and powerful arms and commanding gaze.  It was at times unnerving.  Tony had seen some of the news in passing.  There was a lot of support: people saying that Steve was brave for coming out as omega, people saying that this was going to help status rights and get omegas more respect than ever before.  But there were also people saying Steve was a freak of nature, and they weren't far off from the truth.  It was his posture, his look... his total lack of submission.  Steve was clearly a confident individual.  Aside from his smell, no one would associate him with omegas.
"I don't want it back. In fact, I barely remember what's in there. Probably best if it's burnt," Steve said simply, sounding almost...embarrassed? Tony knew full well he hated other people seeing his art. But he'd been foolish enough to leave it behind in the first place. He certainly hadn't wanted HYDRA to come across it either. And he knew that sketchbook was full of a lot of bad things- a lot things in there probably showed just how 'on the edge' he'd been. Peggy always knew that when he started drawing Schmidt, it was bad.  She was the only one he showed his sketchbook to after he'd liberated Bucky's camp.  The nightmare of seeing Schmidt, and all those dead men... there had been a lot of dark sketches in his journal after that.
Steve was already storming into the hallway, chucking his shield like some sort of oversized novelty frisbee.  Sam was shooting.  Guards were shooting.  And Tony was raising the heels of his hands and shooting, too, shooting people he didn't know, killing them personally.  Which, in a way, was better than the alternative, which was designing weapons to send to kill people
Bucky tore down the hall, cradling Steve in his arms; one of the guards was pulling out a gun, but the other one elbowed him, hard.
Tony looked thoroughly shocked at being said no to, but before he could protest, a doctor, followed by two residents, came in.
Steve glanced at the uniform in the closet and his chest burned with the overriding feeling of shame that he felt. He suddenly realized he was an international news story; had Peggy heard about this? What did she think? Jesus. He'd disappointed her. He'd let her down...and that hurt more than anything else. Steve hadn't realized he'd been standing in the doorway with a pair of trousers in his hands for over two minutes until he was pulled back by the sound of Tony's voice.
"Please stop calling it a visit," Steve mumbled. He visited Peggy. He visited Natasha and Clint. He didn't visit people and then put people into cryo cells.
Tony's jaw tightened a little more as Steve ran his fingers over his face.  "We're both sterile, Steve.  Or we're... supposed to be."  He huffed a little and shifted on top of Steve, unwilling to get off of him.  The idea of another Alpha out there, going after him...
Tony tossed the newspaper aside.  "I gotta work on the suit," he announced, standing.  "Don't bug me."
Tony forced himself to loosen his grip on Steve.  "...sorry about your shirt," he added grudgingly, shifting Steve in his arms.
Tony groaned when Steve nudged him.  "Five more minutes," he mumbled automatically, yanking the sheet over his head.  Tony had a personal rule against getting up before eight.  He could tell that whatever hour it was, it was early.
But he didn't blame Steve; how could he?  He'd seen the exhibit; everyone thought he was dead, and he'd known when he was shipped off that Steve might take a war Alpha.
"I know," he said, trying to not to sound defensive.  "...there isn't even any landscaping outside the gates.  I just... I want the crowd to go away already.  Don't these people have jobs?"
"I'm sorry, I don't think I follow," said Tony, struggling to maintain his calm, sarcastic tone, even though his hands were shaking.  "Maybe you could, um, tell me all about that, we could do brunch, meet up, you know, work out the deets..."
He and Morgan picked their way across the rubble, Tony holding her hand to help stabilize her, and he felt miserable because Steve wouldn't need that hand; Tony would offer it and Steve would laugh but he'd be fine on his own.  Morgan was so tiny, like a little sparrow, a porcelain doll, the opposite of Steve's heavy, broad-shouldered self.
"After a lengthy probation, about a year, we'll be sending Barton to Mojave, and Romanov to India.  They need to be separated. The Council doesn't want pair bonds working together anymore. Wilson'll be stationed at the VA in D.C., and you'll be with me.  Stark and Rogers are on their own. Can't use them anymore for SHIELD." Fury's face was surprisingly serene as he laid out all these plans. "Hill. How's that hand?"
The question seemed to half go over Steve's head. "I mean that's why everyone got upset when I was force bonded, wasn't it? Because 'Captain America' got fucked over by Russia."
Steve looked up when Happy and Tony made it into the bedroom, Happy holding two water bottles under his arm. "Make sure you both drink one before you go to bed," he said, sounding far too cheery for a sober man at three in the morning.
Tony felt Steve's body tense and clench and harden all at once; a moment later Tony's mouth was filling with Steve's seed.
They'd been standing there for at least thirty or forty minutes.  Tony seemed oblivious to the cold. Out on the path, Happy had turned the car back on for the heat; inside it, Pepper was tapping away at her tablet, keeping up with her e-mails, and Happy was reading a tabloid.
Steve grabbed Tony's phone and then handed it to him. "Here, I got you some water too. Have it before the coffee," he said, pushing the glass over. "You were pretty far gone last night. You fell out of bed at one point."
"But we're friends?" asked Tony, lifting his head up and looking at Ty.  "You're not mad at me anymore for what happened?"
When Tony appeared he let out a breath he hadn't realised he'd been holding. He let out a trembling exhale.
this omega  He wanted something from him, and he couldn't really articulate what, but he knew this was something he'd been missing and now that he'd found it he couldn't stand to let it go.
"I mean, I don't know much about them. Like the suppressants stuff. No one's ever even mentioned it to me. And unless people do I just have no idea," Steve tried to explain. Omega problems didn't make into national headlines very often, especially before he came out.
I can't do a Jamaican accent.  Anyway, I Anne Franked Bunny for... well... I guess the last thirty-five years.  Aaliyah was right that Dad had a lot of ideas about what an Alpha should be, what a boy should be.  And the funny thing is, if he had given it just one more year, I probably would have given up Bunny anyway.  I was really into electronics and stuff, not really stuffed animals. Actually, Bunny might literally be the only one I ever had.  But... but I guess the point I was going for was that... that since I met you, I changed a lot of my own views about... stuff. Like masculinity, dominance, what makes a 'good' Alpha... and... stuff like that.  And I thought it was time for Bunny to come out of hiding."
"...so good..." mumbled Tony.  He started to reach for Steve but his hand dropped and he went back under.  Tony's sleep schedule was non-existent; he worked his body to the limit, then crashed hard, sleeping for long blocks of time.  He'd always been fairly bipolar about rest, and since Afghanistan, that dichotomy had increased significantly, because crashing helped keep him from having dreams.
But Tony looked nervous. Phil was right. He was afraid and rightly so. Steve swallowed and resisted the urge to reach out to him again. He wasn't his alpha, he didn't have a right...
"...it's beautiful, isn't it?" said Clint, staring out at the fields.  "My own persona Eden. Peaceful. Off the grid. No politics here. No danger.  Just my family." He took a sip from his mug.
"If you needed to look at our security footage you could've just asked," Harry frowned at the pile of unconscious guards. "Spider-man is a good friend of mine. Just have him text me next time you need something." Harry was on of the few people outside the Avengers who knew of Peter's alter ego. Harry had even been over to the tower a few times when he and Peter were still teenagers. Tony never trusted Osborn's son, although he kept his feelings to himself.
Spider-man's lenses narrowed. "Not cool, dude. Not cool." The Avengers turned and went back inside. Spider-man followed them without hesitating. He took off his mask once they were inside.
Bruce made a choking noise and collapsed. Peter stared down at him, shoulders squared and head held high. There was absolutely no emotion on his face as we watched his torturer writhe in pain. "I want you to
The robot tilted his head and shrugged, "today's a bad day." He tapped his right thigh with his index finger. "Things aren't working quite right."
"Boys!" Natasha threw down her knife and fork. Peter and Clint took their seats, afraid of the Widow's wrath. Steve tried to free Clint with a pocket knife, but it didn't work. So the Archer had to sit in silence until the webbing slowly started to melt away after a few hours. Peter had a vial of solvent in his pocket and could've dissolved it at any point. But where was the fun in that?
Steve held up his hand and shook his hand, "don't. You'll just give them both more juice." Thor reluctantly lowered his hammer. Steve looked away when Iron Man's right arm was sliced off by a laser. Iron Man didn't seem to notice and kept fighting.
Tony wasn't surprised to see the mess Spider-man and Captain America had made of the front lawn. The perfect sheet of white that had fallen last night had been beaten to high hell. Half built forts dotted the lawn. Tony trudged over to a snowman.

"I understand Steve is good for him," Aria said, taking another small sip of wine. It was sweet and smooth and ran down her throat pleasantly. "But it's Steve I'm worried about, I mean obviously I'm bias...as are you. We're allowed to play the favourites game a little, I think. Steve is a huge personality. He's 'captain America.' But on bad days he still feels like he's in the forties and sometimes he needs Tony to remind him he's a
Tony set down the chair and then shielded his eyes against the sun.  He waved to Happy; Happy waved back.
"...you know, it's weird that we celebrate birthdays.  Every year we're just... closer to... you know.  You ever... ever think about that?" asked Tony, looking up at the sky.  The light pollution in Malibu made most of the constellations invisible, but over the ocean, some stars were out.  In the distance, freighters moved slowly, small specks of light in the dark water.  It was impossible to tell where the line between sea and sky was in the dark.  Far below them, waves crashed against the cliffs, their sound almost drowned out by the loud electronic music floating in from the mansion.  "...like... Stan... if it were, you know, your very last year alive, hypothetically, and you
Steve leaned down and nipped at Tony's jaw softly, an intimate gesture. "Is it...is it weird if kinda like your age?" he asked in a murmur. "That you're...you know." He blushed a little. "Experienced."
He leaned into Tony's touch and nodded. "Yours. Wanna be so good for you Tony," he whispered as they both moved back to slump against the side of the bench in the water. They both looked wrung out. Steve couldn't wait for sleep.
Tony only knew the guy's name was Bucky because Steve had been begging him, by name, to take his hands.  And now, thanks to Natasha, he had a last name: Bucky Barnes.  Kind of a dumb name, really.  Tony had the same nagging feeling that he'd seen that guy on the train before.
Steve's brows rose at the last one. Aria just snorted when she saw it and patted his arm. "Kinda lame that's the worst they could come up with," she said and he just hummed in agreement.
"That simulator's been approved by the highest authorities," said Sitwell defensively.  "Councilman Pierce--"
Within a few hours Tony was reduced to a bruised, quivering mess.  His knot was rubbed raw. He'd gone from ecstasy to weariness to
Tony could not fucking believe this.  They weren't even in the front door and already they were getting grief.
Pepper was still trying to talk to him but a moment later she was getting dragged into the crowd by a man Steve suspected might have been Anderson Cooper.
Steve reached a hand up, brushing against his thigh before he moved to play with Tony's balls just liked he asked, sucking as he drew back off. He let let the wet tip rest against his lips, mouth slightly parted. This is what good omegas did. Steve was getting hard himself now and wet between his legs.
Steve sighed and stared down at his hands in his lap. He pushed his palms together. They were sweaty, making him grimace. Steve was quiet for a while, thinking through what she'd said. His mind drifted back to the war of the forties, of all the terrible judgement calls he'd had to make. Steve swallowed thickly.
Steve remembered the story about Ty. Of all of the stories from Tony's childhood that one stuck with him, how could it not? It was a sinister thought. A camp made to change an omega into something else. Whatever did they do to him there to make him smell so strange? Steve felt an odd shiver run down his spine. He wanted to know but he also knew he had no real right to ask.
The moment he commanded Bucky to drive, Bucky obeyed; he stomped on the gas, cutting off another car and earning a loud, angry honk from the driver he'd nearly hit.
Steve, in the meantime, still had his head in Tony's lap. He opened his eyes slowly, looking up at Tony with a glassy expression. He looked pale. "I t-think he's going to kill me," he whispered, soft enough so only Tony and Natasha could hear. And for the first time since Steve had met Tony, he actually sounded afraid.
"So..." Steve rolled onto his front and crossed his arms underneath his head, looking up at Tony through his lashes as he stretched out like a cat might. "A nap?"
"I'll them know," Happy said, pulling out his phone to quickly send off a text (to presumably Pepper). Steve imagined her and Aria would be catching the plane back with them. Steve couldn't
"Rogers.  Don't forget your pills," groaned Phil from inside his little sanctuary.  Tony could tell his teeth were clenched against the pain. How the hell did omegas do this every six months, he wondered.  Even if it only lasted a few days, it was still awful.
Steve was half-way through unbuttoning his shirt when Tony crawled on top of him. He sighed fondly and let it happen, Tony's body a warm and comforting weight. It was nice hearing it from Tony, even if rationally Steve knew that today could have definitely gone a lot worse than it did. He was just relieved it was over; now it felt like he could carry on living his life again.
"Needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few," said Joey with a shrug.  "Me, I don't lose any sleep over it. HYDRA's done a lot of bloody damage, haven't they, committed a lot of murders and even worse.  Either of you ever hear of Project Guiding Star? They had men so brainwashed that they'd drown themselves if their handler told them to.  Yeah, I'd cut off a guy's hand to stop them. The things they'd done to omegas and mutants and people from third-world countries... they need to be stopped."  Joey gave a small, curt nod.
Steve hummed and got off of the crippled Alpha, standing.  He heard the sound of bullets scattering down the hallway. "I think the guards have caught up," Sam murmured, edging towards the doorway.  "They're probably shooting at that omega kid as we speak."
"OPEN IT!" shrieked Tiberius and Banksy, both wearing identical grins.  Banksy loved scandal, and Tiberius, as Tony's old friend, loved embarrassing him.
"Just...just wanna sleep Tony," Steve mumbled, tugging his mate closer. He tucked his head against the crook of Tony's neck and closed his eyes. This heat didn't feel like the others. Richard had been right, it was...fainter somehow. Steve had a feeling it would only last a few days, if that. They could manage contraception themselves for just a few days. Hopefully. It felt like they needed their own space now.
He got up and limped over to the couch, practically crawling into Steve's lap, wrapping his arms around him.  "All these stupid flowers," he said quietly, his tone affectionate.
"Do you have two collars just so you can bet your omega?" he asked Mike, trying his damnedest not to slur his speech.
.  He no longer cared if the one-eyed man got away or even if the blond died.  He had to save his Alpha.  He needed a distraction.
Steve realised he couldn't even envision Tony being tortured in his head (not that he wanted to, of course he didn't.) But when he mentioned stuff like being water-boarded...it was so passing, so fleeting that it almost skipped through Steve's mind. Tony was an overwhelmingly enthusiastic person, even if he wasn't often all that happy he was often
"Malick wants me to behave, essentially. But I think we have different ideas about 'behaving'," Steve said.
.  Interesting choice.  Thought you were only into betas for some reason.  He was a cute little blondie, wasn't he?"
Steve slumped down against the wall, ignoring the director still as the HYDRA elites walked away, leaving them be. He didn't say anything. He was still silent as he slid down the wall to sit down, his ankle throbbing.
"If I can't get drunk I really don't see the point in putting up with the taste of alcohol," Steve said. He'd never liked it all that much. The burn of whiskey had always made him grimace and pull faces before.  Omegas weren't expected to drink but Bucky liked to indulge him, and his reaction to hard liquor always made Bucky laugh. Not patronisingly, more in an endeared sort of way...
Thinking about it now, knowing that Steve was an omega, it made a little more sense.  Howard treated Tony like a man and an Alpha.  He'd loved Steve and made no apologies for it, but Tony doubted that he'd ever truly respected Steve.
The dance was lovely. That was the only word for it. And when they parted Steve felt a little sad for it.  Or maybe he was feeling Tony's feelings; for some reason, Tony felt oddly nostalgic.
Fun history fact: in the Ming dynasty they had bowls for prostitut's to spit into, and Sappho has handled one in a museum.  - Apollo
"...Steve.  You're a lot bigger than me," said Tony. There was a slight sense of embarrassment, knowing his own omega could easily hurt him, but there'd never been an omega like Steve before.
"...can everyone see the poster?  ...I asked for a projector but, once again, the event coordinator sort of dropped the ball.  This, ladies and gentlemen, is a Punnett square. A basic predictive model of gene inheritance and traits.  Today, over the next hour, I'm going to explain to you how this all works so that if you want to select a good breeder and boost your chances of having an Alpha whelp, you can.  I know most of us here think with our knots instead of our minds--"
"How many camps did Ty say there was left?" Steve asked softly as Happy dropped a bag down in the entrance way, his gaze drifting over the stairwell still full of living, thriving orchids.
Steve and Iron Man were wrapped up in each other's arms. Iron Man's head was tucked against Steve's chest, and Steve had one leg thrown over the bot. The sheets were tangled up in their limbs. Iron Man lifted his head when he felt someone's presence. The two just stared at each other for a several minutes before Iron Man put his head back against Steve's chest.
"I know, I know, and I'm sorry. I'm so sorry Harry." Peter looked him dead in the eye, willing his voice to remain even as he spoke.
"Sure, why not?" Steve allowed himself a small smile. Iron Man had Steve turn around. He looped his arms under Steve's, pulling the super soldier close to his chest.
Clint practically jumped over the table to strangle Peter, who jumped onto the ceiling. Clint grabbed a broom and tried to knock him down.
"Capsicle is an old man," Tony reminded, pointing his fork at Peter. "Honestly, if you hadn't beaten him on the go cart track I would've had to disown you. So good job."
"Osborn has a kid?" Steve didn't like the sound of that. "And you're friends with him? Osborn tortured you, Pete-"
"But it wasn't," Peter said softly. Tony had known his father? Why hadn't he ever mentioned that before?
"He turned back into Bruce and just disappeared into a crowd of people! I don't see Banner anywhere! FRIDAY's scanning everyone but...it's not looking good."
"Incoming, boss!" FRIDAY warned right before a glider slammed into Iron Man's side, sending him flying across the graveyard and crashing into a tombstone. His fist remained firmly clamped around the vial. "Osborn has injected himself with something," FRIDAY reported. Tony got to his feet just in time to see Osborn morph into something grotesque. His features had shifted into something that resembled a goblin, his skin a sickly green. The glider zoomed towards him and Osborn leaped onto it.
"Don't get your panties in a twist, Winter," Tony blasted his way into the secret room that housed rows upon rows of computers. Ancient computers by Tony's standards. Tony almost had a heart attack when he saw the internet explorer icon on one of the screens. Iron Man scanned the room. No guards in sight. No heat signatures. Strange. Tony took a chip out of a compartment in his forearm and plugged it into one of the computers. "Get me everything, Jarvis."
"Hey, hey, shh...I'm awake. I'm right here. It was just a dream, honey. Just a dream." Iron Man tightened his grip on his lover. He rocked back and forth gently, whispering sweet nothings to Steve until he calmed down.
"Well, that too. Iron Man is a good friend of mine, but like you said. He's just a robot. A relationship just isn't possible."
"Exactly." Iron Man got to his feet. "He's dead and someone's using his memory to mess with my head." He looked over his shoulders at the computers, most of which had been destroyed in the battle. "Hydra got ahold of my schematics, somehow. I destroyed all their digital records of it. But they could have more hidden somewhere else." Iron Man clenched his fists. "We need to tell Fury."
Steve hovered in the doorway, staring at Tony. The man was lounging on the couch in the living room, chatting with Bucky. Neither man had noticed Steve yet. And Steve took the opportunity to really
Peter smiled and wrapped his arms around his father in a tight hug. Tony returned the hug, clapping Peter on the back.
"I gave him his powers. What Peter did with them was completely up to him," Bruce didn't seem in the least bit worried.
"I need to convince some people that he is in my possession and that I will kill him if they don't give me what I want," Osborn replied.
"Fine..." Steve put two fingers to his ear when he heard Sam's voice. "No, I'm calling off the search. There's nothing more we can do tonight," he sighed. "Yeah, Sam. I know. We'll just have to wait until they make their next move."
"I see him!" Natasha cut him off. She shot out of an alley on her own bike, getting between Tony and Peter. Tony was forced to slam on his breaks. Up ahead, the teen crossed into the oncoming lane and zig zagged his way through traffic. Peter twisted around to look back at Natasha, who was hard on his heels. Angry horns blared and people screamed when Natasha had to drive on the sidewalk in order to avoid a car.
The vision was about to follow however Bruce called his name. "I need to talk to you." Then adding in a whisper, "in private."
"Peter was definitely at Oscorp last night," Tony reported as he poured himself a drink. The Avengers, minus Peter, were gathered in the lounge. "My suit recorded the footage before Osborn had the tapes wiped. FRIDAY, bring up the file." A hologram materialized over the bar. "There's a five-hour gap between when they went into that room, and when Peter escaped through an air vent."
"They call themselves the Avengers. Don't take them lightly. They will kill you without batting an eye. Here, put this on. It's more...you." Wanda held out Spider-man's classic costume. She had snagged it for him before they left the compound.
Steve nodded, smiling softly at him, "you're definitely Stark's son. Always have to be working on something."
"I doubt they are doing anything to him," Nick Fury crossed his arms. "He should be fine as long as he stays under Wanda's influence."
Slowly, the light faded. The dragon lay motionless on the ground, its head blown to bits. Steve held back the bile in his throat at the such a grotesque sight. The soldier's eyes traveled from the corpse to the person who had just saved his life. "Oh god...TONY!!!"
"I don't get it," Deadpool huffed, putting his head in his hands. He and Spidey had gone on patrol together and were taking a break on a fire escape.
"My name is Iron Man." Bucky's eyes snapped back to Tony, who was so much shorter without his armor. Iron Man was the same height as him and Steve. But Tony was at least five inches shorter than him. "Get out."
Pepper arrived a few hours later. Bruce helped her carry in bags of food, tools, and other supplies. Clint and Natasha had already left to investigate the murders, and it didn't take much to get the rest of the Avengers away from Iron Man. Steve, however, was another story. It was absolute hell trying to get him to leave Iron Man's side.
"I am focussed." Peter snapped. He had been sparring with Thor all morning. Steve was watching them from a safe distance, every once in awhile giving some advice. Although, Peter didn't really need it. Years of being trained by the Avengers had really paid off. The Avengers had recently started keeping a tally of who had won the most sparring matches. And so far, Spider-man was in second place, right behind Iron Man. No matter how hard he fought, he couldn't seem to defeat that man.
For a brief moment, Steve looked taken aback. But then he cleared his throat and put on the same sad look he had been wearing the entire conference. He shuffled the stack of cards in his hands. Tony found that a bit odd. The Captain always spoke from his heart. No note cards required. What had changed? Why was he acting like this? It was baffling. "
"Don't touch me. Please. Just. No one touch me." Peter curled into a tight ball, hiding his face in his knees. His muscles ached. He felt like he really had been torn apart. He shuddered at the feeling of so many bloodied hands grabbing at his body. The Avengers slowly moved away to give the boy space.
"Wanda and Bruce didn't appear to be bad people," Natasha hissed. Peter bristled. "Sorry, little spider. Their names just slipped out," Natasha said quickly. "...point is, appearances mean little when it comes to trust-"
"Go for it," Bucky forced himself to relax. Taking his arm off caused a short burst of pain in the connectors. Bucky tried to convince himself it was like getting a shot. Just a quick prick, and then it's all over. Tony waited until Bucky was completely relaxed before releasing the prosthetic. "Thank you," Bucky said once the issue was resolved and the arm was back in its place.
Steve hurried towards the voice. He found Iron Man leaning against an overturned workbench. "Oh, buddy..." Steve's voice was heavy with sympathy as he knelt down next to his friend. Iron Man's armor was riddled with dents and scratches. The glass casing over his arc reactor had shattered, the light behind it flickering. Part of the faceplate was broken off, revealing the machinery underneath. A blue light shone from Iron Man's eye socket. "Who did this to you?" He gently turned Iron Man's head towards him, trying to get a better look at the damage. Iron Man jerked away.
"Excuse me?!" Iron Man bolted upright, knocking over his chair in the process. All guns instantly pointed at the robot. One of the agents took a step forward, holding an electrified stick.
"So...pretty wild birthday party, huh? Gonna be hard to top next year," Tony commented, earning a small chuckle from Peter. "You doing okay, kiddo?"
"Slow down, Capsicle!" Tony panted, his legs burned as he hurried to catch up with the other man. There wasn't a single cloud in the morning sky. Birds chirped happily as they were slowly awoken by the sunlight. It was still early spring, but Tony could tell today was going to a hot one. The warm breeze ruffled his dark hair, a welcome feeling after the long winter.
"Hey! Stop going for my ribs!" Tony snapped. He was strongly regretting having told Natasha that his ribs were weak. He had told her that so she would avoid them, not so that she would make them her primary target. Didn't she understand that a third of his rib cage was gone? Sure, the artificial metal ribs were built to withstand just about anything, but his human ribs were about as frail as they come.
"Except you did. Remember?" Steve was treading dangerous ground, and he knew it. But he had to put Tony in his place before things escalated between him and Peter. "He still has the scar on his chest-"
"I'm not a murderer!" Tony shouted over the rain. Agents were pouring onto the top deck, this time with weapons capable of matching Iron Man's. An electrified whip circled around his neck, yanking him to the ground. The rope ate through the top layer of his armor. Iron Man fought to stand up, but didn't get very far before a second whip wrapped around his upper body and force him to his knees. The HUD flashed red. Part of the rope managed to slice right through the bicep of the armor, burning Tony's arm and causing him to cry out.
Iron Man's hand twitched, but he made no move to get back up. Captain America rushed over to take Iron Man's place, guarding Spidey as if his life depended on it.
Tony activated his repulsors, shooting out of reach before his attacker could deliver another blow. "Hey, now, big guy." Iron Man held out his palms. This bot looked nothing like the others. It was twice the size of Iron Man, and sporting glowing red eyes. "I'm guessing you're their leader?"
"Leave it to Stark to fuck things up," Clint muttered. He was sitting off to the side, with Natasha checking his ankle.
"FUCK!!" Tony flung his phone at the wall. A moment later it beeped with a new message. Tony hesitated before opening the text. The message showed an image of Spider-man's mask, torn, bloodied and covered with dirt. The left lens was completely shattered. The text under the photo read, 'all I want is the Venom. You have five hours. If I don't get it when time is up, then Queens can say goodbye to their friendly neighborhood Spider-man'
Steve couldn't help but smile warmly at his boys. They were safe. And for now, they were happy. And that was more than enough for Steve. Tony straightened up and blew a kiss at Steve. Peter made a barfing noise.
"Tony? Tony, we've been looking everywhere for you. Are you alright?" Steve tightened his grip on the phone. Bucky shifted from foot to foot nervously. At this point, Natasha and Bruce had made their way over. Natasha moved closer to Steve, worry clouding her expression. "Sweetheart, talk to me."
Tony scoffed at that. They had given their half-assed forgiveness speeches through gritted teeth. He couldn’t tell if it was because they felt guilty themselves, or if they were being forced to forgive him. Either way, he wasn’t convinced. No way he could just walk back into their lives and expect everything to be fine and dandy. He had fucked everything up way too horribly for that to happen. That was part of the reason he had locked himself in his workshop for a week. He didn’t want to confront any of them. Didn’t want to see the looks on their faces. Those looks of disgust had been painful enough the first time around. “Why, though? What changed? Last time I saw you people, you were ready to put my head on a steak.”
Steve took a deep breath and willed himself to move closer to the skeleton. The corpse possessed a shield. It wasn't round like his own, but it would do the trick. Steve dusted the cobwebs from it and slipped it onto his forearm.
Henry watched the scene unfold from his place on the ceiling. His many eyes trained on the Goblin. He didn't fully understand what was happening, but he knew his owner needed help. Images of the Avengers flashed across his mind. The big one with blonde hair. He seemed to be in charge. He would know what to do. What about the one with black hair and the metal exoskeleton? That particular human could get here the fastest. Henry shook himself. He didn't like that one. He hated that human almost as much as he hated the one who shot pointy sticks for fun.
"He says he's done being Spider-man," Tony reported, a lump forming in his throat. Steve watched sadly as Tony smoothed out the spider emblem on one of the suits.
"Or you could bring him back now before he has another panic attack on the same level of the one earlier," Steve pointed out.
"Steve does. He saw you before we had a chance to change you out of your suit," Tony went back to swiping the digital paperwork.
Osborn's face broke into a disturbing smile, "Oh, you won't remember. I can promise you that much." He connected the oxygen mask to a small tank and turned the knobs. Green gas pumped into the mask, filling Spider-man's lungs. Spider-man held his breath and struggled against the restraints even more.
"Cap, we can't find the first aid kit," Bruce reported after a solid ten minutes of searching. Tony was still looking for the backpack that contained his spare reactor. Steve and Natasha were helping look for the medical supplies too, but they hadn't found anything.
"Here, a gift from Pepper," Rhodey set a bowl of chicken noodle soup in Tony's waiting hands. Tony gave a soft "thanks". Rhodey took a seat next to the bed and propped his feet up on the mattress. Tony kept his head down, lazily stirring the soup with a spoon. "Eat."
Steve moved to lie on his back, head tilted up as he studied Tony's face. He knew the curve of his jaw now; he'd drawn it enough times. He admired the curve of his bicep that he'd propped himself up on. Tony was handsome in a rugged kind of way Steve never would be, even with the serum.  He had the naturally masculine features of an Alpha despite being of low dominance.  He reached out without thinking and traced his fingertips around the edge of the reactor with unconcealed wonder in his eyes. "You're going to be okay now, aren't you?" he checked in a whisper.
Tony looked okay. Fury, beside the group of scientists, looked...satisfied. "Everything's good so far, Cap," the director breathed. "Lets just hope there's no unwanted visitors again."
This was the sort of thing that Tony wish had been explained to him.  He didn't know any other Alphas who could--
"Oh.  That.  All good things," agreed Tony.  He hadn't been aware he was getting awarded or that Hammer had an upcoming trial.  He sipped his drink, letting the world soften around him, trying not to think about Steve covered in blood or getting shot at or--
Steve had been more present in the media had Tony had. He'd done plenty of interviews where as Tony had only really done the one on Banksy and Boswell's show with them. He hadn't got his 'side' of the story out yet, so to speak.
"They shoulda left it in the ice where they found me," Steve breathed, words trembling with a kind of resentment. He was just so angry at SHIELD. He never thought he'd be battling old enemies in the new century.
"Maybe one day when it's sunny," Steve murmured, curling an arm around Tony's shoulder as he leaned into him. He sighed softly, his gaze drifting over the horizon and up into the wispy clouds above. It was still mostly a clear sky and it was gorgeous. The light pollution made it hard to see many stars but Steve could still count quite a few.  ...or maybe those were just airplanes. There were always airplanes in the sky in this century.
"It was nothing to do with you," Steve assured him, a smile tugging at his lips. "And I'm not currently speaking to SHIELD right now," he added and sighed. "I found two bugs in my apartment last night after you fell asleep. One was in my
He was in New York.  He'd been on the move continuously since Wanda and Pietro had disposed of him; he went where ever felt right.  His time was dedicated to trying to figure out where Steve was and where Karpov was and who the hell he was. The whole world had a strange, dream-like quality to it, and he floated around searching, feeling like he was trapped in some sort of bizarre waking dream.  Without the medicine, he spent several long nights shaking uncontrollably and vomiting. But sickness, hunger, and cold were not things that could easily stop him. He soldiered on because that was all he could do, all he knew how to do. Giving up or quitting had been programmed out of him.
"Oh.  Right.  Well, go fall in love, then, or sky-dive into an active volcano, or whatever betas do instead of bonding."
"...did you bring him?" asked Fury.  All three of them wore identical masks; there was no hint of sympathy, anger, or anything else.  Just mild, professional detachment. Steve's demands for handing him over had been simple: he wanted Bucky to be safe.  No one in the world could promise that. But Natasha and Fury were the closest there were.
, he thought, even though he knew the bond didn't make them psychic.  But he needed Steve to get the hell away so he could ask Gene about his "services."  Gene was too cool to talk about them in front of Captain America, especially after Steve's outburst the previous day.
"...Brock wasn't in on it, was he?" asked Mackenzie with surprise.  "He's-- he's always struck me as a good guy, we've worked missions together."
Steve stood without a wobble, taking Tony's hand but not putting too much  weight on it. "The kids? They're good..." Steve said, struggling to switch back to what they were talking about before. "Well," Steve glanced back at the kids. He waved. They all waved back. Then he turned to Tony. "I'm going to save all of them--" He raised a hand before Tony could protest. Steve smiled. "But that doesn't require buying a single one of them."
him! In the arm only, but still... he shot him because he was pointing at gun at Charles. Because Charles was running away... to
He showed Tony a blurry picture of a base in a desert; it looked small so most of it had to be underground. "Look familiar?"
The sweat from before wasn't helping. It made Steve's shirt stick to his skin and now the dampness was making him even colder.
Tony looked up, then suddenly seemed to snap back to himself.  "No," he said quickly. "I mean-- I mean sorta-- no." He was actually turning red.  "You can open it upstairs. ...it's just for you. And, um, I guess Donner can see it, too."
By lunch, Lowenstein and five other people had burst in.  Lowenstein was an Alpha dressed in a crisp suit; his associates were three other men and two women, all Alphas as well.  Tony was lounging on the back pool deck; Pepper led him through, past the enormous pile of summonings covering the coffee table.
Two figures appeared in front of the door.  One was unfamiliar, a man in a uniform holding a gun.  The other was very, very familiar.
"Can we-- can we please not talk about him?" asked Donner with a gasp of pain.  "I-- I want my baby to-- to come-- to come with nice things. You know, like... like... rainbows."
before and he'll get annoyed if you walk around without an Alpha? You know how crazy that sounds, right?" Steve sighed. He wasn't getting anywhere like this. "Look, if you can fight already then great. You can show me what you got."
A ghost of jealousy crossed Tiberius's face.  Pepper reached over and laid a hand on his arm.  "I'm sorry, Ty."
"...you watchin' the show?" asked Tony, sounding casual.  He was desperately hoping Sam would say no.
George certainly wasn't immune to the excitement of it all either and appeared to have a spring in his step. He was sucking at a chocolate frappacino quite happily as he walked over, perching on the edge of Kerry's desk. "Hope you don't mind if I cut in? I thought I'd give you a Donner update," he said. "Whilst you're here."
Peter nodded and showed him a picture of Steve and Tony drinking coffee together in the kitchen, oblivious to the fact that they were having their picture taken.
"What gives you the right?" Peter hissed. "What gives you the right to my body? I'm not your fucking lab rat."
"Not you, him-" Tony waved his hand, expecting it to pass through the illusion. Instead, he hit something very solid.
"He asked me not to tell anyone," Bucky kept a passive expression. "I've been trying to get him to tell you all for months."
"Vision. I asked him what happened to the Hulk and he spilled the beans," Deadpool shrugged. "He says everyone else wanted to kill Banner. Even the Vision himself. But you showed him mercy. That's the real reason why they chose you to be the leader of the Avengers, isn't it? Because you're the only good person out of all of us."
Morning rolled around and Peter still hadn't come home. Tony had stayed up all night, working in his lab to distract himself. Around noon he decided to call Peter. It only rang once before Peter picked up.
"You could go without the suit," Bucky nudged his shin. "You don't have to tell them who you are. I can make up some story about meeting you at the PTSD support group I go to."
"Cap!" Equally cold hands pressed against his shoulders, trying to push him back down. He hadn't realized he had been sitting up until that moment. A pair of bright blue eyes hovered over him. The grip on his shoulders tightened. "Steve, calm down, you need to breathe!"
"No!" Bruce said a bit too harshly. He swallowed and lowered his voice, "no. We don't know who we can trust."
Rhodey sighed, "I know. And I don't want Tony getting yelled at as soon as he walks through the door. Which is why I think he should stay here a bit longer. Maybe talk things out over the phone-"
"Of course not. I just hoped it wouldn't have taken you two years to do something about this. The food here is awful," Wanda Maximoff rose to her feet and moved closer to Bruce. "How do you plan on getting me out?"
Bruce handed over a second folder. Inside was a copy of Peter's birth certificate. "I couldn't get the original. For obvious reasons."
"Peter!" Tony wrapped his son in a tight hug. "Meet Mr. America himself. Mr. America, meet Peter," Tony stepped aside so the two could shake hands.
"I know you don't see yourself as a person anymore. But they do. Even if they don't know the truth, they still treat you like a human being. They care about you. And you need to stop worrying them all half to death."
Falcon had snatched Spider-man up by the arms and was now flying straight for the Vulture. "I got Big Bird, you get the girl!" Once they were within spitting distance, Falcon flung Peter at the Vulture. Spider-man threw his arms out and grabbed onto Toome's legs. Falcon flew in circles around the Vulture, the two birds of prey battling it out with their wings. Spider-man tore at the exoskeleton on Toome's legs, ignoring the sparks flying in his face. With a loud metal crunch, Spider-man tore the talons from his left boot.
"Do you have her address?" Piper asked, voice small. Steve was glad to be giving someone good news today.
So you wanted a scenting.  Gotcha. Well, I have two other people who are interested in making his acquaintance as well.  Obviously he's not exactly a virgin, but still, Malick paid seven hundred grand for him, so I'm looking for about half of that, and I should tell you right now that Alderdice offered me four hundred.  Plus, you have to understand, since he and Malick broke up, he's been... a bit promiscuous. Running around with a lot of Alphas. On the rebound, you might say."
Tony ducked his head a little, uncharacteristically bashful at the people around them applauding when he put the ring on Steve's finger.
, and good riddance!  The guy is a psychopath!" said Tony.  They were zipping north at over ninety miles an hour, which is the fastest Tony could go while weaving in and out of traffic.  "We should get Pepper to get a restraining order for Steve again Malick, too, that guy is completely fucking-- stop apologizing!"
"Steve," said Tony loudly, striding over.  "For the last time, it's a valet, not a car jacking!"  There were a few nervous giggles in the room; Tony was already embracing Steve.
"Jeff just had twins," said Phil.  “I’m sure once things have settled down a little for him, he’ll be more active in the movement.”
"Having a justification or a reasonable motive doesn't stop a crime being a crime," Steve said, turning back to Louis. "It's still goddamn assault. I don't care what they say. They don't have to live with being a rape victim their whole lives. The omegas they jump
"Come on.  Grab your helmet, Stark.  Toss me the shield. We've got to go.  Right now." Her voice was low and gentle and calm and measured.
"Eight-four.  There were eight-six last at the beginning of last year," said Tiberius, smoothing down his tie.  "There's estimated to be about two thousands kids still getting shipped off each year. Sounds bad, but it peaked back in the eighties and nineties.  Since they banned arranged bonding, a lot of Alpha and beta parents were left with an omega they didn't know what to do with. So they tried to...
.. Natasha, and Phil, and Clint... and I couldn't.  But I wanna stay friends.  I like how..."  Tony cracked a smile suddenly.  "I
Suspicious... ha. Steve's rationality was trying to fight it but deep down he was convinced that Bucky had spoken to him through Tony's subconscious.
need you to speak for me," he told him simply and then plucked the phone out of his hand. Bucky was growling.
"...Lila's two, she's going through sort of a weird phase.  Not sure what her status is yet, either. Anyway... I know you have this thing about trios... so I wanted to show you.  That they don't have to be bad. That omegas don't have to end up at the bottom of the totem pole."
Pietro wasn't familiar with the term "carpool."  He looked over at Wanda for support. This man didn't seem like an enemy but they couldn't take any chances.  Not when they were this close. He nodded to her; her gaze fixed on the other omega and her hands tensed, beginning to draw patterns in the air.
The performance was quite something, and Steve was impressed even though he had admittedly witnessed similar calls before. George was terribly good at conducting his voice to just the right pitch. Angela, a small blonde beta, had tried a few phone calls herself, but usually just ended up swearing at them.
Steve wondered how Natasha, Clint and Laura... his brain mercifully didn't conjure up the mental image. Steve wasn't sure he could have coped with that.
He walked back over to the model and put it back where it had come from, closed one eye, then opened it.  Then closed it.  He brought up his hand, made a circle, and looked through it.
and being projected into millions of televisions across the countries. And his personal monologues were getting him into all sorts of messes. So they went back to the speeches eventually; that was what Steve was good at.
"I think it was me that found you," Steve pointed out softly, a dopey kind of smile on his features that came from a combination of both love and sleepiness. When Steve wasn't in his heat it was easy to pretend everything was perfect. Aside from Tony's drinking, there was nothing else that really bothered him. Life was good, better than he ever thought it could be.  The world wasn't perfect, yet, and he couldn't yet say he'd won the war.  But he was still on his feet and fighting... and that counted for something.
Tony turned.  Vanko was lying, unmoving, on the ground.  The drones were standing there, silent, their arc reactors still shining, and Tony realized something suddenly.  Vanko had gone down too easily.  And the words he'd mouthed:
"Yeah.  Yeah, he is.  And Boswell's a great Alpha.  You can meet him, too," said Rhodey enticingly.  "And if you want to you can call Steve or Tony and ask any questions--"
"I've never heard anything like it.  The way that bonding ties together consciousness is not well understood," said the doctor reasonably.
"Hey!" Hal appeared with Lola at her side and patted Steve on the arm. "What the hell are you doing with those two?" she asked, tilting her head towards Joan who was following Maria up to the bar.
"You?" Clint raised an eyebrow. "I know you're all buddy-buddy with the tin man, but maybe it's better to send his boyfriend. Especially if he's in a mood."
"Why are you acting like such a child today?" Steve put his hands on his hips, frowning down at the bot, who was still kneeling on the floor.
"Oh, you will be..." Tony couldn't stop the rage boiling up in his stomach, making him see red. "You little shit. Nothing but trouble..." He flung Peter to the floor and stomped on his windpipe. Peter gasped for air, hands flying to his throat. An awful wheezing noise escaped his lips along with a bit of spit. Tony watched as he son twitched on the floor for several minutes. Peter weakly clutched onto Tony's pant leg. Tony stared him dead in the eye as Peter lay dying at his feet. The teen's own eyes clouded over with grief. And then it was over. The choked noises stopped and Peter stilled.
"Water will help your neck," Bucky unwound the bandages from his throat. He gently turned Tony's head in his hands, inspecting the burns. Not much had changed in twenty-four hours. Tony swatted his hands away, not liking being poked at. "Go," Bucky shoved him towards the bathroom. Tony gave him puppy dog eyes. "Fine," Bucky groaned. "You can sleep. But shower first."
"Steve! You're alive!" Clint threw himself into Steve's arms, only for the soldier to sidestep at the last second. Clint ended up falling face first onto the floor. "Meanie." He glanced up when he heard a familiar soft whirring noise approach him. Iron Man didn't say anything as he stepped over Clint.
"Shit!" Tony had the suit release him. It was too damaged to be of any use. "Did you see what direction they went?"
"Somebody want to tell me what the hell's going on?!" Director Fury shouted from the doorway, making everyone jump. He scanned the workshop, glaring at the mess of mechanical parts.
"No. Cap, Widow, Scarlet and I will also be on the mission. You'll just be the one leading us." Tony clarified.
Time froze. Spider-man could do nothing but stare at the body in horror. The web had caught Osborn to high up on his chest, the whiplash breaking his neck. "Oh...oh no..." Someone was speaking to him, but he couldn't comprehend what they were saying. Osborn's body swayed in the wind.
"Where am I? Why have you brought me here?" Peter screwed his eyes shut. There was too much light in the room. Way too much.
"Hang on, buddy, almost there..." Tony muttered under his breath. He had been riding for a solid hour. The land had steadily become rockier, the hills steeper. Tony came to a halt next to a small stream, allowing his horse to take a break before continuing on up the mountain. Tony knelt down by the water and splashed his face with the clear liquid. The sun was beating down on the land, threatening to burn his skin. He wiped his forehead with the back of his hand and looked up at the castle. It couldn't be more than a few miles away at this point.
This story takes place right before Age of Ultron, but I figured with Tony's life situation, he would advance through the various iterations of his armor at a much faster rate.
"That's messed up, Wanda," Steve was still trying to reason with her. "I get that you're upset, but this is not the way-OOF!" Wanda had launched him back. She waved her hands and disappeared in a flash of red.
"We're away from the Avengers, as requested," his attacker said. "I can save you a lot of pain if you surrender now and come with me," he offered one last time.
"Not right now. I'm sure he'll still be there at the Avengers meeting this weekend." Peter turned around in her arms and kissed her cheek, "I just want to be with you right now."
"In the flesh. Well, titanium. You get it." Tony set Clint down on the neighboring building. "Stop falling from high places."
Sunlight forced Steve to open his eyes. The soldier must have fallen asleep at some point because when he opened his eyes he found himself lying on the porch, his head on Tony's stomach. The engineer was breathing deeply, signaling he was asleep. Steve brushed a finger over the arc reactor. Even with a layer of cloth over it, Steve could feel the jagged lines running across it. The lines didn't match up with the perfect triangle and circles that he knew where on the reactor. Steve sat up, trying to get a better look at it. The light was too dim, and Tony's black shirt wasn't helping. Steve backed off when Tony started to stir.
"DON'T TOUCH THEM!" Iron Man put everything he had into his unibeam. White light shot from his chest, engulfing the street, and temporarily blinding the Avengers. When the light died away, the enemy robot was lying in pieces around Iron Man, who lay unmoving on the ground. "Don't...touch...them..." Iron Man's voice was only audible through the comms.
"I am more than capable of taking care of myself. I really need my bag. Just give me five minutes." Tony started digging more frantically.
"C'mon man, listen to Cap. Power down," Clint pleaded. "Iron Man. You have to power down. That's the only way to make the pain stop."
"Goodnight, kiddo." Tony chuckled softly. Peter's breathing evened out soon after, his body relaxing against Tony's. "He called me 'dad'," Tony said to Steve, a big smile spreading across his face.
"I don't believe you," Thor barked. Bruce was holding a can of beans out to him, he had a few more cans tucked under his arm. "That is a can-
"Yes, Steve." Their leader had gone to meet with Fury early in the morning, wanting to sort out this mess as soon as possible. "You want to see your boyfriend, don't you? And I'm sure he's gonna want to see you too."
