"You can blame that on the concussion and, the fact that you were out for a week," he stated. "Anyhow, Dr. Erskine and Mr. Stark stated that the piece is keeping you alive." He leaned back in his chair. "So why do you have it in your chest?"
She stared off, not wanting to look at him, but he had a point. She needed to take care of herself, but she couldn't take the nightmares. It would be one thing if they were scary or bloody, but she couldn't take the guilt ridden ones. "I get it, but I still don't understand why you care."
Phillips cut back to the table in a sharp turn. "My name in Colonel Phillips. Please refrain from calling me Salty." He took a deep breath to calm himself. "I trust Stark for the most part. I do not trust someone with no record. I cannot locate any record of you existing."
Steve smiled. "Then trust me when I say you have nothing to worry about. Trust me when I say we can trust them. And even if he did something, I can handle it."
"No, you don't." He was kicking himself. He should've listened to Toni more, considering Rumlow had just attacked him. That put a whole new spin on things. Was there a real reason why Rumlow had followed Toni around that night? Did whoever they were take her for a reason? The idea made his stomach flip as that meant that Toni was defenseless with these people. He paused for the second, forcing himself to take a deep breath. "And now, Toni could be in danger. Rollins has her, and I have no doubt that whoever it is, they have a plan. They killed Fury for a reason."
And he was willing to do whatever it took, even being out in the open unlike his prior kills. With the sun beating down, the Winter Soldier, still dressed in all black, was standing out from his surroundings, granted anyone would stand out in what appeared to be an abandoned home. What was supposed to be a foreclosed house, this place was filled with activity, and the heat signatures were running all throughout the compound, confirming that someone was using this place for a base. However, there was something odd about the signatures as some were reading extremely high—too high for a normal human, though the Soldier wasn't concerned about the readings. Nothing would stop him, even if they outnumbered him, as he was on a mission to locate a certain Brunette, who had been dragged into the abandoned mansion a few hours ago. For that, everyone would die.
Toni breathed through her nose, as she tried to control her heart. God, she just realized she loved him, and now, Sharon was asking if she wanted to marry him? She shouldn't be asking these questions. She wasn't sure if she was.
As Toni walked up the stairs behind him, she realized she had never asked him for his name. Yes, she already knew his name, but he didn't know she knew it. Wait….she thought as she remembered something. She had called him Rogers before and she was sure he had heard it. "I think I remember you now. Rogers was it?" she asked.
"Just hear me out." Killian didn't take no for an answer as he sets the three metal balls on the glass table and let them roll. "Regard the human brain," he said with a smile, as a hologram of the human brain appeared. He didn't give Toni a chance to respond as he continued on a second later. "Strangely mimetic though, wouldn't you say?"
"My name is Toni Stark." She didn't give her full first name as she hated her full name, and Salty really didn't need to know what Toni was short for. And if he wasn't stupid, he should have an idea of what it was.
kind of rest," she replied, coldly, as she glared at him. She also didn't like him touching her device, but she didn't make any move to stop him. It was useless without the core anyhow.
Barton stepped away from the armor and crossed to the counter near Rhodes, who had gotten to his feet. "Now," he stated, picking up his bow. "Ready, Rhodes?"
Also, side note: this is not and will not be a crossover with SUITS in any form. I just uses those names as they were the only names that I could think of for Lawyers.
"Enough," Toni snarled, glaring at Jim. She knew she needed to calm down and Jim had a point, but she wasn't a child. She could handle this…even if she was seeing things-though it was really one thing. One person. Even if she hadn't always been able to make out the man's face, she knew who was torturing her mind. No matter how much time had passed, Bucky would always haunt her, always be on her mind. "You either back me or you don't. It's that simple."
Bruce, who looked like he had slept in days, was in Toni's lab, trying to figure out what the hell had happened. With the help of JARVIS, he was able to tell that the device worked in an outward wave, affecting anything within its ten foot range. This had included Toni, and that made his heart stutter. JARVIS had informed him of what could happen to electronics and how they were unsure if the Arc Reactor would withstand the Device. Why couldn't Toni wait for him? The answer was simple: she had a hard head. He admired her for that, but at the same time, it annoyed the hell out of him.
Because of that, the genius doesn't know what to call this feeling that he has for his super soldiers. He knows it's more than just liking them-Definitely more. His mood always brightens up when they're in the room, and his heart skips a beat whenever they smile at him. His chest tightens with every smile aimed at him. Sure, Tony has a sexy smile, which he has been told over a hundred times, but those people haven't seen Bucky and Steve smile. If they did, they wouldn't be saying that. They would be drooling over the Brooklyn Boys' smiles, forgetting everything else around them. Forgetting their name. Forgetting to eat, to sleep.
Steve slammed the glass down, breaking it. "I'm not sorry that I want to mourn a friend. I have every right to do so, but I am sorry that I'd upset her. I thought she would want to talk about it." He looked for a trashcan so he could clean up his mess.
Tony isn't sure if his face is red, but his cheeks sure as hell feel warm. What's going on with him? "Taste like food. For a while, I thought he was trying to poison me, but I'm not dead," he says with a shrug. "Though you never know."
Her eye twitched. He of all people was not allowed to call her Sark. "I ready when you are, Barnes." She stated, stressing his last name. He had been like this since she admitted that she wasn't innocent. Sure in this time, women wouldn't admit that, but she thought he would get over it. Maybe, that was why he was chasing her. He wanted to steal her innocence. Figures, she thought, annoyed. Was all men like that? Granted, she was sex craze at times, so maybe, she couldn't talk.
"I know." She stated. "But it doesn't change the fact that he wanted to use me. He thought he could convince me to join him." She tried to force out those memories out of her mind as she could feel still the cold water hitting her face.
When Steve first met Rhodes, he had wondered if there was something between Rhodes and Toni for the longest time. He realized after a few conversions that they were just very closer and Rhodes was like a brother to her.
At least, she had the Hulk and Thor to save her, but the others weren't so lucky, which was what her nightmare reminded her. Halfway through her falling to her death, Bucky entered, replacing her, and she could do nothing but watch while he fell to his death, and that feeling was the worst. It was like someone had stabbed her in the heart repeatedly, and nothing she did could rid herself of that horrible feeling. She hated it.
Right now, she was stuck listening to the sounds or rather the screams of the city. Though she was high up in the sky, she could still hear the city below. She could hear the taxi cabs sing to each other, as crowd was chirping away at their phones. Together, they formed a loud roaring echo that reached every part of the city—including the sky, and it was a roar that never ended. It was no lie that 'New York was a city that never slept,' and the scene before her was proof to that. It was 3 o'clock in the morning, and Toni could corroborate that. Even from her spot high, she could hear the city sing. She could see the cars as they drove past, blending together into light. For someone who wanted the beach, the city was overwhelming.
Rumlow glanced back, sharing a long look with his buddy next to him. It was unnerving to say the least. "Well, you're probably the prettiest guard I have ever seen, but I'm here on business." His smile grew once more, almost painful.
With the knife still in her hand, she stepped back to the Colonel. "And you want me to confirm it, Salty?" Toni asked as the blade danced in her hand.
He kissed the bone for a few second, making her skin red, before he broke away and glanced up at her face. "Sure, Doll Face," he said, his voice heavy and thin. There was a look in his eyes that went straight through her, and it took every she had not break down right there and beg for him to fuck her—not that she would have to wait long.
Toni cursed as it wasn't Peggy who had spoken. Turning around, Toni swore loudly. "Colonel Salty! How are you?" she asked with a fake smile.
Toni paused as she thought about her situation, which had never happened to her before. Toni Stark was never without means or opportunities, and now, she had nothing. She was stuck with no money, and it pissed her off. How did anyone get along in life with no money? She couldn't even afford to buy something to eat and food was so much cheaper in the 1940's. "Stupid Stomach," she muttered to herself as it was growling. "Come to think about it, I don't remember the last time I ate." Sure, she had gone days without eating, but she always had the ability to get food. Now, she couldn't. She didn't like that feeling, and she didn't know how anyone could deal with that feeling.
Ignoring her gut, she took a step toward the man as she tried to get a better look at his face. She just needed to as there was no possible way that this was James Barnes, but they had the same stance, the same poise, and she had to see his face for herself. To make matters worse, it was difficult to see his face as his long hair covered his face. "Barnes?" she uttered, stepping forward again. She blamed her nightmares, making her see the Sergeant everywhere.
Toni wasn't always the best judge of character to which Steve could agree. Sometimes she trusted too easily. Other times, she was too rigid, refusing to let you in. Right now, she was finding it very difficult to trust this man, who she should be able to trust.
She took a painful breath as she continued to crawl. Originally, she never thought she would be able to get away from Schmidt, but she supposed it was Rogers, who made it possible. He had distracted Skully long enough for her to get away, but she wasn't safe yet. She either had to get out of this roasting building or she needed to find Rogers or Barnes, who made her heart skip at the sight of. Though she knew he going to die, she didn't know when he going to die; this could've been the day that he did, and that hit her hard. Man, since when did she become such a girl?
Taking a few more deep breaths, Toni attempted again it clear her mind, but all she saw was a nightmare. Because of this, it took her few
Still toning them out, Toni glanced at Salty and Sassy from the corner of her eyes. What they said didn't matter, because the only thing that did matter was her damn device that her father had. The longer he had it the more chances he had to ruin it, but it didn't matter when she got the device back as she would have to work with her father.
"So that's it," she says as she reaches for him and pulls him into his arms. "How are Barnes and Steve so stupid?" she asks as her hands travel up and down his back.
"I got everything that I needed done today," he answered as he pushed his plate away. "But I think Toni's day was better."
Tony knows when he had made his mistake with Barnes. It was when he told Barnes the truth… Well, the half-truth. He didn't and will not tell him the whole truth as that will get his ass kicked, and he would rather not get his prefect ass kicked, especially from a Super Soldier. His ass is one of the few things he loves.
"Yea, I don't know how I feel about that," she admitted, eyeing him. Her hand played with the handle to her gun, which was still holstered. She hadn't disarmed, which was rare if she did, because she was hardly without a weapon.
It felt like he could breathe again, though he didn't know when he stopped. However, that feeling didn't last long as he thought about the Beefy Blond with his Brunette. The idea that the Blond was trying so hard to find the Brunette, when all hope seemed lost didn't sit well with him. Sure, the Asset would search and hunt for the Brunette—as she was his-, but why did the Blond feel the need to risk his own life for her? Did he feel the same strange feeling in his chest as the Asset did? If so, did he not see that it was hopeless since she wasn't even down there—not that the Blond knew that?
Toni grimaced, forcing her broken arm to move. She wiggled her figures, making sure her hand was still working. Since they were, she knew she could still use them, even if she couldn't extend her arm. However, this bed was made better than she thought, and there was no way she could detached it without tools.
"Sure, they're lot of pretty dames," he stated. "But none are as special as you." He took another step toward her. "A bet just for you." His smile turned creepy if it wasn't already, and it sent chills down her back. "You know you want it."
"No, but I know that look," he said, knowingly. "And I feel the same." Toni didn't have a chance to respond as Steve captured her lips again with a deep kiss. Dropping to her waist, his hands settle just above her hips, disappearing under her sweater. He had a tight hold on her as he sucked on her bottom lip.
Bruce gave him a calculated look. Steve, who was still wearing his Captain America uniform, looked like he had been through hell both mentally and physically. "How are you, Steve?" he asked as he stepped toward him.
Rogers didn't respond, but Pepper did, and Toni wished she would've just let it go. "I understand why she didn't want to go. Today is a hard day for her."
he thought, which took his breath away. He couldn't imagine himself not loving her, and it could change the past completely and they could end up losing the war. They had to have won the war before she interfered, right?
When Pepper located Steve and Bruce, they were in the lounge, sitting in a dead silence. Sitting on the couch with his back toward her, Steve was staring down, picking at something, and from the view from the doorway, Pepper couldn't see what he was picking at. However, she could tell from his tense shoulders that he was anything but happy. He was clearly upset about something, and Pepper could only guess that it was about Toni.
"You could always do things that we could not," he cheered, eyeing a female nurse. "Oh, look its Nancy. I like Nancy."
Toni wasn't sure of that. "I'm fine. You can leave." She rested her broken arm on her lap while her right arm rested uncomfortably on the table as she was unable to move it.
For the last three hours, Toni had been pulling at the handcuffs to the point that her wrist was bleeding, but she didn't stop. She kept pulling, knowing this was her chance to escape. If they had been watching her, they would've come running. You know you're being stupid, right? She told herself. Even if she was able to escape the room, there was no way she could make it out without anyone noticing. She was being held by the military not by some Joe. Sure they weren't as advanced as they were in her time, but they still weren't a force to be messed with. However, Toni loved to take stupid risks, and she didn't care if it got her in trouble. She didn't care if it put her in hot water with her team or not. She didn't care if she got yelled at by Rogers. It just meant she did her job.
There was something in Toni's eyes that annoyed Steve. Even now, she wasn't serious. It was all a joke to her. "I'm sure if she still made weapons, Stark would be neck deep..." He had no idea of where this was coming from but it all flooding out. There was some part of him that wanted to annoy her for once.
Steve's heart was racing, as worry and guilt rushed through him, and he had to do something. Screw everything, Screw Fury. Toni needed him and he was going to go to her no matter what, though it seemed like that was already happening thanks to the AI. There was no doubt that was JAVIS' plan when he hijack the jet. But, Steve couldn't help but wonder why Toni hadn't called him herself?
The contact made her want more. "I dislike people." It was the truth. She had never gotten along with other people, and it always got her in trouble. She had learned that it was best if she was alone, and that was why it was hard for her to be on this team. She wasn't use to the backup.
"Well, I do like your accent better," Toni teased. "So much better than theirs." She leaned toward him with another glass of whiskey in her hand. "I'm a sucker for accents."
Spector put his suit case down as he wiggled off his suit jacket off. "This…was on your father's body the day that he died," he replied.
Toni's worry turned into annoyance as the urge to punch this man grew. Sure, any fan could be dangerous, but there was something different about this man. He seemed more like an adult child, who didn't know when to stop talking, then a danger. "No, she's not," she hissed, eyeing the open door and the people walking. Sure, the world was going to find out that she was alive—she was Toni Stark, and she could only remain quiet for some long, but right now, the world needed to think she was dead. She needed to be under the radar for her plan to work.
The Asset did not speak. He was not allowed to speak unless he was spoke to directly, but he wanted to, which was odd. He was taught never to speak, and from his lack of use, he wasn't sure he even had a voice. A voice wasn't needed to kill, so he was never worried about it.
Frustration growing, Barton, a master spy, didn't know where exactly Rollins was, but he knew in which direction the man was heading before his signal went offline. He knew Rollins was heading out of town and on which road the traitor was taken, but if the man had taken any side roads on that road, that could put some real distance between the two. However, it shouldn't take long for Clint to pick up the trail, but no one was perfect. No matter what you did, you left tracks. Plus, Rollins was a meat head working with limited smarts, while Clint eat this shit for breakfast, lunch and dinner. He hunted for fun and this was a hunt with no escape. By the end of this, Rollins was going to be dead and his head was going to be Clint's prize.
With rapid fire balls coming at her head, Toni didn't think there was anything that could stop these men, as you couldn't exactly destroy fire; however, blowing the Mark 42 did seem to work on Kilian, as the flames were still reaching high into the sky. In his place was a ball of dancing fire, and even if the intense flames melted everything it touched, Toni could feel the breath she was holding released—something that she didn't even know she was doing, and the pressure was gone. It was almost freeing. Almost.
"Can I use it? I don't need it for long. Just need long enough to tap into its energy," she said, silently thanking her father for the theory. However, she doubted that she would ever tell her father that.
Natasha turned to her fellow SHIELD agent and met his glaze. "I'm not saying she isn't worth it," she explained. "I'm just saying this isn't something you hug out, Rogers. This is going to take work.
You like that, West World?" Toni mocked as Harley ran off to hide. She watched the boy disappear in the night as Savin slowly got to his feet, his eyes glued on her. She could feel herself twitch under his stare, as this man didn't want to go down, refused to go down. Sure, he was glowing somehow for some reason, which made him impossibly strong, but man, she expected him to be stung for a bit or a minute. How unfair was that? However, she wasn't going to let his man get to her, especially after he mocked Steve. No one mocked Steve in front of her.
Steve was now located with Bruce down in the lab, where he was pretty much useless, but he had to do something as he would go crazy if he didn't. He was Captain America and he refused to stand on the sideline and do nothing. However, at this moment in time, he was pacing…which was doing nothing besides burning a hole in the floor.
Steve chuckled again as he placed a kiss to her forehead. "Oh, that letter is going to be a death of me."
Out of the shadows came Loki, who looked like crap. His hair was a mess and his holey clothes weren't fancy as she remembered. She was having a hard time believing that he would wear rags. "Long time no see, Stark?" he teased.
Ignoring everything around her, something roared inside of her. It was a lion, fighting to escape. Like she never doubted it in the first place, she knew the answer. She wanted to wake up every day to that man, but how could she? She was broken. She was seeing thing. Barnes was everywhere. "I don't want to be a burden," she said, sounding completely heartbroken.
Phillips' eye twitched. She leaned back in her chair and gazed out of the tent. "I swear you revert me back fourthly years when I speak to you."
Barnes took a seat at the table and picked up the newspapers. "Nope, but what she doesn't know can't hurt her." Even though her back was to him, she knew he was smiling.
Bruce's grip loosened and he took a step back to get a good look at her. For a second, he studied her, taking her in. He eyed the dirty 1940's military uniform she was wearing for a second before eyeing her messy hair that stuck out in every direction. He could see the dark shadows under her eyes. He could see her exhaustion. "Toni, how did you get back!? How are you here? Are you okay?" he asked, quietly, not giving her any time to respond. "No offense but you look like shit."
Steve's hold tightened as he tried to control his anger. He knew that there were few different factors, a few different reasons, why the woman he loved was breaking in his arms; however, that didn't help his anger. He needed someone or thing to focus on, because he wanted- needed to punch someone in the face. He needed to take his anger out on someone. Seeing Toni like this was the last thing that he ever wanted to see. "You're not broken, Toni. You're perfect."
"There you two are," Phillips stated as he stepped toward them. He was eyeing Toni as if she was in trouble.
If that smile was anything to judge, maybe he was happy? She hoped so. Toni gave him a look before leaning against the left side of the elevator. "Oh, you don't know what you have gotten yourself into, Rogers."
Forcing her eyes open, Toni was met with a surprise, not that she should have been. She knew she shouldn't have any doubt in Steve, even if there were parts of her who only saw doubts, as nothing could keep that man away, well if she didn't count herself. She was an ass. However, Steve would always be there for her, no matter what, and she needed to get used to it and stop testing him. "Cap," she uttered as Steve stood between, acting like a shield. He was being the person he was always meant to be. He was being a hero, a Savior.
"Are you calling yourself fat?" he asked with a smirk. This time, his smile reached his eyes. "If so, I need to find this boyfriend of yours and have a talk with him. He isn't doing his job and worshiping you like the queen that you are."
Just before sleep over came her, she watched Rogers glare at Phillips, which was so unlike him. There was something in his look, but Toni was too tired to ponder it, and she fell asleep watching Rogers talk to Phillips. What she did know was that she wanted to go home and beat the crap out of a certain god.
After she got him, she crunched down and rested her hands on her knees as she took a few deep breaths. "You walk away too fast," she stated after a minute.
Toni narrowed her eyes, because one, he didn't know everything. He just thought he did, and two, he did not know her, even if there was some truth to his words. He had no idea of what she was going through. "You're right," she started, staring at his face. "We don't have time for this. Go get them, Cowboy."
"My father did what?" she asked, as she took a step forward to grab the package. Her mind was having a difficult time wrapping itself around what was happening. How could he do this? How did her father know what would happen? That she would be here? Did he know her that well? How was that possible?
She clicked through her scanner/hack, while trying to figure out a way to distract the man in front of her; however, while doing that, she did found the exact location of her unnamed device.
That was why there were a limited number of people who had the key to her heart, and if she lost one of those people, it was a shot to her heart, which she didn't know to handle. No, she
- looked up, and their eyes met. He could see the color drain from his face as fear took over. He faltered a bit as Toni stepped away. The Asset was met with conflict as he wanted to go after her, but at the same time, he wanted to show this individual that touching what was his was unacceptable. This was the only thing he wanted, and he wanted to protect her. And like Hydra had done to him, he had to teach his man a lesson. He had to teach him what happened to those, who disobeyed.
With a sigh, Peggy stepped toward. "Let's me get you back to bed," she said, reaching toward Toni. "You shouldn't be out of bed."
Steve smiled into her hair. "Oh, really? You don't drool?" he teased. "But a little drool hadn't hurt anyone."
He eyed the armor before he glanced down at Toni, who looked tiny in that oversize coat. There was a part of him that wondered where she had gotten the coat, but he was grateful she had something to wrap herself in. It was cold, and it provided some kind of protection for her. In her hands, she held a journal and an old letter, and he could see the death grip she had on them. He didn't know what was written on them, but he knew it had to mean something for her hold on them so tightly.
Toni couldn't move and she wanted to scream, not that she would give Savin that. She would never give in to this man, but she was pinned, unable to move. Somehow someway she was still alive, considering she should've been smashed to death. Granted, it felt like it. Sure, there wasn't a car on her legs, but it felt like it. To make matters worse, there was countless metal pieces digging into her, cutting her, and each were different sizes and lengths.
Tony winks in pain as the pain meds have completely worn off, which is the last thing that he wants. He doesn't want to be around them when he's like this. He doesn't want to be a mess in front of them. "Don't worry. You two don't need to be concerned about me anymore," he says softly, as he reaches for the door.
inch. The hands start at the top of the genius and slowly work their down, touching as much skin as possible. Tony's face heats and brightens up to unnatural colors, and he doesn't have it in him to smash those
Clint pushed those thoughts aside, noticing blood in several places. Judging from the crash and the distance from Toni's prints, the blood was from one source, and considering how graceful the pursuer was, the blood was Toni's, which boiled Barton's insides. He had lived a long life, seen things that would make people shudder. He had done things to bloody his hands, things that he could never wash away. Did things that he was ashamed off, and because of that, he put up shields like most people do. Stark was known for that; Rogers was too, but he denied it more than anyone. That aside, he was fucken pissed. His shields be damned. There were only a small number of people that Barton would burn the world down for. He could count them on one hand: Nat, the first person he truly cared for; Laura, his
Toni laughed, because this kid had some spunk, which she liked. However, she was the queen of spunk, and that wasn't going to work on. "What I need is for you to go home, be with your mom, keep your trap shut, and guard the suit." She didn't want to threaten the kid, but the suit was her baby, and she was a protective momma. "And stay connected to the telephone, because if I call, you better pick up. Okay? I love my baby" She smiled her famous Stark grin. "Can you feel that? We're done here. Move out of the way or I'm gonna run you over. Bye, kid."
"Destroy that thing," the Female Hydra Commander ordered, pointing to the device behind Toni. One of the nameless soldiers moved toward the fake hacking device.
Though the device even with increased power could not bypass the 10 foot range, she couldn't know predict what would happen to the electronics within the range. Toni looked down at her chest piece and wondered if it would withstand the device. She had taken steps to make sure her Arc Rector would withstand the wave, but there was always a change that it wouldn't. There was a part of her that didn't care about the risk to the Arc Rector, and that scared her. Why didn't she care for her own life? "It'll be fine."
With Barnes' expression softening, Toni ignored the warning signs going off in her heads. The idea that she could save Barnes was everything to her, and she would do anything to make it up to him.
She knew he had a point, but she didn't care. She couldn't make herself care—not that she tried hard. She was too tired and grump to try, and to make matter worse, she was still feeling pukey—if that was a word. Her stomach was half way out her mouth currently. Sure, she kicked ass and jumped suit to suit like a bad ass, but she wanted nothing more than to lay down and sleep. She felt like crap. Like death, really. Maybe, the flu? But damn, Toni Stark didn't get sick. She couldn't afford to be sick. "What?" she asked, putting on an innocent smile.
Though she knew how sexy they made her legs look, Toni hated heels and never understand why anyone would want to wear them. They were the most uncomfortable things on the planet to walk in and it didn't matter what kind of heels Peppers brought her. However, there were two reasons why she wore them: Pepper made her or to get laid as men loved a woman in heels. She groaned, because Pepper wasn't here and she definitely wasn't getting laid. What was the point of heels if she wasn't trying to flirt the pants off someone? Exhaling slowly, she pulled on the itchy military jacket, which felt like it weighed 50 pounds. How could anyone wear this shit? She couldn't wait until she could take this off.
"Your throat hurts because they just took a feeding tube out. You have been out for a few days," Loki explained.
"It's Hydra. They want to turn her," Natasha interrupted, looking over Steve, who looked like he was going to be ill. She briefly explained what they learned from Zola. They were using ghost of a dead man to do it. A ghost of James Barnes.
"Not let," Schmidt said. Steve let out a smile, which the mad man didn't like, and it only served to anger the man more. "Erskine resented my genius and tried to deny me what was rightfully mine. But he gave you everything. So, what made you so special?" Skully snapped.
Toni didn't know how Steve thought this would work. Glasses and hats weren't a good disguise at any place, but she didn't dare tell that to Steve, who was beaming ear to ear as he looked at her. If she thought about it, the glasses worked for Superman and Supergirl, so hey, it could work for them- though those were fictional characters. SSSSHH! It could still work. Besides, who would think that Toni Stark was at the Smithsonian Museum; plus, no one would expect Steve to visit an exhibit dedicated to Captain America. People think she's an ass, not him.
Steve watched as Tom was wheeled away by some male orderly, telling him that he needed to take some pills. It wasn't until the elderly man was gone that he spoke up. He didn't want to talk in front of him. "Toni Sark."
"Well two times too many!" Wilson snaps back. "I hate that movie. It's shit, and you would think you people would get sick of watching Superhero movies, since you know we're superheroes."
Toni snorted. "And the U.S. is too cheap for that." Both Howard and Rogers both turned and glared. "What?" She stated, trying to play innocent. She put on a big smile.
Sitting Toni down gently, Steve set her down across from Bruce and took a step down next to her. He glanced up at the television as well, reading the words at the bottom of the screen. Toni stared at him, studying his every move, as she still couldn't understand why he wanted to be with her.
With a deep sigh, she forced herself to the present as the Iron Man touched down on roof of Steve's apartment building. Roof squeaked under the heavy the suit, signaling the age of the building, but this was barely a bump on Toni's mind. With JARVIS in the pilot seat, her mind was everywhere but this old roof in D.C. that the genius had found herself on. The building itself could've been fire and she would not have noticed.
Toni wasn't as horrible as everyone thought she was, though at times she was. She could remember the countless jokes (well half of them) that had run off her tongue. She just didn't and couldn't deal with emotions well, which was why she made jokes out of everything. You couldn't get hurt if you didn't take things seriously or let anyone in, and for the longest time, jokes were her shield. Her safety net. However, she understood these jokes got in the way, and set everything ablaze. Though, she knew when to control herself when she needed to. She may not like Fury, but Hill and Romanoff did. For them, she could keep her mouth shut, even if she had a few insults on her tongue ready to come out. They needed this moment.
He shook his head. "I thought I saw something." Toni laughed as his face was red. "So will you stay? You don't have to stay if you don't want to, but accepting help isn't a bad thing."
"Why do you care if she does?" the Captain asked. "What does it matter what I feel? Maybe, that's why Erskine thought I was special."
Toni stared for a few seconds, trying to read her face. "Besides the fact that we're so playing into the woman stereotype, I don't need a cupid. Why would I need a cupid?" In reality, her playing cupid may not be the best idea when they were in a war time; however, there wasn't anything else she could do besides fixing her device. She couldn't offer help without altering the future.
With a deep breath, Toni leaned her head back and closed her eyes as everything came rushing back to her and it was all too much. She listened to the sound of the aircraft as it flew through the sky to calm her.
Barton chuckled. "Yea. I so don't want to be here when she finds that out. I foresee explosions," he said. "Lots of explosion and her chasing you down."
The man wasn't staring at her, just looking off in the distance at one of the monuments. "I know that look. I've seen that look. Experienced it myself." He paused, letting out sigh. "Saw my best friend for months after his death."
Letting his eyes wander up her body, Steve studied her as he tried to get a reading. His eyes stopped on the cold metal hanging around her neck, and though he couldn't read them from this distance, he knew what was on the dog tags. As he stared, he wondered if she ever took them off. From what he could see, it didn't look like she did, and Steve wasn't sure of the emotion that bubbled up inside of him, but it didn't stop him from changing out of his uniform and crawling into bed with her. He felt her tremor slightly as he wrapped his arms around her and held her tight. She felt warm—hot really to the touch as he placed a kiss to her forehead. "I got you, Toni. I got you," he said softly into her hairlines. "Never letting you go."
. However, she knew, even if she didn't have that connection, that she would take his death hard. She was human after all. Knowing that someone was going to die and that there was no way to stop it would weigh heavy on anyone.
Lastly was Steve, who was a curve ball in her wide life. He broke everything that she ever thought as reality and threw her life into a spin. A good spin, but a spin, nevertheless. He had given her a different outlook, which she needed, but that scared her. What would she be like after this ended? She had no idea how long he was going to stick around for, as he would get sick of being stagnant. He was a soldier through and through, always looking for the next mission. He was put on this earth to saves lives, and he would save lives. He was destined to for it, and Toni refused to stand in his way. The Captain was a role model, and he was-
"I want to show you something, Okay?" He paused for a second, thinking. "Then we're going back home."
The Colonel crossed to the files on the table and pretended, which Toni could tell even from a few feet away, to look through them. "I see you and Sergeant Barnes are getting along."
Each time Steve even thought about asking, Fury sent him on a mission, barely telling him anything. He kept insisting that it wasn't important for him to know and that infuriated Steve to no end. Not only didn't that not settle his mind, it made him push harder. It made him lean harder on Fury, though he knew that man would never spill anything. That man was good at keeping secrets.
Shaking himself back to the present, Steve took a seat on a couch and stared at a magazine sitting on the table. On the cover was a picture of Toni in one of her many iron suits; her face was visible as she held the helmet in one arm, while the other was firmly at her side. She had a smug look on her face. Steve wasn't surprise with the cocky look as that was the standard Stark look, even her father, Howard, had that look, and though it annoyed the hell out of him, it looked right on Toni's face, a face that he desperately wanted to see.
? "No, I don't, but thank you." She put on a smile, trying to not snap. Someone had been watching her and she had a chance to get him.
"Why don't we open these things before Clint goes crazy," Natasha said before anyone could say anything. There was a judging look in her eyes, but she didn't say anything else.
"Why didn't you tell him?" she asked, knowing this would upset the Shrimp. Rogers and Barnes were close, and it would hurt him to know that his friend was going to war and could possibly lose his life, while he couldn't do anything. There was also the fact that Barnes was keeping it from him.
Steve folded down the blankets so Barnes could set her down on the twin size bed gently. Before stepping away, Bucky slid her boots off gently so Steve could pull the old blankets over her. They both turned away and started to step out of the bedroom.
"Hey, Tony," Barnes utters into his hair, holding him close. His fingers dances up his arms, caressing him softly.
"I got it," Toni replied as he watched the Doctor leave. Taking a deep breath, she held her arm against her chest and closed her eyes. Howard must've waved his techs away as she heard two additional people leave the room.
Again, there's a snarky comment on the lips, but he doesn't say it. Pepper will be proud, but in reality, he isn't in the mood for the fight. He isn't in the mood for the truth either, even if there's a part of him that wants this to be over with. "Still isn't wearing the uniform," he replies with a forced, sassy smile on his face. "Still not getting paid." It isn't lost on him that Bucky isn't the one to deliver the food like he has done in the past.
Steve laughs, truly laughs. "Not that we don't deserve it," he adds, placing a kiss to Tony's forehead. "So no more cold beds, and besides, I want morning sex."
It was the same voice that had called her name, but he wasn't talking to her. He was ordering someone to do something, though Toni wasn't sure what. All she knew was that the man was picking and pulling her into his warm chest.
However, Toni could tell it was more than just playing hurt, which struck her, and for a few minutes, Toni's nerves left as she took in her father's guilt. She wasn't sure what he was feeling, but she had no doubt he was thinking of his short coming. It was no secret that they had a bad relationship, which she had made clear with her actions. She even admitted to him that she had lost her father to his company. Now, he knew that she lost him to the company.
He wasn't an idiot. He noticed that she hadn't told him she loved him. At first, he didn't notice. He didn't think any of it; he could see how she felt. However, he couldn't help but notice now, especially after the proposal. He didn't want to, but he couldn't help it. "Stop it," he yelled himself as he pushed the door open…
With a deep breath, she turned back to her father, who was smiling at her with that cheesy smile of his, and as he smiled, she was cursing herself. Unable to stop herself, her hand went to her neck, to the tags around her neck, and she felt herself hate growing again. Here she was going to let another person die without saying a word. She was really a heartless bitch, wasn't she? She was really going to allow him to die, just like Barnes? Why couldn't he leave her be? Why couldn't he let her hate him? Why did she have to care for her father?
Steve looked between them with scared look him his eyes. "Are you two serious? I'm not going to fight teammates over something stupid."
There was no answer, and it pissed her off even more. She hated sitting in dead silence not doing anything, because there was so much she could be doing. She had to work on her device or she would never get home, though there was no real chance she could get home. She had no idea of how she got to the past, but she needed to figure it out so she could get home before anyone realized who she was. It would be bad if they did. She would hate to see what her father would do if he learned the truth.
Peggy came back with a glass in her hand. "You look like you need something to drink," she said, holding the glass out to Toni. "And some sleep."
Both Howard and Phillips' eyes widened at the words sex and kinky as if a woman did not say those things. Peggy let out a sigh. "Okay," she said slowly. "She's definitely your child."
With a deep sigh, Bruce closed his eyes and rubbed his forehead. "That doesn't make sense," he replied.
He let out a chuckle. "You didn't have to. With Howard being Howard, it would make sense that you had a lot of nannies, and that you two weren't close." He let out a sigh. "However, I can't have you throwing things at him, even if he deserves it."
Tony knows those tones well as he had gotten this tone from his father a few times. Like with his dear old dad, he isn't wanted here, and he can deal with that. He knows how it feels like to not be wanted, and they don't need to spell it out for him. "Good, I'm glad. You're the only two Super Soldiers we have, and I don't know what we would do without you." He can feel the tension in the room, and he can't stand to be in here for one more second. He knows the answer to his question, now. This is a clear rejection. "Come see me later, Barnes. I can repair that arm for you."
"Because you're an idiot," Romanoff muttered. "Today is March 15: The anniversary of Howard Stark's death."
Spector smiled weakly. "Need? For some reason, I don't think a Stark ever had a need for anything, so no, I don't think you
Forcing herself to take a deep breath, she quieted the insult in her throat. Jim hadn't been quiet about his feelings for Steve during the last few weeks, which annoyed the genius to no end. Steve wasn't like the other people she had been with. He was kinder for one. He wasn't using for another. "We don't have time for this. We have to save the President."
"Wouldn't you like to know," she responded, sitting up. She lean forward as if to grab to the case, but her hands stopped short. It was dead bolted and there was no way she could open it.
There was a twitch in Jim's right eye as he watched Toni head toward the boat's cabin. "Fine, but I'm only dropping this for now because the Vice President is sending back up and we don't have time for a fight. But we
Steve's look turned cold as he glared at Rumlow, which the man noticed. With a calm smile, he put his arms up as if to surrender. "Relax, Big Guy," he said. "Not moving on your turf."
Her mind drifted to the conversion she had with the colonel and it had her worried. What would he really do to her? Would he really torture her? There weren't a lot of things that scared her, but the idea of being tortured scared her. She had suffered from water boarding and other torture techniques before, and she didn't want to go back there, because she wasn't sure she could come back from that again. Just thinking about it got her heart racing. "Calm down," she whispered to herself. If she let him get to her, it wouldn't help and they would win, which she couldn't allow. She couldn't let them get to her, because if they got power over her, it wouldn't be good. The more power they got over her the more they could break her. She needed to put distance between them so she could protect her secrets.
Toni jumped at the sound. "I'm fine," she said, trying to hide her fear. She hadn't been able to sleep lately and it had put her on edge. She knew she couldn't be able to keep this up.
Howard gave her look but before he could respond, Peggy came back and said, "We're good. All of the guards are at the posts and there's no one in the camp besides us."
"You say that, but I don't think I do," he said, as he crossed to a chair and set her down. He kneeled in front of her as his hand traveled down her leg to her ankle, carefully pulling back her pants. "With you, I always have to be concerned. Never know when you're going to blow yourself up."
Oh, she knew. She didn't need them to tell her that. She didn't need for them to tell her anything else. She just needed them to get her back to the tower. "How did he know what time I would sure up in?" She ask, thinking about which time she had selected. Today was not the time she was hoping for. She was shooting for March 18.
Toni took a deep breath to calm herself, because Peggy's statement just infuriated her. "Play?" She tried to hold back her anger but it was seeping through. "I do not play and I'm
Shaking her head, she forced her glance forward. "Not now, Barnes." She had too many things on her mind to think about Rogers. Right now, she was about to be captured, because if she remembered correctly, that would be the outcome of this mission. Most of the 107 would be killed or taken hostage, and Toni wasn't going to do anything but let it happen. She just didn't have an idea of what she was going to do. Would she allowed herself to be captured? Would she allow the others to be captured while she escaped? She didn't think that she could allow that, even if Rogers would save them. She was heartless and cruel, but she couldn't be that heartless and cruel. She felt sick thinking about it.
"Just check the reactor, Banner. It appears that the core is intact, so you just need to change the wiring," Toni replied, trying to change the subject.
I hope you enjoy this. I again was struggling with making her feel guilty and but keeping her witty. Tell me what you think.
Natasha took a glance at Clint, knowing he was insulted by that, but she understood where Fury was coming from. If anyone one of them decided to turn, there would be no one to stop them.
"Five years ago, I was escorting a nuclear engineer out of Iran and somebody shot at my tires near Odessa." With a pain look, she replayed the memory in her head. "We lost control, went straight over a cliff. I pulled us out, but the Winter Soldier was there, just out of sight. Even though I was covering him, he shot him- straight through me." With a bit of hesitation, Natasha pulled up her shirt to show the bullet wound on her stomach. She held it up just long enough for Steve to see. "A Soviet slag, no rifling." She paused for a second. Her eyes grossed over in thought. "Bye-bye bikinis."
Laying back, she stared at the ceiling and tried to think about her situation, but her stupid hair was irritating her. She had wanted to chop it off, but Pepper wouldn't let her. That woman wouldn't let her do anything and it was exasperating. Toni was a grown ass woman… Urgh! She thought. Since one of her arm was broken, the other was handcuffed and her body was stiff, she was forced to blow her medium black hair out of her face; however, it really wasn't working. Giving up on blowing her hair out of the way, she forced her mind back to work.
Using the cars and trucks as covered, the assassin ducked and crossed the street, following the brunette into the darken park. Following his programing, he stayed in the shadows not wanting to be seen. He could
After laying herself on the ground, she had been able to work her pants up as she used her legs to push herself off the ground. "Now, here comes the hard part," she told herself. After a few attempts of trying to button them, she decided it would be useless if she couldn't hold one side still. She would need both hands. After freeing her broken arm from the sling, she tried to reach it down to hold her pants still, but she couldn't hold it for long. It was painful to work her arm like that but she needed to button her pants. "Got it," she whispered after a few moments of pain.
On one of the monitors, Toni noticed the Female Commander, or rather 'Madame Hydra,' which Toni still though was a lame nickname, trying to sneak out unnoticed. She watched the Commander for a second, wondering briefly what this woman was up to. Did she realize that the battle was lost and she wanted to escape before they lost? Was she not loyal to Hydra? Toni wouldn't blame her for that one, since Toni wouldn't want to be loyal to that group either, as they would probably shot you when you weren't looking.
Standing up, Toni unplugged her device and headed to the door. Just as she was to about to open the door, she heard someone typing in the code. Doing the only thing she could, she ran to the towers and tried to hide behind them. She didn't quite fit but it hid enough of her that no one would notice her in the shadows.
"Anyhow," he said, redirecting the conversion back to the hologram. He pinched his arm, and not even a second later, a part of the hologram lit up. "It's the primary somatosensory cortex. It's the brain's pain center. But this is what I wanted to show you," he said, trying to wave the stilled Toni over. He stared at her for a few seconds as if to control her movements with his mind. However, she didn't move, and with a sigh, he pressed the projector control and started to change and move the image with his hand.
"I'm aware," she replied, thinking back to her childhood. Whenever her father spoke to Peggy, it was always Peg with the rare Peggy. Her mother wasn't a fan and always making a face whenever he called Peggy that. Toni was aware why her mother made that face, not trusting her husband with Peggy. However, even as a child, Toni knew there was nothing to worry about.
She had one plan and that was getting home to her time. "Don't you think I'll kill you or something?" she asked, opening the folder he gave her. From the corner of her eye, she eyed Phillips, who had finally put the report away and she lost the will to read the file Howard gave her.
Tony shoots up, giving her a wild look. "What the hell are you talking about? I didn't break up with them."
His heart skip a beat as he heard that. "No, Toni. It's what I did to deserve you," he replied back. He didn't know what he would've done without this dame—no, woman. In the past, she was always there for him when he needed it, and he would never be able to thank her for that. Never. "Thank you." He said, softly kissed her on the top of her head.
Salty stepped to the door to check on Peggy, who was now crying into the microphone as she was calling out Steve's name repeatedly. Phillips took a deep breath as he turned back to Toni and let out a slowly sigh. He stood there in silence, thinking, and it wasn't until a few seconds later that he spoke. "I never realize how much I liked Rogers until right now. He was a fine man."
Toni held back her groan, which was a harder than it should have. "Can we please not talk about this?" she asked, as she tried to hide her face in Steve's smooth chest. There were a hundred things that she would rather talk about instead. She would rather talk about Clint's dirty underwear. She would rather talk about how Natasha could kick her ass with both hands behind her back. She would rather talk about her childhood and her father's parenting. She would rather talk about her mother's death. She would rather do anything besides talking about
Steve narrowed his eyes at Pepper before he turned to Rhodes, eyeing him. Those two were hovering close to the engineer, cutting her off from the rest of the room. "Miss Potts."
"Okay, Cowboy, lets head in before they're anymore antsy," she said, laughing at him. She pulled out of his arms completely as she turned to the door.
Steve glanced at him for a second before turning to Toni. His eyes focused on her bruise, an unforgivable bruise.
And now? He was on the run from SHIELD. He was a criminal and Toni was missing. If they were declaring Rogers a criminal, what did that mean for the famous Iron Man? Was she dead? Was she being tortured? Where the hell was she? Sharon didn't like this feeling bubbling in her stomach. Was she working for the bad guy? She had to be, because Captain America was not the bad guy.
The Doctor looked up at her face and he could see the pain written on it. "Corporal, the shock has numbed your arm. You should gain the feeling back in your arm in a few hours. Do you want a sling?"
"Not the best pillow though." He could feel her shiver as she spoke. "You need some fat on your bones."
However, she had to give it to Rogers: he knew how to make a room comfortable. His room had a homely feeling that her tower so dearly missed. He had more pictures in this one room than she did in her whole tower and that was saying something. "He looks happy," she said, picking up a photo of him and, who she assumed to be, his parents. They looked like one big happy family, and that annoyed Toni, who slammed the photo down a little too hard. The glass shattered. "Shit," she muttered, feeling like an idiot.
Toni didn't say those words back, only burying herself deeper into his chest. She closed out the world, focusing only on the Super Soldier, who was whispering nothing but sweet words into her ear. She listened to his steady heartbeat, which she patterned her own heartbeat after. She listened to the calmed tones in his voice, as she allowed him to rock her back into sleep. After a few minutes, she allowed him to lay her back into bed as he laid down next to her. She allowed him to basically wrap his own naked body around her, creating a barrier to world around. She allowed him to do all of this, as she felt completely safe in his arms.
"Did you finally give up?" Barnes' voice was ice cold as he crossed to the fallen genius. Stopping a few feet from her, Barnes lowed himself down to her eye level. His stare was as cold as the arctic, and there was no ounce of kindness in those eyes. The Bucky that she knew was gone.
"Don't go alone!" She heard Peggy yelled, knowing why. Team Skully wanted her for something, but she couldn't bring herself to care.
Toni didn't waste any time and buried her face in his neck. "S-Steve," she cried, wrapping her arms around his chest. God, she didn't know what she would do without this man, because she was half way to crazy town, and without him, she would be in mental hospital.
Toni didn't look out as she let out a deep sigh. "He asked. I didn't give him an answer." Why was she telling Sharon this? She hadn't really talked about this with anyone. She had mentioned it to Jim, telling him that she hadn't given Rogers an answer. She wasn't sure what Rhodey was thinking, but he told her to take her time. To think about it. And if Steve pushed or pressured her, he didn't deserve her. Pepper, on the other hand, didn't know anything at all. Toni didn't really want to talk about it with her—too worried what she might say.
"Don't worry. I can handle you," he smiled, leaning against the other side. His eyes were on her, never leaving her.
Steve smiles softly as he watches the two. Anyone with eyes can see how much Rhodes cares for Tony, and they would be a fool if they think they can hurt Tony in front of Rhodes. "Don't give him any idea, Jim," he says. "We don't need dinosaurs roaming New York."
Toni watched from the corner of her eyes and took a deep breath. Maybe, she could just leave now and they would never know…. Or okay, they would but that was beside the point. They wouldn't find out until she was gone and that would be too late for them to find her… Besides, she didn't need to be here and she didn't need their charity. I should just go, she thought, even if it was foolish.
He watched her body language as she moved. "Why don't you come back up to the apartment? It's chilly down here." Though the door was close, there was a cold draft.
Toni watched him leave, knowing this was for the best. She had other things to do, like see Salty, which she hadn't been able to do. She had something to talk to him about.
After a few seconds, she pulled off the wires and watched the door. As soon as it was clear that no one was coming, she kicked her legs over the bed and stood up. "Fuck," Toni muttered, as she fell straight to the cold hard ground. Her legs hadn't been able to support her weight. She closed her eyes as pain sailed through her body.
"But this feels wrong," Pepper replied. Her voice gave it all way. On top of being tired, she was worried. Deeply worried about something.
She glanced up at him as he finished his sentence. "So he told you," she said slowly. She wasn't surprised that Howard telling Phillips, but she was surprised at Phillips' calmness. She expected him to be mad that Howard knew but nothing.
"Since you don't work today, do you-" Rogers started but the door silenced him. In came Barnes with a smile on his face. Over his shoulder, he held a bag, which held some clothes. "Hey, Bucky."
Toni glanced down at her broken arm, as it was useless. Even if she was able to hack into that company, the cast would only slow her down and probably get her caught, which was something she couldn't afford. It would also be very stupid to rush in without a second thought, and Toni Stark was not stupid. There was no telling what kind of defenses her father had, but they had to be excellent for the time even if they couldn't compare to her time; however, she knew her father would probably fight her on that.
The ugly nurse from before came walking to the room with a food tray. When she noticed the empty bed, she dropped the tray and food went everywhere. "Doc-"
"Just don't touch me," she replied, looking over to her father, who placed down his wretch and took a step toward them. There was a look of protectiveness on his face as he stared at them. It was an odd expression to see on his face directed towards her.
Sorry it took a long to update. Here you go the next chapter. This will be the last chapter in Part one of The Change Tide of Time. Don't worry. I have the next Chapter written for Part two. It is just waiting to be beta-ed. And again, thanks to my beta who is awesome. :) So as soon as she gets that back to me, i will post it.
She wasn't a girly girl in any way, shape or form, though moments at times—didn't all girls?-, but Toni didn't do well in the outdoors… She was a deer trapped in a room, destroying everything in her path…unless, she had her Iron Man suit, which…wasn't functional at the moment. That still ate at her, rotting her core. Since she had created the Iron Man suit a few years ago, she hadn't been without it since. She felt weak without it. She felt powerless, and she hated that.
Dr. Erskine sat the clip board down on the table and shifted through the papers. "How are you feeling? Any pain?" he asked as he reached in his pocket. "Should be time for another dose."
Pepper didn't respond right away, taking a few long seconds to say anything. "…Please tell me your dress. Please tell me I didn't call you during sex! Not again. Who answers the phone during Sex?"
Eyeing her plate, he was amazed the food wasn't everywhere. "Did no one teach you manners?" Salty asked. His face changed suddenly as if he just remembered something from their earlier conversation. "I'm s-"
, and she needed more than his voice. His voice at times felt like a slap in the face when all she wanted was him. She needed him, goddamn it. She couldn't deal with reality without him. She couldn't deal with the ghosts without him. And again, goddamn, she
Turning away from the two love doves, she felt the wind get knocked out of her. She didn't know why she expected anything different, but heck, why did it even matter? It wasn't like there was a chance for the two of them. Did she forget about the future asshole Rogers, who wouldn't let her do anything? All she needed to do was to look the future and see it wouldn't work. Maybe, this was a good thing; she could spare herself the pain.
Aware that he couldn't do anything but pout, Steve wasn't laughing, just giving Natasha the puppy dog eyes until she got sick of it and moved. Ever since then, it has become a game before every movie night to see who can steal a seat next to Tony. It's a game that everyone enjoys besides James and Steve, who don't like it all, and they're willing to do anything to prevent someone from stealing their seat: coming early, refusing to let Tony sit before they're both ready, and/or taking as much room on the sofa as possible until all three of them are seated. Bucky may or may not bring knifes as well…
After a few minutes, Toni crossed to Rogers' door and peaked in. "Geez, asleep alright." She could only make out his form in the darkness, but she could tell by his stiffness that he was out. Shaking her head, she crossed back to the couch. She reached into her pocket for her broke phone and set it on the table before reaching for her tools that were still hidden under the coffee table.
Unable to pass up teasing the man—hey, she was Toni Stark after all-, the genius made her way over to the man. Besides, she wasn't going to catch up with Rogers anyhow, not with her out of shape body. Her boyfriend has long since vanished from sight, almost as if he wasn't there. Even though she could fly, she had to admit that she was in awe of him. Making her way to the man—his eyes closed-, Toni let out another chuckle, as she took him in. Stopping a few feet from him, she said, "Geez, someone's out of shape."
"He'll be back. Just taking Pepper to the airport," Toni replied, stepping to Clint. "I'm not looking forward to that lecture, but they can't be as bad as Rogers'." She said with a smile as she grabbed Barton by the shoulder.
"I do want to train," she added, out of breath. They had been running for miles, and she had sweat dripping down her face. "Let's go." She stepped back to him. "I'm rea-" Without watching where she stepped, she tripped over a tree root and before she could even think to put on her arms out, she found herself in Barnes' chest. His arms were wrapped around her, making her forget where she was.
Steve looked up and eyed the archer. "I do remember him stating before that we were a security risk," he stated. His arms were folded across his chest as he recalled that conversion.
Toni wasn't looking at Steve, though he made it difficult to look anywhere else. He was kneeing between her legs with one hand on her arm and the other on her cheek, rubbing his thumb in a circular movement. There was a sweetness to his voice that couldn't be matched. She felt like she could do anything with him looking at her like that, and that was probably how and why she told him everything. It was probably why nothing she said changed the expression on his face.
"You don't need to go," Steve countered. "Someone else can go. You don't need to go on the front line. Stay here."
Toni's head felt like it was on fire, while her lungs felt like there was a brick on her chest. "Urgh," she muttered painfully; her throat felt like sand. Every part of her hurt and she thought she was going to die from the pain. She was familiar with pain as she had experience it before, but this was something different. Something completely different.
Toni waved it off. "Don't worry about it. I'm not insulted this time and I was joking with you. Geez, you need to lighten up." He couldn't take a joke in her time as well, which was funny and interesting. "Anyways, the homeless shelter. Do you know anyone who would know of one?" she asked.
Toni winced in pain as she turned to him. "I don't need to rest." She was tired of everyone telling her that; she didn't need to rest. She didn't want to rest. She wanted to get going; she wanted to be on the move. "
Steve wrapped one towel around Toni's shoulders and put another on her lap, as he tried to keep her warm. He took a third, a wet, warm towel and started to clean her exposed skin. "We need to get these wet clothes off and get you to bed," he said, pulling her close.
After leaving the museum, she dragged Steve to the PTSD group Sam was holding. She didn't know why she had the urge to go there. Maybe, it was Steve bringing her to the Museum, and she wanted to take that step forward, but Sam Wilson's words appeared in her head. She didn't know why, but his words hit her hard. He had a point. Maybe, that was what she needed. Besides, it didn't take much to drag Steve here, as he was willing to go.
down. This is the first time that Barnes has touched him in over a week, and it feels amazing. He feels like he's loved, even if he knows Barnes and Rogers will never love him and that it's all fake pity. Using that, Tony snaps back and stays strong, as he refuses to fall apart now. He can't. Not Now.
"You're asking a lot of personal questions," she countered. Remind me later when I get to my time to beat Rogers. He's annoying, she told herself. Sure, he was annoying in her time, but he didn't ask so many questions in her time. He knew better.
Rhodes' surprise was still present on his face as he spoke, "Toni's here? Where is she? In the lab?"
With pain rocketing through her entire body, it was amazing that she could recall anything. Granted, her body felt weird to her and she had no idea of what was happening around her, but she could feel, and she counted that as a plus. However, that wasn't really a relief, as she only knew so much about her mystery surroundings. She was having a difficult time wrapping her mind around anything as she felt like she was in a cloudy haze. A haze that she couldn't figure out what was up or down, but she could make out a few things even with the poundings, and one of those things was the chafing zip ties securing her to an old metal bedframe, which squealed with her every movement.
Any way, it seems like Toni is finally seeing ghosts? Do you think she will tell Steve or lose herself down that rabbit hole? Or is Hydra going to get what they want?
Barnes was right to his word and didn't go to Tony to repair his arm, and though that's exactly what Tony wants, it doesn't feel right. It feels like he has been rejected on all levels, like someone has stabbed him in the heart. Sure, Tony isn't a nice or friendly person, but his work, his mind is the only thing that Tony can offer the world… though after the Ultron situation, no one wants his mind anymore. So what good is he? This is why he had sent all of the arm's specs to the tech Barnes went to fix his arm. It's why he answers every question, repeating himself a hundred of times to make sure the tech got it right. He has to be useful. Has to. He can't be burden. He just can't. He can't prove his father right.
"I. Never. Dated. The Captain. And. His Sidekick," he says slowly as if she's stupid. He knows she'll beat him, but he doesn't care. He isn't in the mood to play. He isn't in the mood for company. He isn't in the mood to keep up a happy face.
Her hands balled as she eyed the man who had grabbed her. She still did not know his name. "What do you want?" she asked, ready to slug him. She was not in the right mind set to deal with him.
Clint wasn't far behind. "I will personally put an arrow in everyone. And then you can make an honest woman out of her Stark and marry her. And Nat and I will watch any future kiddos."
Natasha sighed again. "Impossible," she repeated, stepping to the genius. She placed a hand on Toni's shoulder and squeezed. "But it's good to have you back. Don't do that to us again."
to settle her mind, or else she would torture herself. However, the second she looked back down was the second that Toni lost her footing on the muddy, uneven ground and tripped. Tumbling forward, Toni could feel her ankle twist as she plummeted, landing face first into the wet, muddy ground. She laid there covered in mud for a few second as pain shot up her leg.
"Well," she said, feeling her heart beating a million miles per second. "He was going on and on about how he was going recode Human DNA into something else. Talking about how he was going to create what it sounds like more Soldier Soldiers and stuff." Toni didn't even stop to look at the surprised look on Steve's face. "And all I wanted was for him to shut up, because we have enough Super Soldiers in this world, and we don't need any more, especially if he just saw them as weapons. Besides, the one we got is amazing enough, and if I really wanted more amazing Super Soldiers, I have you… And well, this," she said as she placed a hand to her stomach. "I said that aloud so he thought–"
"Why I what?" she interrupted. "Why don't you leave before I beat you again?" Her heart was still beating rapidly as the bully did not move. He just stood still.
Steve felt hollow when Stark left, and he couldn't help but feel like he had lost everything when she left. Why did everything turn out so violent between them? Why did they fight all of the time? Did she really hate him? Blame him? If not, then what else could it be? What happened to make her like this? She seemed so different than the woman he left in the past. Did something happened after he went down?
The Howling Commandos kept referring to her as a robot after seeing the Reactor, and they refused and couldn't think of anything else. They just couldn't wrap their minds around it. Toni, for her part, couldn't help but wish she were a robot so she wouldn't be feeling like this. "So what are you up to?" she asked.
she told herself. She couldn't help but feel something was wrong with her. Maybe, a few seconds of air could help, and it wasn't like she didn't have a few seconds. She still had to wait for her armor to return from wherever Rhodey was.
Not moving from Steve, Toni let out a sigh. "Just tell her I'm not here!" she said, wanting to get back to kissing
When Carter and Phillips arrived at the labs, they found Dr. Erskine speaking with Howard Stark. Toni's device laid on the table opened with wires attached to it, and each wire was burnt. Tools were spread around table as Howard couldn't locate the tool he wanted. Erskine was staring at blueprints that Howard had drawn up, trying to figure out what the device was supposed to.
Trip gave her a look before shaking his head. "I don't believe my mother would forgive me if I let my grandfather get into a fight with a fellow Commando," he said, exasperated.
