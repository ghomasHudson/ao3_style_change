"And I don't care about any of that stuff," Peter said. "All I care about is getting my papa back. My dad needs him, especially after—" He broke off, shaking his head. He'd already cried over himself enough, and more tears wouldn't help anyway. "Especially afterwards. And I know I can bring Papa home, so you just gotta leave me alone until I figure this out."
They had also talked a bit about what they might see in Peter's memory. While Steve knew that Peter didn't remember all that much from the Miami bunker battle—which was fine with him since he had enough horrible memories for all three of them—this experiment was most likely going to cause a big resurgence of traumatic images, and not only for Peter, since both he and Tony were almost certain that Obadiah was going to show up at some point.
Sam's eyebrows knitted together as he tore off another piece off his scone. "You feel like going into a bit more detail about that?"
"Master Peter is currently sleeping peacefully, Captain," said JARVIS. "His vital signs are within his normal parameters."
"Yeah, yeah, don't go crying too hard on me now, Falcon, I'll wait for ya," Tony said. "Geez, you'd think you'd be happy with your new pack upgrade, but no, you always gotta be giving me the grabby hands. There's only one of me, you know."
"It's not intruding if we invite you in," Tony stated. "And as far as I'm concerned, you're just as much of a father to that kid as I am. And being a father by choice instead of by chance makes it even more special."
Peter gripped his pen in his hands, trying to take deep breaths from his diaphragm like Uncle Sam had taught him to do when he was feeling especially stressed. "I've always been kinda weird, Ned," he said evenly. "Maybe it's just taken you till now to figure that out."
"Dad's right, little guy," Papa said in his Captain's voice. "The Avengers are a team, which means—"
"Don't think you're too far off there, Hawkeye," replied Sam. "I've sure never seen anything like it!"
"Pete!" he pleaded, his panic spiking when Peter's head suddenly lolled to the side, his chest heaving as he attempted to suck in air. "Oh gods, Pete, don't do this! You gotta wake up, buddy, okay? You just gotta wake up!"
To Steve’s surprise, despite his lack of meetings, the day passes quickly, and soon he finds himself pacing back and forth inside his cubicle at 4:45pm, trying to decide if it’s too early to head down to the pool area.  He’s gone over Peter’s workout for the day at least a dozen times, tweaking a few things here and there, but for the last hour or so has found himself too caught up in his nerves to concentrate on anything.
“Oh Jesus, Pete, let’s not get ahead of ourselves,” Tony rushed out.  “Let’s… get some dinner ordered, yeah?  I think your hunger is starting to affect your mind.”
"I agree, sir," said JARVIS. "There are some similarities to the encryption keys used for the Project Insight algorithm, but if I do say so, this is even more advanced. As such, I am unable to transfer any of it to the Tower's servers without a significant risk to the security systems."
If Steve had thought that by halting Stark Industries weapons’ construction that Tony’s workload might decrease a little, he had been sorely mistaken.  If anything, the complete changeover into developing products such as medical devices and other useful hardware seemed like it had caused Tony’s workload to increase by at least a factor of ten.  Already he’d had to hire a dozen new engineers to help design all of the products he had ideas for, all of which would be powered by his new clean-energy power source.
Tony stepped back, carefully placing the glasses in their case while the rest of the team filtered out towards the elevator, with Peter sandwiched between Bucky and Thor and laughing at something that Thor just said.
“Okay, this is not good,” he whispered as he took another careful step, his jaw tightly clenched to keep his teeth from chattering.  Just as he’d feared, the loss of daylight had caused the outside temperature to drop like a rock, which meant he needed to find the bunker quickly, before he became hypothermic.
"He's—he's in the truck, sweetheart," Steve murmured as he helped Tony to his feet, clutching his hand as he led him towards the Suburban. "And he's… stable, at least for now."
"It was dumb as hell of you to not tell me," Tony stated. "And especially after Pete specifically asked you to."
"Well, so what if I have?" she asked. "She's a lot more interesting than Kurt Vonnegut, if I do say so."
Peter breathed in, squaring his shoulders. "He ends up destroying his creator, and then he goes free."
Keeping his right hand flat against the bed, Steve released the headboard and began hopping towards the bathroom, stopping at the end of the bed to balance himself on the footboard. The bathroom was still about ten paces away with nothing more for him to grab onto, but once he was able to get to the doorway he would hopefully be okay.
"Shit, that was close!" Clint said as they reached the remains of the guard tower, ducking down behind it just in time to avoid another shot. "Where the hell are they firing from, there aren't any goddamn trees out here!"
"Oops," Tony said with a giggle, still high on his own post-coital bliss. "Guess we didn't miss the dinner after all."
"Okay there, buddy?" Tony asked as Peter attempted to swing his backpack over his shoulder, nearly knocking himself off-balance in the process.
“I do,” said Steve.  “And I’ve never seen a Road King up close, only in catalogues.  It’s even more gorgeous than I imagined.”
Something about the tone of his voice, the way it wobbles ever-so-slightly, and the way he’s now refusing to look Steve in the eyes causes a knot to rise in Steve’s throat, remembering something else that Peter’s told him.
Pain pierced Tony's chest with an intensity that he hadn't felt since his open-heart surgery in the freezing Afghanistan cave.
"We have exactly one," Tony said shortly. "Otherwise we'll be late getting back to the city to pick up Pete."
"I don't know, Tony," Howard said quietly, his shoulders sagging as he suddenly aged twenty years in less than three seconds. "I wasn't exactly keeping track."
"Yeah, Steve, that was… I shouldn't've said that, it was out of line," Bruce said sheepishly. "Sorry."
"Oh, like you never gloat?" said Bucky. "If that's the case, then who was it that was telling us the whole way over here about how he finally beat Петр at chess yesterday, hmm? Стиви, was that you?"
"Ahh, maybe tell us your last name, sir?" asked Peter. "Otherwise it's gonna get pretty confusing here with both of us having the same name."
First, it’s almost eerie how similar Tony is to Brock looks-wise.  Both men have wavy dark hair, brown eyes, and very muscular arms, features that Steve has always found attractive.  Both men also have strong jawlines and nicely-curved backs, although Tony’s ass is definitely rounder than Brock’s.
"Well, it wasn't a very pleasant conversation," Steve continued, shuddering slightly. "They were closed up in our spare room, but Ma was really letting him have it. And once they finally came out, Phillips told me to meet him at the base in two days."
"It should only be another day or two," Papa added. "We're all getting excited to come home, little guy. We miss you."
"Not at the moment, but new information is coming in every few minutes or so, so we're obviously still closely monitoring the situation," Fury answered. "What I can tell you people is that based on the currently available evidence, this does not appear to be the same type of attack that occurred over Wakanda earlier this week."
Steve bit his bottom lip, his worry wrinkle on full display. "How can I help, sweetheart? Do you want me to call the team? We can get started on the vetting process, and—"
And if by some godawful chance they actually were to succeed… especially if they were to use some of the stolen Chitauri tech that still had yet to be recovered, then…
"I believe that there is no 'rest of us'," he began. "Regardless of my enhancements, I'm just as human as anyone else, as are the other enhanced individuals on our team. I also believe that the track record of the Avengers is sufficient enough to stand on its own. I believe that our team has proven itself time and time again that we have nothing but the best interests of not only the United States, but of all humanity at heart, and I also believe that the vast majority of the general public would agree with me. We have fought battles against threats that without our involvement would have resulted in potentially catastrophic casualties, and we have done so without hesitation and without expectation of either reward or compensation. We are, sir, Earth's mightiest defence force, and if for some reason a threat were to emerge where I would feel it necessary to utilise the Iron Legion, then I would make that call, again without hesitation."
"What the—?" he muttered as he pushed himself up onto his elbow. On the opposite side of the bed Steve was still out, his strong arm sprawled across both Peter and Tony in that protective papa-bear hold that they both adored.
Tony nodded against Steve's chest. "It's basically like a big stun gun, designed to disable rather than destroy. There is a kill function available, but it requires voice authorisation from either you or me to activate it."
"At ease, Captain!" Colonel Phillips snapped. He huffed out a sharp breath, glaring in Howard's direction. "Now, you should know that there is no way I would've been on board with any of this if I didn't think that Howard could provide exactly what we needed, so if you can't seem to find it in yourselves to take his word that the serum will be fine, then take mine instead. Is that understood?"
"Gwen's fine, little guy. She's at home with her family," Steve said as he patted Peter's back. "She told us that you saved her."
Tony brought Steve's hand to his lips, kissing the back of it as he tried to figure out how to respond. Steve's fear was completely valid, and honestly something that Tony's exhausted mind hadn't even come up with. But it was also—or at least he hoped—very unlikely.
“Hey now,” Tony suddenly murmured, brushing away a tear that had somehow escaped from Steve’s eye.  “Honey?  You okay?”
"Sorry dude, but those don't work on me anymore!" Peter said, finally managing to work his fingers underneath the sandman's foot, grunting as he tried to lift it off of him. Another sentry would be coming any second now, and—
"No," Steve answered, probably a bit too defensively when Tony quirked a questioning eyebrow. "I just… I just… please, do we have to keep talking about it? Can't we just—"
The shield that had failed to win him the battle against Thanos. Failed to keep his son from dying in Tony's arms.
"Are you thinking that someone had it in for your papa?" asked Tony. "Some kind of sick revenge thing or something?"
"I don't know, honey," Tony murmured as he cupped Steve's cheek, kissing his forehead. "But we're gonna figure it out, I promise you."
"And none of that's my fault, Pete," Tony stated. "And it's not yours either, so don't you even let him tell you that—"
"Sounds good." Tony picked up his coffee cup, frowning when he saw that it was empty. "Any word back yet about getting in to see Toomes?"
“Don't hold back, honey,” Tony said as he tucked Steve’s legs up a bit more, hitting a spot inside him with his next thrust that Steve had had no idea even existed before now.  “I wanna hear everything.”
And the fact that Gwen had been boasting about the length of her essay the other day at practise had absolutely nothing to do with Peter's renewed motivation. Absolutely nothing at all.
"I'm gonna figure out where they took Papa," Peter said, grabbing his laptops. He quickly pulled up the HYDRA files, selecting the next in line. "And the sooner the better."
Tony thought, his heart lurching painfully as they entered the atmosphere, emerging a few seconds later over an Earth that was both the same, and yet very, very different.
The fact that he couldn't remember much of what had happened in the bunker didn't help at all, especially Papa. Papa absolutely
"All right, give me a sec," Tony said as he slid off of Peter's bed and over to the table in the corner by the windows. "Go ahead and put her through over here."
Peter thought as he headed down the centre aisle, which just happened to be the Sci-Fi and Fantasy aisle, two of his very favourite genres.  He grinned as he noticed a complete boxed set of the
Mr Stacy waved a dismissive hand. "I'm sure he has, and I'm sure to you it doesn't seem odd that the very people who caused the mess in the first place are now being paid to clean it up."
"Well, maybe you shouldn't've waited till the lights were off to finish getting ready!" Bucky retorted. "C'mon, Steve, I figured you'd have a better plan than that!"
And little did Steve know that Tony had also packed Steve's nanite suit, which was now tucked securely in his pants pocket.
"Ah, the kid worries too much about me," Tony said, rolling his eyes. "And that's your influence, by the way."
"I'll be right back, honey, yeah?" Tony said, softly kissing Steve's cheek. "Think you'll feel a lot better once we wash all this grime off of ya."
"Okay, so Morris Bench, um…" he squinted at the screen, shaking his head. "Ah, maybe it'd be easier if Nat just read 'em."
"I am afraid I am unaware of any problems with Master Peter, sir," JARVIS said, just as softly. "Is there a problem with him?"
“We’re gonna be okay, honey.  I can feel it,” he told Steve.  He brought Steve’s hand to his lips, kissing the back of it.  “And there’s even more stuff that we need to talk about.  Stuff that I think is gonna help you recover even faster, but we’re gonna wait on that until after Mr Wilson gets here, okay?”
Pepper leaned back in her chair, letting out a heavy sigh. "Remember that R&D supervisor who I thought was slacking on his performance reviews? Quentin Beck?"
"No, and I've given up on trying to explain them to him," Peter answered. "He mainly just likes watching all the fights."
"Okay, so that's probably good enough for the smaller airliner," Tony said as he carefully rolled up the completed set of blueprints. He was scheduled to go over them with Colonel Phillips in the morning after he dropped Peter off at school. "Now, for the bigger one, I was thinking that we could—"
but we've gotta—we should get going, away from here. It's not—this isn't the best place for us to be right now."
"Yeah," Steve said softly, smiling as Peter politely thanked the checkout lady, looking very proud of himself. "Now look at me."
And the first thing he had noticed—after the echoes of Hulk’s thundering roars had died down, at least—were the bright blue eyes of Steve Rogers staring down at him, glassy with tears as relief washed across his grime-covered, but still-gorgeous face.
The van rounded a corner, sending Peter flying into a couple of loaded trash bins and bouncing off of a huge brick mailbox as one of the doors opened to reveal Gauntlet Man, aiming one of the nearly metre-long rifles right at him. Fighting against his rising panic, Peter peeled his freezing right hand from his web rope and shot another, catching it onto the rifle and yanking it right out of Gauntlet Man's hands.
"Sir," Steve replied, sitting so perfectly straight in his chair that Tony was certain he could've balanced a level across his shoulders.
"No, no, we're not gonna have any kind of talk like that," Tony said firmly. "And especially not now, right after we've gotten you back. It is not your fault that you hit your head during that attack, bud, and there is no one who thinks any less of you for it. You cannot control how your body chooses to heal itself."
If the last year had proven anything, it was that no one, not a single person who was alive, dead, or yet to be born, was stronger than Steve Rogers.
Unfortunately, the more Steve had attempted to slot each of his unpleasant thoughts into their individually labelled compartments in his mind the more jumbled they seemed to become, and coming face-to-face with none other than Anthony Stark that morning hadn't helped in the slightest.
Tony circled around the hologram, dragging his palm down his face as he attempted to force his fried brain to figure out where in the hell the thing was going wrong.  He’d been at it for hours, ever since he’d tucked Peter into bed, and yet, three and a half pots of coffee later he was still stuck on the same goddamn problem.
"All right, all right," Steve cut in. Witnessing yet another lovers' spat at the breakfast table was not part of his plan for that morning, no matter how tongue-in-cheek it might be. "Why don't we just try and focus on what we'll be doing later, hmm?"
Hammer's head snapped back in surprise, his eyes going wide as he pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose.
"Copy, Mr Wilson," said Stacy. "There is a bit of a problem, though. I'm not sure how we're supposed to get inside Captain Rogers' cell."
“Eh, I'd call it more of a lull.  It happens from time to time,” says Dad.  He curses under his breath as he swerves to avoid a delivery bicyclist trying to make a left-hand turn from the right-hand sidewalk.  Then he tosses Peter a rather self-satisfied look, waggling his eyebrows.  “‘Specially when I got to spend most of last week playing with a ‘12 Aventador.”
"Peter, you gotta let go, okay?" he heard himself say. "It's all right, little guy, I'm gonna catch you!"
"And you could tell that from down there by the aircraft?" Tony asked. "I was over thirty metres away and half a story above you!"
Glancing up at the clock, Tony was shocked to see that it was almost 11pm, Peter’s bedtime on weekends.  He let out a groan as he hoisted himself off the couch, sniffing as he made his way back to the living room to find the television muted and Peter already half-asleep, with his head tipped back against the couch and pieces of popcorn scattered across the floor in front of him.
“Tony?” Obie said, jerking his head towards the monitor.  “I believe I asked you a very simple question.”
Steve breathed in, his belly dropping a bit as Natasha showed him a photograph of the pager, on which appeared a symbol composed of two zig-zagged stripes of blue and red and a gold star in the centre.
"Mmm, I think that's an excellent idea," Steve breathed, his heart already thudding against his ribcage. He tapped the star on his chest twice, watching in awe as the nanites began to flow back into the small device, leaving him standing in the undersuit that Tony had designed for him, one that closely resembled his cold-weather running clothes.
At the moment, though, Tony had absolutely no idea what to tell him. Peter's health was already so precarious that Tony was afraid that any bad news might be enough to tip him over the edge, and Tony couldn't risk him getting any worse before the surgeons could get a hold of him.
"All right, I think we've got everything where it needs to be," Steve said as he emerged from the training dome's breaker room. "The breakers are all set, and the emergency generators are on standby."
"What?" Steve said, whipping his head around just in time to see what appeared to be a black hole forming near the destroyed force shield. Instinctively, he raised his shield, his heart jumping into his throat as he waited to see what he hoped he was wrong about.
"Hold on," Tony said. He banked suddenly and swooped down, allowing the suit tailing him to fly overhead which he quickly took out with a well-aimed missile right below the neck, the only weak spot that he'd been able to asses on the suits so far.
“Sure looks like it,” says Steve.  “Which means Baron Von Strucker has just outed himself as one of the HYDRA moles inside SHIELD.”
And no matter how hard Steve tried to convince him otherwise, no matter how much he had begged and pleaded, Tony couldn't bring himself to hear him.
"Me too." Steve sighed as he glanced over at the clock, patting Tony's flank. "Don't get up, okay? Just let me take care of you."
Tony scoffed, shaking his head as he carefully took Peter's hand. "I don't—I don't know about that… You'd think a hero would be able to protect his own kid better than—better than this."
"Don't forget to get something for yourself too," Steve said tiredly. "I'm sure you haven't eaten anything since this morning."
"All right," Steve said after a heartbeat's pause. "Nat, you stay with her. Don't let her out of your sight, you got that? And I want Pietro standing by. At the first sign of trouble, he gets her right outta there, understood?"
“Either that, or it’s a pretty weird coincidence,” answers Natasha.  “But given what else I’ve read about Howard Stark, I wouldn't put it past him.  The guy seems real nice, if you know what I mean.”
"Under no circumstances can the Time Stone fall into Thanos' hands," said Dr Strange. "We must come up with a way to protect it."
“Jesus fucking Christ!” Tony muttered as soon as the door had closed.  He pinched the bridge of his nose, gulping down over half of his coffee before pressing the intercom button for Pepper’s office.
"Exactly!" said Steve. "And those materials were all about the Aminacin drug that HYDRA gave him, and—"
As soon as he did, though, well… Steve was positive that he had never blushed so hard in his entire life.  And since he was usually about as pale as the moon, that was saying something.
At the edge of the gym, Peter took advantage of the teacher chaperones' distraction with students making out behind the bleachers to slip into the hallway, heading for his locker. He quickly changed his clothes, cringing as he stuffed his nice suit into his locker and slammed the door, hurrying towards the nearby boys' room where he'd hidden his cloned phone. It was the same restroom with the busted window where he used to sneak out for his Spider-Man patrols all those months ago, behind the tall set of bushes and still out of the sightline of Happy's security guards.
Natasha said, low and tight. "I know, because we're all there. We're all feeling the exact same way. Stunned, horrified, shocked, whatever word you feel like using. But I just can't shake the feeling that this isn't it. That this isn't the whole story. And if whoever's on the other end of that pager can offer us some more information, then I think it's at least worth a try."
Shaking his head, Tony crept closer to the platform. He could see Strange suspended in mid-air about one story down, surrounded by long silvery spikes. The goofy Squidward alien was standing in front of him, his hands clasped as he droned on and on about pleasing his master, or some other such nonsense.
"Okay, but none of this explains why these people keep coming after Peter!" Steve said, his voice cracking on their son's name. "What do all these people want with him, he's just a boy!"
And less than a heartbeat later they were on their way, racing towards the past to try and repair their future.
Tony chuckled.  “Hey, you gotta give me one every now and then, right?” he said as he ruffled Peter’s freshly trimmed hair.  As he’d promised, he had taken Peter for a much-needed haircut on Saturday morning after they’d had a nice breakfast at one of Peter’s favourite cafes.  It had been so long since Peter had last had his hair cut that the barber had to take off almost two inches, and Tony had been utterly shocked by how much older he had suddenly looked afterwards.
But then the kid Peter had to come along and completely change things. The fact that an eleven-year-old kid could be so thoroughly unimpressed by Steve's piloting skills and yet so awed by the fact that he could draw, a hobby that he'd had since he was a small child, was something that Steve wouldn't've seen coming in a million years.
"We'll go home just as soon as we get you fixed up again, okay?" Tony said. "Helen and Bruce are already on their way, so it won't be too long."
"Carol, get on my wing," commanded Steve. If nothing else he could help shadow Carol since his reflexes were a bit faster. "Just follow me through, understood?"
"That's 'cause you're the big brave Captain," Tony had said, giving Steve one of those quirky smiles of his that he loved. Then he'd tilted his head, giving Steve such a perfect example of eager bedroom eyes that it had taken all of Steve's strength to kiss him one final time and say goodnight.
“Uh huh,” Peter said eagerly as he headed towards the back.  “I can’t wait to go ice skating tomorrow!”
"Not right now, Steve," Tony whispered. He grasped onto Steve's left hand, unlatching it from his belt and flexing his fingers. "Bruce just kicked me outta there and Clint, Sam, and that bird thingy of his are off exploring the lower levels, so… right now there's nothing much else that we can do."
"Peter, I really don't think that's—" Papa started, just as the alien's hammer closed around Peter's body. Grimacing, Peter wiggled his arms down to his sides and pushed outwards, breaking the hammer's hold just in time to web onto half of a taxicab and send it hurtling down on top of the alien.
"Say hi to your little bug. Got it," Tony said. "You know, for all of my qualms about the Russian language, I have to say, it is almost scary how accurate your diminutive nicknames can be."
“Aahh!” Steve yelps as nausea slams into him like a runaway freight train, the intense pain consuming almost his entire being.  He tries to gulp in air as he reaches his shaking hands towards his leg, his stomach twisting again as his palms come back wet with blood.
"Well, it's about time there, Casanova," Uncle James said as soon as Peter slid into the backseat. "Did you forget we were here or something?"
"Okay," Tony said slowly, thinking. If he were able to double the targeting range of the drones, it just might be enough to force HYDRA out of some of their foxholes and into the open, especially if they were forced to move Steve because of it.
Tony thought as he repulsed away yet another Gamorrean alien, smirking when Scott stomped him into the ground as he lumbered by.
"Oh no," Steve gasped as the massive alien drew back his arm and launched his huge metal hammer at Bruce, knocking him off-balance just as an entire herd of the war dogs attacked him. Bruce cried out as he was driven to the ground, the snarling animals unrelenting as they bit and clawed at the red and gold armour.
"Three thousand, eight hundred and three," Ned said proudly. "And my mom let me put in a preorder this morning, so as soon as it comes available they'll ship it right out." He paused, eyeing Peter pointedly. "You know, it would be tons of fun if we could build it over at your place. Maybe your Auntie Nat would even wanna help us?"
"Okay, but…" Peter couldn't help it; he just had to ask. "Um… do you know if Gwen's okay? She's not—she didn't get hurt, did she?"
Basically, what HYDRA and the Winter Soldiers had been trying to do to Peter down in the Miami bunker.
"Well, thank God we're not still back in your day, babe, 'cause Pete's not getting serious about a girl or boy or anyone else until he's at least twenty-five. I won't be ready for it before then."
"Well…" Steve trailed off as he stirred the cinnamon and honey into the hot tea. To say that he was appalled when he'd learned how much modern medicines tended to cost in the twenty-first century would be an understatement. His own ma had had enough trouble trying to afford the medicines he'd needed so often as a child, he couldn't imagine what they would've done if the prices had been anywhere close to as high as they were now.
At first Steve was too stunned to even respond. Surely the general wasn't trying to imply that Tony had anything to do with the Meridian beam that took out Bucky's aircraft, was he?
"Well, then Uncle Sam can come too," Peter muttered. "I don't really care as long as they don't tease me too much in front of Gwen."
"If that is in fact the definition of 'like-like', then I would absolutely agree that Mr Stark and Captain Rogers do indeed 'like-like' each other. However, I do believe that you and Miss Stacy are a bit young for… that type of relationship, and I also believe that Mr Stark and Captain Rogers would agree with my assessment."
"Okay, okay, but what the hell is this many-worlds thing?" Scott asked, looking almost frightened. "'Cause that sounds more like something out of
"No wonder Hammer's company never sold anything of actual importance!" Peter said, grunting as he wiggled his fingers into the juncture between the suit's neck and shoulder and proceeded to yank out the relay. The suit immediately let out a loud whine, sputtering as Peter pulled hard on his web rope, trying to steer it away from the oncoming wall of the bunker.
But, as Steve was discovering, things apparently weren't as black and white as he had always thought.
"Would you want to go with me?" Peter asked, almost without thinking, which was apparently the exact right thing to say when Gwen squeaked, bursting into an excited smile.
“Oh God!” he sobbed into the back cushion of the couch, dabbing at his leaking eyes with the hem of his t-shirt.  “Why?  Why’d it have to—?  Why did he have to—?”
"Yeah, Clint," added Natasha, a rather evil-looking gleam in her grey eyes. "I'm sure Tony wasn't limiting himself to just holding hands when he was fifteen."
"It's your eyes, mo grá," he finally said. "No matter what you say, your eyes can never lie. At least, not to me. And since Peter's eyes are the same as yours, his can't lie either."
"What? No!" Dad exclaimed. "I mean, just… hold on a second." He huffed out a sharp breath, frowning. "I'm not—"
"Love you too," Peter mumbled as he cuddled a bit closer, listening to the calming sound of Dad's heartbeat. He let out a semi-contented sigh when Dad's fingers wove into his hair, rubbing his scalp. Dad had told him too many times to count that the only way he'd been able to get him to sleep—or stop screaming, as was usually the case—when he was a baby was to tuck his head against Dad's chest over his heart, and rub his head.
"Oh for Christ's sake, I'm not telling you to ask Pete for help. All I'm saying is that it's okay for you to admit to him what he already knows. He already knows that you have nightmares. He already knows that you spend hours down in the gym punching the hell outta your punching bags until your knuckles bleed and the floor's covered in sand. He already knows that you run so much that you're blowing through three pairs of shoes in a month, and he already knows that absolutely none of this is helping you to get better!" He paused, weighing his next words very carefully. "And what you're showing him by doing those things, is that it's okay to try and sideswipe your problems instead of facing them head-on. And Pete already gets enough of that from me, Steve, he doesn't need it from you too."
"Hey Dad," Peter said softly as he set down the tray. "I, um… Uncle James and I made some food, and I thought you might want to eat something, so I brought…"
“Oh, you're welcome, Mr Rogers!  Or should I say, Captain Rogers?” the lady replied with a giggle.  “And I know you probably get this all the time, but I’ve just gotta say, you're even better looking in person than you are in the magazines!  Mr Stark sure is a lucky guy.”
“Yeah,” murmured Tony.  He cleared his throat, straightening his back.  “So, you’ll prepare the press release?  According to JARVIS, we’ve got about three weeks left in our current contracts, so—”
—years ago, Steve's ring was a duplicate, one that Tony made for him after HYDRA stole his original wedding ring when they took him prisoner. Steve had been so drugged and otherwise out of it at the time that he hadn't even realised it was gone until Tony and the rest of the team showed up to rescue him.
They set up their picnic blanket in their usual spot. Tony licked his lips as he watched Steve take out the platters of pasta and seasoned bread, nearly vibrating with anticipation. He had even brought a bottle of wine, which nearly brought Tony to tears once he opened it and handed Tony his glass.
, Stevie, you are really way out of practise! I mean, that was like a primary school-level attempt back there, and from a guy like you—"
"But those weren't timelines that had actually happened, Steve," Sam said evenly. "Yours and Bucky's did actually happen. Look, I know you don't like this, and frankly, neither do I. But I don't think it's just a coincidence that you're both having dreams like this, which leads me to believe it's gotta somehow be related to these gem things."
Steve shuddered as he recalled the searing heat of that fireball, and the shock that he'd felt at seeing someone he'd spent nearly every single day with for the last three years suddenly vanish while being completely and utterly helpless to stop it.
Tony drops his shoulders, letting out a fake chuckle.  “Yeah, except I’m pretty sure even at three you knew what was going on most of the time,” he says, earning a blatant side-eye from his son.
"He's unbeatable," Gamora said, so frankly that Tony flinched. "I have fought with him and for him for years. He was unbeatable before the stones, and now, with four of them, he'll be even more so."
Shooting Natasha a raised eyebrow, Steve hurried into the kitchen, grabbing the bread and the jar of peanut butter as he tried to will his thudding heart to calm down a bit. There were so many possible ramifications of Scott's sudden reappearance that his mind was racing, and he absolutely did
Depressing the trigger, Steve watched in awe as the satellite launched from his aircraft, abruptly stopping about five seconds later and turning so its pointed end faced the planet.
“Copy that,” Steve answers as he zooms on his bike towards one of the southern towers.  He launches his shield at a tree, where it ricochets, taking out two agents before it bounces to a second tree and then a third. He catches it with his arm just as one of Tony’s repulsor blasts fires off to his right, taking out the driver of another truck just as his HYDRA teammate is attempting to fire at Clint.
“Is it okay if I visit that bookstore again on Monday?” he asked.  “I didn't really get a chance to look around that much.”
Peter sniffed, pushing his glasses up his nose as he shoved his hands into his pockets. He wanted to tell Gwen what was wrong—well, actually, that wasn't quite the truth. What he
Tony begged. "Tell me what happened this morning! I've never seen you like this, what the hell'd the general say to you that's got you so worked up?"
Pride welled up in Peter's belly, and he smiled widely. "Well, Papa is pretty smart. And he's known you for pretty much your whole life, so I think you should listen to him."
He managed to swallow the rest of his sentence before it escaped from his mouth, not wanting to upset Dad more than he already was. He had already lost a bunch of weight since Papa had been gone, his eyes were red-rimmed and puffy, like he'd been crying, his face was scarily pale under his overgrown facial hair, and Peter knew that he hadn't slept more than a few minutes in the last several days. And he'd only gotten that because Uncle James had threatened to knock him over the head if he didn't sit down for awhile.
"Yeah, but I'm sure if I'd really wanted to, I could've figured something out. Some way to stop making weapons long before Pete and I nearly got blown to kingdom come," said Tony. "I just didn't try hard enough."
"Maybe," said Gwen. "Probably. I don't know, I guess I'll find that out at the interview. I'm trying to not get my hopes up though."
"Um… I'm sorry if this sounds kinda harsh, but… don't you think that should be Uncle Sam's choice?" Peter asked. "I mean, did you ask him how he feels?"
"You most certainly are not!" Steve retorted. "JARVIS, can you tell me Tony's body temperature, please? And his heart and respiratory rates?"
"At your service, sir," JARVIS answered, a bit confused but otherwise his usual perfunctory self. "Is there a reason why I would not be?"
They lost thirteen baseballs during one of those pickup games last summer, a fact that Tony had greatly enjoyed reminding Steve of all the way up until Thanos invaded.
Little Steve said again, barely managing to catch a drop of his ice cream before it hit the polished floor. "
“Not too many kids your age have a butterfly stroke that’s that smooth, Peter,” Mr Rogers says once Peter pops his head up.  “You seem to have a lot of natural talent.”
"No, no, Cap, we're all fine," Clint said as Steve reached for Tony's hand. "And yeah, under normal circumstances, it is supposed to be impossible to break in because JARVIS would've blasted the bastard right outta here with the drones the second he showed his face. Except—"
He also needed to make sure that if he did decide to stick with Steve, that both he and Peter understood all of the possible ramifications of that choice.  Ramifications that wouldn’t only affect Tony and Peter, but also every single employee at Stark Industries and everyone who purchased the company’s goods and services.
But he was cut off by Bucky who had Peter in his arms, still whispering into his ear, his words a mix of English and Russian.
“So, you tripped and fell?” Ned asked, his smirk evident on Peter’s computer screen.  “At the bookstore?”
Peter scrunched up his nose as he gave his reflection a final once-over, tugging on the tight collar of his dress shirt. He couldn't understand how Papa could tolerate wearing a suit and tie as often as he did. Peter had barely been wearing his for five minutes and he already felt like he was choking.
Besides, with Papa's foot still in a cast he was already cranky enough from his lack of mobility, and Peter didn't feel like adding even more ammunition to it.
His heart in his throat, Tony rushed into the living room, pacing back and forth and nearly jumping out of his skin as soon as the elevator doors opened. Stacy was wearing his cop uniform and Gwen was still in her dress from the dance, and looked as though she had been crying.
Steve rushed out.  Then he cupped Tony’s cheek and dipped his head, brushing his lips across Tony’s in a soft, tentative kiss.  The warmth that had been simmering under the surface of Steve’s skin for the entire evening quickly roared into a conflagration as he drew back to catch a glimpse of Tony’s eyes before diving right back in, capturing his luscious bottom lip between his own.  Steve let out a soft whimper as Tony’s hands slid up his arms and shoulders to his neck, his fingers trailing along the patch of skin just above Steve’s shirt collar.
try to imply that my mother was anything but a shining light for this company!” Tony yelled.  “I will tolerate a lot of things from you, Obadiah, but I will not tolerate that!”
"Control, this is Phoenix One," Steve said, exactly on the forty-five second mark. "On my way back to the barn."
"Argh," Tony groaned, thudding his forehead against Steve's shoulder. The last thing Steve needed was to be up at all hours of the night when he was still trying to recover from his Namibia skirmish, but Tony was not in the mood to argue with him.
"Thor?" he whispered as he tried to lift his head, dropping it back down when it immediately started to swim. He let out a pained groan as he slowly rolled onto his side, squeezing his eyes back closed as he tried to regain control of his senses.
"So did I," Steve said softly. He tugged on Tony's hand, turning him to face him and very grateful for the dim light to hide the blush creeping up his neck. "I'd—I'd like to… um… is it okay if—if I kiss you goodnight?"
But he still does.  Because pain or not, and no matter what Brock liked to snarl at him, Steve Rogers is not a quitter.
"The boy is correct," said the blue girl—Nebula, if Tony was remembering correctly. Which was in no way a given at this point. "We should get to Earth, join in the fight."
Clutching his side, Peter crawled up to the prison and dropped down to the ground next to it, tipping his head back as he sucked in air. It was highly likely that whoever was in charge of the place had already been alerted to his presence, so he knew that whatever he was going to do next had to be done quickly if he hoped to get Papa out of there before reinforcements arrived.
"Tony," Steve breathed against Tony's lips as he kicked off his shoes, guiding them towards the centre of the spacious room. Aside from the still-setting sun sending soft beams of warmth through the windows, the room was lit only by the pillar candles that Steve had strategically placed after Peter had taken his picture earlier that afternoon. Bucky had informed him right before he and Sam had left that he’d successfully lit all of the candles, warning Steve to make sure that he and Tony made it upstairs before they all burned down.
Steve laughed, the melodic sound sending another blast of warmth through Tony’s body.  “Well, based on what I’ve seen, I highly doubt that.  But if it’s any consolation, I still like hanging out with you.”
Tony watched as the three men exchanged loaded glances, his belly swooping in fear as he locked eyes with Rhodey, whose face was drawn and ashen.
Not to mention he needed to make sure that Tony actually ate something of substance once he woke up, instead of trying to subsist only on coffee for the next three days. Again.
"Steve," James insisted as he crouched down in front of him, his battle-worn face etched in the same anguish that Steve was drowning in. "Look, I know… I
And, even despite his protests, Tony was also feeling better. It had been so long since he had been able to sleep more than a couple of hours at a time, and Steve had already noticed a big difference in his demeanour thanks to the decent rest he'd been able to get.
"There's no grey area for me when it comes to you and Peter, Tony," Steve said firmly. "Absolutely none. And there never will be."
Tears stung Tony's eyes, and he tipped his forehead against Steve's collarbone. "You really do love him like a son, hmm?"
Steve's heart gave a lurch as the shiny blue light flickered across the lenses of the glasses, with Peter's eyes going wide a second later.
“I see,” says Mr Rogers, steepling his hands on the table.  “You do know that swimming isn't a completely individual sport, right?  There are relay teams.”
For the better, Tony believed, but even good change was still change.  And something he had been conditioned very hard over the years to avoid, as Rhodey had so bluntly stated the night before when Tony had called him with the news.
"Well, I think that went about as well as it could have," said Rhodey. "I swear that Davis is a special kind of asshole, though."
as he flew up right next to Steve, waving at him from the cockpit of an X-301. "Now, get the hell outta here and get this done!"
"Colonel, the aircraft's released what appears to be a bomb of some kind!" Joseph yelled just as the lock tone sounded in his cockpit. "I'm attempting to take it out!"
Gwen shot him a grin, reaching over to squeeze him on the knee. "Then I guess it's a good thing my dad's not here then, hmm?"
Reaching behind him, Steve tugged the t-shirt over his head and tossed it aside, his breath catching when Tony palmed his biceps, stroking up to his shoulders and down to his pecs, his thumbs brushing lightly across his nipples.
Steve smiled widely. This was by far his favourite part of the whole plan. "Once Carol and I have deployed and activated everything, Colonel Phillips is planning on holding a news conference after the normal curfew time," he said. "We figure when people realise their lights haven't gone off, they'll be curious as to why."
"Do me a favour and run the numbers again, and this time disregard that final unknown variable," Tony said.
"Except that it only triggered one of the drones," said Auntie Nat. "Which means that whatever it was—"
Because for how extensive HYDRA was, there was simply no way it could go on indefinitely, especially after the Avengers had managed to thwart Project Insight. And surely all of the political opposition would decide to back down once they were able to completely destroy the evil organisation.
"So good, baby, you're so good," Tony moaned, hoarse and raw as Steve's thrusts increased in speed, each word accented by a quick pant of breath. "'M getting close!"
—to some gigantic invading space army may have seemed a bit far fetched, but Steve had seen way too many far fetched things come to life since he'd crashed the
going to tell you that this is not the time to try anything that I might consider out of the ordinary for a normal patrol, because all of you should be damn well smart enough to already know that. In addition, I should
"What's going on in here?" Peter said as he suddenly appeared in the doorway, rubbing his eyes. Tony immediately launched himself at him, nearly knocking Steve over in his haste to reach the son that he loved beyond all logic or reason. Thankfully Steve recovered quickly, steadying Tony just enough to keep him from tripping as he stumbled over to Peter, pulling him into his arms.
"Yeah," Steve said softly, breathing out a short sigh of relief when Tony seemed to relax a bit, his fingers twitching in Steve's. "Yeah, I guess you could say that."
"Yeah." Peter was just leaning in for another kiss when Gwen's outside light suddenly turned on, nearly causing him to hit the ceiling of the car. "Uhh, I guess you've gotta go."

"Not yet," Steve murmured, even as his fists ached to punch the nose right from Thanos' face. The Power Stone power trip Thanos had gone on before acquiring the Soul Stone the first time around was still fresh in Steve's mind, and he absolutely did
"Well, thank goodness," Steve murmured. "For a second there I thought I was gonna have to change my plans."
"Mr Harrington," Peter said before Papa could open his mouth. "Um, Captain Rogers didn't actually live through the post-WWII time. I mean, not really. He was frozen, remember?"
In fact, Steve had done such a good job of compartmentalising it that while he was certain that he'd known that Anthony worked as a consultant for the Air Corps, Steve had just assumed that since he wasn't a pilot, he'd never have to run into him. He'd been with the Air Corps for almost ten years, ever since he was eighteen years old, and could likely count on one hand the number of civilians he'd interacted with at the base during that time.

"Yeah, but, even if we assume Pym was right and the particles don't follow the rules as stated by the Planck Scale, then that means there's no good way to predict what might happen once we start messing with this thing again," Tony said. He huffed out a sharp breath, tilting his head at Scott. "It might mean that you just happened to accidentally survive thanks to some billion-to-one cosmic fluke. Not exactly what I would call great odds."
Uncle Bucky pursed his lips as he stood up from his chair, placing it back into its place at the table and looking more nervous than Peter had ever seen him before.
"Nah," Gwen said with a shake of her head. She grabbed onto the end of her ponytail, giving it a light tug. "My father's side of the family still lives in the Bronx, and my mom's is in Jersey. We don't see each other that often though. My dad and his brothers don't always get along."
"Shut up, you goddamn brat!" Stane yelled as he got right into Image Peter's face. "You will comply or you will die, you got that? And once we have you, we're gonna do the same thing to every single member of that family of yours, you understand me? Every single one, starting with that asshole Captain America! And then we'll see how high and mighty you all are up there in your goddamn Tower!"
"I don't want him to worry about me, Tony," Steve said firmly. "I don't want you to worry about me either. I—"
"Ah," Tony murmured, nodding. In the three weeks since Scott had showed up on their doorstep, both he and Steve and they and the rest of the team had had numerous discussions about the fact that they were basically "playing God", for lack of a better term.
"Uhh," Steve stammered, his heart seizing in his chest as he looked over at Natasha, who appeared to be just as shocked as he felt. "Um… can you explain a bit more about what you mean? Fix all of this… how?"
"Ah, no," Carol said. "But since I have a tendency to fly through ships, I usually try to avoid them."
Steve let out a rather cheeky grin. "Or something." He grabbed Tony's left hand, kissing his finger over his wedding ring. "I don't buy jewellery like this for just anyone, you know."
"Are you sure, little guy?" Steve asked. "We've been at this for almost three hours now, you have to be getting tired."
Dad shot Papa one of his not-so-subtle I-told-you-so looks. "Yeah, and that physics test you had yesterday? How'd that go?"
A series of rapid rifle shots suddenly pierced through the air, and Steve glanced to his right to find Bucky engaged with two HYDRA soldiers on top of the tank. He immediately took off towards them, leaping onto the tank and swinging his shield, hitting one soldier square on the chin and sending him flying off the side. He quickly ducked behind his shield as Bucky slammed the butt of his rifle between the shoulder blades of the second soldier, knocking him off with a quick elbow to the chest.
"Can you tell us now, little guy?" he said softly. He moved his hand to the back of Peter's neck, digging the pads of his fingers into Peter's tight muscles as Dad's jaw twitched in anticipation.
With a soft groan Tony pulled off his glasses, rubbing at his stinging eyes. He had just finished—or as finished as he could be before Peter had a chance to look everything over—the final design for the tesseract containment vessel, one that required slightly more vibranium than he had called for in his original calculations but would then compensate by boosting the energy output by at least another seventy-five percent.
“Ready,” calls the announcer, prompting Steve to strip out of his warm-up pants and check the fit of his goggles.  He leaves his warm towel and jacket on until the very last second, sucking in a few quick, short breaths as he climbs up onto his starting block.
"Oh!" Steve gasped as he the familiar sound of Tony's repulsors filled his ears. He instinctively ducked as he watched Tony fly over his counterpart's head flanked by James and Sam, all three of them firing at the relentless advance of Thanos' war dogs, while to Alt-Steve's left, Hulk let out a ground-shaking roar as he thundered across the plain alongside an absolutely gigantic Scott Lang, both of them swinging and stomping their limbs as war dogs flung in every direction.
"Yeah, I bet he got a kick outta that," muttered Tony. "Thanks, J. Tell Pete that we miss him once he wakes up in the morning, yeah? And we'll hopefully see him soon? Tell him Papa will make him some hot chocolate when we get home, he'll love that."
"Pretty sure I've told you that more than once, honeybunch," Tony said. "And I'm also pretty sure that Pete will riot if his dinner gets delayed any longer than absolutely necessary, so we should probably get going on it."
“In third place, from France, Jacques Dernier!”  As the crowd cheers, Steve hoists himself out of the pool, grabbing his towel to blot his face before offering his hand to Jacques.
"It's okay, sweetheart," Steve whispered. He trailed the pad of his thumb along Tony's too-warm cheekbone, fighting the urge to just pick him up and cart him off to the hospital against his wishes. "I'm just worried. You look like you don't feel good at all, and—"
him. I lost our son, and—" He held up his right hand, examining it as if he somehow didn't recognise it. "Pete fell apart right in my arms 'cause I didn't do enough to stop it, and there is no such thing as healing from that."
"Nah, it's okay buddy," Tony said, ruffling Peter's hair. "As long as you do your homework after dinner."
Especially if it helped to ease his husband's mind a bit. After Steve's month-long sejour in the almost-invisible HYDRA prison five months ago, Tony was still hyper-aware of anything he and the rest of the team could do to help shoulder some of Steve's mental burden. Tony—with Peter's help—had made sure that Steve kept his regular weekly therapy sessions with Sam Wilson, but knowing Steve as well as he did, Tony found it unlikely that he was allowing himself to work through the trauma he had endured as well as he should.
“Steve?  Cap, are you—oh holy shit!” Tony exclaims as he suddenly appears as if out of nowhere.  He kneels next to Steve, his gauntlets retracting as he reaches his hands towards him.  “Oh my God, Steve, you—your
Steve thought as he came to an abrupt stop a second or so later, sucking in a deep breath as he took in the scene in front of him.
And then, after they were done eating, Tony led Steve over to the living room couch and took out his phone.
Steve thought, blinking back tears. Even though it was still the early twenties and the Great Depression had not yet hit, his and Ma's finances were precarious, forcing Ma to carefully budget each week to ensure they didn't slip into the red. So for her to sacrifice an entire quarter's worth of food or medicine to allow Steve to buy something that one might consider rather frivolous was absolutely nothing to sneeze at.
As Peter had pointed out way too many times in the past for Tony to keep track, he tended to have a blind spot when it came to Obie, and for something this gargantuan, he simply could not afford to have any impairments in his vision.  No matter how small.
Tony's heart gave a painful lurch at Steve's overt sincerity, as if he still couldn't believe it. "Babe, you don't ever have to thank me for loving you. It's involuntary now. Like breathing."
"Yeah," Steve murmured. "I was determined to rid the world of HYDRA, even if it meant sacrificing myself."
Peter thought as he scanned Thanos' line up and down, noting that they didn't seem at all confused by the pause in the battle.
"A few," he said carefully. "But I'd rather not latch onto one or more of them until we're able to decrypt more of that data."
"Yeah, hon," Tony answered. He sucked in a deep breath, jerking his head towards Bruce. "Calculations are done and JARVIS is getting started on rendering the devices now, so… we should probably decide who's gonna be the first to go in."
“I have no doubt,” Steve said, shifting slightly as Peter arranged the pieces on the board.  “Is there a reason why you don't want to do that, Peter?”
Steve's look of pure, barely-contained bliss combined with his rather stern Captain's voice was so incredibly erotic that Tony almost came right then and there. Most of the time during their lovemaking sessions Tony would've already given Steve either a handjob or a blowjob to help him take the edge off, but other times, like this one, Tony just somehow knew that Steve didn't want it. That he wanted to push his self-control to its limit, just like he pushed himself on his morning runs.
"Yes, but you're still not," Steve said as his eyebrows knitted together in what Tony had already nicknamed his worry wrinkle. "You look worried, Tony. How can I help?"
Tony’s actually told Steve that a few times.  Like he’s rather proud of his ability to calculate multi-variable equations in his head.
"Steve!" Sam said as Tony wheeled Steve in, feeling more foolish than he had in years with his four useless limbs and dark wraparound glasses. "You're gonna be okay?"
Tony nodded, biting his lip as he tipped his head against Steve's chest. As long as the drones were online and functional, things should be okay until the morning.
Steve and Tony knew a lot of it came from the fact that Peter was so young. Even Steve had once been forced to admit that if he had possessed superpowers when he was a teenager, he would've believed he was invincible too.
Maybe that's why they were so determined to recapture him, to experiment on him to try and figure out how he had been able to resist their conversion procedures.
"Yeah, it would," Bruce said sadly. "Once the snapped people return, they'll be just as vulnerable as anyone else, so…"
—Peter was gone, but he had a strong feeling that had less to do with him and more to do with them not wanting to talk about it. Peter supposed he couldn't blame them much, since it didn't really matter anymore anyway. But the pain and guilt he saw flare up in his father's eyes whenever that period of time was mentioned was so visceral that Peter had half a mind to suggest to Papa that Dad talk to Uncle Sam about it.
. I'm the luckiest man in the entire world to be able to love you, and to be loved by you." He paused, his lower lip shaking as he trailed his free hand down Tony's cheek. "Sweetheart, no matter what happens with this mission, I—"
But Steve had shushed him with a gentle finger against his lips, followed by a soft kiss.  “No,” he’d murmured.  “I know what you're gonna say, and none of it’s true.  You're it for me, sweetheart, and I’m gonna prove it to you.  Whatever it takes.”
"It was really nice of your dad to let you borrow his car today," she said as Peter opened the passenger door of the bright orange Audi, holding her bag while she slid inside. Dad had transmitted the key frequency to his phone once he and Papa had dropped it off, reminding him to be extra careful on the busy streets.
To Peter's shock, instead of being pleased at his remark, Dad's face fell, like he was suddenly ashamed of something. He turned back to his workstation, mumbling under his breath as he typed.
"Actually, that's not a bad idea," said James. "She'd definitely be nice to have around during that fight."
"Hey, none taken," John said, raising his hands. "I'm not looking forward to the possibility of having to fire on any other Langaran pilots."
“No, I’m—” Steve starts, then breaks off.  Tony is right; the serum does do its best repair work when he’s not expending any unnecessary energy.
"Um… okay," Peter said as he watched her go, flinching at another ear-splitting crash. "Then I guess I'll just wait here?"
"Okay, Bruce, I understand," Steve said in his Captain's voice. "But first I need you to tell me what happened. Where's Thor?"
“Ahh, Colonel Rhodes!” Obie said as he jumped to his feet, nearly tripping over the leg of his chair in his haste to set down his cigar.  “I wasn’t expecting to see you here this morning, Tony must’ve forgotten to tell me you were stopping by!”  He stepped around his desk, his upper lip curling into a sneer as he noticed Tony’s close proximity to Steve.  “And it seems like you’ve brought some of your Army buddies with ya, hmm?  I guess I always thought you weren't too friendly with the Army folks.  Something ‘bout an interbranch rivalry?  Or am I just making that up?”
"Steve, you've gotta make it back. You've just got to, 'cause I can't—I just can't live—and Pete—honey, he misses you so much, and—"
Thanos sneered, his ugly purple nose only a few centimetres away from Peter's. "Your boy, huh?" he said as he raised the gauntlet towards the sky, triggering something that sounded like an avalanche of rocks thundering down onto the planet. "Let's see how he likes losing a child!"
"I don't think guns are gonna work on it," Steve said as he took off for the opposite side, trying to stay behind the creature's back. "Where're Nat and Clint?"
Uncle Bucky tipped his head back, running his hand through his hair. "Look, Peter, I think what I should do is tell Sam about all of this, okay? Then he and Colonel Rhodes can bring it up with Tony, and—"
"No, I'm not really sure that it will," Peter mumbled. He leaned forward, reaching for his tablet on the coffee table. "I—we—um… we got a new assignment in our Government class yesterday, we're supposed to choose one of the bills that are pending debate in the Senate and write about it… and when I went looking through them, I—I found—I found—"
“Oh, yes,” says Mags.  “My oldest granddaughter worked as a lifeguard while she was in college, and she always said the chlorine helped to keep her sinuses clear, so it’s probably good for the lungs too, hmm?”
But what he wouldn't give to have even one of them there now. Because surely the magic they could perform with his former home would somehow translate into bringing his son back to life.
"Understood," said Papa. "Thank you, Colonel. And if you don't mind, if you could let Carol know about Bucky, I'd really appreciate it."
"It was," Steve said, rather sheepishly. "I'm not ashamed to admit that I enjoyed it. I'd always wished for a brother or sister, but after my papa was killed Ma insisted that she'd never fall in love again, so… Bucky was the closest thing I ever had to a brother."
Papa gave a nod, smiling softly. "You're right, little guy," he said, clapping a hand on Peter's shoulder. "You're pretty smart, you know that?"
Tony’s jaw was hard as iron as he nodded.  He needed to get the hell out of there before his resolve started to weaken.
"I don't want to be put under," Steve cut in, squeezing Tony's hand so hard that he popped two of his knuckles. "Tony,
But like Steve frequently told Peter while they worked on Peter’s history homework together, learning history was paramount to ensuring that the bad stuff was never repeated, and Tony supposed that HYDRA’s quiet concealment within SHIELD for seventy years would definitely qualify as bad.
out of it; he couldn't remember the last time he'd allowed someone to sneak up on him like that. "Captain, do you think you can walk?"
"At the moment pretty much anything out of the ordinary worries me," answered Tony. "But since my anxiety level is already close to bumping up against the atmospheric barrier, then I s'pose this'll just slam it right up against it."
"No! He won't last that long!" Steve shouted back. He was dangerously close to panicking, his smoke-filled lungs pulling way too many memories of his childhood illness from the deep recesses of his mind. "The fire's sucked all the oxygen out of his cockpit! He'll suffocate!"
It’s not until Tony’s left eyebrow quirks slightly up that Steve realises he’s been too busy staring at the man’s face to answer his question, something else that Natasha’s seen fit to point out on more than one occasion.
Natasha's concerned grey eyes flicked between Steve and Tony as she swallowed hard. "It's probably best that we show you."
, though.  Why Steve, when there has to be a dozen different regular swimming teams scattered across New York City that the kid could join?  It’s not like Steve would be barred from taking on his own swimmer, as both Natasha and Clint have several middle and high school students that they teach outside of their regular university coaching duties.  But both of them advertise their availability at those schools, which is how they recruit their students, while Steve, on the other hand, does not.
Tony sputtered out a laugh, his beautiful brown eyes glassy as they locked with Steve’s.  “You're seriously the best thing to ever happen to us, so… how in the hell could I possibly say no?”
“Well… I suppose that could potentially reflect poorly on yourself and Peter,” Pepper said diplomatically.  “If indeed any such bias existed.”
"Just… hold on for a second, babe, okay?" Tony said gently. He set down the tablet and reached for Steve's hand, pressing it to his chest over his heart. "You know that I'm not dismissing what you're saying here, and I'm absolutely gonna put Toomes first on my list for re-checking, but you also know that Pete's gonna completely revolt if we don't let him just be a normal kid from time to time, and that's only gonna make things all that much worse."
The very same face that currently belonged to the man who was just about to jump out of yet another plane into yet another disputed-borders country because of yet another conflict that Nick Fury had felt that SHIELD needed to stick its nose into.
"Long as you're back by the beginning of August or so," he said once they had paused to catch their breath. "And preferably both in one piece."
"No!" Peter squawked as panic washed over him like a wave. His eyes were completely useless now, his hearing dulled by blood rushing past his ears. He hadn't had a full-on asthma attack since Afghanistan, but suddenly the memories of how he had almost died in the middle of that desert came rushing back, only increasing his panic.
Leave it to Steve, who had been just about as pure as freshly fallen snow before he met Tony, to quickly become the biggest tease Tony had ever been with.
"No, mo grá, please, don't," Steve whispered as he flattened his palm over the scars on Tony's chest, framed by the dog tags that Tony wore around his neck. "Please, don't think like that. Is breá liom tú, agus ba mhaith liom tú a shásamh. Inis dom cad ba mhaith leat."
"All right." Tony wasn't sure how much more discussion he could take at the moment, but if it helped Steve to sleep better so he could be more alert for his patrol in the morning, he would do it.
"You like that, don't you baby?" Tony murmured, kissing and nibbling across Steve's neck to his collarbone. Steve nodded frantically as he fumbled with Tony's shirt buttons, getting frustrated towards the end when the tiny round circles refused to cooperate and just ripping the shirt off of him.
he thought as he carried the steaming mug down to his bedroom, rapping gently on the door before stepping inside. He found Tony propped up against his pillows, wearing one of Steve's zippered sweatshirts with his tablet resting on his chest as he dozed. Setting down the mug, Steve touched the backs of his fingers first to Tony's forehead, then his cheek, relieved when his skin didn't seem to be any hotter than it had been earlier. The rasp in his breathing was still there, but thankfully it wasn't any worse either.
"Copy that," said Sam as he stepped closer to Peter, laying a hand on the headboard of the bed. "One."
Steve visibly flinched at the sound of Peter's name, and Tony reached for his hand, giving it a reassuring squeeze. "All right. And you still say it'll take another day before we can transfer this information to the Tower?"
"Can you remind me to ask Dad about the heater in my Spider-Man suit? If the weather's gonna be this cold I need to make it more adjustable."
And while he never would have considered swimming in the past, the possibility grew on him quickly, and he was so excited when he found out that Olympic gold medalist Steve Rogers was working at Empire State.  Since one of Peter’s classmates, Cindy, takes Krav Maga lessons from Ms Romanoff and really enjoys them, Peter figured it couldn't hurt to ask if Mr Rogers would be interested in taking him on as a swimming student.
"And you'd probably be much worse than you are now," insisted Steve. "Which is even more reason to rest, don't you think? It's much easier to fight off germs when you let your body rest."
Steve breathed in, his eyes glassy as he nodded. "I promise. As long as you promise me that you'll try to get some sleep while I'm gone."
"It would end the war," Steve finished. "I mean, a source of unlimited clean energy would be a pretty impressive peace offering, so I can't imagine why it wouldn't end the war."
"Yeah, I'm sure we will," Ned said with a grin. "Other than that though, it's been pretty boring around here. I was really looking forward to coming up to the Compound."
"Uhh, it means more than just a friend," he replied sheepishly, turning his face into his pillow. "Kinda like how Dad and Papa like each other, only not quite so… intense."
"As long as you report for dinner duty at six, all right? I'm pretty sure Uncle Bucky and Uncle Sam will be joining us."
, of all people, would ever make such a mistake. Now, could you please show me how big a large popcorn is?"
A short pause followed Peter's question, where Peter could've sworn he could imagine JARVIS's eyebrows knitting together, if in fact the UI actually had eyebrows.
"All right, little fishy, let's see what we're supposed to be doing here," Tony muttered as he located the container of fish food in the mass of clutter that covered the table. He held it at arm's length, attempting to read the tiny print on the label and giving up after about three frustrating seconds. "JARVIS, do you know how many of these things I'm supposed to give him?"
"That'll just come with practise, buddy," he murmured. "You remember the first suit that I built, right? The one that you said looked like the Iron Giant?"
Instinctively, Peter stepped back, his hand covering the front pocket where his phone sat. "Um… why?"
Steve's blood pressure plummeted like a rock. "Uh, your dad's coming today? He wasn't here yesterday?"
"All right, all right, I don't need to hear the entire pitch." Tony stepped forward, entering Lang's personal space. "Mr Lang, I shouldn't have to tell you that all of this is contingent upon the fact that you will swear, for the record right here and now, to not
"So, you still gonna bail on Sam and me this afternoon?" Bucky asked as they stepped into the showers. Steve closed his eyes, moaning softly as the hot water pelted down onto his tight neck and shoulders. It had been a long, hard patrol shift that day for some reason, with lots of enemy sightings just across the DMZ line as if they knew that Steve's mind was being pulled in a hundred different directions and were hoping to exploit it.
"Long story short, I didn't tell Tony that I already knew his son because I was afraid he'd be upset that I could go and visit him when he couldn't," Steve said. "I was gonna tell him tonight, actually, but—but he figured it out this morning… while I was out running, and—"
And then the gifts, well… Tony had to admit that the team had outdone themselves. He was positive that Peter had never before been as spoiled as he was on that morning, opening gift after gift of everything from more geeky, science-nerd t-shirts—a favourite thing for Bruce to give him—to his very own new car—from Tony and Steve, although Bucky had chosen the colours for it—to his very own fish tank and accessories from Bucky and Sam, complete with a cute little blue and gold betta that he promptly named Finley.
"That may be, but I highly doubt that Mr Stark and Captain Rogers would include you in such a category," said JARVIS. "In fact—"
If he were truly brave, Steve would've seen Brock for what he was way back in the beginning, instead of allowing him to take complete control over Steve’s life for the last three-plus years.
There was a pause, followed by a stern, "I am fairly certain that your father would not approve of this line of questioning, young man."
"Pardon me, Master Peter, but Miss Stacy is on the line again," JARVIS said gently. "And she sounds quite upset."
Steve's frown grew even deeper. "Well, that's the weird part. It says here that they found him hiding inside an empty salt shaker, but… I have to think it's got to be a joke, because… a grown man just can't hide inside a salt shaker, right?"
"Uhh, not till after I broke out of jail," Lang answered. "But that only happened because I was trying to break back into Hank's house so I could return what I took."
Dad let out a heavy sigh. "I don't know, big guy. If it would've meant the difference between making a mess and Steve not being tossed off of yet another fucking building, I'd've taken the mess." He winced again as he glanced back at Peter. "Sorry, bud."
"Brian, this is Captain Steve Rogers and Mr Tony Stark," said Stacy, taking his coffee cup before it could drop onto the floor. "My daughter is in their son's class at school."
He found both Dad and Papa sitting in the living room when he got home, trying to pretend they weren't waiting up for him but too relieved that he was home to really hide it. He gave them a brief synopsis of the game, including when Uncle Thor's picture flashed up on the huge screen inside the arena as he cheered during one of the on-ice fights.
"Yes, yes, my dear, I've heard that story already," said Maria. "By the time you were sixteen you were already living on your own—"
As evenings go, it wasn't too bad. They ate dinner with Peter, as they usually did, and then Tony headed back to his lab, determined to get Igor figured out before he and Steve went to bed. They had struck up a bargain once Steve's weird dreams had started that they would try and go to bed together every night, thinking it would help them both get more—and better—sleep, and so far it had worked out fairly well.
Steve huffed, wracking his exhausted mind for possible reasons why the Chitauri would suddenly cease their offensive. Any decent attacking army would first conduct reconnaissance, and therefore would know that the main SHIELD building would be mostly vacant after business hours. The only people who would still be in the building would be the overnight security people, who were responsible for guarding—
Peter had barely finished chewing the final bite of his cupcake when his phone beeped, indicating that it was time for him to jump off the truck. Tightening his backpack straps, Peter pulled his hood up over his head, sucked in a deep breath, and jumped, rolling as he hit the spongy grassy median to avoid injury just like Papa had taught him. He shot to his feet before he even came to a complete stop, running across the highway and heading for the nearest boat launch. It was still very early in the morning, around 4am, and there wouldn't be any boats leaving for Jekyll Island for about three more hours, so Peter was hoping to find a public bathroom or some other small building where he could curl up and catch a bit of sleep before the first boat left. Once he arrived on Jekyll Island, Peter was hoping against hope that the forecasted early morning fog would be thick enough to hide his presence as he flew towards the island prison building.
"Thanks." Draping his jacket across the back, Steve settled his large frame down onto the uncomfortable chair, crossing his legs. "I fly patrols that monitor along the DMZ border every day. I was up in the air by 0630."
“Oh, goody,” says Tony, gently nudging Peter with his elbow.  “Did ya hear that, bud?  Steve says you’re gonna be even more hungry than usual.”
"That's okay, we don't have to," Steve said quickly. He jerked his head towards the notebook in Peter's lap. "So, what do you like to draw?"
"Yeah," Tony said, swiping at his eyes as he nodded. Peter's eyes were already closed, his shallow breaths steady and even.
Unfortunately, it never was long enough, and soon enough he and Tony were both crying out as they spilled over their joined hands. Steve collapsed down on Tony once he was spent, tears welling in his eyes and dripping onto Tony's hair before he even realised they were there.
A chorus of nods and murmured assent followed Steve's final words, with JARVIS speaking up a few seconds later.
"Seems more like they're all coming for you, Cap!" yelled John. "Hang on, I've got ya." A second later Steve heard a massive explosion, the shockwave from the blast impacting the back of his aircraft.
"Yes," Steve whispered, cringing as a sharp stab of pain lanced him right in the gut. It felt so wrong of him to wish that somehow Tony and Peter would both be spared from Thanos' devastating snap, but he still wished it anyway.
He paused, pulling back so abruptly that Tony's belly swooped in fear. "Tony," he said as he pressed his forehead to his. "Tony, I—I've gotta—I want to tell you—" He broke off, frowning slightly as he pressed another hard kiss to Tony's lips. "I—I love you, Tony. I'm—I'm in love with you, and I want—I want to ask you if… Will you—will you come to my bed with me tonight?"
Maybe it was time to start working on another override protocol for JARVIS, and finally see what they'd been hiding ever since they got back from Mongolia.
"So nice of them, since it almost did anyway," Peter grumbled as he continued to scroll through the file, physically forcing his eyelids to stay open.
"Thank you, Your Highness," Steve said. He offered the prince his hand, which T'Challa shook with a firm grip. "On behalf of all the Avengers, please allow me to offer my sincere condolences on the loss of your father."
"Well, just in case either of you were wondering, the Force doesn't work either," Gwen said, rather sheepishly. "Or at least I can't seem to make it work, so…"
There was no doubt in Tony’s mind that Peter deserved so much better than him.  Someone who didn't come with all of the tabloid fodder and the oh-so-flattering nicknames, and the heightened risk of being snatched off the street by some raving lunatic just because his surname happened to be Stark.
"You're damn right I will, honey," Tony murmured. He let out a soft moan as Steve's lips teased his neck, just below his ear.
"Thanks for the warning," Steve replied. Tony knew he still got a bit jumpy whenever he heard Tony's repulsors go off in the lab. Tony had adjusted their sound frequency once Steve admitted that they reminded him of the HYDRA weapons he'd fought against during the war, but with Steve's super-sensitive ears there was only so much he could do.
Not exactly an easy undertaking. In essence, Natasha had taken on the jobs of both Nick Fury and Steve, and while normally Steve would have protested having her take over duties that he considered his, at the moment he couldn't seem to find it in himself to be upset about it.
"So… what, did she go up and ask him for his autograph or something?" asked Peter. "How'd she even know it was him?"
"That's right," Tony answered, hoping that he sounded like he meant it. He burrowed even closer, his throat tightening when Steve laced their fingers together in front of him. He had no qualms that either of them would get much—if any—sleep, but that was okay.
"I'm sure I will, little guy," said Steve. He reached for his own cup of hot cocoa, giving Tony a wink across the top of it. "Are you ready for the fireworks?"
"I think three chaperones for a hockey game date are enough, buddy," said Tony. "If things go well you can invite Ned another time."
But after what happened in the Games, is Steve really the best person to be trying to coach someone?  How does he know he wouldn't just screw the poor kid up?  Steve always thought he was pretty good at the technical dynamics part of swimming, always finding himself critiquing the other swimmers’ stroke techniques and explosiveness off the starting blocks when he was in high school and college.  But when it came down to it, even after identifying the minor issue in his own stroke that was causing his shoulder pain, neither Steve nor Phillips could seem to correct it enough to prevent the injury from getting worse.
"Goddamnit, Pete, what the hell are you doing here?" Dad shrieked as the alien growled, his clawed hand curling around Peter's body and sending him flying across the street into a fountain. "You're supposed to be back at the Tower!"
Or, at least not while on only one waterski. He had gotten the hang of two skis pretty quickly, but trying to ski on a single was still giving him trouble.
"Exactly how many unfulfilled contracts did you leave behind in the wake of your rather abrupt decision to halt your company's weapons manufacturing?" asked Davis.
Gwen's eyes crinkled as she smiled, biting her bottom lip like she often did. "No, I'm not. I love that you're Spider-Man, Peter, you know I do. But I love
"Well, we're not gonna let that happen," Natasha stated. "We're doing this to bring people back, not to lose anyone else."
"Mmm. Well, I doubt she's the only one," Peter said with a smirk. "You should've seen this bunch of girls that were following us around at the department store this past weekend. They got so bad that Papa finally had to ask them to leave us alone so I could try on some new jeans." Peter frowned at the memory, of the gaggle of girls oohing and aahing over his papa, and then giggling behind their hands as they tried to pretend like they weren't following them.
"Okay, but I'm not sure that a few FBI agents are gonna be enough against what I'm afraid we'd be up against," Tony said softly.
"Hey, Papa?" he said as he sat down next to the coffee table. "Would you wanna play a game of chess?"
Steve's ma had told him a few stories about General Matthew O'Brien from back when he held Colonel Phillips's position as Commander of the Air Corps. According to her, while he had apparently liked Steve's father well enough, he had been known throughout the Air Corps for having a particularly quick temper and for his tendencies to hold grudges, often keeping old grievances tucked away in order to pull them out whenever he felt it necessary.
“It would just be the bookstore.  I promise,” he added once he’d swallowed another bite of his pizza.  “The security guys didn't seem to have any problem with it today.”
"I know," Steve answered. "But at this point it's almost like a train wreck. I can't seem to look away."
"That's right, honey, I've got you. And as soon as we get you all fixed up we can go see Pete and make his entire year, okay?"
“‘Cause even bullets that act like bombs still just look like bullets,” Peter murmured.  “Which means… no one would question it.”
Steve's lips curled into the slightest of smiles. "No, I suppose you don't. It would take a very special person to put up with me."
Panic suddenly welled deep inside Steve’s gut, and he stopped, squeezing his eyes closed as he tried to focus in on his breathing.  He’d never heard of such a thing as a panic attack until just a few weeks ago when he’d been woken by a particularly bad dream, one that had him crashing the
"No, you don't have to fix it," Uncle Bucky said sternly. "What you need to do is get as much rest as you can so that when Tony does get Steve home, they'll be able to see you right away. Okay?"
Although, he wasn't exactly sure how helpful they would be against the fire demon, who was now busy chewing through the metal supports holding up the massive movie screen, sending it crashing to the floor.
"Cap—Captain America—I mean, Captain Rogers," he stuttered as he glanced up at his hand, frowning like he didn't realise what he'd done. "And Iron Man—Mr Stark. Um… hi, I'm—I'm—"
“It’s not bragging if it’s true, Pete,” Tony said firmly.  He shot Steve a wink that went straight to his crotch.  “Kid’s so good he could join the championship circuit if he wanted to.”
“Oh, that’s a good one, Tony!” he said, still cackling.  He clapped Tony on the shoulder again, giving him a not-so-gentle shake.  “Look, all I’m asking is that you just remember to keep me in the loop.  I really don’t care how many aspirin put-together thingamajiggies you make, just so long as I know what’s going on.  All right?  Can ya do that for me?”
Just then the colonel grabbed Winter Soldier around his neck, slamming his head back against the hard metal of the chair. "Это ваша обязанность подчиняться, солдат!"
