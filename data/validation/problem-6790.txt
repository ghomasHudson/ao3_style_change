Steve tenses behind him and looks down, noticing that his attention isn’t on the TV and clearly hasn't been for a while. The arm with the bracelet slips out of Tony’s grip to wrap around his chest and pull him tighter against Steve's front.
Whichever way you look at it, he's still a guest in this place. A guest reminding of someone loved and gone, and that doesn't make the matter any easier.
When he returned the parchment, he smiled and bid the messenger goodbye politely, but James saw the devious spark in his eyes as the man left the tent.
Tonight, Steve makes an exception. Whatever that scent was, he doesn’t want to explore his reaction to it any further. The taste he’s gotten so far is enough to know it’d only cause trouble if he were to be subjected to it any more.
Natalia mused that he was likely to simply enjoy watching a group of men in a show of brute strength, but she opted to keep this notion to herself.
Carol was hard pressed to admit that her words held truth. Lord Stark may rule over his land with genuine kindness and treated all its people like equals, but with that there unfortunately came no guarantee of safety or extended leniency for deeds frowned upon within its borders.
despite his best efforts to be gentle. Maybe Steve would even come, at some point, and Tony wouldn't get to because the only way he'd be allowed would be if he got off from just a cock in his ass.
"Glad to have you back with me, Cap. But say, uh, do you mind?" He paints over the sudden awkwardness with a lopsided smirk and points to Steve's hand, still clasped tight around his own.
The other man is kneeling right in front of the once brown and white checkered cow, studying the teeth marks in the flesh. Tony can barely stand the sight as it is; he doesn't know how this madman does it. In fact, he needs something to settle his stomach. Right now.
Pepper cries in Rhodey's arms and Steve isn't going to make the kid carry Tony's body off the battlefield, so that leaves him to the task.
It hasn’t felt that intense in a long time. His chest is tight and hot with it, pulse knocking in his throat and his gut coiled into a million knots of pleasure he feels might just release any moment considering how tight his balls feel already. He's starting to think this might turn out to be the best sex they’ve had in a while. Not that it usually isn’t spectacular, but this is otherworldly.
It's still… bad. It feels as if it's not his, any of this. He doesn't know if he wants it, or if he has the willpower to get rid of it. Maybe he should just get this whole damn thing over with and propose to Steve now (as opposed to on their anniversary) so the guy won't change his mind and run while he's still able to in the meantime. He'll probably feel too guilty to divorce him after he witnesses all that money going into a wedding extravaganza meant to befit a Stark, right?
He would be falling into a minor panic right about now, were it not for the weight on his chest he becomes aware of with a sudden, intense jolt. Tony exhales and lifts his head, coming face to face with Steve who's staring down at him, taken aback.
He pauses, takes a few shuddering breaths. The novel crook of his lip belongs to a bitter, self-deprecating smile. "Don't worry, I've had decades to work out the balance. I'll get it right this time. Promise."
and the paint on the exterior is chipping, worn down by weather and time. However, all this is secondary information to the one characteristic that catches Steve’s attention and that he knows has made Tony pick this place above all other readily available ones–there are no windows. No windows, and the gate is sturdy, able to hold back a great number of bodies and even more when reinforced from the inside.
Tony blinks down at his breakfast, a little dumbfounded and suddenly without appetite. He flexes his fingers. The bandage around his hand isn’t exactly conducive to making him seem more responsible. He shifts in his seat again and winces. Yeah, no, this particular flavor of ache isn’t workshop-related–unless one were to count getting railed over the workbench as a workshop-related incident, which he isn’t.
The people of the castle – knights included – had long learned that their resident physician was not to be provoked.
His hair was plastered to his forehead, skin flushed, bottom lip littered with teeth marks, eyes dark and the gleam in them sultry. He was filthy, the personification of Steve's dirtiest, most carnal desire, and drop-
Everything he can do now is end it. Steve puts as much force into the next downward swing as possible; there’s a crunch, something that indicates he must be through the bone now, finally. Tony utters another blood-curdling scream and Steve's never despised himself more than in this very moment, drenched in the blood of the man he loves. Tony’s arm in his grip twitches violently still, his head bowed over the counter and turned away as if he might turn away from the agony and it might stop.
Mealtime comes. Tony knows better than to wolf the food down at once; instead, he picks it apart piece by piece.
Sometimes, there was a Caramel Mocha Latte, or double-cheeseburgers – three for Tony after Sam, the heathen, refused his second serving – or the pizza that's somehow always around the compound, or anything else that tickled his fancy. It doesn't help that his metabolism is slowing down – not to mention that this is just another in a whole slew of confused bodily mechanisms that are (to put it mildly) just done with his antics after fifty-and-then-some years of him ignoring their wails of agony.
But as it is, there’s a blade pointed at Tony–who is still himself, human and hurting–which is the first object that catches his attention when he blinks his eyes open slowly. He sees the unambiguous shape for what it is, namely a weapon directed at him with a wordless threat.
With his many injuries that had yet to heal, the Lord was struggling to descend from the wheelhouse back onto main land. And of course, Rogers, ever attentive to those around him, came to his aid as soon as he had noticed the man’s struggle.
Tony nods, but the words seem to go right past him. He wipes the tears away quickly, hastily, as if they're a minor annoyance.
Eventually, Tony's had enough. He erupts in raw, scathing rage and nips Steve's hopes in the bud. (Steve lets him.) There's no plan, no way out, no reconciliation. “No trust, liar,” Tony spits, his gaze acrid and voice venomous.
He pats the mare's neck as they ride; she's got a dark chestnut coloring and goes by the name of Butterfingers. Tony doesn't see how that's a fitting name for any horse, but then again, he's witnessed Rogers calling his strawberry roan
Tony's family is one that is, with one exception being his daughter, not related by blood, but by a bond forged by trust and the very people he's left behind. It's a wonderful thing to look at, this strong connection they have, even though it stings in a way that makes Steve long for a simpler time.
Steve is slicking up his prick, red and perfectly curved up his stomach, while Tony grabs the spare pillow next to him and pushes it underneath himself to elevate his hips (they'll be sure to complain anyway, but he couldn't care less).
“Uh, where,” he groans as gravity drives him back onto Steve’s length and brushes his prostate just enough to send a spike of heat straight to his dick. “Where do you want me to start?”
Aforementioned owner, a balding man with a stocky build, a gut to match and no people skills whatsoever, has been tending the bar day and night ever since the fateful day Tony semi-purposely got himself stranded in Red Rock. Considering this place probably is the man's life blood, Tony can see how he would get a little defensive about its obvious rodent infestation.
, yet still wanting and keeping him despite the greatest of odds, Tony's been getting… more comfortable. He knows that. He is very aware of that.
Cold sweat gathers at his temples, in the hollow of his throat, joining the moist patches that are already there, making his undershirt stick to his back and chest.
The easy expression went as quick as it had come. Lord Stark cleared his throat and looked down at his tightly clasped hands in front of him. He sniffed and returned Peter's inquisitive gaze, the faint lines around his eyes suddenly more prominent.
The core team of the Avengers gather in the lobby of the office space soon enough, minus Doctor Strange and King T'challa with their people. There's the attempt of a discussion on how to assist the public and countries of the world with further rebuilding efforts, but nobody appears entirely focused on the task at hand. They still have something else to deal with, and no matter how much Steve even dreads to think of it -- it has to be done.
that is periodically disrupted by late-night commercials. Tony suggested they have JARVIS put on whatever episodes he liked best, but Steve considers sitting through the commercial breaks ‘part of the experience’.
He gets a scoff in response – something that was maybe meant to be a chuckle but came out less humorous and more snide. The man studies him for another moment, expression unreadable. Finally, he waves the others to him and says, "I can see that. A'ight, boys, get 'em over here."
“Your scars are beautiful,” Steve says, his breath a fluttering caress over the marred, ugly skin. Tony shudders for no particular reason, swallows as he returns his gaze that is as earnest and loving as it is blue.
pretend it’s any other night, long before all this came to pass and they didn’t know any better; when these moments of togetherness were what they fought for, knowing they would return home and be in each other’s arms to forget about the world for a while.
Steve walks over to him just as he's turning off the flow of water and puts his finally empty plate in with the others. When Tony doesn't make to move, he hesitates– maybe he should volunteer to do the chore?
Steve moves on, follows the dusting of hair on his torso down and down, his hands a steady point of contact at Tony's sides. He reaches Tony's stomach and draws a circle of kisses around his belly button.
If you ask him, mastering indifference is key, and he’s the best in this métier for a reason. This line of business punishes the ones who wait, who pause and hear both sides, who allow doubt to tarnish the simplicity of the mission.
Five years later, Howard Stark died en route to an allied neighbor, three dozen raiders decimating his guards and torching the wheelhouse he had traveled in.
After his men had carried the unconscious Lord Stark off the field, James found himself face to face with a dirty blond man looking just the other side of thirty whom the battle had left the worse for wear.
He watches her do the same thing Tony did to scent him – she tilts her head toward him and sniffs, confusion apparent as her brows furrow in response to the results she gets.
“So, ah, do you mind,” he points at the sofa on which Tony is currently perched, surveilling the development of the fire. “Would you mind sleepin’ here, or d’ya want us to take turns?”
"Boy, this is gonna be awkward. Alright, J, give us human biology 101 here, please. And throw some charts and graphics in. But, uh, those that make the unsightly details easier on the eye, not worse."
The glare Tony shoots him is probably supposed to come off as chiding, but the willful curl of his lip gives his amusement away.
The sudden urgency in Steve's voice and the intensity of his gaze overwhelm him. Tony clears his throat and forces himself not to fidget as he attempts to remain matter-of-fact.
If Tony wasn't such a wreck, they'd be having a nice night sitting at that restaurant Steve's been wanting to take him to for weeks now. But because that isn't the reality they live in, Steve felt the need to stay in with him and try to convince that miserable excuse of a man in the mirror that he's less miserable than his brain keeps telling him.
He finds himself on a dirt road eventually and continues his walk there. A memory he can't recall yet is prodding the back of his mind, like an invisible fly buzzing around his head without pause.
. But I won't, considering I practically begged you to let me tag along," he answers, looking over at Rogers whose stubble-framed mouth quirks into a half-smirk at the last part.
Not that Steve is paying much attention. He's mainly savoring the sensation of Stark's insides tugging and spasming around his dick, a religious experience that ascribes a new meaning to the hollow word that is
–handsome just for you, how's that feel?" Tony asks, hoarse, and that's when Steve bows over him and cries out as he climaxes. He comes in a steady pulse, coating Tony's insides with another layer of his come, another irrefutable token of his attraction.
Tony lowers his armored hand, but it's still tilted in Steve's direction in what is unmistakably a warning.
Tony hears his voice in his mind, and he might not be at peace in the end but it’s a pleasant sound all the same. He is using Tony’s given name; not Carbonell, not Stark.
"You lead, then," he grins, pillowing his head on the other man's shoulder. It's comfortable enough he thinks there's a good chance he might nod off during the dance.
He's about to respond, a burst of laughter bubbling up from his throat at the thought of throwing this desperate, desperate omega to the sharks – and then Stark adds something that makes his blood run cold.
"Do you like to draw? We'd just need some more paper. I might not have your smarts, but I can draw a nice– uh, boat? Do you like boats in general or is it just the ones you built?"
"I'm just, I'm confused about my own–” he cuts himself off and sighs in frustration. “I don't know why I– Does it mean my brain can't differentiate between you two? Does it mean I didn't
As they climb the couple of stairs to the front porch, Tony shoots him a half-smile over his shoulder. "Thanks for this, though," he says after a beat. "I'm pretty sure Maria would've chewed my arm off if I'd made her wait another ten minutes for something other to eat than mini pretzels."
Steve rubs the woolen material between his fingers, looking up only to spot a small pile of clothing on the newly made bed. Tony made good on his promise.
The position of the furniture allowed him to see into the other chamber if he just leaned to the side a small bit.
Tony can make out the ornaments carved into the circle on the ground. He might've appreciated the artistry in it if he wasn't just about to hit literal rock bottom. In the last,
The ensuing silence drags on for the better part of ten seconds. Tony glances at the clock on the screen, about to remark that 1 am isn't late enough to justify the silent treatment, and then recalls that JARVIS couldn’t respond even if ordered to. Tony sighs and rubs his eyes, the burnt skin on the back of his hand pulling uncomfortably. Someone should remind him not to play with fire without J around to babysit.
it. He's had a merry ol' time coming to grips with his attraction – both sexual and romantic – to Steve being reciprocated, but the sight of them side by side in the mirror like this throws him for a loop in spite of it all.
Freed from the shackles of misguided morals, Steve has discovered that the criminal scum of this city are cunning. They have to be; the ones that aren’t go as quickly as they come, ants under Hi-dra’s boot. Who knows whether the man’s daughter existed? His tears may very well have been just as contrived as the raw desperation in his words, his cries a trick to sway the emotional parts of Steve’s hindbrain.
This was a trick question, she realized. James Rhodes was impressively impassive when he set his mind to it, but he had never been one to prefer a comfortable lie over a discomforting truth.
The thought is accompanied by a scoff aimed at his own inanity. Like time itself, this measurement is a construct that doesn’t hold power over the vast emptiness of space. None of it has real meaning once you step past the boundaries of planet Earth; days, weeks, months. What’s a year when time passes differently depending on where you are in the universe? Time isn’t a constant.
Steve's jaw is set in bitter determination and his mouth twisted into a thin line. Whatever it is he's decided, it's very clearly not debatable. Something about the way his eyes look makes Tony's gut clench with the sudden urge to back off and get the fuck away from the man as far and quickly as possible.
Steve rushes to explain himself. "That's not why I suggested it. You know there's nothing I want more than to stay here, but it's not working like this," he says, forcing out the words that are like barbed wire in his throat. He's fought multiple battles he thought he wouldn't return from, and yet this is one of the hardest things he's ever had to do.
Steve's swallows, his expression suddenly turning less determined and more miserable. "Well, I didn’t get an opportunity to do anything that might have mattered and there's an asshole wearing my face running around and taking advantage of you, so can I just… have this?"
Tony's closest family has gathered around him by now, Pepper leaning close and speaking quiet words, her face full of grief but as controlled as can be. A soft-spoken goodbye for a man on the brink between this world and the next.
“Daddy!” Maria has a skip in her walk when she comes in, throwing herself at Tony who barely manages to hold onto her and keep her from sliding down his chest again.
“C’mon,” he demands, voice just on this side of desperate. He pushes back against the palm resting on his asscheek, wiggles a little, and hears Steve draw in a sharp breath. Oh, Tony is very aware he isn't the only one who's had a tough month.
There's quick, shuffling footsteps coming up behind Tony. Steve hears them before the other man does, but the moment Tony picks up on the noise, he turns around and walks a few steps down the hallway to catch the little girl in his arms. He throws a look over his shoulder that Steve can't really define and then huddles over her, almost as if to shield her from vision.
"Romanoff is here," she says, neutral although the glint in her eyes betrays that she knows the meaning of the words to be a weightier one.
How ironic and unsurprising. In the very end, it always comes down to him and Steve. Tony wonders if this is the universe’s way of taunting him for ever thinking he could truly escape Steve Rogers.
Next week rolls around, Tony keeps improving, and Steve allows himself to believe in a tomorrow again.
Soon enough, he was positively slurring, stumbling over words and swallowing vowels like gulps of his beverage. Inebriated, his tongue became looser than it had been even in its natural state; Natasha lifted her head to listen for the first time that night as he spoke.
He tries to keep away from it, but even before his resolve breaks, there’s part of him that knows this is an exercise in futility. His willpower only reaches so far, and this past month has already tested his self-control to the limit. There isn’t much left in him.
A sliver of that too-smug smile is back. Steve's still leaning over him, and Tony doesn't fail to notice the slight tremble in his arms or the strain in his shoulders, but the man's got self-control for days when he has somewhere to channel it.
One moment, there's sweet nothingness. The next, his body is numb and burning all at once, but the fire is part of him now, hot and lethal though it runs through his veins. He can distantly sense a hard, cold surface beneath him. There's voices, loud but far away, fuelling the sharp ringing in his ears.
With time, Tony can move about on his own again, which gives Steve the freedom to do so as well. He doesn’t dare stray too far from the house, but patrols the surrounding area as usual again and their home feels safer for it. Once he is steady on his feet, there’s nothing Tony insists he can’t do by himself: changing his bandages, cooking their food, and finally, repairing a broken trap that Steve brings from the woods.
He shakes his head. “2023, originally. We, well–we swiped the Infinity Stones from different points in time, and I was supposed to put them back where they belonged. Including the Tesseract, which we took from a SHIELD facility in the 70s. But you know how that turned out.”
It makes sense, now, why the place seemed familiar but unrecognizable at the same time – he's only ever driven through the forest, but the destination at the end of the road stuck with him.
Natalia respected a bond of friendship no matter whom it concerned; still, she found this statement of interest. The carefully selected words of the resident steward would not let her go. It seemed the woman had claimed that not only had nothing happened, but there was no sheer possibility of romance with the Lord Stark she knew, even.
Tony smiles, stupid and more lovestruck than is warranted at his age, at his currently non-existent reflection in the fog-covered bathroom mirror. He tucks the damp towel around his waist and drags a hand over his mouth, noticing stubble in places it's not supposed to be.
Steve gets another cloth and soaks it in water, swapping it with the one currently placed on Tony's forehead that is warm to the touch.
"No.” The word is deathly quiet. Both his hunched posture and small voice are so unlike everything Tony knows about Steve Rogers it throws him for a loop. "But the first time I understood what you were,
A deep, pleased sound emerged from his own chest, escaping between his clenched teeth as he dared to pick up speed, nailing the man's prostate with every other thrust. (He hadn't had the fortune of having Tony like this before, but he damn well knew where his sweet spot was.)
It’s such an incredibly erotic sight Steve can’t help his dick giving an excited twitch – which makes the whole thing
"I fear I am no lady, Lord Stark," she said, "but I find myself grateful for your hospitality nonetheless."
She smiles when she tells him, small and wobbly, and something in his chest hurts in a way that has nothing at all and yet everything to do with the crushed bone there. Steve is the link that holds what should be a self-contradictory statement together, and this moment should’ve been something beautiful, something that Tony imagined would be met with an ear-to-ear smile and an exhilarated laugh–but everything that comes to mind now is his face, bloodied and cruel when he brought the shield down on Tony.
greatest achievement in such detail and passion time and time again that it was hard to believe that in reality, he had never moved a finger to assemble this technical marvel at all.
It was no secret among the people that Anthony Stark of Mar'vill had yet to take a lady wife, and so high and small lords from the farthest corners of the kingdom would leap at every opportunity to introduce their dear daughters to the Man of Iron, hoping one of them arouse his interest.
Tony kisses her on the forehead and stands up slowly. "Alright, deal. Three juice pops. I'll come up later, yeah?"
Tony gasps in feigned outrage. "Nick, I'm wounded, really." As Fury steps closer and Steve moves to shake his hand while the man's good eye burns a hole in his profile, Tony speaks up again.
He stuffs the flask back into his saddlebags and throws a look over his shoulder, casting a glance at Rogers who's sitting on a tree stump on the other side of their small camp. They've put it up a sensible distance from the herd at a row of pines that provides some shelter from the wind and allows their fire to keep burning.
With a racing heart and tremors skitting over his spine, he casts a glance to the right and sees–Steve on the mattress next to him. Tony jerks away so quickly he dives backwards off the bed. The sound of him crashing into the nightstand is what wakes the man in bed to the situation.
Steve didn't have to be told twice. He was hard again, for the fourth time – had barely ever gone soft, in all honesty. How could he, with Tony in his wake?
he reminds himself. The Tony of another universe in which he’s now stranded for an undetermined amount of time. (Steve isn’t ready to commit to the thought that that timespan might expand to ‘forever’ at some point.)
Days pass, then a week. They already have rationed their supplies, but agree to cut down on the portion size when it becomes apparent that none of it will last at this rate.
"I bet you these fucking morons don't even know it's there," he scoffs, and then, words pouring from his mouth at a velocity that gives Steve's ability to follow their meaning a run for its money, explains the exact approach in which the circuitry needs to be intercepted so as to not damage it – just, you know, in case he doesn't make it.
for it. Someone with Steve’s voice and face broke into their house and he spread his legs and got off on being violated.
It takes him a beat or two to come back to reality enough to realize what the slightly uncomfortable sensation in his pouch-area is. Steve is… squeezing. Squeezing it. Tony almost snaps at him to not
A year ago, he would've traded the wormhole for any other dreamscape in a heartbeat, ignorant to the reality that for one monster to replace another, it needs to be capable of much greater atrocities than its predecessor. (The Ten Rings, the Chitauri, Steve. Somehow Steve is always the superlative, be it as a soldier or a nightmare.)
Why Steve? Why does he hold that romanticized image of Tony's person when actual perfection is looking back at him from the mirror every day? That's a severe case of rose-colored glasses. If anything, he's the one out of the two of them that should be told all these things.
Lord Anthony paused as he received the sword from the woman to his left, balancing its length on both his open palms to present it to the knight in front of him. Its blade was forged of the same blue steel found in his guard's armor, only that in this weapon its lethality was unparalleled.
“What a surprise! Sir Rogers, is it not? I believe darling Lucia had things to say about you as well,” he smiled, teeth flashing like a vulture eyeing its prey. A warning – one which the knight wholeheartedly ignored.
She's gone down the hall and up a flight of stairs in a matter of seconds, and Steve wonders whether children of her size are supposed to be this fast on their feet. Is this normal? Seems like that'd turn the whole house into a potential safety hazard.
Tony arrives a lot slower and appears still semi-asleep when he does. His eyes scan the scene briefly, and when Steve flashes an apologetic half-smile and scratches the back of his neck a little guiltily, Tony only waves a dismissive gesture in passing and murmurs 'good morning' through a yawn.
Not for Tony, whose jaw clenches with the crushing force of grim determination that Steve knows can move mountains. Not for Tony, who has a bright, livid shine in his eyes that means he has something to prove to himself and the world.
Steve is also in Europe. On the other side of the Atlantic. Or was, past tense, as the lips on his neck and the scratch of a beard tickling his skin suggest.
Maybe, though, if he gives Steve just a little more, he’s going to get a proper handjob. And then, nothing will be standing between him and that orgasm anymore save for his own body–but he doesn’t think that’s going to be a problem tonight, what with how he could crawl out of his skin with pleasure.
He ends his speech with an 'I love you three thousand', and although the words and what they imply seem to be mainly directed at his daughter, Steve feels himself tear up at the sincerity in his voice and the softness of his smile.
Tony can't say he minds, although he does have half a mind to point out some flaws in Steve's last statement. Calling the middle-aged guy with crow's feet who's already in a more-salt-than-pepper situation
Of course, he doesn't get an answer, but the pleased rumble he receives when he snaps his hips forward just a fraction harder speaks for itself.
Tony keeps hiding and goes on a much-needed vacation to one of his numerous private islands. At least that's what his wonder-working PR team makes the public believe.
finally registers with his brain. It reminds him a bit of freshly mowed lawn, but there's a deep, earthy undertone that you'd associate with only one type of place: the woods.
"I loathe to remind you, beloved, but if I had not embraced this one particular opportunity so many years ago, we would not be sitting here."
As it so happens, every man who spends his time in the company of drunken travellers, vagabonds and supposed outlaws eventually gets caught up in a bar fight, no matter whether he'd like a part of it or not. And as luck would have it, Tony's confronted with the worst of them, because although he isn't small by any means (maybe on the lower end of average in height), he is no match for the seven feet tall giant named Tommy who comes barging at him for no apparent reason but the fun of it.
The point is, Steve has actually heard him out, and the bottle of lube lands next to Tony on the mattress once he's used it to spread some of it on his
Grim determination threw dark shadows across the ridges in his face and when he pulled his helm's visor down, their eyes locked, silent gazes speaking all the words they could not say.
"Hey," Steve mumbles into his hair, nose nudging the top of his head. "Eyes open, c'mon. Want you to look."
hands now rubbing up and down his sides and finally resting at his waist. His hands are big and his fingers splay out wide above Tony's stomach, the difference in their complexion strikingly pleasing to the eye. His hold tightens a fraction, and it makes for a sense of security that Tony subconsciously latches onto amidst the newness of the situation.
Tony’s mouth opens and closes around nothing, up until Steve takes his arm by the wrist and presses it onto the counter with a crushing force. He thinks he might be breaking something, and it tears him apart on the inside that saving Tony comes with all this added brutality, but there is no other choice when he jerks and flails like this to fight for an escape that won’t ever bear fruit.
Steve leans in, wraps his hand around the other man's jaw to press a kiss to his lips that is as much proof of life as it is a display of affection. It's quick and seemingly lackluster like any of their affections shown out in the streets, because indulging would be a distraction they can't fall prey to. What they lack in passion out here they make up for in the safety of their shelter; it's the one thing Steve spends every day looking forward to.
"Is this everything? Have you– asked for this before and I rejected you? Because I cannot recall for the life of me."
Steve can almost hear him say, the voice in his head teasing and making light of the situation like only Tony could.
This is the last he sees of Tony in a very, very long time. But even then, through these weeks and months and
In the same way he's been nonchalant about the rest of it, like they've done all this a hundred times before, Steve also doesn't glance at the wet spot Tony's cried into his shirt or acknowledge the mortification coloring his face a dusky red after the deed is done.
He can’t quite place how long it’s been, but he thinks it has to have been before the serum, and most of those memories are blurry now. One thing he does remember is the feeling of wet heat around his cock, and his own hand decidedly isn't the same.
He begins to pull at the bandages with a fervor and a shaking hand, fingers clawed and movements erratic. Like he needs to see it to believe. Like he needs proof of what his memory tells him Steve has done.
that? It's serving no purpose but to make Tony feel guilty about something he doesn't have any real control over. Christ, it's not like he got up this morning and made the conscious decision to be a mental car-crash of a person for the rest of the day.
Maybe. Probably. Then again, you know what they say about hindsight; Tony for one hasn't had full 20/20 vision in years. Life would be of too little difficulty and hardship if everyone always
The vehemence of his passion is making Tony's blood rush in his ears, the want to finally make their bodies join almost unbearable as it suddenly transforms from a purely physical need to the desire to be close and connected in every way possible.
"Well, no. I have not. But it is common knowledge that you Starks think highly of old values, and your father–"
Their attempt to reverse Thanos' doing began with more logistics than one might assume. They put together teams and assigned each one to gather the stone(s) from the particular place and time they’d calculated. Not that he didn’t think of protesting against the final decision, but he had to admit the division made sense this way.
He wonders if the Avengers could've been something like this, or if they were always doomed to drift apart.
The day passes, slow, but it does. Steve reads and busies himself with the StarkPhone Tony's handed him a few days ago, casual as he is with material goods. He does some more research on it, ranging from historic events over biology to pop-culture.
Romanoff plucks an unassuming piece of paper out of her pocket, feint-ruled and folded once. She slides it to him over the table. Steve nods, not having looked at it. "Consider it done."
Tony isn't sure if he'd go so far as to call it a kink, because it isn't primarily about the (fantastic, mind-blowing, magnificent) sex. It's that blend of physical and emotional intimacy that is really getting to his source code here. Perhaps that should be unsettling, how starved for this particular flavor of validation he apparently is, but he isn't in the mood to ruin the moment right now.
For the first time, Steve gets the chance to look at him. He's not ashamed to admit that he's drinking in the sight like a dying man. It's a feeling beyond compare, seeing the healthy color of Tony's skin and the spark of life in his eyes.
Just the one moment of inattentiveness is enough. Tony steps on an icy patch of ground and loses his footing. With a yelp, he finds himself on the floor yet again, the pain of impact uncharacteristically distant. Tony writhes helplessly in the snow as he tries to get back to standing – the crutch is somewhere he can’t
This is how he imagined it should be; primal, dirty, a continuous build toward a peak just out of reach. Salvation from this numbness that he's so used to taking his each and every sensation and wringing it out like a soaked rag until all the colors are gone. Sucked down the drain before he can get a glimpse.
It's sudden, but Tony sure isn't opposed to it. When is he ever? His dick is already beginning to harden, pressed against the kitchen counter, and he groans as he rocks into it and then into Steve's hand as it cups him through his boxers.
Being a hired sword under Rhodes' command, she felt out of place amongst silk gowns and silver cutlery and would've much rather spent the evening in the small hall to eat in her friends' company. Sellswords, poachers and knives were people she liked to surround herself with, but she knew not to let discomfort show.
The 12th Lord Stark in a line of builders, creators and pioneers turned to look at Peter when the young man approached, still unsure of the nature of this encounter. His agitation had to be palpable, because as Anthony waved him closer he smiled reassuringly.
Tony was the one to jolt him out of his musings, his hand coming to lay over Steve's at his hip and squeezing in a silent inquiry. And then, his tongue darted out to wet his lips and he voiced that quiet demand in a loud and needy manner.
He's never been in Tony's bedroom. Steve pushes the door open hesitantly – despite his good intent, it feels as if he's intruding – and keeps the light off so as to not disturb the brunet in his sleep. The beige curtains are pulled open haphazardly, moonlight shifting through the gaps and drenching the room in a pale, cold sheen.
The castle's residents could not do much but oblige by the demand, seeing as she had taken out every guard in the vicinity. Gods, she had not killed them – that would have surely been reason enough to get her hanged – but they were either passed out or injured to a minor degree.
Anthony saw him off with a grin bright as the early morning sun, although his arm must have still hurt as he waved him off.
Steve makes a sound as though he’s surprised by the news. He tightens his hold a little, stroking his thumb along the seam of the metal plate where it meets skin near the line of Stark’s jaw. “Shame, isn’t it, that you’ve made so much of the human experience obsolete for yourself and didn’t think to put the need for air on the list?” He tsks. “Must be feeling really stupid for not considering that, I’m sure.”
Which he'll admit is laughable, because he's never really stopped, has he? He never stopped loving this man, and so help him God, he probably never will. It's how he's wired. Maybe he does have too much love to give. If he's ever thought
The nature is entirely untouched out here; Tony has never seen anything like it. It is as if they've entered a different world, where humanity and civilization are words that have no meaning. Mother nature reigns over these lands, and him and Rogers are just tiny, unimportant specks tainting her creation. They ride past planes of snow glittering in the early morning sun, an ice-clad creek that falls off into a miniature waterfall of icicles, and cross a frozen lake where Rogers points out a couple of animal prints that he claims are snowshoe rabbits'.
If James found both their bedrolls empty one night and frantically searched for Anthony until he came across sounds deeper in the woods that indicated the Lord was most definitely not being abducted against his will, he did not say.
Fury, after squeezing his hand a degree tighter than ultimately necessary – like that would somehow test his identity for its authenticity – sounds a sigh clearly aimed at Tony, arms akimbo underneath his coat. "We received your instructions loud and clear, Anthony. Routine questionnaire, routine examination. No goods will be damaged. It's in everybody's best interest to evaluate what
He moans in answer, bucking into Steve’s fist and thereby fucking the other man's cock in and out of himself by a few precious inches. Steve doesn’t move or tighten his fingers around him which, okay, Tony figures is fair. He can work with that.
The man explained it would be impractical and also dangerous to leave them here – the rock slopes that surround the area are steep and prone to avalanches, which is why finding and returning the herd to the plateau as soon as possible is of such high importance. Tony,
Hi-dra may have shaped him into the perfect soldier, but they have no say in who he is today. Not anymore. They gave him the tools to surpass not only his previous self but them as well, and they're naïve to think he wouldn't notice it happening or care even if he did.
When he’s done changing, he looks around the room, a little lost. He’s wide awake now and his throat is parched, tongue sticking to the roof of his mouth as he swallows. Sleep isn’t going to be an option in the next few hours and he could do with a drink and a quick detour to the toilet.
The shrewd glint in James' gaze insinuated that he had hoped for a scenario like this. Few people could play Natalia Romanova for a fool and survive, but Rhodes seemed to have meant only to embarrass his friend, which she figured she could excuse. It had been amusing, after all.
Now that she had the chance, Carol was determined to prove herself amongst Stark's guard. She only hoped the Captain of Guard would not make this matter harder for her in an act of petty revenge – men were known to do such things in the name of what they considered to be love.
Incredibly, the effect is immediate. The other man gasps, eyes shooting open and body convulsing for a moment before he stills and tenses. His gaze darts around wildly until he locks onto Tony, some of the trepidation in his features yielding to undiluted relief as he takes note of both Tony's and his own physical integrity. After a few beats during which neither of them move or speak, Tony clears his throat, breaking the prolonged eye contact.
In the beginning, Tony tries to trick him into speeding up by meeting his thrusts with more force than necessary. He excels at this – working Steve to the point he’ll give up on any and all self-control he might have. It’s no different today. He has to bite his lip and dig his fingers into Tony’s thigh, which in the end only serves to edge the other man on more. Tony makes a
He chose his next words with care, wanting to distract from the matter with a dry tone, "Sometimes, yes. Not every time the opportunity presents itself."
He throws his arms up in anger, and Tony just about resists the instinctive urge to flinch back and cross his arms over his stomach as a safety precaution. God, this pregnancy thing is fucking with his image.
Tony realizes some things aren't the way they seem. Herding cattle is one of them, Steve Rogers is another.
Sobbing with both the overwhelming intensity and relief, Tony bucks into his fist and slams back into the spear of Steve’s dick as though his body can’t decide which sensation it wants to chase. Then, he’s arching his back and throwing his head onto Steve’s shoulder. He’s pretty sure that dying animal noise is his, too.
Tony scoots over to the side of the bed that's closest to the mirror, having to suppress a shudder when the movement shifts the plug inside him.
Nobody asks and Tony doesn't tell. There's no use in hiding but he isn't going to shout it from the rooftops either, and so the matter goes unaddressed, hanging heavily over the compound like a storm cloud ready to erupt at any given moment.
Thanos, the tyrant called himself, a giant of eight feet in height and almost half as wide at that. James had assumed his flaming sword to be nothing more but a silly rumor, but as they came to a stop upon a hill above the swamplands, he could make out the madman in the midst of the battle, slashing left and right with a blade engulfed in flames that was nearly as tall as himself.
"That's right. You're gorgeous," Steve repeats from somewhere above him. A hand suddenly appears by his cheek, and Tony's eyes fly open. "Yeah. You. You are
Out of all things, Etta James starts playing, which furthers Tony's belief that his A.I. has become majorly invested where his and Steve's relationship is concerned. As skeptical as his creation was of the concept at first, he's taken to Steve like a duck to water and they are, much to Tony's continued dismay, the biggest co-conspirators next to Rhodey and Pepper when it comes to his personal wellbeing.
Even if he wanted to drag this out, watch Steve scramble to deny the truth, he wouldn’t be able to concoct any elaborate schemes. Reduced to base instincts, everything that’s left is noise: his heartbeat in his throat, Steve’s too-loud movements in a too-silent room, his thoughts a thrashing mass of
Despite the fact that coffee must run in Tony’s veins at this point, the tolerance to caffeine he’s likely built up a few decades ago prevents it from changing anything about his stage of wakefulness. He lounges in the chair, carding his hands through his already mussed up hair and makes no attempt at moving; Steve takes it upon himself to clean up the table, seeing as it’s the least he can do.
The hand on his shoulder disappears, and then Steve's up on his feet, taking a staggering step back as he spreads his arms. "Jesus Christ, Tony!” The words are intercut by a disbelieving, sudden half-laugh. “What else is there? Why did you never
No, in fact, the brain behind this operation was maybe the one person Steve (and every other outsider) would have suspected the least: Stone's omega, Howard Stark's son, bonded to the alpha for business purposes but also, as it seemed, to milk him for all his Stark genius behind the curtains of a public bonding born out of necessity.
He thinks of Pepper and her wistful smile, telling her husband to rest and not worry even as tears fall down her face. Thinks of Rhodey, unable to look in his best friend's dead eyes as his last breath left him. Thinks of little Morgan, who will have nothing but stories and history books to remember her father as she grows up.
How's he going to make up for all that? Tony's head is reeling as he goes through everything they've planned for the near future. Maybe they can squeeze in a spontaneous trip to a private island of his. He'll even let Steve choose which one, and then he can take that opportunity to hopefully make Steve forget about this whole incident in whichever way the man may want him to.
"Look, honey, if you go to your room while I take care of this, I'll let you have two juice pops later. Will you go to your room if I promise you two juice pops?"
The fear of death is an overpowering one; Steve sees it in Tony's eyes that have possibly gone wet with both his unblinking stare and the understanding of his fate. His lip twitches with unasked questions and pleas aimed at no-one. His hands, deft, calloused and littered with scars testifying to many fights won and gone, are trembling, now that there’s come a battle he’s already lost before it’s even begun.
Cruel. Vicious. Evil. Something has to be wrong with him, wanting to spend the rest of his life with this man. Well, no shit, but–goddamn it. How much worse can it realistically get? Trying to compliment himself will be awkward, stupid and terrible for sure, but at least he’ll get off. No blue balls is a pretty good payoff, all things considered.
After Lord Hammer had, fortunately, lost interest in her existence, he began to joke and jest with the people around him. They all were of his own entourage, household knights and other members of his court – all but the quiet, brooding Lord Von Doom who was a whole other kind of unpleasant and seemed hurt in his pride after having been denied his request to attend Lord Stark's private festivities.
Then however, his eyes narrowed, observing the man in front of him with a calculating gaze until all of a sudden his complacent grin took its place on his face yet again.
Something reckless and defiant has set fire to his nerve-endings and for some otherworldly reason, it wants
The man under him shifts impatiently, body close to shaking in quiet exhilaration. Steve hears a pleased rumble – and discovers that it's coming from deep in his own chest, a subconscious response to the willing omega just waiting to be mounted right there before him.
Steve was going to jump, Christ, that suicidal motherfucker. He's been looking to make things right with Tony ever since Tony's breakdown after returning from space, and this, well. This would just be the greatest opportunity to prove himself, wouldn't it?
The Lord appeared speechless, his mouth opening and closing in response to the uncompromising demand the guard had expressed.
“Anthony tells me he would like for you to see him in the Old Chambers in the eastern tower today,” the steward informed him, voice impartial as ever as she relaid the unusual news.
"Tony, I left you in the bedroom and came back fifteen minutes ago. We didn't have sex." When Tony only stares, he sighs. "I'm happy your wet dreams are so photorealistic, but you sound a little out of it right now."
“Someone’s missed me,” Tony mumbles, hears the smile in his own voice. It's not just Steve, either: three weeks have the potential to feel like an eternity, he’s found. It really isn’t fair, having hours of recordings to supply his spank bank but knowing that nothing will come close to the real thing.
It carries a strange energy, something old and deep and laden with tranquility that's comforting. There's only the long, wooden bookshelves, the bed that's too narrow for his large frame and creaks when he sits, and the dust floating lazily through the air solely made visible by the light seeping in through the window above – and Steve.
The thing is, though: he hasn’t really been able to breathe since that one memorable occasion his own bomb blew up in his face. These last years with Steve made it easier, somehow, breathing with two thirds of a lung, but the weight that has settled over his bruised ribcage again is a familiar one. He hasn't forgotten. He can deal with it.
"Whatever you want, sweetheart," he answered, smile maybe a little too fond for the salacious things that had happened and would be happening. He looked pointedly at Clint, who snorted when Steve added, "I aim to please."
"It's fine, Tony," he insists, flashing a quick smile at the other man. "I need to get this out of the way, see what options I have. If there are some. I'll see you."
It's nothing like a heat. He's not running hot, he's not writhing in his sheets, sweating and soaking wet in more than one sense. He can be around people without stinking the whole room up. His scent changes, but only the alphas notice, and even Hill walks a little closer when she bumps into him in the hangar one afternoon.
Steve keeps his promises–that much he should know by now. They've been acquainted with each other for a while, after all.
He slipped all the way out, angling his hips back and watching with a depraved kind of wonder as his ruddy cockhead popped out (long time no see), and. And Tony's opening shrunk back to not its original size, but to a size that actually left a hole, and Steve could see it, could see inside, could see the mess of come and lube just flowing out like he'd turned on a faucet–
At the end of the day, when he crawls into bed and grows evermore distressed with the fading scent in the pillow, safety is only a small comfort. His body certainly doesn't care, but he'll take everything he can get.
Steve smiles against his lips and returns the kiss, the slide of their lips growing more heated by the second. When his hand moves to pump Tony's half-hard erection in time with his quickening thrusts, though, Tony bats his hand away.
The sight is affirmation enough. In any case, Stark looks too out of it to catch any smugness in his voice. There are faint trembles shaking him, dried tear tracks streaking his face and a faraway look in his eye. If it's resignation, spite or just the drugs is anyone's guess.
Natasha, who’s in charge of monitoring the omega’s every move, smirks at Steve in passing, a quick flash of teeth that goes as soon as it came. “This is going remarkably well,” she comments, in a tone that indicates she finds that fact to be suspicious rather than pleasing. Steve halts in his step and urges her to elaborate the thought, always trusting her instincts above all.
"I am, too," he adds, a little out of breath not because of physical exertion but because Steve's practically shoving the air out of him with increasingly powerful thrusts. "I am–ah–beautiful. Like you said. I am, I–look so good underneath you, Steve, baby, God, I wish I could–" his breath hitches, "–see where you're fucking me open, I bet it's even hotter from up there, isn't it?"
According to folklore, he had acquired these wounds during the battle in the Vale of York, where he'd fought and triumphed over the Titan who was said to wield a burning sword. She'd always assumed this to be tale over truth, but the marks on the man's skin told her she might be mistaken; mistakes made for a distant relative Natalia seldom had the misfortune of encountering.
When they part, Steve brushes his thumb over Tony's bottom lip and breathes 'I love you' into his mouth, and Tony says it back because while
He's so full and he's been ready to burst practically since the beginning, so when his cock drags against the rough cotton of the bedsheet with every push–well, it's over quickly.
Steve steps in front of the cowering omega to shield him from vision and then addresses the crowd of people still gathered there, “Nothing has changed. We’re still proceeding as planned. That said, he might be of use, so he’s off limits until further notice. Are we understood?”
It turned out her worries were entirely unfounded, as Sir Rhodes was, despite his position in the Iron Guard, not one to abuse it for evil. Many became prone to wrongdoings once they had tasted a sip from the goblet of power, but this one seemed just as earnest as the day he had been when he asked for young Carol's hand.
During the fourth month, he thinks he's going to die if nobody comes and fucks him into next week right then and there.
“I will give Mr. Stone your thanks,” Bain smiles, calculating gaze sweeping through the ranks and asserting dominance for a last time before she steps back, her expression pleased as she looks at the man at her feet. “Enjoy your stay, Anthony.”
Of course, it’s this moment that Stark decides to rise from his workbench and turn around. He frowns at the sight of Steve, lips agape, his expression half puzzled and half irritated. Steve clears his throat to not sound all too abashed when he says, “You smell.”
As gently as possible, he pries Tony's hand off the wound dressing. The resistance is minimal, not because Tony doesn't want to escape his hold with all he is, but because he doesn't have the strength to do so. Struggling seems to have drained him of what little energy he had; the fight leaves him, his body slumps and his eyes squeeze close as if he is surrendering to whatever he thinks Steve'll do next.
because while puny Banner had alluded to wanting to disappear many a time, Tony certainly never expected his angry alter-ego to jump aboard a quinjet one day and take a trip through space of all things.
After everything that happened, Tony also refuses to help, with a twist to his lips and the home he built from the ashes in mind.
"Sprained," Bruce stated, finally, the injured man's breath of relief audible from the other end of the cot.
"I think it is," his voice that sounds alien to him says to no-one in particular. "I think I did all I could."
Peter just barely kept from gaping at the woman in bewilderment. “But that’s where they keep the– Where the family tomb is…?”
They’ve never been deer, and this far down the road, Steve and Tony aren’t fazed by much anymore. There’s only a curse muttered through a heavy exhale that steels for what is next, an assessment of the situation with sharp gazes and quick eyes, and then they move in unison to face the incoming threat head-on when it becomes evident there are no other options left.
Clint, perched on Steve's other side and immediately obliging by Bruce's request, was a lot less subtle about his enjoyment of the situation and his position of what he'd dubbed "Almighty God of Lube And Other Things Slick And Slippery". (Following that proclamation, Thor especially had needed a minute to curb his immediate, hearty laughter.)
Let’s just say the reaction he gets isn’t quite the one he expected. Instead of rolling his eyes or sighing in long-suffering exasperation, Steve’s smile remains stapled onto the sinful curve of his lips. Almost like he’s got another card to play, and it’s one that’ll win him the game.
Steve sees his daughter, for the very first time. She looks every bit like her father and Tony looks at her in all the ways that say ‘I’d set the world on fire just to keep you warm’. Something he’s thought forgotten and withering within him stings hot and painful and tries clawing its way up his throat, but he doesn’t let it. This isn’t about him, and he needs to let it go; Tony’s happy, as a husband to Pepper and a father to Morgan, and that’s the way it should be.
Steve's eyebrows finally uncouple from another, but it's only to travel all the way up his forehead instead. His gaze flits over Tony’s features, almost like he’s searching for something to indicate that Tony is making a joke at his expense.
He notices Maria looking at him expectantly and swallows, blinking to shake himself out of the haze. When he meets her with an encouraging smile, it doesn't even shake.
Tony's feet are dangling just above the surface of the water; Steve watches and feels irrationally anxious about the likelihood of his socks getting wet.
For Steve, this came as a somewhat unexpected development, considering he'd usually avoid letting anyone in on his emotional state, which included his deepest desires. On the other hand, this was
Tony pushes himself to the side as well, supporting his weight on his elbow. He levels Steve with a look.
He gets a nod in return. Steve huffs a breath, lips twitching in amusement in light of the situation's poetic irony. Demoted from the very top of the train's food chain to… this. Squirming in front of a rowdy bunch of tail-ends. Ah, how the tables turn on this fine day.
After a minute, Maria has emptied her bowl and jumps back up, almost tripping over her own feet as she speeds off down the hallway. Steve's really getting curious about this boat thing now. He asks Tony, who's still intently focused on the coffee machine but swiftly turns toward him upon hearing his voice.
Like the calm before the storm, Stark's suddenly motionless, breath shallow, muscles and tendons straining and releasing like it takes his all not to tense up entirely. "I got'chu, let go," Steve assures him, just a hint of firmness in his voice. He nips at the skin behind Stark's ear. "There's a good fella, Stark. Tha's it."
Tony is just about to finish his meal (he’s only eaten half, but that’s about what was to be expected) when Steve decides now’s as good a time as any.
He needs to focus on the questions he can answer, starting tomorrow. If this Nick Fury is anything like the one Steve is familiar with, it’ll take some persuading to get the man on his side. Once he’s done that, he can start thinking about how to get the Tesseract and what to do should his one possible ticket home prove useless.
saying are of possibly greater value. Steve narrows his eyes despite the knowledge that he’s long ago acquired: you can’t read anything off of Natasha she doesn’t want you to. “It’s– heat, I think,” she adds, taking mercy on him.
Steve brushes a greasy strand of hair off his forehead, and his smile is weak and watery, barely holding on. “I love you,” he says, and although every line of his body that is hunched over Tony’s speaks of grief, his voice is firm and clear. There is no doubting that message, and Tony doesn’t think to, not even for a moment.
It was a tall man, with bright hair and a shortsword in a sheath swinging from his hip. The steel blue chestplate identified him as one of the castle’s knights that had previously stood guard at the hall’s entrance.
The new angle is his undoing: Steve catches on his prostate with every other thrust. Tony spreads his legs, can’t do much else now that Steve's caged him like this. No escape, nowhere to go–it’s a thought that makes him shudder with pleasure.
Yinsen’s voice is looping inside Tony's mind like a broken recording. A mantra, maybe. A decade has passed, and the words still remain etched into his memory fresh as they were the day he fled the cave, molded into something new, something better through the force of fire, blood and water.
Tony jolts upright with a gasp, desperately sucking air into his lungs after what feels like an eternity of going without. Like being held underwater for an extended period of time. (And wouldn't he know about that?)
Within seconds, they're on the bed, Steve gently guiding him onto his back. Tony's patience snaps as he watches Steve settle between his legs, still fully (unfairly) clothed. He's being deprived of his rights here, and that just won't do.
Under the man's feet, the distance separating them doesn’t seem like a constant; with every step, the space between them shrinks exponentially, and Steve goes from being a point of orientation there by the familiar sight of the compound to a person, real, close and warm.
Steve's hand travels over the man's hip, down his thigh and comes to rest on the round of his behind. He squeezes the supple flesh, gratified in the way it yields under his fingers. Oh, Stark will do just fine.
"Whatever you're thinking, Tony, stop. Please," he says, voice very quiet and strikingly level in a way that betrays that there's emotion there that he has locked away somewhere within.
Stark shudders, then tenses when Steve's fingers slip further down between his cheeks. Or tries to, since the muscle relaxant prevents him from doing much of anything but helplessly clench and unclench his little, furled hole.
Steve pulls himself out of it and scrambles to keep the open wound away from the mess. He gathers up the fabrics he set aside one by one to dress the exposed wound, hopefully staunching the constant flow of blood from the stump until he can get his hands on their medical supplies back home.
Tony sends out a silent 'thanks' to his past self, because damn if he hasn't earned the genius title and those five PhDs. Steve is still enjoying this just as much as he did the very first time around–he's fondling the end of the glass plug, shifting and then pressing against it with his thumb. Tony can't suppress a soft moan at the sensation.
Nebula knows her way around the tech; Tony adapts quickly. They salvage parts from the remains of metal and dust that the battle left scattered on the grounds of Titan, and patch up what little damage the Benatar has taken.
The first thing he noticed upon blinking his eyes open was, of course, Tony. Tony, who was now laying flat on his chest with his arms crossed on the pillow in front of him, only his hips still lifted up to meet Steve's where he was buried inside. Tony, who was smiling, a little delirious with the ebbing pleasure of his afterglow. He looked sweaty and thoroughly fucked and
Stark’s breath stutters for a moment, but he manages to respond. “That– is not the same thing, and you know it. I was completely out of it and people were asleep. This is, is like performing for an audience.”
Rogers doesn’t turn around and the steady clangs of the tool in his hands don’t pause, not even for a moment. “If you can show me your hand right now and it ain’t shakin’, I’ll be happy to,” he drawls.
It's only right and just for this to in turn haunt Steve in his sleep, on the rare occasion that he gets some.
So, even now that just about everything seems preferable over yet again meeting the man who's going to sit him down, tell him just the right amount of things and then direct him to his place in this new world – even now, Steve smiles at Tony, grateful for the news yet not, and soldiers on.
The reaction she received was not the one she had expected or hoped for, truth be told. After a moment of silence, Maria sat upright, withdrawing her hands from their place around Carol's waist. Brows drawn together, she said, "Love, I adore you, but this must be the most fatuous thing I have ever heard."
He has noticed. That's obvious. Why hasn't he said anything, though? Tony would've probably been hurt in his pride, but at least he'd have known, right? He could've done something about it. So Steve– Steve wouldn't have to get any ideas, like suddenly realizing how maybe Tony isn't actually all that attractive anymore, how all that prowess and pretended youth is gone and has left him with a jaded and tired old man whose quirks and shortcomings are no longer painted over by some pretty/handsome façade that would make him easy on the eyes if nothing else.
They’re approaching deep winter at a steady pace, and it reflects in the temperatures. The winds pick up, the weather turns fitful and harsh; clouds cover the skies more often than not, bringing with them more snow and the first storms. Rogers expands the shelter next to the hut to shield the horses and mules from the worst of it. He’s hammering away at a plank of wood when Tony cuts in again from where he’s standing by his side, watching.
Actually, Tony is sure he is deliberately causing a ruckus just so Tony will – with a grumble and a swear – get up without having to be told. He could certainly imagine
Seeing as there's no way to persuade this bull of a man otherwise once he's set his mind to something, Tony sees fit to take matters into his own hands. He'll be long gone once Rogers wakes up, and the man won't have another option but to stay here while Tony picks up the delivery – and hopefully convinces someone to get him a little something else next time around while he's at it.
He can’t even muster to feel regret or wistfulness, doesn’t want to go out with either emotion. Everything he wants is this, to be enveloped by the man that was by all accounts the love of his life–how very Tony of him to admit to that on his deathbed–enveloped by him in body, smell and voice.
claw its way up his windpipe and past his lips. This would just be the cherry on top, wouldn't it? Crying like a hysterical high-school girl at prom night because he doesn't look the way he imagined he would.
"Hurts, Steve," he says, an unspoken plea for a relief that Steve can't give him ringing within the words. He swallows roughly, fingers spasming around Steve's wrist and then falling away. His voice shakes, reduced to the barest wisp of air between teeth, "It hurts so much."
What? Steve isn't the only one with ulterior motives here. Today was supposed to be their night out, and Tony was very much looking forward to getting dinner, having a relaxed conversation with and simply enjoying the presence of his boyfriend all the while being constantly reminded of what will be waiting for him once they're home.
Steve forces the thought out of his head. He can very well keep pondering the ‘why’ of it all, but all that’s going to do at the end of the day is leave him with ideological questions there are no real answers to. Not in this case there aren't, anyway.
A surge of mortification rolls over him. If he looked debauched before, he doesn't want to know what his reflection is showing this time around. Maybe it's a good thing he can't see for shit right now. His voice sounds self-conscious even to his own ears when he says, "This is messy, huh?"
This isn't any different from those times he's gotten front-row tickets to the recurring shitshow that is Tony berating himself for reasons associated with emotional rather than aesthetic shortcomings (fear of commitment, inability to express emotions and insufferable neuroticism, to name a few, and no, those last two aren't mutually exclusive). Likewise, he'll be pulling a face of utter misery then as well, until such a time when he's figured out something to counteract Tony's mood with or it goes away on its own.
Rogers shook his head. “From the Irôc Isles, originally. I,” he paused, swaying a little on his feet. “I have not been there in a long time, so that may explain why I do not sound like my people anymore.”
She looks at him for a long second. Then, as she nods, their eye contact is severed abruptly, a ripple in spacetime.
When they get to the medical station, the omega, of course, isn't alone but has attracted unwanted company. The small group that has gathered around him seems to at least have the decency to go by the phrase "no touching, only looking", although Steve isn't inclined to test for how much longer that'll hold true. They've already snagged the piece of cloth from the man, the loss of his only protection forcing him to retreat further into the corner behind him, naked limbs tucked tight against his body.
Steve hums in agreement, signaling his understanding as he presses a last kiss just underneath Tony's jaw and then comes up again. Tony blinks at him, tilting his head a little to study the man above him. Steve is still going steady, rhythm an impeccable pattern that you'd probably be able to measure with a metronome.
Steve can’t even reprimand him for producing so much noise, because Tony looks over and sees him staring, which only adds fuel to the fire. “What’re you looking at?” he snarls, twitching lip hinting at the undoubtedly ugly things he hasn’t yet spoken out loud. Steve isn’t particularly keen to find out what else he might have to say, so he does the smart (cowardly) thing and goes back to reading.
Steve recalls the very beginning, when he'd had them reverse-engineer the NEMNP to modify its output and give it a power dial: Tony had taken seven attempts to make it to the desk even on the lowest setting. These days, they're up to four and he's walking. Steve sees how that may turn out to be a problem one day, predicts it even, but it's a problem he will address another day.
He's practically mouthing the words, but Steve has no problem understanding. There’s a blue tinge to his lips, drawing his gaze to them. They become another point of intrigue, plush and pretty as they are even drained from all their rosy color.
And still, Tony keeps stroking himself toward completion, the rough palm of his hand rubbing the skin raw. He wonders how Rogers' would feel in its stead, whether it'd be softer, or harsher, or more punishing in its grip than Tony's is. The man's hands are bigger than his own – Tony has stared at them for prolonged periods of time, and he has been able to make that out very clearly. They're bigger, maybe big enough his prick would almost disappear entirely in his fist.
After a moment, Steve nods and squares his jaw, already formulating a plan in his mind. "Okay, I'll… I'll do a round of the house and check the locks, and then we can go through everything that happened one thing at a time. We'll figure this out."
Would have, because that particular scenario never eventuates. What happens instead is of a much less desirable nature, and the ramifications are more severe than Tony comes to realizes in the first moment. Granted, the first moment also takes him by surprise, so he can’t be blamed.
After all, they were getting front-row seats to a lewd and live performance of something no one on the outside would ever be privy to.
Steve declares the event over. He waits for everyone to retreat to their designated sleeping spaces before he lets Buck and Nat pull the man to his feet, who barely manages to keep himself upright as he walks. Steve makes a point of leaving him to struggle on his own; he isn't about to allow anyone take the man apart until there's nothing left, but he's got little sympathy for an outcast first-class beyond that.
They make love again later, under the full moon that hangs low and bright over the hills in the distance. Just for a moment, Tony gets distracted by the strange glitter of moonlight against the grass–it’s bright and concentrated as though reflected off a surface–but the thought gets chased away by another kiss.
Every inch too much too soon had the potential to hurt, even tear, no matter the amounts of lube and prep applied.
When he nods slowly, Tony continues, “So, we had Maria. We had all of that, for five years. And, well, you know what happened after.” Tony swallows audibly; his eyes have turned glassy, and they’re swimming with tears when he turns toward the blue light of the holograms.
"What's the plan, Cap? You really thinking about going through with this?" he asks, his strangely raspy voice breaking the unnerving silence.
The choice of entertainment surprised him when Steve took his pick. They watched an episode or two a few months after the Avengers had moved into the tower, and he recalls Steve not being into it then. Tastes change, Tony supposes. (Not always for the better, but it is what it is.)
"There is a lot more silence, riding and pains in places I wasn't previously aware of involved than I expected, but all in all, I can't complain. Well, I
Stark locks onto the device and has the audacity to bark a laugh. “What, an EMP? Do I look like a kindergartener to–”
The gist of it is, he's tired, irritated and properly jetlagged when he returns to the compound. It's evening in New York and the five hours he's slept on the plane have left him only more exhausted, which is fine by him because he absolutely plans on crashing in bed in a few minutes.
The damage is done. Steve backs off, all the way to the outer edge of the other side of the bed, where he'll stay for every night to come. He promised he’d do whatever Tony needed him to, and considering Tony doesn’t trust him to be anywhere near, bringing distance between them is the least he can do.
Once they're outside at the usual spot, Steve instructs Tony to hold onto him while he takes care of his pants. It isn't so much the nakedness which is the issue, Steve's aware of that; there's nothing he hasn't seen before. The real humiliation, he thinks as they kneel there and he holds Tony so he won't tip over, stems from being reduced to something like this, from the vulnerability and powerlessness that comes with having to accept assistance for this so very basic task.
They hadn't noticed him that day, and he never made a mention of it afterwards. So it came that only much later, when Anthony asked they go out on a ride together, the boy stated no reason but the unspoken yet obvious dejection eating on him.
And so Steve stays away, allows the abyss between them grow wider. It doesn't feel right, but neither does anything else, and he's out of options.
For breakfast, they sit outside on the terracotta-tiled terrace under a canopy grown over with wine. He'll enjoy his first sunbath under the gentle, early rays of the sun as it rises in the east, and listens to the waves crash against the shore down below.
He leans forward and kisses Tony's forehead, chapped lips rough against his skin. "I have an appointment a week ago," he smiles, a wet gleam in his eyes as he leans away.
Tony pulls a grimace. "Is there? Because I'm sorry, but I don't… This is not me trying to rile you up, by the way. I fail to see your point."
If he sees Rogers looking at him with brows furrowed in disapproval out of his peripheral vision, Tony doesn't mention it. There’s just no pleasing that man; maybe it was a close call, but nothing happened in the end. How is it that even when Tony’s being useful for once, he finds something to nag about?
The unfairly muscled reason for his lapse of judgement is sitting on the tall strawberry roan trotting along the snow-covered trail in front of him like he was born there, shooting knowing glances back at Tony every once in a while as if he's intensely aware of Tony's deep-seated regrets.
The wound itself, while leaking discharge and not anywhere near healed, does seem to be improving slowly. Steve won't praise the day before evening comes around (their last outing has taught him not to dare ever again) but he watches every step Tony takes toward betterment with his breath caught in his lungs and hope a gentle nudge in the back of his brain reminding him to breathe again.
Molten metal burns through his skin, meat and bone, shoots up his arm and into his heart. His chest contracts on impact, an almost unbearable pain that hits so suddenly it makes him gasp out loud.
Steve, insufferable, wonderful, beautiful Steve, looks at him with sorrow and guilt and many other unspeakable things, his eyes wide at the sight of Tony. They're haunted with nightmares of ash and dust, just as Tony knows his own are. Then, Steve gasps in shock as Tony tips over and into his arms, finally,
and that sensation is something that doesn't go unnoticed by his baser instincts. Even before he's gotten a proper look at the omega, he feels himself take interest, blood rushing south and cock hardening in his pants quicker than he might be comfortable admitting.
He doesn't get to leave until some time later, when the man at the door receives instructions through the comms device in his ear – Steve can make out the voice on the other end perfectly well, and they're telling the agent now in charge of him to 'escort him to the office'.
Tony lies there so very still and quiet he could’ve been gone with the wind had they not all already been by his side.
Steve's stoic expression turns into a frown. It's almost--confused? No, can't be. Tony pushes further because he's never known when to stop, and desperation doesn't help. "It won't work, you
Anthony rushed to answer and steer Peter's attention back to him, "Of course she does. What things are you accusing me of, Mr. Parker?"
Break into a run off the roof, brace for impact–it comes naturally to him now. The old courthouse is one of the few buildings downtown that aren’t touching the belly of the ever smog-covered sky. Instead, it sits there as a bulky relic from the early last century in the middle of a modern metropolis, sticking out like a sore thumb. (How considerate of Stark to pick his favorite place as their rendezvous point.)
Tony tastes bile in his mouth. The animal is on its side, stomach ripped open and guts spilling onto the ground beneath, snow dyed a crimson red. If Rogers' assumptions are to be believed, the body isn't all that old, but it still smells like– well. Like dead meat. It's not a pleasant smell.
Alarm overtakes his face as he registers that Tony is scrambling for leverage on the floor, and he throws the covers aside and comes running. The concern in his face is contrived, it has to be. Or maybe not: maybe he's concerned Tony will escape.
It's a different pain altogether, realizing this something he's ached for so fiercely but never thought he'd get is tainted by betrayal now.
The Lord himself had made his way down from the tribune in the meantime, bright fur cloak swinging behind him as he approached the men on the podium. Next to him walked a tall, blonde woman who was clad in leathers and ringmail and carried an impressive sword in her gloved hand.
If there's one quality about him that's not a scam, it's that Tony Stark always has an ace up his–not always the
"Seeing as you are visibly upsetting my patient, I would deem it wise for you to remove yourself from this environment for the time being, Sir Rogers," Bruce commented, voice dangerously even.
Weeks pass. Tony tells himself he’ll come out with it, but one day the bruises have faded and he shrugs it off.
Old Lord Stark had brought the stone for the foundations all the way from the riverbanks in the west, almost a day’s ride from where the castle now stood gray and tall. For decades upon decades, only the strongest Black Forest horses had drawn carriages laden with boulders from the river of Hudson, until the old Lord’s great-great-great-great-grandson Howard came to power and had seen a stone quarry dug in a vale between the mountains.
he’d said under his last breath, apologizing as if Tony wasn’t the one who’d sworn and failed to protect his life in the first place.
Of course, it's him. There is no one in these mountains other than Rogers who would've set out to search for him in the deepest of storms, picked up his weakened body from the snow and carried him back into the warmth of this hut that is theirs for only this one season. Rogers, who is now nestled against him, stripped to his underwear to preserve body heat in a mockery of Tony's hidden, most intimate fantasies.
After months of being pestered to take better care of his own well-being – not only courtesy of Sir James but Ms. Potts, newest member of the castle and without question the most qualified steward and wittiest personality Mar’vill had ever seen – Anthony yielded to their requests.
In the end, he decides omelets with bacon and vegetables should be doable. As Steve gathers everything he needs on the counter, he stumbles upon another question: would it be rude to cook just enough for himself? Or would it be rud
Steve slicks up his dick with one hand and uses the other to grab a fistful of Stark's hair, unceremoniously pressing his face into the mattress and deferring any further comments. Dirty talk would be fine if everyone in the bunks around them wasn't able to hear what is only meant for Steve's ears – at least Steve tells himself it's about holding up (relative) peace and quiet instead of keeping Stark's words and sounds just for himself.
He smells it before he hears the commotion all the way in the back: distress, acrid and sharp. There’s a hint of something else underneath it, a sweet and alluring undertone that is overpowered by the fear it shares the scent with.
worth this with every stroke, that there's something so intrinsically desirable about who Tony is it won't matter either way what the decades bring because he just wants
some time and some screaming fits, but me and Steve made up. After I, like you already mentioned, returned from the deathtrap that is the boundless void of space,” Tony explains carefully. He places his chin in his hand and eyes Steve as if he’s trying to gauge his reaction.
Steve nods, almost on command. On the other side of the table, Carol has started removing bits of armor with brute strength and others with the laser tool implemented in her suit. She works methodically, but there's a grim twist to her lips and a tick to her jaw that betrays the fact she's no more unaffected by this than any of them.
It took all Steven's might to suppress a gasp and the twitch of his fingers that wanted so desperately to hold onto the man’s waist and ensure he would stay seated right where he was.
Steve's too good to him, sometimes. Sometimes he's also irritating, and stubborn, and stoic and all those other things that annoy the living daylights out of Tony, but today – well, it's one of their more harmonic ones. Even now, Steve is smiling faintly, the crook of his lips a little sad perhaps, but underneath, it's patient and reassuring and everything else he knows Tony needs without having to be told.
The saloon itself is just that, too. Dead and rotten, like the rest of the town. The floorboards are being ravished by wood rot and creak in anguish every time their old bones are tested for their durability. One of the windows has been boarded up but never fixed after a couple of morons took their disagreement outside by launching themselves through the window and onto the street in a tangle of limbs. There's a draft in the open space of the room now, and even the fireplace in the corner can't keep the cold out.
Tony humors him, although he does it with about the same amount of enthusiasm you'd manage to muster up for a colonoscopy.
"Shh," Steve intones softly, and the words spilling so copiously from Stark's mouth suddenly cease, stop and die at the slightest hint of a command that isn't one. "'s okay, Stark. I'm staying. C'mon, scoot."
Knowing the theory is easy, putting it into practice is where things get tricky. A few sips a day are next to nothing for a raging alcoholic, and Tony has long stopped deluding himself about the reality of that fact about his person. That’s what he is. A no-good drunk. He might also be the first and only alcoholic to ever accidentally rehabilitate. Hilarious.
Stark sighs, sound muffled by the makeshift mask, but doesn’t protest. They’ve had this debate every day in the recent past and it’s always been Steve who’s gotten his way in the end, if only because Stark’s still not exactly in a position to argue.
Thing is, Steve must've noticed. This, all of it. He's attentive like no one else Tony's ever known and he loves with the same single-mindedness he does everything else. His every sense is attuned to Tony and even more so during a tumble in the sheets – there's no way he wouldn't have noticed. The folds, the pouch, the bumps. The many unflattering angles at which aforementioned failings of his appearance happen to look even worse.
That makes him an egoist, possibly. Or an asshole. Or a coward. Or all of those combined; little bit of everything, maybe?
If he could, Tony'd laugh, but his mouth is dry, throat itching with the sudden absence of saliva. One look at Steve confirms that he feels similarly, incredulous at the scene unfolding in front of them and the frankly unbelievable things it implies.
With a frantic kind of energy that borders on the edge of desperation, Steve’s hand comes up and cups his cheek, stroking the all-too prominent bone there with gentle brushes that have nothing in common with the undiluted panic his bobbing throat and widening eyes communicate. He’s trying, for Tony, to hold back. Appear calm, provide comfort. Too bad Tony can read him like an open book.
This is them. Right now, Tony can't think of a single way he could complement the picture any better than he already does.
He doesn't respond to the comment. Instead, he holds Romanoff's gaze as he closes his hand around Tony's dick, which he's pleased to find is beginning to show interest in the proceedings. Steve doesn't think she sees, not with the desk in the way, but she's noticed his hand go there and hears the slow drag as he rubs the almost dry skin.
Tony flashes a quick smile in return, sharp as a blade. "Be careful with that. Odds are you won't feel that grateful once you experience this mess first-hand," he answers, his tone oddly light with self-deprecating humor.
Holding Tony a fraction tighter, he sighs. “I know I was wrong to do it like this,” Steve tells the sleeping man. “But losing you– Just the idea of it, it puts the fear of God in me.” He huffs a self-deprecating laugh. “I would’ve never forgiven myself if you hadn’t made it because I spent too much time arguing with you instead of, of acting. You know I’d never cause you harm if it wasn’t the last and only option. Hell, I’d rather the whole world burns before you do. You know that, don't you? You
