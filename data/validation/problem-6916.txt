“Where did he…?” Tony mutters to himself as he brushes Thomas’ query aside. There’s no sign of his mystery man on the avenue; he scans the passers-by for those broad shoulders, that lovely head of golden hair, but everyone around him at the moment is dull, useless.
“Yeah, well, maybe not,” Tony admits.  Steve hadn’t looked bad – he’d looked different.   “But I’ve just started getting used to you and that’s harder to do if you go changing on me.”
“Here.” Steve repeats, rocking his hips to meet Tony’s. Tony wonders if Steve’s going to fuck him right in the kitchen, and his mind is already racing ahead to Bucky walking in and seeing his best friend’s bare ass flexing as he pistons in and out of Tony’s willing and eager body, spreading him open on their laminate countertop.
“What do you mean, why are you doing this. This was your idea.” Pepper keeps pace with him as he stalks down the long hallway, pencil scratching shorthand furiously over her steno pad as she jots down notes for the day.
And when he falls asleep, sated and sweaty and sticky and completely undone, he actually feels whole.
The drawback to having the studio in a basement sublevel is the lack of windows.  No natural light, no view for him to study.  It doesn’t surprise him that this didn’t occur to Tony, but with JARVIS’ help he’s able to approximate natural light using certain types of bulbs and he learns how to pull up various scenes and video feeds using holographic technology.  Even when he’s not referencing it, he keeps one wall occupied with scenery just for the illusion itself.
“I tend to get bossy, and I tend to overcompensate when I’m nervous.” Tony explains matter-of-factly, then winces. “I may also overshare.”
“Something like that.” Pepper tilts her glass at him again, and he obliges her by matching her, taking a sip of his own drink.  “So…why don’t you stop having distracted, half-assed conversations with empty-headed models and go save Tony from his distracted, half-assed conversation with that empty-headed actress.”
“Everything I touch I make better,” Tony promises.  “Well.  Almost everything.  Some things are perfect already.”  He snakes a hand up Steve’s arm, brushes fingers against his neck.
Steve laughs a little too, then wraps an arm around his waist and pulls Tony back, using his other hand to tilt Tony’s face back for a kiss.
.” Clint rifles through the DVDs, then his mouth falls open in overdramatic shock.  Kernels of popcorn tumble out onto the carpet.  “Stark, why do you not own
“Enjoy yourselves!” Thor offers them each a fist bump as they shuffle down between the crowded tables to get to the exit.
Steve never told Natasha why he’d left the tower, but from the looks of things she either suspects or she must have found out.  Bucky very well may have told her; sometimes the two of them stay up late, talking quietly in Russian and taking apart and cleaning and reassembling her guns.  Bucky says it’s calming.  Steve doesn’t sleep much either, but he leaves them to their ways of coping and they leave him to his.
“Wouldn’t dream of it. See ya, Sam.” He gives Sam his best grin and a two-finger salute before pivoting on his heel and making for the door.
Steve shifts, looking behind him to find Tony on the other bed, sitting up against the headboard with his tablet propped up on his knees.  The screen casts a white glow onto his face.  His tie is loose around his neck, the top three buttons of his maroon button down undone.
“Talk about what?” Steve replies. His long, delicate fingers trace a line, up and down, over Tony’s forearm where it’s wrapped across his bony chest.
“Yes, right now.”  He thumbs over his shoulder toward the door, already taking steps toward the exit.  Steve glances toward Bucky.
“You pay me to do my job, Mr. Stark. And if that necessitates a little massaging of the truth now and again to get you where you need to be,
Tony waves him off, then stretches his arm enough to shake down his sleeve, let him get a look at his watch face for the time.
“Since we’re not shooting tomorrow...I think you should come over tonight. To the house in Malibu. It’s finally repaired, and I think me and my leading man need to have a real conversation about his future with my company.”
He wants to shoot something.  He wants to blow something up in a way he hasn’t since before Afghanistan.  Even the Jericho would not suffice at this moment.
Someone bumps into him and suddenly his vision is going fuzzy.  He nearly keels over and when he lifts his head, Steve is bent down in front of him and doubling and tripling before his very eyes.  He tries to focus on at least one of them to tell Steve that he just needs a minute to get a grip on himself, but he can’t find the breath to speak.
“I killed him, Tony.”  Steve opens his eyes and lets Tony see how much he means it.  How much of it is the truth.
"The night is young.  Text Sam and tell him to keep his granny panties on.  I have just the place to take you.” Tony points east, the opposite direction.   “Are you hungry?  Who am I kidding, of course you are."
“Pepper mentioned something about you having quite the interest. Let me guess – you have all the collectibles – the comics, the trading cards, the whole nine yards.”
"She's been interested ever since she assisted on the Winter Soldier mission.  I understand why you weren't all over that then, given the, uh, circumstances…” Tony hitches over the words, actually looking a bit uncomfortable himself.  He always gets a pinched look when Bucky comes up in conversation.  He recovers quickly and continues.  “But come on.  It's been over six months, maybe you should give her a call."
“Both,” Steve gasps out as Tony takes him in further, lips closing tightly around him, his first few inches lying flat on Tony’s tongue. His mouth is so hot and wet, and Steve can’t believe that he gets to have this and have Bucky too. Just this morning it had been Bucky between his legs and now it’s Tony.
He thoroughly enjoys the look on Tony’s face when he gets dealed in on a game and proceeds to double his stack in short order.  He cashes them in, hands Tony his seed money and pockets the rest, mainly just to get Tony’s goat.
“Yes, you are Chase, right?” Steve will feel terrible if he got that wrong. He really thought he’d committed all the crew members' names to memory.
He stares, looking his fill, and Steve stares back. Bucky doesn’t need to explain the reason for the pause; Steve understands. It’s hard to believe that they’re finally here. He almost
“I’m pretty sure that all of the… ‘heaviness’…is on your part here, Tony. So I think it’s probably all up to you how this meeting goes.” Pepper is already flipping through her Rolodex, muttering to herself. “Carpenter, Carson…Carter, here we go.”
“Thank god,” Bucky grunts. Annoyed, Steve tosses his discarded clothes at Bucky’s head, who swats them down to his lap with a disgusted grunt.
They’re getting a few odd looks now from the people immediately surrounding them – because no matter what the clichés are, some people in New York
Steve had excused himself and gone to bed shortly after Tony bundled him inside, wrapping him up in the throw from the couch to stave off the chill.
Steve thinks it will be fun.  His ma used to mention something vaguely like trick or treating from back home in Ireland, but it wasn’t really a neighborhood tradition when he was a child in Brooklyn.  He suspects it’s not all that popular here in Manhattan now, with towering apartment buildings full of complete strangers and tightly closed doors, but an Avengers Halloween event will probably draw a crowd.
But staring at the set of Steve’s sharp jaw and the outline of that slightly crooked nose, Tony knows that it’d be so easy to do it, to adore this man with every inch of his being.
Steve shudders in the aftershocks, overwhelmed. It feels like every inch of his body is quivering like a live wire. He’s unsure how long it takes for him to settle, to come back down.
Tony almost asks what Steve means by clean up when he realizes Steve’s talking about the Chitauri mess.  He’d sent a whole army of workmen and machinery from SI to assist, but of course Steve’s probably been down there digging through rubble on his hands and knees.
follow through.”  Tony slides his phone back into his pocket and throws a glance back toward Steve.  “Well, this has been fun.  See you later, Cap.”
“Want you more than I’ve ever wanted anyone.”  That’s not a lie, and honestly too much the truth, but he’s having a hard time reining that back in now that he’s started.  Maybe it’s because every time he lets a comment like that loose, Steve rewards his vulnerability.  He’s always been easily swayed by positive reinforcement.
“Don’t you ever worry about the company,” Pepper kindly interjects, shaking her head.  “Tony’s bounced back from
“You scraped up her whole underside.” Tony bends to run a hand over the damage. He can feel the deep scratches and dents rough and ragged beneath his fingertips. “Look at this mess.” Rhodey clucks his tongue at him.
He doesn’t return to the table after visiting the cloakroom, handing in his jacket along with sincere apologies to the tired-looking attendant.
“Sorry,” Steve mumbles for his impoliteness, feeling his face heat.  “I’m…I’m just going to go return this.”  He holds up the jacket and then makes a graceless exit.
“Tony?”  His voice is even worse now, hoarse from disuse and wrecked from his crying.  Bucky turns toward the doorway as well, taking the sight of Tony in.  He looks wretched, unshaven and unkempt.   Downright wan and gaunt.  Steve wonders if he’s been drinking.
“Drew for the comics, mainly.”  Steve’s already blushing; Tony’s reaction is apparently a foregone conclusion.  If only to remain unpredictable, Tony bites back the quip that’s on the tip of his tongue and merely nods, turning the thought over in his mind a few times before speaking.  Steve seems surprised by the momentary silence.
He and Tony have been behaving much the same, except both of them know their outings are more than outings now.  Occasionally they kiss, occasionally they do more than kiss, and occasionally they fall asleep in one another’s bedrooms, but neither of them has ever forced a conversation about defining what it is that they’re doing.
Natasha twirls the knife idly in her hand, the serrated edge evidently not a concern in her talented fingers.
“I’ll get you both some water.” Steve makes sure they’re sitting upright and steady before going to the kitchen to track down bottles for them.   He rummages through the fridge to find a couple unopened Smart waters.  When he turns back around, he’s face to face with Tony.
Tony doesn’t know what Barnes wants him to do here.  He’s not about to explain his reasoning to the man.  So he shrugs, takes the sketchbook Steve shoved at him and sets it aside.  There’s not much to say, so he just gives the version of the truth that seems the most obvious.
“Well, for this picture she’s going to handle the make-up for during and after the fight scene, but mostly…I hired her to piss off her father, if I’m being honest.” Tony chuckles.
“Sit, sit down.  Just stay still for a minute.”  He closes his eyes and makes a shushing noise.  “This is good.”
He had killed Tony’s parents, and for Steve's sake, Tony attempts to offer a forgiveness he cannot actually deliver.
“How far back you want to go?” Steve asks, half-joking, half-not.  He’s tired of riding on this roller coaster with Tony.  His constitution may be stronger than it used to be, but he still doesn’t like the sensation of falling and the whiplash is starting to hurt.
Lying on the bed is one of his faceplates, from one of the suits he was no longer supposed to be making.  Pepper must have known all along, which really isn’t all that surprising.  Tony lifts it and finds a piece of Stark Industries stationery underneath it.  Pepper’s left him with the delicate scrawl of far too few words.
“Oh, interesting is too boring a word for Tony.” Jan laughs, pulling out her cigarette case. Bucky gives her a light, and then follows suit with a cigarette of his own. Steve cranks open the window over the sink to let in some more fresh air. Between the simmering spices and the billowing cigarette smoke, he can feel his chest tightening up.
“You’re alive and that’s impossible.”  Fury points out and Steve starts to rebut but Natasha cuts him off.
Despite the fact their camaraderie is probably founded on direct orders, Tony’s stomach still twists with jealousy whenever he sees the group of four together, thick as thieves.  It’s like being a fifteen year old kid at MIT again, watching the cool kids together floating easily through life while he spent his time alone in the robotics lab.  Back then he used his money and bravado to hook the friends he was in actuality too insecure to attract on his own, but that’s not really an option now.  These aren’t people distracted by flash and false arrogance.
“Did you and Sue at least have a good time?” Pepper asks as she busies herself with picking up Tony’s crumpled tuxedo from the floor.
“I do.”  Steve feels oddly like he’s reassuring Tony of pure intentions toward Natasha, like Tony thinks Natasha’s misjudged this time and is expecting Steve to prove him right in his doubts.  Steve considers which path he should take with this and opts to take the one that leads back to Tony.  “She was wrong about you, though.”
He looks around the room, a little panicked, searching out the clock yet again. He’d been lost in the fantasy for mere minutes, but it feels like he’d lost hours to it.
For the first time in a long, long time, he has his health, he has an easy conscience, and he has love.  He and Pepper could go anywhere, do anything,
“What exactly do you have in your pocket, Steve?” Darcy is asking him now, the conversation evidently rounding back on him. He’s confused by the question.
Reaching out with his metal hand, he presses two fingers to the pages and draws the entire package closer.
He thinks he should be put off by her brash attitude. Instead, even as Jane and Darcy continue to talk about him as if he’s not sitting right there, he finds himself somehow charmed.
like anything, Stevie. You’re the one who ‘stank of booze and cigarettes’ and showed up here with hickeys all over on your neck and bruises on your hips.” Bucky gestures up and down Steve’s body with a pointed finger and Steve colors, glancing down at his waist and throwing a hand up to cover the side of his neck. For a moment, he thinks he’s been caught out, that Bucky
“That's not...” Tony starts, pausing long enough to make Steve think that maybe that actually was the reason.
, Stark, and let’s just get Bruce back safe and sound before he hurts someone.  You can gloat later.” Steve snaps.  Everyone looks at him, surprised at his sharp tone.  He ignores their stares.
“Ah, it is quite dangerous to underestimate your opponent, doctor.  ‘Tis a folly that has felled many a fine warrior.”  Thor chimes in, stroking his beard as he eyes the chessboard.  He leans over to study the finely carved pieces.   “I must admit I do find myself perplexed with this elaborate game.  The rules seem most arbitrary.”
“Steve,” Tony starts plaintively.  Steve ignores him.  He has his hand on the window frame, bending to go inside, when Tony’s fingers wrap around his wrist.  He turns to face Tony and as he stands upright, Tony’s suddenly pushing him back.  He collides with the wall but his grunt is stifled by Tony’s mouth covering his.
“You need to start training with us on a regular basis if you’re going to be on the team.  Walk-ons are not okay.”
, don’t you think? Rather than basically pinning a note to Steve like an abandoned baby on a doorstep saying
“You’ve never been all that discerning before,” Steve retorts, not so much critical as maybe a little annoyed.  Tony gives him half a shrug and opens the bottle, pours himself two fingers.  He hesitates, then pours a glass for Steve too and slides it over.
“Not the one you should be complimenting,” Tony stage whispers; Steve elbows him.  Phil stiffens a bit, his jaw tightening.  He looks like a stern schoolteacher silently praying for the patience to deal with an unruly child.  Steve’s sure that addressing Pepper’s appearance was already Phil’s next planned move; he hardly needed Tony’s prompting to be polite.
“I do like the new ending but honestly, to see myself on screen, this is a nightmare. I cannot imagine you enjoy watching, if you do not like this.” She gestures around to the hustle and bustle of the premiere crowd pouring in around them, some pausing to take in what is supposedly the world’s largest theatre mural, its pseudo-hieroglyphics depicting the “glory of Egypt” in basic primary colors.
“Barnes has been regaining his original memories.  He’s scared, and confused, and he is doing what he believes is right,” Natasha retorts harshly, glaring at Tony.
Tony holds up both hands and Steve stops ping ponging his attention back and forth between the two debating men, gladly focusing on Tony once more.
if I…” Tony leans in, brushes a kiss against Steve’s lips.  It’s tentative, careful to give Steve time to back away.  Steve quickly lets him know that’s not needed, tilting his head and pushing the kiss deeper.
“But you can explain the crazy hair and the need for a good ironing?” Tony gestures around Steve’s person. He pushes up from the floor, seemingly re-energized by their activities. “I like you like this, laying there with my come all over you. Give me a minute and I might be able to go again.”
“I invited the man over, I made him eggs!  Me!  In a kitchen! Is that not the perfect picture of someone getting over it?”  He swings his legs around till his feet hit the ground and Pepper slides easily into the empty space now made beside him.
“Tony?”  He must really break Steve’s concentration because his shield drops, allowing a blast to catch him right in the stomach.  Tony winces, waiting until he sees Steve shake it off before saying anything more.
“Don’t worry, I’ll kiss you then too.”  Tony nuzzles in close, circling his arms underneath Steve’s jacket and around Steve’s waist.  “God, I’m lucky you’re so warm.  It’s fucking freezing out here.”
“It must be thrilling to be part of a team of real live superheroes.”  The man – Collin?  Callum? Steve feels awful for not knowing, they’ve been ‘conversing’ for at least ten minutes now – asks, leaning in much closer to speak.  His lips nearly brush Steve’s ear.  He must think Steve’s hard of hearing, the number of times he’s been asked to repeat what he’s said.
you that he put his sticky, grubby hands on the lamps after I’d told him not to. I can’t be blamed when your smart aleck mini-Stark doesn’t do what he’s told.”
“He was acting in your own best interest.  He said something about that being within his parameters.”  Steve doesn’t look in the least bit ashamed of breaking Tony’s protocols and using his AI to do it.
“See you tonight, Rogers," she calls after him, a clear implication that she can't be dodged forever.
“That you did, that you did.” Nick acknowledges, and sets about making another. He nods his head at someone across the restaurant, and it’s only a moment before a broad, familiar hand claps on Steve’s shoulder.
Something in this infatuation with Steve Rogers has just shifted, and it seems wrong that all that could have happened in between three or four pushes of that tiny black minute hand.
Why now? Why me? Why do this at all? Tony doesn’t know what Bucky has to gain from bringing him in, why he didn’t tell Steve in advance that he’d be doing so, or what he thinks is going to happen now. Steve’s everything to Bucky, and why would he risk everything on this?
, it’d be hard to be one still." His voice changes slightly, turning deep and warm like a really nice, smooth bourbon going down. His smile is slightly crooked and it's nothing if not endearing. "I’m actually behind the scenes now. Set design.”
But he knows when he sees the Captain tomorrow, broad shoulders squared, poised and ready to face another day, whatever Tony’s reasons are for falling apart are just going to seem like excuses.
“I’m sorry.  When I said that, I suppose I just wasn’t used to today’s architecture.  The Empire State was still the height of modernity when I…” Steve makes a vague gesture with his hand, searching for the right word.  “Left.”
Steve reluctantly follows him back inside, not saying a word as Tony leads him up the main staircase. Steve moves a little more slowly as he takes it all in, though he clearly is trying not to look too interested in Tony’s home.
Tony sinks back to the floor, stretching out beside Steve just as he would have if they were lounging comfortably in bed. It’s ridiculous, and he would stay here forever.  He tangles their legs together, puts his palm over Steve’s broad chest, and rests his chin on the curve of Steve’s shoulder. He traces the tip of his finger down Steve’s jawline, studying his handsome profile. He wonders what’s going through Steve’s head now, in these moments after, when the rush of lust is subsiding.
Tony stares at him wide-eyed, his arms still outstretched from evidently trying to keep Steve from falling.  And then…he’s
“It’s not really in the budget, Mr. Stark,” Coulson pipes up from the shadows in the rear of the room. Tony hadn’t even realized he was here. The man has such a meek, unassuming presence; he tends to blend in with the walls most times. “We’ve already done two rounds. We’ve got to find a girl for the part soon.”
“Sets look right, at least. Your boys made good on that.” Tony nudges his foot against Steve’s subtly, and lowers his voice. “And you…you’re looking like something else in the dailies.”
He takes a step backward, leading down the hall toward the bathroom. Steve smiles and lets himself be pulled.
“Seatbelt.  I know they’re after your time, but they’re fairly uncomplicated.  Pull, snap, click.  Make Nader happy.”
“Also helped that I was half the size of everyone else.  I see now why you were friends with me, Buck.”  The teasing comes naturally and it’s that very ease that makes Steve suddenly tentative and uncomfortable.  It’s so natural to slip back into but that’s not who he and Bucky are anymore.
not.  The bridge won’t crumble but he can.  So easily.  The wind is stronger and sharper in the space between here and there.  Maybe if he stays under the stone arches, surrounded by the draping steel cables, keeps his gaze skyward, he can be steady.  He can almost pretend he’s not falling.
“Why not?” Steve traces the veins on the back of Tony’s left hand, reassured by the familiar feel of that jagged scar along his fate line that Tony got a few months back while repairing one of his cars. He knows these hands as well as his own.
Tony presses his other hand flat to Steve’s stomach, feeling his steady breathing, and knows in just a moment he’ll feel it pick up under his palm.
“Tash and Clint head out on a week long mission tomorrow, Betty has a conference in Singapore, and Thor’s going with Darce and Jane back to New Mexico to work on that whole Rainbow whatever situation.”  Bucky finishes his drink off; Tony hasn’t touched his.  “How ‘bout you turn down my invitation now so Steve doesn’t have to hear it.  If I have to see the look on his face one more time when you say no, it’ll be one time too many.”
“I grew up military.  I have a license.  My father made sure of that.”  She states, grabbing the headset and putting it on.
“He means that Tony’s incapable of keeping his nose out of SHIELD’s business, even if he’s no longer Iron Man.” Natasha clarifies.  “I don’t see how he rates priority over my -
He has to admit that he figured Tony might go overboard on the whole thing, but instead the man’s left the place pretty much a blank slate.
“You’re hungry?” Tony is honestly surprised over Steve’s question. That settles it for Steve right then; if Tony doesn’t have these types of nightmares himself, he’s at the very least been very close with someone who has.
“Should I even bother?” Pepper asks Tony. Seeing the expression on his face, she just sighs, crumples it up and tosses it over her shoulder in mimicry of Tony’s earlier actions.
“Some of it’s still around, easy to find.  Special ordered the rest.”  Bucky smiles back at him and for once it hardly seems a strain.  His gaze ticks downward from Steve’s face toward the face of the jack o’ lantern, and his grin tightens slightly.  “Iron Man, huh…Looks good.”
Puzzled, Steve reaches out and takes the crumpled note from him, unfolding it gingerly. He recognizes Tony’s messy handwriting immediately.
“Not what—an inventor? Kinda seems like you are, Brucie. Or could be, with the right help. The right money. The right assistance.” He sets the papers back down and leans against the workbench, crossing his arms. “You know I’m rich, right?”
They shift to lie down on the bed together, a tangled mess of limbs, and Tony drifts off to sleep with the sensation of Bucky stroking his back and Steve kissing his neck.
Steve arches one eyebrow at the innuendo but doesn’t take the bait. Tony’s almost sad – maybe if they’d both gotten angry enough, they could fight this out and then parlay that heat into bed.
They settle for kissing, letting their bodies relax against one another’s until Steve can feel the telltale signs of Bucky’s increased libido pressing against his thigh. He arches against Bucky’s body and whispers for Bucky to take what he wants.
Steve’s smile is beautiful, brilliant with relief.  He presses one brief, fleeting kiss to Tony’s lips and then hesitates, eyes catching Tony’s as if looking for direction.  He must find what he needs because Steve lowers again to meet his mouth and the whole mood of the kiss shifts.  Steve pulls him in tightly and they slant together, tongues sliding deep and mouths seeking more than is possible with a single kiss.
Bucky starts massaging Steve’s balls, rolling them in his strong fingers and squeezing gently. Steve’s hips move, his legs falling open even wider, his hips evidently flexible enough as to seem nearly double-jointed. Tony slides a third finger in, but Bucky reaches down and pulls his hand away.  Bucky circles Steve’s entrance numerous times with the flat of his thumb but doesn’t push in.
“Not much of it.” Steve awkwardly lifts a hand out from under the covers, and taps his left ear with his index finger. “Don’t forget I only got half a working set now.”
Tony looks at him, and for a moment Steve swears those eyes flash with something more recognizable and
“Steve…” Whatever might have been on the tip of Tony’s tongue is lost as he abruptly comes, hand tightening around them both as his cock jerks; Steve can feel every twitch, every trembling convulsion. The splatter is warm against his skin, stray drops scattering over his thankfully bare chest, just missing the rumpled edge of his undershirt.
“Anybody teach you about Google yet?” Tony points at him with the hand still holding his glass, the liquid barely sloshing.  There’s a SHIELD-issued laptop sitting next to those files on Steve’s tiny dining room table, but that doesn’t mean the man knows how to use it.  “Because keeping up with me is going to be hard and conversations are going to be made exponentially and needlessly longer if I have to stop and explain every completely unimportant offhand reference I make.”
They both pause, breathless, in the aftermath. Tony pushes a hand through the streaks and globs of come clinging to Steve’s skin, a somewhat wild and wicked smile breaking over his face.
He takes out the pictures, the ones so fittingly showing his and Tony’s very last kiss, and then tosses them to the floor. Tony looks down as the photographs scatter and spread across the black and white tile.
to avoid his best friend, but Bucky gets so concerned when Steve’s going through one of his bouts of insomnia. It only makes Steve feel all the more guilty. Bucky’s the one whose life had been permanently altered by the war –
While the score is finished and the edits polished, it’s essentially the same film he’d seen less than a month ago at Tony’s place. That, along with the fact that he does not really want to be here, makes it difficult to focus. He hopes no one from the press is watching him watch the film, noting his reactions, because that will look bad for everyone involved.
“Of course we did,” Steve replies, not about to lie.  “But we never thought we couldn’t do it without you.”  Tony frowns, ego wounded, and Steve sees that between the man’s guilt and pride, there’s really no way to do this that makes Tony feel better.  “Stark, you’ve given us all a home.  You’re instrumental in providing tech and support, not to mention all the funding you’ve offered.  We all miss you in the field, but we respect and understand your decision.”
“No problem,” Bucky lies. He offers Tony a drag of his cigarette and, to his surprise, Tony not only shakes his head, but grabs it from him and stubs it out, tossing the butt to the cement by their feet.
Tony’s free hand presses flat against his abs, blunt fingernails raking over the ridges of his muscles. It feels so good; he wishes they were both entirely naked, every inch of their bodies pressed tightly together. But they don’t have time, and this will have to do.
“Shit,” he instinctively turns to head back to set, but stops himself two steps from his trailer. Where is he going to go? Who could he ask? He doesn’t even have Tony’s home phone number—for
With how much sex he’s already had over the past weekend, Steve is amazed to feel himself hardening quickly in Tony’s grasp as he begins to stroke.
“Betty Ross.  She was my…she worked with me on the experiments that lead up to…”  Tony wishes Bruce would spit it out; he’s tired of the man dancing around his own condition.
Any hurt he incurred from the encounter with Captain America on the SHIELD helicarrier has faded, despite the serious nature of some of the injuries. The only history written on this body is the history of James Buchanan Barnes, and this is enough to convince him that he had, at the very least, been this man once upon a time.
!" cried Laura, glaring at Clint, who was grinning.  She looked over at Steve, mortified. "I am so sorry, normally he's better behaved-- Cooper, I cannot believe you, clean up that--"
The Clint thing was a tricky one. Clint had essentially told Steve to drop it...he wasn't sure how he would handle this new information. Steve was almost tempted to call Nat. But he knew that if say, Sam, went around his back to Tony before telling him something important that he wouldn't like it. "I'll Clint later. He's an adult. We don't need to protect his feelings."
"Dani!  Where's that martini?" he demanded, glancing behind him.  He'd left the door open in case Steve wanted to hover.
Tony had only ever known Steve as a big, healthy, drop-dead gorgeous icon of perfection.  He'd seen a few pictures of Steve, pre-serum, and obviously, did not find Steve as attractive in those pictures as he did now. But now that they were bonded, did it matter? Steve could be completely disfigured Phantom-of-the-Opera-style and Tony would still love him because that's just how pair-bonds worked.  Once you were pair-bonded, it was usually for life. That was why omegas whose Alphas had distanced their bond were so shunned by society; it was an unnatural and upsetting thing to think about, a bond being broken.
"What's Project 84?" asked Tony.  It sounded insanely familiar and Steve must have mentioned it before, but he couldn't for the life of him place in what context.  Tony's brain had an incredible filter that tended to latch onto things like a steel vice, unless they were boring or irrelevant to him, in which case he dumped them with prejudice.  This was probably why most of his relationships had crashed and burned over the years; the vast majority of women Tony dated were vapid, shallow, and ditzy, so he didn't bother to listen to them much.
Karpov had inherited him from his previous handler.  He was the only one in the program who hadn't either gone feral or failed programming.  In order to be considered truly programmed, they needed to overcome base instincts, like self-preservation.  40% of the recruits failed the final test. They would be perfectly coordinated, pliant, suggestive... but when it came to drowning themselves, they simply couldn't.  Of course, that figure was slightly exaggerated. It was more like 30% that failed to drown themselves and then 10% that successfully managed to but weren't revived properly.  That was the scientists' fault, not the recruits.
Steve could hear a distant "hey!" that was probably Clint, and then a clatter of something. Probably Clint again, throwing something at her. Turns out he could read her lips from where she was stood out in the garden.  ...the "Hawkeye" moniker made sense.
Was Tony saying he had feelings for him? Was he? Was that the issue? That he couldn't just fuck Steve and move on? Steve didn't want that, obviously. He wanted commitment in his life...especially after he'd lost almost everyone he'd cared about. But Steve had a feeling- an itch at the back of his neck- that he would do about anything Tony asked for him. He would kneel again, he would- what
And it did.  Tony would have loved to eat his way through a stack of waffles, but he doubted his ability to keep anything but whiskey or coffee down at the moment.  His mind turned back to Sean-Down-The-Hall.  He wondered if he should go over commandeer another bottle of wine, and ask some questions about bonding.  After all, Steve had Leo, why shouldn't Tony have a random stranger to ask questions to?  But Tony couldn't think of any questions to ask at the moment.  Everything felt right.  Everything felt fine.  It was only when Tony found himself accidentally knotted in Steve that the questions arose, and that was hardly the right time to be asking them.
"Right," said George, who immediately saw Banksy's angle and linked his arm through Donner's other arm.
The girl stared at him with those creepy red-amber eyes, sitting crossed-legged on the bed, her hands weaving an invisible string in front of her.  "...so you're just leaving? You realize he's thousands of miles away?"
Despite the fact it was only 8am, Steve's video had gone viral, and the news was making the event the headline of the day.  Outside, checking his phone, Steve found a lot of messages from Aria giving him updates on the news cycles. Phil had sent him a congratulations text, and Banksy had sent him a stream of emojis and exclamation marks.
Dr. Gleason looked at Tony like he wasn't sure whether he was kidding or not.  "...no.  No, one cannot impregnate himself."
Tony felt a pang of gratitude.  Natasha was tough and scary but, in moments like these, he got a peek of her soft side.  If their positions were reversed, Tony doubted he'd let her live it down with this much grace.
"Both her parents were omegas. She understands," Steve said quietly and his eyes flitted out to the kitchen briefly where he could hear Aria talking with Pepper.  Enhanced hearing and all that. He couldn't catch words, just their voices, but that was more than Coulson and Happy would be aware of. "What if… when we auctioned off all the flowers, we used that to create some kind of hostel where kids from camps could go to. I'm sure the problem for a lot of them is there's little alternative. If your parents sent you there then going back home wouldn't provide a solution."
"How do you want me?" Steve asked Tony in a murmur as the backs of his legs nudged the mattress behind him.
"Hello, Mr. Stark," said Gleason pleasantly.  "I was hoping to run into you." He held out a brochure.
"Well, it can't be very nice to live with," Brazinski said. "That, and it doesn't create a stable home environment for you. And that's exactly what you need right now. Soldiers themselves can even be prone to addiction."
"Initialising prismatic accelerator," said JARVIS.  The prism was already lighting up; a steady beam of light was zipping through the chamber.  Even if the element wasn't constructed, thought Tony, at least he could take some pride in knowing his collider had worked.  A small triumph, in and of itself.  "Approaching maximum power."
Tony glanced over and immediately regretted it.  It was like some fucking goatse shit and he nearly puked.  On the plus side, his hackles went down.
"'Cause you know everything.  And the reason I don't know how to tie a bowtie is because my assistants always do it for me."
"It's okay," Natasha waved off. "I'll clear this up. Let Fury know what's happened. You boys go have fun," she said with a glint in her eyes as she straightened up, glass in hand. "Though I have a feeling things will go smoother than we expect anyway..."
"I think I'd rather go to court," he joked with Steve on the plane ride back.  Their court appearances had waned a little.
Tony shivered, holding still, his skin breaking out in goosebumps at the cold counter under him and Steve's teasing mouth exploring his body.
"Just lock this room and leave me with loads of water. And some food. And I'll be fine," Steve said. It was all he could think to say. But it wouldn't be fine. It would probably be agony.
Tony had more than a couple of drinks before they touched down.  They were dropped off at the Atlanta, Georgia, airport and then it was a three-mile drive to Scottsboro, the town south of Zephyr Hill.
"What film are we- oh!  You think we're actually going to watch a movie.  Cute.  Allow me to introduce you, Steve, to the concept of Netflix and chill.  JARVIS, TV!" called Tony into the cavernous front room.
He walked up behind Steve, the music thumping behind him.  Steve looked annoyed.  Tony wasn't sure why.  He sipped his scotch to stall for time.
"They want to take him in," Sam said quietly, lowering the phone to his side. "If the Winter Soldier can control Steve like a puppet..."
"My sex ed was severely lacking, yes.  I've been trying to make up for it ever since.  Hence the hundreds of women--"
Phil walked back into the cabin; it seemed lonely.  He walked over to Steve's door and knocked. "Captain?  I apologize, but we have to outfit you with a new ankle monitor.  For security reasons."
Steve gazed out at the city horizon from his hotel window. It was beautiful. "We both know you're tracing this call. It'll take you what, two minutes?"
Suddenly a look of comprehension dawned and for a moment Steve thought it was all coming back to him.  But instead, he reached into his pocket and pulled out the pack of cigarettes and the lighter Pietro had given him, and lit one up.
"Oh my God, totally," gushed one of the girls.  "Steve Rogers, Conan O'Brien, Carson Daly, Pitbull, Rihanna--"
"But if I don't they'll think I'm in a goddamn triad!" Steve snapped, hands moving up to fist in his hair. He calmed almost instantly. "Sorry. Shit. David, I didn't-"
He reached for the omega, shaking.  The omega had said something about someone but the words hadn't processed; he couldn't get the image out of his mind.  The sight of that mark was burned into his brain, crowding out all other thoughts.
"Whoa, man, chill out."  (A comment that Tony would have no doubt seen the humor in.)  "You're okay, you're in preheat. Give me your phone, I'll call Tony... is that your Alpha?  Sit down, buddy."
"Hey, Steve," said Tony, setting his chin on Steve's shoulder.  "Whatcha makin'? ...bacon? ...did you and Gleason eat breakfast together?  ...I'm sorry I didn't come to bed last night. I was going through some of..."  He hesitated. "...some of Dad's old stuff."
Wisdom, apparently one of Fury's buddies, insisted on giving them a brief tour of the MI-13 offices and introducing Steve to a young omega named Joey Chapman, code name Union Jack.  (Tony had been unable to repress a groan, to which Joey had pointed out that "Union Jack" was no more or less ridiculous than "Captain America.") Joey was young and had a mop of sandy hair, not quite blond and not quite brown.  He was unbonded, thought Steve's omega rights campaign was brilliant, and had apparently known Falsworth up until his death.
"Oh."  Steve's shoulders slumped.  He looked over at Aria.  "...what are you looking at?" he demanded defensively, eyeing her.  "If it ain't Ella Fitzgerald, who is it?  Who's the entertainment? Is it that Avicii guy?  'Cause I don't know who that is."
"Yours," Steve whispered in affirmation and then Tony was kissing him and it was like fireworks. He couldn't quite comprehend it, his thoughts were on fire. Steve had kissed people before.  Okay, two.  A beta blonde woman whose name he didn't know, and then Peggy, just before Steve went to fight Schmidt.
Luckily, when they got back to the hotel, there were no reporters at all; they were probably all out stalking of Fifth Ave.'s most prestigious jewelry stores.
"Stand there and look supportive... try not to cause any more trouble," said Pepper, barely looking at him.
When he moved he could feel it, a cold and horrid wetness between and on his legs, thick and sticky. Steve grimaced and lifted his head. His eyes widened a little when he looked down at himself. "Oh," was all he said, voice soft.  Steve abruptly felt awake.
. Steve was panting as he came down from his high, cheeks flushed, and his damp hair, now mostly dried, pushed messily back from his forehead.
Tony took off his glasses and cleaned them on his shirt.  Considering the state of the shirt, it didn't do much good.  He put the glasses back on, then looked back down at his coffee, studying it.
Tony ignored him, watching the Expo grow in front of him.  It looked like Christmas- all lit up with lights, the stadiums and avenues and the biodome and spotlights all blinking prettily up at him.  If he weren't currently being shot at, he would have liked to have stayed up here, flying around and admiring it.  Now that he knew what to look for, he could see the layout as the element in his chest.  Edwinium, or badassium, or whatever Stark men were calling it these days.
and you did the right thing. And you look good in that suit too," he breathed and traced the rim of the arc reactor with his fingertips. "I didn't realise they could fly so fast. I shoulda realised how strong they were. You literally told me yesterday..."
"Steve, why didn't you tell me?" she asked, and she moved over to envelop him in a hug.  Tony watched, feeling left out. No one had ever hugged him over the whole Bucky debacle.  Granted, pushing Steve was had been his fault, but... well, he'd thought Peggy, as a fellow Alpha, might at least understand some of the hurt there.
"How the hell did you learn a new language in less than six months Rogers?" he asked, teasing good-naturedly. "Did the serum make you smarter?"
Steve say he didn't want it!  Tony had won him, fair and square, and if Steve didn't want it, then why did he
Tony decided to change the topic as they clambered into the back of the SUV.  "What're you doing while we're away?" He'd managed to convince his detail that he didn't need a bodyguard for their vacation by pointing out they would going to spend a lot of it in the hotel room anyway, which had caused hearty matching eye-rolls from Beth and Pepper.
He grinned up at Tony when the other was staring. Steve was clearly very hungry (they had skipped breakfast). At the back of his mind he was admittedly thinking about the collar in the box at the bottom of the suitcase.
Steve groaned as he was woken up, sighing in relief with the ringing stopped. But then the knocking on the door continued and it seemed they weren't to be left alone. He'd really wanted a lie in with Tony, but no such luck. He sat up in bed and ran a hand through his hair. "Alright! I'm up! I'm just going to shower."
The male Alpha had come out of seemingly nowhere. He was dominant, perhaps a bit more than Natasha but not on Bucky's or T'Challa's level. He was wearing a smart-looking suit and had a dark beard that was beginning to grey at the edges. He must have come down from some of the residential rooms no one had time to check yet. Locating children had been a priority over the staff. There was something about the Alpha that screamed
"I would but I think you need to sober up and get some sleep Tony," Steve told him calmly, not sounding annoyed. He knelt down by the pool side but made no move to get in. He laughed when Tony splashed at him, some of the water landing on his cheek. He reached up a hand to rub it off. "No gin. But I can get you pizza. You're probably starving. One minute--"
And they'd made an example out of him.  When they'd shot him with the gun, the one labeled STARK, Tony had felt something wet hit his face.  That kid, the one Tony had scoffed out, had gone out a hero. His last words?  "Fuck you."  He'd spit in Raza's face.  And Tony?  He'd knelt when he'd been told to, because he didn't want his brains blown out like that kid's.  He was a coward.
"I'll see you guys tomorrow, probably," Steve said, offering Pepper, Aria and Happy a wave before heading upstairs, leaving everyone else in the seating area. Aria sighed as she dropped her laptop and files into a bag.
Donner seemed confused at the idea. Rhodey sighed. Maybe he shouldn't have gone down the honesty route... but he couldn't have kept all this up till midnight. He really wasn't that good of a liar. And Donner looked so unsure he'd hoped to reassure him, but the mention of Steve had just scared Donner out all the more.
"Steve, can you just come out for a quick word first?" It was Pepper or Aria; he was still too asleep to tell.
Tony barked out a laugh, nuzzling against Steve's shoulder.  The two of them were both a total mess and they were knotted in a way that meant separation was damned near impossible.
Her frown deepened and she picked up a phone on the desk, dialing.  Tony was pretty sure they would be allowed in; they weren't breaking any rules, yet.  Steve was in a collar, wasn't he? And it was a locking one, so there shouldn't be a problem, right?
He had a sick feeling in his gut, a terrible intuition that if Bucky was put in the system...that he would never get out.
"What time did you even get to bed last night? You look kinda beat." Whereas Steve had slept for almost twelve hours and he was feeling better than he had in weeks, actually.
"I wanted so badly for him to be okay.. .but he's not, is he? I don't even think he's there. I don't know. Maybe I just want him to be."  He sighed and then moved to ride his jean leg up so Phil could come and fasten the bracelet on.
It took every ounce of Steve’s being not to snap back around and lift Tony up by his collar and ask him what the hell he thought he was doing.
. Drives me up the wall sometimes," continued Irshad. Steve got a feeling she was asked that question a lot. Irshad wasn't mated though, or married (no wedding ring). She seemed like a free spirit, someone who didn't want to be tied down by anything.
"Welcome, welcome, Mr. Stark, Captain Rogers, super great to have you on... congratulations on your bond, of course, Bozzy and I got you a little something..."
He had thought the Winter Soldier was going to kick him, or pick him up or point a gun at him but not... not this.
Ludheim!"  He stormed off again, stumbling a little, then whipped around.  "ебать этого кролика, солдат!"
"I don't offer to do stuff I don't wanna do. But you're upset and I wanna make you feel better; what's so wrong with that?" he asked, tilting his head a little. "It's not selfish for you have sex with me if you're in the mood for it, or need a distraction...if I want to too. And it's not like it won't be enjoyable for me too," Steve pointed out, raising a brow at him.  "I would never do anything you asked if I didn't want to." He could still feel Tony's unease pang in his own chest. "And you had a kind of... insane day yesterday, I think I'm allowed to be a little worried, right? Come on Tony, what's this really about?"
"Obviously, there's something special about the captain," said the younger man, elbow propped up on the lab bench and legs dangling idly from a stool.
Tony was, in a way, lucky.  No one ogled to back of an Alpa's neck.  He kept his hair a little longer in back to hide the mark and no one had ever noticed.
." Steve huffed out a fond sigh and gently pushed Tony's hand down and off of his abdomen. "If you shower, then sleep, then
Tony's dander rose.  "That's harsh, Romanov.  True.  But harsh.  How would you know anything about my father, anyway?"
"--wonderful performance following a very level-headed press conference, during which he tactfully handled several extremely emotional issues, including force-bonding and a recent miscarriage.  Although many still argue that his actions in Yemen were indefensible, many have expressed sympathy toward his position. Early polls indicate that a majority of Americans believe that the captain's apology, combined with a probationary leave from working with the armed forces and therapy, is a sufficient response to the incident."
"Sorry.  Sorry, no... you're right... it's okay now..." said Tony, forcing a few slow breaths.  "I don't want any other Alphas--"  He stopped himself.  No.  That wasn't right.  It wasn't about what he wanted; it was about what Steve wanted.  Steve wasn't his.
"My subconscious is probably a pretty dark place," admitted Tony softly.  He wasn't sure which was worse: Steve on the outside, looking in, or Steve in there with him.
Tony looked up at Steve; the room wobbled and swayed, and Tony was aware that he was very, very drunk.  He accepted the glass from Steve and drank deeply, then handed it back, grinning broadly.  "Gross. What was that, water?  I thought it was vodka," he joked.  "Okay, take me back downstairs... I feel fine, Rogers, come on. I'm missing my own party..."  He put his arms out.  "Come on, carry me!  ...Stan, I'm serious, I feel fine now.  I wanna keep partying; it's my birthday.  My fortieth one, Stan, that's a big one."  He rubbed his chest, breathing out deeply.  It was still burning but the alcohol helped.  Tony could feel the music pulsing up from the floor below them.  "You said yourself, Stan, it's better to regret doing something than not, right?"
Tony listened to the agents banter, keeping his face arranged in a blank mask.  A memory floated to his mind, an old memory of Obadiah admonishing him for his expressiveness, telling him to grow a damn beard if he couldn't keep a straight face.  That had been a long time ago.  Tony had gotten very good at controlling his expressions.  And also, he'd grown a beard.
Tony elbowed Steve a little.  Both women were omegas, but both of them gave of a Nastasha-esque vibe of extreme deadliness.  One of them, he noted when they passed, had a little henna tattoo of a crouched panther just beneath her left eye.
Tony was rambling; he abandoned his search for the mythical razor and walked out to find his clothes.  The Mark V was standing blank and dull in Steve's room, looking thoroughly out of place.  A perfect metaphor, really, for Tony.  He was out of place in Steve's life, too.  He wasn't a person who especially liked structure or discipline, and he'd never be able to work with the Avengers- he was pretty sure- and Steve obviously had a commitment to them, plus the whole omega rights platform... Steve's life was filled to the brim and Tony felt like he'd overstayed his welcome.  Of course Steve wouldn't want to admit to Natasha or any of his friends that Tony had stayed the night; Tony was Steve's antithesis; he was selfish and rude and brash and there was no place for him in Steve's admirable life.  Plus, Natasha was an insanely dominant Alpha... maybe now that Steve knew how great sex was, he was going to try to jump ship, shack up with someone more powerful... Tony would happily fight anyone who tried to take Steve from him, but if Steve wanted to leave, he couldn't really prevent him.  But she had Clint.  Tony felt confused.  Steve probably didn't want to hook up with her, he just... didn't want Tony.
"Can I have a scotch, neat?  Make it a triple, actually. Oh, do you guys still have crème brûlée?  ...they have the best crème brûlée here."
"Remi and Danielle are releasing a statement from SA this afternoon, we think everything you said was
"You...you wanna go to sleep? Because I don't really wanna sleep in our suits, Tony," Steve said, sounding a little tired. Since when did being drunk make you tired? Steve thought it made people giddy? Urgh, he was so out of practice. He was never doing this again. What he drank tonight probably would have killed a regular man, or several.  "I've gotta get to Clint's in like...seven hours, no, six...."
He and Natasha took up a proper sparring routine again; he and Sam found a running schedule that worked for them, when Sam was in town.  Now that Tony knew Sam's 'type' he was less bothered by his singleness. Not that had really ever come up since their honeymoon period. Coulson mentioned missions in the future but there weren't any now and Steve was growing restless. They had left him out of New Mexico; he didn't want to be left out of whatever happened next.
Had it really be forced?  Pietro was sure Bucky would do all sorts of awful things if instructed, without even a second thought.  For the first time since they'd met, Pietro felt uneasy around the Alpha. Wanda was right; he was unaccountably strong, treated with a serum similar to Steve's... with the prosthetic arm, he was almost unstoppable.  If he wanted to take an omega, even one like Captain America, he probably could. Pietro was fast but if Bucky got the upper hand or the element of surprise, that was that.
Steve didn't sleep that night; he was so goddamn giddy. He started drawing in his room and got carried away, grabbing a stool from the kitchen so he could move up to the ceiling and draw up there too. Steve tended to channel his positive energy into art now, and his angrier energy into running or the punching bag.
Tony stared at the forest of orchids, thinking about the lone white orchid in his father's study that he'd never questioned.
... I'm kidding, I'm kidding!"  He gave Steve a grin. "I guess there won't be any Eskimo games today... you just want to cuddle in bed and watch movies?  Normally I just spend Christmas drinking eggnog alone."
...maybe it was just because of the noise of the helicopter.  Yeah, that was it, Steve consoled himself.
"Gone off the grid.  Natasha sent one of her contacts in Russia to check out where she knew Steve had been staying. She said she found a hotel room full of his things, just abandoned, including a journal and a sketchbook. Virginia, Steve would
The helicopter was a Sikosky UH-60, modified for stealth.  Tony was already picking up all of its frequencies; there were three different open radio lines; the pilot was none other than Romanov.  Tony let himself be impressed; he didn't know she knew how to pilot aircraft. She was already number 3 on his To-Screw list.
Howard that well. It's just rumor. People are only speculating 'cause I'm a 'mega. No one gave a shit when they thought I was an Alpha. It's kind of funny, when you think about it," Steve breathed and tried for a smile,  but it was weak.
So while he didn't understand the accusation, he still found himself apologizing, because the thought of doing such a horrible thing to someone was devastating.
"Mr. Stark, do you consider it irresponsible to take a week off for Formula One racing when you could be out further stabilizing the Middle East?"
this?  He wasn't an abusive drunk, like his father.  No-- Tony was a fun drunk.  Didn't that count for anything?
He picked it up and threw it to make the dog go away.  The dog did, but it returned again with the ball.  He threw it harder, and farther, but the dog brought it back once more.  He put the ball in his pocket.  The dog bowed and bounced around with excitement, then barked.  He quickly threw the ball, not wanting the dog to bark and bring attention to him.
He remained crouched a couple of meters from Steve, watching him, sipping his drink.  Steve didn't look well. He still smelled delicious, but nearly getting punched in the face by Captain America had been a sobering experience.  Tony felt a lot more in control than he had since Steve's heat had started. He wanted to reach out and comfort Steve, but he didn't want to get within reaching distance.  The Mark VI had him pinned pretty good, but Tony wasn't going to get cocky and take any chances.
"Donner's rather attractive, isn't he?" said Malick.  Aw, fuck. So he'd noticed the resemblance to Steve as well.
Pepper and Happy looked up at each other, still pinning Tony.  Happy bit his lip, trying not to laugh at the sheer ridiculousness of the situation.
He saw Dr. Ludheim looking down at him, her face framed by a fluorescent light, and for a moment, she looked like the Madonna.
"Fuck," whispered Tony to Steve as the waiter vanished.  "...this is so fucking surreal. ...I'm gonna need something stronger than wine.  ...Piper looked like she was like, fifteen." He reached up to scratch at his collar again.  Steve's comment about "protecting the youngest" gave him the heebie-jeebies. It was like they were on a sinking ship without enough lifeboats.  "...I'm worth like twelve billion... I could probably buy them all..." he said. Depending on how many there were, and how much they went for.
He was crying again but only because he felt hopelessly confused.  He was like an over-stimulated child and didn't know how to deal with any of these unfamiliar feelings.  For the first time ever, he wished for a retraining session, wished he could wake up to the feeling of nothing, to be given orders and to carry them out and to have no thoughts or emotions.  This wasn't right. None of this right. He didn't even know how he'd come to be here.
After all, Steve was America's golden boy. Their sweetheart. Logically, after bonding (ha, someone should have told Bucky that) it was normal for the couple to copulate a
The rate as which Aria could answer her phone was really quite alarming. "I was hoping you would call. Good honeymoon?"
But he needed to reassure him. "Please, Alpha," he said, voice seductively soft. "Tell me what to do, how to be good for you."
Steve pursed his lips.  "And please, don't describe a ten hour car drive as 'hanging out'. Do you know what it's like to not pee for over ten hours? It's horrible.  And...and I don't expect you to be cool with it. The whole shit situation is massively shitty. I'm not trying to rub your nose in anything. But it
He walked over, reached over her shoulders, and began typing silently, his fingers a bit slow on the keyboard because of the armor.  A moment later, the computer pinged.
Tony was staring at the full breakfast with a strange expression on his face.  “Stan,” said Tony softly, reaching out and catching his arm.  “Stay with me?”  He paused, then, against his better judgement, added, “Please?”
Pepper set Donner down and smoothed down her blouse.  She turned to Lowenstein. "Start the paperwork, please, Mr. Lowenstein.  Thank you." Her voice was clipped.
The contents were telling.  Tony learned that Steve was one of those people that put bread in the refrigerator and that he preferred whole milk.  Tony closed it and wandered over to a bookshelf to start reading the titles.  It was like a Museum of Steve and Tony's curiosity was piqued.  He explored with the sort of unapologetic, naked interest of a child.  The whole place smelled like Steve.  Tony was happy here.  Every little detail made him happy, with the possible exception of the picture of the guy on the door of the fridge.
"L-Let me go. S-Stop it. I don't want it. Stop." Steve was breathless, he was struggling to speak, his brain fogging over with hormones and a confused and reluctant sense of arousal.
A major silver lining to all this is that, whatever "big surprise" Hammer had, it was about to be completely and totally overshadowed.  Ha.  That would show the smug little prick.
"I love you," said Tony quietly.  He kissed Steve's neck.  "Let me take care of you for a few days.  You'll be okay, Steve."
. Not that it really meant anything... he still wouldn't love Steve. Not like Steve had loved him. His bond with Bucky had made him feel powerless and trapped... with Tony it was totally the opposite.
"Look, I don't even care about Steve coming back, I just-- I just want to make sure he's safe--"  Tony's voice was shaking. "--that Bucky character is a dangerous maniac, a stone-cold killer.  Who
Banksy gave him a hug and a tight squeeze before he left. Even though he was still a little drunk he gave Steve a very serious nod before pulling away...although Steve wasn't entirely sure what that meant. Maybe it was an encouragement; maybe it was a thank-you.  Maybe it was nothing at all.  Or maybe it was everything, because there were some things that were simply too big for words.  Steve wasn't sure, but he squeezed Banksy back and returned the nod, because whatever it was supposed to mean, Steve think he sort of got it... one omega to another.
Traffic had come to a grinding halt; there was the car parked in front of them, of course, in the middle of the road, but there were also two men with guns targeting Fury.
Happy flipped on the radio as the car made its way down the long, winding drive.  Tony leaned his head against the tinted window, warmed by the sun, and slurped the noodles with a bored expression.  Happy was eyeballing them through the rearview mirror; halfway up the drive, he was so distracted, he nearly hit a flamingo.  "Hey, watch it!" snapped Tony, jabbing at him with the chopsticks.  "That's Bernard the Sixth!"
"...that's not really a fair question, Steve," said Tony carefully.  If Steve were small, Tony wouldn't have looked twice at him, probably.  Part of Steve's initial appeal had been his muscles, had been seeing him totally demolish Happy in a boxing ring.  It wasn't until Steve's heat that they had reached the conclusion that they were scent-mates. But when Steve was small, he'd never gone into a proper heat, so if he were small, they might not have even discovered it.  "That's like me asking you if you'd still want me if I'd never been through that shit-show in Afghanistan. You getting the serum... it's what let you come into my century in the first place, and it's what let you be involved in the army, and SHIELD, and end up with me.  If you were small, we would've never crossed paths to begin with."
Tony realized he was clinging to Steve, squeezing him protectively, his breath coming out in sharp little huffs.  The mere
"Hey Pepper," Steve said, perking up instantly at the sight of them. She didn't seem mad at him, right? Maybe Aria had been right. Maybe he was just paranoid.
Tony slipped their hands together.  There was no real tenderness in the gesture; it was for show.  "Well, c'mon, 'mega.  Let's go give 'em what they want," said Tony.
"If you want to go and work you have to put clothes back on," Steve told him, not wanting Tony to have sparks flying near... down there.
"-and I can't take it back because I joined some government spy organization, very hush-hush. I'm doing that now-"
"...Pepper, please, just lay off, will you?  I nearly got killed twenty-four hours ago, I deserve a break.  It just... it caught me off-guard.  I swear, it won't happen again.  Now that I know how bad it is, I'll be prepared, I won't... you know... react like that."
Steve sighed. He could understand that from a rational level. There was no point getting angry...the important thing was that Donner was safe. "Well, thank you for coming David." They both stood and shared a brief handshake followed by a hug.
"Tony!" cried Pepper, jumping up and rushing to him.  She knew, immediately, what had happened. Tony's eyes had that unfocused look they got when he went into a panic attack.
"Yes, they are magnificent, aren't they?  The jewel of our military strength... the elite," said T'Chaka, a pleased looked on his face.  "A pity my wife has passed. She was a quick wit... you would have liked her very much, Captain.  She was among the Dora Milaje's best warriors... one of the greatest our country has ever known." He had a distant look of fondness.
"It's amazing you're learning all this Tony. We're going to need every detail before we can attack them, and I want to be ready for my birthday." Maybe it was strange, but Steve liked the idea of doing it on his birthday. He would get a lot of media attention around his birthday anyway, he might as well make the most of it. He pressed a quick kiss to the other's shoulder before they stepped back out into the crowds.
"They're asking him about being force-bonded," said Bucky, gesturing  "But I already fixed it! Why is Stark there?"
Tony sat up, oblivious to the sheet pooling around his waist, barely covering him.  Pepper was unfazed by either the nudity or the arc reactor. "No, no, hear me out, it's an amazing idea."
"Tony.  How you doing? I double cycle."  The voice was thick with a Russian accent, rough from years of smoking.
"One right does not mark out a wrong. But it's a start. And it's a gesture. I am not saying that tonight will compensate for my actions, or anyone else's. But I am hoping that tonight makes it evident how seriously I am taking the consequences. Thank you."
There wasn't, to Tony's knowledge, any equivalent on an Alpha's body that had quite the same effect.
"Aria would like to know if it would be possible to visit this afternoon," JARVIS sounded out. Steve worried on his bottom lip.
"...again?  Jesus Christ, come on, how hard is it to keep out of the shot?" demanded Howard.  "...speaking of shots, Patty, refresh my drink, will you...?"
Steve stare down at the letter in his hand and then carefully set it down on the table next to one of the first bunches of orchids. "We need to get someone to search through all these. I imagine that Mark isn't the only one writing to us for help..."
But then, his Alpha was MIA. He had no family. There would have been no one to miss him. He felt a strange sensation in his belly.
"Tag along?  Did you just call me a tag along?" demanded Tony's voice from the radio.  "I got approved for action weeks ago, I have every right to be here, I'm just as legit as you are, Dark Angel.  How dare you question Steve's leadership. ...what did Fury get us? If it's another fucking orchid I'm going to lose it."
Nick straightened up, like he was seeing Steve in a new light or something. His gaze flickered between Tony and Steve again. The cool-headed beta almost looked uncomfortable. "Please tell me you aren't thinking of getting pair-bonded.  You can't--"
turned on, his Brooklyn accent crept in, and Tony loved that, loved the loose, brash feel of it, compared to Steve's normally well-spoken, neatly composed speech.
Within ten minutes Tony had created an eBay account and posted 1 kilo of "purified fibroin" for $100.  Considering a 5% solution of 20 mL was over two hundred dollars commercially, Tony felt he had set an excellent trap.  Now all he had to do was wait for someone to buy a suspiciously large quantity of spider silk and then he would have their address.  Easy-peasy.
Tony was angry at himself for letting the asshole who did this get away.  He should have gone after him and killed him, or taken him alive, but instead, he'd let him go, too busy dry-humping Steve on the floor like an animal.
Steve whimpered as Tony pushed into him and his body accepted the intrusion easily. Steve was still tight around him, though, having taken no fingers beforehand. He could feel every inch of him and his hole clenched at the stretch. When Tony pressed in a little further and adjusted the angle Steve cried out as he grazed over that sweet spot inside of him.
Steve smiled politely, saying nothing, but his eyes spoke volumes. There was something dangerous glinting behind blue eyes.  He was almost daring anyone to ask about life in his century.  No one did.
They were talking about the auction of a live human being as if it were a sports match they had all attended.  Even these omegas seemed to have grown comfortable with the idea of their status being treated this way. Clearly they thought it was perfectly normal to be traded and sold and made to fight and kept in a little roped-off pen.  Being the omegas of the elite, of the rich and powerful, all of the people here seemed well cared-for. None were sick or starving or anything like that; they were dressed in nice clothes and didn't seem sad. Yet Steve couldn't help but wonder how many had been force-bonded.  Arrangements were only made illegal, what, twenty-eight years ago? And if this conference was any indication, it was still happening, albeit more subtly than before.
"Spent.  Like I got hit by a truck," said Tony with a weary smile.  "...you're going into post-heat, huh?" He nuzzled the top of Steve's head.  "It's rough. It's really rough... but we get through them okay, right?"
Steve smiled patiently.  "What if I let you use something like a piece of ribbon? It's not a collar, but you could still tie it around and it would look close enough that you could pretend."
He changed into gym clothes, per Aria's instruction, before they headed out. He didn't like leaving Tony along still half-stoned but the offer to get out of the house had been incredibly tempting. Steve asked JARVIS to call or text immediately if Tony had or looked like he was going to hurt himself (something Pepper had informed he could do.)
Tony had barely reached the bar and begun mixing himself a drink when he heard the crash and several exclamations of surprise.  Steve had hurled his mug across the room and it had shattered; Mackenzie's hand was on his hip holster, ready to draw.
"If you can't handle that, then..." Tony shrugged a little, and looked away. "...but I already decided that...
"Steve.  Steve, you're doing great, seriously.  I'm really glad you let me mate you and let me bite you again.  It's okay that it didn't go exactly like we expected. Not your fault.  I love you. You're a good omega." Tony nosed his hair again. "You're my omega.  And I love you."
Ellis didn't look remotely convinced but he didn't press the matter. He still glanced over Steve with some alarm, however, as if he was trying to work out where all the blood had gone, or where it'd been coming from. Maybe he could see a bruise poking out the top of Steve's collar. If he could, he was polite enough not to mention it. "Bad day at the office?" was all he said as he sipped at his own drink.
Tony took the opportunity to clock him in the jaw, then swear profusely, because punching someone with a hand that had several broken fingers was a sobering experience.
But soon they were naked enough and their clothes were being set alight. And the cage was slowly filling with smoke, masking the heat pheromones. Steve could think. He could feel. Sure, there was a fire in his cell, and he was practically naked, but least he could could function like a semi-normal human being.
. He'd wanted to intimidate them...but in the end they had humiliated him. One of them had got away because of Steve's very nature being a weakness to him and he almost hated himself for it. It created a doubt in the back of his mind. Maybe people were right when they said that omegas don't make good soldiers? Now they had this kind of chemical warfare... unless Steve could find a solution, how the hell would he stand a chance in a fight? One prick and they could have him on the floor, convulsing with a fever. It wasn't a comforting thought.
that was, okay?  I don't spend a lot of time around omegas.  I've never felt anything like that.  It was like... like he was some sort of emotional crack."
Steve let Tony take his hand and lead the way, arriving at one of the many tables laden with food. The spread was impressive but Steve was trying his best to be polite and not devour it all.
Steve was a living weapon, sure.  Steve could easily protect them. But Tony didn't want anyone throwing any punches.  He didn't think he could handle his omega protecting him. He wished he had a suit. Even the Mark III.
"I'll...I'll talk to Fury when I'm ready to.  But I need to sort out my head first, okay? I'm not having him take me off active duty before I've even been out there. I'll go crazy." Steve had to be doing something. He'd been more still in the past five months than he had been in years back in his day. He had to be moving, fighting, resolving. Steve needed a mission like it was nobody's business.  "But I think we both know that if HYDRA wanted me dead I would be already," Steve pointed out. "Everyone knows where I am. Stark security or not- HYDRA always find a way in if they want to. I think they want my attention, but they don't want me dead."
Natasha got up and went to the front of the jet to take it off auto-pilot and maneuver it onto the base.
He headed upstairs to find Rhodey had shown himself out. Steve really wasn't sure what to do with himself. He'd gotten into enough trouble for the week, hell the year. He was about to head upstairs when he smelt a hint of nicotine in the air. He stepped outside to find Aria by the pool on one of the deckchairs, she was smoking and tapping away her tablet. Aria looked up to see him and smiled, "hey."
"...talked to HR, but at this point I think I'm probably going to end up having to bring up a civil case.  Trent already contacted the Horseshoe Society about representing us. Or maybe he'll just quit. We've been having problems with them ever since he was forced-bonded, to be honest.  They just don't treat him the same and it really weighs on him."
Tony was practically scaling Steve.  "Right. Safe," he agreed, clinging to his omega.  He nuzzled Steve's hair. "Safe omega. Good omega."
, again," Steve said and his gaze flirted down. "If they ask me what I think about government legislation I'm gonna be honest about it Tony."
"I went to bed before dawn," said Tony quickly.  "I feel fine, I just need an espresso."  He heaved himself out of bed.  He did feel worn out, but Tony bounced back from everything quickly and he was desperate to get some coffee and liquor in him for breakfast.  "...do you want me at the interview?" he asked, stretching.  Discovering shirtless pictures of Steve in the news had been fun the first time.  But Tony didn't know if he liked the idea of Steve doing it again.  Who had painted the flag on his abs?  Another omega?  Or...?  He didn't ask but the idea nagged at him.
Steve slipped down off the bed and unbuttoned his shirt with deft fingers before he slid his jeans down too, putting everything into a neat pile on a chair before he finally slid his boxers down too. There was something about him being naked and Tony being totally dressed that thrilled Steve with the imbalance of power.
Steve cracked open an eye and turned his head sideways to look at Tony. "I know you liked looking at it. But it's still
"If this is a date, I'm getting a bottle of Malbec," he informed Steve.  He set the menu aside, paused, and then reached across the table to entwine their hands.  "...I've only been here once before," he said, looking up at the strings of lights over the courtyard.  "Years ago.  I was with a girl named Beth.  Didn't work out.  I always liked this place, but, ah... I'm... you know, the thing is, I'm not really known for being a charmer so much as a playboy, and this place sorta seemed... overly... you know.  Romantic.  And I haven't done romance in years.  I sorta thought about taking Pepper here, maybe, if she'd ever agree to a date.  We could be like, y'know... those guys."
"A w-what?" Steve stammered. He took a step back, hands up.  "M'am I'm not- I'm so sorry. I don't know how I got here!"
"Why do you think that is, Captain?" asked Fury, tossing Steve's file onto a low table in front of them and fixing Steve with a stern, one-eyed glare.  Tony clung to Steve, not especially caring if anyone saw and judged them.  He had expected his feelings toward Steve to stabilize, but instead, they were stronger than ever.  The honeymoon period, Tony was discovering, wasn't about emotions going away.  No, it was just about learning to handle them.  Since mating properly, Tony's body, mind, and soul had begun fine-tuning themselves to Steve.  Tony felt like he could practically read the other's mind.  It was thrilling and terrifying how close Tony felt to him, and how close Steve probably felt to him.  Tony tried to console himself by thinking of Steve as an organic JARVIS.  It wasn't weird that JARVIS knew every little thought and attitude and emotion, so why should he care if Steve did?  Perhaps because Tony had never cared about anyone like this, except, perhaps, Pepper.  But Pepper was a beta and no matter how much Tony liked her (and he liked her a hell of a lot), they couldn't even physically achieve this kind of bond.  The sensitivity to Steve's emotions, his smells, his body language... this was deeply rooted in instinct, evolution, hundreds of thousands of years of Alphas and omegas adapting to each other.
Natasha shook her head.  She was starting to think Stark wasn't exactly battle-tested.  Not by a long shot.
Several of them looked shocked that One would talk to him in such a manner.  A couple were nodding in agreement.
Pair bond jobs being threatened he could deal with. But Yemen was bigger than him. And if anyone tried to execute any of his friends, especially Natasha, he would happily go rogue to save her. The mental institute thing though... Steve couldn't exactly argue with that. Oh, his ma would kill him if she could see him now.
Time went quickly. They had a lot of sex.  It was better than talking; Steve could not talk to Tony because what he wanted to talk about was Bucky. Tiberius delivered pills and only saw about five things he probably didn't want to, which Steve counted as a success. They went through all the fruit and cereal bars in the house and by the end of a few days Steve could feel the heat tugging at his bones, saying its goodbyes. He'd probably have a steamy morning the next day, but that was it. His body was done, drained.
"Steve's going to use his press conference on Friday to raise money to help educate Yemeni and Syrian children.  Obviously Boz and I will help," said Banksy breezily, hands behind his head. "We can give you a few plugs on the show, since we're on Thursday night, and then help out the evening of.  And for once, I agree with Jeff... you should absolutely sing. You're good."
"Happy will be taking you in half an hour," Aria said, ushering them up the stairs even before the last of the omega-rights entourage had left the room. "Go get ready. And Steve, take a shower."
And Tony understood just how much courage it took to take that chance.  Especially when, like Donner, you didn't even have a suit of armor.
"He's still alive. Or he was..." Steve drifted off. "He might never wake up again." Not confidential, but very close to the truth.
"Not different enough," Steve found himself saying without thinking. "There's still a lot of issues in education around omega needs. There isn't enough accessibility for suppressants and safe spaces for heats. And there's still a lot of prejudice. I can't even believe, that with today's technology, there's still issues surrounding the availability of abortion. Everyone talks about equality, but not nearly enough people actually
Tony smiled sadly at Steve in his leather jacket and his wind-swept hair.  Steve had to be the most bad-ass omega he'd never met.  He was going to miss him.  "...you, uh, you really think I'm..."  Tony made quotation marks in the air with his fingers.  "...
"Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!" he screamed, ripping wires off his head.  "Fuck!  Oh, fuck!  Fuck me!  That was--
Steve glared at him, waiting for him to apologize.  But Tony was drunk. He wasn't getting Steve's words, by the looks of it. "Just... just stay here and sober up," he said, finally.  "You can't be drunk around the kids."  Then he stepped back out, a slight slump in his shoulders. It was evident in every fibre of Steve's being: he was disappointed.
"What the hell is happening?" Happy asked, pulling out his firearm and shoving Pepper behind him.  Steve had all-but forgotten that Happy was usually armed.  Not that a handgun was going to do a bit of good against a mech suit with military-grade weapons all over it.
. "You gonna try and talk to Stark about your feelings, hm? ‘Cus there's obviously something there."
"Yes," said Tony without hesitation.  "The gantry-based, non-portable armors weigh two hundred pounds and have an output comparable to Hoover Dam, Steve.  I can lift like ten tons in some of those things.  ...not that all of them are that strong, I mean... you might be able to take on one of the portable armors.  But the ones that are hitting sonic speeds and tossing Jeeps across football fields?  Yeah, no, forget it.  Those suits are designed to take on anything.  Unless Fury starts recruiting demigods, then I'm gonna be the strongest one on the team."  Tony got a smug sense of satisfaction knowing that, in the exoskeleton, he would be the indisputably most powerful Avenger.  Not the most powerful Alpha, but who cared?  The suits were artificial strength, inorganic enhancements... but they still counted.  Inside the suit, Tony was invincible.
Clint cracked an eye open and looked sideways at him. "I don't know Steve," he admitted. "I don't want to you to get yourself hurt again."
Tony had slept poorly.  They were in a canvas tent on a narrow cot.  Steve, perhaps because of his days in the army, slept like a baby.  Because of his size, he kept accidentally shoving Tony onto the floor.  Not that Tony would have been able to sleep anyway. Tony's only association with tents and cots and shit was from Afghanistan.  He was used to silk sheets and pillows with four-figure thread counts and memory foam mattresses; to him, these accommodations were frankly inhumane.
"Maybe we could... could go on a date tomorrow Buck," Steve said, his voice thick. "Yeah. Tomorrow. That'll be perfect. I'll wear blue, you like it when I wear blue, don't you?" His bottom lip trembled.
Just fine, as it turned out.  Steve had been taken under Hal's wing and was feeling far less self-conscious than he had before, although he was still well-aware that he was head and shoulders taller tan every other omega there.
"Unless you go to a doctor to check your insides, you won't know for a few more years.  But it doesn't matter. You're interrupting. Eat," said Laura, tapping Cooper's plate.
, it's kinda interesting that now he suddenly isn't liking the idea of sharing-" Natasha cleared her throat. "Anyway. Let's not go there."
"Oh, hi," mumbled Tony.  "I'll be up in a sec, okay, if you can just put on a pot of coffee, I'm up, I'm up..."  He wasn't sure who was talking to him but he was so used to demanding things from people that he didn't really care.
He sipped his coffee, sprinkling his breakfast onto the ground, watching the birds peck at it, lounging casually inside the donut.  The curve was comfortable enough that he could probably sleep up here.  It was a more appealing idea than going home to his ruined house, where Steve was probably spitting mad at him.  Tony's stomach flipped over and Tony pretended it was because of the hangover and not because of Steve.  Steve wasn't even in heat anymore, and Tony still felt an insane urge to impress and protect him.
Tony felt a pang in his chest.  Not a lot of people offered that.  Stane was seen, at the end, as a dangerous madman.  To Tony, he'd been the guy who taught him piano. He'd almost forgotten that Boswell had interviewed him, too.  "...thanks," he said. He decided to change the subject. "Thirty years, you've been with Banksy?"
When a waiter offered him some wine he took the water off the tray instead, downing it. He felt hot in the small viewing room. Maybe it was just the crowd of people, all excited and giddy due to the race being prepared for outside. "Jesus Christ-" Just as Steve was putting his glass down he realised Tony had already slipped out of his view. Fuck. He was being difficult on purpose. The ass. Steve was about to go after him when he felt a hand tap on his shoulder.  "Rogers, right? Tony Stark's new PA?"
Ah.  So he was one of those, who would order Donner to be bad and then smack his around.  Donner's muscles tightened a little, readying himself for it, and forced himself to look into the Alpha's eyes.  After only a few seconds, he dropped his gaze again.
"Discipline! It's a talk by Maggie Frond. She's very famous. Got a book and everything, my copy of it's signed."
Tony looked up.  A young man was shifting his weight, a nervous, excited smile on his face.  Another Alpha.  Tony suddenly realized that he'd never actually seen an omega at this place, except with an Alpha.  Shit.  Had he dragged Steve to one of those places where it was casually Alpha-only?  There were laws against discrimination, but often, upperclass places drew an Alpha-centric clientele and it became a sort of unsaid rule that omegas were expected to stay away.  And sadly, most did.
"...fine, then how 'bout you and me have an Alpha thing and you come see me and we hang out while Steve and Clint go to their stupid special secret clubhouse?"
"I don't know anything about omegas, Steve.  I... I can't... you spied on me... and you... went into heat and I just lost it, I lost control.  I can't... shouldn't... I'm a genius, I'm Tony goddamn Stark. I'm too... too
He moved to open the car door, hoping the fresh air would help wake Tony up. Steve sighed. "Maybe we should just let him... sleep."
Someone above him patted his shoulder sympathetically.  "Don't worry, we'll leave that in.  I'm just disconnecting some electrodes.  The simulation is over.  I know, it's a little disorienting when you first wake up."
"I said no. You're high and I'm not. I'm not having sex with you," Steve insisted. He kept his tone patient, understanding and calm. It was hard not to smile at Tony being so petulant. It wasn't like Steve was often in the mood. But this wasn't about that.
He wasn't completely homebound.  Pepper took him out shopping one day; it was an incredibly sweet gesture.  Steve found much of the 21st century overwhelming and he appreciated having someone to go with him.  She introduced him to different fashions, told him simple do's and dont's... and for the first time in this century Steve actually chose his own clothes rather than just being given them.
"No, no, it's fine, really," she insisted.  She reached for the baby in Tiberius's arms, but Tiberius gave such a desperate look of pleading that her arms dropped.  Tiberius had gotten strangely quiet since the baby had been passed to him and Tony wondered suddenly if he could have children.  Did you need a bonding gland to do that? Another question for Dr. Gleason.
"You're awake," said Steve, eyes darting between his Alpha's damp chest and face briefly. "I, er, made breakfast... I figured you'd want to get your strength up."
"I know what it's like to lose a bond, Banksy," said Donner, pulling him into a hug.  "...it doesn't get any easier. But
"Well, Captain... you know better than anyone that omegas weren't treated as equals in the forties.  Your friend's attitudes were, in a very large part, shaped by the culture around him.  I doubt his actions were a reflection on your competence as a mate.  But going back to your bonds."  As a beta, she said "bonds" fairly casually.  To any Alpha or omegas, hearing the word in plural was as strange as referring to someone's wives or someone's fathers; it was not a word for which there was typically more than one.  "I have a hypothesis.  You and Mr. Stark only recently bonded, correct?  In fact, you're still in your honeymoon phase.  It seems to me that your body is trying to tune itself to him, but because it already has a bond, it's also struggling to reforge the bond with your friend, Bucky.  Does that make sense?"
"Can't you feel him?" she asked.  Charlie wasn't bonded.  She looked over at Tony, chewing her sandwich contemplatively, shading her eyes from the sun with one hand.
He wasn't sure how long he'd been in the room; the lights were on constantly and because he was underground there was no sense of time.  But it must have been a while because he was growing hungry and his mouth was growing increasingly dry.
Steve let Tony tug him up and followed him into the shower. He used the peach shampoo again, the sweet scent pleasant. Once showered Steve left Tony in the bathroom to shave, kissing his cheek before he pulled away with a towel around his waist. He wasn't sure what one was supposed to wear for breakfast at seven in the morning so went to grab jeans, a tee and a hoodie.
"That was amazing! You were amazing!" Aria exclaimed as Steve walked off. He was shaking with the adrenaline and he could still hear the roar of the crowd in his ears as he'd closed up for the night and they'd began to cheer.
Tony watched a bead of gasoline drop from the car in front of him.  A perfect, beautiful bead of liquid.  The life of the car, draining away, leaking all over the tarmac...
"Send to voicemail; don't take any calls right now, Jarv!" snapped Tony, cradling Steve to him.  Steve's skin was clammy; Tony could actually see his pulse in the hollow of his throat.  "Pretend there was a power outage or that I forgot to pay my phone bill or something... I don't know, just don't put him through! ...Steve," said Tony, trying not to let his omega's panic infect him.  "Hey.  Steve.  It's me, Tony.  We're in Malibu in 2010.  It's me, your Alpha, I've got you.  It's just us.  I need you to calm down, buddy.  Breathe with me."  Steve's body was tense and twitchy; his fists were clenched and Tony had to admit that he was worried Steve might take a swing at him.  Tony wouldn't be able to duck it, and being punched in the face by Captain America was probably like being hit with a brick.  But his concern for Steve was overriding any logical sense of self-preservation; Steve was his omega and he loved him and he would gladly let himself be punched in the face if that was what it look to get Steve to calm down.  He knew Steve, like him, had PTSD and knew that Steve, like him, suffering flashbacks and panic attacks, but this was the first one he'd really witnessed.  Combined with Steve's weird behavior earlier in the morning, Tony was starting to get genuinely worried about his mental health, but he had no idea what to do other than to be there for him.  Tony was ill-equipped to take care of other people; hell, he could barely take care of himself.
now. He rubbed a hand over his face and sat up in bed, one of Tony's arms lingering around his waist, his Alpha's robe pooling around his thighs.
to look good in this; it was meant to be tight...it didn't feel wrong to wear it in the bedroom. But Steve had made it very clear, from day one, that his
"Peggy and me were... I don't know. It was the middle of a war. We never got time to figure it out. And now she's eighty-nine and I'm still in my twenties." It felt so weird to say it out loud. Peggy had lived her entire life while Steve had just been... sleeping. "Anyway, sometimes she's kind of out of it.  She recognizes me, though, usually.  And she knows we're bonded. I'm sure she'll be happy to see you.  She does mention Howard sometimes." He grimaced a little.  "We, uh, kissed once."
"...some of the news about us... people are saying, you know.  It's a political move.  Us bonding," adding Tony.  "You're Captain America, national symbol of freedom and justice and... whatever.  And I'm... y'know."  Pause.  "A Stark."  Another pause.  "My company pretty much single-handedly outfitted the entire armed forces for like twenty, thirty years.  ...I've probably killed a hundred, a thousand times more people than you.  People I never met.  Never had to actually look at."  Pause.  "So that's what some people are saying.  That... Captain America, shacking up with an arms dealer... y'know.  It's... political."  He glanced down, picking at a nail, then added, almost viciously, "
, but that wasn't the point; it was something Tony was self-conscious about.  Also, their height difference was glaring; Tony was looking up and Steve was tilting his head down, and there was something about that that felt very weird to Tony. Maybe it was because he was
Tony laughed incredulously.  Was it going down, or was that natural variation?  Was he going to be okay, then?  He'd wait a bit and then check it again.  He poked at his neck; it was stiff, still, the rash still present.  But he didn't feel
. He'd been around these Alphas too long and he was getting very close to punching one of them. And if he wasn't careful then he actually
And that was the thing. He really didn't. Omegas were a forgotten slice of society, beholden to archaic rules that targeted
... but yes, Steve could sing. Not well, but not terribly, either. And everyone in the room was drunk so what the hell did it matter anyway?
That was the thing. Steve didn't think. He just walked.  He took the steps down and then headed out to the entrance of the hotel. A woman at the desk called to him but he ignored her. Maybe it wouldn't bother Steve so much if Tony'd actually moved on from Pepper, but Steve knew he hadn't - or wouldn't. And that reaction in the hotel room proved it.
Steve found Tony passed out on the sofa. Maybe he'd been heading upstairs, but he clearly hadn't made it the whole way. Steve sighed and went to put the food in the fridge before he gently scooped Tony up. The Alpha mumbled something Steve couldn't understand, but didn't really wake. He frowned as he looked down at him, spotting a few bruises to accompany the one on the back of his head from earlier. Tony had carried on working, then. Steve carried him upstairs and moved to set Tony down on their bed. He fetched a damp towel and wiped away the evidence of his work, the grime and grease from the workstation.
"We should get him somewhere more comfortable," Natasha murmured. "They'll have a lot of questions." She hesitated a few seconds. "It might be easier if I ask them instead of..." Her eyes flitted sideways pointedly as Hill and Fury were flitting about on the other side of the glass, clearly in a somewhat heated discussion.
"Our last evening like what?" asked Tony.  "In love?  No, sorry, buddy, you're stuck with me.  That's how bonding works.  Honestly, I'm looking forward to being less... emotional.  This is really intense."  He remembered how he'd growled at Steve's neighbor from across the balcony, how he'd had a massive meltdown in front of Pepper when he'd found out about Bucky.
"Aside from your publicists, you would do well to schedule meetings with your lawyers.  Dr. Gleason, Dr. Brazinski, and Dr. Brennan all request to see Captain Rogers on a daily basis for the next week.  Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes, the Undersecretary of Defense, the director of the CIA, and Gideon Malick of the World Security Council all require briefings with Captain Rogers and Mr. Stark, separately."
"...it doesn't count," said Tony, running a hand over his ragged face.  "The first night doesn't count... because everyone goes to bed so late after the poker game... why's he here now?  He was supposed to be here Saturday night."
Coulson looked up from the couch.  "Morning. I made coffee," he greeted Steve.  "Natasha just e-mailed me. She and Clint were delayed but said they'll be in for the party tomorrow, no later than six.  ...did Tony have another late night?"
Another benefit to their rigorous daily mating was that Tony's drinking ebbed.  It didn't stop, but at least now it could be measured in glasses as opposed to bottles.
Trey and his brothers both shrieked with delight and everyone burst into laughter; Brooke looked smug and Tony looked startled at how thoroughly he'd been shot down.  Taylor was already tweeting about it; Arcadia gave Brooke a high-five.
If anyone had ever told him he would be pair-bonded only a few years ago, Tony would have laughed.  He had never considered either bonding or marriage for him. And if anyone had told him that the mate he would end up with was a male omega, not a beta female, he would have thought they were nuts.  And if anyone had ever told him he would kneel and ask a male omega to wear his ring, he'd tell them to get their brain checked.
He brought Steve's hand up and kissed the back of it, softly.  "I'm not going anywhere, omega," he said quietly, reassuring. And he meant it.
"Yeah," said Tony with a sigh, "I know."  He had known.  He'd known since 2008.  And as he and his mate walked through the facility, his mind drifted to the teenage omega he'd seen downstairs, the one that had called him the Merchant of Death and stared at him with pure, undiluted hatred.
Forget it.  Easier said than done.  Tony wasn't someone who let things go easily.  He couldn't forget.  But he could certainly distract.  He had a psych eval to prepare for, and Steve's birthday, and the Mark VII.
Steve's cell was small.  Ten paces long and five paces wide.  It was literally empty, save for a horse blanket on the floor.  They gave him no water and no food. There was also no light. The hallway was tiled and well-lit with fluorescent lights but none of the cells (there were six, the other five unoccupied) had any lighting at all.  The floor was tile as well, and in the center was a drain. It was more like a shower stall than a cell, to be honest. The walls were concrete, solid, along with the ceiling, and the door was shatter-proof glass lined with adamantium bars several inches thick.  There was a small window at the bottom like a mail slot but it was too narrow for Steve to fit his hand through.
A lump formed in his throat.  He tried to swallow it with more whiskey.  He had a million questions for her; she was one of few people Tony didn't mind looking ignorant in front of.  But he didn't speak because he felt like doing so would cause a deluge of emotions and after his total breakdown in front of her after finding out about Bucky, Tony felt it was important to maintain control around her for a while.  He didn't want her to think that bonding had made him into an emotional mess.  His eyes darted up to meet her green ones, which were flooded with sympathy.
interested in Steve Rogers," Brooke interrupted him, her eyes fiery. Steve swallowed. He'd never even considered in his life he could have something like this.  He'd never been on top.  He'd never penetrated anyone. Especially with Tony's past, he'd never let Steve take control like that. Ever. And a part of him had always wondered what it would be like, to actually be with a woman...
The aggression he'd felt initially was fading into a dull sense of defeat.  Of helplessness. Steve was going to do this no matter how well he argued against it.
"Yeah... well... s'ok," said Tony.  It wasn't okay but he felt so completely out of his element right now.  If a crush on Pepper (a crush Steve already knew about!) could set him off, then anything could, really.  Steve was... unstable. And Tony didn't want to say the wrong thing and have Steve running off to Bucky again.  The mere thought of the other Alpha chilled Tony to the bone. Steve had run off with him. A day after trying to mate (and failing), a day after promising him he wouldn't leave, Steve had left.  He'd gone to Bucky.
The song, thankfully, calmed Tony down. There was some cooing from the kitchen (probably Tracy and Alexis). Steve glanced over to see that Banksy had grabbed Danielle to dance with too. "See? Is this so hard?" Steve said softly, pressing a kiss to Tony's forehead. He didn't think about the height difference much...but it probably should have occurred to him that it bothered Tony. He could still feel how wound up his mate was and sighed, closing his eyes too for a brief moment. "Come on. You get to screw Captain America every night, and he doesn't, isn't that enough?"
The first thirty seconds passed without event, Steve just lazily teasing his tongue around the rim of Tony's knot just because he could. It was a strange sensation but undeniably hot. Before the serum Steve could never have been stretched like this - but he could be. His blue eyes were glazed with arousal and wicked and his cheeks were flushed. A minute in and Steve was beginning to feel the fact that he was, in fact,
Steve sighed and looked up at the view, steepling his fingers under his chin, still struggling to blink back tears. "...Can I have a hug?"
His hands fisted in the sheets as he slowly moved his hips back and up, taking Tony in until he eventually bottomed out.
They stopped by a Thai takeaway and picked up food on the way home. Steve hoped that if he pandered to Tony's favourite foods that that might up his chances of getting him to eat something.  He devoured a container of pad thai noodles on the drive home; as always, his metabolism demanded constant fuel.
"I was trying to be nice, sorry.  I'll return you to your regular scheduled asshole now," said Tony.  "Why the
"No. We didn't," Steve said quickly, seeing the panic in Tony's eyes. "My virginity is still very much intact," he joked weakly and moved to steal the second cup of coffee off the tray. Tony frankly looked adorable with his hair sticking up in every other direction. Steve wanted to run his fingers through it and push it back from his forehead.
The soldier was in the lab after hours.  He was watching the television, which Karpov had left on to keep him company.  Karpov was busy on the computer, occasionally yelling into the phone. They'd stop by to escort the twins, who had a meeting with Dr. Ludheim and Baron von Strucker.  Karpov was in a foul mood; the mere mention of Dr. Ludheim made his face twist in annoyance. So the soldier was pleasantly surprised he was being allowed to watch the television, and even more delighted to see the blonde omega he liked on the screen.
They came again together, Steve's cum coating both of their stomachs as well as the sheets, but neither one could be bothered to care much.  By evening Steve was firmly and undeniably in heat, and greedily begging for more, even as Tony bit his neck and stroked his cock and filled him up, even after Tony doubted he had anything left to give.
Donner walked over slowly, keeping his eyes down.  He knelt without being asked. Rhodey wasn't sure how the hell to respond to this; he reached out and patted his head softly.  Donner leaned in very slightly to the touch.
At some point the sergeants had managed to separate Tony and Gideon and were holding them away from each other at different ends of the room. McKenzie stepped forward to help Donner get Steve standing. It soon became evident he couldn't stand by himself. He tried to reach for the gun in McKenzie's belt and he would have got it too if the Colonel hadn't stepped forward, a hand on Steve's arm.
The crowd's attention went from the blocked exit to him; he was almost instantly nearly drowning in frantic people clutching at him.
?"  He didn't know where it was from but it stopped him, and he felt like he was on the cusp of remembering something, something important.
The first year he'd gone because Jarvis had wanted to.  In one of the only times ever that Tony had seen Jarvis lose his composure, he had crumpled on the ground, draping himself over the headstone, crying.   Tony had remembered feeling embarrassed and uncomfortable and worst of all guilty. He hadn't cried at their funeral and he hadn't cried then. He just stood there awkwardly, while Jarvis wept.  By that time, he'd already wasted away horribly. Jarvis had been about the same age as Howard and by then he was in his early seventies, so Tony had never thought Jarvis's death was untimely, but he was sure that, had Howard lived, Jarvis would have, too.
The dial tone lasted for a while until finally Clint picked up. "What? Who is this? This is not a good time." For once the archer didn't sound his usual self. He sounded... serious. Maybe even a little stressed. There was talking going on in the background; the voices were getting raised but the words weren't quite clear enough to work out.
Gideon sounded like he was smiling on the other line.  "So. When Donner comes home, my men will pick him up. Because nothing would make my day like seeing Captain America kneel for me, especially after what an awful day I've had with all of these... unfortunate accusations against the schools I had invested in.  I'm sure you understand the kind of wonderful stress relief Donner can provide. He's a sensitive soul and he loves better than being a good omega. Something
Pepper appeared in the doorway with her tablet, her cellphone cradled on her shoulder.  "Tony, this better be important, I'm on the phone with General--"
looking for you, Erica is here from Natick Labs and has some interesting ideas on synth fibers for your newest project.  ...oh, Ms. Everhart, how do you do?  ...please excuse us for just a moment..."
"What, two bottles of wine?  That's nothing, Steve, c'mon, this is white wine, for cryin' out loud.  I'm eating food with it.  ...are you serious?"  Tony sulked a little.  He was pretty sure Steve was being over-dramatic.  Steve was someone who clearly had some issue with alcohol; he'd just ordered a mocktail unironically.
Steve knew Tony was still upset and he desperately wanted to make it better, but he didn't know how to do that. Aria had set up meetings with multiple lawyers for him to meet with over the next week for a certain project he was planning but now he had no buzz for it.
It was the first baby bump picture that caught Steve's eye.  Laura was standing there, smiling, one arm around Natasha and the other around her rounded stomach.  Clint was kneeling in front of Natasha, his head resting on her thigh, his hands on Laura's stomach, also smiling.  The three of them had a perfect synchronous relationship that didn't look like any one of them was the third wheel.
--kshot... he's downtown, at the hospital... he can't walk.  Got shot in the back." Tony closed one eye and mimed shooting a gun.
. Sure people thought he was weird, intimidating...whatever. A freak still, but he didn't care. Steve had done
feel right now.  What were your intentions when you went to Siberia and called HYDRA?  What's your take right now on the consequences
"I don't want to be one of those clinging, over-controlling Alphas who needs to know where Steve is twenty-four seven," explained Tony.  "...maybe he got called away on a mission or something. ...lemme just check with Phil." He called Phil. "Hey, Phil, by any chance, is Steve... is he like, on a classified mission?"
In the hospitality suite, every omega had reacted to Steve leaving like he'd just dropped his pants in front of everyone, with a mixture of horror and fascination.  The Alphas looked over, equally horrified at this breach of protocol. No one quite seemed to know how to react. Call security? Security was no match for Captain America.
He didn't want to do that again.  He was infuriated that Steve was running off with Bucky, not calling him, pushing him away mentally (as well as an omega could, anyway)... but there was nothing he could do.  Steve was out of control and that was that. Tony didn't want to lose him again. His pride was wounded, yeah. But his instinctual inclination to protect Steve meant that he couldn't stay mad at him for long.  The threat of Steve leaving was too great. He felt almost trapped, trapped in a relationship with a jealous partner who ran amok and didn't care about him and--
"...forming a non-profit takes, like, a while," said Tony, trying to remember.  "I think it's a one or two month
It was, surprisingly, Phil who reacted first; he actually took two steps toward Tony, fists balled, before Natasha threw out an arm to stop him.
He'd first heard him in Nick's car when he'd been driving Steve to see some new jet they'd built. He told him it was his 'quiet day artist.' Steve couldn't really imagine Fury on non-quiet days; even his quiet days seemed to have an undercurrent of constant tension.
Tony could understand why his father would have been eager to put Steve on the Avengers team.  Yes, Steve was noble and stubborn and strong and well-trained... but also, Tony was certain that Steve was right, that Howard had done it to make others uncomfortable.  As a sort of prank, just to be difficult and subversive.  Worse, back then, no one had known how to suppress heats chemically; it was only halfway through World War 2 that that particular technology had become available.  Before that, an omega who went into heat was pretty much forced to suffer through it, and was a target for Alphas to prey on.
When JARVIS announced two minutes, Tony had to admit, he was impressed.  He was clinging to the sheets, shivering; he could feel his knot pulsing.  He was pretty sure denying himself hadn't been worth it.  He was so hard it was painful.  But he had to give credit where credit was due: Steve could indeed hold his breath for a pretty impressive length of time.  ...with nearly seven inches of rock-hard dick shoved down his throat, no less.  He was damned if he was going to cum before the two minute mark, no matter how sensitive he was or how hot this was or how deep Steve took him.
Tony's brain was already compartmentalizing everything.  He wasn't thinking about anything but the next five or ten minutes.  Cram Steve into a tuxedo, and they could get back in there and he could have another drink.  That was as far as his brain was operating.  Objective: get Steve to his dinner.  Reward: a drink.  Two drinks.  Ten drinks.  It was open bar and Tony had never needed a drink more in his life.
Tony examined his face.  He looked... okay.  More well-rested than he had in months, that was for sure.  He congratulated himself on fixing his arc reactor, not dying in Monaco, and taking Captain America's virginity.  All in all, a decent week.  Maybe an 8, 9 out of 10.  Yeah.
That was the worst part.  The knowledge that, in all likelihood, Bucky was the more dominant Alpha, and he had gotten to Steve first.
...I mean that I like that you know what you're doing. Or at least, know what you're doing most of the time," he teased softly.
...could be funny.  And here's one about-- is that seriously about how to 'properly' have sex? Oh my God. That's hilarious. We should go to that one. I bet they just want you to do missionary all the time."
"We want to take your statement as soon as we can, Steve, so you don't forget any details," Maria explained calmly. "SHIELD is taking this very seriously, as is the WSC. We really want to get to the bottom of what happened here, Steve."
There was a round of greetings and then Fury, who'd been standing silently off to the side, opened the door into a stuffy conference room.  Tony had the feeling that he was going to be put on trial... or court-martialed.
"This is insane. I'm getting like twenty emails a minute. Serious," Aria muttered, tapping away at her tablet furiously. She was lying on the sofa with her feet in Steve's lap, the omega sitting with a towel around his shoulders and a cup of coffee in his hands. His hair was still damp from the dip he'd taken in the sea.
"Is he taking me to you?" asked Bucky.  He was feeling optimistic. He was about to be reunited with Steve and Colonel Karpov and they could go home and live in Brooklyn, one big happy family, and with the two of them at Bucky's side, he was sure he would get over this weird fog that was in his head.  He might not even need his notebooks anymore. (He was on his third. It was black, like the other two.)
"I love you too," Steve told him, voice strangely serious as he reached forward to grab Tony's hand.
"Aren't you gonna invite me in?" demanded Tony, hovering.  Steve was on the seventeenth floor.  "I don't wanna park the suit outside, last time I was in Westwood I got ticketed.  They
so...I should probably leave you to it," Steve whispered, tone playful. He hesitated and then didn't back off, Tony's touch and presence magnetic.
"Are you going to be be playing, Tony?" asked Eric as the two of them leaned against the wall of the grand ballroom.
His head swam and he tried to remember.  He squeezed his eyes shut; red shapes bloomed and burst under his eyelids.  "Yes. Howard was there. He was..." The memory was hazy. The emotions bubbled up before the actual facts did.  Anger, betrayal... sadness. "He took my omega."
Blessedly, Pepper was on the phone, yelling at someone from the Department of Defense, which meant Tony didn't have to answer any questions about his limp; he pushed Steve off and leaned on Happy instead, feeling slightly better about having a beta help him than an omega.
"So she's twenty-one?  Awesome," said Tony.  He paused.  "...how about Captain Rogers here?  I don't know his birthday."
Tony held up a hand and sighed deeply.  "Okay, okay, I get it, I see where this is going," he said, beginning to unbutton his shirt.
The office was a little impersonal, Steve thought. Every feature felt calculated and thought out, like there was some kind of underlying tactics involved. Maybe Steve was just naturally wary of head shrinks; he'd had to talk to a lot, after SHIELD had unfrozen him.  In fact, he already knew Dr. Brazinski somehat.  Her office decor was inoffensively precise; Steve didn't mistrust her for it, but he didn't like her for it, either. Carefully, he took a seat in the chair she suggested. He folded his hands in his lap neatly, falling back into army postures and training. It was like a comfort. Steve sighed quietly.
"  (Steve could hear Clint whining in the background.)  (He'd witnessed Phil once before in pre-heat and it was not a pretty sight.  Phil was a nester; he'd torn apart an entire room.) "--to get pregnant. Also we have the data that was on that computer, it looks like they already recreated the serum but it didn't work.  They had five Alphas go feral, no word on what happened to them but I think we can guess. There's none left, thank God. Also--
"I mean...I kind of had trouble connecting with everyone," Steve said. "But Tony's been very patient with me. Especially with twitter, it took me a while to really grasp that. I remember waking up one morning to be told that Taylor Swift had tweeted at me? I wasn't sure if I was supposed to be offended or not..."
Steve let out a high pitched sound that bubbled up from the back of his throat as Tony teased at his most intimate area. He was fully hard by this point, his erection shiny with Tony's spit and curved against his stomach.
At the frat party he and Rhodey had met at, Tony had been doing mental math for shots.  The Stark Wunderkind, they called him; he was something of a mascot, a seventeen-year-old who was balls-deep in two Masters programs and was known for hovering around the robotics lab helping out Ph.D candidates for fun.
Tony flicked on the repulsor jets and spiraled upwards, scanning the crowds.  They were scanning back, pointing up, oohing and aahing, but Tony ignored them; he was looking for signs of trouble.  The throngs of people, the spotlights, the amount of sensory information coming from multiple stages was overwhelming.
"I am.  Actually, does everyone want to introduce themselves?  We were a little late getting started so you didn't interrupt anything."
Steve sighed.  He did not want to join Tony in the shower; the mere mention of the Tesseract left him unsettled and put a damper on his whole weekend.  It was dangerous and he did not care if it was the 21st century; he thought it was better off left alone.
That had to be the biggest culture shock for Steve- the casual attitude everyone now had toward omegas, the recognition that their humanity was just as valid as that of betas and Alphas.  Sure, there were prejudices- plenty of them.  But at least, legally, they were almost equals.
was very lucky," Steve breathed. Off the top of his head he could probably count about ten different scenarios where he'd almost been taken and lost his 'virtue', as it was called back then, and only gotten away by the skin of his teeth.  And that wasn't even counting all the sticky situations Bucky had gotten him out of. Sure, he owed a hell of a lot to Bucky but he also owed a lot to
"She's an omega," pointed out Aria.  "I talked to her agent.  Also an omega, actually.  Really nice guy."
got better, too. Sure, maybe one of the walls in the hotel suite got a little dent in it and maybe the headboard snapped a few places (four). But the hotel were polite enough not to complain about it. Apparently Steve and Tony were infamous enough to get away with quite a lot.
"Mishaps?  Is that what we're calling them?" replied Tony, cocking his head.  Then he added, "I've been real lucky to have Steve. He's... stabilizing, I guess."   He shot Steve a glance and suddenly felt like their fight was stupid. Sure, Steve had gone off on him for no reason, but he was probably just stressed about the show.  And the last seven months had actually been some of the best in his life. They'd been easy. No stress from the company at all. No board or shareholders to harass him.  Just unlimited time to work in the shop and listen to music, and all of that peppered with lots of sex. Steve was humble and complimentary and made sure he was eating. Steve was like Pepper but so much more giving, so much more affectionate.  And Pepper was right. Steve
Suddenly Number Eighteen stepped out of line and hopped off the stage, too.  She was smiling but it was the nervous kind of panicked smile people get when they're about to cry.
Downstairs, Tony was singing along to his music as he put the finishing touches on one of the gauntlets.
Steve was standing, hands clenched by his sides. He was shaking with both fury and probably a dull sense of fatigue; the infection was gone but his injuries weren't.
"You spent an entire night in that suit, only making the poisoning worse. We really don't have time for chitchat, Mr. Stark," Phil said, polite smile curled onto his lips as always. The guy seemed so sweet but Steve had sparred with him once or twice-- not so sweet.
and you know you do else we wouldn't be having this conversation. And yeah, I drank. But... not like you do. I drank for special occasions, or with friends, or that time I trapped my hand in a door. But it was different too. I was tiny. A glass of whiskey and I would be on the floor. You drink it like water. And don't even
He was already falling asleep. Steve could feel it tugging at his bones. The knot lulled him into something, a sleepy something. He wanted to stay connected and close to Tony for as long as possible and this was the best way to do that.
In the bed, Tony curled up on his side, tugging more sheets around himself.  He'd grown up on Long Island, in the lap of luxury; he'd never witnessed the kind of discrimination Steve had, in Brooklyn.  To Tony, omegas were servants, but they were generally treated well.  Unlike Steve, Tony had no real concept of omegas facing any actual hardships.  It simply wasn't part of his life experience.
!-- last night.  Couldn't even remember the guy's name.  Sean? Mike? Something really basic like that.  He knew they'd talked about DeSoto but he couldn't for the life of him discern why he would be interested.  DeSoto wasn't his type. Whatever had intrigued him the night before was lost now.
Upstairs the betas were trying to ignore the sounds of crashing, music, and, occasionally, a yowl of pleasure from Tony.  ("
"You oughta see the other guy," said Tony bravely.  A couple of omegas behind him rolled their eyes.
She settled down on the end of the bed, since there was only one chair in the room.  Tony barely stirred; he nosed the pillow a little. Despite all the bandage changes, some of Steve's neck had dripped onto the pillow; he could smell it.  And even a beta probably could have guessed by the way Tony was clutching it to him. Earlier, in his sleep, he'd been mouthing at it. It was sweet, in a sort of disgusting way.
chest," replied Joey breezily.  He loped over to the car; Steve had his back pressed against the side of it, holding a pistol aloft.  "Oy, Steve! I took care of the snipers."
Tony had the sudden realization that everyone was being a lot nicer toward him, or at least less hostile.  And he realized why. He had gone to Frond's stupid little lecture on discipline. She had humiliated Steve.  And then he had shown up at the dinner without his collar on.
after he went into heat, and, I don't know if you've seen the headlines, but now Captain America is championing omega rights and if anyone gets ahold of what you did--"
"Is it about Clint?" pressed Tony, who hated being left out of conversations and could think of no other reason Fury might be calling.  They had not called Clint to inform him of the possible discovery of his brother. Fury shouldn't know about that, but Fury had a way of finding things out.  Tony was willing to bet money he knew all about Project 84 and that it was entirely possibly he knew about their search for Trickshot. Clint, blissfully unaware, was currently stationed out in the southwest, guarding the Tesseract, which, he had assured Steve, was a very boring, stable position.  He had not asked for any more info on his brother. Perhaps it was just too painful, or perhaps he didn't realize they'd found out more.
The four of them sat in a ward together, Tony clinging to Steve, practically on his lap.  Across from them, a woman in preheat was grinning madly. The moment they accidentally made eye contact, she began chattering away.  "Hi. My name's Marissa. My sister's in there. I guess my hormones screwed hers up so now she's having a baby. It's her first one.  Her husband's a beta. I'm going to be an aunt. Sorry, I'm super excited. Are you guys hungry? This place has sucky vending machines.  Why's there a cop with you? Ben's brother is a cop. Ben's my husband. He's a beta. He's with my sister. Her name's Melissa. This is her first.  Sorry, I get chatty in preheat. Have you met the doctor yet? He's a total hunk. Alpha. Bonded, though. 'Just call me Richard.' I like him. He seems pretty busy though.  Any of your guys got change for a dollar? I'd love a Snickers but the vending machine keeps spitting out my dollar. Have you been crying? I get emotional in preheat too. Do you want a Snickers?  I'll split one with you if you can make change." She sprang to her feet and began pacing.
"Dr. McCloud," corrected the doctor, flipping open a chart.  "She's on night shift.  I'm on day shift.  I'm Dr. Martin.  A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Stark, Captain Rogers.  Congratulations, first and foremost, on your bond; I read about it on the news this morning."
"Nightclubs are very different to the kind of dancing I'm used to," Steve pointed out, smiling a little. "We used to dance to the beat and with proper moves and everything. Now there's just... a lot of grinding. Not sure it counts as real dancing."
"Don't worry, we'll make sure you're taken care of," said Banksy evasively.  "C'mon, have a slumber party with us, Donner! How about you and me and George all take a room together, huh?  I heard you got accepted to Harvard... you know, George here just got his degree, too. In theater, right George?"
Tony was torn between going after the guy and helping Steve.  He couldn't leave Steve alone, could he? Steve was vulnerable like this.  He only needed to bump into one Alpha guard and...
"I'll see what I can do," mumbled Rhodes, looking disgusted with Tony.  Knowing Tony, there was only a 50-50 chance he would show up to the award ceremony anyway.  Tony had won enough awards not to care particularly about any one of them very much. He often told Rhodey that the only award ceremony he'd never miss would be the AVN Awards, and that he felt his 90's sex tape should have gotten him at least an honorable mention in the "amateur" category.
"You're thanking me now, Ty. But you're probably gonna have to hear some stuff you don't want to. Or see something awkward, so...I'm sorry about that," Steve mumbled. "I hope we can still look each other in the eye after all this."
Tony practically purred, rolling around and squirming happily as Steve tried to run a towel over him.
Banksy got up and began pacing again.  "I mean, he's not really that old, he's barely in his eighties, really, and he's in great health.  Like they said, he's a fighter, and--" Banksy stopped suddenly and then crumpled like a marionette whose strings had been cut.  His previous, slightly manic rambling was replaced with a high, keening wailing that went on far, far longer than was normal.
"Well, we couldn't very well have dragged him off with us," replied Joey, tugging his mask off as they walked.  His face was young and fresh. "Sometimes it's about the greater good, isn't it? When you're a soldier, sometimes you have to do nasty things you'd rather not do."
His cock was still throbbing.  He was scared to move.  Knowing that tugging it hurt Steve was terrifying to him; he wouldn't try again.  The idea of hurting Steve in any way was inconceivable to him.  He existed to protect Steve.  Steve was his.  He had to take care of him.  He couldn't hurt Steve.  No.  Anything but that.
"...I would hate to get on his bad side.  He might break my leg, too," said Pietro, who sounded mocking rather than sincere.  "Should I hand these notes over to
Steve swallowed Tony down with a hum, a strange thrill trembling down his spine as Tony held him there with his spent cock in Steve's mouth. He stayed there, determined to be good for Tony. When his Alpha's fingers eased away Steve slipped off, nuzzling against Tony's thigh before he straightened back up.
"As you know, all your missions have been off the record, and your involvement in SHIELD is, at this time, not endorsed by the United States government.  However, you have some unique skills and knowledge that has proven very useful." Fury tented his fingers. "You've interacted with the Tesseract before, Lately there have been some... anomalies.  We're curious if you've seen anything like that before."
"Now, eh, this position isn't possible for everyone. But it seriously does increase the chance of--"
Tony let out an unearthly shriek and snapped.  This wasn't a playful nip; this was a lunging bite, fast and feral.
Tony let out a long, slow breath.  "...I don't," he said grudgingly. He pulled himself onto the bed and lay down next to Steve, then laughed sadly.  "I still want to mate. Even through this total shit-show, I'm hard as diamonds. Heats are so fucking stupid." He pulled Steve against him, one arm around him and the other hand still gripping his hair.  He rubbed himself against Steve's thigh, just for some relief.
"He's a super-soldier; he's healing great," said Tony petulantly, pushing off the covers and sitting over the edge of the bed.  "...and why don't you serve drinks on hospital wards?  Ethanol is a disinfectant, isn't it?"
He let Tony drag him into the spa, which Tony booked in its entirety so that they could have some privacy.  "Privacy" was subjective; the staff was still there, watching them, ever-attentive.  Steve looked around self-consciously, unsure of how he felt about getting undressed in front of strangers.  It took some elbowing from Tony for Steve to pull off his clothes and climb onto a massage table.
"And then an hour after that for each one," Steve told him, watching as Tony decimated their bottle of wine. After a third he would still be under influence during the simulation, which really wasn't ideal. It ran off the sub-conscious and a drunk sub-conscious was a stressful thing to be stuck in, surely?
Tony held Steve's hand and let them be dragged up to their suite.  The penthouse offered a nice view of the park; the furniture was all upholstered in a style that was both modern and timeless, as if WWII-era London had clashed with their own time.
Champagne and drinks were passed around whilst Gleason delicately took Steve aside. The doctor sank down onto one of the sofas in the next room heavily. He looked tired. Steve would offer him a bed but he knew from experience that David would insist on driving home. His partner left for work early in the mornings and they didn't like the kids waking up in an empty house.
and cheesecake, unless you count liquor as food, in which case I'd say single-malt scotch or a dirty martini.  My favorite pizza toppings are pepperoni and pineapple.  I secretly think leather bracelets are cool but I'd never be caught dead wearing one.  I actually didn't lose my virginity until I was nineteen, not sixteen like I tell everyone.  I hate tennis.  Fucking
"Why are you doing this?" he demanded as Steve turned the page to a picture of Tony eating a snowcone, his mouth red with syrup.  "Is this punishment for not calling?"
Steve whined as Tony got up behind him. his front draping over his back. Steve gripped the cushions of the sofa for purchase, his forehead pressed against the edge as he offered up his neck to Tony. He trembled at the first drag of teeth and then moaned as Tony's teeth sank down into his neck. He got wetter, the sensation a delight. "Yours. Yours. Please Tony, I need-" He choked a little as Tony nudged against his entrance.
Steve smirked a little when he realised he'd ended up on top of his Alpha in the process of turning off the alarm. He ducked his head down and trailed kisses up and down Tony's jaw and across his cheeks.  "Morning," he hummed with a lazy lilt to his voice. "Sleep well?"
, in a scary Amazonian sort of way.  You've never seen omegas like this, Steve.  You'll love them. Oh! And they all wear like, these collars with panthers on them, I think the panther is like the symbol of Wakanda, like how we have the eagle, and the same company that made their made ours, too.  Neat, huh? So you guys'll have a lot to talk about."
Something gave beneath his teeth and suddenly his mouth was flood with a dark, bitter, astringent taste.  Tony let go immediately, spitting. "
"Dooon't call me a horse," Steve grumbled, forehead pressed to the cool cement floor. Mhmm. That felt nice. "S'
He had never willingly gone down on another man but it was like riding a bicycle.  It had been two years since he'd been forced onto his knees with a gun to his head, and they'd trained him well.  He was feeling too good to feel disgusted with himself; in fact, he felt like this was the first truly selfless thing he'd ever done.  Poor Steve. Nearly a century old and never had a blowjob. Tony's tongue traced his shaft, the veins, his lips grazing the head as he bobbed his head, feeling Steve grow hard, opening one eye lazily to check on Steve's reaction.
Everyone frozen in confusion as he leaned over to speak into Gail's microphone.  Gail looked surprised, too.
Trigger warnings apply to this chapter: Steve gets a rape kit done and Tony talks about some of his experiences in Afghanistan.
DeSoto was lean and muscular, with a shaved head and pierced ears.  Wearing the sleeveless shirt, Steve spotted two small, pink, circular scars on his upper arm.  On his dark skin, they stood out glaringly. They looked familiar.
"I'm not the one whose thinking about him!" Steve snapped. He was trembling. His mouth tasted of his sick and was too dry. Natasha offered him a cup of water and Steve downed in it in an instant and then she wiped at his mouth. Why wouldn't his hands stop goddamn shaking? "That wasn't
"I'm just going to call an orthopedic doctor in," Dr. Martin said. "I want a second opinion Mr Stark's foot.  While there's no obvious fracture, I'm still concerned there could be some damage to--"
Steve almost reached out to Tony, resisting the urge to lean down and steal a second kiss. He felt an odd sense that he should... wait. He would wait to be prompted before he did anything. And it would often go that way when they were in bed together. It went without saying that because of his 'omega instincts' Steve liked being 'good' and doing what he was told. Whilst, in real life such a concept was demeaning, in the bedroom it didn't have to be. Steve could just enjoy himself and not worry about how he came off to anyone but Tony.
A picture of a teenaged Tony, smiling wryly for the camera.  It didn't quite reach his eyes. He was in a black robe, holding up a diploma.
Dr. Gleason departed.  Sam sat for a few seconds by Steve's bed, then rose.  "Well... I gotta go give some more statements. Don't worry about the shit storm, Steve.  We look out for each other; we got each other's backs. That's what it means when we put on the uniform, right?"  He put a hand on Steve's shoulder.
"Fuck," hissed Tony.  "Fuck... fuck... fuck..."  He'd never before felt so helpless in one of his suits.  He looked up.  His enemy was all smiles.
Boswell was more or less right about Tom and Steve; they'd holed up in Banksy's dressing room for the time being.
"Don't say it like that," Steve groaned and huffed out a soft laugh. "Makes it feel weird." He thought quietly about his birthday. Before they'd never had enough money to do anything really. Bucky would get pizza from the local Italian, a few of their friends would come over and they'd drink cheap whiskey till they passed out on the sofa. That's what they did for birthdays. They never really had the option to do much else. Apart from that time Bucky took him to Coney Island, that had been perfect. But they'd never done presents beyond practical things like clothes, or
There was a bang from down the hall and suddenly Karpov was striding in, wearing his uniform, his beret perched jauntily on his head.
Tony practically fell down the stairs to the first floor, then to his shop.  He made sure his armors were operational; paranoia came naturally to him these days.  Three suits were primed and ready; Tony made JARVIS run another set of diagnostics on them anyway.
"No! We just... we would really like it if you would get dressed," Steve said, clearing his throat. "Now, are there other people here? And do they give you a key for this lock?"
Tony's eyes fluttered open and he stretched, smiling.  "Merry Christmas, Stevie." He reached out to touch Steve's cheek and struggled to sit up.  He grabbed his glasses off the nightstand and observed the breakfast in front of him, going straight for the bacon and coffee.
"Yes.  ...of course, I know you were busy... running Stark Industries,” said Stone, voice dripping with annoyance.
When he went back upstairs he found Tony still passed out and/or sleep. Steve imagined he would be that way until morning at least.
"Sounds like people are already getting their hands on him," replied Ian, who had wandered over to listen in.  "Until Bennett sells him for good, he's obviously renting him out."
"Terrifying!" said Tony with delight.  "I wanna laugh and cry and punch someone in the face.  My stomach keeps dropping, I keep getting choked up--"
"Ha!  Told you!" said Tony triumphantly, tapping the glass.  "Metal arms, see?"  One of the doctors looked up with irritation from her clipboard and mouthed,
The thing is... the costume did not leave much to the imagination.  It had been designed that way, to show off his muscles, to highlight how perfect he was.  The perfect soldier. The perfect Alpha... if not for the fact, of course, that Steve wasn't an Alpha at all.  The paradox was erotic in its own way, Steve's body being so well-muscled, but also lithe, the movements of his hips enticing, contradicting the flex of his muscles and the girth of his dick.
During Steve's heat, Steve had been too preoccupied with Tony to do anything too destructive.  Although he
On Aria's tablet was a picture of Steve, his shirt undone, his fingers dragging dramatically through a painted-on collar.  Next to it was a single word: FIERCE.
"...we haven't really mated like that since last year," he said, hoping to recapture the peace both of them had been feeling before.  "...sorry it didn't last long."
He microwaved a Hot Pocket, ate it, and then dragged himself to bed with a bottle of Jack, feeling utterly wrung out.  He tossed and turned for a moment, but gave up, eventually making his way down to the shop, where there was still the opened box of old records he had been rummaging through earlier.
, the truth is... bonding... it changes how you are.  I know that now.  This other guy... whether you want him to or not, he has an effect on you.  He's in here."  Tony tapped his head.  "We saw that in your simulation.  ...he came first.  He came before me.  And even if he treated you like crap, you love him.  I know.  I can feel it.  Like you said
Steve fell quiet again and leaned his side against the back of the couch, glancing around the eerily quiet workshop as he felt Tony's breathing slowly evening out alongside the pace of his own. "Do you think one of your suits would be stronger than me?" he asked curiously and abruptly, the thought popping into Steve's head; a convenient, and lighter, change of topic.
if you want to bond, or marry, or have kids, or adopt a three-legged dog, or buy a house up in Cape Cod with a white picket fence.  I don't give a damn.  But the moment that your partner is on the team, now it's an issue for SHIELD.  I need to know he can follow your orders, that your bond isn't going to create a problem for us on the battlefield.  You think HYDRA plays by the rules?  You think they're gonna respect the special little relationship you two have?  And, lastly, stop acting like it's the forties.  You think everyone's out to get you because you're an omega.  Well, I don't care, Cap.  Never have.  Not since I started the Avengers Initiative two years ago.  Stop acting like I'm against you just because I'm shoving some hard truths in your face."
Fury raised the eyebrow over his good eye, as if daring Steve to challenge him on any of these points.
He was confused about Fury wanting him to make contact with anyone in MI-13. Steve thought he was out of the game?  Why was SHIELD telling him to do anything anymore?
was twice his size.  Steve was huge and the idea of a regular person kicking his ass in a back alley was ludicrous.
The pair moved aside and let Tony in.  Sean looked him up and down.  Ill-fitted shirt, no socks or shoes, ridiculous bedhead.  "You've got it bad, huh?" he said, leading Tony into the kitchen.  "I thought you were coming over to kick my ass."
"Mac will be staying with four other agents," Nick explained to them. "If this is HYDRA, or another organization, they might try again. Those two are vulnerable for the next three days at least."
"Pressing the glands activates an artificial pre-heat.  I advise against any more mating as your pulse is currently 175," reported JARVIS.
"It's not a religious group.  We just use their facilities. It's free to attend and there's parking in the lot.  We run from nine to eleven."
"Yeah...yeah. Like in the next few weeks. Don't really know when. My metabolism makes it hard to predict."
When Tony was in his right mind he didn't talk much about it and there were no files on him anywhere; he refused to see a shrink and tended to avoid even regular doctors, which was part of the reason SHIELD had assigned Steve to tail him, because Tony was, for all his outlandish, outgoing behavior, a remarkably private person.
She seemed serious enough that Tony shut up and played quietly with the 1974 Expo model for the rest of the ride to his home.
"F-fuck..." Steve saw stars as Tony's teeth sank into his neck. His whole body was singing. He felt like he was on fire, an echo of their past mating but perhaps even more intense. He shuddered against him, squirming under his grip a little to test it but the Iron Man grip kept him down. A shiver trembled down his spine. "Tony. Tony he's-"
"Why did you call me?" Steve's voice was soft, gentle, and without accusation.  He frowned when he heard the smashing, the sounds of pain. Why was Tony doing this to himself? Steve kept the phone to his ear as he moved around his kitchen, setting the kettle on to boil.
Tony nipped Steve's lip at the sound of his name, but the words that followed were anything but sexy.
On the jet, Phil had just finished circling a few areas of interest on a map of Yemen when Tony cringed noticeably.
was with Pepper in the early 2000s.  She had never seen it and Tony had informed her, politely but firmly, that he could not have an assistant who had never seen
. Yeah, Howard had aged well. But the Howard Steve had left behind had been smooth skinned and handsome. He hadn't had wrinkles and greying hair. His voice had even sounded nicer. Or maybe Steve was just romanticising the past again. He was still distinctively
"I've always said exercise is stupid," said Tony wisely.  (Despite claiming to hate exercise, Tony was surprisingly active, though none of the sports he liked were ones Steve had never tried, such as kite surfing.)
He lapsed into silence when the waiter arrived with their drinks.  He served in order of dominance, having probably consulted someone else while getting their order.  Malick first, then Tony, then Steve. Malick eyed Tony's drinks warily, unused to anyone being brash enough to down six shots in front of him.
"Let's just go back to the room... I'm okay with spending the rest of the day just watching TV and ignoring my e-mails," said Tony.  Steve already knew that when Tony said "watch TV," he meant "tinker." The television was nothing more than background noise while Tony took things apart or examined schematics.  When the television was on, it usually meant Tony was feeling moody; he was more inclined to use hand tools instead of power tools when the television was on.
The silence spooled out but Tony didn't feel the least bit uncomfortable with it.  He felt like he and Steve understood each other perfectly as long as he was stroking Steve's face and Steve was pushing back against his hand.
Steve offered him a small but very real smile. He could tell he was tipsy but nearer tipsy rather than drunk. Hopefully Steve could get him to slow down after this.
Steve tried to keep his voice calm. What he had to say was important. "Bucky. Stop growling. I'm fine. You don't have to worry about me. Now, can you tell me where you are?"
"Bucky.  The Winter Soldier.  I gave Steve up so now he'd going back to his other mate.  All that bullshit about how I'm the only one... yeah. No. He's with Bucky right now.  Bucky's
"Captain America lived alone for over six months and discovered that sex toys were a lot more widely available than they used to be," Steve told him with a soft kind of smirk playing at his features.  "The serum makes me horny.  Can't help it." He leaned down to steal a quick kiss, sucking at Tony's bottom lip briefly. Suddenly they felt okay again,
"Honestly my neck hurts too much to feel other people's thoughts or emotions right now," Steve murmured. "And I don't know. Before... after HYDRA, I couldn't feel him even in the forties. It was like there was this empty space where a person had been. Even if I could technically feel him, that doesn't mean I'll actually
"Oh, yes, yes it does," agreed Richard pleasantly.  "But we're in the home stretch! You can swear if you like--"
"I'm allowed to drink before the simulation thingy, right?" asked Tony, eyeballing the bar in the front entrance as the two of them descended the curve of the main stairs together.  The orchid situation was predictably worse than before.  To prevent the main room from becoming too clogged, whoever had accepted the latest ones had begun putting them on the stairs; they lined the stairs, giving the impression that the orchids in the front room were multiplying and creeping toward their bedroom.  About half the counter space in the kitchen was taken up, and Tony hazarded a glance into the little-used dining room.  The table had been overtaken.  He made a mental note to get Pepper's and Rhodey's out as soon as possible so that they didn't get mixed up with all the others.  Those two were the only ones that were truly meaningful to him.  Had Happy sent one?  If so, that was all three of his friends, right there.  The rest of the flowers would have to go.
"Yeah, just... just... emotional, I guess.  Hormones," said Tony, shaking his head a little.  "...you missed the part where he introduces us to his little friend.  So.  How 'bout that blowjob?"  He gave Steve a little squeeze.  One of the things he liked about Steve was how much of them there was to hold.  A lot of the women Tony slept with were skeletal and Tony would never squeeze them for fear for cracking a rib.  Steve was solid.
"Thank you for your understanding," said Tony.  He looked a lot more serious than Steve had perhaps ever seen him.  "The specter of those weapons will probably haunt me for the rest of my life... that Ambassador IV undid in an instant all the good you've done for years."  (The refugee camp was for Tutsi refugees from Rwanda though it also had a number of Dinka from Sudan; Aria had tried to fill Steve in on current events but the problems of northeast Africa had proved too hard for her to easily explain and in the end she'd just sent him a few Wikipedia links.)
"How come you and Tony ended up together?  He's supposed to be a crazy playboy guy, isn't he?  And he's like, totally unhinged, and walks around in robot suit?" asked Five.  "Is he like your other Alpha?"
"Stevie, so help me God, if you make us late, I'll find a way to make you skinny again.  Rise and shine! You can't lay on that couch all day. Now, come on, I gotta girl to meet, you're gonna make me look bad."
He pulled the transcripts to the bottom; new words were appearing onscreen before them.  Steve leaned in to read; it was Clint and Fury who were talking.  JARVIS labeled the names: B for Barton, F for Fury.  Steve knew Clint well enough to tell, immediately, that Clint wasn't happy. Unlike Natasha, the man wasn't actually a big fan of taking risks. Steve knew that Clint was uneasy if he wasn't cracking jokes, even if it was Fury he was talking to. Or maybe he was less professional with Steve and around him on regular basis to try and make him feel more welcome and at ease; the archer was more considerate than he let on.  Or, maybe Clint was just friendlier with other omegas.  Still.  The uncharacteristic seriousness of the conversation made Steve worried.
Tony glanced up at Steve.  Steve was hovering close, but not too close.  Tony hesitated, then patted the seat beside him.  "Sit.  I won't bite."
"And it's hard not to take it personally, you know? It's so stupid... but it's not nice when people don't like you. Did I tell you that's how I knew about Sitwell? I didn't read or hear anything HYDRA related; the guy just hated me and I knew it. Well, I was like 70% sure. It was a well-placed guess.  But my point is, I'm not used to people not liking me.  And I'm trying to
"Oh! Yes, baby pictures," Peggy said, the thought suddenly returning to her. She reached for a very large box and opened the lid to reveal it was full of photo albums. "For you." She handed Tony a photo album from WWII, which was in fact full of pictures of Steve. And then she handed a different album to Steve himself. "Baby photos," Peggy affirmed, grinning.
?  It's not exactly the love story they're gonna wanna hear.  And I'm... I'm probably not the best guy to talk omega rights with.  I mean, I support them, I guess. I'm behind Steve all the way, but- but, you know, let's be honest, guys, I've got a lot of prejudices.  This will come as a surprise to you, but I'm not perfect."
He didn't even realize what was happening until Joey had pulled out a blade and begun sawing at the guy's wrist.
Poor Donner, who looked just like Steve, who was so small and cowed.  Who spoke in a soft, halting way, whose head was always ducked and shoulders always hunched.  Donner's only crime had been to check on some other omegas during the walk-out. Poor, gentle Donner hadn't walked out himself.  He'd only gone to speak with some others and said no to Gideon when called. And that one little word... that might have been his downfall.
"I gotta go, Tony," said Clint.  "You two... take it easy, okay? Just... don't close any doors.  There's not really a right way to be a parent, you know, you just try your best to love the hell out of your kids, and guide them, and--"
"I dropped him off about half an hour ago," Happy said and blinked, moving to open the car door on automatic, but he couldn't take his eyes off of Steve. "Should I take you to hospital, Captain?"
Bucky's eyes watered and his left hand clenched and unclenched, the gears inside it clicking softly.  "...yeah. I knew I'd probably never get to mate him. After we bonded, he got sick all over again. That was Stevie, always gettin' a fever.  If you sneezed at him or even look at him the wrong way, he'd be down for a week. I knew he was lousy omega but I just didn't care. It wasn't pity.  I loved him. ...and I thought that was enough."
Tony looked over.  Jasper Sitwell was leaning against the balcony, smoking a cigarette.  Tony frowned and inched away, hating the smell.
It was ludicrous, of course.  Steve was the last guy in the world who needed to be protected; he was huge. And Tony wasn't really that kind of Alpha.  Not usually, anyway.  He could easily imagine fighting Natasha (and undoubtedly losing) on Steve's behalf.
. Steve hesitantly stepped forward, as if he wouldn't be welcome in his very own apartment. Tony evidently didn't feel welcome anymore. "You do know why I don't want to tell Nat and Clint, right?" he asked and raised a brow.
"Soon, everyone will know the truth.  That Stark men are not made of iron.  That the Stark legacy is built with fog, and mirrors.  It take your father forty years to ruin me.  It take me... forty minutes."
He was reminded again that Tony didn't know about Clint's family. He (probably selfishly) wished he could tell Tony. There was a point of no return, Steve had warned Clint. If he left it too late Tony really would be hurt. He'd try and pretend he wasn't, but he would be. And Steve hated keeping big secrets from his mate.
. It's just this... this hot, homey mess.  If your smell were a painting, it'd be a Normal Rockwell. Seriously.  You're so...
"Well, this is our first heat together, this might be the yooj.  I don't know yet. I'm hoping it's not, though. Anyway, he punched a hole in the wall, I smashed an orchid over his head, he grabbed my throat, said some more Russian garbage, then just sorta passed out.  Right now I've got the Mark 6 holding him down. It would actually be pretty delightfully kinky if I weren't scared for my life."
"I want this washed, salved, and bandaged up," Kate announced. "And then the cut on his temple needs some tape. And someone clean up Mr. Stark, please. He's covered in blood and I need to know how much is his own."
He was acting weird, feeling weird... he didn't know why.  Could it be the new arc reactor core, screwing with his brain somehow?  An after-effect of Steve's heat?  Tony had never spent a morning like this with anyone.  These were uncharted waters.
JARVIS was not the only one who was immune to the seeming impulsiveness of Tony's questions and demands.  Pepper had long-since gotten used to it.  And the agent she'd recommended to Steve, Aria, was another woman who, used to juggling the requests of eccentric celebrities, had ceased to question them.  She'd admitted to Pepper that Steve was an easy client because he was polite, reasonable, and agreeable.  His lack of knowledge about modern technology was a small price to pay considering his overall general respectfulness.
.  And the Winter Soldier program... well.  Someone has to say it. Might as well be me.  I think he's too close to this."
Steve managed a smile, but anyone who knew him well enough would see that it didn't meet his eyes. "Something like that."
," Steve whispered. "I'm begging you. We just want to help. This place is shutting down anyway; you probably won't have a job to come back to, so don't worry about getting into trouble."
Sitwell cringed noticeably.  "Not much fazes you, does it?" he said to Pepper, sounding slightly annoyed at her unflappability.
Maybe it was just all of the alcohol but Steve was feeling extremely uncomfortable.  He didn't like how the two centuries were colliding.  It was confusing and upsetting.
"...let me mate you," he murmured.  "Let me mate you again, on the floor, on the hood of a car, I don't care... fuck, Steve... you smell so good... my omega, my beautiful omega.... I love you... I need to be inside you again..."
There was something about Dr. Martin... Steve just simply didn't trust her.  Maybe because she was an unbounded Alpha? Maybe because he'd just liked Kate from last night?  Maybe because he was tuned in to Tony's protective aggression? He knew it was unfair, but he just... didn't like her like he had Dr. McCloud. He didn't like it when she inspected his burns near his more intimate areas and commented on the lower possibility of scarring. When she handed him painkillers for his ribs, he told her they wouldn't work but took them anyway.
Steve took his collar off in the elevator and didn't know where to put it. But it felt good his neck to finally
"You know," said Richard, pleasantly, "epidurals can be administered to the neck to help lower hackles.  ...it's not really good for the muscles in the back of the neck to keep them raised that long."
Before Steve could give any attention to the girl yelling at him Tracy pulled him into another dance. This was one was too familiar. He didn't like it. "Hey, hey...Steve! You okay?" Tracy asked, half yelling in his face.
"Ohhhh," said Tony.  "I thought she was a stagehand.  ...can you find me a stagehand and get me a drink?"
"Erik told me.  He was extremely interested in talking with you and Banner about it.  Thought we could have a little think tank together."
Against the wall, Pepper watched with a sigh.  "...I feel like I'm chaperoning a high school dance."
"Be nice to Beth.  She's a good person to have on security detail and considering all the shit you put her through, she's really going above and beyond for you and Steve.  ...and try not to drink another six shots in front of her. She's not comfortable with your drinking, especially after how you were in the nineties."
"...now that Bucky's in cryo... you won't... you won't go back to him again, right?  You'll stay with me now?" asked Tony, breaking up his reverie.  Tony didn't add that he couldn't shake the feeling of failure from their failed mating.  That he'd love to go to town, but that the gland on Steve's neck had such an awful taste... it was like Steve's body was trying to sabotage them.
Tony heard his name and the tone of desperation in his omega's voice, but that was it.  He couldn't process the meaning of the words. He only knew Steve was begging and he knew what for, and he felt frustrated that he couldn't give it to him.
He swallowed and looked over.  Steve was standing there.  Steve, the omega Tony desperately, desperately wanted to be good enough for.
Tony's mind was churning through all these various thoughts like a runaway train, thinking about his lack of dominance and how that had made Steve's body choose Bucky over him, and everything that had happened in Afghanistan, and how Steve had been so much better in Yemen, so much stronger, even as an omega...
Clint was on a lunch break and was currently consuming an entire pack of rainbow chocolate chip cookies for lunch. He was leaning against a balcony rail outside and then he felt his phone buzz in his pocket.
Steve wasn't sure what to do with his hands; the photographers hollered out suggestions.  Some made sense to him ("Now drag your fingers through the paint!") and others, not so much ("Now give me some bedroom eyes!")  Mostly, he just tried to not look awkward or to second-guess letting them paint a flag on his stomach.
Even the fireworks sounded far away, and the party was barely there, a thrum of music echoing at the back of Steve's mind. The soft sound of gentle waves stole his attention, that and the pale glow of the mood across the water's surface and the sand. Steve was excited. He was beyond that. He looked elated when he turned to kiss Tony's forehead. "Pretty neat," he agreed in a hum and tugged on Tony's hand, bringing them closer to the waves.
Sam crossed his arms.  "The guy's a pain in the ass, but let's take a step back.  You run missions with Barton. I was partnered to my wingman.  I don't think it's an issue. We've all been personally involved in missions and we've all been fine.  SHIELD approved him for combat so he's ready for combat. As long as we can turn of the comms so that we don't have to listen to him, I think he's a valuable asset, well worth having around.  And I think we're all gonna benefit from seeing how he does in the field."
Tony grinned back at her.  "Listen, babe, go get me another drink before Rogers gets off the phone.  Make it a double.  ...he's not crazy about how much I drink."
"Oh.  ...then pull over right here, stop stop stop, right there, there's a Panda Buffet, run in and get me a fortune cookie!"
"I... I want to put it on you," said Tony.  It was almost a question. Because Tony was pretty sure he'd always feel guilty for liking it, no matter how many times Steve assured Tony he wasn't at all like "the others."
"What do you want to know, about, erm..." It was like he was afraid to say it. Like they would find him if he did. Rex looked almost afraid. It reminded Steve of that Voldermort thing in the Harry Potter books.  People being scared of saying a name in case the thing found them. (Steve had loved those books. He tore through them in two weeks.  He hadn't sleep much during.)
He wasn't sure how long they were like that; they weren't making out, exactly, but both their mouths were moving; it was passionate but also intimate and Tony could happily continued to explore Steve's lips and mouth, his fingertips brushing over Steve's skin and the fabric of his shirt.
Tony let out a noise (it wasn't a word, wasn't anything but a sound of agreement) and reached between them to wrap his hand around Steve's cock.  It was awkward, trying to jack him off, the two of them still stuck together, but Tony found it, found Steve's shaft and began stroking, working the foreskin back and forth over the head, rolling his thumb over the head.  Steve was smooth and wet with precum and Tony's spit and his cock worked easily in Tony's hand; Steve was bucking under him, fucking his hand, Tony's own dick still buried in him, and both of them were making inhuman sounds of enjoyment.
"Hi, my name is Richard Emmett. A guy named Eric recommended you to me at the conference, yeah--" He paused to laugh. "I'm looking for something really specific and I was told you are
But Tony dragged him out of his own thoughts when his fingers brushed near that sweet spot behind Steve's ear. He failed to repress a shiver. "Tony," he said in warning, because Rhodey was in the room. But then he gave him a kiss him anyway, firm but brief. "Right. That's all you're getting, mister."
Steve blinked back to the present. "Maybe another time," he murmured. Two graveyards in one visit would definitely put a downer on the trip. "Pepper said we don't have anything for tomorrow, but stuff the day after. So we can just laze about, whatever you want." He turned to face him and saw Tony's expression. He reached up and brushed dark hair away from the other's eyes.
Steve leaned his head on his shoulder. It was comfortable like this and he almost missed having a partner that was taller than him. With Tony he had to half curl in on himself, or slide down to put his head on his shoulder. This was comfortable, or would be, if he wasn't starving and locked up.
He leaned down and began licking the knot and Steve's entrance; above him he could hear Steve making a series of undignified noises of pleasure.  He drew back (Steve's balls brushed his face) and gave it another push. Slowly, achingly, he could feel Steve's body giving, the knot easing into him.
Steve was honestly so tired he just dropped down onto the sheets. He could catch up with the news once they'd landed. Right now he was in bed and he couldn't bear the thought of tearing himself out of it.
"You can do this," Steve told him as Tony's gaze finally landed on his face, recognising the other person in the room. He drew his hand back from his shoulder, still on one knee in front of him, almost in an echo of old omega manners from the forties. But Steve didn't kneel for just anyone. "I didn't survive a plane crash and being frozen for 70 years to wake up to all my friends dead or dying to watch you die too, Tony Stark." His words wavered in the air. They were Captain's words, not to be messed with. They carried
"I do," said Dr. McDermott.  "But I have a fellowship with UCLA right now to investigate a new type of birth control for omegas.  ...by the way, Captain, Rex and I were quite happy with your Project 84. I've always advocated against conversion therapy, you know.  If any of your... contacts... well, if they need... reconstructive help, I would be happy to donate some of my time. My mate, you know... he was from Pine Hills."
