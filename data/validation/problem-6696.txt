‘I would have thought you’d enjoy having Peter on your team next time, Buck,’ he tries to joke back.
‘Well obviously you haven’t been as much of a jerk to them as you are to me,’ Steve says, trying to keep his friend’s spirits high. ‘Kind of a feat considering you took all the stupid with you.’
‘And now,’ the Headmaster returns to the microphone, ‘we have a history presentation from Peter Parker. Come on up, Peter.’
‘Maybe,’ comes the small reply. ‘Stewart’s nephews were over and they were being horrible ‘cause I wouldn’t drink with them ‘cause I’m not old enough, and neither are
‘Give me a second, Steve,’ Tony says, leaning forwards as FRIDAY gives him what he asked for; he scans everything until the moment Peter walks through the door, then he presses pause. ‘You see what I see?’
Before Tony can intervene Peter’s darted in front of the advancing assassin and put himself between him and the mercenary. His arm is out, hand up in the universal gesture for ‘stop’. The atmosphere in the room has suddenly gone tense.
‘It was brought up when Natasha found out you were in New York, not everyone was familiar with you so she gave them a brief run down: career in the military, then working as a mercenary up to the Weapon-X programme, and back to being a merc after you… well after you…’
‘Well I made it out to be an accident, which it kind of was, cause see it was Flash knocked the other chemical over and it spilt into the drawer I was using and then everything went boom. So I said I’d been keeping it down there so I didn’t accidentally combine the two things we weren’t supposed to mix.’
arguing.’ With that he speeds off towards the bulky looking alien. ‘Heads up, tough guy, let’s see what you’re- oomph!’
you, Baby Boy; and I don’t need your super-sister’s freaky mind powers to know what you’re thinking at least
‘Come on,’ he says, tugging his friend along. ‘Sam’s going to come back and get us. We just need to keep out of-’ He stops with a grunt of pain as something sharp catches him in the neck. He puts a hand to his neck and pulls out a dart.
‘I couldn’t even tell Rhodey everything I was feeling,’ Tony sniffs. ‘No one knew about us, Steve, how could I explain how much it hurt that you left me there and walked away with someone else when no one knew what we were to each other?’
‘Oh yeah,’ she blinks, seemingly only just realising the group of people he’s walked in with. ‘Hey everyone. Shuri from Wakanda. Nice to meet you. See you around, I need to steal this boy from you for a bit. Bye!’
He’d punched his friend on the shoulder for the comment but the first part is striking a chord right now. Is he really just using this an excuse? He knows he likes Tony. Who wouldn’t? The guy was stunning, one of the funniest people Steve had ever met, generous to a fault, and incredibly intelligent. Not to mention one of the most frustrating people in the world to try and keep safe.
‘We’ve lost enough choices recently,’ he explains, ‘the least we can do is choose who leads us. But anyway,’ he waves his hand, ‘we’ve got a couple of days to think about it. Hopefully this’ll make other people more willing to help, even if they don’t officially join the team, when shit hits the fan.’
Peter takes Wanda to meet Wade at Sister Margaret's. Whilst there some people turn up looking for Wade, and Peter asks him a little more about his past.
‘That’s the one,’ Tony says, aware of the obvious pride in his voice. ‘Stole Cap’s shield and managed to tie you up on his first day out with the team.’
They settle back down, with his head resting on Steve’s chest again, and Tony has to marvel at how happy he is to just lie in bed not doing anything. It doesn’t take his brain long to ruin his new-found peace by reminding him of the situation facing them. ‘Steve? Do you think we’re doing the right thing? Having Wade and Loki here I mean.’
‘I like you. Why couldn’t you have dated her instead of the madman you insist to inflict on us all?’ Loki asks him.
Natasha frowns at him, but Bucky catches her eyes and shakes his head. ‘Fine,’ she sighs, ‘but I reserve the right to stab you later if I find out you’ve been keeping something dangerous from us.’
Fury falls asleep and Strange decides to bow out, already at the stage where he has to stay at the facility rather than risk a portal back to the Sanctum. The Cloak carries him to his room as Wade fireman lifts Fury to his. By the time he gets back T’Challa has also decided to bow out and preserve his dignity, though his sister is showing no signs of doing the same..
Tony’s about to retort when there’s static over the speakers in the prison. ‘Looks like they’ve got things back on line,’ Natasha comments, ‘maybe we can go home soon.’
Karen gives him instructions which he relays to the mercenary and they make their way along the rooftops to where the voices are coming from a side alley. They look down and Peter, with his enhanced hearing, doesn’t need Karen to make the voices clearer, despite them talking low. He does get her to record what they’re saying.
‘I’d be willing to bet,’ Sam says with a grin at Tony, ‘that he manages to get everyone before the challenge is over.’
‘I’ll wound you properly if you don’t stop eating all the sliced fruit,’ Valkyrie mutters. ‘And leave my mead alone!’
‘Yeah, yeah, whatever,’ the raccoon looks back over the trees. ‘I caught Sam and Quill making their way here. Not seen anyone else yet though.’
‘Oh good now there’s two of them,’ Okoye mutters, casting a look at her king out of the corner of her eye.
‘Tony, Steve and Nat are getting hold of people and seeing what their plans are,’ she tells him, ‘hopefully they’ll have answers by the time we get back.’
Loki is trying not to feel smug as he walks along the corridors of the facility, having left a slightly gaping Scott behind him. He’s still chuckling as he meets Wanda, coming out of her room.
Loki gives a long suffering sigh. ‘He decided to accept Valkyrie’s challenge to a drinking contest. There’s plenty on the stove if anyone else needs some.’
‘You’d be surprised, Steve,’ Tony says with a smile. ‘If your friend hasn’t had a visit from Stark Industries within the week call the office and ask for Tony from R&D.’
‘But you’ve not killed anyone in New York since we started hanging out,’ Peter argues. ‘Well,’ he turns away from the merc as he remembers, ‘except for that one time anyway.’
Tony pulls away slightly so he can look up at him; his face is more relaxed than Steve has seen it in a while. ‘Yeah,’ he replies, voice just as soft and sounding a little surprised. ‘Yeah, I’m…’
‘What now?’ Steve grumbles to himself as he leaves his room to answer Rumlow’s summons. When he reaches the living room the rest of the squad are there, all in their dress uniforms. Sam shoots him a warning look to play nice and keep his cool. He’s right he can’t afford to lose his temper and risk letting Rumlow know of his plan.
‘So, what is it?’ Bruce asks. ‘I mean I know what is it for people here on Earth, but what is it for you? Sounds like a big thing.’
‘Aww don’t tell me you’ve forgotten me already,’ she teases him. ‘What’s up Big Guy you wanted to join in the game?’
‘Yes.  But there are more than two trillion neurons here. One misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures. It will take time, brother.’
stupid. Peter had warned her about that tone. He’d also warned her there was no talking him out of whatever plan he had, you just had to roll with it and hope for the best.
‘Don’t sir me, kid, I know I’m old but I’m not in charge,’ he grins, ‘if you’re serious about wanting to join the army contact our facility first and ask to be referred to me, alright? If you want to fight come do it with a team that will watch your back, we always needs good people to help.’
‘Hey Tony, why did Steve tell me I needed to put my mask on? I mean it’s actually really lucky I have one here that I could find easily because he didn’t exactly give me a lot of warning and-’ Peter breaks off as he reaches the bottom of the stairs and sees the person standing behind Tony. ‘Wha-’
He shrugs. ‘I may have been a little more…thorough than with many others. I couldn’t resist the opportunity to tease him in the future.’
‘Well that was weird,’ Tony says as the two wizards disappear into the portal and it closes behind them. ‘He’s not going to keep opening portals in here is he? I’m not sure I can take it.’
‘Thor leave him alone, you’re not going to be helping his recovery if you’re winding him up,’ Tony sighs, rubbing his temples.
‘You could open it out a little more as well,’ she continues. ‘Like we discussed doing. Instead of just for emergency services you can open it out to other people or companies that have done their bit to help their communities. There’s a guy I read about who’s just about to do his twelfth marathon in a year, and he’s done a different charity each time. And there’s a law firm in New York that don’t take money from their less wealthy clients. That’s just the top ones on my list.’
Scott shakes his head. ‘I need to look after Cassie; they might go after her and I can’t risk that.’
Peter leans around his teacher and takes out his pass from his pocket, handing it through the window to the guard. ‘Will this do?’
‘Oh yeah! Sorry babe,’ he grins apologetically and pulls a disc from his armour, placing it on Steve’s chest and waiting for the dark armour to cover the blond.
‘Can we eat now? I’m starving!’ Peter complains. ‘I know I definitely had bigger portions than May and Stewart, but I’ve definitely got used to eating more here.’
Tony shrugs. ‘Sometimes they only want my wonderful presence once a week. Sometimes it can be every day. When we were working to get you all back it was a lot more regular.’
‘What?!?’ Peter shouts, nearly jumping out of Wade’s grip as everyone laughs and turns back to what they were saying. ‘Why would you do that?’
‘Right well let’s see if I can make some space for you guys to crawl through or something. You got any room to move stuff your side?’
She wraps an arm around his waist. ‘Not letting us look out for you, little brother. And not thinking you’re good enough.’
There’s another sniff on the end of the phone and when Peter starts talking again his voice is filled with tears. ‘I don’t think he loves me.’
‘I’m actually proud of you,’ Natasha laughs, ‘that’s some, as Tony would say, “sneaky spy shit” worthy of Fury.’
‘As Peter has not so eloquently put,’ Natasha smirks at the teen, ‘Wade has already put in rules to their relationship because he’s underage. You’ll probably be surprised at how responsible he’s being about the whole thing.’
‘Merry Christmas everyone!’ Clint yells as he and his family enter the common area, the kids running up to give Natasha a hug with shouts of greeting.
‘You guys want breakfast?’ Tony asks them, trying and probably failing miserably to keep the grin off of his face. He’d even managed to keep this a surprise from Steve.
‘Tony’s always been self-destructive,’ Rhodes sighs. ‘But especially when he thinks he’s got something to repair.’ No one says anything more for a few minutes before Sam and Bucky head off to bed. Steve remains where he is, mulling over their resident inventor.
It was the line Tony always used on him that made his resolve crumble and had him dancing to any tune the inventor wanted to play. Every protest and argument he has against this dies on his lips as Tony pulls him forwards into another kiss, and those talented fingers find their way under the fabric of his shirt. His name falls from Steve’s lips like a prayer and a plea at the same time, and he lets Tony pull his shirt over his head.
No one is quick enough to stop Thanos putting the glowing yellow stone into the gauntlet as Vision’s lifeless body is thrown to the ground, the colour completely drained from his form. Thor, however, is quick enough to launch himself at Thanos with his axe, trying to take the Titan’s head off.
‘Yeah they said Cap would never have survived without you to take out the people he was too busy catching his Frisbee to notice.’
He nods again and then smiles. ‘You know you will not be able to harm me, Wanda. Why don’t we try now whilst most of the team are out and if you do over reach yourself it’s not going to hurt anyone?’
‘We need more ground people,’ Natasha adds. ‘Tony and Rhodes are both air based, and the same can be argued with Vision.’
Tony is down in his workshop the next morning before everyone else is awake when he hears a knock on the door.
Tony barely notices as the two of them leave, but thinks he manages a wave in their direction. He’s jolted back into the present as Sam comes to sit at the bench opposite him.
‘Well he just seemed more...together? Less bat-shit insane? Didn’t talk to himself as much? Any of this ringing bells?’
Perversely it was Venom who had helped the most. The first night, when everyone else had gone to bed, the Symbiote had detached itself from Peter whilst he sat in Wade’s infirmary room. ‘I sssshall take my leave,’ Venom hissed at him.
‘What the hell are you playing at, Deadpool?’ he demands, letting go of the web and climbing down the wall another couple of feet so he doesn’t have to shout.
Peter starts up the large staircase, looking at everything on the shelves on the way up as he goes, though he doesn’t dare touch anything for fear of breaking it. ‘Man I can’t wait to ask the Doc what half of this stuff is,’ he mutters to himself. ‘Now,’ he reaches the top and looks along the corridor, ‘at least I don’t have two choices, so straight on it is. Hey, Doc? Doctor Strange, you here? It’s Peter! Peter Parker.’
‘Can you tell him to hurry?’ Steve asks. ‘We’re already running late and I don’t want to encourage Tony to drive faster than normal.’
‘Yeah like that’s going to help him stay calm,’ he can practically hear the eye roll in Tony’s voice. There’s a brief pause before the inventor adds. ‘We went through what happened when I woke up in Afghanistan, before I became Iron Man.’ He turns his stool around and comes to make a few last adjustments. ‘I woke up with a magnet in the middle of my chest, and the knowledge that if it was removed the shrapnel that was trying to make its way to my heart would kill me.’ He hands Bucky a set of glasses. ‘Put these on, Barnes, it’ll project what we need to see into the room. There’s sensors in the arms that will latch onto the memory once you start it, if you need to stop at any time just take them off. We’ve got you in the chair simply because it’s a better height for Wanda and Vision to work at. Any questions?’
Loki sighs, looks down the table to make sure that Thor isn’t going to overhear them and then turns back to her. ‘It’s not that I don’t enjoy Yule,’ he answers her unasked question, ‘but I always got pulled into the more ceremonial side of things and didn’t always get the chance to take part in the celebrations that I wanted to. So for me, memories of Yule are also tied up with memories of duties performed.’
‘I just want to go out for a couple of hours,’ he’s now sat in the doctor’s office trying to convince him to let him go and see Peter give a presentation at his school. ‘
‘Careful Steve,’ Pepper grins at him, ‘the mood he’s in he’ll convince you to go on a date if you aren’t careful.’
He reaches out and places a hand on Tony’s shoulder, feeling the man relax under his touch. ‘I’m sorry I hurt you, Tony.’
A few of them seem to nod in acceptance. ‘Very well, if you do not have any questions or any more concerns, then we can conclude this meeting,’ the British representative says.
fucking morals. I mean usually they’re shit ones I’ll give you that, but I’m not moving on this. Peter you asked me if this was a date and I would absolutely
Sharon gives a harsh laugh. ‘Of course. You just can’t admit when you actually care about people can you?’ she accuses him. ‘Isn’t that how all this mess started in the first place? You can’t admit you care and you can’t admit you were wrong, and that’s how all the mess with the Accords started. That’s how you tore apart the team in the first place!’
Peter’s eyes, if possible, go even wider. ‘Oh god no! Why would you think that? Eww I really don’t want to be thinking about that and May and… can we just not?’ He gives a shudder and then refocuses. ‘No it’s… well see May’s started seeing someone and it seems to be going really well, which is good because he seems like a nice guy and that’s not the problem at all but… well see she either goes to his on the weekends when I’m here, or he comes to ours on the other weekends.’
‘He’s also tried to make everyone rethink Bucky’s role in the team,’ Sam points out. ‘He’s trying to reinstate the war-hero image from the exhibition, rather than the Hydra weapon the media’s been fixating on.’
‘Call for help,’ she says to a woman standing not far from her as she tries to lift the load higher, looking around she spies the park they passed only a few minutes ago and starts to lift it over there. Vision appears next to her. ‘Can you make sure there’s a free space for me to drop this?’ she asks him.
‘Why? It’s only a couple of months, and if I hadn’t been caught in the snap I would be in my twenties by now,’ he argues.
The evening has been entertaining to say the least. Peter watches, grinning to himself, as Steve continues to scold Bucky; the Winter Soldier had tried to sneak him some alcohol to try, but Steve had caught them before Peter had been able to take a sip.
Progress on the Christmas story is slow at the moment, but I should have something to post next Monday. As to this one, I'm probably going to do a couple of updates this week and next week as I have more chapters than weeks to update!
‘Last time I checked. Unless you want to get into the whole “evil demon dream” theory of reality. Does this mean we can call this a date now?’
‘Err… what just happened?’ Wade asks, blinking in surprise. Tony huffs a laugh and fills him in, the mercenary jumping out from under the mistletoe like it was about to set him on fire. He glares at Bucky. ‘Come near me and mistletoe and I’ll rip your arm off.’
Pepper chuckles. ‘As I said I spend more than enough time with Tony as it is. Besides he organised the SI donation and made it clear that if I didn’t choose to dance with you he’d fire me.’
‘I think I’m with Nat on this one,’ Steve says, eyes sparkling with mischief. ‘Thinking about it, I owe him a bit of embarrassment.’
‘Peter,’ May sighs, and seems to have an internal struggle for a minute. ‘Peter I need you to look at me.’ When he pulls back he can see unshed tears in his aunt’s eyes, and what seems to be guilt swimming in them. ‘We didn’t tell you at the time, we were going to when you broke up for summer because we didn’t want it to affect your school but… Peter, Ben was about to retire from the Force on grounds of ill health.’
‘He’s been acting a little strange lately though,’ she muses, ‘I’m wondering if he’s under a bit too much stress with work, but he won’t admit anything to me.’
‘Scott Lang’s just turned up in a cab, boss. Captain Rogers and Mr Wilson have already gone to meet him.’
‘That’s the thing about kidnappers, they look like normal people. So if you aren’t here to kidnap someone I guess you’re here to gate crash?’
There’s some polite applause as Rhodes takes to the stage. Steve admires how calm the soldier looks. ‘Thank you. Good evening everyone. I must admit when I was asked to give this speech tonight I did initially think Tony had finally lost it,’ there’s a murmur of polite laughter. ‘I mean we all know he’s much better in front of the press than I am. And then I looked at who had been invited to attend tonight and I felt extremely privileged. The guest list includes members of the police, fire and ambulance service here in New York, as well as staff members from the emergency departments. We’ve got veterans and serving soldiers. And we’ve also got members of faith communities, volunteer organisations, and local companies who have done something to give back to the community.
‘This is all what we’d have to build up gradually and would vary on each site,’ Nick agrees. ‘Some bases could be combat centres, others research, and even others focussing mainly on intelligence and each one would need a slight variation on protocol should the worst happen.’
Before he can ask what the inventor means, the door in front of them opens and a young man gestures them forwards. ‘Mr Stark, Captain Rogers? They’re ready for you.’
‘I thought you didn’t approve of using the Time Stone on such matters? Considering you nearly took my head off when I experimented on an
‘I’ve a question for you, Peter, which I meant to ask when you gave this presentation in class,’ the woman is evidently Peter’s history teacher. ‘Why did you decide to choose Sergeant Barnes as your project? What was it about his story that appealed to you?’
He really does mean to answer Sam’s question first, perhaps bring the conversation round to Mr Harris’ announcement. He really does. Instead, what comes out of his mouth is: ‘Why did no one tell me my school is coming up here for a few days?’
get drunk, therefore you’d be cheating,’ the teenagers rolls his eyes at his boyfriend’s continued arguments.
Because if there’s one thing he’s determined to do by the end of tonight, it’s to give Tony Stark a piece of his mind.
A/N: Hello everyone! Sorry I'm at the later end of when I usually update this week, it's been a bit of a crazy week and I didn't get chance to update on Friday night like I usually do. I hope you enjoyed this chapter, and seeing some of the 'Rogues' stepping up to help Tony.
Even Tony can tell Thor’s optimism is forced, Loki’s expression is strained. ‘Are you certain you do not want us to come with you?’ the trickster asks again.
‘Good. See you in the morning, Wilson.’ Then he does something that has the mercenary blinking back tears: he pulls him into a brief hug, before rejoining his boyfriend and heading towards their room.
‘Let’s hope they’re not as enthusiastic as he is about Pop Tarts,’ Natasha says with a smile as they’re joined by Wanda and Vision.
‘Alright stop!’ Steve shouts. ‘Go with Deadpool’s plan. You two take out the convoy, then come back and help if you want. We’ll focus on getting Tony out. Rhodey? Give Clint a lift over to the rooftop opposite the entrance.’
because he’ll want to show how much he managed to pull the wool over my eyes. Come on, Nat, you’ll be there with me. Steve can wait outside the whole time. Fifteen minutes that’s all I ask.’
‘Its fine, Thor,’ Steve smiles at him, ‘besides this sounds like it’s going to be a lot of fun. Not that we’ll be doing it
‘You say you haven’t really thought much about how your extra sense works, Peter,’ Steve ignores the others and starts to explain, ‘so we need to start looking into it. If something happens and you can’t trust your other senses then this might be the only thing you can rely on.’
‘Nope, it was a rather boring day overall. Fantasised about blowing Hammer’s head off a couple of times, I have the perfect spot if you ever want that option by the way.’
Peter glances up at Matt, who just frowns at him. Taking a gamble he reaches up to touch his ear piece, turning on the speech ability. ‘I’m here Mr Stark, sorry I was helping one of the lawyers to the bathroom,’ Matt pauses in his rush towards him. ‘Which one’s the blind one again?’
‘High maintenance,’ Steve mutters and comes to join him on the sofa. ‘How much has he annoyed you?’ he asks Natasha.
‘Well you seemed so determined to get the arc reactor back to being a permanent feature,’ Hammer says, taking the only seat in his cell and putting his feet on the bed, ‘I just
He’s not sure how long he’s on the rooftop when he hears footsteps behind him. He doesn’t need to turn to see who it is.
Peter’s excited shout and Wanda’s big smile are all the answer he needs. ‘I think you’re taking after her with your sentimental ways,’ Natasha teases him, and he just scowls at her. As he passes Steve to follow the two youngest members to the kitchenette he gives the soldier’s shoulder a squeeze. ‘Thanks, Cap.’
‘I don’t sulk,’ Tony says, trying not to pout and pretty sure he fails at Wanda’s amused smile. ‘Anyway I’m the one who makes all the gear and everyone look cool so you better keep looking at it all like it’s the best thing since sliced bread or your projects are getting moved to the back of the list.’
‘When Tony was a kid he didn’t have the best relationship with his dad, but he told me one drunken night at MIT that the one thing they would be able to bond over was when Howard would tell him stories about you.’
‘Seen any sign of who staged this? An explosion that big? Right when we’re turning up. It can’t be coincidence,’ she asks.
‘Kid breathe,’ Mr Stark chuckles, gesturing him forwards. ‘I’m messing with you. Who’s your friend?’
He tries some breathing exercises that Frigga had taught him when he first started learning magic to calm his racing mind, but his thoughts were in such turmoil that he wasn’t even able to pinpoint what was causing him such distress. Raising a hand in front of him he starts creating small ice sculptures in his palm, bringing the ice back into his veins to create another one. He finds it finally helps to calm his mind so that, when a knock comes on his door, he is not quite as irritated as he perhaps should have been.
it’s a woman, flies down glowing with some kind of weird light and takes the gauntlet from Sam, flying through the Chitauri gliders as if they were nothing but paper screens, and lands in front of Wanda. When the light fades her blonde hair falls down around her shoulders and she holds out the gauntlet. ‘Looking for this?’
‘Next time you have him on the run up to Christmas,’ she replies, ‘he’s had to promise to repaint the walls
An answering smirk creeps onto her lips and she moves to the speaker on the side of the wall. Pressing the button so her voice will carry throughout the facility she gives Tony a wink and says: ‘Avengers assemble!’
He waves her off. ‘Wasn’t doing nothing I can’t do here. Now go bring our team back, Romanov. That’s an order.’
, Peter muses, knowing that Mr Stark wants him to keep up with the reports. He’s not entirely sure why, seeing as he’s technically off the ‘training wheels’ program; but he enjoys the chance to reflect on what he’s managed to achieve.
‘Of course!’ August falls into step next to Loki, with Tony on his other side, and the three of them lead them towards the dig. ‘I’ve already given instructions for lights to be brought in but if you need more do let me know.’
‘In a way,’ he agrees. ‘But I think our young Parker may be of more use than the team would have us believe. I think if we have a situation come up during this Accords business, then we need to utilise the newest member of the team and let the others focus on the bigger battle.’
‘Yeah, new kid, I am,’ Flash turns his attention to Harry. ‘And if you want my advice on getting by in this school-’
‘Yeah that spread like wildfire,’ the man chuckles, ‘and something is telling me that you’re about to say things are more serious than you led the others to believe.’
‘Might want to give them a wave, Spidey,’ he suggests, voice quiet ‘otherwise they’ll wonder why their friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man isn’t being overly friendly.’
Wanda works on improving her control of her power; and the team gets called into a hostage situation with a familiar face.
‘I assume she’s magically drained?’ Loki asks from where he’s leaning against a wall behind the other three.
‘Wade Wilson get your arse in here and try these on,’ he throws a few pairs of suit trousers at the man and then goes to look at Steve’s shirts.
The hands holding him under are becoming more solid, more real. He’s losing strength, but he needs to get away. Needs to
‘Seriously?’ Wade says. ‘You just said you kept a list of anyone who is a threat to this world and you don’t fucking know who Thanos is?’
‘You stay there and let Wanda help you, buddy,’ Tony reassures him. ‘I’m going to wait here until you two are heading back to make sure the ugly goblin over there doesn’t take any more of an interest in you.’
‘Don’t be ridiculous, Clint, it’s just a farmhouse. I’m talking about cyber protection. Thing was like the equivalent of a Fort Knox inside a Fort Knox inside a Wakandan Embassy,’ Shuri interrupts.
A/N: Hi everyone! Thank you so much for all the continued support you guys are absolutely incredible and I love you all. I hope you enjoy this chapter as much as the previous ones, we're definitely on the home straight for this story now. Please let me know what you think of this chapter, and as always if you have any requests for stories or scenes then let me know.
Needless to say by the time T’Challa arrives in the suite, Loki and Thor following, and suggests they stop for dinner everyone’s tempers are a little worse for wear.
‘I’m glad you like him,’ Bucky smiles. ‘After the story you told me about Fenrir, I saw the litter a couple of days later and thought he’d be perfect.’
‘They’ll be fine,’ Sam reassures him. ‘Takes more than a couple of soldiers to bring down Tony and Peter.’
‘Peter,’ he offers his hand with a small smile. ‘I’m one of the Stark Interns. I was wondering if Mr Murdock is available? I really need to speak him.’
A/N: Hi everyone! I hope you enjoy this update, thank you so much to everyone who has left comments and kudos - I'm glad no one at the moment is annoyed with how long it's taken for Steve and Tony to get together. I was starting to worry it was taking too long I must admit.
Well ain’t that the truth? Just not in the way Peter was insinuating; because after play passes to the teenager and Wade is having to watch him bend over to take the shot he was
‘Trust that jackass to be the root of yet another problem,’ he groans, trying to ignore the knot of unease in his stomach. The recording Peter had sent him the other day flashes through his mind.
Peter’s eyes go wide and he scrambles out of Wade’s arms and out the door. ‘Bye Wade see you later!’
‘One of many,’ she smiles at the alien as the team fill in the Guardians with their normal Christmas plans.
Main reason: I want to put a bullet in between that son of a bitch’s eyes and watch the life drain out of him. No fucking mistakes this time.
Sometimes Natasha takes him for shooting practise, and there was one particular day when the two of them had a shooting competition with Bucky. Which was memorable to say the least.
‘I am an admirer of yours Wade Wilson,’ she replies, turning to face me and her face is so pale its almost translucent. Her dark hair doesn’t help with that, neither do her dark eyes. She looks a bit like a corpse if I’m honest. Or a weird creature thing out of one of those supernatural shows that Pete’s gotten into. Don’t ask me the name of it, I don’t exactly pay attention to the screen when he’s around. ‘You do cause such wonderful destruction. Such sweet death.’
There’s been some rather interesting moments he’s been called in to help with. One of the moments that sticks in his mind was when Thor and Tony were working with Thor’s lightning and the god had managed to short the electrics in the training room which, when Tony had gone to look at, had then electrocuted the inventor and sent him flying across the room; despite his assurances he was fine Thor had insisted that Bruce came to check him over. The sight of Tony Stark sitting propped up against a wall, with the god of thunder rivalling Steve in the mother hen department, with his hair sticking up all over the place and a large purple egg blooming on his forehead from where he’d hit the wall had Bruce doubling over in laughter and having to try and tend to his friend through tears streaming down his face. Other than bruised pride and the lump on his head Tony had been fine, but Bruce had still insisted JARVIS wake him up regularly through the night in case he had a concussion. The inventor hadn’t come out of his workshop for a week until the lump on his forehead had gone and Clint was still upset he hadn’t got to see Tony’s ‘electrician’ look as it had since been dubbed. Steve had been beside himself with worry for the whole week, though had tried to hide it from the team, but Bruce had walked in on him asking JARVIS for updates on the inventor throughout the whole week.
Strange’s face softens slightly and he leans back in his chair with a nod. ‘I can understand that. Which is why I said you need a break. It’s not easy going through someone else’s memories, and in this case the being whose memories we are seeing is particularly violent. Something which is very different to your own nature.’
Steve just nods as she takes her coffee and pads out of the room. Something in the back of his mind balks at the suggestion.
‘Finally! We were starting to think we’d have to send out a search party,’ Bucky greets them as they walk back into the common area.
‘Tony’s attacking the front,’ Steve shakes his head, ‘I heard his repulsors as we made our way around.’
He ignores the last comment as they weave between the crowds of students all heading in the same direction. ‘I’m not sure what he needs to know.’
‘Completely understandable in the circumstances, Miss Romanov,’ Mr Harris looks a little flustered. ‘Where would you like us to take the kids?’
‘So long story short I may have been tinkering with my web shooters in the workshop to see if I could put in a function with more power and I swear I thought I had it right and I asked FRIDAY to run loads of tests and everything, so I thought I’d come and try them out and they… well they kind of exploded and when I tried to come up and get rid of them I…err well I may have got a bit tangled up in the webs and…well you can see.’
Clint bursts out laughing. ‘You’re more concerned about that than the fact you’ve just seen him kissing
‘What do you take me for, Barnes?’ she smirks, even though she knows he can’t see her. ‘Some half-assed spy halfway through her training?’
‘So when’s the wedding?’ Bucky interrupts, laughing as both of them turn glares on him. ‘Anyway I thought we were supposed to be listening to Spider-Man’s report?’
Panic fills his chest as the material starts to rise up, the man at the table has cut himself free and is heading towards the other two.
‘You know, Spidey,’ the normally mouthy merc says after a few moments of silence. ‘It feels like you’re the only one who gets me a lot of the time as well. If that Hammer guy comes within twenty feet of you, let me know. I may have to ask for a pass on the no killing rule though.’
‘Bullseye, Snowflake,’ Wade sighs, letting go of Peter’s hand to open the bag he’d put at his feet when they sat down. ‘I…I’m not from here.’
Wade laughs and presses a kiss to his lips, still grumbling Peter tries to hide his smile with a frown. ‘Of course you encourage them by existing. Didn’t old Tin Can encourage
to send it over. Would you prefer I went for America’s golden boy rather than your intern? I know HYDRA would
Bucky laughs again. ‘Never mind, you’ll work it out eventually. Now I suggest you give Tony a day or so to let his logical brain kick in and then you go and apologise. Hopefully he’ll apologise too.’ The former assassin turns and heads back towards the doors.
Natasha scowls as she takes off her sunglasses. ‘You really need to work on your undercover skills,’ she grumbles, taking the offered seat on the bench next to him.
‘I’m unsure. I doubt they have the strength for the invasions they organised before, and the Casket of Ancient Winters, which held much of their power, was lost with Asgard’s destruction. It could be, having heard what happened to us, that they have discovered we have taken refuge on Midgard and could be looking to get revenge for the past, either on me alone or on Asgard as a whole.’
Strange and Wong exchange a look, and Wong nods. ‘Alright,’ Strange says, ‘we’ll be here tomorrow at noon. In the meantime we shall see what information the Sanctum and Kamar-Taj possesses on the Infinity Stones.’
‘Alright you and Wanda get to the auditorium, find your mask and wait for instructions. FRIDAY will set you up with comms as soon as the mask is on. I’ll make sure our friend here isn’t going anywhere and then join you. Vision and Rhodey should already be in place monitoring the other hostages.’
But Peter cuts across him, intent on finishing what he has to say. ‘I know you don’t normally stick around, I’ve heard Thor talking about how surprised he is that you’ve stayed as long as you have, but I wish you would stay you know. You’re like my uncle now or something, like the rest of the team, and I’d miss you if you disappeared and didn’t turn up for years at a time. I know the rest of the team would miss you too, especially Tony. But Bucky would miss you most of all and I don’t want to see that easy smile he gets around you go away; he was so strong when Tony and Steve got together, knowing Tony had chosen his best friend over him, he deserves some kind of happiness.’ He pauses and looks at Loki out of the corner of his eye. ‘So do you. I don’t know everything about what happened to you growing up, but I know enough to know people kept overlooking you for your brother. Bucky wants
Tony looks back over their assembled forces. Behind them, forming the centre of the force, is the Wakandan army and T’Challa’s King’s Guard, on the right is M’Baku’s army, and to the left is the army of Jotunheim. Mixed in amongst them all are warriors from Kamar-Taj and along the front are the Avengers. Wanda is still in the lab with Shuri, ready to destroy the Mind Stone as soon as it has been removed from Vision’s head; Loki has left a small group of Jotun to act as a guard in case any of Thanos’ army gets through, along with some of the King’s Guard, Bruce is doing what he can to assist and Fury is staying with them to help co-ordinate the attack.
‘Nah,’ he sits up long enough to place another kiss to Tony’s lips before lying on his front, ‘you’ve definitely improved me.’ He can’t stop the groan of contentment as Tony’s fingers start working his tight muscles. In hindsight perhaps they were a bit ambitious bringing the tree back just the three of them.
‘That night we decided we were going to start a family, me and Vanessa. She knew me before all this,’ he gestures to his body and Peter knows he’s referring to the scars which apparently cover every inch of his skin, ‘but she still wanted to be with me. We were talking about baby names when they came, the gang members. I managed to get all the fuckers. All except one. He shot her.’
‘You know what? I don’t have to sit here and listen to you two. I’m going to listen to the kid’s report,’ he says, feigning hurt.
‘True, but we’re still too close to heavily built up areas,’ Steve counters, ‘in Wakanda we can control where we fight in an open area away from the city, and T’Challa has safeguards in place to defend the city if needed. New York doesn’t have that.’ Natasha nods in response, looking back over to the group gathered around Vision. ‘Is he stable enough to move?’ he asks them.
‘She says you are forgiven,’ FRIDAY reassures him, ‘she also says she would suggest getting some ‘exercise’ with your boyfriend in bed to help with the stress but that the boss and the Captain would likely murder her, and your boyfriend is being far too sensible to be useful.’
There’s a chorus of laughter from behind and Tony frowns at Steve. ‘Be careful or I’m sending your Christmas present back,’ he warns him.
bad,’ Peter argues, ‘and I think he feels really guilty over everything that happened. It’s not like he
As everyone’s confidence grows Natasha takes Wanda and Peter and heads to the centre and the three of them have some fun trying to adapt the ballet lessons to the ice. In fairness it may have gone better had Wade not kept swopping in and disrupting them, and even on one occasion challenging Nebula to a form of slalom race between the rest of the skaters.
‘Yeah he’s cool,’ Peter says, taking off his tie and undoing his top button. ‘Man that feels so much better! Did they make these things to be torture devices or something?’
say the shit we don’t want to admit, and at least if it’s me you can make yourself feel better by shooting me afterwards. The fact is, Widow, HYDRA created the Winter Soldier and they gave Wanda her powers. If
‘You want to tell us where the damn things are? I don’t think they’ve had anyone in to clean the place in years, they’ve got to be hiding under a mountain of shit,’ Bucky responds.
‘And I’ve got Scott ready on standby should anything happen, and even Strange has said he’ll help’ Tony adds. ‘Honestly Pete it’s like you don’t think Iron Man can look after himself.’
‘Before I agree to help I want to ask a question,’ Loki says eventually, and Bucky turns to face him, nodding his agreement. ‘Is this, in part, the reason you have been so against my being here until I helped Peter?’
‘I don’t,’ he manages to get past his dry throat. ‘You don’t have to listen to anything I say, Tony. I just…I wanted to see if you were…I…’ He can’t finish any of his sentences, everything he starts trying to say sounds so wrong and meaningless.
‘And because of that,’ Tony interjects, ‘I was able to find out what Obadiah was doing. In an attempt to save himself he gave us your name and everything you did to help him. Well,’ he shrugs, ‘I say
Steve is at his side, trying his best to hide him from view, Natasha is on his other and effectively silencing any more questions with her glare alone. Behind him the rest of the team is following.
‘Oh don’t worry, Wade,’ Francis’ grin is predatory. ‘You’ll be too busy soon to worry about little old me.’
Half way through the film, which they’re only half watching because they’re actually having too much fun gossiping about the rest of the team, Wanda gets a little quiet.
Steve shakes his head. ‘No broken bones anywhere else just…just a lot of bruising, lack of sleep and proper food. They said you may have lingering symptoms of concussion after being knocked out, but they had to wait for you to wake up to be a hundred percent sure.’
‘I’ll visit them when we’ve agreed on things,’ Nick nods, fixing the teen with one of his infamous one-eyed stares. ‘And I think I might know anyway, but who are you young man?’
‘Not one more step you giant lump of Jell-o’ Tony says, landing with a thump between Thanos and the two Avengers.
He cuts him off by pressing a kiss to his lips. ‘Steve, we could have the mother of all armies arrive on our doorstep tomorrow. No more waiting around and putting off what we want, alright? I’m ready for this, I’m pretty sure
Steve decided to take pity on Peter earlier and took it upon himself to monitor his childhood friend. They’d gone to stand near the bar, even though neither of them could get drunk it was entertaining seeing the reactions to the amount they were managing to drink between them from the bar staff.
‘You’re not going to lose me, Baby Boy,’ Deadpool says, voice just as quiet. ‘You know me, I’m like a bad rash that just won’t go away. The only way I’m going anywhere is if you ask me to.’
‘Just because we won’t be anything more than friends doesn’t mean I’m going to stop trying to look after you. Not after everything you’ve done for me.’
he scolds himself. He feels Loki’s presence pushing at the corner of his mind, but ignores it and stumbles to his feet and follows Natasha.
,’ he spits at the other man, ‘I’m sure he’ll give you a picture.’ With that he launches himself back up the wall and onto the rooftop.
‘That will depend on how much we have managed to heal up by the time we get there. It could take anything from a few days to a few weeks. Possibly longer, but I wouldn’t think that would be the case considering how well you’ve been responding to treatment already.’
Daredevil looks at him for a few more moments before nodding. ‘Stay out of Hell’s Kitchen. Both of you. The moment I think your judgement is impaired I’ll take him out myself.’ Peter watches him go, arms crossed over his chest and trying to ignore the pounding of his heart. He’s surprised the other two didn’t hear it.
‘They’ve got more volunteers in that truck,’ Bucky says. ‘What do we do? I hate to think of leaving them but I don’t know we’ve got the time to get to them.’
‘Alright Wanda new rule. If someone else touches the ball you have to let it be touched by another of your teammates before you can use your power on it again,’ Rhodes shouts, obviously giving up on trying to keep the game in check.
‘-are coming with me is that he knows HYDRA and can create just as much destruction as I can. And your Mo-’
Peter comes out of the memory as he falls to the floor, gasping for air and desperately trying to hold himself up as his body shakes violently.
‘As flattering as the proposition is I’m not on the market for marriage I’m afraid,’ Tony quips, ignoring his partner’s frown.
‘Yeah and FRIDAY will put it straight through no matter where you are. Relax,’ Bucky throws some of the popcorn they’ve made intending to watch trash until they got the call from the two lovebirds.
‘And where exactly would that be?’ Sam asks, coming and standing behind their chairs as Clint fires up the engines.
‘Thanks for the tacos,’ he replies, reaching for some sauce. ‘I’m pretty sure it was my turn to buy.’
‘I think Mr Stark would have a few things to say about it as well,’ Karen says once the mask is over his face.
‘Oh come on you’re dying to introduce your secret boyfriend to someone,’ Wanda teases. ‘You seriously came here by yourself?’
Tony sighs and rubs his temples with one hand. ‘We have until next Friday,’ he answers quietly. ‘If we’ve made enough progress I may be able to convince them to give us another week, possibly two.’
‘That’s not what I meant,’ Bucky hurries to add. ‘Sorry, I meant – man I’m shit at this. What I meant to ask was: you have experience with mind control right?’
‘She was Aunt Peggy wasn’t she?’ Rhodes asks, coming over to sit next to his friend. ‘She’s the one who used to send you all those food packages during college.’
Wade pulls him into a tight hug and Peter buries his face in the man’s hoodie, he feels the scarred cheek rest against the top of his head. ‘I wish I could promise you the world, Baby Boy,’ he answers quietly, ‘but all I can do is promise to do everything I can to keep you safe and make sure you’ve got your team by the end of all this shit.’
‘Let us know and someone will come help you get him out. Whoever gets him, get him on the Quinjet. Tony is our number one priority tonight; any extra destruction we can cause along the way is a bonus.’
Peter frowns up at him, arms crossed and hips forward in a posture of pissed-off Spider-Man that Wade knows
‘Please remember to breathe,’ Strange interrupts with a raised eyebrow, ‘I dread to think what the Black Widow would do to me should you run out of air and collapse in my library.’
‘You have food at the end of basically every patrol. I’m surprised no one’s taken a picture and sent it to a paper yet.’
‘I arrived when he was facing Francis,’ Bucky replies before Wade can open his mouth, ‘he knows about Wade and Pete, so I was going to help Wade take him out with a shot. Bastard decided to bring the warehouse down around us instead.’ He keeps the fact Wade gave up on catching Francis to save his life to himself. A promise is a promise.
Tony shakes his head. ‘You assured me during our last meeting that Captain Rogers had been cleared of all his crimes, along with the others on the team. There was nothing yesterday to suggest anything other than Ross acting alone. I assume I can continue to trust you to keep your word?’
Loki laughs. ‘An interesting idea. Remind me not to come into the training room whilst you’re testing things.’
‘Wow, uh, hey,’ Harry extends his hand for Wade to shake. ‘Sorry you just aren’t what I was expecting when Pete told me he had a boyfriend.’
into it,’ Sam grumbles, ‘my pack malfunctioned and I crashed into it. Hey, you alright Tony? You look beat.’
‘When you’re ready, Wong,’ Tony says, firing up his chest reactor. ‘Pete how you doing with Strange?’
The first day of Yule preparations arrives and manages to take Loki by surprise in how quickly it does so.
Peter slumps back into bed, covering his face with a pillow. ‘Thunder. No alarm clocks with Thor, its rolling thunder he has to wake you up with.’
Sam’s quiet for a few moments. ‘Tony? I know our track record doesn’t exactly speak for us, but now we’re back we’re not going anywhere again.’
Steve gate-crashes the SI party, but before he can get inside he meets a dark-haired man who says he can help Bucky.
Let me know what you thought of these two chapters and Tony's relationship with Peggy. I thought it strange he didn't go to her funeral as he must have seen her quite a bit as a child.
He pauses once he reaches the roof, lifting up the front of his mask to try and wipe at his watering eyes. He closes them against the images of broken bodies across the auditorium floor, of bodies crumpling to the floor of negotiators sent to save him. Killed by weapons that shouldn’t have been in the hands of humans, let alone terrorists.
‘Of course I can. I’m sure Bucky could help you too, and I know Tony’s fluent in French and Italian as well. What did you want to start with?’
let us do something even half way exciting she needs to leave the facility, because I will not be able to look her in the eye the next morning.’
‘Cute,’ she says, putting it to one side for Bruce to find later and reaching for another one. This time she opens an envelope and finds a picture of Spider-Man swinging past the Empire State Building, this one done by a very talented artist, who had signed their name in the corner and written a brief thank you on the back to Spider-Man for helping to keep the city safer.
Loki nods and places one hand back on Thor’s shoulder, and one on Valkyrie’s. ‘Good luck,’ he says, and they disappear. No sooner have they gone than Loki collapses, his legs unable to bear his weight.
‘Well for once, my dear Captain,’ Tony smiles back, ‘my brain appears to be working slowly enough that I can be
Hope you all enjoyed these chapters and thank you so much for your continued support. I honestly can't say it enough.
‘Thor, Peter already told you all of this before,’ Loki cuts across his brother as the blond opens his mouth to argue again, ‘can we
‘If you speak to Sergeant Barnes,’ Peter chuckles, ‘he’ll say that Captain Rogers still can’t keep his mouth shut.’ That earns a laugh from the crowd, and Steve looks at Bucky out of the corner of his eye; he hands the man a tissue, noticing the tears falling silently down his face.
‘Uh…’ he rolls over and sees the alien about to hit him with another piece of debris. Then there’s someone standing over him, holding the alien’s fist back.
A pained sound from the body in his arms makes him freeze as he turns to the door and look down. ‘Steve?’ the cracked whisper is barely audible, but dark eyes open slightly to look at him.
‘Is it about the strike on the school bus? Because I really didn’t mean for her to try and kill my classmate, I mean she took that the wrong way and I think we seriously need to look at AI interpretation of instructions-’
Tony’s doesn’t answer as he passes the third box to Steve, emptying the last of the second flavour bags into the bowl and calling for Wanda to take it over. The soldier is just beginning to wonder if he’s ever going to answer the question when Tony’s quiet voice breaks the quiet in the kitchenette. ‘He reminded me of us.’
‘He tried convincing me the Star Wars prequels were not a travesty to mankind. Get him out of the room.’
‘Gaps can be left where there shouldn’t be one,’ Bucky continues the explanation, ‘or they can leave us without backup because they don’t realise we can’t actually manage on our own.’ Then he grins. ‘They also need to learn what distracts certain team members so they can make allowances for that.’
‘Don’t try and give me any of your goddamn speeches, Cap,’ he spits. ‘I’ll just have to find some other way to make myself useful. Maybe take a cookery course so I can do more than pasta for dinner. I can always keep the Council off your backs I suppose, I am getting pretty good at arguing with Ross-’
Natasha looks at him for a few seconds. ‘I didn’t think Nick needed to know. You’d been through enough and Pepper said you were getting better with it.’
‘You do realise they’ll do nothing to stop that arm if he actually decides to make a break for it right?’ Tony points out. The man looks between Bucky’s slightly amused expression and his own increasingly frustrating one, seemingly not knowing what to do. Tony throws his hands into the air. ‘Rhodey!’ he pleads for his best friend’s help. ‘Your military guys are killing me over here.’
Steve’s about to say something else when Bucky’s voice drifts over from the group. ‘What do you mean you don’t play football? Surely you’d leave them all in the dust?’
Peter just laughs at the shocked expression on Deadpool’s face, even through the mask it’s obvious, and looks around the streets below them. It’s been a quiet patrol today, so they’ve decided to take a break sitting on the edge of a building and Peter’s asked Karen to let them know if anything comes through the police radios.
‘Can we not tell him and get Peter to do it all in secret?’ Natasha asks. ‘Then just show him the finished project?’
‘Thanks, Nakia,’ Clint smiles at her, wrapping a steadying arm around Natasha’s waist. ‘Now how about we all head over there? Pete and Wade should be joining us soon as well.’
‘Just pull,’ Rhodes grits out from between clenched teeth, as Clint hauls him towards him. It’s not easy, being stuck in a confined space and Rhodes isn’t the lightest of men with the amount of muscle he’s built up over the years, but they manage to get him nearly face to face with Clint.
‘Don’t we all,’ Bruce sighs, rubbing his temples. He’s not sure whether this is going to be worse or better than last team Christmas, but it’s certainly going to be just as interesting.
‘Let him have it,’ Steve tells them, and the three of them unleash their full power at the alien. He screams, a long, loud, high pitched scream, that lingers even when he falls motionless to the ground.
‘It is alright, Mr Stark, these men need no introductions,’ August laughs, ‘come along, gentlemen.’ He looks at Loki. ‘I am particularly interested to speak to you, Mr Laufeyson,’ he raises a hand at the surprised look Loki gives Tony, ‘fear not, Mr Stark made it perfectly clear I was not to alert anyone else to your identity. I am a scholar first and foremost, and the chance to have someone translate these markings is not one I am prepared to pass up.’
Wanda looks at him, surprised at the calm and inquisitive look on his face. No blame for the attempt having gone wrong, just curiosity. ‘Maybe,’ she says slowly, ‘the blast pushed against the edges of the opening and it took me by surprise. Perhaps if I wasn’t as tired I may have been able to control it.’
She laughs and wraps her hands her mug. ‘Is this about Ross? You’ve got to be careful Tony, we can’t just try and take the guy out, it’ll ruin our relationship with the Council as well as the US Government.’
She rolls her eyes and shakes her head, but there’s a small smile on her lips as well. ‘Alright… well we’ve got Captain Brock Rumlow, head of the squad who obviously knew about Barnes’ condition and covered it up. Then there’s the rest of the squad: Blake Matthews, Andrew Hampshire, Sam Wilson, Luke Albright, Caesar Magellan and Paul Withers. Hang on…’
‘He’s probably going to give me more grey hairs than being Iron Man ever did,’ Tony quips, trying to find some steady ground.
not for how much money your daddy has. Now why don’t you run along to your cronies and leave us to enjoy our dinner in peace?’
‘It also means,’ Tony says, looking at Thor and Loki, ‘we’re better able to provide protection and asylum to any Asgardians who need it, rather than having to find ways to hide you away. We’ll also be better able to appoint our own staff, and hopefully be less likely to have moles in our midst. All of this,’ he looks at the rest of the team, ‘will only happen if everyone agrees to it, and
‘No arguments,’ Tony cuts off whatever Sam is about to say. ‘Let’s get moving people, we’ve not got that much daylight left and we’ve still got the inside tree to decorate.’
‘I swear, Thor, if they don’t arrive to pick you up soon I shall get my Pegasus to take you there and you can freeze on the ride over the Atlantic.’
‘He’s really trying to get back the Avengers’ popularity back isn’t he?’ Ned comments, putting down a finished model.
'Yeah told you to go have a look. Might save you a phone call,' Weasel chuckles, then breaks off when he catches sight of Wade's face. 'Uh Wade? Wade!'
A/N: Hey everyone! Thank you so much for all the comments and kudos this week, I love getting to read the comments through the week and hearing what you guys think of everything.
‘What?’ Steve bursts out laughing. ‘No! Where on earth did that come from? Of course it’s not Bucky; that’d be like sleeping with my brother. It was, uh, it was one of the guys from the crew when we were touring with the shows; I never did find out what happened to him.’
‘You are the people who clean up after us when we’ve made the mess, you’re the ones who look after the casualties who are caught in the middle of our battles, and you’re the ones who continue to help the people who lost loved ones after we’ve left. And yet it seems to be us that get the thanks.
?!?’ Peter’s eyes are the widest Loki has ever seen them. He’ll admit to being just as surprised as the teenager, though more at the fact that Tony has told him now as opposed to the actual revelation.
Peter gives a wet laugh as he pulls away from the death grip hug he’s had on Tony. ‘But why can’t I go with you?’
Peter opens his mouth to answer when FRIDAY interrupts. ‘Boss? We’ve just had a large group land in the grounds; energy signatures are comparable to those of the Bifrost, and two of the lifeforms are showing as being Thor and Dr Banner.’
From the looks of things the fight is not going well for Loki. The ice weapons formed at the end of his arms do not look as stable and solid as the ones Lautenus has, and there are several bleeding wounds on his arms and face; his breathing appears heavier than his opponent and he is certainly on the defensive, ducking and weaving under all of the attacks and barely getting any in himself.
‘Oh thank the Norns you are back!’ Loki says as he walks into the room. ‘If that boyfriend of yours doesn’t stop moping around the place I’m going to freeze him into a solid block of ice that won’t melt for a year!’
‘Stay back or I’ll blow this whole place to hell,’ Hammer snarls, pulling a detonation device from his pocket. Bucky pauses mid-step, gun still trained on Tony’s former business rival. Scott reappears in full height next to the Winter Soldier.
‘You guys have done too much,’ he says, putting his plate down to take the box. He opens the top and his eyes nearly pop out of his head. ‘No way!’
‘Shut up and hurry up,’ Steve rolls his eyes at him, ‘I don’t like the fact we still haven’t run into the Jotuns yet, and I don’t trust that they got crushed in the cave in.’
‘Big talk for someone still standing on the poolside,’ Bucky taunts, spluttering as Steve sends a wave of water into his face.
to follow clear instructions, I’m sure it will come back soon.’ He gives his brother a shove down to the other end of the line and tries to ignore the satisfied smirk on Thor’s face. ‘And if I find out you’ve been purposefully pathetic at teaching this I’ll turn you into a toad.’
Rosie stirs and wriggles on his chest as he lays back down, arms protectively around her to keep her safe. ‘Baba’ she mutters in her sleep and settles back down again.
‘I think you want to listen to my proposition first,’ Hammer says, grabbing Peter’s elbow. ‘And didn’t your parents teach you it’s rude to be on your phone while talking to someone?’
Asgard I found creatures who were not quite so concerned about taking the feelings of hurt and rejection I felt and twisting them to their own ends.’
‘Wade…are you…have you been knitting all those extra Christmas sweaters by yourself?’ Peter knows he’s still gaping like a fish, but the sight of the merc, curled up on the bed surrounded by wool and a half finished Ant-Man sweater on his lap is something he’s still trying to make sense of in his mind.
‘Good to know you remembered something,’ he counters, blinking through the tears. ‘They took me away from you,’ he tells her, and sees her stop, ‘because they had to wipe me too much when I was with you. You made me too human.’
‘I feel that you may have read one too many of those printed cards the stores insist on selling,’ Loki grins at him.
Tony feels Steve tense next to him and knows the soldier isn’t happy. ‘Honestly Thor? It’s a lot to ask when we have to put aside the knowledge that this is the guy we first had to fight against as a team. However,’ he holds up a hand to cut off whatever the god is about to say, ‘having seen the way your people reacted to his, what I assume is his, true form? The knowledge that he was under mind control when he attacked us? I’m willing to give him a chance if Steve and Natasha are.’
Loki manages to catch Steve whilst they’re taking the food to the table for lunch, and can’t help but grin at the teasing the soldier receives for the shade of red he turns. Honestly this contest is doing wonders for his ego. By mutual agreement there’s a pause in the competition while they eat lunch, and Loki surprisingly finds himself seated near the children along with Strange.
‘We can always go tomorrow morning,’ he smiles at her, ‘I think we are both a little too tired to be walking around a gallery.’ He offers her his hand and pulls her to her feet. ‘You did well, Wanda.’
of you along to get the Christmas trees,’ Sam grumbles as they park up at the place Rhodes had found for them last night.
‘Yeah, I wasn’t looking where I was going,’ he mutters. Briefly he considers shaking off the arm, but finds he’s too grateful for the gesture.
The man shrugs. ‘No need to thank me, I’m happy to help out my favourite arachnid. I would say you could pay me back with a date, but pretty sure I’d end up in jail.’
‘You know for such a big bad assassin you are such a wuss,’ she shakes her head. ‘Can you pass the rolls, Sam?’
Loki knows if Thor were in this situation he would launch in with an attack as quickly as possible and try and surprise his opponent. Unfortunately he’s never had the same kind of physical strength as Thor, nor is he that comfortable fighting in this form to emulate his brother.
He just laughs and holds his hands up in a placating manner at the furious look she sends him. ‘I’m joking! I’m joking!’ When she finally calms down he adds. ‘But you’ve just confirmed my suspicions. So come on: spill.’
‘You want us to time it around picking up your adopted son as well? Make it proper family time?’ the blond teases.
‘Probably because I’m faster and can dodge stuff,’ Tony can feel the movement in the bed from the boy’s shrug. ‘Now come on get up!’ he starts trying to drag the covers off them.
The look his friend gives him Steve can’t quite place before the other soldier gives a quiet laugh. ‘Oh Stevie, you’re even more oblivious than you were before the war.’
A/N: Hi everyone. Thank you so much for continuing to read this series and to all you wonderful people that have left kudos and comments. Please do let me know what you think of these two chapters, I think they were possibly my favourite ones to write of this whole instalment.
‘If we have the drinking competition now half of us won’t be awake to see in the new year, completely defeating the point of the party,’ Peter says as Tony and Steve walk into the common area.
I'm trying to get back on track with my writing so hopefully I can have a couple more updates up for you this week and we can at least reach the end of Yule before Christmas gets here.
‘FRIDAY says there were a number of people,’ Natasha appears from behind him and Tony tries not to jump, ‘what do you think that means?’
‘I was worried about you alright?’ is the hissed reply. ‘Considering who you helped take on to get Tony out, then you drop off the map? I disappear to Hell’s Kitchen for a couple of
‘Thanks, Wade,’ he says, pausing at a crossing for the lights to change. ‘I’m not going to be allowed on patrol until we find him so we may have to wait for tacos.’
‘If that’s what happens when they become teenagers can we find an anti-ageing serum before Cassie hits it please?’ he hears Scott say as he breaks into a run down the corridor.
you want to find him and how you know him. I’m also not comfortable with having a kid in here, so I’d rather you leave.’
She looks to Peter, and he pleads silently with her to be nice. She walks forwards and extends a hand. ‘Nice of you to join us for Christmas.’ When he warily takes it she pulls him forwards and Peter hears her say quietly into his ear: ‘You hurt my baby spider and I’ll find a way to make you permanently dead.’
Peter doesn’t respond so when it’s his turn again Wade grabs his arm and turns him to face him. ‘Start talking, Baby Boy.’
Unaware the rest of their team has been experiencing problems back in the US, the team at the UN are attacked themselves.
‘We haven’t got a choice, Sam. You’re off doing your Avenger thing, you ain’t here to help all the time,’ a voice replies from the other end of the phone. ‘You don’t see what’s happening, what I have to do to keep it running.’
‘Wasn’t going to suggest it,’ she tells him. ‘Alright, here’s the new plan boys: I’ve got you on the cameras, you start getting everyone out and I’m going to work out your quickest route, when you’re ready I’ll direct you where to go and help you avoid all the guards. When you get to the van you get everyone on board and I’ll set the timer on the charges and meet you there.’
Steve, who has already taken off his tie and suit jacket, and undone his top two buttons just laughs at the teen. ‘Wouldn’t surprise me kid.’
‘I’ll help,’ Peter offers, then grins, ‘I can start at the top and you can start at the bottom of each room.’
Peter feels a sinking in his stomach. ‘You had a job didn’t you?’ He turns to look back out over the city.
‘We won’t know for sure just what kind of thing is going on with these until we get them back to lab. For now treat them like you would have done the Chitauri weapon. Now less chatter people, it’s hard enough to dodge these things as it is,’ Tony says.
Natasha laughs as she presses the call button on Hope’s contact, lifting the phone to her ear. The atmosphere in the jet has just got a little lighter. It looks like the team might be able to heal after all.
Natasha pauses and thinks, letting his unspoken challenge force her to confront her feelings fully. Eventually she swallows past the lump in her throat and nods. ‘I think so.’
have known there was double dealing going on and stopped it, but I wasn’t the one doing the deals. Maybe I shouldn’t have made all of those weapons, but
‘The Commandos,’ he replies, still staring straight ahead even though his vision isn’t focussing on any one thing. ‘You ever think about them, Buck?’
‘You warm me up from the ice and I’ll pull you out of the water, right?’ Steve reminds him, it’s become something of a catchphrase for them that they say after they’ve pulled each other from nightmares. Tony’s only response is another kiss. ‘We should go have a shower.’
‘A knitting group from the city sent some in, and then Wade organised getting the other ones sorted,’ Natasha explains, her Black Widow one now in place.
‘You shouldn’t have made such a fuss about taking off the mask,’ he laughs, then dodges out of range of the merc and into kitchen to see if there was anything he could help with.
‘You’re so fucking predictable,’ Wade yells at the man, heading towards him. ‘You aren’t going to stop me with that threat, Francis, I’ll just walk through it all to kill you for the last time.’
Peter just sits and looks at him with his mouth hanging open. ‘That’s it? You wanted to have a talk because I confused Led Zepplin and AC/DC?’
Then there’s training with the soldier twins, which is a little bit like training with a hurricane and usually leaves him trying to find Rhodey for moral support afterwards. Apparently Tony’s lifestyle used to have the same effect on Rhodey as training with the soldier twins has on Sam.
‘Hey everyone,’ he says, voice a little shaky, ‘uh, I’m not very good at talking in front of people so I’m sorry if I stumble a bit. So we were given a project in history to make a presentation on someone who has made a difference in history.’
‘I know,’ he gasps, ‘but we only have one chance to beat this bastard. We can’t stop now. My suit is the only thing that can harness the power of the stones.’
At Tony’s look he snaps his mouth shut. ‘Boss? Agent Romanov has asked you don’t start the grilling until she arrives.’
‘-just because he can get hurt doesn’t mean he should,’ Natasha quotes Peter in a soft voice. She looks torn, looking back at the burning lab and then back at him. ‘Alright. I’ll message the team and explain the situation, get someone to organise a private wing of a hospital and take these guys there in the jet. Then I’m coming back for you both. Wait for me at our surveillance point, or I’m coming looking for you.’
‘Hey Lokes, you alright?’ the inventor greets him; and Loki can’t believe his luck that Tony is leaning against the wall right under the mistletoe. Though, really, it was probably an intended move from Steve; he’d be willing to bet this is where Tony often leans when he comes out of the workshop, hence the soldier’s decision to hang it there.
‘Thanks for the distraction, Deadpool,’ the woman says, inclining her head towards the entrance, eyes never leaving Hammer.
Peter’s nervous. He’s not heard from Wade in nearly a week, and every time he phones the merc it goes straight through to answerphone. So now he’s contemplating walking into the building opposite and, honestly, he’d much rather face the Vulture again.
Natasha looks up, eyes narrowing and nods. ‘Get everyone up here, FRIDAY,’ she tells the AI, ‘and put the call through.’
Peter closes the space between them so he’s standing close enough to feel the warmth from the man’s body, dropping the end of the web he reaches a hand up to brush over the bald head. ‘I’m looking at you right now, and I don’t see anything disgusting. I finally get to look at one of my best friends, and there’s nothing not to like.’
