Immediately, it soothed some of the panic gathered in Steve’s chest. A little smile even managed to break through, as he marvelled at the way Tony’s mind worked...
Tony broke into a grin. His head swam as he stood up, a physical excitement flooding his limbs like a static deep beneath his muscles. He wiped his hand, and slid the little tube of lube into the pocket of the bathrobe, and set off for the front door at a near run.
And Tony beamed up at Steve, more delighted by the success of his puzzle than he was in himself for solving it – and Steve really thought he was going to say,
A part of him that was still so lost and lonely in this new world, so worn down by all these trials and traumas, so desperate for any chance of happiness-
Steve shifted his weight so that he was kneeling between Tony’s legs, so that he could lean over him and kiss him again, and again, his hands stroking along Tony’s sides as he trailed kisses from the centre of his chest up to his neck, and then up along his throat, and then behind his ear. Tony grabbed the back of his head, and whimpered so softly that Steve almost didn’t hear it, arching his whole body up against him.

sorry for any of it…” He saw the blush deepen across Steve’s cheeks, and felt an immediate pang of affection. “But it wasn’t even that, really.
But it took one glance for Tony to be completely sure… He knew exactly how Steve was feeling. He’d been there. That uneasiness in his own skin, the shapeless, irrational shame that he couldn’t find to talk himself out of. And that strange paranoia, knowing other people had memories of him that he didn’t have for himself – the unnatural feeling, having to ask someone else what
A familiar energy began to gather in Steve’s chest, sparking that electric shivering under his skin… that sharpened focus… that conflicted urge to flee…

But, really, it didn’t matter what the word literally meant – whether it even had a secondary meaning. It was simply knowing that there was once a society who would’ve seen Obie as a monster amongst their

And Steve wasn’t really capable of following the thread of this rant. It was taking considerable effort to pick out the individual words… But he had identified the overall topic. And he was apparently capable of picking an individual point out of the noise, and focusing on it with all the oblivious confidence of a drunk…
it was better… he had the odd feeling that he wouldn’t much like the answer, or himself, if he did work it out…
And then Tony bounded down the stairs to meet him, and threw his arms around Steve’s neck, and let Steve guide him up into a warm, unhurried kiss…
Tony threw his arms around Steve’s neck, moaning against his mouth, another wave of pleasure rolling though him as Steve rocked his hips. And then he let one hand run along Steve’s shoulder, and thought of the perfect, powerful body pressed against him, those pretty lips, kissing him right now, that beautiful cock, inside him,
stage in his life, if he’d only known. And then he glanced up at Tony again. “You know… you’re not the only one bringing their own issues into this.”
On the plus side of things, the editing is going well, and if I make the same progress with my other fic I should be able to move up to more regular updates soon.
...And, okay, perhaps there was still just a hint of personal doubt and disappointment that Tony had asked him to leave - which he
“Hm,” she observed, in an enigmatic, superior tone that should probably have prompted him to ask what she was thinking.
After all these years of being scared to wonder, Tony now knew exactly what being a vampire meant – even the dark and primal parts of it-
But Tony knew there was something in what Steve had just said. He remembered it – he remembered ‘call the Avengers’… that they’d been saying that for hours now…
that he was supposed to be with Steve right now… that he’d feel a lot more anxious, and in a very different way, if he just let Steve leave…
thought Steve was at his absolute loveliest like this - and he’d always taken a deep, emotional pleasure being able to look at Steve, unguarded and unashamed and happy, in the moments after he came…
“I decided to just buy the place,” Tony replied, with what was clearly meant to be a nonchalant shrug. “I can do that sort of thing. I’m very rich.”
Steve remembered nodding. He remembered his throat was still sore when he told Tony that he had to see it…
very curious as to how the hell you played ‘Strip Call of Duty’… But not enough to postpone his daydreaming any longer.
As there was no one here for him to explain himself to, no ideology he had to promote - no consequences to this admission, in and of itself…
on Tony Stark's report. The first time Steve saw it, he’d just finished reading all of his friends' obituaries, and he’d not had much mental energy left for the people he’d never even met - if his attention hadn’t been snagged by that strange…
someone’s blood, it’s always a mixture of everything… and I never know that person – and it’s not like I’m ever going to pass anyone in the street, so who knows if… y’know, I’d know, or they’d know…”
But to be honest, Steve was still more focused on the idea of Nick Fury arriving at Tony’s house, unannounced, and uninvited, and
It was the look on Steve’s face. The guileless, delighted shock that lit up his every feature as he gasped,
And then he sank into the couch behind him, and he tried to think of its name. A strange, silly sounding name… Peter had named it…
would only lead to a thousand other questions that Tony couldn’t answer. Probably a hundred well-meaning suggestions that Tony couldn’t possibly act on. God Bless Rhodey and his eternal optimism that Tony might one day be able to make a single step back into the world… But Tony wasn’t in the mood for it right now. He winced at the very thought of Rhodey suggesting he ask for Steve’s number, or pointing out that it was healthy to like people, or any of his usual encouragement. Tony didn’t want to have to argue with it. He didn’t want to have to think about it.
Tony wrapped his legs around Steve’s waist and rolled his hips into him, a compulsive friction grinding up through him as Steve moaned into his neck.
, how… God, he didn’t even know what to call the feeling that had flooded through him in that moment. Whether it was a grand flash of spiritual enlightenment or the recognition of the most basic, animal impulse. Something unlike anything he’d ever felt before. That felt like something he
And he hated himself for essentially giving Steve the silent treatment. He knew he was doing it, and he knew it was the worst of all the options. None of the catharsis of actually having this thing out, none of the superior serenity of letting it go. No chance of claiming the high ground, yet again.
He felt the oddest impulse to apologise, a subconscious direction to lean over Tony, to cover him. A confusing mix of shock at himself, and shame, and pride, and exhilaration… And then he looked down over Tony’s body, laid out for him on the couch. The lines of his muscles, highlighted bronze under the lamplight. The scar in the centre of his chest, a perfect circle of raised skin decorated with a thousand silver threads, like a memorial artwork for the arc reactor. His cock, hard against his stomach…
He wanted to explore these ideas, he wanted to ask Steve questions and give him hypothetical scenarios and posit counter arguments, just to push it further.
He didn’t break his rhythm as he shifted back just a little, so that he could lower his head and press a soft kiss to the inside of Steve’s thigh-
something, that this revelation was bigger than what was happening in the moment, that this was actually so much better than how it felt right now.
But no. There was Steve, standing there like an enthusiastic Labrador puppy, just happy to see him - demanding
that… Wondering if he should feel at least little bit embarrassed. Wondering if he should maybe feel guilty. And, purely out of habit, wondering if Tony would think any less of him because of it-
“The team’s meeting in the conference room in an hour,” Nick replied, breezing right over the edge on Steve’s voice. “Agent Romanoff is going with you.”
“Well…” Steve suggested pointedly, leaning back to make it very clear he was checking out Tony’s ass-
Unfortunately, that moment of clear self-awareness triggered something much more chaotic, as Steve rushed to realize just how out of control everything was, and the reasons that had always frightened him, and all the new questions about whether it
He didn’t even care that he’d completely forgotten the conversation he was in the middle of, he didn’t stop to note that it had been something very important. For a few seconds, that was all there was in the world-
Tony refused to spiral into his past failures. He wouldn’t let his guilt stop him from correcting them. He
There was no argument, however well thought out or cleverly communicated, that would dissuade people of that inherent
And, like Steve, his first instinct had been to think back over the night before – and then to worry that he’d done something wrong.
He glanced up and scanned the drive more carefully, an uncomfortable, exposed feeling crawling over his skin as he worked out what he was looking for…
. Steve let a serene smile settle on his face, writhing against Tony’s motions very gently, letting the cool air run over his freshly clean skin. And by the time Tony set the cloth aside, Steve just felt so refreshed and comfortable and…

So, what, he was going to start judging Natasha for mistakes he’d already forgiven, mistakes she’d already accepted and learned from, just because he’d seen them now? He was going to judge Nat for the time before she grew to care for Tony, even though there had been a time when Steve made exactly the same mistake?
“…Because you are planning to re-write the entire ideology of the entire world” Steve struggled to begin, failing to find words for how ridiculous this all was.
to it. It consumed Tony entirely, touching him in places he couldn’t find, subtly changing how everything looked and sounded and felt-
, for hours, you don’t answer the phone, SHIELD can’t even get in touch with you - what did you expect me to think?”
“Look, I don’t know anything, and I don’t want any trouble,” Wesley implored helplessly, as Steve strolled right past him and into the living area.

“Oh, yeah…” Tony frowned, sweeping his eyes over the flawless lines of his kitchen. “I forget where it is…”
is not the end of the world. This is you make an understandable mistake, and I’m hurt, and you say sorry and then I’m not hurt any more and it’s fine. And then I’m not angry and I still love you, and you’re still…”
The truth was, he still wasn’t invested enough in this little side quest. It had sparked a curiosity, sure, and he was quite happy to keep musing over these items as he found them-
“Compiling results now,” JARVIS replied, as a hologram display flashed into life and rapidly filled with names and dates…
“What the hell are you doing? Why did you turn on me? What did you just drug me with? How did you do that?” Zan babbled suddenly, a string of sound with no gaps in the middle – cut short when Steve forced her to sit on the office chair with a bump.
I just talked to people when I was angry and just said things without thinking what I was really thinking… So,
thinking that, maybe, at the end of this… you’d have another friend that you could call, sometimes.”
Things Tony was still sure didn’t fit with being an immortal, blood-drinking, fairy monster, things that didn’t even fit with the emotional wreck he’d been all day… and yet there it was.
“Hi,” Steve breathed, forgetting all about his plan to try and play it cool. And he probably would’ve followed with something cringe-makingly awkward, or adorably dazed, except that Tony was too excited to leave a gap for it.
I have ever wanted,” Steve promised, his voice low and gritty with need, “you are everything anyone could ever want - you are more wonderful than anything I could have dreamed up, more spectacular than anything I could’ve asked for… You make everything make
Coulson flashed a patient smile at her - which Tony deeply resented - before he turned and took his sweet time strolling to the front door.
Many things about Steve’s relationship with Tony were still unnerving and uncomfortable; the ominous prospect of
Tony actually let go of a wistful little sigh, as his thoughts drifted away from Dimitri and Ottilie and onto thoughts of Steve, as they always did-
In the interest of giving too many details, rather than too few - by my standards, this is a fairly violent chapter. I wouldn't say it falls into the realms of gore or anything like that, but if you have any concerns or triggers regarding wounds, blood that isn't of the fun-vampire-variety, near death moments, or descriptions of self harm, please read the end notes (there is no actual self harm in this update, but the images used may be triggering in that regard.)
to be with him. All the reasons that might be impossible or painful or costly. All the reasons Steve should be frightened by this reaction, all the things a previous version of him might’ve said about all this. All the ways it would kill him, if he had to walk away from Tony now.
“Yeah, of course I am” Steve frowned… which then softened into a sad smile, as he realised “…I’m sorry I never said that, before. I didn’t… well, I still don’t really understand what that loss meant, really. If I’m being honest. But I know it was one, and, yeah, thinking about it, I should have said…”
And, in the moment, Tony was so overwhelmed with feeling that he almost threw his arms around her – it was only that she kept talking.
And he couldn’t see any imminent danger from Peirce. He couldn’t think of any threat that couldn’t wait until after he’d left the room and better assessed the situation.
Even time travel hadn’t given him the chance to relive his life. It wouldn’t undo his mistakes, or erase his trauma, or rid him of any one of his regrets

At the time, Steve had been too focused on the individual challenges to think about the bigger picture. He
it. He loved being able to run through that list and tick every one of them off, the happy shiver that ran through him with everything he never had to be scared of again. Now he could consciously appreciate
It was that the guilt, and the confusion, were every bit as loud and as constant as the joy and the excitement - which made the whole thing one hell of a din, to be honest.
But Steve didn’t have time to process any of that before Tony was bounding playfully towards him. By the time he’d been distracted by the way Tony moved, and that rush of fondness for him, Steve’s arms were already opening…
Other Steve were to just wake up in a carefully selected, sparsely populated town on the icy shores of Northern Canada, with no memory of the crash or how the hell he acquired the new white suit or the cryptic message... Yeah, there would be questions. Steve was sure his younger self would be confused about what happened, that he would always wonder. And obviously, his superiors would probably never stop investigating…
“I honestly don’t know if that makes me feel better or worse” Steve exhaled. Then he looked at Tony’s screen. “What did you get.”
And just as the struggle to put his finger on it was becoming sharply frustrating, Tony found the answer for him
Immediately, another envelope was being pushed into his hands. Tony was pretty sure it was Zan who’d thrust it at him, but he’d had only the briefest of glimpses before she’d sprinted up along the corridor and out of sight.
“What’ve you done to him?” Tony demanded, his voice darker now, his grip tightening pointedly. His legs were already tensed to move, the second he got the information he wanted-
And then the disorienting sensation that briefly confused him, as his wrist fell free of the restraint.
Steve let go of a soft, pleading sigh, leaning into Tony, his hand melting closer to him, like he was desperately offering himself up – but he knew he couldn’t push forward and take.
“It’s not that you can’t be angry, or that you’re wrong to get upset,” he started softly, speaking only to Steve - while Bruce spoke to Clint in the same low murmur at the other end of the table, saying something about everyone taking some space, something that Steve couldn’t make out over the buzz of shocked silence.
Steve was shocked out of his train of thought when he found Nat and Sam just standing in the breakroom. They looked up at him in unison, and then glanced at each other. Steve felt himself bracing for something before he could process what he was looking at.
And problems that weren’t worth dwelling on, because it was perfectly obvious that all of the potential research on this project was going to be in paper form. He already knew that no one would’ve digitized any of this information -
expect Tony to say sorry that T’Challa spent two days trying to hunt down Bucky and kill him, for a crime he didn’t even commit – that would be
He caught Steve’s gaze as settled himself between Steve’s legs and pushed up against his rim - and kept it, pointedly, as he pushed inside him, and slowly filled him up.
“Agent Fury said to bring this to you, Sir,” he said, dropping his eyes as he held the case out for Steve to take. Something about that sentence annoyed Steve before he’d bothered to listen to it - but he did his best to relax his posture, and soften his voice, when he told the agent,
there, when SHIELD – and it wasn’t like I didn’t know things, like I hadn’t already been uncomfortable about Phase Two or Operation Insight, but I’d just thought, surely someone must be the good guys, and then I just let that… Bucky was there for
Tony Stark either. This immediate interest, and this intense attraction, were just as irrational. In the interest of being fair, Steve also had to note that Stark
“Yeah… so, he wants you to ‘work on the Tesseract project’?” Steve asked. “That’s all he said about it?”
“Well, I don’t know if I am happy about it, really,” Tony confessed. “Although don’t ask me why I’m not, cos I don’t know why I wouldn’t be… But it sounds like it should be a good thing, right?”
“...Apologising to me for things you didn’t do to me. Look, I’m - sorry, I am, and this isn’t… I just… If you have things you wished you’d said to your friend before he died, then I
There was a pregnant pause. He could feel the first two guards holding their breath under his hands.
Tony had untied and retied that string maybe ten times already… by now, he had his favourites among the pages they contained. And he knew it was silly to keep going back to those same lines over and over, when he had other things to read – when, of all the things he’d read, those letters probably had the least useful details…
And yes, there was a little surge of dizziness, as Tony asked himself where to begin - but it was nowhere near as overwhelming as it had been. He didn’t know whether he’d lost patience with himself or finally worked through the shock… Or simply remembered who the fuck he was now.
“Oh, hang on, I remember the edible bubbles,” Bucky said, narrowing his eyes, “like, floaty, cotton-candy things,” and then a thought occurred to him, and he looked up at Sam. “Were you and Rhodey on a boat?”
it necessarily mean he’d done something unethical, simply because he wouldn’t have admitted it to Thor? Did he have to accept that everyone else’s emotional reactions were objectively valid, just to take them into account? Wasn’t it at least
“Well, I’m still sorry…” Bucky sighed. And then, before Tony could contradict him, he went on, “That’s not why I’m here, though.”
was doing that to him… And, as much as it should’ve been a relief to have an explanation, it was mainly just terrifying to think it could happen again...
“Oh, like noticing all the details in the different flowers?” Steve suggested, in a burst of enlightenment.
“I love you Tony, I’ve always loved you, I’ve always wanted you,” Steve promised, accenting every statement with another kiss, his touches still eager and possessive. When Tony wriggled back against him there was a new kind of thrill, an unlimited delight in what was rather than an excited desperation for what could be. His body was still loose and soft and sensitive, completely open to the sensations that simply ran through him now. Revelling in the way Steve’s perfect muscles tensed under his hands, and the sound of his urgent panting, and the feeling of his cock pressed hard against Tony’s thigh, all without any urgency towards anything. Teasingly, he ran a fingertip over the curve of Steve’s waist, playfully tugging at the waistband of his underwear. A little rivet of exhilaration squirmed in Tony’s stomach when Steve’s breath hitched… He
“We call this a soft room” Maribelle explained, as they all carefully stepped across the springy floor.

was the bit that stopped you trusting me or wanting me on this team. I thought if I could convince you it wasn’t just arrogance or… that I wasn’t opposed to regulation, or, I don’t know I just…”
...The endlessly expanding technical map that Tony was putting together. The one that filled Steve with such an excited sense of optimism, even though it kind of went over his head…
of Steve’s shirts are two sizes too small, and all of my zippers stop here, for some reason,” she jabbed at her own chest, right above her cleavage. “...And, uh, I don’t think they’re familiar with the concept of ‘toning it down’ on Bulsara, so everything is very sparkly and bright - but the pants all have legs, and stuff. Like, it’s not
“Why didn’t you tell me?” He asked again, more gently. More fragile. He looked up to see Steve melting under the heat of his own shame.
“So, you sent in an undercover…?” Nat prompted. And Nick’s face softened into something more professional – something almost sympathetic.
“Adam and his company came here to collect samples, and run experiments, and they found that there might be the potential to create recreational drugs without the side effects – that’s it, that’s all.”
Steve wasn’t sure when that had happened, or quite how he’d gotten here - but here he was. Trying not to grin too broadly at the pretty boy he liked.
hadn’t been there in New York, then that nuke would’ve gone off, and all those people would’ve died. There was no one else that could’ve – that would’ve thought of… And, I’m not saying I did nothing. I just know that, if I hadn’t been there… You’d have made it work, somehow. As long as
“Initiate the what? The transfer?” He demanded. “What does that mean?” Scaramouche held his palms up in a placating gesture.
He did glance up, briefly, when he heard the two of them step into the workshop. He caught a glimpse of Barnes, and the shadow of Rogers, just a generic shape behind him – Tony looked away before he could take in any more detail.
that fantasy where he did… Now there was no further function, there was nothing outside of this moment. Now, Tony was just thinking of the things he wanted to say – chasing this building excitement, just the same as he would if he had chosen to fuck Steve instead.
The defensiveness in him, because he’d been surrounded by people who demanded explanations, asked him to live up to an expectation he’d been burdened with since birth, held him to different standards and never let him win…
, and I know I’ve been… ignoring everything, and… selfish.” Steve recognised, as he said it. And Bucky rolled his eyes, but Steve pressed on with it. “I know a lot’s going on with you right now, and you probably feel like I haven’t even noticed. And I know I’m asking for a lot, and not even telling you what it’s about. And… I just want you to know, whatever…
The second before Tony took that first mouthful seemed to stretch on forever, while Steve continued to look without looking as though he was looking…
apparently been listening to, hours earlier… So, now it annoyed Steve that Tony pretended to be completely self-absorbed in group settings. That he was, in fact, fully aware of the people he was completely ignoring-

Or, maybe Steve really thought he was telling the truth – maybe Steve really did feel an overwhelming, entirely irrational draw toward Tony… In which case, there was clearly something very creepy going on. And that would’ve meant Steve
And then he glanced down at Steve – who looked so honestly devastated that Tony completely lost his train of thought.
“And, you know how, you really don’t blame me for finding it hard to apologise… But you still know I have to?” Steve added… And Tony had clearly recognised the tone Steve was using, the fact that he was building to something here… so, he stilled just slightly, and he simply nodded, and waited.
Steve’s blood flared up to the surface of his skin as he let that sentence run through his head again… For some reason, it struck him as the most intimate thing that he’d ever heard Tony say.
“So, it’s a problem somewhere else entirely?” Steve asked from somewhere behind him. Tony made himself think very hard about the issue at hand when he answered.
A flare of heat scorched up Steve’s back and then consumed him, pulling his skin tighter, tensing his muscles into this compulsive feeling-
Well, no, that wasn’t entirely true – part of Tony wanted to crawl into Steve’s arms and bury his head in Steve’s neck and ask him to drown out all those words…
“I understand,” Steve smiled. Hoping he didn’t sound as Dr Phil as he thought he did. “Maybe we should talk about this later. When you’ve had some time to think, I mean.” And Tony smiled – the first smile that had seemed genuine since he woke up – and nodded.
“You liked the chains.” He whispered – not a question. And God, he actually saw the way Steve’s eyes darkened, he saw the way his breath shocked still in his chest. The way he swallowed softly before he answered, so quietly that Tony barely heard him,
“Steve, I want you, please,” he begged, breathlessly, as Steve carried on kissing his throat. He could feel Steve smiling against his skin.
“I’m dressed like a giant rainbow mirror ball,” Sam reminded him incredulously, pointing down at the ceremonial robes - which, of course, caught the sunlight again, triggering another frantic raft of shhhing and arm flapping from Tony and Bucky. “Well, there you go,” Sam whispered. “You can’t
. And Tony smiled so sweetly that it turned Steve’s stomach to water, and kissed him again, very softly, just once, before laying his head in Steve’s lap.
Somehow, Steve knew that revelation would persist, even after his temper had worn off - like his optimism had prevailed in spite of his temper, the last time.
“And yet you’re in such a good mood….” He observed, raising an eyebrow. Tony just carried on smiling. And then he turned, and retrieved a card from the countertop, and handed it to Steve with a flourish. Steve shot him a playful look, before he glanced down at it…
the issues with getting the authorities involved…. The higher moral responsibility they had – the buck that couldn’t be passed, whatever a law said about it.
So, he’d hidden in the shadows, making sure to stay out of sight of Peter Quill, until he could be completely sure that he’d missed a version of Rhodey and Nebula that he wasn’t sure would be turning up at all.
written on there – and next to them, there were those little patterns of squares-” And he fixed Tony with a knowing look “
“Well, so, for one thing… It turns out I’m in love with Steve Rogers. And, okay, I think I already knew that, but, I don’t know, that’s kind of just hit me… what with the fact that I slept with him last night, and all… And you know, I feel like that really would’ve been enough. Like, figuring out I’d fallen in love, and then the fact that I actually slept with the guy, would be enough for one day, you know?” He demanded of no one in particular. “I mean, let’s be honest -
And as the heat of Steve’s fear was about to melt into a tearful sadness, Tony looked up at him again.
be panicking now, that this should all be so much harder to say. But, when Steve looked at him like that…
“And I think we need to go down and have a look.” Tony finished his little presentation, triumphantly. And Steve nodded.
And then he gave up with an impatient shake of his head, and focused his expression again, and took another determined breath-
it unfair, to hold Steve responsible for the hurt he’d caused rather than the things he’d done? To hold Steve to a higher standard because Tony loved him more, trusted him more,
“Oh, I said I’d do it,” Bucky waved the enquiry aside – and when Steve frowned at him, he explained. “Well, it doesn’t take the whole team to storm a warehouse and take a computer. Nick asked for two volunteers, so I said I’d go with Sam.”
“But that doesn’t change the fact that we have to start thinking about Loki,” Tony continued, “and maybe this offer is part of that-”
that I will do it. Because I know this plan hasn’t been corrupted by the usual human failings. I know I haven’t been misled by false ideology, or false perceptions. I know I’m not motivated by irrational self-interest. I know I have planned for every part of this. So, you see, I don’t have to worry
But somewhere he thought maybe he’d made a last-ditch attempt to pull himself back. That maybe he remembered
He had never been able to put together a comprehensive map of Bucky’s movements in the first timeline, but Steve was almost certain that he should be in the States by now - he was
That, actually, both of them were still naked, and sticky… that his clothes were likely stretched or even torn… and he couldn’t remember about Tony’s… That, all in all, they should probably put some active thought into their situation before the recovery team made it down to the second floor.
On any other night, Steve would have been habitually checking the exits and listening out for unusual noises, without even realising it. However familiar his surroundings, no matter how much he trusted the people he was with, there would still have been a little store of tension in his shoulders, just in case.
,” he begged, simply because it was the one thing he knew the name for. The only way he could think to explain,
He felt Steve smile against his lips, surprised, before he melted into it, one hand coming to rest softly at the small of Tony’s back. A wave of heat rolled up Tony’s neck, that dizzy elation tightening in the pit of his gut, becoming something else…
It was a private stretch of beach, obviously – although, in all likelihood, they’d stay away from it anyway. For all Tony’s careful politicking, and all the diplomatic progress they were making, Steve and his team were still technically wanted criminals. Tony hadn’t received any written assurances on what would happen if any of them turned themselves in… or got spotted while walking along the ocean. So, even though Tony had booked the most remote location imaginable, even though they’d both gone to such lengths to cover their tracks, it was probably still sensible to stay in the villa for the week…
as he probably should be…But thinking about what was going to happen next, what all those ‘things that had happened’ might mean now…
By now Tony’s cock was throbbing with a low, constant ache, the pressure building in the small of his back, his entire body trying to push itself forward - the
trust him again. I don’t think anyone said that to Bruce. I don’t suppose Pepper or Rhodey said it to Tony, when he lied to them about his Palladium poisoning, or the fact that he was still building suits. I don’t think he ever told
His concerns for Bucky had been playing in the back of his mind the whole time, and there had been that consistent compulsion to go to him, like an itch he was trying to ignore…
“Well, assuming we can figure out how to, and unless we have any evidence that it’d be a moral problem to do that, then yeah – unless you’ve got a better idea?” And it did sound like a genuine, well intentioned question. Which Steve just answered.
. If nothing else, it was easier to follow a pattern, to do what they always did because that meant they didn’t have to think about what they were doing. Moments like this were always about meeting a specific need, easing a particular pain. Whatever got it done.
“Yeah, I was tempted,” he muttered, self-consciously. “But, you know, what with all the time and effort you just put into fixing his arm, it seemed kinda rude to tear it off and beat him to death with it.”
For a moment they just held one another, joined in this moment of quiet closeness - and Steve knew, whatever happened now, he would always have a truly perfect moment to hold on to.
, when Steve kissed his neck. It sent shivers all the way through him; it made him want to curl in on himself with the intensity of it. And then Steve kissed him again, soft and deep, just under his ear, and his throat again, and then the curve where his neck met his shoulder… Tony just turned to water, his arms falling uselessly against the bed as Steve kissed his chest, and his arms. Steve’s hands caressed firmly over Tony’s ribs, and then his hips – and then suddenly they were on Tony’s belt, and then his zipper, and then one hand was sliding under the waistband of his underwear.
Out of nowhere, he found himself wondering how that Steve’s life might be changed when he discovered that SHIELD had ‘lost’ his Captain America suit.
As indescribably wonderful as it was to finally drink from Steve, as intense as the euphoria was this time… Still, nothing compared to the sense of fulfilment, the pure joy, of looking after him afterwards.
And, of course, she nodded sharply, immediately keen to comply – Tony suspected it would’ve been exactly the same, whether they’d had the drugs or not. Steve shot Tony a quick glance of confirmation before he whispered,
catch him – he put those impossible arms around him, and held him flush against that strong, solid chest, and
That little voice that might well have been whispering since he was a child… that voice he hadn’t heard, since then.
of panicking over his fatal illness. And because of all that, you so confidently committed acts of torture, and kidnap, and threatening to kill him, always so sure that you were the good guy in that situation. Well, guess what Nick?” And he leaned in just a little closer, for emphasis. “You are guilty of everything you hate Tony Stark for, and so much worse. If anyone needs to be put in their place for being arrogant and reckless, it’s you. If anyone needs to be shown that they’re not as smart as they think they are, it’s you. And if anyone deserves to have their apartment bugged, or all of their friends turn out to be spies, it’s you. However.”
one lie – and I meant it when I said I was sorry. I know you were right. I just… when I went to explain
Steve looked down on the photographer, lying prone on the gravel of the driveway, the fragments of his camera arranged in a jagged halo around his head… He was sure that he
In fact, he was so far through the process that there was a strange, strangled noise as he swallowed it down - loud enough that Rhodey snorted in surprise. Tony clenched his jaw shut and looked down at the floor in a way that probably wasn’t at all subtle-
He knew he’d have to tackle it at some point... but he was also trying to calm himself down, and make all of this more manageable - so he could just about convince himself that it was
Tony, who had only grown stronger and braver since the time Steve met him, with whom he’d built something so unique and beautiful… And he thought about taking him to that bunker.
By now, Tony had his face buried in his hands, laughing so hard that his shoulders were shaking… And Steve felt a fit of giggles growing under his words, just at how
hadn’t snapped and demanded an answer about it, he never would’ve told me about Operation Insight, either.”
He’d expected it to take a lot longer. And be a lot more difficult. And he’d never expected to come up with anything on this scale.
“Still no comment,” Steve sighed, pulling a carton of yesterday’s Chinese takeout from the back of the fridge.
He could actually see Tony building those walls up again, right in front of his eyes… A wall of sadness and loss and
...It was a rather different proposition for Tony. Steve was asking Tony to take a step into this macabre world, to take on those uncertainties and risks, on the promise that Steve would love him more than any other person in the world-
And then he heard the slick, wet sound of skin on skin, and looked up to see Steve running his hand over his own cock.
He sat down beside Steve, quiet for a moment. Steve didn’t fill it with anything. It hung in the air like a disease.
And then he’d left Steve’s space as quickly as he’d stepped into it, hand still curled around Steve’s as he tugged him off the desk. “Food,” he declared with a nod, tongue poking out just for a moment in order to trace the taste of Steve’s mouth on his lips.
“The whole ‘oh, I’m Tony Stark and I can do what I want because no one explicitly told me otherwise’ thing,” Steve said harshly, standing up from the desk and walking over to him. His eyes were slightly bloodshot, confirming that he hadn’t been getting much sleep.  “Do you know how worried I was? I was Goddamn seconds away from going out there and looking for you myself. I called seven times, Tony, and you didn’t answer.”
“We’ll find a vehicle.” That was Steve, always unwilling to give up, even when Thor and Hulk couldn’t make it over, even when they’d been stuck down in a fucking basement sitting on their useless asses for twenty minutes while someone or something had undoubtedly stormed their tower and taken their little boy from them. “Hawkeye, Nat, is there-- is there
Clint pulled out 6 slips of paper, waving them around in the air. “Six motherfucking Hamilton tickets, that’s what! Funny story about how I got them, actually- I was just minding my own business, making my way back from SHIELD, when I saw this family getting held up by a group of assholes. Of course, ‘cause I’m a brilliant and generally well-rounded individual-”
, and I was just thinking..." he broke off, shaking his head. " -And yeah. I was an asshole and I shouldn’t have-“
Slowly, he walked further forward. The bags crinkled conspicuously as he moved, and he became unerringly aware of it. Tony always seemed to make something in him nervous. Like his mind could instinctively sense the chaos there.
“Home sweet home,” Tony declared, cutting the engine and sliding off. Immediately, his hands went out to Steve, “now, are you gonna fall on your ass again, or have you learnt how to dismount a bike properly?”
“Not in my head there wasn’t,” Tony said bitterly, “I wasn’t thinking about any of that. I was thinking about him, hitting me for no other fucking reason than because he thought I deserved it, and you not believing me if I told you. That was… that wasn’t something I wanted to have to cope with, and so I just. Didn’t.”
when you do this sort of stuff,” Steve hissed at him, his fingers digging into Tony’s arms painfully. “You just do whatever the fuck you see fit, never taking into consideration how it could affect other people. I was scared
Another second for him to have that thought, and he might have already opened the door and made everything worse. He tightened his fist to the point where it began to throb and then lowered it back to his side, jaw clenched and heart beating furiously as he stumbled away. He hadn’t thought it through. Hadn’t thought any of it through. Again, fucking selfish- so desperate to just see Tony that he hadn’t even thought about how that might affect the man. What the fuck was wrong with him?
“Good morning beloved,” he responded with ease, tapping the razor against the sink and shutting it off. He was still wearing his pajamas- the pants too low and exposing the wonderful V of his hips that peaked out under his slightly-too-small MIT sweater he’d had for however many years. He looked like he’d had a good night’s sleep, which made a nice change. “I have a wonderfully, beautifully free day today, and so I have decided to spend it in a wise and responsible way, as any Avenger should.”
It was wonderful. Steve was almost sorry when they finally arrived at their destination eight hours later.
Steve leaned away a fraction and looked at him, his gaze flicking down to the purple bags which circled Tony’s eyes. He frowned. “You been sleeping?” He asked, and from the way his face was set, Tony figured he probably already knew the answer.
The process of going through someone else’s phone with a fine-tooth comb was exhausting and kind of uncomfortable. The woman, who Tony found out had been called Doctor Amelia Lewinsky, seemed to use the phone for both personal and work reasons. There were a few photos in her gallery of selfies she’d taken, views she’d thought were pretty. It was weird, Tony thought—like rifling through a box of memories owned by a ghost. Nevertheless, he persisted onward, searching every detail of the device in order to try and get his hands on something useful. And luckily it wasn’t too long before his work bore the fruits of success. A link in a (badly) encrypted email, leading to a download of a single ZIP file. “Throw it up on the big screen, J,” he said absently, waving a hand and watching the information appear up on his holographic interface. Once opened, that was where he hit jackpot. There were reams and reams of data; videos and statements and audio recordings, all filed under ‘Project SUHU’. Tony leaned in close to the screen. He could spend the whole night going through this and still not get even half-way through. Luckily, however, there was a rather handy place for him to start. One file was titled ‘Vidlog: SUHU R&D’. Tony figured that was a good way to get an overview.
Tony gasped, because air wouldn’t come, air never fucking came properly any more, and his heart just hurt, like a constant pain where Steve and Clint and Natasha and-
“Hey, he’s here, isn’t he?” Bucky said, eyes widening. Steve continued to look sullen, he huffed in exasperation. “Look, Stevie, whether it’s true or not- the point is he’s sat on your couch right this minute and you can start falling at my feet in thanks any moment now-“
“Right, yes, yes, okay,” Tony paused, and took a breath before looking Steve in the eye. “Let me come with you?”
time- if he was useless without the suit, it wouldn’t be long before they decided he was just useless altogether. Rhodey was a better Iron Man than him, true, but Tony was far too selfish to give it up. He needed to fix himself before it was too late, and they all realised how much better things probably were without him.
Tony thought vaguely, falling on to all fours as he gagged up the phantom water that he could feel crawling up his throat.
He looked behind him again, just for a second as he sprinted up toward Thanos, and privately thanked Wanda for being brave enough to do something he never could.
Tony couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t do anything. He felt a drop of coffee on his wrist from where he’d thrown the mug trickle down his index finger and build at the tip. Steve was still looking at him with that broken, broken face as he cried silently.
“Okay,” he stammered, not looking Steve in the eye as he opened and shut his mouth, checking for fractures or breaks, “okay, okay, I’m sorry. Sorry. Okay.”
“They’ve hit a non-combatant SHIELD facility, so it’s not weapons. Next guess is information. Or tech.”
With nothing else to do, Steve sat on the floor next to Tony’s head, his neck resting on the couch cushions as he stared at the opposite wall and counted down until the next hour, when he’d wake Tony up. At some point twenty or so minutes in, he had the sense to text Sam and let him know what was going on, and also give Sam’s parents a message too. He doubted he’d be getting home tonight.
Steve looked horrifiedly at the boy squirming excitedly in his hands for a few seconds, before sighing in relief and placing him back down on the floor, where he instantly began running back to the tv in the living room, still full of energy in a way only kids that age were.
“— I love you,” Steve interrupted him, seemingly out of nowhere, taking his hand from the air and then pressing his mouth against the back of it. Tony quietened, his face softening as Steve smiled and shook his head. “Just thought you should know.”
Steve came back five minutes later with a plate of banana slices and a water bottle- but no matter how hard they both attempted to wrangle some of the food into the little boy's mouth, he solidly refused to comply. By the twenty-minute mark, Tony was ready to start banging his head against the wall, and it seemed Steve was three seconds away from calling homeland security on the baby. How did parents do this shit? Robots, Tony could understand. They had their own language, they were logical beings with set commands and needs. This little thing in his arms? Nothing. Screaming was not a language! How were they supposed to communicate with nothing but loud-pitched wailing noises?
He froze, blinking a few times and trying to work out what Tony was saying whilst his buddies all sniggered behind him. Of course, he wasn’t stupid- he worked it out a second later and took a shocked step backward.
So he spent twenty minutes methodically cleaning up the bathroom, making sure there was not a speck of red amongst the floor and pretending like he couldn’t feel his jaw throbbing in pain. It was stiffening up and he needed to get some ice for it, but he couldn’t go downstairs. The team were downstairs and they’d ask, and Tony didn’t know what to say to them. He couldn’t say Steve had hit him- that was too incriminating and, and out-of-context, and anyway, none of them would believe him anyway, because it was Steve.
It never changed. The same thing, over and over and over. Tony got into these shitty situations, and whatever he chose to do, it was always the wrong decision. Now Steve and the rest of the team could barely even look him in the eye, and all Tony could think was
“Thank you,” he choked, and then walked over to the elevator without another word. He could feel her eyes on his back as he moved, and pondered on what it was she was thinking. Maybe she was debating whether she should call Steve’s team. Or take him down herself.
He trailed off into a sharp inhale as Steve moved again and started sucking on his neck, and Steve grinned a little against his skin, letting his hands move from Tony’s shoulders to his chest to his waist before stopping at his shirt, giving an experimental tug. They were home alone, as per usual whenever Steve visited Tony’s place- he’d said Howard was on a 2 week business trip- and so that meant they had the whole house to themselves, for the whole night.
Steve raised a small, knowing eyebrow over to Tony. “Oh, who would’ve thought?” He asked, smiling. Tony just rolled his eyes and then leaned into him as Steve got down on his haunches, looking at the giant mound of cotton and softness that pretty much towered over them. “How does a house even have this many fucking pillows?” He asked Thor incredulously.
Both Clint and Sam raised their hands in submission. “Yeah, man, totally,” Clint hurried to assure him, “like, good for you, waiting ‘til you’re ready and stuff, that’s absolutely-“
Another silence. Steve moved his foot and accidentally sent one of the grocery bags tumbling. He shut his eyes and pursed his lips, ignoring it. Tony was still staring.
Their room was quiet when he arrived, wearily tugging off his tie and dropping his briefcase at the door. He thought Steve was still puttering around in the tower somewhere, until a minute or so later when he heard a brief trickle of water and looked up. The door to their bathroom was slightly cracked open and he peered through it, realising that Steve was actually in the bath, bubbles piled high around him as he relaxed heavily into the edges, eyes shut and beautifully serene. Tony smiled and padded forward, knocking a few times against the door before wandering in. “Good morning, beloved,” he said, hearing the exhaustion in his own voice.
That certainly caught everyone’s attention. Even Tony sat up a little straighter. Hamillton tickets were like
“I’d actually love to have a family,” someone behind him said, and Tony jumped a mile in the air as he twisted his body and looked at Steve in surprise. The man was stood at the door, leaning into it with his hands shoved awkwardly into his pockets. Tony hadn't even heard home come through the door. He forgot how quiet Steve could be when he wanted it.
And Tony could stand up in the face of the biggest, richest men on the planet and tell them where they could shove it, sure, but he could not last two seconds of Steve looking like that. Not even when he was wasted.
Steve rolled his eyes fondly, but eventually he walked forward and then reached out his own hand until their fingers joined together. With a surprising amount of force for someone so exhausted, Tony pulled him into his arms and then curled around him, burying his nose into Steve’s neck. He felt as those long eyelashes fluttered closed against his jaw, and Steve knew that it wasn’t going to be long until Tony was clocked out again.
Steve raised his eyebrows. The twenty unopened texts from Bucky probably read something along those lines, then. “Can’t say I did, but I’m not surprised. They’ve been gazing at one another since the day they were introduced.”
“Look,” Tony whispered, and Steve pulled himself from his own thoughts as the other boy nodded behind Steve, “the sun’s just starting to set.”
Well. Good mood felt a little bit like an understatement. He felt on top of the fucking world, more like.
She looked straight at the camera, eyes watery, lip quivering. Tony could sense the fear, ripping out of her in waves. “I know what this means for me,” she whispered, “I know what AIM do to traitors. But maybe… my soul for his. That won’t grant me a place in heaven, God no, but it will clear my conscience a little. So I’m taking him to New York. I’ll see if I can get in touch with someone who knows where to keep him. Or maybe I’ll leave him with the Avengers. They’ve always been good at fucking up everything we do here. Anyway… this’ll probably be my last log. I’m putting all the information in a ZIP file on my mobile. If anyone is watching this…”
The mission had been long and tiring and ultimately worthless. They’d lost anyway- too many people had died for it to be anything worth celebrating. Steve could still see some of their faces if he thought about it too hard- looking at him, pleading with him.
Still seeming almost dazed, Steve just nodded. “Yeah, I like the idea. I think… As long as you keep yourself safe, and everyone involved safe, I think it would be good.” He wiped a hand over his face and then chuckled. “You’re something else, Tony Stark.”
Steve bit his lip and looked at the unconscious man lying on the cot in front of him. Absently, he brushed the sweaty hair off his face with a finger, curling it behind his ear and then dropping his hand until it settled over the arc reactor. He could feel Bruce’s gaze on him, but didn’t bother to comment on it. He was just so goddamn glad that they were all safe. It was more than he could ever have hoped for. “I could carry him back down the mountain,” he tried, but even then, he knew it wasn’t going to work. The terrain was too dangerous, made even worse by lack of light. Tony was too weak to cope with something like that. “God, fuck, we need to get out of here.”
him. He might not like any of the things Steve had planned. He might react in ways that Steve didn’t want or expect…
“What, you’re too good to wear dumpster clothes?” Bucky teased, while he was tying the sheet over his shoulder, like a toga.
“Oh, you needn’t worry - these are designed as ‘testing samples’” Dr Arden placated. “The effects are quite mild, and quite short lived. And the flowers can’t cause you any harm of any kind.”
But the only other outcome was that Tony carried on down this oblivious, self-destructive path. Talking to Steve without thinking it through, walking around without his guard up – letting himself get carried away in daydreams about Steve, without ever preparing himself for the day he lost him.
And then Steve felt Tony shiver, as a cool breeze rolled over the garden. He broke the kiss, letting Tony shift so that he could sit more comfortably in his lap while he made an awkward lean for his jacket-
Every time he tried to sit down he’d feel his heartbeat building up under his ribs again, pushing more and more energy into his over tense muscles, until it became painful to try and contain it. He’d straightened his shirt so many times that the skin under his collar was starting to feel sore. Even the slow breaths he forced himself to take trembled with excitement.
of chairs being moved, the gentle rain-like patter of fingers on keyboards. Steve repeatedly scanned the corridor, one end to the other, trying to think of what he would say if he were caught here like this… But then, at the fifth door, he got lucky. The sound of silence. And then, when he nudged the door open-
But, after a while – and two cups of coffee – he did start to feel slightly more human. He began to appreciate the effects of a good night’s sleep, to recognise that he was at least less tense and tired than he had been the day before. That was something.
“...I keep getting this strange impulse to touch you,” Tony muttered shyly, his eyes firmly locked on Steve’s hand, still curled protectively around his. “Not even in a… I don’t even mean like
I love him…” Tony went on, carefully – pleased by the way Rhodey’s smile warmed, as he spoke. “I don’t think this would’ve happened if it weren’t for him… But I
“...Well, yeah, obviously,” Scott stammered, throwing a helpless glance in Sam’s direction. “I mean, without him, time travel is just the fevered dream of a madman, right? And yeah, that’s one of those things they said couldn’t be done, and he’s the one who made it work-”
But that was an old instinct, right? A hangover from when he’d felt like he couldn’t talk to Tony about anything… He’d spent years worrying that, if he were ever genuinely nice to Tony, and honest about his qualities, it would give him away somehow, make everything complicated, lead him into a conversation he wouldn’t know how to finish or get out of… And he was still in that habit, apparently.
Tony had time to process the news, long before they ever met. He would have had any immediate personal reactions in private. He had a chance to build his defences and put his mask up.
And out of nowhere an idea just lodged itself into Steve’s head, and took root. A random drunken insight, nurtured by a false confidence and an inebriated sense of entitlement.
And then he’d yelled at Steve for not making more effort. For not being the one to ring the phone once he’d sent it-
he’d talked to her, and the way he’d slotted her out of the situation, and the confusion she would’ve felt at his behaviour… and, really, those were all things that he should have fixed a long time ago. Things that wouldn’t have happened, if Tony had let her be a
It occurred to Steve that he never thought he’d watch Tony and Bucky talking as inconsequentially as that… that, thinking about it, he never thought he’d see them take on Peter and Shuri in a water balloon fight…
He remembered how it felt to have more anger than he had strength to act on it. To be filled with such outraged disgust at some injustice or cruelty, and have no outlet for it. To already know, as he was clenching his fist, that he
meant a lot of what he’d said in that fantasy room. Some of it he should have said to other people. He’d used bad examples for some of it, and he’d let genuine points get exaggerated into something else – he’d allowed ‘you should apologise for some of those choices’ to become ‘you reckless, stupid bastard’… He’d let a legitimate criticism of Steve’s judgement get boiled down to one – arguably unfair – point about Scott Lang’s criminal record… He’d said ‘I am angry’ when he’d
He’d sort of worked out both of those things, in the last few seconds – whatever this was, it was far bigger… of a different thing
“You running a stress test on the building foundations?” Tony sang from the doorway, in lieu of an actual greeting.
And it occurred to Tony that… They’d always had so much in common. He’d just always been too preoccupied with the differences to pay attention to that. He’d never sat there and listed
want to be informed before you let anyone into the house – and I have plenty of people to try and make friends for me, thanks. Don’t think I don’t know what you just did.”
As Tony considered the wisdom in that, a waiter appeared on the other side of the table, water jug in hand. Their eyes met, and then the waiter nodded politely towards Tony’s glass - and Tony was briefly amused to think that those gestures were so universal as to be recognised in an alien realm… By a waiter wearing a glittery waistcoat and… speedos...
Tony’s actual reaction was an immediate, blind panic, as he recognised that Nick was obviously talking about the Tesseract-
Which meant Tony would have to wait a few minutes for the effects to take hold and level out. There was just no other way.

interested in ‘uncovering the truth about his dad’ - because in all this time, he’d still made no progress with it. He’d learned a lot of very mundane details about a few non-essential projects that his father worked on in the forties and fifties, and that was about it.
“Yeah, I said that,” Steve smiled, his attention drifting back to the gauntlet again. “I mean, I mentioned it once, when Nick was talking about the computer simulations SHIELD used to run. I asked if anyone bothered building any of this stuff…. He said ‘we’ve moved on’, or something.”
“...Why are you wearing a toga?” He asked. Bucky groaned heavily, throwing his arms out as he visibly struggled to find a response-
In fact, there wasn’t any time left at all. He would have to face the music now, whether he knew what to say or not.
“What’s wrong?” He asked - with none of the defensiveness or subtle accusation that Tony was used to hearing. With such genuine, gentle care for him… It was enough to make Tony smile, in spite of what he had to say.
They gave it two seconds, checked that everyone still had their gaze averted, and sprinted up the stairs before anyone’s fear of being involved was overcome by their curiosity.
“...And then I started wondering if they’d bugged my house,” Tony carried on explaining himself - which only added to Steve’s heartbreak over the whole thing. “And then I started wondering if they were following me, and then I started thinking that maybe they bugged
“What now?” Steve whispered – for no other reason than he liked being able to say it. He liked not having to find that answer for everyone else, not having to pretend he already knew…
fears… Tony hadn’t faced those himself yet. Tony wasn’t sure he wanted to face them, ever – he couldn’t bear Steve to know them. He couldn’t stand the thought of Steve trying to argue with them, of having to
“Or, I mean, I can come tonight,” Steve rescued him. “Sorry, I know you always said night time was better…”
Tony sighed, heavily. Already dreading the tedious reasoning he’d have to go through, to make Bucky see the real risks of letting people get too close… But not in the same way he usually did. It didn’t seem quite as… inevitable, as it usually did. It felt more like the start of a conversation than the delivery of a statement
That, yeah, maybe Steve liked him well enough – and maybe that was enough for someone like Steve to take an interest, to want to help… to maybe get a bit too invested. And, if that was the case, maybe Tony could’ve made him see that he’d gotten carried away, that he’d offered too much of himself – that he couldn’t commit to helping every nice-enough stranger like this, and that was okay.
He was somewhat anxious, as he thought back to it – fearful that he’d suddenly recognise an irrational, emotional response. In case he was about to realise that he’d just unfairly and indefensibly murdered someone…
Steve didn’t think about it. He tried not to think about anything. He just pushed himself up onto his hands and knees, parting his legs and
Steve broke into a delighted grin at the sound of his voice, and followed that instinctive draw towards him, picking his way through the debris until he found Tony at the back of the room, struggling to his feet amongst a spray of papers on the floor.
could still recall every detail of the mission, laid out like the bullet points of a battle plan. The emotional response was basically missing, save for the repeated tug towards Bucky and the stab of anger he got whenever he remembered someone going for Tony…
And then Tony took him deeper, forcing the head of Steve’s cock into his throat. An overwhelming heat flushed up through Steve’s muscles-
“And I’m sorry I said that about you tearing the Avengers apart – I didn’t mean that. I don’t… even remember saying that, I know that sounds… Awful, but I just… I
“Look, I’m sorry,” he huffed. “I really don’t mean it to sound like I’m laying into you, because I’m not. It’s just that… I care about you, and I’m just watching you mess this up - when you don’t have to. And it’s not just you. It’s not fair to
It carried on rolling through Tony’s ribs, reigniting itself every time he thought he had it under control, bubbling up again every time he heard Bucky lose it-
“Did he get mad at you?” Bucky pushed on, regardless. And, in spite of everything, Steve found himself answering,
“No, I know, that probably sounds really arrogant,” Tony cut him off with a wince. “And I don’t think I’m going to break your heart or anything - I don’t think I’m that important. I just mean… I mean, we work together, and we actually get on these days, and… I do like you… But none of that means we really know each other,” he sighed, resignedly. “You don’t know what a nightmare I am, for a start. You don’t know how bad I am in relationships of any kind, how many bad habits and character flaws I have-”
a bigger deal than I think it is… It’s the first thing I think of, when I wonder if we’re a war like people – do you ever wonder that? You know how Thor talks about whole planets as being peaceful, or warlike… do you ever think that human beings are actually one of the spiteful, selfish races, that we’re just wasting our whole lives to stop the Daleks killing each other?”
to be here. That this was the answer to every wordless question he’d ever asked himself, that this made sense of all that cruelty and confusion. And he knew he would never have been able to explain it, and it would’ve probably sounded dramatic and corny if he tried... But it was like he suddenly just
“Are you really?” Steve snapped back, with such force that everyone at the table sat upright in unison. Even Wanda’s expression flickered at what was clearly a most unexpected reaction-
“User 30251 has just accessed the system.” He observed, casually. “…And accessed a Dr Franciszek Kowalczyk’s file.”
“I really hope Zan has been distracted by something” Tony murmured eventually, his voice almost slurring, it was so warm and soft and happy. And Steve smiled into his hair, and hummed an agreement…
. And all the time we were teaching them, they were planning… They used what we’d taught them to weaponize our drugs, to make bastardised versions of them and artificially corrupt the effect of our eco-system. No one from Anni-Vara had ever thought to do that. None of us had any clue what harmful potential these drugs might have, or how they’d be prevented – why would we? And, just like that, our generations of expertise were worthless, and there was nothing we could do. They killed hundreds of people here in the city of Mallamen, and enslaved damn near everyone else. And then they founded this place, and made us develop drugs for the patrons, and help them analyse their data, and run their experiments. And we all know they’re working on something, that this is all part of a bigger project, with a single goal… but none of us know what it is. None of us ask, or try to work it out – because we can’t.”
… A place where he and Tony were together, and happy. Where Bucky was secure and supported - where maybe Tony and Bucky were friends. Somewhere Nat was still alive. A place where they beat Thanos the first time around, a place where time travel didn’t exist…
“I… don’t really know, to be honest with you,” Tony answered, dazed. “I, uh… It’s a… vampire, thing…I think.”
But he also knew he couldn’t take that choice away from Steve - certainly not before he’d given it any real thought, or bothered to discuss it.
“They- they sent a note, saying that they weren’t going to pay me and not to talk to anyone about it - it’s in the desk!” Wesley remembered, pointing frantically towards the corner of the room. “You-you can have it, take it, just take it.”
. He would’ve kept kissing him. He would’ve let Steve undress him. He’d have let Steve push him down on that couch and fuck him right there in front of everybody, he would’ve-
Tony hummed an appreciative smile as he moved his hand inside Steve, curling his knuckles against Steve’s rim every time he pulled out, letting the tips of his fingers graze over Steve’s prostate every time he pushed inside.
“Well, Bulsara is known as a place where people come to be happy,” Dr Arden answered with a knowing grin, “and lies and secrets don’t make anyone happy.”
He waits a moment longer, wondering if that familiarity will settle into place… and, instead, he works out what’s changed.
But now he felt like he was looking at her as she really was - not coloured by his loyalty to her, or his non-existent history with her, or even his more personal anger with her.
He knew that he’d just lived through a moment in which the thought of biting Steve felt totally natural.
knew that this connection was always there, that even their most mundane domestic exchanges were based on a deeper understanding than any human would know… But they were the same domestic exchanges as anyone else, none the less. Day to day, it was the same dynamic as their human relationship would have been, just better. They talked to one another, and worried about one another, and looked out for one another. Steve was as free and as comfortable giving his point of view as he would have been before, as concerned for Tony’s wellbeing as Tony was for his, every bit as responsible and as in control as Tony was…
“...No, nowhere near that long, I don’t think,” he replied carefully, raising an eyebrow. “I’ll probably be finished by eight… and then I guess it’s not worth starting anything else, so… We’ll get a couple of hours off,” he grinned. “Why?”
“Last night, I found a computer in an empty room, to attach the tracker” He explained, sounding somewhere between frustrated and weary. “And it had
“...So, yeah, it’s all pretty ridiculous,” Tony accepted, gesturing around them to illustrate the situation in general.
“Uh, well, I got frozen…” he answered, dazed… And then watched the knowing arch of the Red Skull’s brow, and knew - he already knew all of this.
So, to start with, there is no sexual contact in this scene, just in case anyone is going to be anxious reading it, wondering if it's going to turn that way - it's not.
When Tony glanced at him, Rhodey was wide eyed and sweating, his fingertips still digging into the upholstery like he was hanging on for dear life.
Whether or not he realised this at the time, Tony had been waiting all his life for someone who made him feel like this. Someone who made him feel safe enough to be soft. Someone who gave him the confidence to be as kind as he’d always wanted to be. Someone who wouldn’t belittle and dismiss his every gesture, or use it against him.
He recognised the heavy stickiness dripping down his neck… the little bead of come that was slowly working its way under the collar…
Whatever milestones and ceremonies and... changes, were still ahead of them, whatever serious conversations they were yet to have, whatever big decisions they still had to make-
A quick calculation told him that it would take longer to talk her out of it than to just drink a cup of tea.
. They’d never talked about any of that. Steve had just said he wanted to come home, and Tony had said that he didn’t want to hold onto the resentment, and that was supposed to be everything made better again…
And then at last there was that wave of pleasure that just carried on breaking, crashing through him, taking everything with it.
After which, there is some introspection and serious conversation about the relationship - and that *isn't* actually drug fucked, for once. After all those chapters where they're emotional, and only focusing on one part of it, and in the middle of a revelation... this is where I'm laying out how they actually feel, at this stage in their lives. So (I'm nervous as hell about this, but) just to put it into context.
life without any help what-so-ever, whilst never making a bad call or saying something stupid. They should listen to politicians and journalists and Nazi fucking super villains call them a disappointment, and never lose their composure. And
Steve didn’t even know he’d heard it. It was just another meaningless background noise, behind that incessant pounding that he didn’t know was his own heartbeat-
How lost and impotent he’d felt, in this strange and distance future. How much he’d wanted some sort of meaning in his life – some purpose beyond what Captain America stood for, something he could care about for
Steve literally had to take a moment, to recover from the release of that… And when he looked up, still smiling, he saw Tony smiling back at him- a little hint of a thought around his eyes.
“And, I mean, flying the suit,” Steve carried on, for no reason other than the thought had occurred to him. “Like, I think everyone thinks you get in it and you just
Well, it wasn’t so much a room as the point where several corridors intersected.  Six plush couches arranged in a hexagon, each facing a long, dark hallway. The couches were black. The walls and floors and ceiling were all painted black… and now that his eyes were beginning to focus again, he realised that the world wasn’t shimmering – it was just that everything was embedded with
published in limited numbers, and although I have not yet found reference to another copy currently available, it would seem that SHIELD were not in possession of the original.”
Steve felt himself being thrown back, landing a good few meters away and sensing the vibrations on the floor as everything was once more turned on it’s head. There were yells and cries of pain from all over the deck; agents forced to the floor, landing amongst the wreckage that was already littered there- but Steve didn’t care about that.
“Steve’s turning sixteen,” Sam wiggled his eyebrows and smiled brightly, “we’re throwing him a party!”
“Much as I am having fun here,” Natasha interrupted wryly, leaning forward on her hand and looking at the two new boys curiously,  “can I ask what both of you are doing here? You don’t usually step foot in the cafeteria.”
“Okay,” Tony clapped his hands and then made a shooing motion to the three other people in the room, turning back to Steve with a sly look in his eyes, “time for you to leave again. We need to do some celebrating on our own.” He leaned back down and caught Steve’s mouth in a searing kiss, uncaring of their audience. Steve hummed in agreement, his hand sliding over Tony’s hip and then making its home on Tony’s butt.
“Steve?” He blinked and shoved everything back, in favour of focusing on the matter at hand. Tony was looking at him. He expected an answer. Wanted Steve to say he trusted Tony. Which he didn’t. Because Tony was Iron Man.
He took a sharp inhale through the helmet and tried to calm his heart a little. This was the weirdest night of his life- if someone had told him he’d be hitching rides on the back of Tony Stark’s motorbike after meeting him at a party, he would have just asked what they were smoking. And yet here they were.
That was one of the first things Tony became aware of when he woke up. The next thing he realised was that he was groaning, and then the thing after that was that
Tony swallowed, looking up at Steve and his soft, hopeful face. He was too tired to argue this further. If Steve wanted it, whatever. Tony supposed it was the least he could do. And he didn’t particularly fancy making Steve any angrier tonight.
“What the Goddamn hell even happened?” Clint asked as he helped Steve back into a sitting position, “all we heard was a yell and then it was just static and we couldn’t contact you. We thought something had fucking exploded.”
"Look," Steve said, stepping forward and seeming to break out of his little trance, his voice commanding and Captain-like, taking charge of the situation, "it doesn't matter whose it is for now. Clint, we can do a DNA test tomorrow. But we need to work out what to do with it. Can we give to- I don't know, SHIELD?"
I don’t need to be here, Tony. Everyone else could have filled in my roles in life. I made absolutely no difference- i didn’t invent shit, I didn’t single-handedly save the world, it barely even looked like I had a damn effect on your life-”
He didn’t want to do this, he realised. The whole thing was making him feel uneasy, wrong. Tony was the man Steve had been devoted to for years, and who had returned those affections in equal measure. This betrayal, even in theory, made Steve feel awful.
Tony paused, feeling the panic fade as fast as it had come. There were hazy images and vague memories of waking after Steve had arrived, but he had no idea how much of that was real and how much was delirium. Knowing that the team had all made it out was a huge weight off his shoulders, and he picked up the next question on his growing list. “Am I in South Korea?”
Steve sighed, looking down at his cup and wishing he could just stick his entire head in it rather than deal with yet another ‘let’s get Steve laid’ mission lead by Natasha.
“Listen, I might not be in the army these days, but I used to be. I know how to do this.” Steve was quickly slipping back into soldier mode, and right now, he needed a way to get across the coastline. “Does Tony have any air transport?”
Natasha was right. This wasn’t something Tony could afford to get wrong. He clenched his jaw and then gave the mental command, letting the Iron Man suit materialise around him in answer. She nodded. “Check in and keep me updated,” she commanded, knowing that even in T’challa’s jet, she’d be at least half an hour behind Tony. He put his arms down by his sides and made to launch, but she grabbed his arm before he could and looked at him seriously. “Be careful and stay alert, Tony. You know what HYDRA are like. Don’t let them get inside your head.”
Thor arose from his tomb of blankets and sweet wrappers, turning to face the voice whose owner was obscured by the wall of blankets. “No, but I
“Ow,” Steve complained with a pout, whilst Bucky just tutted and then pushed open the door, shouldering Steve inside.
as he hightailed it through the tower in desperate attempt to avoid Clint’s outraged cries and projectiles while Steve just shook his head in the background and Natasha cheered them on.
Another hand on his shoulder- this one not as soft as Thor’s, but with the added bonus of a stroking motion, so Steve just shut his eyes and let it ground him. “You got a friend you wanna call?”
“And I’m sorry that I brought up what happened in Siberia,” Tony told him, and Steve made sure not to wince at the mention of the place alone, “it was totally unrelated and out of line. I was just running hot, and we were fighting, and-“
Tony shook his head and pulled away, but Steve was already taking his hand, the right one, the one full of infinity stones. He felt the burn of them when his fingers brushed them, but he didn’t let up. “Just trust me,” he hissed in blind panic, “the power shared means the power halved, so just
And it meant one of them would have to leave. Move out. Get a new life and a new partner and maybe even a new kid-
“Guys,” Steve said, looking up at the team with slightly pink cheeks, “can I- uh- get a moment alone with Tony, please?”
He lifted his arm, but then felt a sudden shove in his back and stumbled, noticing the two speedsters fly past him. Now the whole group were on one end of the corridor, backing off like they were retreating. Tony’s eyes narrowed, and he lifted his repulsors again, trying to get a decent hit. But the target he was aiming for- the bulletproof guy that hadn’t been present for most of the fight- dropped low, right before Tony fired. His hand splayed over the floor, leaving something there. A small device.
When he got to Thor’s apartment, the door was already open, and he could hear the sounds of all his friends inside. It brought a smile to his face, and he snuck in quietly, letting the door close behind him and then taking in the scene around him.
Tony blinked, hands wrapping around Steve’s neck instinctively, feeling more than a little blissed out when all Steve’s warmth and softness and smell that he usually leeched off his clothes was suddenly pressed up directly against him.
Steve blushed, looking away with a shrug. “You’re really good at this,” he said quietly, whilst his finger traced around the rim of his cup.
Steve didn’t say anything. Just looked down at the plastic cup numbly. He was conscious of every thought that passed through his mind, every flash judgement he made. Just in case they’d missed something. Just in case he was still dangerous.
Steve blinked again, fingers tracing across the picture clipped to the corner of the file. His head felt a little dull, like someone had just pressed pause on all trains of thought, but the familiar wrench of his heart at the sight of the other man was still present under his sternum, stealing the breath from him. In the corner of the room the clock gave a particularly loud tick, its hollow knocking bouncing around in Steve’s brain. “Why are you giving me a file of Tony Stark?” He asked, voice low and wary as he turned his eyes back to Fury. He didn’t pick up the file.
“Yeah yeah,” Natasha rolled her eyes, leaning back and then huffing when Tony squeezed Steve’s hand reassuringly. “God, I feel like we’ve just opened up Pandora’s box with this whole ‘Steve & Tony’ thing.”
“So what- did you have to get it picked up or something?” Steve asked him, using the fact he was in the kitchen to stock up the supplies of popcorn and other terrible foods from the cupboards as he spoke.
Steve kept his hand in Tony’s hair as the man slowly woke; his eyes fluttering open and spotting Steve immediately. Steve just continued to let his fingers play against Tony’s nape, against the adorable curls that looped across the back of his head when it went too long without a cut.
“I know.” Steve nodded once and then tilted his head so that Tony’s fingers slipped over his mouth. He kissed them softly. “And I might get angry at you for stuff that you don’t necessarily mean. I have a lifetime of confrontation with Baseliners under my belt, and bad habits are hard to break. But I’ll try too.”
“I know, it’s driving me mad!” Tony grabbed for a mug with a shake of his head, turning around just as he saw Thor tackle Steve right off the couch and send them both tumbling to the floor with a loud thud. Something cracked, and Tony just hoped it wasn’t a body part. “Why am I dating him again?”
Of course, as he got older, those little fantasies stopped holding so much appeal, but the warmth that surrounded Christmas still remained. It had been the month where everyone just got that little bit kinder. That little bit more giving. And even better than that, it had also been the month when Sarah Rogers would always be let off work a few hours earlier, coming home to Steve with a big hug and a bigger smile, immediately burying herself into blankets and asking Steve about his day, how he’d been, whether he was okay.
Jesus Christ. “What do you want me doing, Sir?” He asked defeatedly, tilting his chin up. Just another mission, he told himself. Another task, to fill the time until the next one came along, and then the next, and then the next.
And the stress, the anger and the irritation and the fight- it just drains out when they find each other’s hands. Because really, how could Tony stay annoyed when Steve’s smiling at him like that? And how could Steve feel bitter when Tony’s giggling at the film with his nose all scrunched up and adorable?
“February 19th, 2016,” she began quietly, biting her lip, “I named the test subject, today. They told me never to do that, because it would give him an identity and we’d get attached. But I think I’ve already been compromised.” She looked down, smiling faintly. “Peter suits him, anyway.”
Steve explained it as best he could, while they all sat around him and listened silently. He struggled to remember sections of the night—it had been blurry, disjointed. He knew Tony’s condition though, and he made sure to let them all know that it was okay, and there probably wouldn’t be any lasting damage. Bruce joined them around half-way through, sitting next to Steve quietly and listening to what he said, and Steve made sure to shoot him the most genuine smile he could manage. He knew none of this was easy; not for any of them.
She just laughed. “Tony, I was never gonna go to the Bahamas. Same way Clint wasn’t ever gonna go see his family in Wyoming and Steve wasn’t going to take that mission which fell during the Christmas period. They were just little musings, I guess. What-if’s.”
Tony looked up and saw him stood outside the glass doors, pulling the very specific face he did whenever Tony was behaving in a way that Steve couldn’t figure out but was mildly concerned about. The fact that he hadn’t just walked right through the door was an indicator that Steve was going to have some sort of serious conversation. He was establishing that Tony didn’t have to let him inside if he didn’t want to. Because he was just a good fucking guy like that.
Sam paused, shooting a look at Steve. “Most of them hang out in smaller groups. There are the jock-type ones, but they’re pretty cool. People tend to merge, a lot of the time. You’ll see some of the girls hanging out with the jocks- or all of the jocks and girls going over to one of the popular guy’s houses and having a dodgy house party on the outskirts of town-”
He felt Steve’s arms tighten around his waist, pulling Tony in flush against him. Tony was aware he’d been trying to stick to his plan, yes, but that seemed to be down the drain now. Although he had the ears on, so at least he had completed the ‘wear a sexy outfit’ part of it. Sort of. He was going to conveniently ignore the coffee stains on his white shirt, the burn mark on the back of his hand and the fact that his hair smelled like burnt things. The ears offset all that. It was fine.
Sam yelled, and Steve could only look up and stare in disbelief as his best friend swooped low and around the ruins of the compound, yelling a war-cry as he lifted his weapon. He didn’t even believe his own eyes, at first, but then a second later, the crackling noise was paired with a light, and Steve realised that they were portals—portals everywhere, opening behind him, flooding the ruins of the compound with friends, warriors, fighters. Steve gaped at the sight of Wanda, Bucky, T’challa—he saw a silver Iron Suit land with a thud and gaped as Pepper opened up the faceplate and nodded at him. By the hundreds they came, Wakandans and Asgardians, sorcerers and Avengers, until Steve was no longer alone.
It was just a shirt. He undressed for gym class all the time, this was no big deal. Just because it was Tony Stark, looking at him with his perfect stupid face as he got to his knees right in front of Steve and wiped the fast curling hairs out of his face-
He cleared his throat as he stepped up to Tony's side, and Tony turned to him. "So," Steve asked, eyes sticking on the kid as he slowly got lost in the crowds, "what was that about?"
“Sweetheart,” Steve was there when Tony opened his eyes again, looking deeply concerned as he settled his hand down against Tony’s shoulder, the other one brushing Peter’s back, “what’s wrong? What happened? You look… is everything okay?”
God, Steve was his blessing. He just knew- he knew what to do, how to act. He was sat there treating Tony like he wasn’t a freak. And he knew that maybe, afterwards, the rejections would come- the quiet admittance of the fact that Steve just couldn’t do this, couldn’t handle this on top of everything else- but for now, Tony was just glad that he was there. He heard the sounds of the towel slipping off the rack, and a few seconds later Steve spoke up again. “It’s next to your left hand. You can do it yourself, or I can help if you want?”
The fact that, in all those years of competition and conflict, Steve had never once left Tony lost for words, or unable to look at him…
“It’s fine,” Tony assured him, with a little shrug and a nonchalant shake of his head, his hand already raised to make an entirely different point-
just stumbled onto an anxiety that Steve had never been able to find the words for, before now. That sad little voice that had so often whispered in his head,
Which then became a thrilled gasp, as Steve pulled him up onto his knees and tugged his shorts down over his thighs.
“I love you,” Steve answered, his lips still brushing over Tony’s neck. “I love you, and you’re alive, and you're
, that for a second it was overwhelming, his mind completely whiting out, his body unable to translate these sensations. And then Tony twisted his fingers, sending a low pleasure grinding through him.
...And when he stopped holding himself to standards that he’d never dream of applying to anyone else
It was going to mean reliving every moment of his darkest memories, and pulling them to pieces, and forcing himself to be honest about them.
If Steve could tell Tony that he was a vampire, then he could tell Tony that he loved him, that he wanted to be with him for the rest of his life…
When Tony looked over, he saw that Steve had dropped his head and covered his mouth with his hand… But Tony could still see him smiling. Steve was just one of those people that smiled with their whole body; it was there in the shape of his shoulders and the blush running up his neck and the slight crinkle in his eyes, even when he’d closed them.
“Yes baby, that’s it,” he murmured, his thrusts coming shorter and shallower now. He felt Tony pull into him, his fingernails digging into Steve skin, a growl held somewhere are the bottom of his chest. “That’s it Tony, come for me.”
Tony couldn’t bear the thought of arguing with Steve about all of this. Or, rather, he knew he wouldn’t be able to bear it, if it actually happened… He knew, if either of them snapped right now, he wouldn’t really get to say any of the things that kept him up at night. Steve wouldn’t listen, or understand, if Tony tried to explain why he was so hurt. He wouldn’t care. Tony had accepted that, the day he’d received Steve’s letter. When he’d read the line ‘…
There was a plunging dip, right to the bottom of his gut, as Steve pulled him up off of his feet and hard against his chest. A swell of giddiness bloomed up through Tony’s head, a little yelp of surprise getting swallowed up by a desperate gulp for air. Automatically, Tony wrapped his legs around Steve’s waist, falling further into the thrill of weightlessness. And then, even though his lungs were still frantically working to catch up, Tony grabbed at Steve’s hair and tried to pull him into another kiss-
“And that I probably wouldn’t even be second guessing myself, if it weren’t for that,” Steve added, with a heavy shrug.
Steve could have so easily fallen into it without another thought, if a hollow clattering sound hadn’t snagged his attention. They broke the kiss and looked together at the source of the commotion - which turned out to be a stack of empty file boxes overbalancing. When Tony looked at him again, it was with a bashful smile.
Steve felt his shoulders fall apart under the pressure of it, a little surge of dizziness rolling through his head at the sheer release of that one touch…
find it easier to concentrate when Tony was close. He was certainly more focused, more observant… less irritable and clumsy. Even so, he couldn’t kid himself that he’d be studying harder if Tony was in the Tower right now-
Tony had never seen anyone look as lovely as Steve did right then. That flawless body relaxed and open and just displayed for Tony against the crisp, white sheets, his skin shiny with sweat. Tony felt his body move forward of its own accord, following an instinct to get closer to him, to climb over the top of him, to see his face
Tony’s heart clenched tight. A horrible, cold feeling overwhelmed him like rising flood water, a feeling of drowning in his own inadequacy - because he couldn’t think of how to stop Steve from hurting.
meant everything he said last night. Okay, he might not have literally thrown himself on his knees and begged for forgiveness, under normal circumstances… but then he was
And then Tony sat up, encouraging Steve to lean forward so that he could slip his jacket over his shoulders. Steve felt his heart leap into his throat, a wave of dizziness rolling through his head as he recognised this line they were about to step over.
“What’s Ambience, by the way?” Steve asked quickly, before Tony could reach the door. Tony paused mid-stride to look at him. “I, uh, missed that bit.”
Looking at Tony right now, so full of passion and brimming with ideas and raring to go, Steve had this sense of
, he knew that all of his previous fears were unfounded. All the confusion and nervousness fell away completely, rendered irrelevant and ridiculous by what Tony could undeniably
“Yeah,” Steve nodded. “I don’t know what it is, but I know it’s not that. It’s… It didn’t… It didn’t start when I woke up here, it’s not… It’s not me
Eventually, he made it to 9.56pm. Close enough. As he crossed the drive to the main entrance, he couldn’t help noticing how different it felt, without Bucky there to reassure him, or tease him – or, usually, both. It made Steve feel oddly exposed. Not so much because he was alone, but because this was all so different to what he was used to. It had the strange effect of making everything look slightly different. Making Steve overthink every trivial part of this – even getting into the damn house.
Tony waved a casual goodbye, in spite of the garboil of emotions churning in his gut. He managed to hold out until he was sure Steve was long out of earshot before he let go of a heavy breath, melting down towards the counter as he exhaled.
There was the briefest flicker of a fearful impulse, the strangest idea that he could just ignore it.
Shorter notes this time! But, a purely practical note - yes, I've altered canon here and had Steve give Sam the shield *before* he leaves for the past. There is no 'old Steve' in this story - BECAUSE I MAINTAIN THAT IT MAKES NO SENSE!
And then, to make everything so much worse, an excitable assistant rushed over to give them their ‘ceremonial robes’ for the event.
Trying to work out some way to keep Tony, trying to think of the right things to say… with a horrible feeling that he’d already gone past that point. That there were a thousand times he would have said something else, if he’d only known. That he’d already missed a hundred opportunities to help Tony, to show Tony that he cared… to make Tony like him.
And at last he surrendered to a shrug, his stomach coiling tight as he waited for Tony to say something.
“On the strict instruction that you lock it in an attic” Tony mumbled more quietly, sounding endearingly vulnerable and maybe even a little bit pleased. Steve tried unsuccessfully to swallow that emotion back down. And then Tony took a step closer, and gestured to the frame in Steve’s hands, “you can take that one, if you like.”
seen behind the curtain of existence - that, however inhuman and overwhelming his knowledge was, there was still so much left for him to be humbled and confused by.
In all likelihood, that fit of giggles would have broken through, whatever he did - he was too far into it, by then.
“They sent me to that one. They called, and said that you’d be there, and to - to go there, and take the picture, and - I mean, I didn’t think I’d
“You recently sent an item to a small media company by that name,” JARVIS reminded him, “an SLR digital camera, sent as a replacement, as I understand it…”
than his immediate situation, Steve felt especially compelled to focus on the overall plan... or lack thereof. And, with literally nothing else to go on, he retreated to his comfort zones - the basic tenets of mission planning and battle strategy…
the freedom of walking around without those expectations and judgements around his neck, as though a physical weight had been lifted. He was more confident, more comfortable in his own skin… more himself. He had, entirely unexpectedly, lived out a personal fantasy. Rewritten a moment he’d always regretted, in a way that would actually count-
“Come here.” Steve whispered, sliding down off of the couch so that he could put his arms around him, letting Tony rest his weight against his chest. Indulging in the closeness of him, for a few moments. “How much more do you have to do?” He asked, nodding at the experiments.
But, then again… Most people hadn’t shared this much, or dealt with this much, or thought about this much, before they even started. Most people didn’t go on their first date already knowing that the other person understood them, and adored them, and would go that far to be with them.
– that trust he had in Tony. That complete faith that Tony saw who he was, behind whatever he was doing in any given moment. Steve

Tony was in the middle of yet another anxious spiral when he first noticed the sound of birdsong. He braced before he glanced up at the window, knowing that he’d see a sky coloured by that ominous pre-dawn glow. And then he huffed a bitter little breath.
And then Steve glanced up at him – and still, it was easy to keep looking. Maybe it helped that Steve seemed more relaxed, since they actually started on the tests… the fact that Steve smiled so naturally made it easier for Tony to do the same. Tony didn’t feel the need to drop his eyes, this time.
Tony rolled his arm, letting the light hit the more sensitive skin on the underside… Not even waiting for it to hurt, anymore.
“Nowhere in particular,” Steve smiled, tugging Tony closer to him. “I was thinking we’d just go for a walk, tonight.”
“Well, it could be any number of things. I mean, yeah, they should’ve put more details down – but you know they don’t always…” her voice trailed off, defeated, when she saw that he’d turned his attention back to his phone.
remember Bucky, without it inevitably turning to grief and regret. That there was finally something to be done about it. Something he could see as part of an ever more certain future…
Also, if there are any specific tags I should be using for any of this that I've forgotten to include, please let me know.
Steve felt himself being overwhelmed in a far more comprehensive way. This wasn’t the gentle bending of his moods that he’d been inhaling for days. This wasn’t a case of individual symptoms welling up. It was nothing like the slip into intoxication that he remembered from his nights drinking in Brooklyn. This felt more like a fog closing in around him. Something that was soaking into him, changing
And Captain America? Captain America would say he absolutely shouldn’t put either himself or Tony in this position. Especially if he couldn’t bring himself to be honest with Tony about the real risk he was taking. And, obviously, no matter how much he wanted it, however unlikely it was he would get this chance again, he could
plan; for the fact that he might, hypothetically, have made better use of this afternoon, if he hadn’t been so caught up in this pointlessness…
“Just one moment” Belle smiled – expertly getting to her feet in a single fluid motion, before she took a few steps closer to the door, to gesture to someone standing just outside. And Tony knew he should probably be more concerned about that… but, to be perfectly honest, talking to Steve seemed a more effective use of this minor reprieve.
parts of Steve were meant for, the one thing that all parts of him could agree on. The first time in… maybe his whole life, that Steve had felt such complete and total certainty.
Tony kissed him more desperately then; he couldn’t think what else to do with that sudden spike of need. And Steve moaned softly, and opened his mouth, and arched up against him –
He remembered it clearly enough that it turned his stomach, like the emotional hangover that resurfaces whenever you think back to a nasty accident… But it wasn’t the same as being there.
He’d wrapped Steve in cool, clean towels, then in a warm, soft robe, and then finally in fresh white sheets – a swell of pride and assurance rising up in Tony, every time Steve enjoyed one of those little details.
was… But he was quite obviously less coordinated and controlled than he would usually be. Steve could already tell that whatever he was about to say would be at least partly the drugs talking-
“Hm,” Tony smiled, and kissed him again, just once, very sweetly. And then he dropped one arm so that he could squeeze Steve’s hand, a warm authority radiating from him as he said, “come on, let’s go inside.”
Century, or what general rules he might be breaking, or worry that he wouldn’t know the modern words for it.
And then once again words abandoned Tony completely, as Steve began to trail those same gentle kisses around the edge of the arc reactor, his tongue sweeping over the scarred lines that surrounded it. Tony’s breath hitched, and shuddered, and caught, the pitch of his whimpering getting higher as Steve worked his way lower down Tony’s chest. He’d never felt anything like the strange, sparkling sensation that was dancing over his skin, reaching places he’d never been touched before. He’d never been this painfully tense with
“Oh God, please,” Tony whispered, as he ran a firm hand down over Steve’s chest, already forcing his way between them and caressing roughly over the outline of Steve’s cock as he begged, “
at risk, or upset the global political balance in anyway… And I couldn’t see any reason we couldn’t just stop, if it turned out to be a bad idea – or why that would be worse than just not doing it in the first place… So, that’s kind of my list?”
Tony had the eerie feeling that he was about to live through one of his childhood nightmares. That he was about witness the real Steve Rogers decreeing once and for all that Tony really was the disappointment that his father always predicted-
was still dressed, that he’d much rather be lying here with every inch of his skin pressed to Steve… but, even then, Tony might’ve had an idea that they weren’t going to be staying. God knows where it would’ve come from, at that stage – maybe he
And he might’ve found himself thrown by that, and ended up floundering - and who knew how many of those timelines existed, and how badly Steve put his foot in it each time, and how things worked out from there…
“This is the bar where I first saw her” Steve remembered with a smile. And then he caught Tony’s eye “C’mon, let’s go and get a drink” And Tony just followed him happily, feeling a little thrill run up his arm at the resting strength he could feel beneath Steve’s grip.
He pinched his lips tight as Tony bit down harder, pushing deeper into Steve’s muscles. A perfect, pure pain pulsed around Tony’s teeth, a vertiginous thrill rolling after it, flowing through him-
Every muscle in his body was tensed as he finally left the bedroom, not sure what it was bracing for. But when he got to the living room Tony wasn’t even looking at him. He was too immersed in the papers he had spread out on the coffee table.
Steve nodded at Bucky before he rose to his feet, tiptoeing oh-so-quietly over to the main door as Bucky positioned himself to cover him.
And then Steve’s lips were on his, devouring and demanding and unashamedly desperate, forcing Tony’s mouth open, one hand grabbing roughly at the back of Tony’s hair as he pulled Tony up into the kiss. Tony’s body surrendered for him, immediately and completely – an impulse that had nothing to do with him being a vampire, or his supernatural bond to Steve. This was the most basic human instinct, an understanding right from his gut.
want to fight you, and I couldn’t bear to lose you, is the truth. And I know that’s selfish, and I probably knew it then, but every time I thought about telling you, and I pictured you getting upset, and I knew I just
Steve forced himself to picture it, to believe it would be every bit as bad as his panicked mind could possibly make it.
human of his concerns. It was a conflict he understood only too well, even if he didn’t want to think about it-
And then he heard Steve hang up with an impatient huff. He looked up in time to see Steve giving his phone an unimpressed glare - which struck Bucky as faintly amusing, for some reason.
He realised that these children had probably been born here; a generation of Varians who had never known anything but slavery…
His mind twinged wearily at the familiar pattern of thoughts – but he didn’t bother trying to fight them. He’d been trying not to think about Steve for the better part of a year now, and he was well acquainted with the many forms his failures took.
going in for a look at the Tesseract Project - but he’s going to think he’s sneaking you in so that you can bring down Hydra,” Tony began, simply organizing his thoughts.
triumphantly, ‘He found out about my parents before Sokovia even happened, how can it all be about the Accords’. And I think I probably had
He sprinted down the corridor as quickly as he’d ever moved, and all but threw himself down on the couch-
“They are,” she nodded. “This particular variety is known for creating a sense of joy and calm, but the different colours each produce subtly different versions of that effect.”
And then Tony screwed up his face, and gave his head a little shake, clearly about to take that back and try again-
It was a harmless little musing, really. A filler thought, tucked in the gaps of his deeper philosophical crises.
Which was overwhelmed just as quickly by the memory of Steve standing in the snow, the blood spreading into cerise fractals through the frost on his uniform-
‘The vampire thing’ was a list all of its own - a pandora's box of issues, that could spill out into all sorts of crises and mysteries and terrors the moment he opened it up.
“Yeah, they’re waiting for me upstairs,” Tony answered, with a soft laugh. Steve’s shoulders clenched.
spiteful to you, and taken so much from you, and even though you could kill every one of them – you’ve never even yelled at anyone. And, you’re right – I took that for granted, I didn’t even notice, I
In the months after that, Steve had learned that the Legend of Captain America had been a big part of Tony’s childhood - that Howard had made an ‘issue’ of it. But, until this very moment, Steve had never really thought about it. He’d just blindly accepted that it somehow explained Tony’s animosity towards him at the beginning and made a mental note not to mention Howard much… and that was that. He’d never had reason to ask himself what that issue really was, or where it came from, or what it meant. Especially after Tony seemed to get over it so quickly...
The wonderful, comfortable space it left behind. Like Tony had sliced through a layer of scar tissue, like he’d literally cut something free inside Steve, like Steve was suddenly able to breathe for the first time in so long.
Bucky was half-way across the room before he noticed Steve. His step stuttered to a pause so that he could give Steve a little wave of acknowledgement, a non-verbal
very clever, aren’t you?” Adam mused, entirely sincerely, looking at Tony the way a teacher might look at a favoured pupil on graduation day.  And Steve
He pushed into Steve so easily. A comfortable friction rolled languidly along Steve’s back, a snug feeling of contentment swelling in him as Tony filled him up. It felt
wanted to make, since they were on this topic. An apology that could’ve started with almost the exact same wording, actually… But he got the impression that Tony was trying to work something out here, that he was in the middle of finding the words for something. So, for a moment, he sat quietly and let him continue.
Tony, meanwhile, was trying to re-piece their plan on the fly. Trying to remember what they’d come here for, why he’d wanted to speak to the staff-
He was vaguely aware of a lull around him. The general feeling of people paying attention to him again.
“So…I got your letter, and…” Steve struggled, and then sighed, “to be honest, it made me want to apologise for mine.”
And, to begin with, it was probably just a subconscious safeguard – his conscience, or his social training, or whatever part of his brain knew that you did
“Well, I don’t know,” Tony sighed. “I don’t know what a Bulsaran… Bulsarite? What a person from Bulsara would be interested in - and I don’t know what important things my teammates know, now do I?”
,” she told him, firmly. “I mean – you haven’t driven for twenty years. You’re not thinking straight, you – just, no. You’ll kill yourself. That’s ridiculous.”
“And… At least the first time, you’ll have to bring it yourself.” Tony finished, almost reluctantly.
It wasn’t intended to hurt, to break the skin. Apparently, even at the mercy of an impulse this powerful, even at this deep and fundamental a level – Tony didn’t want that. There was no aggression in any of this, no buried resentment, no fantasy about redressing the balance or making Steve pay… not anymore, at least. There was
It was, as always, a beautiful evening in Wakanda. The air was warm and soft and full of the sound of laughter, throbbing with the low bass of the music being played in the palace. Inside, hundreds of people were drinking and dancing and throwing their arms around one another, still high on the elation of their victory against Thanos -
said I wasn’t scared, or angry, or human. Other people said that for me. I didn’t say anything. I was just there, being scared and doing it anyway. Being angry and still not doing it. Being human and just trying my best to be more than that. So, actually, I
And then at last, Steve was dressed and ready, looking like himself again. A quick time check told him he was still ahead of schedule-
It might burden Tony. It might lead him to questions that he never wanted to ask, and anxieties that he never would have faced.
Which Tony did find immediately comforting, actually. The instant recognition that, even if he’d thought about biting Steve, he’d never want to
all of that was usually such a big deal, and then he’d have to piece it all together from scratch - and even then, it wouldn’t feel real. He knew it wouldn’t. It would be going through the motions of his usual neurosis…
The panic he’d fallen into that first morning after, that strange sense that there was something he was meant to be doing
He cringed, realising how badly he was explaining this, even in his own head. Recognising that he still didn’t have the words for his regret and his guilt, he still wasn’t sure if those were the words he should be aiming for anyway. He had no idea
...Which is how Steve found himself walking over to Tony before he remembered that he didn’t know what to say when he got there.
“Actually, I was going to start with the blood work,” Tony answered, looking between Steve and Bucky as he spoke. “You probably aren’t going to feel like doing that after the spinal tap. C’mon.” And he stood up in a fluid motion, and nodded toward the elevator again, “There is a med lab on the next floor up. If we’re drawing blood we should go somewhere cleaner than this.”
you have to say outside?” Tony asked, with an edge of irritation that masked a genuine feeling of concern. “I can hear you shivering.”
. His orgasm just crashed through him, like a wall of water breaking through a dam, every shred of resistance within him just washed aside by the force of it. That intense, pulsing pleasure deep inside him, drawing everything down through his body, concentrating everything into this feeling surging through his hips, the pit of his stomach, the tip of his cock. He could feel himself moaning, but he couldn’t hear anything over the roar of the blood in his ears, he could barely see through the cloud of stars on his vision-
He looked back at Tony, and saw that familiar shyness in his eyes - and he knew, even before he asked,
Tony huffed an embarrassed laugh at himself, the tips of his ears glowing pink as he realised it was probably a bit early to be thinking about marriage proposals.
He paused when he heard an ominous creaking in the walls, a more immediate guilt consuming him as he waited to see what he’d broken this time.
It was the way that Tony and Sam paused that snagged his attention. And the more focused tone in Tony’s voice when he asked,
And then he felt pathetic for feeling terrible about saying something entirely reasonable - and, quite frankly, necessary…
of their discoveries were important. I’m not condoning how they made those discoveries, or what they were planning on using them for. I would have tried to stop those things from happening, if I’d been there at the time… But they did happen. And Hydra
He saw the surprise flash up in Steve’s eyes, his entire body flinching upright under the impact of this sudden swerve in his expectations… And, belatedly, Tony remembered some of his genuine remorse. The personal guilt that probably should’ve motivated this entire speech began to collect in his chest, bleeding into his words as he went on.
Steve, who had never felt any differently about Bucky even after everything that HYDRA did to him – Steve, who hated what had been done to Bucky, and still didn’t hate any part of him.
“Er, yeah…” And then he realised Dev was looking at him to elaborate. So, he dug as deep as he could, and used the last dregs of the FOCUS, to think of the difference between the real answer and the right one. “I’m –
Steve so clearly, the person he was, the layers of him in every expression and gesture and turn of phrase…
“You can have anything you want,” Steve murmured, as he moved his way down to Tony’s collarbone, “everything you want, always. There is nothing I wouldn’t do for you, nothing.”
With that, Steve went back to his checklist - starting with very carefully removing the shield from Other Steve’s now softened grip.
He retrieved his phone from the kitchen counter, and sent a hasty text to Steve to say that he’d be able to stop by in an hour or so. Obviously, he could’ve been there in half the time - but his every available second had been given over to the ‘Hydra project’ recently, and he felt like he needed to indulge in a few moments of silence, first.
“Did I tell you that you look incredible tonight?” He whispered, for what must’ve been the fifth time that evening.
sorry,” Tony hurried on, having to focus himself on the apology he was making. “That whole thing was… probably the worst thing I’ve ever done, which I know is saying something. I was just… hurt, and angry, and I know that’s not a reason to lash out like that
“I like you like this,” Tony mused, tracing a fingertip along Steve’s throat. “I like the idea of you spread out on clean, soft sheets…comfortable… rested…” He watched the shivers run along Steve’s skin as he spoke, the way those impossible eyelashes fluttered…
It finally occurred to him that he was being awfully compliant - that maybe that was the true motive behind all this… To make the Avengers compliant...
Without any conscious thought, Steve simply watched as Tony blinked against the sunlight, absentmindedly brushing his hair away from his eyes as he looked up-
Varian, to help an alien use a human system. In fact-“ And he scrolled back through a few of the pages he’d just looked at. “Yeah, a

bought into this idea that a ‘good life’ looked a certain way, or ticked certain boxes, anyway. I always thought there were different ways to do things. And honestly, I’d never imagined that one of those ways would be as wonderful as this. I didn’t know there
“You know, sitting here, I’ve figured something out… about fantasies… and about reality.” Tony went on, in such a calm…
And Steve’s voice must’ve sounded every bit as outraged as he felt, because an entirely different sort of silence fell over the group then - like everyone was afraid to breathe.
“Because it’s not just the sunlight thing, you know,” Tony added suddenly, taking a step towards Steve. “It’s…

A little giggle bubbled over Tony’s lips, more an expression of joy than amusement. The uncontainable, giddy happiness of being

Just a little bit defensive at having his motives questioned – especially when they were motives he was so sure about.

Like a dam had burst, setting free not only the things he’d longed to say, but the things he’d longed to wonder about, the ideas he didn’t even know were in there - ideas he might not have come up with, until this morning.
He was gripped by the same focusing adrenaline that he might’ve felt if he’d been walking a tightrope-
The bruising pressure, the eye-watering sharpness, the dull burn that spread through his hips in its wake.
Because Tony was irresponsible - said the man who’d threatened to taser a terminally ill person with a serious heart condition.
Steve looked absolutely wrecked. His face was flushed pink and sheened in sweat, his hair damp and dishevelled, his pupils blown.

And, yeah, there were times when you looked at me a certain way, and God, I wanted to touch you…” His eyes drifted over Steve’s body, briefly – and then Tony shook the thought away… like he would a happy memory, made sad by the passage of time. “But I’d have settled for being the same as anyone else. To earn the same benefit of the doubt, the same trust – to be able to spend time with you and just be happy there, just be able to be with you. I
Did that mean they had to act quickly, before anyone could take this one advantage from them? Or did that mean that it wasn’t really an advantage? That they couldn’t really rely on it, because when it came time to use it, someone else could simply overpower it…
on me, even. You didn’t tell me you were going in to help Bucky in Bucharest, you didn’t tell me the full story even while I was trying to broker a deal to keep you all out of prison, you didn’t call me or leave me a message after Bucky broke out of the compound – you didn’t tell me about my parents then, even when you knew it was relevant, when it had been the big main clue. You didn’t tell me about the super soldiers, then. You call Clint, and tell him to get Wanda, and you get Sam to hire a convicted criminal he’s met once, and – taking Bucky with you – you try to steal a Quin Jet from an airport. Your plan includes letting Scott Lang run around my suit pulling wires out. It does not involve evacuating the airport. Your one attempt to explain is the line ‘this is all that psychiatrist’s fault’ – which didn’t mean a fucking thing to me at the time, by the way. And when I ask you to come home, and discuss it, and work
Belatedly, Steve realised that his jaw had started to ache - that he’d been tensed against a tremor ever since he’d turned the water off.
That you’re never going to stay out of a fight if you can help, and you’re always going to be able to help, because you’re you. And I love you for that, and I don’t want to change it - even though I know it’s going to be a lifetime of anxiety… It’s just… The bunker is different… And it was one thing, trying to get my head around the thought of going back there at all. To be honest, I don’t know if I was ever going to be okay with that. But if
The detail seemed to come back to Steve at the same moment, and suddenly he was scanning the room for where Tony had thrown it.

Tony could hardly believe he hadn’t felt this sympathy for him an hour ago. It seemed so obvious now.
from the top of the pile and opened it to the first page, his mind filling up with things he would have liked to yell at him…
“He had a big house on the French border, and he used to rent rooms out – like a bed and breakfast, without the breakfast,” Steve laughed at the memory. “And the Commando’s stayed there for like, a month, I think? While we were tracking a Hydra scientist… But, y’know, we knew we weren’t going to be there long, so it wasn’t a serious thing, obviously. Just… a thing.” And he shrugged, and glanced back at Tony-
Even in this imperfect mirror, Tony could see how pale and sallow his skin looked. Last night's clothes were now creased and bunched in the most unflattering of places, and strands of his hair were clinging to the film of sweat on his forehead. The bags under his eyes were so dark that he could see the city skyline through them.
“Oh, shut up,” Steve shoved him sideways and then huffed irritably when Tony barely even flinched, “I am not adorable. I will kick your ass, alright? I will. I don’t care.”
“Good morning to you too, angel-face,” he leaned down and pressed a kiss to Steve’s hair before stepping back, “sorry for waking you.”
What was he trying to tell himself here? That Tony felt the same way? It was… just thinking about it was ridiculous, it didn’t even deserve to be contemplated, really. But- but he couldn’t deny what he was looking at, in that one second- it was like a moment of complete totality for Steve. It was all he could see. It was the way Steve looked at Tony, reflected back in the other boy’s eyes.
“Hey- you should invite him and Thor over to your birthday party next week,” Sam told him over a mouthful of burger, then promptly choked on it a second later. After Clint gave him a hefty whack on the back, he looked up and continued. “See if you get a

“Meet me after school, yeah?” Tony asked, tucking the chair back in, “I’ll take you out, show you a good time- might need to stop off at my place just for a bit first, though- gotta check my Work-In-Progress Bot hasn’t blown any of his wiring yet, we’re still in the very early stages of development, you know how it is.”
Tony glanced up at him, raising an eyebrow. “You could say so. Mostly just tinkering though- although I can admit, this one’s a little more high brow.”
He braces for impact, a little yelp escaping his lips as he jerks his hands up on instinct- but impact doesn’t come. Instead, there’s a sudden tight pressure on his waist, and he realizes it’s an arm that’s just managed to snag him before he brains himself. Which is nice. Definitely helpful.
The three men stood on the other side of the door looked at him in mild surprise as he stepped into the observation room. One of them was sat at a laptop, undoubtedly recording every move Tony made in there, and the other two seemed merely to be part of Rumlow’s squad. Steve nodded to them once, and then turned to the mirror before they had a chance to say anything. After that, everything else in the room became irrelevant anyway. The strange looks of a couple of men were hardly a concern to Steve. Not when his eyes fell upon Tony’s form, hunched over and with a hand shackled to the table. He looked like shit. Bruised eye, split lip, dried blood streaked across his forehead. The arm not bound by the cuffs was hanging limply at his side. And they were just the injuries Steve could see. Clearly they hadn’t bothered to take Tony to medical before this had begun.
“Does this thing have autopilot?” He muttered, for once in his life wishing that he’d taken the air-force route in the military. JARVIS was doing a great job of keeping him up in the air though, and as soon as Steve vocalised the question, the heads-up display flickered to life and offered him a tracking view of the massive thing stomping around on the pavement.
want to be in a relationship with her, and believe me, you don't want me setting my mind on that. It's already being considered, you know."
Tony didn’t say anything for a few moments, before he blinked and then snapped out of whatever trance he had been in. “Uhhhh- ‘m’not gonna go home tonight, don’t think. Rhodey’ll… yeah. I’ll text him- or Thor, his house is usually empty-“
Just like before, he thought, a bittersweet feeling curdling in his gut as he made his way over to the desk and tried to find the source of the sound. It wasn’t difficult to spot; a spare helmet, half-way through repairs and looking more than a little bit worse for wear. Steve smiled fondly and the sight of it, picking it up and searching curiously for what was making the noise. When he saw the red dot flashing within it, the smile became a frown. Tony had told him before that he could relay visual and audio messages from one suit to the other; usually floor plans or objects that he needed a clear conceptualised idea of. Which meant that… that there was a message in there that must have just come through from one of the iron man suits.
Tony was being dragged away now, and he could taste the disgusting water as it choked on the back of his throat- but now it was something else too- someone else was there, there was… someone was
“Not Sam,” came a familiar British voice, and Steve frowned, sitting up as Peggy told him “open the door and let me talk to you, Steven , or I will sit here and wait until you need to pee and then ambush you instead. Your choice.”
He felt a pressure settle down against his shoulder, a soothing voice. “Steve?” It said, “Steve, come on, breathe with me baby, get your head out of the pillow so you can take in some air, it’s okay, I’m here, I’m sorry.”
Tony stirred the pan quietly for a moment, a small frown creasing his brow. His left arm moved up and his hand settled against Steve’s as it wrapped around Tony’s stomach. “It’s gonna sound a little weird,” he began, pulling a face, “don’t laugh.”
Tony sighed loudly. “I will admit, I am not the best at planning ahead. I… may have dived in and tried to disengage the magnetic thrust
“Yeah, yeah, sure,” Steve huffed and then poked him in the forehead, pushing him away with a half-hidden smile. “Just tell me why you climbed up my drainpipe at 12 at night, Tony.”
He was sick of every part of his life being controlled by someone else. Since the day he was goddamn born- ‘take this medicine, Steve’, ‘don’t leave the house, Steve’, ‘that’s not safe for you, Steve’. He’d been ill and he’d lost his freedom for the sake of surviving, but he was
Tony only dropped his arm when they were out of the building, like Steve might suddenly turn and decide to finish what he’d started. Which, to be fair, wasn’t too far off bat. Steve
"Alright, alright, I was just asking!" Steve sighed and then stood up off the bed, running a hand through his hair. "We should get Bruce."
Steve knew, looking back, that the words Loki had whispered to him had been just that: words. Empty. Designed to throw him off.
They both made their way out of the garage; Tony shutting the door and taking a minute to meticulously brush away every fleck of water and patch of mud from the upholstery on the car. Steve watched him work, looking almost manic as his nails scrabbled at the dirt his shoes had made and wiped the windows that had been blurred by his breath. “I’m pretty sure your dad isn’t going t-“
Clint and Natasha had gone over to the precinct where he’d been detained after the murder to interrogate him, and when Steve asked, it was Natasha who spoke. “Elliot Redford. His wife had cancer and they couldn’t afford it. He applied for the Stark Apprenticeship program because of the health insurance benefits, but didn’t make it through the interview process.” She swallowed, shook her head minutely. “He blamed Tony when she died.”
Steve raised his hands in frustration, leaning his head back against the pillows. “I dunno! He’s just… not. I can’t work it out, like he’s totally into it one minute, and then he’s suddenly just- just talking about something else, or doing something else, and like, I’m not gonna
“No you won’t, you never do!” Steve responded curtly as he turned around, “half the time you barely even let any of the information sink into your head before it’s out the other ear again.”
“He’s gonna beat you,” Steve hissed as he found Rumlow’s arm, twisting it as far as it could go, “Tony’s smarter and braver and stronger than you could ever be. He’s gonna take your whole organisation down in a h---”
It would be fine. He didn’t need to worry. This was the first mission out since they’d even found the boy- in fact, as far as Tony recalled, he’d never been without at least one Avenger in the tower since his arrival. So of course it was going to be difficult to acclimatize to leaving him. But Peter would be fine, and for now, Tony needed to keep his head in the game. They had a while to go before they were out of the danger.
“Oh, don’t start,” Tony interrupted with a wave of his hand. He refused to let Steve’s worry break through the cloud of happiness that he was currently feeling from the knowledge that all his friends were happy because of him, were glad that he’d done this for them. See? He
Steve slid his arm around Tony’s side, pulling him in close and resting his mouth against Tony’s head. He felt warm, and his thoughts were a calm sea. Steve sunk into it. “I added something on, this time ‘round,” he murmured, “I don’t know if I should’ve. But I did. I told him Bucky was alive, and then—
That night, he holed himself up in the (thoroughly cleaned out) workshop and then worked back through all the data that Bruce had sent him on his condition, determined to try and figure something out. It had been less than twenty-four hours, and he was already sick of it. And when he looked over to his friends and their pained faces, pinched and tight whenever they had to stand up and move something else out of the way, he couldn’t help but feel as if they were too. It had to be irritating, after all, looking after him like he was a goddamned child.
It’s… it’s what Tony had drawn up, all those months ago on scraps of paper- except this was undeniably Steve-like in style, and altogether a lot more neat than his had ever been. Pages and pages of neatly filled lines; some crossed out, some cramped additions. Doesn’t like 4th July fireworks down at the bottom or just caves in the top corner of one particular spread.
“You didn’t,” Tony was quick to correct him, squeezing Steve’s hand reassuringly and shaking his head, “Steve, I’m fine. Look at me. Not a scratch, I swear. Okay, well, maybe a
Steve looked at the text as inconspicuously as he could from his lap in History class, brows pulled together in a frown. He hadn't actually expected Tony to answer at all- much less at a seemingly random time in the middle of class.
Inside the observation deck, Steve stilled. He felt like even the air in his lungs stopped moving for a moment. Tony couldn’t be telling the truth, could he? SHIELD would have no reason for that. They had on-site engineers and scientists developing weapons for them, and contracts—
“Yeah, but see, that’s the thing.” Steve leaned forward and rested on his own knees, suddenly coming no more than an inch away from Tony’s face and looking at him with a smile. “It was how I
“-Fuck, I’m back, you haven’t moved have you? Oh good, okay, so it wasn’t a dream-“ Steve shut his mouth rapidly as he swung his head over to the entrance, watching Tony hurtle down the stairs in faded grey jeans and-
“Something’s wrong,” Tony said suddenly, humour gone from his voice as he looked back down to the cockpit. “Oh, shit. Failsafe.”
“Slow down,” he said anyway, his voice sounding way too urgent over those 2 stupid extra miles, and Steve turned to him in mild confusion before taking his foot off the peddle just a little. He watched the speedometer go back to the limit, feeling like a complete fucking idiot.
“No you won’t,” Tony bent down and swung his legs back and forth against the wall, “look, I’ll help you; just get up to the rafter and I’ll pull you the rest of the way.”
He sat up and Tony rolled off him, letting him pad across the room to grab for his uniform. It was a hassle to head all the way over to Russia on a Tuesday, but it couldn’t be helped, and Steve hoped it wouldn’t take long. These sort of Sciencey divisions of HYDRA tended to be less well equipped in dealing with a supersoldier such as himself. The people they were testing on however… well, that might be a different story.
Steve realised they were slowing down, Loki pulling up the curb next to their apartment, and suddenly all that pent-up energy went into action. Opening the door while they were still slowing to a halt, Steve stumbled out of the moving car and then barely managed to keep on his feet, hearing Loki yell at him from the driver’s seat. He ignored the other boy, instead hurrying over to Thor’s door and pressing repeatedly on the intercom. “It’s Steve,” he breathed, “Thor, open up, it’s—”
Steve pushed off Sam and turned away, starting to march down the street. He paused, in order to point a finger over to Bucky. “You- you leave me alone, you got that?” He yelled across the road.
“You’re not on my side!” Steve snapped, stepping forward, “you’re just… you’re just being weirdly nice so that I let my guard down and then you can make fun of me again, or humiliate me in class or shove me over in the halls. Don’t think I’m not onto you, Stark, okay, I know your game!” He waggled a finger menacingly.
Tony rolled his eyes and hoped Steve wouldn’t be able to see the blush of embarrassment. “I’m not nervous,” he tried, but when Steve just made a disbelieving face at him, Tony huffed. “Alright, I’m a
brimming under his chest, and it was a sensation that Tony had learned experience not to ignore. Bad things tended to happen when they did.
“I think this is just simple fear for my safety more than anything, Buck,” Steve dropped the piece of plastic and then flexed his fingers in mild disgust. He was certain things weren’t supposed to be that sticky.
“All fluff-free,” he declared, “I just spent about ten minutes pulling it all off, so you better eat them now.”
Tony just looked at him sceptically. His face was still pale and washed out, and he looked dead on his feet by that point. They’d only ended up being able to nap for about ten or fifteen minutes, in the end. Tony was still running on almost no sleep. Steve looked over to the boy’s bike on the road with a small frown. He didn’t like the thought of Tony riding like that, and- “wait, Tony, where is your helmet?”
“What the Goddamn hell?” Tony jerked from where he was sat on the floor, turning his eyes away from the gauntlet in his lap and over to Steve, stood behind him with a look of horror etched onto his face, “Tony, what are you
Steve followed him; lying back down on the cot and then taking a good, long look over at his best friend. “Are you okay?” He asked quietly.
Seeing the stone lying there was, as usual, a punch to the gut. Steve sniffed and then cleared his throat, wiping all the rain off his face and then absent-mindedly straightening his shirt out. “Here we are,” he said casually, looking over to Thor, “I… uh, I just gotta clear away some of the- the weeds and stuff.”
Steve just shrugged, swinging his legs off the table. “Lotta things should have killed me,” he declared, looking down at his chest and the Tony-shaped hand that was currently pressing into it.
“A cognitive block,” Bruce had said, and then when Tony had asked what the fuck that meant, he’d just smiled tiredly and told him the name had been invented about five minutes ago. “HYDRA were… there was a lot of testing equipment in the base when we got there. We think that you were their guinea pig, what with your brain being so…”
He watched Steve walk back into the room with them slowly. His eyes were dead, jaw wound so tight that Tony thought he was crushing his teeth. Clearly his searching had led to nothing. Slowly, he pulled off his cowl with shaking fingers, looking over to the shattered glass windows that were currently gusting cold air into the room. Then he turned to the nearest wall, paused for a second, and put his fist through the solid concrete again and again and again until Natasha dragged him away with soothing words and small pleas.
