It made Tony a little unbalanced to be honest, how Peter attached himself to Harley like this in such a short time, it made him want to do research, on this Harley guy who seemed to gain Peter's trust. "Hey, Betty, can you tell me about Harley?" Tony asked the Beta sitting near him getting a confused noise from her. "Peter's friend, who he always goes on and on about; like the two of them are a married couple." Tony stated, getting a snort and a laugh from Betty who nodded her head.
/Warning/: This Chapter contains… maybe cursing, fluffiest fluff, a little sadness, Peter is cutest, Howard is protective, and things are looking up! And who knows what? All reviews are appreciated.
"James!" A voice called out causing Steven and James to turn in the direction of the caller, only to see Petrus run toward them, panting as he reached them while pouting a storm at his son. "Where were you?" Petrus asked his cheeks buffed with how angry he is. "You promised you would come and see the bear with me, but you disappeared as soon as we reached the village square." This time it was a whine as Petrus gazed at James with wide shiny eyes.
"Steve… my parents are dead," Tony said, already dreading what Steve was thinking about, nope, hell to the no! If Steve was thinking about summoning his parents as ghosts or goddammit zombies, Tony would end the man, he would end him, and Serpentine's rage is damn! Tony was not going to repeat that horrifying night all over again, that night still brought him nightmares!
/Warning/: this chapter contains, cursing, a little bit of sadness, fluff, Steve is a grumpy little snowflake but he will get better, and Peter is the cutest little fella out there! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
"And why did you decide to become normal all of a sudden?" Tony asked his words slowly, looking behind Steve, wondering if this was a prank he was unaware of, it was a shitty prank if it was making Steve look like he wanted to burn himself just to feel like himself… well, that was the vibes Tony was getting, anyway. Tony was sure that no Addams in his right mind will want to turn out to be normal least of all Steve, unless… "Please tell me you didn't do that so I would date you…" Tony's eyes fell on the roses in Rogers' hands, the shift Rogers did make Tony's eyes wide in surprise.
Steve knows that it was a crazy thought, that something like that was only a stupid myth, which no matter how much his mother told him about her home in Ireland, that it was only a stupid story… that the Dearg Due was just a myth…
"Let me go, Tony, I'm still angry at you." Steve said as he tried to push the man only for the Alpha to growl at that and pull the blond to him, and Steve hated how he didn't push Tony harder, fearing that he will hurt the man. "Tony, let go!" The Omega ended up snapping, fear rising inside, as the scent of whiskey brought unwanted memories back, making his breath speed up.
"Oh, you're so cute!" Tony said unconsciously as he sat up and brought the boy in his embrace cuddling him like he hasn't seen any cute boy in his life, and a cute one like Peter at that, his action only got him a knowing smirk from Steve and a confused look from Peter. "Of course I will teach you! I will even ask the scary Natasha, the best Ninja in the world to teach you!" Tony purred in pride as he saw his baby's eyes widen at his words and for him to jump happily all around the place as he said yes!
"How did you do that Tony?" Peggy breathed out, eyes wide and sparkling with so much pride and happiness, causing Tony to shift in his place, his face becoming red from embarrassment. Every person in the room gazed at him with pride, and big grins painting their faces, making Tony wonder what he did to deserve this, but happiness took hold of him, the elation of kicking Stane and putting him where he belonged was still thrumming in Tony, making it impossible for the Omega to sit still.
Steve let out a tired sigh as he came to the bed to take a seat, not sitting close to Harley in the fear of sitting him off; his mind was overthinking, trying to find a way to break the subject to Harley without scaring the boy. "You are angry at me, aren't you?" Harley asked in a small voice causing Steve to blink his eyes and turn to the boy who was playing with his hands like they were the most interesting thing in the world.
Didn’t he realize that Peter got worse after that day? He will probably notice if he listens to what Steve said, but it was like there was a barrier between the two of them, a barrier so strong and high, that the Alpha wasn’t even acknowledging their son; their son who start getting worse after that stressful day, who was running a fever, their son who spent most days now throwing up than keeping his food down, their son who always wake up with a nightmare and can’t sleep if Steve wasn’t there with him, their son that if Tony kept his head out of his ass and with them for a little while, he would have realized that the appointment was not for May, but for Peter, who was sick and needed a doctor, he needed Dr. Anna too, and knowing Steve’s luck, his baby was spending at least a couple of weeks in the hospital to get better because he may have caught some infection from the germs that bastard Rumlow had.
"I refuse this union!" Peggy screamed which made everyone look at her, Steven wondering what the hell was going on, and if he should leave already because it seems that Steven throws himself into something that categorizes as 'None of his business!' which made Steven uncomfortable as hell. "As Tony's family and the Alpha of the pack, I refuse this union! I refuse to give my blessing! And unless you want to fight me, Steve, I suggest you make a run for it." Peggy hissed which made the Alpha try and stiffen his growl, looking at Tony who had tears in his eyes and looking at his aunt with a begging look, only for the woman to keep glaring at Steve, which made the man bit the inside of his cheek and get out of the library with no care about being naked.
"J… huh?" Steven asked as he turns to Tony which made the Omega stop himself from fidgeting, it was quite concerning how Steven despite not being an Alpha was doing a good jump of acting like one. "So is he connected to the mansion by any chance?" Steven asked innocently which made Tony, not despite himself which nearly made his heart drop down to his stomach when the man smile. "Perfect, excuse me 'Just A Rather Very Intelligent System' can you help me with something?" Steven called out loud which made Tony nearly have a heart attack right here right now.
The Omega looked at the Alpha harshly, not fearing what the Alpha will throw at him next, after all, he was used to people like this, arrogant kings who think they can rule the world and bend everything to their will. "They would have never served a tyrant willingly, they too, suffered from their family being killed and raped and were forced to work under the same people who did the unspeakable to them daily, I am offering you a deal, I will become your slave in exchange for their freedom… I know that you realize how much value I hold." Those words made the king seethe in rage and he pulled the Omega's left arm through the bars harshly, making the Omega's head hit the bars, an action that gained him curses and threats from the prisoners behind him and a glare from the said Omega, but the king didn't care, the Omega's words rub him the wrong way.
"I promise, Daddy! I will even bring you their corpses as a spoil of war!" Peter cried out happily causing Tony to sniffle and nod his head, lowering himself to the ground to hug his baby tightly, glaring at the other cowering children and parents from over his baby's shoulders, daring them to do anything to his baby and lose their lives.
This time Bucky's voice came from his left side which made Steve let out a confused noise and turn to the side, only to blink his eyes in shock when he realized that he was in a car… he was in a car and Bucky was driving… how? A gentle laugh left Steve's lips, causing his heart to pick up at how his body seemed to be acting on its own without Steve's input.
Tony's heart start beating fast at that happiness taking over him that the Alpha considered his word and accepted that Peter needed help, any other Alpha would have snapped at Tony for middling but it seems that Steve Rogers was not any other Alpha. That thought made a smile taking over his face as his gaze returned to the phone
"I think Jarvis would have stepped in to stop Mom from doing something too embarrassing." Tony's lips twitched up, he couldn't help but remember how his Mom and Jarvis were like; his Mom the troublemaker, who Tony inherit her traits of being trouble of his own, and Jarvis the poor one who took it as his job to stop his Mom and his Dad from doing something stupid.
… his breath hitched at the thought of Howard coming after him and Morgan, how did Howard even manage to take hold of Rhodey's number when he was living in Malibu. Did Howard do something to Rhodey and Pepper? Did he knew about their trip and followed them? Did he use his connections like he always brags and finally found Tony?
Grumbling to himself, Steve finished packing the bags before he left his room, planning on having a long talk with Bucky about how he should move on and forget about him (Which is a little hypocrite coming from Steve) "Bucky, are you there?" Steve asked as he knocked on the door, waiting for a little while, wondering if Bucky went to sleep or he had already stormed out. "Bucky, we need to talk, please open the door." Steve tried to be gentle as he said these words, hoping that the man would show up so that Steve can finally end one of his unfinished businesses. "Bucky, I am coming in…" When he saw that the door was opened, Steve stated that Bucky was either waiting for him inside or that he already left the mansion.
"Maybe… she became a little stern considering that the adoption process is coming to an end?" Steve stated softly holding Tony to his chest tightly; scent-marking his husband while releasing a calming scent hoping that Tony wouldn't get stress at the reminder.
If the room was deadly silent before, it was even more now; because everyone's faces paled at Tony's words, everyone was shaken in place at the hysterical way Tony was losing it. "His… bride?" Peggy choked the word out, the look on her face was one of disgust and horror, informing Tony of the line of thoughts everyone was operating on.
"As much as I am amused by seeing you got sassed by Maria's voice, even more, we need to go to Shield, for statements." Peggy said an amused smile taking over her red lips, smiling when her words made Tony's face get redder than he already was, she was really glad for the AI refusing Tony's request, knowing the Omega, he would have disassembled the AI with no way to put it back together.
' once more, which did nothing but confirm the conclusion that Anton already reached but wanted to deny with every breath he had in his body…
That made the room goes into more awkward silence than before… since when Tony was dying? Peggy was trying to stop herself from biting her lip; Maria couldn't take it anymore and start sobbing, why doesn't Tony tell them about anything? Why does he hide everything to the last second? Peggy remembered the way Tony was acting a year ago, and suddenly the information in Tony's files that she sent Natasha to collect made sense because the Alpha knows that Tony was far away from the egoistic manic Natasha painted him as in her reports. "Is he… is he still dying from the palladium poisoning?" Peggy asked her mind going to Tony's sacrifice play a few days ago, if he actually did it because he knows he was dying and that it didn't matter if he died now.
"No sweetheart, no… just for the rest of mine," Tony whispered making Steve shake his head at that. "Please… this is the only thing I ask of you… please promise me…" Tony's voice cracked at that making Steve whine.
"Yes… it is Mama's Shield…" James offered distracted by the Shield, his small fingers tracing the star with wide eyes, and opened mouth, looking like he saw Odin in the flesh. That piece of information made Anton stop in his place, gazing at the Shield with a wondering look. The queen's Shield? How can Steven use a Shield like this? A piece of metal that offers no control to its user, was useless, so why? Was this some kind of Asgardian weapon of choice? A weapon that only those raised in the mountains knew how to use and mold?
Pepper was with him when it happened, the two of them were cooking breakfast, while Megan was playing in the living room, when his phone start ringing, at first Tony, was confused about who would call him on his day off, he ends up sighing as he went to his phone thinking that it was his father that was calling, but when Tony picked up his phone, his breath left him as he read Sam Wilson's name on the caller ID.
"They have no right to decide; it is my decision to mate whoever I want, I refuse to mate anyone from the Stone family." Anton hissed, nearly letting out a snarl at the thought of him being forced to mate with someone he doesn't even care about, let alone have children with them; worse of all, he will be forced to join houses with the Stone family, something that he was desperate not to do, even if it means fighting to stay in his position, things that Anton had told Jamti every year when he was wasted from drinking too much ale.
"What… what do I own you?" Tony finally whispered after fifteen minutes of silence, as he took the map and looked at the man, his mind warring between running away from this place and this man and believing him, but the thing is, Tony doesn't know how long he has before his father catches up with him, he is already running out of time if Stane is already this close to him… but if there is a chance that what the man was saying to him was true… then there is a chance of Tony saving his baby and raising them in peace, in a place, not even his father knows about!
Letting out a pained noise, Steve tried to move his hands around, which gained him nothing other than a few twitches of his fingers, causing the Omega to whine lowly in his throat before trying once more. Steve didn't know how long he spent trying to move one of his hands, but it took him too long, that he ended up tired as hell, wanting to return back to sleep and ignore the world. But Steve can't do that, he can't, not until he checks on his baby, that he would allow himself the rest his body desperately wants.
which got a nervous giggle from Petrus and a snort from Steven; that's his son. "Anyways… about your betrothal; I am sure you are away of what happened to Brookland… you see, that day ch-" Nicolaus wasn't even able to continue his speech before the sound of horns blaring out, causing Steven and Nicolaus to frown; in the back of his mind, Steven was grateful that Nicolaus was stopped from breaking what's left of his heart, because Steven doesn't need a reminder that his betroth has met his end, or that he as alive elsewhere and already mated with children. "What's going on?" Nicolaus asked, turning his question to Petrus and James when he saw the two pups jumping impatiently with wide grins on their faces.
The next day when Tony finally dares to leave his lab, it was not because he was hungry or that he was sure that Howard has left, it was because this morning when he went through the pictures he had of his son, instead of the ten he counted last night, they were nine… he remembers nearly leveling his house down looking for the picture, he searched all around his house, and in the end, it was for nothing, the picture had disappeared into thin air… he remembers sobbing his eyes in his pup's nursery, it wasn't enough that he was a failure of an Omega who couldn't save his pup, but he also had to lose the only thing he has of his baby that was gone forever.
"Well, that didn't stop you from abandoning us for the past two weeks, did it?" Steve spit out, whirling around until he was facing Tony, ignoring the wide eyes and shocked look the Alpha was giving him not that Steve cared about what Tony was thinking. "You can't seem to get it inside of your goddammit head, so allow me to enlighten you, Mr. Stark." Steve let go of his baby's hand, already missing the reassuring weight of his baby's small hand, but he had to make Tony understand, that he can't do what he did in the past few weeks without there being some dire consequences. "We; that means you and me, don't have that much time left with Peter, because news flash, he is sick! Do you even understand what that means? Don't you understand that any day now, the sickness will be able to defeat Peter, and my son will die; I told you from the start Tony if you can't handle this life then leave!" Steve was tried so hard to stop himself from shouting out loud, mainly because he didn't want to disturb his baby.
From the corner of his eye, Tony saw Natasha as she came toward Tony with a hopeful look on her face, a hopeful look that turned sad and guilty when Tony leveled her with a dark glare that promised pain if she came any closer to him and his baby. When Natasha stopped in her advance, Tony managed to relax and turn around, planning on leaving this place and go through his planes, after all, he had a prey he was going to track.
Two months later, and Steve had never seen a hair from Anthony, and every day his heart was breaking more and more when the Alpha didn't call him or come searching for him, it was breaking Steve slowly… the worse was that Steve fell ill, and with his weak body, Steve knew he will be done for, the worse of it is that he couldn't stop crying, no matter what he tried, by the end of the day Steve will cry himself to sleep, what little sleep he can have which was nothing but four hours a day, and he couldn't eat, for everything that touch his stomach Steve knew he will throw it up later. It gets worse as days went by, it ends with Steve going to the hospital after one of the neighbors to his new and shitty apartment called the ambulance after hearing a crash coming from his apartment.
Tony never changed so fast in his life, he rushed out of his room and toward the stairs, but he paused a little and rushed toward the nursery to get something when everything was set, he rushed out of his house with a huge smile over his face.
"Sir, I need you to let go of the pup." An icy voice said which made the Omega scowl and turn to the person only to see a female officer looking at him with cold eyes; it seems like people finally called the police.
Ever since that day in the hospital, when they pulled him away from his baby, his doctor changed, instead of the vultures that usually surrounded him trying to pull him away from his baby, there was one doctor now, Bruce Banner was his name, a kind Beta who always speak in a calm voice, and ask him his opinion before he does anything. After the second day when his baby hadn't wake up, Tony screamed his lungs off, screaming about what they have done to his baby. The nice doctor had approached him and tried to calm him down, he explained to him that his baby was in a medical-induced coma so he could recover, Tony had cried his eyes out that day, holding his baby tightly.
Tony stripped off his wet coat, taking his friends' and hanging them up over the bath to drip, he pulled on one of his sweaters, smiling when he got out of his room and saw that his friends changed into their as well. Tony then went to fill the kettle and puts it on the stove, fetching mugs from the sink and putting tea bags in the cups, smiling as he heard his friends chatter. He looks out the window at the back yard while he waits for the water to boil, and sees the vegetable patch that he had spent all morning working on in disarray. The stakes and twine have been pulled up and the freshly turned dirt flattened down and churned into mud, and it made Tony's smile dimmed a little as he grumbled, hoping that his friends won't notice, he decided to leave the garden for another day, pouring hot water in the mugs and taking them to his friends.
The workshop's door was knocked on, causing Anton to blink and turn his head to where the sound came from, wondering if Magna or Jamti were on the other side of the door. Walking toward the door, Anton stilled when he smelled the scent coming from behind the door, making his hands clenched into fists and for him to swallow the growl that wanted to be let out. "Open the door, foolish king, I know you are inside." The queen called out, causing Anton to bite his lower lip hard until he tasted blood.
"Why are you playing the innocent here?" Steven finally snapped, he couldn't take this anymore, he has to get this off his chest or it will poison Steven for the rest of his life. "The Hydra king caught one of your people once, an idiot Beta who claimed to be your mate, a Beta with green eyes and blond hair; I made that Beta take a sacred oath, to take my son with him to the safety of Brookland and for him to give you all the scrolls containing the information about Johann. From the security of his palace to where he hid his treasure to the people he enslaved. I sent you a letter begging for your help as one of your people, but you never answered!" Steven hissed wanting to scream but couldn't unless he woke up the children which were something Steven wouldn't do.
"How idiotic can you be?" Bruce had snapped at the doctors after freeing the Omega, glaring at them like he was ready to slaughter them, Bruce's voice made everyone turn to him to see the Beta hissing at the idiots cowering in the corner. "We have an Omega with a three years old pup! Even first-year college students know not to separate the mother from his pup until he is at least five years old, last the Omega's instincts thought the child is dead and fall into heat! A heat that will kill the Omega because he is weak! Steve, try to roll the child's bed here…" Bruce screamed and curses a little more.
"Yes, Dad, I am." Tony smile widens as he said these words, and Howard's heart felt as light as a feather when he saw the happiness radiating off of Tony. Howard could only take hold of Tony's hand and give it a gentle squeeze, words refusing to leave his lips, and Howard was sure if he opened his mouth now he will start sobbing…
At first, Bucky didn't answer for a long time, making Steve think that his question will remain unanswered, only for Bucky to clear his throat and shift, turning to Steve with soft eyes. "Well, other than the fact that I'm the kid's uncle and wanting to be the first one to know the gender… I think you deserve more than being left alone to deal with everything while my brother gets his shit back under control; besides, I like you, so being outside with you is no hardship at all." Bucky stated, making Steve flush pleasantly at the sincere tone the Alpha used; Steve won't admit that it made him happy that at least someone seemed to understand and want to be there for him, it really made him happy.
Harsh breaths left Steven's lips, his want to find his baby was stronger than any rational thought that wanted to make a presence in his mind. "James…" Steven mutters over and over under his breath, his body growing colder and colder every second that passed, the terror of losing his child dominating his mind.
On the other hand, Steve still hasn't seen Bucky after that day, he probably scared the other Alpha to death if Bucky was getting out of his way to avoid him, which was making him sad, for he thought that he and Bucky had made good progress and became… well, friends, he had hoped the two of them became friends, but Bucky was still avoiding him like he was the plague.
Slowly, so slowly in fear of this beautiful mirage was going to disappear if he moved fast. Steve sat up and took the sight of his friends and loved ones in daze, a small smile on his lips, he missed his friends so much, when was the last time he saw his friends this young, this healthy, and have that little glow of happiness that surrounding them, instead of the regret and pain and hurt that coat, everyone, since Ultron.
"Boys, go shower and then dressed, it's Friday and you have to go to the clinic." Peggy said happily which got a groan from Tony, but a happy squeal from Peter, considering that the small pup loves going to the clinic to draw and play with the other children, he even made a friend named Harley! Which made Tony and Steve happy they even promised that Harley can spend a night with them, but after both Tony got better, which made Peter pout a little at that, but forget all about it when Goose starts playing tag with him.
5-Essentially a marriage in Vikings' age was nothing but a business contract between two families. A marriage was arranged in two stages: the betrothal and the wedding. The initiative had to come from the man or his father, who would propose marriage to the woman's father or guardian. If the latter was agreeable, the groom promised to pay the bride price (Mundr). In Iceland the minimum payment was 8 ounces of silver; in Norway, it was 12. In return, the bride's father promised to hand over her dowry at the wedding. Both the bride price and the dowry remained the property of the bride after the wedding. The two men shook hands on the agreement in front of witnesses and agreed on a date for the wedding, usually within a year. The woman's consent to the marriage might be sought but it was not necessary. That's why Tony thought Steve was crazy for agreeing to marriage without any witness to confirm the agreement or have money to pay for the dowry. Not only that but widows in medieval usually wait three years before remarrying (The ideal waiting time) though every individual is different and could remarry if and when they decide to do so.
Steve couldn't help but start imagining his future; for a long time, Steve wished for a child, a child that he will love and spoil and grant them their every wish. Now, now after a long time, Steve finally gained his wish; him having a child with the love of his life, a child that will know he was loved and accepted and wanted no matter what.
It made Tony concern, the way his baby was acting, it nearly made Tony kick his own butt; his boy has obviously had a trauma because of what happened with the Scarlet Witch, but Tony was too busy because of the near world's domination to pay attention to his own boy until it was too late.
"That what the fuck did you give him?" Jarvis snapped, finally getting feed up with the way Howard was acting; uncaring and cold, nearly causing Jarvis to attack his once friend, it makes him wonder if the old Howard was there somewhere inside the cold empty shell in front of him…
Reaching the end of the stairs, Tony was about to whoop in joy; he was already planning how to whoop Steve's ass, because how in the name of the seventh hell did the stairs leading downstairs exist? It was impossible, especially when his workshop taking all of the basement levels. Reaching the end of the stairs, Tony blink his eyes when he saw the blood-red door in from of him, and he had to say, if Steve was trying to recreate the movie series 'Insidious' he was doing it quite well.
3-Norse had weekly fully immersive baths indicates that nudity did not have the same status at that time as nudity does today. In fact, going by later graphics of mixed-gender communal bathing, even the nudity of the opposite gender was acceptable, and even normal to some extent, that's why Tony wasn't that affected bathing with Pepper and Natasha, even being a male between females. Considering that this is an A/B/O story, I think that this would have put many boundaries and different thoughts, of what is accepted between Omegas and other dynamics, mainly because of all the pheromones involved.
Day after day his heart broke, and he couldn't handle it anymore, because he knew one more heartbreak and his light will be gone forever, so with that, he went to Sara wanting this all to be over, not wanting to remember anymore, not wanting to fell the heartache anymore, and he was grateful to Sara because she helped him, she helped and in the next century and a half he never gazes at that retched Midgard anymore, and the heartbreak becomes a dull ache, and his love for his Anton become an irritation and anger mixed with little hate, because why wasn't Anton born as a star? It would have been easier if he was born as a star or a God from Asgard or any other realm, because then Steven wouldn't have been forced to see him die again, and again, and again…
"As much as it is tempting to elope with you, sweetheart, our parents will kill us if we dared to do such a thing; don't forget about Winnie, she will skin us alive." Steve murmured as he separated the invitations into three sections, the 'Yes', 'No', and 'Maybe' which made Tony give a pleasing purr at how consideration his Alpha was.
"Where have you been? I searched for you all over the place, didn't I tell you not to let go of my hand in new places?" The Alpha scolds his pup after putting him on the ground which only made the pup pout and looks down at his shoes.
Margaret screamed as she looked at the Omega, his eyes wide and wild refusing to believe that the Omega sold himself to the Iron King to gain their freedom, was it not enough? The queen has been under Johann's thumb for over a decade, and now he treaded that prison for another? Another that not one of them knew about!
"FUCK!" Tony cursed for the millionth time as he dragged his suit behind him, panting and growling as he pulled the half-ton or something of metal behind him, growling to himself, grumbling to himself when the communication line didn't work after the fiftieth time he tried to fix it, which made Tony do nothing but curse loudly with so many different curses that if anyone saw him right now they will blush in embarrassment and mortification and his aunt will scream at him her favorite word "Language!".
In the end, they did go on a date, just the two of them, the Alpha took him on a traditional date, to the movies and then dinner, enjoying their time as they sat close to each other in the back of the theater, making fun of the movie and laughing together, and Tony really wanted to kiss the Alpha silly, but it seems that the Alpha didn't want their first kiss to be in the back of the dark theater, which as much as it made Tony pout, he was grateful for that, because he really wanted his first kiss with Steve to be special.
Tomorrow his baby will probably break his fever, and he will cry himself sick when he noticed that he got sick on Christmas day. Tomorrow if the fever didn't break it meant that Steve has to wait a few more days, weeks, for his baby to get better; it will only lead to more heartbreak when his babe noticed how long he was sick, and not even Steve will be able to calm him down.
If you are wondering what Steven looks like, then he looked like how he was in Endgame with the slightly long hair. As for Steve he looked just like in The First Avenger, I think there is a lot of difference in their looks from the first movie to the last, maybe I will make Steven grow his beard once more? Who knows, though you can vote on that!
It was a few tense minutes of Tony glaring at Bucky and Peggy; his arms were tight around his crying baby as he took in how Peggy kneeled down and started to collect the pieces of articles Tony managed to steal from the library yesterday. It was only when Bucky and Peggy finally left closing the door behind them that all the strength left Tony's body, causing him to let out loud sobs as he slides to the floor, chocking when his eyes took in the blood of Steve Rogers that was disappearing in front of his eyes and the living room once more was back to its perfect state…
The sound of the door being opened made Tony look up at Stane, he pressed his trembling lips together and swallows, he had to save his baby. "Please…" Tony plea making Stane snorts at him and put the tray of food on the ground and turned to leave… no, no, no! Tony longed at Stane clinging to him. "Please, please, please, help him!" He pulled Stane back making the man nearly lost his balance for a second.
Though the year 2008, brought unwanted heartaches and pain to Steve, it all starts with the Omega returning back home from work only to see that his baby was crying, with May trying to calm him down, when he rushed to his son, he saw the news, Tony Stark was taking a hostage after the terrorist group attacked and killed the soldiers that were with him, it had made Steve shake but what made him break down and cry uncontrollably was the picture of Bucky Barnes one of the soldiers that was assigned to escort Tony Stark, had been declared dead after they found his arm. Steve had cried that day holding his son tightly, May didn't know what to do but stay with the two of them that night, Steve still couldn't believe what he heard or saw, but the truth was there… his best friend died protecting Tony Stark…
It took three hours before everyone left; in those three hours Steve nearly lost his mind with all the boozing around that seemed to happen. Tony had ended up giving the note Steve received and the photo to the police, only to be told that they couldn't legally do anything unless something happened; this nearly made Steve snap and start a screaming match of his own if it wasn't for Bucky holding him back and reassuring him that everything will turn out alright, Steve would have started a damn fight here and now.
"…You have been in a coma for two weeks now, thankfully you woke up, aunt Peggy was about to say fuck it and bring Dr. Cho and few other doctors to see what is wrong, even Thor, he went back to Asgard to search the whole 'Darkness lurking within' stuff, you know, you should have told us that you have a serious case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, I would have at least help… after running a few tests that is." Tony offered as he wiggled his eyebrow which caused Steven to snort and shake his head.
"Papa said that if I wanted to grow up like him I need to eat healthy food, he gives me a cookie after I finish lunch." The pup said with a nod which made Tony's smile widen at that without his conscience. The small pup is too cute! Tony thought with a happy smile as he washed his hands before starting with lunch.
"P-Pepper Potts…" The woman answered shakily which made Steven narrow her eyes at her, he already knows that the woman was not the type to change her last name after marriage; she didn't even change her name when she married Tony, so he didn't take that as a fact.
His words made Rogers pause and he turned to Tony, and the man had to stop in his place as he took in Rogers's face, this was the first time that he actually saw Rogers's face without it being covered by his mask, and in the back of his mind, he grumbly admitted why everyone may have a small crush on the man. "Oh, hello, Mr. Stark, you arrived just in time, I was about to bury this poor animal." Rogers said as he gave a small (creepy, if Tony had anything to say) smile, lowering the box in the hole.
"Yes…" Steve ended up saying, which made the Omega, let out a hitched breath, and Steve hated himself, especially when he saw the unshed tears in the Omega's eyes, he can see Tony opening and closing his mouth like he wanted to say something but he can't, like words refuse to leave him.
"You are moving fast, don't you think, sweetheart?" Tony teased, gasping when one of Steve's hands sneaked under his shirt going straight to his chest without leaving him a chance to breathe. Steve on the other hand just hummed as he went to town on Tony's neck, gaining gasps and moans, and sighs of pleasures. "If the flight attendance saw -Ah- u-us… you -Mm- are g-going to pay for their therapy…" Tony's breathing hitched, purring deep in his chest when his mate hummed and start kissing him in earnest…
"…Ma and Pa are coming here, soon. You can't imagine how ecstatic they were to learn that you finally woke up... we have been waiting, Stevie… it was seven long years…" Becky said through her sobs, causing Steve to raise his head to take the woman in, taking how young and vulnerable she was, how her words were sincere without any lies or deceit.
Steve stalked toward the place he thought he heard Bucky's voice coming from a growl nearly leaving his throat. "What the fuck is wrong with you! It wasn't enough that you destroyed my life with Steve now you want to destroy my son's?" Tony's screams of rage were heard as Steve reached the door the shouting was coming from, Tony's words made Steve pause, but only for a second because he thrust the door open hard making it slam on the wall behind, which made everyone jump and look at him. "Steve…" Tony breathed out as Steve stalked in the room his eyes on Howard Stark who was sitting on his chair behind the desk with a glass of whiskey in his hand.
A pleased smile spread across Tony's face. "Then yes." That was the last thing before their lips met again and Steve drew Tony to his chest by his waist. Tony nipped at Steve's bottom lip unsure and then sucked on it until Steve opened his mouth and their tongues slowly and wetly stroked against another; in the back of his mind, Steve wondered if Nat had anything to do with this, knowing her, she probably gave Tony the sex talk in full details.
"Some of those books aren't for two months babies, you know?" Maria's lips twitched up when she saw the flushed look Tony was sporting (Tony really need to thank his mother for the acting classes she forced him to take) "This book is for six years old, and that book is for ten years old… are you sure you didn't pick those books for yourself?" Maria's snarky reply caused Tony to choke and give a loud protesting 'Hey!' pouting when the woman rolled her eyes at his childish actions. "With how engross you were with them, I believe that you didn't come here for Morgan." Maria shook her head and let out a sigh, a few minutes later Tony had a few books in front of him. "Age-appropriate books," Maria stated as she stood up.
"Not too much ice-cream, tomorrow is movie night I can't have Peter hyped up on sugar when tomorrow is coming." Tony stated, giving both Steve and Peter a narrow look, gaining giggles from the two of them as they waved goodbye to Tony and left the workshop; it was only when Steve was away that Tony finally noticed.
"Of course, sweetie, why don't you start drawing while I bring the Shield?" Steve questioned gently as he steered the boy toward the coffee table that had sketch pads and coloring pencils, leaving the boy as he went to his room to get the Shield. He wondered what he was going to do if the situation continued to head south, wondering if he should try knocking on the lab's door once again and check on Tony, maybe plead with him to come out for Peter's sake.
"I am sorry Margaret, though I am fine now, so please do not cry." Steven whispered, which caused the Beta to let out a sob before gazing at him with teary eyes; looking at Margaret's face, it reminded Steven that Margaret was still young, just fifteen springs, who didn't know that much about the world that asked too much of her. "I am here now, do not cry, you know I hate it when you and James do that." Steven kissed Margaret's forehead, which caused the Beta to shudder and hide her face in his neck.
"What do you mean I have to come to the office, Fury? It's eight PM, on my day off!" Steve's voice filtered to the living room, causing the three to turn their heads to the hallway to see Steve talking with Fury on the phone, the Alpha's annoyed and agitated voice, made Tony concern about his husband, especially, when the Alpha was left in that state since Peggy Carter left their house earlier that morning. "Of course I am going to take the next four days off, we agreed on that Fury!" Steve's raising voice caused Tony to sigh, knowing that his mate was far too agitate and angry by the tone he was using on Fury.
"You are welcomed… JARVIS." Steve said back with a smile, feeling lighter then he felt in… years now. But his smile dropped as he read the next text JARVIS wrote.
“What the hell Tony! How did Rogers propose and only now we knew about it, that’s an outrage!” Rhodey complained, but looking closely, Tony noticed the tears in his best friend's eyes, making him chuckle and let go of Pepper, only to go to Rhodey and pull him in a tight hug.
Tony’s head whirled to them and Steve took it as his sign to run to his Alpha, trying to stop himself from becoming overwhelmed and stat sobbing, the shock was still in his system, it didn’t leave him fully no, Steve had so many things to be concern about and one of them his baby, who was sleeping in May’s house. “S-Steve…” That was all the warning Steve got before he was pulled into a tight embrace.
I admit I wrote and rewrote the chapter but it didn't reach the satisfying levels I was going after… sad... it seemed much better in my mind, something I couldn't write apparently…
Getting inside the room, Tony's eyes, widen in fear when he saw Steve thrash and writhing on the bed, pain, and hurt and agony, in every twitch of his body, causing disbelieve and pain to go down Tony's heart… why? Why Steve? Why did it always end up with Steve being hurt and him having to watch from the sideline hopelessly, why not him?
He went home a month later, he went home remembering the way he looked at his father, remembering the last words he said to him, spite at him in fact…
Bucky though, only paused in his glaring to send Steve a confused look. "He went out today, something about talking with the security or the insurance company or whatever; he left right after your friend came." Bucky stated, turning to glare at the Beta who seemed to bump into things more than walking around, an action that caused the Beta to squeak. "He didn't say when he was going to return, but he will probably be back before dinner?" Bucky tried to assure him, something that Steve doesn't know if he appreciated it or not.
"How could you do that? How could you? I was happy, I was finally happy! I was going to be a father, but you destroyed it all, destroyed everything like the plague that you are!" Tony screamed, the words made the room become quiet, Maria lowered her hands and took a step back her mouth opening and closing not knowing what to say, Pepper, let out a choked gasp as she nearly fell off if it wasn't for Bruce helping her keep steady, as for the rest of the team they kept silent not knowing what to say
Stars… Steven's eyes widen as he sat up with a cry, looking at the dark sky with horror, nearly letting out a shriek when he looked around him, then he looked at himself, his breath coming out in short gasps as his mind trying to take everything in, trying to make a sense of this mess he found himself in.
"Oh, no, it's OK… it's just we don't talk about Peter's mother that much." Steve ends up saying which made Tony hum at that and walk beside the Alpha, the two of them spent the time chatting a little bit, with Peter running between their legs altering between hugging Tony's legs and demanding to be carried by Steve, which was a little bit strange for Tony how forward the little pup was, but it was sweet, and Tony did give Steve a tip or two about how to control over-energized pups… babysitting Clint's pups comes with that territory.
"What a joyful sight… hopefully it will still be after Tyber and his sister arrive. Petrus is usually quiet when the two of them show up." Magna said, her smile wide as her gaze followed Petrus and his friends (And that's what the queen's babe was, the friend that Petrus never had) only for her smile to deem a little at the mention of Tyber. Gods above, what would Anton do to get rid of this dilemma he was forced into for years now? Ever since that day Tyber lied about stealing the information Anton's people needed from the Hydra king, the villagers tried to match Anton with him or with his sister, hoping that the Stone clan fortune will rub onto them… if only those foolish people knew the heartbreaking truth.
Steve smiled at the childish actions of his husband, accepting Tony's hand as he stood up; ever since the supermarket accident, Tony seemed to warm up to Bucky. They still glare at each other and huff when something doesn't go the way the two of them wanted, but they stopped fighting and screaming at each other, and for Steve that was a huge step up from how the two of them used to fight and blame each other for silly things.
"Is she?" Tony asked, tightening his hold on Morgan even if he said these words; Tony promised, he promised that even if the truth was going to come out, this baby was always going to be his Morgan no matter who were her real parents. "Her eyes… they are blue… no one in my family or her rapist of a father has blue eyes," Tony said through gritted teeth, his hands shaking as he saw the wide eyes that gazed at him with shock, even confusion was there in the mix.
"But you didn't deny that he is hot~" She sing-song at that, which got her a glare from Tony causing her to laugh happily at that. "Tell me is he single? If he is, then why aren't you taping that? I know I would like to ride him." Darcy said with a whistle which got a growl from Tony, the thought of this fellow Omega stealing the Alpha and the pup but him on edge! The smirk on Darcy's face made him realize what he just did and his glare increased.
Steve smiled at that and went to the attached room, and nod at Jarvis who was with the pup, Jarvis had a smile on his face making Steve feel lighter as he starts pushing the child's bed through the door, with Jarvis' help. When they reentered the room, they saw Maria screaming her heads off at the doctors, while Bruce was explaining to Peggy and Howard what was going to happen to the Omega and child if they were forced to be separated.
Tony hummed a little as he steers the sauce, checking the chicken in the oven, smiling when he saw that it was done, looking at the clock Tony found that it was 5:30 PM which meant that he has at least half an hour before the Alpha and the pup will show up, checking the food once more and smiling in pleasure when everything turned out how he wanted it. Looking at the clock Tony rushed to his room so that he will be able to change, he looked at his black-dressed pants and a scarlet button-up shirt with pursed lips, hoping that it wouldn't be too much for a dinner between friends, Tony tried to tame his hair a little using gel, nearly squeaking when he heard the doorbell go off, which caused Tony to rush down the stairs nearly tripping and bash his head before he found his balance and rushed to the door, clearing his throat as he opened the door, smiling happily when he saw Steve and Peter waiting for him.
When the three of them returned back to the mansion, Tony couldn't help from glancing at Steve every five seconds, a blush taking over his face as he remembered today's events, and he was thankful for the mask for not showing his (By now) red face. Steve, on the other hand, has this huge smile taking over his face, especially when he smelled the scent of a happy and sleepy pup, and the scent of content Omega inside of the car.
That made Tony growl and hiss at Stane, only to see Stane looking at him with a smug face, he was going to kill that bastard! "What the fuck?" Tony snapped taking a step after step intended to at least hit Stan and break something.
The sound of his door getting knocked on made Tony blink his eyes, a pout forming on his lips at the thought of leaving his warm blanket to answer who it was. The knocking on his door continued, which made Tony groan in annoyance and stand up, wrapping the blanket around him as he shuffled toward the door, still sleepy from his nap.
When Steve entered his and Tony's room, he saw that the Omega was still lying on the bed, but he was awake, looking at the wall with a tired look in his eyes. "You weren't harsh on him, were you?" The Omega asked causing the Alpha to shake his head, making the Omega sigh in relief and whisper in a low voice. "Good…" While returning his gaze to the wall causing the Alpha to sigh at that, and head toward the bed, lying behind the Omega and pull him in his embrace which made the Omega shudder a little before he relaxed.
"Is that so…" Tony said slowly, his hand twitching like mad as he glared daggers at Howard, hoping the man would burn to ashes with the power of his glare alone. "Then do tell; were you ever going to tell me that you sold me to the Addams family just so you would survive and live here?" Tony asked in a low voice, trying to restrain himself from doing something stupid like throwing the vase in front of him at Howard and breaking his head.
He ends up going to Happy and Pepper's house with a gift, Pepper cried and hugged him tightly when she saw him standing there waiting, Tony finally met his niece, a bubbly six months old that he held for the first time and cried while he did that, he never wanted to let her go…
Steve only pressed his lips tightly after Tony explained how he found Harley, the boy being on the run for ten days, Betty's call, and what Tony told his friend; it was exhausting when Tony woke up today he thought of nothing but buying cakes and sweets for his family so they will enjoy them after a hard day of working and school, what Tony didn't imagine was finding his son's best friend being on the run and probably starving himself. Who knows what kind of unsavory people Harley was forced to socialize with? Who knows where he slept and what he spent his days doing? How could Betty not tell him anything when she already knew that everyone in the Rogers family was attached to Harley in some way or another?
take me, come on, I've been so fucking wet and I want you-" Tony couldn't continue though, because of the hard grind Steve gave, causing him to let out a loud moan.
Tony thought to himself. "But I already have an Alpha." He said offhandedly making the dining hall became silent.
"Does that mean, he is my…?" The words trailed off as they left the boy, causing Howard to tilt his head as he took in the boy; the small one looks like the picture. He looks so much like the picture that Howard wanted to go to the boy and pull him in his arms, but Howard reigns himself in, he doesn't want the little one to be afraid of him because he couldn't hold himself in.
"So, what did Winnie do this…" Tony's words trailed when he opened the door, furrowing his eyebrow when he saw a strange woman standing on the other side of the door. The woman was familiar in a way that made Tony furrow his eyebrows, wondering where he saw the woman before. "Can I help you, Ma'am?" Tony asked when he saw the woman frown and a scowl nearly took over her face, causing Tony to tense.
Tony was so deep in thoughts that he didn't hear the rustle behind him until it was too late, Tony let out a choked scream when someone gripped him from behind and pulled him away from the deck. Tony screamed and tried to thrash away from the strong grip pulling him from his hair, chocked on a scream that wanted to be let out when the person behind him gripped him around his neck, flashing the knife in his free hand which made Tony freeze in his place and stops thrashing, his eyes refusing to leave the knife.
Steven woke up with a choked gasp, his eyes wild and frighten as he darted from one place to another; trying to find the threat that will come toward his children and take them away from him. "James…" Steven's voice cracked as he sits up from his lying position, terror taking over him when he didn't see his son anywhere near him. Steven's heart nearly stopped beating; the fear of Johann returning back from beyond to take James from him to Hel is too much. "James!" Steven tried to call his son once again, hoping that his voice was loud enough to call his babe back, but unfortunately, his voice was faint.
"Overreact? Me? Of course, you would blame me for your mistakes! The only reason for me 'Overreacting' is because you are absent all the time! You are never here when I need you; always off to do something or another while ignoring that you have a very pregnant Omega at home who needs you. The only reason I am overreacting is that my absent husband is finally making time for me, and it turned out, it was because he felt guilty for cheating on me! How wouldn't I overreact?!" Steve screamed, his hands itching to get a hold of anything and throw it at Tony, maybe then the Alpha would get back to his sense and apologies for being an unfaithful piece of shit.
… are giving the special treatment you know?" Steve said spitting the word 'Kind' making shiver go down every person in the room. "Those who hurt Omegas, especially pregnant ones… those have a special place in the prison's hierarchy, abused… tortured… use of the Alpha voice… nearly killed… raped… gangbanged? Is that the right word for it, I don't know?" Steve said with a happy smile throwing some pictures in front of Stane, you can see how Stane's face becomes so pale that it turned green. "If you talked… I can give you a deal. An isolated cell, only for you, a small little box away from the other inmates who will enjoy holding you down and do whatever your little mind can imagine… what do you think?" Steve hummed happily watching how Stane start shaking as the realization of how much he messed up start hitting him, Steve pushed a file toward Stane with a pen inside, Stane opened the file and with shaky hand after reading what was inside he signed the papers.
"Edith?" Steve asked getting a laugh out of Tony, making the older man look at Steve with tired but amused eyes. "What does it meant?" Steve asked as he sat on the chair once more, taking Tony's hand in his.
"S-so he is not a bad man?" The pup asked shakily, his words small and unsure like he wanted to desperately believe in the Omega's words, but what he saw was still playing in his mind, stopping him from hoping, and it broke Tony's heart. A year of bonding between his son and Alpha was just flushed down the drain not a few seconds ago because of him and his rash decision… Just so that he would be able to test…
"What do you want me to think then?!" Tony stuttered backing away from the angry ghost until his back hit a wall behind him, shivering when his way out of here became blocked by an angry ghost. "It's not like anyone married an Addams in fifty years, maybe seventy! No one knows anything about your clan, other than you terrorizing Normal people and probably killing them for fun! Of course, no one will dare to marry an Addams knowing that!" Tony tried to defend himself, hoping that the ghost in front of him won't get angrier than she already was. "And with my rotten luck of course I will land in an abusive relationship again! As if my last relationship and the one before it didn't prove that already!" Tony huffed, only to raise an eyebrow as the dolls gasped with Serpentine, letting their knives drop once more… OK, what's wrong with those rats?
It ended with the three of them staying for an hour at Angie's diner, bickering and laughing and annoying each other until they were done and made the plan to return to Tony's house, the three of them were talking about doing a movie marathon which got Tony a little bit excited it has been ages since the last time he saw a movie. Tony let out a happy hum as he waited for Rhodey and Pepper outside of the diner, the two of them had gone to pester Angie about the secret ingredient for the amazing coffee she makes (Not that he tried it, being pregnant and all, but it made him pout when he saw people moan in pleasure after the first sip) something that Tony knows the two of them won't get, for Angie always protected the secrets to her amazing food like a dragon protecting its treasure.
/Warning/: This chapter contains cursing, sadness, a little bit of violence, feelings, near mentally breakdowns, mention of past abuse, mention of rape, panic attacks, maybe fluff? And Steve finally gets his shit together… And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
"Your… eyes…" Howard muttered scared to the bones, this was the first time he saw eyes like this, the only time he saw something like this was in the war when few Alphas went feral and start ripping each other apart.
Steve was too frozen to protest at Bucky's action; part of Steve was embarrassed at the thought of Bucky coming with him to his appointment, another part was thankful that Steve won't be leaving the house alone and risk finding another note in his car. Taking a few breathes to calm himself Steve went to the fridge, pursing his lips when he found a few sticky notes that Steve put there hoping that Tony will see. Cursing himself for his stupidity, Steve took a pen from his pocket and wrote on a note.
"No… it's a-about yo-ur baby." Howard said making Tony freeze at that, his grip going slack until his father's hand fell from him.
Tony could only press his lips into a thin line as he gazed at Bucky doll as it let out angry squeaks as it tried to attack Tony. The man of iron could only look down at the doll as it latched itself into his leg, trying to stab him in the leg with its Shield that was made from fabric. With a tired sigh, Tony shook his leg harshly dislodging the doll from it, he then walked back inside of his workshop; signaling to his A.I. Tony gazed at the doll as it sat up and shook itself, standing up and running toward Tony, only to have the door close in the doll's face.
Taking the ring, Steve’s eyes took in Tony who was struggling to hold his grin by biting his lower lip, which gave Steve the confidence to do what he was planning. “You know I planned a long speech preparing for this day for months now.” That earned him a lighthearted chuckle from Tony, for Tony never doubted that Steve actually prepared for this day for months, after all, Steve was the man with a plan. “But I think the most important question is. Will you marry me?” Steve asked with a hopeful face, making Tony smile and nod his head enthusiastically.
The sound of branch breaking made the Omega blink his eyes tiredly and look at where he thought the sound came from, blinking when he saw no one in sight, it was probably a squirrel, that was all Steven could think of as he stood intending to head back to the garden and finish his work, wondering if he really plans on bothering himself with cooking when he already knew that the Iron King will end up screaming at him, it was a wonder that he didn't catch on Steven burning his food on purpose.
"Sir, I am finally back from SI I hope you know the kind of danger that you nearly throw me… oh, hello?" The familiar voice of Jarvis made Steven blink and turn to the sound only to find, Jarvis… not any Jarvis at that, but a human Jarvis who was looking at Steven and then Steve with a strange look, Steven didn't know who was more shocked to see the other, Steven for seeing a living, breathing, light brown-haired man with brown eyes, Jarvis, or Jarvis for seeing two Steve Rogers at the same time even when one of them was older.
"Help… me…" The pained moan coming from every direction of the gym made Thor tense as he turned around to see who dared to call him. "H-help me!" This time the caller was that of a woman, and strangely it was the sound of his mother which caused Thor to tense like a bow ready to shoot as he turned around the place hoping to see who dared to hurt his family. "Please, help us!" This time it was Loki's voice, which made Thor shake in his place as he tried to find where his family was so that he would save them, but no matter where he looked he didn't find any trace of them anywhere.
Everything was weird, that was the only thing that Tony could think of. It was a month after Pepper and Rhodey left, and Tony can only think of how weird it was, how weird his home was becoming. The cold spots, the missing items, the strange noises Tony heard in the middle of the night, continued as time went by; the only difference is Tony feeling like he was being watched constantly. No matter how many times Tony ordered Jarvis to scan his home, nothing ever showed up; no videos of ghostly things floating, no darting shadows, no clear images of something strange; nothing. The same could be said about the lake and the monster it housed, but the monster was always a strange creator showing up whenever he (They?) liked. That didn't matter to Tony at this moment, instead of trying to solve the mystery of the lake; Tony spent all his attention trying to solve the mystery of the house and the ghost that thought it was welcomed into Tony and his daughter's lives.
Tony sighed as he reached the town, pausing for a second before pasting a smile on his face as he continued his way, cheerfully waving to the people stopping to chat with him about something. Seeing the happy faces that greeted him made Tony feel sad and heartbroken; finally, Tony had a place to call home… at least that's what Tony thought. Tony thought that he was finally free to raise his daughter in peace, that there wouldn't be any pain or fear; Tony thought that the only lie he had to live with was the lie about his name and from where he was, he thought he would be safe in a town that doesn't even exist on maps… the truth… the truth that Tony learned was a hard pill to swallow, especially when he loves the town and everyone in it.
"A letter… from whom?" Tony asked as he stood up to stretch his legs, and walk toward Bruce who shrugged and gave Tony the letter when he stood near him, Tony blink and took the letter, gasping as he read the name, his gasp made everyone turn to Tony who became pale and opened the letter with shaky hands nearly ripping the thing off.
But the Omega didn't care about that, as he snarled and attacked the Alpha who hurt the babe, punching him in the neck which made the man choke and fall down, trying to catch his breath desperately. Six against one, was never a fair fight, especially when they didn't target him alone, but also two pups, one inside of his womb and another that was trying to protect him, but was getting hurt because of that, and Steven was thankful that his babe wasn't here with him, lest he did something to protect him and got hurt badly.
"So… you are going to let a defenseless pregnant Omega walking in the streets of Manhattan alone?" Steve asked in a small voice, his lips trembled as he gazed at Bucky with wide shocked eyes. Steve didn't even need to count to three to see how Bucky's eyes widen with panic and shock; Steve thank his mother silently for signing him up for acting classes when he was young.
"I'm sorry, I promise I will do better, please Steve, don't leave me…" Tony plea as he took a step toward Steve trying to pull him in his arms; Steve doesn't know if he should push Tony away and march back toward Bucky, leaving his husband alone just as his husband left him for the past few months, a part of Steve still hasn't forgiven the Alpha yet, not after what he had done.
In and out, a calm breath, act like everything was OK, like you don't feel and that nothing concern you anymore, something Nebula was used to and continued to act as even as years passed. In and out, it was easy, the easiest task Nebula was required to perform, stay calm; try not to show any emotion until you are done with your task. A deep breath after a deep breath Nebula took, trying not to scrunch her nose at the foul stench she was subjected to.
"I really don't know, Tony, I have Peter to think of." Steve said carefully which made the Alpha look at Steve because it wasn't a no, but it wasn't a yes either, but it gave him hope, hope that maybe Steve will give him a chance in the end, after all this was his sweetheart, his lovely smart Omega who always forgive everyone… who wasn't a bully that was.
"I wish I could, but you know, I have honey bear's birthday, and not forget preparing for the… you know…" Tony pout when he saw Steve's grin widen even more at the bashful look Tony was sporting, the Omega didn't have it in himself to scold the Alpha, he is just so happy about today that Tony decided to let it slide this time, but it doesn't mean that Steve won't pay for it the next time, with kisses and foot-massage that is.
So when the Avengers finally were called to fight Loki, Tony was more on board with that, maybe he could even convince the God of mischief to break Rogers' spell for the right price! Rogers was with them that mission, which, as much as Tony screamed his head off at his teammates to not do this stupid thing, no one listens to him anymore, which made him huff and buff until his face was red, and he ignored Rogers who tried to follow Tony like a puppy with pleading eyes… he got repulsor to the face, but unfortunately, Rogers was able to avoid the blast.
The next few days preparing the house and installing Jarvis was a little hectic in every imaginable way possible; from preparing the playroom that Tony found in Morgan's room (Which Pepper called magical wonderland), to cleaning and repairing the house (The holes Rhodey and Tony made and didn't use still glared at them), to rebooting Jarvis and waiting for him to confirm if the attachment Tony and Rhodey made were working (Which thankfully they did. Tony will never tell Rhodey and Pepper how proud he was when he heard the A.I. through the speakers installed in the house; though he suspects they knew), to many other minor things that Tony liked to get busy working on.
"She is your daughter Tony, I don't know what is running through your mind right now, but don't you dare think that the girl in your arms isn't yours," Bucky growled, probably getting feed up with what's going on around him, probably feeling threatened with how unbalanced everything was and how Tony was going nuts.
"Come on Peter… it's time to sleep." Steve muttered rocking the baby when he scrunches his nose like he was about to wake up. Once upon a time, Steve and Anthony talked about having children, and maybe gave a name or two, and that name, Peter's name, was the last thing he got from his Alpha other than his baby, it was the last thing he got before his Alpha died and that… that Tony Stark took his place.
Steve didn't know what to do; he can see perfectly that Tony was breaking as his eyes took in the destroyed room, tears gathering in his eyes as his hands start shaking. "Tony… I… I'm sorry…" Peter whispered as he looked at Tony whose wide eyes were filling with tears, his breath hitching when he saw Tony's breath speeding up as the Omega opened and closed his mouth, not being able to say a word, which caused the Omega to let his tears fall.
It was for a second… maybe more than a second… but felt his hand being squeezed weakly; causing him to look at his mate once more (He doesn't even know since when he turned his sight away). His mate, his Steve, his love, looked up at him for a second, looked up at him and gave him a tired smile, even with the pain wracking his body; a smile that caused Tony to lose the strength in his legs and fall down on the floor beside the bed, his eyes losing all the life in them when he finally realized the meaning of that smile.
"The winner has arrived!" Tony cheered as he entered the kitchen with Peter sitting on his shoulders pouting, Steve raised his head after he put the last dish of breakfast on the table, sending Tony an amused look which got him a wide grin from the said man as he put Peter in his chair before sitting on his. "What kind of present will I get oh, fair… lord of the house…" Tony said after he nearly slipped up and said mate and Steve's lips twitched up, deciding to forgive Tony for his near slip.
Finally, after a long time of trying; Steve finally managed to open his eyes, it took him a few tries, but he finally managed to clear his vision of the dark spots that dominate it. When everything finally became clear, Steve looked around the room, gazing at the familiar/unfamiliar place he was in, it took him a few moments to realize what was going on and why this place was strange as hell; he can see colors!
"Where is he?" Betty asked as her eyes fell on him, nearly pushing herself inside the house, looking around the place probably hoping that she was going to see Harley around. Tony only took a deep breath trying to calm down before he closed the door, following Betty who went to the living room, saying hello to both Steve and Peter while still looking around.
"What do you think about this? It's neat and pretty, not like the fancy ones from before." Tony showed Steve the invitation he was talking about, getting hum from Steve and a kiss on the neck, making Tony sigh in happiness at the attention he was getting from Steve.
"We will beat him, mother, I know we will; Asgard shall not fall." Thor promised, his words strong and true, for even if the God of thunder was the last one left standing, he will do whatever it takes to protect the Ancient One from Thanos' clutches, whatever it takes. After all the Ancient One (Call me Steve) was his friend.
But Steven only blinks his eyes and walked to the door, ignoring that he was only wearing his pajama's pants, he needed to get out of here, before he reached his door his eyes feel on Thor, and he could only sigh. "Get ready, we are leaving to Asgard today at nine." Steven could only say that before he left the team ignoring their concern question and calls.
"Oh, it's you, the insane newcomer who lives in the Rogers' property..." The man said dryly, taking Tony in with a raised eyebrow before a smug smile takes over his face which made Tony uncomfortable, especially when he leered at him with a look that made the hair on the back of Tony's neck stand on its ends. "Tell me what is it like, living in the Rogers' hunted house? Did you meet the monster living in the lake? Did you do something that will bring forth its anger? Personally, I don't believe it exists, but you know, it's known that 'it' refuses for anyone to live in the house near the lake that 'it' will kill if it meant to get people out its land… tell me, did you let it fuck you so you will stay in its house without it attacking you? I can give it to you if you want." The man grins as he said those words his eyes shining as he gazed at Tony, which made Tony try and suppress his shaking and disgust, which increased when he saw the hunger in the man's eyes.
Tony couldn't help but choke on a hysterical laugh that wanted to leave him as he realized how severe the situation was… was this why Clint came with a gun and shooed Carter away? A gun… a gun, Tony doesn't have because he doesn't believe in violence and doesn't want his kids to get familiar with the lives-stealing weapons… if only Tony had a gun now, at least he wouldn't be shaking in the corner of the closet like a helpless child hiding from the monsters under his bed. Hell! If only J.A.R.V.I.S. was on, then the police would have arrived and arrest Carter a long time ago.
"I never used the stones, Loki." Steven ended up saying a confused look taking over his face at the prince's words, he had never used the stones, the only time he came in touch with them was when he picked them up from their timeline and later returning them to the same timeline, the only one who used them was Bruce who use the stones to return half of the universe that Thanos snapped, and Carol who used them to get rid of Thanos and his army, and let's not forget the cause of their problem, Thanos.
That's all of the important ages you need to know right now, I will add what I see important as the story progress.
Reaching his boy, Tony sat on the floor beside him before pulling Peter in his lap and holding him tightly. Tony then kissed the back of his baby's head and shushing his son when Peter starts sniffling. "Are you going to tell me what's wrong, now?" Tony asked a few minutes later, kissing Peter's head once more, ignoring how his boy wiped his nose using Tony's shirt.
Steve can't calm down, and he won't, especially when he was called when he was with Fury in a meeting, only to be informed that his husband was in the hospital; the reason for that? Peggy fucking Carter! How did that woman even come here? She knew damn well not to come near Steve or Peter at all, what did she do? She came into his home when he wasn't there and did something that ended with his husband being thrown in the hospital.
"Don't you think that it is a little too early to build a treehouse for a baby?" Maria asked cooing when her eyes fell on Morgan who scrunched her nose and returned back to sleep, unaware of what's going on around her.
Bucky said through gritted teeth, it made Tony's heart stop in his chest because Steve wasn't dead, because why will he send him that letter years ago with the same elegant handwriting of his? He wanted to scream at Barnes that Steve was the one who left him, that was the one who sent him a letter two months later, that Steve was the one who turned him into this… this man who had everything and nothing.
And he could only gaze at Midgard with amazement in his eyes; the realm was beautiful… its forests, rivers, mountains, people, the things they created, and he strained his ears to hear about some of their knowledge, it was breathtaking and he couldn't stop gazing at it, it was then that he saw him! The most beautiful being his eyes ever fell on.
"But… but how can our relationship be healthy if there isn't any sexual… things." Tony said nervously which made Steven sigh at that and start massaging his forehead.
It's not like Steve didn't try and do something, trying to stay an extra hour every day in the hope of him being able to stay awake in the morning. It did nothing really, other than making him crankier when he woke up; which was another something that Steve didn't need, it was enough that he has a headache because he has to sleep in the morning, he doesn't need another for trying to stay awake past his sleeping time.
How? Just how? It was a year since the last time someone saw Rogers anywhere, even in his own lake, a year since Rogers vanished in the storm he created, leaving Tony alone and pulling Stane's corpse with him inside the lake. Seeing Rogers after all this time… seeing the creature he became… was stunning. This was the first time that Tony managed to get a full glimpse at Rogers, and what he saw stunned him. Rogers almost looked like a normal human if you didn't count his pale… everything… a normal human being, a healthy human being. When Tony focused though, Tony wondered how he ever thought of Rogers as a human.
Tony Stark. "James! Get your fat ass out of the house this instead or so help me God I will roast you to death!" Winnie snarled loudly, which kinda made Tony jump in surprise and look at the woman like she had grown another head, it was the first time he saw her snap at someone that wasn't one of her children that loved to act like little shit sometimes.
"So you found them…" Bucky hummed behind him making Steve jump and nearly run out of the room if it wasn't for the strong arms taking hold of him from behind and refusing to let go. "You shouldn't have done that, baby doll… it's OK though, I know you did it out of concern…" Bucky murmured, tightening his hold on Steve when the Omega tried to wiggle out of his arms; the tight hold made Steve whimper in pain, especially when Bucky squeezed his arms tightly in threatening manners.
Walking around Tony smiled at the few people he encountered before finding the DIY section; the town's library wasn't that big, which mean that if Tony took too much time someone will take notice and Tony wouldn't be able to use the excuse of him getting lost. Looking around the place, Tony's breath picked up when he noticed a door labeled as the 'Archive' at the end of the hall, looking around and seeing no one Tony walked fast to the door, shushing his daughter as he reached the door throwing a few looks behind him to see if the road was clear.
"You know, all this planning makes me wanna run to the hills." Tony pouts and snuggles into Steve's embrace, gaining a chuckle from the huge man and a kiss on the back of his head. "Are you sure that the two of us can't elope together and end all of this torture?" Tony questioned with a bland tone, scrunching his nose at the different themed wedding invitations that were thrown all around the coffee table.
Anyway, weeks later since Hammer, and Tony finally resigned to his cruel (So cruel) fate; what is marriage anyway? It wasn't like Tony had anyone to love like that or have someone who loves him truly (Steve Rogers doesn't count!), he was pushing his thirties and soon will be in his forties. Not only that, Tony was sure it wouldn't be that bad to marry Steve, what could happen? Steve already destroyed his mansion, he already ruined his innocent mind with him doing strange magic and dark voodoo, Steve already made him go into a cemetery for God's sake! And well, it wasn't like Steve was after his money or fame or anything, from what he knows (And everyone else for that matter) the Addams family are rich (And the main family, which include Steve, even more)… filthy rich if the rumors were true, so rich that they have underground secret rooms all around the world full of gold, silver, and precious rocks (Well that's what Tony heard, and he doesn't even want to ask Steve if it was true) but the Addams family have been around for centuries; people say that they were around since the sixth century, enjoying their life of riches and torturing people for fun. Tony was sure that their wealth came from those they torture (If Steve would have accepted Tony's wealth in exchange for leaving him, Tony would have given it a long time ago, but it was Steve, and he was anything but a quitter)
The blood drained from Tony and Steve's face when another loud crash and a scream from downstairs caused Morgan to wake up and start crying loudly, an action that made everyone go silent, even the people downstairs. "Oh God, oh God, oh God…" Tony choked, tears running down his face as realization of what was happening and the truth behind it was finally sinking in, as he tried desperately to shush Morgan before something bad happens…
Steve had to smile when he was done, with cleaning, his smile widen even more at the thought of making a good first impression, maybe Tony's brother wouldn't be like Howard and Maria with their 'Higher-than-thou' attitude and ruin Steve's good mood (And hopes) though he was sure that the man is going to be great, after all, Tony wouldn't praise his little brother if he wasn't a good man.
Dr. Cho paused as she saw the glare on the teen's face when his eyes fell on his tummy, she contain her dishearten sigh at that, of course, a teenager coming to the Omega clinic, unplanned pregnancy, and it would end with abortion, he probably doesn't even have an Alpha.
"It was Peter's birthday…" Steve murmurs, which made Tony, blink. "My ex-mate went into labor so I took her to the hospital… I was there only an hour before May called me… she was hysterical, she was crying and screaming, I couldn't understand anything from her words, just that someone broke in and stole something… something important… I remember hearing the baby wailing in the background, and it was so different… like he was choking, or he was having one of his asthma attacks, I still wonder to this day why May didn't rush toward the baby… then… then I heard the sound of a car's screeching, followed by screams when I arrived at the scene, the police told me that Ben and the baby died, but May… May was still alive, but she hit her head so hard they don't know how severe the head injury was until they check it in the hospital… sometimes, I still wonder what was so important they allowed this to happen?" Steve whispered, already feeling Tony shaking in his arms, so he did the only thing he could do and hugged the Omega tightly…
It didn't mean that Steve and Tony never left their bed since arriving here, that would have been disgusted with the ruined sheets and the smell; no. Some days Steve and Tony liked to spent their time in the vast property of the Carbonell villa, going to swim in the pool or enjoying a walk in the gardens, sometimes even daring to venter into the grape vineyard in the back of the villa. Most of their time in this villa was magical, and both Tony and Steve promised that the next time they were going to come here, Peter was coming with them; both of them couldn't get the idea of Peter running around this place laughing out of their minds, and secretly, Tony couldn't help the thought of small pair of feet chasing the Peter around.
"I see… so this is their leader, right?" Tony asked, tapping his ax near the man's neck which made the poor shmuck flinch and try to back away only to have Steve step on his back to still him. at Steve's nod, Tony only grin, his grin was predatory and full of teeth which only succeeded in making the man pale like a corpse. "Thank you, sweetheart, I started to get bored after we finished that bitch off, this toy would surely entertain me until we reach home," Tony said, giving Steve a loving kiss on the lips before turning his eyes toward the man who was squirming and trying to run away. "Get ready bitch, because when I am done with you, you will rot in the bottom of the ocean." Tony hissed, a grin taking over his lips as he raised his ax, chasing the idiot who thought it would be a great idea to miss with him.
Anton blinked his eyes, biting the inside of his cheek to stop himself from laughing or cursing he doesn't know; but a word from a child who never met Tyber was going to be taken as a word with some truth to it, for children were often blessed by Goddess Frigga with the knowledge of many hidden things. Now Anton was left with the problem of what he will do when the queen gets here, it's not a secret that a fight will break out as soon as the queen sees Tyber standing here. People around them start whispering, and Anton could only lean back and take Tyber in whose skin turned pale when his sister hissed his way under her breath, gazing frantically around the place, probably thinking about a few words to enchant the crowd and make them forget what happened.
"I… I don't know." Steve decided to answer honestly, not knowing any other answer to the question but the one he gave, because in truth, no, Steve was not OK, he was not OK ever since Tony starts pulling away from him. "What happened to your eye?" Steve finally dared to ask, wanting to know what happened to Bucky to turn him into a part raccoon, wondering if Bucky even had it in him to fight someone.
The adults chatted for a bit while Peter engaged in the game of twenty questions with Jarvis, chatting the AI's circuits off, but the Jarvis didn't seems to mind as he answered Peter's questions and even asked a few of his own. Dinner was a lovely affair; Steve spent it praising Tony for his amazing cooking, which made the Omega flush at that and tried to hide his flustered face with his juice cup.
After him presenting as an Omega, a lot of things changed, his parents were the one who changed the most… his mother start paying him attention, as much as she can when she wasn't busy with her higher class friends, she started taking him out to shopping trips (Yuck!) she also start teaching him how a proper Omega should act (Yeah, right, like he will do that) and the most disgusting thing, she started pushing him 'gently' to choose a Good-Rich-Powerful Alpha… he storms out most of the time after that… his father, on the other hand, changed too, Tony didn't know what to do with the truth he learned after the heart to heart with his father… but Tony thinks the two of them may stand on common ground in the end. Apparently, his father's disdain of him was all an act! The story goes like this, he was young, he got kidnapped, and they found him after a month nearly kissing death's feet, his father starts acting coldly toward him in hope of protecting him by showing other people that he doesn't care about his son, and he succeeded, that lead to a huge shouting match between them… well, more of Tony screaming and shouting and maybe throw something or two at his father and his father taking everything with guilt in his eyes. After Aunt Peggy confirmed what his father said, and to his shock, she was the one who helped him with that idiotic plan… Tony didn't know what to do, so he locks himself in his lab for three days… in the end, after lots and lots of pleas and promises from his family, he decided to give them another chance… and he was thankful he did that, even though he will never tell any soul about that to his dying day. Aunt Peggy took it on herself to teach him advance self-defense, the defense that only spies know about, it was awesome! Jarvis starts teaching him how to cook and take care of the house… which was not awesome, but he loves Jarvis too much to say anything.

That day ends up with Tony having shrapnel in his chest, and for that Bucky Barnes to lose his arm trying to protect him, surprisingly the terrorist took Bucky with him instead of shooting him and leaving him for death, probably thinking that they have a bargaining chip because the found Bucky on top of him protecting him.
Fury could only blink his one good eye, before letting out a sigh, grumbling to him as he leaned on his chair and cross his arms over his chest. "I thought you would have already gone to Carter and Barnes to get this information, they knew about Steve more than anyone else in the town." Fury stated, irritation coloring his tone, making Tony twitch and glare at the man.
/Warning/: This Chapter contains… maybe cursing, fluffiest fluff, maybe a little sadness, Peter is cutest, and Steve being protective AF, and finally, things are looking up! And who knows what? All reviews are appreciated.
"Brother!" Thor cried out as he stood from his chair fast, sending his chair flying to the floor as he gazed at his 'Brother' with shocked eyes full of tears. "You are alive!" Thor took a shaky step toward his brother, and Tony stood up fast and hides Peter behind him, pushing him until Peter was hiding behind Bucky and Peggy.
"Hey! What are you doing here, Tony?" The voice behind the Omega made him turn around and relax a little when he saw that it was Carol, which meant that the Omega has a high chance in finding Steve, now that the Beta was here. The woman skipped to him with a big smile on her face, but Tony was able to detect the nervousness hiding behind her cheerful mask, which made whatever hope he was feeling inside him dash.
"Hello, who is this?" Steve answered the phone when it rang, wondering who was calling in the middle of the night; today was an eventful day, a day was full of hard work and moving (Tony and Bucky) and preparing the baby's room (Also Tony and Bucky because they refuse for Steve to raise a finger) a day that Steve and Tony finally agreed on their baby's name (Mainly Steve, who told Tony that he love the name Morgan and want their daughter to have that name) so yes, today was an eventful day and Steve just wanted to go back to sleep.
Steve took the position of the vice-commander of Shield, Maria had long since retired after getting pregnant thirty years ago, she and Coulson live in a country house now, where Coulson could finally try his skill at fishing and where Maria could finally play her cello in peace.
Tony gazed around the gala, putting a smile on his face as he talked with whatever-her-name-was, trying not to grimace when the woman gave a loud laugh as she touched his arm, fluttering her lash as she looked at him with an expecting look, it was embarrassing, especially when he was already with a date, a date that hasn't yet arrived but still.
"No answer? Is that it? Are you going to pretend that you are not here, Mr. Stark? Well then, that suits me just fine…" Carter stated and Tony had to hold into his screams when he heard a few gunshots from the other side of the door. The gunshot wasn't that loud to warrant someone outside the house to come and investigate the noise, especially not with a suppressor, but to Tony, they were so loud that part of him wondered how his heart continued to beat without it failing him.
"Peter Benjamin Rogers, didn't I tell you not to run away when we are in strange places?" Tony heard the Alpha behind him scolding the whining pup which made him take a deep breath and turn to the Alpha who was crossing his huge arms over his chest, well everything in the Alpha was huge, but who was Tony to talk when he was five feet eight? Everything looked huge to him! Which was something he will never admit even in his grave. "I am sorry for what he did Mr. Stark, as soon as he saw you he ran toward you before I could stop him." The Alpha said which snapped Tony out of his daze and made him shake his head a little.
Tony's head spin, he felt like he was going to faint any minute now, he knows that he will end up fainting any minute now, it was just a matter of time. Tears were trickling down his face and Tony didn't have it in him to wipe them away; he could only think of Bruce's words, his mate was dying, that was left unsaid. His mate was dying, leaving him and Peter alone; Peter who may die of his sickness a year from now because his body was weak as it is, and two years had passed without the chemo doing a thing to help. If that happened; if Steve and Peter really died, then Tony will be all alone, he will be all alone, he just got his family back not three months ago, and they are going to leave him, they are going to leave him!
The second knock was harder than the first, making Tony grumble, wondering what Angie brought with her that she started to knock on his door like crazy. "Just a second!" Tony called out letting out a tired sigh as he opened the door; the person waiting on the outside made Tony freeze, his breath locking itself in his lung as the horror of what he saw finally clicked in.
"Can you read this?" Steve asked Tony, which made the Omega blink and nod his head, Steve sigh and adjust the Omega's bed into a sitting position, he gave Tony the papers. Tony read and reread the papers with a shocked look on his face; he looked at Steve with a shocked look.
A soft voice shushed him, and a cold finger wiped his tears, Tony could only close his eyes when he heard the gentleness in the gruff voice that ordered him to '
By the time he woke up, Steven knew he was shaken, he knew he won't get any sleep anymore, and he knew that this hunted image will be with him for the rest of his life, waking up, Steven turn his face to Peggy who was beside his bed trying to wake him up, and the blond man desperately hope that he didn't hurt the brunette, it had been years since Steven had nightmares this intense, years since he felt this drained, Steven sat on his bed and stood on his shaky legs leaving his bed, and from the corner of his eye, he saw all of the Avengers standing outside of his room, not knowing if they should enter the room or not, and Steven felt a little guilty for waking them up in the crack ass of dawn.
"Didn't I tell sweetheart?" Bucky murmured into Steve's neck causing Steve to gasp in shock when the Alpha starts kissing his neck and scent glands, making Steve feel uncomfortable and disgusted. "I want you, since the first time I saw you, I knew you were mine; my mate, my everything…" Bucky whispered, causing Steve's eyes to widen in shock and for terror to size him at the realization… all this time Steve wondered how Johann Schmitt manages to copy Bucky's voice to try and lure him out… he should have known, he should have realized that it was Bucky from the start.
"You can't be too sure Winnie; I thought you will stop your stupid matchmaking after graduating college." Sarah said which got a snort from her friend, and a soft glare from the other Alpha, but Sarah didn't notice that as she watched in shock as Peter called out to Tony to save him from his father's tickling assault, it was strange how the pup attached himself to a stranger he didn't know about, and an Omega stranger at that.
?!' made Tony look at the ceiling before turning to his friends, Natasha already standing up looking at Tony like he lost his mind and turned into a full Addams. "I was there to witness S.H.I.E.L.D.'s downfall at the hand of the Winter Soldier and Serpentine not an hour ago just wanted to inform you that tomorrow's picnic with S.H.I.E.L.D. is canceled and all, so bye," Tony stated as he turned around, already preparing to take a long deep bubble bath before sleeping for the next 24 hours, he was done… Tony was done!
"Even better, he makes me sing all night long; a fate that you never seem to manage especially after being wasted from the first time." Tony sneered, taking twisted pleasure in the anger that shined in Ty's eyes, Tony felt empowered, knowing that he was able to insult Ty without the man doing a thing unless he wanted a scandal to follow him after leaving SI. "Now if you excuse me, my fiancé is waiting for me." The shock in Ty's face, made Tony bear his teeth in a feral grin before turning around, marching to where Steve was scowling and glaring at the women who didn't seem to get the meaning of the word 'No' no matter how Steve kept repeating it. "Darling, here you are, what took you long?" Tony cooed after reaching Steve, hugging Steve's left arm, causing Steve to blink his eyes before giving Tony a smile full of adoration.
In the end, Anthony had to carry the Omega inside, and he winced as he was told later that the Omega had a broken shoulder and mild concussion, Anthony had felt so guilty, he made sure to pay for the Omega's treatment, that was the last thing he could do being the one who sent the Omega here, thought the Omega told him not to sweat it, that it was his fault for running and paying attention, even when his father continued to call him that day, Anthony didn't have the heart to leave the Omega alone, so he stayed with him the whole day, talking with the Omega and making him laugh here and there, he even got the Omega's number and was shocked that the kid was eighteen when he told him.
So after answering a few more questions, it seems that the fates decided to take pity on him because not a second later, the wall was exploded which made people scream and rush out of harm ways, and Steven gave a silent thanks to God, stood up and rushed with the rest of the Avengers who were sitting in different places inside of the conference hall in Stark's tower. "Who is going to pay for all that shit?!" Steven could hear Tony's screeching which made him snigger a little at that and turn his head to whoever decided to crush the party and saved him from more questioning… the person on the other side made him blink at that and raise his brow.
Steve couldn't help the tears from falling this time, he can already feel himself slipping away from the living world; Steve, Steve was grateful that at least Tony was the last thing that he was going to see before leaving this world. "Tony… I… I am sorry…" Steve gave a wobbling smile, how funny it was, how funny it was that Steve pinned for centuries upon centuries, wishing to finally to be with Tony, his Anton… and just when Steve finally had the chance to be with the love of his life, it was snatched from him without his consent… it wasn't fair.
Pepper took a sip from her coffee with evident satisfaction, before choosing her words carefully. "You got someone looking out for you…" She said her words slowly, causing Tony to nod his head. "I'm guessing more than the one if you'd let them." Pepper hummed to herself as she turned her coffee cup in its saucer thoughtfully.
Steven left it at that which made everyone quiet down and look at the queen, the happy mood they felt vanish in a blink of an eye as they looked at the queen who refused to look at anyone.
... Steve knew that no star dared to do what Steve was doing; shining brightly enough to burn everything in their path and increase the chance of his magic and core getting destroyed and dying in the process, a path Steve shouldn't have crossed until millions of years later.
Everything was quiet, no sound was heard other than Morgan's squeals and giggles and blabbers as she tried to wiggle free and run to the creature's arms, an action that caused Tony's heart to pound in his chest, as fear took hold of him. It was only when Rogers managed to get on his legs and stand up that Tony managed to unfreeze himself, stumbling back as he tried to put as much distance between Rogers and Morgan.
"Why… why are you doing this?" Steve choked out, flinching when Bucky shoved his face into Steve's neck, causing Steve's heart to skip several beats, as fear took hold of him. Bucky only let out a hum, nuzzling Steve's neck and shoulder scenting him and ignoring Steve's protests as he tried to wiggle out of the Alpha's tight hold.
Anyways! A little bit of information on the timeline of this story to help anyone if they got confused; like me when I wrote this chapter.
Taking a deep breath Tony sends a text to Steve, marching toward Harley to check the boy over. Other than being thin and some food surrounding Harley's mouth which Tony wiped away, the boy seemed OK, just tired. Not being able to help himself Tony ran his hand through Harley's hair, which gained him a purr from the sleeping boy causing a soft smile to cross over Tony's face as he leaned down to pick the sleeping child in his arms, frowning at how light he was…
that letch on him? Tony made his mind, as soon as the obstetrician tells him that he was pregnant, Tony was going straight away to abort it.
The sound of a childish giggle made Bruce tense, a shiver ran down his body as he turns around to see Steve standing behind him with a knife, a bloody grin taking over the Addams' face as he took in Bruce like he was planning to kill him here and now. Oh God, he was going to die! "I wanna make a deal with you!" Bruce squeak, nearly having a heart attack when Steve took a step toward him.
The rest of the day was a blur, but Tony was sure that most of the town knew about his baby girl, Angie gave him free food that will last him a month, Clint and Natasha bickered about what to give to his baby girl as a present until they settled on teaching her karate and archery when she is born, Peggy hugged him tightly, while Bucky ruffled his hair, Pepper and Rhodey refused to leave him alone, it was fun, and Tony can say that he was truly happy that day.
Harley didn't know what he did when he ran to search for Mr. Clint, all he knew was that his asthma was kicking in when he found the other Omega, pointing to him about Mr. Tony being in trouble. It was when Harley noticed Mr. Clint taking a gun that his breath left him completely and he was left gasping as he tried to follow Mr. Clint, hoping desperately that the strange woman wasn't a criminal who would hurt Mr. Tony badly. It was Harley's fault; he shouldn't have left Mr. Tony's side he should have stayed beside him. Standing near the front door, Harley's hand went to his jacket's pocket, getting out his inhaler and taking a deep breath, trying to calm down before something bad happened and he passed out.
Anton paled when he realized that he turned to the naked Omega, once more, which meant that the Omega will not let him live it down this time, that Anton turned to face him on purpose. Thankfully, the Omega was already dressed by the time, which left Anton baffled at how fast the queen was; Anton was sure that he just heard the Omega get out of the lake, how did he dress up this fast? The amused and mocking smile the Omega was donning made Anton's lips twitched down as he finally realized he was played by the said Omega. "You are a hazard, you know that?" Anton complained which only made the Omega's smile widen even more at that as if he was pleased with himself that he got under the Alpha's skin.
Suddenly there was a loud sound of thunder and a loud thumb behind him causing Steven to turn his head to see who was the creature who dared to make such loud sounds, and his eyes widen when he saw Thor son of Odin, which may as well have been his only way out of here, hopefully, the man was not a fool. "Brother Stark, did you see what caused this great crater?" The man shouted in a frantic voice which made everyone turned their head to the armored man.
"Doom…" Steven asked already feeling the disappointment swelling inside of him, and here he thought that Hydra finally decided to reveal themselves, but who was Steven kidding, he knows that Pierce is too careful about going out public without project 'Insight' being complete, which won't be considering that Peggy was in on their plans now, though he can feel the confusion on the Avengers' faces at that name, guess that this was the first time that Doom attacked them then.
Tony could only let a shuddered breath as his eyes took in the lake that seemed more ominous than it was weeks ago; part of Tony was still in disbelieve, it was still trying to live in ignorance, ignoring all the evidence that fell upon him in the last few days, another part of Tony, the part that wanted to run away was shivering in fear, wondering what misfortune was waiting for him when he was going to leave the town.
"So… I have surprising news… and unexpected news…" Tony said while he fidgets a little which made Steve pause when he raised his teacup and turn to the Alpha, putting the cup down in a show that informed Tony to continue, making Tony clear his throat. "So the surprise is that I talked with James an hour ago, and he told me that he is coming today, probably at noon…" Tony said while looking at Steve with nervousness and the Omega was so grateful that he put his teacup down or he would have ended up choking on the tea, but then Tony's face turned guilty and Steve had to close his eyes waiting for the 'Unexpected' news. "You see, Howard is coming to the office today with a very important business partner… I may not be able to come home until eight… probably ten…" Tony mumbled his words making the Omega groan at that and start massaging his forehead.
"What do you think, Tony?" Peggy's gentle voice made Tony snap out of it as he looked at the Alpha that was standing a little bit farther away from the Omega in the hope of not scaring him, Tony blink at that and turn himself in circles, taking in the changes once more.
Looking around, Tony nearly let out a triumph shout when he arrives at the sixties section. As fast as he can, Tony dropped the baby bag and rushed to the box labeled as 1965, shushing his baby when Morgan let out a whine. Just the murder cases, Tony just needed to search the murder cases. Tony's breath hitched as he rushed through the boxes that labeled 1965, 1966, and 1967 without finding anything useful; reaching the box labeled 1968 Tony was sweating like someone just drenched him with water, his heart rate increased and his paranoia went through the roof; how long since Maria and him splits ways? Did she come to search for him?
"After you princess…" The king mocked Steven as he drags him and pushes him toward the bridge connecting the ship to the port, which nearly made him stumble and fall in the water, that caused the blond to give the king a harsh look while throwing a curse or two at the man, which only got him a smirk and raised eyebrow from the said man, but Steven didn't care, he held his head high and tightened his grip on his child as he walked on the bridge to board the ship, ignoring the man behind him as best as he can, especially when the man starts commenting to Steven to move fast.
4-As you read, Norse's laws about prostitution and rape are as accurate; those who were convicted of these crimes were labeled as outlawed (fredløs), kicked out of the village, and are forbidden of getting any help, they could be killed without their killer being punished because it wasn't a crime to kill outlawed. The first person who passed the law that forbade prostitution and rape, is Harald Fairhair followed by The Oseberg Queen.
It was four weeks later after the day in the hospital that Steve finally decided to give Tony a real chance, and the Alpha really couldn't fault him, after all, his Omega spent the last eleven years of his life thinking that Tony left him and their child and that he was nothing but a toy the Alpha played with until he got tired, something that always made Tony curse Howard to hell and back, so Steve obviously has big trust issues that considered Tony, something the Alpha needs to do something about.
/Warning/: This Chapter contains, cursing, sadness, fluff, a little bit of violence, ghosts, horror elements, poor Tony! All reviews are appreciated...
"That is impossible; no bear lives in this nick of the woods," Nicolaus said, gazing around the place as if trying to confirm his words, the Alpha's eyes fell on something before it darkened and his sight returned to Nattalegg once more. "How many?" Nicolaus asked, and Steven doesn't need to be smart to hear the complete question; how many hunters died? A bear attack would likely result in many deaths before the rest of the hunters get the chance to kill the animal.
Sarah's eyes widen a little as she listens to his words giving him a soft sad smile, she looked at the counter for a second before turning to him. "I now know why Steve is head over heels in love with you… I wish you were the one he met twelve years ago, maybe then the three of you wouldn't have suffered as much as you did, but I'm happy you met in the end, you all were the key in healing each other." Sarah smiled; taking the dessert plates from the counter and getting out of the kitchen heading to the backyard leaving Tony shocked at her words.
"Right… hey, is there a loony bin around here? I am sure those nice people you ran away from are worried about you, what do you think, star and strips?" The creature asked, and Steven out to ask it about its name, after all, he can't call it creature, it was really tiring to do that, and it gets bored after a while, even if Steven called him a crazy bitch every time the two of them talked, the word 'Bitch' seemed to egg that thing on even more, so maybe he was a female that has a male body? Odin's beard, this was hopeless…
"Listen here, you home-wrecking bitch!" As soon as Harley reached Clint's house, Peggy started to shout, causing Tony to suppress a sigh as the woman finally decided to show her true colors. "Who do you think you are to prevent me from seeing my husband and child?! You are nothing but a homewrecker who dares to come between me and my husband! How dare you tell me what to do?!" Peggy started to scream in Tony's face, walking until she trapped him between her and the door, causing an irrational speaks of panic to take over Tony before he harshly shoved it down and pushed the other Omega away from him.
Hearing his mother's voice made Steve give a big smile, it had been so long since he last talked with his mother; ever since she died from TB when he was sixteen, looking as beautiful as a bride on her wedding night, in her black clothes and black coffin. Steve made sure to talk with his mother every day via crystal balls and Ouija boards, though it had been years since he last was able to talk with his mother. After he enlisted in the army, she stopped hunting him which was a shame. For he loved it when she used to scare Bucky every day or that one time when she gave George Barnes a heart attack for daring to raise his hand on Winnie. He really missed his mother. "Hi, Ma, it's me." Steve heard his mother coo, making Steve all warm on the inside, a feeling that he never felt in a long time now.
"Tony Stark." Steve answered getting a hum from his mother informing him that she was waiting for him to continue with his tale, and Steve was grateful that his Ma didn't make a big deal out of him loving a normal. "And… he hates me for being an Addams." Steve finally confessed, causing his mother to let out a sigh.
That day Steve spent all of his time in his studio, planning on finishing the last of his commissions; they are going to be his last until the baby is born. In just five months, Steve is going to have his baby in his arms! Just this thought alone gave Steve the energy to finish everything that needed to be done.
They were going into the van when Steve heard it, that melodic voice screaming in his ear… it made Steve lost his footing and trip to fall on his knees, Steve could hear Natasha and Clint's screaming behind him, and when he turned around to calm them down… he saw a bolt lodged in the wall behind him, it would have pierced his forehead if he didn't trip. Steve raised his head to look at the roof the bolt came from only to see a shadowy figure… Steve starts chasing him after that…
"Edith, please call me by my name," Steve said which made everyone turn toward eyeing the man in confusion but Steve didn't answer their silent question he was just looking tiredly at his hands, ignoring Peggy's concern and knowing look, she always seemed to catch on everything faster than a human being.
"So you are leaving…" A voice spoke from behind causing Steve to flinch and turn around, only relaxing when he saw Bucky standing behind him, a frown on his face as his arms were crossed over his chest, making Steve shift in his place, feeling guilty like he has done something naughty he shouldn't do, which was irrational considering that Steve was an adult and he can do whatever he wants.
"What… happened?" Tony finally dared to ask, afraid to know what the answer was, but needing it in case Rogers was under someone's control, Steve shuffled in his place before giving a happy smile, but Tony wasn't fooled, he was used to reading the subtle movement, and he can sense that Rogers was far more uncomfortable than he showed on.
"So you are staying?" The woman asked getting a nod from Tony, making the woman hum at that and look at her phone. "My husband is coming to help you tomorrow, with the repairs and moving things… you shouldn't lift heavy objects while being pregnant." The woman said sending a pointed look toward the young man, making the teen flush at that and nods his head a little at that.
For everyone angry at me at the way Tony treated Sarah, don't, everyone should realize that what Peggy did to the Rogers family, had an everlasting effect that everyone still struggling with, Sarah was just good at hiding how it affected her, but hopefully Tony opened her eyes a little bit.
"Mr. Stark!" Peter squeal as he rushed to hug Tony's legs, making the Omega laugh a little at that and lower himself to hug the pup, which got him a purr from the little one as he tried to snuggle into his neck, making the Omega coos at that, though the pup let go of him with a flushed face when Steve cleared his throat and looked at the pup with a pointed look.
"I box." The Alpha ended up saying as he took another sandbag and went to hand it on the hook after taking the broken chain. "Hitting the bag and ignoring my thoughts, trying to stop thinking and just hitting. It's better with a partner though, really made you focus on avoiding the 'enemy' more than punching a still bag." Steve said looking at Tony with a knowing smile. "Just like getting lost while inventing." That made Tony takes a deep breath and look at the punching bag.
"Why… why are you telling me this?" Tony asked, going over the last bit of information that Angie offered, in the articles he read, all of them hailed Steven Rogers as the hero he was for exposing Pierce; in all of the articles he read, not once did he read about Pierce being out of prison during Rogers's death… could it be… could it be that Rogers turned into a monster to seek revenge? To seek the truth of why the town betrayed him and cause his death?
"Why would I tell you something like this? So you can tell Stane who will end up proposing to do such a selfless act of mating me to protect my virtues… I prefer to die." Growled Tony as he took the book from the coffee table and return it with the other books in the box.
Just then, when Steve was going to lean and whisper something in his ear, the sky burst open and Tony raised his eyebrow when he saw the same flying whales that informed him the Chitauri were here. "Well, why don't you look at that,
The woman can see Steve blinking his eyes like he doesn't even know what to say, but he put his cup down and looked a little uncomfortable before turning to the woman. "I… I think you got the wrong person Captain Carter, you see Dr. Erskine and me… we aren't actually related at all…" Steve said which made the woman open and close her mouth at that not knowing what to say, narrowing her eyes a little at that, but Steve didn't seem to notice that as he looked at her with sadness. "I… I really hate to be the one who informs you of this… but Dr. Erskine… he died ten years ago… I don't know, how, his lawyer Mr. Philips never told me... I am really sorry for your loss Ma'am… Dr. Erskine was a great man." Steve said with a sad smile, making the woman take a deep breath at the words she heard, closing her eyes for a few seconds before opening them.
"Not at all, it was a pleasure talking with the little superhero here." Tony said which get a huge smile from the kid who looked at the woman with a proud look. "So you never told me your name or is it that you loved being called Iron Man?" Tony said which made the pup smile happily at being called Iron Man.
The next morning did nothing to ease Tony's nerves, nor the night before that when he couldn't even sleep well at all, but Tony was grateful that today was his day off, which meant that he will have the house to himself to think. Kissing Steve and Peter on the cheek while bedding them goodbye as they went to work and school felt somehow like it was the last time he will do it, which made Tony's heart hurt unbearably.
Tony knew that it was unreasonable of him, to push everyone and refuse them to get closer, even after a year passed since the truth was known; the thing was though, the betrayal still course down his veins, still, weight him down. The lies still whisper in his ears, and the dark warning Stane gave him to freeze his heart in fear; Tony wants his child to live, he wanted his child to be free and happy and live her life without the fear of death if she did something wrong.
"Did the king force you?" suddenly Margaret pulled away, heat and rage burning in her eyes as she gazed at Steven. "It was that barbaric king, he forced himself on you did he not? He got you… he… and then… I will kill him!" Margaret hissed darkly, looking a minute away from going through what she stated; only getting a sigh from Steven who gazed away.
"Warm…" The pup said making Steve hum at that and kiss his head gently, covering the pup with the blanket which made the pup purr happily at the warmth.
What Steve said to Tony was true… the only thing that Steve found stars good at was shining, and shining brightly Steve did… the brighter Steve shine the hotter his core becomes, and the hotter it became the unstable Steve felt…
"What is the catch?" The Omega asked, already knowing that the Alpha wouldn't have given him such a generous offer without wanting something in return, and Steven tensed a little, already knowing what the Alpha wanted, what
Finishing his house, Tony wanted to squeal and jump around when he saw the finished house, his heart was about to burst out of his chest any moment now because he can already imagine his future here! He can already imagine his baby playing around the place, jumping in the flower bed while laughing, he can already imagine them sitting on the swing that he asked Bucky to install on the porch.
A tick appeared on Steve's forehead and Steve nearly started a fight here and now, but he stopped himself least he did something stupid and Bucky return to beat up the Beta before dragging Steve away from the supermarket and give him an earful. "Believe it or not, Sir, I can handle everything just fine," Steve stated through gritted teeth, hoping that the man would leave him alone before Steve punch him, pregnant or not.
That made everyone pauses and turns to gaze at each other with shock and wondering look; Thor took a step forward, his eyes were wide. "Does that mean the stone controls you no more, Ancient One?" Thor asked in a small hopeful voice, causing Steve to blink his eyes open and gaze at Thor with a confused look.
Sam pressed his lips tightly, staying silent for a few seconds before clearing his throat. "I was going to visit you in a few days, wanting to invite you for dinner; my husband Riley, chewed me for not bringing him and the kids for your engagement party. It seems that Natasha gave you the green light so Riley is all excited to meet you." Sam gave a small smile; amusement was clear on his face.
"Because it's the only thing that will power this A.I., even the Arc-Reactor isn't strong enough to make an armor as powerful as any of the Infinity Stones," Tony explained, he didn't know what he hoped for, maybe he hoped for Steve understanding and offering to help him, but what Tony didn't count on is Steve's face becoming as pale as a corpse when he continued to take in the codes in front of him.
All in all, Tony was hopeful that when the time came, the Avengers will be prepared to not only protect their earth from Thanos but also protect Steve from the Mad Titan, who has a scary obsession with him. Even with that, it didn't stop Tony from doing what he can do to protect his friends and family; he will try his hardest to stop that scary vision he saw from happening, even if it meant his death.
"I would like to take some blood samples, Mr. Rogers, as imprinting goes both ways, even when you were unaware of it. The Omega and the pup are sleeping now, but you can go and see them if you want." The doctor said, making Steve nod his head, and follow the doctor when the older man waved for him to follow, he saw a nurse coming to talk to the rest of his friends.
Steven let out a sigh and follows the king, nearly raising his eyebrow at the way people flinch as they passed them, looking pale as they caught the sight of their king walking through the roads. Steven sympathizes with them, considering what he heard a week ago, but to be truthful, Steven doesn't care, not when they left him to fight alone and run with their lives or came to see Steven fight like it was entertainment.
He met Ho Yinsen the man was kind, made Tony a little guilty when he told him about their meeting in 1999, it was probably after Steve dumped him with the way Yinsen told him how he acts, the man patched him and Bucky good, one day the three of them were having dinner all three of them in silence until Bucky finally broke it by talking about his home, he talked about his family and his best friend Steve Rogers, hearing that name made Tony heart stutter in his chest.
Steve raised his head when the door opened, smiling gently when he saw that it was Tony who opened the door, as he was about to go search for him and Peter, having brought them a few gifts from the places he was to when Peggy sent him on his mission; the frown on Tony's face though made Steve concern, thinking that something had happened when he was away when he was about to question Tony he got the shock of his life when Tony blurred out. "Spent my heat with me!" Steve could only stare as the Omega flushed and red face.
"Do you think that Tony's success in killing Steve?" Maria pleaded with an anxious expression, peering at Howard who was as pale as a piece of paper, letting out a groan when the older man flinched when another shout broke from inside the room, she actually can't blame Howard, not after ten hours of labor and another hour of hearing Tony screaming bloody murder after his water broke.
All of the Avengers were trying their hardest to make it work one way or another; Peggy was using all of her political connections in hope of them managing to gather as many superheroes to help when the unthinkable will happen. Natasha, Bucky, and Clint were using their connection to gather as much information that will help; be it the whereabouts of a strong Mutant/Hero/Vigilante that will be willing to help, or information about a stray piece of alien's technology. Even Bruce was trying to help, which mainly consist of him calling people he 'Knew' when he was hiding away from S.H.I.E.L.D, and General Ross. Even Tony was working his ass, trying to update all of the Avengers gears and his suits, taking science by lapses to make the impossible possible, in hope of defeating the Mad Titan.
"I can't believe it! How… why… ugh! You and I will have a long chat when I am done here, I will make sure to kill both of you and Jarvis! Traitors who refuse to tell me anything until the last minute!" The Beta huffed as she tapped her leg, sending a harsh glare to Tony who hides behind Peter and Steve, which made the Omega send him a disbelieving look, though the giggle Peter let out, was worth it.
Steve let out a harsh exhale from his nose at the tone his mother used, scowling at the knife in his hands before stabbing the ground with it. "I really love him, tried to court him any way I can, only successes in getting the attention of his teammates, but never him, maybe I should follow Wednesday footsteps and give my heart to the devil, maybe then it won't hurt." Steve whispered tiredly, getting a sigh from his mother.
I had two Stony stories that I'm working on, one is a Christmas story that I may or may not update, and the other is a heartbreaking one, the two of them are Omegaverse, I was wondering if people are interested in the Christmas story or the other one so I will start writing them, and updating them when time is right.
