Toni saw no point in denying it; not when she knew Steve would know better. “This whole mission feels wrong, Stevie,” she said instead, raking a hand through her hair. It wasn’t the first time she’d said so, but not even her lover could convince her that she was overthinking things. “Even more so now that we know it’s a bust. Just… swear to me that you’re being careful. You and the rest of the team. I’d love to swoop in for the rescue, but you know how nervous Happy gets when he has to babysit.”
Peter’s lip wobbled, but he valiantly held back his tears. “He’s makin’ you food, he promised we could come give it to you but I ran on in front,” the little boy answered softly, hurt dimming his eyes. “Did you get an ouchie?” he asked, reaching for her still slightly bloody palms. She carefully closed her hands into fists, ignoring the pain, so that Peter didn’t have to see the incriminating evidence.
The genius winked and threw a kiss towards the nearest camera. “Hey, you’ll always be my first love, J,” she teased, the warmth of success making her light and happy. It had been something of a trial, this latest version of her greatest creation, and Toni had grappled with the coding and designs for close to a week until it had all come together in the early hours of this morning. In the time that she’d taken to go through her morning ritual with Peter and drop him off at school, the fabrication process had continued under the watchful supervision of her AI, and now she only had 23 minutes left to wait until she could start running tests on it.
He waited for her to notice him in the doorway, smiling softly at her when she did and taking her hand when she was close enough. Without a word, he led her back to their room, and as they entered, he turned her around, catching her around the waist and leaning down to press a deep kiss to her lips. He savoured the taste of her, the scent of her, the feel of her pressed into his arms, and for the life of him, Steve couldn’t figure out how she made him miss her for all of the eight hours they’d been apart.
“Some of your work has already been done for you. Tony asked me to give you his number.” Natasha pulled a business card seemingly out of nowhere.
Tony rolled his eyes. “That’s not actually how time travel works. Given that apparently time travel doesn’t defy the laws of physics – and I will definitely be taking a serious look at that later – coming back and changing things would create a branching reality. The other Steve’s future is already set because it’s already happened. That Steve and our – this Steve shared a timeline up until the point when they met, but now this Steve’s future is different. This Steve will never become that Steve because they’re no longer in the same time stream. He’ll become a different Steve. Depending on how big the change is, he may never travel back to the past at all.”
“Um, yes, sure thing. Thank you. Tony, you and I are going to have a discussion later that you will not enjoy, about things like threatening a terrorist on national television and not telling me about it.”
Steve was relieved. He’d had about enough of aliens for a while. “I’ll just watch both. It’s fine. Hey, Jim,” he said with a nod, receiving one in return. “Ma’am,” he said to Pepper, the palest of pink tinging his cheeks as he avoided eye contact with her. Tony narrowed his eyes and opened his mouth, probably to comment on the blush, but Steve cut him off. “Do either of you have any book or TV recommendations? I’m trying to catch up.”
To Steve’s relief, Tony laughed. “Yeah, she’s pretty good alright. She part of this group that calls themselves hacktivists. Hacker activists. She managed to get into SHIELD a couple of times. With no live connection. Someone that good, there’s not a lot you can’t get into when you have physical access. My read is that she’s pretty loyal to Coulson. According to the video feed I… borrowed, she calls him AC. Coulson’s got a great team – excellent science division, pretty killer field agents. It’ll be a bummer if they turn out to be Hydra.”
“I don’t need your permission to talk to my contractors, Captain. I think you’ll find that I don’t need your permission for much of anything.”
"Okay. I'll send you what we've got. Tony, do you think you could help me arrange transport of all my stuff? It would actually be great if you guys could keep an eye on it – and Darcy – while I'm dealing with… whatever this is."
"How sure are you of Fury? He is the one who told me STRIKE team was the best of the best at SHIELD." countered Steve.
JARVIS paused the playback. “Sir, which section of the recording would you like displayed? You deploying the Iron Man suit and leaping out of the window, Scott Lang riding along with the tesseract, or Captain Rogers riding in the elevator with the scepter?”
Both Steve and Rhodey gradually relaxed as they ate pizza and chatted. Tony seemed happier than Steve had ever seen him. As Steve watched Tony do his best to shove Rhodey off the couch and onto the floor after Rhodey told one too many stories of Tony getting into scrapes at MIT, he wondered if this was what he and Bucky had looked like from the outside. As he left, he turned to Tony. “So I think maybe you and I have more in common than I thought.” Tony didn’t say anything; he just raised one eyebrow in question. “We’ve both spent most of our lives with a best friend named James who is constantly pulling us out of one scrape after another.” His lips quirked up in a half-smile, and he realized that he’d smiled more in the last two days than he had in the months since he’d woken from the ice, and that was including an alien invasion. “I’ll see you tomorrow with the rest of the team. I’ll bring Clint and Natasha. Do you know how to get in touch with Dr. Banner and Thor?”
Tony, who seemed much more relaxed than yesterday, blew a raspberry at him. "Fine. Keep your secrets. So, the upshot is that we need to be a team, trust each other, so what, we have slumber parties? Paint each others' toenails?"
“You’re right. I got hit with a mystical glow stick and suddenly had no will of my own. I saw the files you pulled. Bucky got tortured for decades, got his mind wiped over and over again, and the notes say he still had to be told he was doing this for the greater good.”
Tony, as usual, seemed a little uncomfortable with a genuine compliment, but he managed to reign in his usual need to babble. Instead, he stood, clapped Steve on the shoulder, and went back to his work table. Steve cleared his throat again and searched for an easier topic of conversation. “So you think this Skye is pretty good with computers?”
Steve dropped entered the tower kitchen to find the other Avengers (minus Thor) already there. Tony stopped his pacing, and Clint and Natasha looked up from where their legs were tangled together on the couch. Bruce, making himself some tea, was the only one who didn’t freeze immediately.
“Maybe you should call his mother,” Bruce suggested. “You can get a feel for the family, see how close she was to her father and how close this Agent Triplett was to his grandfather. Maybe pay a visit that coincidentally overlaps with his.”
"Alright, but you take a comm unit with you. I want the data on intergalactic coverage anyway," said Tony with a smirk. Steve was beginning to notice that Tony tried to distract from his own kindness with quips and mocking.
Natasha laughed. “You’re not me, but you did okay. Mission accomplished, soldier. We learned a lot.”
Steve works on coming to grips with his realization, and in the meantime, goes on another undercover mission and finds out things he never wanted to know.
With Steve’s lying capabilities solidifying, they changed their priority to fleshing out his backstory. Red Skull had indeed convinced him of the need for Hydra, but he wanted a more ordered Hydra. Red Skull was greedy; you could rule without demanding it – Steve had found leadership natural since the serum, and people followed him willingly. He didn’t like how Fury had lied to him when he was defrosted. He wasn’t sure if Fury was Hydra or not, but he wasn’t about to dance to Fury’s tune without more information – he wanted to be the one pulling all the strings. Still, he recognized that he wasn’t as familiar with the current political landscape. He wanted to work with the true leaders of Hydra. Natasha told him that he should confide in Pierce that his senses were more enhanced than people thought. “Make him feel that you trust him with something you haven’t even mentioned to Fury.”
“I’d like for you to go to Tennessee and see if you can figure anything out about the explosion that happened there, if that’s alright with you. You can get there the fastest, except for Thor, and I think you’re better suited for investigation. I’m going to coordinate from here for now. Bruce, I’d like you to help with any… scientific… things,” Steve cracked a smile at Tony’s accompanying snort, “from here. I’d also like to keep Thor with us so we have a flier. You said Jim is working this from his end?”
Tony, on the other hand, grinned. “You ready for a tech tutorial without the training wheels, old man?” Steve nodded, still frowning at the phone. “You good for me to see the message you just got?” Steve nodded again, and Tony instantly made grabby hands at him. “Give it here, then. I’ll show you. Wait. Clint made you a
“You’re not half bad, Rogers,” she said with a little grin. “You got any flaws? I’d like to be able to present a balanced case to potential dates.”
“She was the most amazing woman I’d ever met. An absolute force of nature with no fear. The first woman to see me.”
“You guys caught that too, huh? I can’t figure it out. Zola is the only one that I recognized from the pictures, and he died decades ago.”
Future Steve entered the elevator and told them he was taking point on the scepter. Rumlow and Sitwell, who were clearly in charge of the group, both declined until Steve leaned over to Sitwell and whispered, “Hail Hydra.” Shock and pleasure crossed the faces of Rumlow and Sitwell as they handed the scepter over. Steve, on the other hand, remained straight-faced until he left the elevator with the scepter, at which point he smiled.
“Hmm,” Rhodes pretended to think, “I don’t know, maybe I just had this crazy urge to play tag with you in the middle of an aftershock? Or could it be, and this is just a wild guess here, that
Toni narrowed her eyes at him. “You might as well be, you big moron,” she shot back, and though Steve enjoyed the fire finally being back in her eyes, he couldn’t say he appreciated the fire being meant to burn him. “Especially if you’re expecting me to jump up and down and sing a song because you’re going to be; what? The star-spangled man with a plan?” She snorted derisively. “Get real, Steve, come on!”
For the first time, Rhodey realized that the suit’s hands were also missing. It hadn’t meant much to him at first, figuring that she’d simply scavenged the parts like the wiring out of the left leg of the armor, but if she’d kept them intact…
, to what they are now, with Howard,” Fury said, and if Toni didn’t know any better, she’d say that he actually sounded regretful. Compassionate, even. “If I’d known, I’d have left you and Rogers out of this.”
And when that didn’t work, Toni was always all too happy to let him mark her up with his teeth and tongue and make it very clear whose best gal she was.
True to her word, a doctor came to the house and examined his mother, and that was followed by a call to a lung specialist who Toni worked her magic on and flew out to the nearest hospital within the next two days itself. A battery of tests later had revealed early stages of lung cancer, and in the space of time wherein Rhodes, his mother and his uncle had grieved the news, Toni had arranged with the top surgeon in the country to perform the surgery to remove the tumors in his mother’s lungs and also began the process of arranging chemotherapy for after the surgery. She’d done some reading up after the initial diagnosis and after chatting with the doctors, found that the surgery combined with chemo would make the cancer less likely to return. After explaining all that to them, she went on to talk about scheduling the chemo, totally oblivious to the shell-shocked reaction she was inspiring from the Rhodes clan.
The armour shifted restlessly around her, panels sliding back into place with smooth motions that she might have been proud of, if she’d had any inclination to critique her work. As it were, Toni had a single purpose in mind, and there would be no distraction from it. She didn’t dare to think of his name, or even allow herself a moment to picture him, because it could only bring her fear.
Peter complied without a word of protest, snuggling even closer into her. Toni kept a hand over his head and maintained a constant slew of softly murmured assurances and comforts as she made quick work of getting out of the bunker and into the waiting Quinjet. She relaxed finally with the familiar surroundings, but even then, Peter didn’t lift his head or let her go.
Instead, he’d defended that miserable son of a bitch. He’d said, God, the most awful things to Toni. He’d fed into the fear he’d known she had, about being a bad mother.
Erskine grinned at him, Philips was muttering something, even Agent Carter was smiling slightly… but for some reason, it was Stark’s muted huff of surprised laughter that lit a small spark in his chest. Brought him down from the adrenaline spike. Shifting his gaze to her in that moment was the only reason that he caught the little exchange between the inventor and his commanding officer.
“Certainly, Madam,” JARVIS replied smoothly, and in the next moment, Toni heard the echoes of shuffling. The comm could pick up the barest of sounds, such as the three separate sets of breathing, but nevertheless, she still ventured a careful, “Hey, Winghead? Is this thing on?”
For another, chairs and their varying comforts rarely meant anything to her. She sat everywhere; even atop the refrigerator, one memorable morning; a consequence of her distraction when her mind was on some scientific genius or highly experimental ideas. She’d even sat inside a giant donut! Obviously there was no consideration given to comfort, when Toni chose to sit amidst her pacing and plotting.
A bare few seconds later, pale blue light flickered and then stayed on, illuminating the small space. “Pleasure to be back, Madam,” JARVIS’ crisp British came over the suit’s speakers, and damn if the AI actually sounded relieved. “Shall I begin with some diagnostics?”
“I promise,” she nodded, voice slightly thick, and pressed a kiss to Peter’s forehead. With the reassurance, the kid finally relented to being sat upon the wooden loveseat that Toni’d had built up here when the Avengers Tower had been remodeled. She had done up an entire roof terrace, outfitted with plenty of spaces for the rest of the team to join her if they wanted to, but over the years, it had become more of a special place between Steve and Toni.
She could figure out the Mommy quandary later. For now, she had a four-year-old, a super soldier, and breakfast in bed to enjoy.
Dimly, she became aware of Steve’s whispered words against her skin as he stroked her through the aftershocks: “So good for me… Mine, my sweetheart… Feel so good, so hot and wet for me… so beautiful, baby…”
“You’re playing with fire, Stark,” Steve warned her lowly as he, too, rose from his reclined position. He replaced his fingers with his mouth, kissing her deep and messy as he wrapped an arm around her waist to pull her closer.
“You are,” Toni reiterated, and hoped that the eight-year-old was too tired and afraid to hear what she deliberately wasn’t saying. That she couldn’t guarantee anything about herself. “But I need you to go back into my superhero suit, okay?”
Tony, who saw the world, and Steve, in a way that no one else ever did. Tony, who treated his bots like they were his children and kept dumb tapes of Steve’s USO days to make him laugh and abandoned everything at 3 in the morning because Steve wanted to get ice-cream.
He took another sip of his drink, all too aware that Stark was still looking at him, and a split second before it became too much, she tore her gaze away and fixed it back on the remaining scotch in her glass.
With no small amount of effort, she managed a weak, “Still here, honey. You’re okay, we’re both okay. Just stay still for a sec, okay?”
Using the hand in his, the super soldier gently tugged Tony closer, thrilling to himself when the genius came easily. “It isn’t,” he replied earnestly, voice hushed with the force of his repressed emotions and feelings of the past week. He raised his free hand; cupped his Tony’s jaw. “And I do return your feelings. I’m
Steve glanced towards the helm of the Quinjet when he heard Natasha’s voice. “You should call her. Give her an update.”
For a few moments, Steve only focused on his breathing, exhausted beyond measure and feeling… God, feeling the same and yet so profoundly different, it was difficult to actually verbalize.
“Real nice example you’re setting for Peter there,” Steve added cuttingly, and it was all too much, too soon, she couldn’t take this from him, too… “Maybe you were right, maybe you’re not cut out to be his mother. Not if you expose him to this.”
She knew without asking, in that moment, that Steve had roped one of the team into babysitting. She’d removed the soundproofing of their room after adopting Peter, and since then, the only times that they’d indulged in being loud, was when they were sure they were alone. It made something inside Toni buzz with satisfaction to know that Steve had been intending on wringing some noise from her.
She, like Nat, had become a sister to him. Clint wasn’t sure when it had happened; probably at some point between the day that she’d opened her home to him, and the day that she’d done the same for Natasha; but regardless of how, it had happened, and it went against his very being to be muddling around helplessly, thousands of miles away, while Toni was in trouble. Logically, he knew that they’d sent their heavy hitters in to help her, giving her the best shot at making it out relatively unscathed, but if he’d learned anything over the years, it was that there was nothing logical about family. Even as he knew that it didn’t make sense, Clint still wanted to be there, to try and do everything in his power to make sure that his surrogate little sister made it out of there without any more damage that she’d already, unacceptably, sustained.
He was a bizarre sort of soldier – speaking without the normal clipped deference and saluting without being in any sort of formation – but when Steve glanced behind him to see the armored man right at the back, offering assistance to some of the former prisoners and some gentle encouragement, he knew that he counted the still-nameless soldier among his friends.
“Not a chance, Doll,” he managed after a second, and before Steve could stop him, Bucky was leaning down and pressing a hard, smacking kiss to Toni’s surprised lips. She laughed, the sound bright and carefree, as Steve grabbed his best friend in a headlock while Bucky tried to defend himself with the repeated reminder that he’d sworn to God he was going to kiss Iron Man.
Steve whirled around, hushed disbelief dripping from his voice as he spoke the words that seemed to be completely insane, and yet made all the sense in the world. “You’re… Iron Man?”
Bucky didn’t miss a beat before replying confidently, “Then she’ll make one.” At Steve’s dubious look, he adopted a look of careless self-assurance, as if challenging Steve to say otherwise. “She’s Toni fuckin’ Stark. If anyone in the world is stubborn enough to create a whole new element just to survive, it’s gonna be her.”
“Oh man, you’ve got that stupid, sappy look on your face,” a teasing voice drifted over the air, making Steve grin despite the words. Bucky was pulling an exaggerated face of disdain, but his eyes were warm and happy. “Thinking about your girl genius again?”
She was snarling, imposing in her own right, in that unique way that seemingly, only a mother could manage.
For a heavy moment, Clint only scrutinized Toni, and Steve would be lying if he claimed he didn’t feel at all jealous at the wordless conversation the two appeared to be having. Abruptly, the archer nodded.
On that note...Coming up is the daring rescue and the epic, much anticipated reunion! ALL THE STONY FLUFF!
“Jesus, is that all it takes to ask someone out on a date? And oh my god, is that why Natasha left early? Was she trying to matchmake me with
After Steve meets with Peggy, he and the rest of the team come up with some new plans - with appearances from new friends and old - to take on Hydra.
Steve went into Tony’s lab a couple of hours later with two bottles of water under his arm and two plates of food – Tony had missed dinner. “Hey, Tony. How’s it going?”
“I didn’t think you’d send out a distress call to watch a movie,” Clint commented, collapsing into an armchair.
“Harley Keener. And he left. Come on into the barn. I’m rebooting the suit for him.” Steve and Thor exchanged a loaded glance, but followed Harley into the barn. They listened as Harley told them about the five shadows for six dead people, Tony talking to the mother of the soldier who died, the fight with people who light up from the inside out, and Tony stealing the fire-guy’s car. “Is he okay, guys? He seems to kinda freak out a lot. All I did was ask him about the portal and he couldn’t even breathe.”
"Don't worry, you'll get them there." She patted his hand. They talked for another hour when he could see her start to flag.
“Well, Captain, you certainly seem like you’ll fit right in with us. The first thing I’d like you to do is recruit Tony Stark. He’d be a huge asset and we need him.”
“She says she needs your help. She thinks her boss is working for the Mandarin.” Steve’s eyes shot to Tony, who hesitated, then nodded.
“Pretty much. Look, maybe it’s crazy, but everyone wanted the serum. They took pints of my blood after Erskine was killed, trying to unlock the secrets of it. As far as I know, that didn’t really help them much. But what if Zola had information on Red Skull’s serum?”
“Fuck off, Clint. You know I don’t hold you responsible for what happened on the helicarrier. That was Loki’s fault.”
The one expression Steve did not expect was confusion. “Okay, we’ll get to the ‘asking a lot’ thing in a second, but what the hell do you mean I’ve given you so much already?”
Natasha smirked at Steve's request and Tony's answer, seeming to decide that Steve was better equipped to cheer Tony up. "We’ll send the list right over, Stark. See you later." With that, she pulled Clint up behind her and they headed out.
“I had to do a lot of rescheduling and rearranging last minute. Very last minute. As in a couple of hours before the wedding. And do you know why?” Steve and Bucky just looked at each other. “I got a call from her fiancee. Apparently she was in a car accident. And when I met her at the hospital, she and her idiot best friend told this fantastical story about a truck full of mysterious and beautiful firefighters who just happened to save them. ‘The most perfect blue-eyed adonis saved me, and I didn’t even get his last name.’ And when I asked if the adonis happened to be named Steve, her idiot best friend fell trying to leap out of the bed at me. ”
“‘If you're afraid of getting a rotten apple, don't go to the barrel. Get it off the tree.’ I need people I can trust, Sam.”
He thought that the pressure would have flustered him, but like everything with Tony, it somehow all fell right into place. “I was jealous because I wanted you with me,” he corrected, the words falling off his tongue like there was simply no other answer. “Wherever we were, I didn’t care, I just wanted you with me.” After a beat, he added lowly, “I always want you with me. Nobody else. Just me. Just you and me.”
From his right, Barnes was suddenly there, a calming hand laid upon his shoulder. Tony had honestly forgotten all about the other man’s presence in the room until right then, but now that he remembered, he couldn’t help rounding on the other brunet as well.
Toni realized at the same time that Steve did, how visible her bruising was, both the vivid handprint and the swelling wrist that Steve had only just noticed himself, probably from her killer punch.
Bruce sighed on the other end, sounding like he was coming off a tense internal battle with his vicious alter ego.
That wasn’t even the right thing to do! Anyone who actually knew Tony, would have known that sending him flowers was ridiculous and clichéd and juvenile, and the real way to his heart would have been something a little less conventional. Steve? He would have gone with sending the genius a bag of his favourite coffee beans, for example. Tony loved the stuff, practically lived on it most days, and it was a personal touch that said a whole lot more than stupid flowers.
Bruce’s frantic call did a stellar job of obliterating any sort of goodwill Steve was feeling. In an instant, the super soldier was there, Rhodes not far behind him. “What happened? What’s going on?”
They’d worked together, as a unit, for years, but for the first time, Steve saw Clint’s normally playful eyes go flat and dark with undisguised murderous intent. Dimly, he found it in himself to be shocked that the archer had reacted even faster than Natasha, who was only now positioning herself protectively in front of Toni and Peter, and part of him felt hurt that they’d believe him capable of hurting the love of his life like that.
On that note, to any mothers who might be reading this, Happy Mother's Day! Y'all are all just incredible <3
For a little while, they joked back and forth, and gradually, the heaviness surrounding Bucky lifted. It helped Toni as well, giving her something to focus on other than the pain and weariness.
she quipped back, somehow managing to stretch some playful flirtiness over what Steve could identify all too clearly as fatigue and pain.
It was like his transformation all over again, and going from living in a reality of black and white, to suddenly being able to see all the colours in the world.
Except that JARVIS was always kept in perfectly updated condition, and he had never, not once failed her, or the rest of the house, and he always took orders fro-…
After a moment, she pulled away, a smile in place that was familiar, but didn’t look quite right to him. “Just fine,” she replied, voice equally soft, and Steve couldn’t help the feeling that he was missing something. Then she was kissing him again, more deliberate this time, and Toni’s mouth against his was one of the top five things Steven Rogers thought made his life worth living, so it really wasn’t a wonder that he lost his train of thought.
In the midst of designing the prototype and internally debating the practical feasibility of adding standard-command AIs into them, Tony had been on a call with one of his foreign investors, schmoozing the man and soothing ruffled feathers in flawless French, all while also running a critical eye over the interim financial reports for the last quarter and musing on ways to amplify the already-impressive turnover that Carbonell Tech had boasted.
Steve pressed his lips to her temple, and for a long moment, kept them there. Later, when they were safe at home and away from watchful eyes in the privacy of their bedroom, Toni knew the relief would hit him full force. There would be a variety of emotions, spilling from both of them in an inarticulate outpouring, and there would be pleas, promises, prayers, uttered mindlessly between them as they rode the storm out together. Reaffirmed that they hadn’t lost each other. Ensured that they’d seen through another too-close call.
Toni rose to straddle her lover, smirking down at him from her position on his lap. The evidence of Steve’s arousal was pretty hard to miss, but as tempting as it was to grind down on him like they both wanted, the inventor thought it would be infinitely more satisfying to tease him first. He had certainly taken a great enough pleasure in doing so to her.
A cavernous sigh was his only response and Tony decided that he didn’t have time to bother with Barnes or changing the gun. He had under 90 minutes left on the clock and if he could design and fabricate a knife that could carry a charge, close combat would be a lot quicker for him, which was good because Jarvis had trained him to fight from a young age – a consequence of constant threats against him as the Stark heir – but the older man’s first lesson had been a golden one:
Steve wasn’t sure how Toni was planning on tracking AIM down, but he had no doubt in his mind that she had a way. If she didn’t, then she’d find one, but the end result would be the same because there was no way in hell that Toni would sit around doing nothing while Peter was in danger. She loved that little boy with everything that she had… and it made Steve grim when he realized that she hadn’t said his name at all, yet.
Okay, loves! Here's a suuuuper long chapter full of the schmoopiest schmoop I could conceivably schmoop, for two reasons: 1, because I have exams in a week so the next update will probably take another week or two, and 2, because I watched Engame this weekend and I AM DESTROYED AND NEED TO BELIEVE THAT MY FANFICTION IS THE NEW CANON!
“What made you come all the way out here?” she asked curiously, playing with the ends of his hair in a way that made him happy enough to want to purr. “How did you even know where I was?”
After a moment, Toni offered a soft, “Thanks for staying behind with him.” She knew just how much that must have cost Nat; the other woman was just as protective as Toni was over this family that they’d managed to find and create, and for whatever reason, that protectiveness had always applied tenfold to Toni herself. It would have been no small feat for the redhead to put aside her instinct to help Toni in order to stay behind and take care of what was more important to Toni than herself.
Amazingly, Steve snorted a small laugh. “Yeah, don’t worry,” he replied amusedly, “I’m not gonna be makin’ you a friendship bracelet anytime soon.”
Ridiculously, the words warmed her even as they calmed her, chasing away the last ebbs of panic in a way that only Steve seemed capable of doing. It took Toni several tries before she felt secure enough to speak without the possibility of her voice breaking.
“I was thinking more along the lines of that little French bistro you liked, but Jesus, you’re never gonna let me live that one down, are you?” Cole laughed, fondness lighting up his eyes. He looked at Tony in the way that a lover would; with affection, lust, and a little bit of secrecy.
“That so?” the billionaire asked, fighting another brief battle trying not to think of Peter. Her distraction cost her the train of thought she’d had going, and it took an extra second for her to remember the Spanish of what she was trying to say. “I suppose that’s a mother thing, then,” she commented lightly, nimbly popping open the panel on the helmet that had most of the circuitry connected to JARVIS’ mainboard.
So she was going to come at this with everything she had. She was going to be the best mother that she knew how to be, and she was going to learn on the fly when she needed to, because this job had been given – entrusted – to her, and Toni wasn’t prepared to be anything less than the best.
“I’m sorry I scared you,” Tony cut in apologetically when Steve’s voice started to roughen back into a growl, tilting his head to kiss underneath his boyfriend’s jaw in remorse. “But I couldn’t do nothing.”
Toni looked torn, and though Steve hated knowing that he’d put that expression on her face, he hated even more the idea that he would one day be the reason that the love of his life accelerated the cause of her ill-health.
“Alright, Rogersaurus.” Tony swiveled around in his chair after Steve’s third moody grunt as a response to whatever he was talking about. Brown eyes narrowed slightly as they considered him. “What’s going on with you?” he demanded, not quite managing to sound pissed when the concern was so blatant in his eyes. “I’ve been yakking for half an hour about the merits of artificial intelligence in medical advancement and you have yet to stop me. What happened? Barton change the settings on your phone to Chinese again? Did Thor eat all the poptarts?”
Again, in his big eyes, there was that implicit trust that had nearly floored her in the workshop. It was a priceless gift, she knew, and Toni would do and give up anything to never let it fade from the child’s gaze.
“I only understood about half of that,” Barnes replied cheerfully, “but if there’s a red dot to follow, you got it.”
Unlocking his phone, he scanned the text quickly and breathed a sigh of relief, both because it was nothing to do with Peter, and because of the information Nat had passed on.
All told, Toni had never been quite so grateful to HYDRA before, although she was careful not to joke about the incident for a few weeks after. Even now, Steve still got a hurt, pinched little look on his face when he thought back to the moment when he’d been unsure if she was clear, or if he was about to hear and see her die, and Toni always hated to remind him of anything that caused him pain.
“I scared the fuck out of myself,” she admitted instead, more candid than she usually was. Habitually, she raised a hand to rub the spot just above her right eye; a thoughtless motion that spoke to her own battered mindset. “I kept thinking of Peter and Steve, and all the rest of you guys, and how many ways things could’ve gone wrong… it was a nightmare.”
“Shouldn’t we be focused on Hydra, not finding me a date?” he said quietly, more than a little desperate now.
“Considering the fact that you were both in my office yesterday, I’m a little confused as to what we’re doing here.”
“I was recruited by the original Hydra. I just happened to die before I could do anything about it. What about you?”
“Look, Honeybear, I know it’s hard to get leave, but I’ve got some stuff I need to talk to you about. Tell the stupid airforce I have armor upgrades.” Steve’s stomach had tightened at the pet name, but he relaxed a little when he figured out it was directed at Rhodey.
Tony brushed this off with a careless wave. “Eh, we were under the influence of Loki’s scepter. Everyone said things they didn’t mean. Old news, bygones, water under the bridge.”
Pepper nodded and started to walk toward the steps to the upper platform. “I’m coming with you.” Her tone brooked no argument.
“You don’t have to thank me for that. You said she’s your best friend. I have something of an issue with best friends falling to their death,” Steve exhaled sharply. “I’m just glad that I could get there in time.”
Steve couldn’t stop his gasp of surprise but tried to school his face. “I could talk all day about Bucky. You’ll have to be more specific.”
“Phil Coulson. Yeah,” Steve said tiredly, seeing Trip’s mouth open to interrupt. “He’s not dead. Helluva shock for me too. Probably above your clearance level, so maybe keep quiet about it, although I can’t say I really care much. Also Sharon Carter. Peggy’s great-niece.”
Bruce laughed. "After everything I've learned, I could not be less of a fan of SHIELD. Your work is safe with me."
Pepper looked over at him from the passenger seat. “You know, you could try a little harder to let my wedding day be about me,” she said with a smirk.
"Talking to Sharon, I got to learn a lot about Peggy's life. The life she lived after, well, me. SHIELD gave me files that let me know all of the commandos are dead, but I was hoping to find their families, maybe learn a little about their lives."
She eyed the two of them speculatively. "Sure. Sounds like fun." Her tone was dry and her face held little expression. Steve realized all at once that, while he didn't know the mistakes his future self had referred to, he was already doing things differently. He had spent the time since thawing almost exclusively alone, finding no enjoyment in anything and no connection to anyone. He also knew himself well enough to know that without the fire lit by Bucky's potential survival, he would not have put much effort into getting to know Natasha or Tony. Clint, maybe. He had the makings of a soldier, not a spy, and he seemed the type to reach out first, especially given his gratitude towards Steve. With their closeness, Natasha may have followed, but it would've taken time, and Steve would've been a mostly passive participant. He hoped it would make whatever difference he apparently needed.
Tony looked up at Steve, wide brown eyes curious and confused. Steve couldn’t look away; he felt his breath hitch as warmth flooded his whole body. He hadn’t realized how close they were. Then Tony cleared his throat and the spell was broken. Steve managed to pull himself together and stepped back as Tony started to babble.
“Aldrich Killian?” Steve cut in with a raised eyebrow. “Yeah, we know. Get on the quinjet. We’re not just here because you suddenly and without explanation fell off the grid. Tony,” he said seriously, wishing he was certain enough of Tony’s reaction to put his hand on Tony’s shoulder, “Maya Hansen was not a victim. She was there to help Killian kidnap Pepper. We think he’s trying to get you to help them fix Extremis.”
Steve laughed. “No. We’re working on how to figure out how to send the information out without tipping off Hydra, but we haven’t got a handle on it yet. I’m here for two reasons. First, because I wanted you to be on guard when you go back on duty. You’ll be working one-on-one with a high-up Hydra operative. I’m giving you this tablet developed by Tony Stark to communicate with us if you get any idea about what he or Hydra might be planning.”
“They have to account for their audience. They know I’m a little dense,” Steve replied, standing to face Tony. Tony laughed. “Tony, I know you said no emotions, but I really want to thank you for this. I know I’m asking a lot, and you’ve already given me so much. If at any point you need some extra space from me, I hope you’ll tell me. I can go to DC for a few days, hang with Sam while he wraps up his life there.”
He gave her a half-smile and a shrug in return. He'd already checked in using his fake ID and credit card, so he took her directly to the room. He made tea and sat across the table from her.
“Yeah, that’ll definitely cut deep. Can you believe Jemma shot Sitwell?” Steve chuckled at the thought.
Tony’s smirk definitely widened at that. “You know, I haven’t seen him salute anyone else. You must be special. In fact, he has an amazing disregard for orders that no one ever seems to mention in the history books.”
Clint shot up from where he was lounging on the couch and Natasha was immediately behind him. Bruce looked alarmed, but said nothing.
Tony brushed him off with another wave of his hand. “I’m fine. Mild cardiac dysrhythmia. Goldielocks gave me a little jolt, so we’re square. Let’s get back to the actually important stuff. Future us came back, tried and failed to steal the tesseract, stole Loki’s scepter, then brought back the scepter, left you a voicemail – which contained a mystery piece of personal information, the news that your lifelong best friend from the 40s is not dead, and the instructions to trust me – and then Marty McFly’ed back to the future. Did I miss anything?”
Natasha hesitated, then reached across the table and rested her hand on top of his. "You're right that trust should go both ways. I don't have that with many people. Clint's about it, really. You trusted me today, and you trusted him to fight with us, after Loki. I have some things I'd like to tell you, but I think they'll be hard for you to hear. You need to prepare yourself."
Current Steve tried to have JARVIS stop the playback, but Tony interrupted, “No you don’t. This is the Cap 1 v Cap 2 fight. I gotta see this.” Steve groaned, but didn’t argue. Just then, the rest of the team came in.
“Ah, I see you replaced the brick. With a StarkPhone! Good choice.” Tony seemed genuinely pleased that Steve had picked a StarkPhone.
You will notice I just skipped over the fight scenes. This is because I realized I can't write fight scenes. I'm terrible at them. This is largely what drove my initial writer's block for this chapter - I knew there had to be fighting and yet I couldn't write the fighting. Anyway, in future chapters we'll get more info about the specifics of the fight.
“Definitely. Can you get to New York? I know that the rest of the team would be happy to see you, and Stark Tower – ”
Pierce glanced at his watch. “This has been lovely, Captain, but I’m afraid I have other engagements to attend to. I have time for a quick toast to our new partnership, but then I really must run.” When Pierce turned to pour drinks, Steve seized the opportunity to plant one of Tony’s bugs under the desk and slip Tony’s (what seemed like magical) transmitter into a slot in the computer under the desk. He was thankful for all the times Tony had drilled him on the move, because he was able to finish it despite the fact that he couldn’t hear much beyond the pounding in his ears. When Pierce turned back, Steve was standing and ready to accept the whiskey. “What shall we drink to, Captain?”
"Why, I'm fine, Tony, thanks for asking. How are you doing?" Steve smiled wryly as Tony flapped his hands as if to wave off Steve's questions.
Tony continued to fiddle with his projects, then sighed and scrapped everything he’d done in the last hour. He wasn’t sure when it had happened, but he’d gotten used to Steve sitting in his workshop and sketching. He’d spent three days in his workshop, stewing in his own anger and misery. His parents had died more than 20 years ago. He’d come to terms with it. He had enough reason to hate his father without blaming him for the car accident. Maybe more of this than he wanted to admit was about Steve choosing Bucky over him. Damn Clint for being right.
The corner of Steve’s mouth quirked up, but he continued smoothly, “Avengers Tower is completely secure. This is not a SHIELD discussion. Avengers only. I’d like to consider you part of our team, Phil.” He held his hand out for Phil to shake.
No matter how many times Tony told him not to, Steve still looked up at the ceiling whenever he spoke to JARVIS. “Yes, JARVIS?”
This was the most emotion Steve had ever seen from her. Well, he needed to earn her trust, and she was giving him the perfect opening. “Trust goes both ways, Romanoff. But I’ll tell you, because someone has to trust first. Bucky was my best friend. My family in everything but blood. What do you know about me from before the serum?”
"Got yourself a brilliant lady, there, Goldilocks," said Tony, patting Thor on the shoulder. "I confess, that didn't occur to me. So, what do we want to do? Go bat cleanup on the whole invasion thing almost a year later?"
He tried to speak, but nothing came out. He cleared his throat and tried again. “Pepper?” he croaked. “Are you okay? Are you hurt?” It hurt to turn his head much, but he pushed past it enough so that he could see her out of the corner of his eye. She looked shaken, and there was blood pouring out of her nose. He reached his hand out to put it on her thigh.
“I can confirm everything the Captain has stated thus far, sir. The energy signature of the man he fought was definitively not Loki. The explanation provided by the man in question does seem to be the most logical one. I do not have a DNA sample, but based on all of the scans available to me, he was who he said. In addition, tracing his movements back to his arrival in the tower, I have discovered new information. He arrived here in the company of two other men. One has never visited the tower, but based on facial recognition, his identity is Scott Lang, who is currently in prison for breaking into Vistacorp’s headquarters and hacking their systems to return money to their customers. There are no records of him escaping prison. The other man, in all ways I can determine, was Anthony Edward Stark. These two men were in the lobby when you were leaving with Thor. The other Anthony Stark disguised himself as a SHIELD agent, while Scott Lang appears to be able to change his size at will. I believe they were responsible for the malfunction in your arc reactor. Based on my review of the video footage, I believe they were attempting to steal the tesseract until Loki took it and vanished.”
“Figured it was about time to make good on my promise to sign your cards. Of course, yours were covered in blood, but Tony was nice enough to help me find some new ones.”
“Rough day, Champ?” asked Tony. “J told us you activated your tech. We’ve been watching the feed. Want some popcorn?”
Clint laughed outright at that. “Well I sure as hell can’t help you with the science side of Stark, but I can get you started on the rest of it. It’ll give me something to do when I’m not sleeping tonight.” Though he said it as if it were a joke, Steve could tell it wasn’t. Clint had to be reeling after being the puppet of a madman bent on total destruction. “The music part’ll be easy. You work out a lot, right? We can put some stuff on your phone for you to listen to at the gym. If you’re okay losing your phone for the night, I’ll load’er up for you.” Clint reached out a hand, and Steve handed over his phone. Clint blinked rapidly. “Um… no offense, Cap, but what the hell is this?” Steve immediately remembered Tony calling his phone a brick.
“Probably, given some time. I’ll put him on it when we hang up. Clint and Natasha checked in. They’re going through a list of properties listed under either Killian or AIM, but again, it’s going to take some time to eliminate all the extra places.”
“Why not? You were the only one there with him when he died. You told me you didn’t even kill him – the tesseract did it for you. So we just come up with a story in which he convinced you of the need of Hydra but died touching the tesseract because he wasn’t as strong as he thought, and you couldn’t do anything about it because, Hydra or not, you had people in New York that you didn’t want to see nuked. You wanted a more… orderly Hydra. Only taking out those who were a direct threat."
“Well thanks for the save, then.” Tony sighed. “I know that Bucky Barnes was a good guy. I know that he wouldn’t have killed them if given a choice. And I know that we still have to get him out. I read the files, too. But it’s not just that he killed my parents. Honestly, you’re right, they were crappy parents, and things would probably never have been different. It’s also something Cap said when he was telling me. He said he thought his future self didn’t tell the me in that timeline, and that’s what he was trying to warn us about. So does that mean that Steve wouldn’t have told me without the warning? Would he have kept something that big a secret? Would he have picked Bucky over us?”
“You were unconscious for approximately 15 minutes, Captain Rogers.” Steve jumped to his feet, bracing himself for an attack.
Steve starts working with Natasha, but she's a tough nut to crack. This chapter also deals with the Mandarin, and Steve learns something interesting.
“Actually, sir, Stark indicated that he’d be… uncomfortable pursuing this at SHIELD. He didn’t really say why, but I don’t think it does any harm to cooperate with him here. When we spoke a couple of weeks ago, he said he’d set up a training floor. I expect it’ll be crawling with robots by now,” Steve chuckled.
“It’s just an old model,” Natasha soothed. “If you’re comfortable with this one, you can keep it.” She eyed Steve speculatively. “But if you’re tired of the kid gloves, we can help you pick one out.”
Bruce, who had remained quiet during the exchange, chuckled, then extended his hand. “I’m glad you’re alright. Thor will be glad too.”
Bruce was thoughtful. “You know, Steve, I think that if we could get to a safe enough area, that would be alright. He likes you. He saved Tony for me – we’re linked enough that he could tell how important Tony was to me, and he liked that Tony made me feel sort of okay about the whole thing. But he definitely liked you the best. You treating him like part of the team made a big difference.”
He got to the cafe a little early and sat down in a corner booth with his black coffee to wait. Natasha came in exactly on time, stopped at the counter for a frothy-looking iced coffee, and casually made her way over. She sat across from him and said nothing, sipping her drink. Then, abruptly, she said in a quiet voice, “Tell me about Bucky Barnes.”
Steve dreamed of Bucky again, but this time, it was of the two of them at Coney Island. It was a nice change. When Clint arrived, he seemed a little uncomfortable, and Steve wondered if there was some kind of problem. He didn’t have long to wait.
They settled into the couches and armchairs and, in the case of Clint, sprawled across the floor, leaning up against Natasha's legs where she sat on the loveseat next to Bruce. They went through the whole story, with only a couple of clarifying questions.
He was interrupted when a strawberry-blond woman ran in on heels so high Steve couldn’t believe she was still upright. “Tony, oh my god, are you okay? Why aren’t you at the hospital? I can’t believe you. When JARVIS told me you were in your workshop, I swear I had to pick my jaw up off the floor. Have you eaten anything? You need to get some rest. I’m putting my foot down, Tony, I mean it.”
Tony’s eyes shot back up to Steve’s as he took a tiny step closer. “An idiot, huh?” His voice was quieter than before, almost husky.
“Some things are worth breaking orders for,” Steve interrupted. “I think this was one of them. I’d like to be able to trust you with my team, but something like this can’t happen again. I’ll certainly be having some interesting discussions about it with Fury. Now, it could be that you know more about SHIELD than I do. On the other hand, maybe you don’t.” He put his hand on Clint’s other shoulder. “Tony and I talked about it, and like I said, I’d like to bring Phil in, but it’s your call, Clint.”
Trip laughed. “Yeah, I can see that. Look, this is all pretty heavy, but we’ll get through it. I’ll let you know if I get anything on Garrett. And let me know what I can do.” He raised an eyebrow when Steve’s phone played a snippet of the song
“And despite all the hardships you faced, you knew real love, right? Your mother loved you? And Barnes? Now imagine you’re someone who hasn’t ever experienced happiness or kindness or love. And imagine you had longer with Erskine. He spent time with you, teaching you things, encouraging you, molding you. Could you have refused him anything?”
After the tire squealing and crashing ended, Steve heard, “Sonuvabitch!” before Bucky dropped the wrench he was holding and took off after Clint, Sam and Steve getting up and running just a moment behind him. Steve watched as Clint waved the poor driver forward and the formerly beautiful car limped onto the side of the road. Steve ran faster, overtaking Bucky and Sam.
Second, all of the titles in this story have been/will be Queen songs. For the most part, they’re just representative of what’s happening in the chapter, but there will be some that focus on Steve’s relationship with a particular character and the chapter is named with whatever song I’ve decided to have as that character’s sort of theme song. This chapter is Tony! There are some that came to me pretty easily (like this one!), but I would LOVE to hear ideas for Queen theme songs for any of the characters. Let me know in the comments :)
“You had every right to be hurt. They were your parents. Even if things weren’t always great, you had every right to be mad.”
"I could probably make some time for you in my extremely busy schedule. Let's go. See you tomorrow, Nat."
Steve cleared his throat. “Harley, we have to go.” Steve pulled out his phone and called the tower. “Hey Bruce, we hit a dead end. Tony was here, but he left. We did get some new information though, something about people who light on fire from the inside out? Tony fought a couple.”
Steve looked at her and made a snap decision. "I’m as ready as I’m likely to get. I’ve had a helluva few months, Natasha. I keep saying nothing else will surprise me, and things keep happening just to prove me wrong. Go ahead and say it, and I’ll pick up the pieces like I always do.”
"Nope, no time for pleasantries. You remember when I said that anyone recruited by Agent was probably good stuff?" Steve nodded. "Well I decided to start my search of SHIELD personnel with people recruited by Coulson."
“I wasn’t worried, Tony. I planned the schedule. We’ve got plenty of time. Is that - oh my god - what -”
Steve walked into the tower only ten minutes later. He knew he was wearing what Clint called his Captain face. “JARVIS, can you please tell me whether the other Avengers are here yet?”
Several hours later, Steve breathed a sigh of relief as he rode up the elevator of the tower. “JARVIS, could you please tell the team I’m back? Ask if they’ll meet me in the common room?”
I have basically no excuse, other than life happened. My cat got really sick, and then Christmas, and then my other cat got really sick, and work drama. Anyway, here we are! We get to see a few new characters, although not the ones that I initially thought I’d bring in. There will be a LITTLE bit of stuff from Agents of SHIELD, but I think this should be readable even without seeing it. Some of it what’s in here is semi-spoiler-y for stuff that happened in season 1 (details in endnotes). If you’re confused about any of the stuff here, let me know!
Steve swallowed, feeling guilty that he hadn’t seen how much Tony was struggling, but it was Thor who answered. “Ah, he has seen many hard things. Iron Man is a hero, but sometimes that comes at a price. He is rightly haunted by the things he has lived. I have seen this in many a great warrior.” Harley nodded.
After they all made it back to their respective apartments, Steve pulled out the computer that Natasha had helped him buy and started in on some research. He put Clint’s playlist on in the background and set out to figure out the library system. He had some reading to do.
“I’m meeting with Sharon tonight. Unless she has something in particular that needs dealing with here, I’ll be back tomorrow. Most of the Hydra agents we know about are there, and I’d like to keep an eye on them. I’ll let you know what I find out from Sharon.”
Time to start building the new team. Though they’d been forged in battle, just as the Howling Commandos had, they needed to do some of the normal stuff, too – playing cards, telling wild stories, talking about their girls back home. The real bonding happened in the little moments between battle. Steve cleared his throat, eyes on his food. “So, it seems I’ve got an awful lot of culture to catch up on. Anyone want to help me with that?” He looked up from under his lashes, trying to gauge their reaction. As usual, Natasha showed none, though she did glance briefly at Clint. Clint, on the other hand, looked excited.
Tony handed him a tablet of some kind. “You can put it in here. Not hackable remotely and mostly not hackable in person, although from what I read, that Skye of yours could probably do it with access to the tablet. Put it somewhere she won’t be tempted to try. I’ll be able to see anything you do on this tablet, so use a different one to look at porn.”
“Sure, facial recognition for one thing. I also got Romanoff to tell me about the Winter Soldier missions she’s familiar with so I could set up an algorithm to detect any similar incidents.” Steve winced. “Sorry, but we’ve got to assume that since they’ve still got him, they’re still using him. They don’t know that we know.”
Clint snorted. "Don't you worry about Thor. He came to earth and found a girlfriend in one day. Feisty, brilliant woman who ran over him with her van. After which her assistant tazed him. She's flying in – should be landing soon." His tone darkened. "Nat, can I crash on your couch? I might sleep better knowing someone who can cognitively recalibrate me if necessary is sleeping in the next room." Natasha nodded and went to get him some blankets. Clint cleared his throat. "Hey, uh. Cap. I just… I wanted to thank you. For trusting me. I tried to kill you, and you let me fight at your side. No questions asked. Means a lot to me. That you had my back. Just know, if you ever need it, I'll have yours." Affection filled Steve. He could do this. He could make this team.
“Mostly, yeah, but some come in through the Hydra Prep Academy. Sitwell did. Mostly legacy kids whose parents were Hydra back in the day.”
“The blue was on the original model, but the vision wasn’t. My senses are… heightened. Smell, hearing, vision, taste, even touch to an extent. My hearing, for example, is good enough that I can hear people talking the next room over. Say when I’m at the SHIELD gym.”
"You figured I was the one most likely to tell Fury, so you wanted me on board first. Smart. You have my word. So, have I proved myself worthy?"
“It’s been almost a year since you woke up, though. It would be natural to think about dating.” She laughed in delight at the look of absolute panic on his face. “Don’t worry, солнце
Steve could see Tony starting to panic and withdraw. “No, hey, I didn’t mean it in a bad way. Just, I haven’t done this in more than 70 years. I’m a little rusty.” He smiled and stepped back towards the couch, pulling Tony with him. “I’ve never been able to be with someone and have it not be a secret. I’ve also never been with someone in this body. And I don’t really know how things work now. Is it… was this just kissing for you?” Steve hunched his shoulders, trying to make himself smaller.
The woman let out a strangled sort of laugh. “No, my wedding is this afternoon. Tony and I are on our way to the venue. I guess all that money I spent on my hair and makeup is a total loss.”
Bruce looked between Steve and Natasha. "Well, I'm certainly not going to tell Fury. And considering the fact that you already told Natasha, it seems that you trust her not to. To be honest, I'd rather stay as far away from SHIELD as I can.”
Now that the whole team had moved into the tower, Steve felt a lot less alone. He was always running into someone. He still sketched a lot in Tony’s workshop, but he also sketched in common areas when Tony was at the office. As he’d both settled into the tower and done more sketching, he found himself able to lose himself in it and forget his surroundings. He knew all the occupants of the tower; none of them were a threat, so he was able to release some of the hypervigilance he’d held onto in his old apartment. While this was generally a good thing, it did come with the downside that now, Natasha could sneak up on him.
He shook his head. “The point is, a baseline human couldn’t’ve made it. Someone with the serum, though, they would’ve had a chance. The only place he coulda gotten it was Zola. And that’s also reason enough for SHIELD to want to work with him. Although I can’t believe Peggy would’ve been on board.”
They entered the Tower; no one was around, but the elevator was waiting, and JARVIS greeted them. "Welcome, Captain. It is good to see you again. Please enter the elevator. It will take you to meet Mr. Stark." If Steve thought it was possible, he would've said that JARVIS's tone cooled. "Hello, Miss Romanoff. You may accompany Captain Rogers." Steve managed to keep a straight face, but he chuckled internally. It would seem that Tony's AI was awfully loyal.
