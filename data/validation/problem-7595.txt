to notice anything?
Tony's voice is kind, his expression a little amused as he gestures to Steve's hardness.
Steve gets back to the compound in record time. He considers going to his room to shower, but he really wants to surprise Tony. He’s only a couple minutes out now, and decides to head straight for the master suite. Tony provided him blanket access to everywhere on the compound. He cranks his music up in his wireless ear buds for the last sprint, a wide smile plastered to his face.
"I just saw you kiss, thought ‘wow look at that, that’s hot,’ and left.” Scott makes a straight-line movement with his hands. “Totally professional.”
Steve opens his mouth to protest, but a sleek red thumb slips inside. He closes his eyes and gently sucks, giving in to whatever is going to happen this time. Relaxing into being with Tony has become one of the only times he feels at peace lately. Might as well enjoy what he can before he wakes up.
Tony takes stock of himself. He still has his shirt on, the vid-screen would just show him from the shoulders up with the rest of the room in the background. The lube and his other toys aren’t in frame… and Steve still isn’t due for another 40 minutes. If his plans come to fruition, he’ll be busy with Steve for at least the next several hours. So if this is something urgent, better to take care of it now.
Steve surreptitiously takes one of the golden lube tubes out from under the nearby pillow and adds its contents to a second finger. It’s a tight fit, and the way Tony moans Steve is concerned he’s hurting him. He lowers Tony’s legs and lets them fall to the bed, allowing his lower body to go slack and loose, with his fingers still pressed inside.
“Huh,” says Tony, “Like a “Kid of the Avengers Scholarship”? Good idea Steve, I’ll let Clint know…”
Steve lays there for another minute, trying to work up his own motivation to leave the bed.
Steve moans weakly as he realizes Tony is doing exactly what he said he'd do, fucking is mouth with his tongue. In response he sucks Tony's tongue into his mouth just like he did his cock, his own erection showing interest again, never having fully softened.
Tony continues without pause. “I want everything from you Steve, all of you, I want to take you in ways you’ve never imagined, I want you to scream my name until your throat is horse, I want to bruise you, I want you to bruise me, I want to use you until your whole world narrows to just me, just us. Is that what you want, Steve?”
Pete huffs, it’s not like the mask is uncomfortable, he was just looking forward to hanging out face to face. Like a real member of the team.
He hears Tony huff an almost-laugh and shut the door. Steve’s face heats up as he tries to figure out what Tony must think… he strips the shirt off and turns it inside- out before tucking it slightly under his side of the bed which is out of Tony’s view unless he comes around Steve’s side.
Nebula stiffens. “I’m fine. My body… there’s usually one thing or another that hurts. It’s fine. I haven’t had time to conduct repairs in a while.”
“To coming home” the rest say in unison, and dig in. The paprikash is about half gone when Steve clears his throat. They’re doing this.
Tony and Strange bring Nat, Wanda, Scott and T’Challa through the portal with just enough time to go over the game plan one more time.
Tony is now angling his legs over Steve’s where he sits in the sand, frozen. “Tony, I’m seeing –”
“If at any time I do something you don’t like, or if you have a question we’ll stop okay? Just say ‘Stop’.”
Steve smiles at him and pulls him in for a hug. And dang, Scott is 99% straight, but he might just be holding out that last one 1% for Captain America.
Tony thought he’d found that with Pepper, but it turned out he took more than she could give in the end. Or maybe he gave more than she could take… But the beauty of what he had with Pepper, he’s realizing now, is that it made him grow the fuck up. For once he doesn’t feel like he’s at a loss for how to do this. He can see the infinite ways he could fuck this thing up with Steve, but that glowing ember in his chest is strong, ready. He sees the pitfalls and he is thinking ten steps ahead about how to avoid them.
came, that should have taken the edge off… but it seems over the last few months he’s trained his body that he can come the moment he gets immensely aroused. Night after night he would wake up aching, and rush to take care of himself as quickly and quietly as possible. By the end in order to get even an hour of sleep he’d wake up hard at least two or three times a night, always ready to come. Waiting like this, even though it’s probably only been about 10-15 minutes makes his eyeballs itch and his hair stand on end.
“There are also a couple of options for how you’ll be positioned. Honestly, I think we are likely going to have to give you two doses today, so I think we can try both, and that way we will know what you prefer in the future. How does that sound?”
Tony goes on, “A lot of what we did, the kneeling, orgasm denial, the way you took me and told me what to do. It skirted, or outright ran into dominance and submission, which is adjacent to a lot of other stuff like S&M. How are you feeling about all that?”
“Tony… what are you doing?? Do you have any idea how worried I’ve been about you just, just being Steve’s
He enters and Steve is sitting at the edge of the bed; a small smile plays on his face as he looks up at Tony, but he doesn’t look nervous. God how does he do that? Tony hopes his nerves don’t show on his face. He’s gotten used to having the armor, a layer of protection between himself and the world. If his face was frozen in fear or taught with pain, no one could tell behind the sleek faceplate.
Oh that’s gorgeous. Tony needs more of that.
“Roo” and she points her nose at Steve.
They shower briefly and collapse on the bed, awakening  once it’s dark outside. They go out to dinner in the city and then take a paddle boat ride in central park.
Steve considers that sleep deprivation and dream conditioning may be playing a role here, but that doesn’t really feel like an explanation. It’s more that his dreams have been helping him work through some pretty heavy demons… he can’t deny that these dreams have been pushing him closer and closer to something. Something he didn’t allow himself to think about when he was actually around Tony day-to-day. Tony had Pepper, and Steve… Steve never truly let go of the past. Even with Sharron he’d been holding back. Part of him knowing whatever they had was just a nice placeholder because no matter what he did he would always be a man out of time.
Med-kink for days y'all.
Tony doesn’t seem to have the same qualms though, because he quickly unzips Steve’s pants and leans up so he can whisper into his ear. Steve almost comments that it’s just the two of them, he doesn’t need to talk into his ear like that...
“Okay that may be significant.” says Bruce.
“See Cap? Totally under control! In a couple weeks it’ll be like it never happened at all.” His voice is tight, and falsely bright, and it sounds just like it did the first time Steve talked to him after his break up with Pepper.
But Steve is ticking all his boxes and seems eager for more... The fact that he needs to come at least twice makes Tony's head spin with the possibilities.
Scott would love to see the whole team together out at Coney Island, enjoying a day at the beach.
Peter >> Yes, I saw them kiss and everything 👨❤️💋👨
Steve dissolves into a series of incredibly charming giggles. Captain America, giggling. God Tony wants to record that sound and upload it to his private server. Turn it into a white noise machine setting. Maybe make it his ring-tone.
Less than a minute later Steve tells him to come in. The blanket is still all the way up to his neck, but Tony figures maybe that’s some weird, old-timey I-just-masturbated-and-now-need-to-cover-up thing that people did.
Tony raises an eyebrow “Is that the same “spell” you were using to hide that green ring-pop around your neck? Cause they just found you pretty easily.”
Tony asks the air around them “Hey Friday, how much traction does our relationship have online?”
Or maybe it was Steve that changed? All he knows is that once he talked with Tony, being with Becky just wasn’t the same. Two weeks after he and Tony get back from Hawaii, they break up. Steve feels guilty, but he also knows it was for the best. Becky deserves more than to be with someone who has feelings for someone else.
“Try that now, bud.” Tony says to Thor.
“Anything” says Steve. Oh Steve, you know not what you do.
After they get their drinks she starts.
There was always this quiet dread that he’d say the wrong thing.
Steve>> Stopping off to see Buck. Should be back within 48 hours.
When they pull apart Tony is breathing heavily. Steve seems mostly recovered, his chest rising and falling normally. Tony’s gaze drifts further down to see that Steve is fully hard again. Sweet Jesus.
“Great work Stark, glad to see you can be a team player.”
Dream Tony is a decent size, but there isn’t much of him on either end of where he’s grasped himself. Just an inch or two of give as he pumps back and forth. Steve feels his blood pound as it occurs to him that Tony is going to milk himself into Steve’s mouth. His gauntleted fist continues to slide back and forth, back and forth, the way made easy by the copious amount of salvia Steve has left behind.
“And you’ve been having unprotected sex from the start?” Bruce asks.
Peter meets the team, and Tony's boyfriend.
Then he hears something that makes his blood run cold. And hot.
, Tony! You two broke up the team over what happened, how can you… how can you possibly think this is a good idea? Do you even remember the last six months?!”
Steve looks through the package and sees there are some clothes and other items inside it including a clipboard with paperwork, a pale blue button up, khaki pants, a doctor’s coat (including a pocket protector and fountain pen), and a pair of glasses. Steve smiles and picks up the glasses. They are wire-framed and look a bit old-fashioned, even to him. There are no shoes, but Steve figures he should just wear his semi-formal loafers. He’s been to enough doctors to know how to dress like one. He quickly puts on the clothes and the glasses, anxious to get back to Tony.
Tony’s hand travels down naturally, starting a familiar rhythm before he stops himself. He can’t actually have Steve at the moment, but he might as well imagine what it would be like… Steve would knock on the bathroom door, asking if Tony had an extra toothbrush. He’d come in, maybe thinking the shower had curtains, that he could just slip in and slip out. But the shower is glass, and he’d get a full view of Tony, touching himself, bracing one hand against the glass as the other stroked.
He pulls off of Tony’s mouth slightly to say against his lips, “Want you to come Tony. Want to watch you paint the shower wall.” He strokes him and gently applies the slightest pressure to his sack, then leans back in to kiss him with the same careful rhythm he’s applying with his hands.
helping me out, but I don’t want it like that. I don’t want to feel like you’re, like you’re just going through the motions, or getting me off like some kind of…” Steve can’t finish.
At first Tony isn’t even aware he’s said it. He was thinking of saying it. Of course he was, he’s imagined saying that very thing to Steve ten times a day. But in the rush to get his suit on and get his hair to flop just right, he’s just… said it.
Steve takes his hands off his handholds and brings them around to Tony’s front. His left hand wraps around his length, while his right cups his balls. He’s glad he’s already come once, it took the edge off. He is confidant he can handle Tony like this without losing control.
“Steve,
“Okay, sorry about that. Man, I love the Air Force, but I’m starting to look forward to knocking out the last of this tour and enjoying retirement.”
He didn’t need more than a few hours of sleep at a time after the serum, but he found if there wasn’t a dire reason to get up, he could easily sleep ten hours straight through. It helped. Sleep was always a respite, a way to recharge and refocus.
No Tony does fucking not.
The phone is dead, so he sets it on Tony’s wireless charging pad. They’ve spent the last day alternating between intense physical release, and calm periods where they eat, talk, and just generally enjoy each other’s company. Steve knows they’ve covered all the ground they can with the accords and strategizing to bring the team back home. He really should be heading out to see Buck, and then return to the others...
“I hate you.” Nebula replies.
“Right,” says Tony, “I didn’t realize you were Point Break’s emotional support animal, that makes sense.”
Tony’s head launches up off the bed where it had been thrown back in pleasure. He looks ready to spit fire.
Tony smiles; it seems like whatever was bothering Steve has passed. He still makes a note to bring it up with him later though. Wow, look at that. He’s a new and improved Tony. Talking about feelings, open, empathetic, doing the work.
“I’m dating Captain America!” Tony practically shouts. “Well, okay technically Steve Rogers, but that’s just as good. Better. And before you say anything, I just want to tell you that I’m happy, like exponentially happy. And so is Steve, I think. And Pepper knows, and that was a whole thing, but I think it’s fine. And yeah. We’re in a relationship and we’re telling people and I wanted you to be one of the first to know.”
Tony shakes his head and focuses on Steve. Steve who is waiting for him in the bedroom right now.
Once free Tony slides his hands up to rest on the muscular area between Steve’s neck and shoulders.
“We’re ready to rock, sugarplum.” Nebula and Shuri trade another glance. "So, who is trying this thing on?" Tony asks.
“Tony.”
"And then what?" Asks Strange.
Instantly his mouth is full and he’s pressed against Tony’s warm, smooth leg. It’s euphoria. Steve has never been this desperate to come, not in any of the nights he’s woken up from his dreams, never.
Mouthy Steve is out in full force any Tony is
“Fuck.”
“Tony, I know it must be hard to pin-point since as of now this appears to have accumulated slowly over time, but can you think of any other side effects? How is your appetite? Your sleep? Have you noticed any changes? I can download a more detailed survey which may jog your memory, but does anything jump out?”
Very explicit, like, probably don't read this in public...
Tony laughs and shows Steve, who smiles shyly.
different shade of grey. She touches her ear, “Everyone rally to my location, I think I see the lead orb.”
Tony leans back fully as instructed, and he realizes it’s like he’s in a sex swing, but the swing is
Tony snorts a laugh, and Pepper looks incredulous. “Haha, oh man Pepper, thanks for that vote of confidence! … Why don’t you tell me what you
“Hey I see that look!” says Tony.
Super long end note ahead!:
“Ah to be a part of a romantic couple again!” interrupts Thor. “I have so many cherished memories of that time with Jane. Just her and I, caught up in a lover’s trance. But oh how these last years have been lonesome. The past few months especially… Although I was able to save the Earth and return my people, it
It was easier than he thought it would be. He kept his hands to himself the whole day, and only said about five things that could be considered flirting… and if he caught himself making moon eyes at Steve as he chased down a balloon that got away from a little girl, or had indecent thoughts as he watched Steve suck away at his lion cup, well, that’s what the extra layer of dark tint on his Oliver Peoples sunglasses is for.
They’d even recklessly started something in the kitchen the other day just before Scott arrived back at the compound. The only thing that prevented him from walking in to see Tony’s hand down Steve’s pants was the proximity alarm Tony set up with Friday. She warned them with enough time to put themselves together and hastily start a pot of coffee.
The following month Peter, well,
“Are you alright?” asks Shuri.
He’s lost track of time; he should get out. The smooth granite isn’t especially forgiving on his knees anyway.
Now that the team knows they are “working on a puzzle” it’s like they’ve been transported back to those two amazing days in the tower. Just them, nothing to interrupt or get in the way.
Tony has already been in the shower for a while, so he doesn’t even bother to undress, just pushes his boxers down and grasps himself desperately. It takes less than thirty seconds before he hears a final groan from Tony in the shower and his vision whites out.
he is.
Tony feels an electric shot go through him. Of course he figured Steve thought about them doing this once or twice before just falling to his knees before him. But well, they haven’t had the smoothest time of things the last few months… or really ever, so to hear "you" so immediately, with so much honesty. So much longing.
“Tony, look we need to talk” Steve says as he reaches Tony, who is now standing resigned next to the un-opened umbrella and his abandoned towel.
“Alright everyone,” says Steve, catching the hint. “See you tomorrow for training. Tony is ordering in Shawarma for lunch after so bring your appetites.” Nat throws a small smile their way at that, and Steve realizes a little wistfully that she is the only other member of the team other than Tony that gets the reference.
Tony briefly wishes he was twenty years younger. Though twenty years ago he would probably have been equally impatient, and all this would be over in about six minutes.
The best sex of his life, is what. Which is really saying something because he dated Naomi Campbell for about a week in the 90s.
So close. Scott pauses in place but doesn’t turn around.
Wong eyes the slumped form of Thanos. "We may also have something to restrain him in the archives. You must be getting tried, no?"
Okay, so.
Steve presses on, sensing that he’s in a losing battle. “Well, I mean of course we are happy to spend time with you Thor but-“
Steve slides his hands down Tony’s back to slip under the curve of his ass, suddenly remembering  howTony exclaimed when they first started that he wanted Steve to “move him around however he wanted.” Tony can be like Steve’s Dream-Tony, but he's also the opposite. Tony likes to be
Steve smirks and pulls Tony toward the common area to wait for Scott.
Bruce must have a deer in the headlights expression, because Steve continues: “Not that I expect you to have any answers or anything… I mean I haven’t even really explained yet… I just. I really need some advice here. I have no idea what I’m doing and I’ve handled this whole thing so terribly.”
He’s trying, and if he can try, so can Steve.
When they were in a relationship she always seemed to keep her calm professional demeanor, even when it was just the two of them. Probably thought she could lead by example for him or something.
The instant Steve kneeled in front of him, all that strength and all the purpose, surrendered on a silver platter to Tony. He sees he was lost from that moment. Completely fucked. In love with Captain America. He just hopes Steve is anywhere near the same galaxy as him right now. Fuck, he really didn’t want to get into all of this in the middle of their shower, but it looks like needs must…
Steve blushes, not missing what kind of “unwinding” Tony probably needs to do alone in the shower, but nods because he really doesn’t want to leave Tony, or this bed… which Tony must be joking about the price of, right?
Rhodey waves him off, “Just a bunch of jokes about how my dick must not work, you know the military. There are some good guys out here, it’s just that mentality they get when they’re all together. I miss you and your sensitive soul Tony.” Rhodey batts his eyes at Tony.
“Good.” Tony sighs as the fingers slide in and out, scissoring and twisting with purpose.
“More please, Tony. Please more…” Ah, looks like we’ve gained another word. More.
“Hand-holds, Steve.” Tony reminds him. Steve looks up and sees the second set of handholds several inches above the ones Tony is grasping. He reaches out for them, finding that they provide the perfect leverage for him to take Tony from behind.
Steve pulls up enough to kiss Tony. "I’m the happiest I’ve ever been.” he says with conviction, looking into Tony’s eyes.
“I’m more of a consultant really! Luis is handling the day to day, but it’s something we’ve talked about for years and I didn’t want to just abandon him you know? Luis is like, my number one home slice.” Oh god, he just said home slice, get it together, Lang.
that?” he asks Tony, his voice rough.
Steve has the sense to realize what’s happening and stops sliding. He lets go of Tony’s hands to sit up and bear down, squeezing Tony inside him to take him through the last of his orgasm. He tries to memorize Tony’s face. He'll try to paint this later.
It’s not that Tony hasn’t taken the time to reflect on Siberia, the accords, everything. He’s done more than think about it, he’s taken it apart and put it back together. Dissected it, run the whole thing through B.A.R.F. more times than he wants to count.
🇺🇸 🤖 🕷️💛
Ah, and there’s Steve, kneeling there, waiting, expecting
“Oh umm, I think?” says Steve. “That wasn’t really a term when I’m from…”
Steve and Tony sit in shocked silence.
“I want that,” says Steve nodding, “I want everyone to know they can tell me my call is wrong. That everyone has the power to suggest another course of action and change it. I want us to decide things together. To stand united especially over the big stuff.”
Tony reaches out and touches his arm. “Hey no, Friday isn’t
“You want to… marry me?” Steve asks.
bit like you’re offering to blow me? And I know you said “whatever it takes” but yeah, that’s probably not… what you meant... Oh my god please get up or I will keep rambling and it will only get dirtier…”
He jumps up and runs to get it, feeling guilty. What if the team needed him?
Tony laughs a beautiful, genuine laugh. “You know what Steve, you may be on to something… nice modern reference by the way, who sat you down to watch Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory?”
Bruce turns to a small cabinet and opens it, pulling out a small plastic cup with a lid. He hands it silently to Steve.
“That’s great Tony, we’re almost done, one more and then you’ll be ready for the expander.”
“How would Friday know that Tony?! Is she watching? You said that she wasn’t, that your security system halts recordings and that we have privacy when we-“ He can’t say it. It’s some metal block left over from growing up in the 20s and 30s. People just didn’t talk about these things. Even the blue humor he heard in the army was full of inuendo and coded language.
“It never gets old having you call me that!” he blurts. Damn it Lang, control your inner fanboy.
… always ready to lay down on the wire, even when it can be cut.”
. In your bedroom. Telling you he wants to-”
He rolls over and puts it out of his mind. He knows even they can’t solve the problems of the entire multiverse.
He quietly confesses. "I had to..." Thanos looks truly bereft, saying “And now it was for
Steve has never needed to come this badly. He vaguely wonders if it will be like that every time with Tony. It has so far, his need for every new orgasm dwarfing the ones that came before.
Tony can guess the answer from their previous fingering interrogation, but it feels important to go over this while they’re not in the middle of having sex…
Wanda and Vision occasionally babysit and Tony sees a little gleam in Wanda’s eye. Tony wonders if that’s even possible for them. He may have a talk with Vision, he feels too young to be a grandfather…
Steve wants to interrupt, it’s not that
They have the largest pieces of a unification plan settled; the rest will need to develop once Steve returns to his half of the team and Tony has worked more on the amendments. Tony makes a note to provide Steve with an untraceable Stark phone. According to their plan they will probably be separated for at least a month, maybe longer. Tony wonders where Steve stands on phone sex…
Steve just moans and pushes back to meet it. So eager. Tony bets Steve could take a lot, more than the average person, all that bodily perfection. And
The urge to thrust is overwhelming, but Steve realizes with a sinking feeling that he doesn’t know how well he can control his strength like this. He’s never felt like this before, pulled to the edge, barely holding on. Usually when he feels anything like this he’s fighting for his life. Holding back isn’t really an issue in those cases.
But Steve is kissing Tony before he can even get the question out. Steve can’t believe this. He really has been such a stubborn, goddamn idiot.
Steve is so relieved he shifts suddenly to embrace Tony, which results in Tony’s soft cock sliding out of him... along with what feels like an ungodly amount of fluid. It flows down Steve's legs and onto the bed.
like work.
“Take whatever you need, Tony.”
Peter >> Right?! 🤯
Steve presses his face deeper, breathing in. Tony smells amazing, a clean fresh scent mixed with a distinct aroma that’s naturally his. Steve is already zoned out, totally overwhelmed by the smell and feel of him. He spreads his knees a bit further apart so that his face lowers below the waistband and down to his goal.
This is good. He can feel a weight lifting. It was never a possibility anyway.
“Uh, please, please I need…”
Steve suppresses a grin before saying “Please move to the edge of the table Mr. Stark.”
Tony struggles against Steve’s hold, and wow yeah for a second he literally can’t move. He might as well be held in place by vibranium chains. It’s hard sometimes to keep in mind exactly how crazy-strong Steve is… Steve notices quickly that Tony is at least trying to move though and releases him immediately, face pulled into an apologetic grimace.
Soon he has Tony laid out on the bed, his exposed skin a stark contrast to the deep red comforter. Steve hasn't painted much in the last year, but Tony's lightly tanned skin against the crimson material suddenly makes him miss it. A deep ache he hasn't noticed, burried under the more pressing drama of the Accords and all the rest. He resolves to go buy some new supplies and set up a small studio area in his room.
Steve lays his palm on the side of the box to be scanned and clears his throat to utter the last known password he has.
“It’s not about you making the call Tony, it’s about me giving myself to you.” Steve turns Tony’s incredibly sappy words back on him with this little shit-eating smile that Tony wants to bite.
Another full night of sleep and three intense orgasms the night before mean he feels better than he has in months. He looks over at Tony, who is already up. His back is against the plush headboard, glasses on, tapping away at a Stark Pad in his lap.
Dr. Strange nods, as if he’s already heard this speech before. And he probably has, in about 53,000 variations. “I may be able to mask the mind stone with a spell that will make it undetectable to Thanos, at least for a time.”
A month later Tony’s bloodwork has not changed, and they are in the clear. Bruce recommends Tony continue to get tested every couple of weeks to make sure nothing changes, and if nothing does eventually they can go down to testing once a month, and then not at all.
“Tony are you sure you’re in the right head-space for this? Have you talked to Rhodey or anyone else about this? I know it seems like I’m just some jealous ex here, and yes, okay the idea of you sleeping with human perfection isn’t something I really care to think about, but please, I know you, and I know this is-“
Tony is floored and finds himself blushing lightly. Steve has positioned him on his back with his legs tucked up to his chest, his ass up to the open air, spread out before him like an offering.
Steve pulls Tony close into a tight embrace, rolling his body to press against Tony's slighter form. He struggles to resolve all the stressful emotions he associated Tony a few months ago, hell, even less than 36 hours ago with the surging gratitude he feels now. How could he ever have doubted him?
Tony throws Peter the most epic high school graduation party ever. Some kid named Flash won’t leave Tony alone until he promises him he will record a tik-tok video with him.
“Press the button on the bottom-left of the painting on my side of the bed. A staircase will appear in front of you. Take the steps down and walk until you get to the exam room. Friday can answer any questions.”
“Pepper, Pep. Hold on, okay? Look that’s not… that’s not at all how I wanted you to find out about this. Umm, I’m sorry? I don’t know what to say here, we… you…”
Bruce sighs. “I don’t know, I’ll need to do more tests. His blood sample isn’t the same as yours Steve, or mine, which has similar markers due to my experimentation which resulted in The Hulk. His sample is somewhere in the middle. In fact it is more like Sam’s than yours, but there are definite changes. And those changes look a lot like the serum.”
It isn’t up for debate. Thor insists on wielding the infinity gauntlet, and Strange doesn’t offer up an alternative.
“Hmm, I learned this technique not long ago from this really hot guy in his custom modular shower…”
Steve pulls out his phone, “We need to assemble. Everyone.”
Tony eyes some of his toys in the bottom basket, but refocuses on washing Steve. He's taking it slow. Just his hands and mouth will probably be overwhelming for Steve tonight. Man out of time, etc.
hard because I am so turned on, but then I look down and oh, nope. Which again feeds the hotness of you taking me in that state… so, sorry rambling…”
He could build the cutest robotic dog imaginable and Steve would realize that a robot dog is the opposite of terrifying. Maybe he’d make the metal alloys in red white and blue …
about money. Is Avenging a paid gig? How can he ask without sounding like a total dick? All those flights out to San Francisco and back are going to add up…
Steve feels his cheeks heat with pleasure. He think’s back to Tony’s monologue about what he wants, and his flush deepens. Tony wants him to...
Bruce tries to transform but he can't.
Yeah, that sounds reasonable. Steve can handle that, picking from options. Tony makes everything easy.
“That’s right, beg. As soon as I’m back in your mouth, you’re allowed to use my leg to come. You can use the other one since this one is already wet okay?” He motions to his left leg, where the pant material is damp and dark, smeared with the evidence of Steve’s arousal.
“Okay you just said a few things that are
Steve finds a stronger hold under his ass while supporting his full weight and slowly lifts him up again, then back down. He repeats that motion over and over, adjusting the angle slightly each time. When he gets to an angle that rakes across Tony’s prostate, he can’t help but mewl.
Though seriously, “Not boyfriend material”? He realizes he probably has blinders on at this point, but he literally can’t see one thing about Steve that
By the end of Morgan’s first year of life, Steve is feeling the pangs of being away from her and Tony so often. After Thanos Clint left the team and Scott went down to occasional/part time participation, with the caveat that if another Thanos-level event happens they’ll be there. Steve doesn’t want to leave the team without a leader, but he longs to follow their lead and spend more than two days in a row out at the lake house with his family.
Tony calls Rhodey, Steve keeps his clothes on this time.
Everyone pauses bringing their forks back to their plates instead of to their mouths (except Vision, who ate a couple of bites at the start, but doesn’t seem to need to eat a whole meal).
He sits calmly on the edge of the bed to wait. He’s ready.
Steve looks at Tony, whose hand is still holding Steve’s hair. His cock is just a few inches from Steve’s mouth.
It’s happened over and over tonight. The realization that Tony hasn’t felt truly happy, hopeful, relaxed, safe, in such a long time. Because he’s feeling those things now, and they feel new and foreign.
Steve rolls his eyes. He tries not to hound Tony, but he really
In response to his words Tony can feel a spurt of precum leak out of Steve's ever-hardening cock against his belly.
He notices Steve is awake and moves immediately to put the pad aside. He sets it on the bedside table, next to… oh.
“Thanks Steve, it’s great to hear that you regret nothing and that you’re right, as always. Good talk.” Tony begins to turn away.
And Steve wants to be the one to give that to him.
Tony stands so he can get a better look at Steve’s face as he talks.
Tony just allows himself to zone out for a minute, resting his head on Steve’s chest, running his hands down his back as he listens to the steady beat of his heart. Of course, Steve’s heart rate has already normalized. Tony’s is still rabbiting all over the place. Jesus, what just happened?
"Strange? Did you see how to resolve all that in one of your time jumps?"
“That’s right blueberry,” says Tony, “You’re not going to have to live with that anymore.”
“Time for the lower half” he winks.
Tony shrugs, but Steve’s blush deepens about three shades.
of a few things. One, you broke up with me. You decided that you couldn’t be a part of my life in that way anymore. So while I still love and respect you as a friend, you don’t really get a say in this. Like,
“Okay, so don’t be mad! Part of X-Con Security Consultants’ services is to basically break in, that is, test the client’s space as if we were really breaking in. I call it, a
“Actually… I may… already have known. About the two of you.” Scott scrunches up his face like it physically pains him to say it.
Tony calls the rest of the nanites back.
No, Tony doesn’t do things half-way. He wants realism. He wants medical equipment. He wants terrible fluorescent lighting and the smell of antiseptic. Well, maybe not the terrible lighting. Even with Steve’s magic DNA flowing through him, nobody looks good under that shit.
Steve moves forward looking panicked. “Did she… did she hear what I yelled out?”
Tony mutters a command that sounds like “Activate Blue 3” and the walls shift. Two handholds/bars emerge and a small platform about a meter square raises in the center of the shower up against the longest wall beneath them. The platform looks like a mini-stage, only 6 inches higher than the rest of the shower floor. Two waist-height columns also slide out of the walls on either side of the platform to reveal two sets of shelves. Steve glances over the shelves to see they are stocked with sponges, washcloths, soaps, little tubes and creams and… and in the bottom shelf of each column there’s a basket which appears to be full of a variety of
Tony can’t keep a bemused smile off his face. All the righteous rage he was holding onto so tightly a few minutes ago has burned away, and all that’s left is a small warm ember that feels terrifyingly like hope.
He’s got his fake smile on, trying to deflect. Feeling awkward and embarrassed.
, Steve.” Tony is breathing harshly, seemingly struggling to speak around his own rage. “You may not have noticed since you ran away, but everything, and I mean everything is
“You there, call 9-1-1, my comms system is down and this man needs an ambulance.”
“I just… uh, that feels good, it’s just that doing this with someone requires either a lot of carelessness or a lot of trust. I got smarter, more careful, and I didn’t trust anyone enough, so I just didn’t.”
Pepper returns his look and nods one more time. Okay.
“Steve, I have one more question.”
“I wanted to be ready for you.” Tony murmurs into Steve’s chest.
“Squidward” flys away with Dr. Strange, but Tony is able to snag Steve once the building is stable and fly him up to the now airborne donut.
Tony looks like he’s about to say something, but instead sways forward and almost crashes to the floor. Steve catches him mid-drop, slowly easing him to the ground.
He has no idea what Tony has pushed in his schedule to have this time with Steve uninterrupted. Earlier that day he caught the end of Tony on a call that sounded like it was with Pepper. Tony said something about rescheduling things for next week, and Steve hadn’t wanted to break the spell by asking what he was causing Tony to miss.
“The truth is Tony… the truth is that I don’t regret saving Bucky. And I don’t think I was wrong about the accords… but I’m sorry-”
“What?” Steve asks, somewhere between bemused and thoughtful.
He pushes it down. He’s been pushing it down since well before the end with Pepper. Right now Steve is the only person he has that he even remotely wants to be around. Tony isn’t going to mess that up by pursuing something that is so far from possible that even
“Uh, hmm, just come Steve. I want you to."
Tony seems unaware he is doing anything differently; it’s Peter that calls attention to it one evening.
Where is Scott? Idk, probably off somewhere putting the finishing touches on his security assessment. Or on a video call with Cassie. The point is he wasn't needed for this scene haha...
“Wha? I thought you said we weren’t using those?” Tony doesn’t mind, but he was looking forward to getting to the "cock up his ass" portion of the proceedings.
He knows Nat would have reported a “Tony Stark – No, not recommended” for Steve.
The problem is that he can’t remember the last time he laughed with Tony, and it’s killing him. So Steve starts writing Tony again.
Scott whistles as the last of the course elements arrange themselves.
His shoulders tense at their old dynamic (which is somehow happening after ten words between him and the air around the elevator). This thing has always existed between them, where Tony seems to assume Steve is a self-righteous relic, and Steve jumps to Tony being too impulsive and self-interested. And they’re not wrong. But they’re not right, either. And getting stuck in those expectations is what got them here in the first place.
in anyone's personal space, just let Friday know. She’ll get it on our calendars and we can give you the compound for an hour or two.”
The next day he texts it to Tony.
Steve busts out laughing, doubling over on the sofa.
Steve is still inside him, holding absolutely still. Tony isn’t sure if their doctor-patient relationship is done for now that they’ve both come, or if it's on pause, or still in full effect. He’s feeling too loopy and good from coming to make any decisions and decides to leave it up to Steve.
“Tough crowd.” says Sam.
Steve just wants to stay there quietly enjoying the warm cocoon of a bed, lazing with Tony in their own little world. But instead he sighs and says, “We probably need to talk about the team, the accords… next steps.”
Steve wakes up.
God, he is so in love with him.
Tony isn’t wild about using physical force this way, not when Steve is obviously panicked, but he needs him to listen. It has the intended effect at least. Steve quiets and slumps against the wall, attention on Tony.
They languidly trade blowjobs and settle in to go to sleep. Tomorrow Nebula and Bucky are coming over to test out a new shield/force field Tony has been working on.
“Tony –”
Fear grips Tony at the base of his spine. He’s been with Steve in the field a ton of times since they got together. There have been times before where Steve took a hit that looked bad, but it all worked out. It’s going to work out.
Remarkably, Steve feels better. Until now he hasn’t handled things well, but he can move forward and do better.
Steve doesn’t know whether to laugh or cry.
Steve and Tony shower.
Steve kisses him again sweetly saying “I trust you, too” before moving back to his previous position. He grabs another gold tube and empties it over Tony and his fingers before adding the third finger. Tony groans, raising his arms above his head and holding them there. Steve takes him in, imagining that something is holding his arms there, maybe his shield… Fuck.
Pepper looks pained by his last admission. Fuck, Tony doesn’t want to hurt her.
He should leave, this is officially peeping. There goes Tony's shirt. Huh, yeah, yep, this is...
But Steve has to pause. He’s seeing stars.
Steve’s face gets that’s soft look it gets only around Tony. “The more I think about it, this “treatment” is a gift. You're healthy, and aging slower. We’ll be able to grow old together.”
Steve blushes.
“Hi Mr. Stark, I’m Dr. Rogers, how are you today?” Steve asks.
LASS-E makes a cute grunting noise, and the metal polymer that covers her form changes from primarily silver-white (with blue feet and a red nose) to a vibrant green color.
And that is how Rocket, Thor, Steve and Tony ended up on the universe’s weirdest double-date.
He sits closer to him, kisses him more. Just pecks on the lips, but any time they meet up or part, Tony kisses him in greeting. At first Steve is a little bashful about it. He can’t help the small tick of fear he gets being so… open. Even if it is just around their teammates.
Tony groans as the absolutely incredible amount of cum inside him begins to slide out. He shifts on the table and rushes to reassure Steve. “Steve, you know how I am, yes it just came out. I’ve been thinking about it… lately. But I didn’t want to freak you out. We haven’t even been together a year. A year and a half ago we were beating the shit out of each other in Sibera. I don’t want to… I don’t want to rush this or do anything you aren’t ready for.”
And they do.
Oh. All he can taste is orange, and maybe some mint? It doesn’t taste like soap at all.
“What, haha?” says Scott, tight smile plastered to his face. “That’s … what are you? You’re so …”
Tony reaches out and touches Pepper’s hand briefly across the table. Just a quick acknowledgment. A thank you.
Pepper finds out.
“Will do.”
Scotts ears are ringing. Luis is going to
He paces as he watches Steve on the floating viewscreen Friday’s thrown up for him. Steve’s head drops in resignation as the months-old password he tries at the entrance doesn’t work.
Tony tries to slam himself back against Steve as a non-verbal signal that no indeed he does not need a minute. But true to his word, Steve is holding his hips, and all Tony can do is squirm in place as his movements are totally restricted. “I’m good, I’m good” he says.
“Right away sir. May I also suggest the calming jets? You seem rather tense after-”
“Okay,
But Rhodes is just smiling, looking at Tony who is beaming back, puffing his chest out a bit as if to silently brag to his friend “Captain America kissed me!”
Tony takes some time cleaning himself. He showered before Steve arrived, but definitely didn’t do the kind of cleaning required for having a cock up his ass.
Instead he hooked his arms around the brides’ shoulders and smiled his best smile.
“Hmm, it’s been a while since I gave you a hand-job. There always seems to be so much else to do… but this is nice, I get to really watch you.”
On impulse Tony raises his glass. “To coming home.”
Steve scoots up with him, straddling his thighs, taking in the picture of Tony spread out, arms up.
Avengers Go Gay
(See the end of the chapter for
“No it’s, that feels good actually.” Tony says.
Tony’s eyes dart up and narrow as he continues to tap on the pad “Um, who had you watch Star Trek? Did they even show you The Original Series?? Oh my god Steve, promise me you won’t watch any more sci-fi until I can be there to properly supervise.”
Tony for his part seems… confused. Which is better than enraged. Steve breaths deep and draws up the courage to look at Tony. Steve places his palms loosely on his thighs and sits back on his heels, beginning again.
"Show me how good you can be.”
Steve notices and laughs a little desperately, head thunking back against the cool stone tile.
He turns to Tony, “Tony, since Rhodes is your friend first, I think you should take the lead. I mean… maybe I don’t even need to be on camera?”
Steve works to make his dream a reality.
Tony’s machines are like family. Obviously DUM-E is bit of a block-head, and JARVIS loves to sass everyone, but… they’re the best things he’s ever done (he secretly includes the Iron Man armor in this sentiment, though in any interview he gives it’s always his superhero alter-ego that gets the lip service).
“As deep as you can now, but don’t rush. Work up to it slowly, be sure to relax your throat and breathe. Take your time Steve."
Some ideas I have floating around in my head:
doesn’t think it’s possible.
Suddenly he knows he can’t in good conscience spend another day with Tony in the Penthouse. The team needs him.
This chapter roughly brought us through Infinity War, the next will cover Endgame, sort of.
He gets to ride Steve’s motorcycle and go to the zoo and have the most perfect day he's had since everything blew apart with Pepper.
“Sir is in the lab with Dr. Banner." There is a brief pause before the AI continues "I have been contacted by Director Fury and Agent Romanov requesting that you return to SHEILD to complete your debriefing…” there’s a very slight upturn in tone at the end, as if JARVIS is asking a question.
From inside the orb Scott is able to see that the button is connected to what looks like a mini explosive device. He disconnects the circuit and returns to normal size on the ground.
Tony swallows. “How many did we win?”
Steve and the others are officially pardoned through the approval of the “Sokovia Accords II,” about one month after Steve’s surprise visit to (what was formerly) Stark Tower. Tony
He remembers something Rhodey said on their call earlier. “Tony, did you really have Captain America sheets in college?”
After marking something on the clipboard with his pen, Steve comes over and begins touching Tony’s neck, feeling his lymph nodes. Then takes his wrist and measures his pulse. Tony feels his face get hot. The touches aren’t sexual at all, but that’s what seems to be setting him off. The taboo of getting aroused in a medical environment, the fact that he can, and it’s Steve here with him. Tony shifts on the table and the paper crinkles loudly.
have used a considerable amount of money to slice through the red tape that normally delays such swift governmental action.
<<One new voicemail>>
“What I’m saying is, at this point in my life I would like to have a child, and when I think of who the perfect person is to do that with… it’s Tony.”
He probably won’t get another opportunity, and he’ll be damned if he ever misses a chance at something this real again.
“That’s option one. But Steve, the thing is, there’s another part of you I haven’t cleaned yet.”
Instead of responding to Steve’s confession Bruce asks another question. “Do you know the thing Tony talks about the most when we’re working in the labs, apart from actual science?”
Tony >> Welcome to the super-family, kid
that Tony would put his mouth… there. His cheeks clench at the idea. It feels incredibly taboo, like something so foreign his brain doesn’t even have the ability to process it. Tony wants to stick his tongue in his ass.
Tony interrupts. “Look I – I’m really sorry, I know this is a shock. Let’s… let’s get something on the calendar next week okay, lunch, in person. I’ll fly to you.”
Steve looks like he’s digesting everything Tony has said.
Steve’s shoulders relax slightly at the pet name. “How is
Tony’s mouth is watering as he smooths a new soap on his favorite loofa. It’s got little gel beads running throughout it every half inch or so. The gel is slightly cool to the touch in the warmth of the shower and the gel bumps provide a unique massaging sensation when applied with the right pressure.
It’s not like when he’s fucking Tony. Without the pressure on his own cock, he’s able to slide into a wonderful haze of pleasure that’s incredible, but doesn’t make him feel like he has to come.
“Please.” He says again, louder this time, sounding exactly as broken as he feels. His cheeks burn and everything in him tries to reject this feeling. The feeling he’s fought against his whole life.
It got them here though, so it seems pretty right.
Tony is floored. Steve has just laid out exactly what he’s been wanting to hear all this time. Is he dreaming? Well no, if this were a dream he probably would’ve left out the horrifying trip down holocaust memory lane… but, yeah, wow.
Wanda says “Is Star Wars the one with the light-swords and the big bear with the belt on his chest?”
Almost echoing Tony’s same thought, Steve says “I don’t know what I’m going to do; how am I ever going to lead a meeting again? I get hard at the drop of a hat around you.” He snuggles into Tony to punctuate his words with affection.
"Hear me, and rejoice... you are about to die at the hands of the children of Thanos. Be thankfu-"
This thing keeps growing and growing haha. I thought it would be 4 chapters but now it's probably at least 6. Thanks to everyone who is taking the time to read!
Even with the most advanced medical tech on the planet, he ends up losing the arm.
So far they look unimpressed
And how he flew to Japan to support Tony when every other person on the planet thought Tony was being an irresponsible ass (himself included).
But… Steve always has to
He maneuvers back to Tony but straddles him the opposite way facing away from him, so that his ass is on display, hovering over Tony’s stomach.
He considers Tony before adding, “Jarvis cared for you very deeply; as deeply as was possible given his constraints.”
Almost immediately Thanos gets a few amazing shots off, one of which sends Steve flying (later he would reflect that if Tony hadn't gotten him his shield, he most likely wouldn't have been able to withstand the blow).
“Steve, wait…”
Steve nods, before saying “Yeah, um, I’ve been with a couple of women but not… back then it wasn’t something you could be open about, and then, I like women too so it just seemed easier…”
“What do you need, Steve?”
in my suite.” Tony wiggles his eyebrows and grabs Steve's hand. He starts to pull him away down the hall.
“Please.” It’s quiet but comes through the sound system clearly.
Below you’ll find a “What if” that follows them to Hawaii and does not follow cannon for “1796 Broadway” where they confess their feelings and then are called back before they can go/cuddle. I repeat, in this fic they have not told each other how they feel, and Steve and Tony are still dancing around their feelings. Cap feels Tony isn’t in the right place to hear it, and Tony thinks there isn’t a chance in hell Steve returns his feelings.
Damn it. Tony has been staring blankly at the screen lost in thought. He addresses Friday and refocuses on the floating display. “Ask him why he’s here.”
Next up we see the impact of the reunification on the events of Infinity War/Endgame and beyond (hint, Thanos gets his ass handed to him, and ~almost~ everyone gets a happy ending).
Last, he takes a quick tour of the personal spaces. It’s not super in his comfort-zone to spy on everyone, but needs to be thorough.
When this continues as a series I'll probably post once a week on Saturday or Sunday 🙂
Scott is realizing that Aunt and Ant sound the same, and it’s not getting any clearer what he’s trying to say.
It doesn’t feel as weird as it used to. Before Iron Man, trying to do the right thing was like having a monkey strapped to his back. It was always someone else pulling him in the opposite direction. Pepper wanted him to attend a charity gala, Obie needed him to get those new designs in or the company wouldn’t be giving out Christmas bonuses. Rhodey tried to convince him not to fly to Tijuana on Cinco de Mayo with a bunch of strippers who were just as drunk as he was… well, maybe he didn’t do the “right” thing on that one.
was a good idea, in every single infinite reality, Tony’s answer would be an immediate yes. Tony irrevocably put his trust in him the first time they met. Gave him a home, and a friend, and asked for nothing.
He has just what he wants.
“They look the same.” says Steve.
Steve is conflicted.
Steve settles over him, resting as much of his weight onto Tony as he thinks he can take. Tony’s softened cock is still inside him. It feels incredibly intimate.
As much as he loves the way that looks, Steve thinks it’s probably been long enough.
Steve nods, this is good, they have a plan.
Hooray, this story is closing in on 100 Kudos which was a little goal I made for myself (well actually my initial goal was 10 haha)! Thanks for reading everyone, I think there are two chapters to go and maybe an epilogue.
When he pulls back, Steve starts, “Tony?”
“Tony, that’s about the least surprising thing you’ve ever said to me,” Rhodey chuckles. “But I’m happy for you. Both of you.”
Tony snorts a laugh and then cries out as Steve spears into him with his tongue.
“It’s because you insist on referencing Terran culture every other word. Which by the way, is one of the most boring cultures. Lower than the Sovereign, and they’re just a bunch of plastic with a coat of gold paint!" Rocket tosses the wrench into the drawer he threw the wires. "See, see how you could understand that because I didn’t stop at “The Sovereign”?
When Steve starts breathing harshly through his mouth Tony rinses him thoroughly with an adjacent spray stream, letting the water jet linger for a moment directly on Steve’s tight exposed opening.
As they finally pull up to the main house Tony slips the driver a few hundreds and says they don’t need help with the bags. There are only five, and even though the car service is top of the line, he doesn’t want a stranger going inside.
“Tony, just stop, we’re in the shade now, okay? Stop pushing!” Steve is practically yelling now because Tony will not get out of his personal space, and is now tugging at his left foot to try and see if it is burned.
Tony refocuses and starts again.
Steve can’t wait anymore. He’s been so entirely focused on Tony’s pleasure and comfort that he has  been ignoring his own arousal, almost unaware of it. But now that he’s spreading the lube over himself he realizes how close he is, how much everything has been affecting him. He’s so turned on he doesn’t know if he’ll be able to last more than a few strokes.
“Shit, no Steve, Stevie, I just mean this wasn’t the time! Dr. Rogers is maybe the hottest thing that’s ever happened to me, and it melted my brain and it just slipped out.” Tony grabs Steve’s shoulders before pawing somewhat pathetically at his chest. He’s fucking this up. Tony continues, “But I meant it. Of course I meant it. I’d have to be an idiot to not want to lock you down!”
He looks over the texts and they are all some variation on “just checking in, let me know what's up when you can.”
Tony and Steve are in the middle of “post-mission we’re alive” sex when Bruce calls. It’s Tony’s third-favorite kind of Steve sex, after Shower Sex and Steve-Takes-Control Sex… more often than not they have Steve drive things since he’s still pretty skittish that he might hurt Tony accidentally. He’s never come close, and Tony assures him there’s no need to be so concerned, but Steve persists. Tony has been toying around with fucking Steve in the armor, that way Steve can let go and the strength differential would be more even…
“Yes Tony, I’m listening.”
Steve knows this should be the breaking point. Going to Hawaii with Tony is pretty much crossing a line. Hawaii is romantic, and they’ve spent so much time skirting the issue already.
And they have been taking things slow, especially with the physical stuff, which Steve feels so completely out of his depth with. But it’s been harder and harder to go slow the more they do, and Steve is finally starting to understand how all those girls would just fall into bed with Bucky. It gets… easy.
Each individual piece I write will have the explanation above, and a summary of what entry from “1796 Broadway” it is based on in the Notes section. I highly recommend you read “1796 Broadway,” even if epistolary isn’t something you usually go for (and also it will make what I write make much more sense, haha)!
Wanda shushes him and their happy chatter fades away as Tony and Steve head back to the suite, hand in hand.
Steve is flushed and his pupils are dilatated in that way he gets before he does something crazy and brave.
Right.
Although he’s never had any issues, he is slightly wary that he might not be able to get going, given the circumstances.
And the whole "difficult to be around" thing… being compared to a mangy cat doesn’t exactly inspire confidence, but somehow Steve made it sound okay.
Suddenly having a naked Steve here in front of him makes Tony relax and get things into perspective. “Hey, hey, come on Captain Beautiful, we’re alright.”
He slides forward, allowing the majority of Tony’s length to slide out of him before sliding back in a single controlled movement.  Tony can’t do much with his hands pinned above him and Steve’s weight on top of him. He just has to lay back. Let Steve take care of him, like he said.
It’s not fair of him to take that step if he isn’t sure, no matter how much Becky assures them they are taking things slow and “keeping it casual.”
He rips his eyes away and  turns his faithful steed back toward the vent he entered through.
Steve clears his throat. “How are you feeling?” he asks.
Bruce is back in science mode. “So you’ve been together almost… eight months? I think I’ll need to run some more tests. And… I may need to ask some pretty personal questions about your sexual activity.”
Dr. Strange lures him in, they discuss the Titan that was. Thanos' home world. The genesis of his whole mad plan, to wipe out half the universe.
“Bruce, Tony isn’t doing this, so what could be? What do these blood results mean?” asks Steve.
Steve can feel his throat tighten. He’s sure Tony is about to tell him they don’t want the same things. That Tony was just going along with what Steve wanted. That Steve somehow messed this up. That he doesn’t know what he’s doing. That Steve isn’t right for him. This was a mistake. He didn’t really want Steve after all... If that’s what’s happening, he doesn’t know what to do. Steve wildly wishes he could just be frozen again to escape this moment.
Tony manages to get one foot up, and before Steve can stop him he is pulling it towards himself causing Steve to fall forward onto the cool sand in the shadow of the house.
Bruce looks troubled, and pulls up another couple of screens. “Here is my blood sample, and Steve’s.”
Steve rubs the back of his neck and looks like he’s about to sink into the lab’s floor from embarrassment.
Steve trails off looking awkward.
Steve looks up at Tony with a gentle smile. “That’s understandable, but I assure you the procedure is almost completely pain-free. I’ll be performing it here in the office, and it shouldn’t take more than a couple of hours.”
Nothing compares to this. This incredible heat, the knowledge that he’s inside Tony, filling him, taking him for his own. He lets out a desperate noise.
Tony watches him wait until it looks like he’s about to leave.
“Steve, I want to figure this out with you. And we are
Tony relaxes into it and let’s his mind drift. They do this sometimes, Steve fucking him while he’s soft. Steve gets hard and stays hard more than any normal person would or could. Sometimes he comes in Tony two or three times before Tony does once, but sometimes Tony doesn’t wait and lays back spent and saited while Steve continues to take him. As long as he isn’t sore or over-sensitive it’s nice, like he’s giving himself over to Steve completely.
