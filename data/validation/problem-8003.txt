He smiled ever so slightly as Bucky reached out for a handshake which turned into an eventual awkward half-sitting-half-standing hug, patting each other on the back firmly. They didn’t often hug, but it wasn’t foreign to them, at this point, they were more like family than friends.
Bucky stopped by Tony’s apartment, he wanted to see the text for himself, the only reason that Tony let him is because he was the only person who wasn’t bringing the pity party along with him, as he felt Steve’s disappearance as much as he did.
“You… You wouldn’t be able to make out there on your own, that’s all.” Crossing his arms in response to Steve shoving his hands into his pockets.
He prayed as he deftly snuck into the van. It was a mess inside, dead bugs on the counters and what Steve thought was a gram of coke under the cash register. Never mind that, he grabbed about six pretzels off of a ring and shoved them in a bag, more thrilled than he should be.
When he got up in the morning, flickers of light shining through the blinds between both of their beds, Bucky was already awake, sitting at his desk with a bowl of cereal, scrolling mindlessly on his phone.
“I’m just messin’ with you Picasso.” He snorted, and Steve couldn’t tell whether he was just laughing or whether he was laughing at him, he felt offended and intrigued all at once.
“I hate that. I hate you.” Steve attempted to stutter back a response but was cut off by Tony’s hands waving in front of him, the sharpness in his fingers on the top of his tongue. “I hate that you do this to me. I hate tha- that you can just…”
“Yeah, it’s only you, cause apparently you’re like a Greek god or something.”
“Ah, alright. Here, take these. I dunno if we’re gonna be able to eat em all.” Tony handed him the bag of pretzels before he could get back any complaints. “And don’t think about putting it in your little book thingy because we stole them from Brian.”
The boy knelt beside him perked up, a quaint twitch in the corner of his mouth, “I won at not being an alcoholic?”
He thought about how Tony reacted, and wondered whether his grin as he shouted along with Natasha and thrashed on the drums was just a façade like the last time he’d heard some news. Had he ruined it? Had his attempt to keep moving forward into the future been a fatal mistake, was this all for nothing?
Objectively, Tony had very small feet, compared to his at least. and then Ty bit his toe, so he looked away.
He put it down, and Bucky laughed.
But just as he expected, the party was a disaster.
A guttural groan escaped Steve followed by a hand on his brow. “Please,
, but this was uncharted territory. Like seriously, there’s so much freaking porn but sometimes it requires a certain level of specificity to actually get you going. Otherwise you just end up thinking about how that woman’s surgery made her nipples look weird and wondering how they got in that position, or that this mom who’s supposedly fucking her stepson looks about 20 years old.
“Tony, you are the most… Amazingly fantastical person I’ve ever met. Definitely the smartest. It’s not that you’re a guy or… It’s just you. I just think you’re…” He couldn’t think of the most appropriate word to use, and one accidentally spilled out of his mouth. “Neat.”
“Wouldn’t be a fair game.” Steve teased so he could purposefully watch the heat in Tony’s cheeks.
“Gah.” Tony groaned, pulling away, contorting his entire body away from Steve. “God, I’m sorry.
Tony smiled crookedly, eyes following Ty as he stood up, observing his movements across the room as he left in a muddle with the others.
So Steve thought, he could play this game too.
“Did I do something wrong?”
Tony spun around, and allowed himself to fall onto the couch next to Steve, his arm and his thighs bumbling against his, and looking at him with a wide smile. Steve wondered what he was smiling at, half of him thought Tony was probably just taking pity on him, or making fun of him, but he was awfully close, too close, there was a lot of couch left.
“Take it for me now?”
He nodded in agreement.
“Seems like you got a lot of secrets lately.” Said Bucky through a half-smile, pulling the chair away from his desk across from Steve and sitting in it haphazardly.
Tony didn’t respond.
“Do you actually want me to answer that?”
to tell you this time? Some things are better left unsaid as they say…” As though Tony was speaking to himself rather than Steve, rationalising every factor and piece of information out loud as if there was too much going on in his head for it all to fit. “Okay. Fine. I think… That may be an alright idea.”
“Thank you.” Steve choked out, his expression stoic as he wished for Tony to pull his hand away. When he did, it was graceful, delicate, despite his palms being covered in blisters and his fingers full of bruises.
“I have to ask, why did you bring me here?”
They leapt apart, looking towards the sudden presence of another voice in the room. Ty stood in the bedroom doorway, rubbing one of his eyes.
“Hi. I brought Vodka.” Steve said, without thinking, removing the bottle from the crook of his arm and presenting it to Tony, who just looked at it with a crooked smile. He didn’t know what else to get, people brought alcohol to parties right? It was just common courtesy.
“I would’ve thought you’d be down there, you know, having fun?”
Just as he suspected, he couldn’t see anyone inside, the TV was on a music channel, playing the classics, Frankie Valli and Louie Armstrong (he approved), he made a mental note to turn it off as he left, heading straight for the bedroom as not to waste any time. He grabbed the velvet box, and although he was tempted to peek inside, he didn’t.
“That’s not your job, Mr Rogers, but I appreciate the sentiment. And, it is very egotistical to assume that
“Yeah - um, why are we doing this?”
“Fucking prick.” Sighing in agitation, running a hand up through her hair like she wanted to pull it. Was it really that common that Ty did this? Or that him and Tony were just constantly swinging up and down, back and forth and nobody could stop it? “I’m gonna talk to Rhodey. And then I’ll find Tony. For now just... stay out of it.”
Tony interrupted his own outro on his set, and before Steve was given the chance to applaud or cheer or shout he was pulled forward, Tony’s arms thrown over his shoulders, drumsticks still in his hands and tapping the back of Steve’s head as Tony hit him with a hard kiss.
“Why?” He said aloud, followed by a blush.
They all parted for Tony as he stormed through them as if they were scared they’d all set alight.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Steves idea.” Tony smirked. It was difficult to see the man on the ground, sat far away from any store or streetlamp, Tony seemed comfortable anyway in the dark.
When he finally caught up to him, Tony bent over and shallow against a tall wired fence, hunched over and gasping for air, he was met with the greatest surprise and greatest reward he could have wanted, Tonys acknowledgment. Even if it was just him straightening his back and staring Steve in the eye, questioning and confused, glistening in a worried
“Do you wanna know about the night I bumped into Ty again?”
The strangest sensation in the world had to be going into a different room during a party. Maybe it was just him, but the way the music faded out like the speakers were flooded and the people changed and atmosphere was just completely disjointed from the main setting was always unnerving.
“You really think he consciously does that? That’s… that’s twisted.” Yet not totally surprising.
Tony didn’t respond, only turned back to the cold hard floor.
“Yeah, yeah just had a mo-“
Bucky nodded, closing his book, and dropping his pen. “Yeah. I know when to be weird and when… not to be weird.”
Steve glanced at the sketchbook on his own desk, he had a free period in he was going to use to draw, maybe sit outside the library. There was a quiet spot tucked in a corner under a shallow tree and he would try and get there before some drunk/high couples got there first and started fingering each other. Which was surprisingly normal on campus.
“Maybe, but atleast you’re smiling and you ain’t got black lines all down your face.” Steve smiled back, gesturing to Tonys eyes.
“I love you too.” He replied, and he knew that he wasn’t surer about anything.
“That’s fair. There’s nothing for anyone in this place.”
He wouldn’t give Ty (or
“No. Who cares?”
And then he rushed out of the door, into the night. He leant against the wall outside the bar, breathing hot air out into the cold evening, flowers clutched in his fist.
“Do you ever get nervous?” Steve leant over to ask, and Tony almost jumped, not in surprise, rather, offense.
Long story short, Steve wasn’t getting his oscar nom any time soon.
He sat beside her, the bed sinking ever so slightly beneath his weight. Her sombre voice carried the weight of everything Steve felt too.
cool.”
“Uh, Steve. Nice to meet you, show was good.”  He was never very good at talking to girls.
“Are you sure? So we’re –“ Clearing his throat – “- We’re good?”
“My ex girlfriend. Her name is Sharon. She’s nice, more than nice, I guess, it just didn’t work out...”
What would he find, though, if he carried on following in Tony’s path, his already distant shadow flickering through the trees? Another broken down and destructive boy like the night he chased Tony down the street? Another night fuelled with rage at Tony’s awful excuse for a partner, sure.
Steve bit his lip and leaned closer to Tony. “…Do you want to be?”
, and Steve wondered why it mattered.
“Okay, it’s not a big deal.”
“Everyone seems to know you, Tony. But I don’t feel like I do, I don’t even know why you invited me here.”
“What is
Tony laughed as he took a drag of his cigarette, Steve enjoyed how his lips formed around it. “I don’t know. How famous can a shitty college band be?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, first of all, trying to understand Tony in general will get you nowhere. And, over the past year or so, seeing the way they treat each other, I have come up with a theory of my own.”
The relative guilt had quickly changed to panic as the lock began clicking again inside, knowing they’d be caught snooping and invading their friends privacy.
He tried to write. Firstly, a poem, because poems are the height of romance, right? On paper, too, so it would seem more genuine and thoughtful (plus he didn’t want to run the risk of Bucky opening a stupid love poem on his laptop). Turns out he was terrible, awful, in fact. Then he tried to write him a song, it made sense, Tony was into music, it was perfect. And as it turned out, writing song lyrics is much easier than poetry, you could use the same words over and over again, you didn’t have to worry about every minute period mark or paragraph.
Tony smirked at his hesitation. Staring into him until he gave in all the while Steve was trying his hardest not to grab Tony and kiss him again. The night in Steve’s dorm, Tony was… insecure. If Steve didn’t know everything about what that was like he would wonder why, because looking at him, his toned chest, the lightening scar that ran down the middle of it, even the way his stomach ever so slightly pudged… He was perfect.
“Um.”
He found Bucky, Clint, Thor and Bruce at the opposite end of the ‘stage’, because he had no need to be alone at the back of the bar sketching to avoid looking awkward anymore. They drunkenly welcomed him into the huddle with open arms, Thor was banging his head to the music, already way past the limit – his golden hair swinging around. No matter how much Steve tried to express his ‘alternative’ side he’d probably never be able to do that. But he’d be lying if he didn’t let his body move a little to the music, he doubted anybody was watching him.
Steve kissed him, to let him know that it was okay. And even Tony could ignore the jokey grossed out noises from his friends as he looked back up at him with a sparkle of yellow and orange in his eye.
“You know she probably did that because of you.” Steve grinned playfully as Tony took her seat opposite him.
Tony seemed slightly bitter that Steve had made that observation.
Tony spoke like it was all a game, even if his eyes told a different story.
“Why Bucky?”
“Nobodies ever brought me flowers before.” Tony spoke out of the personal silence.
“I don’t get it.” Bucky harrowed over Tony’s phone, looking back and forth at the text just like Tony had.
“Didn’t realise we had room for the entire football team now.” Ty said in a passive aggressive tone, looking at Nat as he said it.
“Yeah.” Tony huffed like that was obvious.
Who wouldn’t? Tony couldn’t think of anyone who’d want to spend an isolated pro-longed time with him.
ashamed.
He had the song ready, on his phone, he’d had it ready and waited for Steve to say yes and put his ear bud in and face him and lay with him – it made him feel guilty, that he had never expected Tony to be so subtly thoughtful even though he witnessed it all the night before. But, before he pressed play, there was one last step. His finger held up to Steve’s ear. The edge of his middle finger rubbed against the lobe, as his index nestled the earphone into a more comfortable and secure angle.
“I think he’d be good for her.” Tony was different, that night, gentler, quieter. Tony didn’t often keep his thoughts to himself, often stating them as fact, undoubtable – but he seemed to talk as though he didn’t want Steve or anyone to believe what he was saying, in a way that he could be talking to himself,  not needing to impress anyone. Steve found himself looking at him rather than the couple in question.
Bucky had been out a lot recently, too, not always telling Steve where, not that he had too, but still, his room and his phone felt emptier and emptier. Maybe Natasha had told him what happened, maybe he just decided he didn’t want to be around him anymore, which at this point, wouldn’t be surprising. Recently, people around him had a tendency of leaving.
Also, when he imagined Tony in his bed, Bucky wasn’t there in the other bed, drunkenly snoring into a lock of his own hair and soaking it in drool, and Tony wasn’t constantly checking his phone all night presumably for messages from Ty, the amount of sweat was somewhat accurate though.
He started with his sweater, and then realised he should have probably started with his shoes like Tony did, removing his socks at the same time because he did not have the advantage of a smooth floor like Tony. Maybe a little too eagerly as Tony was watching did he remove his under t-shirt. There wasn’t really a sexy or alluring way to take off jeans, Tony somehow managed it, but he was Tony, Tony, who was looking back and forth rapidly at Steve shrugging the grey jeans off. Admittedly, he felt much less exposed as Tony was too, and glad he wore his good white Calvin’s that Sharon had bought him.
wasn’t worth his time.
“Listen and see.” Flinging the earbud directly onto the tip of Steve’s nose and giving him ever so slight whiplash, his tiredness didn’t make it any less unsatisfying, scrunching up his face and trying not to look too seriously back at Tony.
“Uh. Bedrooms over there. I’m gonna get a bucket.”
“You actually believed that?” Steve replied, asking it with as much concern as Bucky asked him.
“Right. Well.”
When he was with Sharon, she was so petite that when she stayed over it was like she was barely there in his arms anyway, and he’d gotten so used to her being there that eventually each night was the same, his fist curled in her hair or the palm of his hand held against the base of her neck. And then he’d gotten used to her not being there, and no one being there.
are the cause of this sudden change in temperament.” Throwing his cigarette into the fire, holding his palms up to the yellow flame after to replace the lack of heat at his fingers.
“Exactly. Are you religious, Steve?”
Not really, he didn’t actually faint, just pretended to. And very convincingly at that.
“Whatever… It was just a kiss, right?”
“What?” Steve asked, confused. “Where did you get that idea? And also, what?”
“Do you still think I’m interesting?” Steve called  after him.
“Hi Tony.” He repeated. “I’ve been busy…”
Brian knelt down beside Tony, as Steve stood back, beside him. The man lowered his ear to Tonys chest, pretending to know what he was doing, because if he did he wouldn’t have given him enough time to raise his head and start attempting to communicate with Steve.
“You know... Now that I know that, I don’t think you should smoke either.”
“If you say so. Why would your mom wanna play this with you? I’m guessing she made this up?”
. He got mad I didn’t let him in on the action and he fired me, threatened to call the cops and everything, took all my precious pretzels and sold them himself.”
Tony’s lips parted as if he were about to say something, but stopped himself. Like he was about to make a snide remark or sarcastic comment out of habit and realised it wasn’t the time.
This particular bar had been much less run down than the one he’d first met Tony in, there was a private lounge area in the back which admittedly was just a small room with some mis-matched couches and a coffee table but the atmosphere made it comforting.
Figuring he might have to spend the rest of the night looking for Tony, he was unfortunately pleasantly surprised to see him sat on the pavement against the wall of the bar, knees clutched to his chest and wielding a cigarette.
The opposite side read;
now so, this is what you signed up for.”
“Yeah I know.”
“Oh, well.” Tony began, resting his hand on top of Bucky’s bed post, leaning against it, like he was trying to stand his own ground, affirm himself in a comfortable position with enough distance away from Steve who stood awkwardly in the middle of the tiny bedroom. “I was in town, shopping, grabbing lunch and whatever, I broke up with Ty, saw a really adorable dog –“
“No.”
Steve had never stopped doing something so fast in his life. Spinning around towards the door as if he’d just been caught his hands don his pants although this was way,
His expression changed. His smile faded, his big dark eyes glossing over Steves face with his head tilted with a curious inquisition.
“Hey this is a judgement free zone!”
“Why you staring?” Tony said, bringing him back into reality.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about, but apparently I’m dumb now?”
“Oh.” Tony blinked, wide eyed up at Steve as he spun around. “Uh… hi there… Stranger.” His face was almost just as confused and pink as the last time he saw him, a black sweater crawling up his neck and curving around his collarbones, tight around the base of his neck. Steve had wished that when he next saw Tony, he would realise that he wasn’t as beautiful as he thought, unfortunately, that wouldn’t happen.
“I’m sorry.” Tony whispered, or what was probably his rendition of a whisper because he was never any good at being quiet on purpose.  The gentle tap on his shoulder triggered every nerve and all the blood in his body, Tony’s two fingers dancing on the blade of his back. He ignored him, which he felt bad for, but at least the cursed hard-on was going away, if only Tony would stop touching him.
Steve smiled at him, which led to a look of confusion on Tony’s face, so Steve kissed him, which only made his furrowed brow more severe. Only mere words could describe
Whipping his head back around to the wall when Tony rolled back. Poking him now on the ridge of his spine. “Well, now we know it does work, right?”
, you know? I think we were both just so focused on things that weren’t each other. It just wasn’t the right time. And that was part of your problem, you were  so focused on the past and trying to make things like they were that you didn’t think about what was happening in front of you. Me, I got too preoccupied with my studies, sometimes I think I should have let myself have more fun.” She sighed as if she had wanted to get that off of her chest for a while.
“She’s not your lady if you haven’t asked her out moron.”
For some reason, that wouldn’t surprise him.
“Okay. So, my mom used to do this to me when I was little. You said you wanted to know me more right? So for entire time we are like this, we have to tell each other secrets, like take turns. If you ask, I cant lie. If I ask, you can’t lie. But the rules don’t apply when we aren’t head to head. Make sense?”
Tony laughed, provoking Steve to tilt his head and squint in confusion.
They’d filled out the corner of the bar in a booth, which was uncomfortable and not like enough to seat everyone so they’d pulled over another small table and some chairs, Thor and Bruce were filled in (when Tony went to the bathroom) so it only turned into an even more awkward game of ‘Who's gonna talk first?’ when Ty walked over to the table.
“Come ooooon. Please. Pretty please?”
“Oh, yeah. Well I like it like this.”
. Honestly not how he thought he’d be spending his night, but really, it wasn’t like he had anything else in mind, being too busy worrying about a crowded house full of strangers and migraine producing music.
Before he even realised himself, he was folding clothes with a rhythm in his step like he was on his own personal stage. Hanging up shirts as he mouthed the words with a swing in his hips.
“No. For you, 10$.”
He grabbed Steves free hand, and laughed, and ran with him this time over.
Tony smiled, although his eyes weren’t convinced.
With each day it began to seem like he was wasting his time. It was obvious Tony made certain that he and Steve were never alone together. He acted like himself, as usual, like nothing had changed – arranged to go out for coffee with him, then last minute Rhodey or Natasha would suddenly decide that they were coming too. All of it left him wondering whether it was just him, that him and Tony weren’t really friends at all and he felt awkward around him. Maybe Tony felt guilty, or embarrassed even, that he hadn’t broken up with Ty who subjected everyone to subtle-not-subtle pictures of Tony’s arms or legs draped over him on Instagram.
“Me and Tony were just talking about uh… Him and Ty.” He cleared his throat, nervously. He could hear Tony shouting now, his voice was always serious when he did but he was almost always joking.
“Ahem.”
He stood up to greet Steve, and like Tony said, he was the only one there who was probably taller than him, hair flowing past his shoulders like those performers who grow their hair out so they can flip it back and forth on stage to metal music - maybe that was the intention, he didn’t know.
Steve scoffed, shaking his head. “So that’s what this is? You dragged me here so you could get laid? You think any girl that smiles at you for more than a couple seconds is into you, she was probably just trying to sell a couple more tickets to the show.”
The most prominent guest, at least to their inner circle, was Ty.
Every Woman.”
“Okay.”
There was a final swing, and white. Only white.
“Okay, Dad.” Tony groaned, smirking at him over his shoulder as Steve proceeded towards the door to get his shoes.
Everything he did was grand, like he could never afford a dull moment, barging out onto the roof, pushing both hands against the metal door and stepping out into the night like it was his own. Steve could honestly believe that all the stars and the fireflies belonged to him only.
But when he looked at her, into her glossy, mournful eyes he knew. He knew and understood.
He wondered if he was being creepy, he wasn’t too different to a fan really was he? Or a groupie? He wouldn’t mind being a groupie, maybe that would suit him. Probably not, not if it was like that Ty he met, he didn’t like him at all, something about him raised a bunch of red and blue and yellow flags for him.
“Oh what the heck.”
In the beginning, this was never possible. In the beginning, Tony was unreachable, godly, and yet he was here, allowing Steve to pull the sweater over his head and kiss every inch of his neck, to his chest. Kisses littering the trail down the path of Tony’s scar, past it all the way to his stomach.
He texted.
“So who’s the guy?” Bucky smiled, reassuringly, giving Steve’s shoulder a tough pat before he pulled away. Somehow it just made him feel worse, reminding him of everything once again.
Steve’s bed proved to be quite a squeeze.
“What?” Steve laughed, nudging Tony’s elbow.
The two of them spent the entire night on their sides, looking at one another, lying on Tony’s bed and talking about everything that they had spent months talking around, like it was them and them alone, floating in space on Tony’s queen-sized bed. A small strobe light lit the ceiling in red and blue and they kissed between sentences, smiling because they had no reason not to, intertwining delicate fingers because they didn’t need to hide.
worse. Oh God, he recognised that voice. He could recall that voice better than his own.
“...Ty has a problem, and I don’t know how to help him.”
This time, they didn’t stop, if they tried it would have been impossible. Tony’s hands clasped around Steve’s neck, his back, desperately until they reached his face like the final confirmation that
“...You don’t have nobody, you know.”
He didn’t really want to disobey her of all people, and reluctantly obeyed.
He settled on a smile. Friendly. Casual. Pretend that you’re not phased. Be
“H - Yeah, course.” Tearing his eyes away from Tonys and glancing around at everyone else who seemed just as relieved and or confused.
) boogie in his room. Everything seemed fine, he was partying on his own, getting his life back together, he made up with his friend, he made his BED, it was fine, it was-
If he was
As he collapsed into his arms.
“It’s your turn.” Tony whispered, although his eyes glossed over Steves, sinking into his.
“That was a lot of effort for what - six mediocre New York street pretzels?”
“Yeah...”
From here, he couldn’t see as many details, yes, but he could see the skin under his armpit through the gaping armhole of his tank top, and he thought about how he was probably sweating and probably smelled like sweat, and then how he should probably stop thinking like a weirdo, so he pulled out his phone.
“Well. Try it.”
“I love you.”
But right now, here, he wasn’t any of that. A natural version of himself that he’d been allowed to see that night, a softer self.
stupid fucking drawing on the sticky fucking table.
It really hit him when it stopped altogether.
“She always keeps everyone at a… blades distance, you know? But I see her really opening up to him. Maybe they can help each other, she’s… she’s had it rough..”
“Um that doesn’t sound much like an apology to me Rogers, now you owe me double. Here, I’ll show you how to do it: I’m sorry I told a hobo your dick doesn’t work, that was not cool, I’m sure it works fine.”
“Congrats.”
“And go where?” Steve challenged with a smile.
Besides, out of everything that had happened to Steve and Tony retrospectively in recent months, it was hardly anything out of a fairy-tale. Even if he had spent many sleepless hours wondering if Tony was really real.
In those following weeks, Steve began to fully realise the nature of his first kiss with Tony.
“I don’t think anyone in their right mind would trust that guy… I just can’t believe… When? Wait, no. When we went camping?! You said you two went to go buy Doritos from the gas station and that you got lost!”
He was nervous, shaking, actually. He should’ve prepared something to say but that would’ve been too much. But now he was worried Tony would come upstairs and find a shaking and curled up Steve, sweating through his shirt and bawling his eyes out.
Turning away from each other and toward the door, to see Tony slugging a nearly passed out Bruce under his arm.
Tony laughed harder, pointing his grin at Steve as he did. “I don’t think you actually realise how filthy you sound.”
This isn’t right.
“Steve! You disappeared on me, couldn’t handle it?”
He implied with the shaking of his head, although he had to drop dead a second later when Brian sat up.
Steve scoffed, by Ty just kept talking.
“Since I didn’t register that it was apparently 45 degrees out here, you wanna talk about it now or are you going to keep moping?” He didn’t go for another cigarette, still getting used to using them.
He sat in the back and drew courtroom style portraits of his overly enthusiastic drama teacher with her white lady dreads and entirely purple wardrobe, she was kind and said ‘Yowzers!’ a lot like it was a thing.
Winter was growing closer but Steve didn’t even notice the cold. The weeks that went by with Tony were just pure unadulterated bliss.
“Great.” He licked his lips, and proceeded to push his weight onto Steves knee as he hurled himself up to his feet, the patch where his hand once was felt too light without it, the hairs on his arms stood up, his chest heavy, like an aftershock. “Hey save some for me asshole!”
’ over and over again, Natasha progressively shouting louder, Steve saw everyone in the room fill out as usual, the band chattering amongst themselves and then to others - he had a sudden thought:
“I’ve been keeping tabs, I worry about Tony. He’s a troubled kid, and I don’t think you’re any good for him – see, all you’ve done since you’ve shown up is fuck up every one’s life. Mine, Tony’s, I heard about that little situation with your friend and the redhead. Don’t you ever think they’d be so much better without you?”
“Just ran a marathon? It’s fine. I’m not hungry.”
“You know I’m surprised you’re not a vocalist or something, considering how much you love the sound of your own voice.”
“As anything.”
Tony wanted to scare him away. But it didn’t work.
had done as if he wasn’t a victim and he was the monster that brought those things upon himself. Maybe he thought Steve bought into it too, and looked at him in disgust and annoyance like he wanted.
Tony was impossibly lovely, in all the wrong ways.
Steve felt very vulnerable, standing in the side walk, fists and jaw clenched like he’d laid himself bare in front of Tony and Tony alone.
Steve reached across the table to hold his hand.
“I’ll see you at the station.”
So, as any genius, love-sick fool, hopeless romantic (kinda) would – he set out to try and tell Tony he liked him without actually telling him he liked him. It was an amazing idea by any standards.
Steve leant closer to Bucky’s ear when he asked, fearing that the sound of metal smashing against metal that was supposed to be metal was too loud for him to be heard. They were propped up against a tall round table in the back of the bar, the space mostly empty as everyone else was crowded towards the corner of the room, jumping and thrashing against each other, it amazed him how many people had managed to cram into such a small place, the roof was low, the rafters decaying, college kids bounced off of the peeling red wallpaper.
“Yeah, you sure look real busy.” Bucky said in an exaggerated tone as he looked over his shoulder at the mostly empty bar. He’d come to visit Steve at work one Tuesday, and it turned out to be a quiet place to study where it was acceptable to drink while you were doing it. Although he wasn’t really supposed to talk to customers for hours on end, on nights like this it was alright, there was only really regulars that he was beginning to know, and they sat at booths rather than the bar because they’d rather be alone. One was an older Dutch woman who was always dressed in cardigans and reading funny pages in the newspaper (he slapped himself on the wrist for thinking they weren’t even a thing anymore).
“Now you know everyone.”
“Wow. That’s low.” He scoffed, with a smile. “You don’t know anything about me.”
“Don’t act all innocent.”
“No, no you’re right. I’ll see you soon.”
before giving him his trophy.
“Sounds like something I don’t wanna catch!”
The music from the bar seemed much too close, too loud as the door slammed shut, blocking them from everyone else.
“You SLEPT TOGETHER?!”
“Hey Tony.” Steve finally got in. He’d told Tony about him and Sharon’s relationship a few times, hopefully there wouldn’t be a problem.
“If that makes you feel weird or anything then I get it.”
“Shut up.” Tony replied with a teary-eyed grin. “You won me over the second I saw that stupid little notebook. I’m… I’m sorry I wasted so much time.” His fingers grazed through Steve’s overgrown hair, trying to get his senses used to the feeling.
Steve tugged on the fabric around Tony’s arm, gently pulling the shirt over his head. “You. I just like looking at you.”
Each street lamp he passed, each lonely person with a bottle in their hand and sad story that nobody else in the world cared about began to blind him after a while, until he was just mindlessly chasing a vision of black and white and shimmering gold, everything he wanted but couldn’t have, something so perceivable to the eye but impossible to grasp.
But he was interrupted, to this surprise, as Tony leapt up onto his toes to throw his arms around him, kissing him with as much force as he could, until Steve would hold his back for support, and he could kiss him back, as gentle as he felt for him.
He didn’t know where to start first, standing in the centre of his room. He looked to his studies,
“I guess you’re just as fucked then, Van Gogh.” Tilting his head up towards Steve and the night sky after he spoke, letting the cigarette fizzle down to his lips.
. No service. He didn’t particularly feel like asking the delightful bartender for the wifi either.
“Well maybe you didn’t know him as well as you thought you did. I sure didn’t.” Tony stood up again, agitated and unsatisfied, implying he wanted Bucky to leave.
Learning that maybe Twister was better with more people, but still laughing along the way, winding their limbs around each other on the floor whilst the music strummed in the background, the only thing lighting their bodies was the TV, flashing above them.
Okay now he was blushing.
A chuckle came out of Steve as he ate. “I suppose I feel kind of better having robbed him now. We’re like a team, you and me. You’re the amazing, genius, pretzel cook and I’m the pretzel thief who, I don’t know, takes out all the competition.”
“You’re going to stay with him though.”
It was a reasonable size, a large living room with blankets and other tapestries draped over the couch, a tv in the corner playing an assortment of alternative music videos and songs blaring out of the speakers, the place was worn in, lived in, but the difference between the nice furniture and the safe location almost made all of it seem... forced. As if whoever lived there was trying their best to make a home out of something, to make it appear comfortable, like there were long and good memories there.
, he would need to get a grip and go get him.
“Of course, go say bye to your friend. Don’t worry about anything, it’s gonna be okay.”
But Tony didn’t see it that way, to him, Steve was just some guy who liked to draw and occasionally drew pictures of him and his friends in a completely non-obsessive, non-crushing way.
“Why, what’s wrong? Do you not like Tony, is that it? ‘Thought you liked Tony?”
Oh, how he missed that control too. How he never realised how much he needed to hear the words coming out of someone else’s mouth to realise he wasn’t crazy.
Tony stood from Steves seat and -
- he glanced over at Tony, who had been pulled onto Ty’s lap and was having his neck attacked by his lips.
“That’s fair...”
Trying to get over Tony Stark was more than just a mission. He’d faced loneliness before but not like this. Shutting his eyes and all he could see in the darkness was the olive outline of his shoulder, the dip in his collarbone that could carry an ocean of knowledge and his neck – lips, bitten and bruised, cheeks, nose, eyes. Bright brown eyes looking back at him with intrigue and wonder and then…
“You make a convincing argument. But who says I
) had become so obsessed or maybe even bewitched that he took any opportunity to see Tony, even if it was via That bastard.
Holding him in the dark, he felt seen when he’d felt invisible the entire time. He wasn’t scared of anything anymore, he wasn’t scared that Tony was going to flake out on him, turn around and say he’d changed his mind. This was different. This was everything.
“You…” Tony laughed into a not so delicate sigh. “Oh just take me away then. For real.”
Steve sat up, genuinely interested.
“You’re more interesting than you think you are.” He said simply. “But you didn’t hear that from me.”
“Right you are.”
“Mother you know that when I’m on speaker phone I can hear when Howard is talking shit about me.
“- It’s okay.”
Tony smiled.
No, he was up, clothed, a couple feet away from him by the lake that glittered in the daylight. All it took was him to hear Steve sit up, for him to start walking away.
“What century are we in? I know how to use a dishwasher.”
Everything was new, every feeling, touch, whimper, as he lowered Tony down onto his back, their lips still attached as though desperate for life he noticed that it was the most comfortable he’d ever felt.
“Okay? As in-“
The bartender, a short plump girl with pink hair and piercings dotted around her face like pins on a map, gave Steve a weird look when he ordered a coke (not a water), but it might’ve just been because she was trying to watch the band when he’d interrupted her.
When Steve nodded, Tony nodded back, he turned back towards the door, and it made Steve want to be sick, until he turned around again, making an expression which was somewhere along the lines of disbelief and pure relief.
“Sweetheart could you get me a water?”
“Dude.” Bluntly, tilting his head to the side and glaring at Bucky like he was a moron, sparing a look at the couple behind him and being glad they weren’t paying attention to them either. “Why do you even wanna know?  Not that I’m going to talk to you about it.”
“God, I wish I could just take you away.” Steve moaned, running his fingertips up and down Tony’s tanned skin. “Have you all to myself.”
“Well we better be going. Steve’s got a really bad case of premature erectile dysfunction, gotta go pick up his boner pills.”
Steve just smiled, and squeezed Tony’s shoulder, about to say goodbye, when –
Steve thought.
Then Bucky shot to his feet so fast that his long hair almost whipped Steve in the eye.
? Or something awful like that.”
Tony had already torn down too many walls for Steve, the secrets he’d whispered to him, the songs he showed him. He was so close to truly opening himself up to Steve that it scared him. It scared him like loving Bucky scared Natasha.
“I like this.”
The night had drawn in darker by the time they got out and had forged a fire more impressive than the original using only sticks and Tony’s lighter. They sat around it next to one another on top of their coats. Tony took Steve’s sweater (without asking), cross legged by the warmth with only that and his soaking boxers on. Steve could deal with the chill from sitting in only his t shirt and briefs if it meant he could see Tony swallowed up in his large blue sweater, the sleeves pulled comfortably above his thin wrists.
“That’s exactly what I was thinking.”
He didn’t know what to do, if he walked away, Tony might turn around and see and he’ll look like a gutless idiot who can’t even bare to be around him. If he stayed, and whoever was in the bathroom decided to take their sweet time, he might have to actually talk to him. Although, a part of him wanted to speak to him, and he really needed to pee.
“I could help you make it bigger if you want?” Steve offered, gently, for some reason provoking a small laugh from Tony. “What? Really, I’m quite handy.”
When Tony came back from the kitchen, Steve had expected something strong that probably tasted awful, just based off of the stories. Steve had found himself a spare chair next to ‘Bruce’ although he hadn’t said a word to him the entire time just as Tony said, but, to be fair, Steve hadn’t tried to converse with him, or anyone else sat around the living room drinking and chatting and showing each other things on their phones.
He did, he definitely did.
Steve blinked. What more was there to him that he could offer Tony to satisfy him? Tony thought he was more interesting than he knew, but he couldn’t imagine why.
Steve smiled happily at Tony; whose smile was mostly indifferent. “I already knew.” Tony sighed in a smug tone and kissed Steve’s cheek, as if to make up for it.
“Never heard you use so many curses before. Im hungry, starving, actually. Are you hungry?” He could run his mouth just as much as he could literally, that’s for sure, already dodging Steves question and his presence and pacing down the street. “Is that insensitive to ask, you know, cause of...” He didn’t quite gauge Steves reaction but cut himself off anyway. “Sorry, I say dumb stuff when I’m... When I’ve -“
Laughing freely, their hands and their feet brushing against one another, sensitive touches comforted by gentle laughs in the darkness, a sense of solidarity in their joint difference from everyone else, knowing more now about each other than they’d ever told anyone else.
“Why are you telling me this?” Steve asked in a serious tone.
But when he played he smashed with a newfound fire in himself, like he could bang up enough friction from the sticks and the rubber and the metal and his fingers that he could spark a flame and encase the entire theatre in his own internal rage. Everyone in the room was burning to death except for him, him and Tony.
“No.” He answered instantly, and surely.
He turned over in his twin sized bed, disgruntled and restless, the only thing soothing him was the image of Tony in his brain, the memory of his hand holding his, how his palm was soft and the insides of his fingers rough from the sticks. He liked how much smaller he was than him, how when he was on top of him he seemed inconceivably tiny in comparison, and how that’s how he might look if -
Steve glanced over his shoulder when Tony’s touch ceased, he was dangling over the side of the bed, rifling through the pockets of his shorts which had been strewn across the floor by the bedside table. He had borrowed a pair of Bucky’s sweats to sleep in, because Steve’s were too big when he tried them on (no, he didn’t watch Tony change, which evidently Tony found kind of odd, but he really didn’t want to risk anymore surprise boners). At first, when Steve changed, it was with hesitation, he swiftly realised there was no reason for that, until Tony stopped mid-sentence when Steve took his shirt off and fleeted to the bathroom. He wondered if he’d done something to make him uncomfortable.
He found him in a reclusive, open topped den. A pool lined with rocks and reeves, glimmering in the moonlight cascading through the space above, trees opening up to give them even a little bit of light. Tony was stood, looking into a small pond that came off from the larger pool, dammed by rocks and filled with moss and some odd shaped lily pads.
Steve swallowed tight before he began, it hurt, like the words were reluctant to come out after all this time of pushing them away. But he was ready now to bare any pain he would come across.

“Why, why not? Don’t be lame.”
Steve resentfully followed his Bucky to the edge of the crowd, pulling his back closer to his neck, feeling out of place and too warm in his blue sweater, compared to the black shorts and chains and ripped tees adorned by the majority.
“I- I’m sorry. I have to… Go to the bathroom.” He excused himself, bluntly, rushing to his feet.
Steve laughed, mostly because Tony laughed, a low chuckle -
“You got – you got some mascara on your…” Then Tony’s thumb was on his lip, maybe he should have put chapstick on,
He wouldn’t follow him.
right now.”
A gentle laugh passed from Steve’s lips, the sight of Tony’s smile was comforting for the first time, he wasn’t scared, not at all.
He never thought anyone could see him this way.
“As personal as you wanna get.” He dragged out the words on his tongue, and Steve felt his chest tighten. Steve nodded, forgetting his head was against Tonys for a second and causing his to move up and down at the same time.
He began shrugging off his jacket, throwing it on the ground by his shoes. Steve began to tense as his small calloused fingers grabbed the hem of his shirt.
“I used to have an eating disorder.”
songs referenced:
“I’m just not convinced. I don’t think he would do this. I know how he felt about you Tony. The way he beat himself up when you… Well, I’ve seen him at his worst and he definitely wasn’t there these past few months. Something’s happened to him.”
“Coming.” Rhodey and Clint had both said in unison, and as they left Steve alone on the leather couch, amidst their chattering he could overhear Tony and Ty’s conversation from the other couch.
The eye contact was invasive.
“God, let me handle this.” Composing herself as she followed Tony out the room, all Steve could manage was to follow her to the door, hiding behind the wall and watching as Tony emerged from a different room after assumingly placing Bruce on a strangers bed to rest.
“Do you play this with everyone you meet?”
Then, with blood in his ears, his heart thumping with the speakers, no noise, just an oppressive clanging of drums rooted deep in his chest, he knew he was never going to betray Tony, even if it hurt him, even if it scalded him.
And trying not to jerk off over Tony.
Steve scanned his face to try and see whether he was joking or not. He couldn’t be serious, surely not. He had friends, his own band, college, he couldn’t just suddenly get up and leave like Steve had dreamed about all this time. Not that he wasn’t grateful, but he always imagined he was destined for more than this, and with Tony by his side, well, he would be complete.
Steve paused.
“You think? Actually, I know you do. Because you can’t lie.”
“Tony…”
Tony wasn’t convinced, interrogative eyes staring up at him and his mouth ruched to one side. He peered at the closed door beside him, kneeling down to observe something on the door itself. He wrapped his hand around the gold doorknob, Steve trying not to visibly cringe as he casually twisted it and pulled it towards him. Revealing an unlocked door and an empty bathroom.
but with pretzels instead of meth.” Tony smirked. “Thanks for calling me an amazing genius.”
Everyone knew Tony. Everyone loved Tony.
“Ah, I see. The giving fan. Tell you what, I’ll give em to her for you. I’m sure she’ll appreciate it.” He gestured to Steves hand, and without thinking he passed them to Tony.
“OKAY!”
Spinning on his heels, Steve tried to make speed back down the hallway, hearing the click of the front door opening and small voices, and then -
oh my god - ida maria
He found a video of two young lean guys filmed on a grainy camera, there was a mousy haired man and a brunet, which was fine. Perfectly fine.
So when they arrived at Tony Stark’s house, he felt a lot more high and mighty that he was at
“Ha, look at that.”  Bucky pointed at the floor.
Most nights he couldn’t catch Tony after the show, but that was fine. Sometimes he would draw, like the first time, sketch the sweat gleaming off of Tony’s skin, the details of his band t-shirts which were sometimes ripped around the neck exposing his collarbones, or from the side he could see his legs, he’d wear shorts and have scraped knees and bandages but he didn’t like to think about how that happened.
“And my life will go on. Everybody is so wrapped up in their own hedonism that they think everything needs to end with a fight or a confrontation or a sweet resolution, but these things just happen. Right? If I just left than whenever anything got tough than I’d be no better than… Well, it wouldn’t be right, is what I’m saying.”
, as-well as anxious, and sick, and excited.
“On your Larry again?” Slapping on his shoulder, in a way he’d only be comfortable with his friend doing.
When he imagined Tony in his bed, there was no unbearable tension, rigid arms that didn’t dare to touch each other and Tony hogging the blanket without him being able to say anything because if he woke him up then he’d have to talk to him and maybe look at him and he couldn’t do that because if he did that then he’d want to kiss him again and he couldn’t do that.
“I told you big bear that I don’t like to be called that and…” Lifting the stick out of the fire, the sausage now resembled a long piece of charcoal rather than food. Tony blinked at it as if he couldn’t comprehend how he’d done it, and then at Steve, softly, although it was his fault for taking his attention away. “Yeah I think it’s done alright.”
“What? That’s not me, you just have a filthy mind.” Steve hoped he wasn’t blushing.
“What’s up man?”
“I thought you didn’t get scared?” Steve tried him with a gentle smile.
It might have been his own ego trying to protect him, but he swore he could see a flash of disappointment across Tony’s brow, and doubt in the twitch in his lip.
“What is?” Steve replied, tipsy and confused.
He turned the coin, gently between his thumbs like he’d been made aware of how delicate it was, even if Tony had just shoved it into his pocket.
Tony just smiled at him, in a way that said,
“You’re amazingly irritating sometimes.” He sighed.
Tony bit his lip, like he was biting back a smile. “You’re such a gentleman. Not many of those around here.”
The most tedious part about watching porn was finding an actual video to watch. He wasn’t picky, not really, he was still a

He realised then, the purpose of this, of Tonys ‘game’. Of Tony bringing him onto
Eventually Tony would restlessly roll over, and Steve would force himself to shut his eyes with the realisation that Tony was on a different plane of existence to himself,
“No, why would I be angry?” Tony answered with a bitter sarcasm. Steve didn’t need to see his face and it made his teeth ache.
Love u all, thank you so much for reading and nice comments are always appreciated and make my day!
Tony looked as surprised as Ty did when he lifted him off the couch with ease, gentle, but heavy handed enough that he could let him lean against his side and guide him at once - Tony let him go, smiling gently at Steve.
This time was different. Happiness echoed in the back of his brain, a new premise, a promise. How – he didn’t know, maybe he would find it in the woods.
Tony’s eyes were full of dread as he saw Steve over Natasha’s shoulder.
“Oh come on. It’s not often Tony brings someone into our little crew. There must be something.” Rhodey narrowed curious brows at him, Clint seemed to be doing something on his phone.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh! Man! That’s Tony Stark! Don’t worry, he’s not dating her, I don’t even think he swings that way anyway!”
“Alright, uh, so… Here’s the deal.” He cleared his throat. “Last week, at the party… I-“
Apparently, the horrible and real reality that Tony probably, maybe, has sex, real gay sex with his actual boyfriend was just too much of  a shock to his fragile (hasn’t had sex in months) system that he just stood there in the hallway in a cold sweat listening to it, to them.
“Not unless you’ve got a cozy scholarship.”
When Tony finally did text him, it wasn’t anything less than what he might’ve expected. But it filled him with excitement nonetheless.
“Everybody, this is Steve! Steve, this is the band.” He pointed his free hand out into the room, tucking the flowers in his elbow. “That’s Nat, you already met her right?”
-“ Bucky groaned, Tony sang a small
But he didn’t.
“What is it then?” The curly haired blond crossed his arms over his naked chest, gesturing towards Steves bag as he cautiously walked back over to him.
“Alright.” Bucky coughed into a closed fist. “You better go get that bus, or you’ll be late.”
“Yes.” He admitted, not to her, to himself. “It’s intense.” He leaned into her, closer to the comfort of feeling like he wasn’t alone. For once.
“Hey, it’s not like I grabbed you by your wrists and pulled you all the way here against your will, if it weren’t for me you would’ve been sitting in your dorm alone with your pencils for friends, you know, like a loser.”
He could see the band through a gap in the crowd by the far wall, people blocked by some speakers and equipment he wanted to learn more about but most importantly - he had a generous albeit cut off view of Tony Stark that he hadn’t had before with the other members in front of him.
It was horrible.
He managed to pull Natasha aside, she was tipsy and very excited, but sharp enough to be immediately concerned when Steve wanted to speak to her personally - despite the most privacy they got being at the edge of the crowd against the wall with the dealers and wallflowers.
songs referenced:
Maybe if Steve had been asked that question more often, he’d be able to think of an appropriate answer. Or at least a good lie that would make him go away.
“Hello again.”
“Tony?”
“Trust me.” Tony tore the box away from Steves hands, pushing aside some bottles and empty red cups on the coffee table to make room. “You aren’t just the other one. Oh - I’m excited to play this later.”
s stopped Tony from going for his jeans. Sliding them down his legs between his fingers, and Steve watched the fabric cascade past the goosebumps on his skin, how he clumsily kicked them past his feet and pulled his socks off with them. No turning back now.
“Yeah, I just want the timing to be right. I don’t want to screw it up with her, I’ve never been in a serious relationship and neither has she, just don’t wanna scare her away.” The anxiety from the sudden conversation prompted Bucky to tie his hair back into a bun, as if he was getting ready for something strenuous. Steve just sat, and listened.
Leaning against the back of Tony’s couch, was –
He knew Tony that had connections with rich socialites in New York but spent most weekends playing with the band in bars and clubs close to college, and he wore eyeshadow and screamed into a microphone behind Natasha about blood and sex. And he knew his preppy boyfriend who had a weird and dark aura who didn’t fit him at all, he knew that well enough, right? Or maybe it wasn’t his place at all.
“No, actually. Bruce told me. Slipped out in conversation, didn’t know me and Natasha were a thing. I haven’t spoke to her, and she’s not the type to text first.”
If he could kiss him, right then and there, he would’ve. He would’ve kissed a boy for the first time and he wouldn’t care about his weird boyfriend, he would accept Tony for everything he was and -
“Is everything okay?” Steve asked with concern.
So he went with it, for some reason he didn’t really know. It just seemed like the right thing to do in that moment. There was something too vulnerable in her kiss that he felt bad pulling away from. That drunk, stubborn flood in his brain made sure he thought it was fine and that it was just ‘something he should do’.
They made love and bought coach tickets for 3:30pm the next day.
Walking down the corridor, he heard music, assuming it was coming from one of Tony’s neighbours.
“Wait –“ Steve sat up, glaring at his best friend across the way. “You told Tony and not me when I told you about me and Tony?”
Steve let go, but he was sure he wasn’t the thing Tony was frightened of.
Steve shook his head ‘no’, not even realising that he was smiling back.
“I would never lie to you...”
“Neither did I…” She chewed on what Steve had said for a minute or two, while he watched her eyes search the carpet for some sort of answer.
He went back to his apartment, empty, the brooch from his mother was still there in its box on the night table. It felt more barren than before somehow, although he hadn’t taken many of his belongings, maybe that was just the empty, sullen feeling in his stomach.
“Okay. You win this round of ‘who had a sadder childhood?’”
Throwing a muted curse down at the floor, his feet picked themselves up. Because he wouldn’t leave Tony alone, running away wasn’t an option.
“O - Uhhhh Tony?” All of the brunets weight had hung onto him, like he could really be dead. He didn’t quite know what following Tonys lead meant, or how far he had to go. How far Tony would go for a fucking pretzel. “Ohhhh noooo.”
“I know.” He threw a smile back at Steve over his shoulder, one that he knew would never fail to pull him in. And then there he was, just as expected, following him. He followed quietly, up the spiral stairwell, the music and the laughter becoming a distant thump, with each floor getting a good idea as to what the neighbours could hear, and if they were used to it.
From what their shadows said, it seemed like Ty tried to pull Tony down, for a kiss or maybe just a hug, but Tony wriggled away, easily, like he’d done it many times before. It was when they began whispering sensitive ‘love yous’ to one another that Steve decided he should probably walk out the door.
Steve froze, swearing internally over and over again.
Steve had no idea, feeling very bad all of a sudden as his friends began cheering and clapping, Tony removing his arm from his shoulder and smiling at them all with raised brows, he was ever so slightly tense, Steve could feel it, and put all his own feelings about himself aside to place a hand on Tony’s leg.
There was no way out now. However many ways there were to say ‘I’m in way too fucking deep’ - He meant all of them.
Nothing.
“Yes, mom I’m okay.”
“Yeah.” Tony spoke quickly, not to the aid of the croak in his throat, an obvious sign of smoking and sleep deprivation. “Yeah, um. Just realised I probably look like a swamp goblin.”
“I don’t know why you feel like you should hide. You don’t look like a swamp goblin, you look great.”
“Wait – you’re not actually being serious?”
And before they’d realised it, they’d spent almost an hour fooling around in the secluded pond. Shouting and cursing as they splashed one an another, wrestling like boys with Tony jumping on Steve’s broad back and Steve picking Tony up in his hulking arms just to drop him into the freezing depths.
“I meant today.”
Trigger Warning: Violence, Death
“She looks cool tonight, right?” Bucky asked from beside him, and he realised it was the first time he registered him all night, one thing was on his mind and it certainly wasn’t how Natasha looked.
“It’s just… It’s not like him.” Bucky gave Tony his phone back, not that he wanted to look at it anymore either.
“I would say so, yeah.” She laughed.
“Nah.”
“Alright alright I got water and a bucket!” Tony announced, diving into the darkened room past Steve. Dropping the bucket and the water bottle onto the bedside table with an abnormally loud thump, before running around the bed to open a crack in the window. “Geez Ty you pushed yourself too far again, maybe when the doctor says not to drink on that medication you should listen to her.” Tony sighed, pushing his hair off of his head dotingly, suddenly making him feel like he was intruding on a private moment, even more so when Tony dug into Tys pocket, ignoring his protests. Thankfully, he was just retrieving his phone, and leaving it on the bedside table. “If you need me sweets, call me, or someone. And don’t jump out the window.”
hey, thanks so much for reading! comments are always appreciated <3
“From the top, sleaze-ball.”
“-then get in the water.”
He jumped up, as if nothing had happened, that that moment had been a screenshot in a series of insignificant images to be swiped away because it didn’t matter to him.
A future with Tony was all he ever wanted.
“Well you aren’t Rhodey’s keys.” He said softly without an ounce of sarcasm in his voice, looking around the little lights dotted around the roof as he walked across the concrete.
“So how do I know you’re telling the truth?”
“Okay. Here’s the thing. Lately I’ve realised some things about myself, and it’s driving me insane.” Pausing in case his friend wanted to interject, or ask a question – he didn’t, just looked up at him with passive eyes, not too eager to listen but not bored or annoyed. It was comforting. “I… I like guys? Or
"TONY! what did you whispered to him?" Natasha demanded.
"My deepest apologizes, Captain but that I cannot answer. I can reassure you that, sir is safe and sound, there is no need for you to worry about him. " J.A.R.V.I.S explained.
"-Tony! You do realize you're thinking out loud, we literally heard everything you said" Pepper snickered.
"It's Steve's" Pepper replied with a huge smirk on her face. Tony knew that face really well, she's gonna tease the fuck out of him. Why did I even mentioned Steve's name? Tony rolled his eyes.
Steve's father placed a hand on his shoulder and told him it was okay and to let them be, they're kids after all. Howard nodded.
"Nooo! Fuck my life " Tony growled, covering his face with a cushion. Fuck! This is so embarrassing.
Steve handed his helmet to Tony; his safety was Steve's responsibility and he'd never let anything happen to Tony, nope not in his watch.
It sounded like a threat, did this man actually dare to threaten Steve? Steve tried moving, but the grip was iron tight. Okay, maybe Steve wasn't putting enough pressure, he was aware of his inhumane strength and it scared him; that's why he restrained his true strength.
Suddenly, Steve felt something extremely soft pressing against his lips. He realized someone was giving him a mouth to mouth, someone was helping him to breathe. They were breathing for him.
The moment the king and queen heard Steve was unconscious they rushed inside to his chamber, shouting his name with a panic.
Tony's a brilliant dancer, maybe Steve would finally learn how to dance.
Who'd thought he had broken into one of Tony Stark's house. The CEO of Stark Industries, Tony fucking Stark. The man he'd only seen in the media. But, Steve had never seen the man up close. Tony Stark was simply breath taking. He cursed the reporters for not capturing Tony's beauty properly. His only regrets was not seeing Tony face to face years before, he had to admit the man was million times hotter in real life.
He couldn't get rid of the image in his head of Tony Stark in his vulnerability state. Steve clutched his shirt, his heart ached more and more.
If Steve says no, then Tony would go home and he might never see him again. No, he didn't want that. He wanted to know Tony more. Steve nodded.
After an hour or so, Steve had woken up in a hospital bed. His mum was beside him. Bucky was sitting on the couch.
He felt a strong arm wrapped around his waist and pulled him closer. Tony immediately shot his eyes wide opened.
On the way to his chamber, Steve gave a small tutorial around the castle. Tony was rather amazed, he asked countless of questions regarding the castle and the royal family.
Tony's eyes were filled with tears. "I hate you, Rogers! I wish I had never met you." Heavy sobs teared from his throat, as he constantly tried wiping his tears away with the back of his hand.
Tony took a deep sigh and jumped onto his bed. He laid diwn for a while, as his mind drifted off to last night.
"N-nothing" Tony stuttered. Why was he even stuttering? Wait, could it be that he's embarrassed? But why? Tony's mind was full of questions.
"You won't believe this but Stark treated Steve's wound. Look he even used his suit to stop the blood from dripping" Clint stated with a smirk.
Tony covered his dad's mouth. "Steve, I'm sorry about my dad. He's just very open minded "
"Really! Well, I love Iron Man. I can give you millions of reason why he's the best character." Steve smirked.
Tony was only person who ever cared for him, he knew that since a really long time.
Why was this man different from all the others? Why did he care about Steve? Even though he barely had known Steve for an hour.
Bucky observed Steve's face, something was seriously off. "Steve, why's your face so pale? Please tell me you're not having another panic attack. I wouldn't have the slightest clue how to help. So anything but."
