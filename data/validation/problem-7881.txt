“He’s a greedy warmonger who’s looking to make a buck with second grade weapons because he knows he’ll never be as smart as his son. He isn’t worth it.” Steve spat out, feeling his heart race.
“Take your time. It’s fine.” Tony smiled.
The whole idea set his teeth on edge, suddenly he was back in reality and a million miles away from the night he’d spent with Tony.
“I’m not normal?”
“It’s a stabiliser. Part of the solution Howard couldn’t figure out, a conductor for the Jericho core. It’s not easy to find but Howard will be able to get some.”
Steve walked towards Sitwell slowly, his family taking their silence order to follow him as Sitwell and his men did the same. The headlights from Sitwell’s car provided enough light in the clearing to illuminate them and cast shadows on the shipping crates surround them.
Thor was still a bloody mess after their ambush, flaked blood splattered onto his face and mixed into his beard. Steve didn’t envy him, cleaning dried blood out of a beard was never a fun experience and more than once Clint had suggested Steve just shave the damn thing off. He never did though, The Captain had a face that everyone knew and Steve needed to make sure it was as different from his old self as possible. Natasha wasn’t a fan, she said it made him look older. Steve never had the heart to reminder her he was older, they both were.
The sound of the door banging open was enough to have them both startling, Thor striding into the room with frantic steps and wild eyes.
Natasha led him into the kitchen, bustling around the room with the grace of a dancer as she filled the coffee pot and set out finding a whole heap of mugs. Tony stood by the kitchen table, unsure if he should help or stay out of the way.
Steve was shaking with the effort not to rip the material of the ties right off and throw Tony down until he was fucking him to the point he couldn’t remember his own name. Tony’s hips were grinding against him, desperately seeking more friction.
Tony cried out when he felt Steve’s fist wrap around him, pumping his cock into the circle of his hand in time with his thrusts into Tony’s heat.
Howard sighed, his face getting redder from anger by the second, “I need to get the Jericho to work, Tony. I just need you to take a look at the designs and see if you can spot anything out of place with the trigger system. That’s it, you don’t even have to come into the office.”
He tried to give her a tired lopsided smile, “Okay.”
Stark men are made of iron and they didn’t cry.
Now though, listening to them break their hearts open and try and stitch the pieces back together he knew what he had to do. He could give them a happy ending. At least, he could do that. It wasn’t perfect, it wasn’t the win everyone was hoping for but they would have each other and maybe a chance to build that life with kids and a happy ending if they wanted to. Steve could give that to them. Didn’t he owe them that? After everything they had done for him?
Tony wanted to laugh at that reasoning, “He got a name?”
“But it is you. Shorter hair, lighter. Clean shaven but it’s a good look for you, Captain. It’s all in the eyes though. Damn, they gave you a purple heart for your service in Afghanistan.” Fury stated in disbelief.
It was irrational, this fear at seeing Steve again after everything they said at the docks. Tony wanted to take it all back, that whole conversation, if it meant he got get rid of the knot in his stomach and the weight in his chest. That wasn’t what was important though, getting Steve out was. They could deal with the rest after.
“Don’t say it like you’re giving up.” It was Tony’s voice, smaller and unsure next to Thor’s but Steve’s eyes immediately went to him. So did everyone else’s.
He was thrusting into Tony with a maddening pace, pure carnal passion fuelling him as they both worked towards their second orgasms of the night. Steve’s grip on his hip would leave bruises and Steve couldn’t even feel his other hand from how tight Tony was gripping it. They moved together, shuddering and pushing each other further towards the edge with each cant of their hips and every thrust.
All eyes were on him when he turned back around. Natasha’s were wide and frantic. Clint meant a lot to her, they had come as a package deal and had since they were kids as far as Steve knew, “Hawkeye?” She breathed and Steve watched Bucky take a step towards her like he wanted to comfort her before remembering they weren’t together anymore and stopping himself.
Howard slammed both hands on the table in anger and Bucky was quick like a shot, pulling a gun from inside his jacket and cocking it level at Howard with a blank face. Tony was panting, heart hammering like a hummingbird in his chest as Howard seethed.
Steve swore again, hips losing their rhythm as his pleasure raced towards the edge, teasing him with each movement of his hips. Tony was moving with him, hips bucking off the bed as he used Steve’s body for leverage and gripped the sheet until his knuckles were white in his other hand. This angle was clearly working for both of them.
“The Captain. Steve Rogers.” Tony breathed out, “I know he’s been held here, and I need two minutes alone with him.”
Fury looked behind him quickly out the open door, checking they were still alone, “We got word of a gunfight at the shipment yard. Three Hydra dead. One Avenger shot. The turf war started yesterday evening. That’s why Ross is so riled. He needs to get Rumlow before the streets get bloody.”
He backed Bucky up against the side of the couch, hoping that keeping him upright would slow the blood flow and then Bruce was there. His mouth pressed into a firm line and his eyes set to the task at hand.
Steve looked at him, blue eyes meeting brown. He wasn’t sure what he saw there, something wild and fierce but it was enough not to talk Tony out of it.
Steve pushed past him, “When all this is over I might even pretend to be grateful.”
He pulled at Steve’s thigh again, making him shift back down so Tony could lean up and kiss him. Steve was an excellent kisser, soft and demanding and consuming all at once. If Tony could drown in it then he happily would.
Steve wasn’t fairing much better, that coiled spring inside him was like a flutter of smoke. It was impossible to catch and hold onto until he focused in on Tony and then somehow that smoke had become a forest fire inside of his stomach just from the feeling of being inside Tony and having his hands on his body.
“Maybe I’m just happy to see you?” Steve flirted before he could stop himself. Tony paused then, one eyebrow raised and Steve could feel himself flushing. God, he was one of the most feared people in New York and he was turning red at a stranger.
They weren't going to like what Steve had to say.
Steve flicked against the tip of Tony’s cock again, and again and again, waiting until Tony gave a sharp cry before sinking back down on his length. He let Tony fill him up, hollowing out his cheeks as he lazily bobbed his head up and down his cock. It was too slow for Tony to cum and it was making him impatient. Steve could feel him shaking against his hands, trying to get his hips up.
He was good at this. In the army, spotting the little details was a skill of his. An unusual settlement of dirt that covered up an IUD. A shadow that didn’t fit in with the surroundings that gave away the position of a sniper. Steve could spot things like that from a mile away, it was the only way to keep his team safe. That was before the mission that changed everything, that was before he was left for dead with nothing but miles and miles of desert in every direction. That skill had belonged to Steve Rogers, The Captain preferred the ‘shoot and see who flinches’ approach.
“Cum for me.” He ordered, bringing his lips to Tony’s despite the pressure the angle put on his still tied arm and pulled him in for a bruising kiss.
Natasha stood, “Well, they messed with the wrong mechanic because this one is under our protection.”
As it turned out, Tony found him. Steve had just walked back inside when he spotted Tony walking towards him. He slowed down in front of him, suddenly shy which caused Steve to frown. Had Tony seen?
Tony was used to dark spaces and defeating silence. He was used to uncomfortable situations and how to turn his fear into something useful.
Tony nodded, “That’s fine. As long as Ross isn’t after them. They’d be safer if we left anyway. They can still have plausible deniability.”
Steve nodded, “That kiss was smart. I wouldn’t have thought of it.”
“I’m quite fond of it,” Steve smiled, turning to lean back against the bumper and slide his hands into his pockets, “Remember when we first met, and I told you I wanted to be a getaway driver? Well, this was the car I imagined doing that in.”
Steve had been the son of a bitch who had refused to die.
He looked up to the sky instead, the darkness bleeding into the night. He couldn’t even see the stars it was that cold.
“I have no idea,” He puffed out cold air, “Look, tonight I’ve been ambushed by Hydra, shot at, and found out one of my team is in police custody so I’m asking you as a friend to help me fix this.”
Everyone was gathered in the living room, a hub of nervous energy and chatter. Steve stood in the centre of it all, tall and tired and resolute. Tony felt his heart give a jump at the sight of him. He’d changed out of the orange garb, wearing jeans and a t-shirt and looking a lot more like his Steve than when Tony had last seen him.
“Call you by your last name? You see, it always baffled me how no one knew who The Captain really was. Plenty of people have seen your face. Hell, we run your prints almost monthly and we still can’t get anything. So, I started thinking outside the box.”
Tony stood there in his arms, eyes confused. He didn’t respond.
“You’re not.” Natasha replied, “In all the time I’ve known Steve, do you know how many people he’s seriously dated? How many he brought to meet us?”
Natasha smiled, “He saved me. He didn’t have to; he didn’t even know me but that’s just what Steve does. When a situation’s pointed south, he can’t walk away. I was fifteen, eating out of dumpsters. Clint and I were stealing what we had to so we could get by.” She paused slightly, steeling herself to continue, “We made a name for ourselves as guns for hire. It was good money; it was easy work for us. Then Steve came along, we were fixing him up to be our next mark, but he got the jump on me. He gave me a different choice. He said he was putting together a gang, wanted me and Clint in on it. Food, a home, we got to decide where we drew the line, what jobs we took. He just needed our loyalty, our word that we wouldn’t sell him out.”
“We’re the only ones here.” Steve replied, helping Tony move enough so he could slip out of his heat and dispose of the condom, “Bruce left for the clinic when I got back.”
“Tony, fuck, you feel so good.” Steve groaned, “I need to feel you, I need to kiss you. Fuck.”
When Steve got home after his first day under Fury’s charge, he found Tony in the kitchen perched on top of the counter sipping a cup of coffee. He looked well rested, which was a first for him. He gave Steve a sleepy smile as he pushed his way into the house, dumping his bag on the floor at the sight of his boyfriend.
Steve sighed, holding his hand and pulling Tony in closer. They settled into it. Tony’s hand in his, the other one on Steve’s shoulder as Steve’s rested on his waist. They were closer than they needed to be, moving slowly in tight circles. Tony’s eyes were on his, soft and brown and happy.
“Now what?” Rhodey asked from behind them.
His hand curled round Steve’s, “It’s okay.”
“Morons.” Steve muttered but kept in step with Fury as he led him into the morgue.
The angle had Steve bending down and meant Tony was too high, his erection pressing into Steve’s stomach rather than his crotch, where Steve really wanted to feel him. He growled, hoisting Tony up into his arms, relishing in the feeling of Tony squeezing his legs around him, hands gripping Steve’s shoulders. Steve moved them over to the kitchen table, planting Tony onto the edge and wasting no time in bringing him closer, their erections pressing deliciously against each other.
There was no doubt Steve was home, Natasha’s car stood in the driveway like a bright neon sign. Steve was inside. Was he waiting for Tony? He was hoping Tony wouldn’t come back?
“Figure what out?”
“Her being uncomfortable? That’s rich.” Bucky sneered, “I’m not bringing anyone back here, Steve. Those are the house rules for all of us and I’ve stuck to them but Tasha knows why I broke up with her. She knows what she did. She doesn’t get a say anymore.”
He needed to see Steve. Was he in a room like this one? Or had Ross dragged his family down to the holding cells without so much as reading them their rights. Was Rhodey here? Did he know Tony had been arrested and was possibility about to be charged with who knows what? Steve had told him to stay quiet, let the lawyer do the talking and be in the clear but honestly, all Tony wanted was to know what was happening with his family.
Tony took that as a compliment, “Okay then, let’s go catch up with my dear old dad.”
“If you can’t find anything then you need to promise you’ll let me do whatever I need to do to bring down Rumlow.” Steve replied.
Steve groaned, “I’ll make you feel so good, sweetheart.”
Clint nodded, “So, we have a plan?”
“These people are a waste of energy.” Thor commented once his hammer was clean enough for his liking.
“Yeah, I’m calling from Murdock’s phone right now. They can’t ID me, my fingerprints don’t have a match to their system but their trying to pin this body on us, Cap. I haven’t said anything, I swear.” Clint replied over the phone.
“Looks like you got a few more in since then.” He replied with a glance over at the classic cars in the corner.
Bucky shook his head, “Fuck, tell me this isn’t happening, Punk. Tell me you haven’t lost your damn mind.”
Tony pulled away just as quickly as Steve opened his eyes. Tony took a few steps backwards as he watched the confusion on Steve’s face change to something more mischievous, no doubt realising what Tony’s plan had been all along with that kiss. The material of Steve’s t-shirt came down far enough that the little box wasn’t visible to anyone who didn’t know it was there.
Steve sighed, hand moving over Tony’s forearm, “Your understanding, maybe?”
Rhodey tried to move closer but Tony shook his head violently and tried to curl up tighter, “Okay, I’ll still right here, okay?”
He thought about his family. He thought about the loss Natasha would feel if she had to separate from them all, especially Clint who had been at her side since they were children. He thought about Bucky, reckless and impulsive. How would he fair without Steve and the team to ground him? Bruce would be alright; Bruce would be able to go back to whatever life he had before Steve had pulled him in. Sam might lose the bar, maybe they’d let him stay in Brooklyn though and ship everyone else out instead? Thor would be difficult; his body count was almost as high as Steve’s if not higher. They wouldn’t want to do him any favours. They’d want to ship him off, minimise his contact with the outside world. They’d want to contain him and call it protection.
“Tony.” He tried, watching as Tony winced at the sound of his own name.
He arms were crossed over his chest and he was scowling when Steve pushed the door open and slipped into the warmth of the house. Steve definitely wasn’t in the mood for this, he needed a shower and a change of clothes and then he could get back to work but Bucky clearly was intent on having this conversation now and Steve knew it was only because he was worried about him.
Tony shook his head, “Don’t talk like that. This is just another thing we have to get through. Another day.”
“What? You’re going to shoot me on your own doorstep now?” Fury demanded, raising his hands in mock surrender.
Steve was close. His whole body was humming, and he was still shaking from the strain he was putting on the restraints. Tony thought he might have heard the material stretch at one point, the seams giving way under Steve’s muscle, but they held him firm and all Steve could do was gasp his way to his orgasm.
“Promise me. Whatever happens next, we do it together.” Tony replied taking Steve’s hands in his own.
He shook out the cap and shoved it onto his head, placing the glasses on his nose so they hid his eyes, “You know only morons wear sunglasses inside.”
“You’d do that for us?”
Tony was smiling at him when he found the strength to pull his head back, leaning back against the passenger seat with a smile of his own, “I’m pretty sure your team heard us just now.” Tony said with a breathless laugh.
Tony gave him a meek smile. Really, on top of everything else he had to convince Steve to stop being an idiot and save himself? They were all doomed.
Steve felt warm and a bright light blinded his eyes for a moment as a soft buzzing sound filled the air. He heard bodies thump to the fall, dull and lifeless and then Tony was lowering his arm and Steve’s vision managed to right itself.
Deep down had he always known it wasn’t going to last, was that why he sought Steve out? Someone as damaged and incapable of love as he was. Had Tony been setting himself up for failure this whole time or ignoring the warning signs because if it was Steve pulling the trigger then he was happy to get shot.
Tony’s cock was shining with precome, glistening and erect as Steve pulled out and buried himself back in again, watching Tony’s body bend to take him. He was breathing into Tony’s ear, mouth sucking a mark into his neck that might be hard to hide tomorrow but Steve didn’t care. Tony loved him, Tony was with him and around him and everything to him.
He pushed it back as Tony nodded, “If you don’t get inside me soon, I might explode.” He replied and that was all the encouragement Steve needed.
That’s what Steve wanted. He let his mouth sink down on Tony’s cock, taking him as far down his throat as he could without gagging. That had Tony gasping fully awake as his hands fisting the sheets either side of him and his head lifted off the pillows to watch Steve take him.
His fingers were cold from the tie but as soon as he was free Steve curled both arms around Tony, holding him close and planting a kiss on his sweaty temple.
Rumlow rubbed a hand over his scar, “Oh, I know what a weapon of mass destruction looks like. I saw them up close in Afghanistan, used a few myself. You know what I learned for my time overseas? Whoever controls the weapons has the power.”
Steve was breathing heavily into Tony’s ear, listening as Tony moaned at the feeling of Steve inside him and watching as he gripped the bedsheet was his free hand in order to ground himself.
“He had a gun, but I managed to get the jump on him before he could shoot our resident hot-head.” Natasha replied, “We’re fine. He’s probably got a concussion though, I had to hit him on the head. Figured we might as well bring him to you for an interrogation after going to all the effort.”
“Always.” Rhodey replied, “What’s happened?”
“How…?” Clint was cut off by a thud hitting the front door so loud it vibrated through the house all the way to the kitchen.
Thor nodded, “Divide and conquer. How do we get the police focus off us and onto them?”
“I’ll try.” Steve promised with a smile, not wanting to disappoint her when Nat was only trying to look after him while he looked after everyone else.
Okay, Steve left. Steve was probably making the smart decision, he was all wrong for Tony, wasn’t he? That was why Tony hadn’t told Rhodey about him yet. He knew every word Steve said at the docks had been right and he was too ashamed to admit it to him. Maybe Steve did him a favour. That doesn’t mean he wasn’t beyond angry though. Whether Steve was right in his decision or not, Tony knew he was running scared and that pissed him off more than anything. He’d never met anyone who was as good at self-sabotage as he was.
Wasn’t that an odd thought.
So far, no luck. No luck on the Hydra front either. They had been trailing a couple of lower level guys for the past two days and there was nothing new to be learnt. Whoever this guy was, Steve knew he was smart.
Steve reached for him, pulling Tony as close as he could. Drinking him in.
Tony watched the exchange with a fondness, this really was a family. This rag-tag bunch of criminals that would kill and die for each other. It made his heart stutter. He dialled in Rhodey’s number and waited for it to ring.
“What does that mean?” Ross pressed.
Tony rolled his hips again, a little gasp escaping his mouth at the build up of friction, “You already are.”
“The one I called to fix your bike? You said you wanted it sorted before your next meeting with Hydra so I found the best Mechanic this side of Manhattan. He’s in the garage right now.” She explained.
“Clint’s been hit!” Sam said frantically, shoving Clint gently onto the couch before backing away. Bruce slid into his place, kneeling down on the floor as his hands went to Clint’s side.
He slipped it in with the others to feel Tony vibrate against him, fuller and more desperate than before. Steve pressed against him, feeling Tony’s body against every line of his and he pushed deeper inside his heat, curling his fingers in the way he knew would rub right over Tony’s prostrate because he knew Tony’s body better than his own.
Bucky wasn’t saying it to be mean, he was saying it because it was the truth and Steve needed to hear it. He sighed, knowing that if he ever cared about Tony then the smart thing to do would be to walk away. To stop whatever this attraction between them was before they got in too deep or Tony got killed.
Ross spared him a passing glance, moving to prop himself back against the edge of the desk. Tony stayed where he was nearest the opposite wall, feeling completely out of place in his ratty jeans and jacket. Ross’ suit was crumpled, and he’d lost his tie, but he still looked more put together than Tony felt.
Steve managed a half smile, “So I’ve been told.”
Bucky and Thor were absent from the group and Steve tried to allow himself a small moment of relief that they were already in place at the docks, watching the shipment yard for any sign of Tony or Rumlow. As soon as Steve knew for sure that was where Tony was being kept, he could act.
The room around him erupted into chaos, questions and voices layered over each other. Tony held firm but Steve could see him gripping the sides of the podium a little too tightly in his hands. He had single seconded destroyed his father’s legacy with one sentence and replaced it with something more honourable and people had noticed.
Steve sped up his administrations, Tony was taunt like a bow above him, frantically rolling his hips without any rhythm but the need to chase the edge of his pleasure. Steve could see him quivering with the effort to reach it, knees pressing into the edge of his thighs and his fingers were digging into Steve’s shoulders so hard he was sure it would bruise.
Tony’s ears pricked up, “Gang case? The Captain, right? I saw the news.” He hated himself for even caring.
“Right you are, Captain.” Thor replied gleefully, bringing his hammer up once more. Steve could see the red blood slick again the metal and splattered onto Thor’s face from the back spray.
Rumlow wasn’t smiling today, he grunted as he whipped off the sheet and Tony could make out the sheets of metal, some tools and other boxes on the trolley.
He was running on guess work, having no idea about the warehouse or it's layout but he kept heading in the same direction, pushing forward. His guess was it was once industrial, if the metal timbers and support beams ahead of him were any indication and that meant in theory there would be an exit from either end of the warehouse. One for trade goods and one for staff.
“Happy days.” Tony replied, feeling his heart race and a bead of sweat slide down his neck.
Steve closed his mouth more firmly over Tony’s cock, not giving him the chance to slide out again. He swallowed around him, feeling Tony’s hips move against his face and his hand tighten in Steve’s hair before Steve sucked him hard. He sunk his cheeks in and brought Tony closer to him with the hands guiding his butt and he sucked him down.
Peter nodded curtly, throwing Tony a look that suggested they would be talking about this later before he slipped out.
Steve groaned, moving to his hands and knees so he could crawl up the bed. He landed on Tony’s chest with a sigh, hands supporting most of his weight as he laid against his lover, “Still alive.” Steve replied, placing a kiss on Tony’s chest.
The other cop commanded the room immediately, he was large and imposing. Not in the way Steve was but in a different way. Something subtler and harder to read. It was the eye-patch over his left eye that caused Clint to stall. That was different. His suit was nicely pressed and black, his hands free as he shut the door behind him and went to sit down next to his colleague. His good eye never left Clint, still standing near his side of the table, as his friend fussed about with the file in his hands.
Or maybe, they could. Maybe he could repurpose the arc reactor tech, make it something better than a weapon. An energy source had any applications beyond that.
“You can’t keep me locked up without evidence!” Clint’s voice echoed in the empty interrogation room with biting injustice. It wasn’t the first time he’d seen the inside of a room like this and he knew it probably wouldn’t be the last.
He couldn’t accept he’d never see Steve again. Even if he got out of this completely free thanks to Steve’s lawyer how could Tony walk out that door and let Steve rot? Natasha and Thor were there too. How long before Ross came for the others? This was his family too, he wasn’t able to walk away from it. If they were going down then Tony would be right there with them.
Tony shook his head, “They didn’t stay because you offered them protection, Steve. They stayed because they cared about you.
The sound of his phone buzzing brought him out of his head, Steve drained the last of his scotch before grabbing his phone.
“He’s going to jail either way.” Ross mused.
Steve sighed, running a hand over his beard, “Tony, you don’t have to…”
He wanted to retreat back to the garage in hopes of avoiding this reunion a little while longer. Tony wasn’t sure he could do it. Go inside and prepare for a fight, with Steve’s family, with Steve, after everything that had happened between them. Would Steve want to talk about it? Would he even want to see Tony now the threat of jail time was over for the moment and the focus had shifted to Hydra?
Then he saw himself. At least it was sketches of his eyes. All dark and playful but they were definitely his. Then there were actually sketches of him, in this pad along with everyone else Steve cared about. Tony was unprepared for the onslaught of emotion rising up in him. His hands stopped flicking through the pages at the sketch of him working on the car in Steve’s garage. It was a side profile, Tony busy focusing on the car in the drawing but there was something there. The look of peace and contentment at doing something he loved, even in a drawing Steve managed to see him better than most people did in a lifetime.
Fury had pulled him back into reality with a harsh, “And a haircut wouldn’t kill you, Rogers. New job, new start and all that. It’d probably be easier on you if my cops could separate you from The Captain in their minds.”
He was so busy wrapping his mind around that thought that he barely saw Rumlow moving out of the corner of his eye.
Steve let his head fall back to the pillow when Tony moved out of reach, “You’re a fucking tease.” He groaned.
Steve pulled back slightly, taking in the lust in Tony’s eyes. They were dark and blown with desire and if that wasn’t the hottest thing Steve had ever seen. Tony was still lazily rolling his hips against Steve’s, searching for some kind of friction to ease the bulge in his pants as his hands worked their way out of Steve’s shirt to go straight for the buttons. Steve smirked as Tony hastily popped the buttons, revealing Steve’s chest to him. Was it his imagination or did Tony just lick his lips?
“Is it?” Bucky demanded, “Or is it him?”
Steve smiled, “It was less than two hours.”
“Lord, I fell in love with a dreamer.” Steve whispered gently as they pulled away, eyes twinkling and a large smile on his face.
Steve for his part didn’t move, standing frozen as his eyes tracked Tony across the room and his muscles bulged underneath the starch material of his outfit, “What are you doing here? Did they arrest you? They don’t have anything on you…”
Steve nodded in greeting when he spotted Bucky, heading over to him with Nat on his heels.
Tony offered him the half empty coffee cup in his hands, “What do you need distracting from?”
It might be a reckless decision. He had cops coming after him. Hydra and Rumlow coming after him and yet there was a part of him that couldn’t imagine fighting through all that and not having Tony there at the end of it.
“Did you know in the war Brooklyn was one of the towns tasked with the job of producing gunpowder?” Steve asked, “They had to turn out so much of it for years after the smell of it clung to the walls of the shipment yards where they made it.”
“Jesus, Steve, normal people don’t talk about murder before breakfast.” Tony replied, taken back by the firmness of Steve’s tone.
Tony shuddered, “No, I’m a monster. I’m a monster. There’s so much blood.”
"But I'm encouraging you to sign them." Steve's statement had Clint freezing, papers tightly in his fist.
Then he headed down. The morgue was in the basement and that was the way to his freedom.
He wasn’t sure how much time had passed, there was no way to mark time in this place. No window to see night turn into morning or clock that ticked the hours down for him. It had been hours; he knew that much from the ache in his back at the metal chair that did nothing to support him comfortably.
It was like watching water curve around obstacles in its path, a fluid and unstoppable force with all the grace hiding a destruction she was equally capable of. The song ended and that was when Natasha caught sight of him in the doorway, relaxing onto the soles of her feet with a smile.
“You’re right and I gave my word you’d be dead before the night was over.” Steve told him, eyes level with Rumlow again.
“I’d just taken over the gang, Phillips was dead. Hydra thought it would be easier to take me out before I started rebuilding. Some happy-go-lucky bastard cornered me in an alleyway with a bunch of thugs.” Steve told him; eyes unreadable.
It was silly but he picked up his pace, he’d been around Steve long enough to know to trust his gut. There he went again, thinking about Steve. Damn it. Tony hooked a right, slipping down the alley in between two high-rises to take a shortcut. He couldn’t hear the tread falls anymore but he couldn’t shake the feeling of being followed. As he reached the end of the alley, he dared to take a look behind him. At first, he thought he saw a flash of something, but it was over so quickly he couldn’t be sure.
Pierce laughed, “You still think you can win. How naïve of you.”
Rhodey was reaching for the gun on his hip. Steve moved fast, he slammed Rhodes back against the lockers behind him and they shook under his weight, but it was enough to daze the cop in his grasp who was trying to get a hand on Steve’s throat.
“Rough day?” Tony asked softly, hoping the lightness of the sentence would let Steve know he came in peace.
“If you want, I’ll let you get a shot in.” Steve offered with a deadly smile, “Then you can die happy knowing you at least managed to draw some blood tonight.”
Steve raised a hand, motioning for everyone else to stay put in the living room whilst he moved into the hallway towards the front door. He clicked off the safety on his weapon, one hand reaching for the handle. He could shoot before their visitor had time to draw breath if he had too. He wasn’t in the mood to play games tonight.
Steve stayed where he was, “I love you, Tony Stark.” He told him, blue eyes shining, “Impossibly. Recklessly. Foolishly. Blissfully. I love you.”
This man would be keeping Steve on his toes tonight, he knew.
Was Steve really playing him this whole time? All those looks and kisses and sex that seemed to be breaking down both their walls and securing their intimacy. Was it all just nothing to Steve whilst it had meant everything to Tony? Steve had stood there and said the things he knew would hurt Tony, he’d thrown them at him with nothing more than a sorry and what was Tony meant to do with sorry now? Steve was standing there like the mob boss he was, the mob boss Tony had fallen for. Hadn’t he known what he was getting into?
“Well he shot my bike and made me kill a perfectly nice kid tonight so he needs to answer for that.” Steve responded. Sitwell started pleading again, his voice muffled as Bucky pushed him harder against the car headlight.
Steve softened, stepping closer to Tony. His cuffs rattled slightly as he moved. He dropped his head and Tony could see the shame wash over him, “You would have realised I wasn’t good enough for you. I’m not good enough for you.”
Steve smirked, “I figured you’d still be up. You always did burn the midnight oil.”
Thor heard shuffling to his left and swung the hammer up in his palm again. There was more work to be done.
He kissed him softly, tongue running along the seam of Tony’s lower lip to tease him. Tony, ever the impatient one, tried to deep the kiss. Steve resisted that temptation though. He wanted to commit every second to detail. His mouth mapped over Tony’s, tilting his head to deepen their kiss until Tony let out a small growl of frustration, pushing his own erection into Steve to make his point.
Tony was practically vibrating against him, body twitching with pleasure as Steve slammed back against him, watching as Tony’s hips thrust up against nothing in response.
Natasha turned to him, “I need you to focus, okay? Steve is smart and he’s strong. We have to believe that and get the job done.”
“Got a hunch.” Steve replied, “I’ll fill you in when I get back.”
Steve had gone to all of them in the past, at T’Challa’s insistence. He had charmed and persuaded his way into getting T’Challa the votes he needed to be able to make a difference in this city. A city they both loved and grew up in. Steve could remember the boy he was, all scabbed knees and bright eyes. A boy who was going to make a difference in the world. Then he had left for college, specialised in politics and realised just how hard that was to do. Steve chose to help Brooklyn with his fists, T’Challa chose to help by talking. They were still working towards the same goal and despite how different their lives had turned out; they had never lost respect for each other.
Thor stepped closer to Steve’s side, putting a hand on his shoulder, “We take the fight to Rumlow. We tear apart everyone standing in our way.”
“Okay.” Bucky bit out, “I trust you. I always trust you.”
“Not a scratch, okay? I built this thing single-handedly.” Tony told him as he stepped out onto the street.
“Tony will get through to him.” Thor replied with confidence.
Natasha nodded, “We will.”
She nodded, pulling her Glock out of its holster on her hip and handed it over to Steve, “You might need that. I’ll be upstairs if you need me. Clean-ups always faster with two.”
“Just like that, baby.” He preened and Steve rewarded him with an increase in pace and harder thrusts.
Steve knew that would get his attention, “I’m fine. He’s not. Clint needs us.”
“No. Hospital.” Bucky repeated, “Rumlow. Steve, he…”
Steve had clearly had worse luck, but Tony was thankful he was here. Alive. With them.
Steve backed away slowly, keeping his eyes on Rumlow’s body as he went. Howard was still there, lifeless and grey. Steve didn’t even stop to pick up his gun. He needed fresh air.
Fury had locked the door behind them, giving Steve space.
Tony.
Fuck.
“Infatuation?” Tony scoffed, “Nice.”
Steve wasn’t sure he had the fight in him to stop him anymore. It was ebbing out of him with every minute as he climbed the stairs to his room to change out of his joggers. Is this what his downfall looked like? When they came for him, Rumlow or Ross, whoever reached him first would they be disappointed to see the shell of the man he once was. No fight left in him. Would they pity him or dig the knife in deeper?
Ross gave him a small smirk that made Tony want to run, “Not exactly. I’m here to offer you a choice, Mr Stark. A choice I’m sure your Captain would want you to accept.”
Natasha kept walking, “I don’t know.”
“Shortly after he got to town.” Rumlow replied, “I knew you were working with the cop, figured I’d do one better.”
Now, he just had to face Steve.
Bucky frowned, reaching into his pocket for the lighter he always carried. Steve knew he hadn’t smoked since before the army, but he still carried a lighter, flipping the lid and striking the fuse repeatedly if he was anxious the way Steve would pace. He passed it to Steve, the cold metal heavy in his palm.
Steve frowned, “That body bag already has your name on it, I’d hate to steal it from you.”
Tony was tugging at his belt now, undoing it with nimble fingers and popping the button on Steve’s trousers but that wouldn’t do because all that skin was calling to him and Steve always got what he wanted. He bent his head, tongue flicking out against one of Tony’s nipples before he mouthed kisses down along his ribs. Tony sighed happily, shutting his eyes at the feeling of Steve’s mouth on him.
Steve jerked into his hand, “If you keep that up I’m coming to come before I’m inside you.” He cautioned.
“Sorry, sir.” She told Tony with a smile, “You don’t have an appointment.”
They kept dancing; Tony’s eyes barely glanced down at Steve’s sleeve again. Steve couldn’t stop thinking about it though. Was Tony disgusted? He was still here though. Was he really okay with it? Tony tucked his head into Steve’s shoulder then, bringing them closer together. Steve kept swaying not wanting to disrupt their bubble, his lips grazed Tony’s ear.
Steve felt himself relax and Tony along with him, he continued running the sponge over Tony’s abs as Tony settled back into his position, “Tony, I spent years trying to cleanse the streets of Brooklyn with the blood on my knuckles but you, you’re doing it with a literal beacon of light in the dark. You’re the most remarkable man I’ve ever met.”
“Completely serious,” Steve replied, eyes hard and unyielding, “I can have it done by lunchtime?”
Sam continued anyway, “Bucky told me it was a one-time thing.”
“Tony, my boy!” He greeted, straightening up in his seat as Tony eyed the alcohol with a tight stomach, “We’re celebrating a new deal going through. Have a glass.”
The smile that answered him was warm and friendly, “You’re right on time. Cap had to head over and help Sam with some heavy lifting at the bar, but he should be back soon. I’m Bruce, I’ll take you to your playground for the day.”
He disappeared into the crowd to find Tony, as much as he wanted to have a proper chat with T’Challa and talk about old times he knew this wasn’t the time. T’Challa couldn’t appear to be too friendly with The Captain at his own gala or it might cost him more votes than Steve could win. They needed to appear on talking terms, a silent statement that T’Challa would be able to reason with The Captain if needed but no so friendly as to suggest he was in his back pocket.
Coward. He should have told Tony everything. That Rumlow knew who he was. That they were fucked but he couldn’t. He wanted one more night like this. One more night with Tony so carefree and happy and with him. He wanted to be selfish for a little while longer.
Steve hurled the phone at the wall in anger, the device bouncing off the wall with a crack to land uselessly on the floor. It didn’t make him feel any better, but it didn’t make him feel any worse either.
Steve sighed, “You want to stay in the car?”
Steve placed another kiss on the centre of his chest, “You ready for me?”
“Right.” Tony found himself breathing easily, he grabbed the mug from her hands, letting the steam curl into the air, “So, he thinks he should have talked Steve out of getting involved with me?”
The arc reactor tech was old, and Tony had only gotten a glimpse of it as a blueprint in his dad's office, but it was enough to intrigue Tony with the possibilities of a self-sustaining energy core. Howard had scrapped the project after about two months of failed attempts, there was never enough money in peace for his father's liking. Tony felt differently, he filled up notebooks full of calculations and elementary theories on how he could get something like the arc reactor to work without becoming nuclear. He had given himself a head start, despite it being years since he had looked into the technology as anything more than a hobby but Tony was good. He was very good.
“Steve.” Tony whispered.
Men and their fucking egos.
Steve chuckled, “Will you, Tony Stark, with all your endearing sass and bedroom eyes, do me the honour of accompanying a no-good scoundrel like me to this gala as my date for the evening?”
“It doesn’t matter. I’m here to save your ass anyway.” Tony sniffed, “Because the team needs you. We can’t stop Hydra without you. Not now. We need to break you out.”
Steve’s face flashed in Tony’s mind, the way he looked so helpless and guilty as the police hauled him away from Tony at the shipment yard. Beard and cheeks smattered with blood, blue eyes so full of emotion Tony wanted to choke.
He didn’t think he’d ever had sex that good that he could still feel it the next morning, that toe-curling kind of stuff that left him replaying various bits of it through his head. He swung his legs over the side of the bed, he needed coffee.
Tony nodded, “Is there anything else I should know before we kiss and make up?”
Tony scoffed, “Fuck you.” His eyes drifted to the house again.
Stark Industries was a skyscraper to the masses in the heart of New York, Howard Stark’s own personal throne and Tony knew that’s where his father would be. Bucky was a silent companion for the most part, sitting in the passenger seat of Tony’s car after they had gone to pick it up like a phantom that might disappear at any moment. The silence was stifling, and Tony couldn’t help but glance at Bucky every now and again to check he was still there.
Steve wanted to laugh, a smile gracing his lips as Tony’s fingers wiped away the stray tear on his cheek, “Tony, I… can I kiss you?”
Steve shook his head, “No.”
When he was finished, Rumlow would be certain of that too.
Tony rose to stand at his full height again, eyes on the arc reactor shining softly in his palm, "Well, what do you know?" He muttered softly, "Maybe I am my father's son after all." He couldn't help the bitterness in his voice at that thought, the idea that he was anything like Howard never sat well with him.
“Someone branded him?” Steve asked with an eyebrow, “That’s new.”
Steve wasted no time in swirling his fingers into his mouth, coating them in his own spit until they were slick enough. Tony was panting with the build-up, aware of every movement Steve made. His cock bobbed against his stomach, eager and hot and red.
Steve sighed, “Sulfur, charcoal and potassium nitrate. The three main ingredients found in gunpowder.”
Or would he try and explain what it was that drew him to Steve like a forest fire despite knowing he’d only get burned? How could Tony put into words the way Steve made him feel. The way Steve saw him for who he was as well as everything he was trying to be. Rhodey was great, he was Tony’s biggest cheerleader for turning his life around, but Rhodey only ever focused on the potential of Tony Stark. On everything Tony could become if he tried.
Sitwell slid out of the car with ease and another burly man followed him out soon after, eyes clocking Steve immediately. Steve narrowed his eyes at Sitwell, his slighter frame doing nothing to intimidate Steve. He wasn’t the leader of Hydra; they hadn’t had one since Steve had drowned Schmidt over the side of the pier last year. Perhaps that was why Sitwell wasn’t keen on meeting there.
“Thanks for that, it was getting rough in there.” Clint greeted when he approached Steve, making himself comfortable against the same car.
“Go to Hell.” Tony snarled, stepping closer as the blood in his ears pounded, “I will
“You could ask for anything you want right now, and you worry about other people?” Ross frowned, “That sounds a little naïve to me.”
“It’s amazing, Tony.” Steve said, hands running over the paintwork, he could barely feel the dent now, “Thanks for getting it done so quickly.”
Steve looked down at the lifeless body of Howard Stark, blood pooling from the bullet in his head and coating the soles of Rumlow’s boots. He didn’t seem to notice, stepping over the body without so much as a glance.
When had Tony Stark become something of an addiction to him? Their kiss in the garage? The night they slept together? Somewhere between talking and snarking at each other?
“You really think I’d be living here if he was the monster everyone sees him as?” Bruce asked, “He’s a tortured soul, that’s for sure. He isn’t a good man, he needed to survive, and he couldn’t do both, but he isn’t a monster. I don’t believe that, even if he does.”
They were talking to a diplomat and his wife when Steve noticed something out of the corner of his eye that wasn’t quite right. The wife was telling a story about their home décor construction and Tony was responding in all the right places, but Steve’s attention was on the man at the back of the hall, near the exit. He was tall, sandy hair and a pressed grey suit. Pierce. Steve knew that face, he’d been to a meeting with Sitwell before. Hydra. Steve frowned, excusing himself from the conversation with a hand on Tony’s elbow to say he’d be back and then he was moving. Why would Hydra be here? They didn’t normally have a hand in politics. Pierce was definitely mingling though, a phone in his hand as he excused himself from his present company and headed outside, typing on his phone.
Tony, that one was the killer, the one thing Steve couldn’t make peace with despite having days in a cell to do just that. He’d seen the look in his eyes at the docks, Steve had hurt him and for that he would never forgive himself. He would add that to the list of sins Ross was no doubt about the discuss with him.
“I’m coming with you.” Natasha replied, wiping her eyes with her hand.
The door opened and drew Steve’s attention back into the room. Ross wasn’t what he imagined, he was older and his face sharper than Steve had pictured. Fury was in the room with him, taking a seat on the other side of the table to Steve without so much as sparing him with a glance. He almost looked uncomfortable to be there; Steve wondered why that was.
“Can’t you hire someone to help?” Steve asked.
When Tony woke up he instantly reached out to pull the covers closer to his chest, the morning chill had a bite to it that not even the walls of the condo could fight off. His hand hit solid flesh in his quest for more covers and Tony blinked his eyes open. The events of last night came back to him in a swirl, breaking through his sleepy haze.
Sam cut in, brows furrowed, “Back up, who’s Tony?”
“Steve, I can’t do this job without you and I really don’t want to have to watch your trial. Orange isn’t your colour.”
When was the last time he was this turned on by just making out with someone?
Fury shook his head, grabbing Steve’s arm and drawing him over into a corner for privacy, “Ross is dead. Tony killed him.”
“Captain.” Ross sneered the name at him with malice.
“It will help with the burn.” Steve commented gently.
“Well, when you stop drawing Bambi eyes, this came for you early.” Bucky replied, pulling an envelope out of his pocket and passing it to Steve.
Steve shifted slightly, Tony felt every movement, “Have you thought about what that means? I’m a mob boss, Tony. I’m always going to be that. I kill people, I hurt them. I’m not the guy you can bring home to meet the family.”
“Bucky, I need this done. They took him because of me so you get Thor and you get down to the fucking docks. I need to know Tony is there before I go in and get my hands dirty. If he isn’t and Rumlow finds out I’m coming, then he’ll kill him.”
“That’s what they tell me.”
“I took care of it, I promise.” Steve told him, “I’m sorry I ruined the evening.”
“There were talks from higher up the food chain about what to do if Ross failed. I was put on Ross’ taskforce to evaluate how he ran it and the level of its success. I was offered a chance at a promotion if Ross couldn’t get the job done. I’d be heading a unit that specialises in gang crime and gang violence. A way to learn and prevent this type of crime as it grows. If you’re right about Ross then I’m about to land that job.”
Tony sighed softly, “I think I can persuade him. I seem to be doing a lot of that today.”
Tony swallowed thickly, “You want to sell them?”
He pulled back when Tony released him, letting his hand drop from Tony’s jaw with a smirk at his red mouth from Steve’s handiwork, “You might be the best error in judgement I’ve ever had.” Tony told him roughly.
Phillips got comfortable and complacent. He was cocky and arrogant and it got him killed. Steve wasn’t about to make that same mistake.
“I need to come.” Tony whispered harshly into his ear.
Steve shot his first bullet right into the neck of the guy he promised would die first. Steve was a man of his word. Everyone else charged or fired.
Steve gave his shoulder a kiss, “Natasha went into cleaning mode. I put them all on my desk.”
Steve would come for him, like he promised he would. It was nearing on one in the morning now so Clint had no more than another hour to waste staring at the drab grey walls and the dark two-way glass before a cop came in to tell him he was free to go with an annoyed expression. Clint would smile wide and joyful, because had they really not expected The Captain to protect his own? And he’d stretch his limbs, flip them off and stroll out of the precinct with his head high.
“Do you want this, yes or no?” Tony challenged.
“Fuck you.” Steve spat.
“Look how that turned out.”
Natasha nodded, "You have the power here, Rumlow wants it. He has to go through you to get it, Steve. You really going to give it up without a fight."
Steve struggled, bringing an arm up to block the hit coming his way.
“Thanks for coming.” Steve told him and he hated out much that made it sound like a business transaction.
Steve beamed, “That’s wonderful, sweetheart.”
Steve smiled, "That's what they all say. That's good, at least I know you won't piss yourself when I kill you."
“Not involved.” Tony replied, “If you think he’s coming for me then you’re going to be disappointed. He doesn’t give a shit.”
He watched, the ticking sound from the clock marking the passage of time. Ross might have thought this was his show but Steve knew better. It was
Tony was firm though, eyes sparking to life, “We could go anyway. Get a car and drive. Nevada, Boston, Chicago. Anywhere you want to go, I’m in.”
Steve was shaking as he came down from his high, the effort of keeping himself upright becoming painful as he felt Tony move his hand from his cock because he was probably oversensitive by now. He tucked his leg back underneath Steve’s arm and pulled Steve down towards him, letting him take the weight off his arm.
He slid in the third finger, the lube making it easier as well as the prep from Tony’s own fingers. Steve still took his time with this part, listening to the catch in Tony’s breath and savouring the way Tony pushed his hips back into Steve’s hand. He was eager and impatient for Steve’s cock and that made his balls tight and his cock jerk as he slid his hand out.
Steve nodded, “Clean disposal on this one, we don’t need Hydra finding out we’re kidnapping their foot soldiers and killing them.”
Tony linked their fingers together, “You stay, I stay.”
Kissing a mobster, one he barely knew was a bad decision. Horrible really, yet here he was, late for work and still thinking about the feel of The Captain’s –
He should have known, that gut feeling he told Natasha about was there and never normally wrong. He was worried about a gang war but if Hydra was coming after his team then Steve knew he’d do whatever it took to stop them. Whoever the new leader was, he was smart. Smart enough to know he needed to make Steve weaker before he could attack him directly. The idea was probably to frame The Avengers for the killings, the police would start to round up the other members which would leave Steve missing half his family and vulnerable to attack.
“Ah, finally back with us, are you?” His voice was rough and indifferent and Tony found himself frowning, “I thought maybe Jenkins hit you too hard.”
Steve bristled, “You let him go?!”
Steve beamed, unable to help himself, eyes turning to Natasha where she was perched on the chair of Thor’s chair, “Nat?”
Bruce pressed the rod to Bucky’s arm. Bucky started screaming, his whole body jerking before he passed out. The sound of sizzling hot metal burning into flesh filled the room and the scent of burning skin hit Steve’s nose with such a force his eyes watered, and he had to look away as Bruce continued his work on Bucky’s arm.
There was just enough time to see Pierce’s eyes grow wide before Steve brought the blade down on his wrist, it took three hacks as the knife was smaller than he’d normally use for this kind of work but the army had taught him well. He knew where to cut to remove a hand from someone’s body. Pierce screamed so loud Steve had to shove his arm against him mouth to muffle the sounds. This wouldn’t be a good type of evening entertainment for T’Challa’s guests.
Pathetic.
“How’s Buck?”
“Is it working?” Tony retorted, tugging insistently so Steve had no choice but to remove his hands from Tony’s body so they could get his shirt off.
“You wouldn’t go to the press.” Howard mused, “You’re too proud, Tony. You get that from me, you know? You don’t want anyone to see you as the victim, it’s why you haven’t told them yet.”
Steve wasn’t sure what he was expecting when he arrived at the docks for two in the afternoon, his leather jacket on his frame to protect him for the biting cold of the day but it wasn’t to see Detective Inspector Fury waiting to greet him, looking out to the sea like he was enjoying a rare day off. Briefly Steve wondered whether this was a trap, the gun tucked into the waistband of his jeans seemed like a tempting option but he held back. Fury wouldn’t have gone to all this trouble of secrecy and discretion to get Steve to meet him just to arrest him, especially not when he knew Steve would be out in a few hours.
“Don’t worry. We handled it. Two hours, alright? Get ready to walk out of there.” Steve promised before ending the call.
There was something in Thor’s tone, deadly and grim, that had Steve moving to collect his boxers from the floor and shove his legs through them. He was off the bed as soon as they were on his hips and he grabbed a pair of grey joggers off the same chair Tony had stolen his t-shirt from as he followed Thor out of the room, shoving the joggers on his legs as he went.
In truth, Tony wasn’t sure he was ready for this. To confront Howard and waltz into Stark Industries as his son returning home for the first time in years. He needed to do it though, Howard was working with Hydra and if they had any chance of stopping Hydra and Rumlow then they needed to get Howard on side. Once again, his father held all the cards.
Steve chuckled then, watching as Tony unknotted his own tie and used it to tie Steve’s other wrist to the headboard behind him. Steve let him do it, tested out the restraint when Tony had finished to make sure it was secure enough.
Fury frowned, “You sent a sample to the lab?”
Steve knew what they were doing. They were goading him, challenging him, baiting him. It wasn't going to work; he wasn't playing this game with them.
Then all hell broke loose.
The door swung open behind them but neither paid any attention. Tony had the device in his hand, fingers pushing under Steve’s ugly orange t-shirt quickly.
He laughed, “You googled me?”
“I didn’t think you were going to come for me.” Tony admitted softly, “I wasn’t expecting you to.”
Steve could tell the exact moment the teasing got too much for the mechanic. Tony shifted in his lap, arms coming up to wrap around his shoulders until Steve felt Tony’s fingers burrow into the hair at the nape of his neck. He was pulling Steve closer, grinding harder against him desperately for something more.
On his knees, his mouth moved lower, tongue tasting its way down Tony’s abs as they jumped under his touch. Steve’s hands came up to dig his fingers into the material of Tony’s jeans, hooking into the waistband to pull them and his boxers down together. He went slowly, reveal inch by inch of new skin as his mouth followed the trail his hand had created. Tony’s hands were in his hair, softly gripping as he gasped, feeling Steve’s hot breath on his dick. He let the jeans pool at Tony’s ankles, his mouth moving back up to nip at his defined hipbones as Tony kicked off his shoes, jeans and boxers in one mangled heap.
Fury’s locker was a mess, empty spray cans and dirty laundry shoved in the bottom along with his gym bag and some files that hadn’t been looked after at all. Steve wanted to crinkle his nose at the smell but held back. He found a NYPD waterproof rain jacket on the shelf, clumsily folded up and Steve shook it out. It would be a little small, but it would have to do. He found a baseball cap underneath the gym bag and placed that into his pile as well. There were no trousers and Steve wasn’t sure he’d fit in them even if he found any so he’d have to make the orange ones work. This should be enough to get him out the door.
Bucky nodded sharply and was out of there before Steve could utter another word. He’d go to Sam’s and rant and calm down and when he came back later, he’d be more reasonable, Steve knew. Natasha stayed for a moment, eyes on Steve like she wanted to say more.
When he was done, he moved back into the bedroom with as much silence as he could. The house below seemed eerily quiet from the landing, but Tony was sure someone at least was up. This wasn’t a house of late risers.
Steve shuffled in his seat, cuffs chaffing his wrists, “My family. I walk a fine line between who I am and who I never want to be. They keep me on the right side of that line. Whatever I became, it would have happened a lot sooner and a lot worse if it wasn’t for them.”
“How do you know how to do that?” Steve asked, voice thick and gruff.
“Stark Industries. Howard’s death is all over the news. You just inherited the company and became a billionaire.” Rhodey told him softly.
The sirens came suddenly and called to him like a final bell toll. This was it; The Captain was about to meet his maker. There might be eyes scouting out the noise and he hoped Rumlow was watching. He needed him to see this. He needed him to know what the end looked like.
“We’ve all killed someone in this job.” Fury sighed, “I still remember your first kill on the job. You couldn’t sleep right for months.”
“He said he needed to go see Howard.” Natasha said, “Get him on side to use against Hydra.”
He took the papers, tucking them into his jacket, “Let me deal with Stark. I’ll get my team on it. You stay clean and maybe we all walk away from this.”
Tony moaned into it as he felt Steve’s hips thrust up against his rock-hard cock. Steve tore his mouth from Tony’s to work kisses into the side of his jaw, “You need to meet the team properly. I need to tell them you’re with us.”
He examined the photos from the crime scene in meticulous detail, inch by inch. The body looked too staged and there was no blood or signs of a control at the docks so it had been placed there. Steve wondered if the police had worked that out already? They tended to be a bit slow. The mark itself was indeed the Avengers symbol, a large ‘A’ that had been first designed by Steve on a napkin at Phillip’s request for some kind of gang tag. The mark itself was sloppy and hastily done, clearly done while the victim was still alive and moving judging from the awkward shift in the lines and how some parts were deeper than others.
Steve sighed, he knew T’Challa’s help wouldn’t come without a cost and whilst he had always supported T’Challa’s political campaign and run for office he absolutely hated having to go to his galas and functions to strong arm him some of the more difficult votes. Steve hated public appearances of anything, especially when they involved a tux and a fake interest in other people’s political views.
Tony nodded, “I am very smart. I’m also impulsive, reckless on occasion and according to my best friend I have the capacity to make terrible decisions for a smart person.”
Fury wasn’t amused, “Another body was found last night. PC Phil Coulson. One of mine. Found in a carpark over on Madison. Bullet to the head, big ‘A’ carved into his chest.”
“It’s risky,” Natasha sighed, “Too many variables. We don’t know what cell he’s in. We don’t know what kind of watch Ross has him under. Too many cameras. No way to get him out.”
Steve could imagine Natasha’s recoil at the statement, her voice lower than before, “I had an abortion, Bucky. It was the right thing to do.”
Steve shot back, his last bullet dodging into the guy's forehead. It was a kill shot and the body fell to the floor in a heap.
Rhodey blinked twice, “Who?”
Thor surveyed the damage around him, bodies piled up throughout the length of the corridor with blood and brain matter decorating the walls and the floor. There were even splatters of it on the ceiling, a new personal best.
“We found another body. Same as before, cop on duty, ‘A’ carved into his chest.” Fury told him bitterly, “They’re calling in Special Branch. It’s their case now.”
“I promise you. Together, win or lose. Every decision we make from now on.”
“I hope so.” Steve sighed, “If I don’t, Ross won’t have to worry about me because I’ll be dead.”
Tony opened his eyes to see they were indeed at his condo building, that had been fast.
He threw the envelope down on the kitchen table, a dull thud echoing through the room. Bruce moved to reach for it as he was closest, tucked into a chair with a tired expression and a grim line set into his mouth. Clint was opposite him at the table, with Bucky seated in the middle. Bucky was cold and switched off, not that Steve could blame him. He only knew the half of it. He leaned back into his chair with his arms crossed, a silent display mocking Steve from where he stood at the head of the table. Natasha was perched on the counter, never one to use a chair when any other surface would do. Sam leaned up against the counter next to her, he was clearly confused but Steve saw past it to the worry in his eyes. Thor was leaning against the back door, an imposing figure of strength. He always seemed to gravitate towards the exit, like he needed to be the first to chase after whatever was coming to hurt this family.
“Yes, fuck, Steve, yes.” Tony growled out, shoving his ass back against Steve’s crotch.
Natasha had told him that very same thing once, hadn’t she?
Howard had been angry that Tony had destroyed it, but he had been angrier that Tony had managed to figure it out when he hadn’t. It was the proof he needed that Tony might end up succeeding him one day. That he might be even more brilliant than even Howard Stark. That wasn’t something Howard would have ever allowed to happen while he was alive.
Steve shook his head, “We didn’t sign…”
“I used to think so, too.” He heard Bucky called out softly as he started up the stairs for his much-needed shower.
Tony nodded, “When I see him again, I might just kill him first for all of this bullshit.”
Steve had his back to Tony as he made his way down the stairs of the garage. It was the same as ever, vintage cars ferociously shiny and on display, the overflowing workbench in the corner that probably had a gun taped to the underside. Even the darker patch that had once been blood was still there, just a darker grey now like it had been painted over so the chemicals could erode what was left of the DNA.
Steve was sure he heard that wrong, “We always…”
“I’m his son.” Tony replied with a scowl.
Tony nodded, “We all make mistakes.”
Steve sighed as Tony undid his belt, “Do you want this? Me, do you want me?”
Tony took the phone with a small nod, “Are you sure we don’t need to go to the hospital for that?” He nodded towards Steve’s side.
“Your father put his cigarettes out on your back?” Tony could hear the anger in Steve’s voice.
“You think I’m a threat to him?” Tony asked.
“Then you should have come to us. Your family.”
Hiring Peter as his apprentice was another good decision. Rhodey disagreed but screw him, he didn’t always know best. Peter was a great kid who needed a little extra money to help his Aunt May out and needed somewhere to work on his ideas and designs. Tony had given him both and more importantly, he liked having the kid around. He worked hard and was good company. Plus, he was a hit with the ladies who were always pinching his cheeks despite the fact Peter was 17 and hated it.
And Tony was giving him a soft smile despite knowing all of that. He was biting his bottom lip, like he was unsure of what to say next and all Steve wanted to do in that moment was lean over and kiss him.
“I’ll come after them next.” Rumlow told him as he struggled to overpower Steve. They were locked in a stalemate fighting for dominance.
“I’m sorry I ever made you doubt that this was anything other than that. A relationship. A partnership. That’s all I wanted, and I was a coward who didn’t want you to get dragged into my crap but I know I should have let you make that decision for yourself. I was scared you’d leave if I did.”
make it.” Tony spat, “And now, for once in your life, you’re going to do the right thing. You’re going to go to the police and tell them about the Jericho, about Rumlow’s plans, Hydra. Everything. You’re going to stand up as a witness against them and help get him off the streets because you owe me that, dad. That’s the least you owe me.”
“None of your business.” Tony snarled, pushing off the wall with the heel of his foot.
“Hey, I’m going to take it. I just didn’t want to make a big decision like that without talking to you or the team first.” Steve explained, “I’m not making anymore decisions without you. Partners, right?”
Steve moved them in the small space until he was standing under the spray and he tipped his head back, letting the water run through his hair and down his face. He felt Tony’s hands working through his hair, unknotting it and washing out any blood that was there before moving to his beard.
He sighed, hitting the button on his computer and stepping away from the screen. It was just a kiss, the guy was dangerous and Tony always was drawn to dangerous. Still, this would be a crazy story to tell people about and he would move on with his life and it would be fine.
“Steve?” He asked roughly, his voice sleepily but decidedly more awake.
His hammer was a mess of slick red blood, creating a dribbling trail next to him that carved out his path of destruction.
Steve stared at his friend then. Sam, so strong and brave and true. A spitfire of a fighter in the army and a loyal friend. It would hurt Steve to leave him behind.
“We can come back one day, when the heat dies down. Give it a few years and people will forget about The Captain. They’ll think you retired or died. They’ll stop looking. They’ll stop caring. We can come back; the whole family can be free of this nightmare.” Tony insisted.
Tony’s eyes sparkled, “That’s what I thought.”
“I came for you.” Steve told him firmly.
Tony had slipped past so many of his defences though, what was one more crumbling wall between them now?
“Nice to meet you, Peter.” Steve greeted.
“You said you were in the army, right? So, you killed people long before you became a mob boss. If I judged you on killing now then I’d have to judge the way the army trains men to kill people as well and I’m not nearly drunk enough for that conversation.” Tony replied with a smile, eyes twinkling under the dim light of the bar.
“We have 36 hours before Ross gets the green light for a kill order on us. We have to deal with Rumlow and be in the wind before he gets it.” Steve told them, “Bucky is at the docks gaining intel. We need to take this fight to Rumlow. I need him alive. If we can deliver him to the police then maybe it will keep them busy enough to give us a head start.”
“You kept your word, didn’t you?” Fury pointed out, “You helped me with Hydra. You stopped Rumlow. In exchange for your word I promised you immunity, I kept my word too. You don’t have to accept the job with me, the immunity will still stand. Just know, this job is the only way I can guarantee you all stay together and walk out of this. Without it, immunity is a mixed bag. Witness protection at best, you’d all be separated. You’d never see Tony again.”
Steve couldn’t help the chuckle that he let out, hands reaching for Tony’s smooth skin again as he moved him back towards the bed, “Do they have an article for my skills in the bedroom?”
"No, you're not." Natasha cut in, "You keep telling us that all you want is to protect us. You gave us a home and a family, Steve. You found us, every single one of us and you chose us to be a part of this empire you wanted to build. Why can't you believe that we chose you too? That we'd want to protect you just as much as you want to protect us?"
“No, but you are fucking his son, aren’t you?” Rumlow cooed, “You want someone to blame for your man losing his arm? Look no further. You see, after Tony went to see his father about making a deal to testify against me, Howard here, well he came straight to me. He double crossed you and his own son for the money and glory I was offering. Isn’t the right, Howard?” Rumlow kicked him again.
He studied his best friend then, the dark circles under his eyes and the messy bun that his hair was in. He was still in a t-shirt and dark grey joggers and Steve wondered if he had even been to bed yet or if he was up all night waiting for him to come home. Bucky always felt like it was his responsibility to look out for Steve and he knew it was a responsibility he took seriously. He had been doing it since they were boys and Steve lost his mother to pneumonia after a harsh Brooklyn winter where they couldn’t afford heating in their tiny apartment.
So, when Tony walked into the shop with a coffee in his hands to see Peter in the entrance way playing laser tag with a stray cat, he figured he shouldn’t have been surprised. He had the laser pointer from the office and was waving it wildly around the pavement for his new furry friend to chase. Tony was sure the kid was enjoying it more than the cat at this point, the look of pure glee on his face was a sight to behold.
“What makes you think I’m army?” Steve asked with a smile.
“Of course.” Adam replied, looking over at Steve for a moment, “I thought you were working with Rhodes on this one?”
“I know who you are. Maybe it’s time to let Steve Rogers have a go? Run away with me.”
“Not going to be a problem.” Fury sighed, “Come on.”
The Hydra man spat blood as his face hit the floor and to Steve’s surprise he actually tried to sit up, using his good arm for leverage as he righted himself into a sitting position with his back against the side of one of the vintage cars in Steve’s collection. Steve almost wanted to like the guy. Almost.
“Thank you all for coming,” Steve addressed them room, “I know being here in the middle of the day is less than ideal.” His eyes were on Sam and Bruce on the sofa as he spoke those words, knowing they both had jobs to uphold.
Steve nodded, “I’m sorry about your father.”
“I think so. For a little while. It calms me down.” Steve said softly.
Steve felt the icy grip of fear in his chest at Rumlow’s words, getting to his feet with shaky steps, “What are you talking about?” He demanded.
Tony gasped, perfectly still for a moment as Steve’s eyes flicked to his, those brown eyes daring and excited and that was all it took for Steve to surge forward.
Steve stood straight, putting his own hands in his pockets so Tony couldn’t see them shake. Tony seemed to sense something was off, keeping some distance between them instead of closing the gap like he normally would.
The mob boss and the mechanic, how would have thought it?
Steve smiled, oh how far they’d come. Him and Tony. Survivors to the bitter end and yet here, in the steamy bathroom of Steve’s house. Their home. They found the chance to be so much more than that. Steve leaned down to kiss him again, capturing Tony’s lips softly.
"Then I'm not signing." Natasha replied.
“T’challa, is that anyway to speak to an old friend?” Steve cut him off. The wind was biting against his cheek as he crossed the deserted street, pushing the phone tighter to his ear.
His stomach was in knots, Tony had spent the night at his own place after working late last night as it was closer to SI than Steve’s was and it killed him to know how nervous Tony was about this press conference whilst knowing there was nothing he could do to support him other than send a text Tony probably wouldn’t get until it was over.
“What are you…?”
And it was. Natasha and Bucky weren’t the only ones healing and it made Steve’s heart warm to see Tony so happy after everything he’d been through. Maybe now he was starting to believe there was a way through this. One small step at a time.
Tony smirked, making a show of breathing hot air over Steve’s dick just to watch it twitch at the sensation before he ran his tongue over the base. Steve’s head fell back, the moan escaping his lips was pure pleasure and Tony couldn’t help but do it again just to watch the way Steve shook against the restraints.
. He was sitting here in this room at Ross’ mercy because he’d made it so. He’d told Fury where’d he’d be. He set this up. That was why Steve was going to win. He held his power quietly whilst Ross boasted about his from the rooftops. A smug man never stayed on top long.
“Hello?” He answered with the phone to his ear, Bucky was watching him with questioning eyes.
Bruce swallowed thickly, eyes on Bucky, “Heat. Clint, in the garage there are some iron pokers. I need you to get one, burn it over the oven, gas up all the way. Wait until it’s glowing orange and bring it to me quickly.”
“Shh.” Tony cut him off, “That’s enough for now. Let’s just shower and get some sleep, okay?”
Tony nodded, “Copper wire, three inches thick. About a metre. A coffee, black, no sugar and some palladium. 8mg.”
“What you should be concerning yourself with is how you’re going to pull that trigger without a hand.” Steve replied.
Ross stopped short for a second but then the smile was back in place, “Arrest them all. No immunity deals this time Captain.”
“Well, he’s an idiot.” She gave him a wide smile like she’d just shared a secret, “And he was wrong. He probably knows it too. I told you, Steve loves to protect everyone else by throwing his ass in the fire. It’s just what he does.”
This was different.
“Is Tony okay?” Steve asked instead, mind reeling. He couldn’t focus on anything else, not the lifeline Fury had offered him slipping through his fingers, not even his own fate. His mind was a constant buzz of Tony, Tony, Tony.
Natasha frowned, “Howard? Why?”
Two guys left. No more bullets.
And to make matters worse Tony had given him his number like it was just a random guy he met at the bar. Steve was damn fine, for sure, and a great kisser and so cocky Tony wondered if he were like that in bed. Nope, bad ideas.
“I’m working with Fury to help bring down Hydra.” Steve told him, voice cold and hard. He had to keep his compose now, he had to make Bucky understand what was at stake.
Killing a man had effected Tony in a way that not even Steve could predict. He woke up screaming and struggling most nights, that fear and horror at the realisation of what he had done sending him into a panic attack. Ragged breathing and shaking and Steve could do nothing but stay with him as he rode it out, getting him to match his breathing to Steve’s and muttering reassuring words to him until he came back to himself. It tore Steve’s heart out and it didn’t seem to be showing any signs of stopping. It was one of the reasons Steve hated it when Tony spent the night at home alone, he worried that he’d have a nightmare and be by himself. Steve would break house arrest for him in a second if Tony needed him but he knew Tony better than that. He wouldn’t call, he’d suffer in silence until morning and then try and play it off like it was nothing.
The beeper of the coffee pot sounded, and Natasha was back to her work, Tony could smell the coffee as it hit his nose, “Is that why Bucky’s angry? He thinks Steve is making a mistake?”
There was another thud as Steve approached the door, this one weaker than the last. Steve watched a hand smack against the pane of the glass, red smears staining it as the hand dropped from view.
“I won’t have an arm.” Bucky grit out.
“What do you think? There’s a lot to discuss if you’re in but I need to know now, before Ross comes in here to interview you. Once you’re on the record, this gets harder.”
Steve let his hands slip from the sides of the tub under the water, “Fury’s idea. Time to say goodbye to The Captain.” He felt almost nervous despite the fact Tony was getting naked a few feet from him.
Ross didn’t appreciate having his interview taken over, “I’ll get Hydra too, don’t worry.”
“Clint. He’s fine.” Tony reassured him, watching as Steve’s shoulders uncurled slightly at the news, “But it’s war now. Rumlow found Clint and Sam searching for the base of operations. He thinks the Avengers made a move to attack him.”
“Maybe I like danger?” Tony responded, “Don’t worry, Cap. I can handle myself.” He was biting his bottom lip again, his eyes darker than before.
“You do from cigarettes.” Tony sighed, “Perfect little circles burned into the skin.”
“We need to focus on our own survival right now, and we need your head clear to do that. The best thing you can do for your mechanic is to let him carry on with his danger-free life.”
Bucky was silent in the room, standing near the window looking at his feet. Steve’s eyes went to him now, he was the last to cast his vote and Steve was worried by his omission from the group discussion.
The worry blooming in his chest gave way to anger, raging through his veins like an inferno. Someone had hurt Tony; someone had taken him from his home. Steve knew this had to be related to him, a small-town mechanic – no matter how brilliant – wasn’t the type to have many enemies. Steve was. Steve had plenty of them, and right at the top of that list was Hydra.
“It’s blank.” Steve repeated.
Ross’ body stuttered, giving up the fight that Tony had won. His body went lax as Tony pulled the letter opener out with a shaky hand, more blood gushing down his hand and onto the floor between them.
The last thing he remembered was his hands being tied behind his back.
“Was that a gunshot?” He asked dumbly.
Tony was a monster now.
Steve nodded, tearing his lips away from Tony’s skin so he could look him in the eye as his hands worked their way down to the hem of his t-shirt.
He was Tony Goddamn Stark, and his father would never be able to break him.
“Where the hell have you been?” Bucky asked as Steve closed the door behind him, he couldn’t help but feel like a teenager being caught sneaking home past curfew.
“He had a meeting with Hydra’s leader this morning, we didn’t see a face or hear a name, but it was definitely him. Four-man escort to the meeting and he was in there for over an hour. Bucky got sick of waiting it out and decided to engage.” Natasha told him.
Tony swallowed nervously, “Yeah, he’s heading to see Fury. I need to get to work.”
Tony hummed, slipping out of his trousers and kicking off his shoes, “Is that really all we are?”
Tony was still moving against him, grinding his hips every chance he got to heighten his friction and keep Steve inside him for a little while longer and Steve lost some of his own control because his own hips were stuttering upwards to increase his thrusts. The combination of Tony’s mouth against his earlobe and his cock filling him was too much.
If only everything could be that easy.
Steve quickly pocketed his phone, “This is our stop.”
Steve couldn’t help but smile, “You’re a hell of a mechanic.”
Steve nodded, “A leader, a plan, anything that points them towards the cop killings.” He rubbed a hand over his beard, he really needed that shower, “Can I trust you and Nat to do this? Or should I pair you up with Clint?”
Steve cut him off, “I know. I tried, okay? Just help me get him back, Buck.”
Rumlow paid him no attention, not even when Steve managed to push a finger into Rumlow’s eye socket and pull it away bloody. “I’ll make him suffer the most. Maybe I’ll lock him in a cell with your dead body?” Rumlow mused, “How long do you think it will take for him to lose his mind?”
He took a left, seeing a figure out of the corner of his eye quickly duck into a shop doorway. He frowned but thought nothing of it, everyone was out this morning. Last minute Christmas shopping probably. Tony continued on his way, feeling cautious about the sound of soft treads in the snow behind him.
Rhodey sighed, “Tones…”
It was his name from Tony’s lips. His name like a prayer, like a swear word, like a lighthouse calling him home, “Add another finger.” Steve told him.
There were tons of websites trying to figure out which crime reports were The Captain’s victims and a few on Cap Watch that seemed to detail the changes Steve had made since taking over as head of The Avengers from someone called Phillips. There were also a few buzzfeed articles that scared Tony more than he thought to admit.
All eyes turned to Tony as he made his entrance, “Hi.” He said shyly, eyes only for Steve in that moment.
Steve hadn't stopped to think about it from that angle.
“I trust him.” Steve replied, looking at Fury with an easy smile, “He’s got a good face. Must be the eyepatch.”
Tony smile down at him, “Just be gentle with me,” He teased, “Go slow.”
“So, you and Bucky are together?” Tony asked, taking another sip of his coffee.
But being here with Tony, he could almost forget everyone else in this bar looked at him as a monster. The Captain. The person who stalked the streets at night and was the reason they locked their doors.
It had been days and Steve was only just being brought from his cell into an interview room. Ross’ doing no doubt, waiting Steve out. Proving who held the power now. As if Steve could forget after glancing down at the ugly orange ensemble they’d given him when they booked him in at the station and checked him for weapons. They’d taken fingerprints and swab samples of his DNA, told him to change and shoved him in a cell. Fury watched over the entire thing with a guarded expression. Steve tried to avoid his gaze.
Another dead body on top of hundreds.
He didn't even spare a glance behind him to see if Bucky and Natasha had followed his command. They would, he knew, they always did when it mattered. Steve was half crouched, half running towards the warehouse where the noise originated from. His eyes glancing down the barrel of his gun.
“I’m sorry.” Tony uttered.
"We're not leaving." Natasha responded, her eyebrow quirked. Steve could see her breath form in the cold air.
“Exactly. So, if I’m not a monster then there’s no way you can be one either.” Steve explained, “You’re a genius, do the math. Physically impossible, right?”
“Then don’t say it.” He warned.
Steve spun them, moving Tony back until his back hit the wood of his door and Steve had pinned him up against it and this was what Steve wanted. The lines of Tony’s body pressing against his own until he was heady with the feel of him under Steve’s hands.
Steve deserved that. A million words bubbling in his throat. He was sure he could use them all and still it wouldn’t be enough to tell Tony how sorry he was. Still, if Tony hated him now then he deserved that too and if this was the last conversation Tony allowed him to have then he would fill it with all the words burning inside of him.
Steve nodded, reaching over to pull out the draw and come back with a bottle of half used lube and a foil packet, “Are you sure?” Something about Tony made him want to take every care about this, he wanted to know that Tony wanted him. It was a type of need Steve wasn’t used to feeling, a kind of caring intimacy that scared him.
“And let me guess, you get me and they go free?” Steve said.
Over a dozen bombs.
Tony laughed and slapped his arm playfully, “Don’t play the innocent.”
Bucky still had his gun trained on Howard and Tony watched his father’s eyes flick over to him every few seconds. It was a rare thing to see Howard Stark show fear.
He knew if he told Bucky the truth then he’d want to come with Steve for back up and honestly Steve wasn’t even sure who he was meeting so he didn’t want to put Bucky in danger by bringing him along. It was stupid enough for him to go but Steve never did like to think a situation through until his back was up against the wire, it was how he did his best work.
Thor nodded, “It does make sense, Ross already has him. He won’t expect us to try and come for him. He already believes he’s won.”
Tony was breathing heavily and looking a little dazed and Steve couldn’t help but smirk at being the cause of that, “I’ll be right up!” Steve called towards the stairs.
Tony hummed, “Who knows. At least I won’t get beard burn anymore.”
Natasha nodded, “I’m not going anywhere.”
But after their activities in the garage, Steve had convinced Tony to take a shower before heading home because they were both a mess and he didn’t want Tony to leave like that thinking he was most sort of second rate hook up.
Natasha stood in the centre of the room, a place that Steve would have normally taken up if he was there. She looked unnatural in the position, her shoulders set and her jumper two sizes too big for her.
“I knew you’d come.” Rumlow replied, “he screamed, you know? When I hacked off his arm. That’s his blood over there.” He motioned to a spot in the corner next to another support beam. Steve had to swallow the bile in his throat at the sight of Bucky’s blood pooled around it, hacksaw slick with it and left abandoned in the mess.
Clint sighed down the phone, Steve could tell it was out of relief, “I didn’t mean to miss the meeting, Cap.”
He moved his hand until he was pressing his fingers against Tony’s hole, dipping a digit slicked with lube inside him.
“It’s all we can be.” Steve replied, “It’s the only way to protect you.”
Rhodey’s face softened, “Oh Tony.”
Tony took a small step back, “I need to…” He turned on his heel, more overwhelmed than anything. He needed space and air and he needed to not see Steve’s lost puppy face.
Natasha frowned, “You’re leaving?”
His guest was exactly where Natasha said he’d be, sitting against the wall with his hands tied and cuffed to the radiator over by the cars. He was bleeding from his head, clearly where Natasha had hit him with the butt of her gun, but he was awake and staring at Steve with wide eyes. Someone, probably Bucky, had tapped his mouth shut.
The Captain was gone.
“The Captain has been in the driving seat so long, Tony. I’m not sure who I am without him.”
Steve slammed his hips back in, letting go of Tony’s shoulder to rest his forehead against the bite, chasing his own release. Tony ground back against him, helping Steve as much as he could.
Steve looked at him then, really looked at him, “You would do that? Leave everything behind to run away with me?”
Steve nodded, “You built it up by yourself, right?”
Tony nodded, “Rumlow threatened them to motivate me. I just need to check they’re okay.”
“Rumlow’s coming for you, Captain. I’m just the one who’s pulling the trigger, he’s the bullet.” Pierce bit out.
Sam slid their drinks at them, eyes boring into Steve’s skull but Steve said nothing other than a quick thanks which prompted Sam to get back to his work, “I’m going to have to explain this one later.” He told Tony with a smile, “He’s like a bored housewife when it comes to gossip.”
“I need to fuck you, Tony.” Steve told him, “I need to make you cum.”
Natasha tilted her head at the question, “We aren’t together anymore. It doesn’t matter to me who he screws.”
Tony nodded, “But you always make sure I cum first.” He rolled his hips against Steve’s for emphasis, “You always take care of me first. I want to do that for you.”
Tony smiled, leaning down so his lips were inches away, “You’re not in charge, Captain. I am.” He placed his mouth against Steve’s, smiling into their kiss when Steve tried to give it everything he could to keep Tony there. The wet swipe of his tongue against Tony’s lips, the way he bit down on his bottom lip when Tony tried to pull back to keep him there a little longer.
“And you come back as a consultant for the company.”
“Fine, I’ll draw up an immunity deal for your team as an insurance if I don’t keep my end of the deal. You’ll need to fill out their actual names, I assume you know them. You do realise that immunity deals are normally offered as part of protective custody agreements. You might never see them again. They probably won’t even be able to stay together. It’s a mixed bag with these types of arrangements.” Fury stated.
Tony nodded against the pillow, “It’s going to be fine; you know. We got the death certificate and the mission report from Afghanistan. T’Challa thinks it will work. He said he’ll make whatever statement you need him to and back you up.”
Steve didn’t answer right away, staring into Bucky’s face as he wrestled with his own feelings on the matter. A flash of brown eyes and the sound of his name tumbling from Tony’s lips crossed his mind, “Would it be so bad if I did?” Steve asked quietly, knowing Bucky would hear him.
Fury was catching up with him now, “It places both our cops in Hydra’s base of operations when the mark was carved.”
“God, sweetheart, you’re so gorgeous like this.” Steve told him, leaning down to kiss along his spine.
Tony had the biggest bed Steve had ever since, all white sheets and mountains of pillows on a white canvas, separated from the rest of his flat by two large bookcases that acted as room partitions. Steve wanted to stop and analyse the space, Tony’s space, to see the little quirky items that sat on those bookshelves and see what that was that was stuck to the wall opposite his bed with tape but then Tony was back to tugging at his shirt and jacket and pushing them off his shoulders and Steve’s focus was back on Tony.
“T’Challa’s re-election campaign. I’m just there to scare some votes for him but it would be a lot less dreadful with you.” Steve replied.
“He might like that.”
And Clint still wasn’t here.
Tony leant down to kiss his hairline, “What about Ross?”
Tony was silent for a long time and Steve hated it, he could almost imagine him turning the statement over in his mind, “What?” He said bluntly and his voice sounded odd after the silence before it.
“We’ll make sure it’s not for nothing.” Tony told him, “You just have to fight. That’s all, Steve. You’ve been doing it for so long, just a little more, okay?”
“Okay, two minutes tops. You don’t get too close to him, alright? I need to bring him up to the interview room to get him to sign his paperwork anyway. He’s refusing to get a lawyer even though one’s been calling for him.” Rhodey sighed, rubbing his brow, “You can go in first but then you leave, and you stay out of this until this investigation is over, okay? He’ll be rotting behind bars before you know it.”
“I don’t know. No body was found.” Fury replied.
Steve almost couldn’t believe it.
Clint leaned back, “Killing cops isn’t our style.”
“Fuck, harder.” Tony demanded, fingers white against the desk as he ground back against Steve.
Sam smiled kindly and Steve found himself continuing, “As of yesterday evening we’re at war with Hydra. It’s going to be bloody; it’s going to be brutal. Rumlow isn’t going to stop.” He paused, eyes locking with Bucky, “And neither are we. Rumlow wants to bring bombs into our city. He wants to kill us and insight the kind of fear that will shape a generation. Not whilst I’m alive.”
Steve knew what Tony was doing. He was giving him permission. Showing he really did except every dark part of Steve’s soul that he wasn’t even sure he excepted himself. Tony was giving him everything, acceptance, a future, an order. Whatever Steve needed it to be, Tony was giving that to him. And wasn’t that the kicker, Tony Stark making room for Steve’s issues in his heart when Steve couldn’t accept them himself.
“I see you got my little gift.” Rumlow greeted as Steve walked into the room, gun held aloft and trained on his forehead, “Seemed only fitting I return him to you. Your family does have a habit of poking their fingers into my business.”
Steve sighed; he couldn’t explain to them that wasn’t why he was worried. He was worried because they needed to lay low. Fury and the police were looking at them for being suspects in the police killings so beating up gang members on the street in broad daylight was the kind of sloppy they couldn’t afford right now. It was playing into Hydra’s hands.
“I didn’t.” Steve whispered softly, “I didn’t kill him. He was dying anyway. Cancer. He knew it was a matter of time. He told me on the way to a meeting with Hydra’s leader. A guy called Schmidt. I think he was trying to prepare me for what was about to happen.”
Ross barked out a laugh, “You want to bargain for your freedom?”
“You seem awfully sure.”
"Whatever you're going to do, do it fast." He told Steve with a grim face, "Something is happening down there."
Steve could feel tears burning behind his eyes and he took a small step closer to Tony. Tony took one back. Steve froze in his tracks, “I’m not sure I believe in God, my mom did. God, sins, penance. The whole deal. But if I’m ever stood in front of him, a list of my sins before me, this is the one I’ll seek forgiveness for. Not the people I’ve killed or the things I’ve done. This one, right here. You. Hurting you, that’s the sin I’d want to do penance for. For ever making you feel like you were anything less than what you are.”
Steve was helpless, something he hadn’t felt since his time in the war. He took a few steps towards Bucky, hoping that by physically closing the distance, he might also manage to close the rift between them.
“They call me the King of Brooklyn because they say I don’t bow to anyone.” Steve told him, “But I bow to you. I kneel to you. I’ll get on my knees and I’ll stay there if you want me to because I don’t want it without you. My titles, the gang, my freedom. Tony, I just want you. You’re the only thing that can bring me to my knees and I don’t care about anything else but you.”
“No.” She said firmly, “I need to see him dead with my own eyes for this.”
“Except me.”
Steve tried, managing to hold eye contact for a few seconds before he dropped his gaze. Tony shouldn’t have to see him like this, riding the high of what he was about to do. The downfall he’d have to work through after.
He pushed the door open wider, stepping into the apartment.
Natasha looked at him for a moment, a wave of fear flashed over her green eyes before she waved the remote towards the television screen in the corner of the living, “This.” She replied, turning on the sound as everyone else turned their attention to the new report that was playing.
Steve leaned down to kiss him, slotting himself between his bent knees with his fingers still buried inside of him. This position was more intimate as he swallowed Tony’s moan, fingers moving inside of him as the heel of his hand pressed against his own cock through his jeans. Steve went slow and shallow, lighting the fire without letting it roar. Tony was devouring kiss after kiss from his lips as his hips bucked up and Steve couldn’t resist adding a third finger.
“Now, we clean up a body.” Steve sighed, “Rhodey, can you find Tony some clothes? Also head to the morgue and grab a body bag. Don’t let anyone see you, avoid the cameras if possible.”
Steve picked up his pace, feeling the relief in his gut as the sparks inside him grew. Tony moaned happily, rocking his hips in time with Steve’s thrust until Steve could feel the sweat dripping down his own back as he thrust back into Tony’s body again.
Ross was beside him suddenly, a cold presence and a whispered phrase, “Hail Hydra.”
But Tony was beautiful like this, all strung out and panting with Steve’s fingers inside him.
Steve held firm, Ross was trying to get to him, and Steve couldn’t afford to rise to it, “Your right eye twitches when you’re intimated, has anyone ever told you that?”
“I watched Bucky and Nat make so many mistakes, I watched them get weighed down in the hate and anger and fear.” Steve said softly, “they were barely speaking to each other. They wasted so much time and now, we barely have any left.”
“I’m ready if you are.” Steve promised.
Tony felt the awkwardness rolling off him in waves, “You trust me, right? We’ve been friends for so long now, you have my back?”
Steve was hauled to his feet, eyes on Natasha and Thor as they were led towards different cars, ones with steel bars and armoured escorts.
“You’re under my protection which means your family is as well.” Steve replied, “That’s how I run my business.”
He helped guide Tony’s body, slipping out of him to the tip before thrusting back in again. Tony gasped, hips stuttering as Steve’s cock found his prostate and Steve could feel him shuddering in anticipation of the pleasure.
Ross was still smiling, “You’re not a survivor, Mr Stark. You don’t have what it takes.”
Tony ran a hand through his hair, “Uh, you too… Cap.”
Steve kicked him in the stomach to stop himself from shouting in frustration. He should have seen it coming. Ross, Rumlow, it was all connected. Steve had been treating them as two separate problems, but they were the same one. Rumlow had played this the same way Steve had and Steve had fallen for it.
Steve knew that tone well, “It’s not a big deal.”
His heart sped up at the name on the screen, eyes blinking to make sure he wasn’t seeing things. Tony’s name was there, along with the notification that he’d gotten a new message to open. He’d completely forgot about waiting for Tony’s reply whilst he was dealing with the Rumlow situation and now Steve found himself eager to open it.
It definitely couldn’t be love.
Tony laughed. He couldn’t help it, that was a new one, “Whatever it is, I’m not interested.”
“I’ll do this one by myself.” Steve told them, “Both of you go take a walk, have a conversation. I don’t know what’s going on between you and it’s none of my business. You don’t bring it into our job though. You know that.”
Thor nodded, “Of course, Captain.”
Tony frowned, “You kill people, what’s the difference?”
Peter beamed at him, “You’re the best, Tony!”
What made him pause was the whimpering body of Howard Stark at Rumlow’s feet. He was bleeding from his temple, expensive suit all dirty and crumpled as he lay on the ground like a lapdog. A sniffling mass in an Armani suit. Steve didn’t pity him, not after everything he’d done to his son but he knew Rumlow had brought him here to play that card.
Steve expected him to walk away so he was mildly surprised when Tony took a step closer to him. These next words were for Steve and Steve only as Tony’s heart broke and he shoved it into Steve’s hand like a metaphorical fuck you, “if this isn’t part of some plan, give me a sign that you’re actually the want who wants this.” Tony said low and deadly. It was an ultimatum, but Steve couldn’t take it.
Steve should walk away. He shouldn’t hear this. They didn’t want him to hear this.
Tony and Natasha froze as they heard the gunshot echo through the half-finished walls and airy corridors. Tony could feel his heart thundering in his chest as he gave Natasha a wide-eyed glance.
Steve sighed, sliding back into his chair as Fury set up collecting up Ross’ papers. “That was stupid.” Fury muttered so Steve could barely pick it up, “And brilliant.”
“You killed Rumlow, it’s done now.” Tony replied softly as Steve cupped his cheek, “Are you okay?”
Howard’s eyes popped, “Finally taking my offer of coming back to the company?”
More. More. More.
Steve hummed again when he felt Tony’s heel digging into him, urging him on and felt his cock jerk in his mouth. He pulled back up before sinking back down on the length again, watching with glee as Tony’s breath stuttered in his throat. His hands were knuckle white against the sheets as Steve swallowed down around him.
2 messages mocked him from the home screen. The first was from Sam:
“Most cops are.” Fury replied, tucking the papers under his arm, “You really going to give him your confession?”
“Fucking knock him out.” Tony heard as one of the guys spat blood.
“Because you don’t see anyone, Steve.” Bucky replied, “You have one-night stands. You get it out of your system and then you come home. What is it about this one that you can’t let go of? Is he that much of a good fuck? His father is Hydra for fuck sake. He’s probably working for them too.”
“That’s because he’s got a head built for the fight.” Sam commented, “In the army Bucky was the top of the top.”
Tony followed him as he headed towards the back of the house, “Are you a gang member too?”
T’challa huffed and Steve could imagine him scrubbing a hand over his face, “You’re not calling me to speak to an old friend, Captain.”
The line went dead and Steve was almost thankful Bucky had let the subject drop. Steve wasn’t sure he could deal with the breadth of his feelings for Tony in his own mind, let alone telling Bucky about them. Steve worked best when he was able to push those thoughts aside and get on with the task at hand.
“I can’t… I don’t… fuck.” Tony babbled, unable to catch his breath.
Tony tried not to let the worry show on his face. How much did this guy know? If he knew who Tony was then did he also know about his connection to Steve? The guy was obviously Hydra, the gang patch on his jacket gave that much away. Had they been following Steve? Maybe they saw Tony leave his place earlier, had seen the kiss Steve had given him before he got into his car.
“You might want to vet your staff more thoroughly next time.” Steve winked, “People will do a lot for money.”
“It has to be me.” Tony replied, “I’m the only one who isn’t related to The Avengers. The only one Rhodey might let through the door to see him.”
“Needed to clear my head.” It wasn’t a lie, at least.
“Things have been a little tense between you two lately.”
Not for good though, because Tony had told him he wanted this. He wanted Steve. Enough to want to continue sleeping with him anyway and for now Steve would take it.
Natasha was the first to speak, her voice carefully constructed and void of the emotion the sparkled in her eyes, "You want us to go for immunity?"
Steve could feel his attempt at humour as he rounded the corner, but he couldn’t find it in him to smile. His side was getting worse and he was pretty sure the adrenaline was wearing off, “It’s because you’re… you.”
The body fell limp, blood pooling to the floor. Steve barely looked at it as he rounded the corner, he had to be close.
“You’re still here, aren’t you?” Steve smirked cockily and was rewarded with a playful twinkle in Tony’s chocolate eyes.
Bucky nodded once, sharp and short before walking away, heading out to the kitchen to presumably find Clint some alcohol. Natasha was still at his side and she gave his arm a reassuring squeeze, “He likes you; you know?”
“I’ll get him.” Fury promised, “I don’t want civilians caught in the crossfire so I’m not even going to ask why he got caught up in this. Stay clean. Stay low. I’ll process the paperwork.”
Tony laughed, it was soft and delicate, like he didn’t do it often, “My apprentice showed up with a cat. My best friend is a workaholic who doesn’t know when to quit and I’m pretty much going to be doing double shifts from now til Christmas to keep my customers happy.” He shrugged, “Another day at the office.”
Hammer blanched comically, eyes darting from Steve to Tony and back again, “Your date?”
. Natasha. I’ve never heard her giggling before.”
“You’re living in a fantasy.” Natasha’s venom was back in her voice, “We would be bored in months. We choose this life, Bucky. Both of us. This family. I should have told you, but I wanted to avoid this. I wanted to protect you from going through the same thing I had to go through when I made the decision.”
Natasha raised an eyebrow, closing Tony’s fingers firmly around the knife in his hand, “You find a soft spot and push.”
“Whatever you need, Punk.”
Tony slipped the umbrella out of the stand, feeling the weight in his hand and being mildly comforted by the fact he now had a weapon of sorts. He flicked on the light switch that was just inside the door, flooding his apartment in light.
“It’s fine, I’ll see how long he’s going to be. As long as he’s out of here before Thor gets back. I don’t like ears I don’t know.” Steve replied, heading out the back of the house towards the steps that led to the garage.
About how to survive. How to get out because he was right on two fronts. He wouldn’t be building Hydra so much as a toy rocket and Steve definitely wouldn’t be coming to rescue him.
Steve ran his hands up and down the dip of Tony’s back, “You’re fine.”
“I’m going to need one of your knives.” He told Natasha, “And as much time as you can give me.”
“I liked his work.” Steve insisted hoping he wasn’t blushing, “Bike’s never looked better.”
Tony wasn’t sure how long Steve had been sitting out there, in the cold night air with blood covering every inch of him that Tony could see. Him and Natasha walked out, spotting him instantly, alone and guarded and almost other-worldly.
Tony moved ahead of Natasha, dropping to his knees in the snow in front of Steve with a soft expression, “Hey, you’re okay. I’m here. We’re safe. You’re okay.” He rambled, watching as Steve broke through the mask of indifference he wore.
“How did you get out?” Tony asked breathlessly, hand moving to tug the knot on the other tie to free Steve’s other hand.
“We aren’t living in fear of him, Nat. We aren’t cowering in the shadows and waiting for an attack. I didn’t know he’d recognise my voice after all these years. I wasn’t expecting him to leak my name to the press but it’s smart. It puts the heat on me, he needs that. He’s playing us at our own game.” Steve said, crossing his arms in front of his chest.
“I said…”
Tony blanched at the thought, “Why are you here? Are you following me?”
“Is this your way of saying you sorta like having me around?” Tony asked gently, a smile curving into his lips.
Steve gave him a small smile, tearing his eyes away from the window to meet Tony’s gaze. Those steel blue eyes were so soft and yielding, Tony could almost imagine waking up to them every morning.
He rounded the last corner and stopped dead in his tracks. The exit was in sight, but Fury stood in front of it, hands crossed over his chest and a scowl on his face.
Steve thrust them back into Tony’s warmth, curling them deliciously to press against his prostate. Tony almost whined, cock dripping with precome.
Steve kept his pace, running a hand through his hair. Were they trying to force Steve’s hand? Did they want him to charge in so they could say he started the turf war first and they were just reacting? Maybe Tony wasn’t even there… Maybe he was…
“Because I can’t give you anything,” Steve said, “I’m dangerous, I’m a target. I can’t give you a nice life with dates and a 9 to 5 job.”
“You won’t get the chance again.” Steve promised, releasing Rumlow’s jacket to pummel at his face. Steve hit him furiously, left fist then right fist then left again. Over and over again. He watched as Rumlow’s head snapped left and right, felt a crunch of jawbone under his hand and the slick slide of blood decorating his knuckles and Rumlow’s face.
“See if we can get anything about a leader?”
He could hear shouting in the distance, harsh voices and biting orders from the tone. He took another few steps, clearing the remains of his cell door and scanned the corridor.
Tony stood at his side as they watched the flames grow higher, taking hold of the shipment yard until smoke plumed through the sky and flames licked through the structure. The snow was still falling around them as they watched it burn.
“By looking into the investigation and finding something that points to Hydra.” Steve replied with a smile.
“Let me take care of you now,” Tony insists, pulling back from Steve’s hold to try and get Steve’s jeans and boxers out of the way.
“Do you want me to go?” Tony asked softly when Steve hadn’t moved or spoken.
Rhodey looked at him like he’d just thrown up on his shirt, “I’m sorry, what?”
Tony sunk to the floor on his ass when his legs gave out, not caring that the pool of Ross’ blood was creeping closer to him. He pulled his knees up to his chest, hand pressed against his mouth as the sobs came.
Steve could hear the emotion creeping back into Tony’s voice, felt the way his fingers tightened a little too tight on his sides. Damn Ross. Steve wished he was still alive just so he could kill him again. Damn Ross. Tony didn’t deserve any of this and Ross knew what to say to get to him. He knew what he was doing by riling Tony up, although Steve doubted he knew just how effective that little speech was going to be. He had tried to back Tony into a corner and Tony had fought back. And now it had cost him.
Nat smiled back, “I know. Who else is going to keep you from going crazy and deal with the boring stuff like hiring mechanics and reminding you to eat?”
“I don’t know.”
Tony was a fighter. That was good.
He definitely shouldn’t be doing this.
“I want you to build me a Jericho,” Rumlow replied and Tony could feel the dread pooling in his gut, “I asked your father first, but he insisted he couldn’t make it work. I planned to kill him, but you can imagine my surprise when he told me you had figured out a way to create a fully functional missile.”
He shot once. Twice. Taking out two men from the doorway and effectively clearing his entry point. Steve slipped inside easily, body coiled like a spring ready to fight and a flutter of snow starting to fall from the sky.
He shrugged off his leather jacket and dumped it on the nearest chair, “Fine. I gave him a few days off, told him to lay low.”
Howard blanched at the intrusion, sitting behind his desk with a bottle of whisky open and papers in front of him. Tony glared as Bucky shut the door behind them. Howard was practically beaming.
“I’ll think of one.” Steve replied, gasping as Tony rolled his hips again, “I need to get Rumlow first, get him to the cops for the killings and then work out a deal.”
“You pick a direction and you start driving, don’t think too much about it.” Steve told them, “Don’t tell anyone where you’re going until you get there. Communicate by postcards in coded messages. No phones, no emails. Nothing Ross can track. We can’t afford slip ups on this.”
“You know?” Fury questioned, keeping his voice level and playing dumb.
"But we won't stay together." Bucky cut in.
The Captain had fallen.
Thor broke through his thoughts, “Shall we take them down?”
“And it is now?” Tony asked, the words harsher than he intended.
“You want to cum?” Steve asked hotly into his ear.
“You shouldn’t have had too.” Steve sighed, “Tony, if he touched you I’ll kill him…”
He had never been good with words. He was good with actions. But right now, Bucky needed words.
“Tony, it’s Steve.” Steve tried again, taking small steps towards him so not to startle him as he avoided the blood soaking into the floor.
Fury exhaled sharply, “Jesus. I knew he was obsessed with bringing you in, but I thought that was job dedication. I didn’t think he’d ever be one to double dip his hat. Ross always seemed straight as an arrow.”
Bucky had been pulled off Sitwell by another goon and they were currently going fist to fist. Bucky was brutal. Steve had sparred with him enough to know. Bucky lodged a right hook into his opponent’s jaw with such a force that it sent him back a few steps, spitting blood before he charged at Bucky again.
Tony scoffed, “Less dreadful. Nice. Is this how you ask all of your dates out? It’s probably why you don’t get a second.”
She studied him for a moment, one eyebrow raised in a way that made Steve feel like he’d been caught with his hand in the cookie jar, “Oh, you liked him huh?” She teased softly.
The man in question was still asleep, curled up to Steve’s side with his head resting on Steve’s chest and a leg thrown carelessly between Steve’s under the sheets. They were a tangle of limbs in a room that smelt purely of sex.
Tony flashed him a dirty smile that went straight to Steve’s dick, “Well, I’ll be happy to take you up on that offer as soon as I’m done here.”
He opened the last button, pushing the shirt open as much as he could to reveal Steve’s chest to him, he couldn’t take it off properly while Steve was tied to the bed but for now this would do. Steve was a masterpiece, sculpted by gods and to be marvelled at by men. Tony couldn’t help the way his hands spanned over his skin, fingers mapping out the lines of his chest and circling over the scars the made him who he was. The graze by his ribs from the bullet on his left side that left a ragged line on his side that Tony simple had to taste with his tongue.
Clint grunted, “Bring alcohol!” He shouted out to Thor as he slumped his head back against the cushions.
They held a funeral for Howard three weeks later. Or, Tony held one for him. Steve knew he was doing it out of duty more than anything that even remotely resembled love. He did it because it was the right thing to do, because it was what the press and everyone at Stark Industries was expecting from him.
“You can still get immunity without me. All of you. Fury will process the paperwork and you stay out of whatever happens next. You’ll be together, Nat.” Steve said.
He smiled as Tony blanched at him, taking in his new appearance with eager eyes and a coy smile. Steve was clean shaven, his sharp jawline visible and his lips looking fuller than before. He had also got Natasha to cut his hair back to the way he used to wear it in the army, shorter and stylish. In the summer, the sun would warm the ends and it would look blonder too. Tony was still staring at him.
Steve, Rhodey and Fury had managed to cover up Ross’ murder perfectly. Two cops and a mob boss had the shared knowledge to make sure no one suspected a thing they didn’t want them to. Ross’ body was found two days after he was killed, down by the docks in what looked like a shoot-out gone wrong. Steve had even gone down there to fire off a couple of shots into the shipment containers from Ross’ own gun so it looked like he tried to fight back. The official story was he was a corrupt cop, working for Hydra to cover up their operation. There were bombs found at the shipment yard that supported that theory and Ross’ own phone found with his body held all the evidence needed to prove he was Hydra. He’d gone down to the docks after The Captain was in custody to assert his authority over Hydra now Rumlow was dead. Hydra hadn’t liked that and fought back. There had been a gun fight and during the struggle someone had charged at him, managing to get the upper hand and stab him in the throat, leaving him to bleed out. Fury had been assigned the case as a stroke of good luck and really everything fell neatly into place after that.
So, that was it. Rumlow was cocky and already assumed Tony would be helping him.
Fury wasn’t with them. What had Rumlow done to him? Rhodey wasn’t there either. Steve saw them swarm their little group, tackling the hammer out of Thor’s hand and herding Natasha to the ground. Steve felt himself be ripped away from Tony’s fingers, hands being shoved behind his back to be cuffed.
“Exactly, Bucky will warm up to you when he realises you’re here for Steve just like the rest of us.”
“If anyone can get him to see reason it’s you, Tony. I truly believe that.” Thor told him, once again his hand returned to the name etched into his hammer.
“My tuna sandwich?”
“But not you.” Fury mused, “Something else is driving you.”
Except maybe Tony Stark.
“If you attack Hydra then you forfeit immunity.” Fury replied, “I think I have a way to secure it for you as well as the rest of the team.”
“Good, I’ll pick you up at 6?”
He shuffled above Steve, knees wedged against the back of the seat in order to line Steve’s cock up with his entrance, holding himself so the tip grazed over his already slicked up hole.
Sitwell stopped just a few yards from Steve, “Nice night.” He responded, eyes looking at the sky.
“Steve…” That time it was more like a plea.
Tony nodded, “Yeah.” He breathed, all but collapsing into Steve’s side. The move threw Steve for a second and he stumbled to support Tony against him as he wrapped an arm around his shoulders, the other hand still in Tony’s grip.
The next floor was for Clint, Natasha and Bucky and they had their own bathroom as well. Clint had a box room at the end of the hall which he said he wanted because the window looked out over downtown Brooklyn and he always liked a good vantage point. Natasha’s was the biggest, it seemed like a no brainer to everyone involved that she would need it and so no one battered an eyelid when she had moved all her stuff in. Bucky’s was on the other side of her, a messy tornado of dirty clothes and empty plates that never seemed to find their way down to the kitchen. Steve always shook his head at that, some things never changed.
Tony wasn’t looking at him and Steve knew he needed to get him to look away from the body, he didn’t want it to be the only think Tony saw when he closed his eyes. He got closer, if he stretched out his arm, he’d be able to brush Tony’s knee but he didn’t try it. Tony was holding himself together in a state of shock right now and Steve knew any sudden contact or movements would shatter it. He saw this a lot in the war, young soldiers who suddenly learned what they had signed up for in a violent outcry of blood and bullets. He’d heard them cry at night for their mothers and pray to their Gods. He watched them strip away every ounce of their humanity in order to survive the job.
“People call it criminal.” Steve nodded, “Sometimes I feel like it’s the rest of the world and their conventions that are the real problem.”
What caught Tony’s caught was the scar that run from the edge of the man’s eyebrow down towards the bottom of his cheek, a red puckered angry line that didn’t look like he healed quite right. He might have been handsome once, with his dark hair and broad frame but that scar marring his face drew all attention to it. Tony wondered if he preferred it that way.
Steve frowned, “I’m already in chains. What else can I give you?”
Tony pushed, the metal digging further into Ross’ skin. He didn’t look away from the panic in Ross’ eyes as the warmth of his blood trailed down the metal and onto Tony’s fingers. Ross shook but Tony gripped his arm tight and pushed even harder, watching as the metal slipped in further. He was panting with the effort, there was so much blood. Ross was gurgling, hands reaching out uselessly for grip on something.
“I can try and steer him that way, but he isn’t just going to forget about you.” Fury told him.
Fury sighed, hands in his pockets to protect him from the chill. Steve was running on pure adrenaline and fear and couldn’t feel it anymore, “I might be able to convince Ross to spare your team, Cap, but he won’t agree to sparing you. You’re the Captain, a mob boss, a killer. You created one of the biggest gangs in the city. Ross isn’t going to let an immunity deal stop him from making an example of you.”
Steve laughed, pulling out of Tony gently as he moved to take the condom off and throw it in the trash can near the bed. Tony hadn’t moved and Steve cuddled up to him again, arms wrapping around him as they relaxed into a sweaty heap.
Bucky grimaced, “Charming.”
“Yeah, yeah. Just trying to break the cycle of shame I guess.” Tony replied, “Go put your cat somewhere he isn’t going to get run over. We have Mrs Henderson dropping off her car in 20 minutes.”
“Okay, you’re handcuffed so I’m calling the shots right now.” Tony told him, stepping closer again, “We have a plan. You’re going to break yourself out, then you’re going to get clear and meet the team outside in the alley. They will have a car waiting.”
Steve pressed the phone tighter to his ear, “Don’t get too used to running things around here. It won’t last long.”
Clint was fine. He would be fine. That’s what Bruce had said, hands covered in blood and a small lump of metal between his fingers. Tony had wanted to throw up then too but held back, Clint would be fine. They all would. As soon as they got Steve out of there.
Tony squinted, “What?”
Tony’s hands moved into his hair, gripping tightly as Steve repeated the move. He could feel Tony’s hips rocking upwards, trying to get some friction for the heat pooling into his gut. Steve could already see precome beading at the head of Tony’s cock. God, how he wanted to taste him.
Tony was brought out of his thoughts by the sound of his captor rising to his feet, heavy boots thudding on the concrete as he made his way over to Tony, “We seem to be having some miscommunication here, Tony. My name’s Rumlow, this here is my little empire.”
Rhodey was there, to his right with worried eyes. He was scared but Tony was numb. Ross was watching him.
“Not the whole time.” Tony whispered gently.
“Early run this morning?” Tony asked, hooking a leg over Steve’s hip like he needed to be as wrapped up in him as possible.
Tony dropped his arms to his sides with a sigh, “You hurt me. You made me feel like shit, Steve. I thought it meant nothing to you. That I meant nothing to you.”
He sunk his mouth down on Steve’s cock, taking him as far as he could. He enclosed Steve’s thick length in his mouth, making an ‘O’ shape with his lips and hollowing out his cheeks before moving his mouth up again.
He killed a man.
“Fuck, Steve!” Tony called out, “I’m going to come.”
Steve sees stars when Tony actually moans around his thumb, pulling the digit free of his mouth with a grin. He’s fighting dirty and Steve loves it.
He made it to his floor after his gruelling trudge up the stairs, hands digging into his pockets for his keys when he stopped short. His front door was open, just a few inches.
Tony set off running.
Steve nodded, “Which brings me to the reason for this meeting. I’m calling a vote to bring Tony into our team. You know how this works; you all get a say. I just want to make it clear that I don’t need your approval on my relationship with him outside of our family. That’s not up for discussion, this is about Rumlow, Tony’s safety and ours. If Rumlow wants him to create weapons, then I want him as far away from that as possible.”
Steve glanced down at his side then back at Tony, “I’m not sure…”
Oh, how right Rhodey was.
“Isn’t it?” Fury replied, “Stay here. I’ll be back with Rogers. I’ll explain then. Keep your distance or you’ll spook him and then we’ll have a whole new problem on our hands.” Fury ordered, glancing down at Ross’ dead body once more, “Shit.” He sighed before slipping out the door again.
“Show me.”
Tony stared at him for the longest time, brown eyes shining, “Please stand up, I need to see you.”
Tony sighed, “Jesus, Steve.”
Steve was starting to dread it every time an envelope was delivered to his doorstep. The note from Fury had brought him nothing but trouble, even the immunity deals with their plain brown envelope were a waste of his time and effort. So now, as Steve stood in the hallway with a white envelope resting in his hand, he couldn’t help but wonder what fresh hell it would bring him. ‘The Captain’ was written across the front in calligraphy and it was jarring to see such a name written so beautifully.
Bucky sighed, “I’m still not voting for him.”
Rumlow knew he wasn’t bluffing, and he also knew if it came to a shoot-out Steve was faster, so he charged. All tightly coiled bulk, compact and charging at Steve in a second. Rumlow kept low to throw Steve’s centre of gravity off and then he was barrelling into him, shoulder to chest and it sent them both to the ground.
Tony shifted his feet, “You crossed a line with Bucky?”
It had snowed overnight, as Brooklyn often did for this time of year. Everything was coated in a brilliant white that hurt Tony’s eyes and had him wishing he picked a warmer jacket for the weather, but he continued on regardless. He walked to work most days, preferring that short walk to trying to keep his cool in the city morning traffic.
“Think of it as a job application?”
“And I’m doing this for you to protect you!” Tony shouted in an explosion of emotion that seemed to come from nowhere, “Because I love you!”
Bucky stood up, grabbing the papers from Clint's hands and screwing one up into a ball before throwing it over his shoulder, "I'm with you ‘til the end of the line. If it's jail, then we're making sure we take Hydra with us."
Tony squinted, “I told you, I’m not building you anything.”
“You know there’s a perfectly good dance floor in the other room.” Tony replied as they turned gently.
Steve started pumping him in time with his thrusts, his own vision blacking out around the edges with his pleasure. He gritted his teeth, doubling his efforts to make Tony come one more time before he did.
He nodded eagerly, “I really do.”
“You’ll get mad.” Tony muttered, not looking at Rhodey because he didn’t want to start crying again. God, since when was he this emotional? Damn Steve Rogers straight to hell.
“How’d you get this?” He asked gently.
“A meeting with who?” She frowned because Steve never had secret meetings but he couldn’t tell her it was with Fury because that wouldn’t go down well and Steve still wasn’t sure he could trust him. He wouldn’t bring the team in unless he was sure.
Steve nodded, “We’ll live. You?”
“Rumlow’s gone too.” Steve replied, “I… he killed your father. I’m so sorry.”
Steve pressed his thighs against Tony’s legs, “How was your day?”
He was moving as well, heading after his best friend and right-hand man. He squeezed Tony’s shoulder on the way past, “I’m sorry.” He muttered to the mechanic as he left the room, following Bucky up the stairs.
Steve moved to unlock the cuffs from the radiator, allowing the man’s arm to slump down in his lap. His fingers twitched as he tried to regain feeling into them. Steve didn’t do it to be kind, he grabbed onto the guy’s good arm and dragged him away from the wall, all but throwing him into the direction of the cars that the garage housed.
“This family built him from the ground up as well.” Natasha replied, “He was so lost after Afghanistan, Bucky said it got pretty bad before they got into the gang stuff. He likes the reminders of good things, like he’s trying to hold onto the moments in his life where he feels like he deserves them.”
“Did Phillips know who you were?” Tony asked gently.
Tony kissed him soundly, “Bath sounds good.” He agreed.
There was an umbrella abandoned near the kitchen island, Tony must have grabbed it. Hydra wouldn’t have needed it. Steve wondered whether Tony was brave or stupid for thinking an umbrella would hold up against guys with guns. The struggle had moved towards the kitchen, the broken china and scattered letters told Steve that Tony had been cornered there and he had fought. It was probably the reason for the blood.
Tony seemed to just stare at him for a moment and shook his head with a smile, “Let’s find out. Of course you have a knife in your boot. Is there a gun in your pants as well?”
Steve made it into the inner chamber, a large open room that formed the central base of the shipment yard. It had probably once been used as the loading bay, Steve could smell the salty air from the docks behind them and feel the harsh wind rolling in from the coast. Rumlow was waiting. He sat on a bunch of wooden crates, slightly rotting on one side. He had a gun in one hand, he loosened his grip as he inspected his fingernails on the other. Steve almost wanted to laugh, Rumlow had built himself a makeshift throne from wood and rot and was sitting on it like a king in his own right.
Tony sighed and stood up, fishing a rag out of his back pocket to wipe his hands, “One and the same. Before you think about kidnapping me or whatever, don’t bother. I don’t deal with my dad or the business anymore. I haven’t spoken to him in years and I prefer it that way. I’m just a mechanic.”
Tony’s eyes were closed in bliss, hands fisted into the bedsheets as Steve withdrew his finger to the tip and pushed back in again. He did it a few more times, feeling the pull and stretch from Tony until he was happy that he could add another finger. Tony gasped and bucked his hips against Steve’s hand at the addition of a second digit. His hands gripping the sheets as Steve worked him open, scissoring his fingers to help stretch Tony further. He curled them inside of Tony’s heat when they were buried inside of him, searching for that spot that would make Tony see stars.
Tony.
He was expecting more resistance, more men. Perhaps Rumlow wasn’t quite so popular by Hydra standards either. Having Tony’s hand in his was a solid weight, a reminder of what he had saved tonight in exchange for his potential freedom and possibly his death. Steve squeezed it tighter as he turned around the corner.
He reached for it blindly, watching Rumlow’s eyes grow wider at the realisation of what Steve was doing.
“Did he….”
Bucky tried to give her a smile, “What about your stubborn steak?”
Tony nodded, “Looks to me like we have more in common than I thought.” He replied, hand gripping the door, “Goodbye, Howard.”
He hated the fact that he was drawn to Steve when he knew he shouldn’t be, and Tony hated the fact he wasn’t sorry for that even more. Rhodey would be so disappointed in him. But Tony knew he wanted it to happen again, he wanted to see Steve again.
The best and worst thing about Rhodey was how much he cared. He wasn’t about to let Tony wallow over some guy and he definitely wasn’t going to let Tony shove the covers over his head and waste his days away in bed trying not to think about how his sheets smelt faintly of Steve or that he could see one of his shirts poking out of the corner of his washing pile.
Steve narrowed his eyes, “He isn’t. I trust him, okay? And all I’m asking in return is that you trust me.”
He needed a weapon of sorts, two guards outside the door and Tony wasn’t so sure he’d be able to take them on with his bare hands.
They had done a good thing tonight. They had got the bombs off the streets and stopped Rumlow’s reign of terror in its tracks. Didn’t that count for something? Steve might have killed him, but he was a bad guy, surely that was a point in his favour. Rumlow was a cop killer and a tyrant. He’d killed Tony’s father.
Steve was sliding his phone out of his pocket before he knew he was doing it, dialling Bucky’s number and holding the phone to his ear. He stood as it rang, wiping Tony’s blood onto the side of his jeans.
Tony’s forehead was still pressed against his, “I’ve never come like that before,” He whispers between them, still out of breath, “Without someone jerking me off.”
The room fell silent, the awkwardness in the air settling like a thick layer of snow around them. Steve couldn’t tear his eyes away from Bucky, trying to understand, trying to communicate something to him. Anything. When had this rift between them opened up?
“Did Steve leave already?” The voice startled him and Tony turned round to find Thor standing in the doorway with his hammer in his hands.
He peered up at Steve through his eyelashes, the prickling pleasure pooling in his gut. Steve was watching him, dark lust filled eyes and a heaving torso.
Sam got to work as Bruce surveyed the wound, “We need to sterilize the wound and seal it but without a hospital…”
He had already spun on his heel and that left Steve with no choice but to follow him. Steve caught up with Fury easily, grabbing him by the arm and halting him in his tracks. He couldn’t shake the feeling of dread in his stomach, Fury was too cold and aloof. Had he changed his mind about his offer? Had Ross gotten to him?
Tony cut him off, “No, we’re not doing this here. I’m still mad at you. I don’t want to hear it. We have to move.”
“He wants us running scared. He wants the police on our ass so we can’t make a move and then I suspect the endgame will be to start picking us off one at a time.” Steve growled bitterly. Hydra had always been a pain in his ass, ever seen Phillips’ time in charge. Back then it had been a man called Schmidt in charge and killing him had put Steve in the position of right-hand man to the leader of The Avengers. When Phillips died, he had naturally assumed the role and set about recruiting his own people to get revenge.
Maybe he’d gotten it out of his system now. Last night had been intense and fun and Steve would happily do it again if Tony wanted that but maybe he could walk away now. They both had lives to lead and fortunately for Tony, those lives didn’t cross over.
Rumlow punched him in the chest, a knee over Steve’s stomach to keep him there.
“You have a nice night, Mr Pierce.” Steve smirked before turning on his heel and heading back inside to find Tony.
“What’s going on?” Rhodey asked, giving Tony his undivided attention.
“I’ll make a few calls.” T’challa agreed, “I’ll get him released within the hour. I’ll tell them it’s for the good of the people, no one wants to see what The Captain looks like when the police start targeting his own men. If they don’t have any proof to place Clint at the murder then they won’t be able to press charges anyway.”
“So, killing like that, with the skill and ease. You gotta be an army boy. But you would have flagged if you were army unless your file was redacted for some reason. I’m guessing special ops or Delta squad but that’s a guess.” Fury replied, holding his hands up at the last part.
“Ross doesn’t care.” Fury replied, “He’s out for blood. As far as he’s concerned you and Rumlow are the same now. The same kind of threat, he’s brutal. He’s already reassigned Rhodes to his unit.”
They all were, Steve knew, and he’d seen Thor swing that hammer enough to know that he never missed his target.
He needed to find him.
A few more thrusts and Steve was coming as well, releasing into the condom as he was buried to the hilt in Tony as his orgasm racked his body with a flood of pleasure and Tony’s name from his lips. He buried his face into Tony’s neck, feeling his arms wrap more securely around his frame as Steve shuddered in pure ecstasy.
“Shit.” Tony swore, thinking back to his conversation with Steve earlier, how withdrawn he had seemed, how final their kiss at the door felt. “He wouldn’t.”
“Neither.”
The angle was wrong, it was too tight for what they needed. Tony was still attacking his earlobe with little bites and the occasional kiss below it and Steve could feel his ragged breath against his skin, god he was so turned on.
Tony didn’t even blink as he shrugged his own jacket off and let it fall to the floor. Steve just watched him. The match had been struck.
“I understand that you’ve always been an idiot. I understand why you think the safety of this family is only on you.” Bucky told him, “I also understand that if Rumlow is coming for us then you’re the only person who might stand a chance against him. Not the cops, not a specialist unit. You. But you can’t do that without our help.”
“Sounds like you’d need a navigator, someone in the passenger seat with the map when you eventually got lost and ended up in a backwater town and nothing for miles in any direction.”
Steve couldn’t stop moving, pacing back and forth simply to have something to do. He was never good at being still, even in the army. He often challenged orders to stay put if there were lives in danger. Now, Tony’s life was in danger and Steve found those old habits return to him as easily as breathing.
But to get to him here, with cops on the payroll and in a city they all knew so well they could make it work. It was their best chance and it was the only chance they had.
“It was a good plan before Rumlow went off script.” Steve sighed, “Clint?”
“I sorta like having you around too, big guy.” Tony told him, the strength of those words carrying in the space between them.
“My dad’s an asshole.” Tony offered with a grin.
“You want me?” Steve breathed into his ear, cock nudging his ass.
“The one who got away?” Tony guessed, bringing the coffee up to his lips to take a sip.
But Brooklyn was still his city and he refused to let it go without a fight.
“How did you get out of the desert?” Ross tried a third time.
“I’m not handing myself over to Rumlow, but this plan won’t work and when it fails, you’ll all be in the firing line.” Steve replied, “So, you need to walk away. Now. Forget about me. I can’t give you anything.”
"Before I kill you, I just want you to know why," Steve whispered in the space between them, "why you had to die tonight. Why Rumlow will fall. Why I'm going to enjoy it." He squeezed his finger a fraction, waiting for the whimper from the other man, "You went after him. That's why you're dead. You dared to go after Tony."
Tony was picking at his nails nervously by the time Bucky had driven them back to Steve’s place. He had offered to take the drive back as soon as they left Howard’s office and the thought of facing Steve again was at the forefront of Tony’s mind. Now he was back facing this house again he was glad Bucky was in the driving seat.
Still, Bruce and Natasha had made popcorn. Sam had brought a case of beer with him and Clint had emerged from his room with most of his DVD collection for them to chose from. And just like that, it was movie night.
“Those cops were hard asses.” Clint replied, “They’re determined to get an arrest on this one.”
“Bucky,” He started, swallowing around the lump in his throat, “It isn’t what it looks like…”
He unlocked his screen with a press of his thumb on the pad and the dim light of his home screen flashed up. Everyone else was watching the film with earnest interest, they didn’t realise Steve was occupied with something else.
Steve laughed, “That means I’ll see you around.”
She nodded once, “We’ll go in under the radar. I’ll handle Hydra, can you disarm the bombs?”
“So, distract me.” Rhodey insisted.
“So, here’s what we think,” Rhodey supplied, “Stop me when I get it wrong. Your Captain is doing his seedy business at the docks, our PC stumbles across it. Wrong place, wrong time and you guys can’t get let him go. That would be sloppy so one of you puts a bullet in his head.”
Tony rolled his hips at the idea, smile of his face wide, “In your vintage getaway car? Is this some fantasy of yours?”
“The same as ever. Baby won’t sleep through the night. We’re running on coffee and routine at this point.” Adam replied, “Sorry to hear about Coulson.”
“Make a statement about tonight’s events. A testimony to Steve Rogers’ killings and his gang activity. In return I won’t charge you with being an accessory to murder.” Ross replied.
Tony found him later that day, coming home from a shift at the garage with grease on his cheek and a smile on his face. Carefree, happy, at least for a moment. He pushed his way into Steve’s bathroom on his floor, blinking his eyes against the steam and heat coiling up from the tub. Steve was reclined in the bathtub, back resting against one end with his feet at the other.
He was quick, Steve was quicker. He was in his opponents’ personal space in seconds, twisting the hand holding the gun up so the barrel was pressing under the hydra man's chin. Both his and Steve's fingers were locked on the trigger.
Tony might wake up and come to his senses about just how bad an idea last night was and then they’d have to do that awkward thing where Steve pretended he had somewhere to be and Tony pretend that he didn’t know it was a lie.
Steve ignored him, “But try and be discreet, okay? Tasha lives here too and I don’t want her to feel uncomfortable.”
“We need to get on the inside.” Tony replied, “I can do it. Rhodey is working on the unit under Ross. He’s my best friend. I can get in to see Steve.”
It was the shift in the air that told the true story.
“Is this okay?” Tony asked, “It’s not too tight?”
Steve turned to look her at, this young woman whom once had been a fifteen-year-old kid on the wrong side of starving, "I can't make you sign them. I won't force you, it's your decision."
He moved back over to the bed, taking time to look over at Steve. He looked so peaceful when he slept, almost vulnerable. He was on his back, that impressive chest on display with the midnight blue sheets pooling around his waist. Tony could see a hint of the bruise he left on Steve last night peeking from under the sheet on his hip. There was a piece of blonde hair curling over his forehead and Tony resisted the urge to push it back behind Steve’s ear. He didn’t want to wake him.
Well, that was a new one.
“Didn’t you ever find it odd how the special task force only seemed to focus on coming after The Avengers?” Rumlow spat out, blood coating the floor as he turned to turn on his side, “They didn’t so much as pull one of my men in off the streets.”
Rumlow smirked then, cold and smug and Tony hated it, “Yes, you are. Then when you’re done with the missile, you’re going to tell me everything you know about The Captain. His team, who he is.”
That was one of the best things about Natasha in Steve’s opinion. That unwavering trust she placed in him, like she knew he’d sort it somehow. “Winter, I need you to get rid of the bodies. Discreetly and permanently. Widow, get that car out of here and ditch it. Get my bike back to base and get someone in to fix it. I want it done before we have another run in with Hydra.” They both nodded and Bucky was already leaning down to move Sitwell’s body, “Thor, can you head down to the docks? They pulled him because of a body they think belongs to us. I need to know the details. Report back to me with what you find, okay?”
Tony could feel his heart rate pick up speed, “Are you sure about Ross? Maybe he just wants a win in Brooklyn so he can go back to where the hell they shipped him in from.”
That got Tony to smile, it was small but Steve could feel his relief and was glad that it broke through his haze, “It’s weird…” He trailed off slowly, like he was finding the words.
It was nice, this little safe haven carved out of Tony’s life. Tony’s skin against his. Steve managed to find enough strength to haul Tony in close to him, arms tight around the mechanic while he buried his nose into Tony’s hair and then he was out like a light, barely feeling the kiss Tony placed over his heart softly as he relaxed into him.
He crept across the hall to Steve’s private bathroom quickly, trying not to wake the mob boss. He grabbed some water from the tap in there and spared a moment to look at himself in the mirror hanging over the sink. He was wild, dark hair curling slightly and nothing more than a mess on the top of his head. Steve’s t-shirt was too big, revealing more of Tony’s collarbones than a normal one would. He could see the dark bruise blooming on his neck from Steve’s mouth last night. A visual mark of possessiveness that made Tony’s gut warm and a smile curve onto his lips at the thought of his mark also present on the skin of Steve’s hipbone.
“Come on.” Fury replied, guiding Steve down the hall and towards Tony.
Ross scowled, “Did you kill three of our cops when they stumbled upon your gang activity?”
“Come now, Captain. We’re discussing business, not murder tonight.” Sitwell tried to reason.
“I’d rather not.” Tony sighed, stepping closer to Howard even though every instinct was telling him to run. Bucky moved with him, silent but never far away, “I’m here for business.”
“Written confession after the immunity, not before.” Steve replied, “I really have to insist on that. I want Detective Fury in charge of it. Not you.”
Natasha nodded, “He’d probably take it better. You don’t know what it’s like to have to kill someone because it’s you or them, Tony. That’s what Bucky’s worried about. He doesn’t want you to judge Steve because of the things he’s done or try and change him when there’s a turf war going on.”
“Bullshit.”
Steve frowned, “He does. Does it bother you?”
“You don’t hurt them.” Tony spat out, “I’ll build your missile, and you leave them both alone. That’s the deal.”
He gave him some time to cool off, heard the shower start up and later heard his footsteps trudging back down the stairs making a beeline for the garage. Was this cold and aloft shell more of The Captain than Steve Rogers?
“Thank you. Leave us.” Ross motioned to the cop that had brought Tony in. There was an exchange of nods between them and the cop slipped out, leaving Tony and Ross alone in the broom cupboard of an office with everything surging between them like a river.
Tony glanced that way as well; Bucky was as firm as ever. “He is.” Bucky replied and Tony couldn’t help but feel shocked at those words leaving Bucky’s mouth.
Before he could talk himself out of it, Steve turned on his heel and headed for the kitchen. He needed a piece of paper or something so he could at least leave Tony a note. He didn’t want Tony to think he regretted their night together or that he was simply using him. Steve didn’t know why he cared but he did, he needed Tony to know that if nothing else.
Rhodey took the drink with a nod, “You heard about the cop killings?”
Tony was at the garage, putting in the hours he missed whilst the whole Hydra mess was going down. Steve wanted to send someone with him but he refused, in no polite terms, because he was a mechanic and this was his day job.
Natasha pulled back, punched him hard in the arm and smiled wide again, “Anyone would think you like being a self-sacrificing idiot.”
“Who was on the phone?” She asked as she removed the other slipper, flexing her feet out in front of her.
“Fury gave me the day. He has a meeting later, I think. You know me, I’m not good at doing nothing so I thought you could distract me.” Rhodey replied sheepishly.
Steve frowned, mocking shock, “Are you ashamed to me seen with me, Detective?”
Was he broken?
“You set up a very nice picture in my head whilst I was working myself open for you. Time to pay up.”
Tony felt the fist colliding with his cheek, heat and pain spreading through his cheek towards his eye socket. He bit his tongue to stop himself from calling out, cheek flaming as he narrowed his eyes at Rumlow. That would bruise.
He settled back into the bed; legs crossed with the sketchpad in his lap. He spared a glance at Steve, drawing his bottom lip into his mouth before darting his eyes back to the book in his hand and opening the front page.
“Steve?” Rumlow’s voice asked, he seemed unsure like he was still remembering their army days in his mind. Steve froze. Fuck. He didn’t reply, couldn’t find the words. Rumlow continued though, “Steve Rogers? There’s only one person I know who’d be that much of a righteous ass and I thought he died in Afghanistan.”
He placed his glass down on the bar, “That won’t be necessary. Just let me buy you a drink and we’ll call it square?”
“A little dramatic, don’t you think?” Tony asked quietly, eyes on the flames.
“Our Captain and the team often need patching up, it made it easier if I was here rather than them coming into my clinic and scaring my patients.” Bruce replied, making his way through the kitchen and down towards the basement.
He thrusted back into Tony in time with his hand on his own cock, feeling Tony pant against him at the onslaught of sensations. He was shaking and squirming with his pleasure, trying to fall into it. Steve knew he’d cum hard.
Bucky stopped moving to Steve’s left, standing straighter and squaring his shoulders. A few strands of hair had escaped the bun he favoured but Bucky didn’t move to get them out of the way. The meeting had started.
“I’m not. Rumlow started it the moment he decided to make bombs in my city.” Steve replied, shrugging out of his leather jacket, “Let’s get you home.”
Ross shrugged, “I’ll be interviewing him after this.”
“Ross?” Steve bit out, chest tight.
“Like this?” Steve breathed into his ear, “You want me to take you like this, so hard this desk is going to give you bruises and I wouldn’t be able to work at it without thinking about the way you sound when you cum?”
“The mechanic?”
Oh. Oh.
“Really Captain? Breaking out of jail just to wrack up your body count? You’re just making my job easier for me.” Ross said, walking towards them slowly.
“How?” Steve asked, “What do you need?”
The Mechanic didn’t seem to be concerned, “That explains your face paint. Red’s not exactly your colour.”
Steve kept his view straight ahead, “We stop Rumlow. Whatever it takes.”
“You don’t get to decide something like that for me.” Bucky spat out, “It’s your body, I know it’s your choice but the least you could have done was told me. Instead I had to find a leaflet in your room and connect the dots. You owed me more than that.”
Brock Rumlow.
Steve frowned, “You want me to hang myself? Make it easy for you?”
Steve had a front row seat to that pleasure like this, Tony Stark in his lap, chasing his own arousal and what a sight that was.
Sam had placed his drink down with a smile but business was busy tonight so he couldn’t stop and chat like they normally would. Steve waved him away with a hand, they could catch up when it died down later. For now, he was content to sip his bourbon and try to push the fear of Hydra coming after his family from his mind.
Steve sighed, “Look who got off their ass and decided to do something.”
“Me too.” Steve assured him.
He glanced back at Tony, who was doing as good a job of holding himself together as he could. Steve had released his hand to turn on the shower and let the water warm up and Tony had wrapped his arms around himself instead like he was trying not to lose anything.
He wasn't really expecting to.
Tony mouthed an ‘I love you’ in the space between them and that was all it took for Steve to cum, buried deep inside Tony with a pained gasp and Tony’s hand gripping his on his chest. He pumped Tony still, riding out his wave as he felt the slick of Tony’s cum dribbling onto his fist. Tony leaned his head back, causing Steve’s forehead to bump his nose because of how close they were, and he was coming too. A shudder of silent pleasure as he fell apart in Steve’s arms.
Steve frowned, “I’m not some puppy you can pass around.”
Steve frowned, “Detective, I don’t think you realise how this works. I help you when it benefits me, you don’t get to give me orders. No one does anymore.”
“Then I’ll have to pay your friends a little visit.” Rumlow said, “The hardworking cop. Rhodes, right? We’re watching him, I had considered making him the next murdered cop. Fury would have to make an arrest for his own partner surely?”
“We need to move him to his bedroom; he’ll be more comfortable there.” Bruce told Steve, “Sam, I’ll need you to come with us. We need to start with the blood transfer while he’s resting. I want to give him chance to heal.”
“How did he take your request?”
“Is underway. Or it will be when Rumlow sees this.” Steve replied, stepping over a slumped body.
"I ain't afraid of you." Was the reply.
And then what? Go after Rumlow, stop him. He’d be a wanted man, a fugitive. He’d have to leave Brooklyn and his family and Tony anyway because there was no way Ross would just let him go. But he’d be free, they could all start over. Maybe they could join him in a new city when the dust settled or maybe they could all part ways here. Bucky and Natasha could retire, they could mend their relationship and have a shot at a family. Bruce could go back to being an actual doctor and Sam could focus on the bar. He wanted to franchise once, maybe without the gang he could.
“No one has to know.” Tony said, “In and out, I swear.”
“I’d rather die than build you anything.”
When Bucky poked his head around the corner Steve had been planning on how to break into the morgue to see the body or the possibility of bribing a coroner for his report to see what they showed. His hand was moving of its own accord, as it always did when he was stressed, sketching in the corner of the crime scene file on his desk.
“Yeah, normal people.”
Steve wanted to immediately grab a pen and sign it, but he held back, the paper in his hands feeling heavier than it actually was. He couldn’t make this decision for them; he wouldn’t sign away their right to choose this for themselves although Steve knew he would urge every member of his family to sign on the dotted line if it meant protection.
“This one is personal, Rogers. Coulson was one of my best.” Fury stated firmly.
Tony lingered in the doorway; shoulder propped up against the doorframe, but Steve felt his eyes on him. He didn’t look awkward, just apprehensive. He wasn’t sure how this would go; he wasn’t sure of his place outside of their relationship yet. Steve remembered feeling the same way when he had first taken over from Phillips, the rolling uncertainty of what steps to take. They’d come, Steve knew, having had to carve out his own to get this far.
Fury frowned, “Then we go back to our own sides of the fence and I hope I never have to cross paths with you again.”
Tony smiled, “That’s why you love me. I challenge you.”
“He’s for the people as well.” Tony told Hammer cockily.
“Lucky for us, politicians never stop working.” Steve replied over his shoulder as he passed his bike to head out, already dialling a number into his phone.
The next minutes would be crucial and he needed to focus.
Steve smiled, “Who says we’re finished yet?”
Bucky nodded once, “What’s our next move?”
Tony managed a shit eating grin, giving them a little wave with his gloved hand.
“If I’m not working, I’ll be there in 20 minutes. No questions asked.” Steve promised.
Tony moved his feet from Steve’s waist, planting them on the edge of the table, knees bent until his ass was almost in the air. Steve understood immediately, moving his fingers to Tony’s hole with a practiced ease. He probed gently, tip of his finger pushing against Tony’s resistance until Tony was shaking with impatience and glaring at Steve like he wanted to shout out at him for taking so long. Steve waited until Tony’s eyes focused on him and pushed the first finger inside him. Tony shuddered at the intrusion, walls tightening and relaxing against his finger as Steve pumped in and out of him slowly, one hand on his knee to steady himself from his own pleasure building at having Tony like this.
The guy looked at him with wide eyes, unsure and holding onto his gun with a vice like grip. He was holding it too tight, that grip must be killing his arm. Steve held up his hands, gun in his left with the barrel pointed out to the side like a sign of surrender.
“I can’t kiss you like this.” Steve said after a moment, pulling at his ties again as if they might have a little more give in them.
How could Steve refuse?
“Steve, listen to me.” Fury turned to face him then, his one eye trained on his face, “Special Branch don’t care about who is responsible. They want all the gangs out of Brooklyn by Christmas. Hydra, Avengers, it all goes. It’s not about justice anymore, it’s extermination.”
Steve would love it. He’d love anywhere with Tony. But first they needed to get this done. He thought about Bucky, back at home under Bruce’s care with Sam giving him blood and Clint stealing what they needed from a hospital to make sure he got through this. He needed to do this, for Bucky, for himself, for their family.
The silence the followed was louder than their words before. Tony was just standing there, device still in his hands, not believing his own words. Steve looked equally as shocked, those blue eyes wide and searching.
“Yeah, I’ve only just found out. He doesn’t know who I am yet otherwise I’d be dead but if he figures it out…”
Rhodey was looking at Tony, “Okay, then what?”
Tony whined, struggling to find an angle that allowed him to take Steve deeper, that would get Steve to hit that spot inside of him that would make him shudder. Their pleasure was mounting, and this slow teasing wasn’t going to be enough for either of them soon.
Tony sighed at himself in the mirror, letting the covers drop to the floor as a mark of his commitment to this plan. He needed a sandwich too, maybe a sub from Peter’s favourite shop. He could bring the kid one too as a peace offering.
Tony nodded, “That was true once but honestly, I’d rather take the heat then watch this company’s body count rise.”
He lowered his gun, tucking it back into his jeans as he ushered Fury inside the house, “It’s been a long night.”
He finished the second device only a few hours ago, using rudimentary theory he’d learnt from watching Howard build explosives for years. He had to find a way to slip it to Steve. The device was a small black box, similar to a kitchen timer with a kill switch. Steve just needed to place it by the lock and stand back. It should be able to fry the electronic locking system without alerting anyone to the fact Steve’s cell was open but from there Steve would be on his own.
He clung to Rhodey greedily, hands wrapping around him as Tony buried his nose into Rhodey’s shoulder and inhaled the scent of spices and stale coffee that clung to Rhodey since he joined the force. Rhodey held him in a fierce grip, protective and safe. Tony wanted to start crying all over again.
