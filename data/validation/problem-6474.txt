Ok, so... maybe he was. Whatever, in this new timeline, these would always be the events that occurred. Luckily he didn't have to worry about nasty paradoxes and whatnot according to Bruce (who he trusted more then Howard, actually). "It's fine Howard. Can you let me out of this fucking cage."
"No," Steve says almost frantically, leaning into Tony's hand. "You're all I'll ever need. All I want."
What the hell was Sam getting at? "Well, he's got Becca, but she.. well you know what she did." At her own wedding, a few years after the car crash that took Ms. and Mr. Barnes, she had thrown a tantrum about Bucky's choice in a date to the event, who happened to be Sam. She wanted him to bring a girl, maybe even someone from their hometown or one of her friends. At the time, Sam and Bucky had only been going out for a few months, so when she pulled that crap, Bucky had a pretty severe panic attack. He didn't end up attending the actual wedding due to the fact that she had freaked out on him the day before. Steve still went, if only to make it clear to her that she had been a bitch and that Sam was a great guy. He had been invited too because they had all hung out a little when they were teens, which meant he got a front row view of her screaming about how she didn't care if her brother was a queer, but she didn't want him making her look bad at her wedding. Steve was pretty sure they hadn't spoken since, which would make him the closest thing Bucky has to family. "So yeah, me I guess. Why?" He says, pulling the final chair down.
Wednesday comes too fast and not fast enough all at once. Steve is standing in front of his mirror when 7:00 comes around, fiddling with his shirt. He's wearing a crisp blue shirt and black pants with his hair mussed up. He couldn't help but feel like he was wearing way too much for Italian. It was too late to change now, but he still feels like an idiot. He picks up his phone, flipping it in his hands a few times nervously. He checks the text from Tony at 7:02. Indeed, he had said 7, so Steve wasn't crazy, but Tony wasn't there yet. Maybe this was all an elaborate joke on him. Who the hell was Steve to think that he was going to date a celebrity. Really, he had looked up Tony and he was amazing. He was perfect. He was a good guy, even if he ended up in the press a lot. Steve knew that he couldn't trust everything the press said about Tony, Tony had told him as much. Well, unless Tony was a bad person and he lied and now he was just fucking with Steve—
It was alright, but it still hurt. He shouldn't have thought he was going to go see Tony anyways. He did it to himself.
"Good. I wouldn't want to have chased you off so soon," he teases, taking another bite slowly. His eyes slip shut in a satisfied look. Seems like Steve would just have to learn to make tiramisu.
And above all, the idea that everything went how it had to. He hears a strangled, pitiful sound come out of his throat, then he feels pain splitting through his knees. Two hands find his cheeks moments later, and he returns to reality to find Morgan's face in front of his. "Don't cry Mr. Steve." He pulls the girl to his chest, giving her the biggest hug he can muster.
As if that explains anything. Still, he can't help but take it as an acceptable answer and move on with his life. The reasons why Nat does what she does range from to confuse people to literally no reason to to kill people to for the aesthetic. He had known her long enough to just accept it. "So I know he killed JFK in '63, and the Starks in '91."
"Pleasure. I was just telling Gideon how sad I was that he wouldn't be joining the cast of WWIII. I think he would be just perfect in the role of a young Howard Stark, don't you?" She says it so easily, like it isn't an absolutely crack head thing of her to say.
"We've dome it before," Natasha says, peeling herself away from Steve's chest, but still holding onto his shoulder. He rests a hand on her elbow to keep her steady. "Can you take the stone out of me?"
Tony sticks his tongue out at Steve. "You're bullying me. Come on, you have to do embarrassing things."
He's nothing, he's nothing, he's everything. He wakes up with a gasp to a too bright room, with wires poking out of him everywhere he looks. The monitor begins beeping frantically and around the corner appears a girl peters age with her hair braided up into a bun. Shuri. He was in Wakanda.
"MJ, you can come up here," Steve says. Tony makes a kissy face at him and he rolls his eyes. She does come and looks between them, and their joined metal arms.
Then the entire room undergoes a  well rehearsed transformation into a ballroom with tables and chairs around the back side of the first floor. The second floor was already set up for eating. In less than 10 minutes, the had all the food set up and all the tables made for the guests to return to. Sarah announced that they could eat whenever, and then Sam and Bucky had their first dance, to nothing other than Shake it Off by Taylor Swift, a choice that Steve has adamantly recommended against. Only then is the dance floor opened up, and therefore only then does Tony appear in front of where Steve was sitting. "You look great. Did you cry? I'm pretty sure you cried. Not that I'm judging, I think it's cute. Do you want to dance."
Tony curls into his lap, burying his face in Steve's neck in a show of both physical vulnerability— which Steve was moderately used to by now—and emotional vulnerability—far more out of the norm for them. They hadn't been dating for much more than a month, and in that month, nothing bad had happened. At least, nothing that required Tony to express emotional vulnerability, there was that one time Steve had a nightmare, but that was another story entirely. A nearly inaudible whimper escapes his lips, and Steve tightens his arms around Tony's back. "I don't wanna have sex tonight," he says equally as quietly, so it takes a moment for Steve to accept that he hadn't imagined it. After all that hurrah downstairs, he had been expecting almost no matter the circumstances.
Steve nods in eager affirmation, a bright red flush on his cheeks. Tony pushes through the door behind him, glancing around at the empty bathroom and locking the door. Tony leans onto Steve's shoulder to take his earlobe between gentle teeth. Steve gasps gently, gripping Tony's shoulders. "You know the safe words," he mutters, breathing hotly onto Steve's pretty neck.
They land a little less then a mile from the base, it's metal gates imposing on them. He knows that Tony—his Tony was just here. But that wasn't his mission. He.. couldn't. "Now what?" Her voice is gentle, like she knows, although he hadn't explicitly said that Tony was gone.
Steve had stumbled into the lab, his whole body shaking with the tremors. Tony had taken him up to his floor, and made him up a big meal, claiming his childhood nanny had taught him to cook before she died. The following day, without having even been asked, Tony had completely stocked the common floor with all their favorite foods, probably using Jarvis to see what they all liked.
Steve swallows the knot in his throat. "Yes, the late Mr. Malik positioned is within SHIELD to gather intel on what they were doing and what Zola was doing."
"Stevie, can you help Peter with his wounds? I've got some kids to take care of." Steve nods, and Tony gets up, tugging on the suit he happens to be still wearing from the press conference. "Fri, open the door." The ramp lowers and Tony walks out. "Happy!" He shouts, holding his arms open in a rather dramatic gesture.
Tony raises his brows. "It would be hard not to get that scraped up in events like these. It's a miracle you're all okay." That apparently satisfies all their questions to the point where they just don't have the energy to prod deeper, so no words are spoken until Steve rises to his feet, patting Peter's shoulder.
A small smile creeps onto Steve's face. "Exactly right. And at the wedding, you played some rock music too."
"I'm from California. Now I work for... a man who may be interested in what you're doing for the government." He picks up a packet of Splenda, slowly tearing it open while his eyes flicker between the two of them. He dumps it into the cup of coffee, swirling it around a few times.
I did a probably ridiculous amount of research to find the perfect assassination to credit to the Winter Soldier in a semi-convenient time frame for our protagonists before finding Georgi Markov's assassination. He was an anti-communist dissident and a writer who was shot at close range with a gun disguised as an umbrella. The bullet was a ricin filled pellet, a poison to which there was no known cure at the time. Nobody was ever directly linked to the assassination, but the KGB admitted to that assassination and a prior failed attempt on a different target in the same manner. You can look up the wiki page on it, it's actually pretty interesting.
The dinosaur lunged forward, ripping the leash out of the young girl’s hands. Her father and friends raced to catch the dinosaur before it reached the two barking dogs and their yelling owner. Tony and Rhodey stepped forward. Tony held out his cane and Rhodey caught the end of it to set up a barrier to stop the dino. The dino ran right into the cane and dropped to the pavement like a lead bullet.
“Okay, I guess you’ll be a city dinosaur again,” Steve said. “But that means wearing a collar and leash.”
Oh man. Not even five minutes in and I'm gonna be chewed out. Tony wants to flee but he's rooted on the spot.
He grabbed an oil-cloth poncho before stepping out on the deck to clear his head and stuff down his suspicions. He turned the corner on the deck and there was Rogers with his dinosaur on a leash.
“All right. You sound like an Anti-Dinosaur crusader there, Tones. I wouldn’t be asking about a dino if my niece wouldn’t be a responsible pet owner. My family has had every pet under the sun from dogs and cats to birds and guinea pigs and lizards.”
Bruce said, “No, by the time I was hired, the semester had started and the department didn’t have lab space. So putting off the job until next fall won’t hurt anyone. Plus I expect to get a few papers out of this trip.” He had a notebook full of equations, drawing and snippets of writing set out on his knee.
“Oh.” She looked at the cards. “I didn’t think that when I made the seating arrangements. The Captain clearly prefers your company to mine.” She laughed a little. “You young folks and your technology.”
Maybe he can give it a try while the ship's docked somewhere so he could take off for a while when Steve rejects him. Give his friend some time to forgive him for stomping all over the status quo. Or maybe he'd stick it out. No one has to know but them It'll be awkward for a while. Their friendship can withstand a little failed love confession, right?
Tony grins, stepping closer. His heartbeat is deafening but he congratulates himself for his smooth delivery. "Are you asking if I feel the same or if you can kiss me?"
“I don’t know.” She paused. “There was a singer who had one, then they were everywhere in the fashion magazines and society papers. A lot of my friends are on waiting lists. The demand is very high.”
"Got a client nearby," The man, Matt, replies. He cocks his head, like an animal listening closely to something. "Since when did you get yourself another Stark, Cap? He sounds like this one. Except without the--" he gestures to the reactor. "That is Stark, right?"
"Would you like to though?" Stark prompts. "Cause if he's anything like my Steve, he might be more open to it than you think."
Besides the official reason for his joining the expedition, Tony planned on figuring out how dinosaurs were taken from the Savage Land, bound for pet stores in New Timely and other places. He’d made inquiries during the weeks of planning. No one he found or any of his leads had solid information on how the dinosaurs were arriving. But there was a breeding association already dedicated to establishing formal standards for dinosaurs and the board of governors refused to discuss the likely illegal origins of their supposedly well-bred pets.
Pepper smiled slightly and tapped the end of her pen on her chin. “Seriously, Tony, they do need an answer. If you decline, they need time to find someone else. As it is, we’re cutting it close with the dinner being held next week.”
Tony noticed out of the corner of his eye a small girl in a plaid pinafore holding a leash. Her dinosaur was straining at the end of said leash, lurching to the left and to right, focused on the two dogs behind Tony. He did a double take. That dino had to be a Deinonychus, a very young one based on its size. It would tear the dogs apart in seconds, if Tony remembered his dinosaur facts right.
"Their union was most glorious." Thor is laughing now but allows Stark to shove him toward the sofa. "We were very grateful for the soundproofing."
“Right. Of course,” Tony replied. He noticed the slim red-headed woman accompanying Rogers. She was dressed for the theatre in a dark dress with simple trimmings and hat with veil and held an intricately beaded purse. Rogers was holding a cape that belonged to her in one hand, apparently interrupted in the process of leaving their outerwear at the coat check.
“And what about the thefts from Stark Industries? What did they steal there? Pym makes more than control collars,” Steve reminded him.
Wilson got up. “Not spending a lot of time getting ready for the dinner? Natasha will be disappointed.”
Steve fumbled putting his glass down on the table, rattling the plates and the silverware and nearly splashing the wine out of the glass. He tamped down the completely ridiculous and strange idea for a Saturday date. He needed more sleep.
Just as he says it, a huge power surge lights up the HUD, flashing red. One of the large cube shaped things underground has been turned on. "Did you guys get that?"
By all possible standards, Tony was a very gorgeous man. Steve had been surprised at first to see Lord Tony Stark a regular feature of the social papers. But seeing the man in action, Steve was amazed that the man did not have a dedicated newspaper tracking all the amazing, talented things Tony did daily.
The basement is mostly empty now with the scientists hurrying to escape the carnage and the fire and explosions.
When Tony needed a specific ink for his mechanical drawings, both Bruce and Hope referred him to Steve, who indeed had the requisite ink. Steve also had some excellent drafting paper.
It turned out that Tony was the last one to know about Captain Rogers the artist. Bruce, Hope, Scott and Jane all knew about Steve’s talents. Hope laughed at Tony when he told her. “Who do you think I ask about cleaning up my field drawings?”
Tony led Steve in a simple two-step across the roof under the early summer moon. The city lights glowed brightly as the music curled around them. Steve might have stolen a kiss here and there as they danced with their hearts full.
"We should show him a good time. Don't think I didn't notice all your blood drain south when you realized who was in the suit." Stark teases some more. “Could be fun to see how you do with two of us instead of just me.”
"You do not take down, MODOK! MODOK is superior!" The giant head screeches again and fires a blast of red beam at him.
Dora Milaje led them in circles so they would lose sight of the restaurant. On their way back to the expedition hotel, Tony and Rogers walked along one of the harbor’s seawalls. Rogers stopped and leaned on the fence, holding his hat in his fingers. Tony hated himself for noticing how the afternoon sun shone on Rogers’ golden hair. Rogers was unfairly gorgeous right there and then, almost distracting Tony away from the problem on hand.
Tony heard the door rattle and looked down to see a dinosaur beak poking out of the crack. “Captain?”
See, Steve, eventually, decides that he isn’t going to waste time pining anymore. Because you know what, he loves Tony, and he needs to try and take the plunge. Worst case scenario, he loses a friend – but Tony’s not like that. He’s still friends with Pepper Potts, who he dated for a long time before they broke up. Tony won’t throw away a friendship because one party’s romantic feelings aren’t requited.
Tony drummed his fingers on the desk, stalling for time. He always looked forward to the Annual Dinner with buoyant enthusiasm. Food was always excellent, the company scintillating, and the after dinner talk compelling. But this year ….
Tony is watching TV in the living room when the rest of the Avengers trudge in, the adrenaline from battle still present but less than it was after an hour of clean up and debrief. He looks up, cataloguing each of his new-found friends. "You guys alright?
"It was a good date, beloved. Everyone had fun. Including the Hulk." Stark pats Steve's back in a 'there, there' gesture while trying to keep a straight face. Then he ruins it by adding, "Thunderball got Thor's hammer to the face. That was awesome! Do we still have footage of that fight, J?"
"More like SHIELD only noticed because Coulson's team was in the area a couple weeks ago on a whole unrelated mission and his science ducklings noticed the weird readings affecting their equipment." That’s Natasha chiming in this time.
Tony was making the rounds of the crowd, smiling and nodding, looking stunning in his pastel linen suit. Steve couldn’t tear his eyes away. Jan was overjoyed to be hosting the event where Steve and Tony debuted as the newest power couple in New Timely, Hope gleefully told him when Steve accepted the invite.
"I'm not the one battling magical ninja zombies with a baton once a week," Stark points out. "How's the new armor holding up?"
"Go home. You don't want to be here when SHIELD arrives. It'll save us all a headache." Stark tells Tony once they've secured MODOK. "Also, Coulson will give you paperwork."
“Tell the truth and everyone will be at each other’s neck in two weeks, guaranteed. Especially if we have more issues like those crates.”
“Yes. We need to go to our seats, Rhodey. See you next week, Captain.” Tony steered Rhodey over to the stairwell that led up to their box.
. I decided to go with early-616-based Pining! Idiots in love, Steve is bad at communicating his affection as romantic love clearly enough for dense Tony who is Angsting bc he thinks Steve couldn’t possibly love him beyond friendship, alas he will have to pine for the rest of his days! (not) Also secret identity thing, Steve doesn’t know Iron Man is Tony Stark!
A look of amusement passed over Rhodey’s face. But whatever he was thinking, he decided against sharing. Tony waited a couple of seconds before changing the subject.
He doesn't get a chance to respond as another familiar face rushes forward, keeping a defensible distance with a round red, white and blue shield between them.
“Hello,” Tony replied. He sat next to T’Challa as he felt the need for an ally in the room, given Pym’s intense dislike of anything Stark and the lack of Jan or Hope as a buffer. He’d hit it off with King T’Challa a couple of years ago at an event at the Club over a discussion of rare metals.
Dinner conversation dragged, of course, now that Tony had to entertain Captain Rogers. Rogers held himself stiffly and added very little to the lively conversation at dinner. Tony checked his pocket watch a few times to see when Fury would finally get the show on the road.
"One time, the Wrecking Crew robbed a bank while Cap and Tony were out having dinner. Cap got so annoyed, he punched all of Piledriver's teeth in with his shield," Sam tells Tony gleefully. "Then he made the Hulk smash the Wrecker into the pavement. Several times."
He's travelled far and wide on adventures and missions, and fought so many different types of alien races but this still feels like he's stepped into one of the comic books he read as a kid.
“I have Miss Potts make room on my schedule for a meeting,” Tony replied airily. “This sort of thing doesn’t need that much planning.”
Stark pats him on the back. "Let the kids check it out. They need the exercise. Besides, stealth isn't really our forte anyway."
Steve looked doubtfully down at Redwing, who hung around the pen gate, giving Steve the stink-eye and butting the gate every now then to let her people know it was okay to let her out now.
It was one of the New Explorers’ Club expeditions that had found him and the sorcerer Dr. Strange had been the key to springing Steve from the void.
"Sheriff, can you get me permission for a surprise inspection?" Tony hovers a hundred feet above the buildings in stealth mode, not wanting to reveal himself just yet and alert those on the ground.
"Tony---" the exasperated tone is familiar and the accompanying smile makes Tony’s chest ache. Unlike Tony, Steve blushes so prettily.
"Where does it lead?" he asks even as he walks toward the power source, dragging the scientist along with him. The portal is currently inert, but that doesn’t stop one particularly brave lady from firing a mini rocket launcher at him. Tony dodges, firing a repulsor blast in return without letting go of his captive. The woman slumps as a bank of computers and the wall far behind him explodes. Some of the lights go out.
Tony sold off his family’s home, fought like hell to remove and exile Stane, and went to New Timely to start all over again.
Pepper checked off her list. “I’ll prepare some appropriate remarks from Lord Tony Stark on the return of the Rogers Expedition.”
Steve reminded himself that was the plan and had always been the plan from the beginning. “You can work with her then, Wanda.”
“Hmmm.” He couldn’t imagine Redwing facing a velociraptor when her current sworn enemy was the carpet beater back home. “We’ll need to be careful with her pen.”
Tony had planned to pretend to listen to Rogers during his talk. But he kept getting drawn into his descriptions of Atlantis, bolstered by the illustrated lantern slides that were projected on the wall behind him. Rogers shone under the low lighting, looking far more handsome than he should have and Tony found him more distracting than expected.
“You didn’t know that Fury has been running a spy ring for the government on the side?” Steve asked, clearly baffled that Tony didn’t know this.
Steve wiggled as he felt for a sharp rock. Tony had to look away, as unprompted thoughts about better places and uses for the wiggle show filled his brain.
Steve bites into the delectable cookie, savoring it as it crumbles into his mouth. "I'm cursed, Nat. Cursed I say." He had only ever had one successful relationship, and even Peggy had ended it with him in a matter of months. She was engaged now too, and he was happy for her, really. It just stung a little.
Steve kisses him gently, pulling out his phone, and selecting the contact he had made for Peter. The phone rings once.. twice.. three times before Peter picks up. "What do you want, sir." The sir sounds almost tacked in as an after thought to the snappy remark. Well, it probably was.
"I know, I know." Steve however doesn't look up from his phone, staring at the proposed date. "Can you pick up the night shift on Wednesday?"
"Thank you," Pepper says, holding a gloved hand out to him. He takes it, with a smile. "So you and Tony?" She says, the words feeling almost double edged.
"Will you stop it," Steve says, swatting at his hand. He sighs, rubbing at his temple. "Sorry. Sorry."
Before too long, the wood is dry, and Tony starts it up with his laser finger... he would have to thank Bucky for that one when they see him again. The fire starts slowly, but it's there, and Tony is actually pretty proud of himself for that. Tony sits next to the fire and opens one of the food packets, biting into the overall bland bread and jerky. Better than nothing.
He sets a hand on her arm, smiling gently. "You too dear," he says, brushing past her and towards Steve, who was apparently too busy to notice his approach. He was not going to make a scene, so help him god, but his blood boiled over the flame in his chest. "Sorry to cut in, but I'd love to borrow my boyfriend for a moment," Tony says, grabbing Steve's wrist and putting his shoulder between him and the brunette.
"Wait, what do you mean? Steve, you told her you loved her." Bucky sounds almost scandalized, but Steve considers it payback for all the nasty shit Bucky did in their apartment all those years ago.
They wake up tangled together the next morning with golden light coming through the window in Steve's room, and to be frank, Steve couldn't possibly be happier that he wasn't scheduled today until 3.
"I wouldn't put it past him. He was pretty concerned about how your 40's sensibilities would mix with the 21st century." She pulls out two expensive looking bottles of vodka and jumps up onto the counter next to him, slipping into a crisscross position.
He doesn't move to her as much as he longed to be embraced. She didn't need that. "How'd you know?" He asks after a minute of choking out messy sobs.
Steve sets down his phone, looking up at Leo, who was standing behind the counter and banging on a bread machine. "I tried that!"
He laughs again, and Steve decided that he never wants him to stop. If he could pause the world right here, this wouldn't be such a bad place to stay forever. "You're only saying that because it's your favorite flavor."
Steve nods sporadically after a moment, "um good idea," he says, watching as Tony grins, then bobs his head down onto Steve's throbbing cock. He knew that for it to be this red, Steve had to be actually very close already, so with only a few practiced moves, he had Steve moaning like a virgin and coming undone, copious amounts of come spurting into his closed mouth. When Steve came, he came a lot—supposably, as far as Tony could tell, because his high metabolism produced a lot of sperm, especially when he was horny. That however, was irrelevant, because Tony was quite practiced at holding it all in his mouth when the situation called for it, and it did. When Steve is done, Tony pulls back and swallows down a full load, still holding enough come in his mouth for someone who was unpracticed to be choking on it. "Tony," Steve mutters, lugging Tony up so he was situated in Steve's lap, which he found to be only a little embarrassed. "Love you so much."
"From What Peter has told me, I had thought it would be harder to convince you." She pats his hand. "Would you like me to find Captain Rogers?"
Before Tony can retaliate and say something he'll probably regret a voice cuts through the howling wind. "Welcome." Steve draws his shield in sync with Tony's repulser charging up at the shadowy figure stepping towards them. "Tony, son of Maria. Steve, son of Sarah."
"Yeah. That's right, I got you." Tony tugs at the bottom of the cowl, lifting it off his face and flicking his wrist to retract his armor again before petting at his hair soothingly. "You're fine."
Steve pays them no mind as he grabs Natasha before she can hit the floor, her eyes glowing wildly as she stares up at him, clutching her throat. "Breathe Nat, breathe." He folds her into his chest, feeling her body tense up and slowly relax into tremors. He looks up and meets Thor's inquisitive eyes. "Long story. What do you know about the mind stone?"
"I love you too. We should get matching arms." Steve breaths in deeply, apparently savoring Tony's presence as much as Tony was.
She tilts her head at him, raising her brow in a way that almost reminds him of Tony. "You're welcome?"
"Nope. He said he had a thing with you." She squints at him. "That's true, right? He's not doing anything he shouldn't be?"
"Right, right, yes ma'am." He stumbles to his feet, brushing his pants of gravel. Steve hands over the power stone and Peter looks up at him. "Thank you for your aid, Captain America," he salutes Steve and Steve tries not to burst out laughing.
The rational part of Tony's brain has already forgiven the transgression, but his sore heart was not so easily deterred by Steves sweet innocence. "I did not tell you to flirt with everyone in this room." Tony pokes a finger into his chest.
"We're here for food and company, not looks," Steve says, slipping his hand back into Tony's, Tony responding by maneuvering his fingers to comfortably hold Steve's.
Tony groans, turning his tablet off and setting it on his chest. "That's just what the internet is like. They'll drop it in a few days."
As soon as he's gone, Tony slumps into Steve's arms, holding on for dear life. "Shh.. shh.. it's okay baby," Steve says, rubbing his back in soothing circles. "Come on, lemme take you up to your room." Tony nods, breathing in shakily. Steve leads him up the stairs to his room, pulling him onto a couch (apparently rich people have living rooms, and then more living room in their bedrooms? Don't ask Steve). "It's okay, baby. Peter's back. He's okay."
"I see." She tries to suppress a smile and makes not so subtle eye contact with Maria who giggles and shrugs. Now there was an interaction that Steve did not understand. He wasn't stupid, but he had unfortunately never really learned how to understand women. They usually just fell for his looks and his fame before getting to know him, which wasn't something he was really into. Well, it was fairly obvious that Steve didn't understand men either. He was—as the kids call it—a disaster bisexual. "So Steve, hows the future treating you? Has Howard made a flying car yet?"
He grabs the first aid kit and flips it open with his good arm, pulling out a roll of gauze, perhaps the happiest he's ever been to see a roll of gauze.
Steve knocks the chair over, it clattering to the floor loudly. "Sam!" He feels a grin blooming on his cheeks.
Tony can't help the surprised laugh. "You could just ask for a semi-public jealousy sex scene like a normal person, Rogers," he says, stretching his legs out and grinning at his absolute bastard of a boyfriend.
He hears Thor running after him, but pays him no heed as he bursts through a set of already splintered doors to find Natasha wrestling her arm away from a shadowy figure protruding itself through a splinter in the air. Frigga springs into action before Steve can, using magic to force the creature back through the splinter and close it. "The convergence shouldn't be happening yet," she declares, brushing her dress down. Steve's eyes land on the two enemy soldiers laying very very dead on the floor in a heap.
"God you're acting like a toddler," Steve says, quietly, the hand slipping up the back of Tony's shirt saying otherwise. The elevator opens for them, and Steve steps in, not waiting for the door to shut to press Tony roughly up against the wall of the elevator and kiss him deeply. Tony grins into the kiss as someone—Steve doesn't care who—pretends to gag behind them, pulling Steve down impossibly closer. "You're such a fucking brat," Steve mutters, tugging on Tony's hair gently.
"Working out. Congratulations, Howard." He hadn't seen them leave, but there had been a hastily scrawled note taped to the outside of his door when he woke up.
"Now who's ruining the moment." Steve rubs her back with his thumb. This was right. This was good. "We can go.. if you want."
She rolls her eyes. "Um, it was. I told him to bring a pretty date, or nobody at all so I could set him up with my friends."
Maybe he could wade through some poison ivy before the wedding. That would probably help him keep his damn head on. God damnit.
"Thanks," he says earnestly, not missing the pitying look Scott gives him before he turns away, walking out towards the garage. He appreciates it, really. But his mind was made up. He needed to leave. Maybe if he left—maybe he could move on. Move on from all his mistakes. It was a fool's errand, but he had to go. If he could, if there was even half a chance, he had to take it. He couldn't live his life with all this regret. It was too much for one man, no matter how strong he was. Nat had been his support system for five years, and he had just gotten Tony back.
"You hurt him again," James says. Tony mutters something along the lines of Jesus fucking Christ. "I break all your fingers." Yeah, Steve didn't exactly find himself doubting the merit to that statement. He was glad though. Glad to know that Tony had good people on his side, just like Steve's friends, all of whom he probably owed an explanation and apology to.
Tony nods his agreement, sliding his hands to lock around Steve's neck comfortably. "You know, this is probably going to be all over the tabloids tomorrow. Tony Stark sleeps with baker."
Ht unwraps the seat belt from around his arm, doing his absolute best to take the pain. If he were like 2% more unstable, he would be wishing he had some extremis right about now. "Jarvis, can you... unlock the gauntlet?" The gauntlet clicks, just above the break. Jarvis doesn't comment, probably so Tony could just focus on his task. His very painful task.
Before he can reach up to put a hand on her cheek, she jolts back, the sparks zipping out of existence. "Uh?" Nat says, confusion deeply set in her eyes.
They are also at a bit of an impasse in their delve into HYDRA and the KGB. Theoretically, it wouldn't be hard to infiltrate either, if they could find the right people. The two organizations were also working together, according to what Steve could glean from current texts and his memory. Who really knows though, it's all just propaganda against communism. Besides, according to all of this, HYDRA was eradicated in the 1940's by Captain America and the Howling Commanders.
Steve bites his lip, glancing over at Tony who is in the process of rolling his eyes. "Pepper, we talked it over."
As he grows nearer to the top, his thoughts turn to Nat, a bit guilty that he hadn't been thinking of her this whole time. She had never asked why he went to see Tony so often, only to return not an hour later. She had held him up when he cried, and he had returned the favor. With Clint gone, Thor loosing it, and Tony building a life, they had been all that was left of the original Avengers. All that was left to protect earth and guide it through the turmoil of the times.
“We stopped making those guns when I got out of the weapons business -- AIM must have stolen the plans from us.”
“The same. I heard about your recovery -- I wasn’t part of the team but I know of the good people involved,” Rhodey replied generously.
There was the single floor of cabins on this airship and Rogers’ cabin was located near the bow. Tony knocked on the door a few times, before he decided to find Rogers another time.
A couple of days later, Steve was reviewing all the map information on the Savage Land he had in his personal tent. Dr. Banner had just been in to visit him, overly excited about the possibilities of the Savage Land. “There have to be grasslands somewhere, considering the mammoths.” He’d pitched the idea of cutting their way through the rain forest towards his conjectured destination. Steve was far more skeptical of the plan, though he was encouraging.
As soon as Steve reached the camp, he had some semblance of a defensive plan. He issued a quick set of orders. Hope handed out the few guns they had on hand in case they were attacked by the local fauna.
Stark had a weapons background. He didn’t make them any more, but that didn’t mean that he lost all knowledge.
Reed updates them about his findings when they get to the workshop. It was a quick call. The search is still ongoing. They're getting that out of the way early because Steve and Stark are eager to show him their New York.
Tony watched Jan wave Pym over with a sinking feeling. She was on the verge of finding out Tony’s little subterfuge with the place cards.
Steve found that he had a spring in his step he hadn’t had since he returned from the Zeppelin War. And more often than not, that step brought him to Tony’s tent late after dinner, after the singing and the plays and the games. He had the excuse of walking Redwing for the night -- she wanted no part of Wanda’s rehabilitation efforts. And Redwing always strained on her leash when they reached Tony’s tent as she looked for him.
Rhodey looked thoughtfully at his drink. “More than thirty years is a long time to be away, Tony. Since his return, Rogers hasn’t exactly let the grass grow under his feet. He’s been Fury’s go-to man for expeditions. For me, I’m away from home for a week and the place feels different.”
“When can we free Redwing?” Wanda asked as Steve put Redwing into the pen so Clint could test the resiliency of the protective cover.
"Let me try something," Tony says even as he watches the ammunition being loaded. "This is Iron Man. I am here on behalf of SHIELD to ask a few questions about your unregistered operations in the area."
He went over to Redwing’s pen. She was scratching up the ground to pull up the last of the sweet grass. She bounded over to Steve, Tony and Sam and cooed merrily at them. Steve gave her a treat, opened the gate and walked towards the edge of the woods.
“Ship’s crew.” Wilson glanced at Rogers and then to Tony. “It has to be out now, Thor drinks with those guys.”
He tried to turn in his chair, which remained in place. “Clear my schedule -- I’m going to invent a swivel chair.”
"Funny you should ask that." He's stalling, not quite sure what's happening. Did he die? Is this some weird hallucination?
The ship steamed back to the Port City Protectorate as fast as their steam engines could propel the ship and all its cargo. Steve was of course uneasy about the load of restless prisoners on board. But they made it safe and sound into the harbor, with no fight from the prisoners.
"I'm happy for them." He means it, he really does, even if it makes his heart ache for the what-could-have-been in his universe.
“It’s not that,” Rogers said. “It’s not easy to keep a lid on things on a ship, Sam’s working to tamp down on any rumors about broken crates and theft. If we’re seen talking, it might attract eavesdroppers.”
He had arranged to meet Rhodey outside the ballroom near the coat check. He checked his cufflinks as he waited. All new couples were happy in the same way, caught up in each other and eager to show off their couplehood. Not that he was jealous of Rhodey. He couldn’t possibly be since he had watched Rhodey slowly fall for Captain Danvers. He watched his friends, arm in arm, walk towards him, with smiles on their faces.
"Nah. We can figure this out on our own. Go kick everyone's ass. I am happy not to be there," Stark replies and gets a kiss on the lips when Steve gets up.
"Do not joke about that!" Clint protests. "One of them will sell their soul to get the other one back and then we'd be in trouble."
“I wanted to check in about the cargo and if you had word that my equipment had been loaded into Barton’s ship.”
“Yeah?” Tony looks up at him hesitantly, “You were really- You’re not just humoring me?” He asks, and Steve huffs, nudging Tony with his elbow just a little.
“Of course, here,” Rogers replied, handing her a ticket from his pocket as she took the cape from his hand.
He walked forward another couple of steps, and immediately tripped off a snare. The snare wrapped around both of their legs, throwing them to the ground. The trap also set off a loud clanging noise as an alarm.
"Be careful of the mind blasts. Jarvis is shielded from being controlled but MODOK could still get you. Aim for that thing on his forehead."
"This is Tony. He's from an alternate universe. Tony, this is Matt Murdock. You need a lawyer, you call him. He does a lot of pro-bono."
Rogers sat down across the table from Tony. For all Tony could tell, it did not appear that Rogers was surprised by the meeting. He could not help but determine that he was the only one there who had not been let in on the great secret of the meeting. Rogers adjusted his jacket sleeve, revealing scratches on his wrist before he tugged his sleeve down.
Rogers had a fleeting pained look on his face. But he turned back to the window and whatever conversation he was having with Sam. Tony ignored the rising tension in the room as he joked with Bruce about his latest invention.
“Tony sure knows how to throw a party,” Clint said as they arrived at the restaurant, filled with music and all kinds of food laid out on serving tables.
Steve studied the baby sleeping in front of them. Wanda had already made a list of appropriate food and other things that they should know.
He blinked twice at the odd sight. The dinosaur slipped and twisted the leash around Rogers’ legs, sending the captain off balance and on his ass. Tony rushed over against his better judgment to help Rogers to his feet.
Tony balled up his napkin and tossed on the table. “Who do I need to talk to to get you off the Air Ship hook?”
“Our official goals are to gather specimens for the museum, conduct scientific explorations, and to map areas of the Savage Land. However, a number of us have additional missions.”
Steve was gorgeous under all those clothes and Tony couldn’t tear his eyes away. Steve had turned out to be a capable, strong, and intelligent man with unexpected fine qualities.
They were seated at their favorite table at Rhodey’s club, with an excellent steak dinner and well-aged wine. Rhodey’s club was all wood and thick carpets, the very epitome of an old established organization dedicated to the needs of the military. They even had a framed tribute painting of the war hero Captain Rogers installed just off the lobby.
Rogers shook his head tightly. “Sabotage can be spreading rumors to undermine the expedition. We already don’t know each other well enough. The wrong word in the wrong place at the wrong time, and there’s trouble in the team.”
Rogers huffed. He went through the expedition members and ticked off his fingers. “Can’t be that many besides me.”
Tony frowned as he looked at the roster. “Wait -- Miss van Dyne has a background in botany, I think -- or whatever Pym studied. I could use her.”
Tony was surprised that Rogers had brought the subject up, given his whole dino-owning thing. He found it deeply unsettling that he couldn’t get a good read on the captain or anticipate what he knew or didn’t know.
Tony had seen her before at the Club, he thought, Miss Romanoff could be the name. She coolly studied him back and turned to Rogers, dismissing Tony. “My ticket?”
Tony’s thoughts were interrupted by a knock on the door. He was gobsmacked by the sight of Rogers in his dark tailored suit and brilliant blue tie matching his eyes. He hadn’t really looked at the captain before, not enough to really take in how classically handsome the man was. And just Tony’s type.
“Yes. In large lots. I know about that side of the trade. The dealers will sell anything, lie to people about the size of the dinosaurs, anything to make a sale. There’s a lot of money to be made, especially if you don’t care about the animals.” She reached down to pet the baby.
Tony’s unease about the expedition grew beyond his uncomfortable mattress. He bristled at Steve’s formality in all areas. Steve seemed to be caught up in the past. He still called people Mister and Miss and Doctor like they were all attending a formal dinner party in their finest clothes in New Timely.
Going into battle with the Avengers is familiar yet entirely different from fighting with his team. For one thing, his team does not have a demi-god that commands lighting and a Hulk that is pretty much a mean green fighting machine.And while having each other's backs is the same, Tony is not prepared to be caught off-guard that he stops and stares as Cap throws his shield. It bounces around five times, hitting four targets before ricocheting off a corner. Casual as can be, Cap just runs and jumps, catching it on the rebound then throws it again. "What the fu--"
“Not all the time -- I do a lot of odd jobs for the New Explorers’ Club,” Sam explained. Turned out that Sam lived with Rogers too.
They arrived at the same time as other hurrying theatre goers. Rhodey checked their tickets while Tony quickly scanned the crowd. No one he had to greet -- then a large heavy mass landed against his back. “Pardon me, sir,” the low voice said politely.
Steve used a butter knife to slice through the seal on the back of the letter. Nothing inside the envelope. He carefully unfolded the letter, years of booby-trapped communications had trained Steve to be wary.
All that changed when assassins came to kill Steve, the town's upstanding Sheriff and Tony's drinking buddy. Well, more like Tony drank and serenaded the man, while Steve painstakingly dragged his ass home when he was too drunk to do it himself.
Janet Van Dyne lavished love and attention on the Club’s annual dinner. A member of the Board of Trustees since the club’s founding, she had presided over the dinner ever since she suggested the fundraiser. Decked out in exquisitely fashionable jewelry with a dazzling diamante hair comb tucked in her grey hair, she greeted Tony with a kiss for each cheek. “Lovely to be sitting at your table this year,” she said.
. (I decided not to have text in the piece, basing it on the phrase without having a speech bubble or anything like that.)
The dinosaur gave Rogers a dirty look as she was clearly settled in for the night with her towels, radiator and wood chunk. “She can stay if she wants,” Tony said.
Steve grins, holding him close, arms around his waist like he never wants to let go. "I can do that."
Tony had had other plans once in life. He’d been touted as a rising star in all science fields, hailed as his generation’s best technologist. He had buried himself in studies and school and lab work. Until his parents’ sudden and very public death sent him back home to run the family’s extensive company. He hadn’t wanted to be the head of a multi-million dollar company at the age of twenty when he was having far too much fun doing his own thing.
“Good, I have a plan to stop Killian -- he’s the guy running AIM -- and the dinosaur smuggling and the AIM velociraptor army.”
Steve launches into an enthusiastic update about the team and Tony listens in, smiling like the dope he is. He's not even gonna deny how gone he is. And if Steve can't see it, he won't mention it. It's fine. He's lived with it for so long, it's second nature now. As long as he has Steve in his life, everything is right in the world.
“Good point.” Tony sat down on the wooden chair opposite Rogers. “Bruce said he didn’t see anything taken.”
He had the money for a cab to the Club, a fact that still amazed Steve who had grown up poor in a rundown part of the city. The tenement he’d lived in had long been torn down to make room for brownstone buildings, like the one Steve currently lived in. Modern, spacious, full of light and air, decorated according to the current taste with fantastic printed wallpapers, rented furniture and accessories.
With that, he swoops closer to the haulers, targeting joints, then goes straight to the front entrance.
The expedition members on the airship gathered for drinks before dinner in the airship saloon. The well-appointed saloon with its wood paneling, woven rugs, thick curtains and leather chairs could have easily passed for any of the saloons in Tony’s clubs. Except for the brilliant sunset shining off the passing clouds in the saloon windows.
“Until recently, I didn’t know you well. We hadn’t worked together and all I knew was from the papers. Fury was very tight-lipped about the whole business.”
So since I don’t know the story behind the image at all, I ended up deciding ok what if tony made an LMD and its face opens like that and I draw steve reacting to the image. So here that is, heh.
“Wanda expects you to let her go before we leave for New Timely. Do you think that’s a good idea? Since Redwing’s never been in the wild?”
So he concludes that Tony’s not going to be the one to make the first move if he is interested - Tony has never asked out someone he’s friends with, they’ve always been the ones to do so. Best example is Pepper, again, but not the only example. No, when Tony asks people out, they’re always people he barely knows, but he definitely like-liked Pepper before they started dating. Basically, Steve decides, it’s up to him to be the brave one and ask Tony out.
"Be careful, Tony. Don’t go in alone. Call us and we'll be there in five," Steve says in a voice that’s half Sheriff, half friend who knows exactly how Tony is.
"Tony." There’s a warning in Steve's voice, "get away from there and wait for us. ETA five minutes."
"I missed you too, Sheriff," Tony admits. He may not say it out loud, but he's not gonna keep himself from showing affection. If only a little bit. But not too much to weird Steve out.
Steve moves closer to Stark even when he keeps a light hold of Tony's hand. Stark loops a hand behind his Captain's waist. Both of them smiling easily with the knowledge and understanding that comes from a long term commitment to each other. A united front.
“Hmmm,” Rogers said. “I’ll need to send a message to Sam that we’ll be coming back later than expected.”
So he was grateful to the New Explorers’ Club and glad to be asked to lead expeditions to far off places away from New Timely. He didn’t mind the odd requests from Fury or Hill about checking into a shady trade deal here or finding a person there. He’d also found out by accident that his new friend Natasha did the actual spying on the expeditions.
“I am supporting the mission,” she said as she took the list of required specimens from Tony. “Mr. Lang is a highly qualified engineer and knows how to construct the appropriate cases and cages.”
T’Challa pointed out a couple additional landmarks on the map. “That volcano could perhaps hide a lab.”
Tony shakes his head, willing away the envy in his gut at the knowing looks the pair sends each other. "I don't want to disrupt the status quo. Friendship's good enough for me."
“Riiiiiight. Because I’m getting a very weird gut feeling that this expedition isn’t about gathering specimens and running a few experiments or discovering more Savage Land territory.”
"Yes. I am." He confirms and turns to Stark who's casually leaning against the elevator wall, eying them indulgently. "What do you get out of this, Tony?"
Steve took it and stepped into a dance position. “I’m not good at this, I should warn you. I might step on your toes.”
"I am not familiar with the technology but it has not powered down, Sir. It appears to be on standby through some internal power source."
Rogers announced that the expedition would set sail to the Savage Land within the week. The non-scientific members would oversee the loading of the generous supplies donated by the king of Wakanda onto the ship hired by the Club as well as the other preparations for the trip.
He had also decided that Rogers was not entirely dreadful and awful company. But Tony hadn’t reached a spot where he could easily tolerate the man. He was counting on the size of the team and their specific duties to limit their interactions. Otherwise the next six months would drag.
They know the moment the portal opens to the right world because Tony's communicator cackles to life from his helmet and Jarvis connects to his counterpart in the Avenger. Not even a few seconds later, Tony can hear people scrambling and yelling, then Steve's voice comes online, full of urgency, projected from the helmet to the speakers in Reed's lab. "Tony? Is that you?"
“The wait staff have been paid very well to make sure that all glasses and plates are kept full. Come on, we could both use the break.”
Tony follows Stark's lead, keeping up with the armor. Stark's might be flashier and faster, but Tony built his to be sturdy and have the firepower to take down spaceships. It doesn't look like much. He's got parts of him exposed, but full body shielding protects the unarmored parts of him.
"If it's a minor disturbance, the big guys can handle it," Sam volunteers, pointing in Steve's direction. Tony has learned Steve, Hulk and Thor can't get drunk without some high octane stuff like Asgardian mead or a special potion Thor drops into his drink. He doesn't know if he's sad or envious of that.
“I can’t promise anything. But maybe you could pick up a dinosaur pet on your trip? One of my cousin’s kids really wants one and she’s been a good kid.”
“Either it was an ill-advised attempt at theft from someone on board or it’s an attempt to sabotage the expedition.”
"Yes, Mom." He sweeps in closer to one hauler and blasts a shoulder joint, dodging the hauler's other hand by a hair. Klaxons ring in the air. "I'm taking care of the haulers then I'm moving in."
Tony spots one of the haulers below pause in the process of lifting a crate and looks up. He stays still, not wanting to reveal himself before Steve gives him the go ahead. He’s proud to say he is doing his best to be a good operative, mostly because he doesn’t want Steve's lectures on responsibility so early in the morning.
"You wanna grab your gear and meet Reed?" Stark's eyes flicked down his sternum then back, questioning. "The reactor's attached to the suit?"
Rogers was not as impeccably turned out as Tony was. Not that Tony was an expert on clothes or the latest fashion, but he noticed details like the worn spot on Rogers’ lapel and the slight fray on the hem of his pants. “Captain,” he greeted the man.
“Jail -- that’s what his old lady told me last night. Ain’t seen him in since yesterday. I’ve been feeding his last dino. The old lady sold off the rest.”
"I was taking a beauty nap!" Clint complains even as he knocks an honest to god arrow into a recurve bow and trains it on Tony. "Who the hell stole your armor this time, Stark?"
“A bit groggy. I heal quick.” One of the many special things about Steve from the Zeppelin War besides the enhanced strength. “Where are we?”
Steve joins in their fight with MODOK. The rest of the team is still busy with the AIM crew in yellow beekeeper outfits.
So he went. A good boy carrying out his father’s legacy and all that. At the end of it all, a promise of reward -- fame, a place in the world he made for himself, the spotlight speech at the Annual Dinner, respect, trust.
Rogers hesitated. His eyes dropped to the side and then he turned back at his papers, struggling over something. He huffed finally and said, “Yes. Do you want anyone else?” He pushed the roster over to Tony.
edit:... wow, i didn't even notice until just now that steve's ring is on the wrong hand. *facepalms* just pretend it's not lol
As for Tony’s people, Steve wasn’t all that sold on them because he didn’t know them very well even after the air hip travel. Since they left Wakanda, people had been confined to quarters because of the unsettled weather and the need to get their sea legs. As far as Steve could tell, they all were very dedicated science people and likely be trustworthy and not in his way as he investigated.
"We can get that over to Reed for analysis. It could be the key to get you back home." Steve smiles at him. "Not that we don't enjoy having you here, but I'm sure you miss your team."
"That's-- good to know." Everything that came out of Thor's mouth sounds like it belonged in an epic saga.
That’s when Steve noticed the people selling dinosaur eggs and the cages filled with small dinosaurs. He put a hand on her arm. “Miss Maximoff -- this --”
His lizard brain prompted an image of Tony Stark, reminding him how much he enjoyed Stark’s company. When Stark was not angry with him.
“Good point. I don’t know -- Miss Romanoff is a very capable person, though I’m not sure that’s her talents stop at just assisting with expedition logistics.”
“Hmmm, I don’t know exactly. I can’t put my thumb on it. I thought at first that the collecting of specimens felt like a shopping list. Jane did mention that the new museum was in desperate need of new specimens and displays.”
"You see what I have to put up with?" Stark asks even though he's smiling. "Nat, it's your turn to whip up a Margarita."
Pepper tucked a stray lock of red hair behind her ear. “I’m not seeing that on your schedule for tomorrow.”
“I’ve got a new appointment at the university. I’m staying with Thor Odinson -- he couldn’t come tonight, so he gave me his ticket.”
Before he even has a chance to stand, someone with his face and a rather fashionable Van Dyke beard points a familiar bright gauntlet at him. "No sudden movements, pal, or I shoot."
“I’ll see how the rest of the team feels after Clint and Pietro return. Sam said we still have supplies. Nakia’s pushing to stay.”
The next thing Tony sees is the Hulk and Thor rushing towards MODOK. Thor's hammer hits MODOK's gigantic head from above and Hulk smashes the chair.
Tony toyed with a screwdriver on his desk. He’d bought it at a shop in the city two years prior, the day before he’d heard that they had recovered the war hero Captain Rogers from a magic stasis. Just a random fact he remembered each time he picked it up. The screwdriver turned out to be a good tool; the famous hero Rogers a disappointment.
"Whoever thought the yellow outfits was a good idea?" Tony asks as he twists in the air to hit the thing on MODOK's forehead. "Cap, can you disable the floating chair?"
"Steve?" Tony asks cautiously. The man looks like Steve, packed with maybe thirty more pounds of muscle.
“It’s okay, Steve,” Tony said. “I know you promised Wanda to return Redwing home. But have you considered that she’s already made the calculation that four square meals a day, a soft bed and all the toys she can destroy is a better deal than the forest?”
All in all, Steve was probably better off in the void. The world had changed so much in the decades he was gone with unbelievable technology. His contemporaries had moved on, with new families and lives and all the concerns of older people. His old flame, Peggy, had married and retired to a different country. The Howling Commandos scattered to the four winds, old men now, not the young men that Steve had fought beside. Even the famous Howard Stark, whom Steve had met once or twice, had finally settled down, married, had a son, then died when one of his horseless carriages failed during a test drive.
Tony yawned and stretched. “It’s not like we have to stick with the list like we’re on a shopping trip or else. If we find new plants or a particularly interesting specimen, we nab that.”
The scouting party would leave in the afternoon, with the plan of arriving at the other camp as dusk fell. The party was larger than Steve would have liked. But Tony refused to be left behind at home base. So it was Steve, Sam, Natasha, Nakia, Clint and Tony in the group heading out.
“There’s a lot of pricey equipment lying around, the right sort of temptation for a thief like you.”
“Stark Industries has rules about bringing your dino to work and I don’t think pets are generally welcome at galas --”
The next day, Rogers summoned Van Dyne and Lang to his cabin. Tony had been invited along since he was Rogers’ de facto second in command these days. He had thought about it after dinner and he was convinced that Lang had nothing to do with the thefts. But Van Dyne wasn’t up to anything good.
Scott’s tent was the direct opposite. Apparently he was an amateur magician and his text was covered with magic trick paraphernalia. At least he was entertaining after dinner with his sleight of hand tricks. Besides, Scott was helpful with some of the stuff Tony worked on since he also had been an engineer once.
As Tony had already noted, most of the expedition crew had been given quarters on this airship. He had already met Wilson at the Annual Dinner. Bruce introduced him to Thor and the renowned Dr. Foster. Tony nodded good evening to Hope Van Dyne on his way to the bar. As he poured himself a drink, he saw Scott Lang, Van Dyne’s plus one for the expedition, peppering Captain Rogers with questions.
At first, General Phillips and his aide, Peggy Carter, were convinced that they were fighting against a pure scientific effort and the latest technology the world could show off. Steve had enlisted as soon as he could. He’d been found peeling potatoes by one of Phillips’s top scientists, Dr. Erskine, who talked Steve into trying an experimental formula. Steve ended up stronger and faster than he’d ever been.
“Behaving. She hasn’t shredded a single pillow today.” Steve grinned. “And getting far too much attention from people.”
“Oh.” Tony was annoyed with himself. He should have guessed that Rogers was up to something like that.
Stark and Steve hold hands, sling an arm over each other's shoulders, bump each other, and all sorts of other things. The affection is so obvious that even a blind person can see it. In fact, a blind person does see it because he comes up to them, cane extended, and very accurately thrusts one end into the small space in between Steve and Stark's thighs on the bench. "Leave room for Jesus,” he says with a grin.
"I'm fine. I am in an alternate universe. I'll explain everything when I get back." He's barely even aware of how hard he is gripping the console beside the portal. If he weren't already seated, he’d have tumbled to the floor with the way his knees give out.
“What is going on here?” Tony asked sharply. He glanced around the table from impassive Fury to fuming and huffing Pym.
"Thanks." He takes a sip of his coffee, then almost spits it out again when Steve leans down and presses a kiss to Stark's forehead before settling into the chair beside him. He must've been staring too much because Stark grins, in that way that makes him wanna punch himself in the face.
He could see down the neatly laid out row of tents, each with some sort of porch, all the way down to Tony’s tent. Tony was rolling up his shirt sleeves and putting on a leather apron. It turned out that Tony had a wide range of blacksmith skills, which were sorely needed on the expedition. Apparently today, Tony was going to work making repairs on expedition equipment. Thor was especially hard on axes.
“Now imagine that moon, that sky, my country house, and just you and me,” Tony said as he put his arms around Steve’s waist, resting his cheek against Steve’s muscled shoulder.
“This is an odd place to meet,” he said to Rogers. The room was small, set up for quick meetings and whatnot, and not designed for anyone’s comfort.
Tony chuckles at that. Whoever this Reed is, Stark clearly isn't all that fond of him. "The question is, will you be able to get me back? I kinda left the Sheriff in the middle of a fight there. Oh man. He might think i'm dead!"
She peered at the tuft of baby feathers poking out of Steve’s unbuttoned jacket. “I have to. Please call me Wanda. It’s nicer that way.”
Steve sighed. He wanted to talk to Tony about it. Fury had told him that he had talked to Tony about all the aims of the expedition. But Steve needed an ally, even if they were only temporary. And Tony was still holding him at arm’s length which meant he likely did not trust Steve enough to discuss any highly sensitive intelligence.
Rhodey shrugged. “No one I know seems to have an issue with a dino pet. Ill-trained dogs and dinosaurs have the same problems.”
“Dr. Pym,” Tony replied. Tony had inherited Pym’s intense dislike for the senior Stark along with the family title, business and property.
Later, while Natasha and Clint are on recon duty at the warehouse, the rest of them settle in for movie night.
Rhodey threw up a hand. “Just looking out for you, Tones. You seem to have hit a dry spell since you came to New Timely.”
Van Dyne said, “I just want you to know, Captain, that Scott and I are thrilled to be one this expedition. I’ve been inspired by my father’s work and would love to follow in his footsteps.”
“Have Nakia look at the crates and bring Natasha to my cabin this afternoon, when you’re both free.”
"Tony Stark of Earth-12041. The stretchy dude over there is Dr. Reed Richards. We're helping your boy here get back to you so you can have your romantic reunion in the stars."
Steve drops his hands and for a few seconds, they awkwardly stand there in silence, taking each other in. It's Steve who breaks the silence, looking directly at him, expression serious.
Tony took a deep breath. “Then we tell people that Bruce forgot something and opened the crate to retrieve it. People will believe that story until we find out more information.”
Recruiting for the latest New Explorers’ Club expedition to the Savage Land was easy, anticipating working with Rogers was not. Rogers reached out first, asking Tony to meet at the Club to discuss the proposed roster. By the time of the meeting, Tony had worked himself up into expecting Rogers to dictate to him how the roster was going to be filled.
A contingent of Dora Milaje met them at the Embassy, and escorted them through a back door, out into a market and up the backstairs of a restaurant. T’Challa was seated at the table. “Please,” he said, indicating where Tony and Rogers should sit.
The unofficial unofficial ones were to find out if dinosaur smuggling was happening, which was very likely based on Wanda’s information, and to stop all of it if possible.
“I’m here, Tony,” Steve said. A slight sliver of fear hit him as he realized he might not have the privilege of calling Lord Stark ‘Tony’ any longer. “Please take a seat.”
“Lord Stark,” Rogers replied, startled out of his private thoughts. He shoved a wad of notes into his trousers’ pocket. “I wasn’t expecting --”
He caught up to Tony just before they reached the other camp. Tony had rigged a backpack with home-made grenades and canisters created from the few supplies they had brought. Steve was deeply impressed, but knew that now was not the time.
Pepper smoothed her dress before sitting down in her usual chair. “Yes, small dinosaurs have been very popular pets the past few months. You hadn’t noticed?”
"Keep your sex life out of the comms! I can't believe I am now the voice of reason!" Clint despairs. "Someone kill me!"
Sam gave Tony a smile. “I get asked that all the time. I had been discharged from the Air Ship Force for a few months, was back in Timely, and went for a run. I was lapped by Steve. We had a laugh and then he offered me some work with the Club. After the first expedition together, we went in on living arrangements together. Not that sharing a house is easier than having two separate tents.”
Except that’s not what really was going on under the surface at all. The expedition was ambushed by a band of ruthless mercenaries and Tony dragged off to be held for ransom. He’d fought his way to freedom, finding in himself deep reserves he had never suspected. Rhodey had found him and returned him back to a family home Tony could no longer recognize or want to linger in.
"I'll see you in a few. Don't blow up our house." He turns to Tony and winks, making Tony's heart flutter. His Steve never flirts with him. "Don't let him bully you, Tones."
Now, he had favorite spots in Tony’s downtown mansion, like the spot in the conservatory where Redwing loved to laze in the sun. Or the rooms Tony had cleared out for Steve’s office and art studio. Steve hadn’t stayed in one spot long enough to have a favorite chair for years, and now he had one by the fireside, where he’d watch Tony design his machines. And he had his own side of the bed.
"Well, there's certainly less people from other planets," he says ruefully. "The smells are different too. Less saturated with spices and fuel."
“We don’t have to do that. We just made a mistake,” Wanda said, turning visibly pale. “No need to bother the Captain.”
They took a horse cab down to the Customs House near the docks. Steve stepped out of the cab, into the afternoon sunlight. Longshoremen, traders, and all sorts of people milled about the line of warehouses.
He's said his goodbyes to the Avengers earlier. They've figured out a way to communicate through interdimensional video calls, which wow. It still blows his mind.
Wanda smiled. “I’d like some stability.” Pietro was gone by the morning, heading off somewhere, Wanda didn’t know where.
He needed people on his side for this. He could trust Natasha and Clint as long he worked on Fury’s side. Sam was ride or die. The Maximoffs, Hope van Dyne and Scott Lang were in this for their own reasons. Steve was convinced that the only reason Miss van Dyne was on this trip was to scout on her own for the stolen Pym equipment. Dr. Pym had been too cagey to tell Fury about what had been stolen. And Natasha and Nakia acted like long-lost sisters.
a consentacles fill for square Y2, based on the image prompt of tony's arm sticking out of a mass of tentacles and steve having just entered the room:
Turned out that Tony had arrived fashionably late for the departure. Happy unloaded the luggage. “Are you sure about this, boss?” he asked.
"Nothing much. We'll teleconference with Reed later." Stark answers while reaching for a piece of fried chicken. "I want to show Tony around but I'm afraid we look too much alike for taking a stroll. I don't want TMZ telling the world that I've cloned myself again."
Curious about where Steve was going, Redwing bopped along, her feathers and scales rippling with the movement. Steve motioned for her to go into the forest. “Time for you to go free.”
"We watched Men in Black." Stark tells him and Tony nods, understanding. He has a vague recollection of that movie. It might've been based on a true story in their universe. "Anyway, don't worry about it. I'll call Reed. We can visit him soon as he gives the go ahead."
Steve sighed heavily. He should be more upset about finding out a new thing about Fury’s operations every day. But right now, he was more worried about the safety of his expeditions and friends. “We need intel and a plan.”
“There’s a band concert in the City Gardens this weekend. Maybe we could find a couple of dates, get a picnic lunch …” Sam painted a lovely picture of a Saturday afternoon out in the sun.
Tony catches movement in his peripheral vision. The woman with the rocket launcher is on her knees up and aiming for him. He leaps out of the way as he raises his gauntlet to return fire.
The members of the expedition looked at each other, wondering what Steve’s meeting was about. Thor had a hammer with him, as he eyed the camp perimeter, clearly agreeing with Clint that something had to be threatening the camp.
which is a picture prompt.. of a?? robot tony? or something? anyway instead of facial features it has wires and stuff!
"And not updated in the SHIELD database? That sounds suspicious, right? I'mma take a closer look." He circles back, the lightweight armor smoothly following his lead. "J, check records and scan the place."
“Hmm, I think it was just one issue he was the fili-in artist for. He doesn’t talk about his pre-war life, but I gather that he wanted to be a professional artist. I tell him all the time that he has a back-up plan for when the expeditions stop. Can’t be doing this forever, you know.”
For lack of anything to do, Tony showers and changes into Stark's shirt and sweatpants. He wants to be comfortable while waiting for the team is what he tells himself when really, he just wants to be clean and ready when Stark and Steve return.
Alone in his cabin, Tony thought long and hard about reaching out towards the Captain. He’d made attempts before, when Rogers returned to the land of the living. It hadn’t gone well then and he had little hopes now. But he did have to work with Rogers. Maybe checking in before takeoff would not be amiss.
“Who would want a velociraptor in their house? Seriously, Rhodey. Velociraptor. That can’t end well for the people or the velociraptors.”
Wanda interrupted, “I’ve heard about Justin Hammer.” She was shaking. “Back in New Timely -- Pietro and I were searching for who was bringing in the dinosaurs. That’s the name a couple of our sources mentioned.”
Tony settled into his cabin, spacious for others, cramped for him and set up a portable and compact field workshop, considering the trip would take a few days. He couldn’t bear not tinkering on something during the journey, even if he attempted to restrict himself to prepping and improving expedition equipment.
The other thing he’d admit only under threat was that he found Steve to be an excellent artist by accident.
Steve bobs with the movement of the train and casually glances at the illuminated diagram of the stops over the heads of the other passengers. Tony leans into his side. He’s actually holding onto his arm because there’s no pole that he can reach - Tony’s only 3 inches shorter than Steve, but it’s enough to make reaching for the handhold difficult. Either that or Tony wanted to hold onto his arm, Steve thinks. And then he retraces his mental steps, notices something else, and freezes.
Until he met Captain Rogers, whose clear and instant disapproval of Tony had been broadcast the first time they met. Tony had grown up on the legends of Captain Rogers. Meeting the real thing was particularly challenging. Tony knew the real deal when he met him. So many people tried to bluff Tony or hide their true selves. But there was Captain Rogers, as real as it gets, solid confidence, unblemished courage, a true hero for the ages.
The basket was hit by a couple of bullets as they worked. “At this rate, they’ll get the balloon,” Steve said.
“I’m going to take Fury up on his offer for an expedition. We could use that as a cover for investigating. Nat would be good for that.”
In celebration of the expedition’s triumphant return, the senior Miss Van Dyne threw the garden party of the season. “Of the decade,” she said proudly. She smiled at Hank, still inexplicably grumpy about the expedition’s results.
Tony snorts, and rolls back up onto his feet. "We'll see after you get some food. And some sleep." Before that jackass can say anything else that would haunt Tony's dreams for years to come, he turns away, walking towards their rations. "Speaking of, are you more hungry or cold?"
Steve was safe. His Steve was safe.. alive. They would get the stones and the world would be saved, and Tony wouldn't be forgotten, but Steve could live out the rest of his life.
"Good. I will be expecting a full write up of SHIELD's activities that may concern HYDRA or the safety of the world. You will be expected to drop this file off at 10:00 am sharp on March 15th at 1400 I street north west, in Washington DC. Failure to do so will result in immediate expulsion from HYDRA. The chance that you will see anyone is low. Leave the file on the doorstep and go." He rattles off the information, and Steve already has it memorized, but he writes it down just in case.
Steve also convinced him to start attending meetings for soldiers with PTSD who returned from the war. Bucky had met Sam and convinced Steve to bring him on. Sam and Steve had gotten on like a wildfire, after all they shared a common trait; they both loved Bucky; Sam, as it turns out, in quite a different way from Steve. So Sam and Bucky moved in together, and Steve was about 90% sure that he was going to have to rent a tux pretty damn soon.
Instead of telling her like he should, Steve climbs under the covers, patting the spot next to him. She laughs and gets up to turn the lights off before easing into the spot next to him. They don't touch, never do, but they face each other, and maybe that's enough. He wants to reach out to her and pull her into his arms, let her fall asleep and use him as a pillow. He still knew better then to offer. Either she would, or she wouldn't, but she deserved the right to choose without being pushed in either direction. Because Steve loved Nat. He always did.
Sunday comes too fast. Way too fast. He may as well have blinked, and then the cake was constructed and in boxes, sitting in Sam's car. Steve climbs into the front seat, looking at the invitation on the other seat and the borrowed tux on his body. He could just not. He could go home and watch Legally Blonde for the thousandth time.
He takes a step back and nods. "Anything for the mother of my son." He smiles at Steve. "Hey Steve, good to see you up. Nat asleep?"
"I know." Steve rubs his back slowly. He did. Tony was the most stubborn man he knew, with or without all his pretty gadgets. "I love you."
Tony pinches him. "Me dummy." Once he gets a skeptical look, he sighs. "With help from Bucky. I could make a cake if I wanted."
Steve leans forward with one elbow against the counter and he takes his first sip. Well, it was certainly expensive wine. It had been a prize he had won at a wedding party a few years ago for one of the girls he went to college with. She was sweet, and it was kind of her to invite him, so he came halfway across the country to see her, even if they weren't great friends. Apparently she had splurged on the prizes too. (He bet Tony would buy expensive prizes too.) "Then you, Steve Rogers, are the rudest man I've ever met," Tony says, leaning forward too until their lips aren't so far apart anymore.
"Even if it wasn't your fault?" She considers him with an unflinching gaze, and Steve for one wishes he had half the balls she had.
And you're selling yourself short Stark. You've saved countless lives with relief programs and advancements in technology.
Sure, Tony is a genius. That doesn't stop the words from registering late. "I'm sorry, what? You left me for dead in a bunker in Siberia after beating the shit out of me, Rogers. That's not love." It can't be true. It can't be true, because then, that would mean that... they had wasted so much time. Years and years they could've spent not so alone. Tony's crying too, and clinging back to Steve, metal clad fingers digging into Kevlar.
Unfortunately, it's then that Steve looks up at the table to see Sam standing and locked in a heated conversation with Rebecca over the table, his arm in front of Bucky. The rest of the table seemed to be in a similar state of agitated attention, and it was moments before they would gather real attention. "I think I should go diffuse that..." Steve says begrudgingly.
"They called me to come pick Bucky up like I was his mom and he was in elementary," Steve adds with a fond roll of his eyes. They had all come so far since then.
He looks offended in the way that didn't look very offended, but he does shut up, spearing his fork into the spaghetti.
But Nat wasn't coming back for another peanut butter sandwich. He screws the lid back on, and puts it away in the cabinet. "Morning Scott," he says.
Tony walks out into the rain, a cake box tucked delicately under his rain coat. He has his hood up, but even then, the heavy chill of the rain still stings against his cheeks. He had thought it was going so well, so nicely that he hadn't stopped to think about the consequences of his actions.
So Tony resigns himself to sleeping on the couch, loath to disturb the sleeping teen on his chest. He ignores the last few texts from his friends, instead sliding deeper into the couch.
Steve fixes him with an exasperated look. "She's not a communist. The Soviet Union is long gone in the future."
"Oh, and don't forget when your son texted me." The car pulls back out of the spot and Tony picks up the route back to Steve's house easily, his driving much calmer and safer than last time. "I still don't see how he hacked my number off your phone."
"I love you too. I'm gonna.. go. Bye Mr. Rogers." Peter retracts from Tony, his eyes flickering up to Steve. Steve gives him a little wave, and Peter retreats out of the room, closing the door behind him.
Nat looks up at Steve with a glow in her eyes, but before either can say anything, Frigga is there. "Presumably no. If you truly went to the cliffs of Vormir and returned, that means the stone only has a piece of itself in you, the same way you were partially in the stone during your time in the afterlife. Lady Jane had the entirety of the Aether inside of her, which caused the danger." Oh thank god... gods? Steve's thoughts are reflected in Nat's face as she relaxes visibly.
"My my, is the great Tony Stark propositioning me?" Steve says, letting his control melt away as he sets the half finished glass on the counter and uses his how free hand to grip Tony's thigh.
Twenty minutes later, Tony walks out into the common floor, sans Bucky. He opens his arms and collapses right into Steve's chest, making his Mario Kart character swerve off the track. Steve couldn't care less, wrapping his arms tightly around Tony's warm body, clinging to him like a drowning man. Nat swings by and grabs his controller, picking up where he left off.
"You don't seem so bad to me," Steve says honestly, his brain hardly even registering the rest of what Tony had said.
"God, what a world.. universe now." Thor sniffles, rubbing at his nose, the only sound breaking the all consuming of Tony's voice.
Sharon was a nice enough girl. They went out for dinner and a movie, and they even kissed at the end of the night, but there just wasn't really anything there. Once again, Steve goes home feeling just a little too empty for his taste. Which is fine. He wasn't expecting his first date to be the one. He knew this wasn't a rom com.
"If you told me 10 years ago that we were in alone let alone to this extent, I-I-I wouldn't've been surprised but you know."
"You're an asshole." He stands up, clenching both fists. "Don't forget to say goodbye," he spits out over his shoulder. He's gone before Steve can formulate a proper response. Sure, he knew it would be hard on Bucky, but it would be better for him. Better for everyone in the long run. Steve couldn't go on like this, he spent five years trying to pretend he was fine, but he was over the edge now. He wasn't fine, and the only one who could understand was Pepper, but she didn't want to deal with his grief and her own and Morgan's. Nat had gotten him through five years of hell, but she was gone now. Steve couldn't do it. It would be hard, sure, but leaving would be easier, like ripping off a bandaid.
Instead of going home, he walks to Central Park, where there was a refuge of wildlife among the bustling city. He sits on a rock and begins sketching with a pen from his back pocket. Not ideal, but useable. In the distance Steve could see what he now recognized as Stark Tower, where Tony surely was. Where Steve had been only this morning, waking up with limbs tangled in his for the first time in forever. He had felt bliss this morning in the warm light of a soft morning sun. Tony had sprawled out on top of Steve, which had made it difficult for him to leave on time for his shift. Luckily for him, he hadn't needed an alarm to awaken well rested and happy. He had scrawled his number on a ripped out page from his sketchbook and paused to savor the sight of his still sleeping partner in the doorframe before he ran out to meet up with Sam at the bakery.
Tony laughs again, a little happier this time, and really wasn't that the whole point? "I ask myself that every day. Although with those, I'm pretty sure you'd do more damage than me." Tony squeezes his biceps again, not even having to take his wyes off the road.
"No sorry, I've only been back here a few minutes, had to pick up the cake. You can try that door," he points to Sam's dressing room and she steps away towards it.
Thor nods. "I will tell Lady Jane of the good news. You must remain for the revelries, the convergence is nearly upon us."
Steve looks down at him from his new position over Tony (don't ask him when) with a cocky little grin. "Sounds like a plan to me baby." He rolls off of Tony, and walks swiftly into his bathroom, the only evidence that he wasn't really as cool as he was trying to keep it the sound of running water, following splashing into his face. Tony blinks up at the ceiling for a moment, before sitting up, stretching.
The light switches and they walk out into the crosswalk, only two blocks from the tower now. "Tony!" Oh boy. "Tony Stark." Tony stops walking, turning to face the woman.
"Yeah I know," Steve parrots, opening the seal on the envelope. Out slides a creamy white slip of paper with metallic coral trim and golden lettering inscribed with the words Ms. Virginia Potts and Mr. James Rhodes. Maybe Tony was a nickname? Pepper was clearly a nickname for Virginia, so maybe Tony was a nickname too. Or maybe his middle name. That wasn't unheard of. Then it had the date, address, and time. Fine.
Steve hugs him again laughing. "Of course we were. Have you seen you guys?" Steve's texts was full of conversations with both of the men gushing about the other. Their dates, their gifts, their cooking, their eyes. Steve had never seen Bucky happier, even though he still has PTSD and is missing an arm. Sam's the happiest now that Steve's ever seen him too, even though they hadn't known each other nearly as long. "Go back and clean up Sam," Steve says, pulling away from his grinning friend again.
"That's not what I mean, Steve. If this works, which it should, we'll need to find Stephen Strange. He'll probably come back on another planet, but I can't imagine him not returning to the sanctum in New York."  Tony hands him the keys. "I know you can handle yourself, which is why I need you to find him to.. to find Peter."
They did it. They had all the stones. Tony looks around at his team, unfolding hands and cases to reveal the six infinity stones, reunited once more after 5 years.
"Yes, very. You're telling me... my god." He stumbles backward into a chair, running his hand over his face. "2023... shit. And who's she?"
Luckily, they had one connection. Gideon Malik, CEO of Gothite Industries at only 19. Steve only knew the name Malik in passing, he had seen it mentioned only once in the thousands upon thousands of HYDRA files he combed through after the fall of SHIELD. Who's to even say that he was involved with HYDRA yet. But, it was worth a shot. Luckily, Howard was able to procure all invitation to a stuffy banquet being held by one of Howard's connections that the 19 year old would also be attending. So they all went. Howard, Maria, Steve, Nat, and little baby Tony, only 4 months old and already on a secret mission to save the world.. or at least to save his parents. In an odd way, it felt almost like a family outing. Maria is bouncing Tony on her knee, such a sweet image in contrast to what they were here for.
"Let's go get some appetizers, dear." Nat says, squeezing his arm. Her Russian accent is laced on pretty thick, although Steve has perfected a fake one of his own just for the occasion. He follows her closer to the refreshments table and the string quartet playing next to the table. She plucks a quiche off a silver tray, taking a slow bite out of it; her eyes light up. "Mm, this is amazing, you have to try it," she pushes it between his lips with her fingers, using it as an excuse to lean closer. "Your 8 o'clock," she whispers, leaning back with a smile on her face.
She shifts. "He loved you too you know. In a different way, but he did." And that.. that he couldn't mess up. That would be starting now.
Steve blinks. "We had champagne, but that feels inappropriate now." Steve says, rubbing the back of his neck. "Would you like something else?"
He nods, folding his arms over his chest. He doesn't look up at her, but the tears run out eventually. He feels a gentle hand on his shoulder.
That's right. Sam had invited Steve out to go ice skating with them. That meant neither of them could do it, and both of the twins were preoccupied then. He could ask Nat and have Clint pick up her shift here. "Fine. Just so you know, you're an asshole though."
"I'm sure Howard has told you, time travel can be a funny thing." Steve knows he should be looking at her while he speaks, but he can't take his eyes off Tony. He's only 5 pounds and swaddled in a blanket far larger then himself. He's tiny. And yet, Tony was going to grow up to be one of the smartest people on the planet. It's just one of those things that Steve knows. He thinks that even if he didn't, he would be able to tell that Tony was something else entirely.
"Have fun weirdo." He walks back out and nearly runs right into a woman it takes him a moment to recognize. She's wearing a lavender dress though, so he's sure she's in the wedding party. "Oh! Sorry."
"I know you are." She pats his shoulder and sidesteps, continuing her walk towards Morgan and Happy.
Not like Steve was going to offer his assistance. And he was pretty sure that Nat wouldn't either, because she longed to set him up with someone and she would never miss an opportunity like this. It's not that Steve doesn't want to date, it's just that he doesn't really know how to talk to people. Making stunning desserts? Piece of cake (get it?). Starting a conversation with someone he found attractive? May as well be the most difficult task known to man.
"Oh I totally agree. He's practically glowing, which is surprising for someone who was forcibly outed."
"Come back here Sam. You can crash with me if you really can't talk it out." Although that was definitely something that Steve wouldn't like to happen. He was kind of expecting company tonight. But, surely Sam and Bucky could talk this out. They loved each other. That was something Steve knew in his bones.
"I'm good Wanda, thanks. It's not that late though, is it?" He says, wishing he had thought to wear a watch.
Steve picks up his napkin, wiping at his mouth while he feels Tony's confused gaze on him. "Okay, where are you?"
Hey there! I got the idea for this AU at like 2 am on the phone with my girlfriend, so now here we all are with this. I wrote the whole thing in like one sitting because I’m a problem, so as soon as it’s all edited it will be going up. Probably two chapters a week. Some are a little shorter, some a little longer, all are relatively short compared to what I usually do though. Ok, hope you enjoy!
So he forces a press smile onto his face, walking confidently up through the doors and into the large banquet hall. He lets his chest deflate once they are inside, seeing Howard already in conversation with someone or another. Surely someone richer then Steve would ever be.
He dips the tea bag into the steaming water, twirling it with his fingers. Maybe he should read a book. He preferred nonfiction, but he also found himself reading quite a bit of fiction after someone else mentioned it on a mission or at the table.
It was only a few weeks since their arrival, and honestly Steve hadn't been expecting it. He forgot exactly how much time had passed since his arrival in the past, but he hadn't been surprised. He hadn't seen Maria yet, but Howard has been complaining about her moods nearly every time he came downstairs. It was all good natured of course, because he would be back by her bedside as soon as he could be. She was quite beautiful, and Steve didn't think it had that much to do with the pregnancy glow thing.
A tall, put together man appears, presumably the same Jarvis that had been driving the car and the namesake for Tony's first AI. "So these people..." Jarvis trails off, handing Howard a slip of paper.
Tony grunts. "Oh I know. Besides, I'm pretty sure he's got a little crush on me too, so, I don't know what he's going to do."
Steve tries not to let the palpable disappointment show on his face when he regains enough composure to respond. "Yes of course. We can also do cupcakes, if you'd rather, a lot of couples are going with that option nowadays.." he says, all the feverish excitement gone from his voice.
Tony ruffles a hand in his hair, leaving Steve messed up and blushing on the couch as he walks towards the kitchen. His stomach does flips and that's when Steve knows he's probably fucked. "Come on Capri Sun. Let's fire up the microwave." Tony opens up the fridge, pulling out a container of Tupperware. "Hope you want spaghetti. J can you turn the TV back on."
It doesn't take him too long to find Peter actually. He's in the middle of everything, screaming along to some late 2000's song Steve only vaguely recognizes. Victor is standing next to him, stuck between dancing and laughing, a look on his face that Steve wishes he could save forever. It's Victor who notices Steve, waving him over. "Hey Steve!"
Tony makes a little noise of confirmation, clearly not minding that Steve's back was turned even if they were going to have a conversation, "I went to MIT and got four PhDs. Lived in Malibu most of my life though."
A heavy beat of silence hangs between them, a battle of wills if you may. Peter wins when Tony takes the pop tart, collapsing in the nearest barstool with a sigh. "That guy. The one at the bakery I told you about." Peter nods, unwrapping his own pop tart. "Well, things got a little out of hand and... ah. I kissed him."
"Excuse me," Steve says to Wanda, taking his leave to pick his way through the preoccupied crowd towards Tony. He registers the exact moment that Tony sees him, because his skin begins to heat up with the weight of a heavy gaze.
"I'm not so sure that we could ever recreate that exact whirlwind of emotion," Steve says with a fond smile.
"I never apologized." His voice cracks, and the tears break the dam, running down his cheeks openly.
They talk about the weather and how Bruce only recognizes one of the teenagers—a Stark Industries intern. Then Bruce goes to talk to Clint and Steve finds himself face to face with Pepper. She's holding a glass of champagne with a lipstick stain circling it. "Steve."
"It's Sam I—shit, I really fucked up. He.. oh, he asked me to marry him, and I.. well I want to marry him." Steve squints his eyes in confusion. "But um, it was kinda in public and I kinda had a panic attack so I said no and I ran off and now I can't find him anywhere and he's not answering his phone and I don't know what to do. And you know I'm kinda still having a panic attack now because he won't pick up his phone, and I can't really breathe," Bucky rambles quickly, hardly pausing to breathe once.
"Why do I feel like that's an insult." She doesn't respond, but he can almost feel the smug air radiating off of her. "Nat?" He asks in a very different tone of voice after a moment of silence.
"I'm sorry I—I don't know what that was," Steve says, leaning back as not to crowd her. He feels his cheeks turning bright pink with embarrassment. Seriously, what was he thinking.
Luckily, if you could call it that, it seemed that the bone was still in his arm, so... fuck anyways.
Steve feels a subtle hand on his thigh, patting him in a soothing motion. "I'm sure we could... work something out," Nat says, her other hand tucking back a loose strand of hair.
The stage manager came out and lifted a hand for the lights to stay on. “We have a distinguished guest here with us today. A round of applause for the gallant Captain Rogers.”
no cacw drama in comments, please and thank you. i love both steve and tony. steve wronged tony by not telling him about his parents. sometimes people hurt people, even if they really do care about them. and they can apologize and the person who was wronged can accept it or not.
“Nakia confirmed that the crates were specifically from Wakanda -- the customs stamps covered most of them. But if you knew what you were looking for, you could still see them.”
“I don’t think that Fury is going to let someone as talented as you escape,” Natasha said. “He’ll have a job for you.”
The landing party immediately located and secured the campground used by the last expedition. They would need to do a lot more clearing of vegetation and debris to make room. People were antsy to get off the ship.
“AIM is the new HYDRA, Steve,” Natasha explained. “Started up from the ashes of the HYDRA after your war.”
Redwing was eyeing his new boots as a possible food source. Tony took a step backwards. “No, I need to work on the inventory.” He turned heel and left.
Steve's face lights up in a happy smile. "I'm glad. I'm not all that good with expressing how I feel. I didn't want to mess up our friendship so I didn't say anything. But Steve, the other Steve, told me not to wait too long and miss my chance because our lives are crazy--"
"I'm faster. Yes. I know," he finishes, cutting Steve off. He pushes the thrusters harder, forcing them to go faster, intent on surveying the whole area to get it over and done with so that they can leave. They landed the Avenger a few miles away and Steve promptly sent Sam on his flight rig to scope the other side of the outpost. "Fury could've sent you exact coordinates instead of sending us in blind--"
To Tony's absolute surprise, Steve goes in for a hug and even twirls him around with a happy laugh. All he can do is hang on and bask in the once in a lifetime experience of having his reserved Sheriff hug him like a scene from a romcom.
Everyone had moved on. The Great Zeppelin War was in the past, the dashing Captain Rogers a legend that all the school children read about.
He sighs and lets the man go. "Get out of here. The guys up top will be rounding everyone up, best not to provoke them. Don't get shot."
Bruce had been more supportive of the rules, given his quick temper and tendency to fly off the handle. He had told Tony that rules would cut down on misunderstandings and that everyone’s roles and duties in the camp were clearly outlined so no one skipped out on kitchen duties. He also pointed out that Steve had taken on the camp patrols for his side of the expedition, freeing up the scientists to do their own work.
Steve urged his friends to keep up the harassing fire to hold off the velociraptors. He saw Clint up in a large tree aiming his bow and arrows at the guns. Good man, Steve thought. An exhausted Wanda and Pietro stumbled back into camp and were sent into hiding.
Wanda blew a strand of hair out of her eyes. “I’ll have to train her then. Show her how to survive out here. Instead of begging for treats.”
“Maybe, if the dinosaurs were like Captain Rogers’ Redwing,” Bruce said. “But I’m not keen on animal smuggling. I can’t see how dinosaurs make good pets.”
Anyway, Tony was helping Wilson survey the area south to the camp that hadn’t been adequately charted yet. “You can call me Sam,” Mr Wilson, err - Sam said as they set off to work.
Steve rubbed his chin. “Fury asked me about going on an expedition to the Savage Land for the New Explorers’ Club today.”
After returning to his house, Tony ripped off his tie and waistcoat, considering the night a complete wash.
Tony woke up with a sore head and wet feet. Neither of those were the fun kind of sore or wet. He went to scratch the itch in the middle of his back. Suddenly he became keenly aware that his arms were tied behind his back and his legs weighted down by leg irons. He blinked a few times as his sluggish mind sorted out where exactly he was.
“Yeah, but it doesn’t mean I shouldn’t check either -- I’m out in the field looking for particular rocks and minerals as part of my radiation studies. I might find a plant or two -- saves her some effort.”
“An explorer, from what I’ve been told.” Tony drummed his fingers on the table. “Bruce and I can handle any sciencing that comes up. I’m assuming that Pym has given you a list of specimens to collect. Wait -- are any of King T’Challa’s people joining us?”
“Always do. The problem is more complicated -- the fuel to replace gas, then delivery of that fuel. Electricity might do the trick --”
They had smooth sailing for most of the way towards their camp. Steve controlled the air flow to the balloon. Tony stoked the fire and the engine. The steam engine pushed them fast through the air instead of riding the air currents.
“Yes -- intriguing talk by the Captain, by the way. I did not expect the lantern slides and illustrations. Is it true that Captain Rogers drew all those himself? That’s what people were saying at my table.”
“Hmmm.” Pepper had drafted some remarks for him, but Tony had left them back in his office. “I’ve got notes, but I’m a spontaneous man, talking off the cuff is my specialty.”
“The point was to let her go free,” Steve said. His heart clenched at the idea of leaving her behind.
“In a cave. I think that the tide is coming in. You know, icing on the cake after the beating and the being-tied-up business.”
He steered the captain and his dino to his own spacious cabin. “Tea or coffee?” Tony asked as he opened the door.
He left a note for Sam and Natasha about his appointment at the Club on the small table in the hallway in case they came home early from their errands. Natasha was calling on friends in the city and Sam wanted fresh air.
"That is how it is. Also, how have you taken every right turn?" They were only a block away from Steve's apartment now, and he hadn't had to give a single instruction.
"Okay," Tony mutters, clearly enjoying the closeness just as much as Steve. By the time they make it to Tony's house—which is apparently at the top of a massive tower with a stunning view of the city and the ocean—both of them are playing a game of chicken with brief touches and chaste pecks on the cheek. "The is my penthouse. The whole floor is private, and we're the only ones here tonight so." He waggles his eyebrows at Steve likes that's a completion to his sentence.
"I'm hoping if you play this back, it's in celebration." Morgan nestles closer into Peppers chest, staring up at Tony.
Steve walks over to the kitchen, grabbing a glass bottle from a cupboard. "That's Pietro. Wanda's brother." He pours out some water and sets the flower in it, rubbing the petals delicately between his fingers. Pepper was right, Steve did like the flower. It was a sweet gesture, especially knowing that Tony had been nervous about this meeting too—well, nervous enough to ask his friends for help.
"Rebecca." She falls silent, pursing her lips at him. "You need to go take a seat. The wedding is going to start soon." He opens the door for her, restraining himself from shoving her out the door.
Tony makes a thoughtful noise, leaning into Steve's body. "I think.. I think you're probably not a homophobe."
Tony chuckles. "You're on the ac dec team. And we're not dead. I guess you both missed the press conference?"
Maria smiles subtly. "Not even a date? I assumed you and Natasha were going out with the way Howard talked about you two."
"It's ok cap. Come here." He leans in, their breaths mingling as Tony wraps his arm tightly around Steve's waist, pulling him closer, then up to where they're standing, more or less. "You're so good. Ok." At this point, he was just talking, saying anything he thought might get the super soldier to calm down. He didn't need Steve any more wound up than he was already. "We're gonna be fine." He kicks his boots into gear, sending them up into the sky. He retraces his path slowly, clutching to Steve's body as gentle as he can.
He leads them up the stairs and into a long hallway with several rooms off of it. The nearest door on the left side is apparently the one he had deemed fit for them, because he pulls the large doors open, allowing them entrance. Steve looks around the room, his eyes landing on the one bed in the center of the room. Before he can even think to ask for separate rooms, Nat has a hand on his upper arm. "Thank you so much, Mr. Jarvis. Any way we can help out, don't hesitate to ask."
"No no no.. like as a favor. For a friend," Tony amends quickly as if disgusting by the idea of charging Bucky for a prosthetic. "Actually I'm looking into advancing the technology even further if you want to be on the front of a new project."
"Might be shocking to you, but I'm not really good at this." Tony snorts, which is how Steve knows he got his point across. "Flirting has never been my forte. I was bedridden and sickly as a kid."
The bride arrives five minutes later on the dot, and indeed it looks like she's floating on a cloud. That thing had to weigh a thousand pounds in tulle alone. However, the confusing part about how she arrives was that she arrived with a man who was certainly not Tony on her arm. More confusing then that, is when they kiss and the crowd begins to cheer. Steve looks back to where Tony was and sees him clapping too.
"I like you. Steve.. he just sits on the couch and stares at me." Tony rolls his eyes fondly as Bucky chuckles. "Um ok, you can step right up to there. I need you to remove your prosthetic and your top." Bucky follows his instructions, setting his discarded items in a pile on the nearest table before stepping up to the marked area. "Try to be as still as possible, Jarvis will do a full body scan so we can get a feel for the best way to tie the new prosthetic into your current nervous system."
Adam comes up to them, a pencil tucked behind his ear. "That was quite the display Mr. Pozdnyakov. As customary, we will grant one request for you, so long as it is within our power."
"Sounds perfect. Now gimme some wine," Tony says, making grabby hands. Steve smiles as he pours out two glasses, sliding one over to Tony who takes it happily, sipping it as if it was from the cask of amontillado. He looked like a wine critic, like next he was going to demand some water to cleanse his pallet. "It's rude to stare," stays, peeking at him, setting the glass back down on the counter with a clink.
But he was very very busy diverting his attention halfway across the room at his sweet boyfriend, who was definitely flirting with the pretty brunette hanging off his arm.
"One time I forgot that my dad asked me to hand in a proposal by 3, and well.. that motherfuckers gone now, but I haven't forgotten a deadline since." He clearly recalls the memory of his father with a bitterness that is hard to overcome, and they could talk about it another day. Right now, Steve was having him pull into the resident parking.
The man shrugs. "He has been better. Between us, I suspect he is loosing his mind. How come you two haven't been around more."
"Of course," Tony says with a smile. Steve steps over to the door, flipping the keys into his hand and locking the glass door. Maybe this wouldn't be so bad. Maybe he could just.. sell Tony a cake. It would be alright.
A white minivan pulls into the nearest scant spot and Bucky tenses up against Steve's chest. "Go get him. It's just us now, you got nothin to worry about," Steve says, rubbing Bucky's arm, then pushing him halfheartedly towards Sam who was stepping out of the car with an attempt at an unreadable expression on his face.
Four months later, it's not Steve who tracks the missing ex assassin down, It's Tony, who flies to Alaska completely alone while he leaves Steve to chase empty leads down in Europe. Steve would be lying if he said he wasn't pissed off.
"Yeah, dumbass, I love you too! Why cant you just let me sacrifice myself this once!" He tries to push Steve away again, but his grip is to tight.
He nods his head slowly. "Okay." He picks you the space stone carefully, turning it over in his palm. "Aren't you tampering with the time space continuum right now?"
Tony sighs, tugging his jacket off awkwardly and throwing it in the back of the car. It slaps against the expensive leather seat with a wet noise, but he doesn't care. He sighs, setting his head in his hands. Truth told, he had thought it was the right thing to do. How he could've so grossly misunderstood the situation was beyond him, but everyone always told him that he was better with machines than people. Really, they were right. If there was a problem with a machine, you could fix it. That was half of the fun. Fixing people never works, they have to fix themselves, which is hard for Tony to understand and do. He didn't know how to help other people, and he didn't know how to fix himself. His own childhood was filled with closed doors and cold money. His teen years were the product of having no freedom growing up as well as being so far detached from his peers. Emotionally, he was decades behind them, but mentally he was decades ahead. The only common ground he could seem to find was alcohol. If everyone is blackout drunk, it's easier to just talk without fear of rejection. Of course the drinking led to sex and the sex led to scandals in the paper every other week and his current status as a playboy. He wasn't really, when it came down to it. He just craved intimacy in a way that people didn't relate to so instead he would take what he could get, which was a whole lot of one night stands.
"I love you Tony. If this works.. I love you." Then it's Steve racing towards the cliffs edge and Tony left behind crying. Tony starts after him, but stops at the edge, staring down at his falling figure. Whatever Steve was going to try, he had to let it happen.
"It's too late to back out," Nat says when he gets back to the nice ish room HYDRA had assigned them.
Tony smiles slyly, and his eyes dart up and down what is visible of Steve's body from the other side of the kitchen counter. "I wouldn't mind a drink after dinner, if that's all right with you." He pulls his phone out of his pocket, and rolls his eyes, putting it right back away. "I'd like to do dinner now though. I've been in the lab all day." Of course he has. Which is really unfair, because that's incredibly attractive.
"He's ok, baby. He'll be here in a few hours. You can make sure that he stays here overnight." Truly, Steve wasn't 100% sure that Peter was okay, but he was sure that Peter would be okay, and that's what's important. They'll take care of this. "I need to go pick up your birthday present." Steve says, rubbing his arms.
this uncharacteristic possessiveness, strange as that seemed to Tony, who had had people try to  possess him all his life.
"I'll come with you," Tony says, looking up at them too. His hand finds Steve's. "You've gotta tell me what the fuck her deal is sometime though, ok?"
Steve feels his cheeks heat up. "N- no, I love Nat, but she's just a friend. It's just... been a while since I've seen her."
"I know.." Tony cuddles closer into his side. "Does anyone want to watch shitty old movies?" He asks, once the hubbub dies down.
"How are you here?" She says, holding herself with an air of confidence that Steve would bet he could blow over.
If there was ever a doubt in Steve's mind, let it be settled that he would have no trouble falling in love with Tony Stark. None at all. "Do you wanna sit down, Bucky," Tony asks, leading the willing man towards the fountain. Steve lets himself have one moment to watch them walk—his best friend and his.. boyfriend?—nothing but a gentle sort of understanding between them. Then he starts after them, swinging around on Bucky's other side, resting a gentle hand where his prosthetic met his shoulder. "So, I don't think I've seen Sam before, you wanna tell me about him?"
But it could never stay like this. Steve couldn't stay here. There was going to be another Captain America around here soon, and Tony would have a new Uncle Steve. If they were gone in a timely manner, Tony wouldn't even remember him. Tony sticks his fingers in his mouth, staring up at Steve with huge brown eyes. "You're going to be amazing, Tony."
"Hi Pepper," Steve says, looking up at her, immaculately put together despite the situation. Not a hair on her head was out of place, and she didn't look like she had been crying, only that she was so empty.
There is silence, then Steve lets out a laugh. "I'm so glad you're okay. I thought I lost you." He sounds so relieved and on the verge of slightly hysterical laughter. "I'm so glad you're fine. Jarvis… can you? Do you have visual?"
She took a deep breath. “I’m involved with very dangerous people. They’d kill me if they knew I was talking to you.”
The unofficial ones were to aid T’Challa’s quest to locate and repatriate missing vibranium ore and to uncover where Dr. Pym’s special discoveries and instruments had been taken. Like T’Challa, Pym felt certain that his equipment had been stolen and taken to the Savage Land.
Tony swallows, glances at Steve, and thanks the universe that he has lost the ability to blush after years of debauchery in his youth. "No. We're not-- no."
The next round of bullets did hit the balloon. It deflated rapidly as the basket scraped across the treetops. Thor and Bruce ran to meet them as they came to rest in a tree. Tony and Steve climbed down as fast as they could. They all ran back to camp as Steve yelled to Thor about the dinosaurs bearing down on them.
The coffee machine was something else though, a little miracle of gears and steam, a proud gift from its creator, Lord Stark. Steve had been completely unprepared when Stark made a show of revealing his gift at a luncheon at the New Explorers’ Club. He had not been at his best that day, being on edge all day since he woke up. Somehow, Steve thought he had escaped the performing monkey circuit when he fell into the void. But there he was, being shown off like one of the new exhibits at the Club. Then Stark threw the machine at Steve, clearly expecting Steve to be deeply enthralled and enthused.
"It's okay, Steve," Tony reassures him. He's a bad person for feeling happy that Steve's somewhat worried about him. "They're helping me get home."
There are more haulers with turrets on the ground now, bullets raining around him. "I need to get the stealth settings improved in this suit. There must be something really important down there for them to be defending it so hard, Sheriff. Trucks are high tailing it out of there. See if you can get them. I really want whatever it is they have underground."
Steve and Tony didn’t have a name for whatever they were for each other yet. When they came back from the expedition Tony invited Steve to stay with him. And Steve never left.
“Leaving us to drown -- that means that there would be plausible natural reasons for our deaths without the risk of it being traced back to AIM. If anyone found our bodies.”
Steve finds them four hours and one large pitcher of Margarita later. They’re still sober but enjoying the slight buzz from the booze. Stark makes a mean margarita. Delicious but kicks like a mule.
He went over to his trunk, opened it, and tapped on the side to reveal a secret compartment with a sheaf of papers. Back at his desk, Steve unfolded the sheaf and smoothed out the papers.
Tony can already see people coming and going. A truck rumbles out the gate. A couple of people are mounting the haulers, exoskeletons for lifting and hauling, loading boxes onto the other truck. A couple of vans pass by the outgoing truck, kicking up dust on the desert road. The facility is a few miles off the beaten track. With the area known to be without public transport, the employees probably live on site or are transported in by private vehicles.
“No. Somehow it never came up. It never occurred to me to ask how the Secret Spy Network was going when I reviewed the Club’s annual reports.”
T’Challa shrugged. “Oh, I do not know. Perhaps Nakia has heard of such things. It seems to me that keeping a dinosaur, no matter how small, is a dangerous and reckless idea.”
Rogers gave Tony a studied look as he weighed what he was going to say. “We’re returning Redwing back to the Savage Land. That’s where Miss Maximoff thinks she came from.”
In turn, it fascinates Stark that Tony's Steve is baseline human and is not Captain America. Stark's Steve may be human perfection, but Tony wouldn't trade his Sheriff for the world, even if all the muscles are really damned impressive.
Sam came back with a bottle filled with water. He dipped the cleanest rag into the water and offered it to the dinosaur. The dinosaur roused a bit to suck on the rag. Meanwhile Steve worked on the lock, finally jiggering it open.
“AIM needs the Pym collars to control the dinosaurs through electrical shocks. But why the vibranium?”
Jan considered thoughtfully for a minute. “No, we were all different back then -- different places, different times. There was a war and Hank was always in the lab working for the government. I had my own work. All I knew was that Captain Rogers was a hero from the papers and I had just met Hank. I should tell you that story sometime and think of the lovely stories you can tell your grandchildren.”
"Our Tony," he corrects, amused. "Come help me. If we go through the data together, we could get this done faster."
Rogers blinked a couple of times, then looked around the ballroom before turning back to Tony. “I was not expecting to be seated up front.” He took a step to the side.
“Because you’re more valuable. If Pietro got eaten by a pterodactyl, that would not affect the team.”
"With how long you and Steve took to get together, you're in no position to give out advice." Reed replies, directing Stark to a monitor.
She stopped in front of a large gloomy warehouse with a few hard-looking people lingering in front of the solid wooden doors. “Wanda,” one of them said.
It's over in a few minutes with MODOK lying on his back like an overturned tortoise. They round up the rest of the stragglers and call SHIELD for the clean-up.
Steve panicked a bit. He’d done that before with Bucky back before the war. He’d struck out then, he’d strike out now. He didn’t even know anyone he could even ask out. He sort of knew Sharon, the curator of the club museum, but not well enough.
Bruce had found Thor somewhere and become fast friends over the past two years, after the disastrous experiment that had ended Bruce’s first academic career. He wandered the academic wilderness until an appointment by a desperate dean had rescued him.
“I was told that all the offices were already assigned,” Rogers replied. He set down a beaten fabric messenger bag on the table. He wiped off the dust and grabbed a folder from the pile he pulled from his bag.
T’Challa chuckled. “I cannot tell you how much I would like to come along. I too am a scientist and my sister would love to see more of the world. But we have duties.” He pursed his lips. “I would like though to send one of my trusted people along, a person who would not draw any attention. Nakia, who has already done much to uncover the smugglers.”
"Well, now we know they're really doing illegal shit!" Tony reasons as he dodges a volley of bullets. He flies closer, firing repulsor blasts at one of the haulers. "Wow those things are sturdy. J, increase power by ten percent. Let's go for the joints."
Redwing slept at his feet. She’d shown only the barest interest in the forests or the other dinosaurs moving in the foliage beyond the edge of camp. He had to rescue many a tent canvas from her sharp beak as she gleefully threaded her way through crates and packing materials.
“Yeah, I’ve heard that before. It’s not one of those expeditions either where a group of people go into the uncharted forests and come out five years later. We go to the Savage Land, pick up some specimens, head back home. Might even get to see Wakanda too. Who knows?” Tony swirled his wine and smiled. “The question is -- are you in?”
Tony slams a hand on the counter to keep himself from faceplanting with the force of Thor's slap across his back. "Hey, Thor."
Steve found the hot air balloon and Tony as promised bodged together an engine and rudder system for the balloon. “Let’s go rescue our friends,” Tony said as he dropped anchor on the balloon.
“Yeah, let me think.” He rummaged through the spare parts chest in the corner of the cabin and handed the dino a chunk of wood.
"Don't call yourself a cockroach, Tony. It reminds me of that movie. Ugh." Steve serves up three empty mugs and proceeds to fill them with coffee from a large carafe.
Steve sat in the shade, Redwing laying down at his feet. The Van Dyne’s green lawn stretched out before him, dotted with white tents and crowded with the best of the New Explorers’ Club and New Timely society. He felt a touch overdressed in his best day suit and blue cravat.
“Dr. Bruce Banner agreed this morning. Excellent scientist. He wants to bring along his friend, Thor Odinson.”
"He'll have his chance." Steve grins as he drags Stark by the arm. "Come on, I wanna be done by the time food gets here."
Having made his resignation speech and having not been met with a plea to not resign, Tony stood deflated. He gave Steve another suspicious look and then sat down. “That’s rich, you being confused.”
Steve picked his landing team -- Thor, a solid choice because of his strength and lack of fear, Sam, Clint, Natasha and Pietro.
Then Tony and Scott rushed out of their tent with an odd contraption made of wire, a large metal cone and tubes. A lot of tubes. “Radio wave disruptor,” Tony shouted as they ran past.
Redwing snored in her cozy box bed near the stove. She’d put on inches and weight during the two months since he found her. At least they were heading to a place where he’d be able to find food for her. Sam accused him already of spoiling her terribly, but that was because Steve had looked all over New Timely for dino toys and a durable scratching and nibbling post. It wasn’t like Steve hadn’t caught Sam sneaking her treats.
Overall, the expedition worked well as a team. They were steadily emptying the hold of their supplies and equipment. The ship would be returning to the Port City and would be back within a month with more supplies or to pick up the expedition if they were ready to return.
When Jarvis shows the pictures on the TV screen, Tony almost jumps up in his excitement. "That looks like the portal that got me here! I recognize the markings and the shape, though it's missing a few pieces."
But where? Ah, right, he was in a cave. Light flooded through the cave mouth, nearly blinding him. And his feet were wet from the last wavelet splashing into the cave. The AIM soldiers had stripped him down to his shirtsleeves and had ransacked his pockets as far as he could tell.
