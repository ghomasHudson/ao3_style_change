Blood was leaking from where the broken shards of armor dug into his soft skin. The whole thing was bent at an odd angle and when he lifted a finger, bolts of lightning hot pain ran down his entire arm. He couldn’t move the twisted thing, without feeling the air leave his body.
He was just helping by holding Tony’s waist. The tailor was wrapping the tape around him while Steve’s hands were keeping him still. It was all fine.
“Oh god...” Steve whispered, dropping to his knees. Quickly, he slammed on his com and gasped.
So Tony hoped he wouldn’t encounter him tonight. And if he did, he’d not linger and would leave instantly. His curiosity really wasn’t worth the risk.
Even if Steve’s not his alpha and Ty is...he knows what he wants. Steve has been kind from the start and while Ty hasn’t been bad either, there’s always something more when Steve looks at him.
“Mmm. That’s nice. You should...you should definitely do that again.” Tony hummed as Steve pulled away, feeling the moisture on his lips cool. A part of him wondered how Steve felt about leaving his mark on him. Tony certainly didn’t have any qualms.
He grabbed Tony’s wrist and pulled him close. When Tony fell onto him with a soft
Tony felt a chill run down his spine and silently he hoped his heightened hearing was failing him. But he doubted it.
Tony twisted the taps and cupped his hands under the icy water, bringing them up to splash his face in the sink.
Tony did as Steve said and knelt beside him, curious about what he’d possibly found by this triangle when he froze.
The letter is in his mind. Thoughts of the ocean and a kind smile of a man that once knew him. The flags dipped in red.
Steve was safe. A little banged up, sure, but he was okay and that was enough. Tony didn't mind about the rest.
“Well-“
Once Steve would've yelled at him for that. Tony was pretty sure he wouldn't now.
“I’m okay. I think. Nothing the serum won’t solve.” Steve said quietly and then glanced at himself on the bed. He was covered in a thick duvet to keep him warm. That had been Tony’s suggestion since Steve hated the cold.
“What, you want me to strip-?”
It seemed hard to imagine. Like some abstract thought that didn’t slot in with the image he had of Steve now.
“I hope they know what they’re doing.” He breathed and pondered what exactly he’d wear. He had some very nice suits and-
“Good. Then I’m proud of you. You did well for your first day.” Zeke commented tiredly and tossed the book on the bed, reaching up to massaging his temples. “At least something went well.”
“I know Captain. But please, allow us a moment. You can stay of course, but please.”
“Thank you. I don’t know what I would’ve done without you two.” Steve said quietly and gripped the bag tightly in his fist.
“Nice try. But he’s not the real thing Tony.” Steve snickered and to Tony’s immense displeasure, started to laugh again.
“It’s okay.” Tony says and turns away to look out of the window. In his office, he has a good view of the sky. It’s an array of oranges and purples, almost burning when he stares.
He’s sick. And tired. And drained. And fed up. He wants to go home but this is his home.
But that would change. He’d been part of the family for eight years. Whitney was starting to get impatient.
l, they say. And the whole world knows it, but more than that, Dugan and I know it too. And do you wanna know what I turned to Dugan and said?”
“Shut up.” Tony grumbled and clenched his fists, not resisting when Clint began to tug him towards the Shield vehicles that were pulling up.
“Take me with you.” Tony begged, sobbing quietly even as he felt Steve lift him up gently. His vision grayed and his mind spun but before he knew it, he was being taken towards the blue ship.
“Don’t mention him here. He hasn’t even bothered to show up for the truce. He doesn’t give a shit. He doesn’t have a place on the team anymore.”
“You belong to Shield. That’s how it is.”
“So this...invitation.” Tony began, finally feeling comfortable enough to broach the topic. He fidgeted with his cuffs.
“Yeah yeah.” Tony waved him off, inching forward till he was fully seated in the back. Thankfully, Steve didn’t try to move him, and simply came around the side.
Especially when it was the first thing he saw.
Steve, the little shit, looked absolutely delighted. His face was bright with joy and his eyes were full of life. Otherwise, he looked just the same as always; big, blond and strong. But his clothes were different. They looked really bizarre, like a parody of the American flag on a military uniform. Only the center of his chest had a pentagram design. And were those red gloves?
Ty’s eyes narrowed. Then he dipped his head, eyes not shifting from Steve’s steady form.
A smile begins to creep onto his face.
When they arrived he was greeted by Steve this time. Out on the landing strip, he was stood tall in his Commander uniform, with about ten men and women all standing in military rest behind him.
Tony bowed his head in agreement. He knew better than to push. After all-
“I need to find him.” He says urgently and disappears into the crowd. There are too many people and too many distractions. They’re blocking him and it shouldn’t be this hard to find Tony, it has never been this hard-
“Oh, of course.” Tony laughs and runs a hand through his hair, feeling giddy. “Never been better.”
Tony almost cries when Steve pulls away.
. And everything we had between us.” Tony whispered and looked down like a hole would swallow him from the ground. “You scared the hell out of me. I saw you and the others on the anti-reg side face an attack at one of our Stark industries buildings on the news. When I saw you fighting and the building caught fire I just-“
"Authorization. Name, Anthony Edward Stark. A.K.A Ironman. Confirm access?"
“Steve.”
The camera footage showed nothing, and other than a few separate docs attached to the detailed report, there was nothing.
When he stepped inside, he was greeted with the sight of Tony lying on the bed, body loosely curled up in a comfortable position. His eyes were closed but his chest was moving in a slow rhythm. The scent was soft, softer than Steve had ever felt from Tony before.
“I know you don’t care about him. It’s a shame really. He always had such high hopes for you. For both of you.”
“That’s a nice gesture Cap but that’s for your mate’s eyes. You don’t wanna show me first!”
“I never asked for this.”
“Then what’s bitin’ ya?” Gabe insisted and leaned forward, dropping his voice to whisper-level. “Is it the girl?”
Gunshot wound. At least two, maybe even three.
. It was incredible to hear Steve say such things when the most they’d ever spoken was in mission reports and meetings. This really was a first and Tony was almost in awe of how much Steve was on to him.
“Come.” And Tony sat forward and glanced out.
Pulling his gaze away from the endless sky, he turned and glanced around. Someone had left a couple of magazines on some of the tables. Not porn (though Tony would’ve laughed at the poor hiding spot), but just some generic gossip magazine on the latest celebrities and crushes. He was pretty sure he would have at least one mention in it. He always did.
It was a newspaper cutting. It said;
He didn’t want to say it. But he had to.
As they begin to fly, Reed’s words continue to swirl in his mind. It plays back like a tape running constantly.
"I don't know. Doesn't matter though, it's done." He pointed out, and snatched the shirt out of Steve's hand quickly. "Let's just leave it."
“Yes...of course. How about we put this aside for now? We’ll have plenty of time to plan later.”
"I'm gonna pretend you didn't just say that." Steve said stiffly, pushing his sheets aside. "And tell you that you have no choice. It's not an option."
Carol puts a hand on his shoulder before he leaves.
“It’s red, sorry.” Tony purses his lips and looks down when Roger’s face drops in horror. “Okay, another one. What’s my favorite band-“
The suit turns and looks at him. As is the norm these days, it seems completely unaffected by Steve and it’s
“When you offered that invitation, did you really mean it?” Tony asked one night, settling casually on a bench under a dim streetlight. Steve had already been sat there when Tony had begun for the night, and had waited patiently for his companion.
“Jeremy.” Tony smiled and pat his back happily before pulling back and holding him by the shoulders. “It’s so good to see you.”
“Now now.” Robinson held up both hands and tutted, choosing to try with Steve again. “It’s not unfair. I simply want his help with-“
Once the applause died down and President Ford disappeared to some part of the room, people started to get up from their seats. Around the room, chatter was beginning to build up again, and some of the waiters were already bringing the food out on pristine china plates. Tony hoped the food was good since almost everything else about the evening had been shambol-
Tony didn’t say a word. He just looked up and smiled.
Then a thought occurred to him and he looked at Steve from above.
It hadn’t helped. His marks continued to vanish until eventually he was down to ten. And then his parents died.
Tony blinked and glanced at Steve for help. All he got was a bemused look but that was it. So no help there.
“I finally realized something. What I actually want in life. You know it’s crazy, but I think I understand what people mean when they say life isn’t fair.” Tony knew he was rambling. He didn’t care.
His memory was corrupted. Something had happened to him once. Why else had he woken up, alone in a small red bunker shaped like a ship hatch, with food and drinks sealed up in foil tins?
“I think...Peter. Peter James.” He hums softly so as to not disturb the tiny being, and he feels another kiss on his forehead.
“Good to see you. Oh, I sure hope he’s doing well. Maybe he could present again, the next time I get a badge.”
They didn’t like him. Of course, they didn’t like him.
The children were pitiful. Tony could only sigh as one tried to bite the other again.
“Just...bathroom.” He muttered and carried on, shoving through the crowd of peacocks with money so far up their asses, they couldn’t see straight.
Tony wondered if he’d meet his new friend again any time soon. Occasionally he’d catch himself staring at the wall past Zeke, picturing a winning canine smile and glowing eyes. When no one looked, he run from one end of the room to the other, enjoying the rush from his limbs. A smile would spread across his face every time he thought of the lamp-post.
“Nat was just asking Steve about his soul mark.” Bruce helpfully pointed out and Tony had to suppress the urge to glare.
Tony lowered himself until he was just above the robot and let Steve go, dropping him directly on the robots head. Then he swooped low and circled round trying to get a good entry point. He was struggling to find one with those claws waving around.
“...Yeah I know. But I couldn’t help it.”
“Come here Tony.” Ty orders and there’s not room for arguments. “Come here before I make you.”
He felt happy and for once, he felt genuinely wanted.
Nat and Clint were lying on each other on one of the three couches positioned around the huge TV. Bruce and Thor had claimed the couch opposite and Steve was seated in the center couch.
“Make a sound sweetheart. I dare you. But I promise, if anything comes out of that mouth of yours, I’ll drain you faster than you can say fangs.” He whispered into her ear, feeling her shake under his hands.
Steve watched him struggle with the internal battle. But Steve wasn’t going to help him. He couldn’t. Tony had to feel like he could ask anything, as he’d felt before.
Cautiously, he eyes Captain America carefully.
True to his word, Tony found that things did change. For the rest of the week, he spent a lot of time with Steve and occasionally met with the team for meals.
As if controlled by some other power, Tony’s legs began to walk towards the noise, feet leaping seamlessly off the edge and gliding onto the next building.
"I don't love dancing but I don't mind it. My dance teacher used to be pretty strict with me and one of her key lessons was to always be smiling when you did it. It's one of those mandatory things they teach you in these circles, right next to the dinner forks." Tony smiled, watching Steve's eyes dart across his face carefully before narrowing in thought.
Then he got a call from Steve.
"What.
“When you’re better.” Steve nodded, squeezing Tony’s hand gently and stood up. “We’ll talk.”
Tony stopped spinning the ball for a minute. He turned and tilted his chin up at Steve who looked fairly relaxed. “So you’re territorial. Like vampires.”
“Hi...” Tony whispers and smiles softly when Steve blinks back tears and presses his lips to the hand he’s holding. The strong scent of protection and fierce warmth fills the room.
For a moment, Robinson’s offer looked tempting.
it’s good for pregnant omegas to be near their alpha. You don’t want him to suffer from bond-sickness do you?”
“Stop saying that-!”
If only she knew. “I know Pep. There’s no fixing what happened. But maybe...”
“Hey!” A voice made them both jolt and Tony turned instantly to see who’d spoken. And what he saw shocked him and nearly made him collapse with relief.
A warmth bloomed in his chest at the thought.
Slowly he shifted and opened his eyes. Steve was leaning over him, one hand still on his shoulder while the other was holding a tray. It looked like a bowl with something like soup.
A tsum. A baby tsum.
It’s cold. Its always cold but then again, he’s never been one to complain about the little things. It’s just one of those things that comes with the package deal.
The anniversary of the day Steve had stopped Tony from going back to New York. And instead, had told him to stay with him. Little realising it would lead to an almost forever.
. That had been his undoing.
Then he breathed and lay his head back against the bricks, exposing his neck completely.
Steve knew. Which meant Shield knew.
“I’m here. You’re never alone.”
“Of course! Worry not Anthony, next time will be better, I’m sure.”
“And you didn’t contact me you know. I only got a voice mail and that was it. What’d you expect? I’m good but I’m not psychic.”
“I knotted you. You remember that?”
“We have to what now?”
Yanking off the headset, Tony turned to the agents along the center desk and began to call orders. They had to move, fast.
“What’s the problem with soul marks? They’re a huge part of society. Is it such a bad thing that people can actually find something close to love!?”
Well there’s not really much faith to be had. His track record is starting to look pretty grim.
be true.
“Food. For you.” Steve clapped his hands and pushed the smoothie towards Tony, ignoring Tony’s stunned expression to guide it into his hands. “C’mon, chop chop.”
“Sure, fire away.”
Rolling over towards the window, he groaned and yanked his pillow over his head. The banging was loud enough to beat the pattern in his head. It was almost like being in a frat house with a bunch of teenagers, which was rich coming from him since he’d had his fair share of fun.
“Stark.” Steve says, feeling his lips twist into a thin line. “Glad to see you decided to show.”
Breaks slammed in Tony’s mind.
"Okay. Take a deep breath for me." Tony distantly heard him say and just as he did as he was told, he was pulled back into the bed and made to lean against the pillows. He felt hands trace his torso carefully and press just under his neck for a minute.
Surprisingly, Tony didn’t think it was and it didn’t change the facts.
The next time he opened his eyes, Tony felt shakes wrack his body. His head ached with each shiver and his muscles felt sore like he was fighting off a fever.
Eyebrows raised in Zeke’s direction, Norman nodded once and clasped his hands behind his back.
While they were waiting for the police, Steve trotted up to Tony eagerly, sniffing him heavily and circling him, coiling his long furry tail around him.
“I have a letter. Steve wanted you to-“
“Come in Anthony.”
Silence. The room went deadly silent.
“Yes sir.”
Tony couldn’t stop beaming.
Steve dropped the banana on the table and leaned back in his chair.
“Nope. Why don’t you sit down right...
It’s not a question. It’s simply a fact.
Work started from seven, he learned. Every agent was expected to have had breakfast by then with lunch at twelve and dinner by six.
Unimpressed, Steve rolled his eyes and started to grab his gear.
In the morning he comes back with marks on his body and tears on his cheeks. He aches something awful and knows he’s made a colossal mistake. This is something he’ll never do again.
Steve opened his eyes and looked at him.
They were having a stand off. The day after his small breakdown (not panic attack, please no) Steve had approached him early in the morning to see how he was doing. Only it had ended in a screaming match.
“Probably. Is that a problem?”
For instance, after that discussion about mending things, Steve had started to visit Tony every day. Granted it had only been three days since then (and he’d slept for most of it), but he was sure Steve had changed.
Then his face drained and his eyes went wide.
He didn't take them. He hasn't taken them yet.
“Of course! Everyone is blessed! It is our gift!”
Tony knew there was still so much more to come. Steve would no doubt have so much more to discuss. They still had so many issues to resolve and so many things to work out. But at this moment, Tony was sure of one thing.
There was a pause. Then Mr. Robinson scoffed.
He'd said it with such warmth that it almost made Tony feel important.
(See the end of the chapter for
, Steve thought, holding Tony even tighter, and kissing him again when he saw Tony look at him curiously.
Tony blinked and rolled his eyes fondly. “I just told you to choose. C’mon, you want a good steak or something?” Steak for Mr. Muscles, Tony snickered to himself.
“Yes my lord.” The recurrent thought appeared in Tony’s mind and he tried to seize the chance again. “If Whitney can’t leave, maybe I could go out? Perhaps I could forage for the family-“
The plans for a Dyson sphere lay before Steve on the table. Reed’s lab on the Helicarrier is heavily monitored but Steve prefers to come in and find out what’s happening at least once a day.
The familiar taste of iron was there but there was so much more. Those scents, pine, vanilla, sweat, warmth and more-
As promised, with the help of Pepper, Tony managed to arrange a small gathering for Steve within three weeks. He managed to contact Steve’s new friends from Shield, some old members of the Howling Commandos, and even Maria and Fury. It was a nice group and everyone had brought a few close friends. From the glass balcony up top, Tony watched Jane and Thor approach Bruce and Erik Selvig by the bar. He had to admit, it was fun watching them all look so confused at each other, especially when Thor would talk about some Bilgesnipe from Asgard. He could even see Natasha casting them an amused look in the background.
“Oh god, Steve!” Tony grabbed Steve’s shoulder and came around to check the damage when-
He stood to full height over Tony, not once taking his eyes off him.
Things were taking a turn for the worst. He had to do something.
Steve took a sip of his soda and swirled it around. “What about it?” He hummed. He had one arm stretched along the back of the sofa and was leaning back with his legs crossed casually. The picture of cool and controlled. Tony envied that- he was so similar when he was with others but he wished he could be like that around Steve too. Things would be so much easier.
He also isn’t afraid to admit that maybe he needs to calm down a little. If even for the sake of the incursions.
“You don’t need to say anything. Just...believe me. You’re just...incredible.”
“The others are gonna love this.” Tony said, voice muffled by how he was rubbing his cheek against Steve’s neck.
“Could you hear us!?” Steve said, feeling his face go red. It was mortifying, that was private and what he and Tony discussed was-
“Yeah, I know but he-“
“How’d you-“
“W-What?” Tony asked once he stopped, but his shoulders were much more relaxed and somehow talking had become easier.
“I sent nothing.” Steve sounded like he’d just watched someone
, Tony repeats in his head, over and over while Ty smiles warmly and gets the bill. An odd match because he’s Captain America.
For the first time ever, Tony actually wanted to spend more time with Steve and the others. There was something about him that put Tony at ease.
“Mates. Partners? Anyone like that for you?”
“Just be safe, Tony. Take care of yourself first.” She sighed. Tony nodded even though she already seemed resigned.
“Yes.” Pierce nodded, but there was nothing ecstatic about it. “I suppose you’re right.”
"You were the same during the registration act too." Steve said softly, and looked at him with knowing eyes. He looked exhausted and so worn down, but underneath all that, he just looked at Tony with fondness. Like he wasn't surprised. "I think I'm starting to see why."
"Tony, what's wrong?" Steve asked quickly, and began to panic when tears started to leak out of Tony's eyes. "Oh god, did I hurt you? Tell me I didn't-"
“You don’t need to-“
"I'm sorry. I'm
So it wasn’t surprising when one evening, on movie night of all nights did Clint bring up the topic of soul marks.
And to hide that scent of pine. Tony swore he was starting to become addicted to catching a hint of it each week.
For once, Tony didn't mind. He was happy to let Steve give the orders.
His stomach felt warm and damp and he couldn’t feel any pill from his stitches anymore. His hands felt cold. His eyes closed and when he opened them a moment later, he realized he was lying flat on the ground and facing the ceiling.
“How come I’ve never seen you actually turn into a wolf? I know you’re a werewolf but you’re really controlled. I always thought they were more instinctual.” Tony asked, reaching out to snatch the baseball. Steve let him.
Tony instantly shrinks back into the pillows, and sees Steve notice the action with a livid expression.
Stay safe!
“Come Anthony. You need it.” Guiding Tony’s trembling body inside, he set him on the bed and unlocked the collar of his armor. It opened up at the front, down to the collarbones.
“You’re more of a man than any of these pigs. And I tell ya, Nick woulda been heartbroken if we’d lost you that day. Stevie too. And many others.”
A sharp twinge of guilt follows. He stares at it and bites his lip to keep from screaming because all he can think of is how despicable he’s become. Of how wretched and lost he is. Of everything he’s lost.
“Boy, you dare-!” Zeke snarled, raising his hand in the air and Tony instinctively flinched. Thankfully Norman stepped in and grabbed his hand before it connected.
“Steve?”
Tony didn’t have time to think. He just reacted.
Careless. He'd been careless.
“Perhaps.” Norman cleared his throat and lifted his chin. “Anthony. Step forward.”
“Seriously!? Do I have to spell it out? I’m
Tony’s mind filtered through the possibilities. Finally he settled on the most likely one. Leaning forward, he bit his lip and spoke quietly.
“Let’s all have dinner here. It can be my treat. I can have some stuff brought up with just a few clicks and-“
And even if he isn’t...At least he hasn’t broken his heart like Ty once did all those years ago.
“He needs to be assessed. I’ve seen his files before since I treated him for post battle injuries and this isn’t good. The last time this happened, he...”
Slowly, he let his feet carry him back. A cool numbness set over him once more.
“Whatever. Maybe we shouldn’t talk. Actually-“ Tony nodded and leaned his head back to look at the ceiling. “Lets do that.”
“I don’t know.” Steve swallowed, suddenly seeming just as shaken. But still, he pulled Tony close against him and sighed.
And just like that they scurried away, like mice set free from a death-trap, leaving Tony to stare at Steve in awe.
“Father please! We forced him to, please don’t punish him!” Zachariah finally cried, clearly unable to stand back as the scene played out. Tony almost wanted to snarl at him. Didn’t the boy already know it was too late?
Finally they head home and Steve continues to take care of him. It’s the best feeling.
Gasping, Tony stared down at his body, carefully concealed under a mountain of khaki pants and plain shirts, and at least three blankets. Carefully, with shaky hands, he lifted up the duvet and observed his body.
“Is it okay if I keep my hand here?” Steve asked and squeezed Tony’s hand gently. His hand was so warm, almost clammy, but Tony didn’t mind. In fact, he kind of liked it.
“Full moon soon...” He murmured under his breath. Then he looked back and Tony and smiled with no happiness. His eyes were dull with resignation.
With a shaky breath Tony looked away and clasped his wrists brushing his thumbs gently over his skin. He didn't remove Steve's hands though which gave him immense hope.
Steve let out a raw sound and pulled Tony’s head gently into his arms, feeling his body begin to shake. In his lap, Tony’s head lolled and rested, almost at peace with whatever it was that had happened.
“Please.”
“Yeah. I think about you. Sometimes.”
“Thirteen. If you wanna be technical. But most people call me Sharon.”
So the question was whether he took it or not. If he did, his company would be okay, that much he knew. But living on the Helicarrier...
“Are you gonna stay?” Steve hoped he would. More time with him was better. Even if he knew he needed to stop pining so much.
"You think you're so high and mighty!? How can you think that when everyone here knows you're a traitor!? Or better yet, a whore since you're fucking Captain America-"
“So what have you decided?” The doctor says calmly, focusing the question towards Tony.
He needed to work with these people and get more comfortable being around them but that would never happen if what happened yesterday kept happening. He had to find some common ground or he’d never get anything done.
“Hey.” Tony greeted them warmly as he approached, choosing to carefully ignore their eyes turning towards him with distaste. “Mind if I join you?”
“Nothing's wrong. Here. Take it.”
”I’m already giving you plenty. I’m already tolerating that mutt for you. Don’t ask for more.” Ty says coldly and then, quick as it appeared, the harsh demeanour vanishes and a warm smile replaces it.
“Did you just-“
False-Steve doesn't stop crying. But he does freeze at the words.
"I hope you're all happy. With any luck, you won't see me again." He said, and ignoring the way their mouths hung open, he turned around and went back to his packing.
Tony touched his mark briefly, wondering just how much he had yet to learn. Still, he had time now. “I’m guessing Steve wasn’t expecting a mate this soon. I must’ve come out of nowhere.”
me” And suddenly Reed gives him a sick smile, like he’s gone mad. “Would you murder me Captain? Would you kill me as well?”
"You've lost weight. And you look exhausted, when was the last time you slept?"
They didn’t need air. As Steve watched Thor and Carol begin to fly around the quinjet, he felt his fingers begin to itch with the desire to do something. It was horrible in every sense, to be standing here and just watching.
how incredible you are?”
Finally Tony did laugh. “It’s not like that.”
Briefly he wondered if Steve ever thought about it.
Tony’s eyes widened fractionally. He’d never told Steve any of that.
Zeke’s eyes blazed. “Did something happened?”
“We’ll find out. Any news?”
Tony’s eyes are open but lifeless. His hair is covered in dried blood, almost as if someone had smashed his head in. His face is ice-white, but there’s dried blood that draws a clear line down his face from the head injury. It’s almost like someone took a paintbrush and painted a thick stripe down his cheek.
“My lord? I’ve returned.”
Natasha knew.
Some time passed before Tony finally shifted. That seemed to pull Steve out of his trance too and slowly they both lifted their heads to face each other. Tony looked at the puffy, red rimmed eyes of his husband and watched as he swallowed and inspected Tony.
Well, he’d find out soon either way.
Why on earth had he lied so blatantly? He’d never done that and this threat could very well put the pack in grave danger. Yet there he’d stood, lying through his fangs.
"I don't know." Tony said and his breath hitched when Steve accidentally tugged at his hair. "But I was very sick when I woke up."
Tony's mouth felt dry. He opened and closed it a few times, unsure of what to say.
No point giving a bottle to Steve. He wouldn’t know what to do with it.
“I said-“ Steve snarls and leans forward slightly, keeping the baby close. “Get.
He’d never have a place by Steve’s side. He’d never be that comfortable with him. It wasn’t his place to ask for that. Hell, he couldn’t even read Steve properly half the time.
Tony swallowed around the lump in his throat. “He’s interested in someone else I think.”
“That’s enough of that. I told you to do your job so do it.”
Tyler tutted and shook his head. “It’s not to say that you won’t be given anything to fabricate. It’s just that we currently have the best minds working on these designs and you have talents that can be put elsewhere.”
Zeke laughed and ruffled his hair gently. “Oh I’m sure you will pet. I’m sure you will.”
Tony’s heart began to calm as soon as Zeke took his hand away and spun to face his advisors. His palms itched and burned when he clenched his fists tightly. Slowly he pushed himself up and stood tall.
Still, it was enough for him to move.
“I miss you.” Tony said softly instead and looked away. “It’s nice to see you again.”
The world was watching. The heat of Steve’s hand on his cheek was searing, even more so that the weight on his chest. If there was ever such a thing as claiming...Steve had just done it.
To his delight, Pepper opened the door and he was immensely grateful to see his only friend come to say goodbye. Rhodey wasn’t around but he’d left a message for him telling him what was going on. He didn’t expect Rhodey but was so thankful for Pepper.
”In the event of an attack or threat to the operating base, you may be instructed by higher authorization to engage in combat with use of fire-arms.” Tony read out loud and looked up. “I know what that means Steve. You can’t expect me to agree.”
“Well it was fine I guess.” No need to bring Ben up. Not when this was the first time in months Steve had made small talk with him. “How was your day?”
Steve’s brow furrowed and his fingers hesitated. Then he clicked on the link and read.
“Thank you lad. Come and have a seat.” Dugan nodded and pointed at the seat next to Steve.
“Make me an Avenger Steve. I want in.” Tony said, stepping forward and wrapping his arms around the werewolf’s furry neck. He pressed his nose into the warmth and breathed in the scent of pine.
“I just want you to know, you made me so happy. Even for a little while.” Tony whispered softly, feeling his eyes water and something wet trail down his cheek. He let them fall, not wanting to waste even a second, basking in Steve’s glow.
Reed is watching silently beside T’Challa in the corner. T’Challa’s mask hides everything but Reed’s eyes are blank.
Tony thought to himself as he twisted the arm of his latest victim and sunk his teeth in. If the human had been any faster, he may well have dented one of the shins.
“No. No one can.” Tony agrees and stand up shakily. “But we need someone. And it can’t be me.”
Tony knew he was trying to land a hit, but for some reason, that one didn’t land.
“Do you want me to stay?” Maria asked and Steve paused his writing but didn’t look up.
“Sir?” The agent prodding him (
It was just pressing 11pm. He was kind of wishing he hadn’t skipped breakfast considering he hadn’t eaten dinner last night either. He hoped Clint would appreciate the new arrows he’d made instead of feasting on lasagna.
The Avengers place cuffs on each of the Illuminati members present. They take them in and leave for the Helicarrier, already logging thumb prints and reports.
Tony was the same. In his anguish, he was beautiful. But his eyes were filled with tears and full of pain and fear. He was so scared and yet so desperate, it was no wonder he’d been afraid.
that. I promised you didn’t I?”
“I just…” It was hard to admit it but it was the truth. He owed it to Steve to be honest.
He used to invent with these hands. He once carried the weight of the world with these hands. Once stood with giants-heroes beyond belief.
He cleared his throat and met Stark’s stare. “Your turn.”
It’s one of the many things Tony loves about him.
"Tony, there you are! And with our pup too, I see! Let me have a look at our-“
“Yes sir.” The whisper of a man said and pointed towards the enclosure with a shakey hand. “Even now, it’s...”
Ben stopped him just before he reached.
Nerves starting to rise, Tony made his way to Zeke’s room. Taking a deep breath, he knocked.
Feeling his cheeks burn, Tony ducked his head in shame.
Steve clinked his drink against hers. His smile was fond.
“I don’t remember any of it.” Tony says and shuts his eyes to fight off the tears of frustration. “I’m pregnant and...”
“We’ve been called out.” Steve said calmly and folded his arms like an absolute killjoy. “We need to go.”
“Have they killed any vampires?” Tony asked, still trying to hide how shocked he was to see Zeke this stressed. You’d think someone had died in the faction.
Now...it wasn’t like that anymore. Tony didn’t dream of that anymore. It wasn’t for him to hope.
“I can’t have an alpha!” Tony exclaims and throws his hands up like that might help. “I’ve never been with an alpha before.”
“Cap? Hey now.” Stark laughed nervously but Steve didn’t let go. If anything, he just pulled Stark closer. That scent...
The gunfire grew louder. The room was full of sounds-it was so
He knows he shouldn’t be here. Steve should be. He should be alive and standing right here, telling the world that Iron man was a hero, or maybe that he tried to be.
Fear begins to build up in Steve’s mind. In all these months, he’s never heard Reed talk like this.
His mind swirled with thoughts, and it wasn’t until the doors slip open to the training area, that he stopped.
All of a sudden, webs began to fill the air, a curtain descending over the scene as two arachnids in strange uniforms appeared, biting down hard on some of the vampires. Tony watched Norman shriek with rage when Peter clamped down his massive mandible over his shoulder.
Suddenly Gabe leaned forward too and squinted. “He’s Howard’s boy. Look at that jaw.”
“Why are you sorry Tony? Are you sorry for leaving us and disappearing to go off on your own? Are you sorry for putting your life at risk all for the sake of a drink? Are you sorry for putting us,
So Steve...didn’t dislike him. He wasn’t interested in Sharon, that was for sure. Since the speech, Tony had barely seen her face. She’d kept it downturned and Tony hadn’t seen much of her past the table decor in the centre.
“You didn’t need to worry.” Tony reminded him quietly, holding still while Steve’s fingers tightened on him. The heat from Steve’s body was like a safety net Tony hadn’t known he’d needed. The familiarity of the smell and feel of Steve made his throat feel stiff.
Maybe Tony should’ve been scared. Maybe he should’ve screamed or yelled or cried with despair. Maybe he should have gotten up, hit Steve for taking that choice away and ruining his life. Steve certainly looked like he expected it. Instead-
Whitney pulled back sharply.
He’s losing himself. Surely this is beyond his limits.
Tony shudders and tries to open his eyes. It’s his heart, he’s-
“Don’t. Don’t do that.”
His foot hit something. His foot
“You can’t mean it. You don’t need to pretend.” Tony shook his head desperately. “Please don’t pretend.”
But Steve was shaking his head and something warmed in Tony’s chest at the sight. People didn’t usually say anything to him. He didn’t need it but it was nice of Steve to apologize even if there wasn’t anything to apologize for.
“I’m sure you can imagine. A guy like me-“ Tony flashed Steve a winning smile, letting his lids fall low. “-has certain needs. Not everyone can match.”
There was brief lull after that. The psychologist quickly left after that with a promise to come back each day and Tony was left wondering just what he’d do now, the moment he faced Steve.
For a moment, Steve said nothing. He simply sat there and listened, not even appearing to breathe under the onslaught. But finally, he lifted his head up and faced Tony with red-rimmed eyes.
With a cool expression, Steve folded his arms and mirrored Tony’s position. For a second he just stared at Tony silently. Then his lips grew into an almost gleeful smile.
Huge arms wrapped around him gently and tugged him close. Steve pulled him against his torso and rested his fingers in his hair, creating this small space of warmth and safety that Tony never wanted to leave.
“Oh thank god.” Steve said warmly. “I was worried you couldn’t speak.”
Tony thought, pulling up his wrist to check the time. Seven twenty. Jeremy would be here soon. He wasn’t usually late.
“I know.” He says and Tony freezes, feeling his heart begin to race. “I love you too.”
”But you owe Shield! You owe everyone your goddamn life!” Ben spat out and leaned over the desk like a man about to pounce. “You get in that damn suit, or you admit fault when everyone gets killed up there because of you. Including your precious Captain.”
“Anthony.” Zeke recoiled, though he narrowed his eyes dangerously and snarled. They began to circle each other.
“Oh please. You really think it’s a good idea? They won’t treat you well Tony.”
In response to Tony's stunned silence, Steve buried his face in the back of Tony's neck and pulled him closer, seeming to enjoy the warmth.
“Tony, it’s nothing to be ashamed of-“ Rogers says quietly but when Tony glares at him, he starts to smile and that-
“Sure, whatever you say. I could use the distraction. Although-” Stark tilted his head at him and frowned. "You don't have to help me. I'll be alright."
"I..." Tony swallows and looks at the floor in a daze. It can't be real but there's so much not adding up and-
“No. I said I wanted you. And I had you. It was a good night and I’ve gotten what I wanted. I’m a vampire Steve. And vampires need more than just a werewolf.”
It had been weeks since the broadcast. Nothing was the same. Natasha and Clint had broken more items that anyone could count. Sam had broken knuckles over and over, causing bruises that would eventually heal, unlike the deep-seated damage everyone had been dealt. Wanda had avoided team meetings as much as possible and Bucky had started leaving the tower more often. He felt the worst, probably because he had been starting to talk to Tony more.
The room was large and modern, but still similar to the rest of the Helicarrier in that there was a metallic theme to the floors and ceiling and pipes ran along the edges.
“No.” Steve shook his head firmly, knowing full well that Tony could feel his gaze. “Not good enough.”
“Oh? No trouble at all?” Zeke asked, giving Tony a quick glance over.
“No. I guess I haven’t. But hell, I thought-“ Steve sighed and blew out a breath, suddenly lowering his volume. “I thought you and I had something special going on.”
“But he never gives us more! You always promise and he never gives us anything!” Zachariah begged and begged and as always, Tony said what he always did.
“I have feelings for you. That’s why I want to know. I want to know if you feel the same for me. I want to prove that I can be trusted with your identity.”
Stretching his arms out, he stepped in front of Tony in a twisted parody of their positions a few days earlier and tilted his head back.
He sunk down into the mess of his own making and let the flood gates open.
His head lolls to the side. Hands grip his wrist tight as his eyes fall shut and voices get louder and more frantic.
Thankfully Iron man had gotten back up, albeit shakily, but in the end, he’d seemed fine and had insisted on taking Steve back to the mansion as usual.
“Who brought him? Did Rogers
Who said Iron man had to reveal his identity? It wouldn’t make Steve love him any less.
“Can I get you a drink?”
Steve shifts in his seat. Something about the way Reed says it, feels chilling to the bone.
Tony flushes red with humiliation. How can Ty of all people say that when he’d been the obsessed asshole all those years ago?
“Captain?” Reed asks, looking back and forth between them.
Beast and Blackbolt had also surrendered a month ago and hence they had been invited to this meeting after also having their rights stripped. Right now, they are the ones holding Strange by the arms and expending energy in just trying to stop him from moving.
“Bah.” Gabe rolled his eyes and let him go, reaching for one of the ridiculously decorated gold napkins on the table.
pain in his body as the armor wavered from the hit. The pain started to build up until it was red-hot and washed over him in spades until he could barely breathe.
“You? An Avenger? Oh, you mean consultant! Unless you’ve been promoted.”
It wouldn’t be the same, he knew. But it would be something. He could do this.
Tony made an indistinct noise. “I suppose. It’s a bit odd.” His eyes slid over to Steve. “Are you getting a new suit fitted?”
.” Tony said with air quotes, and Steve shook his head fondly.
"I'm part of the team and we train here but you already know that. Don't change the subject." She said firmly but dropped her volume, looking desperate. "He misses you, you know. Have you talked to him about the SHRA? Have you both sat down and actually-"
He approached them from behind them and clapped Tony’s shoulder lightly before coming around to join them. In his hand was the same glass he’d carried earlier, only it was completely full.
While he’s in the bathroom, he pauses to look at himself in the mirror. Casting a look behind him, he breathes out and lifts up the huge blue shirt.
“Tony! Are you alright!?” Clint yelled out as he ran towards him at the speed of sound.
“I said leave it.” Steve repeated coldly and Tony snapped his mouth shut, feeling his throat close up a bit.
When he next blinked open his eyes, he was greeted with the familiar white lights of the medbay and against his will his lips curved into a small smile.
And fainter...
"Focus!" Tony said sharply, knowing his voice was coming out colder through the helmet. Still, it worked and the agent tightened his grip and stood tall. "Where's the commander? Where are the Avengers?"
Reed hums and begins to pace a little. “The king is the most important piece. It’s a simple rule, do not let the king fall or you lose. It doesn’t matter how many pieces there are on the board left, if the king dies, there is nothing left. I used to play with Tony.”
Not wanting to look a gift horse in the mouth, he reached out with shaky fingers and grabbed the bowl. Then slowly he began to eat.
"I know. That needs to change."
Tony shuffled around on the bed and looked at Steve’s calm face. Asleep like this, Tony could admire every part of him.
Continuing to drain the man, Tony held him down until the man’s cries died out. When he started to slump, Tony pulled back.
Who was this Captain? That wasn’t the first time Tony had heard his name in the family. Was he a threat? Was that why Zeke pulled back instead of attacking? It wasn’t like Whitney to get caught and it certainly wasn’t like Zeke to restrict her movement. It showed a caution that Zeke wasn’t known for.
Unfortunately, they reached the research quarters quickly after that, and Tony was greeted by the familiar sight of the cold steel door that no doubt held the people who despised him.
They’d reached the asteroid belt surrounding a dark grey planet. Space rubble and metal seemed to move around the void in a slow circle, obviously caught in the gravitational pull of the planet. The planet itself seemed fairly small, like their moon back near earth, only smaller. And it seemed to have a strange mist about it, coating the surface in a pale hue.
Sometimes he catches himself in a glass window and finds himself staring. A man with a complexion like ice stares back, the only signs of life the flushed red on his cheeks under his overgrown beard.
Livid, Tony stormed past him, shoving through the door with a soft grunt. He heard Ben's swears and the chatter rising up behind him but he didn't turn back.
Norman Osborn was one of the few vampires who could actually dispute Zeke. He had the greatest self control out of all the family members and could easily hold his own in a fight. Said to have been married and with a son many years ago, Tony had once overheard Whitney spill that his wife and child left him when he voluntarily chose to become a vampire. Tony couldn’t even imagine it. Norman was many things, but a fanatic? Surely not.
Just as he was about to leave to go somewhere else, he spotted Ben, Trish and Sam sitting on a table and chatting, along with two other women in the group.
“Me too.”
“Oh well, lots of scenting, lots of skin contact-oh, loads of territorial marking, hence you need to stay here-and obviously to heal of course!” Peter reassured quickly, holding his hands up. “He’ll keep you safe, don’t worry.”
“A drink would be great actually.” He smiled grimly and Pierce nodded approvingly.
A jagged feeling of raw pain unleashed itself in Tony’s heart. Tears of frustration built in his eyes and suddenly he was standing over Steve with clenched fists and a seething gaze.
“Oh Anthony, my poor boy. It’s alright, why would you be ashamed? It’s alright that you’re not as skilled as some of us. I admit, it is harder to balance on new ground.”
Steve lies to himself. It’s a constant thing he does these days to try and forget the pain he carries. The ache of betrayal feels etched on his skin and seems impossible to shake off sometimes.
There’s a single streetlight on the opposite side of the curb. It’s by a bus stop on the other side and there, Tony fixes his gaze, wondering briefly what time it is.
“It’s still pretty sensitive. Maybe that’s a vampire thing but it should wear off soon.” Steve remarked absently, still stroking over the mark and really, Tony was tired of being the last to know things.
He tries to answer but all that comes out is more sobs. To his horror tears start falling out of his eyes and his body continues to shake even when he drops the shirt and clamps his hands over his eyes to stop the tears.
“YOU ARE NOT PREGNANT!
“Of course. We take care of our own.” He said and slipped a warm hand around his shoulders and walked them away. Tony was sure he could still feel Fury’s eyes on his neck but he didn’t turn back.
Tony watched it fall while his vision swam. The world kept blurring and he was starting to see double.
“I do. Kind of, anyway.” Tony frowned.
His photo stares back at him. Or rather, the face of a man who once helped people-was someone to be
“You should take it. You never know what could happen.” She put her hands on her hips and looked at him but Tony waved her concern away. It wasn’t needed.
“Soul marks are just another thing to worry about. It’s not like they’re all that matters-“
“Tony..do you want this?” Steve asked quietly. From the corner of his eye, he could see Steve swallowing. “Is this something you want?”
There’s a pause. Reed almost looks shocked. Then an ugly frown mars his face and he steps forward with his fists clenched.
So Tony started spending the next few days in Steve’s bedroom. Or his old one, as Steve pointed out. Director, Commander, it was all the same.
He frowned at Tony and smiled tightly. “Anthony? What did you say?”
“Careful pup. You wouldn’t want me to reveal just how deadly I really am, would you? I may be new but I’m no different from the rest. Don’t make that mistake.” Tony explained, holding a finger up calmly, but instantly he pulled it away. His hands were shaking again.
“Tony, please.” He croaked, reaching up to slip his hands under the helmet. Feeling his throat tighten, he began to press and lift the helmet up.
“Yeah. No problem.” Tony said quietly, feeling something twist in his stomach. Steve didn’t want him looking at him like that. People often didn’t like him looking their way anymore, especially after he shut down the weapons after Afghanistan. And stopped offering to sleep with anyone.
“But ball pit Steve. An actual ball pit. What’s it gonna do? Come to life? Eat some kids?”
"I'm so glad you're okay Tony." She said quietly and glanced at Steve who was sat by him on the bench. "And you too, Steve."
“Tony. Are you okay?”
“Look Petey, your papa made a room for you.”
When he flicked back, Steve was staring at him like he was finally seeing him for the first time. Like things were starting to click into place.
“Fine.” He agreed reluctantly, trying not to feel too pleased when Steve’s whole face lit up and the tension fell from his shoulders. “You tell me where I’m going.”
Steve’s thoughts had progressively spiraled after seeing Tony the first time. He’d lost so many nights since. How could he
Suddenly, it felt like the temperature in the room had dropped. Her eyes darkened ever so slightly and she let her collar go. “You think I don’t see through you? Don’t play coy with me Anthony. I will have you and you know it. Your time is nearly up.”
Slowly, he opens his eyes and takes a deep breath. The world comes into focus like a bad television screen, all fuzzy and hard to make out. But after a few blinks he clears his view and can make out the sky.
Tony choked out a wet laugh at that and shook his head. "You honestly don't know? I don't want to lose you. I can't."
“Hey!”
Every time Tony glanced at him, Steve would smile. And somehow, he’d be doing the same.
knows it. I mean we all know Captain America's death was your-hey, where are you going?!"
“Oh lay off Norman, as soon as Ty get back I’ll-“ Whitney halted completely in her step and let out a high pitched scream of horror, clapping her hands over her mask.
The joke was on him. He’d gotten too comfy. Far too close. Now Steve was convinced that his one soul mark had to belong to him. If he hadn’t gotten so close to Steve, none of this would’ve happened.
Tony’s heart started to speed up when he heard Steve suck in a breath. Steve was gearing up for a fight and Tony was starting to get the feeling that something was going to happen.
It was apparently the main command deck that Tony had only really seen once or twice before, though he was told he’d spent plenty of time in it when he was director. He’d seen some of the agents eyeing him curiously as he’d walked in, and he’s overheard someone mention something about
"I didn't realize team-mates were allowed to go through each others things." Tony said warmly and felt the glass screech in his hand. "How about I go raid through your stuff? Or better yet, those blue prints you pretend to do."
"I'm sorry too." Steve choked out too, and without another word, stepped close and gathered Tony into a careful hug. For a moment, they just held each other, feeling the release of what was months of pent up emotions and words left unsaid. They'd fought against each other and torn each other apart, but somehow all of that seemed to fade when they were close like this. There was a piece of themselves they'd been missing and it had finally come together.
"That's the hard part. Most people don't see things your way."
After a pause, he heard Ben stutter and looked up. The man was red-in-the face.
“Steve, calm down, you’re too wound up.” Thankfully Maria intervened and Tony could take a deep breath. She’d stepped forward in front of him, and was seemingly staring at Steve. Tony couldn’t see her expression, but it was enough to make Steve frown. He paused and didn’t come any closer.
“Not a thing.” She replied smoothly, but still didn’t face him. A small part of him wondered if they’d actually take him seriously if he filed a complaint. He was pretty sure Pepper had never acted this way with anyone during her time as his personal assistant. He’d definitely find out after this.
“Oh sure. He was only molested by that-“
“So let’s make a new draft. Would you consider working here full time?”
He doesn't. But he does take the book to his room. Maybe he'll find the courage to read it.
"Wanna go for a walk? I can tell you're already itching for some tech."
Tony almost felt sorry for her. But then he doubled over in agony himself, gripping his stomach tightly.
“No, of course not! You-you’re not like that, I would never-“
“‘Sides...” Tony shrugged tiredly and felt his head start to pound in rebellion. “Wasn’t like I sent it.” Just to get the last word out. Old habits died hard.
“Does he?” The doctor raised a brow. “Should I ask him?”
"Tony?" Steve stopped instantly when he heard him sniff. Then he froze and pushed himself up to check.
“Was so worried.” Steve said in a voice that sounded like it had swallowed marbles. “I thought I was gonna lose you. I was so angry but I thought you were hurt.”
The doctor went silent but Tony felt it was more for his sake than anything else. When Tony looked at him, he realized the doctor was pleased. Almost like he’d been waiting for this.
“Wait! Where are you going?” Tony followed him and silently panicked that he’d upset him. But Steve had seemed like he had a good sense of humor, so why-
In the main body of the huge quinjet, he was greeted with the sight of the Avengers. Thor and Carol were discussing something with the Shield earth and space teams, while Natasha was helping Hank settle things into a silver briefcase. He decided to join Natasha and Hank.
The hands held him up and suddenly he was surrounded by the scent of pine and vanilla. It flooded his senses and he whined softly, feeling the muscles of his face relax.
“Enough.” Steve stopped him with a hand. But his eyes were fixed on Tony. “What aren’t you telling me?”
“Tony.” Tony heard from his left and turned to meet Steve’s pleading eyes. The eyes of a soldier searching desperately for a home. Or a sneaky super soldier looking for a free ride. He’d never pictured Steve to be an exploiter of all things.
“Seeing as these are changing times for you, I thought I could offer you a job instead. As my head of research and development.”
“It’s time.”
Steve stops and stares at him. “What?”
He just prayed there was no Galactus where he was going.
Maybe he gives himself away but as he looks at Bucky, he knows instantly that Bucky knows too. After all, there’d been no fight.
“Hey. Can I get you a drink?” Tony said but there was no push behind it. It was just to get her to open up a bit.
"I don't feel the same way towards you as I do Iron man." Steve admitted, watching Tony's eyes dim and his lips fall, despite his earlier courage. "But I do feel something else."
They stood there awkwardly for at least a good minute before Steve finally cleared his throat and jerked his head. The tailor proceeded but with extreme caution, much to Tony’s surprise and delight. He felt fine now.
Maybe guilt.
“Woodlands. Forests. Anthony-“ Zeke’s eyes blazed with anger. “-have you slept with someone?”
Steve’s eyes flickered from the bottle to Tony’s face. Then he licked his lips and took it silently.
“Now would you look at that. Cap, why don’t you spend some time with your guest and make sure he’s actually enjoying himself. I’d hate to find out you’re not being a good host.” Fury said dryly but Tony twisted around to stare at him in disbelief.
“Stark. We need you to come in.” She sighed, and almost sounded tired. Strangely enough, Tony didn’t think it had anything to do with him.
“LIKE HELL YOU WILL!” Steve roared and slammed his fist on the desk, making both Maria and Tony jump. “IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO YOU AGAIN I’LL-“
He splashed his face again, feeling the cold like a slap to the face. It did the trick.
Tony didn’t know much about the SHRA, other than what he’d read. But he did know who’s fault it was that the team split. And that Norman had taken over and managed to gain one of the armours. That the Skrull had managed to invade. And that Steve had been-
Then when he spoke, the feeling in the air changed. “I checked out the number of deaths in this area. Wanted to get an idea of what I was dealing with. You know what I found?”
A brief pause happened. Then Tony swallowed thickly and took his eyes off Steve to look at the drinks.
“I have a mark?” Tony asked lightly, prodding at his neck gently. It burned under his skin and suddenly, he longed to grab a mirror and see for himself.
He didn’t say a word. He simply turned around and left, trying not to let the sounds of laughter make him do something rash like pick up the suit he’d promised to give up.
“Name?” The big burly man in a black suit with a com grunted, not paying them much attention. The other guards didn’t say a word, simply re-adjusting their grip of their guns.
Tony's eyes gleamed like granite and his expression went cold. He stared at Steve. “And they failed.”
Instead of commenting, the doctors merely rolled his eyes. “Contrary to what you may think Mr. Stark, I’m not saying this lightly. We’ve been down this road before.”
Still, this evening had had enough surprises. Tony would've been grateful to have missed out on another one.
“Fine.” He held up his hands and sighed. “So we don’t have any doubts here, I’m saying it now, it’s a bad idea. Me and him-“
With a grunt, Ty snatches his hand away and steps back. Tony longs for Steve to stay close, he’s so close right now-
“I know you’ve been draining this area for about a year now. And I know that one of you-“ Steve pointed between Zeke and Ty. “-has built up a group of black haired and blue eyes vampires. And have been doing so for years.”
“It’s just an article. Nothing to worry about.” Steve assured him calmly. There was no way in hell Tony needed to hear what it was about. The last thing Steve wanted to do was allow Tony to even
Somehow Tony had a feeling things would improve.
“Before you even try and explain that one, I just want to say one thing, okay?” Steve said quietly and sniffed once before rubbing at his eyes.
Alarm bells went off in Tony’s head. “Ah look, pup. If my leader finds out I’ve been fraternizing, it could cause a lot of trouble. I’d rather not.”
Tony is there, concealed in his black and gold suit as always. It’s clean and polished and gleams in the light. The golden-yellow eyes of the helmet meet him and suddenly he can’t help but let out a sigh of relief.
Steeling his nerves, Tony left the labs and headed up to the main deck. But as soon as he entered, he knew he’d be going up himself. Maria was no where to be found.
Still, Stark seemed to stop crying. He just gave Steve a tired look, like he knew what he was thinking.
“Your card. You activated the signal at a bench about ten blocks from here a few days ago. We started to look there and found your card in the snow. Then we spoke to the shops around there and asked about you. They said they thought you looked familiar and...” Steve blows out a breath and looks away. He squeezes his hand tighter though, which Tony finds he doesn’t mind. “They all mentioned you carrying a bottle with you. We found it a few streets from where we found you.”
Feeling his vision go white, he screamed out in agony as his spine began to press on his nerves. Then he heard a snap and felt pain unlike anything he’d ever felt before.
“None. And he’s not taking any medication that we know of. His blood types’ A-positive and he also has a history with heart related conditions but I think that’s all in the file.”
“I get punished.”
“It’s better we don’t.” Steve said firmly, squeezing his eyes shut at the thought. He could still see the image of the clone in his mind.
He’s alone and he has been for some time now. And he’s so
"Oh Tony." She said softly, ever so softly and looked away as if she was struggling to watch. "You should talk to him. We all know how you feel about him. And he does feel that way about you too, he's just being stubborn."
Ty snarls and wraps a hand around Tony’s shoulders.
Steve looks like he’s been slapped. The anger vanishes from his eyes and all he can do is stare at Tony again.
Shaking himself out of these thoughts, Tony looked around the rest of the room. As usual, Zeke’s peculiar taste had spread to all aspects of the square room, the ugly faded colors of the large rug in the center enforcing a certain era on the walls. The furniture was all wooden, carved swirls into the chest of draws and wardrobe, and the same was found on the bed frame and desk. The only thing Tony even remotely liked about this room was the fire place below the Stane portrait. It was the only thing warm in this frozen room.
hoped.
This was going to be a restaurant date. His first one in months since he’d broken up with Steve.
“I’d prefer it if you rested instead.”
“Hold still.” He ordered and ignoring Tony’s squawk, he tightened his hold even more and pressed his cheek to Tony’s neck.
The press was gonna love this.
By the looks of things he’d been waiting by the door patiently with a quiet smile and a relaxed expression on his face while the rest of the agents had already started working in their designated sections of the lab. Tyler didn’t comment on Tony’s lateness but he did raise an eyebrow when he saw how frazzled he looked.
“I’ve felt that before.” Steve said softly, giving Tony his utmost attention. Tony turned to him and smiled gently, watching Steve’s worried eyes dance from the reflection of the light. For a moment, it was just the two of them.
It was all so warm. And
From what Pepper told him about that time, he was lucky to still be alive.
It was dark and cold in space. No one had ever described it like that but Steve didn’t care. He could be the first, second, third, fourth, fifth-
Reed and Strange are sat down over a pile of metal and sheets. They both seem to be mulling over some blueprints while a hologram of the incomplete Dyson sphere takes up the room. They don’t hear him or Carol come in.
Grant’s mind flooded with hope. They looked like him! They stood on two legs and had two hands and made the same motions he did!
The conversation had been eye opening;
He doesn’t want to admit it but Rogers hadn’t been wrong about the holding down thing either. But it was something he’d never told anyone about before. Not even Ty because he knew Ty loved it.
It seemed warm and inviting, and as Tony stepped closer to the bed, he paused.
“What happened Stark?”
It was simple. He was to collect blood and feed from enough beings in these areas to keep the Stane claim fresh. Every six days like clockwork, until Zeke found a suitable replacement.
"On it!" He cried and didn't waste another second. Each second was precious in a fight, he knew. One wrong move and things could go wrong. One wrong glance and you could be killed. One wrong turn and you could be-
Feeling something in his chest loosen, Tony bit his fangs into his lip to keep from smiling. Butterflies. He had butterflies in his stomach.
Steve didn’t move. His mouth parted but he quickly closed it and kept his distance.
“How is he?” She asked quietly after a brief nod, and more emotions flooded her eyes than Steve had ever seen. Again, he could not blame her.
He didn’t have anything against the man, not at all. On the contrary, he respected Mr. Stark’s efforts to do his part even if it was just giving money over.
God, what would he say to Steve’s mate? How would he explain that he got him
It was late but Tony couldn’t sleep. The strange new place filled with a few snoring agents was enough to pull him away from resting. The gently hum of the Helicarrier didn’t help either, so he sat up and climbed out of his bunk bed, eyeing the small metal ladder with disdain. It felt about as unstable as it looked.
“Tony...” Steve’s eyes glimmered and darkened a little. He licked his lips and Tony watched his tongue like he was hypnotized by it.
“I wasn’t talking about Sharon.”
Pleased, Zeke hummed in acknowledgement and looked around. The cavern was empty and the corridors leading to the other members’ rooms were unlit. They had been the only ones awake at this time of night.
It reminded Tony of a time where he had gotten hit in a fight. A claw had sunk itself into the side of the armour and Steve-
“Director inbound.” Tony heard in his ear and nearly jerked at the title.
Tony blinked harshly, suddenly feeling his mind slam to a halt. How was it fair? He cared about Steve so much but Steve promised he didn’t feel the same, yet the moment someone tried to take him away, Steve would just step in and stop it. It just didn’t make any sense. What on earth was that?
“I think you know in your heart which one it is.” Pepper says smugly and he can hear her typing away in the background. “You obviously have a preference.”
A whole world of possibilities opened. This was just the start.
Stark managed to get his feet under him in time though.
“I’m tired. I’m gonna sleep.”
“Once he lost all vital signs, the armor would register and take over. The protocol would be activated and serve one purpose.”
When Rhodey had found him, he'd apparently started crying. He didn’t remember it but Rhodey had seen it.
"I don't think that's-"
“Oh but Captain, he’s not yours.” Ty says and suddenly the friendly pretense drops like a mask coming off. “See, I’ve been seeing Tony for months. And we were planning to bond this week-“
“Try not to destroy the house while we’re gone Rogers.” Ty smiles and waves as he follows Tony to his bedroom. Steve doesn’t respond to Ty but does call out him.
“S-Steve?”
“Hello agent...”
There’s someone across the road. A man with blond hair, in a long beige coat who seems to be carrying a suitcase and looking around. All of a sudden, Tony’s hit with a wave of longing.
“Sorry if I find it hard to believe that me and you got together again after what happened Ty.” Tony says and then quickly adds; “Same with me and you Cap.”
“It’s been a long year.” Tony said thinly instead, giving Steve a tight smile. “I don’t think you can do anything about that.”
“What’s my favorite color?”
Again.
But it did fit with what he knew of Steve from the past.
Tony hummed and reached out for the scanner by his door. It unlocked under his palm and he trudged in, dumping his briefcase on the chair by his bed.
Carol had approached him earlier. Along with Natasha, Sam and Maria.
“So, mister Stark, your test results have come back. Your blood sugar levels are far too low and your blood shows low mean volume. You need to be careful and make sure you eat carefully from this point on. Otherwise you could become seriously malnourished.”
“Does anyone have eyes on the Helicarrier defense? Any signs of attack?”
“Of course sir. Shall I attach pictures of the suits you’ve already picked out?”
“Why should
”I’m non-combatant.” Tony explained calmly, feeling something twist in his stomach when Ben barked out a nervous laugh and rolled his eyes. The action seemed jarred, like he’d taken a hit and was somewhat dazed. He didn’t seem as cutting as he usually was.
Steve’s finger itched for the space uniform. He desperately prayed for a miracle.
“Hey.” Steve nudged him gently and that was when Tony realized, he had closed his eyes and was leaning his head on Steve’s shoulder. Somehow, he’d managed to shift so that he was relying on Steve.
“No. But you weren’t okay and we could all see it. Hopefully you feel better now?”
It was just that he didn’t want Steve hurt. It was just that he couldn’t bear the thought of losing Steve again. And it was just the fear that he’d lose what they could have.
Tony didn’t say anything for a moment. But then, he shifted a little and opened his eyes again. This time, they met Steve’s instantly.
He could do this.
"And what would that be?" Tony sounded resigned and tried to pull his hand away. Only Steve didn't let him and he looked up in shock.
“Did you see the look on his face!? I swear, priceless!”
sorry.”
“Follow me Stark.”
“I’m not worried.” Tony mumbles and feels his cheeks flush when Rogers starts to scent of joy. God, he’s like a puppy.
Well that was a surprise. Last he’d heard from her, everyone had been going their own separate ways following Osborn’s defeat. She’d quickly left after calling him an idiot.
“It’s okay though.” Tony smiled dully and faced forward. “I got what I deserved.”
She’d smiled, pressing a kiss to his forehead and to this day, Tony could still remember his exact thoughts.
“Well apparently you have. Apparently you did.”
“At least one death every five days. Alleys one to twelve. Round the clock and always human. Then something changed exactly three weeks ago.”
The moment faded and Tony reached up and pulled Fury’s hands away carefully. When he turned, he noticed a pinched look on the man’s face, which was pretty remarkable considering he only had one eye to narrow.
Steve looked him over carefully. Then a slow smile spread across his face, dark and cruel.
“You probably don’t want me anywhere near that. You know how I am, me and machines can get into all sorts of trouble, I’d hate for something to happen to-“
Tony’s eyes widened and his smile vanished. He stared.
In his hand, he grips the neck of the empty brown bottle tighter. He carries it around like a carcass.
Then, before Tony could say anything, Steve pressed a button under the desk and turned to the holo-screen that appeared in front of him. Agent Hill appeared on the screen.
“You’re an arachnid?” Tony asked, keeping his volume steady. Natasha was also an arachnid-a black widow, he’d thought. When she’d walked in, she’d appeared calm and confident in a way that was almost threatening. This kid seemed uncomfortable in his own skin.
“Tony, you need to answer me, and I need an honest answer-the most honest goddamn answer you can give me.” Steve demanded with a voice that shook. His eyes were blazing with anger. “Do you want this?”
Steve glared right back and mirrored him. They both sat and scowled at each other stuck in a stalemate. Tony could see the look in Steve’s eyes.
It wasn’t worth saying out loud. He didn’t need to say much. Really, what could he say?
Sharon smiled a little and shook her head. “I think you’ve got the whole table covered. You’re good.”
”Or you could just order me two body suits and get me some normal clothes. I don’t always need to look like a good little soldier.”
“You’re welcome sir.”
“Do you think he’s gone feral!?”
“There’s something they’re not saying. I know you feel it too. I think it’s big.”
“You can’t leave Stark. Not yet.” He said firmly, using his hand to guide Tony back round. With a look that barely masked his frustration, Tony let him.
“I know.” Steve grit his teeth and pulled his legs out onto the ball pit steps, but not without difficulty. The medium size Cap-tsum was pulling on his boot and was somehow using telekinesis to try and bash his little shield against Steve’s leg and the baby ones seemed to be getting ready to do the same.
“Sharon, how’re we looking?” Steve said quietly, approaching her from behind the pilot seat, to watch the radar in front. This quinjet was fully adapted for spacial flight, but Steve had never been comfortable with the idea of reaching the stars unless he absolutely had to.
It had been an accident. Jan had been standing in the wrong place at the wrong time when part of the building had threatened to come down. Iron man had been the one closest to her and while keeping her safe, he’d taken a nasty hit to the front of his torso.
“You guys shouldn’t have brought me.” He said with a soft laugh that sounded so forced, even
That startled him. He jumped back from the outstretched hand and shook with fear.
It took Steve a day to realize that Tony was spending more time in the kitchen cooking and cleaning up after everyone than he was in the labs.
.” Tony scoffed, taking the napkin and scrunching it up tight. “I’ll spell it out for you. He
Steve’s lips twitched up like he was enjoying himself. “Would that bother you if it was?”
Crouching on the washing machine, he balanced on his feet and waited patiently. Now for a victim.
Robots. He saw grey,humanoid-like robots with guns and glass lenses firing directly towards the agents. Some were slightly bigger than others but they all seemed to be sifting through the agents with ease. And they looked fairly durable, unlike the standard doom-bots Tony knew all too well.
Tony looked down at the table and stared. Then he squeezed his eyes shut and ducked his head further.
“Yes.” Steve sounded like he was about to cry.
“Sorry.” Tony croaked, feeling a sickening ache settle in his heart. “Sorry.”
“We’re a team. We look out for each other.” Steve said quietly and there was something sad in his gaze.
Steve seemed reluctant to say much, shooting glances at the others for help. When none came, he sighed.
“Sir, there are several encryptions. Would you like me to break through?”
“You’re kidding me!”
“He's brave.” Steve pushed and took a step forward. “Why was it that the second the law came out, you stopped seeing me as Steve and started seeing me as a threat? You knew I was courting you.”
“Oh. Well, of course you do”. Zeke cleared his throat and looked down. “Forgive me pet. I am not in the best frame of mind for suggestions but if you have one, be my guest.”
Tony hadn’t prepared enough for the moment. He could barely take his eyes off the man in front of him.
“Oh god...” Steve whispers and crawls close enough to be kneeling beside the armor. Slowly, the pieces start to fall into place and all he can think is
There he settled for a minute, casting a sweeping look over the streets. It was clear and quiet tonight, midnight on a Thursday was apparently not so popular and even the cars seemed somewhat absent.
Just then, a loud noise blared over the desert, sending Grant tumbling to the ground in pain. The ear-splitting screech didn’t stop, even when his vision doubled from the pain. Tears began to gather in the corners of his eyes as the reality dawned.
“Is it the Avengers again?” Tony hedged his bets, sucking in a breath when Zeke’s blood red eyes focused on him.
“Oh of course, Captain. It’s important, having men like him. They’re always important for giving the others...motivation. You know. On what to do, how to behave. That sort of thing” Pierce said lightly, but there was something dark and ugly in his eyes and a shiver ran down Tony’s spine.
“Stay here. Let’s talk now. Let’s fix this.”
A lie. He wonders if Steve would’ve been worried about him. If Steve, like Pepper and Carol and Maria and Sam, and now Rhodey and Don Blake and Natasha and several others would try to pin him down and pull the problem out of him.
“Are you toying with me!?” Steve shouts because apparently Tony is adamant on ignoring him, even behind closed doors.
Uncharacteristically, Steve sighed and rubbed at his head tiredly. It wasn’t like him to show weakness.
He needed to go. He
As each word was said, Tony’s heart sank more and more until finally he felt it plummet into murky depths. He drew his hand back and felt his smirk start to vanish.
“I don’t understand.” Steve’s eyes darted over Tony rapidly, making sure there were no areas of injury left. But other than seeming exhausted, Tony looked a thousand times better. His cheeks were regaining his natural color, even to the top of his nose, and his skin felt so much warmer. Steve decided to keep his hand on Tony’s cheek to keep an eye, just in case.
“Ben! The shield!” Tony shouted into the speakers, hoping the man would listen to him, even if just for once in his life. If he could just grab that then they’d be okay-
“N-no-“
“It’s ‘yes
“Uh Cap? You okay there buddy?”
“Of course.”
While he waited for her to pick up, he let the piece of paper fall and leaned back in his chair. His eyes felt sore and his feet hurt from standing all week. And that was definitely a headache coming on.
Checking everything was in place, Steve sharply turned on his heel and held his hand out.
The minute he spoke, Steve’s smirk seemed to slide right off his face. Then he frowned.
Tony squinted at the holder where the usual cannons and weapons mounts would be. Surely there would’ve been some weapons on standby?
“You are
“Yes, thank you! Do it quick!”
“Another one.”
As he lamented over the inevitable feeling of waking up tomorrow morning with a killer headache, he began to walk forward, not really paying attention to where he was going. When he reached the elevator at the end, he paused. Then he shrugged and pressed the button to the main area. Maybe a walk would help. Plus, it would be a good idea to know his surroundings better, especially since this was gonna be home for a while.
Finally Fury sighed and lowered his hand. “Rogers needs you to do a few things for him. Stay a while, talk to him. He planned a few things for you.”
The whole way there, Tony kept wondering about Steve’s words. Not once had Steve ever said
“God, Tony.” Steve whispers, not letting go of his hand. “Your lips were blue. You were so cold and I-I thought you were...”
“If you say Stark, I will walk out of this door and never speak to you again, Rogers.” Reed hisses with revived rage and almost jumps forward to attack him. Strange stops him again but this time, he gives Steve a disappointed look.
Tony didn’t seem impressed by his question, in fact, he looked pretty upset. “Of course I’d save you. You were about to play paint on the tarmac! I wasn’t gonna let you fall.”
Steve hadn’t heard him laugh in four weeks.
“I love you too okay? You don’t need to be afraid.”
“My company Steve. It’s kind of my main issue at the moment. I need to have something in place to deal with that first. And as it stands, I’m having no luck, instead of one offer-“
"Go to sleep. We'll talk in the morning." Steve says and though he doesn't smile, there's a strength to his eyes that Tony hasn't seen before. He looks reborn. Stronger and new.
“Yeah.” Steve said, starting to smile too. “He’s strong. Brave. Pretty reckless at times but still. I think I’ve found him.”
“No! Never!” Tony could never let him think that. He’d loved every second with Steve.
Not their weaknesses.
He’d never had an issue with fittings before and now suddenly he couldn’t seem to even hold still. Not even Super solider serum hands could keep him still. Every brush of the tape tickled and Steve’s hands were too soft on his skin, almost edging towards grabbing but not quite. It was a fine line and made Tony almost wish Steve would either let go completely or just hold on.
“I’m afraid not, Mr. Stark.” The doctor says-only it’s not his doctor, it’s his
“Excuse me gentlemen. Mind telling me when the commander will get here?” Tony said politely. From the small circle they’d formed, they all stared at him in muted horror, as if he’d committed a crime. Maybe defaced the shield logo or something.
All of a sudden Tony’s phone began to ring, blaring out an obnoxiously loud tune. Steve had half a mind to throw it if he wasn’t bedridden.
Tony watched Maria guide Steve into the nearest seat and pour out a glass of water. There was something surreal about it. The way Maria seemed so certain of her actions, so confident as she rubbed Steve’s shoulder and handed him the glass. As if this wasn’t her first rodeo and-
“Oh don’t look so worried, I’m fine.” Tony waved, gesturing at the firm clench of Steve’s jaw. “You’ll break some teeth doing that.”
Fingers tapped his cheek gently. Slowly he looked up.
“Thanks Winghead.” Tony replied, and looked at the screen again. The red dot had stopped. “You in position?”
“No.” Captain America says sharply, causing everyone in the room to stare at him. Even Ty looks surprised.
“Hey honey bear.” Tony whispers, feeling his shakes begin to slow as his body grows tired. He has no idea what’s gone wrong but he’s starting to realise there’s a chance he might not survive. God...he hopes he survives.
Steve had become an observer. On some days he felt like a captain standing by as his ship sunk. Others he felt like someone charged of watching an execution.
Balls crashed everywhere and went flying in an array of colour. Mostly reds and blues with a few yellows. He had to admit, it did look fun.
The tower wasn’t far. Beyond the passing yellow blur of cabs was the tower and with it, a faint sense of home. But it didn’t give him that full feeling anymore, hence his detour. As he powered on, he felt something ease in him.
“Ah my pet! There you are-thank you Norman. Go tend to Whitney please, I know she’s upset.”
The next words surprised them both.
“Jeez.” Tony laughs a little nervously. “You look pretty worried there Cap.”
“It’s classified. Nothing to concern yourself with Mr. Stark.”
Tony didn’t know what to say to that. That was not true. If Steve cared he would-
“What?” Tony couldn’t stop thinking about the look Stern gave him. A shiver ran down his spine.
They came to a door at the end of the corridor, and Tony felt his shoulders loosen at the thought of not being with this young woman any longer. Silence always set him on edge, and even more so when there was no one to turn to. It was almost isolating.
Tony tried not to think about how likely it was that he was the cause behind Steve’s stress. It was a recurring theme, it seemed and Tony could only pretend for so long before the math proved it all.
“No. Not even a bit.”
“Nope.” Stark folded his arms and rocked back on his heels. “I play a lot of tennis though.”
Reed looks at him and stares.
Maybe Captain America...maybe Steve Rogers loves him after all. Maybe Captain America is his alpha after all.
“Mr, Stark, I want you to take a deep breath for me and start naming five things you can see. Do you understand?”
Was that important?
"S-sorry I just-" Tony let go of Steve completely for a minute to close a hand over his mouth. It took a good minute for his laughs to die down.
Well that's good. Tony thought tiredly and hovered towards the ground as he saw the many dozens of robots begin to fall. It was a sight to behold.
“They might want to see you.” Steve says beside him and Tony turns to face Steve completely. Steve is right beside him, has been the whole time.
“He’s alright Captain. We weren’t going to let anything happen to him, we knew it was a possibility with his heart, so we’d planned for it.” The obstetrician smiles and makes a few notes on the chart. “Though honestly I’m glad you're better and I’m happy to say the baby is very healthy too. I’m so pleased you remember which alpha is yours Mr. Stark.”
“This is...unexpected.” Reed says quietly and turns to face him. Behind him, the image of Captain America and Ironman, arm-in-arm, stood in front of the Avengers team, stares back at him.
Eyes red and wounded, Steve looks up and glares at him. It’s made all the more worse by how wet his cheeks are.
“I thought...”
“Gentlemen. We need to talk.”
Slowly he stepped towards the bunk bed at the very end and counted.
In his memory, Steve never said it back. So he knows he probably won’t hear that but just being able to tell him-
Tony glances up at Steve and watches him carefully and to his surprise, Steve looks down at him with a frown and Tony can see a hint of genuine fear in his eyes.
"I'm sorry." Tony breathed and looked up, feeling his eyes start to burn. "I was just trying to keep you safe. That's all."
After a brief moment of silence, Tony dropped his hand and sighed. “You know I can handle myself right?”
He felt Steve’s steel eyes follow him all the way.
“Have Jarvis give you his vitals.” Clint said and the medics all nodded and spoke rapidly to each other, one grabbing a cool towel and pressing it to the back of his neck. Another pressed fingers to his neck and took his pulse.
“Leader?” Steve said, instantly stopping. “You work for someone?”
“Yeah, well. Join the club.”
It was...flattering. It also made him feel a lot better.
you come in here and ask me to give him to you? How can you even think- “
“What’re you, a cop?”
So how could he just waltz into the tower and greet Jenny at the front reception? How could he keep sending emails to Mike in the R&D department when he’d soon make him jobless? How could he go back there and pretend everything was fine when it clearly wasn’t?
He only had dinners and lunches late. Always at the very end of the hour so that not many would see him come and go. He didn’t mind so much if the food was colder, or there was less. It was still better than being subject to scrutiny.
Ty’s pants are off. He’s just in his boxers now. Tony can’t believe it but at the same time...
Finally, when he pulled away, he stared at the breathtaking view of the man he loved. Tony smiled back at him, equally mystified and behind them, Carol and Thor just smiled.
“I’m in a suit!” Tony shouted, gritting his teeth together. “I can take it! You shouldn’t have done it!”
“Why?”
“Come with me. Where do you prefer?”
To say Steve had panicked was an understatement. The fact that the fight had ended in under six minutes after that was telling.
"Hey, don't worry. This is for the best." Tony tries, though he feels his throat closing up as Steve's cries get louder. "I'm happy. This makes me happy. I wanted this."
Tony stepped into the dark room. For once it felt like an escape.
“Steve...” Tony could hear the medics around him. Could hear the distant sounds of people, a crowd gathering around them watching a scene that was meant for only the closest of couples-Steve was cupping his cheek and telling him his safety was the most important thing to him.
He had to live on the Helicarrier for however long it took to get the technology working again. There wasn’t a specific time frame in there. He had to take orders from the head of R and D which was also not ideal since he was better than all of them (not his fault). And not just that but he had to be prepared to follow the orders of the current commander. That meant Steve. Essentially this was a contract to work as a Shield agent.
“What makes you think-“ But before the Beyonder could say anything else, Strange’s portal began to open up behind him, and just as Steve had hoped, he took a second to stare at it. And that second was enough.
They stood in silence and just watched each other in the dim light. Tony wondered if every relationship was as complicated as theirs. If others had the same dilemma and loved as intensely as they did.
“I bet your mate loves that.” Tony smirked, imagining what Steve would be like all...out of control. It seemed delicious.
The chair scraped against the floor. Steve still didn’t turn. “You said you’d spent an awful long time waiting for a partner. The right partner.”
Tony kept his eyes firmly on the window after that. Steve didn’t say a word, but through the reflection, Tony thought he saw Steve frowning at him.
“Tony-“
Once they reached the door, Steve used his final key and let Tony in. Two things stuck out.
“He’s not responding to verbal cues but he is aware. It’s almost like he’s gone into bond shock. Does he have a mate?”
Finally he straightened up and met Tony’s gaze. But not before he gestured towards Jeremy.
“Did I want-OF COURSE I DIDN’T WANT THIS! I NEVER FUCKING WANTED THIS!” Steve roared and Tony all but collapsed back into his seat in shock. He couldn’t breathe and he had to cup his mouth with both hands to keep the gasps down. He was hyperventilating-he was gonna be sick-
“Yeah and you also killed Captain America.” Sam mumbled under his breath and that, well that just-
“Change of plan! I found the control panel!” Steve yelled, much to Tony’s delight. “Bring me my shield Shellhead!”
“Yeah. How could I ever forget you?” Tony sighs and laughs a little when Steve sniffs quietly and blinks back tears.
“Yes. Safe.”
“I wanted to speak to Reed. There’s something I want to ask.” He says and comes to stand beside her. “You?”
Of course, Tony was reluctant to accept anything from her. She was manipulative in every sense, and wasn’t shy about her intentions towards him. He felt sick to his stomach at the thought of Zeke pushing their union and he downright dreaded the very thought of having children with her. He didn’t want children. He didn’t want to marry her at all.
"I'm not hurt." Tony croaked and couldn't help but laugh softly as the tears fell. "I'm happy. I'm actually happy for once."
“Just...no that’s good. I’ll pick you up in fifteen. Decide on a place while I get there.”
“Okay, time out! Why don’t we all just step back and do our own thing-“
“I’m just weighing this up best to help you. Think of your employees Tony.”
“I’m gonna start calling for him. Everyone make your way here.”
The sun was starting to set just outside. From his seat beside Steve's bed, Tony could see through the window the sky fanning out into an array of oranges and pinks. Down below people were walking with their soulmates and smiling and feeling complete.
Despite the pain and anguish and rage in Steve’s eyes, they glimmered with hope as they looked at Tony.
Horror welled up in his mind. The realization struck with it.
"How long?" Tony challenged, feeling his heart beat out of his chest.
Head rising, he closed the book and nodded in Tony’s direction, a slow smile appearing on his face. “I am glad to see you pet. How was it?”
“Tony.” The man says and instantly, before Tony can even register, wraps his arms around him and pulls him to his chest. His entire body encompasses Tony’s very being and he almost frowns when he takes a deep breath.
“Go inside with Maria. She’ll have you fitted with cuffs and go through your curfew.”
“I have a pup.” He breathes, feeling Steve’s breath catch. “I can’t believe we made him...we made a
Tony shook his head. "You'll regret it."
“Sometimes you need a little restraint. Imagine if we did things like that all the time. You’d never stop.” Ty says sweetly and raises a brow. “You can be a little needy sometimes.”
But no, he had to carry on. He would venture out with his favorite suit (his only suit), and explore this ship of the stars.
It was hard to imagine he’d once lived on the Helicarrier as the director. Sometimes he’d think about it and still not come up with a way to picture it.
“Where’s Stark?” Steve says. As calmly as possible.
He’d dreamed of Manhattan, his time with Steve and even that brief moment with that elderly woman.
“So you need to be fighting?” That did make sense. Werewolves were seen to be fierce and pretty deadly in wolf form.
"You weren't responsible for my death Tony. It wasn't you, and I'll show you the reports to prove it. Did we fight? Yes. Did we hurt each other? Yes. But that applies to both of us. It was never just your fault. It was both of us." Steve said calmly, but his eyes shon with tears and he looked like he was searching for something desperately. "And I owe you an apology for that."
“Nice going Tones. Knew you wouldn’t let me down.” Steve whispered and pulled back.
It was easy enough to set himself up. Once Tyler left him, he familiarsied himself with what tool were in the cabinets and made a mental note of all the big machinery that was lining the walls of the room. The square lab cubicles were lining the centre of the room, so everyone could access all the machinery but work on their own things. It was perfect for what he needed.
Tony thought and laughed to himself, trying not to feel too bothered by Steve’s shocked expression. This one was easy.
He really wished he hadn’t come. And that this prick would stop calling him
Tony was nervous. He didn’t know why but he couldn’t stop shifting and bouncing his leg on the drive back.
Of course, as soon as he gains his balance, he stops and stares.
His cheeks looked pale as a sheet. His eyes seemed dim and somewhat glazed, like he was barely paying attention. His body was thinner than he’d remembered it being and that was despite losing loads of weight when he’d been trapped in the bottle all those years ago.
He’s alone. His alpha has left him.
“Steve...” He whispers and breathes. “The father...it’s
“Jarvis, take some pics.”
For some reason, he remembered the guards at the front door. The snickers of the politicians and the stain on his shirt.
"You gave me everything. When I had no friends and no real family other than the one that had imprisoned me, you found me and you gave me something to hope for. You gave me a home and I-"
"Well apparently you did." Steve sighed. "I don't want you to think of yourself like that. You're not a traitor Tony. We both made mistakes. for instance-"
It’s an unspoken rule that Tony is basically gonna have to chose which alpha he’s with. When the baby’s born, he’s going to need to make the choice, whether he remembers or not.
Despite himself, Steve sucks in a breath. Maybe he hadn’t realized it before, but hearing that suddenly gives him a certain hope. And he hates it.
“Why would you say that?”
“Ugh...sorry.” Tony sniffed, grimacing when he pulled his hand away. Steve’s hands hadn’t moved from his shoulders. They were inches away from each other, a small space just for them to share.
Tony’s back throbbed as he pushed himself up to his feet again. Against his will, he hissed at the pain and felt his eyes shut.
“What do you mean?”
He kept going, a silent assassin in the night. Closer and closer he got, until finally-
He had a team. He had friends-
When they’d first heard the news, Steve had tried to argue through the diplomatic route. He’s been naive though, thinking that there was no way they would refuse him-
Tony’s eyes followed him and didn’t shift when he stood up and started to clean their bowls.
“Everything’s fine. Have a seat. I’ll go round the other side.” Steve ordered and Tony scoffed a little. Steve made it sound like they were about to go to a meeting or something.
“I do know. And I’m sure, I saw the footage.” He could hear Steve scowling. “I’m firing that guy. The one in research. He’s the reason you got hurt.”
“Okay sir, I’m gonna have to ask you to step away and give us some space. Can you do that?”
These weren’t terrorists though. These were Shield agents. And this was Steve.
He hadn’t spoken to Steve in months. Maybe that was for the best.
Steve always had been one for dramatics. He usually made the rules in every team he led.
“M’ sorry.” Tony says under his breath, the words soft and faint like a candle blowing out. “M’ sorry f’r not being enough.”
"You're not real. I'm just as pathetic as I was before. Sorry." Tony sighs and gestures towards the items on his desk. "Probably just a last ditch-effort from Extremis. Probably to stop me from killing myself."
“Of course, Captain.” Strange says with a nod and looks him in the eye. Steve immediately notices how tired the man looks. There are deep circles under his eyes, and his facial hair has grown out. So has Reed’s, he notices.
His face was ice-white, almost as if he’d been preserved like Steve had been once. His lips were blue, as if painted by the same dust as the ground was. And his body was limp and lifeless as Steve cradled him and touched his cheek gently.
hate you. It’s the complete opposite, and I shouldn’t be the one telling you but-“
“That’s...amazing.” Tony said in a hushed tone as something twisted in his heart. Steve was really lucky to find someone so quickly. And what were the chances it was one of them? Someone he got to be with every day or close to.
“Then you know how I feel.” Steve said firmly and they reached a stalemate. Tony still felt like he’d taken advantage of him, even if he didn’t know it.
“So I guess I should thank you.” He heard Steve say as he settled beside him. “This really is something.”
He was far too focused on the hand in his.
“Friends, the air is indeed breathable. Captain Danvers has already gone ahead to retrieve scans. We suggest one enhanced Avenger join us in the search so as to ensure we can bring them back, should the air change.” Thor said and eyed Steve carefully.
He felt his lips fall into a small, tired smile. “Thanks. That’s nice to hear.”
He turns back to the screen and issues the order.
“I will. I won’t even see Steve.”
“Steve, I have a plan.” Tony said quickly and grabbed Steve’s arm. “If you aim for the control panel again, I’ll-“
“No, it’s okay Steve, really. I don’t want to intrude-“
The smile slid of Tony’s face.
“Ladies and gentlemen, may I please have your attention!”
“Tony, there you are. I’ve been looking for you.” Steve said suddenly and Tony twisted in his chair to see Steve standing just behind him with a few drinks in hand.
“Ezekiel Stane.” Steve noted, turning his deadly gaze on him and
Trying to calm his body down, he sucked in a deep breath and blew it out. His eyes darted back and forth between the offered hand and the concerned expression on the man’s face.
“Mr. Stark, we need to get him to medical-“
All of a sudden, Steve’s eyes snapped open and he gasped when he saw the growing pool of blood at his feet. But then he lifted his head and looked at Tony like he was trying to meet his eyes through the suit.
But he can’t. That wouldn’t be fair to Ty.
The man was so huge. Big and sturdy and clearly powerful in some way. And he looked so different to anything Grant had seen. He had short blond hair that matched the gold of the first sun and his eyes were a bright blue that matched the second sun. The hand he’d stretched out was covered by a red glove that seemed to be part of the strange blue, red and white armor he wore.
didn’t like.
"I've been waiting for this." Steve admitted quietly between them and suddenly began to pull Tony along to the beat, following the many other pairs as they began to join the traditional waltz. Very old school.
“I still love you Tony.” Steve said quietly and met his eyes, hoping to show it through his gaze. “You’re still the most important thing in my life. Even now.”
Sucking in a deep breath, Steve turned back to Tony and waited.
Tony nodded, feeling his lips part.
Just then, the door swings open and in walks Ty looking frazzled and red in the face.
Fishing through his wardrobe, he pulled out a couple of suits and laid them out, making a mental note to ask Fury which one would be best.
“Did you hear? Those menaces aren’t slowing down at all! I swear it’s because of people like them that we can’t grow anymore!” Zeke cried, waving a newspaper over the table in his living area. They were seated on several artisan couches around a wooden table that looked about a hundred years old. Tony wondered how some of the furniture was even standing half the time.
“Steve.” Tony croaked and coughed a little, watching Steve’s eyes narrow. “About us-“
One year. One whole year.
Hearing several agents give updates on his and Steve’s location, he began to approach the warehouse slowly, taking note of the strange heptagonal symbol on the huge steel double doors at the front.
“So you didn’t want this!?” Tony gasped out in horror and felt like something was choking him. And suddenly Steve snapped out of his haze too. And he was livid.
All of a sudden, he heard a faint noise. The sound of a truck travelling down the road and signalling to turn into the gas station. Feeling a glimmer of hope, Tony turned and glanced up at the truck driver.
“STOP!”
Gabe watched him carefully and shook his head wistfully. “No one made sure, did they? Otherwise you’d be comfortable enough to tell me why you’re upset and Steven wouldn’t be dancing around you like a man on hot flame.”
“I don’t wanna take anything from you. This was a bad idea.”
in his arms. Shakily, he holds Tony with one arm and traces the blood on his cheek. He’s so
Well maybe not the right option but the best.
.” Zeke hinted with no small amount of disgust. “They come along and disrupt our work, like we’re the creatures to blame. They have no consideration for our kind. Needs must, wouldn’t you say?”
“Yep, mhmm.” He popped the
He couldn’t just ignore his real emotions for the sake of-
Slowly they began to move onto smaller topics. Nothing big or too deep but just work questions and thoughts about the evening. Throughout, Tony tried not to be too conscious of the glances from everyone on the table. They all looked smug, even Maria!
Eventually a young woman with blond hair and green eyes spoke up from the group. Her thin lips curved up, ever so slightly as she reached over and picked up the TV remote.
He wondered if Steve had taken some kind of liking to him. Even when Tony stood up and went to do some work, Steve would always jump up and follow. He’d even made himself at home in one of the corners of the lab.
It looked exactly like his arc reactor.
“I just don’t want to disappoint you.” Tony said quietly and instantly looked at the floor, feeling like a complete idiot for giving himself away. How could he admit that in front of Steve without even thinking about how stupid he’d look-
“We have a lot to discuss. But I want to try. I’m ready to try.”
“Leave it!” Steve snapped and Tony jumped back in shock.
He barely spoke up even when addressed, he didn’t offer anyone ideas about what game they should play anymore (not that they did much of that anymore) and he never questioned any order on the field. In fact Steve would have gone as far as to say Tony didn’t want to be
The voices got louder as they got closer. Tony’s heart sank as he realized what was going on.
“What do you mean?” Fury narrowed his eye. “What did he say?”
“Why was Steve here? What did he want?”
His fingers dig into his palm. Hard.
Steve hadn’t been the first one to hear it. It’d been Carol.
There was a vague clenching sensation in his stomach. Like something was curling around him and pulling him. What was he supposed to say? Did he say anything?
Steve was long gone, he was sure.
"Access granted." Steve said clearly and let Tony's hand go. The panel flashed green and Tony glanced at Steve.
“Don’t you get it Tony!” Steve snarled suddenly, eyes glowing in the dark as he slammed his fist against the window pane. “I’ve bonded you! It’s not something you can walk away from! You can’t just ignore this and carry on as normal! You don’t have a choice!”
As his hand grazed over tiny shards, he realized with a sinking feeling that he knew what it was, and he discovered he was right when his hand brushed against a familiar frame.
It occurred to him that Steve was standing behind him now and was clearing his throat. “I made it. Your stomach was rumbling earlier, did you notice? I worked it out. You should’ve eaten something sooner. Last nights’ dinner probably.”
No one has touched him in so long. And especially not Steve.
Once they reached the centre, Steve turned around and faced him, looking oddly serious as he held his hands out. For a moment Tony said nothing. He just stared at the hands in muted shock.
A knock on the door jolted them both and suddenly they were reminded that there was more to life than just this room.
”That’s a solid no, Cap-sorry,
“We need to talk-“
“I’m sorry.” Steve gasps, feeling the air leave his body. He heaves and feels like he’s being ripped apart. “I-I’m sorry-“
Something slammed into him, sending him flying. The sheer force behind the hit, knocked the breath out of his lungs, and for a split-second his vision went black. Thankfully he righted himself in time to avoid another hit. The thing that hit him kept coming towards him.
“Why what?”
Things continued this way for a few more weeks. Tony completed his claims on his set times and accepted the company he got. Steve always seemed to appear after he’d collected enough blood, and seemed to enjoy spending time with Tony and occasionally teasing him.
A bark of laughter escaped before he could stop it.
“Fair. But they’d have me. I’d speed things right up. Ask Mike.”
“That’s the one. She’s not the one he’s after. Don’t be fooled, he’ll say no to her, mark my words.”
“TONY, LOOK OUT!” He screamed, looking ice-white and terrified as he yanked his shield off his back and flung his arm out to throw it. The shield went flying and behind Tony there was a loud metal screech.
“What?” Tony said blankly but Steve was already opening his mouth and-
He was not Steve’s soulmate. He was no one's soulmate.
It was dark outside. There didn’t seem to be lights anywhere, which made sense since he was miles from the nearest town.
Steve’s eyes simmered with rage but he took a breath before continuing. It seemed to help him calm down.
“Director Stark, you’re needed over in Washington.” Maria says to him and gives him a disgusted look before turning away. Behind her, the agents are muttering to themselves and passing judgement.
“Hmm, Steve which one do you prefer? Starting with the first release or actually doing it right-“
“I’m okay.” He whispered, equally quiet and reached up to pull Steve’s hand down. Steve let go thankfully but didn’t step back. He was still somehow inches away.
“Hey, what’s wrong?” Tony asked but Steve just stared past him at the door as if solving some code of his own making. It wasn’t until Steve blinked again, that Tony could heave a sigh of relief.
I am ABSOLUTELY BLOWN AWAY BY THE RESPONSE OF THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER! I CANNOT THANK YOU ALL ENOUGH-YOU ARE WONDERFUL!! Your comments really did motivate me and as such, the fic has grown another chapter so thank you all for making me so excited! :DDD
Silently, Tony reached out and took Steve’s limp hand in his own. Slowly he closed his hand around it and squeezed, hoping Steve could feel it.
“I understand. You saying we’re mated. I belong to you.” Tony said unable to keep the awe out of his voice. “Again, I don’t see what the problem is.”
In the early days of his time as an Avenger, Tony had spent a lot of time with Steve. They’d been through so much together, a never ending tale that spanned through time. Looking back, Tony probably romanticized it a lot more than it had actually been. Steve hadn’t loved him after all. He would’ve said something if he had.
Something about the way Steve spoke made Tony’s body tense. That was Steve’s fighting stance. Were they gonna have a fight?
“I’ll double the offer.” Steve promised, resting his chin on joint hands over the desk in thought. “Whatever he or she is promising you, I can double it. At least.”
On the dates with Steve, he usually discovers something new about himself. Something he’d never pictured but makes sense in a way. It’s still hard to piece things together but he’s trying.
“Oh really? How so?” Steve raised a brow, folding his own arms to mirror Tony.
Steve knows that’s not it. Tony just risked his life to save him and hasn’t even bothered to mention they’re soulmates, not once. That doesn’t come from shame or neglect. That comes from fear. Shame in a different way.
“I-I-fuck,
Finally after the awkward stare, Tony shifted and Steve cleared his throat.
“Why,
“Fine.” Tony huffed and got ready to suit up. “At least let me grab my net. For a
“Lets go back inside.” Tony said firmly, already knowing the answer before the words escaped his lips.
Pulling the sleeves of his suit jacket, he ran his finger and thumb over the silver lining and followed the double lines all around his wrist, inevitably reaching the cuff links again. The Captain America shield looked back at him, practically gleaming from the reflection of the sun through the glass.
Some people were also wearing army suits. Steve would’ve gotten away with it by the looks of it too, and Tony could see rows upon rows of medals on these people’s clothes.
"I want to. It'll help me too."
“Come in.”
“Third floor. Number twenty three.” Steve spoke over him, marching him up the wooden stairs promptly. Right now, because Tony hadn’t had any blood, Steve outmatched him in speed and strength. Tony couldn’t escape.
He’d only experience it with the pureblood he was bonded to now. But he knew, with a sick feeling in his stomach, he’d not enjoy it one bit. And after, it wouldn’t matter how he felt; he’d be Whitney’s puppet and she’d force his hand in everything. Even sex.
It was time to go back. He’d spent enough time out and the last thing he wanted was Zeke sending Norman his way, or worse appearing himself.
“It’s okay.” Tony rubbed his eyes and swallowed, feeling his headache increase tenfold. “I’m used to people feeling disgusted when they look at me.”
Steve stood up from his seat and left. Tony didn’t dare shift his gaze and follow him. Instead, a shaky tremor ran through his spine as he hunched forward to hide his frantic smile as the roar in his ears grew.
Tony almost laughed. Where would he start?
He needed to accept it and move on. Maybe find someone who would treat him well enough. Tony didn’t want much. Just a bit of warmth towards him would be enough. Someone who was kind to others and maybe a little bit kind towards him.
Steve sighed and let his hands fall in his lap. For a moment, he just looked at Tony and didn’t say a word, until;
He’d just cried in front of Steve-in front of everyone. He’d just screamed at him publicly too. Steve probably thought he was insane.
Possessiveness. That was definitely possessiveness.
“I’d love a cheeseburger? How does that sound?”
“So I’m definitely not...”
“Please! Please! Don’t, I have a wife and two kids!” The man cried, tears and snot dripping down his cheeks. He sniffed and tried to pull away again but Tony had him immobilized.
Feeling his cheeks burn, Tony turned and held his hands up. “I’m so sorry, I don’t even know why he-“
“I can’t-I can’t believe-fuck...” Steve panted and finally, let go of the piece of bent plastic in his hands. It fell to the floor with a heavy clatter but was instantly forgotten when Steve turned on his heel and jabbed a finger in Tony’s direction.
“Open it.”
Swallowing, Tony tried to hide his shiver when Steve’s thumbs traced his ribs gently. It was simple really.
“Hold on, let me-“ Steve reached up and peeled off the protective layer still seated on the watch and then looked at it again. And actually the reflective surface was really eye catching now that Tony could see it unhindered. Of course, it also reflected in Steve’s eyes, highlighting the depth of blue. Tony wondered if Steve knew just how intense that blue was.
“Probably what you think. And you're right. I love you Tony.” Steve confirmed and went right up to him, close enough that if he bent down just a little, Tony’s lips were a breath away.
Grant flinched as the man spoke directly to him. Somehow, he’d managed to get so close while he’d been down, that Grant was left blinking. How had he moved so quickly?
Slowly, Steve shifted closer and Tony inclined his head to allow Steve to do it. The chain slipped around him and settled like a warm weight over his neck.
“You deserved better Tony. You always do.”
He was no hero. And he definitely wasn’t a politician. Out there, in the real world he was a hero but only because of lucky words and talking to the right people. He could buy his approval. But in here...
“Yes?”
“It’s the best we’ve got.”
He was going to die.
“I don’t know. But I’m about to find out.”
Tony decides it then. He loves Steve. He really, truly loves him.
Tony blinks and holds his breath. He hasn’t even told Steve yet about what happened.
Zeke looked at Tony again. His fangs didn’t retreat but his expression turned carefully blank.
Sometimes his palms itched for the the tools he found in the cavern. Sometimes he’d grab a pencil and scribble his thoughts down on paper, staring oddly at his creation when he finished because he couldn’t understand where the idea would come from. Perhaps it was a calling from his previous life.
When he looks up, he can see the cogs turning in Ty’s mind. The alpha looks surprised which is strange. Has he really not noticed?
“We’re not.” Tony breathed but of course, Steve wasn’t having it.
“What is it?”
“Very well Captain. Come, we must make haste.”
Steve had not let go since. Even when other agents had noticed, when they'd entered the cafeteria later for dinner. It was clear Steve didn't care.
Steve smiles back hopefully.
It wasn’t ideal, he knew. But it was all he could do.
Tony hears Steve’s voice nearby and opens his eyes. He hadn’t realized he’d closed them. When he looks up, he sees Steve’s wide blue eyes and a fierce expression on his face. The pup whines and cries softly in his arms.
“Well that’s ominous.”
“Call her. And put it on speakers.” He decided and waited while the speakers connected.
He’d sent the contract back with a few requests but they’d been denied. He wasn’t going to be head of the department and Steve was not going to back down from the Commander line.
"I'm so glad you're alright." She said quietly and squeezed him tighter before letting go to face him. "Pepper told us what happened. We were all so worried."
