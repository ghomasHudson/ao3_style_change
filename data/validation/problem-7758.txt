“No,” Tony says quickly, because he doesn’t want Steve to get murdered. "No. I just overheard this conversation— someone asked him if we’d considered getting married, and, well. Ha. No. He hadn’t.”
“Paris,” Jan emphasized.
Some gentle sarcasm was in order.
“We as in my Avengers,” the other Rogers said. “Me and you. My you.”
“Steve, what?” Tony snaps. “No I’m not— sick, or bad sick, or whatever else, I’m— I know I don’t have the greatest track record with that kind of thing, but I wouldn’t keep that from you. Why would you even think that?”
Steve was wide-eyed and wide open, blue eyes as vulnerable as Tony had ever seen them. He felt a little dizzy with it, watching Steve’s eyes flick back and forth between his.
to keep their motorcycles in one piece—”
Janet, although usually a little lackluster in her appreciation of weddings, was all over Steve and Natasha’s.
“I have an appointment with Mr. Stark. Can you point me towards him?”
He is—curled half in on himself sideways in the seat, bony hand clutching a blanket to his chest. His mouth is just slightly open, drooling a little, and the moonlight has him lit up. It’s a strange effect—his skin looks like it’s glowing, except for where stark black shadows block the light, and his face looks like a fucking painting, all moonglow and pale smooth skin and the dark falls of shadows from his eyelashes and hair.
The other Rogers’ face shut down, and Steve’s stomach froze. He knew exactly what the other him was about to say.
Anyway.
“Was that a proposal?” Steve laughs, raising his eyebrows.
Snikt. Snikt.
“Yeah. She liked having a little gardening to do, I think. Think she always wanted to grow flowers though. I used to— I would daydream about making enough money somehow to get her a house. Someplace with room to breathe and enough yard for her to plant whatever the hell she wanted.” He stared up at the ceiling, smile fading. “That was always kind of a pipe dream.”
“Hey, Hulk can be charming,” Spidey interjected. “He really likes kids. And animals. And friendly neighborhood Spider-Mans. He lets me stick to him.”
“My lord,” Iron Man said. “Where is this coming from? You okay, Cap?”
“But it can hit us!” Giant Girl finished, pushing them behind her.
“What’s coming?” Iron Man hauled Steve up by his arm.
“Yeah,” Steve says, quirking a stiff little smile. “I said I couldn’t possibly marry you. I wouldn’t even consider it.”
Steve sat in the chair next to Tony. Tony’d certainly gotten every decorating tool he could possibly have needed for the task, even if he had no idea how to use them.
Logan stopped walking. “Cap and Iron Man.”
But they were getting married. It wouldn’t hurt to ask.
“Using Iron Man as an alter ego would be a pretty solid smokescreen for a woman trying to hide her secret identity,” the article read.
Tony glanced at Steve, dark eyes bright with something unreadable. “Seems that way,” he said to Rogers. “I think I’ll keep my model, if it’s all the same to you.”
Steve sits on the edge of the bed. “Were you going to tell me?” he asks, and Tony, uncomprehending, flips onto his back.
He was hot. Really, instantly hot, in a way that ran the chill out of his bones, lit him up inside with the warm, gentle slide of Steve’s lips on his. Tony just kissed back insistently, carried again by that strange need to bury himself in Steve’s chest. He couldn’t do that, but he could suck on Steve’s lower lip, he could lick his way into Steve’s mouth and do his best to tangle their limbs together inextricably.
“You’re wiped,” he said. “Let’s get you to bed, Avenger.”
“How did you get there?”
“He’s just bad at it, Steve. Communication, openness, conflict resolution. That kind of stuff.”
“First of all,” he said slowly, “that much icing is disgusting. Even to kids. Second, did you clear this with the hospital first?”
“Ascending,” JARVIS said, and Steve’s stomach dropped as the elevator ascended far more rapidly than usual.
“And just like that, the genocidal alien goes free,” Tony said, lips tight.
It reached out and took the book from him.
love with me.”
Eventually they managed to pull away–or, at least, to stop kissing, because they were still pressed together from head to toe and smiling against each others’ skin.
“At least this time it’s not ninjas.”
“Alright, looks like you’ve got a class one acromioclavicular ligament sprain,” the doctor said. “I know you heal faster than most, but the usual standards apply. Sling, ice, ibuprofen, and plenty of rest.”
“Tony? Are you okay?” Steve asks, and Tony realizes he’s been growing more tense, not less, underneath Steve’s hands.
“Sure, Jan,” Steve said, and masterfully repressed a smirk as she gave him what he had come to call the “did Cap just make an internet joke?” squint.
“Yeah, but I didn’t have to share my milk.”
“JARVIS, where is the other Captain?” Steve asked, heart pounding. “Where’s Tony?”
Tony just barely got ahold of him, both hands digging into his forearm, and although Tony tried to swoop with Steve’s momentum, the catch was far from smooth. Steve’s shoulder jarred so fiercely he could hear it groan. He gritted his teeth against the fiery ache in his shoulder socket even as he strained the muscle to leverage himself closer to Tony.
Thor shook his head. “The offer is kind, Stark, but I desire to resume my courtship with the lady Jane Foster whilst the chance yet remains,” he demurred.
Then he remembers the ring, shoved hastily into a box of washers when he could no longer stand to look at it.
“I’ll make sure he rests, Doctor,” Tony assured. Steve snorted.
Steve pulls away.
Quiet. “Are you okay?” Rhodey asks cautiously.
Cap leapt forward, throwing his arms in front of her. “He’s not worth it, Giant Girl.”
“How’s Peter?” Steve asks, stirring the soup idly.
“We’re going to have to fight it here,” he said grimly. “Any ideas?”
Warmth flowered in his chest, sun-hot and sweet, and he crossed the room to Natasha’s side with a stupid grin on his face.
“Steve?” He stopped at the door, turning back, and drew up short, concern swelling at the unexpectedly serious look on her face.
Steve grew just as quickly as he had last season. But it was better: this time he wasn’t gripping tentatively, he was twining all throughout Tony. Each time Tony put out a new bloom, Steve wrapped a new curler around the stem, caressing Tony as he flowered. And even though Tony knew objectively that Pepper’s blooms were more fragrant and Rhodey’s blooms were bigger, Steve insisted that Tony’s were the best and prettiest he’d ever seen.
“I’m probably going to drool on you,” Steve mutters into Tony’s shirt.
“And I needed to get the scepter from them so that my Avengers could undo something terrible. We really were only borrowing it.”
“Seriously, between SHIELD’s pull and my legal team, we can keep the government off you. My legal staff is terrifying, practically inhuman— Natalie here fit right in,” Stark said. Natasha nailed him in the face with a pillow, and Steve, funnily enough, found himself smiling.
“Sometimes when I flirt, I do mean something by it.”
Tasha started to shift, thinking vaguely of waking him up with her mouth, and then stiffened as a sharp, hot pain shot up from her ribs.
“Tony’s in danger. That’s not me up there, JARVIS. I’m the one who — you’ve got an alert set up to let me know if Tony’s not slept in 72 hours. You found me restaurant recommendations for team night, you — you helped me Google Stonewall and AIDS and gay marriage, JARVIS, take me up!”
“It’s always nice to watch you yell at people other than me,” Tony grins.
“I thought it would be nice if we made it especially for them. You know?” Tony sighed. “I’m starting to realize it would probably be just as special if Captain America and Iron Man bought cookies just for them.”
“Oh, come on!” she snarled. “I was just gonna flick him a little.”
“I like your crazy,” he says, and kisses Tony slowly. “That is why I married you.”
Steve smiled wryly. “Thanks, Shellhead.” He tapped at the tablet, pulling up a new image on the holoprojector. “The mist from earlier has dissipated, but there’s an opaque and apparently impenetrable barrier blocking the view from above.”
“I really thought he hit you,” Banner muttered, turning to face the wall.
“Don’t what?” Tony asks, eyebrows quirked challengingly. He pulls Steve’s hand back over. “Don’t kiss my husband?” he says, and presses a sweet little kiss to Steve’s sweaty palm.
“Not too dire, Ms. Stark; you haven't bled through your bandages.” He smiled at her, smoothing her shirt back down. “But please, call me Steve. Nurse Rogers was my mother.”
He hears a strange, soft sound, and shifts his hold on the cat, and suddenly—he can feel the cat purring against him, soft rumbly warmth cuddled up against his shoulder, and feels unaccountably honored.
“Why is it that I always seem to have to deal with you two?”
“Are you okay?” he asks finally.
Tony stares at the little box, eyes burning. There’s this pressure, all in his head and his chest and his throat, and Tony tries to fight it back, but it builds, and builds, and it breaks him.
“It seems that whoever was behind this didn’t have the brains to come up with riddles for us, tragically.”
“Ghost minotaur,” Storm said. Her white hair billowed around her as she directed a vicious gust at the thing-- the minotaur-- that was barrelling through her winds. “We can’t hit it!”
“Don't look so worried,” Tasha said, hating the tight, unhappy expression on his face. She popped the pills in her mouth and swallowed them down with the water, then turned to Steve with her most winning smile. “You know I'm just playing it all up to get you to pamper me.”
“Cold,” Steve gritted out. “Hands.”
Iron Man sighed, but didn’t argue, following instead with his right hand resuming its trail on the outer wall. “I’m starting to think Giant Girl might have been right,” he said. “We’re pretty clearly dealing with some kind of magic nut. This maze could be moving without us noticing, or spelled to lead us to a certain spot.”
“They’re going to be late, but they are gonna be here.” Steve sighed. “I should have been paying attention.”
And lo, the kitty appears.
As quickly as it came, the mist vanished; the shaking subsided. Straight ahead of them, a wall that had been solid was now a massive stone entryway with gruesome twisted lion faces carved on either side. The lion faces, of course, spoke.
Rogers huffed out a laugh. “Right,” he said, raising an eyebrow at Steve, and Steve felt his ears go pink.
Steve smiled. “What did you have in mind?”
Damn the stab wound, honestly. Natasha rolled over as gingerly as she could, gritting her teeth against the sharp flare of pain. It throbbed hotly even as she settled against Steve’s side, resting her head on his chest. His heartbeat thumped steadily under her ear.
The other Rogers backed away quickly. “I’m away,” he said defensively, and dropped the scepter on the floor. Slowly, his hands in the air, he kicked it towards Tony.
Tony shrugged. “Out of sight, out of mind.”
Purple mist exploded into the air around them, obscuring anything more than half a foot ahead of their noses. Jan lurched sideways, grabbing Ororo’s hand before she could lose track of her in the commotion.
“I’ll keep it back, you guys move,” Iron Man said. He was playing bullfighter in earnest now, goading the beast into attacking and dancing out the way just in time. It really didn’t like the repulsors, for some reason, although they didn’t seem to hurt it either.
But he’d let Tony put an arm around his neck and pull him in for a hug in the middle of the communal kitchen, where anyone could have walked in, and that was a rare enough display of (almost) public affection that Tony knew it was very, very far from fine.
Iron Man pointed. Steve looked up. Sure enough, about twenty feet down the path there was a low wooden threshold. The middle of the frame had a golden plaque on it, too far away for him to read.
Tony stares. “What?”
It takes off when someone passes them walking their dog, and that’s the end of Tony’s extended lunch break.
Janet stood up to get a refill of eggnog. At the same time, Socrates seemed to catch a whiff of something that upset him greatly and set out to make as great of a racket as he could; from him, this was a bark that sounded mostly like a particularly hoarse cough, but he did squirm so greatly in Pepper’s arms that she unbalanced and tipped over backwards. She was caught by Thor, who stepped forward smoothly to interrupt her backwards arc toward the floor. Pepper seemed far too dazed from being betwixt Thor’s biceps to right herself, so Thor tipped her upright with a gentle pat on the shoulder. Pepper turned pink and brushed imaginary dust off her sweater.
That had happened a little over half a year of them dating. Steve had been choking the words back himself, at that point — had been from their first date. He’d been so grateful she had been willing to give them a chance, and so worried he would scare her off if he went too fast.
“I can do that,” Tony said. “While I grab those, you’re in charge of cleaning music. Don’t disappoint me.”
“He did not.”
“Tony,” the other man corrected, shooting Steve a warning glance from under unfairly long eyelashes. Steve’s heart did something flighty in his chest, a feeling like arrhythmia— although of course he didn’t have to worry about that anymore.
Steve pretended to think about it. “The kids do keep telling me that I don’t have to boil everything I eat now.”
The wall quickly crumbled away under the force of the Hulk’s nausea, revealing a massive underground room. The room spun slowly to a halt.
Tony emerged from the hallway behind Steve to find Steve on the floor with a cackling Janet sprawled on top of him. “Hey, paws to yourself, van Dyne,” he said, nudging at the hand buried in the fur of Steve’s flank with his shoe.
“Mr. Stark!”
“There’s the Fourth Estate, and then there’s tabloid writers,” Steve grimaced. “I’m not sure they belong in the same category.”
“Where does Loki show up next? The fourteenth floor with me?”
“I don't want to make her jealous,” Steve said without thinking, staring out over the crowd to where Tasha was chatting with a wild-haired elderly man. “I want to make her happy.”
“Don’t,” he says quietly, tugging his hand away. He knows how he looks right now—all of him skinny and pale, his arms so thin that they’re mostly bone.
Hulk threw up.
Stupid, he doesn’t say, but he can taste its bitterness at the back of his throat.
When Steve was securely inextricable from Tony’s branches, he put out a few pale green buds of his own: pointed, tear-shaped things that were tightly closed. Tony couldn’t have been more excited if they were his own, and when Steve’s buds started to open next to his, Tony nearly burst with pride and pleasure.
“Yeah, come on. I'll trade you. Just tell me something.”
Being on his feet had Steve feeling a little more himself, although he still couldn’t quite feel warm. “Thanks for heating me up back there, Shellhead.”
Around them, the maze had faded into the air, illusion dissipating without its power source. The Mall of America was slowly reappearing, dazed shoppers wandering out of purple mist.
Steve obeys, and the soup feels so good on his sore throat. He hums a little and takes another sip. “This is good,” he says quietly, and drinks again.
“What is it?”
“All of it,” Natasha replies, standing, and dumps her cereal bowl in the sink. Steve cracks an egg.
“Hey,” Tony says lowly, pushing the door closed with his foot and approaching the bed. “How are you feeling?” He sets the bowl on the bedside table.
The sweater in question featured the torso of a snowman on the front; a chintzy red scarf came attached and the white of the snowman was made up of white sequins. Steve hadn’t worn any further adornments with it as a human, but in his wolf form, a black top hat was attached to his head with a little strap under his chin.
Logan snorted. Janet giggled. Cap had his face in his hand, but he was smiling into the red glove.
The elevator doors slid closed, and Steve pulled out his phone with the vague idea of texting Tony to see if he wanted to go out for breakfast. It was a second before he realized the elevator wasn’t moving.
“That would make it easier on me, wouldn’t it?” Tony says, mouth twisted.
Steve sighs, relaxing against Tony’s warmth, and time goes fuzzy around him as he slides into a warm doze.
Tony settled the ice pack on Steve’s swollen shoulder. Steve hissed a little at the feeling, at the bite of cold numbing the pain.
Tony passed the sketchbook over to Steve, and their fingers brushed. Tony’s hand was warm.
“You know, there’s a handful of artistically-inclined kids among the students,” Tony said, tapping at the sketchbook. “You could get some kind of group together, do something with that.”
“Why did you call in?” she asks, and there’s a shrewd glint in her eyes. She knows something’s up already. Well, Tony had known she would.
They eat lunch together in companionable quiet, watching joggers and birds. When the cat has licked the bowl clean, it licks its chops, yawns, and settles into Tony’s lap for a nap.
He was a coward. Why was it easier for him to jump off a skyscraper than it was to ask his best friend a simple question?
Just as Steve worried it was weird to joke about his trauma, Tony laughed.
Iron Man was quiet a little too long, and Janet’s smile dropped. “Iron Man?” she asked.
He was only slightly more helpful regarding dating in the 21st century than the online articles he’d warned Steve away from, but no one was perfect.
He can do it.
Steve stared into the open, gaping abyss in front of him. At the edges of his vision he saw… objects– strange, lost things, totally unidentifiable in the all-encompassing gloom. He wanted nothing more than to stay far away from it all, but the things forgotten in that murky place couldn’t be allowed to let lie.
Janet let out a sound so shrill with excitement that Steve’s ears went back in alarm. “Snowman! You’re a snowman,” she gasped, and ran to tackle him with a hug.
Steve blinked rapidly, his heart soaring.
“I’m calling Thor this time,” Iron Man said. “He has got to get ahold of this guy.”
Steve didn’t startle, but only because he’d heard the gentle shuffle of feet on a carpet beforehand.
sorry,” Steve said, and leaned in and kissed Tony sweetly. “Let me prove it to you.”
Here there is no north, west or east
Spider-Man cocked his head. “Janet says they are. Which, you know, but Storm says they are too.”
“It’s touching to see you so concerned, but I still can’t. Socrates doesn’t share well.”
“I’m gonna have to call the Director,” Sitwell insisted.
Steve nudged him. “Hey, this is a great idea. Okay? I bet if you asked the others for help we could have this done in no time.”
“Friday is good.”
She took his hand in hers, lifting it up to press a kiss to his knuckles. “The lingerie helped though.”
“I’ll see if I can get an ID on him from SHIELD, but the damn place was swarming,” Natasha scowled fiercely. “I can’t believe this — Pierce should never have intercepted the ongoing transport of two such volatile objects. There were civilians all over that lobby, police, private security. Anything could have happened — anything did happen.”
“She’d have liked you because I love you,” he said. His expression was distant, fond. “She’d have been happy I found someone so wonderful. And she would have really, enthusiastically gotten on with you.”
Everything came crashing down on him.
“There’s this stray cat I’ve been feeding on my lunch breaks. Really pretty, very sweet, entirely too demanding—you’d get along great,” Tony says hopefully.
Tony sighed. “At least this time–” he started, then cut off. “No, you know what? I know better. I’m not finishing that sentence.”
The human would pull him up when he refused to bloom. That was fine; maybe they would take a cutting from Tony first and the new rosebush would never know anything of heartbreak or death.
“I am
Steve restrained the urge to scowl. On the one hand, he hated being out of the loop. On the other, Iron Man had shown him so many bizarre, alarming, and outright disturbing things in the name of a cultural education that Steve was inclined to trust his word when he said something was too extreme.
“Any luck with the engines?” Steve asked over the sound of the storm outside.
“You have to get off of him for that,” Tony said.
Steve watched her slice through the crowd, all elegance and towering heels. Then he looked toward Tasha. She was gesticulating wildly as she spoke now, irritably brushing at the smoky dark curls some exorbitant stylist had deliberately left in her line of sight, and he felt a smile take over his lips. His heart beat crookedly in his chest.
“Indeed,” JARVIS confirms. Steve winces sympathetically.
“I don't know why you're so surprised,” Natasha said.
“Thank god,” Steve exhaled, dropping his hands.
Jan shrank down to her normal height. “Hold on a hot second,” she said. “Are you saying you two aren’t dating?”
“The North Pole,” Steve blurted. “The North Pole!”
“We’re not even six months into the year!”
Steve blinked at the kitchen. Every conceivable surface was covered in trays of cookies, and the smell of warm sugar was heavy and sweet in the air.
It’s not like Steve isn’t going to notice him getting sicker, eventually; he’ll see Tony’s meds or his symptoms and he’ll freak out and Tony can’t let him find out like that, he can’t, he has to tell him before that.
“Take care of yourself, Tony,” Rogers said quietly. “This is goodbye for us. For me, anyway.”
“How does
She jogged off in the opposite direction. As soon as she turned a corner, Steve heard a faint “Eep! Miles! Guess what?”
“Most people at least
“Don’t ask, Cap,” Iron Man said firmly. “And for the love of country don’t Google it either. For the record, G, I’m with you on this one. It gets too close to life in this business.”
“I see you have a companion, Sir,” JARVIS says as soon as Tony steps in the elevator. The cat’s ears prick.
Steve snorted. “You’re one to talk.”
“Haven’t had coffee,” Tony grumbles, and doesn’t have to fake the roughness of his voice.
Steve subsides. “Oh, well in that case,” he says, and leans into Tony’s side. Tony is
“I’ve got vision filters in my mask,” Iron Man said. “Can everybody else see all right?”
As Tony expected, the human began to frown at Tony as the days got longer and he still refused to bud. The human came round with the usual spring fertilizers and gave Tony an extra thorough look all over, but there was neither bug nor bacteria stymying his growth, and the human eventually sat back with a shrug.
The explosion rocked the room, and provided a brief, painful flash of warmth, but faded without any further effect on the wall.
She responded voraciously when he ducked his head to kiss her again, putting both hands on the back of his head and pulling him close and surging up against his mouth.
The elevator doors opened on Tony Stark pointing one of his gauntlets, charged, at Steve Rogers.
“He doesn’t want to marry me,” Tony blurts, and his voice breaks over the last syllable.
“Garbage bags,” Steve replied. “Lots of ‘em. Heavy duty. One for trash, one for recycling, one for donating.”
But he wants to not tell him for as long as he can.
Steve has shifted, his head tilted away from Tony now, but his breaths are still coming even and undisturbed. He’s asleep.
Three hours and twenty minutes later, the other Rogers held out his hand for Tony to shake it goodbye. Tony clasped it.
Tony goes all melty inside. “How do you not have a home?” he laments. “You are so good. You are such a good cat. Come on, let’s meet JARVIS.”
“Thanks. It’s kind of weird picking it back up after 90 years.”
“It’s fine,” Steve said. “My helmet caught the worst of it. We’re glad to see you, actually.”
If the doctor seemed at all skeptical, she didn’t show it. She gathered her supplies and left in the elevator, nodding as the doors closed.
It wheeled away at full speed, which was about 5 miles per hour. Nonetheless, Steve let it go. The sketchbook didn’t have much in it anyway, and he was almost done with this novel.
“It’s Spider-Man,” she told the group. “How are you holding up?”
‘Boring’ was not how Steve would have described the evening so far. ‘Emotionally agonizing.’ ‘Wracked with indecision,’ maybe.
Steve shrugs.
“Glory to god and peace on earth,” Steve said fervently, and dropped his flashlight (found balanced precariously on top of a sewing machine that had three belts wrapped around it but otherwise seemed perfectly serviceable– donate) to the ground with a heavy thunk.
“We Hulked through the floor,” he replied. “And then Hulk hulked his breakfast. Whoever built this thing sent us on a spinny ride.”
Distracted from Iron Man, the minotaur turned its attention to the other Avengers-- and began to charge.
“Ororo?” Jan squeezed her hand.
“Definitely not. I’d have noticed. Keep dreaming though, maybe next time. You’re vegetarian, right?”
“Yeah, I think he liked it,” Tony said, sitting in the armchair across from Steve’s. He peered down at the drawing. “I like it too. You’ve got a real eye for it.”
Steve shakes his head and slides the frying pan off the stove. He forks five pieces of bacon into a napkin for Natasha, then dumps the rest on his plate and slides into the seat across from her.
“It’s from before we were dating,” Steve said.
. Christ.
Steve frowns. “Are kids supposed to have NyQuil?” he asks.
“Iron Man--” Steve started, but Iron Man held up a finger to stop him. And triggered the manual releases under his helmet.
“I’ve got it,” he said, and three floating discs detached from his armor. They surrounded the infuriated minotaur, which shook its head at them as if they were flies.
Still.
“Fury’s been wanting me to pick up missions for SHIELD,” Steve said instead, turning to stare out the windows at the city below, buzzing with emergency workers and faintly smoking. “I guess I’ll take him up on that. Get back in the game.“
“You both think those two are screwing. For real,” Logan said dubiously.
“You know about Hydra already?” Rogers smiled. “I hope that’s my fault.”
“Figures even this one thing couldn’t go right for me,” Tony says, and then glances over at Steve to make sure he’s still asleep.
“Christ,” Tony said.
“Down it is. Giant Girl, if you wouldn’t mind?” Storm pointed at the floor, beckoning the others back.
SHIELD agents began to swarm the Mall, and Logan passed the Enigma off to them. “On that note,” he said, turning to Cap. “Maybe you two can settle something.”
Steve restrained a sigh. “I know you have,” he said. “I just mean, when did you fall
“Good morning, JARVIS,” Steve said. “My suite, please.”
“We’re approaching 200 feet,” Cap said. “Get ready.”
“There is more anomalous footage first, Captain,” JARVIS said. “The entity believed to be Loki intercepts the STRIKE team that was in possession of the scepter at the same time as the Loki downstairs comes into possession of the Tesseract. The footage is highly concerning for many reasons.”
“You’ve always got to be the center of attention, don't you?” Romanoff said, and to Steve’s surprise her voice sounded fond and amused.
She smiled. “I wouldn't worry about it.”
“I just love you,” Tony found himself saying again. “I really, really do.”
“Nah,” Tony replies. “I haven’t caught a cold in years—there’s too much alcohol in my system. All the germs get drunk and have to call their designated drivers.”
“Not just us,” Storm said. “Batroc sent a letter apologizing for trying to set you up when you were already in a relationship with, well. With Iron Man. He thought.”
“Android babies are not as messy as Peter,” Tony replies pointedly.
“Yeah?” Steve smiled, stroking a hand down Tony’s back.
Cap gave her an exceptionally dry look. “What, through a wall?”
Well. Tony thinks he does.
“No going back now,” Iron Man said grimly.
“Tony?” Rhodey asks, concerned now. “Are you alright?“
“It’s pretty sweet,” he admits.  “Let me guess—“
“Steve,” Natasha said. “I— that's what I meant. I've been in love with you since, oh, I don't know. Maybe a month after we met.”
Nor weather fit for man nor beast
“No!” Iron Man’s hands flew up in denial. “No way. Definitely not.”
“My mom,” she said, thinking. “My mom, she held garden parties. She played the piano. She dressed me up in adorable outfits that I completely ruined. Dad loved her, but he wasn't very good at it.”
“No, no. Hulk saved me.” Stark patted Banner’s shin.
Steve squeezed her hand. “I do.”
Steve nosed against her cheek, making a shushing sound. His free hand was now buried in the hair on the other side of her head, twining gently.
“How long have you been at this?” Steve asked, mixing together grey icing for Thor’s hammer.
Oh. Yeah.
Natasha grinned. “That's right, isn't it? Hey, tell me about her.”
The cat doesn’t show. Maybe it was just passing through the area? Tony stifles his disappointment with a big bite out of his wrap.
Steve sits up just long enough to put the soup back on the bedside table, and then curls into Tony’s side again, wrapping an arm around his waist.
Steve’s eyelids fluttered and his brow furrowed, and he sighed again, a long exhale, and opened his eyes.
“I wouldn’t be surprised,” Steve said, and sat down across from Tony with his own sandwich. “Say, I was thinking-- would you like to get dinner with me sometime?”
“Don’t get prone to overstatement on me now, buddy,” Tony said.
“That could take forever!”
“My mom would want me to be happy,” she murmured. “I think she was afraid I would end up like her, too.”
Tony was silent for a few seconds. He cleared his throat. “How’s your shoulder?” he asked.
“Are you alright, Giant Girl?” Storm asked, landing gently.
Rhodey pauses. “But that just sounds like … he hasn’t thought about it, right? Maybe he—“
“We’re here?” Steve asks, and Tony turns off the car. The sudden silence is jarring.
“You really want to drag me into this, huh,” Bruce groaned. “Did you miss all the times the U.S. Government has sent tanks after me?”
…God, why doesn’t Steve want to marry him? What has he been doing wrong? He thinks… he supposes it’s been going well. They love each other. Steve loves him.
Realization dawned. “You said Hail Hydra on the elevator,” Steve said. “You knew Hydra was in SHIELD—”
plenty of nitrogen, alfalfa meal and epsom salts; and the compost was homemade and all-natural, naturally. And the result was Tony. He was the brightest and bushiest rose in the garden. Every flower he made was exquisite, deep red; every petal was velvety soft and perfectly curled.
Pepper.
Storm smiled sheepishly. “Sorry, Captain.”
Steve gulped.
“I’ll be the judge of that, I think. Not that it’s not entirely possible,” Rhodey adds, and Tony can hear him grinning, "but you’re not exactly an objective source.”
The other Rogers rolled his eyes. “I’m not Loki.”
“That doesn’t count.”
Steve joined him with the blankets, kicking off his muddy boots. He was pretty sure they were red, once. “If we had some hot cocoa, this wouldn’t be so bad,” he said, tucking a blanket over the both of them.
Steve laughed.
“Stark isn’t the kind of guy you want to get romantically involved with, Steve.”
He feels the shift as Tony turns his head, and then Tony’s lips press against Steve’s skin, soft, just for a second. “Goodnight,” Tony whispers back.
He tenses immediately.
Tony catches his hand, running his thumb over the bony knuckles, and Steve’s mood sours very quickly.
“Oh, stop grinning at me, you smug bastard.”
“Thank you for coming with me,” Tasha said, snagging his arm and leading him towards the bar. “I know it's very boring, but it does help me to have you here.”
Mr. Stark—
Tony leaned into him. “Steve. Look, we have so few days off. You really want to spend the day cleaning a closet?”
Tony laughed, muffled, into the blanket he was using to dry his hair. “That’s one way to put it, I suppose. My poor armor.”
“Uh oh,” Rhodey says. “Is Captain America mad at you again?”
Steve is more bothered by that than he lets on.
The Quinjet’s holoprojector slid down from the ceiling, whirring to life as a video recording started to play on the hard light surface: a team of SHIELD agents struggling in the grips of writhing purple tentacles, their guns littering the floor.
“With me?” Natasha repeated, eyebrows raised.
“BARTON!” Sam roared, and shot after him.
“Yes. God, I thought Hulk was chugging that stuff or something.”
To the right of the bottle is a ring box. Black velvet. The container’s not really important, but Tony knows if he looks at the actual damn ring he’s going to end this night by getting trashed and melting the damn thing down into slag.
“Awkward,” Tony said. He cleared his throat. “What happened? Does this have anything to do with Hydra?”
“Tony, what are you talking about?”
She hadn't, but Frank had sure gotten a kick out of watching her politely but awkwardly turn down the three daisies Steve had gotten for her.
He squinted. There was a close-up image of the Iron Man armor’s very flat abdomen, with the words BABY BUMP in bold white letters.
He leaves it there, taking several long strides to the trash can, and fishes the ring box out. He drops it onto a worktable.
are you?” Steve asks again, demands this time. He turns to face Tony and his eyes are wet, his face is wretched and pale and wrecked. “What did you mean by
The bot beeped profusely. Steve thought it sounded excited.
Steve is very nearly asleep when Tony speaks again. “It was a nice cat,” he murmurs, and Steve drifts into sleep.
Whatever the wall was made of, it came down easily enough under Logan’s claws, magic or no. On the other side there was a domed room.
“Okay, okay, right,” Iron Man babbled, and lurched over to pull Steve close to him, supporting his weight. “Here there is no north, west, or east, nor weather fit for man nor beast. No north, west or east, and the weather sucks, which we’ve noticed. One of the uninhabitable planets in our solar system? Neptune or Pluto, maybe-- Jupiter has the worst storms--”
“Oh! Hold on,” he said. Something clicked in the armor, and it began to radiate blissfully painful heat. “Let’s get you out of here, big guy.”
She smirks at him, a milk mustache on her upper lip, and Steve rolls his eyes.
His ears burn as Steve shifts beside him, no doubt disturbed by Tony trying to go off-road. He’ll say he fell asleep at the wheel, it was late, he was tired, Steve will believe that—Steve will get worried by that, Steve will probably insist that he take over driving, which isn’t happening, but what is Tony supposed to say?
Tony’s eyebrows shot up. “Ooh, plot twist. Bye now.” His fingers wiggled inside the gauntlet, a wave and a threat.
“Do you guys want me to sit this one out?” Bruce asked, squinting up at the massive dark entrance of the labyrinth.
Steve sighed, his hand sliding over her stomach, and made the grumbly little in-his-throat sound that meant he was about to wake up. Tasha turned her head to watch it happen, her lips quirking.
And then his Spidey senses went off.
“My sketchbook?”
The Black Widow—Natasha—worked with Steve a lot on the physical part of the program. She’d happily let Steve take over the “boot camp” side of things, where he drilled them on runs, lifts, and stretches until they could comport themselves without disgrace when Natasha began training them in hand-to-hand. The older kids worked with her with blunted weapons as well—as did sweet Nadia, who was apparently a graduate of the same program that created Natasha. He’d heard her refer to Natasha as the Red Room’s “most famous alumna” just before Natasha swiped her legs out from under her.
“Romanoff, if you’re drinking out of the milk carton when I turn around—“
“It’s moving,” Storm said, with a tone like she wanted to say a bad word instead.
“At least I got to see Giant Girl’s giant jugs,” the punk sneered, leering at a ten-foot-tall Jan.
“Just one,” Iron Man said, swooping around a corner. “Cap, toss your shield-- see how this thing reacts to vibranium.”
“No,” Tony says, staring blankly at the floor. “No, not really.”
“You didn’t hear the way he said no,” Tony says, and it’s hard, it’s hard to talk around this hollow gaping thing in his throat. “He, uh. He really meant it.”
“I don’t want your kisses, you motorcycle-wrecking menace,” Tony grumbled, but his shoulders released some of their tension. Steve kissed him again, licking teasingly at his lips, and Tony sighed.
“Applied? Oh no,” said Kate, Hawkeye’s protegé. “I told Barton he could take the name back if he wanted, but the bow was mine and I intended to use it. He said if I came here I could learn to fight from the Black Widow. I’d be dumb to turn that down, and I’m not.”
“Definitely always. Ultron, Loki, Morgan le Fay, that second thing with Loki… whatever the heck your ‘Paris adventure’ was.” Giant Girl counted off on her fingers. “I mean, Paris. How was anyone supposed to think that wasn’t romantic?”
“Definitely,” Steve said. “Banner only has to come upstairs, but Nat and Clint are at least a couple hours out. Thor will probably fly from New Mexico.”
He assembled Tony’s sandwich first, using the turkey Jarvis had picked up from a deli. “Tomato and mayonnaise, but no mustard, right?” he asked.
time,” Tony scowled, pinching the bridge of his nose. “What about—”
Dummy probably brought the blanket over to the couch. The blanket is kept in the corner of the workshop, from previous times when Tony’s fallen asleep down here. It’s completely plausible that Dummy might have dragged the blanket over to the couch.
It’s Tony. He has a blanket draped over one arm, a bowl of something steaming, and several bottles of things that probably taste nasty.
Natasha turned her head just enough to kiss whatever part of him was closest to her mouth. “She loved you.”
Steve moves a little so that he can kiss Tony’s jaw, feeling the faintest rasp of stubble against his lips. Tony sighs a little, but he hasn’t— he’s still so tense, he hasn’t relaxed at all in Steve’s embrace, and that, honestly, stings.
On his left, Tony could not have appeared less interested. He was tapping away on his phone with a distant little frown, not sparing a glance for either Steve or the doctor.
But no sooner had his hand touched the door than it flew open off its hinges, an irate Hulk bursting through roaring about the stairs. The man took the Hulk-force door to the face and the suitcase went flying, the Cube scattering across the floor to land squarely at the feet of the worst possible person.
The arm nodded.
JARVIS, as it happened, was perhaps the most helpful technology Steve had been introduced to in this century. And they had literally been introduced, formally, the third or so time the AI contributed to Stark’s conversations with the rest of the team.
They both stared at the closet.
“Well, thanks. Thanks for thanking us. You guys hungry? We had a good workout,” Stark said. “If you’re up for shawarma I’ll order in.”
“Eurgh,” Janet wrinkled her nose. “I don’t understand how anyone could choose that over a nice, virtual spa day.”
Iron Man’s sonic assault went off as a wavering, high-pitched screeching tone, blisteringly loud to Steve’s enhanced ears. He covered them as the ghost minotaur went down, crashing in a way that somehow managed to shake the ground. The minotaur thrashed, its bull ears pressed flat against its skull.
Steve had his jeans undone and down around his ankles in record time, his boxers soon joining them. His cock stood proud and erect, already leaking precome. Tony sat up slowly, licking his own palm before taking Steve in his hand. Steve whined in the back of his throat as Tony worked him, slicking him up ready to take him in.
He felt more than heard Tony’s sharp intake of breath as Steve’s fingers dipped lower, just into the line of his jeans and he couldn’t help but smile, rewarding Tony with a further slip of his hand into the material.
He sighed again, hands delving into Rhodes’ suit pockets, “I am sorry.” Steve muttered as his fingers pulled out a keyring of keys. Steve found the one he was looking for easily, it was the smallest of the bunch and managed to unlock his cuffs. His wrists were sore as he rubbed them, letting the keys and cuffs fall at Rhodes’ feet as Steve got back up again.
His gut was nothing but heat and desire, his brain foggy to anything feel but the way Steve made him feel, “Not yet.” Tony told him, pulling back with his hands on Steve’s chest, “Still my show.”
Steve nodded, fingers trailing over Tony’s cheek, “There’s just one.”
Steve simply ignored him, “Immunity for the team. My file and any copies you made erased from the record. Your smart, Fury. I doubt anyone else would have figured it out but smart doesn’t mean invincible and I need you to understand if you tell anyone who I am then I’ll have to kill you and them and it will just be a bloody messy business so I’d rather avoid that outcome if we can.”
“You’re the monster, not him.” Tony uttered between them, seeing the glint in Ross’ eyes. He was enjoying this. The pain it brought Tony, the fear. The power. Ross was coming alive with every threat he threw Tony’s way.
Their lips joined together again in a filthy kiss, mouths battled teasingly and when Tony moaned because Steve had brushed his fingers over the head of Tony’s cock, he tasted it on his own tongue.
He rounded another corner, coming face to face with three more guys. He grimaced, eyeing them carefully. The heavy guns across their shoulders caught his eye.
“He won’t be much of a genius without his marbles, right? Do you think it would work? Does he care for you enough that losing you will end him?” Rumlow asked.
Steve would make sure of it.
“No, it’s okay.” He took a breath, “I just don’t like thinking about it. Howard wasn’t a stellar father, when he drank, he got angry. My mom passed away and it got worse. I got too old to hide from him.”
Tony didn’t respond with an answer, his stomach was a ball of nerves as he crossed the street and make his way up the steps to Steve’s front door. He steeled himself before opening it, knowing they would have left it unlocked for his and Bucky’s arrival.
Instead, he let Steve leave him with a downright sinful kiss on the doorstep that left Tony a little dazed and staring after his mob boss as Steve headed towards his car. Realising how lovesick that made him look Tony scrubbed a hand over his face, slamming the front door for good measure. He needed to get to the garage and put in some hours but first he needed coffee and thanks to Natasha he could already smell it brewing from the kitchen.
Steve remembered. When he met Fury at the docks, he had told him to swing by the house to collect the paperwork he promised to have signed by tonight. The paperwork that still sat on the kitchen table untouched.
“I know, sweetheart. I know. It’s okay. He can’t hurt you anymore.” Steve promised, “We need to clean this up though, okay?”
They climbed the winding dark wood stairs together, heading for the top of the house. The mansion itself was one of the older Brooklyn estates, built in the 1800s and left to fall into disarray over the years. It was one of the first things Steve had brought after becoming the leader of The Avengers and had fixed it up himself along with the help of the rest of the gang in order to allow it to become both a home and a base of operations. Phillips, who had ran the gang before Steve and who had taken Steve to be his right hand in all gang related matters, had operated out of a warehouse near the docks. Steve still owned it but now it served as a cargo hold. Phillips had made The Avengers a gang and given them a reputation but Steve had made them a family.
Bruce shuffled from one foot to the other, “You know who he is, you really want me to answer that?”
Tony went willingly, hands curling around Steve’s neck. Steve kissed him again, softly and sweetly. They needed a shower; He could feel the mess he’d made of Tony’s thighs on his arm and the stickiness of their skin wasn’t helping.
Steve didn’t move to take it, instead his eyes met Tony’s, “This is too risky, you shouldn’t be involved in this. I’ll kill Nat the next time I see her.”
“Where’s Steve?” Tony asked when the silence stretch on between them.
“You’re still trouble, Rogers.”
The kitchen was cleaner than the living room, clearly it wasn’t used as much. A few coffee mugs on the sides but mostly it was a clean space with white cupboards and black granite worktops. The light from the window filtered in nicely and Steve found himself imagining Tony stumbling in there in the mornings to make his coffee before work, probably squinting because the sun was too bright, but he hadn’t gotten around to putting up blinds in there yet.
It seemed like Tony wanted to smile, mouth quirking a little at Steve’s logic, but it didn’t make it onto his face, “He threatened us. He said he was going to lock you away; make you suffer and then get you the death penalty. He said he was going to come for us. Natasha, Thor, Bucky, everyone. He said he’d save me for last so I’d always live in fear of the day he finally came for me.”
Somehow Steve didn’t think killing this new guy would be as easy as killing Sitwell. That thought alone had him clenching his jaw and balling his hands into fists from inside his pockets.
Hydra would be done before the night was out and Thor gleefully allowed himself a moment of triumph. He couldn’t help Loki when he needed him, he couldn’t protect his brother from the mess he had fallen into thinking he was clever enough to play both sides, but he could do this.
Steve went willingly, the sharp tug on his scalp going straight to his cock as Tony thrust against his throat again and Steve held his tongue flat against Tony’s cock. Tony was moaning, moving constantly as he climbed higher into his orgasm, Steve’s strong arms encasing him on either side as he squeezed Tony’s ass and hummed against him every so often to add a new sensation to the mix. Tony loved it, cock jerking and legs squeezing around Steve’s head as he threatened to come.
Bucky sighed through the phone, “You’re really gone for this one, aren’t you?”
Steve looked down, his hands covered in Bucky’s blood, “You and Sam have everything you need? Clint can stay with you, run out to fetch whatever you don’t have.”
Steve’s eyes were on Bruce, “Can you do it here?”
Tony wasn’t about to let that happen either. Steve wasn’t dying because he had been an idiot.
Tony shifted, rubbing his cock against Steve’s and feeling it harden beneath him, “You’re doing just fine.”
Steve felt himself bristle at Bucky’s tone, the anger was shallow but there was something behind it that wasn’t, “You want to talk to me? Or do we need to head to the basement to spar it out?”
“Same as you, right?”
Sometimes Steve really hated having to call T’Challa for help. Not that he wasn’t helpful because he was but Steve hated having to rely on T’Challa to get information he couldn’t get himself. He’d been on hold for a few minutes before T’Challa had picked up and had almost blanched when Steve told him what he needed.
He watched Peter scoop the cat up and take him towards the office happily and couldn’t help the smile that crossed his face. He was a damn push over with that kid but honestly without Peter he wasn’t sure he would have got this business off the ground.
Bucky nodded, “We’re all cut from the same cloth to them.”
Natasha’s door was open so she clearly didn’t want privacy and Steve stopped short when he passed her doorframe, leaning against the wood because he didn’t want to intrude. Her room always looked so homely to Steve, bright cream with a purple bedspread. The window was open despite the winter weather and the wind caused the papers she had clipped to the wall to flutter gently. They were newspaper articles she found interesting, a few photos of their team. Steve’s favourite was the one taken last Christmas. Thor had tried to bake a cake and in the photo he held it proudly whilst the rest of them ignored the camera, digging straight in with their forks. There was also a pair of ballet tickets, ones Steve had gotten her for her birthday a few years ago. They had gone together despite Steve knowing nothing about Swan Lake or the ballet. Natasha’s face had been worth it though, eyes lighting up like a kid meeting Santa.
“So, you’re one of them now?” Howard asked, cocked his head in Bucky’s direction.
Tony nodded and Steve could feel his eyes on his ass as he climbed the stairs to the main house. He almost threw a glance at Tony over his shoulder but held back. He wasn’t a goddamn teenager anymore.
Tony seemed to realise he wanted that as well and grabbed Steve’s hand to let him haul him back to his feet. Steve saw Tony look down at the mess of his boxers and smirk up at him. It was such a dirty look that heat pooled into Steve’s gut and he couldn’t resist drawing Tony back to him for a kiss that was sloppy and sinful. Tongues teased each other in Tony’s mouth and Steve felt him bite at his lower lip, dragging it with him when Steve tried to break the kiss before letting it go. Steve was sure his lip would look redder and plumper than usual tomorrow, but he didn’t care.
His cheeks were red with exertion and his chest heaved, “It’s not meant to be like this. None of it. When I built this gang, this family. I promised them I would protect them; I would stand in between them and whoever wanted to hurt them. I’m failing and they all see it.”
Steve would fight with him till the ends of the earth if that’s what it took. Ross wasn’t going to win this one, not now, not ever.
They couldn’t be following him otherwise Rumlow would have figured out who he was by now and he would have made his move.
The locker room wasn’t anything fancy, grey lockers with names lined up against the wall with a bench in the middle for changing. There were no cameras in here at least so Steve had a little time. He noticed one locker in the corner, a dent in the metal of the door and the word ‘Fury’ scribbled on the name tag. Steve smiled to himself as he made his way over to the locker. Well, he did need clothes and Fury was probably as close in size to him as he was going to get.
There was a shout of pain and Tony managed to use his shock to his advantage as he wrestled himself free of his attacker, umbrella tight in his grip.
Tony waved, “Tony.”
“You do now.” Steve said, “I would kill anyone who dared to hurt you, Tony.”
Tony’s place was rustic, and Steve took the time to really take it in as he got back into last night’s clothes. The condo was on the top floor of Tony’s apartment building and was very open plan. Steve wondered if the contractors had run out of money before finishing it because the only walls in the whole place where the ones that blocked off the bathroom from the rest of the house. Tony’s bedroom was at one end, blocked off by two massive bookcases that acted as room partitions to the rest of the condo. The floors were dark wood, and Tony had made the space his own by sticking pictures and newspaper articles to the wall by the window. The bookcases were stacked full as well, Steve spotted books on mechanics and engineering as well as some that were clearly fiction books. He wanted to scan the titles for any he knew but he didn’t want Tony to feel like he was snooping in his space.
Peter, Rhodey, and Pepper are just getting out of the car when he and Steve emerge from their quaint little abode, hand-in-metal-hand.
They’d gathered back those stupid fucking stones, Bruce had snapped those big green fingers, and they were there. The world was coming alive with faces Tony had never seen but knew from the reactions of those around them that they weren’t ever expected to be seen again.
“Because if you’re lying… This is it, you’re my. You’re gonna be my only hope, Steve, because I love you and if you don’t mean that you love me then. Then when I find out I’m gonna—“
And between the hot, heavy, cold and light, he can’t feel much else but relief as he slips toward unconsciousness, even as the whole room around him devolves into chaos.
And for a blissful moment, he’s too heavy and warm to think about Steve.
“How in the everlasting fuck… Did we— did we ever think that ever even mattered, Steve?”
“How?” Steve demands in response. He knows he should wait; should take a breath and pull it together, but Tony’s dead and he just can’t. “It’s not like we ever told him! He saved all of our asses a million times over—“ he has to stop, release the choked sob crawling it’s way up his breathless lungs. “He saved all of our lives, and we didn’t even say thank you— did we?”
“Make him breathe,” Steve gets out, choking up what feels like water, blood, snow, snot, and electric wire. “Please… he needs to breathe…”
Oh shit, he thinks.
Steve feels concern— the first thing he’s felt that wasn’t grief in days— for the man. Wonders for the first time why the Avengers didn’t want to look for a body. Wonders where Tony has been.
Again.
That’s why he needed Peter Parker. He was the opposite. He was new life and light.
There’s a somber silence at that. Because they didn’t. They’d nod a little, say “this’ll work” when he built them a new invention that’d be the only reason they didn’t get killed in a mission next week, and dump their shit on his desk when they needed it fixed.
And it’s also starting to drive Tony crazy.
“I’m sorry, Howard,” she apologized, sounding wobbly but sincere.
“Tony,” Steve chokes. “Tony—“
Rushing to finish deactivating a delicate explosive is rarely, if ever, a good plan. But Tony could say without a doubt in his mind that he was the most desperate he’d ever been, and he finished in a fury as a result.
They’re just missing the person who made them feel that way.
A dying man who loved each and every person around him at the moment.
Peter.
But when Steve bites his lip a little too hard and Tony gives an involuntary hiss, Steve summons the strength to pull back— still breathing hard.
Steve. Not Captain America.
Stark.
But Tony doesn’t want him to speak now. So he won’t. He’ll do what he’s asked.
Steve laughs, the sound soft and kind. “Me, too.”
It takes a moment for him to find his tongue.
Tony wouldn’t have blamed Pepper if she decided to leave. He was a mess, maybe even worse than after his parents died, and though he tried his best to avoid it, he still dragged everyone through the mud with him. Pepper’s immaculate hands were getting dirty.
“Don’t be a baby,” Nat chides, and then there’s an awful, sharp pain crawling up his elbow into his veins. He goes to yelp, but realizes with a shock— he can’t. The sound is too heavy, like the rest of his body. So, so heavy. And cold. So heavy and cold it feels like it’s gonna sink through the floor, and his eyes start shutting involuntarily against it. He feels one of Natasha’s hands wind up in his hair (God, have her hands always been so warm?), twisting it to the side followed by the sensation of her fingers on the side of his neck. Held there for a moment. Evidently satisfied, she calls, “Little help, guys?”
So Steve just does an act of kindness and says, “I’m alright.”
It was impossible, and it came with side effects (namely a homicidal Titan and his unfortunately large army.) But they’d done it anyway.
“You will be,” was his answer.
Their smiles get even bigger when they see each other.
Maybe if he hurried back in, said the right things, held Tony in the tenderest of arms, kissed him slow and soft, steady, not too strong, it could work out and they could—
“We’re staying,” Clint speaks up. He doesn’t look away from the window, though if the tense posture of his body is anything to go by, he means it.
And Steve loves Tony like he’s never loved anyone his whole life long. But it’s not enough to keep him here— it’s just not.
“Pep,” he tried to whisper, but his lips were far away. His whole body was far away, and drifting farther each moment. “Pep, I…”
What the fuck does JARVIS mean he couldn’t breathe what does I’m sorry mean when Tony is breathing Steve can hear it he swears he can he can he can he has to be because
Steve will never ask for anything ever again because Tony is alive. Breathing.
Steve turns to look at him, hoping he can convey how dumb that fucking question was through facial expression alone, but stops short when he sees just how deep the sadness is etched into the doctor’s face. Dark, bruise-like shadows fall under red-rimmed eyes; bitten lips pursed into a tight line on the verge of quivering.
Steve doesn’t have to look behind him (though he does, because it’s a fantastic view) to know Ass Clown doesn’t have a right hand anymore.
And when he comes out, thinking of his daughter, sees Pepper, Rhodey, Peter. Steve.
Now, he was fighting to keep what he had. Not avenge what he lost.
The few times that Tony talked to his father were the worst.
Jesus, the things that people will believe as long as you’re feeding their ego along the way.
No one’s quite sure how he survived. They took him to the hospital to pronounce him dead, but his heart started beeping before they could zip the body bag. Doctors say it was a miracle.
So Steve draws back, apology already on the tip of his tongue when he reads Tony’s shell shocked face.
“Isn’t this workshop technically in a basement?” Clint thankfully pipes up before Tony can spiral completely out of control, voice muffled by the couch cushions where he’s laying.
He hears Natasha affirm his judgement from somewhere to his right: “That’s literally the least funny thing I have ever heard you say.”
“Tony, we lost you.” Steve looks into Tony’s big, aching eyes. Feels a rush of affection so strong it hurts. “I lost you.”
When Jarvis came back in to check on him a few minutes later (coming up to tuck the blankets even tighter, pressing a gentle kiss to his forehead, said “Goodnight, Master Anthony. Sleep well.”) Tony feigned sleep because he didn’t know what to do knowing someone loved him enough to risk their whole livelihood for him.
“We had to restrain you,” Tony interrupts, still staring at Steve with that vacant expression that Steve’s seen on the corpse of every open-casket funeral he’s been to. “So don’t be scared.”
The last thing he remembered thinking, before he pulled open the door and saw their somber faces and just knew, was about how he hoped his breath didn’t reek.
Steve left in a hurry, before he even gave himself the chance to give into temptation to change his mind (think maybe it could work, maybe they’d find a way around the fact that he’s essentially a glorified, fully loaded weapon), scurrying off like the frantic, wounded animal he was. Didn’t find enough courage in his sick, heaving heart to so much as look at Tony while he choked on a bullshit goodbye. He just booked it the hell out of there.
So Steve musters the impossible strength (ignoring the irony that this must be his weakest point) to look up at him. At the light, one last time.
He remembered looking into those starry blue eyes that held a new andromeda in them, turned into black holes threatening to pull Tony towards his demise.
“I bid you farewell, then.” He hears the demigod exit the room, quietly humming the same Asgardian song of victory he does after every successful battle. Steve can’t help smiling beside himself. It’s endearing is all, even if he’s gonna be hurting for a few hours.
“Perhaps a rematch soon then, Captain? When you have recovered your strength?” Thor asks, obviously eager and pleased with himself for having won without even using any of his supernatural abilities.
“I saw the way you looked at him downstairs. That wasn’t The Captain. That was Steve Rogers. It was the same look you used to have whenever Peggy walked down the block when we were kids.”
The guy gritted his teeth, clearly in pain. The blood from his shoulder was steadily trickling down his arm and his leg was pooling blood into the floor. Steve wasn’t even sure he heard the question above the absorbing pain radiating from his body.
Like maybe make a promise he might not be able to keep.
And that makes no fucking sense to Steve. He pulls back then, still keeping Tony’s shoulders tight between both his hands like the mechanic might fall through them if he lets up. Reading his face doesn’t clarify anything; all Steve sees is the same nonsensical sadness mingling with the fresh injuries across his jaw and temple.
He remembered looking up at Steve.
“Tony?” Steve asked, raising his perfect eyebrows.
The sobs wrack him in earnest; ripping up through his aching chest and out his stupid mouth that’s never gonna get to kiss Tony goodnight, never gonna get to say he’s sorry, never gonna tell him that sometimes when he watches Tony work, he thinks for the first time since coming out of the ice— he’s gonna be okay. Because Tony is dead. He’s dead.
—————
“Yeah, Pep?” he said once he finally gotten the handle on the sniffles. Jesus, if she wasn’t one of his very closest friends, he might be making a beeline for the window out of mortal shame right about then. Still considered it.
“JARVIS?” Tony had asked, slumping onto his desk where he could comfortably thunk his head against the edge.
But here
—————————-
“Sir, need I repeat myself?” JARVIS’ voice abruptly stirs him from his thoughts. Tony startles, wondering how long he’s been wallowing in self-pity instead of dealing with the potentially very dangerous task at hand. “You haven’t reacted to my assessment of the situation, though I delivered it fifty-four seconds prior. Perhaps the concussion is more severe than my scanners have detected. I’ll call for medical immedia—“
Not if he wanted to see Steve again. (Who’s he kidding? Home doesn’t mean shit if Steve’s not there.)
“And I seem to find the happiness I seek,” Tony continued, reveling in the feeling of Steve’s strong arms dipping them low. Knowing what that did to Tony (God, wasn’t he entitled to hourly reminders of just how buff his boyfriend was), hearing the audible little gasp he did at the move, Steve grinned. Cheeky bastard.
Pepper and Rhodey embrace them as they arrive on the porch, hugging one another close.
“You’re alright, bud,” Tony said, trying to keep the shake out of his voice from the leftover adrenaline and just failing. “You’re fine, we’re fine, I promise. We’re almost home. Almost home, just hold on, okay?”
It’s Tony’s turn to look confused then. The genius tilts his head, shakes it a little which ruffles his hair (that would have bounced with the movement if it wasn’t matted to his head with sweat, and— blood?)
——————
His friend’s face flickered with comprehension. Like he could make sense of it, even though Tony couldn’t. Sympathy spread across his features, too, but Tony couldn’t make sense of that really either.
In retrospect, he felt a little like he built Peter his own death trap.
i’ll update soon!!💕💕
And Tony just rolls his eyes, kisses him quick (for no other reason than just loving him) and pulls them inside.
“Traitor!” Tony snarls, still unsuccessfully attempting to worm out from beneath his friend’s hold.
See, you’d think after nearly a hundred years, Steve would have a grip on the whole “being as strong as twenty regular men” thing. He doesn’t. And he doesn’t mean to sound ungrateful about it--- of course, the power comes with advantages. It’s what allows him to lift fallen debris in the heat of battle, beat the living shit out of all the Neo-Nazi he sees with just a few hits, and save just about everyone who needs saving. In those ways, it’s truly a wonderful burden to bear, and he wouldn’t change a thing.
“Yeah, yeah, sure,” Tony says, dismissive. He doesn’t want to admit he’s got a migraine like a bitch because then they’ll want him in bed rest for way, way too long. “I’m all better, Doc.”
Like he doesn’t know Steve is in love with him.
Poor Steve. Poor stupid, weak, pathetic, choking-on-his-own-spit-and blood-Steve.
They’d done it.
Maybe it’s because Howard didn’t set the best example; spending damn near every minute in his office. Or maybe it’s because Tony doesn’t know who he is without his work. Or maybe it doesn’t matter at all why he can’t seem to just give it a goddamn rest (which is what he’s tried to tell the many, many unsatisfied therapists he’s had over the years.)
And didn’t he fucking know that? Didn’t he know how he wanted to earn a little domesticity for himself some day?
