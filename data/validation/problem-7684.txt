"Did you forget that you are half an Irish?" Steve teased the boy a little causing the boy stopped in his place; eyes widen at that and his little mouth to fall in shock. "Yup, baby, I am Irish." Steve said causing the boy's eyes to widen more than they already were, causing Steve to smile happily at the change of topic. "So the right count is that you are half an Irish, quarter Italian, and quarter American." Steve said which made Peter blink at that a little like he couldn't believe it.
"James!" A voice called out causing Steven and James to turn in the direction of the caller, only to see Petrus run toward them, panting as he reached them while pouting a storm at his son. "Where were you?" Petrus asked his cheeks buffed with how angry he is. "You promised you would come and see the bear with me, but you disappeared as soon as we reached the village square." This time it was a whine as Petrus gazed at James with wide shiny eyes.
It hurt, it hurt so much; it hurt to breathe, it hurt to move, it hurt to even think. It hurt, and Steve wanted to cry. Steve wants to cry and sob and curl on himself until the pain goes away, but he can't, can't, can't! Not only because it hurt to move, but also because everyone needs him to stay strong. Everyone was breaking down in front of him, Tony, Bucky, May and her husband, the Barnes clan, even his goddammit doctor. Steve doesn't want that, he doesn't want that, he never wanted to be the reason to break his precious people's hearts, but it seems that he did exactly what he promised not to do.
"Yes? Your point is?" Tony snapped as he walked toward the fridge, grumbling when he got a frozen yogurt out. He needed to do a bit of grocery shopping, but then that meant risking to leave his lab, and Tony wasn't a fool to order his food like he used to, especially when he heard all of his teammates were planning his death after that night Rogers asked him out. And eating poisoned food was the worst way to go, even if it wasn't the first time that Tony had eaten poisoned food, still it was the principle of the thing!
"It's mine…" Tony said, trying not to make himself smaller than he already was at the blank stare he was at the end of, he already felt like a failure for breaking his promise to Steven, he doesn't need any reminder of how much of a failure he was.
In and out, Tony took a few more breaths to calm down, leaning on Steve's chest and taking his mate's scent further helping his fried nerves to calm. "Thank you," Tony whispered pulling out of Steve's embrace to kiss his cheek, smiling a little as Steve's beard tickled his lips, chuckling softly when Steve nuzzled his cheeks before taking Tony's lips in a kiss, silencing his chuckles.
Dr. Cho paused as she saw the nervousness on the Omega's face when his eyes fell on his tummy, she contains her sigh, where was his Alpha? Didn't the Alpha know that the first appointment was always important for the Omegas and they need their Alphas support? She wondered if the Alpha knew how the poor Omega was a step away from an anxiety attack. "Well, Mr. Stark considering that you are twelve weeks, would you like us to do an ultrasound? To check in on the baby," The doctor said; trying to cheer the Omega and take his mind off the dark thoughts he seems to head to, her words caused the Omega to look around in embarrassment and nod his head shyly. Dr. Cho smiled at that happily, probably thinking that he was adorable or something, because if one thing was known all of his friends told him that he looked adorable when he blush. The doctor leads Steve to the machine in the corner of the room, and Steve sat on the chair and raised his shirt making the woman hum. "Now, this is going to feel cold." She said making Steve jump a little as he felt something sticky and cold on his tummy, he gave the doctor a nasty look which caused the Beta to chuckled softly. It was a few seconds later that he was able to hear the sound of a heartbeat in the room, making Steve freeze, and as fast as he can he turn to the screen looking at the black and white image. "Look here Mr. Stark this is your baby." The doctor said happily as she draws a circle around something, Steve narrowed his eyes trying to see, he then felt his throat close up as he saw a peanut shape, he swallowed, feeling his eyes becoming glassy, and a happy sob left him.
It made Steve pause and give a sad smile as he remembered his friends, everyone was with him when Natasha had asked that question, everyone wanted to ask him questions of their own.
Tony noticed how Natasha and Fury glanced at one another before Natasha gave him a gentle smile, causing Tony to relax a little, struggling to ignore Fury’s narrow eyes that were examining him. “I see; if you recalled anything, or were troubled by the same teens once more, don’t hesitate to call, Mr. Carbonell.” Fury stated before nodding his head and disappeared, causing Tony to blink his eyes at the none challenged way Fury deal with the matter, though he didn’t help but notice how Fury paused near the lake gazing at it with a dark look on his face before continuing with his way.
The A.I. was cut so sudden that Steve couldn't help but hold his breath, the whimper Peter let out made Steve want to growl, and maybe he did, but no sound get out of his throat. "
Antonette was beautiful with her curled black hair, and her teal eyes, with her milky skin, she was smart, as smart as his Anton and liked to study everything new that her hands fell on, but unfortunately, that was not what her parents want for her, her father was the lowest of the low, that only cared about getting into the high-class, so he forced her to marry a complete stranger, she was young, a child, only thirteen, younger than Tonton when he died, but her father may have killed her with his betrayal.
"Bruce!" Tony called out happily when he saw the older man sitting behind his desk, Tony's call made the doctor raise his head with a smile, waving to Tony when he saw him skipping toward the man with a grin on his face. "My, my, where is Jane? Did she gets fired and you are taking her place?" Tony joked causing Bruce to groan and lean back on his seat.
"Hello Mr. Carbonell, I'm Dr. Cho." She said all on that with a smile taking the seat in front of him. After confirming his pregnancy, the doctor started asking him about his family's history of illness, asked him about his illness, if he was diabetic, it he was this, if he was that she asked him so many questions as she wanted him to take so many tests, Tony felt sick by the end of it, why would he care about his diet when he was going to get rid of the baby as soon as he can? Thought Tony as he looked at the sheet of paper in his hand, it was enough that he hadn't even approach alcohol or coffee in the past two months and a half.
To say the truth, Steven never felt as awkward as he did now, sitting in transporting ship with Midgardian who were gazing at him like he was some type of a zoo animal and to make the matter even worse, he was stuck with Thor son of Odin who was fluttering about him like an annoying… fly? Is that what Midgardian says? Steven knows that the man meant well, but it does not justify the constant jumping and whimpering every time Steven winces when his injured leg was moved, the man even screamed at his fellow warriors that they were going to take Steven to the tower, and not to S.H.I.E.L.D. or he was going to knock the ship down, something that made the star's heart freeze in terror.
"W-what are you doing in my room?" Tony squeaked (Which he will deny for the rest of his life) his eyes were still wide and his heart was pumping wildly in his chest; it had been weeks since Serpentine showed up in their lives and she doesn't seem like she is in a hurry to leave them at all. Still, this was the first time she dared to come inside his bedroom; no one from the Addams family dared to come inside Tony's room, especially, when Tony decorate it even worse than his lab with the pink fluffiness everywhere and the cute stuffed animals in every surface and let's not forget the roses hanging from the ceiling, there was even salt and holy water in the corners of the room, so why? Why?!
Steve took them out for ice cream; the last time they will enjoy that amazing treat considering that fall was coming soon followed by winter. After that the three of them returned home, to spend the rest of their day enjoying their time, Steve though ended up leaving midway of them watching a Disney movie that Peter spent three days whining about seeing.
"Moving." Tony finally says when Phillips looks at him expectantly. "I saw an old cabin on sale just outside of Atlanta." Phillips pulls a battered little first aid kit out from under the counter and pushes it towards Tony, which the teen took it gratefully going to the bathroom in the back where the old man pointed, thanking the man in return, grimacing when he looked at his face in the bathroom's mirror, and start cleaning and dressing his wounds as best as he can.
I am so, so, so, so, so sorry for the late chapter.
"You are living near lake Tones, of course, it's bound to get cold." Clint explained as he tried to steal a sausage from Tony's plate, only for Natasha to slap his hand harsh, which made him whine and look at the woman with the widest eyes that were painted with betrayal, when it seemed like it wasn't working, the man huffed and turned to Tony. "If you want, we can buy a new mattress today and bring it here, we don't have anything to do; my lessons for today are canceled while Natasha has a day off." Clint offered which made Tony smile at the two shyly as he nodded his head.
"All for you…" Steve breathed, letting out a sigh as he felt Tony's fingers breach his entrance. Tony was always deft with his fingers, and tonight was no exception. He worked his digits expertly, drawing moan after moan out of Steve. After several minutes, Steve gently nudged Tony's hand away, earning himself a look of concern, to which he shook his head. "I told you I wanted to show just how much I love being yours. Let me take care of you, Tony." Steve whispered, maneuvering them back to his initial position atop of Tony.
"Hey… d-don't cry." Steve heard Tony's tired voice which made him look up and take his lover's outstretched hand. "W-we… both knew this-this was going to h-happen." He muttered making Steve shakes his head and kiss Tony's shaky hand… "M-Morgan?" He asked making Steve pause and swallow.
That made the older man chuckle quietly to himself and he entered his room going straight away to the shower, to spend the next half hour washing the mud and dirt from his skin. "Edith, open the pocket dimension." Steven said as he dried himself after getting out of the bathroom.
"It's okay, we're okay; we are here now…" Tony tried, but he is weak from emotion and his throat feels tight, causing Steve's jaw to tremble against Tony's temple, making Tony squeeze his arms tightly around him. "Never again." Tony's voice cracked, shaking as he swallowed the tears down. Then he lifts his face up to look at Steve, who's eyes reach to him like he's drowning; Tony took his hand, intertwining their fingers and locking them tightly together.
Tony gazed at Steve with a flushed face, he couldn't take his eyes off of the Alpha, the blond man took him and Peter out again, this time they were walking through Brooklyn streets, with the Alpha telling him funny stories of his youth pointing to a place or two giving telling Tony how they were in his time, to be true the Omega was vibrating in his place with happiness, it had been a week since the Alpha presented him with the amazing gift of all (For Tony that is) a week since he held the screwdriver in his hand, assembling and disassembling anything and everything his hands fell on, teaching himself the new discoveries in the past six years and the science he missed while also teaching his baby, who was fascinated with everything Tony does, the Omega already know that his little baby was going to be an amazing engineer.
Things became a little rough after the secret of Tony being pregnant get out; Peggy and Steven were furious, not only at Rogers and Tony but at themselves too for letting things reach this point. Steven knowing it was too late to feel anything but regret, managed to calm Peggy and Tony; the three of them have a long conversation about the next step from there, in which Tony told them that he doesn't want Rogers to know that he was the baby's daddy because he was going to offer the child for adoption, which shocked both Steven and Peggy but they both know they couldn't change Tony's mind, not now.
“So when is the wedding?” Carol asked with a huge grin after everyone took their seats, Tony smiled shyly at his friends’ excited faces, all were waiting to hear what Tony was about to say, the Omega so grateful for how supportive his friends were, even now when it was supposed to be Rhodey’s day.
Thanos followed his beating with a point-blank blast with the Power Stone to Tony's abdomen, sending his lover flying across the battlefield and heavily damaging what's left of Tony's armor. "Tony! Please, run, please! You can't win Tony, please!" Steve screamed, he pleaded, he begged, and wished and tried to think of a way to save Tony. Tony, stupid idiot Tony, stupid noble Tony, even desperate and missing much of the upper half of his armor, Tony attempted to hold off Thanos with his repulsors but it was to no avail. Thanos closed in, and he began beating Tony once again, destroying what's left of the armor. "Please… please let me go, please if you are truly sorry, let me go…" Steve whispered, begging the woman holding him even when he couldn't take his eyes off of Tony who was attempting to defend himself with his bare hands, only for Thanos to grab and trap his left hand. "Please…" The last plea, Steve didn't know who he meant when he spoke it, only that he was begging anyone willing to hear him and save Tony.
"I think Jarvis would have stepped in to stop Mom from doing something too embarrassing." Tony's lips twitched up, he couldn't help but remember how his Mom and Jarvis were like; his Mom the troublemaker, who Tony inherit her traits of being trouble of his own, and Jarvis the poor one who took it as his job to stop his Mom and his Dad from doing something stupid.
"Oh, Stevie! Wherever you are, I'm so proud of you! Tony will make a great addition to the Addams family!" Serpentine squeal happily, giggling as Tony's dark laugh increased, followed by the thunder that came out of nowhere causing everyone to jump and finally book it out of the mansion. Leaving Serpentine whose jaws hurt from smiling widely as Tony let out another manic laughter that mixed well with the sound of thunder behind; if only Steve was here to see this and not haunt that maggot, her baby would sigh happily at the beauty of Tony at this moment…
"Tell me about Steven Rogers. Why did he become what he is now? Why did no one arrest Peirce when Rogers reported him? Why does he kill?" Tony ask instead, trying to change the subject as best as he can; Tony didn't want to think about what Fury just told him, that was another thought for when he is home and going to have a panic attack, not here in the office trying to discover what Steven Rogers want from him.
/Warning/: this chapter contains, cursing, sadness, fluff, a little smut, everyone being protective AF, violence and blood, character death, and a surprise! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
Rogers faltered for a second as if he doesn't know what to do, his hands hovering at his sides, as Tony held to him tightly. Rogers's skin was freezing and cold, but it was warming a little bit in Tony's arms. Taking a shuddered breath, Tony managed to smell Rogers; his scent was of damp, rich soil, of pale green shoots growing under the frozen earth.
"Tony… that's amazing…" Howard and Peggy breathed out as they took the device from Steve, gazing at it with wide eyes as a million other possibilities crossed their minds, already wondering how Omegas' rights would take off with vigor if they started producing this device, the thought of Omegas finally being able to stand up to their fellow Alphas without fear of them using their voice made them hope.
"God, you are really an angel; an angel your idiot husband doesn't deserve." Natasha grumbled to herself as she took a sip from her coffee. "
A little rushed?
It all started with a sound that made Steve wake up in a rush of adrenalin and fear, looking around the room with sleepy eyes in hope of spotting the reason of him being awake… a look at the clock on his bedside told him that it was 3:33 AM in the morning… looking beside him, Steve could see a form under the cover, which made the man shake his head a little before getting out of the bed, leaving his lover asleep as he went toward the kitchen, not even concern about a robbery considering that Steve and his husband lived in the most secure house in all of New York, thanks to Tony's paranoia streak.
Just being inside this room made Tony felt like he was walking through a dream, no, not a dream, being in this room was like being thrown into a magical world full of adventure; the closest Tony can describe this place was it being like Narnia (A favorite book series of his), the magical place the heroes went to when they walked through the closet. Tony could only smile and shake his head at this thought, and he wondered if his Morgan will fall in love with this room just like Tony had.
Steve just shook his head at that, the sound of ping from his pocket made him frown then pull Peggy's phone out of his pocket, he was still waiting for Natasha to fix his phone, and holding Peggy's phone a hostage… he knows that no one knows this number other than their friends. Steve thought for a bit then shrugs and decided to read the letter, when Steve opened the letter his breath left him and he dropped the phone in fear…
"Twenty-five it's then." The woman peeped making Steven blink his eyes at that and turn to her, watching as she returns to what she was doing not a few seconds ago, which was tinkering with her protection armor. "Don't worry star and strips; we are going to return home, already made a contact with Shield and they are en-route." The creature gives a croon of triumph, which made Steven hum at that and return toward his cuffs trying to bite through them with no use.
Tony hummed as he carried his Morgan in her baby carrier and walked to the town, the sling bag left Tony a little bit unbalanced, but the baby bag in Tony's hand gave him a little bit of balance as he continued his way. Tony just smiled and cooed to his baby, chuckling when his daughter squealed and shrieked in delight when she saw a leaf float in front of her, the sight warmed Tony's heart, making him wish that his daughter will hold into her smile and never let it go no matter what.
"Yes, baby, he is your grandpa." Tony stated, a playful smile taking over his face as he winked at Howard. That action caused Howard's heart to pound uncontrollably in his chest, and he turned his gaze toward the small boy, who was watching him with wide eyes full of awe and curiosity.
Steve always seemed to understand him without him having to explain himself more than Tony was comfortable with sharing and the Omega is grateful for that, grateful that the Alpha understood… the Alpha didn't answer straight away, which made Tony close his eyes tightly, thinking that the Alpha was already asleep, but there was a tired sigh coming from down below which made Tony open his eyes and turn his head to the side.
"Natasha why don't you come and say 'Hi' or are you too shy." Peter heard his Papa, said and he turns to the woman that was standing near the door, she had strange hair-like Pep, even stranger, like the color he saw in the papers his Mama had, it was red if he remembered the name right.
I admit I wrote and rewrote the chapter but it didn't reach the satisfying levels I was going after… sad... it seemed much better in my mind, something I couldn't write apparently…
But Steven was winning, after all, he was a warrior through and through, he learned how to fight since he was young, and was to carry his family name and honor it on the battlefield, he learned from a young age how to break his enemy with one hit, making them fall and writhe on the ground in pain, Steven learns how to hit and avoid being hit completely. Even if the Omega hasn't fought for years and years, his skills were engraved in him since puppyhood, not something to be forgotten no matter how weak the Omega acted like.
Steven groans as he woke up; he opened his eyes slowly, blinking a few times to gain his vision back, when he did, he gazed around the place, frowning at the unfamiliar room he was sleeping in. Steven turned to his side, furrowing his brows when he noticed that his babe was sleeping with him on the bed, clutching his hands in one of his small ones, while the other was holding a dagger. It made Steven concern about why his babe was holding something as sharp as this, and he wondered who gave it to him, for he would have never allowed his babe to touch something as sharp as this.
Steve didn't know how long his car rolled around until it came to a stop, leaving Steve hanging upside down thanks to the seatbelt, it was only after a few desperate tried that Steve managed to unlatch the seatbelt, and fall on his back toward the roof or the car, his head ringing leaving Steve hopeless in his place. Steve's head hurt, his back hurt, his belly hurt… everything hurt… blood was running down the gash on his forehead to the side, matting his blond hair red and brown with blood. Steve's nose was throbbing and he couldn't help but cough a few mouthfuls of blood, making fear take hold of him and for him to take a few shaky breaths to calm down. The gashes on his body, leaving Steve feeling like he was nothing but a big throbbing bruise.
The sound of the door being opened made Tony narrow his eyes and with caution, he left the bathroom, then he froze… Obadiah Stane entered the room with a smirk.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, fluff, sadness a lot of it, a little bit of violence, Steve being a sad Mommy, and Tony losing his mind! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
It was a bumpy ride, and this is the best end for our boys!
"What did you do Tony?" Steve said desperately as he gazed at the Alpha with betrayal, which made the Alpha blink and frown at the loud voice the Omega was talking in. "You promised me you stopped drinking, Tony!" The Omega bites the inside of his cheek to stop himself from screaming a few more words at the Alpha, which made the man's frown deepened.
He failed so spectacularly that the evidence was sitting in front of him, in the form of a stick with a positive line, glaring at him from its place on the table, informing him how much of a failure he was that he fell for the lies of someone he once considered a lover and a friend.
"Please, tell me something…" Jarvis said once they entered the staff room, the staff by this point knew the two of them, as they always volunteered here, and in the clinic on the other side of the hospital.
And poor Tony, nearly having multiple heart attacks!
It was funny how a five minutes' walk to the iron gates of their mansion took more than fifteen minutes to complete with all the reporters throwing themselves at their limo, by then Peter was awake, and he was shivering and trying to hide himself behind Tony while whimpering and listening to Steve, who was crooning and holding both Tony and Peter trying to calm them down, Howard has already left the limo, screaming at the reporters and cursing at them, while promising to fire them all and to sue them if they didn't leave his property, Maria was instructing Happy to drive, and not care if the limo hit someone, while the nervous Beta trying to reason with the woman, all in all, it was a chaos.
"I'm crazy!" Steve screamed nearly throwing Peggy's phone at the wall and break it. "I'm crazy! I'm crazy because I continue to hear that sick singing day and night and it won't just fucking stop! I'm crazy because no matter what I do, I'm still hunted by Bucky! Look at this! What the fuck did you do Peggy? Who did you pay to do this sick joke?!" Steve screamed, he was sure everyone outside of the room heard his screaming, he was sure they all cower in fear after all Steve never yelled or scream if he wasn't giving orders on the comm.
"Do you think that saying sorry will cause everything to go back to how it was?" Steve asked glaring at Harley who pouted and looked down; the kid probably thought that if he just apologized everything will get magically better. "Harley, you ran away! Not only did you endanger yourself but you also made everyone worry sick about you!" Steve snapped, letting out a sigh and curse internally when he saw Harley flinch. "Did you not trust us? Did not trust me? Is that why you ran away?" Steve whispered biting the inside of his cheek when he saw how Harley's lips trembled like he was about to start crying any second now.
"I see…" Steven said breathlessly, as he closed his eyes taking a deep breath trying to calm himself down at the whirlwind of emotions he was feeling at the moment, trying to regain his barriers.
Tony sniffled and held his sobs God knows how long until he heard Rogers retreating footsteps and Rhodey shuffling until he was sitting beside Tony under the table. Tony wondered if he should apologize to Rhodey for dooming his life, being in love with a Rogers was a curse that only Tony seemed to be immune to, but it didn't mean that Tony's heart didn't break for the idiots who fell for Rogers… especially when those idiots were his friends.
"Are you OK?" Peggy asked with a worry in her voice, which made Steve crack his eyes open then groan and curse under his breath…
Serpentine and Steve stilled for a second, giving Tony ire look before both of them blinked their eyes, looking at each other in deep thoughts before creepy grins took over their faces, causing Tony to gulp, dread taking over him as he felt like he just signed his death with his own hand. "That's perfect,
"It's OK, sweetheart, come here." Tony smiled as he opened his arms, which caused Peter to sob and rushed toward him, hugging Tony tightly as he shook. "Harley, you too…" Tony gazed at Harley offering one of his arms to the boy as he waited for him; finally after what seemed like forever, Harley slide down the couch and into Tony's arms holding tightly as he let out small sobs. "It's OK, nothing bad happened, it's just a glass of water; I am just glad that none of you are hurt," Tony reassured the kids, kissing the top of their heads as he let out his calming pheromones, humming gently to the boys until both of them calmed down. "Now that you two calmed down, why don't you go and wash your faces, I will come and serve dinner after I clean the glass, OK?" Tony asked, getting a nod from both Harley and Peter as the two of them let go and went to do as ordered.
Once they reached the clinic, Steve stopped his car in his private parking spot and get out of the car after shutting the engine, Maria gets out of the passenger seat, the older Omega wanted to come with them, to be with Tony and Peter, and to be true to himself, Tony really wanted the older Omega with him, he felt safe with his mother around. Steve was kind enough to open the backseats door for Tony to get out of the car with Peter in his embrace, and Tony had to grimace at the flashed of the lights he felt behind him, but Steve was fast enough to hide him and Peter away from the reporters.
Things are starting to get darker and dark and fast.
Jamti let out a tired sigh, looking around Anton's workshop, hoping that there weren't any weapons that Anton will be an idiot to use against the elders. "They have every right to choose, Anton, especially when you are an unmated Alpha at the age of 32 springs; not only that but your actions in the past years are out of control, what happened a while ago with Hamar, was the last straw." Jamti stressed his words, causing his friend to growl and return back to the metal he was working on, hammering it with all of his strength, making Jamti wince.
Steve let out another sigh, grumbling to himself as he took his combat knife from his belt, stabbing the voodoo doll that came toward him intending to steal the crystal ball, the doll thrashed and shriek but Steve only rolled his eyes, taking the doll head in his metal hand and ripping it from the body, ignoring the agony screech that followed as the doll turned into ashes.
Finishing his house, Tony wanted to squeal and jump around when he saw the finished house, his heart was about to burst out of his chest any moment now because he can already imagine his future here! He can already imagine his baby playing around the place, jumping in the flower bed while laughing, he can already imagine them sitting on the swing that he asked Bucky to install on the porch.
"Yeah, maybe I should give Goddess Frigga offerings in hope of finding someone I will not hate and end up killing by the end of the year." Grunt Anton, frowning at the metal that was of no use to him now that it has cool and took a strange shape. "I just have to bear the Stone clan staying here until the end of the Winter, after that I will try and search for someone." Anton start, throwing the metal far away in the workshop, planning to work something out with the metal later.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Do you wanna go and play Peter?" Steve asked the small boy when they reached the playground, which made Peter squirm in Tony's grip and nod his head extending his hands to Steve, which made the older man laugh before taking the small boy. The day was fun if Tony had to say so himself, they played in the playground until Peter was tired, then Steve bought the three of them ice-cream, and it really made Tony laugh how Steve tried to explain what ice-cream was to Peter, in the end, it was Tony who ate most of the ice cream, which made Steve give him a mock glare as he tried to clean his shirt that Peter dripped ice cream all over.
Once inside, the two of them were greeted by a smiling Tony, who finished preparing the dining table, Peter let go of Steve's hand and walk toward Tony, shyly, and Steve knows deep down that Tony was trying to desperately make himself stop cooing at the cute picture his son was making. "What's running inside that big mind, Pete?" Tony asked as he kneeled to be at eye level with the small boy, which caused the baby to fidget a little before his face turned a little red.
can hope to reach.
Before Tony started shouting at Steve and raise his blood pressure even more than it already was, Steve's grin widened and became feral. In a blink of an eye, Steve lowered his face and gave Tony a smock kiss on the lips, at that action, Tony's muscles froze in their place, unable to move no matter how much he willed them, still too shock and frozen to act out when he was still being kissed.
Hearing the words 'Holy Water' made Bucky shriek like his heart was pierced as he rushed toward Rogers with a towel, trying to dry the man who was gazing at Tony like the world ended before his very own eyes, which made Tony give another eye roll, especially when Bucky starts threatening him with painful death for what he did to his 'Stevie'. Tony huffed as he turned around and start walking back to the lab, ignoring the glaring and hissing he was getting from his teammates as they gazed at Tony like they were already planning his death… when Tony turned to glance at his team once more, he saw Rogers looking at the floor with a crestfallen face, but what made Tony feel guilty was when he noticed that Rogers' face and skin turn red like it was irritated due to the holy water…
It was a few seconds later that Peggy found them, her eyes getting wide as she ordered Bucky to take him to their home, not that Tony would have opposed that or protested with the action, for he was too drained to do anything but follow Bucky whose gentle hands guide him to the man's house; Tony didn't know how, but he ended up taking the sofa in the living room of the Barnes-Carter household, a thick blanket surrounding him, trying to warm his body that was shivering not only from cold but from the terror that was still coursing through his body.
He was once again, drunk, not something new as he was drunk for the past two years since his baby's death, it was nothing new for him, but he was tired of this cycle that continued to repeat itself over and over again, he was so tired.
From Rogers's side of things, he finally manages to make Bucky remember him, even if Bucky sometimes space out and couldn't focus on him, his mind still not healed enough to handle everyday life. Though Steven, even if he hates Rogers he couldn't see Bucky suffer anymore, and after a long talk with Rogers, the Alpha ended up accepting Steven's advice of finding a therapist for Bucky.
"It is OK, Tony…" Steve whispered, putting his right hand on Tony's stab wound, pulling the Space Stone power, and tried to purify it with his magic, refusing for Tony to come close to the maddening power of one of the Infinity Stones. "Promise me you will return back to Midgard, Tony…" Steve whispered his lips wobbled when Tony shook his head. "Promise that you would take care of Peter and forget about your stupid quest of saving me. Promise me that you would forget about me…" The tears that left Tony's eyes, broke Steve even more, and Steve wondered how much Steve can handle before breaking off completely.
which got a nervous giggle from Petrus and a snort from Steven; that's his son. "Anyways… about your betrothal; I am sure you are away of what happened to Brookland… you see, that day ch-" Nicolaus wasn't even able to continue his speech before the sound of horns blaring out, causing Steven and Nicolaus to frown; in the back of his mind, Steven was grateful that Nicolaus was stopped from breaking what's left of his heart, because Steven doesn't need a reminder that his betroth has met his end, or that he as alive elsewhere and already mated with children. "What's going on?" Nicolaus asked, turning his question to Petrus and James when he saw the two pups jumping impatiently with wide grins on their faces.
"What's going on boys?" Tony asked when the two finally appeared before him, Tony couldn't help biting his bottom lips to stop his laughter, especially when his eyes fell on Peter's cheeks that were buffed in a protest at how Steve refused the boy every time the little munchkin wanted to go and play with Harley. Seeing him, Peter grinned happily, thinking that he finally manage to have someone in his corner that would let him play with his friend.
"Marry me." Tony asked Steve after they told their child the truth; hearing those two words that Steve longed forever since he met Anthony, the Omega couldn't help but smile happily and nod his head. The two of them married the next day, with the Parkers and Bucky being their witnesses (That didn't stop the Barnes family and Maria Stark from shrieking and threaten to kill them if they didn't have a real wedding ceremony).
It was August 10th, his baby's sixth birthday, the boy was excited and was all around the place, with a happy smile on his face, but Steve saw him pause once or twice with a confused look on his face like something was missing, Steve went to his baby to ask him what was wrong after all Peter's friends were coming, Harry and Gwen, and the boy was always excited when he sees the two of them.
If you thought the past weeks were stressful with all the work, work, Addams, work, Addams, Addams, ghost Addams, the Avengers… then you haven't seen anything. That's what Tony would have said with a tired look on his face as he dragged his body like he was a zombie to the kitchen hoping to have a peaceful cup of coffee before he was forced to deal with the Avengers and the crazy Addams that live with him. The weeks followed Tony's confession... were hard... they were draining, they were painful, and Tony wished everything will just end already!
Steven looked at his shaking son, his heart pounding in his chest harder than it ever was, and he stopped only for a second which made the king tug his arm harder, that caused the Omega to hiss at him as he lowered himself, allowing his son to hang into him as he stood up, carrying his son with one arm, and glaring at the Alpha who was frowning at him.
Tony shook as he saw himself putting on the mask and then a few seconds later he was talking to himself, it made Tony bit his lips and look at the mask lying on the table… Come back? Where did Tony go if Steve told him that? It ends with Tony getting back to work, it ends with the Alpha finding a new element by a miracle, it ends with him creating a Vibranium core, and it ends up with him defeating Whiplash for once and for all…
On his way back home, he saw Pepper and his mother, the two of them with tears in their eyes, his mother held him tightly when he reached them, it ends up with Tony thinking and thinking, turning to look at Barnes who was surrounded by his family, his father, mother, and sister as they hold him crying on his shoulder. "Hey, Barnes…" Tony called out which made the Alpha turn to him. "I expect to see you in a week, I promised you an arm, and I always keep my promises." He said which made the other Alpha laughed at that and nods his head… Tony tried not to feel like trash for not telling Barnes that he was the Carbonell he talked about.
"We went to the electronic shop." Rhodey stated as he put all of their purchase on the kitchen counter, making Tony give a confused noise. "Tony… I think it's time that we install Jarvis." Rhodey stated after a little pause, his words making Tony still in his place, only moving to shush his baby when she starts grumbling.
"I see you are awake." A gentle voice said, making Steven turn his eyes to the person who was standing near the door with a tray, Steven glared at the man, even when the Beta gave him nothing but a gentle smile, though, the Beta didn't seem to be phased by his actions. "My name is Braes, the village healer." The man said as he came toward Steven, ignoring the way that the Omega hides his babe away from the Beta, something that Steven admired the Beta for not pointing. "Now that you are awake, please drink this, it was a miracle that you survived the shock, I do not want all of my hard work to fall apart just because you refuse to take the medicine." These words were said in a firm tone, causing Steven to roll his eyes and take the mug from Braes' hand.
"I… I want to see them." Tony pleads with Steve, that made the Alpha pause and smile at the Omega, Steve stood up and went to the door, he opens it and look outside to see that everyone was waiting in the uncomfortable chairs they pulled out of somewhere.
A few more minutes pass before the shadow finally decided to show itself, causing Steven's eyes to widen and for his jaw to fall a little; shock painted his face clearly when he saw the person in front of him. Steve blinked his eyes, wondering if what he was seeing was true, that the person standing in front of him was real and not a play of his imagination. A part of Steven couldn't help but wonder if the Alpha standing in front of him was the same Alpha his family considered a dear friend; Nicolaus Fiðr, an Alpha supposed to have died in the sea not long after Steven and his mother left Brookland.
After The Avengers, after Shield, Hydra, The Winter Soldier, Ultron, Civil War, after Thanos… things changed, and finally after so many years of heartaches and pain, after so many years of crying and betrayals… everything was finally looking up…
"J.A.R.V.I.S. play a yoga video for me, make sure it's for beginners," Tony ordered as he unrolled his mat and stood on it, stretching a little as he waited for the A.I. to play the video that Tony requested; Tony doesn't know what he would encounter while doing yoga, so it's better to be on the safe side than pulling a muscle and walk funny for the rest of the day. It was a few seconds later that the video started, and with it, Tony started taking a pose after a pose, breathing deeply in and out.
The next day, all of their friends showed up; every one of them, from his friends to Steve's they all were in their house crowding the place with their presence, Tony can say he has met many interesting people that day, from the Odinsons brothers who took one look at him before clapping Steve on the back, though the one named Loki, just looked at Steve like the man commit suicide. To the Wilsons, which made both Tony and Sam's eyes widen when they noticed each other, they tried to hide their discomfort from everyone else, but as always Steve noticed, and gave Tony a reassuring smile, causing him to relax. To Steve's manager Fury, who was scary as fuck with the glare he sends everyone within a meter from his sight, Tony made sure to smile and wave to the man.
A small part of Steven wondered what would have happened if the Iron king lost that battle, just that one battle against the Hydra king; just that one… just that one so that Steven will still hold his babe in his arms, raising him beside James and tell him how much he loved him and cherish him. the total time Steven spent with his babe before he had to give him up was one hour, one hour that wasn't enough for Steven to think of a strong name for him in his mother language.
Steve slowly raked his hands down the Alpha's body, admiring Tony's torso. Without a single warning, once his hands reached Tony's waist, Steve swiftly leaned over, taking the cock below him into his mouth. Tony gave a punched out groan at the feeling of his cock hitting the back of Steve's throat, and Steve preened at that. His goal for the night was to do nothing but make Tony feel good, and it seemed that he was off to a great start.
"Good morning." Steve, dream-Steve? Smiled at him as he said these simple words, causing Tony's breath to hitch and for his eyes to widen; tears were hot in Tony's eyes as he tried not to cry. It had been days since the last time he heard Steve talk, it has been such a long time since he saw the comforting smile that was free of pain and hurt on Steve's face, and Tony couldn't handle it anymore.
?" Serpentine asked in a horrified voice, and Tony was a little unbalanced by the woman's words, what? What did he say wrong?
"Did you think I was going to let you elope with that nothing of an Omega?" Howard snapped which made Tony close his mouth looking at his father with shock; the room becomes few degrees colder at that statement. "What? Did you think that I didn't know? Didn't know about you using the name Anthony Carbonell…" That got a choked sound from Bucky as he looked at Tony who was clenching his fists. "That you made a fake passports and papers, did you think that I didn't know about you saving money and selling your cars, didn't know about the houses you bought outside of the country with fake aliases so that you and that Omega can run away, did you really think that just because you made this idiotic plan meant that you will stop being a Stark once you left the country?" Howard shouted at Tony who bit the inside of his cheek trying to stop himself from attacking the older man.
"Good morning!" That was Pepper's cheerful voice when she finally noticed Tony and Peter, Tony can hear and see the strain in Pepper's eyes and tone as she tried to be cheerful as she greeted Tony, and Tony didn't have the heart not to return her greeting, especially when he saw how uncomfortable she was, playing the cheerful person role, trying to lighten everyone's day when the only thing everyone wanted was to hide in their rooms and wallow in self-pity.
Because Steve and his Ma were driving Tony crazy, Tony started driving Pepper crazy, which caused Pepper to through her high heels at Tony's head and ordered him to meditate or do yoga if he was
"A ghost?" Pepper perked up, holding up her cup for a refill. "You have ghosts?" She asked once more, only for Angie to pause in her place for a second too long, Tony tensed in his place waiting for what's going to happen, only for Angie to start laughing out loud while shaking her head and waving the jug toward Tony.
"Are you happy Tony?" Howard finally asked after a short while of silence, causing Tony to blink his eyes in confusion. But Tony as always was smart and seemed to realize what Howard meant because his eyes soften and his smile became the pure definition of happiness causing Howard's heart to pound in his chest; this, this was the look that Howard longed to see on his son's face, this was the look he and Maria wished Tony will have when he will see his one and only, and it seems that God has heard his prayers because Tony has that look on his face.
Thankfully, the house didn't hold any signs of the break and enter that dominated Tony's thought, for the past month, which was the only reason why he didn't run out of the house as soon as he can. "Are you sure, sweetheart? You know we can stay in Manhattan until you are feeling better." Steve asked him when they reached their home, the kids nodding their heads and gazing at the house with mistrust as if another monster was waiting for them inside.
"It doesn't matter if I am captured; I will be of no value to whoever takes me." Steven finally declared, leaning on the wall behind him and crossing his arms, overlooking the stammer that Thor did at such horrible words. "What you weren't told of, all the stars who fell were shining, those who seized them ensured of that, taking care of them, giving them hope, promising them sweet words that laced with poison underneath, and when the stars start glowing in this form once more, they were swiftly killed to extract the illuminating source of our magic; our hearts. In my case though, I almost petty the fool who wanted me, for even if they succeed in obtaining my heart, I'm not a glowing star. The most they can have of my magic is seventy years of existence before their death. What I fear is Midgard turning into a battleground if someone discovered a star is on your realm after six thousand years." Steven's remarks caused deafening silence to take place in the room, and Steven can see how everyone starts shifting uncomfortably by these words.
"S-so he is not a bad man?" The pup asked shakily, his words small and unsure like he wanted to desperately believe in the Omega's words, but what he saw was still playing in his mind, stopping him from hoping, and it broke Tony's heart. A year of bonding between his son and Alpha was just flushed down the drain not a few seconds ago because of him and his rash decision… Just so that he would be able to test…
"Steve Rogers." The smile on his face fell as he saw a strange Alpha in a dark suit looking at him, then looking at the picture in his hand, putting in in his pocket when he checked who he was. That display made Steve tense and looks at the strange man with suspicion as his hand inched toward the bat behind the door.
The next few days preparing the house and installing Jarvis was a little hectic in every imaginable way possible; from preparing the playroom that Tony found in Morgan's room (Which Pepper called magical wonderland), to cleaning and repairing the house (The holes Rhodey and Tony made and didn't use still glared at them), to rebooting Jarvis and waiting for him to confirm if the attachment Tony and Rhodey made were working (Which thankfully they did. Tony will never tell Rhodey and Pepper how proud he was when he heard the A.I. through the speakers installed in the house; though he suspects they knew), to many other minor things that Tony liked to get busy working on.
"That means…" Peggy's voice cracked as she trailed of when the situation finally made sense to them, it only took a few seconds before the Avengers ran to Steve, fighting between themselves to be the first to hold and hug him. Loki's shrieks made Tony raise his head from where he was trying to pull Steve away from Bucky who was about to strangle Steve for
"It's simple, baby doll, I vant you. Ever since firrrst time I saw you, I knew you verrre mine, my mate, my everrrything; so kome out baby, I prrromise everrrything is going to be OK." The man cooed causing Steve to gag unconsciously and back away from the bathroom's door, looking around once more in vain, hoping to find an escape, the sound of sirens coming from far away made Steve's heart leap in his chest, hope started to bloom in his heart at the thought that Bucky is finally here.
Growling Starkad could only stalk the roads in search of his son, hoping to catch where the foolish Omega had gone to and with him his boy. "Starkad!" someone called out to him, which caused the Alpha to whirl around and glare at the person who dared to disturb his search, only to raise his eyebrow when he saw Braes running toward him with ashen face and fear in his eyes.
Steve promised himself that this would be the last time he will answer an unknown number; the next time he will either give the phone to Tony and make his husband track them, or he will give it to Bucky and enjoy the shouting match that will ensure, it was getting tiring and boring, maybe he should change his number? "Who the fuck is this?" Steve snapped, finally running out of patients. It was a few minutes later that Steve heard a chuckle at the end, and Steve gritted his teeth at that, this is it! He was going to wake Tony and demand his husband find the fucker at the end of this line.
"Shit, shit, shit!" Tony's voice cracked as he leaned on the wall behind him, trying to walk on the slippery eaves, trying not to fall and break something; the sound of the door breaking caused Tony's breath to hitch as he tried to walk faster, away from the window and away from what could possibly tip Howard's toward Morgan (Not that Howard would manage to get her if she was in the playroom, Tony made sure of that).
"I am going to kill him." Tony hissed to himself as he kicked his suitcase to put it in the position to activate not even thinking or caring about the high tech that needed to be deal with cautions. All Tony cares about now was putting holes in Howard's useless body, how dare he? How dare that fucker lie to him? How dare he destroy his and Steve's life?
It ends up with him seeing Rhodey after two years and a half, and for the older Alpha to hug him tightly, telling him how proud he was of him. He met Carol Rhodey's fiancé, a fierce Beta in the air force like him, their wedding was in three months, and believe it or not, he was the best man.
"Coming!" Tony called out as he opened the door, smiling when he saw Bucky and Peggy on the other side, holding boxes of takeout with them. It was then that Tony knew, that he will become fat from Angie's delicious cooking. "Hello." Tony waved toward Peggy and Bucky, letting them come through.
Tony could only blink his eyes when he saw all of his friends sitting around the breakfast table, everyone seemed to be lost in their own world, even Thor was here, playing with his pop tarts more than taking a bite from them, it had been six months since the last time Tony saw Thor, six months since the God had holed himself in London with Jane, unable to stomach the thought of going back to Asgard ever since Steve's sacrifice. Tony just let a tired sigh, hugging Peter tightly as he seat on the chair with his baby in his lap, he could only lean on his son, hiding his face in his baby's neck, raising his face only when Peter, would pull away and try to shove a forkful of pancake in Tony's mouth.
In the end, Barnes decided to come with Tony, in hope of explaining to Steve what happened, and hope that the Omega didn't ban Tony from seeing his son again which knowing the Omega, he will rip his head off before he got a word out. Reaching Steve's house, the Alpha fidgets uncontrollably which ended with Bucky being the one who knocked on the door, wincing when the door was thrust opened so hard after a few minutes that it slammed in the wall behind the door, and an enrage Steve got out of the house glaring daggers at both the Alphas, making them cower, wishing that they could disappear any second now.
Steve made sure to work hard, but not too hard that it hurt the baby, Steve never had money, and Anthony knows that, with a soldier father and a nurse mother, life was hard but it was happy, and Steve had never lied about who he was like his ex-Alpha. Anthony had pleaded with him to move in with the Alpha after his mother's death, it was hard at first, but Steve did agree to move in with him, though Steve made sure to tell the Alpha that he was going to work too, no matter how well-off Anthony was, it had made the Alpha happy but still, he always made sure to take Steve out every weekend, because the Omega told him that he hated expensive gifts that some Alphas give to their Omegas, because to him it seemed like they were buying their love…
Yes, I am evil….
The child looked at the king then at Johann before letting out a shaky breath.
"But… but you have work today… and Papa said I'm grounded…" Peter mumbled which made Tony's lips twitch down before they twitch up in a smile, sitting instead of lying and pulling the boy in his embrace, making the boy look up at him with wide brown eyes, and Tony couldn't help himself from kissing the boy's forehead.
By the end Tony was shaking, he could do nothing but shake his head and look around the room, the realization that everything he thought and knew was lie struck him, that he choked on his breath, he felt someone touch him and it ends with Tony turning around and snarl at the person, it was Pepper, and she flinched at his murderous look, but that was for another time, he will apologize for her later. "Tony…" Pepper called out softly which made Tony blink and power walked to his suitcase; he had a bastard to kill.
Life with Steve was amazing, the Omega was amazing! He was kind, witty, loving, understanding, amazing, and Anthony could go on and on for hours, Anthony couldn't believe how an amazing person like Steve will even look at him and think he was worth something, every day Anthony found himself in love more and more with the Omega, who was still the kindest Anthony ever saw even with all the pain he went through. From his family's friend moving away, to his mother's death, to him finally moving into Anthony's apartment after the Alpha begged him for weeks.
It was a week later that Tony heard about the clinic from his mother, the woman was telling Tony about the hospital and the clinic that specialize in helping Omegas, but what made him tick was when his mother mentioned to him that she would like for Tony to come with her to the clinic, and meet some of the doctors working there, it made Tony held into his screams and tried to smile, his mother was never subtle no matter how much she tried, his baby was asleep and he didn't want to wake the pup who was purring happily and contently while hugging the toy and the blanket the Alpha gave him.
"You brats! If you are going to come inside of my workshop only to ignore me then I advise you to leave before I put you to work." Anton's threat, which got him a squeak of betrayal from his boy, making Anton hide his grin with a dark frown, it was so funny and easy to mess up with his son, especially when the boy was too expressive about it.
"They are late; though I cannot say I am not happy, it would mean that I will have until next year to decide about the marriage…" Anton stated annoyance cleared in his voice, even with his face being the picture of calmness he was not feeling anything but annoyance and probably relieved. It was a week after the promised meeting with his supposed guests, a week of them not arriving to the village, and to say the truth Anton and his close friends were content with them not arriving to their homeland at all; if only the elders of the village thought the same as him.
"And this is where I became Captain America!" Steve said as he pointed at an abandoned shop/building which made Peter gasp in awe as he clutched Steve's shirt tightly and jump up and down in his arms, making the Alpha give a laugh before calming the pup down last he hurt himself, which made Tony's lips twitch up in a smile.
Sorry for the really short chapter, but I am really busy this week.
27-Dreptu þá alla. -Kill them all
The walk was a long one, not because of the distance no, not one bit, but because Steven has to stop every five minutes or so, mainly to catch his breath. To Steven's surprise, the king stayed with him the whole time, looking more manic than ever with the dark look on his face that scared everyone passing; something that Steven knows was only a façade trying to hide his tiredness, it made Steven wonder what happens to the cocky and foolish king, only to roll his eyes and pull away from any of the king's affairs.
Blinking, Steven's lips curl into a snarl when his ears caught a noise that wasn't normally associated with the forest; controlling himself, Steven huffed as he turned around and started to walk deeper into the forest, frowning darkly when the faint sound continued to follow him. Whoever was the person following Steven, the person was no doubt trying to hide his presence; any other person wouldn't have noticed the shadow, but not Steven, for the Omega spent years mastering how to catch the enemies and the shadows the Hydra king send after him.
"For God's sake, Tony; can't you for once, just for once, stop looking so far into the future that you can't focus on what's around you!" Steve's voice cracked and he tried desperately to stop the tears that clouded his eyes since his son fainted from running down his face. "You always look so far, but you don't realize that neither Peter nor I have a future! The two of us can only live in the here and now; we can't play pretend anymore when our son may never stand up and face tomorrow least of all, the future you always talk about! If you wanted the future you so desperately want, why the fuck didn't you invent a cure for Peter, huh? Why did you disappear for weeks only to show up empty-handed? Just talks no result that's the thing with you." It was a lost battle, and the tears that clouded Steve's eyes from the beginning start running down his face.
; it hasn't happened for five centuries, and it never will! The ones who did that were punished severely, they were disowned from the family, had their possessions seized, and were banished far away from their spouses." Serpentine stated causing Tony to blink his eyes at Serpentine words… OK, this was the first time Tony heard that the Addams had laws of their own… and it was kinda reassuring to hear that. "If an Addams raised their hand it meant they broke their vows and marriage, so it's within their spouses' right to get rid of them in any way they desire; so it was within my right to kill Joseph. It's also within your right to kill or divorce your husband
Steve watched the Omega break down, his eyes become glassy at that. Howard was next, as he held his son and starts telling his son how proud of him, how much he missed him that made Tony give a loud sob, holding onto his father tightly. "J-Jarvis…" Tony called out when his eyes fell on the older Beta, the older man gives a small smile, his eyes tearing up. Steve pushed him toward the Omega, making the older man look at Steve than to Tony who was pleading with him to come closer, the Beta limp toward Tony, that made Tony sob and hold the Beta tightly when he reached him, at that, Jarvis finally let his tears fall.
... he felt like he was choking, he who starts trying to fix Dum-E, as a way to ask for forgiveness, begging a machine to forgive him because he was a coward… a coward who decided to crash his plane nose-first in the ice, because he couldn't handle losing his mate, he who thinks that the AI was his only friend who truly accepts his craziness, who talked with an AI more than he talks with his friends, he who made JARVIS show him Tony's old college books and plans, so he can learn, so he can become a good engineer, so he can finally fix Dum-E, and gain forgiveness from someone who is long gone… gone for six years, three months, two weeks, five days, one hour, twenty minutes, and ten seconds… not like he was counting or anything…
Steve was gentle about it, no matter how much Tony begged, but that didn't mean he was merciful. He ignored Tony's pleas of hurrying up, stretching and kissing and playing with his body like it was a fiddle that Steve had mastered, even when this was their first time together. Tony was as open as he can be from his husband's fingers, the bed and his husband's hand were drenched in his slick, and Tony was willing, so, so willing, and yet Steve ignored his pleas of hurrying up and took Tony's cock in his hand, giving it soft tugs "Are you
As time passed, the pain of losing Anton had reduced to a dull ache, and he was grateful for that because it finally gave him the chance to move on, as much as it hurt him too, he wanted to move on and stop pinning after a dead mortal, but the heart wants what it wants, it was ironical how much that sentence was true, and it was funny that it was said by Anton.
Harley didn't know what he did when he ran to search for Mr. Clint, all he knew was that his asthma was kicking in when he found the other Omega, pointing to him about Mr. Tony being in trouble. It was when Harley noticed Mr. Clint taking a gun that his breath left him completely and he was left gasping as he tried to follow Mr. Clint, hoping desperately that the strange woman wasn't a criminal who would hurt Mr. Tony badly. It was Harley's fault; he shouldn't have left Mr. Tony's side he should have stayed beside him. Standing near the front door, Harley's hand went to his jacket's pocket, getting out his inhaler and taking a deep breath, trying to calm down before something bad happened and he passed out.
Steve sighed and looked at the sky with a scowl before clearing his throat, his eyes returning to the ball. "It's me, Steve… Steven Rogers, Serpentine's son." Steve offered, hoping that grandma Addams will either tell him where to find his mother or that his mother is with her, either way, Steve really needs to find his mother; sitting in his pet cemetery probably wasn't the best place to make a connection with the other world, he probably should have gone to one of the Addams cemeteries in Brooklyn, maybe then he would have had luck in finding his mother.
"You don't have to be sad love; your Daddy had been with us for a long time now, it's my fault because I didn't tell you who he really was." Steve whispered shakily, causing Peter to raise his eyes in confusion and equally hope, making Steve's breath leaving him. "Anthony Carbonell. A genius, billionaire, philanthropist…" Steve stated teasingly causing Peter's eyes to widen as realization painted his eyes.
6-heimskur konungur. -foolish king.
So what do you think?
… she thought sadly to herself, she really hates it, but that was the hard part of her job, not everyone walks inside these doors want their children, she just hoped that this youth was different. "Well, Mr. Carbonell considering that you are twelve weeks, would you like us to do an ultrasound? To check in on the baby," The doctor said. Tony paused at that then shrugged his shoulders, why not? At least he will know what the parasite was up to before he said goodbye forever and part ways.
"Y-yes, I… I do. I'm actually Italian." Maria said as she finally get a grip of herself and looked at the pup that was now standing in front of her and she only then noticed how small he was for his age, wasn't the pup supposed to be nine or ten years old? The pup looks younger though like he was seven or eight, too small…
Half an hour past with the three of them bickering and Natasha threatening Tony with death if he starts working without her being there to help, it was Clint who gave the olive branch by saying they will start the work once they brought in the mattress which should only take half an hour top if they went fast, which shut Natasha up.
"Wait, what? What do you mean reject? Stark! What did you do?" Bucky screamed as he took a threatening step toward Tony, planning to kill the man and hide his body in the cemetery that Steve created in the backyard, how dare that man try and seduce his Stevie?
"So how are you really, Stevie?" Bucky asked as he helped washing the dishes with Steve, Bucky still couldn't believe that he was standing here beside Steve, talking to the Omega and joking with him, he couldn't believe that hours ago, he met Steve's baby, a small kid who was too smart for his own good, but the smell of sickness surrounding him, he couldn't believe that the boy knew his name and introduce himself as Peter telling Bucky that his mother always told him stories about the Alpha, he couldn't believe that an hour ago he was sitting on the dining table with Peter and Steve sharing stories and jokes and eating dinner without a care in the world… it made Bucky wonder if this is what living with Steve meant, wondering if he would have had this if he asked the Omega out years and years ago, he wondered if he would have sat on this table sharing stories and jokes with Steve and his pup, but the Alpha shook his head at that.
!" Peter's voice was faint and afraid as he tried to shake Steve awake, and for the thousand times, Steve cursed this mortal body that repels against him.
" Many voices shrieked as one, causing everyone to scream and try to run to the door, desperately trying to break it when it didn't open as they hoped to.
"You can call me Commander Rogers or Steven, though I prefer to be called by my name." Steven said which made the man hum at that and nod his head before start unpacking the grocery, but he did throw Steven glances from time to time. "Tell me, Tony, don't you have an AI?" Steven asked off-handedly which made Tony nearly jump at that.
Thor had gone back to Asgard, Steve refused to tell the prince or his friends about any other information, least something happened that was unsavory, Thor told him that he was going to talk with his father in hope that his father will grant Steve a meeting to discuss a way for him to go back home, or a way to stop the dark future that Thor got a glimpse of by Edith's analyzing.
Tony didn't even know how, but in the end, he ended up helping Barnes get his friend back after the annoyed man begged Tony for three days straight after Project Insight to help him get his friend back. And as much as Tony loved Barnes' begging, it was honestly getting annoying, so in the end, Tony agreed to help the man and in the next two weeks they were able to catch the Winter Soldier with no issues… that is, if you didn't count Barnes' broken face (Again).
Fury's lips twitched down before a tired smile took over his face, his eyes taking in a distant look like he was thrown far away in the past. "Yes, that's true." Fury stated, blinking his eyes and letting out a tired sigh. "It all started with Sharon, Peggy's sister. No one noticed at first, how she became distant and withdrawing, how she turned her back on everything… no one noticed but Steven Rogers. Before his death, Rogers comes to talk with me, back then I had just graduated from the police academy, but Rogers still came to me; maybe because our parents were friends or maybe something else, I don't really know. But two days before his death, he came to me and told me about Pierce, about how the man was not what he seemed, about how he was assaulting Sharon, about some of his nefarious plans… no one really believed him, and I am ashamed to say I too didn't, not even with the evidence he provided." Fury whispered, pressing his lips tightly with a thoughtful look.
Tony looked at the house in front of him with pounding heart, it had been two days since the last time he saw the love of his life, two days since he knew about his little bambino Peter, two days he spent paying all of Steve's debts to the hospital and all of its interest while booking them a private wing only for Peter in Jarvis' hospital, two days he spent working trying to make everything perfect for when he finally talks to Steve and explain everything to him.
The Avengers looked at one another before turning their sight on Steve, as much as they hated waking the star up. But as it may, the Avengers needed Steve to tell them what happened; until Tony hacks the mansion's security, they were going into this blind. "Steven, can you please tell me what happened when we were away? How are you…?"
"You Alphas are all the same… how disappointing…" Steven said before turning away, leaving Anton standing in front of his workshop, the realization of what Anton had implied by his words made Anton choke and for the blood into his veins to turn into frozen water, making him stay still in his place. Anton couldn't help but feel like he had just lost whatever progress he made with the queen, throwing him back into the starting line where Anton couldn't even share his input without being labeled as a monster by the queen.
"You and this lie again! You say you have a girlfriend for ten years now, and not once did you even bring her home to meet the family! God, where is Steve when you need him, at least he would have knocked some manners into you!" Winnie complains which made Bucky groan at that and throw himself on the couch ignoring the rest of his mother's rant.
In the end, it was his son who surprises him. "Mommy, do we have a picture of Daddy?" The little boy asked Steve making the Omega lose his words and just stood still staring at his son like an idiot. "I mean… Daddy is not here, and you never told me about him… so if he was gone… can I have his picture?" Steve should have known, the one thing that his son inherited from his father the most, was his intelligent, his baby was smart, super smart, just like his father, he loved science and robots and inventions, so for his son to think that way, with all the pieces of evidence being laid in front of him that pointed to that… it was an unenviable situation.
"Tony!" Howard's voice was tight as he spoke his name, wanting to run to the Omega and hide him from Stane's leering eyes, but he was stopped by Peggy who shook her head and sent the older Alpha a pointed look. It was a clear order for him to stand down, that this was not his battle and that Tony was the one who needed to face this.
It was a few minutes of the woman standing outside of his home, making Harley frown, wondering why the woman would stand in here for minutes without knocking on the door or leaving the streets. "Peter…" Harley called out, turning his head toward Peter only to see him too busy with Lila and Cooper to pay Harley any attention, which did nothing but caused Harley to pout and turn his eyes back toward the strange woman once more.
"Is everything alright? What happened?" The sound of Braes broke both Steven and the king out of their staring match; it was only a few seconds after Braes showed up inside the room, the king rushed out, leaving the healer and Steven confuse about the king's reaction.
The sound of footsteps getting closer made Tony blink his eyes, and from his place at the swings looked toward the source of the sound, frowning when he saw Natasha walking toward him. "You are not welcomed here, Romanov," Tony stated tensing as he held his sleeping baby tightly, wondering what Natasha was going to do now she was here.
So what do you think? Finally an update!
He should get rid of the child, it will be so easy, getting rid of a child that will bring nothing but pain and hurt and possibly hurt his friends and James. What need did Steven have for a child that didn't take its first break? A child that was the Hydra King's… but that will be a little biased, after all, he did have a child from that monster, a child with a big heart and even big dreams and hopes… a child that was the reason Steven was sane until this moment…
Something, someone, Steven will never know, but someone took a hold of his left arm and pulled him back causing Steven to let out a snarl, fear and distress making itself known, the thoughts of Johann finishing his son and coming after him causing the Omega's heart to drop. "Calm down, foolish queen!" A harsh voice hissed, causing Steven to growl, his mind refusing to put where he had heard that voice before, all his thoughts returning back to his missing child.
Tony sobbed as he listens to his father, growling and glaring at the man as he walked around the room in circles, looking like a cornered animal every second that pass. "Why didn't you tell me?" Tony screamed, taking hold of his hair nearly ripping it out. "What did you get by torturing me?" Sobbed Tony as he whined making his father swallow at that. "Why?" Tony yelled, making Howard flinch.
Compline — around 9 p.m. or before bed
"I did not know that you were capable of making herbal drink without burning it to ashes, princess." The king said as he took the Omega, the blond man was blowing gentle on his drink before taking a sip, humming a little before he throws the Alpha an unimpressed look, which the king pressed his lips tightly at the action, not wanting to start another screaming match with the Omega while the children were asleep.
"Someone like me… huh…" Steve could only whisper, feeling what's left of his heart breaking at the truth Bucky present to him; to think that Steve thought Tony trusted him enough to tell him about his secrets. Steve should have known that Tony would never go for someone like Steve… stupid, idiot, foolish, and still lived in a fairy tale world. Of course Tony would go for someone like Pepper, someone realistic and accomplished.
Hopefully, the next chapter is longer than this.
It wasn't so bad; Tony admit he had underestimated Pepper when she ordered him to do yoga, he thought it will be boring (It was a little) he thought it wouldn't help him calm down, but as soon as Tony stilled on a breathing batter, he took to yoga like a duck to water. It was calming, letting go of everything, stop thinking about everything and just concentrate on the pose he has to hold into for a few minutes before changing it to another one.
The sound of the fallen furniture drew Steven's attention back toward the Alpha; the king who was becoming paler than it was possible for him to come, making Steven think that he is going to be sick, the king whose eyes were so wide that the Omega feared they will never return to their right size again, the king who was muttering some words under his breath, looking like he saw the image of someone who died long ago.
And that was how he knew that Tony was an Omega, but what actually infuriates Tony was how Stane asked his father for his hand in married… more of demand it then asks for it. Tony rage about that, but thankfully his father turned to him and asked for his opinion which was a big fat NO! He wasn't going to mate someone who thinks he can own the world just because he was an Alpha.
Anthony Stark never believed that he will find love, or someone who will acknowledge him as who he was, so he made sure to stop such idiotic fantasies when he reached the age of eighteen, after all, people didn't respect him or acknowledge him for… well, him. The only thing they see when they gaze at him was his father, Howard Stark, the genius of their generation, the billionaire who built his company from scratch, the one who helps creating Captain America AKA Commander of Shield Peggy Carter, Anthony was always in his father's shadow, so he learned after he graduates college to keep his head down and go on with his life, no among of parting, drinking, and acting like a spoiled rich boy will make his father or his peer acknowledge him or even love him.
