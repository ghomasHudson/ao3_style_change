“So don’t talk.”
“Well, Tony, Steve is from a different time. Think about the reputation you have, can’t you see how that would be intimidating to him?” Tony hesitated.
“PDA better not become an issue, you two,” Clint scolded, a slightly disgusted look on his face.
“Before?”
“What’s on your agenda for the rest of the day, Capsicle?” Tony tried to distance himself slightly by using his old nickname for Steve- he wanted to calm the butterflies in his stomach. Steve shrugged, drawing Tony’s attention to the way his gray shirt hugged his chest.
“Good morning, Bruce. Breakfast?” Steve offered him a plate, which he took. Breakfast carried on easily after that, Clint and Thor coming in and leaving as soon as they had eaten, as usual. Tony and Bruce filtered out as well, leaving Natasha and Steve alone.
“You’re welcome, Captain. Shall I tell sir you are coming?”
“Steve Rogers, does someone have a crush?” She smirked, happiness in her voice. “Does someone have a crush on our very own billionaire genius?”
Steve ignored this, waiting for the right time to get closer to Tony. However, a few days later, the choice was no longer Steve’s to make...
“Of course, Steve,” Tony shot a soft smile at him. “If you want me to, of course I’ll stay.”
“Bed?”
I have noticed that I have a habit of switching POV a lot...sorry guys!
“Oh, Steve,” she sighed.
“Nat, I just,” he trailed off, realizing that what she said kind of made sense. “I have no idea how to even go about…any of that.”
“Oh, sorry about that,” he lifted his arm and wrapped it around Tony’s shoulders, his hand gripping Tony’s other arm firmly. “Better?” The reaction was not the awkwardness or polite rejection that he prepared himself for. Tony scooted as close to Steve as possible, and let his previously squished arm fall, his hand resting on Steve’s leg.
The movie started and Tony quickly fell asleep, his body melting into Steve’s. Once the movie ended everyone got up and when their separate ways, and Steve shook Tony awake.
“Tony, it’s okay, it’s really not a big deal.” Tony got out of the bed quickly, and made his way to the door, still muttering about how sorry he was. “Hey, Tony?” he turned around, and Steve thought he saw a glimmer of hope in Tony’s eyes. Steve rose from the bed while he awaited a response.
“Yes, Tony?”
“No need to apologize,” Tony smiled back, “So, what’s on the menu?”
“Hey, Nat,” he greeted, moving to take the lasagna out of the oven. He put it on the top of the stove to cool and turned around to face her, leaning on the counter.
“Hey, Nat,” he continued working out, knowing she would talk no matter what he was doing.
“Nothing,” Steve smiled at him. “Coffee?” Steve poured the black coffee into a huge mug and handed it to Tony, who smiled at him and took it. Steve’s heart started to race at the contact of their fingers.
“Hey, Thor. Can you please just call me Steve?” he requested, tossing Thor an apron.
The next evening, around 8 pm, Steve asked around but it seemed no one had seen Tony all day, which meant he was holed up in his workshop.
“But everyone is there!”
“How?”
“You’re just mad because you don’t like it when Tony calls you Legolas,” Natasha poked at his side with her foot before putting both in his lap, leaning her back against Bruce. Steve noticed this, and made a mental note to ask her about it later. He noticed that there was merely two inches between his leg and Tony’s, so Tony must’ve scooted closer to him. He tried not to read too much into it, but it made his heart flutter anyways. After only about 20 minutes, he couldn’t stand it anymore- his proximity to Tony was making him so nervous, he didn’t know what to do with himself. The way he saw it, his options were to excuse himself, or to make a move, so naturally…
“Steve, just ignore him,” Bruce comforted.
“Nice? What happened?”
“No, he’s not hurt, he’s fine. He’s better than fine, actually. He’s magnificent. He’s the-”
“What you need is some Tony,” she replied, making him blush to the tips of his ears. “Just make a move.”
This is effectively the last chapter, but let me know if I should post a bonus chapter!
“So it finally happened, huh?” Clint boasted, sitting down next to Natasha and taking the plate Steve held out for him.
“I’m just saying, Steve,” she stood up, getting ready to leave, “if you want his attention, and I’m not saying you do, you’re gonna have to work for it.
The next morning when Steve’s internal clock woke him up around 5, as always, Tony’s weight was still heavy on him. It seemed that Tony had not moved at all in the night, an indication of how deeply he was sleeping. Steve didn’t want to wake him, so he slipped out from under him as quietly and smoothly as he could. He went on his run, and when he came back to shower he saw that Tony was still asleep. Steve showered, and when he got out he saw that Tony was beginning to stir, and he dressed quickly and headed to the kitchen so as not to wake him. Natasha was already sitting there, drinking coffee.
“Yes, sir.”
“Right,” Tony nodded, “so yours, huh?”
“How was your night last night?” She smirked at him as soon as everyone was gone.
“Tony?” He tried not to smile when he heard the voice, but it made him feel warm inside.
“I suppose so.”
“You’re welcome,” he started making his way towards the door. “And Tony?”
“Steve, it’s okay. I’m just messing with you. I’m not gonna push, I’m just saying…you’ve seen how Tony operates the last few weeks we’ve been here. He goes a million miles a minute until he crashes, and he stays out only long enough to survive.”
“It’s best not to wake sir in this state, or move him far. I suggest you let him remain where he is, Captain.”
“Sure, could you just come look at this for a minute?” Steve walked over to see what Tony was so intently studying, and when he bent down slightly to look, Tony pulled him into a deep kiss. Steve was almost instantly dizzy with love, and he pulled away to take a breath. “Gotcha,” Tony smirked at him. Steve kissed him again and they became more passionate, and Steve slid his hands under Tony’s ass and lifted him up off the stool he was sitting on to sit him on the workbench so that they were even heights.
“I’m not trying to be cold towards him, Nat, I just…” he trailed off, not sure what to say. Luckily (or unluckily) for him, Natasha was extremely intuitive.
“Natasha?” he asked quietly one day, catching her getting on the elevator. He waited until the door closed to speak.
“What?”
“When was the last time Tony ate?” he questioned, already taking things to make a sandwich from the fridge.
“Yeah, I just figured I’ve got a perfectly good bed right here, no sense in you going all the way upstairs when you’ve already been asleep here for hours.” Steve tried to sound as casual as possible about it all, but the idea of him coming back to shower and seeing Tony asleep in his bed made his heart flutter.
“Makes sense. So, Steve?”
“I didn’t want to wake you or bother you.”
“It’s just so fun, Anthony, I can’t help it,” he said, his voice dripping with sugar-sweet fake innocence.
“Hey, Steve. What can I do for you?”
Steve went over and managed to pick Tony up, one arm under his knees and one under his upper back, holding him close. He carried Tony to the elevator and said nothing when the door closed, knowing Jarvis would just take him to Tony’s floor. All he could think about was how warm Tony’s body felt against him, and how close they were. When the elevator doors opened, Steve saw that it was not Tony’s floor but his, and after he thought for a moment, he decided to go with it.
The following week when movie night approached, he kept in mind what Natasha had said. Again, he made sure to arrive after Tony, and again he took the seat next to him on the couch, but he sat a few inches closer this time. Tony didn’t seem to notice that there were only about six inches between their thighs, but if he did he didn’t seem to mind. About halfway through the movie, Steve put his arm behind Tony’s head while he was laughing and left it there. Tony showed no reaction. Natasha smiled at him from the other couch, however. When the movie had only about 30 minutes left, Steve felt Tony’s weight lean against him. Tony fell asleep, and his head fell to Steve’s chest. Steve’s heart started beating faster, and he looked around to see everyone but Thor looking at him. He turned his attention back to the movie and tried to ignore them as he put his arm around Tony and let his hand rest lightly on Tony’s side. No one said anything, but he could feel their eyes on him from time to time. When the movie ended, Thor stood up first.
“Nat, what are you…” he blushed once again.
“You thought I was Tony? I know. What happened last night?”
“Absolutely,” Steve smiled at him.
“It appears that sir is sleepwalking, Captain Rogers,” JARVIS said without Steve having to ask.
“Your ‘reliable source’…it’s Nat, right? You guys are fucking?” his lips turned up into a smile. Bruce rolled his eyes and turned his attention away from Tony.
“Is he hurt?” Bruce’s voice turned to concern.
“Sorry about that, Ca- uh, Steve. Haven’t gotten much sleep lately,” he rubbed his eyes and stood up, making his way to the elevator. Steve noticed the dark, deep circles under Tony’s eyes and realized just how true that was, worry pooling in his stomach.
"They figured it out?" Steve asked, looking through the pictures that Coulson was looking through. There were a lot of him getting on and off his motorcycle, the circular pack he had for the shield attached to the front of the bike, (the only place it would comfortably fit that wasn't on his back). There were a couple of shots of the pack open, catching the colors. So far he wasn't seeing any of his face, a couple of side shots, but nothing that was clear.
He saw the Avengers, they went down in battle, they fought, like they were expected too. As Tony walked closer he saw a woman slumped over, familiar brown hair falling over her face. Mary had been reaching out to someone, something. When he saw the shield, the familiar shield, lying broken in half on the ground, he fell to his knees next to the body. Tony couldn't breathe, his hands were shaking, but he forced himself to reach out, to check for a pulse.
“You shouldn’t talk about Steve like that,” Tony said with a put upon pout. “He’s not little. Not little at all. Anywh- Oph!” Steve had reached around to poke his side.
The second time that Tony had seen Steve without Peter, he was heading towards SHIELD to meet with Mary and Coulson. Tony had luckily been dressed casually, jeans, a t-shirt, and leather jacket, and had thought enough ahead to cover the glow from the arc reactor. He saw Steve coming out of the building and quickly changed his trajectory to make it look like he wasn't about to head in. It was too late to get away from Steve, as was evidenced when Steve walked over to him.
He went to grab his uniform and frowned. He still hadn't gotten a replacement uniform after the last mission, this one torn at the arm and the back. He slid his arm into the shield straps though. When he walked out of the bedroom, Coulson was throwing him his car keys. Peter's eyes were glued to the TV screen.
"I'm sure Pepper-"
"I'm afraid I can't right now, Sir," Jarvis told his creator. "I'm afraid that the calculations for the new scanners have not been completed."
“The Tower doesn’t have the space, or security, that I’m looking for. I’ve already been shipping the complete suits to Malibu.”
Strange and Wanda had moved to settle on either side of Tony, red light starting to dance around her fingers. “Loki, I could use you over here,” Strange spoke up, attempting to ignore what was happened between the men. “Ms Maximoff is going to go back into his mind, find what we now know to be the weak link between Stark and the being. I will need you, Loki, to confirm that is what we’re dealing with, and I shall isolate it.” Loki stepped closer, nodding.
that I made Steve listen too. I am an unashamed Disney-whore, and I absolutely
Swinging his legs around, Tony pushed himself off the cot then yelped, pulling his feet back up as he splashed water. The ground was full of water, several feet deep, and rapidly rising. Tony grabbed the battery quickly and stood up on the cot before the water crested over the top of it. As he stood up straight his head suddenly slammed against the rock ceiling, and he was pushed down to a hunch. The water was getting higher and he had a battery attached to him, and this time there would be no stopping the water from touching it.
"Which choice is that?" Steve asked. He knew it wasn't the same choices they had discussed in the car, and he had an inkling, but he just wanted to know.
"Yeah, he does," Tony nodded, agreeing. "Do you miss her?" Peter nodded and Tony hugged him just a little tighter. "Yeah, I miss her, too."
Steve saw that this was much toned down, putting on the show for Peter mostly, and charming everyone they came in contact with. This was the positive side of the mask he wore, cheesing it up. But this time, the smile did reach his eyes, and he had eyes for Peter and Jamie. The two have come over to Steve, Peter picking up Jamie as he walked, then held onto her hands when she wiggled to stay standing. As Tony posed with the paid Flynn Rider, both back to back, arms crossed over their chests, he flashed a smile looking right at Steve, and Steve grinned right back at him.
Steve looked back over at the too-pleased-with-herself Jamie. "Alright, we gotta have a talk about throwing food. We don't do it."
Steve snorted. "I think that's a given." He glanced up when he caught Mary's movement, and waved a hand to her.
"That means I would have to start putting crappy music in there," Steve retaliated. Tony let out a soft groan and the blonde smiled. "Guess we have to hope that Mary and Coulson pick good music for their wedding."
Yinsen, that was the man that had saved his life, he was nice. As nice as could be for someone who was also being held captive. The man also had a suit on, and a little part of Tony missed his own suits from back home. Tony worked better without a suit though, clothes that could easily get dirty. But the man had hit a nerve while they were playing their game.
"How did we go from talking about dates, to if Hunters are real?" Steve asked and Tony snorted.
Peter giggled a little and pushed himself up to wrap his arms around Tony's neck. Tony smiled and wrapped his arm around Peter's waist, sitting up. "I've got a snack downstairs for you, and Rhodey is making dinner. How about we eat something, then I'll show you around the house?" Peter nodded, just content to being held for the moment.
“I don’t actually have time to give you a lecture that you’ll no doubt ignore.” Jarvis seemed to be operating enough to give Steve a location of the phone that Hilda was using. Then the signal jumped, showing a different location, then again.
Steve's mouth dropped open a little. Tony had collected all this, preserved it, put it on display, even in a museum, and now he was just giving it away? He let his fingers trail softly against the glass, looking at the stuff, then stopped. There were dog tags, six sets of them.
“I’m gonna go start some coffee,” Tony muttered quickly and pushed away from the counter. “Fuckin’ sap,” Steve heard him mumble under his breath, and he smiled as he went back to shaving.
"It's from Phil," Peter said quietly, but loud enough that Tony jumped a little. They had been sitting in silence for several hours, and he hadn't been expecting peter to talk anytime soon. Tony glanced at Peter, then brought up the message.
"Tony?" Mary blinked when the line was cut. "Jarvis?"
“I also expect you to betray your boyfriend and be on my side.”
"No!" Tony shot up in the bed, eyes wide, heart pounding in his ears.
Tony twitched his nose a little, then poured more tea in the mug for Bruce. "When Cap came to talk to you yesterday, was it awkward?" What kind of opening line was that?
Steve blinked, looking back down at the card in his hand. Tony had generated codes, just for Steve? "When would I need to use the code for SI?" Steve asked softly.
“Tony’s going to call you every horrible nick-name every if she ever adds in the missing sounds,” Steve informed him, bouncing Jamie in his arms. “You thought Buckster was bad?”
"That sounds so cool," Meg said, hands in her pockets. Tony and Steve naturally flanked either side as they walked down the sidewalk. "Astronomy was the only science class that I did well in at University. It was just interesting to me, it didn't feel like I was putting much effort into the class at all."
Peter smiled at her then looked down at Jamie, who was babbling softly in his direction. He wrapped his arms around her middle then picked her up so she was still facing out towards the cameras, then nodded. “Yeah, she’s pretty smart like that. I taught her to be smart like that, though.” That pulled a laugh from both actors, and Steve bit his lip as he smiled before taking some pictures of them. He zoomed in on Peter and Jamie a bit, and knew that that picture would be making its way to his and Tony’s bedroom.
The receptionist typed something in the computer, and Tony knew what was coming. "I'm sorry, Sir, but I don't see-"
Children: Margrit Rosenfeld
"Well, I think I already did this morning," Steve commented. Tony blinked, his eyes blank suddenly. "When I gave you the bracelets."
"He was scared, and I think that scared him even more."
"Kay, Mama!" Peter grabbed his bag, still holding onto his sketchbook and was halfway to his room before he doubled back. "Thank you, Grandma and Grandpa." The doting grandparents peppered him with hugs and kisses before Peter ran back for this room.
"He's the one who hurt Mama?" Peter asked, and Tony nodded a little. Another message.
"Yeah, might as well. Might be a little easier than just popping up." He ran his fingers through Peter's hair, tousling it a little bit. "He needs a haircut. Remind me to bring that up with Mary. How's Cap doing with Jamie?"
"How are the girls, Todd?" Tony asked, pausing a bit at the security station. He stuck his hand out as Todd stood up, both men smiling as their hands met. The single father that Tony had met at the community center before the press conference about Peter, right after the Battle, had indeed called Tony to take him up on the job offer. The Tower was being rebuilt and so Tony offered him a position in the city, and almost a year later the man was working his way up to head of security in the building. He and Happy talked a lot.
"Where's Bruce?" Steve asked him. "And I thought Romanoff and Barton were going to be staying at the Tower this week."
"That wasn't fun for anyone," Tony said.
"I hope we aren't talking about George."
“Maybe I should put you up for one of those shows,” Steve said, and he almost smirked when Tony realized that he was kind of serious. “Getting taught by some amazing chefs, I bet you’d make it all the way to the end. You have the taste buds to recognize good food, you just need a little help on the how of preparing it.”
"Open the new project file, the Mark II," Tony said as he moved to the multiple monitors on his desk.
I tried to be nice them all this chapter too, but I'm fluffing out man. Need to save for one more big fluff-travaganza. :D
He had to admire Steve’s figure though, and the dashing look he cut with his khaki’s, blue button up, and black sport jacket. “Come on, baby girl,” Steve cooed. “It’s just for a night, and you’ll be asleep for most of the night anyway.” Jamie pressed her face to Steve’s neck, and blue eyes caught Tony’s, asking for help. Tony chuckled silently and walked over to them. He kissed Steve lightly then rubbed Jamie’s back.
"Tony?" Oh great, and there was Mary.
"I don't know if I quite agree to bringing someone here," Tony said, looking between the two Asgardians. "I know nothing about this, and it's feeling a little invasive if it has to do with my memories."
"What are you two watching?" Steve asked when he finally able to get a word in.
"You're obviously Episode Four Luke Skywalker," Wade responded, and Peter nodded. They both suddenly dropped back down on the bed, flopping on their stomachs, out of breath.
"I can't." Tony opened his eyes, brown meeting blue. A blue so open, warm, welcoming, that he almost broke down right there and told Steve every shitty thing in his life that he had kept to himself. "Not," Tony pulled in a breath and held onto it for a second before letting it back out. "Not,
“Jamie! No!” The shouting sounded far away, but the desperation was clear.
Mary gasped dramatically, putting her hand over her mouth. "The amazing Agent Phil Coulson doesn't have information? Someone alert the Director! We have to shut down SHIELD!" She laughed when Coulson poked her side. "Careful, I'm your delicate fiancé."
"We'll have to watch her tomorrow, see if she can roll over yet." Tony stayed on the bed, watching Steve rock back and forth gently to lull the baby girl to sleep in his arms first. "If she can roll pretty well, and if she can push away at stuff, like stuffed animals or blankets, then you should be okay. I think I read something about needing to know that they could roll over if they accidentally smush their face into the fabric."
Special Boys Valentine's Day.
"What can you tell us about the attack?" A male voice asked. "And what about those that fought with you?"
“Spoilsport.” Tony sat up a little further in the bed, putting his tablet by his glasses on the bedside table.
"I had a bad dream, Daddy," Peter told him, cuddling up against Tony, his hand on the arc reactor. "You were there, but then you weren't, and I couldn't find you."
Turning back, he headed for the kitchen to get started on some sandwiches for lunch. He groaned a little when he saw a familiar red cloak flapping at him. Dr Strange and Loki were seated on the stools to the kitchen island. “I should be thanking you for waiting a week since our last meeting.” Tony was a lot more cordial this time around, even if he still wasn’t happy to see them. “You’re gaining another shadow there, Doctor, I’d keep an eye on that.”
“Because I don’t want to have to write up a report saying that we lost Iron Man inside of a grocery store.”
Mary lifted up the, very old, clunky, cell phone and flipped it open, putting it to her ear.
"You saw us?" Tony frowned a little.
“But it’s true,” Steve said confidently. “You like the challenge, because you’re always thinking, always creating, always needing that bit to challenge you. Welcoming it because it keeps things, mmm, interesting, I suppose.”
"How is he? Peter, I mean," Pepper asked in a softer voice. "I heard about his Mom, and then Tony having to fight," she trailed off a little.
"When we first met, I was a mess, and you were slightly misogynistic." Tony wrinkled his nose at her words, but didn't deny them. "But in the nearly six years that we have been in each others lives, you have become one of my best friends, Anthony Stark. And that's something I never thought that I would say."
Tony hummed a little and Steve’s attention was drawn back to him. “Ruby,” Tony murmured sleepily. Up above, Ruby lifted her head up. “You need a haircut. We don’t need a repeat of two years ago.” Ruby yawned with a squeak, and that prompted Tony to open his eyes. He first saw Steve smiling at him, Vee cradled in his arms, and the other Gems next to him on the couch, also staring at him. Brave let out a soft caw, that sounded suspiciously like a laugh, and Arc huffed again. Tony slowly sat up, and everything came back to him. He had fallen asleep against Captain America’s pokemon, on his Arcanine to be exact.
"Yeah, there's going to be a discussion about this later." Tony tipped his head back to try and slow the bleeding a bit more, winching as his chest pulled. "I need to put a call signal in the suit," he groaned out. "Last time I took a blow like that, it was from Steve. This guy hits nearly as hard." Not a minute later Steve was pulling up in the car, and jumping out to help Tony into the passenger seat. "I would say that we're not telling Peter or Mary about this."
"Follow me." Tony suddenly change direction, heading down the opposite hallway from the bedrooms. Steve tilted his head in confusion, but followed Tony. He had gone down this hallway, but most of the doors were closed, and he hadn't wanted to try to see if any of them were locked or not, feeling like he might be intruding on something personal.
Tony's expression deadpanned once more. "You have to make pancakes for Rhodey, too. He's here, and he eats a lot!" He called as he headed for the stairs.
"He was doing his job," Steve told him.
Tony made sure that Steve and Peter were occupied as he stepped into the little kitchen area, Jarvis already reading his mind and placing a call. Tony grinned.
"Please tell me you’re going to appeal to my humanity," Loki said, like nothing was wrong. Tony pretended to pour a drink, holding up a glass towards Loki, ready to chuck it at his head. He needed to be smooth for two more seconds. "To bargain for the return of your child."
“If you’re going to make that distinction, then I probably haven’t slept in nearly five weeks,” Tony muttered.
"You do spoil Peter a bit," Mary held up a finger when Tony went to protest, "but, I expected that from you, honestly. I'm just glad that you don't let it get out of hand."
"Yup, that's it, right there." Tony let out a slow breath. "Nothing big, probably stopped bleeding by now."
The ding of the elevator pulled Tony back to the present, and he was moving down the hall. He peeked his head in the gym, or well what was finished of it so far. There were at least punching bags, and a sparring corner set up. As soon as Steve was inside, Tony closed the door and pulled Steve over to him. The blonde stumbled a bit, but Tony was still moving, hands holding onto his shirt, leaning up to press his lips to Steve's.
He wrangled both feet into socks and quickly slid the little shoes on before she could pull them off. Steve held up an elastic headband with a flower on it, and watched her nose scrunch up. He chuckled and tossed it over to the bedside table. "I'm sorry that you're already in danger because of who I am. I made some enemies, and it seems that they didn't disappear when I did. But, I promise that I'm going to try my hardest." He let out a breath then picked her up to hold her in his arms. "I think I have a better appreciation for how Tony feels about wanting to keep Peter safe. Tony is your other dad, and I hope that Peter will be your big brother. He's an amazing kid, one of the best." He dropped a kiss on her forehead and she let her body rest against his chest.
"They treating you alright while they set up something for you?" Tony was sending donations this way, and he wanted to make sure that his money was being put to its fullest extent to help. "Food, clothing, blankets?"
"He's worth it." Mary smiled at Steve's automatic answer.
The Winter Soldier let go and Tony and headed for the door that Tony just came out of. He went to shout at him, but Steve was leaping over the railing, landing between the Soldier and Tony. They two locked eyes, and Steve nodded, before turning back to Tony and running over to him.
"That's good work, Tony," William said, clapping a hand on his arm. "That's real good work. Mary'll be real happy about that when she wakes up." Tony smiled and nodded.
"Captain Sassypants!"
"Sorry, Steve," Mary looked at him, still holding Peter who had grabbed her hand to look at her ring. "We didn't want this to take over your birthday."
Tony was aware that he was suddenly leaving the ground involuntary as Thor picked him. Tony's suit tried to adjust for the sudden downward swing, gears turning quickly, straining, but Tony let out a shout of pain as he was thrown into the ground, barely missing his neck cracked. Thor called the hammer to his hand once again, (a pretty nifty trick if Tony was honest), and was in the middle of a downswing when Tony fired off the boots and gauntlets, sliding between his legs and causing him to go down.
"Yeah, I don't care about that," Tony grumbled.
“I’m certainly going to treat the person I love the way they deserve.” Tony smiled up at Steve when he heard a tiny lilt of Irish in his voice. “I’ll spoil you the way I see fit. And I don’t see you complaining about it.”
"What kind of boy stuff?" Peter asked, looking at his Dad curiously.
"Jamie," Steve said with a smile on his face. "I'm going to name you Jamie. I don't have a middle name for you yet, but, to be fair, you did surprise me." There was a soft knock at Steve's bedroom door and he felt Tony getting up to go answer it. "Named you after my best friend, a guy I know always has my back. I'm gonna try and do right by you, okay?" Her mouth opened and she gave what Steve considered to be an impressive yawn. "So now you're finally tired, huh? You have all that excitement and barely react, but I tell you your name, and you're ready to sack out on me?"
“Buying furniture?”
Jamie’s eyes followed where Peter’s hand was pointing once he had pulled her into his lap, and she let out a gasp as her face lit up. She reached out her arms, kicking her feet out. “Pa!” She exclaimed. “PaPa!” Steve’s eyes widened a little when she repeated herself, repeating his name, his brain finally catching up. He moved further into the room, sliding down to his knees in front of his piled up family, and obligingly reached out to pick up Jamie and cuddled her to his chest. “Papa,” she said contently, resting her head against his shoulder.
"I might make an exception," Tony muttered, and Rachel looked a little smugly at Steve. He turned back towards George, who now looked pleased with himself. "Give me one good reason why I shouldn't call the police, or get the other Avengers in here. They are all here, you know."
Wade tried to pull his head back, but Meg held onto his chin and put the frozen bag of peas on his cheek. He grinned at her as she clicked her tongue. “Your Mom is going to kill us,” she muttered, putting Wade’s hand up to hold the bag.
"Tony," Steve put a hand on Tony's shoulder, but didn't pull him back. It wasn't that Loki didn't deserve it. Thor took the gag back, placing it back over Loki's mouth, for a few minutes not feeling so bad about it, and Tony took a couple steps back. Steve saw Tony glance at his watch and blinked. Tony had been buying them time. He probably hadn't planned on Loki's reaction, but he had tried to start an argument to buy them more time.
Mary handed the tablet back to Bruce, looking back inside the pool room. "He's getting worse," she said softly to the Doctor.
"Daddy!" Tony looked at Peter when he shouted for him, throwing his arms out towards Tony. Tony felt his lip wobble a little and took a big step closer to sweep Peter into his arms, holding him close to him. He felt little shakes in Peter's body, and then he heard the quiet cries. "Daddy, Daddy, Daddy," Peter chanted quietly, his face against Tony's neck.
“Go get the kids,” she told him instead. “I’ve got enough for them, and I’m working on the last batch.”
Peter shook his head in the negative this time as Mary let go to let Coulson pick him up. "No, brave like Daddy."
"Is stronger than anything you've ever encountered," Tony threw at him. He could feel Peter's hand gripping the back of Tony's shirt.
"Tony? Can you hear me?" Steve moved his hand to his chest, his breathing still strong, and felt and heard the moan of pain coming from the genius.
Steve frowned and they vaguely heard the nurse leaving, closing the door again. "What do you mean? They're not with the Avengers." Bucky straightened and left the bathroom, whispering a question to the woman in the bed. Steve stepped out as Bucky was already moving, Meg looking a little pale.
Sleep over, and new plans.
“What is Strange doing to help him?” Mary said immediately, moving over to the bed. She slipped on the bed next to him, brushing the hair from Tony’s head. “When is he going to wake up?”
"How many does she already have?" Tony asked, raised an eyebrow at the little girl. She seemed to have a devious glint in her eye.
"I will," Tony said, licking his lips. "I've just got a couple more things to take care of."
"That's what Ma used," Steve said as he double checked that he had put on the diaper right. Jamie was starting to kick her legs about as he fumbled a little. Tony smirked a little when he heard the Brooklyn accent pop a little. "It's what Buck's sister used, too."
Tony had his phone clutched in his hand, legs dangling off the bed, when Steve walked in silently to his bedroom. It was almost four in the morning, but he couldn't help but smiled when he saw him. They had been texting several hours earlier, and now he knew why Tony stopped.
"I could always get Coulson over there," Natasha said quietly in his ear, comm unit on. She always knew what he was thinking about.
"Consider done," Tony told her. "In the morning we'll get everything settled away. Todd's really good with kids, too. He's got two girls that are around Peter and Wade's ages, and Wade already knows him."
Tony reached for the emergency latches and peeled himself out of the suit as quickly as he could. As long as he was here, he could disable the disruptor. Tony stood up and scrambled over to the machine, circling it once before he got down on his knees, crawling underneath, to find the main hatch inside. He took a deep breath before reaching up to open it.
Tony started to wrap the whip around his arm, then around his body. He could feel the electricity moving through him now, the suit becoming a nice little conductor, which shouldn't have been possible. He moved closer and closer to the man, until he was right there, in front of him, with no more room to move his whip. Tony swung his left fist, hitting the mans side, then swung the ride, hitting his jaw, and his left again to connect with his gut. Tony threw the man to the ground, the whips becoming loose enough to slid off, and he walked over, grabbing the power supply from the mans chest.
"Yes, and I'm not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy." Tony looked between Bruce and Natasha, sliding off the counter he had been sitting on. Something didn't feel right in the back of his mind. "I'd like to know why SHIELD is using the tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction."
"Sir, Colonel Rhodes is arriving," Jarvis said, bringing up the camera view of outside the front door.
“Oh yeah,” Tony said with a nod. “He liked it, said it felt like a good different. Jarvis runs regular scans on it, probably will for the first year or so, just to make sure that there are no negative side effects, or that the element does fail or start to degrade ahead of schedule.”
"That must have been interesting, to hear what Howard had to say," Steve commented. He had probably meant for it to be an innocent sentence. Tony had been avoiding this very topic since he found out that this was Captain America, and he himself had inadvertently brought them directly there. Tony made a decision.
The next chapter will have more happiness, i promise!
"It's his M.O. isn't it?" Bruce looked around at them. Tony looked at him, something feeling off, but he just couldn't put a finger on it. "I mean, what are we, a team? No, no, no," he shook his head. "We're a chemical mixture, we're a time bomb."
Steve blinked, staring at Tony. He didn't know that a human could actually talk that fast. He was surprised that he was even able to keep up with everything that he said, even with the Serum. "I'm usually here?" This Tony was naturally charming, and disarming, and hostile, all at the same time. This wouldn't stop Steve though, not from learning more about this man. Was this really the same man that he had talked through a panic attack?
“Shield has lost an Infinity stone??” Steve took a step back from the magician. “How was it lost, and who has it?!”
"I do," Tony said. "Almost everyone that I let in betrays me, they hurt me, and I had to learn early on how to protect myself."
"I'm going to be okay, Rachel," Tony told her. He raised an eyebrow when he heard low level singing, queuing in on the song playing. "May have gotten a shit hand dealt to me this week, but, I think I just got a new deck, and it's looking more favorable."
Pepper pulled out her Starkpad. "What position do I need to secure?" She asked simply. Steve turned a confused expression to her, then back over to Tony.
The woman stepped up to Loki, pressing two fingers to his forehead, and his own memories started to play around them like a hologram. Tony felt dread snake through him when he realized that they others must have seen everything, just like they were seeing Loki's memories. Tony dug his nails into his leg a little when he saw the familiar hand of an alien approach Loki, then he forced himself to look away.
"I've currently managed to contain him inside of his room, but I'm sure that he'll be out in mere moments once he realizes the doors are locked." Steve wondered about this Jarvis actually being a robot.
He still held true to the fact that Steve's lips were soft, softer than they had any right to be, but there was always passion behind his kisses, a sense of purpose. Tony's lips were not nearly as soft, years of biting and licking out of habit while he worked, and even the months of torture in a cave had taken their toll on Tony's lips. He regularly pulled skin off, never regularly used chap stick, and he let them bleed sometimes if he pulled a little more than usual. It was all habit.
"Nothing definitive," Coulson said carefully.
"What happened?" Tony looked between the three that were around him. "Please tell me no one kissed me." Steve almost blushed, almost felt the little bit of heat climbing up his neck when Tony looked at him with that sentence.
“Not discounting the romantic getaway that he took you on,” Bucky mumbled loudly, setting up a puzzle table for the twins.
"Uh," Tony glanced around, wincing when he moved his shoulder. "I was working on the suit, but I messed up the calibrations on the assembly unit. Just wanted to run some tests." He glanced down at his arm, saw the angry red of the wire burn. "Put it into manual mode and hopped in."
"They're trying to recreate a Serum," Tony bit out, back to looking at the equations. Equations that were turning into formulas. Bruce had included the samples taken from the animals several months ago, and compared them to the sample. Tony could practically feel Steve's dark look, and was glad it wasn't actually being directed at him. "They're trying to make an army, and the fastest way to do that, is through cloning."
“You seem very informed,” Tony commented to him. “Like, someone gave you a briefing packet, but I know that a lot of that wasn’t written in Natasha’s assessment of me last year.”
"It's not just a dance, though," Mary said, not unkindly. "You're you, Tony, everybody knows who you are, and how you are with women."
"Yes, Mom put a birthday hat on the birthday boy." She called out, pulling the straps to tie the garbage bag shut. Tony snorted a little and sat down across from Pete on the floor. The now one year old clapped his hands, grinning at Tony, then put his hands on the coffee table, pulling himself up.
"He's supposed to have manners, I don't know what happened," Tony shrugged a little. "But people were supposed to have taste in music, as well."
Tony put him down, but took his hand, walking over to the different displays. "Yeah, it is. I was a big fan when I was a kid, and I collected everything." Peter got as close as he could to the glass, seeing a large collection of comic books. "Did you know that my Dad actually knew Captain America?"
"SHIELD medical," Coulson responded.
"Well, there's a note in there from the Director, Fury. Says that Howard thought I was the only one with the means and know-how to finish what he started." Tony wrinkled his nose a little, thinking about the note.
All the pieces of the suit started to move, making sure that nothing scraped, everything locked together, worked how it needed to be. "Test complete. Preparing to power down and begin diagnostics." The screen started to minimize itself, and Tony knew that soon the armor station would reappear. Nope.
"I am Not-"
“Do you have any kind of news?” Steve asked. He wanted to reach out to hold onto Tony, but wasn’t sure if it was safe. He was still suspended in the air.
"No," Mary said and Steve blinked. He had been ready for excuses right away, not the straight look and confident denial. "I was wondering how long until you would figure it out, but no." She shook her head. "It wasn't pertinent to the information that you would need after waking up, or working for SHIELD."
“Ooo, aren’t you a luck man,” Tony smirked a little at him. “You must be dating a very successful man. Loaded with lots of money.”
"I don't care," Tony growled, not taking his eyes off of George. He had a startled look when he thought that Tony was going to charge him, but looked smug again when Steve stopped him. "I want to hit something, and there's something in front of me."
Tony makes a visit, Steve talks out loud, they go shopping, and Peter comes home.
"That's exactly what we don't need right now," Tony groaned and Mary nodded. "Did you ever meet Julie's ex-husband?" Mary shook her head no. "Welp, that's good."
"The way songs are being added seem to be erratic," Jarvis continued. Bruce looked at Tony.
“I’m going to be sick,” Bucky said, putting the back of his hand to his mouth. “Let’s get out of here before you two start, kissing, or something.”
“Says the man who announced to the world that he was no longer single, by being in costume,” Mary informed him. “I think your reasons hold no water.”
And if Tony Stark could bend the knee, so could he.
I urge you to look up all the 'World's Largest' objects in Casey, Illinois. I love them all.
“Oh, come on,” Clint scoffed. “I haven’t done shit.”
Tony ran a hand through his hair, rushing over to her. “Uhh, hi there.”
“Clint, we gotta get out of here!” Bucky cried, tugging harder at his friend. The cops were getting closer, hands reaching down to draw their weapons.
“And you’ll get what’s coming to you,” Loki hissed in return. “I’ll make sure of it.”
Barton looked pale. “You want to blow this place?”
Tony jolted, Phil’s words echoing in his skull. What the hell was he doing, making out with Steve like a teenager?
“What’s not to say I wanted to be the one to take your life,” shrugged the Captain.
“Yes, Bucky, I saw.”
Loki just found himself nodding, following Barton’s lead. They took the long way around to avoid Barnes and the over men, but soon the stairs were back in sight. The two men raced back down, Barton leading Loki into the dark caverns underneath the base.
Brb, still processing Civil War feels. (don't worry, this will be spoiler free)
“Beattie?” Natasha asked.
Steve saw Stark roll his eyes. “Here we go again, with this being my fault.”
"No, that's not possible." Pepper shook her head, biting her lip. “You don’t understand. Tony built all of our firewalls. Not even the Pentagon can crack through them; believe me, they’ve tried. There’s no way some second-rate mobsters managed to hack into a Stark Industries account, let alone Tony’s.”
“We already have sheets.”
“That’s the spirit,” Tony agreed, turning upon hearing Pepper walk into the lab. He could see the slight falter in her step as she glanced from Tony to Barnes. Tony knew that Pepper was distrustful of The Commandos – the redhead had a more protective streak than Rhodey – but there was no time to dwell on that now. Pepper, ever the professional, opted to ignore Barnes, and head straight for Tony.
With a sweep of his legs, Rumlow ended up on the ground. Steve grabbed his shield, and thrust it into Rumlow’s chest, the force stopping his heart.
He leaned up, catching an eye of his old reactor, sitting what seemed like miles away. For a moment, he was two years old, staring up in wonder at his father’s workshop for the very first time.
Bucky dragged him back out until the hallway. “Pick a room, any room. I may or may not have gone above and beyond my duty and brought you six choices.”
Steve took off into a sprint, retracing his steps until he found his way back to his car. Typing in his destination to his GPS, Steve put the car back in auto-drive as he changed back into his tux.
“Then you must be mad. Did you miss everything I just said?”
“He isn’t, or wasn’t, according to our knowledge.” Steve could feel the heat of Hill’s glare. “But apparently we were wrong. SHIELD was under the impression that Pepper Potts was the only one injected with Extremis in Malibu. Was Stark lying?”
Tony gaped at the teacher. “Then how do you know it was him?”
“Yep.”
“You’re already ba-
“Shouldn’t you be in bed?”
Stark hissed as he tried to dodge out of Steve’s grip, only to end up stumbling forward towards the ground again. Steve reached out immediately, catching the falling man for about the tenth time that night.
“Put on the suit?”
"How is he?"
This was what he needed. This was safe.
Pietro shot him a blank look. “We’re the only twins you know.”
“JARVIS, it’s me, let me in,” Steve said to the door, placing his thumb over the scanner. Upon getting no response, Steve leaned closer. “Codename Captain America,” he continued slowly. “Come on, JARVIS.”
“Wilson, I need to speak to Rogers. Alone.”
Steve pulled a walkie-talkie up to his mouth.
more than he ever should have. Including the knowledge of what Steve looked like.
Tony laughed. “I’m sorry?”
seemed to be the only thing he needed.
That photo shouldn't exist; it
There was no flash, no shine. In fact, there wasn’t a single shade of gray at all. Steve was meant with pale blues and soft tans. There was plush furniture adorning the living room that almost looked mismatched, but extremely comfortable.
Rhodey rushed over and grabbed at Tony. "What the hell are you doing in here? Everyone's been going crazy, man; We all thought you got kidnapped again!"
He wasn’t sure why he let himself hope for a miracle that he knew wasn’t coming. The machine had just barely begun to beep before Steve whispered a quick
“You’re going to regret this,” Pierce stated. “You don’t want us as an enemy.”
“It’s a hell of a lot more effective than your way,” Tony snorted.
“The only thing we can do. Bruce and I will stay with Steve to see if we can get him talking. Everybody else, you need to start canvasing. Get in touch with your contacts and find us something useful. Got it?”
Another hand pressed against his forehead, shaking as it brushed lightly through his hair. “Buck?” he heard.
“Commissioner Nicolas Fury. If you’re not too busy, I’m going to need you to come down to the station with me.”
Barnes’ lips formed a grim line. “Steve always saw the best in people; that’s why I don’t think he ever said anything, let alone even notice. But Howard…he always talked about Steve as his.
Tony froze. “You what? You trusted that asshole enough to tell him about Pierce? What if he’s with HYDRA?”
Steve furrowed his brow. “What could anyone gain from this? Watching us run around like a chicken with its head cut off?”
Steve nodded, bringing a hand up to trail through Tony’s dark locks. He could still feel leftover plaster from the past explosions. Steve couldn’t help but tighten his hold on Tony.
Steve nodded. “Yeah.”
Tony nodded, but forced his eyes away from Steve. Acting on impulse, Steve reached over and grabbed Tony’s shoulder. “It’s not that I don’t wanna tell you, Tony. It’s just. It’s…it’s- ”
“Maybe you aren’t the only one with their hands in the NYPD.”
you? Waiting for the off chance that you’d set shot up with something so we could bench press the same weight?”
a static voice replied.

“The usual?”
“Clint,” Steve whispered again, sweeping the archer into a tight hug.
Tony, it worked flawlessly.”
His Ma used to tell him that life was like a painting. A fresh canvas that slowly worked its way into a beautiful image. That the colors were remnants of memories; warm and cold, happy and sad. Sometimes, the experiences mixed together to create a brand new color. She said that as the painter, Steve could chose whatever colors he wanted, chose whatever life he wanted. That every painting was just a little bit different than the rest, so Steve was the only one who could choose what would make him happy. And that even though it might not look like much at some points, one day he’d realize that he had been creating a masterpiece the entire time.
“Where. Are. You.”
Steve shook his head. “Not until the job’s done.”
Tony shot a fierce grin over his shoulder as he charged up the stairs. “You wouldn’t have it any other way, Cap.”
Tony shifted uncomfortably on the couch. “You already seem to know the answer to these questions.”
“Splendor is one word for it,” Tony muttered into his mug.
The inside of their base was torn to shreds. The usually bright walls were littered with soot, the walls that managed to survive the blast, that is.
“If you already know about Pierce, then why the hell haven’t you done something about him?” Tony grit out.
“I could hear you breathing all the way across the yard,” a smooth voice sounded behind him. “Out of breath already, old man?”
“And they are,” Tony added, looking back at Bucky. “I’ve already scanned through the FBI servers. Everyone’s fine.”
There was a short silence, Steve no doubt trying to think of anything that could have happened in the span of leaving the building and walking to the car. “Tony?” he prompted.
-------------------------
Steve thought.
Steve watched as the children agreed, but warily looked back at the two of them as they passed.
Sam blinked.
“This is not the Jericho,” Yinsen murmured.
“So,” Steve huffed. “Dinner first, hopefully with a nice dessert,” he stated, with a deep kiss to Tony.
“Fuck,” Clint heard Bucky groan.
“He’s going to the gala for the Maria Stark Foundation.” Steve frowned.
Steve shrugged. “Is it working?”
Bucky shrugged. “I think we’ve still got some pasta in the cupboards. Besides, Nat’s coming over tonight, and if I pout long enough, she’ll buy us Chinese.”
“Stark, duck!”
There, sitting in the middle of the room with the biggest shit-eating grin known to man, was Tony Stark.
A static laugh came through the phone.
2. Mackenzie Foster - Lust
“Thanks, Pepper,” Steve smiled.
“Well, I’ve actually been around for a while- ”
“No, no, I’m fine. Steve, look at me, I’m alright.” He pulled away slightly just so he could look up at the blonde, trying to give him a winning smile.
Tony giggled, looking through the other items in the cooler. “And marshmallows?” he asked slowly. “Never really thought about them going with cheeseburgers, before.”
-------------------------
Sure enough, his old mob didn’t let him down.
Tony looked down, tapping a forgotten tune against Steve’s sternum with his fingers. “We still could.”
“If you’re cooking, absolutely,” Steve replied. “Ratatouille?”
“Well,” Steve sighed. “I have to tell Clint about Phil. And I’m not sure it’s a good idea that you be around when I tell him.”
“This doesn’t make any sense.” Sam’s voice cut through the silence.
Loki grinned. “So I know where it is. And I know how to get back in.”
“No. You do what you do to keep people safe. He had people killed, Phil. You saw what happened to that CI! I wasn’t about to risk that happening to you.”
Steve and Tony arrived at the realization at the same time, both men struggling against their binds.
“What you need to do is get your ass over here.
“You’re kidding me, right?” snapped Stark, as he threw Steve another clip. “You were using a barrel lid for cover, Cap.
“But it’s true,” Bucky almost whined.
"I did some digging; came across something you might find interesting." Stark pulled out his phone, before looking around the office. "You got a TV in here?"
“Three.”
Tony narrowed his eyes at the general direction at Steve. He opened his mouth to snap back when Pietro made another snide comment. “She’d eat if Vision told her too.”
“You fucking cockroach,” Bucky hissed to his left.
“Captain,” the man drawled, not even looking up from his apple.
It was quiet except for the sound of silverware hitting plates, sometimes a glass setting down on the table. Well, that, and the constant humming that Tony was making as he tried to feed Peter his dinner.
“Fine, then I’ll ignore it.” The pair waited until the call would eventually lead to a voicemail and the ringing would cease. But it didn’t.
“Loki’s bad news. You know it, I know it.”
“Well, obviously he’s chosen the other side!”
Every day he looked at that bag. Every day, weighing his chances. There had even been a few instances where he’d picked it up and brought it to the front door. But he never crossed the threshold. He could never make those final steps.
Phil just shot him a blank look. “You know that won’t work.”
Clint frowned, pressing the phone closer to his ear. Above him, the sky was a bleak gray, an ominous warning of the storms to come. “It’s getting really busy over there, isn’t it?”
“Nothing, don’t worry about it,” Tony responded to Steve, eyes narrowed in challenge at Bucky.
“Thank god,” Tony grinned at him, a hint of mischief in his eyes. Steve’s head shot up to meet Tony’s gaze.
“Steve?” he turned around to face her, and she smiled at him and eyed the mug.
“Good morning,” he offered, getting a pan out to make eggs.
They had never really had a serious conversation, other than when Steve had his panic attack the previous night. Tony wondered if that had sparked something in Steve that made him think about his past and open up, and he was thrilled that Steve wanted to open up to him. He reached across the table and put is hand on Steve’s, just for a minute, and gave Steve a warm smile.
“Steve, why didn’t you wake me? I could’ve helped. Panic attacks aren’t exactly foreign to me.”
“Yes, Tony. Thank you for everything,” Steve laid down, too, so Tony let his eyes close. Before he was fully drifted off, he felt Steve’s head fall onto his chest, and he breathed in the familiar scent while Steve pulled Tony closer to him. Before he could think better of it, Tony kissed the top of Steve’s head, which was undeniably drenched in sweat.
“That’s it? Did you cuddle?” Steve blushed and looked down.
“Let’s just say I heard from a very…reliable source, who happens to be close with Steve, that maybe you’re not the only one having these feelings.”
“Sure thing. Steve.” Steve left with a smile on his face that stayed there the rest of the night, and he didn’t let himself wonder why.
“Yes?”
“Mr. Stark is currently in his workshop, he has not slept in approximately 25 hours.” Steve looked back to Natasha and sighed.
“Right,” Steve chuckled, remembering that Tony hadn’t been conscious for any of it. “Nat called me, you fell asleep in your workshop. She figured maybe you should sleep in a real bed.”
“How may I assist you, Captain Rogers?”
Hey guys! I'm so glad people seem to be enjoying the story. Here's the next chapter, as promised! Let me know what you think!
“First of all, I never said anything about you being friends with Tony. It’s kind of obvious that’s not exactly what you have in mind," Steve blushed to the tips of his ears, and she continued. "But if you were looking to do that, I would say start small. Take him an apple when he’s in his workshop for a long time. Sit next to him at movie night.” Steve felt perplexed.
Tony felt himself slowly waking up, but willed his eyes to stay shut just a few minutes longer. He felt more well-rested than he had in ages. He felt incredibly warm, then realized he seemed to be laying on something warm- quite unlike the cold metal of his workbench where he usually ended up sleeping (typically face-down in a pile of papers or amidst a scattered mess of tools). He opened his eyes and realized what he was laying on was another person- Steve. Steve was just laying there, his arm around Tony, looking at him.
“Sorry, Captain Emotional!” Clint bellowed after him, after which Steve only heard Clint’s laughter and Natasha and Bruce’s scolding. It was good to know that they cared, and he knew Clint was just joking. He was mad at himself for letting it affect him, but nevertheless he couldn’t sleep. After tossing and turning and dozing in and out for a few hours, he got up and ran until it was time to make breakfast. Natasha was the first one to the kitchen.
“I think I can deal with that.”
"Well he's definitely your boyfriend now," Natasha smiled slightly at him, Clint already out of the room. Steve was still having trouble finding words, so he just smiled.
“And the cuddling?” Tony questioned, looking nervous to hear the answer.
“Wait! You two are together? This is magnificent, my friends, we must celebrate!” Thor beamed, clapping Bruce on the back. He smiled uncomfortably and Natasha just chuckled and ignored Thor, turning her attention to Tony.
“Finally, we can leave and stop watching Steve ogle at Stark like a schoolgirl in love,” Clint spoke up, resulting in Natasha jabbing him in the side with her elbow. Steve went pink and stood up to leave the room.
“I seem to be making a lot of exceptions for you,” Tony chided with a raised eyebrow.
"I really am fine.”
“It’s too dangerous,” Steve argued, pushing himself further up the bed, his icepack falling onto the floor. Tony huffed, reaching down to pick it up, placing it back where it should be, resting on Steve’s knee.
“Tony,” Steve sighed. “It’s a family thing; we’ll all be together,” argued Steve. “We’ll be creating memories for Peter.”
Even working halfway around the world didn’t change anything. Which is how they ended up in the back room of some police station in Belarus, discussing with Fury about what had transpired. Or at least, that’s what Steve had assumed they were talking about, as he was more interested in the clock. And replaying the image of a sweaty, grimy Tony in his sinful flight suit, handing kittens off to an officer with strict instructions to deliver them to an animal shelter, as if he’d just found them on the street instead of overhead pressing fallen ceiling like it was nothing to save them.
“I have time right now,” he responded, already on his feet. Tony stood up and they walked away swiftly chattering about science things that no one else understood. Clint had slipped out as soon as he was done eating, so that just left Natasha and Steve. Steve picked up Tony’s untouched plate of food and sighed, covering it over with plastic wrap and putting it in the fridge.
“I was embarrassed,” Steve admitted, looking at Tony with those puppy dog baby blues that made him melt.
“Tony, you should really get some sleep.”
“He’s probably asleep, don’t overthink this.”
“No thanks JARVIS, I want to surprise him.”
“Believe me, there’s no need to apologize,” Tony’s words made him blush. “You should probably get to bed, though. It’s late.” Everyone else had already left the room and went to bed.
“Good morning, Bruce. I have some things I’d like to show you in the workshop, if you have time,” Tony urged, making Bruce put his paper down altogether.
“Yeah, why?” Steve was relieved that she didn’t make a big deal about the panic attacks.
“So you’re telling me that Steve likes me, too?”
“Grand idea!” Thor boomed and left the room quickly but not at all quietly.
“Steve, what are you doing?” She demanded once they were in the kitchen.
“Bruce, can I talk to you?” He demanded, breathless, barging into the room without knocking.
This is all for this story, I hope everyone enjoyed it! Keep an eye out for more, and if anyone has any topic requests comment them below :-)
Clint said “So many things” at the same time that Tony said “Nothing.” Tony played the movie before anyone else could comment.
“Before I became,” he gestured to his body, continuing to talk, “you know, this, I had a pretty normal life. I was just a scrawny kid who went to school and got in fights. My mom loved to cook but we didn’t have much money for food, so I guess when I cook it just feels like a piece of who I used to be, somehow.” He stared at his cup that was sitting on the table in front of him, and didn’t meet Tony’s eyes.
“You’re such an ass, Clinton.” Tony sneered, putting his fingers on the bridge of his nose in annoyance. Within minutes, Natasha and Bruce came in together, naturally.
“Don’t be so surprised,” Steve chuckled. “I make breakfast every morning, Tones,” Steve reminded him in a teasing tone, looking nervous about the nickname- he had never called Tony that before. It made Tony’s heart race, but he tried to stay calm.
When he awoke very early the next morning, Tony was still asleep on him, so he gently shook him awake.
“Tony, I’m so sorry,” he avoided making eye contact, and his voice sounded exhausted.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he sounded genuine, and looked flustered.
“Not sex, idiot,” she scolded, making Bruce chuckle. “Tony’s not used to having people around. Why do you think he wanted us to move in?”
“I was sleepwalking last night apparently, and I woke up in his bed cuddling him, and this is hell, Bruce. Steve is never going to go for a guy like me. He’s the moral compass of the nation, and I’m Satan.” Bruce smiled and sat down.
“Friends,” he greeted them as he plopped down. He put his hand on Steve’s leg but took it off after only a few seconds, reaching forward and grabbing his plate.
“Tony?”
Tony awoke to a noise, quickly taking in his surroundings. He was in Steve’s bed yet again, and the noise he heard was heavy breathing. The blankets were pulled completely off of him, and he sat up to see Steve, sweating and shivering, with a far-off look in his eyes. His breathing was ragged and uneven, and he was clenching the blanket so hard that his knuckles were white.
Steve ignored it for weeks. After his conversation with Natasha, he started to realize just how much he really did want Tony’s attention, and that realization made him nervous. He didn’t know why- he and Tony weren’t friends. Acquaintances, maybe. Housemates. But they had nothing in common. Steve started to run longer and harder, and tried his very best to think about anything but Tony. After about three weeks had passed, he couldn’t ignore it anymore. He wasn’t sure what it was he was after, but he figured maybe just talking to Tony would do the trick. That being said, he couldn’t think of a valid reason to approach him- everything seemed forced.
“Finally,” Natasha smiled, giving a small nod to Steve.
“Yes, sir.” Steve was completely confused, but he headed to the workshop in a hurry. Natasha was standing outside the door when he stepped out of the elevator.
The Avengers were a team, but they weren’t necessarily friends. Despite this, after everything that happened with Loki, Tony had asked the rest of the Avengers to live in his tower. Partially because he wanted them to be together in case something else happened, but mostly because he didn’t want to be alone. To them, however, he would never admit this. He just told them it was for safety purposes- that it had been Fury’s idea, that Pepper had nagged him about it until he gave in. Pepper knew how much he wanted them there, how much it would benefit him to have people around, so she kept quiet about it. He gave each of them their own floor in the Tower, and in the middle was the communal floor- kitchen, living room, laundry, gym. Tony tried to think of everything he could put on that floor so that they would want to spend time there.
“Well that was a bit of a bummer,” Tony sighed, a small smile on his face. “Things were starting to get so good.”
"Steve, you're going to wear a hole through the floor." Steve looked up, mid pace, to see Tony smirking at him, the man casually draped against a wall.
Tony hissed in his head.
“You gonna stop me?” Tony retorted.
Clint nodded tersely. He should have known that the rest of the team would have been rearing to go as well. Despite their extremely shaky start, the team was now closer than most families, probably teetering on the path of codependency. If one of them fell, they all did.  “Then we better find this guy fast before things get out of hand.”
“Man, shut the hell up,” Sam snapped, delivering a stomping kick to the man’s chest, sending Ward flying over Fury’s couch. He shot a quick look over at Natasha. “You good?”
Coulson bit his lip, looking away. “Fury was able to piece together my involvement with The Commandos. He’s knows I was in their pocket.”
“Now what?” Steve asked.
Hiding it is.
“Um, should we help?” Bucky asked, wide eyes still gaping at Tony.
Silence descended on the pair and Steve’s smile slipped away. “What?” she asked.
Steve’s hands trembled as he poured another glass of whiskey. It was quiet, the only sounds coming from the bottle hitting the glass tumbler.
Steve watched as Tony continued over to Bucky to give him the same treatment. “Want me to pull the fire alarm so you don’t have to sit through the whole meeting?”
"It could have been a lot worse," Obie sighed.
Delmar had given them nothing. Just the usual ‘Hail HYDRA’. Just enough to ruffle their feathers. But he had trained for this. He wouldn’t let the rest of the organization down. The Avengers would get nothing from him.
And with that, Tony walked out the door and out of The Captain’s life.
“Come on out, Pietro,” Tony replied wearily. “You too, Wanda.”
Engineering is hard.
Steve chuckled, squeezing at Sam’s shoulder. “I’ll do you one better. Next time I visit, I’ll use the front door and take you back home. Square deal?”
had a plan,” The Captain corrected. “I liked my plan better.”
It was too fast, too loud,
Tony smirked, eyeing a clearly nervous Barton. “And you’re supposed to have the best eyes around here. That’s embarrassing.”
Tony shrugged, ignoring the long list of reasons why that listed in his head. “Just an upgraded unit, swapping out the old for the new. But, I’ve run into a little bit of a speed bump. There’s an exposed wire under this device,” he said, tapping at his chest. “It’s contacting the socket wall and causing a little bit of a short.”
“Dad, you’re doing it again,” Pietro sighed.
“Obie,” he said breathlessly, trying to cover it up. “What the hell are you doing here?”
," Tony paused, taking another shaking breath. "I realized that I was part of a system that is comfortable with zero accountability. I had my eyes opened. And I- "
A man slipped his lanky fingers through a greasy mop of hair. He tightened his grip on his package as he waited for the elevator.
“Anything. The stars.”
“It doesn’t matter now,” Pierce continued. “We’ll adapt.”
Tony rolled his eyes. “I didn’t sign on to be your therapist, Barnes. Yes, you lost an arm. Yes, it sucks. But if any of the stories are true about you, then you and I both know that you don’t need both of your hands to kill someone. Besides, you shouldn’t be saying shit like that anyway; your other half might wring your neck.”
Steve opened his eyes long enough to see the red that dripped down onto the charred ground below him. Taking a shaking and already cut up hand, Steve dragged it across his head only for it to come back more bloody. Trying to move his aching body was futile as well; the jarring movement shot pain coursing through his body, almost causing him to lose consciousness again. Steve looked around, but saw nothing but endless walls of fire and smoke, threatening to close in around him.
“Oh my god, you’re adorable. Is this how you asked everyone else to join your super-secret boy band?”
Steve startled, staring at the redhead in confusion. He knew Tony's speakeasy was a secret, but by the way he'd write odes to Pepper, Steve just assumed that she would have been made privy.
Looking past The Captain, Tony looked at his car.
he almost whimpered, raw betrayal crossing over his features.
Tony breathed a sigh of relief. He was safe. For now.
“You wouldn’t.”
“Still think this is a prank, or do I pass muster?”
It was Saturday, podcast day, and Steve was on edge. He knew he was meant to do something today, but he still hadn’t figured out what yet. Fury hadn’t called back since their initial meeting, leaving Steve to wonder if the conversation they had was even real.
Steve cursed. “Fine. Move.” Throwing Bucky out of the way, Steve removed his floor carpet, revealing a safe. He quickly typed in his passcode, opening the vault. He helped Bucky inside, locked it back up, and replaced the rug.
“That being said,” Steve continued patiently. “We’re going to have to take some precautions in the future until this problem is resolved.”
Tony jumped, spilling coffee on his shirt. “Jesus, Romanoff, warn a guy.”
“Anything?” Steve asked, walking up to the hulking blonde.
They stumbled, Steve catching Rhodes with one arm and the railing with the other before the both of them went crashing to the floor. The floor was trembling, as if an earthquake was approaching, the lights above them shaking like leaves in the wind, dust and plaster from the ceiling falling through the light rays.
“Immunity,” Steve answered quickly. “For us and the whole crew. And that includes Phil.”
Tony crossed his arms. “Is that a question or a statement?”
Hesitantly, Tony laid a hand on Steve’s forehead, happy to find some warmth finally reach back at him. Without thinking, he slowly pushed his hand farther back, pushing through the barely damp stands of Steve’s soft hair. He sighed, before leaning against the wall, letting gravity do the rest as he slipped down to the floor, making sure his hand still rest in Steve’s hair. After staring for long moments at the steady rise and fall of Steve’s chest, Tony finally felt his eyes slip shut.
“I thought you were dead! And don’t give me any of that ‘let me teach you a lesson’ bullshit. You are no better than me Tony Stark, and if you think for one minute that you wouldn’t go off the handle if you thought you lost one of your own, then you- ”
The clock was mocking him. It was broken, it had been when they’d walked into the room, but Steve couldn’t look away. Couldn’t stop looking at the second hand jerking back and forth, indefinitely forced to replay the same moment in time over and over again. It was a true reflection of the meeting they were in. It was Steve himself that had instituted immediate debriefs after missions – assuming no life-threatening injuries.
Tony paced in his office, pondering over everything that had happened. Even he couldn’t deny it anymore; HYDRA was out there. And they meant business. The real question now was how far Tony was willing to go to get rid of them. The Captain took care of them once; surely he could do it again. But he'd seen his face down in the basement. The Captain obviously wasn't the most forthcoming about what had happened the first time he'd faced off with HYDRA, but seeing him so distraught already didn't sit well with Tony. If anything, it bolstered the fact that they needed to care of this problem as soon as possible.
The group of men turned towards the sound of the voice. There, Jo Schmidt was standing silhouetted in the bank’s broken window. Schmidt ran over to Steve, bouncing like an excited puppy. “Cap, Cap! Aren’t you curious on how I got up here?” Schmidt almost shouted as he pointed to what looked like rocket boots.
are behind this- ”
Across the room – well, what was left of it – was Iron Man, holding up part of a collapsed ceiling, over his head. But that wasn’t what had stopped them in their tracks. No, it was the fact that Tony, who was
“For you, maybe,” the man smiled, reaching behind his back.
Tony eyed him warily. “And I fit into this how?”
Thor was there. Maybe. Were there others? No. They were gone.
Looking down at the photo, Steve could see an aged Amand Jernberg surrounded by family, laughing brilliantly into the camera.
Clint corrected.
Tony tried to pry himself out from under but to no avail. The weight of the ceiling plus the extra weight of the metal suit proved to be too much for the engineer. Tony’s strengths had limits; he wasn’t Steve.
Pepper shot him a dirty look. “Eat your soup then, Mr. Smarty Pants.”
Steve furrowed his brow. “What do you mean?”
“That’s the thing, though,” Steve replied. “We won’t.”
“I won’t let anyone hurt you,” replied Tony.
“Ah, yes. The Midwest. The group of states that no one else wanted so they formed their own region, with the only purpose of being a roadblock to the cool parts of America.”
“I do.”
Clint pulled out his weapon, aiming it at the woman. “It’s me. Get out of the car.”
There was no one without the other. The Captain’s dynamic duo; one to draw the prey out while the other waits patiently to slit their throat in a dark corner. If Barton’s hiding somewhere up above, Tony knew there was only a matter of time before Barnes had him pinned. For all Tony knew, the brunette was probably in this alleyway with him right now.
“Maybe I don’t want some pompous asshole like you on my team anymore.”
Tony flushed again, clearing his throat. “Well, that’s good,” he croaked. “Because I also, you know, like him, uh, like that.”
What Tony wasn’t expecting was a potentially murderous James Barnes whacking the shit out of a punching bag.
Steve frowned. “I thought you said you didn’t do that.”
Bucky nodded, already heading to the door. He pulled his out of his jacket, phoning Clint.
It looked almost innocent, the way it lay in the shattered glass. A small trail of smoke emitted from the back, partially covering the large 'STARK' written in white, block letters.
Tony smiled as Steve’s voice pulled him from his own thoughts. Tony looked down, his figure wrapped in bed, under a mound of blankets. “Humor me,” he replied to the blonde.
Steve smiled, biting down Tony’s chest, his hands cupping Tony’s leaking erection. “As you wish.”
“You brought him here?” Steve questioned. “Isn’t that a little bit risky?”
Rumlow sat to his left. “I can fix this, let me go back out and find him. I won’t let you down again!”
“Humor me.” The look in Tony’s eyes had Steve shutting up and relaxing against the seat, watching as his team filled the rest of the cars. Tony slipped in the driver’s seat next to Steve, taking point as he led the rest of the team further into Brooklyn.
Rural America left little to be desired for a first date – well, one fit for Tony Stark. In fact, even thinking of the word
A sheen of sweat had covered Clint when he reached what was left of Tony’s floor. The door had already been blown off its hinges, but there was wreckage everywhere. The last thing Clint wanted to do was to step on something to shift the rubble to much that could end badly for both him and Tony.
“No, no, no,” Tony soothed quickly. “I’m fine. I was just going to cum.”
“Stop trying to justify yourself. You ruined my life. You took everything from me! And now I’m going to kill you.”
Outside, Nick walked away from Stark Industries with a smirk on his face.
Bucky broke the surface again, yanking Steve along with him. He made sure his friends mouth was above the surface, his head leaning against Bucky’s should as he started to kick away from the burning building. He heard Steve groan, and cough out a few lungsful of water. “That’s it,” Bucky groaned, pulling the pair farther away from the collapsing warehouse. “I’m sick of dragging you through the water. Time to finally teach your ungrateful ass how to swim. I’ll get you and Stark some matching floaties.”
"Tony's doing his best to keep him calm, and telling him everything he knows," Steve answered truthfully. "His grandparents are here as well, so that may help. I can tell that Tony doesn't like being away from Peter, though, even if it is just in the hallway."
"Yeah," she nodded. "Dr Banner and Jarvis explained my injuries to me, so I'm not too surprised I'm still in pain."
“If you could that would be wonderful,” Tony said, turning around to smile at her. “They might actually be up in the Penthouse, and there’s a reason for that. Also, Steve is no longer Mr Steve, he’s Papa.” Mary’s mouth dropped and her eyes widened a little but the elevator doors were already closing. “I’ll explain later!”
He never thought he'd ever be in a position that he'd have to use Steve's own words against him - then again, he'd never seen Steve like this, and then again, he'd never seen
You’re an asshole, Barnes!” Tony shouted at the retreating figure.
“It wasn’t an
Steve frowned. “This is a trap.”
“Sleep is for the weak, Steve.”
After they’d landed, after the mission, Sam had waited outside his CO’s tent pacing, listening to Riley get chewed out for disobeying direct orders. Riley’s response was just as angry and as loud, and he came stomping out of the tent in a fit of anger, past Sam without a second glance.
Finally alone, Steve was left with his thoughts. He bit his lip before reaching down for his phone. He dialed the number quickly, happy to find it picked up on the first ring.
Rogers moved to exit the library, when a sharp pain to his hand stopped him. Looking down, he saw an arrow scar forming on his left hand, pointing farther up his arm.
Tony could feel Clint shaking next to him, fingers twitching with the need to have Coulson in his arms, but never moving, as if afraid that if he looked away, the man would be gone. Thankfully, Coulson came to him, sprinting the distance between them. Clint barely got his arms up in time before Phil was colliding into them, sending the pair sprawling onto the floor.
But once Tony connected his lips was Steve, he knew he was done for. It was like Tony was a drug, giving him ten times the rush as the serum ever did. And Steve couldn’t stop. He wouldn’t stop.
“Now, tell me Commissioner,” Tony swallowed. “Would I lie about that?”
Barton scoffed, walking behind the man and,
Tony had been meeting a potential investor for a business lunch when The Captain decided to attack. In a fight or flight response, Tony had immediately darted into the crowds, hoping that The Captain wouldn’t want to fight him around innocents. But, no. The Captain was beyond pissed; he was positively murderous. The only way he could ditch the crew was through motor transport, which Tony had left back at the restaurant. And since he didn’t have time to find a car that he could steal, his car was his only option. No cab driver was going to stop for him. But therein lies a problem. The Captain had attacked when Tony was getting out of his car. Meaning that The Captain’s car was right next to his, not giving Tony much of an advantage. But seeing as running all the way back to safety was out of the question, it was a risk Tony was going to have to take.
“Tomorrow, Fury will arrest both Pierce and Stane simultaneously. While that’s happening, I’ll be taking a few of you with me, per request of the FBI. Fury thinks he knows where Pierce is housing the files, he needs us to confirm it. The rest of you, after all this is over, will be escorted to your assigned FBI handler. From there, you’ll be sent away to your safehouse.”
Hill gave Steve a once over. “He still alive?”
She could have laughed. What? A shave?
Clint shoved Bucky against the wall, finally managing to cast a glance over to the precinct. “Phil?” he whimpered. Why was Phil on the ground? Why was Phil not moving? Why was he not over here with Clint?
Tony started to respond when he was cut off by someone opening the door. “Tony, my boy!”
But just to let you know, I’ve been here the whole time. There are three Avengers in that building and I haven’t seen any come out. Someone should go find them.”
He let himself be dragged behind bars, only to be pulled back out and start over. It wasn’t until he started spending longer on the inside than out there, that Sam started to take stock of his actions. What was he even doing there? Was it even helping? Will it ever be enough?
“You have no idea,” Steve confessed. “I’ve talked it over with Tony,” he lied with a nod towards the man on his left. “We’re willing to give you access to some of them if you help us take down Pierce.”
“Surely you can guess that similar measures would be taken to come and get me. Including terrorizing a few someone’s until you find the guy whose office is next to Fury’s.”
Tony chucked it in the back seat nonchalantly. “I was just messing with it. No biggie.”
“Damn, am I the only one who’s not getting any?”
Steve rode out his high.
Tony looked up at his still smoking company. “I don’t know, but it can’t be good. I need to get back in there.”
ptichka - 'little bird' in Russian
Barnes was faltering, unable to keep up his act as he struggled to continue to juggle the crew. He was spastic and impulsive, and almost cruel in his remarks, signs of him kicking into overdrive to try and grasp some semblance of control again. Control that he knew had slipped far from his reach – but yet he tried anyway, like code stuck in a loop, trying repeatedly to fix the unwanted error, only to create several more in its wake.
The masked man dropped the purse immediately, backing slowly away from Steve. He reached behind him and pulled out a gun from his waistband with a shaking hand. Steve sighed inwardly, raising his shield a little higher.
Tony. I-I don’t even know- ”
Steve leaned back in his chair, biting his nail. HYDRA had the upper hand, and they definitely knew it. It was wearing on Steve’s nerves. He liked to be in control,
Silence, again.
“the usual.”
Bruce tuned them out.
He put his head in his hands. It was over.
That was Steve’s voice. Soft reassurances that were whispered in a darkened room as they clung to each other. Tony could still smell the soft, clean linen of Steve’s shirt. Could still faintly hear someone running down the hall, while someone else clanged around in the kitchen. Maybe Howard was right. Using his heart was a weakness, but it was worth it every time. They were worth it.
“Sure, he’s transferred fake files over to a USB to present to the governor, but he still needs the originals to manipulate the city through HYDRA,” Steve added. “This info is his cash cow, so no way would be content to only use police resources. He would need a contingency plan, for this very scenario,” he continued, gesturing to the group. “Pierce would be a fool if he didn’t consider that the force may catch something that they weren’t supposed to. He’d have his own men holding down the fort, just in case it came to a firefight. More than usual if he was nowhere close, like for example, when he leaves for a meeting with government officials.”
“Complain all you like, you’d be lost without him.”
is what people are calling it. Word on the street was that The Captain had been found linked to the injuries and deaths of Stark Industries, so Tony retaliated by revealing the mob man’s name. Others say that Tony was the one to start the fighting, The Captain forced into action. Regardless of who threw the first punch, the effect was instantaneous. Mobs were gearing up, ready to choose sides in this Civil War if asked. Tony had already been on the phone with Quill about it; his forces were already rallying, no doubt The Captain’s allies doing the exact same thing. New York was thick with tension, no want wanting to stay out past dark, no one wanting to go out at all.
“Is that so?” Steve smiled.
“All I’m saying is to just consider it,” Stane soothed.
Tony stood as tall as he could. It seemed that his initial conclusion of the man had been right.
“It didn’t matter if you knew I was alive,” Phil sighed, shaking his head slightly. “You said it yourself. They’ve been trying to find my body. I’m sure you joined the search ever since you’ve been brought back home. And I’m hedging to bet that you’ve already coasted through every local and national law enforcement body to try and find me. But you couldn’t, could you?”
“Didn’t know what? That you would be caught?! You’ve fucked everything up.”
“Okay?”
Bucky found himself nodding sullenly. “Yeah,” he replied quietly. “I just, I, uh- ”
“Meaning that we’ve been foolish to think HYDRA would be our only problem. There are mobs everywhere in the city. Each of the hits, they weren’t from the same mob. They’ve all been from different ones,” Bucky responded.
With that, Tony surged forward, crashing his lips to Steve. Tony didn’t wait for an answer; he began placing open mouth kisses on Steve’s lips, slowly moving down Steve’s chin and neck.
“God, I love you,” he couldn’t help but whisper, pulling Tony into another embrace. Tony answered eagerly, running his hands along Steve’s shoulders in comfort, uttering a soft
“Is that so?”
“Fury,” Steve breathed.
Regardless, he turned back to the obstacle in front of him, tugging the mound of sweaters tighter around his body. It seemed that since he’d come back, he just couldn’t get warm. Being kept in the sewers of New York in the back half of winter really taken a toll on him.
“Tony,” Steve breathed, sitting back on his heels, giving the other man a small, private smile. Tony hated that smile. It always did funny things to his chest.
He could still salvage this mission.
“Not here.”
splattered out on my warehouse floor. Another time, maybe?”
Rhodes gaped at Steve with wide eyes. “What the hell is that?”
“That’s all we got?”
Tony cried out, curling in on himself before there were hands on him, metal ones, burning along his arms, and tossing him across the room. Tony landed with a thud and groaned, forcing himself to crawl away. He could hear Stane chasing after him,
He scoffed.
Barnes actually smiled. “I know.”
know anything. The SSR’s precious little intel boy. The perfect tactics, the perfect information. It’s a shame you never saw HYDRA coming.”
Steve pulled Tony close against him again, stroking through his hair. “
find. Like Steve working for the SSR was his own triumph. I saw right past his bullshit; he was just using Steve for his own advances. Phillips gave Howard everything and anything he wanted as long as Steve did his job. As long as Steve was his dancing little monkey.”
Tony opened his mouth before the blonde put up a large hand to stop him. “And before you ask, yes, we disabled it before we moved you, so there is no way your security can track you here. Your man Hogan’s probably wetting himself right now.”
“Fine,” Stark said softly.
“I’ve got ten on standby, spread throughout the block, not counting us. Why?”
“Is that a compliment, Barton?” Loki smiled.
idea to risk everything for the family. Love and pride sang through his chest every time he thought of what Tony’s done for them.
don’t hurt him.”
came a reply in his ear. A small explosion came from his left.
“Please?”
“What ever happened to first come, first serve?”
He knew that voice.
But Steve was wailing again. “No, no, please! I gotta get in there, I gotta-
“Pep, I’m not- ”
Steve shook his head. “I haven’t seen that yet.”
Steve looked up, where the lights of the buildings around him were getting swallowed by passing clouds.
for it not to go away. It was coming for him again. The cold. It was reaching out, its grip tight around his throat, and he can’t, he can’t,
“Phil," he pressed. "What did you do?”
Get him on our side, and- ”
Steve’s frown deepened. “What are you talking about?”
Steve reached for it immediately, not caring how desperate it may have made him look. “You sure about this?” he replied.
But he didn’t. He went north, to New York City. He found Riley’s sister, told her what a hero her brother was. She had smiled – Riley’s smile – and said that she knew. They
“I’m sorry, ma’am,” Steve almost shouted, making sure his voice carried through the other cubicles. “Pretend to be upset,” he whispered down at Mrs. Hogenson, smiling when the woman caught on immediately, beginning to sob as she walked away from his desk. Steve collapsed back into his chair, glad to know that he’d manage to get some sleep tonight.
“I knew there was a reason you were my favorite,” Tony chided.
Tony’s eyes fluttered, muttering a few unintelligible words. He shifted slightly against the pillows, wincing slightly as he jarred his middle. “But-but I was dreaming,” Tony whispered. “I didn’t…I don’t understand.”
“What are you trying to do here, Barnes,” snapped Tony. “Is this the part where you play my shrink? Because I didn’t sign up for this either.”
“Is that what you want?” Steve asked, still sitting on the floor. He sure he looked like an absolute mess – he was not a pretty crier, that was for sure. Runny nose, red rimmed eyes, and a blotchy face. “To be like us?”
The officer nodded before looking back to Steve. “Who was behind all this?” he said, gesturing to the mess in front of them.
Steve felt the car go into turbo, and with a quick glance to the GPS, he could see him gaining on the criminals. He whipped through traffic quickly, the car dancing between the lanes gracefully as he neared the target. Steve could hear the sirens now, accompanied by the popping of gunfire. Hoping to cut them off at the next major junction, Steve made another quick turn, when-
"It's ridiculous, I know. Go ahead and laugh at me super-soldier, I do feel a real connection to this guy. The way he writes, it gets to you... y'know? Warms you. S'impossible to explain but I read these big sappy declarations of love and I wanna hug the guy. I tried to look him up but it's like he doesn't even exist. I've started scanning military records with no luck. And who am I kidding, he was probably an old hermit. I can't believe I'm imagining some Greek god writing comics in his spare time."
"Tony, please don't make me get up at 7am, I don't care that it's Christmas Day, it's still my day off and I want to sleep."
Steve's sitting against his front door, jingling house keys in front of his face like a cat. He hasn’t slept much, nervous.
"Mr. Stark," he begins, through gritted teeth, "How can I be of service?"
he cries,
“We can't even share a first kiss without you insulting me?" Steve whispers, words rushed and mumbled, "God, I love you.”
"It's okay. - I'm okay," Steve places a hand over Tony's, and Tony's breath catches in his throat. For a second, not even that, they are the closest they've ever been. Then, normality resumes. Steve uses his grip on Tony's hand to lower it from his shoulder, severing the contact between the two. "Don't worry about it."  Tony watches Steve walk out the door, down the corridor, watching him through the glass panels until the very last moment. His mouth is still open, holding the words that died on his tongue. His heart feels heavy, and something about that - about how raw his emotions have become - makes him feel ashamed.
Steve sighs.
Instead of apologizing, or even exchanging pleasantries, Stark leaves the room grinning and pointing finger guns at Steve, paintbrush clutched between his teeth.
Steve has
Soon she'll be more entitled to the Iron Man suit that he is. Heck, she already is and don't they both know it. Those thoughts dissolve as soon as she brings up the comics, making the assumption that Tony's forgotten about it. He begins to defend himself - he was reading through them, getting a world-class Stark quality check before being sent off to the man himself. Tony punctuates his excuse with a wink and a big grin, trying to win Pepper over. If she thinks he's lying she doesn't show it, just ushers him back into the room, begging him to show a slither of affection towards Steve.
“Don’t start. I lost a bet and there’s apparently no amount of flirting with Liam from IT that can change it. So, naturally, I signed you up and got Tony to rig the system so that I got your name.”
Tony can only grapple with his own emotions so much in one day, and in the end manages to discreetly slip out his phone, hiding it under the table as he brings up Pepper's number.
Better to get it over with, he thinks, playing with the folds of the envelope. He hopes it's someone easy to buy for, a cheap bottle of perfume, some woolly socks - easy, right?
Once the cafe has been returned to it's normal state, Steve, as requested, pays for both of their orders, apologizing once more for good measure. They both stand in the doorway, and Steve feels a familiar pull towards the other man, leaning into him as he tries to pull his gloves on.
For the first time in a long time, he woke up hours before his alarm was set to go off.
Steve bows his head, blushing slightly: a bold contrast to how he entered the room. Finally, he says, “Do you need any help?”
Steve's getting flustered, and Tony finds it oddly beguiling. Cute, even, as he watches those bony fingers rub circles into soft temples. Now grinning, Tony stands up. It's obvious Steve has an attachment to these books, and he knows better than to insult something the super soldier holds so dearly. Steve's taken with the comic, ignoring Tony in favor of cradling it like a lost lover. Holding back the urge to whisper
He finally mustered the strength to stand up, after how long he could not say. Steve placed the comic on the sofa but found he didn't want to leave his work like that - abandoned and neglected. He then propped it up on the adjacent bookshelf and was again discomforted by how odd it looked against the leather bound classics. Steve let out a little huff, knowing exactly what his subconscious was getting at. He'd just have to return this to Tony personally.
“What?” Steve splutters, stumbling over his words, “No, no, no— where’d you get that from? There’s
He unwraps the little gift Tony presents and bursts into laughter.
And now the stories he'd once sold to cover one month's rent had returned to bite him. Steve thought no one would actually read the comics, the publisher laughing in Steve's face when he'd first sent copies off to him. He certainly didn't expect them to land in the hands of Tony Stark. To have those sheets under his hands, in a completely foreign land, and to be able to so clearly see Bucky’s face grinning toothily up at Steve once again. It was all incredibly overwhelming, the pages feeling like fire on the tips of his fingers. He didn't have a clue how to deal with the situation at hand, sat stiff on the sofa. When the initial shock finally dulled, he was left trying to quell the warmth in his stomach, the scarily familiar butterflies that came when Tony complimented his work.
He opens the envelope, feeling Steve's eyes burning into his skull. It's another, identical card, in the same handwriting.
He knows that this has to believable, rather than the lackluster job SHIELD did when recreating a familiar environment for Steve to wake up in after sixty years. He needs stuff actually from the era, rather than cheap replications. That's why Tony is stood here right now, expression masked by a baseball cap supporting a team he's never even heard of and a pair of large, dark sunglasses. Pepper has sent him directions to a vintage comic book store she's found - she's a miracle worker and Tony knows it, discovering this little gem on the outskirts of New York. The inside of the store is bathed in a dim half-light, glowing almost ethereally. Tony lets out a small sigh, realizing he'll have to take off the shades when he enters. The prospect of the clientele there acknowledging his existence gives him chills, but he knows what he has to do. He could have easily sent Pepper, or one of his interns - God, Tony could have bought the entire store. Instead, he knows that this has to be a personal act as he takes a tentative first step inside the building.
find a way to rig it so I can get you.”
Ernst E. Groves
Steve's lost for words. The argument disappears with one glance at Tony.
The huge grin that grows on Tony’s face answers the question. He hooks his thumbs in his belt and raised his eyebrows suggestively.
"Uh- I just assumed you knew. This is a pretty terrible way to find out I've been stealing your espresso shots for the past few months."
He wonders if he'll forget all of this if he hits his head hard enough against the desk.
Steve makes an apologetic face as everyone's eyes turn to him. Feeling the shame rise, he blushes as he makes his way to the back of the cafe, sliding into the seat opposite Tony.
"Nobody."
Steve takes the silence, and Tony's frozen stance as a bad sign and starts to apologize, backing away from Tony and into a cupboard. To rectify his mistake, Tony strides over to Steve, muffling his shouts by bringing his lips to the other man's. It's an effective way to shut Steve up, Steve kissing back, hands worming their way around Tony's hips. The kiss deepens, and Tony chuckles into it, because he knows they've been hopeless idiots recently and this - this kiss, is a Christmas miracle in itself. God, this is the stuff Tony dreams about: Steve's mouth, tasting like vanilla and cocoa, and his hands making their way up and down Tony's back, the strong smell of cologne on Steve's neck. Tony flicks his tongue against Steve's mouth and it brings the other man back to reality. Steve's unable to move backwards anymore, so he has to shove Tony off him, wiping the saliva from his mouth.
"I didn't mean- no, what I mean to say is, well, you have the bone structure for it. And your eyes, expressive - a painter's dream really. It's not
, but has to stop. He wonders absentmindedly if he's got the wrong room, but the familiar shield that rests besides an empty bed tells him otherwise. It's barren, like Steve never left the army - bed neat and freezing cold, absent of any sheets and the big fluffy pillows Stark provides. Next to it is the only other piece of furniture in the room, a plain cabinet. There's a couple of mementos spread across it and Tony can't help but reach out, reach out for the only residue of Steve in the room. There's a locket, Tony's seen Steve gaze at it enough to know that a photo of Peggy lies inside it. Next to it, a photo of Steve and Sam, arm in arm. It isn't even in a frame, simply lies there, smiling sadly up at Tony. On the end of the cabinet, shucked into a corner, are a pile of comics. Tony's seen a couple like them in Coulson's collection, and wonders if that's where they've come from. There's some of the old Captain America ones near the bottom that appear untouched. However, Tony's hands automatically reach for the one at the top. It’s falling apart, text worn away with love, the paperclips in the middle gone. Tony can barely follow the story, the cover's missing but Tony can work out something's going on with a brunette chick, a few aliens and a pleasing amount of dad jokes. Interesting, Tony muses. An idea begins to cement itself in his mind.
Tony kisses him. He crams himself into Steve’s lap, hand threading through the other man’s hair as his tongue invites itself into Steve’s mouth. The taste of Steve hits Tony in waves, beginning with a bitterness and turning sweeter the deeper into the kiss he goes. Their mouths clash with urgency, skin against skin as Steve shoves his cold hands up Tony's shirt. A squeal escapes Tony's lips at the contact, and he is forced lean back, regaining his breath. Steve is disheveled and panting - the sight making Tony's heart ache.
Tony reached up, gently tugging on Steve’s lower lip, pulling him down far enough to replace his fingers with his own lips. “I like the being together thing.”
“That’s what we’re here to talk about.” He watched Tony pulled out some food, then reached to turn on the coffee maker. “Any chance of that coffee finding its way over here?” Tony just looked at him, blank faced. “Or not, it was just a question.” Loki snorted softly, crossing his knee over the other.
“You’re being rather affectionate today,” Steve said with a soft smile.
“To the car,” Steve told them, stepping closer to Peter. “Thanks, Izzie, we gotta go.” Bucky was picking up Peter and they were running back to the car. Bucky was looking around, his eyes scanning every person he could see. “Jarvis? Jarvis can you hear me?” The line was all static now.
"Yeah, didn't take long, I think the excitement of coming here, and the car ride tuckered him out," Tony said, taking a seat on the island stool. He was about to reach for a tumbler of scotch, but stopped when, a) the crystal decanter wasn't sitting there, and b) he remembered that Peter was actually in his house. "It took a little longer to get away though, because he had his little arms around my waist. I think the arc reactor is a nightlight for him."
"Stop." The raspy voice caught the attention of both men. Bucky let Steve go, but didn't move away, keeping him crowded against the wall. "This is why neither of you will babysit Conor, don't need him having the wrong male influences."
Tony pouted a little as he ate the sandwich. "Maybe you're right," he finally admitted.
"On one condition," Tony said as he got up from his seat. "I want more kisses tonight, cause dayumn son, is your skin soft." Steve gave him a confused, but amused, look. "I have a thing for soft skin."
“Of course that got her to wake up,” Steve commented, getting up and putting his book in the bag he had with Jamie’s stuff in it. “Well, let’s get going then. Sweetness awaits.”
"Mom!" Wade smiled and hurried in when he saw his mom in the bed. He quickly climbed up and let the woman pull him into a hug. Tony walked in and pushed the door closed before taking a seat in one of the plush chairs by the bed.
"I've got to get dressed, enter the circus again." Standing up from the bed, Tony looked at her, his face open, honest and vulnerable for just a second. Then he raised his mask, the practiced easy smile on his lips. "Wish me luck, Mare." He left the room, nodding to William who was leaning against the opposite wall.
“I didn’t teach her nothing,” Bucky defended. “I made sure that she didn’t spontaneously stop breathing, or combust.”
Steve suddenly felt a flush of shame sweep through his body. He had once thought that Tony was an absent father, one someone who only put in the minimum effort with Peter. He had actually thought that Peter deserved better than someone who could only 'try' to make time for their son. But, now that Steve could put all the pieces together, he saw that Tony was doing almost everything in his power to be a good Dad, without exposing Peter to the tabloid sharks. It had to be hard, and it was only going to get harder.
"Howard Stark is the other half of Project Rebirth," Steve started to say. "He's the one who created my shield."
"You boys are starting to get too big for this," he grunted as he made his way towards the reception area. That was inside. Tony hadn't wanted to take any weather, insect, or bird related chances with the food. Dancing was always more fun inside anyway. "Wade, you already reach my waist!"
He lifted his eyes when he heard the slide of the elevator doors opening, and Julie was out like a shot. “Wade!” The brunette’s head popped up and he extracted himself from Steve’s arms to run over to his mom.
Psst.......
"How about, we go see Cap next door, and I'll go find everyone else, yeah?" Tony looked at Peter, seeing tired brown eyes meet his own. "You can talk to him, 'cause he's the real Captain America, and I'll see if everyone else can have visitors. Then we're gonna get you to a bed to sleep, alright?" Tony needed to see where Mary was, and if Coulson had been able to do anything before, well, everything had happened. He still wanted Mary moved to his care, he was not going to settle for anything less.
“Seriously?” Rhodey didn’t sound surprised, just resigned that this was actually happening.
“I do not know specifics,” Loki said, suddenly walking on the other side of Tony and Strange. “The being that has kept Stark’s mind hostage works to secure that hold. I believe that a third entity has intervened, and now it is difficult to bring Stark back to us.”
"It would be my pleasure, Mrs Parker." The AI's reply had Steve tilting his head a little. When Mary opened the door to Peter's room Steve could see that it was dark, but there were lights that seemed to be moving across the floor. When he leaned in a little he saw that they were actually moving across the ceiling. Mary pat peter's back and he crawled into bed, letting his Mama tuck him in with his stuffed animal.
After making a list of groceries, Steve went to put the notebook back into the study and he stared at the files sitting on the desk. Was he ready to look at them? Was he ready to find out what had happened to his friends, to those he cared about? The loss of Bucky still felt fresh to him, and he had to wonder if he was willing to add on to that.
Wade Wilson believed that he was the epitome of sneaky. His Mom was taking a nap, and there were still several hours before he could do a video chat with Peter while he was gone on vacation. Jarvis kept him from going down to the gym to watch the Avengers that were in the Tower train, and he wasn’t allowed in Peter’s Mom’s place while they were doing ‘work stuff’. Something about classified information, or some such nonsense.
"I'll take the secret to the grave," Steve swore, putting a hand up in oath. "Peter told me that it was your mothers’ recipe?"
"Well, I mean, yeah," Steve nodded. "Sure, there are some things that we have to discuss. A lot has happened in the past week alone, but-"
"Your collection is getting pretty big now, isn't it?" Steve smiled at the boy. Peter had been over the moon when he found out that Steve had liked to draw as well, and he had been helping the young boy with some tips. He was surprisingly good for a five-year-old.
"Of course I did!" Tony grinned at him, kissing the side of his head. "Just like I put all of your artwork up, I'm gonna put up art that has you in it." Peter wiggled happily in Tony's arms. Mary leaned over to kiss Peter's head, making him giggle a little. "You're silly, Petey. You're our silly little boy."
Steve sat at the security desk of the school, looking over the security footage from earlier in the day. He saw a blonde woman walk into the office, signing out Wade, and a few minutes later the boy walked in with his bag. Steve could make out the frowned on Wade’s face before the woman was moving to take his hand, nearly pulling him out. There was no denying that it was Hilda, but he didn’t think that she would show up so soon as revealing herself to Bucky.
"You're not asking me anything." Tony had a soft spot for single parents. When Peter had first met Wade, he had done the over protective father thing and looked up Wade Wilson, and his family. His mom, Julie Wilson, was divorced from her husband, who worked in the military. It had taken a little bit of digging, but he found buried reports of abuse, and that's why she had left.
"Couldn't agree more." Tony flew a little higher. "Any idea on how to shut it off, yet?"
He found the hatch sliding away suddenly, grunting when he was sliding across the cement. Tony looked up and stopped when he saw a gun inches away from his face. "I don't think I want you touching that," the man said. This man was different, he was still in black, but his clothes were more casual, less armor. This was one of the men in charge. His eyes flickered to Tony's chest, and Tony couldn't help but frown. He leaned his head a little and looked down, and saw what was so interesting. It also explained why Tony was feeling out of breath. It was stealing the power from the arc reactor. "Now, I really don't want you touching it."
"It sounds weird coming from you," Sam said as he nodded. "So you usually shack up in his place, then."
"I'm sorry, I'm not sure I'm following you?"
Steve hummed and nodded, watching Mary leave his apartment, closing the door quietly behind her. He still thought that Anthony Stark was selfish, but now he had to reconcile the thoughts he had about Stark and Tony into one person. The tough part was going to be not getting angry with him without clearing up Tony's actions with the man himself first.
Tony buckled Jamie into her car seat in the middle, then helped Peter up into his on the side, while Steve lifted Wade on the side. “You’re looking about as whipped as the boys,” he said to Tony as they headed for the front of the SUV. “I can take the drive from here.”
“Oh no! Steve and I get the big bed!” Steve laughed as Tony caught up to Peter, and he turned to look out the window again.
"Have you slept since coming home?" He walked over to help Tony put on the new sheets.
"Sleeping is overrated," Tony mumbled. From the other side of the bed Tony pulled out some fresh blue sheets. Rhodey blinked, unaware of where the sheets had come from. He stopped questioning things, well most things, with Tony a long time ago. Maybe at MIT.
Tony blinked, not sure how exactly to respond. It was an innocent enough question, but Pepper knew for a fact that Tony didn't have a peanut allergy. He opened his mouth to give some bullshit excuse, but frowned when he heard a couple more sets of footsteps. Craning his head a little he saw Rhodey, and his faithful driver and bodyguard, Happy Hogan coming in the room. Then his heart absolutely melted, and froze at the same time, at the next voice that he heard.
"What do you mean?" He asked her seriously.
Tony was sitting on the floor, next to Bruce's bedroom door, across from Mary's door, phone in his hand. His tablet was still in Mary's room, but he still had a couple things that needed his attention, and he didn't actually want to put up with Mary's mother.
“You’re going to make us get our pictures taken with our counterparts, aren’t you?” Steve asked from inside the room.
Phil leaned in and kissed her properly. "I'm thinking a fall wedding, late September."
Next chapter will pick up where this one left off, so get ready for some more emotions to be felt! There are emotions being felt as I write this. Don't hate me!
"People did have sex back in the forties," Steve quipped. "They just didn't talk about it as openly as they do in this time period."
"Sir, there are still terabytes of calculations needed before an actual flight is-" Jarvis tried to talk some sense into his creator.
"You don't need that much room," Steve said with a chuckle. "Just a quarter of New York." Steve laughed when Tony threw a pair of Peter's socks at him, easily catching them though. "I imagine there will be more room when we finish the Tower, too."
"Mary and I made a list for him," Steve confessed. "A list of words that he's already heard, and not too repeat. We're hoping he shared it with Wade."
"Yeah, we can stay- ack." Tony was pushed back into the couch when Peter landed in his lap, arms around his neck in a hug suddenly. He swore he heard a little chuckled from The Neighbor. "But I have to run home at some point to get my clothes, okay?"
"Ouch, hitting that guilt nerve," Tony muttered, keeping Jamie from falling on her back as she drank from her bottle.
"No," Tony shook his head, frowning. "No, Steve, tell me it didn't happen." Steve looked at him, biting his lip, and shook his head.
"We miss you, buddy."
"As soon as we know something, you'll know something, promise." Steve told her, pulling a pillow from the couch and shoving it under his neck
"Can you tell me where you are, Tony?" They needed to get him out of his head, away from the flashbacks.
"Daddy!" He heard Peter call from downstairs. Tony blinked, then headed downstairs to the kitchen. First night of real sleep without nightmares, he wasn't going to question it. He half jogged down the stairs and saw Peter staring over towards the tree, which had gotten bigger over night, to accommodate the new presents. Tony had some other presents that had been labeled "From Santa", as did Mary it seemed.
“Don’t you dare!” Steve pointed at Wade who was standing in front of him, Jamie in Steve’s lap. He was sitting on one of the benches to a picnic table while Tony had taken Wade and Peter to some of the food trucks. Steve was sure that the boys were going to be hyper from a sugar rush later, but even Steve had enjoyed elephant ears, and funnel cakes at Coney-Island before the serum.
"Taller than you, maybe," Tony said, tickling Peter's sides, making him squeal with laughter and wiggle in his arm. "Alright, Petey," he stopped and set Peter on his feet, "Tell Grandma and Grandpa bye." Peter nodded and ran over to his grandparents and Tony glanced back at Rhodey. "This is why I'm not married," Tony whispered to Rhodey, and the military man had to put a hand over his mouth to keep from laughing.
Steve followed Tony to the bedroom, putting Wade's bag on the bed. Tony grabbed his tablet from the bedside table, and turned to leave, but Steve didn't move right away, blocking the door. Tony raised an eyebrow at him. "You don't like things being handed to you, right?" Steve asked and Tony looked a little confused.
“You’ll have to be a little more specific I think.” Tony let out a little sigh, then attempted to push himself up. That was when he became acutely aware of just how much his body hurt. He pulled in a breath, then felt Steve’s hands there to help him up. “I remember going to Strange’s place, shit, and Loki was there.” Steve dropped a kiss on Tony’s forehead as they got him in a more comfortable position.
Bucky dropped his hand on Wade’s head briefly. “She’s not coming back. Come on, let’s get back home. The Fitzgerald’s are making dinner tonight.” Wade nodded and hopped into the car. Bucky did one last look around the area, and got in the driver’s seat. He’d tell Meg, and Jarvis when they got back. Maybe the rest of the Avengers would take it seriously if it came from the AI. They could come up with a plan before Tony and Steve got back, because those two did need the little break.
"Preliminary results show that there is nothing wrong," Jarvis informed him. "I would suggest something for nausea, but I will continue to monitor your condition, Sir."
Hey everyone! Yo, things are crazy in the world right now. I've gone throuhg a job change (as I'm sure many other people have), and right now I'm in training for a new position. (I was lucky enoguh that my company handles many contracts and found room for those of us that had to get moved.) So, here I am with an update! And I'm do old fashioned pen and paper to start on more. There's one more chapter after this before the start of Proof of Existance. And this will continue with some in between chapters after that! Get ready ladies nad gents and everything in between!
“Cheat!” Tony shouted at her with a laugh. Peter was reaching out to her as he laughed.
“I don’t have like eight weeks to spare,” Tony pointed out. “I bet you had to work with Pepper to clear out these few days to spend here.” Steve leaned over to kiss him. “Mmmm, that’s a sure fire way to stop my rambling.”
Of course, Tony couldn’t have counted on parking being quite horrendous on the street, forcing him to park three blocks away. His sunglasses were already on, and he buttoned up his jacket as he locked his car and started the hike up. It wasn’t that he minded walking, he did a lot of walking when he worked directly with the missiles that he helped with when SI was still working with the military on weapons. He just didn’t like doing it alone, where he might be recognized, or any one of his apparently endless enemies could be watching him.
“Then I can come back down to work on the suit? Just an eight hour lock down?” Tony asked, stepping onto the elevator, Steve coming in next to her, arm around his waist as Jarvis took over the controls of the elevator, taking them to their private floor.
Tony could hear her frown as she responded. "And what are you doing that you don't want them to know about? Is it something that you don't want me to know about? Do I need to be concerned, again?"
"Tony, to Tony," the engineer quickly corrected. He could practically hear Mary rolling her eyes. After nearly two years, she was still trying to get him to accept the 'Dad' word. There was a little shuffle as the phone was probably being pressed to Peter's ear. "Hey, Petey."
"I'm still working on that, Sir." Tony blew out a breath.
"Aren't you in New York?" Bruce asked, hesitation and uncertainty in his voice.
"-but he should be finding someone who's stable. And possibly female. Not that I'm judging, because, hello, if there was another species out there that actually looked hot, I'm pretty sure I'd be there."
"I'm surprised you let him get that far," Mary commented to him.
"Going to stick with the six month estimate?" Bruce said, moving to sit on the floor now, his back resting against the couch.
"I tried to make pancakes?" He looked a little lost, putting the bowl in the sink. Mary took a breath and nodded, pushing the sleeves of her shirt up.
“Uh, no, that’s- No, I mean- I’m not sexist,” Tony rushed out, tripping over his words. She merely chuckled softly. “No, it definitely doesn’t have to do with your gender, or even your age. Really it has nothing to with you, at all.”
"So, I've actually got you the apartment next to mine," she started heading for the door and Steve followed. She pulled out a key and opened the front door, holding it open for Steve to walk in. "We're the only ones on the ground floor, I thought it might be easier, and give a little bit of privacy." They passed a staircase, Steve took a second to glance up, then looked down the hall and saw two doors that were across from each other. There was a '1' on the door on the left, and a '2' on the door on the right.
“It’s Tony,” said man murmured, but didn’t complain with Steve hooked his arm under Tony’s knees and lifted him into his arms. “Just Tony.” Steve kissed Tony’s forehead and he hummed softly. “I like that.”
"Tell me, Doc! Tell me the choices."
“Don’t I get points for handling this with grace?” Steve asked. “I mean, I’m the one that has to deal with the paparazzi trying to hound me and figure out who I am, and probably trying to get pictures of Jamie.”
“Mom!” He wrapped his arms around her waist, pressing his face to her stomach as he started to cry again. She held onto him tightly, her own red rimmed eyes dropping a few more tears down her cheeks. Steve pushed himself up, eye twitching a little as he felt the two bullets still in his leg and shoulder now that the adrenaline of a fight had worn off. He caught Julie’s eye when she looked over at him, and he just gave her a nod and motioned back towards the elevator. She didn’t need to worry about him, Wade was infinitely more important. He’d be up to tell her what happened soon.
“No need to be a dick about it,” Tony mumbled under his breath before pulling one in. he straightened a little in his chair and nodded. “Yeah, alright, let’s do this.”
"Do you spend a lot of time on stage?' Mary couldn't help but ask. "Acting maybe?"
“Papa lost one of your socks,” Tony whispered loudly to Jamie and turned back to tablet, using a foot to rock her back and forth on the wheels. “Sounds like someone needs more training.”
