Tony would have said something, but he was still strangely at a loss for air that wouldn’t come. And his heart – his heart was stuttering in his chest, feeling weaker with every beat.
The end of the plug was narrow, barely larger than the tip of his little finger.  He had expected to get something shaped vaguely like a small, personal spade, but in fact the highest reviews he had seen were for an irregular shape, a collection of bulges.  It was pretty obviously designed to mimic the usual functions of a guy’s sphincter, and Steve had deliberately gotten it in blue to reduce the resemblance.
“I would crawl in front of you.”  Tony pulled harder, and then there was a hand on Steve’s shoulder, and Steve realized he was supposed to turn over.  Tony’s face was white when he saw it, drawn with arousal.  He pressed a scorching kiss to Steve’s mouth, tongue fucking him hard and then drawing his tongue sideways, licking through the drying come on Steve’s cheek.
Everything had taken maybe ten seconds, and Steve stood up, reaching out to catch his improbably bouncing shield when an energy bolt hit him in the chest and blasted him back into the truck with a pained grunt.
“I don’t even know why I bother,” Rhodey said, sighing, handing the flashlight back over. “We going forward?”
“Are we seriously going to be debating the mechanics of magic while sitting in here?” Rhodey asked. “What about the possibly dead person in a block of ice that should
He was expecting porn, to be honest; the jerking off was kind of a giveaway on that one.  He wasn’t expecting precisely
“I shouldn’t…” Steve turned his head further, nose brushing against Tony’s jaw. His breath was warm against Tony’s skin, and he had to repress a shudder, grateful that no one else was here to see them like this. It felt far too intimate.
was, J was going to handle all of my interactions with you before letting you ‘escape’ after a couple of days, or, worst case scenario, call in an anonymous tip on myself.  No problem, right?  No harm, no foul, just needed you out of the way for a few days.  This seemed like an easy way to get it.
Rhodey didn’t seem to mind, pulling out the rather disgusting rations they’d packed for occasions just like this. They settled down on a relatively dry piece of rock and waited in silence, watching as the snow and ice gradually melted and didn’t seep out of the room.
Steve studied him for a long moment, and Tony wished he could see Steve’s face instead of the shadows he was left with. What could Steve see that could justify why he was looking for so long?
It was an instinct deeper than blood, one that Tony didn’t even realize he’d had until it was shoved directly into his face. Ignoring the sharp pain in his knee, Tony
Tony, when he walked in, was absolutely, completely, totally speechless.  His mouth worked, gaping, for almost a full minute before he gave up and flapped his hands in Steve’s direction, instead.
The hole was three feet away now, and Tony pulled himself up, finding himself looking down into something dark. It was definitely a cave, albeit a bigger one than Tony had expected given how it had looked from below.
In any case, Tony was hot on the trail of something that might be a solution to his ever present heart troubles. The stories were sketchy on what it was, but beggars couldn’t be choosers. And Tony was definitely getting desperate at this point.
Tasha didn’t hesitate once she got the lay of the land; her mouth was as aggressive as the rest of her, sinking down directly over Gwen’s clit and sucking maybe harder than most would like it—but she had read Gwen correctly, and that was
“Do you remember what happened?” Tony asked once the shivering had subsided some. Steve didn’t pull away and Tony didn’t either (he didn’t want to look closely at why; Rhodey was already eyeing the two of them weirdly).
Rhodey said nothing as Tony approached it, reaching out slightly unsteady fingers. The metal was cold to the touch and extremely smooth. Tony gingerly picked it up, surprised that it was at once heavier and lighter than expected. He flipped it around, noting that it didn’t quite behave like a normal shield (what – being a King Arthur fan meant knowing shields).
?). Yet there were other inconsistencies that had Tony wondering who he was and what he’d been doing. It was true that not everyone read
“Do you really believe that?” Steve’s smile was wry and just on the sweet side of tender. Like he knew what Tony was trying to do and appreciated it.
wanted the touches to be harder, fiercer... and just as she was getting ready to demand it, Tasha’s eyes flared and she
“That’d be great,” Steve said, “but it’s not what I’m talking about.” He sounded nervous. “I was thinking more along the lines of my blood – the serum I was injected with. I didn’t tell you, but I was a 4F, rejected multiple times by the army until Erskine picked me for Project Rebirth. I was sick; you name it, and I probably had it at one point or another.”
“No, but…” Rhodey made a face, glancing back in the direction they had come from after playing an intricate game of charades and “do you understand this?” with the locals. “We don’t know anything about we’re going into. Usually there’s more to the myths and legends we’re looking into but this? We’ve got the barest hint that there might be something here from an old story from a guy who went crazy from living in the mountains.”
“What do you expect, Rhodey?” Tony barely kept from snapping, resisting the urge to rub a hand over the glass case protecting his heart and keeping it ticking. “I’m running out of options here. This might be nothing, but it might also be something. It doesn’t hurt to try.”
“I do,” Rhodey said. “But I don’t know if I should trust this. You know I don’t have any issues with you being who you are, but you know not everyone’s going to see it like that. You really want to risk your life on him? A man you just met?”
“Zemo,” Steve snapped, sounding surprisingly fierce. There was an edge to his voice that Tony honestly hadn’t expected.
That did it.  Steve couldn’t take it anymore, and dropped a hand to the catches of his uniform pants.  It took three tries, but he managed to open the front of it, sliding his hand inside and pressing firmly against the throbbing of his erection, willing it to stay still and quiet with him as Tony finished.  It wouldn’t be long, now.
This was utterly bizarre and new and so damn cool that Tony couldn’t help it. There was something else at work here, but it didn’t feel malevolent.
The corner of Steve’s mouth quirked up in a small smile. “Of course. A shield is only good if it’s shielding you.”
it felt amazing!  Tony's mouth was so hot, and the thin cotton of Steve's shirt made the caress rough and scraping rather than slick, without being painful.  Tony scraped his teeth over the nipple, holding it between them rather than fully biting but with the nipple surrounded by wet cotton Steve wasn't going anywhere, and Steve found himself pleading, begging Tony for more.
Steve froze, suddenly going cold, only to be reassured by Tony’s next words.  “You’re better than that, even.  You’re
The thought was bitter, and Steve hoped it didn’t go through cleanly.  He wasn’t sure if it did or not; regardless, Stark responded after a second by snatching the— the
.  The agent escorting her, Agent Bowers, was wearing long blue pants and a mandarin-collared jacket in matching hue, both fitted closely, the trousers widened at the bottom to fit over a pair of boots, or a side-piece.  She looked efficient, utilitarian, and comfortable.
Gwen woke in the dark, chained to a metal frame that hung, suspended, from the ceiling, in the middle of a mid-sized, otherwise-empty room.  Well, not entirely empty: there was what looked like a cherrywood chifferobe just at the edge of her vision to the right when she turned her head as far as it would go, and a glimpse of something bed-height on the left suggested that it might be a bedroom of some sort.  But it was a bit too large to be a guest bedroom anywhere, and the phrase that came to mind was
Steve was abruptly, inevitably conscious of his own hardness, the aching throb of his cock in his pants.  He watched as Tony’s head tilted back on his neck, the angle of his arm changing as he found his own hole and sunk in.  Probably two fingers; Tony had a lot of lube on his hands already, and he did like to go fast...
Tony didn’t say anything else until Steve had done it—and it hurt, too—and once Steve’s hand dropped away, he went on as if there had been no interruption.  Which hurt more than the pinch, come to think of it.  “I was saying, that I’d have you licked open, squirming beneath me, and then I’d start with one finger.  Pull out the plug, Steve.”
By the time Gwen’s cries were fading into silence, Tasha had pulled back, studying her as she stood there, spread open and clinging to the frame.  Thoughtfully, Tasha reached down and popped the snap at the top of her jeans, slipping one hand inside them and coming out with her fingers glistening.
“‘Cut off one head, and two more shall take its place,’” Rhodey quoted, disgust in his tone. “We just can’t get rid of them. I mean, we’ve tried. They really do like Tony.”
“A dress,” Gwen repeated.  She smiled, the winsome, superficial, glass-and-champagne smile she learned with the USO.  “It sounds like a very fancy party, Miss Stark; surely you don’t want me showing up in something SHIELD picked out.”
There was what seemed to be a hole a ways up in the side of mountain they were walking on, although one would have to do some actual climbing to get there.
“Not with that one,” Steve said. He cleared his throat, looking vaguely embarrassed as he said in a vaguely songlike manner, “Each one you buy is a bullet in the barrel of your best guy’s gun.”
“We tied him and the others up and left them there. Didn’t really have space for an extra passenger, especially since we needed to keep you alive.” Steve paused, eyes dropping. “I was really worried,” he admitted. “I thought you were going to die, and there was nothing I could do to stop it. I was too slow again.”
“The next time you come...” he said slowly, still not raising his eyes from the messy juices on the floor, “would you be willing to come over here and aim it at me?”
“I don’t know. I still can’t remember what happened at the end.” Steve shrugged, smiling melancholically. “I don’t know if anyone else made it out or if it was just me. And if they did make it out…were they frozen like me? If they were, they’re probably dead anyway. It’s not like they can survive in the ice like I did. I only did because I have…” He paused, expression considering. Eventually he continued, speaking slowly, “I have a serum, too.”
Come to think of it, the snow surrounding the ice block seemed less solid than it had minutes ago as well. It was distinctly more like a slushy frosty puddle than freshly fallen snow now.
Tony watched Steve for a moment, seeing no hint of a lie in his face. “Since you know…I should tell you why I was really in that cave. This keeps my heart running, but it’s a temporary stopgap measure. It’s not going to last in the long run. My heart’s only got so much left in it, and I’ve been looking for a cure for years.” His mouth twisted. “I wasn’t really expecting to find anything but then…” He gave Steve a pointed look.
Later that day, Steve stopped helping pack up the camp to squint closely at Tony for several long moments. Then, once Tony had time to freak out and wonder if there was something grievously wrong with his face, Steve said, “I thought you had a…” He seemed to search for the right word. “Goatee? No, that’s not… Van Dyke?”
Steve shot back.  He slipped his hands into the tight, dark denim trousers everyone seemed to be wearing these days, the ones that— he noticed now— clung to Stark’s shapely rear, outlining the perfect curve of it
The door opened outward, Gwen discovered, but not in the normal way; it didn’t swing.  Instead, it pulled straight back all at once with a sound like Iron Man punching metal and hiss like a steam engine, then rolled slowly off to the left as if it weighed a couple of tons.  It probably
His cheeks flushed slightly, and Tony cleared his throat, ignoring the amused look Rhodey shot his way. “Maybe. If I didn’t blow their base sky high first.” If he didn’t make sure that they’d never ever turn him into the next Zemo.
He pulled the tarp closed enough to shield them from the worst of the wind but still letting some light in. The airship they’d taken to get to Nepal in the first place wasn’t that far off physically speaking, but the terrain wasn’t the easiest as there were no actual roads. Since they didn’t want a mechanical failure on account of going too fast, the trip would take them into the late afternoon.
He should think twice about doing this, especially with another man. But there were no secrets from Steve—
Except…he had no idea what happened after he passed out. Steve had taken Zemo out, hadn’t he? Or someone had. Honestly, Tony’s memories of what had happened as his heart gave out were a little fuzzy (panicking and desperately gasping for air would do that to a man).
Tasha was staring at her, watching her, wide-eyed.  The look was familiar, but it took Gwen a moment to place from where: it was the same look Tasha had worn when she realized she had underestimated Gwen, like Gwen was some kind of beautiful mystery of unexpected complexity.
“Damnit!”  Steve didn’t hesitate, though.  He had to rest a moment between pulling his fingers out of his ass and reaching up to spread himself, but he did it.  The air in the room felt cool on his over-heated rim.
of vibranium, but he’d never thought he’d ever get to handle it himself. Wakanda was notoriously secretive with their resources, so how had Steve gotten enough to make an actual
He shuddered all over, from his shoulders to his knees.  He clenched down around the plug, which of course didn’t yield, and the resultant faint ache made him shudder again.  He was hard, he realized.  He supposed it shouldn’t really be a surprise.
The last thing Gwen heard as the door punched into place was the click, click, click of Tasha’s pointy heels moving away down the corridor.
Someone batted his hands away and Tony let them fall to his sides, lungs heaving as he tried to pull in air that wouldn’t come. His heart kept skipping beats, and his lips felt numb and tingly now.
Stark practically snarled the phrase, and Gwen found herself on the back foot, her head rearing back defensively.  “Not that I noticed,” she snapped back.  “He never spent a lot of time on
“Uh-huh.” Rhodey touched his shoulder, grip reassuringly steady. “Your weird feelings tell you that?”
The man groaned again, eyes scrunching tighter. His right arm twitched, and then his eyes were flying open. He jerked upright or at least seemed to try, since he practically fell back on the ground and was staring at the two of them, wide-eyed.
Tony raised an eyebrow, gesturing to the bleak but beautiful landscape around them. “I don’t fancy getting lost. I’m an adventurer, not some maniac with a death wish.”
She sighed, subtly trying—failing—to shift in her bonds, and rolled her eyes.  “Come on, Tasha, how dumb do you think I am?!”
be a goner and nothing anyone did would help. Jarvis wouldn’t be able to come up with a miracle to shock his heart back to life and Rhodey wouldn’t be there to help him limp back to a charging port.
It was chilly.  The lace bra, which in Gwen’s opinion had been insufficient in the first place, was definitely not enough to keep her nipples from pointing through the dress, and the blue was a pale enough shade that it would be immediately noticeable to anyone who walked in.  She wasn’t wearing any stockings, either, and her legs were breaking out in gooseflesh.  Her lower lip trembled, and she clenched her jaw; it wasn’t cold enough for her teeth to chatter yet, but all her kidnapper had to do was wet her down and then it
The ghost (which was totally nonexistent and definitely the icy wind at Tony’s back) waved at his back.
“Says it’s okay,” Tony whispered, so quietly that it was almost drowned out by the engine of the truck and the rattling of the tires, yet Steve seemed to hear him nonetheless. “Says that it’s the right thing to do.”
Steve threw Stark’s hands off him and curled his lip.  “You’re smart,” he said scathingly, “so you already know how
She moved towards Tasha, who stepped backwards towards the wall.  Tasha’s hands came up in front of her, braced as if she wore Iron Man’s weapons on her palms, although of course she didn’t right now.
Tony kindly ignored Steve’s obvious embarrassment, realizing that what he’d said didn’t sound quite right. “But when did you sell those?”
, something in Tony suggested but that was just ridiculous). He kept up with them easily, bringing up the middle with Tony in the lead and Rhodey in the back.
The party was drivel, unfortunately.  There was more glad-handing, just like Gwen had done in all her “meetings,” but this time paired with mediocre wine and out of season strawberries.  Gwen kept a smile on her face and batted her eyes a lot; after a few minutes, Stark—Tasha, she supposed she should call her now—seemed to get the joke, because the hard light in her eyes got twinkly-er, and she started introducing Gwen to men who, it had to be said,
At seven seconds, though, the Iron Man armor focused on her and Tasha.  “STAAAAARRRRK,”  the computerized voice of it droned.  Gwen shivered; it truly did sound like a monster out of some cinema film.  Well done on the designer’s part, she supposed; just on the edge of over-the-top.  “BRING.  ME.  STARK.”
Steve beat Tony home that night—on purpose.  It wasn’t hard; Tony was contemplating buying a little tech startup out in Cleveland, and had planned to fly out and back in the armor, since that always added a nicely competitive edge to the negotiations.  “And because you like flying in the armor,” Steve had pointed out, amused.
Stark snarled instead, tightening his grip in Steve’s hair, pulling Steve’s head back even further on his neck.
“Zemo didn’t know me,” Steve said. “And he…he’s always been like a dog with a bone when it came to me. He and Red Skull.”
Tony swept his eyes up and down Steve’s impressive physique that was in no way resembling a man who had been a 4F. “Doesn’t seem like it.”
kneading until Gwen’s eyes were crossing.  Gwen groaned again and took Tasha’s soft shirt in her hands, rubbing the fabric appreciatively between her fingers before shifting her grip and tearing, ripping the shirt right down the center.
“Tony, you’re awake!” Steve moved over to him, hands fluttering briefly like he wasn’t sure if he was allowed to touch.
“Gwen!”  Tasha had been behind her, hadn’t she?  No, she had moved out of the way—where had she gone?  Oh, she was leaning over Gwen, checking her pulse as the last of the muckety-mucks cleared out of the room...  “Oh, Gwen, are you okay?”
close to coming, and Tony’s mouth was moving, which meant he was talking Steve through it—on the screen, again, but also in Steve’s memory, because Tony talking him through to orgasm that first time was something he was
Her teeth were getting closer and closer to Gwen’s throat even as Gwen was getting closer to orgasm, and Gwen thrust and thrust again, trying to get there faster.  It came down to the inevitable, though: Tasha’s teeth grazed the column of Gwen’s throat before sinking in on the long, diamond-shaped muscle there, and Gwen climaxed immediately, wild beneath the pressure of Tasha’s hands and body and bite.
convenient—tearing them down Tasha’s legs one side at a time.  They got caught at the hips and tangled with Tasha’s underwear, and then got caught again at the tops of her thighs.  “Why—the hell—are your pants—so—
“Let’s just say they have a personal investment in getting me to their side,” Tony said eventually, not wanting to think about who was in charge of HYDRA.
Even if they usually ended not being there because the caves were actually caves and not holding life’s mysteries.
So why did he feel like there was something in the mountains here? A nagging, prickling feeling at the back of his neck, at the back of his mind, poking and prodding him even though there was nothing there for him to see.
It was remote, rural, and absolutely gorgeous if one went for that sort of thing. Even Tony, who liked all the amenities of civilization and the ability to charge his heart without having to go scavenging for batteries to mooch off of, could enjoy it. It was cold, but the kind of cold that made one take a deep breath and appreciate life.
So Gwen did.  She moved in so fast she almost tripped over the discarded pants, desperately diving in, messy and reckless.  Too fast and too hard, probably, but then again Tasha was moaning and sinking her hands into Gwen’s hair, pulling her in and looking down with wide, shocked eyes, so maybe Gwen was doing okay.
Oh, God, the praise should not mean so much to Steve, not when he was the one who had set this whole thing up in the first place.  “I love you, Tony.”
“Neither.”  Tony was gasping on every stroke, now, close enough to go off any second.  “I want—just play.  God, you’re so wet already.”  Steve remembered where else he was wet and felt a wave of turned-on embarrassment sweep through him.  “I want—get some of that good stuff on your fingers.”
“After all,” a smooth, mocking voice said from the doorway, “he has cost my company an awful lot of money.”
Hugging him was as natural as breathing. “You won’t,” he said, even though it wasn’t a promise he should make (but he was going to all the same because Steve was
“Something would’ve happened when I stepped in there,” Tony pointed out, glancing back. He turned the flashlight into the room, catching another glimpse of that strange metallic star. “Unless you want to throw a rock in there and see what happens?”
“Look at it this way,” Tony said, trying for a lighthearted tone. “If they’re a zombie, we can say we successfully adverted an apocalypse. Again.”
Somehow this seemed to involve singlehandedly picking up an entire box that had required the combined efforts of Jarvis and Rhodey when it’d been initially unloaded.
“Not that cold,” Steve murmured. “I don’t know what happened. To me or to my team. Are they all right? Did they make it out? Do they think I’m dead?”
There was silence in the room as they both looked at it.  I’ll have to clean that by hand, too, Steve thought.
“Look at that.  You are a miracle, Steve, you really are.  Give that a stroke for me—just one.  Wouldn’t want you to get too excited, too soon.”  One stroke—not enough, not enough, but Steve forced himself to take his hand away, after.  The blue lace of the torn negligee, still hanging off his shoulders, tumbled into his face with the movement, and Steve blew a puff of air at it to send it off of his skin.  “Gooood.  Now then, what else did I want to make you do...
Gwen snapped, before going still as she saw Tasha take over, pushing pants and underwear down and stepping out of them.
It was quarter after five, which meant Steve would have been waking up in a few minutes, anyway.  He gave up on sleep for the night and sat up in bed, shifting his bare legs closer to Tony and watching the way the faint illumination from the windows played palely in Tony's dark hair.
“Good to know—then I won’t feel too guilty about this lace.”  She picked out a bra, stepping into Gwen’s space to hold it up against Gwen’s chest.  “Should work,” she observed.  “Here, put it on.”
Tony held Steve’s gaze, his heart skipping another few beats as he did so. There was no reason for such a reaction. Steve’s eyes weren’t any different from anyone else’s…
“You keep me warm,” Steve said finally, one hand coming between them to find Tony’s and hold it. “But let’s go back.”
The first bulge slid into him with no more sensation than he had felt at first in this process, so Steve pushed on immediately to the second.  That he felt, but again, it was like the single finger.
“I thought I had one with me,” Rhodey said, coming over to crouch by Steve. “Here’s one of the earliest issues we released. Featuring yours truly…and the suit,” he added, giving Tony a sidelong glance and a small smirk.
to make her opinion known, smiling widely and too brightly.  “Gosh, do you think I could have some more champagne, Tasha?  It’s so bubbly.”
When she actually tried the damned thing on, though, Stark took one look and immediately shook her head in disgust.  “What are you
And there went this half-baked lead of Tony’s. He was still running out of time to fix his heart, but he found that he couldn’t regret finding Steve.
After another night in the foothills, they reached Jarvis’s camp in the early afternoon. To his credit, Jarvis only blinked twice on seeing Tony and Rhodey come back with a third person in tow. He didn’t seem to recognize Steve either, but he didn’t mind handing out more of their food for Steve to eat or pulling out additional blankets.
Steve coiled, twisting to the side, and then uncoiled, arms flying out. A colorful blur escaped his hands – the
Supposedly dead father actually being alive and brainwashed into being the leader of an evil organization made up of Nazis? Yeah, that seemed like a horror story for kids but was a fact of Tony’s life.
Tasha shook out of her grip, pulling back enough to get her hand on Gwen’s chest, finding a nipple and thumbing it into a small, dense point through her clothes.  It felt like warm honey being poured over her breast, her nerves lighting up and singing at the unaccustomed sensation, and that was before Tasha took the nipple between her fingers and pinched gently.  “Medical device,” she said breezily as Gwen moaned and arched.  “Don’t worry about it.”
“We weren’t on the frontlines either,” Rhodey pointed out, breaking probably about fifteen different regulations that Fury had Tony look over before sending him out anywhere (or was it twenty? Tony had stopped paying attention after a certain point).
“Let’s take this elsewhere,” Steve said, ignoring Tony (which was honestly insulting but it wasn’t like Tony could protest about it right now). “You don’t want to do this here.”
take. He just…always seemed to be able to exceed that and then end up at the brink of death, only to come back through some miracle or another.
Tony fired his own gun, not even aiming at anything specific. It was enough to make Zemo flinch and have his next shot go wide, clipping the top of the truck instead of Steve. The cloth caught on fire from the impact (but that wasn’t important, not as important as
A few seconds later, Tony gave a little jump.  It was a comic sort of movement, not a scared one; it reminded Steve of the sorts of motions cartoons used to make.  Tony sat up, his hand moving from kneecap to thigh, rubbing down the length of it and back up, rucking up the dark, widely-spaced hairs there.
The name clicked into place, and Tony found himself smiling at Steve Rogers before he could rethink it. “Nice to meet you, Steve. I’d offer you a drink, but the accommodations aren’t exactly the best.”
Tony exhaled through his teeth, whistling softly under his breath. “Figure out who he is, where he came from. Preferably how he got here but I’ll take what I can get. Keep him out of the government’s hands. I’ll take it step by step.”
Gwen snapped her own panties as easily as she had Tasha’s shirt, and the dress practically sang in relief at being allowed to roll up over the curve of her backside.  She allowed Tasha to position her hands so that she braced on the doorway, permitted her legs to be kicked apart until they hit the edges of the frame so that Tasha could position herself between them, head and shoulders bracing Gwen’s legs apart.
Tony’s knees gave out.  Steve released him as he tumbled to the floor.  Steve himself was more intact, still upright under his own power, and not at all because he was clinging to the edge of the conference table with his free hand.
“Won’t it?” Zemo was probably raising an eyebrow under that mask. His arm moved, most likely drawing a gun, but he didn’t have a chance to do anything else.
“Maybe he was frozen because he got on somebody’s bad side,” Tony said. “I know there are some that would have liked to freeze me and stick me somewhere to forget about.”
Tasha’s fingers were warm—too warm, really—against her throat, checking her pulse and brushing against the over-heavy necklace she had been decked out in.  Gwen felt her pulse beating against those fingers, one, two, heavier than it should be.  Five, six.  She really needed to get up and fight the armor.
Tasha rolled her nipple between her teeth once more, and then released it.  “C’mon,” she muttered, tugging against Gwen’s grip, trying to move her mouth upward.  Gwen let her, and she placed savage bites along Gwen’s chest as they rocked together.  “Come on, come for me—come against me,
Steve whimpered—there was no other word for it—but did it, raising his left hand to his chest and rubbing, pinching, squeezing first one nipple, then the other.
“If I have to,” Tony said. “First things first, we’re going to find out what happened to his team. If we get that, finding the rest should be easier. They were in the Army, so there are going to be records of their enlistment, even if most of it is censored.”
“Jesus fuck!” Tasha yelped, her hands closing suddenly a lot harder on Gwen’s rear.  Gwen dropped her own hands down to Tasha’s ass and lifted, holding Tasha up far enough to get her mouth on one of those too-tempting nipple rings, only to freeze.
The plug was tugging at his rim on every withdrawal, and Steve couldn’t quite manage to form words.  He fucked himself harder and faster, though, and Tony got the message.  “You would—oh, God, I’m so fucking close, Steve—you would love it.  The vibrations—
Gwen laughed quietly, letting her gaze move off to the side in embarrassment.  “Well then, from one tactical expert to another?”  She waited until Stark had looked up, waited until there was eye contact and attention and
Like a key in a lock, the thought turned over in Steve’s mind, and, mystery solved, Steve was happy to throw the covers back and stand out of the bed.
“I’d lick around it,” Tony said, “and move it gently inside you.  Probe around until I found the prostate—”  Steve didn’t need the prodding, but at this angle, he couldn’t do more than brush it.  He strained, and sobbed in frustration.  “I’d slip another one in, then.  Twist them in your entrance as I slowly moved my mouth away, biting at the delicious globes of your ass as I moved.
of a “teammate” of his had almost ruined everything— and Thor hadn’t helped!  It was only the fact that there was nowhere for Loki to go that allowed them to take him into custody in the end, and even then, they caught him trying to slink away to civilization.  And if he had managed it,
Steve woke up as far as a half-daze when Tony urged him to take off his boots and go to bed properly, but by the time Steve had stripped off his pants and crawled under the covers—uncomfortable; he usually wore pajama pants, and his bare legs felt odd against the sheets—he was already falling back asleep.
shield, the star being the center point. It was surrounded by rings of red, white, and blue, exactly like the American flag. And underneath it…
Steve helped them break camp the next morning, doing so in such an efficient manner that Tony highly suspected he was military. Even if his outfit definitely wasn’t anything the military would issue their soldiers.
“Yes.” Steve watched him with bright eyes, a small smile pulling at his lips and lightening his whole face. “You feel it, too, right?”
In the limousine, Stark presented her with one more thing: a small chest full of jewelry.  Earrings, bracelets, a necklace...  All were heavy, full of more sapphires and diamonds and gold, and Miss Stark urged Gwen to put them all on in the car, even taking off the plain gold studs she had been wearing.  “Staking a claim?” Gwen asked, meeting Stark’s eyes boldly.
It shouldn’t have been erotic, really.  Tony wasn’t exactly wearing lingerie.  His legs were bare from thighs to ankles, but it wasn’t anything sexy, he was just lounging around in boxer shorts and socks.  He was wearing a t-shirt and hoodie, too... an MIT hoodie, and—Steve squinted, then grinned to himself—fuzzy
There was shouting, and when Tony turned his head he could see Steve knocking Zemo out with a single beautiful punch and then crushing the gun in his bare hands. (Which was kind of hot when Tony thought about it, which he wasn’t doing now clearly because
They rolled when they landed, Tasha ending up on top, straddling one of Gwen’s powerful thighs.  She shot Gwen a
Tony rubbed at his mouth with his ungloved hand. Rhodey’s flashlight was trained on the shield, illuminating it. The way it was positioned and the amount of ice still left made it difficult to make out any features of this mysterious person beyond general facts like these were their legs, torso, arms, etc.
Steve shuddered, pressing sharply against his throbbing penis, and Tony, before him, squeezed his eyes closed and came, spilling in three sharp splurts onto the coverlet.
“We have no idea where we’re going, do we,” Rhodey said about an hour into their hike. “Are we just going to keep following this path?”
brown eyes full of mischief and hunger, and dropped to her elbows, slithering her whole body along Gwen’s so that Gwen gasped and gasped.  “Yes,” Gwen said again, wrapping her arms around Tasha and pulling her in closer, closer,
At any rate, his heart was fully charged and he’d make sure it stayed that way before heading off on that hike they had planned.
would I give you some fingers.  I’d start with one—did you start that way, too, when you put the plug in?”
hard he had gotten, though, and without even noticing, that was interesting.  He closed his hand around himself brusquely.  It didn’t take much, only five short strokes before he was spattering the sides of the shower in white blots and ribbons.
Eventually, however, even the faint path they were following trailed off into nothing, and it was up to Tony to figure out where to go. He hesitated briefly before continuing on, striking a path that gradually led them upwards deeper into the mountains.
“You’re going to go to Fury with this? I thought we said you weren’t going to do that considering how we found him.”
Tony stared at him in wonder, pressing his lips together in an effort not to laugh at the outrageous statement (or more like how Steve said it). “Seriously? I was joking.”
Steve had been out of town for three days, two of them dealing with a situation in Argentina involving somebody improbably known as “Paste-Pot Pete,” and then one day debriefing about the glue-related mishap to the CIA.  Steve did that a lot, the debriefing with extant national agencies, so he still had his apartment in DC and could have spent the night there.  But he had
“I was going to say we barely know each other,” Tony said, tone low. “They know me and don’t care, but everyone else will. We won’t be in the middle of the mountains forever.”
“Yes,” Tony said finally, opening his eyes to meet Steve’s. He moved forward to press a quick kiss to Steve’s mouth. “As long as you want.”
Steve murmured a nearly inaudible “thank you” into Tony’s neck and exhaled, relaxing into Tony’s hold.
He threw himself in-between the gun and Steve in the scant seconds he had, heard something that sounded like someone shouting his name, and then felt something blow him off his feet and to the ground several feet away from Zemo. He found himself staring up at the sky, gasping for air that wouldn’t come and feeling strangely numb.
The tunnel they were in narrowed at points and occasionally the ceiling lowered, leaving them stooped over. At one point it was so low that they ended up leaving their backpacks behind, taking only what they could strap to their persons.
– seemed to glance at Steve. It was difficult to tell with the mask over his head. After a moment he seemingly dismissed Steve and returned his focus to Tony.
Steve didn’t answer immediately, and Tony couldn’t read his face in the dark. But then he shifted, head turning to look down at Tony. He reached a hand down, waiting for something until Tony realized that he was willing to pull him up.
Steve had sat up.  His hole ached as the change in position put pressure on the plug, and once again he clenched around it involuntarily as a low, wanton noise slipped out of him.  His cock, and the small, steel plug in the head of it, had slipped out from under the edge of the lace, just as Tony had asked for.
He reached the mound of snow and ice in the center, crouching as he came close to see what the metallic star was.
Steve nodded and ripped.  The negligee was silk and therefore surprising strong, but Steve was stronger.  He felt his biceps bulge and his pecs twitch beneath the silk as he strained, and then the filmy fabric ripped, tearing in two right down the center, leaving his chest, stomach, and genitals plain to Tony’s view.
hand...?  Oh.  It was still tight in his hair, a small, delicious tension.  He forced his fingers to uncurl, surprised by how much he didn’t want to do it.
There were six visible HYDRA minions that he could make out from his vantage point. There were probably more to the front where Jarvis and Rhodey had been.
They would tell her that there was a meeting scheduled; she would put on one of the horrible, ultra-fashionable dresses they had given her—ultra-fashionable for her time, that was, which probably meant they were all hideous now—and wait for them at her door.  One of the junior secretaries—usually these were men, and if they were women, they were never in a dress like her own—would escort her to one of the three thousand meeting rooms apparently located in this complex.  She would spend the entire meeting, usually fifteen minutes to an hour long, doing what amounted to nothing more than glad-handing, and then, just before the boredom became too
Tasha stepped back.  “Thank you,” she repeated.  As Gwen watched, a trace of real regret passed across her face before being covered by the familiar hard shell.  “I have work to do now,” Tasha continued.  “I’d love to trust that your offer is real... but I can’t.  I’m sure you understand.”
(which was definitely not being used like a shield right now) – and hit Zemo directly in the chest, knocking him flat over. And then the shield rebounded back into Steve’s hands.
Steve froze, but the order hadn’t been addressed to him.  Tony leaned over for the lube, slicking his hand and then returning to his previous position.  His eyes closed in bliss as he gave himself a slow, firm pump, and when he opened them again, they gleamed.  “Rewind.  ...Now play, at... thirty percent speed.”
He took the mental image and flipped it, sending it back to Stark, and now the image was a fabricated one, of Steve's same lips crushed into dark hair, soft red fabric slipping against the side of his face as he took Stark’s cock all the way down.
Tony rolled to his belly, then clambered to his knees and then his feet.  “And, unfortunately, I need to go help Banner locate the Cube. Good we got this settled, though— that was... good, yes.”
Steve looked rather perplexed, not reacting as Rhodey let out a small “ah-ha!” and pulled out a rather beaten issue of
Tony inhaled sharply, lips parting, and his hands grasped Steve’s arms, fingers tightening in his shirt sleeves (which were so tightly fitted over Steve’s ridiculous biceps that it was a miracle nothing had torn yet). He pressed back, feeling like this was
Tony wasn’t about to cut him open to find out if he bled, but judging from the darker patches on his uniform, he would guess that was a yes. Whether it was red blood or something else wasn’t clear, but he’d opt for red.
Steve let out a shuddering exhale. “We were fighting HYDRA,” he said quietly. “But…something went wrong. Someone else was there. And he…” He frowned. “I…I don’t know what happened after that.”
There was some kind of a device embedded in Tasha’s chest, pale blue and shimmering.  It emitted light—light that the thick, soft sweatshirt had blocked, and suddenly Gwen found it a lot easier to understand Tasha’s affection for the masculine style of suits—and, when Gwen put her hand on it, she felt the smallest, most microscopic of vibrations.
They leaned into the kiss at the same time, then relaxed, their foreheads pressing together.  Steve thought about what Tony was saying as he dropped one more kiss on Tony’s nose and took them down into the water together.  Tony cuddled into Steve’s chest as Steve lathered up that froo-froo plastic thing Tony used instead of a washcloth.
Steve sucked gently and swirled his tongue around Tony’s index finger twice, cleaning the last of Tony’s juices from it with his tongue, then let it pop from his mouth.  “You really object?” he asked lazily.
“Probably a good idea,” Tony agreed, his own voice just as breathless to his ears. “Even if I wish everything was fine.” He swallowed, taking several more breaths and feeling his heart return to a more relaxed rhythm. No one was going to let him do anything strenuous for a while after this, which was a shame since Tony and inactivity did not mix well together (Pepper had an entire book full of incidents, most of which had been contributed by Rhodey).
Tasha groaned and rubbed her hand over her face, seemingly unaware that she was smearing her makeup even more badly than it already had been.  “You know what the problem with this is, right?  The plan
Mountain climbing was neither of their fortes. Tony usually went for jungles (and caves; caves seemed to be a staple of his career).
He didn’t become aware of the bond again until he was mid-confrontation with Stark.  He had been planning to check on Doctor Banner first, but Stark caught him in the hallway outside the lab, spinning him aside into what looked like a small meeting room of some kind and, ominously, sealing the door behind them.
But it didn’t add up. His pulse points were the same as a human. He breathed the same as a human. He
“After ripping us new ones, sure.” Tony exhaled, rubbing the back of his neck as his skin continued to prickle uncomfortably. “This isn’t the first time we’ve done this, Rhodey.”
When the kiss finally broke, they remained silent for a long, easy minute.  Eventually, though, Tasha stirred.  “Did you mean it?” she asked.  Her voice sounded like didn’t particularly care what Gwen’s answer was, but her back, Gwen noticed, was tense as a board beneath Gwen’s hand.
Steve had kissed him goodbye for long, slow minutes, his hands curving around the mechanized rear and lifting.  He liked the feel of this, sometimes; the struggle to lift something as heavy as the suit.  Made him feel like he was a normal guy, again, just cuddling his sweetheart...
“We won’t,” Tony said, looking ahead. Was there another hole in the wall there? He shivered briefly, a sudden spate of cold seeming to blow past him. “I…don’t think it’s much further.”
“Of course you can—the third option is the one where I set you up against a dildo—or a vibrator, even better—and let you fuck yourself onto it.”
“I feel like I know you,” Steve murmured. “I feel like I’ve known you for years. Ridiculous, isn’t it?”
The cuffs, she discovered, were large ones, almost an inch thick and most of a foot long.  Even her fingers were pinned, spread out with bars of metal between them.  She was still wearing Stark’s jewelry, and she snorted aloud to herself at the sight.
"Run your hand up over your neck,” Tony ordered.  Steve’s breath hissed out as he did it, trying to move slowly to keep it as sexy as possible.  His cock was achingly hard, hidden by the negligee and his own posture, throbbing around the stopper in the tip.  “Scratch a bit, nice—and then into your hair.  Pull it gently."
Jarvis and Rhodey had taken down the two minions who’d had guns to their heads and were looking rather at a loss for what to do now.
“The vibrations!  Would.  They would... good.  As you fucked yourself back on it.  Jesus.  And then—then what?  Do you think—”
. Granted, sometimes it seemed like he did with all the shit that happened every time he went to try and find something to heal his heart.
Tony woke up a little at that, looked at them both, at the shreds of Steve negligee and at the obscene artwork which was their chests, which had smeared together when Tony was riding Steve.  “I’ll say,” he smirked.  “We do good work.”
Slowly, the Steve on the screen clenched his jaw.  His neck arched, and his back, and then his hips thrust slowly through the air above the chair and jizz was flying artistically, twisting acrobatically to splatter across the recorded Steve’s abs, and it was—beautiful, actually.
“I don’t.” Steve shifted, placing a hand over the torn cloth on his right side. “Was there anyone else here?” He sounded half-hopeful and half like he was expecting the answer to be no.
Oh.  He shook his head.  “Not with the plug,” he managed.  “I did—earlier—before it was in.  Should be good for a while.”  He rubbed the lace over his nipple again and lost some time, remembering he had been saying something only when he was reminded by the sound of Tony’s harsh breathing.  “You can go more than once, right?”
“I should say yes…” Steve looked down to where Tony’s hand was touching his arm. Tony went to retract it, only to stop when Steve placed his own hand over his. “But I don’t want to. I don’t want to keep hoping and be let down when we find nothing. When I already have what I need right here.”
Steve shouted loudly, far louder than he ever would've back in the day—too much risk that someone would've overheard, nowhere nearly so safe as it was here.  But Tony's mouth was a miracle, and maybe if he'd had that back in the day he
It took Rhodey a little longer than Tony since he actually took the entire backpack with him. He left Tony’s abandoned supplies down there, although still hidden behind a pile of rocks.
Tony shook his head, not even bothering to justify that with an answer. (Especially since he didn’t exactly have one.)
“Nineteen forty-five?” Steve said it uncertainly, like he wasn’t sure what Tony was expecting of him. He put the remnants of his meal down. “How long has it been?” He sounded faintly terrified, like he expected it to have been decades since he went under.
“Right.”  It was hard to think.  His mind was cloudy and thick, like a small stream overfilled with floodwaters, turbulent and swollen.  He breathed out hard as he pushed a finger past his rim, all the way in.  It entered easily; Steve’s hole was still loose from the plug.
Cole, the hair stylist, proved to be a slim young man with about fifteen colors and as many piercings on his own head.  He spoke with a lisp of people and events Gwen knew nothing about, but when she asked questions he proved happy to fill her in on the background.  She mostly kept quiet and let him talk as he worked; it was interesting.
The third and final bulge of the toy was a different story.  Surprisingly so, considering that it was actually narrower than the two fingers he had just been using—but then, it was round, so even as it was narrower, it was also wider in the other dimension.  There was a feeling of ease as he closed around the narrow column at the base of the toy.  The flat end of the plug was long and narrow, a teardrop-shaped footprint which settled easily between his cheeks.  He could still feel it, though, pushing gently at the sides of his crevice, holding him open as sweetly as you would hold a spun sugar candy.
She was an impressive sight; her legs were long and tanned, lean muscles showing clearly under smooth, even skin.  Her hips were trim and flat, her butt round, again mostly from muscle.
Rhodey’s hand on his arm tightened, and Tony blinked again, now taking a step back into the tunnel. The cold of the room seemed to follow him, clinging to his face.
Steve pursed his lips, clearly thinking. “Vibranium,” he answered finally. “It’s the rarest metal on Earth. Absorbs impacts like nothing else.”
found herself unable to conceive of any other presentation for this woman, who was, by all accounts, so much more powerful than Gwen herself was.
Tony was taking his time, stroking himself slowly.  Playing with it, almost.  He had the lube nearby, Steve could see it, but he wasn’t going for it yet, maybe because he had something planned that needed clean fingers or maybe just because he liked it dry.  The two of them hadn’t been together long enough for Steve to know for sure, yet.  They hadn’t even been together long enough for Steve to know about
“Maybe…” Steve wet his lips, closing his eyes briefly. “Maybe there’s something I can do to help. Maybe it wasn’t a mistake that you came out here.”
He turned the showerhead on the mess, then reached for the other device, a kind of plug unromantically called a sperm stopper, and the antiseptic lube.  He had ten minutes before Tony was scheduled to arrive; he was going to have to hurry if he wanted to be ready in time.
Steve woke an hour or so later.  The room was dark—thanks, FRIDAY—and Tony was making little whimpers and jerking in his sleep.  Steve gently disengaged himself, only to find that they were actually stuck together, and every square inch of skin above his knees was itchy.  He shuddered and woke Tony.
It wasn’t like Gwen couldn’t spot the difference.  She looked down at her adorable bronze dress and huffed to herself, annoyed at having to be annoyed at anything so cute.  At first, she hadn’t said anything because SHIELD seemed to have some sort of plan in mind for her reintroduction to society.  But at some point along the way, the plan seemed to have gone sideways: Gwen recognized a holding pattern when she saw it.  Now, she was mostly just spooling out enough rope for them to hang themselves on.
“That’s kind of what we were hoping you could tell us,” Tony said. “Including how you were somehow frozen in a block of ice.”
Warmth bloomed in Tony’s chest, and he had to close his eyes and swallow against the sudden thickness in his throat. He didn’t know Steve (why did he keep telling himself this?), but he
Another pulse, followed by an interminable long wait, and then one more. The next one came faster than before.
Tony took a moment to reflect on why the hell Steve would just fling himself into an unknown situation before he moved forward and poked his head out, significantly more cautious than Steve had been.
“Wrap your left hand around your throat. Don't squeeze, but dig your fingers into the side of your throat as if you were going to.”   Steve's pulse kicked up, shocked—or excited—by the idea.  “Slide your right hand down your stomach—wait.  Slower. ...Good.  Now, slide your right hand down and wrap your fingers—slowly—around your cock.”  Steve’s heart pounded at that one, too.  Something about Tony’s voice and the way it caressed the obscenity...  “Let me see.  God, you look so good.  How does the plug feel?”
There’d been something in the mountains. It might not have been what he expected, but he’d found it all the same.
“Bright side? What bright side? We’re in a dark cave…” Rhodey pulled a face, shifted his weight, and nearly slipped.
It struck her as odd that Stark could talk circles around Fury, though.  He was usually cannier than that.
Steve gasped as Tony's roving hand dropped even lower, cupping the lower curve of his rear and squeezing.  Tony's right hand was moving too, now, dropping from where it had cradled his cheek down to his neck, squeezing lightly before continuing downward.
Tony shook his head, entire focus on the sole contact he had with this mysterious man. Something seemed to pulse under his fingers.
This was one of those times where he was stretching, hoping that there’d be something here but more of the opinion that there’d be nothing but a cool artifact that would make a nice story for the magazine. And maybe the artifact would be one for the museums or one that should be left in a dark hole where no one would ever find it again.
“So you’re an adventurer?” Steve seemed stuck on this one topic, as he’d looked slightly surprised upon finding out what Tony did for a living. It was strange since Tony made no secret of what he did, and his name was well known (not to boast but it was the truth).
moving, and so were her head, and her legs, all pulled backwards and up without Gwen’s input by the manacle-like shoes and jewelry she was covered in.  Her abused and aching muscles screamed at her.
The words hung in the air between them, and they stared at each other, loose-limbed and relaxed except for when the truck jolted.
Tasha dropped to her knees, pulling Gwen’s skirt up with fast, nimble fingers.  “Let me,” she demanded.  Her voice was still harsh, demanding; a woman accustomed to being obeyed.  “Let me taste you—come on, pull those off—”
Sure, Europe and the Americas had its fair share of mountain ranges, but they were tame in comparison to the Himalayas.
Wrapped in each other’s arms, tangled together, smeared with the evidence of half a dozen orgasms between them, at last, they came to a halt.
“Not that long,” Steve said. “He didn’t know me, and he wanted you. Rhodey…he told me a little about who Zemo is to you, why he called you ‘son.’” His smile was wry. “He’s never called me that.”
They’d been underground for the rest of the day, and Tony’s watch told him it was past midnight. They should set up camp and warm up, try to make sure Steve really was as fine as he seemed.
Steve caught the mental image of himself:  splayed out on the conference table, legs spread wide where he sat on the edge, his weight back on his hands as Stark’s dark fingers curled around his cock.  His face, he could see, was ecstatic. His mouth was open, lips pink and trembling.
Gwen shivered, not entirely because of the chill in the air.  She looked more closely at her wrists, where the metal frame held her.  Her arms weren’t over her head, but rather off to each side like the Vitruvian man.  Good; Gwen had proven that she could recover from loss of circulation, but the pins and needles was like getting eaten alive by fire ants.  Best to avoid it.
Tony would have said no and then blown their base up for kicks before they injected him with the Zemo serum.
She sort of thought Stark might expect her to go slow; to be tentative in the face of a woman’s touch.  No one these days seemed to realize that Gwen had been with a woman before—and frankly, it was far enough from being their business that Gwen had been reluctant to share that fact.  But it meant she didn’t hesitate when she leaned in, that she wasn’t afraid to press close.  She cupped Tasha’s face in both hands and brushed her thumbs along the cheekbones.
“Was that for the motion, or the way I said it?” Tony asked.  Steve tipped his head forward.  “Hmm...  Is it the word cock that you like?”
Steve smiled weakly.  "We don't have to, if you don't want," he temporized.  "I just thought, you know...  You might like it."
Something hard and possessive flared briefly in Stark’s eyes before closing off completely, and Stark suddenly became much more polite, if more distant.  Still, within minutes, she was talking circles around Coulson, and when Fury arrived—as reinforcements, Gwen suspected—she talked circles around him, too, until she had arranged for Gwen to accompany her to some party the next night—a charity benefit, Gwen thought.
“I…” Tony looked up at the looming mountains, one hand pressing against the repulsor plate covering the glass plate protecting his heart. “Yes…?”
Steve groaned in agreement and pushed on the plug, rocking his hips to feel the ache of it.  His cock was already throbbing.  He knew instinctively that this would be the last orgasm of the night, and it was going to be a doozy.
Only Tony couldn’t help but keep looking over his shoulder, just to see Rhodey there and no one else. Or rubbing at his exposed skin when it prickled like he was getting goosebumps but not quite.
Stark’s hands were on him, then, opening the catches in the uniform, unzipping all five thousand of Steve’s useless zippers until he could pull Steve out and push Steve’s shorts down around his hips.
There was a loud shout from the front, followed by a sharp jerk of the truck that had Tony slamming into the crate to his right, suddenly grateful that they were packed in like sardines back here. It would have been worse if there’d been more room.
"There's a chair by the door," Steve said.  He offered a warm smile, hoping it came out sultry but not really holding his breath for it.  Warm would have to do.  "I thought you might like...”
Tasha's clever hands ran up the backs of Gwen’s legs, inserting themselves under the too-tight hem of Gwen’s dress, cupping her rear and then
There had been plenty of times where he’d thought he was a goner – before and during the war – and there would come the time where he really
touching her lightly, too lightly, a tease compared to the tugging, sucking explosion of sensation which was Tasha’s mouth.
Turning his head to the side, Tony saw Steve sleeping on a pallet by the entrance to the tent. The shield (the shield that defied physics and holy shit Tony wanted to study it even more now) was half-lying on top of a toolkit that Tony recognized as being where their medical supplies were stashed.
Tony blinked, lips tingling from where Steve had been kissing him only moments before. He felt dazed, the entire world having shifted on its axis in some imperceptible way (Steve kissed him,
Gwen groaned and did it again, grinding down against Tasha’s leg, and Tasha gave a bitten-off whimper in response.
Tasha’s knees buckled and she sagged against Gwen’s hold.  Slowly, Gwen lowered her down to the floor, wrapping her in her arms and rolling them, pinning Tasha to the wall with a knee flung over her just in time: it took Tasha a minute to regain her sensibility after her climax, but once she did, she tensed into rigidness, lying stiffly in Gwen’s grasp.
It took two seconds before Tony was sitting next to Steve on a cramped boulder, having been lifted like he was nothing but a backpack filled with leaves. Steve was warm, and Tony couldn’t help but huddle closer.
been just as loud...  It was like his nipple had lines tying it to his limbs, his stomach, his dick; puppet strings, and when Tony bit, they pulled.
Tony snorted without lifting his head, rubbing his forehead against Steve's legs before sighing happily and rising to his knees.  "You still can," he pointed out, flopping next to Steve on the bed.
That sound shouldn’t be so soothing, but it was a testament to his life and the frequent near misses he had with his heart that it was probably the best lullaby he’d ever heard.
“I don’t know,” Steve said. “Not really. Only that when I’m with you, it feels like everything will be fine. That I’m not alone, that I
The plug was about five inches long, about four of which was designed to be inside the body, and that was one inch more than Steve could comfortably hold in his mouth without gagging; the plastic was somehow much worse than when it was Tony he was swallowing.  He tried three times before giving up on it, and instead cleaned it off with his mouth and tongue as best he could before setting it down.  There were a couple of soft gasps behind him when he was done, followed by some slick sounds and a moan.
Gwen gritted out at her, “I was still conscious when you picked me up by that ugly jewelry you have decked me out in!”
“We always were,” Steve said, “one way or another.” He tensed, arms tightening around his knees, trembles running briefly through his body. “Something went wrong, I think. There was someone else there, but I can’t remember who. Only that he wanted to help.” He paused, turning his face to look at Tony. “And then it was cold,” he whispered.
. It felt like it was pressing down on his shoulders, and the prickling at the back of his neck was constant now.
The crates for the Iron Man armor remained untouched, although Steve eyed them curiously while he ate.
Steve moaned again.  He forced his fingers to release, letting his hand fall, palm up, onto the top of his thigh.
Steve stopped scrubbing for a moment.  “I love you, too,” he said seriously.  “Does this mean you’re not going to hide your kinks from me like they’re dirty little secrets anymore?”
“You should buy me a dress,” Gwen said specifically to Stark just as the negotiations were concluding—largely without her input, but then, she had been biding her time.
“That’s great. If you keep being good, we’re going to try and make it to the airship tomorrow.” With that said, Rhodey loudly tromped away.
The saying about never knowing what you’re missing until you have it did have something going for it.
It was very nice, and Tony was definitely enjoying this more than he should. Except for how the boulder they were sitting on was ice cold and the wind chill wasn’t anything to sniff at either.
Steve laughed, ducking his head, then looked up at Tony with a smile.  “Welcome home to me,” he said, raising his eyebrows.
Well, it didn’t matter. Tony wouldn’t let Zemo have him. He wasn’t going to let HYDRA turn him into another Zemo and use him to further their scheme for world domination.
They stared at each other, sprawled there, pants loose— Steve was most of the way to naked.  Stunned astonishment, entirely mutual, echoed between their minds.
She met Stark’s eyes as she unzipped the dress, letting it slip down to her waist where it stuck—quite predictably, given how tight it was.  She didn’t break eye contact as she changed into the bra, either, and she got to see the exact moment when Stark’s eyes dropped to her chest, darkening hungrily.  Gwen couldn’t blame her, really; she did have a
Steve lowered the shield slightly, his shoulders dropping an inch. “You…don’t know me?” He sounded dazed, as if the earth had vanished from under his feet (Tony would know – being an expert in finding himself in that exact situation multiple times).
herself backwards.  “Right,” she said, running her hands down her hips and turning away sharply.  “Right.  Let’s get Cole in here to do your hair, shall we?  I don’t do hair, you might have noticed—”
Just when it seemed like he was about to be done, the pressure around the cock plug became too much.  The ring under the glans stayed in place, but the plug itself swung free, and final stream of jizz, freshly released, poured out into Steve’s hand.
Tony fumbled for anything reflective, remembered that he had a metallic shield, and moved to hold it to the man’s lips before remembering that the shield was freezing cold and the likelihood of anything showing up would be—
Steve had watched Tony prep himself twice, now, so he had a general idea:  lots of lube, go slow, ease in, and if it’s too tense, massage a little and try again.  But the actual practice of putting the plug in...  Steve wasn’t expecting that.
“A gun,” Tony answered, since he practically always carried one now. Even when stashed away in the back of a truck. “Do you need one?”
She met Stark’s eyes in the mirror, and batted the falsies at her.  “Thank you so much,” she said, putting a heaping helping of coo into it.  “This is just what I had hoped for.”
“That I’m not from here. That my team isn’t here. That whatever happened to put me in that cave where you found me, it pulled me from my home. You knew that.”
champagne, anyway.)  “Ugh,” she said, casually tossing the glass in the air so that it sparkled in the light, rainbows flashing as it turned end over end before landing perfectly on a very startled waitress’s tray.  “How long until we’re done with this thing?”
Steve grinned, relieved.  He knew that sound.  That sound was a man who wanted desperately to believe something was true but couldn't quite bring himself to buy in without reassurance.  It was a very good sound.  "Completely serious," Steve said, leaning into his pose a bit more.  "How do you want me?"
“Hey, calm down.” Tony kept his voice calm and friendly, placing the shield carefully to the side. The man’s startlingly (gorgeous) blue eyes followed the movement, and his brow furrowed. “We’re friendlies.”
“It’s not something that comes up in casual conversation,” Tony said, even though that wasn’t the entire truth and Steve seemed to know it. He sighed. “It’s…not something I want people to know about.”
“You can rub your tits, if you want,” Tony offered generously.  “As long as you can hold that position with no hands, I mean.”
And the shadows were watching, even if Tony hadn’t come across any legends about the shadows eating people alive here. (Or ever, but he’d been in the game too long to dismiss the possibility entirely.)
The ghost that was still watching them seemed to mock him and the prickling hairs on the back of his neck. (He really hoped there wasn’t a ghost and just his overactive imagination thanks to Rhodey.)
Natasha Stark met her eyes in the mirror and then nodded with wide-eyed seriousness.  “No one’s going to know who you are,” she warned Gwen.
Letting out a slow exhale, Tony turned his head back to Rhodey. “You know how it is, Rhodey. The further we’re from civilization, the better the chances we find something.”
to that rule was a police chief who had, three days before, attended one of those charity functions with you.”  Gwen paused, and watched the knowledge pass over Tasha’s face.  “Exactly.  SHIELD didn’t spot it at the time, because the allegations only came to light months later, but from my perspective?  Pretty obvious, Stark.”
There was no recognition from the man at Tony’s name, and his eyes flickered briefly to Rhodey before returning to Tony.
All in a quest to try and find a way to keep his heart working beyond the mechanics of what he had in his chest. He’d been unsuccessful so far and had to put his search on temporary hold during World War II with Fury calling him in to help serve the country in the name of justice, spying, and sabotaging the other side, but the war was over now. Which left him free to continue his search and hope that his heart didn’t give out in the meantime.
“I’m a man who believes in science,” Tony said instead of answering the question. “I don’t know what this is, but it’s nothing that’s ever happened on any of my adventures before. But yes, Steve. I trust you.” He hesitated, then thought it was only fair to let Steve know some of what he’d been thinking. “I don’t know what’s going to happen once we’re back – if we’re able to find your team or not, Steve.”
“I would have just kissed it, first.  Little kisses, all around your pretty, pretty hole...  Almost delicate things, really.  This close to ticklish.”
“I don’t?” Zemo still had that tone of polite confusion, although it was now accompanied by an air of bemusement. “Why would I not?” He sounded slightly interested in Steve’s reasoning.
. This was something wholly unexpected and so neat that Tony was reminded of why he’d gone into this career choice to begin with. That it wasn’t just about his heart issues that brought him back to adventuring over and over again.
Tony hesitated briefly before nodding, exhaling sharply. He inched to the side to let Steve by, flexing his arm where Steve had held him tightly (yet gently).
“A vibrator,” Steve reminded him.  His hole clenched up at the very thought.  He was still so oversensitive right now that even the air felt like a tease, but his cock was filling and pulsing again, already back in the game now that it was free of the restriction of the plug.
Ex-lovers turned evil that kept wanting to kill Tony? …That story actually wasn’t entirely implausible, even if Tony got sick of people he thought he’d known stabbing him in the back.
As soon as Steve touched his fingers to his outstretched tongue, Tony went off.  He came half out of his chair with the force of the orgasm, hips pumping into his hand as he shot load after load into the air.  It arched and twisted and finally dropped, landing messily on the carpeting, white against beige.
nice touch, using the AI’s monitoring equipment; that’s resourceful, good job—and then—no, not your hands; I want your hands free, put your chest all the way down on the bed.  That’s it.  Head turned away from me, since we’re doing this.”
“This should really be happening in a hospital,” Rhodey said, coming to crouch by Tony. “But we’d never have gotten him out.”
By the time Tony entered, Steve was lounging mostly on his right side, top knee drawn upwards and obscuring his groin, the other stretched out straight behind him.  The enhanced rear view on the oversized screen helpfully showed off the curve of his ass, but only faintly hinted at the dark solid curve of the plug.  His weight was largely on his right arm, like it would be for a side plank, while the left arm draped backwards over his hip.  The position required him to twist a little at the waist and felt a bit casual, but it certainly
Steve tested it out.  His muscles were loose and happy as they always were after an orgasm, but his cock and hole were two different stories.  His cock was throbbing around the stopper—not in a bad way, but it was sensitive; he hadn’t twitched his right hand since his orgasm ended—and he was too over-sensitive in the wake of his orgasm to want to do anything with the plug.  “Mostly pretty good,” he decided.  “Maybe not any direct touch for a couple minutes.”
On the giant screen, his abs were glistening in fluorescent lights, gleaming with sweat and bearing a series of filthy sharpie marks, outlining the places where his own jizz had fallen.  He was gasping—on the screen—and twitching, obviously
Tony didn’t answer, eyes on the shield that Rhodey had just tapped. His nails had clinked against the metal, but it hadn’t sounded normal…
Putting in the plug was the oddest part.  Steve hadn’t done much of that—not much anal play in general, really—but he knew Tony liked it, liked receiving specifically.  And he had a hunch Tony wouldn’t switch things around without Steve prompting him in some way.  So,
She sent Mr. Hefner off to get her a drink, then turned and vanished before he could come back; she did the same for Mr. Spacey, except that for him she waited to receive the drink, then took one sip and set it on the empty tray of a passing waiter.  (She only fantasized for a second about taking the tray and throwing it around the room, bouncing it off of too-coiffured heads.)  Mr. Weinstein talked to her bosoms; she casually crossed her arms beneath them, tensing her biceps to make it look as if the bosoms were talking back.  When Mr. Wayne smothered a chortle at the sight, she winked and wrote Agent Bowers’ phone number on his arm in lip liner.
“It’s been a little while since you’ve been around,” Tony opted to say, even if that was a piss-poor excuse.
“If you’re going to tell me I don’t know you, I’m just going to have to say I disagree,” Steve said, glowering. “Because I do. I know exactly what I need to. And…” The glower transitioned to something much more uncertain. “Whatever I don’t…I can learn?”
over the bond and Stark choked.  He tore at Steve’s collar, giving him access to golden skin, and sank his teeth in over the collarbone, right where it would sting and ache and bruise the most.
Her hands were wandering all over, touching and testing and then moving onward again, drifting over Gwen’s too-tight dress and bare legs as lightly as a silk nightgown.  Gwen craved; she wanted
Rhodey was right, but…Tony couldn’t help but think that was ridiculous (which was in itself a stupid notion to have because he didn’t even
Or was this something else?  Steve pictured the scene again; the way Tony had set up all his accoutrements first, the way he had settled in wearing a somewhat unusual combination of clothes...
be fine but Tony ignored it (after all the times Rhodey had given him that look, Tony had it down to an art form).
Tony rubbed at the skin carefully, expecting the throb of pain that resulted from the touch. It wasn’t terribly bad, but he was lucky he hadn’t bruised all his ribs on top of that. Maybe one or two judging from how it hurt to take too deep a breath, but it was nothing that wouldn’t heal in time. They weren’t broken, so that was a positive.
Looking down, Tony saw that the ice had started melting even faster, and he could now see the features of the unlucky soul who had been flash frozen. It was a man in some kind of ridiculously spangly uniform that was also red, white, and blue. There were rips and tears along the legs and one along the man’s right flank that should have drawn blood.
“How nice for you,” Zemo said condescendingly. “I’m sure your esteemed nation could use such a fine captain. Now please step aside. I came to this forsaken place for a reason and it wasn’t to trade words with a nobody.”
“Relax, Rhodey,” Tony murmured, sweeping the beam of the flashlight over the walls and ceiling. The tunnel went on for a while, curving to the right. “This isn’t a lost temple.”
Her room was full of books and old records, the walls beige, the furniture too soft.  She had requested a sketchbook three times, but had yet to receive one.
He shoved the thought away and got his breathing under control, not wanting to interrupt Tony, not wanting to barge in now that things had gotten going.  But it was quickly becoming obvious, as the Steve on the screen groaned and the Tony in the room echoed the noise, that Tony was enjoying the watching, enjoying the show past-Steve had put on.  It wasn’t just that the Steve on the screen was orgasming—orgasming a lot,
Steve was ambidextrous, one of the few gifts of the serum that had genuinely surprised him, and he used his left hand to slip a finger inside.
“Hnnngggh,” Tony said.  “Steve.  Yes.  I am—I am willing to do that, absolutely, I am—are you sure you can’t come with the plug in?”
Tony took a few more deep breaths. “I notice you’re saying nothing about the fact we found an actual human being frozen in a cube of ice in a cave in the Himalayas.”
“God, look at you!”  It wasn’t the first time Tony had said that, Steve noticed.  “You’re gorgeous, Steve.  I could watch you for hours.”  Steve’s cock twitched, and Tony smiled warmly.  “Like that idea, too, huh?  Get your knee up, foot on the bed and lean back on your hands.  I want to look at all of you.”
Silently, Steve stepped forward, crossing the distance to kneel beside Tony, trying not to look at his own passionate face, frozen on the paused video in an expression of horrible vulnerability.  He circled the end of the bed and came up beside Tony before sitting.  The bed dipped under his weight and Tony shot upright.
Gwen waited, but the voice had fallen silent, and despite giving it time to resume speaking, it stayed that way.
Tony reached out and took another pump of lube and switched hands, stroking his cock with his left while dipping his right hand behind himself.  Steve had a perfect angle to watch as Tony leaned forward, fingers sliding beneath the loose boxers.  It was easy to see the fabric distorting, marking the progress as Tony reached for his own hole.
Tasha looked briefly irritated.  “Yes, and you aren’t known for any special skills in that arena at all, either,” she snapped, then looked even sicker.
His pulse raced ahead, outrunning even his rasping breathing, and he jerked back against the wall again.  Tony was watching
It got a chuckle out of Steve, which Tony was calling a success after the gloomy looks of the last so many minutes. “No, definitely not that one. I don’t know if you know him in this world, but the man who created it was Abraham Erskine, and I was part of Project Rebirth.”
She was, she realized, still wearing the thick, bejeweled bonds that Tasha had coaxed her into before that stupid party.  They clung like magnets to the thick metal frame of the door—or maybe not like magnets; quite possibly they were something more powerful.  Gwen frowned, sex-stupid and slow, trying to figure out what was wrong with them.
It had been a while, but Steve was reasonably sure he could still remember how to follow through, if Stark took him up on the offer.
Steve blinked and jolted forward automatically, although he hadn’t made it any further than shifting his weight forward before he was pulling back again, lingering in the shadows.
“Yeah, just like that.”  Tony dropped a hand to his cock, stroking it casually.  “You’d be wriggling beneath me, desperate for something harder.  Once you were writhing, I’d kiss you right on your sweet little hole, but I’d still keep it pretty light.  Mayyyybe lick over the surface, gently, but nothing too fierce.  Pull your balls out of the way for me, I want a clearer view—no, keep leaning on the other hand.  That’s right.”  Steve’s balls were sweaty, but already hardening again as his cock filled and lifted.  “God, and you got it in blue.  That’s perfect, Steve.  Well done.”
Steve was furious, but not so angry that he was alone in his own head.  As he followed Iron Man into the helicarrier— Stark the younger, and boy, if Steve had thought
For a second, Tony didn’t say anything.  His eyes roved over Steve’s body with a look that was half awe, half calculation.  Steve felt it like butterfly kisses.
Stark did not return until Gwen’s hair was completely styled, and when she did she had obviously gotten dressed for the evening in the meantime.  She was now in a tux—still, despite the years and changes to fashion, a masculine choice, although surely more acceptable now than it would have been in Gwen’s time.  It  was another long-and-lean type of suit, but this time in black; Stark wore it without a tie, and her collar sat confidently over the lapels.  It was beautifully fitted.
It could wait until they got to their camp. If it turned out that Steve was not who Tony thought he was (his heart said that was a ridiculous notion but his brain insisted that he be careful because he’d been betrayed too many times), it would be better if Tony had both his suit and Jarvis close at hand.
Steve groaned and shook his head against the blanket.  His cock was throbbing with every word Tony spoke, and he was fucking himself so hard with his fingers he was about to come on them, so of course Tony picked this moment to say, “Pull your fingers out and hold your cheeks apart for me; I want to watch you twitch.”
Tony closed his eyes and felt what seemed like someone tapping him on the shoulder for a brief moment before the sensation disappeared. The words sounded familiar, but he’d never heard them before.
Tony must have made a sound or something because Steve woke up with a small start, eyes flying open and his entire body jerking to an upright position like he was going to attack someone. It was a few seconds before the tension seeped out of Steve’s frame and he relaxed, evidently realizing that there was no one here save for Tony and him.
“Sit up,” Tony ordered.  “Edge of the bed.  I want to see your dick peeking out from under the end of that
Christ, she would. Pepper wouldn’t be at all happy with how things were progressing, for both personal and professional reasons. Readers apparently liked mystical things only to a point, and this was pushing things.
One of these days, Gwen thought as she raised her arm for the zip, she was really going to have to learn how to back down from a challenge.
They secured the rope to a convenient rock, and this time Rhodey – flashlight in mouth – was the one to go first, giving Tony a look that dared him to protest. He didn’t. He valued his hearing.
blush this time, ducking her gaze away as a sunlit smile bloomed over her face.  It made her look softer, kinder.  Like a walled garden when the sun comes in.  “Okay,” Tasha said softly.  She took Gwen’s hand, squeezing their fingers together.  “Okay.”
Gwen thrashed against her bonds for emphasis.  “I know you run the Iron Man armor!  I have no idea how you do that without being inside it—is it a robot? An accomplice?—but there is
He was halfway through sucking it off his fingers before he remembered to look at Tony.  Tony’s head was tipped to the side, the hand not on his dick stroking steadily behind his balls.  Steve didn’t quite have a good enough angle to see what he was doing, but he could guess.
Tony’s supplies were still strewn about at ground level and appeared unmolested by anyone, goat or person. He gathered them, ignoring the curious look from Steve, and then started setting up camp for that night.
“All right.” Rhodey bumped his fist against Tony’s shoulder. “Whatever happens, I have your back. And so do Jarvis and Pepper.”
“Here,” she said.  Her mouth was glistening, too, wet with Gwen’s juices, puffy with friction and movement.  Gwen wanted to suck the wetness off of her, but before she could move, Tasha was holding slick fingers up to her face, and Gwen sucked the juices off of them, instead.  Tasha tasted different than Gwen herself did, Gwen noticed—tangier, more sour and less salty.  Gwen moaned and licked the two fingers clean, even forcing her tongue between them to catch the last drops of Tasha’s flavor off them.
thank you!”  Tony must have shoved to his feet, because that was definitely the sound of a chair hitting the wall and falling over.
turn now, that she wanted to get her mouth on that delicious cunt of hers, and she moved her hand to reach for Tasha—
“Catch that,” Tony ordered sharply, and Steve did, dropping his left hand down to intercept the stream even as the right kept stroking.  Long strokes now, nursing the orgasm.  It seemed to go on forever.
Tony's mouth dropped open half an inch, and his tongue snaked out to touch his bottom lip.  His eyes were on fire.  "Watch," he said.  The word came out of him like a snake's hiss.
“Of course I don’t, but—urrrrgh!”  Tony’s voice went low and breathy on the last word—well, last noise, anyway—as Steve sucked the next finger into his mouth.  “Do—shit.
The light swept over ice and snow that covered the rocky ground and hugged the walls in patches. It was sparse to the edges of the cavernous room, but piled up more vigorously towards the center.
clean, but he still kind of didn’t want to just set it on the covers.  Instead, he just held it in his hand as he waited for Tony to continue.
“Oh, believe me, I know,” Tony said, and he did: Steve could hear it in his voice, in the warmth, in the
a scattered brain.  Never focused, but so brilliant that it never mattered.”  She paused, remembering.  “I wasn’t an area of any particular interest, not beyond what he had for any of the rest of his projects.”
was immature, that was nothing compared to this!— he caught a flicker of guilt from his soulmate.  He realized that the guilt was a response to his anger and pushed an apology over the bond.
Tony preferred being optimistic, but even he was slowly running out of optimism with every dead end he ran into.
His heart pounded behind the repulsor pump, and Tony spared a brief thought for the remaining charge. It would be fine. He still had a few days left and that was without using the suit. Which he wouldn’t be doing right now because it was packed in a crate.
Gwen turned her head, staring into Stark’s eyes from mere inches away.  “SHIELD continues to think I want to be the only person in the world still living like it’s 1945—and I don’t understand
“Normally that’d be true, but in this case I’m going to call foul,” Rhodey said. “You’re stuck relying on what we brought to keep your heart going. There’s nothing out here for you to jury rig if something goes wrong.”
“I trust you,” Steve told him, the hand on the crate flexing slightly. “I trust you with my life. I have no reason to – not really – but something in me just…”
The little mirror-sided tissue box he had set on the nightstand was on the same side as Tony, and if he turned his head, he would be looking away from it.  He took one last, lingering look at Tony
He took the lead, Rhodey falling in behind him. Keeping to the path made walking easier than if they’d gone elsewhere, since at least human feet had gone this way before. Even if it was rocky, occasionally slippery, and almost twisted their ankles at certain points.
“You said you were fighting HYDRA,” Tony said, “but you don’t remember how you got in that cave or what happened. But do you remember
Tony got himself out of his pants, not quite hard yet but thickening steadily.  He straightened his cock out enough so that it wouldn't catch on any of his clothes when it firmed the rest of the way and then rested his hands on his thighs.  His eyes were hot on Steve, and if felt odd—felt different, but good-different, to be watched in this way.  The back of Steve's neck prickled, and his breath came faster over his lips.
The ice around the shield melted before Tony managed to finish choking down his food, and he quickly wrapped up what remained and stuffed it into his right pocket. He was too eager to check the shield out now that it was no longer a block of ice.
“You’d be fucking yourself.  On the vibrator.”  Tony wrapped an arm around Steve’s neck, pressing them close as he sank down, taking Steve inside of him.  He had opened himself well, but Steve still almost sobbed at the tight, wet heat of him.  Tony sucked a kiss onto Steve’s neck, hard and bruising, and then pulled back to look Steve dead in the eye.
had a Van Dyke a few years ago, but it’d gotten a bit impractical to keep doing it so he’d downsized to a simple mustache during the war years.
Tony let the backpack drop once he was close enough and pulled out some rope and their camping supplies. The latter he started stashing behind some rocks.
Gwen opened her eyes—when had she closed them?—and looked up through her lashes as much as she could, considering the height difference.  Tasha sighed again, her face softening.
The man blinked, frowning slightly. “I’m…” He looked down at the hand still on Tony’s face, flushed slightly, and pulled back (Tony mourning the loss instantly and then chiding himself because
She thought Stark wouldn’t be able to hear it, or wouldn’t pick up on it, but in fact Stark froze, a deviant grin spreading over her face.  “Do you?” she asked.  “And here I thought you like things round.  Given the shield, and all.”
It wasn’t that Tony thought he knew Steve, because he knew that he really, really didn’t. There was no way he could forget a face like Steve’s (even if that sounded incredibly shallow). But beyond the fact that he didn’t remember ever meeting Steve physically…there was no denying that something about him felt familiar, like meeting an old friend.
But it didn’t branch off, which meant they wouldn’t get lost or have to use the chalk they had in their pockets for exactly these kinds of situations.
At Tony’s answer, Steve dropped his chin, eyes closing. His mouth twisted in a clear picture of grief. A few seconds later his (perfect,
And yet…while Tony couldn’t tell Rhodey what Steve’s favorite food was, how his face looked like when he laughed or ate something disgusting, what kind of books he liked to read, or what his hopes and dreams were, he couldn’t help but think that he already knew everything most important. Like that Steve was good down to his core, that he wouldn’t ever waver from his convictions (that thought sent a cold shiver down his spine for some reason), and that he absolutely
at the touch, bucking hard, but Tasha had her shoulders pinned well, and Gwen’s self-restraint, practiced so often that it was automatic, kept her from throwing her off, thank goodness.  Tasha’s mouth was like heaven and hell on her breast, licking and nipping roughly, a feeling so good it was agony, too intense but
It was even harder to let go of his grip than it had been to grab it in the first place, but Steve did it.  He groaned, pulling his hand away, and then raising two tremulous fingers to swipe through the precome now dripping off of him.  Some of it had smeared against the negligee, he noticed.  He would have to hand-wash it; he couldn’t imagine sending it through the laundry service.  “Now what?”
“I thought it might be a nice way to start.  Playing with it, I mean.”  Steve wasn’t sure about this.  He hoped it was something Tony was okay with;
“I think it’s science,” Tony continued absentmindedly, remembering how Steve had lifted crates that Rhodey and Jarvis needed to help each other with. “He doesn’t
“Shit,” Tony said, finally leaning across the bed for a pump of the lube.  His shoulders were loose, his head dragging to the side in relaxation.  “Yes, God.  Change video—”
It was a lot less colder than it had been moments before. Less solid, too. It was leaking water constantly now.
Tony sat like a cat, exactly in the center of their enormously plush bed, his legs tucked around him in a half-circle.  His back wasn’t exactly turned to Steve, but he was at an angle, a bit less than half his face showing towards Steve; there was little chance that he had seen Steve lurking in the shadows.
“I’d lick over your hole before I went in it.  Wide swipes of my tongue, over and over again.  It might catch on the rim, once in a while, but mostly it would just make you feel puffy, sensitive.  You’d probably come at least once.”
She pushed Tasha to her feet mainly with force of strength, putting Tasha’s back to the wall and holding her there with a hand against Tasha’s strong, flat stomach.  With her other hand, she went for the pants—Tasha’s pants had a snap and a zipper instead of buttons,
“Are we leaving?” Steve picked up the shield, not even looking at it as he set into place on his back. “Or was there another reason you’re here?”
indulged a kink—a somewhat shameful kink—while you were safely out of the country and couldn’t see it,” he said.
“Maybe your team’s fine,” Tony said, squeezing Steve’s arm gently now that he was once more aware of the physical contact. “We can keep looking.”
Steve had groaned and started to bring his legs back together.  He was squeezing around the plug, again, too conscious of it holding him open not to.
“Oh, is that good?” Gwen asked.  A grin spread over her face as she deliberately took Tasha’s earlobe between her teeth, biting oh-so-delicately.
As Steve watched, Tony stiffened slightly, having come to the part of the whatever-he-was-watching that he was really paying attention to.  His gaze sharpened like a wild thing’s, his head tipping forward by inches.  The hand at his knee stilled, then began rubbing and flattening over the kneecap, instead.
“From where I’m standing, you’re the one who should be gone.” Steve hefted the shield up. “You know exactly who I am.”
Gwen groaned, closing her eyes.  It hurt to move, and she let herself sag, falling against the floor as if unconscious because it was marginally less painful to lie that way.
He hesitated, chickening out one more time.  Tony raised his eyebrows as he moved towards the seat, and that was what did it:  Tony was still here, Tony was not bothered—it seemed like maybe he was the opposite of bothered—and he was
Steve sucked on the third finger once more and let it go again.  “Exactly the same place I plan to put my mouth, in a minute.  You like to watch, huh?”
"You should take this off."  Tony's voice was low, husky with want, and Steve shuddered at the sound of it.  Obediently, he started pulling at the tabs of his jacket, stripping off the blue kevlar to reveal the plain white t-shirt he wore beneath.  Tony trailed his lips over Steve's cheek, oh-so-gently brushing over the cheekbone and dotting small kisses as he moved towards the jaw, then towards the ear—
“I won’t let them,” Steve stated firmly, unhesitatingly, his face resolute. “They’ll have to go through me for that, and I’m not easy to take out.”
“Still looking,” Tony said. “I found you this time, but it means I need to keep rooting out old myths and legends. At this point most of my major leads have dried out.” It was why he’d been out here to begin with, chasing a ridiculous tale with only a single mad source as its originator.
Zemo raised the gun, and this time Tony could hear something like high-pitched humming. He was going to shoot Steve again, who was still looking rather dazed and twitchy from whatever that energy bolt had been.
If Tony’s eyes didn’t deceive him, it seemed like Steve’s cheeks were slightly flushed as he pressed back against Tony’s foot.
Steve took the issue, studying the front page for a few moments before meeting Tony’s eyes again. “I thought it was red and gold?”
Blinking, Tony realized that the shield Steve had thrown had somehow made its way back and was bouncing around the clearing, happily knocking into every single minion that was stupidly standing in their spots.
Judging from the current rate, it would probably be another ten minutes before they were able to take care of whomever was in the ice.
as the orgasm exploded through her, trying to get Tasha as close to her as humanly possible to coax her through it, and Tasha obliged, stroking over her clit with her tongue even as her mouth kept a steady pressure on it as Gwen pulsed, and pulsed, and pulsed, hanging from the doorway in the delicious weightlessness of pleasure.
Tasha laughed, low and sultry, leaning in again to reclaim Gwen’s mouth.  She kissed like a foregone conclusion, powerful and sweeping, then pulling back and nibbling, tasting,
“An amalgam.  Parts of him are a robot, and then the driver—JARVIS runs him sometimes, other times it's me.”
“Why would I want you?” Zemo sounded like he was considering Steve an idiot. It was a tone Tony was intimately familiar with, as Howard had loved to use it on people he thought too stupid to breathe (or make important decisions. It would be easier to hate Zemo if he didn’t have so many of Tony’s father’s mannerisms). “You have muscles, but anyone can hire a set of those.” He waved a hand towards the minions surrounding them. Some did look rather like they could give Steve a run for his money in the muscles department. One even cracked his knuckles threateningly.
Steve groaned as he turned his head to the side.  Before his cock had even finished falling, it was filling again.
Steve’s hips jerked in the air.  The last thought he had was to snake his left hand down between his stomach and the bed, cupping it just far enough under his dick that Tony could see that he wasn’t touching it, and then he was coming, his cock swaying with the movements of his hips as he thrust and thrust into nothing.
“It’s over,” Tony said. “Germany surrendered last year, and the Japanese not long after.” He didn’t touch on what happened with the atomic bombs. Steve didn’t need to hear about that just yet.
“I keep my promises,” Steve said, returning Tony’s kiss. And then, “You give me a home.” The words seemed like they were spoken absentmindedly, in-between kisses, but that didn’t make the weight they carried any less.
That was a shame; Steve knew what was on the rest of the first video, and it was one of his personal favorite recordings in the world.  But it made sense, in a way, that Tony would prefer not to watch his own solo acts.
Tony’s voice was rough, and his hand was tight around his cock, his thumb the only part of it moving, just barely, over the frenulum.
Her feet were pinned similarly to her hands, spread wide enough that she would have a difficult time getting leverage to break any bonds, and with just enough support under her that she could stand for some time, but not quite enough support that she could brace.  If she tried to put pressure on the frame with her arms, she realized, it would break and drop her, so that all her weight was on her ankles, instead; best not to do that, then.  The frame itself locked around her abdomen, a two-inch metal loop, and her neck, through some mechanism she couldn’t see, was restrained as well, so that she couldn’t snap her head forward, or even very far to the side.
Steve hadn’t seemed too surprised at any of the technology or supplies they had, so it wasn’t likely that he’d been frozen that long (he couldn’t have been frozen that long anyway because he’d been there for this war so why did he keep thinking
Tony’s heart skipped a beat, and he bit his lip, chiding himself for looking at the poor man that way.
“If you think I’m going to hide in here while you’re out there, you need to reassess your plan,” Tony interrupted, shooting him a sharp glare. “I might not be able to get into the suit, but that doesn’t mean I’m helpless.”
Yeah, he didn’t have the best track record with lovers. At this point Tony had given up and was just trying to make it to the next year before his heart gave out. He’d try and find someone after that if there was any chance.
“Oh, I do.” Zemo wasn’t looking at him, his strange gun still aimed at Steve. “But you’re all I need. Everyone else…is just spare parts.”
“You want me, you got me,” Steve said, which didn’t even make any sense. Zemo wanted Tony (unless something had changed since Tony had seen Zemo last). “You don’t need to bring them into this. Let them go.”
It didn’t take as long to get out as it had to get in. Steve was in remarkably good shape considering he’d been frozen in an ice block for an undetermined amount of time (
Her hair was neatly trimmed with only a single strip leading down towards dark, almost mauve-colored folds, and Gwen gasped at the sight of it.  She hadn’t known until this second that people did that—trimming their nether hair—but she found herself liking it a lot more than she probably should.  There was something perverse about it, something premeditatedly carnal.
That brought Tasha back to her side, jokingly (not jokingly) scolding her about running around on their first date.  “Well, given how
Once, twice, three times... and then Tony was reaching up, opening the slit in the front of them and pulling his hardening cock through.
“I definitely still am.  Okay, vibrator!  We don’t have one of those handy, but— grab that pretty blue plug of yours and stick it back in for me.”
,” Tony protested, though it was more because of the principle of the matter than because he disagreed.
Steve also insisted on taking some of their supplies, seeming not to notice the additional weight and hiking like it was a walk through the park.
Gwen let her throat open, cries spilling out of her like wine from a too-full cup.  It was good, it was
“There’s a person here,” Tony blurted out, reaching out despite himself to touch the ice covering the legs. Cold water seeped through his gloves, and he pulled them off before he could rethink the notion, stuffing them into his pockets before touching the ice again.
“James Buchanan Barnes,” Steve interrupted resolutely. “I called him Bucky. He was…he was a kid. He wasn’t even eighteen when he joined. But he wanted to help and I…I couldn’t tell him no considering what he knew.”
“I…” Steve took a moment, but then his shoulders squared and the shield went back up to its former position. “It doesn’t matter,” he said, determination in every syllable. “You can’t have Tony.”
“Pull the plug out again and then fuck yourself with it,” Tony told him, “because that’s what I would want to do to you.  With the vibrator.”
Reaching out, Tony tapped his own fingers against it, deliberately drumming his nails on it. The sound rang oddly, almost like a clear ring, like no other metal Tony was familiar with.
Tony slowly maneuvered to a more comfortable position on the ledge, making sure he wasn’t going to fall over in either direction. Then he looked back down to Rhodey, waving at him to come up.
FRIDAY warned him when Tony approached for landing.  Steve thought for one second about cancelling—he still had time; FRIDAY would absolutely be willing to stall Tony for his sake, and he could be out of the nightie and all unplugged in under a minute.  Tony would notice him being all slicked, but Steve didn't think it would elicit too much comment.  Maybe even some good things.
“That didn’t seem much like ‘watching.’ Unless I’m missing something and you can watch someone while you’re sleeping?”
His voice sounded like he had been deepthroating Tony instead of just coming his own brains out, raspy as hell.
Tony sucked the head into his mouth, wrapping his hand around the base, and that was all it took.  The world went white, and Steve came into Tony's mouth, come splashing out around the corners of his lips, dripping into the dark, close crop of his beard.
Steve’s smile was achingly beautiful (and how was it Tony hadn’t seen him smile before? He needed to make Steve smile more often). “How does forever sound?”
Tony decided not to tell Steve that he had no idea who this Red Skull person was and that it sounded like a terrible title since skulls weren’t red.
Within seconds, it had crossed the once-crowded room, coming to a stop in front of her.  Tasha cowered behind her, putting Gwen’s greater height and mass between her and the Iron Man.  Futilely, Gwen raised a tray snagged from the hand of a fleeing waiter, but it did no good: Tasha dove out of the way as the Iron Man fired again, much harder this time.  The tray was ripped out of her hands like cardboard and Gwen heard a ringing sound as her head smacked, hard, against the floor.  Her body spasmed as she was buffeted by a second stunning blow from the Iron Man, this one hitting while she was down, deflected by nothing.  Stars danced in front of her eyes, and a single, high-pitched note sang in her ears.
Stark ground against him again and caught at his hands, moving them until Steve had both of their cocks captured in his grasp.
Steve exhaled, one hand fisted loosely on the shield and the other holding onto a crate. “I just woke up, you were the first face I saw, and the first thing I thought was
Tony’s hand was moving, now, quick short strokes near his tip, and his eyes were hot on Steve.  Steve reached down and palmed his own cock, handling it gently because of the hardware.  He flicked his eyes up to Tony as he touched himself.  The head of his cock was dark and purple, clear fluid leaking out around the plug, making him slick and so,
Since he was hearing his heart slowly and rhythmically beat away in his chest, someone had clearly managed to get Tony’s repulsor pump charged in time before he bit it. The last thing Tony remembered was Rhodey’s and Steve’s faces, so it wasn’t going to be HYDRA saving his ass because they wanted him to be Zemo.
They both fell silent, enjoying the moment.  Steve even dropped into a doze.  The room was warm, and Tony was an awfully wonderful weight on top of him...  Nothing wrong with dropping off to sleep, just for a moment...
Tony watched him, thumbing his mustache (definitely not an evil villain mustache!) thoughtfully. Well…if there was any time to try go back to his old style…now was probably the best time to do so (no one could yell at him for not adhering to military rules, even if he’d never technically
The day she met Tasha Stark, there was nothing different from the usual pattern to raise her suspicions: notice that she had a meeting came a tad later than usual, but, as the breathless aide assured her on the way down the hallway, “Miss Stark is a very busy woman; we don't ever get much notice of meetings with her, no one does.”
The HYDRA minion dodged it and lunged forwards. Tony took the opportunity to dive to the side and shoot one of the others in the leg. There was a pained cry and the one he’d aimed at dropped to the ground.
Tasha’s clit was a hard, round nub, smaller than Gwen’s—Gwen’s clit was, like the rest of her, unusually large—and very pink.  Gwen used the flat of her tongue on it, impetuous and firm, and Tasha yelled and pulled her hair appreciatively, harder and harder as Gwen worked her faster.
Once again, Tony found himself thrown for a loop. “Red and gold? That sounds rather ostentatious, doesn’t it?” It wouldn’t blend in well at all (not that were was much camouflaging one could do with a giant suit of armor; still, Tony
“It doesn’t look bad,” Steve said slowly. He said it with the tone of one who was trying to pacify someone who was wrong. “I mean,” he added, “you look good. You always do.” It took an instant before he seemed to realize what he’d said and proceeded to flush pink, ducking his head and returning to packing with a vengeance.
“Steve!” The cry escaped Tony before he realized he was saying it, panic rising in his chest and choking his throat. His heart pounded behind the repulsor pump, and Tony glanced to where the blast had come from, seeing Zemo stand up with a metallic and strange gun in his hands.
“I wish.” Tony gave a short laugh, spreading his hands. Rhodey was rummaging around in one of his smaller bags. “It’d be nice if it was, and I have ideas for that, but sadly I can’t manage it with technology as it is.” He gestured towards the crates. “It’s a pain in the ass to take it anywhere, and it takes several minutes to put on. Maybe two if we push it.”
But there wasn’t time to be snide; the mechanical menace spotted her and Tasha, its eyes flashing in satisfaction.  It brought its arms up and fired on the crowd, throwing people across the floor and out of its way—although, rather more gently than Gwen would have expected a “known terrorist suspect” to do.
Tony lunged at Zemo before he could aim again, grabbing his right arm and trying to knock the gun out of his grip and to the ground. If it was on the ground, then at least Zemo didn’t have it in hand.
Tasha breathed.  She braced one spiky heel against the wall and pushed, shoving hard to spin the two of them around, clinging to Gwen’s hips with her knees as they both went down to the floor.
“You should talk.”  Gwen made her voice flirty and intimate as the insubstantial underwear she had been given, but the real snark in her tone was not lost on Tasha, who huffed as Gwen deliberately chugged the champagne.  (A horrible thing to do to good champagne, but worth it for the look on Tasha’s face.  And this was not
The man’s breath hitched, his eyes narrowing slightly as he squinted at Tony. Then he blinked, reaching out with a trembling hand to touch Tony’s face. His fingers weren’t as cold as before, but they still made Tony shiver.
Steve said the title like it meant something, but Tony had never heard of a Captain America before. Even Rhodey and Jarvis looked uncomprehending, so clearly it wasn’t a moment of Tony missing out on a pop culture reference because he’d spent too long in the middle of nowhere again.
“I won’t hurt you,” Steve said entirely seriously, running a gentle hand through Tony’s hair, scratching lightly at Tony’s scalp.
Tony grinned ruefully. “I can’t say it’s my favorite thing, but it’s part of the job. I’m glad to get back to it now.”
“You’ll be thrown off the frame when it seals,” Tasha called around it.  “I suggest you make yourself comfortable; you’re going to be in there for a long, long time.”
“I feel like I’ll see a ghost waving at me if I look over my shoulder,” Rhodey said as they walked through the village and back to their campsite.
The blush that covered Tony’s cheeks was thankfully hidden in the dark and easily missed in the campfire’s light.
Steve’s breath hitched, his eyes closed, and he drifted forward to press his forehead to Tony’s. “I don’t want to be lost again,” he whispered.
They met in the middle, unhesitating and sweet.  It never failed to surprise Steve the way his toes would still curl when Tony kissed him, the way his stomach clenched excitedly every time, no matter how hot the minutes that came before the kiss had been.  This kiss was warm and inviting, a question and an answer, all at once.  Tony’s free hand smoothed down Steve’s back, pressing them closer, and Steve hummed happily into the kiss, sucking on Tony’s exploring tongue, edging just that little more into him and pressing their bodies together.
They both went still, afterwards, Gwen because every muscle in her body had simultaneously gone on holiday, and Tasha because...  Gwen wasn’t sure why, actually.  In just a minute, Gwen was going to muster the strength to look at her instead of blinking stupidly at the ceiling.  In just... a minute...
Tony was smirking.  He probably didn’t even know he was doing it.  “How would you feel about smearing that on your face?” he asked, and Steve didn’t even hesitate.  He raised the handful and started on his right cheek, dragging his hand sideways and down, over his lips, and the back up and around til it was right beside his left eye.
Tony let out a slow breath, evaluating the current state of his bruised chest and that everything seemed to be in working order. He was no longer gasping for air, which was a plus.
“It’s up there,” Tony said, securing the rope to his belt. “I’m going to check that it’s clear and then you can come up with a light.” The much lighter backpack went back on. He didn’t wait for an answer before he started climbing.
And then she broke out of her chains.  Broke all of them, her wrists, her ankles, her throat, peeling herself away from the imprisoning frame limb by limb, her muscles bulging as she exerted her true strength for the first time this century. Tortured metal shrieked as she tore it apart, thudding to the ground in pieces as Gwen stepped down and away from it.
The world was going fuzzy on the edges.  Steve dug his fingers into a little more, but the dual pressures on his throat and his cock were too much.  Pressure built up in his balls, lines of tension in his legs and gut.  He
“I know the risks, Rhodey,” Tony said quietly, seriously. “There’s been no one else out here but us. It might not even be what you’re thinking.”
He slept fitfully, though, waking twice more during the night.  The first time he merely rubbed the nightmare from his eyes and looked around, remembering where he was and how he had come to be there.  Tony was warm and soft beside him, so Steve gratefully put his arm around his lover and snuggled back down into the blankets.
The second time, he actually woke up for real, sitting up in bed and glancing around the room for a clock.  There wasn't a display; Steve had never figured out why not, but he knew Tony had some reason for disliking digital clocks beyond their uni-purpose designs, some wreckage caused by the high emotional waters of Tony's past.  Steve had chosen not to push at it, instead asking FRIDAY to monitor for a series of taps he could make against the headboard.  Long, short short, long long, short, and FRIDAY would illuminate the display panel Tony had built into the wall.  It was an easy enough workaround.
Tony was a body in motion, always.  Even now, expressions danced across his face, and one of Tony’s hands was tap, tap, tapping against his knee.
Or, well, video of him.  Steve recognized it, even; that was the video from their first time, that time in the lab, with the—and all the—
“He’s alive,” Tony said, switching from the man’s neck to his mouth to see if he could feel him breathing. “Holy shit, he’s alive.”
Tony shook his head. “At this point, who hasn’t seen me? I don’t remember meeting him, and I’d remember a face like that.”
Tony couldn’t see Steve’s face, but he had the solid impression that Steve was becoming uncertain (why was that thought vaguely terrifying?).
Tony paused, considering that. His chest warmed at the thought (and it definitely wasn’t the plate protecting his heart). “Okay, well… Putting that aside, I don’t know what’s going on, but I trust him. I know he wouldn’t hurt me. Once we get back, we’ll find out what happened to him. Undercover ops or no, there have to be records, and I bet Fury knows something.”
“Better a rock than you.” Rhodey leaned down, picked up a decent sized rock, and lobbed it into the room before Tony could protest.
“Round is good, too,” Gwen agreed with smile.  “I should probably mention here that I like things which are hard, too—as well as soft.  While we’re talking preferences.”
“Oh—got it—and fuck, yes, I can.  Now touch yourself—your dick.  I want to see you tease yourself around that ring.”  The stopper was attached to a slim metal ring that fit right under the head of the glans.
Steve was wrestling with his opponent, and it seemed for an instant that it could go either way considering his opponent had muscles the size of Tony’s head. But then Steve wiggled and suddenly the minion’s head went slamming into the side of the truck.
. How he wasn’t dead was a medical and scientific mystery that Tony would like answers to but suspected he wouldn’t get unless he was the evil cackling kind of scientist.
Steve took his right hand off his ass, too, then, pulling the ring off and sucking it clean before throwing it away.  Then he put his hand back where it had been, holding himself open, and only when that was done did he pull his left hand out, still carrying its load.  He raised it up and dumped it on his ass, smearing it across both cheeks and the hole, rubbing it in before going back to holding his position as if nothing had happened.  “You were saying?”
The man was strikingly handsome, jawline straight, nose unbroken, skin flawless, and eyelashes long.
Absolutely nothing happened beyond the rock hitting the ground with a loud thud and skittering to a stop in the snow. They waited another five minutes, scarcely daring to breathe as they listened for anything that might be a trap going off. When all remained quiet, Tony relaxed and felt Rhodey do the same, his friend’s grip on his arm slackening.
Rhodey and Jarvis were standing behind Zemo, hands up in the air as several guns were pointed at them. Neither looked injured, although Jarvis looked pissed as hell. Rhodey was glaring daggers at Zemo’s back.
in a hard, driving rhythm that was sending Gwen mad.  The noises Gwen was making were totally wordless, now, totally mindless.  She wanted to squeeze her legs together, press herself closer, but it would be rude and probably uncomfortable for Tasha, so she couldn’t.  Instead, she pressed her legs outward, carefully not putting too much pressure on the door because she had learned the hard way not to break structural elements of rooms she was in.  But that self-restraint felt good,
It should worry Tony that he trusted Steve this much after meeting him only a few days ago, but it didn’t.
There was a smile on Gwen’s face, smug and jubilant.  Tasha met her eyes and then ducked her gaze away.  If Gwen didn’t know better, she would think Tasha was blushing.
The foothills were a different matter, as they hadn’t had any luck finding a local to guide them. The language barrier surprisingly wasn’t the issue there. It was that no one seemed to want to go with them.
On screen, Steve’s head pressed deeply into the chair back as Tony slowly eased the sound into his urethra.  Steve pressed himself back further into the wall and bit back a groan, watching Tony through eyes that wanted to fall shut.  Tony was jerking himself, working his left hand smooth as a train piston in a way that Steve now knew was building towards a climax.  He pulled his boxers down enough that they cupped the curves of his ass before sinking the first two fingers of his right hand in again, deep, twisting at the wrist to get the best angle.
The next morning was colder than it had been by the village, and they covered their tracks before setting off. They’d been followed too many times by enemies to take the chance that someone might be following them again and would run across their campsite.
“I’m fine,” Tony said. But at a look from Steve he relented and settled back down. He refused to relinquish his grip on Steve’s arm, though. Some things had to be done. “As I was saying,” he continued, “we don’t know that you can’t go home.” Even if he rather thought it was likely Steve was stuck here (fifty years or maybe even a few decades from now it might be a different story but Tony didn’t have the technology here to determine what the hell had happened).
Steve smiled again, more nervously this time.  "I thought you might like it.  You direct the show—I'll do whatever you want—and you just... watch."
Tony swallowed, pressing his weight against the crate next to him as the truck drove over a particularly rough patch.
Gwen growled and set her feet, pushing the two of them forward—or rather, forward from her own perspective; Tasha was stepping backwards, an impressive feat in those shoes, until Gwen put Tasha’s back against the wall next to the open door.  She put one hand in Tasha’s hair, pulling firmly, dropped the other hand to Tasha’s breast, flicking her thumb over the nipple.
“I’d use a support, set up the vibe so that it stays upright for you, let you ride it.”  Tony’s voice was rough and happy, his breath going out on him.  Soft sounds of wet motion provided counterpoint to every gasping breath.  Steve tugged a little harder on his ass, trying to show the camera, and Tony, a good angle on the plug fucking him open.  He got a groan and an oath and grinned into the blanket.
There was no way he should be warming up this fast, because his breath was definitely fogging the shield.
Tony didn’t bother responding, stepping into the room with an eagerness that would probably make Rhodey regret letting Tony go first. He didn’t think this was a solution to his heart issues, but that didn’t matter.
“So I’ve gathered.” Steve leaned forward, his own hand covering Tony’s where it was touching the repulsor plate. “Why didn’t you tell me?”
Gwen swallowed back her first response and clenched her hands into fists, hidden within the voluminous folds of her skirt.  At least the damned thing was good for
Steve smiled.  He held up the soiled underpants and then, deliberately, sealed them into one of the pouches at his belt.
Life wasn’t ready to let him go just yet. Which was great, since Tony wasn’t ready to let it go either. Not now.
It still wasn’t enough, though.  He switched to his middle finger—longer than his index, and a slightly better angle; he was able to bend it inside of himself—and then, relubing once again, up to two.
“Finding you wasn’t a mistake,” Tony said fiercely, his grip on Steve tightening. “Don’t you dare think it was. It might not have been what I expected – definitely wasn’t if I’m honest – but it was so much more than I ever could have imagined. And I don’t regret a thing.”
“Grab your hair again.”  Tony said it like it was a way to buy himself time, but Steve did it anyway, again with his left hand as his right scratched its way from his throat down to his nipple.  He rubbed at the nip through the lace—Tony had taught him that one—and pinched just enough that it hurt.  “Good god, you’re going to kill me.
Tony’s heart was still at full charge. Unless something terribly drastic happened, he should be good for the next week. He wasn’t planning on being out here for a week.
“Heels,” Gwen said, nodding to the place in the mirror where Tasha’s pointy, red-bottomed shoes reflected.  Then she looked a question at Cole, instead, and a second later accepted the offered cigarette with a grateful smile.  She tucked it into her mouth and then spoke around it, “I never could get the hang of those, not when I was—smaller—and not now.”  Not to mention, the heels had never been quite so...
“That’ll go over wonderfully with our readers,” Tony said dryly. “‘There was something creepy in the village, so our intrepid adventurers decided to hoof it. The End.’”
Steve tried to muster some brain cells to answer.  “Both,” he said after considering the question.  “It’s—watching you, watching how you’re reacting to seeing me, that’s... that’s a thing, for sure.  But if I
Did she think Gwen was unconscious?  Seriously?  Gwen could get up.  She could.  Would, in just a moment, really—
Tony groaned, holding his come-smeared hand in the air between them.  “You couldn’t have gotten here two minutes earlier?”
As Gwen turned, Miss Stark reacted with subtle, but real, appreciation: her eyes dipped, tracing up Gwen’s bare, shaved, and seamed legs, over the curves of her hips, and waist, and higher, before meeting Gwen's eye.  Gwen sucked in a gasp at her expression; it wasn't the hunger that shocked her so much—folks had been eyeing Gwen up like a juicy steak since Rebirth, that was nothing new—but the
Not begging, but close enough, Steve decided.  It was hard to think. His mind’s eye was crimson with the wanting.  Desire and ecstasy pulsed back and forth between the two of them, too fast to know who was starting it, who was sending what...  Steve changed grip again and sped up, bringing them off together, catching both of their come in his spread fingers, mixing it together until you couldn’t tell whose was whose.
But soon it didn’t matter, anyway: the armor opened like a mussel shell and Tasha stepped into it.  It rocketed out the hole in the side of the building and up into the sky, Gwen still clasped in its arms.  Somewhere between twenty and thirty thousand feet above the ground, the armor changed course, and between the cold and the gravity and the lack of oxygen, Gwen’s head swam right away.
Tony deliberately kept his face turned away, unable to help the twitching of his lips. He moved forward, keeping his flashlight facing forward and scanning the ground for any traps that might be set off. He didn’t expect any, but he hadn’t gotten to this point in his career by ignoring everything he’d learned.
Steve seemed slightly disappointed at first, but his expression soon gave way to vague confusion as his eyes flickered between Tony and to where the suit was packed up.
Finding a Tony who was awake and, apparently, masturbating?  That was a surprise.  A very pleasant surprise, though...
Later that evening, once everything was packed save for what they still needed to camp for the night, Tony found Steve perched on a large boulder and staring at the Himalayas. The mountain range was shrouded in darkness but for the snow-capped peaks glistening in the starlight and the crescent moon.
Once it was ascertained that there were indeed no traps waiting to ensnare them, Tony followed. The cave didn’t look any less forbidding once they were inside, the only lights that of Rhodey’s flashlight and what little came in from outside.
Steve fumbled the damn thing when he went to pick it up, then caught it before it hit the bed and turned it around again.  It occurred to him that he could use two hands for it, but by then he was pressing it one-handed to his hole and shoving forward, his other hand still holding himself spread, at least halfway, so that Tony could get a good view.
He saw the exact moment Tony realized he was wearing the buttplug, because Tony went absolutely still, his eyes greedy and fixed on the slim blue handle.  He licked his lips and then clenched his jaw so hard Steve could watch a muscle in his neck twitching.  Then he opened his mouth again, but didn’t say anything.  His jaw worked.  His penis, still lying outside of his opened flies, started to thicken.
“But now...”  Tasha took a step closer to her; close enough to touch.  “Now, you’ve seen my face, which means that now, I can’t let you go.”
Stark moved in closer, crushing their mouths together, kissing him like an act of war.  He cupped his hands around Steve’s ass and ground him forward so that their erections pressed together, separated only by a thin layer of fabric.
The knee fallen between Gwen’s legs jerked upward, seating itself against Gwen’s flimsy underwear.  Tasha reached inside Gwen’s clothes and pulled her breasts out of both bra and dress, although the neckline still pushed them together, then raised her hands to Gwen’s shoulders and pushed, holding her down, just as she dropped her mouth to Gwen’s nipple and
Steve stiffened, trying to control his breathing which hastened at the sight of Tony’s long, clever fingers wrapping around himself.
There’d been a few of those. Tony always regretted having to be the one to find them and then make that decision.
As Steve was still shivering and seemed to stare vacantly into the distance, Tony immediately shoved him into the tent once it was set up. He also gave Steve the warmest blanket they had and some dried nuts and fruits. He didn’t want to give Steve anything heavier since he had no idea how long he’d been frozen for (and those terrible rations were definitely on the heavy side; at least fruits and nuts were more palatable).
When they reached the meeting room, Miss Stark was not there.  Agent Coulson was, and Gwen held back a groan.  She actually liked Agent Coulson, but he did tend to stifle one a bit.  He gave his customary, cosseting smile, and began to explain the same thing Gwen had seen in her acclimatization reading, that Miss Stark was the heir to Stark Industries, and the head of engineering there, and she had been helping them track down that rogue villain Iron Man—
, and his hands were just as warm and so gentle where they brushed Tony’s cheeks and his ears before sinking into his hair. He kissed like a man who hadn’t ever done so before, lips clumsy but gentle where they pressed against Tony’s.
“Ah, Tony!” An unpleasantly familiar voice came from behind them. “So good to see you. I was surprised to see that you weren’t sitting in the front.”
Stark put her hand on Gwen’s waist as they exited the car.  “One more thing,” she said when it was just barely too late for Gwen to respond.  “Call me Tasha.”
There were voices from outside, Rhodey and Jarvis talking to each other about setting up meeting points and how to get back to the States. Tony spent a few moments soaking it in, reveling in the fact that he was
Steve grinned and set Tony on his feet, bending over to reach for the faucet.  Oh, hey, that felt... interesting...  Steve reached around for the plug, dropping it on the floor of the tub.  “I’ll say we do.”
“Say that again when you don’t sound drugged on whatever shit’s in there and I’ll believe you,” Rhodey said, studying him closely, lines of concern etched in the skin around his eyes.
The reassurance must not have gone through very well, though:  the feeling of guilt intensified briefly, and then the bond closed off.
“More sooner than not, considering this skirt,” she said dryly before standing and stepping into her own—much more modest—shoes.  “More modest” in the sense that they were platform heels; while they appeared to be just as sky high as Stark’s, the actual arch of them was only about one and a half inches.  Given the gems on them, however, she suspected “modest” might not be the right word; the bands around her ankles had more sapphires and diamonds in gold settings than they did leather, and all together the shoes were as heavy and unwieldy as some manacles Gwen had worn.
“What, by lubing yourself up and plugging yourself open?”  Tony obviously saw the effect his words had on Steve, because his eyes narrowed and he kept going.  “How much did you work yourself open?  Did you start out slow, gentle?  That’s how I would have done it.  I would have started with my tongue.  No, don’t close up.”
At first it didn’t feel like much of anything.  He wondered if that might be a can’t-tickle-yourself phenomenon, because Tony had obviously been sensitive as hell to the first brush of Steve’s fingers.  But slipping the tip his own index finger into his hole felt... unexceptional.  Not
“As I was saying.  You would be begging, open and desperate—just like now, and have I mentioned I love you for this?—and only then,
By the time Tony walked in, Steve was, just barely, all set up.  There was a chair sitting next to the doorway, and the screen Tony had been watching him on last night was lit, displaying a camera feed from the same room.  The camera feed came from the wall opposing the bed, on the opposite side from the door, and the camera picked up colors well enough to perfectly highlight the royal blue lace Steve was wearing.
really know Tony. They’d known each other for three days, which didn’t really do much except for maybe establishing the grounds for a friendship.
He moved up with the increased access to Steve’s neck, biting and sucking until there was a dark bruise there, easily the circumference of an apple.  Steve could see it through Tony’s eyes.
It had been maybe a minute since Zemo had fired the first shot at Steve. He needed more time. More time he wouldn’t have if Zemo shot at him right now.
“I don’t…” Tony swallowed, pressing his free hand to his head as he struggled to think. It felt like his thoughts were swimming through molasses.
Neither of them wanted to move for a long time afterward, so they didn’t.  They didn’t even clean up.  Instead, they tipped sideways—more gravity than choice—and lay together in the bed, exchanging slow, grateful kisses.  From time to time, one of them would say, “Love you,” and the other one would answer, “Love you, too.”  That was the closest they came to activity, though.
“He’s not—” Tony started to say, then cut off when he realized that it felt like a lie. And off in the distance, like a vague whisper, he heard the words
Steve thought about it through the haze of arousal.  It was hard to do; words weren’t forming normally, and every time he tried to think about coming, he felt another wave of intensity and had to rub his nipple or shift his weight around the plug again.
