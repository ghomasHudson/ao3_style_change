“Okay.” Bucky nods, licking his lips, chest rising and falling with deep breaths. “It’s okay, we can stop. Everything’s okay.”
“Somehow, Y/n is able to commune with him. I don’t know how. But he gives orders still from wherever they are.”
“Tony, there’s no such thing as a three-way soul-bond. Bucky and I only have one soulmate, that's you. You’re the one with two bonds. Two separate bonds.”
His eyes trace exposed skin, starting from the low resting of his jeans, up over his navel, the defined abs, the pecks. It’s hard not to have that working in a gym as a trainer Tony supposed, he was surprised to see it.
He does stop and this time the Hulk manages to jump and pin him down. Natasha and Rocket use the chance to begin shooting the titian near the face so once again his focus is divided. Seeing your chance again, you run for it, grabbing a stone at random, and the ground drops beneath you, all becoming leveled again. Another vine of color dances across your skin and it’s red. While Thanos is still frozen you reach for another, and as your hand lands on it, there’s an explosion of white.
“So, what?” Bucky shrugs. “You can crush a phone like a coke can or punch a bag off a wall. You hear and smell things that I can’t, that no one we know can. You eat like you’ve only ever known hunger. What’s so bad about that? You are learning to control it. You are, and even if you don’t- you’ve never hurt me, I’ve lived with you ten years, and you’ve never hurt me. So, what the shower shakes, and the microwave has a dent in the pizza button. Those are just things, they don’t matter.”
Tony looks up in surprise. “What? Why’s he calling?”
“Yeah.” Tony nods again, but his eyebrows furrowed as he looks down at them. “Actually- they’re kind of numb.” It’s a mute numbness, not quite pins and needles, they still feel like they’re attached to him, but there’s a slight disconnect, a faded feeling. It’s not normal.
“Honestly, it’s fine.” Tony waves his hands again. “I’m not worried about the counters, I barely use them anyway. Besides the marble was starting to annoy me. This will give me an excuse to maybe change it out to something else.”
Tony blows out a deep breath. “That’s- a long time."
“Stop- Stop stop- get off!”
“No!” Bucky laughs, and Tony can feel it like an echo with both hands on him. “That’s not what I was going to say.” He cards his fingers through Tony’s hair again and smiles, something about it has Tony mirroring it back.
“I don’t want someone else.”
Everyone's back. Everyone's okay.
He says you don’t even know if he’s real, or if he’s a figment of your imagination, but he saved your life, which kind of makes you more than willing to listen.
Tony smiles. “While I’m sure the flesh one is just as amazing, yes, the metal one. I just wanted to take a peek inside. It’s totally okay if you’re uncomfortable with it, I won’t ask again, I promise.”
“Incoming,” Bruce whispers as he passes Steve heading for the weights. Not that he needed the warning, he can smell the stench of Brock coming close over the smell of bleach.
“It still happened!”
It takes them about two hours and an entire eruption of both their closets, and one quick trip to the store so Bucky can get a new glove.
“Yeah, I bet he is.” Tony throws his cup away. “Alright, I’m ready.”
“What? I- what sacrifice?”
“I uh- I don’t have any more of my pills.” He sighs, rubbing a hand over his face, he tries to calm himself. Mentally repeating that he’s safe and alone.
You were trying to think which tactic would work, staying still, playing dead, or intimidation, yelling-roaring making yourself seem the bigger predator.
A wave of anxiety washed over him at the prospect. The meeting seemed to go well. Demolished counter top aside, Tony reacted so well to it. But what if he was just never planning to see them again?
“It’s Bucky Sir.”
“You have insurance on your counter?” Steve asks curiosity breaking through the shame.
“Peggy? That girl you took on a date years ago?”
“She didn’t say.” He shrugs.
Tony smiles on the other end and she can practically hear it in his voice. “Bye Pepper, it was nice talking to you. Don’t be late, give Rhody my love!” He hangs up laughing before she gets a chance to respond. He smiles down at his phone, and the weight of it suddenly seems too much. The distance between them too far. He lets it slide from his fingers and fall to the floor.
That’s a new voice, deeper, and a lot more focused much like Stephen's.
Guess who's voice that was in the readers head, and what was the light coming out of their hand? And why didn't Stephen warn them about it before they kept walking?
“Hey. How’d it go?” Steve asked, slipping into the room. Tony had laid back on the bed, fatigue catching up with him.
Yeah, it was a stressful event.
“If you’re sure.”
“Hey, Buck.” He says when he enters the room. He sniffs hard once and regrets it as the smell of sweat and other not very nice things fill his nose. Another side effect, his smell is a lot stronger. All of his senses are.
Steve’s eyes go wide, and he drops his pencil. “What?”
“It’s an arm.” Tony chuckles. “Metal yes, but just an arm, and as you can see, I work with metal all the time. It’s not going to scare me. It might, however, anger my contractors when I tell them I need new counters so soon.”
His teeth chatter together as he shivers violently, gasping as he’s going as fast as he can. Until he takes a step and the ground never meets his foot.
“You can fix it?” Steve asks.
“That doesn’t mean roll over and show our bellies in fear! We fight!”
Bucky: Got the night shift, other than that nothing. You should come by if you’re free.
“I don’t know either.” You flex your fingers as your wounds itch in your hand and up your arm. The painkillers you took are working heavenly, but the drying blood is starting to bother you. “I asked Stephen, and he said it’s because he saw me standing at the front of it all when we win. I don’t know why, or how. But I was there when he saw it.”
He looks down at his phone, it lays open on the floor in front of him, keyboard up and indicator blinking as if telling him to just say something. Already knowing what he’s going to say is the problem itself. He’ll say no, and Steve will take it as outright rejection, when Tony just doesn’t want to go in public, and he doesn’t want to tell them why, so he can’t just
"And what about Clint?how does he make you feel?"
“Tony, it’s Tuesday evening what do you normally do on a Tuesday evening?”
"So it is not about Steve?"
It gave him something to think about but the only person he would ever think about being with was sadly out of Steves league.
"And where should I tell them you are gone to?" " I have to go see Rhodey, I'll be a while" and with that Tony jumped into a car and sped off
In the immediate and shocked silence that greeted that Tony didn't notice that Natasha and Bruce automatically turned to him to make sure he was okay.
"Leave it to me Steve,I'll organise everything and I have the prefect idea for a trip you will love"
Here Doom paused for thought for a moment and then went on “But if he really is single, can I get his number off you Dr Stark?”
"Its Steve"
"Jarvis,would it be possible to get away without anyone knowing where I went?The team is great but I know if they thought I was hurting they would all want to help me and I just need some time alone."
"Ok,that's good advise.I thought Peggy was the one for me but now looking back... I loved her,but as an amazing woman who I wanted to be part of her life.I could see she was beautiful and talented and strong but I was attracted to her as a person,or as an ideal but not actually with her.I was in love with this fantasy. I don't mean to take away from her but she wasn't meant for me" Steve looked down at his hands that were clenched up in frustration and took a moment to steady himself. "Since I woke up I never thought there would be anyone for me.I'm a soldier and Jarvis I've made decisions that haunt me. I couldn't see a person who could ever love me after all the things I've done."
"Oh, because Steves not gay,right"
Natasha,Clint,Bruce and Thor immediately looked more relieved at the thought of Jarvis watching over Steve. Tony, why Tony on the other hand looked like Thor has just hit him with Mjolnir.
Tony threw the ceiling a filthy look at the thought of Steve being away and asked "Jarvis, where is Steve now?who is he with?"
Bruce eventually realised someone was trying to get his attention and looked around to see an impatient looking Tony. "Hi Tones, how are..." but before he could even finish Tony interrupted him "I'm great Bruce,absolutey great, no matter what ANYONE, say Hammer or anyone else, says I am doing great, A1, on top of the world, all good in the hood"
"No, Steve is taking some time to think about things himself.Give him that time, but Tony you have to.take some time,no distractions, no last minute business trips, nothing like that, and think about what you want"
"Captain,if I may say love is a good thing" Steve smiled up at Jarvis "Jarvis,firstly how many times do I have to tell you to call me Steve and secondly you are right love is a good thing, but  Tony doesn't love me and he will never see me like that.The last thing I would ever want to do is to hurt him or to lose our friendship. I just need to accept I love him but he will never love me back. I need sometime to think about this and maybe just be by myself"
"Not that it's any of your business but Steve and I aren't attached at the hip, and we are not dating we just have set times every week that we go out and have dinner or go to the movies"
"HOLY SHIT! Steve is totally gay" "Sir,if I may...."
(" I'm ruined for life!when will I met anyone better looking than him!")
"Jarvis, I don't want to put you in a bad position but would it be possible to talk to you about something and for you to keep it from Tony?" asked Steve. Jarvis seemed to take a minute to think this over before replying "As long as it's nothing that could harm Sir there is no issue with that Captain".Steve automatically smiled up at the ceiling in relief(no matter how many times Tony told him Jarvis didn't live in the ceiling Steve couldn't help himself).
"What could be more important for Steve than us" wondered Tony out loud.
Bruce, who could speak Tony, gave him a minute to get comfortable and then kindly asked "Is this about Steve?"
“You’re disgusting, Steven, and you called Bucky here a caveman. Honestly, I feel like Pygmalion here. No more eating in underwear if you don’t learn some manners,” Tony reacted haughtily.
" Bucky exclaimed, arching his back into the touch. Steve tried to memorize every detail because he was definitely gonna try and draw this. The vibrant red of the tentacle was beautiful against Bucky's tanned skin, curled possessively around Bucky's bared throat.
“I'm not coming out,” Tony said, sounding petulant.
“No, we're not.” Steve sighed as he picked up his coffee. “Tony already doesn't trust us, we're not gonna add to that.” It was a low blow, playing the trust card, but he was flying blind here, and he really wanted to resolve whatever this was and proceed into hangover cuddling.
When Tony sagged against him, even put his arms around Steve’s neck, he pulled him tighter, relief of Tony being alive and with them again battling with the worry about Tony having tentacles. Tentacles!
“Well duh. Don’t pretend you didna have fun feelin’ me up durin’ breakfast,” Bucky smirked.
They managed to hobble upstairs and crashed in their bed in a tangle of limbs and more limbs, falling asleep feeling sated and secure. Post hangover sex naps were the absolute best, in Steve’s opinion.
When he got to the hallway he could hear hushed voices upstairs. Sounded like Tony and Bucky were awake as well, they probably hadn't come down so as not to wake him. He tried to relieve himself as fast as he could, which wasn't very fast at all since he was still in his fighter pilot overalls and the zipper got stuck. He cursed Tony and his love of uniforms until he got the thing down.
Wish you could feel what I felt,” Tony whispered, sounding strained, but Steve was too overcome by all the sensations to answer with more than a moan.
He quickly mounted the stairs to find Bucky sitting on the landing with his back against the bathroom door. Steve noticed he was still in his costume (the Dude), his face haggard with large bags under his eyes. When Steve stumbled upstairs he sighed in relief.
“Of course you do, not even you are that perfect,” Tony’s sullen voice was moving away from the door again.
“C’mere, you. It’s your turn now,” Bucky waved Tony closer, grabbing hold of the dicktentacle that was swollen stiff and slick with lube.
At this rate he would come quicker than he had ever before, and he leaned against Bucky's side, drawing strength to hold out as long as he could.
“How the hell would I know?” Tony looked down as well, wiggling some of his body experimentally and Steve wished he’d stop doing that, because, yeah, he could definitely see the why of tentacle porn now.
"Gorgeous," Tony uttered and trailed his human hands where the tentacles first were.
Bucky didn’t even deign to receive Steve’s look of annoyance, whipping his phone out his robe pocket instead.
“Don't you dare tell him, Barnes,” Tony yelled. Steve supposed it was meant to sound menacing, but Tony sounded more scared than anything, and all it did was rack up Steve’s worry.
“I hate you,” Tony piped up again, “Barnacle.”
“Look, you were right,” Bucky said and lifted his laptop to show Tony something, the beginning of a smile on his lips.
“Why, sweetheart?”
“What, Stevie,” was Bucky’s reply, slightly muffled from where he was kissing along Tony’s jaw.
As if Tony read his thoughts, Steve felt something move between their bodies, something dextrous and agile. Not agile enough to get ahold of the zipper, though, and Tony pulled back from the kiss to huff in annoyance, looking down at the tentacle that failed to do its job with a frown.
“Better stop or he’s gonna pop before the fun part,” Bucky warned, so Steve pulled back and wiped his chin on his sleeve.
“Did you take a good look at that text you were readin’ from? Cause now we’ve calmed down and eaten some I’m thinkin’ we can look for clues, yeah?”
Steve eyed the tip of the hectocothing and saw possibilities.
“For, you know,” Tony waved at the lower half of his body, “not freaking out on me.”
Having tentacles has its pros and cons. The hentai-like sex they have definitely counts as a pro. The con? Not being able to wear workout clothes for weeks because of the markings.
“You’re fucking with me.” Steve really, really wanted this to be a huge prank. Served him right for getting into a shots competition. Tony had warned him to leave honour at home and back out, hadn’t he?
“What?” Steve looked puzzled between Bucky and the door, needing a little more time and maybe some bacon and eggs to get his brain back online. And coffee. Definitely coffee. “Why is he..? What are you..?”
“Hmm, supposedly there’s a
Steve put his hands on his hips as he tried to see if one of the arms was different from the others, but from where he was standing they all looked the same.
When Steve winked at him, mouth still full, he felt something curl around his ankle under the table. He almost choked on his pancake, until he saw Tony looking smug. The tentacle slowly moved until it wriggled its way underneath the fabric of Steve’s overalls, caressing the skin of his calf.
It was Bucky’s turn to look annoyed at Steve, getting up from his chair to wrap an arm around Tony’s shoulders.
“You look real pretty sitting on Stevie like that,” Bucky remarked form across the table. His voice was a lazy rumble, and he looked at them like they were a snack ready to eat.
There was a glint in his eye and a blush to his cheeks that told Steve Tony was liking the way they were approaching things now, so he bent forward to pull Tony into a kiss, a real one with tongues and lips and Tony’s hands in his hair. Steve pushed the bra down far enough to bare Tony’s nipples, running his hands gently up and down over them until they were stiff and sensitive and Tony moaned low in his throat.
He thought he had made enough of a racket for the other two to realise he was awake and come down, but when he opened the door they were still quietly talking. Now that he wasn't as preoccupied with taking a leak he noticed the voices came from the upstairs hall. Which was weird. Bucky sounded scared too. What was going on?
“Wow,” Bucky said slumped against Steve, stroking the tentacle nearest to him, a thing Steve momentarily didn’t feel the strength to do.
"Stop making them yourself then," Tony quipped. Steve felt tentacles move over his back and his shoulder, caressing him softly and wasn’t it the nicest thing, being wrapped up like this.
“Are you… are you in pain, Tony? How are you feeling?” Bucky had stepped closer as well, running a hand over Tony’s back, stopping just short of where his ass used to be. “I’m so sorry I didn’t stop you, doll,” he said, and looked heartbroken.
“Hmm,” Steve agreed eloquently, smiling softly at their beautiful, tentacled lover.
“Ground,” Tony ordered around a moan. “Definitely ground.”
Bucky stroked slowly up and down the swollen part of the tentacle, clearly searching for what felt best. When he rubbed his thumb over the groove on the inside Tony all but wailed, his other tentacles attaching themselves to Steve’s legs. Steve wouldn’t be able to wear shorts for weeks and he loved every second of it.
"Yes, dear?"
Steve thought he could come from that sensation alone. They let go with a wet suction sound and Tony's gasp made Steve look back at him.
“You should eat in a bra more often,” he said with a grin around a mouthful of pancake. He really shouldn’t eat this much, it spelled two extra morning runs this week, but Bucky’s food was just too damn good.
“I kinda liked sitting in your lap,” Tony confessed, two of his tentacles and his human arms wiggling nervously, like it was something to be ashamed of. Steve didn’t understand, Tony sat in his lap more often, but maybe octopeople didn’t do that?
“Woah, did you know octopuses have nine brains? Every tentacle has its own brain.” Bucky exclaimed, making all three of them look intently at the tentacles for a minute.
“After I thought you had a tentacle face this is really not that bad,” Steve grinned, earning him a splash of water in the face. “Come on, let’s go get you dried off and put some breakfast in you.” Steve fetched a towel and helped Tony out of the tub, hugging him tight for a moment. “It’ll be alright, you’ll see.”
look and stood as well. “He’s not a squid, he’s a cephalopod.”
Steve thought to himself, but it was no use and he almost snickered, feeling really bad immediately afterwards. To cover it up he pulled Tony into a kiss and let his hands roam down a little, to where the swell of Tony’s ass used to be. The skin was rough there, much rougher than Steve had thought an octopus would feel. Warmer too. The top was still Tony though, and kissing Tony had always been one of Steve’s favourite things to do.
“Holy shit, doll, you’re gorgeous,” Bucky said as he let his eyes roam over the entirety of Tony.
Steve had to agree. The tentacles started around where Tony’s hips should be, as thick as Steve’s thigh and gradually tapering off towards the tip. They were a vivid red, but where they hit the light they shimmered and appeared almost golden. It fit really well with the Princess Leia costume he was still wearing the top half of.
Tony still pretended nothing was going on, nibbling daintily on his pancake and looking at Steve with that wide eyed gaze that did things to Steve. “You sure, Steve? There’s still some pancakes left.”
Bucky pulled back far enough to watch as a tentacle wrapped itself around Steve’s dick, stroking up and down. It was a little too tight, but just on the right side of painful and Steve closed his eyes at the sensation of something as… knobbly but soft jerking him.
“Got it,” Tony smiled when Bucky pulled back, playing with the rope of Bucky’s bathrobe with one hand. “Hentai, huh?”
Steve still had no clue what was going on here. It seemed a bit too elaborate to be a prank, but what Bucky claimed was too preposterous to be true. His headache was steadily getting worse, and Steve knew the painkillers were in the bathroom with Tony.
“I’m full,” Steve declared loudly when Bucky let out a soft moan and his eyelids drooped. He shoved his plate away and inwardly cursed his choice of costume again. Next year
“Sounds logical.” Steve reached out and turned on the bath, but turned to Tony. “Should there be salt in there? Aren’t all cephalopods salt water creatures?”
“He was talkin’
Tony took a moment to answer, but then nodded, biting his lower lip. This would be when Bucky would’ve hugged Tony from behind, trapping him in their love-sandwich, but the tentacles were too voluminous, so he settled next to Steve and cupped Tony’s jaw.
“You’re staring, Buckaroo,” Tony said. While he spoke he brought another tentacle up to pick up a spoon and dip it in the jam. He brought the spoon to Bucky’s mouth. “Try this, it’s got a nice flavour, don’t you think?” Bucky obediently took the bite and nodded, staring wide eyed at their boyfriend who looked like the cat who got the canary.
“Come out and stop me,” Bucky hollered back, and yay, Steve's headache was back. Bucky stroked an angry hand through his hair. “Our moron genius in there tried an incantation and transformed himself into some kind of… thing? Don' rightly know cause one moment there's this blindin’ light and the next I see some Davy Jones kinda shit scurrying outta the room.”
Steve gave Bucky his long suffering ‘
“Sir, yes sir,” Bucky griped, but it was faint, his whole posture slumped as he was weighed down with fatigue and worry.
Steve fell down on his knees in front of Tony and pulled him into a hug. “I’m relieved for you, honey.”
He misses her, he misses Rhody, his house, the lab, everything, and he can’t go back. He’s too scared to go back. He rubs his hands over his face as he lies back on the couch. Sometimes the fear turns into a bout of rage when he’s reminded of everything he can’t have, because of Killian and his stupid face. He sighs wondering how exactly he’s ever going to get his life back.
“Any attempt at killing me is foolish at this point. But I expected more. You could at least have come up with a better plan.”
Long story short, he’s been hard since he hugged Tony. Which is embarrassing, he’s not a teenager, hugs shouldn’t give him full boners that he can’t will away no matter how hard he tried, and he tried hard.
“The movement on this is amazing.” Tony’s entire face lights up as he speaks like there’s nothing else in the entire world that’d make him happier than this metal hand in front of him. “and the way it’s shaped to look exactly like a hand and how some of these panels mimic the palmar flexion creases.” Tony whistles. “Wow. Can I see your other hand?” Bucky nods numbly and lifts his flesh hand, palm facing up. “It’s almost identical with your real hand. This is amazing. Who made it?”
No one gets it. They’ll never understand.
“Good, I’ll call you back soon.”
“Someone’s crying.”
“What if you’re more connected to him than I am?”
He’s denying himself the things that made him happy, to hide from the one thing that made him scared. He wasn’t this depressed before, wasn’t this hurt. He was healthy at some point. The voices quieter when he was at home, he had better distractions, he had his medication.
Tony fought and pushed, clawing at the emptiness that managed to weigh down on him. Until he opened his eyes and realized it had all been a dream. He let out gasping breaths, clutching his chest and turning over in bed, pushing his face into a pillow and curling his body up, making himself smaller, a last-ditch attempt to protect himself until the fear subsided.
“Can you tell him I miss him?”
Too bad none of it was true. Alcoholic maybe. Tony likes to drink, so what? It’s not like he does it every day, it’s not like he gets blackout drunk either. Everyone only thinks he’s an addict because he took his medication in public one time, and Obie would rather tell everyone he has a problem with drugs than mental health.
“That’s what you can do.” Bucky smiles. Steve snaps back to attention confused.
“What is it?” You ask.
You roll your eyes. “Shows what you know.” You reach into your pocket, and stop when you meet nothing but empty space. “What? Where the hell is my phone?”
After declining Bucky’s offer to come over, Bucky settled on just staying on the phone, talking until Tony felt better. It was strange feeling a panic inside him dissipate when it wasn’t originally his in the first place. Tony’s reluctance to tell him why he was feeling that way didn’t bother him in the slightest, he was just happy to help any small way Tony would let him.
“Who? Strange? Because I’d like to talk to that bastard too, ask him why everyone dying was the ‘only way’.”
“Yeah, you’re probably right.” Tony chuckles and then looks around. “Hey, where’d your friend go?”
“So, I’m the only one with two soul-bonds, and you two… just happen to know each other and find me in the span of a few hours?”
“He’s going to fit me in somewhere to get scans. He’s not sure how serious it is yet.”
You go back up the steps grabbing the backpack you dropped and listen to the address Stephen gives you.
He takes a moment to finally look it over and grimaces at the sight. It's bent unnaturally, bone out of place and causing a raised bump the skin the whole area is already swelling something fierce, and his heart races, even more, thinking about how the hell he’s supposed to deal with this. It’s not a cut that he can just bandage and ignore. This is serious, he can’t even move his fingers without pain.
“What were you even doing at his place while he was asleep?”
Going at your own speed, Steve’s already bent down, searching the crashed area and aircraft for signs of life. The street and houses around are in complete destruction. Luckily the aircraft looks alright. For such a crash landing.
“You know… I mean what you two have is probably great, I mean- since high school. That’s gotta be nothing less than amazing. Sure, you wanna just throw a random wrench in the gears and hope everything runs smoothly?”  He’s not making eye contact anymore. Suddenly his eyes are glued to one particular crack in the counter, which is absolutely destroying his casual façade.
The music changes, fast passed and urgent. Tony’s eyes are drawn to the screen just in time for a jump scare, a character getting snatched away by a large monstrous beast.
You look up and meet his eyes. You’re shocked to see the halo of light around his head is much larger and brighter than everyone else’s. It sharpens as he looks at you and you realize it’s showing his intent.
He hasn’t muted Jarvis once since he moved. But he can’t handle the lecturing right now. Work is all he needs, it’s all he has. But he can’t see, as he looks down at the pages, as his vision blurs with tears. His hands are shaking too. God. Why did this have to happen today? Why did this have to happen at all?
“Yeah- I just- I never let anyone touch it besides Steve.”
“You can’t just say that like it’s easy. You’d be waiting a long time, and it’s not guaranteed. You’ll always be waiting.”
Bucky just stares at it, the impression of Steve’s hand and the cracks spreading out around it like a shattered mirror.
It’s too soon. That doesn’t change. There was no chance to say goodbye. Everyone was simply there one second and gone the next. You’re not quite sure how to handle the loss. It’s shock, you’re sure that the numbness you feel keeping you from crying or fully experiencing the grief is shock.
You look him over, he still doesn’t have any shoes, but he’s not hurt anywhere, and the cookies tell you he’s had food so you aren’t worried about that. “What’s your name?”
Bucky: Hey.
Another flash of light and the two of you snap back to reality with a rough wave of energy, you step away, back colliding with the slowly fading forcefield that had grown around the two of you. You hold your left hand up, and the Infinity Stones whine. The ones left on Thanos’ gauntlet, lift off into the air, and then come to you, resting themselves on the others. Becoming one. The power is intense and burns through you painfully. But you’ve accepted your sacrifice, they will do what you want them too.
Tony’s sinking. Up to his neck in freezing water, and his limbs are about to give out. He wonders, if it’s true that your life flashes before your eyes when you die. He hopes it isn’t.
Stephen reminds you.
“No. We’re not. Just best friends.” Steve says, and now it’s Tony who looks confused.
Tony touches the hard of his palm to his forehead, feeling a migraine coming on. “I-I can’t. I need to work.”
His entire body deflates, he steps back to the wall, and slides down to the floor heavily, taking long deep ragged breaths and waits for the room to stop spinning. His injured arm hovered above his lap, not allowing it to bump into anything, he’s constantly wincing at the tiniest of movements that cause it to ache more in pain.
And he wasn't sure this wasn't the kind of information one wanted to receive over text.
“Alright.” He walks over to the small counter in the corner of the room, a clipboard sits there, a small stack of pages on it that Tony can’t read. The doctor pulls a pen from his best pocket and begins writing in quick small movements. The scratches of pen on paper are the only noises that fill the room. Tony couldn’t think of anything else.
“Who?”
“At first it was almost like someone had left a T.V on too loud. Eventually, when Stephen started speaking, everything else got quieter but was still there. When I talk to you, or there are other sounds going on, it’s easy to ignore. But now, when it’s quiet… it’s almost like I’m locked in a cafeteria filled with endless amounts of people and separate conversations. When Stephen or Bucky talk to me directly it’s like they’re speaking directly into my ear. Or are at least as close to you as you are to me right now.”
He meant to say something else, keep the conversation going but a powerful yawn cut him off and now he’s really feeling it.
“Oh.” Steve hasn’t seen that glove in a while. It’s black, with leather-like material covering it. Bucky’s arm has these panels that help it gain movement and shift. Sometimes in the hand, because it’s got so many tiny panels, it catches on fabric and tears it. So when he goes somewhere fancy or just wants to look nice, he uses the leather one. “I thought you weren’t coming up with me?”
Steve opens his mouth about to make another offer but Tony cuts it off quick.
By the time Bucky arrived Tony was already taken off to get his scans done. Steve stayed behind in the room mostly to wait for him, but also because he wouldn't be allowed to stand with Tony while he got scanned anyway.
But that didn’t matter now. He left. If things go his way, he’ll never see Killian again, and… and he wasn’t going to live by what Killian had taught him. He was going to be his own person, think for himself. Which means… he should give this a chance because Killian would tell him not to. So yeah, he’s going to do it, to spite him.
He turns his head to look down the street. He’s never seen New York so empty. So much for the city that never sleeps.
“Sorry, it’s a little gnarly.”
Bucky had seen Steve do that hundreds of times. He had drawings of Steve’s framed and placed around the apartment all over. But never had he seen any picture look quite so alive. Almost like it was a real person trapped between the pages that would move at any moment and call for help or try their escape. Bucky reaches out for the sketch, tracing the darkest shading with his finger.
Now getting a look inside, he’s careful in assessing, it’s a bit different than the sketches on file, but with time he assumes some wires have lost their color and shifted out of place. He suppresses his excitement for an air of profession for Bucky’s sake.
“Before it was damaged? I’d say about twenty.” She shrugs.
“Great! He was just nervous because you left very quickly. So he sent me up. I was wondering if maybe you’d be willing to come down and speak to him? Or have him come up? You know, just to properly meet?”
You can feel it. You can feel everything. All of the stones in hand, a rainbow of colors dance across your vision and skin. The stones they give you this connection to the universe. You feel everything all at once, the knowledge of what you must do, and the ability to see everything that comes after as a result.
Steve’s in the back, with the punching bags. No one else is in the room, which he prefers when trying to get his workout. Strange for someone who works at the gym and should be used to it now, but he’s different from the average trainer.
He doesn’t need any reminding.
What if he didn’t choose them over whoever he was dating before.
“cause that worked so well the last time.” Rocket scoffs, sitting on the ground taking his gun apart and cleaning it.
The knock at the door offers him an escape from thinking about it. He pulls the door open and can’t help the smile on his face when he sees them both carrying two bags each.
Once Steve was gone, they entered the room, Tony taking seat on the patient bed, feeling his heart race. The doctor washed his hands and placed gloves on before walking over and gesturing to the arm Tony was cradling.
It took two hours for Bruce to call back.
It’s barely a five-minute walk to the gym, which Tony is grateful for because he’s already feeling winded by the time he steps through the automatic doors.
“Actually Sir,” Jarvis says. “In the bottom of the first file, you will see that your father had a partner on this project. An Arnim Zola.”
“Well, it’s not like we had a name count of everyone who was missing across the entire universe. But everyone we knew of is back.” Tony smiles, handing you the warm container, of what looks like chocolate chip. “A good number of them are out there, would you like to meet them?”
“I can’t!” He yells. “it’s not working.” He doesn’t mean to be so curt with her but he’s frustrated. It comes out wrong, and he can tell the moment her eyes snap up to him that it was a mistake.
Close enough for what you weren’t sure. But here you were following tunnels waiting for your next order. It’s dark everywhere except where the light lands from the flashlight and the ground is uneven. You take a miscalculated step and slip falling forward, holding your arm out reflexively to catch yourself, on your injured hand, calling out in pain as the stitches in your palm rip against the brunt of a rock.
Everyone seemed to have the silent agreement, that Steve couldn’t be trusted to make the soundest decisions. Bruce and Natasha had lost the least in this. Apparently living a life with little ties to the world was a good thing. They cared about the Avengers, but they had loved each other. Bruce had cared a little more than Natasha, she was a spy, not heartless, but she knew how to separate feelings and work. Which she had to during the fight that broke up the Avengers. Bruce had spent two years off Earth altogether. Most of that time he spent stuck as the Hulk. Funny enough the Hulk chooses now to recede and hide it out.
Steve and Tony left the townhouse to find after about twenty minutes once they realized you were gone. At first, it was clear you were just giving them space, but Tony was anxious for answers from Stephen himself, and for proof, which he could only get through you apparently. Steve was content to just wait, maybe try and catch up with Tony some more. But that seemed to be the very opposite of what Tony was up for, understandably, there were more important things going on, and from the sound of it, Stephen said there was a sort of time limit to all of this.
It’s the boy’s father, at least you’re assuming so. The pain had shot in your head the moment you laid eyes on him. It’s been begging you to keep him safe ever since.
Bucky nods, “That’s when I got it.”
“I was just trying to see if he was single. You’re over here trying to hint at his financial status. News flash Stevie, people are sensitive about money. Don’t bring it up on a first date. But why am I surprised you don’t know this? It’s not like you’ve ever made it to a second.” The moment it’s out of Bucky’s mouth he regrets it. It’s a low blow, a very low blow, considering the fact that Steve’s never had a second date has nothing to do with communication skills and more to do with his overly strong body.
He chickened out. Texting the easier option.
“Attaboy.” Bucky claps, standing up. “I’m just going to man the desk since you’re leaving. Don’t eat my pie. I know exactly how much is left, and if you so much as eat a crumb I’m taking it out of your ass.”
“Not Gomora.” You say. “She was gone before that.” Rocket huffs sadly, turning away from the group.
“Dancing like she’s trying to break it again.”
Yeah? It’s probably all the clean air I’ve been breathing. Not as much oil or smoke here.”
“I’d feel a lot better if you woke up right about now.” He says, placing the bandage back on securely. But you don’t move an inch. He brings his fingers up to your neck and takes your pulse. Your heart is beating faster than usual but that’s just because of blood loss. “You’re supposed to tell us what to do next.” That part he whispers. Every bit of hope he has left is riding on you, and you’re a connection to everyone they lost. Without it… there may be nothing left to save.
She looks to Thanos, and then back to you.
“Both.” Tony shrugs. He knows Obie would have called this a hobby. Anything other than building weapons is a hobby in that man’s eyes. But to Tony this is work. Ever since he turned eighteen and gained full control of Stark industries it’s been work. They haven’t sold a single weapon or made a weapon design in over ten years and he’s damn proud of it, even if Obie keeps trying to push him into starting it up again. “I’m an engineer.” He says, leaving out the fact that he’s technically a lot more than that.
More doom and gloom I'm afraid, but that's what you signed up for! I cranked this bad boy out in a day thanks to y'alls wonderful comments! I hope you enjoy.
“Ms. Stark, you are only seventeen-”
Her drunk mind flipped through possiblites to celebrate, all of which involved getting drunk.
“Alpha, an older asset, before your time, was a leader, impossible to look away from, impossible to refuse.”
Toni choked on air, “Richards? As in Reed Richards? As in this is your party?”
“To be fair she was older than me at the time, and she had it coming.”
Antoinette nodded, “Yes. My father fought in one, he create a world changing invention too.”
Manya strode towards her and grabbed her wrist, “You’re fine. You didn’t assume anything, I shouldn’t have left the party. Are you ok to go back?”
“I don’t care” was her anthem for a while, all the way till Christmas when her parents requested her presences at Stark Manor. The stuffy old house seemed like hell and she meant to decline, but the carefully worded letter was filled with concern, and hope, and that was two more emotions than Maria normally managed.
It took months before she managed to pull herself together again. She’d stared at a bottle of booze for what felt like years, before she found every bottle in the tower and poured them down the drain one by one. She was tired of moving backwards.
Isadora was eliminated after Nika. A small girl, Mila, was forced to cut her throat.
“Yes.”
She’d arrived back at the mansion covered in bruises and cuts, and was sent to the infirmary for weeks, only arriving back with a crutch and a bad attitude.
Her smile was thin and fake, and it gave Toni a slimy uneasy feeling. She then reached into her coat pocket and pulled out a square cloth. Toni couldn’t flinch away when she pressed the towelette to her mouth and nose, it stung only a little, but Toni was burning with anger when the world got darker, and the faces surrounding her faded.
But her plan was already in motion, in a few moments, a maid would barge in, finding them in this state, and quickly alert Manya's father. She would be unharmed, but Toni would be dragged out of the mansion and secretly killed.
“I don’t remember,” Natasha says,
“Don’t talk to him, he’s trying to get under your skin,” Natasha says,
She wanted to trust him. She remembered him, as Dad’s friend and partner. He’d look out for her.
Her train of thought was interrupted by the realization that her new laptop was not in the room. It wasn’t a very large room, and Toni knew she hadn’t misplaced it, it’d been a gift from her father, well partially. He’d given her the resources to build a computer and the screen schematics, but she built it, and gave him back hair designs. The new Stark Computers looked eerily similar to her own, but she didn’t particularly care. It wasn’t anywhere near Willa’s stuff, she never touched Willa’s bed or desk. Suddenly she remembered Willa’s rush to get out of the room, and refusal to let Toni touch any of her bags, one of which was so big it could hold the clunky laptop. She’d been running down the hall, right towards Sasha’s room.
“You don’t know that.” Toni pauses, “He could escape, it’s what they do. I’ll never get-”
Then the Stark Industries board was more concerned with her mental stability, which was just another hoop she had to jump through.
Toni said, “Yeah. It’s quiet. I like to work out here sometimes.”
She went alone, though she probably shouldn’t have. If it was a trap, she would have been screwed.
Toni wheezed, and rolled off her back so she could look down the road for the emergency response trucks, but a big shard of glass dug into her hip when she did so and she finally yelped a little. The corners of her vision were going dark, she could hear the operator asking for a response, but she still couldn’t say a word.
Toni let herself greive before selling the apartment. She didn’t even like it anyways.
Brynn didn’t seem made exactly, just a little surprised but firm that she’d tolerate no more dead parents jokes.
The girl is carrying a couple bags and a few more are behind her, She’s out of breath when she says, “Hi! I’m Lucette, which one of you is Antoinette?”
“It’s even funnier, that you don’t remember me!” Toni exclaims, “Because, for the longest time, I didn’t either.”
She can hear a low groan from behind her. Tania is lying on the ground nearby.
“You’ve been itching to kill me since I was eight years old. You begged the Instructors to let you eliminate us, you craved it.”
She wanted to ask what it was, and where she was going, but the grim faces of the suits told her silence was her best bet.
Steve pauses for a minute, and Toni is subconsciously arguing about whether or not she should try and make conversation, or let him do it.
It feels like mere minutes till the chopper lands in an empty field, just outside of Kiev. She can see the beginnings of the skyline, and she had just a few hours to make her way to the hotel.
“That’s not what I meant.” Steve said, turning around for a second he looked understanding and empathetic, but then he glanced at the Avengers conspicuously watching from the living room, “So don’t you try and twist my words! Ok, you’re not the victim here!” He yelled
“Annie? Annie? What’s wrong?”
“Well I’m already out for the night but Reed Richards son is having his 18th right now, it’s only just started but it’s at the mansion?”
Whoever was driving by could help her, she turned over to her stomach, twisting her ankle, and kneeled on the asphalt. “Hey!” she called out, her voice raspy but surprisingly loud, “Help me! Please help!”
Instead of going straight to Madame’s office, Toni stopped, Instructor Zma stood in the doorway and pointed up the stairs, where Tania and Eva stood.
The Instructor, Matveev, starts the class meeting like any other,
“I’ll let you know when I figure it out.”
“Any day now.” One boy remarked, she felt the crowds impatience.
She stayed all weekend and they switched from fucking to watching bad Netflix Original movies like it was nothing. She thought for a moment she could get used to it, to having a girlfriend to watch stuff with. Brynn wouldn’t be a bad option for girlfriend.
Drop a like or comment to keep this weird flow of writing from me, I have no idea where it came from and I'm too afraid to question it!
Target: Koila Nailatikau
“There’s not a better way.” Toni said. She’d known where this was going since she saw Nika in the chair, she’d just been afraid. But she has to live. She had to.
Rogers had really been trying to acclumate to modern day, but at ‘he or she’ his face twitched, she saw it. Whatever. It’s fine. It’s. Fine.
The gun had been discarded on the ground when Toni flew to Tania’s side,
The word rang in her skull, she remembered the name. The soldier. Madame told her about him the first time she was here. He was an asset of Hydra.
Despite her instructions Antonia lingers beside the grouping of tables. She quickly identified her change of clothes and put them on, but most of the others are filled with tools a dentist might use.
“We don’t have to tell everyone. I mean I wasn’t thinking a press conference.” She looks down at her hands, “Just our friends. The Avengers.”
“Let’s start with the positions.” She went the five most basic positions, and had every girl go through them twenty times each before she was satisfied, then they all did them in unison another dozen times till they got that right.
“Annie honey, who made fun of you?”
No one talks for the rest of the night, and Toni barely sleeps. Everytime her eyes close a little, she gets flashes of nightmares.
“How clever.” She says, “But there’s a major flaw in your plan. I don’t allow candidates to escape.”
The party seemed less dull suddenly, and since Maria was leaving the following morning, Toni just wanted to go home.
-January 8th Adam and Eve were created in the first week and were quickly sent away from Eden after being tempted by the serpent, often recognized as Satan himself or at least a demon of Satan. I couldn’t find anything on the exact date Lucifer fell from Heaven, but I’ve heard conflicting reports, that Lucifer meddled with Adam and Eve which was his wrongdoing against god, or that he had already fallen and was just doing his satanic thing. I’ve gone with the former, as Toni becomes ‘Lucifer’ in this chapter and according to the Catholic version of the story, and believe me I’ve read them all from Judaism to Islam, I went with this being the act that creates Satan, or Lucifer. Also, hypersexuality is a symptom of PTSD and poor mental health if observed after a sexual assault. I think it’s and underrepresented symptom and it fights Toni’s character really well since she's a control freak and losing control like that would’ve been really traumatic
Asset: Asset Name Confirmed, Awaiting Final Candidate
But in the meantime, she has to plan for revenge, because if she’s going down, Sasha sure as hell will too.
“Nitrogen.” She replies looking up for a second before returning to the drawing, “Why nitrogen?”
“Doesn’t matter Mr. Pierce, because she’s not yours.”
“Don’t!” Willa exclaimed, “I have them.” She reached down and grabbed the large leather bag that could’ve hidden a dead body, and rushed down the hall without another word.
Finally they arrived at a strange looking door. It was clear enough to see blurred shapes and giant streaks of light, but everything had a white film over it.
A light tap on the glass tells her she needs to leave, “Bye Captain.”
Manya Volkov had been assigned to another asset months ago, but after proving unsuccessful, Toni was given the case.
The whole thing seemed insane, Fury being shot down in his apartment, Kate- Sharon being a SHIELD agent this whole time, and the person following him and the shooter. Who were they? Whose side were they on?
Her left hand is still handcuffed to the frame, so she gets up, her arm being twisted behind her back wasn’t comfortable. She leverages her body backwards, so she lays on her back on top of the thin bed, with her hand stuck to the cold metal frame.
She looked at her feet, crisscrossed in front of her, feigning shame, waiting for Koila to take the bait. The younger girl reached over and took Toni’s hand, “Bravery isn’t just fighting, it’s words, and presence. I appreciate you being there, many left long before the coup began.”
Her sleeping quarters weren’t far, by the time she turned the hallway towards them, she was practically dragging her feet.
“It doesn’t matter.” She crosses her arms across her chest, “It was a long time ago.”
Toni smiled sadly, “I worked in your dad’s political office. I got in the way of some revolutionaries while they were pillaging, during the coup.”
“It’s when you stick your tongue in.” Elle explained
She’d seen Eva talking to the young girls later that morning, and while she was drying off she heard giggles from behind her. No doubt, she’d convinced the girls to pull the prank.
“Hello?” She called out, the rustling stopped, “Hey, is someone there?”
Shwarma is just as delicous as Toni thought it would be. Or maybe it’s the rush of adreneline of almost dying or sending a trickster packing or all of the above. She doesn’t care because it’s offically added to her take out list.
“Now that you don’t have any family?”
“Why don’t you ask Francesca to tuck you in, she’d probably be just delighted to.” Mother slammed the door and Antoinette jumped back. Out of the corner of her eyes she saw Father and Francesca in his room, on top of each other, kissing.
The first punch was thrown, and Toni tasted blood, she spit out the slimy mixture and took a deep breath before going in for her own offense.
She looked back at Tania, whose face had turned red. Her hands awkwardly held each other in front. She wondered why a moment before she remembered her own appearance. Her long hair had been freed from it’s ponytail to wash any remaining soot, and she only had a flesh color bra on.
The monotony of living life during the day and working at night took its toll. She imagined this is what the Red Room might have felt like if she was alone and it was smaller. More claustrophobic if that was possible.
Koila jumped, “What are you doing!” She cried
Steve nearly missed Tony's quiet “me neither,” when Bucky came up the stairs with a breakfast from heaven.
“Okay, says here it’s one of your tentacle arms,” Bucky said, frowning at his phone screen.
“Bucky, google how octopuses pee, will you?” Steve held onto Tony’s upper body, trying to rub some warmth into his arms.
Steve smiled in relief, if Tony was joking again things weren’t as bad as they seemed.
“I feel seasick because I keep wobbling on these things and I need to pee but I don’t know how!” Tony sounded crestfallen, all but hanging onto Steve for support now.
“That was amazin’, doll,” Bucky praised him, running a hand through Tony’s curls.
Steve wanted to point out Tony still had two perfectly serviceable human hands to undress Steve with, but he knew his boyfriend would only take it as a challenge and not as the helpful advice it was meant to be. Looking at Tony concentrating hard, with that little frown between his brows and the tip of his tongue sticking out wasn’t a hardship, so Steve sat back and let his hands wander over the rough skin of the tentacles he could reach.
Buckaboo,” Steve heard him say softly.
“Bed, couch or floor,” Steve asked, feeling more than fine with any of the options if it meant they got undressed. Just about every room was well equipped with lube and towels because it was a question they encountered regularly. The tentacles retreated and they both looked to the side at Tony, who smiled at them.
“Well, I don't know what you look like, do I? Seein’ as you're acting like a fifteen year old who got dumped.” Bucky yelled back.
“That there’s no cure…”
“It really was,” Steve agreed. “... But did you have to point it at the curtains, Buck?”
“It’s only temporary,” Tony exclaimed, his eyes bright with happiness. “It’ll last as long as the full moon, which should be in…” he looked at Bucky’s laptop, “about four hours.”
Steve turned the other way to look at Bucky what had gotten Tony so excited and startled. The suckers had left an imprint, perfectly circular marks in a broad line across Bucky's shoulders.
“How do you want us?” Bucky asked Tony, kissing along his jaw. Steve didn’t wait for an answer, but pulled off his clothes in a few swift movements. He knew whatever Tony came up with was gonna be good. He stroked himself as he watched Bucky torment Tony with his tongue and teeth. When he lubed up his hand and reached lower, to prepare himself, Tony batted his hand away with a tentacle.
“Tentacles.” Bucky’s confirmation sounded casual, but the way his hand shook as he brought his coffee cup to his mouth belied the calmness of his voice.
Nodding miserably Tony climbed onto his lap, and, oh, okay, that was… that was really nice, with all the wriggling and the suction things that held onto the fabric of his overalls. He wondered how it would-- no! Tony needed to pee, this sounded like a thing they could find out together.
hightailing it outta the room.”
“Thanks Tony.” Steve popped two pills in his mouth and dry-swallowed them, shuddering at the awful taste.
Another big thank you to
“Let me.”
“Shh, don’t worry, sweetheart. We’ll eat you when you’re back to human, how does that sound?” Steve tried to put Tony at ease. The way the tentacles moved and glimmered in the light did
“Geez, doll,” Bucky breathed when Steve sucked the tentacle in, letting his tongue play around the suckers. Tony looked at him wide eyed, biting his lower lip which meant he was trying to keep silent. Steve briefly closed his eyes when Bucky tangled his fingers in his hair, guiding Steve’s movements.
“Alright. You go down and make us breakfast. I'll stay here and keep Tony company.” Steve gave Bucky a hand to help him up and hugged him before taking his place against the door. “It'll be okay, you’ll see. And don’t bother coming back without grease and caffeine.”
It took some doing to get Tony situated in the tub. Steve got soaked in the process, but the happy, relieved smile Tony gave him when he finally felt his bladder, that was somehow still in the human part of his body, empty was worth every inch of the trouble.
Another year, another birthday of my lovely friend Selena, and another chapter of tentacle shenanigans.
“Tony, sweet thing, you know we don’t care how many limbs you have, as long as you’re okay?” He said carefully.
He reached out for another piece of bacon when suddenly it hit him with the force of a heavy truck, or a tsunami, to stay with the nautical theme.
“Just run the damn bath so I can take a leak and have breakfast. That bacon over there is taunting me. And where is my coffee?”
themselves to his skin and Steve gasped.
Tony whimpered and Steve shook the lethargy of post orgasmic chill off long enough to pull Tony into his lap again, the underside of the tentacles soft and warm against his heated flesh. All three of them would need a bath after this, but Steve didn’t care when Tony was so warm and pliant and smelled so nice, like a day at the beach.
“Greek,” came from the other side of the door.
“Maybe that’s never, Steve. What if it’s never?”
“Not sure why you’re hell bent on this dumb shit, but whatever. Go ahead, do the incantation.”
“I kinda see the perks of this now,” Tony shrugged and wiggled two tentacles while he used two others to unfasten the clips of his bra, clearly showing off.
“I need to sit,” he moaned, his knees wobbling when another upstroke rubbed the underside of his cock just right.
He was wrong.
The tentacle fell limp and Tony’s whole body slumped in exhaustion, as he lay panting against Steve’s chest.
Together they managed to get Tony down the stairs without incident. The way the tentacles rippled and moved was more than a little fascinating, but Steve was too worried Tony might take a tumble to pay it too much attention. Tony was a fast learner though and he hobbled down without a hitch.
Across the hall he noticed Bucky falling into the same state of shock, but the other man recovered quicker than Steve. Maybe because he’d seen part of Tony already.
from your
to Steve, and Steve wanted to do things to his boyfriends rather sooner than later, but Tony’s shoulders drooped.
Steve felt a bit silly asking this like they were back in high school, especially since Bucky was quite clearly being fondled, but Steve didn’t know what the proper protocol was if your boyfriend’s accidental cephalopod-ness turned you on; his ma had raised a polite man after all.
“Stevie, thank God, maybe you can talk some sense into him. He's been holed up in there for hours.”
“We love you no matter how many appendages you have, you know that, right?” Steve asked as earnestly as he could, looking deep in Tony’s eyes. It was imperative to him Tony knew this. Tony was gorgeous to him no matter how he looked.
The look Bucky shot him was part annoyance and part something else entirely. “Look, I was convinced it was some kind of drunken hallucination thing? Like, how everyone looks prettier when you’re drunk, only with more limbs? But why the hell would Tony be in the bathroom for, what time was it again, six hours if there wasn’t something fishy going on?” Bucky said as he waved a piece of toast at Steve.
“This is the hottest fuckin’ thing ever,” Bucky whispered and Steve had to agree, smiling against Bucky's lips when Tony giggled.
Bucky nods numbly his hand inching up Tony’s arm until he’s met with the rolled-up sleeve. Then it seems Bucky gets enamored with the fabric and the feel of it as he pinches and rubs his index and thumb against it.
“You don’t remember me, do you?”
“What- why me? Who are you?”
the storm? We just fought and lost to Thanos. Maybe the universe is giving us a break.”
So, Steve would memorize things as soon as he’d seen them he’d commit the image to memory. Then he’d hold onto it until he got to a paper and a pen. Sometimes he’d even draw it on his skin if he was desperate enough.
“I agree.” Natasha knocks on her widow bites making sure they still work and smiles down at the electoral whirr they give in response. Rocket cocks his gun and smiles.
“I’m sorry we?”
“He says you ask too many questions.” You repeat to Tony, and the man rolls his eyes.
“I can’t just wander aimlessly around this time of night. I’ll be seen, or get mugged.” Tony isn’t sure which he’d prefer more. Actually, he does know. He’d rather get mugged than be recognized and found. Mugging is way better.
Bucky didn’t feel right leaving Steve at home with him looking so depressed, but he didn’t have a choice he couldn’t call off this late. Not if he didn’t want Fury to fire him. With Brock back, that was almost guaranteed, although if he worked earlier he wouldn’t be working tonight.
Thanos snapped his finger and she felt the power in her body bubble up like boiling water right before she felt it spread in all directions across the universe. At that moment she knew, that it was now or never. She directed Thanos’ power, one last strain of rebellion and pulled all that energy back inside of her, taking all the souls of those who Thanos erased and pulling them inside the Soul Stone.
It’s not like he could wait to be saved either. If everyone here died… then Thanos no doubt killed half of everyone everywhere like he planned. Tony didn’t even want to think about who else is on that death count he knew.
“And… that’s the last piece. I think we’re all set.” Valkyrie declares, stepping back to look at her ship. “Beautiful.” She murmurs. Patting the exterior gently as if it were a kitten. “All we need to do is fuel her up, and we’ll be ready to go.”
“I’m not okay.” Tony says, voice barely louder than before. But Bucky catches it all the same.
“I um- I’m fine.” Except Tony’s not fine, he hasn’t been fine for years. His mind is a prison and his emotions are unpredictable and uncontrollable. He hates that he has to live with it, but the idea of making Steve or Bucky live with it? No, that’s horrible.
“That doesn’t sound good,” Bucky mutters, Tony barely has to hold back and eye roll, he almost forgot he’s not talking to Rhody or Pepper. They don’t yet know things tend to explode when Tony’s involved.
Tony looks, and it does, in fact, say that. “Huh. Since when did my father share his projects? Or at least publicly claim he had help?”
The sound of the T.V playing low pulls his attention. He stands, making his way to the living room. Steve sits on the couch sketchbook in hand drawing.
“What else could I have accidentally done?”
Steve and Bucky do their best to place them in the flasks. Tony’s smile only widens once they settle and he moves to place them on the marble countertop. He gently pets the petals smiling at them. He looks back up to see them standing in the doorway and he chuckles.
You roll your eyes. “Not my orders. You can thank Strange for that.”
“No, I’m fine. I… Everyone is safe. That's what matters.”
“Really? It doesn’t scare you or freak you out? You don’t think it’s weird?”
When he finally hits the ground everything fluffy, bright and beautiful is gone. Nothing but darkness and ice layer the world, still covered in blood, now drying and brown, light flashes, a blinker, yellow. On and off, over and over, with an errie click. He looks up, a car crashed.
Thanks everyone for commenting and being patient it keeps me motivated. Updates will be very slow for the next week or two. I'm sorry.
The night his parents died.
“Yeah, Buck.” He chuckles breathlessly. “We share the same soulmate.” Mind still trying to wrap itself around that fact. He’d heard of sharing a soulmate before. But it’s super rare. They would talk about it in school, he was sure the last known double soul-bond was over seventy years ago or something. Maybe he’ll look it up later.
As you do, your skin stings and burns. Your vision blurs until everything goes black.
“I- I’m sorry.” Steve begins to say, but Bucky throws his metal hand up into view and cuts him off.
He’s so concentrated on the task. He doesn’t notice you until you’re right in front of him. Looking at the stones. Each a different color. Green and Yellow, you need to grab the green and the yellow.
Why did you getting hurt need to happen? What else is he not telling you?
“What…” You start to say, but then shake your head. “I- I’m alive?” You ask.
“Do you like it?” He asks hesitantly. “I didn’t actually see him shirtless, or the soul-marks.” He mumbles. “I didn’t see him smile either. A lot of it is me imagining and guessing. Did I get your mark right?” Bucky smiles and looks up at Steve with a hint of disbelief.
"It feels like I'm fondling you with twenty fingers at once," Tony said in wonder, reaching out to mark Bucky's front as well.
Downstairs Bucky had made Tony his favourite breakfast, and pulled up the armchair next to the table because the regular chairs were too small now. With the tentacles hidden underneath the table breakfast felt almost normal. Except for them still wearing their Halloween costumes and smelling like an old bar. Steve kinda like the bra thing on Tony though.
“This already is the fun part.” Though Steve had to agree there was more fun to be had.
Steve felt his cheeks colour as the tip worked its way even higher, tickling the skin of his inner thigh until it couldn't fit any further. Steve's gaze flicked from Tony who pretended to eat to hide his grin, to Bucky who looked in awe at their boyfriend, licking his lips. Seemed like Tony was learning fine motor skills with his tentacles awfully fast.
“I don’t know, which is the fun part, Buckaroo, live a little.”
“Why? I don't understand what's going on.” Steve felt himself get angry with powerlessness. He understood why Bucky snapped if he tried to talk Tony out of the bathroom for hours. Getting angry would only make Tony get defensive however, and make him stay in there who knew how long.
Steve knew this could only spell trouble with a capital T, but he was too sore and probably still drunk because the logic of why this would be bad eluded him at the moment. His groan was too weak to be heard above the Greek that now came from Tony’s mouth like he was born on mount Olympus, and when he tried to move, the world, or his brain, or both spun so hard he very purposefully stayed as still as possible. Whatever was about to happen couldn’t be any worse than how he felt right now, he thought, right before he passed out again.
As he sat up the headache didn’t get worse, and he didn’t feel the need to run to the toilet to barf. Drinking water for the win! He would never do shots again though. He vaguely remembered someone dressed as a sexy zombie challenging him to a shots duel, and well, he never backed down from a challenge, did he? What followed was a haze. He thought Tony and Bucky had carried him home between them. He knew he’d had two liters of water before going to sleep and yeah, that was what had woken him.
“... Wow,” Tony observed when he caught his breath again.
They smiled at each other, until Tony looked away shyly. “Thank you, Steve,” he said softly.
“You mean those scribbles on that dirty napkin over there?”
“Wanna tell me what’s going on?” Steve leaned back again, trying to get comfortable.
"Give us more." Steve turned to sit on his heels and tapped his chest. "Here."
Even after the marking, Steve wasn’t prepared for that first teasing feel of his hole. The tip of the tentacle was a little bigger than the finger of a human hand, but more flexible, and it easily passed his rim. He gasped, just like Bucky next to him, and again when a second tentacle ever so gently fondled his balls.
When Steve woke everything was quiet. Too quiet. More like an absence of sound than true tranquility. There should’ve been snoring, for instance. Maybe the prittle prattle of a coffee machine or the running of the shower. Instead there was nothing, and the unease this caused made Steve wake up faster than he would’ve liked. At least the world didn’t spin anymore when he tried to move.
“Hey, stop it. I don’t peek under your robe, do I?” Tony batted Bucky’s hand away with a human hand and slithered off Steve’s lap.
coursing through him like there was a straight connection from his nipple to his cock.
“Can't let you see me like this,” Tony countered.
“Come here, sweet thing.” He held open his arms and watched fascinated how Tony used four of the tentacles to move himself from his chair to Steve’s lap. As soon as he was settled Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist, at the border where his human skin transformed into a rougher texture.
“What exactly happened last night?”
Steve hummed and smiled around the hectocotylus and pulled off to lick along the groove (which was starting to taste salty), making Tony shudder again.
Tony bent forward to peer at the screen, back at his book and at the screen again, then flung the book to the side to hug Bucky. “
“Stop making fun of this!” Tony yelled. “I’m disgusting! I’m abominable and scared and how the hell did this happen and what if it never goes away? Am I to be a monster of the deep for the rest of my life? What about my job? What about going outside? You can’t put a little concealer on eight fucking tentacles!” In his anger Tony had opened the door and stood panting in the doorway, really close to where Steve held a bite of bacon midair, frozen in shock.
“You got me flowers?”
“I’m not sure this is going to make you angrier or not, but I lost the kid.” Tony can hear the sound of porcelain breaking as Steve slams his shirt back into the water so fast it breaks the sink. Steve just leaves it and darts into the living room.
Tony: Yeah? Didn't think you'd text me this soon. Isn't there a three-day rule or something?
The confused looks on Steve and Bucky faces were almost identical.
“Then you’ve got until he wakes up to figure something out Stevie. Don’t get so down about it. This was weird, strange and sudden. Wait ‘till we get some balance and real connection before you start freaking out on me.”
The school couldn’t kick her out, because her father funded most of the programs, but they didn’t do a thing to make her life better.
It was a month before she was assigned an assassination. A rising politician wasn’t respecting the powers that be, and he’d have to be silenced.
“Fuck!” He heard someone cry, he fell to the ground, paper flew everywhere.
“Steve please.” It’s the first time she really heard him speak, there was no sound in the stage because they’d had so little time to set it up they couldn’t even bug it.
She’d arrived at the school late that afternoon, around five, and when she left Sasha and Van’s room at eight she dreaded the reaction to her real identity, let alone the next three years she’d have to spend with them.
Tania spent her practice time knotting Toni’s laces, or pulling down her skirt when she wasn’t looking. Toni spent her practice time practicing, which showed whenever they actually performed.

“Did I what?”
“Well no. But she refused to get Mila help, and she was very cruel and unsportsmanlike, and I don’t think that behavior should be rewarded so-”
“No. They were all killed in the crash, and police found no ties to known terror groups. They were just crazy. Probably weren’t even targeting me.”
“A little gratitude would be appropriate.” Madame said, smiling. But it was a thinly veiled threat. She’d gotten too comfortable. She knew she was good, but good wasn’t enough. She could just be successful on missions, she needed to be perfect in the mansion too.
“Okay, you’ve got my attention. What do you need?”
