"Of course you didn't. You just found out, Tony. You literally haven't even left the room and your phone is sitting on the coffee table. How would you have told him?"
Alpha. Steve was sweet and caring and didn't complain even once when Tony was needy and whiny and clingy. He rushed to fulfill every demand that Tony made, was desperate to please him, to make him feel good, and melted anytime Tony purred.
Brock nodded, fitting the pieces together. He hoped he was wrong, because he had a feeling that if he was right that Steve might not ever get that call he was hoping to get. Brock didn't say anything about it, because he didn't want to worry Steve, but it seemed like too much of a coincidence.
He wasn't drinking right now, well, not much. He had a couple of beers, but that was nothing. Just a little something to take the edge off before he went to re-meet Brock's new mate. Tony sighed, took one last look at his disheveled appearance and flinched away from it, grabbing his jacket off the back of the couch before heading out.
"Okay, then, pretty Alpha. You want to play, then let's play," Tony said, coming as close to a growl as an Omega could.
Tony cut off his recounting of how Bucky defended his honor and then Tony got all upset, because he could totally handle himself and he did not need an Alpha to swoop in and save him, when Clint set down Brock's beer and pulled him in for a kiss. Brock didn't stop him immediately, but he pulled back with a groan after a few moments.
There was a beat of silence where Steve realized what he said and Tony's heart froze, before speeding up until he thought it might burst out of his chest.
"Steve, stop, you can't think like that. You'll tear yourself apart if you keep thinking those kinds of thoughts. There's nothing wrong with the way you are and someday you'll meet someone who doesn't care about that."
"Yeah, yeah. I know how it goes. You saw him and felt compelled to drop to your knees and present for him and the moment he knotted and claimed you, you felt whole, like the piece inside of you that was missing suddenly was filled by your Alpha's presence and bite and his knot and let's not forget his life giving cum," Tony said sarcastically. "Yeah, I've heard the stories."
"How old are you even?" Tony blurted out, feeling awkward and uncertain in a way that he hated feeling. He was so not used to the warm feeling inside of him or the desire to go to Steve and touch him and be held close.
Tony always said that he hated Alphas and never wanted one, but the truth was that he hated how much he wanted one. Tony didn't want to be controlled and have his independence stolen from him. He was terrified that he'd find his soulmate and they'd turn out to be some sort of asshole Alpha that wanted him to drop his whole life and be some damn houseOmega.
to do all of that for my Omega. I just know it. It doesn't matter that I like to get off while fingering myself. That won't matter once I have an Omega. I won't need to do that anymore, because I'll have my soulmate to get me off and even if I can't always get off that'd be fine. It won't be about me. It will be about them and when they need me to knot them I will. I'll make it happen no matter what."
"Never," Steve whispered, like a secret whispered softly into the night, just for the two of them to hear. "I'll never leave you, Tony."
"Hey, don't think like that. You are a real Alpha. I don't care what others say. Alphas don't have to be domineering and controlling."
"Sorry, angel, but I'm taken," Brock said regretfully, pulling down his collar to show off a mark that definitely had not existed when he went out last night.
All the chapters in this series are short (between 1-3k words), but all three parts are fully written and I will be updating it on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, since the chapters are so short.
Tony whined as he fumbled with his phone, pulling it out of his pocket. His hands were trembling and he could barely unlock it before he was cramping up again and his phone slipped from his grasp, clattering to the floor, his arms wrapping around himself.
Steve was still pouting when they went to bed that night, Harley curled up in between them. Tony really didn't think he would be so hurt by the comment, since in many ways Steve didn't seem like an Alpha. Sure, he was protective and he had a knot, but for the most part he acted more like an Omega, at least when it was just the two of them.
The pace of this story is so quick compared to tempting, then again this one is much shorter so it makes sense. Still I love it and Stony is like so sugary sweet in the next chapter.
Steve's tip felt hot on his hole, delicious as it pressed inside and the stretch was heavenly. Tony's eyes fluttered shut when Steve was fully seated and so did Steve's. Steve knew he should probably stop, but he’d never felt anything like this before, the way Tony felt all tight and hot wrapped around his dick. His hips stuttered forward, trying to push in even deeper. Tony moaned, rolling his hips, a gasp falling off his parted lips.
Which is why Brock called up Tony the moment Steve left. Tony was still ignoring him though and Brock groaned.
No matter how much Brock promised Tony that he wasn't leaving him alone, that they were still best friends and Tony could come visit him anytime he wanted, Tony didn't believe him. He couldn't believe that things wouldn't change. Of course things would change. Everything would change and Tony hated change.
. He had opinions and dreams and no intention of letting anyone else tell him how to live his life, but those weren't the kinds of things that most Alphas wanted in a mate.
"Tony... I'm sorry, but I knew you were going to be stubborn about this. You told me that you regret not calling him. This is your chance to get to know him. You might like him if you give him a chance."
Tears pricked at Tony's eyes. He wasn't worried about not liking Steve, well, he was worried about that. Mostly though he was worried about falling too hard, too fast, only to be rejected. He wasn't the kind of Omega to just submit and say
Steve nodded, licking his lips and considering how to say what he wanted to say in a way that wouldn't offend Tony.
"Steve's gonna be here so soon, Tony," Bucky promised, sitting down next to him on the shabby second hand couch.
"Well, I was actually gonna tell you about this, but we've just been so caught up in our own little bubble and I didn't want to burst it by bringing up legal stuff. Besides, I almost forgot about it with all the newly mated hormones rushing through me," Tony rambled.
Steve blinked at him in surprise before smiling softly. He didn't want to assume that Tony was comfortable enough with him to use a nickname, but it touched Steve to know that his Omega was trying. Tony wanted to give this a try even if he was worried about it and that was enough for Steve. He would be the best Alpha ever, because he would be exactly what Tony needed him to be. He knew already that he'd give Tony anything he wanted and he'd try his best to be whatever Tony wanted him to be.
Bucky stiffened when Tony climbed into his lap and his breathing picked up. This was the closest to Tony he'd ever been and the Omega was scenting so pretty. Bucky had to swallow down a growl and clench his fist to keep from touching him. Steve showed up in record time, driving over the speed limit to get there. Pietro pointed him in the direction of the break room and Steve burst in, heading over to Tony immediately.
Ever since then Sam had taken to mentoring the kid, supporting him when his asshole father only seemed to tear him down. Maybe it was Sam's fault that Steve had such unrealistic expectations about life and soulmates and happy ever afters. Sam had made a point of telling the kid, who had been so scared and broken when he first met him, that he could do anything he set his mind to and he could have anything that he dreamed of. Sam didn't regret building up his self-confidence, he just hoped the world didn't let the boy down.
Tony wasn't sure how long he laid there, but he must have fallen asleep on the couch at some point, because he woke up to the sound of a key turning in the lock. Tony groaned, cursing and stumbling off the couch, clutching at his head when it protested the sudden movement, and rushing to the bathroom. Brock saw the empty bottle on the ground by the couch when he opened the door, told his Alpha to wait in the living room and headed off to find Tony.
When Steve's knot finally popped, Tony sighed in relief, feeling like he was exactly where he belonged. His arms wrapped around Steve's neck and his legs wrapped themselves around his lower back, holding him close.
"Hate to ruin the moment, but I've got wine," Bucky said handing a glass to Steve before reaching for a glass on the counter, "and for you--"
Thank God it was late and there was barely anyone on the roads, because Steve was certain that they would have gotten into an accident otherwise. It was damn near impossible for him to focus on anything but Tony, the feel of his hand accompanied by his teasing words. Steve drove slow though and they made it back to his place in one piece.
"Steve," Tony whined, sounding more like he was calling out for his Alpha than like he was telling the name to Bucky.
There was an amused smile on Tony's face, but he was looking at Steve, worried about his reaction. Steve was furious, but not at Tony. He knew that Obie was an asshole, but he had no idea just how bad it really was.
"I'm sorry, what? You're joking, right?" Tony said in disbelief. "Are you telling me that you have hundreds of thousands of dollars just lying around?"
be. I know that babies are like miracles and all that, but I never thought I'd have one. I never thought I'd have an Alpha and now I do, and now this. It's just a lot and I'm not sure if I'm ready. I'm not sure if I
Steve started the engine again and Tony unbuckled his pants, pulling Steve's dick out. When Steve pulled away from the curb Tony started to stroke him, spitting on his hand to slick his way.
"Eyes on the road, Alpha, or I'm gonna have to stop," Tony said with a pout. "And we both know you don't want that."
The baby didn't respond of course, still happily suckling at Tony's flat chest, but he did look up at his mom like he was aware of what Tony was talking about. Tony smiled softly at him and brushed a finger over his cheek.
"Yeah, I know, but I'm still anxious about it and I'm not entirely sure why. I know it's ridiculous and I know Steve's gonna be thrilled."
"Steve's gonna be a great co-owner and let me do whatever I want with the place, so I suggest you kiss up to me, if there's anything specific you want out of the renovations," Tony teased. "Steve will also be very busy raising our child and being a work-from-home dad while he paints and helps manage the bar.
Sam was older by nearly twenty years and had far more life experience than Steve did, but Sam also had a soft spot for the kid. It was probably depressing to admit that his best friend was a kid that still believed in dreams coming true, but it was true. Sam met Steve when the teen started volunteering at a homeless shelter that catered to vets who hadn't received the support they needed when they came home.
Steve wasn't sure if he was upset or excited, but then Tony was wrapping his arms around his neck and kissing him.
For the first time in a long time, Sam felt like maybe dreams really could come true. His soulmate - even thinking the word made Sam feel all fuzzy - went to talk to his best friend, so naturally Sam had taken the opportunity to go see his own best friend.
Steve tried to take a deep breath, tried to calm down like his Omega told him to, but it didn't do much to alleviate his anger.
He showed up on Brock's doorstep and was relieved when it was Brock who opened the apartment door. Brock was grinning, but it faltered slightly when he saw Tony.
He didn't know Steve, so he had no way of knowing, not that he really thought Tony would put up with that kind of shit. Even strong headed people like Tony could end up in abusive relationships though.
"There you go, pretty Alpha. Such a good boy you are, Alpha," Tony purred. "I'm sorry that I upset you, but you don't get to just pout about it. If there's something wrong you have to tell me. You don't get to keep things from me, Alpha, because you're mine. You understand?"
Now here they were and Tony wanted him, wanted to use him, and Steve was in heaven. There was nothing that he wanted more than to please Tony, to be used by him, to be ordered around by his pretty little Omega.
Tony immediately nuzzled up against Steve, his entire body relaxing, recognizing that its Alpha was here now. Suddenly all was well with the world. Steve didn't have any personal experience with an Omega in heat, but he did know that the moment of relief wouldn't last long. He eyed Bucky, his eyes raking up and down him and Bucky dropped his gaze, not wanting to appear as a threat to the other Alpha.
Steve being so young and naive and just wanting to be a good Alpha is so cute and so is the way he's listening to Sam's story like a child listening to a fairytale and wishing for their own happily ever after.
Tony narrowed his eyes at him, but Steve sighed dreamily and nodded, pulling him close and scenting him. Tony just melted into his arms, wrapping his own arms around his neck and standing up on his tiptoes to press a kiss to his lips.
Tony didn't sleep well when he was alone, but even when he wasn't and he did fall asleep instead of tossing and turning restlessly before giving up and going for a cup of coffee, Tony didn't sleep more then five hours tops unless he was passed out drunk. So maybe that's one of the reasons that he drinks so much.
"No, I'm setting up the nursery and Brock's gonna help me since he's also pregnant and we're gonna have matching nurseries."
Bucky helped Tony up off the ground and into the break room. He then went to talk to Pietro who was working the bar and told him to call his sister, Wanda, in to cover the rest of Tony’s shift. When he returned to the break room Tony was curled in on himself, but he reached out for Bucky when he saw him.
Brock and Tony were rolling around on the ground now, trying to pin each other to the ground and making very dramatic declarations about fighting for their honor and the honor of their people.
Tony grabbed Steve's hand and tugged him down the hall and into the bathroom. Steve shifted awkwardly on his feet and Tony hopped up on the counter.
After that they saw each other almost everyday. When they weren't together they were texting or talking on the phone and at night there seemed to always be phone sex, until Tony suggested that he wanted to see Steve, then suddenly they were getting off over Zoom. It was overwhelming to Tony just how quickly his entire life seemed to revolve around Steve and yet it wasn't nearly enough.
I'd like to think that if he hadn't been having such a bad day and been in such a bad mood when they met that they would have had more of the fairytale kind of meeting and he would have called Steve as soon as he got off work
"Okay, if it's really what you want then I'll support it and be happy for you. I'll support you no matter what choice you make, you know that right?"
Steve swallowed hard, groaning. His eyes flickered down to watch Tony's hand moving and Tony's eyes flickered up to meet his.
"I'm just kidding, Alpha. We'll wait until I stop breastfeeding this little guy and then we can try for another one. Until then, I'm going on the pill."
Tony rolled his eyes, but despite all their bickering and play fighting, they still ended up curled up together on the couch while they watched 'The Rocky Horror Show'. Afterwards Steve scooped up a passed out Tony into his arms, cradling his head to his shoulder and Sam scooped up Brock. Brock scrunched up his nose, grumbled something about not liking gremlins, before snuggling up to his Alpha. Steve and Sam shared a fond look that clearly portrayed just how in love with their Omegas they were.
Lol I love how Tony is like fuck you're so young, but he also kinda loves having that advantage over a Steve by being more experienced. Steve feeling like he's being rejected when Tony walks out and then again when Tony's like we have to talk is honestly so sad, but his Omega wants to be in control him and Steve is so into it. They're perfect for each other.
Steve glared at him, but there wasn't any heat in it. If anything he was just really embarrassed and
"Yeah, I mean, Tony, I'd do anything for you. So if you want a bar then I'll buy you a bar. It's no big deal."
"Stupid, stupid Omega," Brock teased. "Why would you do that? You can't hate Alphas so much that you'd throw away what is potentially your only chance at happiness?"
Tony tried not to think about how young and naive Steve was. He didn't want to admit that a part of him was thrilled to be more experienced, to be the one teaching his Alpha about pleasure. It was pretty obvious that Steve had no experience, because when Tony kissed him Steve had no idea what he was doing. He had no rhythm and he clearly didn't know what to do with his tongue when Tony licked at his lips and dove inside his mouth. Tony thought it was cute though. Steve squirmed and whimpered, his blush spreading down his neck, and Tony ate it all up.
"You're sweet, but no, I'm good. If I take you with me I'm just gonna end up fucking you in the break room and then the manager is gonna be an asshole about it."
They texted back and forth as they headed to their separate locations and Steve told Tony the moment he got home. Tony told Steve when he got home, too, and Steve felt like he was going to melt into a puddle on the floor of his apartment. He was desperately in love with Tony and really that wasn't a shock. That's just the way it was supposed to be with soulmates.
They've met, but it did not go well and Steve does not realize that. Poor baby is expecting a phone call that will never come. Poor Tony too cuz he definitely regrets throwing out that phone number lol
"I can't believe you found your soulmate!" Steve said. "What was it like? Did you know the moment you met his eyes just like in the stories?"
Tony wasn't stupid though. He knew he had upset him and he sighed when Steve kept peering at him through his lashes, a pout on his lips, looking away anytime Tony looked his way.
Poor Tony! He's so lonely and just wants to be loved, but he's terrified of it too and honestly putting yourself out there and trusting someone else to catch you when you fall is terrifying.
Okay I just added knotting to the tags, which I thought I had already added. It's not like explicit but it definitely happens
Tony knew exactly what was happening, even though it had never felt this bad before, at least not so quickly. This was so sudden, the awful cramps, the heat coursing through his body, the slick pooling in his underwear. This was his body's way of demanding a knot when it knew it had one available, when it knew that its soulmate would come and provide exactly what it needed.
Brock grumbled about damn early morning people and refilled the coffee cup before joining in on the conversation.
"Or maybe she chose you for me. Ever thought that maybe it's not the Alpha that owns the Omega, but the Omega that owns the Alpha?" Tony snarked.
"Whatever you want, pretty Omega. I'll give you whatever you want," Steve promised, pulling out his fingers.
"I have no complaints there, but you do realize he's only gonna stay a baby for like one maybe two years max."
Steve being so cautious and not wanting to step on Tony's toes, but still wanting to support him and give him everything that he wants and offer him the world is just so sweet
"You're what? Ten years younger than me?" Tony said, shaking his head in disbelief. "You're practically still a pup. I can't date you."
"Ah-ha!" Tony shouted victoriously when he managed to pin Brock down. "I have conquered you, evil sorcerer!"
Steve drove much more carefully as he headed to Tony's place, calling Brock first to get the address since Tony wouldn't say more than
"I mean, not literally. It's all in the bank. Most of it's in my savings account since it earns more interest that way-"
"Maybe not, but that doesn't mean everyone likes that. Maybe he could sense it and just knew that I could never be what he really wanted from an Alpha."
Tony rolled his eyes at him, pulling away to plop down on the couch and kicking his shoes off. Steve shook his head in amusement, shutting the door and grabbing Tony's shoes to place on the shoe rack, before heading off to the kitchen to fetch some coffee for his spoiled Omega. Steve made pancakes, too, and all of his domestic work was made worth it when Tony smiled at him and murmured
an Alpha, but he kinda wanted one. Wanted someone to hold onto, someone to cuddle with and be close to when the night fell and the darkness of his mind crept in like the shadows that surrounded them. Tony wished there was somebody there to pull him out of his mind as he spiraled, laying on the couch, an empty bottle on the ground. He was numb and yet he hurt so much. How was that even possible?
Steve nodded, hesitating only briefly before running a hand down Tony's spine. Tony shivered, rubbing his face against Steve's pecs which were remarkably soft for how ridiculously defined they were.
Sam grinned stupidly, sighing and falling back on the couch, his legs over the arm and his head in Steve's lap.
Tony couldn't help the blush on his cheeks and the grin on his lips, but he hid his face in Steve's chest so his Alpha wouldn't see.
"You're gonna be the most spoiled, loved, happiest baby in the world Harley. I promise," Tony murmured.
"Good. You're so good for me, Alpha. I didn't mean to upset you and I shouldn't have teased you like that. It was mean. Can you forgive me?"
"We-" He said, gesturing between him and Steve, "Are buying the bar. This way we can all keep our jobs, have decent fucking pay checks, get the benefits we deserve, and just overall have a positive work environment. Sound good?"
"Tony, I've spent time with Steve and he's literally the softest Alpha I've ever met, and I'm mated to Sam so that's really saying something. My Alpha is totally wrapped around my finger."
"I know what I said!" Tony snapped. "Don't use my own words against me. I confided in you and you used it against me."
"He's coming over to help me move my stuff in the morning," Brock admitted. "Don't worry though. I'll pay rent as many months as it takes until you find someone new. It's just, well, you know how it is with soulmates. I don't think I'd be able to sleep without him."
"No, I'll do it every day until we die, because I love you more than anything in the world and I'd do anything for you, Tony, my beautiful Omega.”
"Tony you are the farthest thing from stupid," Brock told him, but then he smirked. "Though you do stupid shit constantly, so maybe you are pretty stupid."
"I know you'll be a great Alpha, Steve, but you know you don't have to change who you are. Your soulmate will love you just the way you are and if they don't then they don't deserve you."
"Thank you, Alpha. That means a lot, and I mean, there's no guarantee that the next person who buys the place will be any better than Pierce, or that they will hire us all on again. There's really no guarantee anybody will buy the place anytime soon. Realistically, it'll probably be bulldozed and turned into a parking lot for the diner next door or something like that. We all know that we're probably gonna lose our jobs, but it's worth it to do the right thing and put Pierce behind bars."
Tony had never told him he couldn't touch himself, so he hadn't even thought to ask permission first. Tony giggled and Steve loved the sound of it right in his ear. He groaned, his hand squeezing his base, applying pressure to try and find some kind of relief to the sheer amount of horny this Omega was inflicting upon him.
Steve whimpered, tugging down his sweats and boxers until his dick sprang free. Tony was already wet and open when Steve undressed him, his body preparing itself to take his Alpha's knot, but Steve still pressed a finger experimentally into him, moaning at the way Tony clenched around him.
, the eighteen year old artist and former virgin until I seduced your ass Alpha, has a lot of money?" Tony asked him, clearly amused and not believing him one bit. "Tell me, pretty boy, what do you consider a lot of money? The twenty dollar allowance your mommy gives every Saturday?"
"Honestly, it's inevitable. I went to the hair salon yesterday and my hairdresser told me that Jessica, some girl that lives in her apartment that I don't even know, was having an affair with her current lover's ex-lover, not to mention she's married with three kids. I spilled my guts the moment Sam got home. Keeping things from mates is practically impossible."
"I'm saying that she saw some of my work, loved it, and put it up in her galleries. I've only sold a handful, but I've made a lot of money. Your bar is not that great, no offense, and I don't really spend much of my money other than for, like, rent and groceries, so there's a lot of it just sitting around. We could probably just buy the bar. That is if you want to be an owner of a bar."
Tony refused to sit on his own, so he sat in Steve's lap instead and let his Alpha feed him, stealing kisses in between bites and cooing at his Omega. Tony just purred, scenting so pretty, like newly mated Omegas always did. He smelled of sweat and sex and Alpha, and Steve couldn't get enough of it. Steve was just as lost on Tony as Tony was lost on Steve.
Realistically, there should have been more employees. Obie was just cheap and refused to hire any more people than was strictly necessary to keep the place running, even if it would run much smoother with a bigger staff. They did have three part timers, twins that attended the local college and Thor, an older Norwegian guy who was always in good spirits, that filled in the gaps in the schedule.
It was a cold day, windy and blustery with clouds hanging overhead that threatened to soak the inhabitants of the city as they walked down the street in large groups, pushing and shoving, each desperate to get where they're going before the rain ruined their hair or makeup. Tony was far less concerned and when the rain did come down and he was left with wet hair clinging to him and soaked clothes and a gloomy atmosphere that the rain couldn't wash away, well, he thought at least his hair wasn't sticking up all over the place.
"Yes! Oh my God, yes!" Tony squealed. "Fuck, you scared me there. I thought you were gonna say something awful, but I should have known you'd just say something charming and perfect."
Tony hummed in agreement, pulling the baby closer to sniff his head and take in that baby scent that seems to cling to all young pups. They were still just staring at their baby in awe when he started to cry and Tony's nipples started to leak, wet spots forming on his shirt.
"Oh my God. Oh my God! We're having a baby!" Steve practically shouted to the room in his excitement and scooped Tony up into his arms.
Steve swallowed hard and fidgeted nervously with the bottom of Tony's shirt when he didn't respond. Tony was just shocked and pretty sure he was dreaming.
Tony knew he was only teasing, but he still pulled away from Steve and shoved him off the couch. Brock gave him the most offended look from the floor.
"Hey, no, stop," Tony told him. "I love you so much, Alpha, but I don't want that. This was my battle to fight and I wasn't about to let you take that away from me. I've been dealing with this bullshit for years and now I'm finally changing things. You have to let me do this."
He definitely would not love whatever asshole Alpha had brainwashed his best friend, turning him into a knot loving, Alpha pleasing houseOmega.
to do this and I'll support you in this in any way that I can," Steve told him earnestly. "I know that this is your fight, Tony, and I would never take that away from you, but if you'll let me, I'd love to fight alongside you."
That was a big reason why Tony didn't want to find his soulmate. As much as he insisted it was because they would probably be an asshole and he didn't need someone to try and control him, the truth was that it was mostly because Tony was terrified of rejection. Terrified that he'd find his soulmate and they'd be perfect and then they'd realize just how much of a mess Tony was and run in the other direction.
"Yes, sir," Steve whispered, feeling breathless like Tony had reached inside his lungs and stole the air from him.
I will continue the m,w,f posting schedule through out the next two parts which are both already finished.
"He's perfect. Gorgeous dark eyes, dark curls, so tiny he's practically pocket size,” Steve said, clearly lost on the Omega he'd barely even spoken to.  “He's the prettiest Omega I've ever seen."
So Tony's preg and Steve's a very happy Alpha!! And he now has to rub Tony's feet for the rest of his life lol, not that Steve's gonna complain about it. No, seriously tho I love them sm
Bucky stood there for a moment longer, stunned by the news that Tony had an Alpha, but he swiped up the phone when Tony cried out in pain again.
Tony's lips were on his the moment the engine cut off. Steve had to carry him so they wouldn't just stumble over each other, and the moment the apartment door shut behind them Tony was tugging his pants down, just far enough to sink down on Steve's dick.
He paused, turning back, just the slightest of a blush on his cheeks, but something sincere in his eyes.
"I'm still an Alpha, you know. I know that I'm not like other Alphas, but I still have pride, Tony."
Bucky wasn't quite sure what to make of that and Steve wasn't quite sure what to make of Bucky, but he didn't have time to think too much about it.
"Yes, Steve. You were a virgin and the way we play goes against most all of your instincts, so it took some time for you to learn. There's nothing wrong with that. I'm a very experienced teacher and you learned quickly how to get me off, so no harm done."
Steve gasped when Tony's hand grasped him in between his legs and groped him through his pants. His face lit up bright red and Tony smirked at his blushing Alpha. He was so fucking sweet. Tony thought that maybe, just maybe, this could work out, but they were going to have to agree on one very important thing if there was going to be any chance of them mating.
Steve physically couldn't leave Tony right now, but he knew the Omega wasn't talking about that. Tony didn't want his Alpha to help him through his heat and then walk out on him. Steve nuzzled against him, careful to keep enough of his weight off of Tony that he wouldn't be uncomfortable, but still staying pressed close so Tony would feel secure.
"That's infinitely worse," Tony said, flinging his hands up in exasperation. "You do realize that right? That's so much worse."
He grabbed Tony's ankle and pulled his feet right out from under him. Tony tried to scramble away from him unsuccessfully, ended up on his stomach, and reached out for Steve, a pout on his lips.
"Yeah, I could do that, but not now. Sam and Brock are watching Harley this Friday and I'll take you apart then, okay, baby?"
Steve was miserable, but he still clung to the last shred of hope that maybe someday his soulmate would want him, would call him on the phone.
Steve was definitely heartbroken though. The feeling of rejection was steadily creeping up on him and threatening to consume him. He held it together pretty well that second week, but by the time the third week hit with no word from Tony, Steve was depressed and had completely given up on getting to have that happily ever after he wanted. He had also given up on showering, spent all day in bed but never seemed to sleep, and the only reason he hadn't starved was because Sam kept bringing him food.
"You didn't tell me you were coming," Tony accused, but he giggled when Brock scooped him off his feet and set him up on the bar.
"Tony? Are you okay?" Brock called out, knocking on the bathroom door after he checked his room and found it empty.
Thank God for Brock's meddling otherwise who knows what would have happened with Steve being so worried about offending Tony by showing up at his work and Tony insisting he'd run in the opposite direction lol
Also sex on a motorcycle... yup I have a real thing for that. While this is technically not sex, but I am actually gonna write a scene for tempting that has Bucky letting Steve warm his cock while he takes him for a ride on his bike
Brock was the only person who had ever stuck around. The only person who ever stayed, even though Tony got drunk more nights than not and his life was falling apart. When Brock was drafted Tony was heartbroken to lose him, alone and so scared of being on his own, so scared that Brock wouldn't ever come back, but Brock returned home, returned to Tony. Everything was right with the world again, because Tony was no longer alone.
Brock asked Tony how his shift's been going and Tony proceeded to tell him about the asshole customer that kept trying to feel him up and how Clint had just about jumped the counter to chase him out of here. Bucky had beat him to it, leaving the kitchen to yell at them for being creeps and throw them out. Even with only one arm their cook could be downright terrifying when he wanted to be.
For as miserable as Steve felt he still managed to pull himself together enough to get all cleaned up for the dinner that Sam and his Omega had invited him to. Brock had threatened to shove Steve into the shower himself if he showed up smelling like he hadn't showered in a week. Steve sure was glad that he'd showered and put on clean clothes when his soulmate showed up.
Tony was just staring at him, like he was having a hard time figuring out if this was just some elaborate joke or not.
"Nope, not joking," Tony told him with a grin, but a part of him was nervous that Steve would be unhappy about it.
to act like he had done you some great favor and made you work extra shifts to make up for it. He didn't even pay you overtime, even though he made you work like sixty hours."
"Good, we can get started on trying for the next one," Tony teased, taking the crying baby back and coaxing him to latch onto his nipple.
It turns out he could ignore him for a month though, because Tony was just too stubborn for his own good.
Tony licked his lips and jumped down and Steve stumbled backwards, caught off guard by how close they suddenly were. Tony just giggled and headed off to raid Brock's closet for dry clothes, running his fingers through his hair in an attempt to tame the mess of curls.
"If you don't get a release, Alpha, that's really not my problem, but if I don't get my release, then we're gonna have a real problem. So why don't you be a good boy and get some fingers inside of you? Open yourself up and make pretty sounds for me to get off on."
Steve swallowed and nodded, but truthfully, he had no fucking clue if he was okay or not. He was completely blindsided by the sudden appearance and then just as sudden disappearance of his soulmate and he had no clue how to feel about that. He thought devastated might be the right word, but then somehow that didn't seem like it fit at all. Steve felt like he was
Tony hadn't fucked either of them, but he had no qualms snuggling up to them while they were sweaty and cum was still leaking out of Clint. He also had no qualms with sleeping on the other side of the bed while they fucked, just so he wouldn't have to be alone at night. As much as Tony wanted to be fine on his own, he really hated being alone.
"Yeah, but next time I'm gonna make you do all the work and I'm just gonna lay there and be the pillow princess. Let my Alpha take care of me," Tony said, his fingers trailing down Steve's chest and a sultry pout on his lips. "You'd do that for me, wouldn't you, Alpha?"
Steve felt like shit when he peeled himself out of bed the next morning. He went through his morning routine, but he might as well have been a zombie. All he could think about was Tony and how he hadn't said I love you back. Steve was startled out of his stupor by a knock on the door. He frowned as he opened it.
Tony smiled softly, a light blush on his cheek. His eyes landed on their baby in his sleep sack, laying on top of their thin covers. He doesn't know how he got to be so lucky as to end up with a perfect mate and a perfect pup.
"Yeah, but you know I was an only child, Tony. Not from a lack of trying on my parents' part either. They went through three miscarriages before they finally used in vitro to have me. If this baby doesn't make it, I don't want to deal with a whole bunch of people pitying me while I'm grieving."
Steve sucked and licked at his neck, right where his mark would go, adding a second finger. Tony rocked his hips and rolled them, anything to get more pressure. He just needed more.
"Then he kissed me and it was like fireworks exploded around us, and in our mouths. He tasted like heaven," Sam said dreamily. "He dragged me off to the bathroom and sucked me off in the stall and then I took him home and fucked him all night. Didn't let him off my knot until like an hour ago, when he said he really needed to go tell his best friend about us. That's when I came here to tell you, because you're
Tony rested his hand on his flat belly and all the eyes in the room went wide and congratulations and cheers went off after a moment of shock. Steve was the most shocked though and it took him the longest to say something.
"Your hair... It's wet," Steve said lamely, touching the end of one of the curls that framed Tony's face.
"Get your ass off my bar," Clint snapped. "Only paying customers are allowed to get all handsy on the bar."
Tony entered into a small hall, kicking off his shoes before heading further into the apartment. He froze when he saw Steve sitting on the couch next to Sam. Tony's heart raced in his chest and his mind was thrown through a loop, because what the fuck was his soulmate doing here?
The word rolled off his tongue like velvet and Tony felt all fluttery inside. He cleared his throat, feeling the urge to escape the foreign sensation.
Tony tried to get rid of the sappy look on his face, but failed. He didn't really care though. He pulled the door open and wrapped his arms around Steve. The Alpha was slightly taken aback. He had been concerned because the moment Tony's heat broke he had pulled away and retreated into the bathroom. That was forty-five minutes ago and when Tony didn't emerge Steve started to think maybe he regretted that they bonded.
"Go to sleep, pretty Alpha. You did so good for me," Tony murmured instead. "You sound so damn pretty when you're all frustrated."
He pressed closer, slipped his hand into Steve's back pocket to pluck out his phone and pouted when he realized it was locked.
He knew that Brock being mated now would mean he would move in with his Alpha. That's just how it worked. Brock gave him a guilty look.
Steve whimpered, his head falling to the side to give his Omega better access. Clearly, the goddess knew what she was doing when she paired them up, because this was better than Steve had dared to hope for. Steve had always been excited about having a mate, but he had always thought he'd present as an Omega. When he didn't, he was concerned that he'd never be a good enough Alpha, but the moment he saw Tony in that bar he knew that he was in love, knew that he'd do anything to please this man.
The bar where Tony worked wasn't exactly high end, but it wasn't awful. He kinda liked his job, even if his boss was an asshole. His coworkers were great and he got free food on his break, so it wasn't all bad. Tony was a server, Clint worked at the bar making drinks, and Bucky worked in the kitchen. It was a small place so it was usually just the three of them.
I love how much they're just lost on each other, like it's so sugary sweet and sappy but I love it. They're definitely in that newly bonded honeymoon phase
"Would you rather me bend over the table and let him knot me?" Tony asked sweetly, batting his eyes at Brock.
Steve served pasta primavera, a dish that Tony only had the ingredients to, because Steve had ordered groceries to be delivered after realizing that Tony had next to nothing in his fridge and cupboards. It was honestly a miracle he had fruit for Steve to slice up. Fruit he only had because Clint lived on a farm twenty minutes out from the city and had brought Tony a shit ton during his most recent harvest.
"Okay, okay. I'll stop, but you have to promise me that you'll come over for dinner tomorrow night. Sam's best friend is coming too,” Brock said casually, like he wasn’t secretly hoping that Steve was Tony’s soulmate. “It'll be my first time hosting a dinner like a real adult. You have to be there."
“Why didn’t you go with him?!” Luna asked them in general while her face was hidden in Happy’s chest.
All of the lights in the tower turned off in the building. Pepper held Luna closer and gripped her hand. “Let’s go down to the safe room? Hmm?”
“Hello, my, my you must be muggles. How did you get here?” The older man asked them looking them up and down.
Bruce disappeared leaving Tony alone in the living room. “Hey, Jarvis. Find me three archers of land in the middle of nowhere. Then buy it and build me a five-bedroom home. We are going to need to hide. Just don’t furnish it, please.”
“Can you hear me, Vi? Come on wake up.” Tony pressed the spider in the center of the suit and picked her up. “Peter get the suit back on.” He commanded and put Violet back in the dress once Peter changed out of it.
Peter just nodded and went down to the lab with Tony gripping his hand tightly. “Don’t leave me, okay?”
“I didn’t think of that. I’m sorry Luna. I should have asked you before we made a plan. I’m truly sorry,” Tony whispered and kissed her forehead.
Going inside Luna was laid out on the kitchen floor sobbing to the music that blared through the speakers. Bruce walked over and set his hands on top of her shoulder.
“Get dressed. We have to leave in three hours.” Tony told her and walked back into the master bedroom.
“You two stay up here. Papa and I are gonna go to this meeting three doors down. If you need anything please call.” Tony kissed both of their heads. “I love you both.”
Peter took her hand and started walking with her while the dogs kept close. They walked aimlessly around the station looking for anyone that they knew. Hating every second they were alone.
Wanda smiled at the couple. “I know they are.” She kneeled laying her head on the floor. “I hear their thoughts. They are happy but hungry. But expected. Bruce and Cho are talking about fixing the health problems with the twins.”
Luna whispered under her breath, “Decides no one knows about me… or that I’m your daughter. Are you ashamed of me?”
“I know you will. I know you will make it out alive,” Steve whispered and pulled Tony in for a kiss. Not ending the kiss until they both needed oxygen. “I love you. Never forget that. Understand, my love?”
The sun was an orange peach rising over the water. Everything was calm and silent in the world. Reporters started coming to the beach to speak about Tony Stark-Rogers death.
Peter smiled and stopped dancing with her when the song died down. “I love you too. Let’s get you up there and say thank you to everyone for coming.”
Steven gave Luna a towel to wrap around herself while he, Bruce and the other doctors started to get Tony ready for the move.
Everyone stayed for the after party telling war and personal stories. The room was decorated in red, white and blue for the flag. Steve would have been very proud of the decorations.
“Steve she looks so little… and frail like glass.” Tony told him and sighed. “How are we going to yell at her about going to that school? All she wanted to do was play her music, and it’s our fault she can’t. We didn’t protect her.”
"Steve," Tony groaned, scooping Harley up and gently laying him back down so he was now sleeping by the wall instead of in between them.
"What about pretty Omega? Can I call you that or will you go off about being an independent Omega that doesn't need an Alpha's validation to know you're pretty?"
Steve groaned, turning off his bike, and let Tony pull him in for a kiss, but he stopped Tony when he tried to undo his pants.
He dropped his bag, kicked off his shoes and let his coat fall to the ground. He didn't care enough to pick them up and put them away. He didn't care about anything. He just felt numb. Well, he felt hurt and betrayed and jealous, even though he'd never admit it out loud, but he also sort of felt numb, like he was feeling so many emotions that he just couldn't process any of them.
"As soon as you can hold your head up, I'm gonna let your daddy take you for a ride on the bike that you were named after," Tony cooed at him.
"Good, I want you to get your hand off your dick and finger yourself. We're both gonna finger ourselves and come untouched," Tony told him. "Sound good?"
"We tried to get Obie fired, but the owner, Alexander Pierce, was backing him, so we're taking him to court. They've been doing a whole bunch of shady stuff that's totally illegal, from paying people off to pass inspections and dealing drugs out back in the alley, to denying us health insurance, making us work overtime but not paying us overtime, and usually they make the Omegas work during heat. I think Obie only gave in this time, because he thought you might beat his ass if he called me in for work."
So when Brock finally coaxed Tony out of the bathroom and onto the couch, Tony glared at Sam. He hated this Alpha for taking away his best friend. Brock tried to ease the tension, but Tony was too bitter to let go of his anger, so eventually Brock sighed and kissed Tony's cheek. They gathered up Brock's stuff from his room and left. Tony couldn't help but feel like Brock was choosing his Alpha over Tony.
If Tony thought that Steve made pretty sounds, moaning and groaning, whining and whimpering as he got closer to his release but struggled to push himself over the edge, then Steve thought Tony made the prettiest goddamn sounds in the world. Tony whined and whimpered and Steve could hear the rustling of his sheets as he squirmed on the bed, damn near sobbing as he got close.
"I'm going to be a good Alpha, Sam. I'm gonna be so good to my Omega and give them everything that an Alpha is supposed to give their Omega. My mark, my knot, my pups. All of it," Steve said, determined.
He knew that he could go back to his work, but that just seemed wrong. If the Omega didn't want to see him Steve wasn't going to force him to. He definitely wasn't going to pressure his little mate. He wasn't an asshole.
"Save me, Alpha! Save me!" Tony said dramatically, like he was acting in a really bad high school production of The Omegan Princess. "This cruel man is trying to destroy my virtue."
Steve felt awed by his little Omega. So much strength wrapped up in such a small little package it was unbelievable, and to think he was all Steve's. Steve kissed him, hard and lingering.
Tony was in love. There was no doubt about it. He was in love and happily mated and he sighed, a smile on his lips. There was a knock on the bathroom door and Tony turned his head to glance at it.
"No, no, something's wrong. I think I'm dying," Tony moaned dramatically, dropping to his knees and curling in on himself until his forehead was pressed up against the cold ground.
"Yeah, 'course. Now are you gonna invite me in or make me stay out in the hall for dinner?" Tony said, trying and failing to sound like his usual snarky self.
Bucky's heart twinged in his chest, but he ignored the jealousy that he felt at the thought of Tony having an Alpha. It wasn't like Tony had ever shown an interest in Bucky anyway. Tony had never shown an interest in any Alpha, at least not that Bucky knew of. Bucky found Steve's name easily, there were dozens of calls from and to him in the past few days alone. Bucky gritted his teeth, biting back a growl and called Steve. He answered on the first ring, like he was just sitting around waiting for a call from Tony.
"Can I text you on the way home?" Steve blurted out, blushing bright red when he realized what he'd asked.
Brock rolled his eyes and Sam stepped in to steer the conversation towards less rocky waters. Steve continued to rave about his Omega and Sam nodded along indulgently.
The next chapter is the last one and the next fic is not focused on Stony, but all of these parts can be read and enjoyed individually. So if you like Stuckony you can easily just wait until the last part is out and pick up there.
"Shut up, I don't care about that," Tony said, cutting off his nervous rambling. "Are you for real? You have that kind of money and you'd be willing to let me buy a bar with it?"
The first night when Steve didn't get a call from his soulmate he convinced himself that he was too tired when he got off his shift to call him, that maybe he didn't want to call him so late. Totally reasonable. Steve barely slept that night, staring at his phone for hours and willing it to ring before dragging his butt out of bed at the crack of dawn and heading over to Sam's.
"Oh, baby, shh, it's okay. I'm right here, pretty Omega," Steve soothed, scooping him up off of Bucky's lap.
"I don't like the way Alphas feel entitled to an Omega's body. Like Omegas are beneath them and only there for an Alpha's pleasure."
Luckily, Tony lived close by and they made it there in under five minutes. Tony even let Steve set him down on the couch and head off to the kitchen to slice up fruit for his Omega. Steve was just plating the food and setting it on a tray when Tony whined, a high pitched sound that had his Alpha rushing to his side, the tray of fruit abandoned.
Steve whined again, but he wrapped his arms around Tony when he slipped off of him and pressed back until his ass was snug against the erection in Steve's sweats. Steve squirmed and Tony smirked, shifting slightly just to hear him whine again, the sound muffled as he ducked to hide his head in Tony's neck.
In this au being soft is synonymous with being submissive, so Omegas are supposed to be soft and Alphas aren't, which is why being a "soft" Alpha is seen as a negative thing and Steve tends to have a negative view of his desire to be submissive or bottom
Steve nodded and began to cry into his hands. “Fine, Tony. Whatever. You will find the spare bedroom!”
“I-I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to hit your foot with the cane. Or the person behind me. I’m sorry. Please just let me walk past…”
Steve walked over and kissed the top of Tony’s head. “Love, I am glad to see that you are having a good time, but you do know we have to go…” Steve looked at his watch the twins gave him for father's day, “...in almost three hours.”
“It’s nice to meet new people…” Neville told her blushing brighter than a tomato. “Are you a first year?”
“Magic…” Peter spoke and broke out laughing. “Did you really think you could hold all of us and we wouldn’t think of a plan?.”
“Yo, Penis Parker! Look at you four. Are you having a foursome or something? Can blind people have sex? I guess she can’t tell if you have a big or small dick. Good thing too you seem like you have a small one.” Flash asked them pushing Peter into the wall.
“Language!” Tony snapped at Steve getting an eye roll from the comment, “You left the fight fine. Huh?! You didn’t get your ass kicked oh right you were getting a blow job! How could you just disappear in the middle of everyone fighting?!”
When she opened the door she smiled at him with big eyes. “Hi! You must be one of Charles’s newest…” Luna looked at the back and stepped back gasping for air. Gripping her shirt trying to grab her shirt. “P-Pops…? No… you're not real… stop don’t do this to me!”
“Just wanted to make sure you were paying attention,” Tony told her and grinned to himself. Having a party in his head. Everything was falling into place.
Luna was so fantasized by all the pretty colors that she didn’t start running until Neville pulled on her arm. She followed them liking how they all kept close. She’s going to miss having her glasses in the muggle world. She knows she has it lucky out in the wizarding world.
Tony leaned over and took the microphone. “It was fifteen years ago today Steve and I got married again and changed the name of Stark Industries into the name today. So, as my last gift to the expo I, Tony Rogers-Stark am giving 15 million dollars to new projects this year!”
“I want us to be. I really want us to be!” Steve told him and held his hands out to the boy. “Come here kiddo.”
Tony just sighed. “It’s okay. I’m gonna be an Avenger too. I’m going to be working on new gear for you guys and once I get my armor working I’ll be on the battlefield with you.”
Steve walked over and wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist. “Tony, you will be fine. It’s been six years since they said it began to expand. You had two months and it’s clearly been years. Space couldn’t have done anything to you. At least I don’t think so.”
“Welcome home Sirs, young Peter, and child. What shall I call your other child, sirs?” Jarvis asked. Tony knew if Jarvis already detected her vitals and determined that it was the same as there long lost daughter that it had to be her. That Jarvis is never wrong.
“I heard a voice in my head telling me to come down here. I just figured it was her. She looks just like she did two years ago, Dad. She’s a bit lighter though.” Looking down at her Peter saw something pinkish through plastic. “H-hey she’s got plastic on her head. I think I see her brain. Ew...”
Steve looked at him. “There is no other choice than to raise them. They need us, Tony. More than anything in the world. I want this. Don’t you?”
“Dr. Yang… I can play. I promise you I can play. I’ve been playing since I was three… please. Give me another chance when my real prosthetic arms come in.” Violet pleaded.
“Of course,” Tony told her and sat on the lid of the toilet. “I heard you were telling stories. Wanna share?”
“Luna, sir. Please to meet you,” She told him and looked up at the man with her glasses on her face.
“Yes!” Steve handed the phone over and pulled his family close. The twins in the front and Tony in the back with Steve.
“Peter, stop crying. Please.” Violet whispered and began to shake when the reporters started grabbing her arms and her coat off her. “I don’t want the magic to happen.”
“Let him go to school learning how to use magic. He will need it for her future or he won’t be able to control his magic. If he can’t control it he will end up killing someone.”
“Decides that all of your actions were justified. We will be sending you home, now. Violet and Peter be ready to train when school is over next week for summer break.” Fury stood up. “You may stay the night here in your rooms.”
Once everyone was seated at the round table Fury sat and glared at them. “First thing we need to do is sign these two before I can speak freely. Are you both in agreement that you will be agents of S.H.I.E.L.D?”
Tony and Steve covered the twins and some of the other heroes. When the bombs all went off the monsters lit up like a Christmas tree. The blast from inside took each of them down, but not the portal. “Cap what do we do about the big wormhole thing?” Peter asked grinning. He loved calling his parents their superhero names.
“Welcome everyone to 2028 Rogers-Stark Industry Expo!” Tony yelled into the microphone standing next to Steve. “As many of you know I have been CEO of my own company for the past two years. Man what a big weight on my shoulders. I know there has been rumors going around this year saying that I am retiring, let’s face it I’m old.”
Fighting crime and saving the world isn’t a normal honeymoon, but for Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, it was given. It’s been three days since they had gotten married, but saving the world from Ultron. It was a good thing that everyone was attending the wedding because they couldn't do fight this demon on their own.
All three of them slept out in the hospital waiting room. Steve didn’t want them to see Tony attached to all of the machines. Though he knew they were gonna go see him as soon as he woke up.
Luna pulled him into a kiss and dipped him back gripping his arms. Peter put the ring on her finger while kissing her. They stayed like that until she couldn’t hold him up anymore.
“We can leave in ten minutes. I already booked us a flight.” Tony grinned when Steve started jumping up and down.
Violet walked over and kissed him on the cheek. She pulled him close to make sure no one else could hear them. “Make sure you behave and maybe they’ll let us see one another… I will always find my way back to you.”
Everyone looked at one another. “No one is a Mr. Lovegood here. Wrong address.” Clint told him and pointed an arrow at him. “I suggest you leave.”
“After you all wash your hands you can touch the angle,” Tony told them and smiled turning around at the door. “That must be the newbies.” Tony opened the door and saw the eight standing there. “Hello, you guys must be the party goers. I’m Tony, Tony Stark-Rogers.”
Violet stood still like a statue when the two superheroes came down the stairs. They approached the girl slowly looking at her.
“They can live here too. I don’t care about anything. If you have kids they can grow up with our daughter. We can make a floor into a homeschool place,” Steve held Tony’s hand. “We will be alright.”
The man looked over and saw the girl in front of the counter. “Hello there, I’m Garrick. Owner of this fine wand shop. What’s your name?”
Nick left the room leaving the four of them in there. “Hey, Peter who’s your friend?” Tony asked getting out of the chair walking over to the other table.
Steve grabbed Tony and pushed him back away from the two children. Clint and Nat stood ready to fight on each side of them. While Sam and Rhodey stood next to Peter behind his parents ready to do anything to protect the boy. Bucky was out in the hall listening to everything.
“No, you don’t. You love the idea of me, but not me… you forget me all the time. I heard dad tell you to come up here and tell you to sit with me today. Peter needs you anyway.” Violet told him and curled into her bed facing the wall.
They all sat at the big dining room table. “As you all know. You are all humanly different and have different skills. You are all the Avengers who will save the world when the time will come. You will need to train and know everything about one another. We need a place to shelter you all. Any ideas?”
“It’s Christmas. I’m so sorry you didn’t get to see Santa and didn’t get to go home.” Steve walked over and sat on the floor lifting his head up. “We will see Santa again I promise.”
Tony kneeled next to her grunting and pulled her close. “It’s okay to cry over this. You lost both of your arms.”
Both men got up and left the lab and went into all the chaos. Boxes were all over the house and very high classes S.H.I.E.L.D. agents there to help them transfer everything.
“Luna when I met you, you were laying on the bed with your parents. Your shirt said, ‘Your eyes can deceive you; don’t trust them.’ said by Obi-Wan Kenobi. I knew the second I saw that shirt on you I was going to marry you. We have watched every single anime show over again so we could compare notes. We both know that being different is a great thing. Mirajane says ‘We are all different from each other and that’s what makes us special.’ I love that quote and it’s in our living room. You have taught me so many things. Just like Violet Evergarden wrote to the Major… And if I can ever see you again, I want to let you know… that the phrase “I love you”... I know what it means. I love you…”
Peter smiled and stuck his tongue out blowing a raspberry. Steve made sure Tony would regret the day that he taught Peter how to make that noise. Steve slept on the couch for two weeks and made sure when Tony was watching he would bend over flirty or would come home shirtless and sweaty from the gym. Not giving Tony any loving made the makeup bittersweet.
It was the twins- Peter’s eighth birthday and the tower was celebrating. The penthouse was decorated in red and blue streamers, and balloons (with the exception of one purple balloon). Tony was looking at the cake the store made with red and blue frosting and a big fondant spider sitting on top with other bugs crawling on the sides.
Violet leaned forward and held him close while tears streamed down her face. “It would be weird if bears shit in the bathroom. I love you, daddy. Peter… is gonna kill me.” She laughed and full on cried into his shoulder. “Your here…”
“Get over here punk jr.” Bucky ran over and picked Peter up throwing him up in the air then tickling him as he came down into his arms. Peter kept squealing. “Don’t worry I didn’t lose your other kid. She asked to stay home with Dummy and anyone else at the tower. So I took her there.”
“Bruce, babycakes, how is she looking?” Tony asked him and sat up in the chair. Ever since the fight, he was sick to his stomach with the pain of losing her and not finding her fast enough.
She wore a strapless ballroom dress that was tie-dyed in a million different colors. The lace under her dress was a bright neon orange that could be seen every time she moved.  Her mask though matched Peter’s so they looked united. She felt weird in the dress because it showed off her metal arms to everyone else. Her biggest weakness.
The man behind her shot up into the air pushing the frail on to the ground. Everyone covered their heads while Tony and Steve jump into the action seeing that the rest of their team already were fighting what seemed like Hydra agents. Everyone was screaming and yelling.
“He’s a stubborn pain in my ass,” Clint told Kent and handed Tony the coffee cup. “Let’s get you upstairs, please. Hey look, Nat’s calling.”
Steve sighed and walked over to her. “Please, princess. I need help here. I know it’s your birthday and you don’t want to, but it was the only appointment they had. Daddy will also be back later today from the doctors. Please let’s behave so everyone can come over.”
“You can call me, Clint. And it’s alright, I was still up anyway. Get some rest.” Clint waved and walked out of the room with the husbands.
“Bucky you don’t have to be in here if you can’t handle this,” Steve told Bucky and leaned into him.
He walked over to the walls and pulled everything down smashing them into the floor. Screaming louder and louder until he was at the last picture on the wall. It was a recent picture of them with the twins at the Make A Wish fundraiser. Tony held the frame close and sank down the wall gripping the frame close crying more tears. “Steve, why him?!”
“Luna, come here sweetheart. We didn’t even get to say hello.” Papa told me from the doorway trying his best to smile.
“He said all three of us. Peter is coming. Eye patch wants all of us.” Tony rolled his eyes and took Steve’s hand.
After older Violet wiped there mind everything went to how it should have. Tony and Steve raised their children how they saw fit. It was Christmas Eve when Tony decided that he was going to take his family on the Polar Express. They had just finished reading the book to the kids and wanted to have them experience it themselves.
They never moved out to the house that Tony built because they didn’t feel safe with that monster out there that took their child. They stayed in the tower and sold the house to S.H.I.E.L.D. not wanting to ever think about that house again. Tony hired more security and for the whole first year of Peter’s life Happy would be with him when Tony and Steve left the room not wanting the last baby being taken.
“Wait! There is also one thing.” Bucky yelled and went after them. “The press knows about the twins' powers.”
The two girls held hands as they walked down the stairs and into the crowd. Pepper was able to spot the two men in the crowd. They walked slowly through the crowd with Happy behind them not too far, but close enough if something was to happen he could step in.
Luna ran behind him with the others as black smoke surrounded them. The smoke took everyone, but Harry who stood there clueless. Luna stood there quietly knowing in a kidnapping situation not to talk or move unless someone asks you too. It’s better to be safe than dead.
Luna shook her head and got up, “Papa needs you more than I do. I’ll go… and behave. I promise. He needs you guys more than he needs me.”
“We are going to have it at four so then you guys can see everyone before your patrol if you're still up to it.” Steve parked the car and everyone got out going inside.
She nodded and took the water from Peter and drank the water. “Thank you, Spidy and Dr. Banner for everything this evening, but my head is killing me and I wish to go home.”
She nodded laying her head onto her knees. “I-I have to… go plan for, Papa. He won’t be able too. He needs to be remembered forever. He is a legend...”
Two men ran off the plane with guns while one man ran in front of them with a big smile on his face. “Son of a bitch. You're still alive.” Sam smiled and went onto his knees pulling Tony close. “Let’s get you home, and next time you want to go on a field-trip let one of us know.”
“Jarvis? What time is it?” Steve asked while sitting up rubbing his face. He felt like he was sleepy but more awake than ever. When no one answered Steve knew something was up. Then his memories flooded into his mind.
The courtroom was just allowing people in when Peter walked into the room. As soon as he saw Tony he let go of May Parker’s hand and sprinted to him. “DAD!” Peter screamed making every head turn in the room.
I wrapped my arms around him tightly and started to tear up. “I love you, Peter Joseph Rogers-Stark. Know that forever and always I love you. Even when we are apart.”
“I’m so sorry, Tony.” Steve began but got pulled into a kiss to shut him up. “Mm… What was that for?”
Steve picked up the paper and began to read: “Nick Fury. You might not know me, but I know you from my timeline. My parents always told us if we were in trouble to come to you. So, that’s what I’m doing with my daughter. I was kidnapped by some aliens in the year 2061. I woke up pregnant and alone in China. I had my daughter and survived in the wilderness. That’s when I found out she has extraordinary powers. I can’t raise her to be who she can be since my powers have been taken away. I love her with all of my heart. Please take care of her and raise her to be the women I hope she can be. Violet Evergarden was born on March 7th, 2003. Violet, my darling. I love you. Always: V.M.R-S.”
Dr. Strange walked over and placed a hand on top of her shoulder. “Hey, Luna… how are you feeling? I know we are all feeling upset about this, but the universe has a weird way of taking things into its own hands.”
“No! It’s my fault. It’s all my fault the serum did this. Putting false hope into our hearts.” Steve mumbled and cried.
Being able to see was always one of her biggest wishes in the world. She was born with her sight, but after the bomb at the muggle hospital where she was born, she was never able to use her gift of sight. “N-No thank you. I wasn’t able to see my birth parents… I don’t want to gain my sight. Thank you for the offer though.”
Dr. Strange: “I have seen billions of futures and there is only one where you aren’t married to one another. I have been waiting for years.”
Luna ran over to the couch and wrapped her arms around her dad. Over the years she was able to learn where everything in the house was located. Everyone knew if they were moving furniture in the common room or in the Stark-Rogers apartment to let Luna know so she didn’t have to use her cane in her own home. “I missed you! How was California? Did you go to Disneyland? Did you go see ELLEN?! What about the Loony Toons?! The Gilmore Girl house?!”
“Yes. I love school, but I miss our homeschool teachers. Mrs. Mavis is really smart, but Daddy teaches us science in his lab and Papa teaches us art, but not music since he can’t play anything decides the wake-up horn.” That got a laugh from everyone in the audience. “He said he learned that from being in the army.”
“I’ll call the school and ask them when she is supposed to play,” Friday told them and went silent for twenty minutes. “Sir, Violet Evergarden is going to be playing from 11:45 to 12:30 and is in a few this morning as a company. She has two seats in the back that she told the school to give away but didn’t. They are faxing the tickets over. She is receiving an award today and would like you both to give it to her.”
“The first week I met you we watched all of the Gilmore Girl series. All 153 of them. That’s a lot. During that time Luke kept fighting for Lorelai. I thought about how that was going to be me one day. I don’t remember every little detail with them, but I do remember what Luke said. “This thing we’re doing here, You, me. I’m in. I am all in.” I want to wake up next to you every single day. Love you and hold you. Promise me, Luna.”
May got up and held Peter close sobbing into his shoulder: “I can’t wait to plan this wedding for you.”
Luna kept coughing into her sleeve and wiped the blood coming from her head on the other sleeve. “Newt! Come back! Newt!”
“Hey, Papa.” Peter smiled and took a bite of the ice chips. “I heard I freaked a nurse out with my finger! Is that true? I hope it is!”
Steve sat next to him keeping his eyes on Violet who struggled to keep her eyes open. “So, let’s begin, please.”
“I will kick your ass kid if you don’t shut up. Get down here and fight.” Hawkeye told him. “You are an Avenger now!”
Professor McGonagall went on to the stage and looked down at the students smiling. “When I call your name to step forward and I will place the Sorting Hat on your head it will place you into your home for the next seven years. Ginny Weasley,”
Professor Flitwick walked forward and placed a hand on my shoulder. “I came to find you earlier, but you did not come to breakfast. I have sad news and I hate to tell you, but your parents aren’t coming. Your uncles are coming to take you to America for the week since there are no classes this week.”
Natasha kneeled down to the girls level and took both of her hands into hers. “We didn’t know if you wanted to give a eulogy or if you wanted one of us to do it. Either way, we would be happy to help you.”
Luna rushed her hand to grab her wand from the group yelling the word. “Liberacorpus!” It sent the man fifty feet back down the row.
“It’s okay baby girl,” Steve kneeled and pulled them into a hug. “I am so sorry if we mistreated you or thought we didn’t love you just the same.”
A day after the man left the Avengers alarm sounded. Pepper came over to babysit Luna while they were gone on the mission. Pepper normally volunteered to watch the young girl while they went on the mission so they could have ‘girl time’. After they left New York was in danger. Aliens were coming out of the sky. The Avengers started to deal with the situation but were still out of town by eight minutes.
Violet smiled and curled into her fathers never wanting the hug to end. “We use to call this an S.P.V.T sandwich. I have to go.”
Tony took his boxers off leaving him in his birthday suit. “Sure Cap.”  he walked in the bedroom slowly and climbed onto the bed growling playfully at his husband. Everyone knew that they weren’t allowed to call them for the next few days.
Tony walked out of the room running up to the front desk. “Gale, where is this purple thing she wants? She’s having a panic attack over it.”
The elevator brought me up to the main floor of the tower. When I walked out I could hear him on the phone.
Nat kissed Violet’s head and handed her to Steve. “You both have the same color eyes. That’s crazy. Not many people have that color baby blue.”
“She told me everything. I think she’s ready to tell you guys as well. Just don’t interrupt. She got upset when I did,” Bruce told him and went into the bathroom. “Don’t worry she’s in her swimsuit. I didn’t see anything”
“You have our word.” Dr. Strange told him and looked around. “Well, I guess I will see you when they decide to redo the fundraiser.”
“Would you care to sit down?” Tony pointed to the chair in front of the TV facing everyone. He didn’t want her standing behind him.
“I want them. Understand that right now,” Steve argued. “I want them. I have always wanted to be a father. And being one with you is my everything. It makes me feel complete.”
“About time you thought that. I am the superior parent,” Tony told him and grabbed his briefcase walking to the elevator. “Finish this in court. Oh, right. 100% will.”
Sitting up gasping for air she looked around and caught eyes with Hawkeye. “No, please tell me I didn’t kill anyone! Please!”
“Alright. Thank you, Bruce. I’m sorry I couldn’t shower before you came up here. I haven’t been strong enough to stand long enough.”
“Jarvis, please bring up the x-rays of each of the children and normal x-ray,” Bruce asked and took out his notebook from his jacket.
Tony sat in the wheelchair while Steve carried it over the sand to the rock where Tony proposed. Steve understood Tony wanted to die where they began everything. They went here every anniversary to make out at the rock. They brought Luna here every birthday to carve her height into the rock. Everything happened here. This was the most magical place for the small family.
“I call Saka!” Tony yelled and ran to his laptop on the counter going to find their costumes. “I’m gonna get a boomerang!”
“They're excited to be accepted as the heroes they are meant to be,” Happy told her and rubbed the girl's hand. He had become her bodyguard after the battle in Times Square by her school.
“Just follow me,” Violet told him and walked inside the school. “Sugar… Thor, you can’t write. Excuse me… ma’am, could you please sign me in?”
Luna got up from her seat and walked up to the stage gripping Newt’s metal guide collar. He let out a little wine every time there was a step. Once she was at the podium she looked up for the first time in the past week. Her face was pale with dark circles around her bloodshot eyes.
A screen went down and a video started playing. Tony was on his death bed with IV bags behind him. “Well, Steve your up here in heaven with me. You left all our friends and daughter just like I did. Baby girl be strong for me. You have so much love here with you. I hope it’s at least 2045 when he died. You're married by now so hold that loved one close for me. Don’t let her cry alone…”
Tony walked up to the podium and tapped the microphone making the feedback pierce everyone's ears in the room. “Well, at least we know this is on now. Now, everyone, I will be doing the talking no interrupting or I will leave here and give Clark Kent and Lois Lane the inside scoop with my twins.
“Steve, did you want to bring this with you?” Bucky asked and held up the Red Skull’s mask for him to see. “It can stay here if you want.”
Steve leaned over and set Violet on her feet. “There you go sugar bear. Bruce when will her arms be done?”
Shaking her head no a few times she took deep breaths. “N-no… can’t see me...” she gasped out and closed her eyes. “Jarvis is this Pops truly right in front of me?”
Getting shoved into a bag in the middle of the night isn’t the best way of waking up. She kicked and screamed trying to escape the bag. She believed that she was in the bag for longer than three hours. When she felt everything stop moving she kicked her legs. “Let me out!”
“We hear you loud and clear,” Peter told him. “We just had to do a wardrobe change. Thanks to Mr. Stark my suit can fly, so I gave it to my partner and she is going to close the portal but stay close to it so she won’t run out of energy. She’s already low from the bombs since she couldn’t see all of them. Man, do I look good in a dress?”
After the first ten minutes the double doors opened and there she was with a man who looked stern. She stood quietly facing the ground not looking up at anyone. “Over here, Violet!” Peter yelled and pointed to the two extra chairs between him and May. He didn’t even realize that he interrupted the judge. She didn’t even flinch when her name was yelled. The man sat his hand on Violet’s shoulder forcing her to take a seat in the back row away from the family that was waiting to see her.
“No,” Steve told him and grabbed Tony by the shoulders making Tony face him. Grabbing his chin to make Tony look into one another's eyes. “After I lost you I knew I wanted you. Tony Stark, I love you. I love you, I love you.”
“We should end the team. Don’t you wanna move one day out the tower? Where you and Bucky can be all alone? Don’t you want to build a life with him?”
Blinking made things go faster apparently because then it was only two minutes until they are here. I got dressed quickly in my green leggings with a black flowered pattern shirt and a pink sweater that I patched my house crest on. Then to top it off my glasses, which I put a spell that gave me back 40% of my sight. Which is amazing!
Luna looked at him. “I kissed his cheek not even his lips. Dad, please. I’m sorry. I’m only human and I have feelings too.”
“Bring him to the gym,” Tony told him and got out of his suit. “Steve we need to handcuff her as well.”
“Daddy you no answer my question!” Peter yelled and looked up at him holding his fork tighter. “Please, daddy!”
Steve laid Baby Peter down and went into the elevator dragging Tony behind him. Helen was running out fast and into the lab.
“A little bit. I’m fine, sweetheart.” Tony took his hand and started walking to the car where Happy was waiting. “I just wanna go home and sleep in my house.”
Violet had one of her ‘imaginary’ friends, Kiki (from Kiki Delivery Service), sitting on the floor of his closet. “Peter… forgot me… didn’t he?” the imaginary friend started to tear up and faded away from the closet.
“Um… well, I guess that you saw that they are just children that can handle their powers. Please, leave them out of the media until they are at least fifteen. Thank you, everyone.” Tony smiled and walked down the path into the hall, but the press could hear Tony yell. “Get back here Peter! I will eat your toes!”
“IT IS!” Tony screamed at him. “I couldn’t be loved by you! You left me for Bucky! If I could have been Bucky life would have been better. If I never got you pregnant we wouldn’t be in this mess! It would have been better if they were your kids with Bucky. I’m nothing. I’m not worthy of love. I hate that you had to show me that I’m nothing, but an ass. An unloveable ass.”
As soon as the strange man left Steve turned to Tony with hands on his lap. “There is no fucking way in hell that she is going.”
Peter married Mary Jane (MJ) and had four kids before they turned thirty. So, Peter became a quiet partner in Stark Industries while I lead it myself. I went back to playing music for fun and that’s when I found Gilbert again. We dated eight years before I finally said yes, but never tied the knot knowing if I did I would never fix things for Peter and I. I had only one daughter, Abigail. She was born a week after I said yes. It’s hard to believe she is going to be twenty-two. I was blessed that all of our kids got along great. It made me feel better about being a mom since I never had a mother to look up too.
Violet took the microphone from Tony with a a bit of a glare. “Thank you everyone for coming out. Please enjoy everything.”
Tony took off all of his clothes but boxers. He kept the white button-up shirt to keep over his head. His beard was almost to his chest making his skin itchy.
Steve began speaking. “We don’t want you to treat us any different. We are still going to fight with everything we have. Don’t protect us for her sake. We have many things in place if something happens to us. Which is why we are talking about this now. Pepper and Happy are going to take her in if something happens to us, but if they die or are unable to take her in we are trusting Sam, Rhodey, Bruce, and Bucky to take care of her. If it happens that all of them are dead then Dr. Strange, Natasha, Vision, and Wanda will be her guardians. She is going to need all of you, in the end, depending on who is alive. Thor since you will always be alive you are going to be her Godfather. She knows about Tony being sick and acts like it doesn’t hurt her, but it is. She needs you and we are asking permission to make sure that this is alright with all of you.”
“Well, it’s clear to say that you each want your children safe and home with you. You both are financially stable. I propose that we have you have joint custody. It would be best for the children to slowly come home with you both. I would like to talk to the children first before anything is in effect.” After taking a minute the judge called Peter to the stand. “Peter Rogers-Stark please come up to the stand.”
“Amazing. I would have thought it was store-bought,” Tony told her and set a hand on her shoulder. “So proud of you, kiddo.”
“So many glass balls…” Hermione pointed out and looked around. Everyone stayed close to one another behind Harry and her. Nevil, Ginny, and Ron were right behind them as Luna came up in the rear.
Steve let Rhodey take Tony down to the adult doctor. While he and Bucky went into the kid's recovery room. Steve felt like there was a weight on top of his chest, but he had to hide it from them.
Tony came and sat down letting Steve sit on the edge. Tony looked around at all the kids with there candy canes and homemade picture frames. “Kids, did we miss Santa?”
Steve’s favorite thing in the world was watching his twins float in the ‘goo’ he was calling it while they were still developing. The boy is going to be Peter Rogers-Stark and the girl is going to be Violet Rogers-Stark. They are ready to be born at any time.
The family had to learn to adjust to missing a member. It took a while, but they learned to adjust. Though Tony has never stopped looking. He has Jarvis on the look for her everyday scanning everywhere in the country and not in the country.
Levi stood after Denice sat down and placed a hand on Tony’s shoulder. Levi was the number one child custody lawyers in the country. He paid her extra and flew her out on his jet from Hawaii to come to represent him. “Good morning your honor and thank you for letting us take your time today. Anthony Edward Stark is a great man who gives work to over five million people in our population. He has been heartbroken ever since the twins were ripped out of his home. One of the safest homes I might add. Evidence A shows a video where the twins are being protected by the home’s A.I. Jarvis. The computer zapped the men and safely led the children to the music room's safe room, but was compromised when Loki sent one of his companions into the lab taking Jarvis down.
"Good God, you're pathetic," Brock groaned in exasperation. "Seriously? That boy lives to please you. He's gonna be thrilled that you're gonna need massages and foot rubs for the next nine months. Not to mention, now he's gonna have two people to order him around. He's gonna be so excited to spoil your little mini-me, Tony."
"Whatever, just tell me how long I have to find a new roommate," Tony grumbled, feeling bitter about the whole thing.
Tony watched him as he cooked, teased him a little bit, made sappy jokes and gave him heart eyes when Steve blew kisses at him. It was all so cheesy and gooey and sugary sweet and all the other food related metaphors used to describe fools in love. Tony would make fun of anyone he saw act like this, but he couldn't find it in himself to be anything but thrilled. He had clearly fallen, and fallen hard at that.
Tony was wiping up a table when Brock walked in and Clint whistled, calling Tony's attention to him before pointing to the door.
"I know, because you're such a good boy," Tony murmured, kissing him. "Mm, as much as I'd love to stick around and let you fuck me on every surface in your apartment, I really have to get going or I'm gonna be late."
Steve whined back, sounding distressed because he didn't think he would get a release and the thought of staying frustrated all night, maybe even longer if Tony didn't give him permission to come in the morning, was just too much.
Sam's Omega snapped at them to shut up when he entered the kitchen, ranted about how Steve was way too sunshiny for someone who was awake before the sun, and then stole Sam's coffee. Sam just smiled fondly at him and wrapped his arms around his waist, letting Brock lean up against him.
Steve's blush deepened at being called a pup, but he didn't object to it. The moment Steve was within reach Tony grabbed his shirt and slammed their lips together, turning them so he could shove Steve up against the wall. Tony's hair was still dripping wet and his shirt was drenched. It got Steve wet, soaking through his own sweater, but he didn't care.
The baby was a boy with a light dusting of blond hair on his head and startling blue eyes that stared up at them all sparkling and full of wonder as he took in all of the new sights around him.
It was a week after Sam and Brock's dinner party that Tony's heat hit. He was at work at the time, heading through the kitchen to get to the employee break room in the back when he hunched over in pain.  Tony groaned, suffering through what must have been the worst cramp of his life and it had come on so fast and out of the blue that he seriously hadn't expected it. Bucky turned the stove off and came over to Tony, cautious because Tony got a bit touchy about Alphas trying to help him, but clearly concerned.
