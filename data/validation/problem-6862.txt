The genius laid more kisses on secret spots that absolutely drove Steve wild; the soft skin behind the blonde’s ear, along the skin of his neck. And Steve openly moaned when the brunette scrapped his teeth along the super soldier’s serratus anterior muscles.
Steve’s phone chirped beside him as he added a few more strokes to the canvas. He had been painting a small still life, something simple as he tested the waters of the new art medium. Steve checked his phone then, seeing a text from Tony, asking him what he wanted to eat for their date night in. Steve had a craving for Italian, and so he let his boyfriend know, as well as tell him he’d be back to the Tower soon.
The brunette’s facial hair tickled and gently scratched on the sensitive skin of Steve’s ass and entrance, each brush of his cropped beard reddening Steve’s pale skin. Every passing swipe added a slight bit more burning to his skin, making Steve jolt away, only to shove back in earnest, wanting more of that sweet, raw sensation.
In the bowels of the spacious ship was a customized laboratory, where a handsome inventor, Tony Stark sat, fiddling with metal and tools. He was on the brink of a new invention, something that was a little different from his usual weapon design and engineering. He was soldering two metal pieces together when small, yet confident footsteps approached the door. There was a knock before a tall and lean woman waltzed in, a leather file in hand.
“To-oony,” Steve moaned out, pressing his ass back for more friction as Tony’s free hand spread his bum cheeks apart, exposing his entrance completely. In a swift motion, Tony darted his tongue along the inside of one of Steve’s cheeks, rasping it over the slightly textured skin there.
“You’re so beautiful,” Tony said softly, his eyes large and gleaming as he looked at his love. Steve could feel all the love and adoration Tony had for him in that gaze of his. Steve sealed his lips with the brunette, his eyes shutting tightly, feeling the sensation of their mouths meshing and their tongues glazing over the other. He barely felt the genius’s hand trail down his back and to his bum until the man squeezed the super soldier’s bum. Steve hummed delightedly, brushing his cheek against Tony’s as he wiggled under his beloved’s hand.
"Hey," the brunette greeted, extending a hand. "Nick Fury sent me." Steve stared blankly at the other man, shaking his hand firmly.
“Touch yourself for me?” Tony asked, head falling against the back of the couch, eyes half-lidded as he watched the blonde bobbing up and down on his length.
That was until Steve had missed a family that was right in the line of fire. The heat that ebbed off the civilians’ bodies had been picked up by the beast, and it turned to engulf them. Without a second thought, Steve ran up the beam of a broken crane, leaping into the jaws of the beast, shield held in front of him. Instantaneously, the creature lurched back and away from the family before it snapped its jaws shut, encapsulating Steve within.
“Yes. I was wondering if you had seen Tony around at all?” He asked, scratching the back of his head in a nervous gesture. Why was he nervous? Bruce wasn’t going to know Steve’s hidden feelings for Tony just by asking if he’d seen him. Steve quickly brought his hand down to his side, attempting to act casual.
Tony cleaned Steve up then, wiping his come from the man’s bum as well as running a wash cloth down Steve’s body. Once he cleaned himself up as well, Steve and he buried themselves under the soft covers, J.A.R.V.I.S shutting the lights off for the couple. Steve laid his head on Tony’s chest, his one hand, tracing the metal ring that held the arc reactor in place. He knew Tony felt embarrassed, maybe even self-conscious of the arc reactor. But Steve saw its beauty. It represented Tony’s genius, his heart.
The obscene noises that left Steve only made the genius’s need for him that much more urgent as he got himself into place behind him.
“Uhn,” was all Tony could really say, hearing Steve tell him to come as well as the need for release being too great.
“Can you understand what I am saying to you, merman?” the man asked, and Steve took in a deep breath before nodding.
“And I love you most,” Steve whispered, kissing his boyfriend’s arc reactor through the fabric of his shirt, the blue glow lighting the cloth in a perfectly circular shape.
Either way, Tony should have looked away right after. Instead, he watched Steve walk to grab his belongings, the brunette’s eyes taking in the plush curve of his bum underneath that too small of a towel, wet and drawn taut around his hips.
“Doctor Banner was extremely kind to take care of me,” Steve said, his eyes following Tony’s movements. “I should be all right to leave by tomorrow morning, I dare say.”
Tony had been so pliant as they played around, allowing Steve to move them how he wanted. But then, like a bear awaking from a winter’s nap, Tony sprang to life, grabbing Steve and clinging to him, holding the blonde possessively.
Tony closed his eyes as well, the rise and fall of Steve’s gorgeous chest lulling him to sleep, the man’s heartbeat a relaxing, constant rhythm that reminded Tony of the calmness of the ocean waves as they sloshed upon the sand.
Regulating his breathing, Tony slowly opened his eyes, his orgasm causing him to see stars for a moment. He pulled his finger free and grabbed his shirt to wipe his hands on. He watched Steve all the while, the man’s chest heaving and glimmering from his sweat and come.
“Right, month. See it hasn’t been the easiest month. Lots of shit has been going on and I’ve been so busy with work,” he babbled on. Maybe he wasn’t as good a liar as he thought. “Can I come in, please? I feel like I’m trying to sell you a vacuum or something.” It took Steve a minute to react before he stepped aside and held the door open for the brunette.
“Oh, okay,” Steve replied softly, brow furrowed as if he didn’t know why Tony was being so curt. “Well, I’ve missed you,” he continued then, brushing a hand through his blonde hair. “I’m glad we were able to get a chance to talk.”
"I was so worried," Tony said softly. "I-I saw you dead, in a vision some hundred and fifty years ago," Tony added. "I was too late for you then, but Steve." Tony gently brought Steve's hand up to his lips, kissing his knuckles. "I am here now. And I will never in all that I am able, let anything happen to you again," Tony vowed. "That's my oath to you." Steve smiled weakly, his eyes glossy.
In a flash though Tony had him on his back, the brunette between his legs. He said not a word as the genius slid his erection back into the super soldier, hiking his knees over his shoulders. Steve grunted when Tony reentered him, his hole now sore. Oh, but how could that matter when the love of his life, the man that was his future was gazing at him, as if he was the rarest gem in in the world, the most beautiful man alive. Tony captured Steve’s lips, his tongue exploring Steve’s mouth messily. The blonde hummed against the genius’s moth, licking at the man’s ruby, kiss bitten lips. Holding the back of Steve’s head in a masculine hand, Tony rocked his hips into the man, pulling out completely. Steve could hear the wetness of their bodies coming together, envisioning Tony slipping inside his glistening reddened hole. All of those visages as well as the love that pierced into his chest and heart every time Tony sunk into him fully had Steve becoming hard once more. It hurt, his fourth erection straining, his ass sore from what it had been subjected to. And yet, Steve could feel warm tears slither down his cheeks and temples as they fell into his hairline.
Steve opened his eyes, dark and glistening with lust still. Each kiss Tony planted on his skin grounded him back to the present, the euphoric state of his orgasm fading away. Once Steve could think semi straight, he wrapped his arms around Tony and pulled him up so that he could kiss him, his tongue dipping into the brunette’s mouth, tasting himself. It was a primitive notion, but it made his softened penis jerk in interest once more; Tony wasn’t lying about the three orgasms.
Steve handed out Tony’s presents to his fellow Avengers. He didn’t see one for him, and that surely did sting. Steve had hoped that even though their feelings weren’t mutual, they’d still be close friends. Wishful thinking, he guessed.
“Gotcha,” Tony said, looking at anything but Steve. He was so close to telling Steve how he felt. But how could he do that when he was schmoozing with that blonde chick. Tony could assume that she was the one who had Steve’s affections. Tony wasn’t blind nor naïve.
They both took a minute to adjust, Tony leaning down, grasping the sheet on either side of Steve’s head before kissing the blonde rather sloppily. The men moaned into each other’s mouth, lips roaming over the other, tongues a warm, wet glide. It was after a few heavy moments that the stretch and burn turned into sweet friction, and all Steve wanted was for Tony to start moving.
“Hey,” he whispered to Tony, smiling kindly at him. “I get it, I understand your worries and concerns, my love,” Steve said. “But I trust you, Tony. I know you would never hurt me. You are too selfless to think of yourself before others.” The genius gave a shaky breath. “Look at me, Tony,” Steve requested quietly. The brunette finally did then, and the blonde continued on. “I promise if you do anything I don’t like or am not okay with, I will say ‘lavender.’ Alright?”
It wasn’t from the pain, for though it hurt, being with Tony, their love and tenderness superseded that physical pain.
“Gee, thanks, Tony,” Steve said sassily after a moment, trying to ignore the feel of the hard metal of Tony’s suit pressed into the flesh of his back.
“It’s all dawning on you now, isn’t it?” Pepper responded, shaking the brunette from his subtle revelation. Tony just blinked at her.
“You know you wanna come for me, Steve,” Tony said with a sharp breath, teasing the tight nipples on the other man’s pecs, only to then trial his fingers over to the strap on one of Steve’s shoulders, feeling the soft scratch of the delicate lace under his fingertips. Tony then slid it down till it fell around Steve’s large bicep, the neckline falling with it, and Steve hummed, head tilting back against Tony’s shoulder. He could smell the man’s sandalwood body wash from the late showers Tony often took when he lost track of time down in his lab. It ebbed off his tawny skin in subtle wafts, comforting Steve in ways only Tony could.
“Nah,” Tony said, leaning back in his chair. “I owe it to you most. Plus, could you imagine all of us trying to agree on one thing?” Tony laughed. Steve chuckled too, looking down at his mostly empty plate.
“Here,” The blonde began, lifting his boyfriend with all the strength he could muster, moving them both up the bed, Tony on his side, facing him. Steve could feel his opening quiver when Tony’s softened penis slipped out of him, causing the super soldier to gently hiss out at the emptiness he suddenly felt. He was rather raw as well, his hole aching, his length overly sensitive to even the air that slowly swirled around them.
Tony’s eyes were shut tight as he continued to pulse his hips into Steve till there was nothing left. The super soldier darted his tongue into Tony’s open mouth, inhaling the man’s sharp moans until Tony began to kiss him back, their chests heaving against each other.
All of the Avengers knew Steve was upset, knew why the super soldier sulked around all week and moped like Eeyore when he loses his tail. The headlines were everywhere;
“What?” Steve asked, an eyebrow raised as he turned in Tony’s arms until he faced the brunette and they were chest to chest.
It was Tony who finally looked down, the fight draining from him. “Pepper, I-I’m sor-” Tony began before she cut him off.
Steve realized with Natasha staring at him expectantly that he never answered her. “Oh, no of course not” he said quickly, readjusting himself on the couch cushion, tucking his feet under him while she perused the channels and movie selection. They settled on a Disney film, something to bring back a childhood innocence lost long ago. He sent a quick text to Tony, asking if he could video chat him tonight. Tony had replied with an ‘of course!’ a smiley face attached, causing Steve to smile dotingly at the message screen on his phone like a besotted teenager.
The beautiful blonde had been gone for a week, on a meeting to discuss new Avengers business. Tony had wanted to go as well, but only because he had suggested they look into adding this whiz kid from Queens with some web slinging hero alias. Tony believed that the teenager had the spirit and selflessness to work alongside them. But the brunette was busy with other things; Stark Industries business and all that jazz. So, they’d been apart for a week, which was absolutely preposterous in Tony’s eyes.
“Oh, Tony,” Steve moaned sweetly, his hands falling to grab at the fabric beneath him, his fingers curling and uncurling into the sheets. He bucked up against Tony, letting the brunette feel how hard Steve was for him already, his erection pressing at the other man’s bare belly. The brunette responded with a low growl, nipping at Steve’s nipple as he began to massage at the other one with his fingertips.
"Knocked out cold, Steve," Natasha added. "We've managed to get the docents and other employees of the museum to mark off this room until you were feeling alright."
“You see that one there? See how it burns slightly red?” Steve asked the other man, pointing to the star on the left.
Sitting them up, Tony practically sat in Steve’s lap as he toyed with the hem of his boyfriend’s shirt. In no time at all, Tony hiked the cotton fabric over Steve’s head, discarding it to the floor, allowing himself to take in his fill of Steve’s naked torso.
“Well take my word for it, that’s what they all do. So what do you say, Cap?” Tony asked, looking at the blonde hopefully. Steve looked at him, the cheekiest grin spreading across his face then.
Steve’s cheeks and chin were wet and glistening with his own saliva and Tony’s precome as he swallowed continuously around the brunette’s length. He didn’t care how messy he was, his forehead dampening with sweat as he worked Tony’s cock slowly out of his mouth. The blonde took the man’s erection in hand, his lips tingling from being stretched around Tony’s girth, and began to stroke his love, his tongue laving at the fat tip of his penis. Without warning he plunged forward, his eyes looking up to Tony, innocently locking with the brunette’s as he hollowed his cheeks and moaned lowly.
The rest of the speech went on with Sharon talking about Peggy co-founding S.H.I.E.L.D and why they did. Tony tried to pay attention though he practically knew all this information anyways. All he could really do was think about how Steve was sucking face with Peggy’s Goddamned niece.
Tony kept fucking Steve as the super soldier was milked dry, the man’s opening probably overly sensitive at this point. The blonde was breathing hard, his eyes shut as he swayed on Tony who was quick to grab him up in his arms, guiding him to the bed, lying beside him. He was still painfully hard, and he really wanted to lay Steve on his back and spill his release into him. But the man was spent, his breath mere whimpers; Tony could wait. He brushed his hands through the blonde’s hair comfortingly. Steve was beyond too good for him, and yet here they were, drowning each other in pure love.
“Thank you, sir,” Steve replied, shaking the man’s hand. With that, Jerry told them where the better places for fishing were as well as where there weren’t as many people, and the two men headed out towards the streams.
He wasn’t going to deny that this was all unexpected, though Steve could admit that he wasn’t surprised. For as long as they’d been together, Steve and Tony hadn’t made love. They had been so busy as of late that they barely had time to talk and maybe kiss, let alone anything else. Also, Steve felt that both he and Tony were apprehensive about taking their relationship to the next level. It wasn’t that they didn’t want to, before things got too hectic, they’d shared enough heated kisses for Steve to know that both he and Tony reacted similarly to their touches. But the whole man on man romance was new for them both. And hell, sex in general was new to Steve.
The brunette refrained from bucking into Steve, not wanting to be too rough too fast and cause his love to tear. But dammit, Tony wouldn’t deny how overwhelming all this was, Steve being so hot around him, his channel tight while he looked like a ravaged mess, his beautiful chest heaving, his red, fully aroused penis oozing white precome along his belly. And the noises the blonde made, so sweet, breathy and sultry were slowly undoing Tony’s mental strength to keep it together.
“I love you, Steve. You’re the best thing in my life,” Tony whispered, his breath warm and comforting against Steve’s skin. Steve flushed at the man’s sweet words, placing his hands over Tony’s, who had linked his fingers under Steve’s chest. Steve tilted his head so that he could capture Tony’s lips with his own, engulfing the brunette in a heady, searing kiss.
The blonde stared at him a moment before smiling back. “And how can I say no to that face,” Steve said, complying to Tony’s request, making brunette’s smile widen even more. Tony grabbed Steve’s waist and pulled him to the side of the bed. He stood then, guiding Steve to kneel on the bed before he pressed the man’s back flush against his chest. Steve let his head fall back, resting in the crook of Tony’s neck as he raised a hand into his dark tussled hair.
“It’s just. He’s Tony,” Steve sighed, going over to sit on his bed. “He flourishes in the spotlight,” Steve remarked. “There are bound to be countless women fighting for his attention, to link their arm with his.”
“Pepper and I broke up,” Tony confessed, his eyes wandering from Steve’s blue ones to stare at the wall behind him.
Tony’s breathing was quickening at the astounding sight of Steve masturbating, and soon enough he couldn’t hold off. Grasping roughly around his own aroused cock, Tony sighed in relief at his touch, stroking himself languidly as he watched Steve.
Soon, Steve and Tony were stripped from their clothing, laying naked in Tony's large bed. They were both nervous and excited, the blonde and brunette new to this same sex relationship. And yet, they felt a rush of calm, knowing that this closeness of their bond was unique, beautiful and pure. They explored one another, Steve kissing Tony's inner thighs, his tongue finding its way to the man's groin. Tony was beside himself with pleasure as he watched Steve's mouth, pink and wet move over his erection.
Steve smiled and did grabby hands at the brunette until he obliged, climbing into bed and working his way up to the blonde with a predator’s gaze. He scooped Steve into his arms, laying them both on their sides as they held each other close.
“Damn!” Tony shouted then, the screwdriver slipping off the small wooden plate he was loosening and hitting him right in his injured palm.
Opening the sleek grey box, he had discreetly placed in there before he and Tony went out, Steve rifled through the tissue paper to pull out a silky fabric, light as air. It was a deep purple slip, made for men but still feminine and delicate in appeal. An inch black lace trim embellished the slip around the sweetheart neckline and hem. Slipping the fabric over his head, Steve let it fall around his taut and muscular frame, the hem swishing gently against his upper thighs. The garment also came with a pair of panties the same purple silk as the slip, a small black satin bow nestled at the back of the waistline. He turned to see himself in the large mirror by the porcelain sink, taking in the hard contours of his muscles and how it balanced with the beautiful soft fabric that draped over them. He couldn’t help but smile at how he looked, the fabric barely covering over the plush curve of his bum.
He took up the chocolate sauce this time, dipping fingers of one of his hands into the contents to scoop out the now half gone bottle. He slid that hand back around to Steve’s rump, fingers slithering to his tight hole. He fingered the man’s opening, massaging the slightly textured skin around it before tracing over the smooth rim. Steve lurched forward and Tony smiled, wiggling the pad of a chocolate coated finger inside the man.
Tony, feeling as if he had met these warrior soulmates at some point was obviously a byproduct of lack of sleep, and so Tony brushed it away. He needed to go back to bed. But his mind whirred, and the brunette could not shake himself from the vivid dream. He had never been hung up on the subconscious thought he had until that night.
Still, that didn’t mean he loved him romantically. It was a strong bond between friends. Which was why when he saw that beast snap its jaws shut around Steve, his stomach dropped and his chest became tight. He thought he was about to lose someone else near and dear to him. He couldn’t believe Steve had done that. Well, that wasn’t true, the man jumped out of quinjets and planes without parachutes. Yet, Tony felt entirely helpless in that moment, as he hovered in the air, just watching. It was only when Steve was falling that Tony refocused, flying down as fast as he could to catch the man. He wasn’t sure if Steve realized it, but it had been a close one. With the blonde’s weight and momentum, he just about took Tony down with him when he caught him.
Tony watched as one of the thin spaghetti straps of Steve’s lingerie slipped from the blonde’s shoulder, settling on the strong curve of his bicep. The movement caused the silky fabric of the neckline to fall, exposing the pink, hard nub of a nipple. Tony wasted no time leaning in and licking the pebbled flesh then, pulling at it with his teeth. He heard Steve’s gasps, low and breathy as he pushed his chest forward for Tony to nip at the skin more, wanting more. Tony obliged, pulling away to slip the other strap down and taunt the other freshly exposed nipple. “T-Tony” Steve stuttered out, head falling forward as he watched his boyfriend body worship him.
It took a minute for Tony to respond, his head swimming with heated lust. “Umm, no it’ll be fine. C’mon Steve, want your tongue on me,” he said, shimmying on the couch a little. The blonde smiled, uncapping the bottle and slowly pouring it, the chocolate sliding out and falling onto Tony’s chest in long linear patterns as Steve moved it around. When he felt there was enough coating the genius’s defined torso did Steve put the bottle aside, leaning back down to lap at the chocolate.
With his eyes roaming over the man’s image, Tony eyed Steve’s insane shoulder to hip ratio, remembering how he took note of it when the blonde walked out in his towel at the Bed and Breakfast. He could picture how the muscles shifted under his creamy skin as he grabbed his change of clothes. Tony let out a frustrated noise, swiping the super soldier’s image away.
Steve was beside himself with pleasure, though he wished Tony would relent and breach him fully with his tongue. He could feel the man hum, the vibration against his skin making the blonde release a strangled whine. Steve felt his boyfriend take hold of his hips then, wrenching Steve back, burying his face between his cheeks and finally sheathing his tongue within the blonde. The warm slickness of it brushed along his channel walls, Tony’s lips nudged against his wet rim.
Padding through the communal lounge, Steve wasn’t even to the kitchen before he was hit with the smell of smoky, and pungent bacon. He caught sight of Tony then, his dark hair ruffled and his back to Steve as he stood in front of the stove.
“This is so wonderful,” Tony whispered, and Steve placed a soft kiss to the back of his boyfriend’s neck in response, resting his cheek there. They then took turns washing each other, Steve maneuvering around to face his love before gently massaging his fingers into Tony’s scalp, the shampoo creating white soapy peaks in his hair.
Eventually Tony went off to work on his projects, Pepper coming down at one point to talk of business matters. Yet, Tony's mind kept falling to the soulmate story, and if that meant he would have a soulmate all his own. It was as if his childhood self and the innocent hope he once had reappeared inside his heart once again.
He climaxed shortly after too, when his beloved’s body constricted around him. Tony’s eyes were pinned to the reflection in the mirror, watching as Steve’s face contorted into an expression of ecstasy. His brows arched up, mouth parting, and his breath heavy while his skin glistened with a thin coating of sweat.
Steve’s moans were coming in pants as he gave himself to Tony, cradling the man’s face and kissing him back heatedly. He was downright bouncing on Tony’s slick cock, wanting each buck of the genius’s hips to fill him up. Steve felt Tony’s hands back on his ass, gripping him tightly and angling Steve’s hips so that he could pound into his channel from a different position. And Steve was all too grateful for it too; Tony’s engorged penis was now brushing against his prostate with each thrust inside Steve.
Steve breathed in relief, the underwear had been just a bit too snug for his hardened arousal, and couldn’t seem to have focused as much on his beloved with the fabric painfully rubbing on his body. Tony slipped the panties the rest of the way off and tossed them to the floor before reaching for a lubricant in the nightstand.
When the Battle of New York was over, Steve moved to Washington DC, working at S.H.I.E.L.D headquarters with Natasha, visiting Peggy and meeting a fellow vet while doing his usual workout routine every morning.
Tony laid in bed that night, the glass of scotch he brought with him still full as it sat on his bed side table. He was wide awake, eyes open and staring at the ceiling as he mulled over all of Pepper’s words. He couldn’t wrap his mind around the fact that she believed he loved Steve. It was preposterous! They were good friends, both of them straight. How could something blossom between them? It wasn’t possible.
“Don’t worry, baby. I just need to figure out how to get this contraption off you,” Tony said lightly, turning Steve on his side. The blonde had to direct him, Tony fiddling with the clasps at the back until it finally released. Tony beamed in accomplishment until he noticed the buckles that were still connected to Steve’s thigh highs, and he sighed dramatically. “Damn, this is more complicated than it should be,” Tony huffed as he undid the clips.
“So, what’d you get,” Bruce asked Tony, sidling up to the genius out of nowhere. Startled, Tony looked to the quiet scientist, clutching the box like a vice to his chest.
“Let me,” Tony bit out, reaching up and caressing his hands over Steve’s firm pectorals as he started to roll his hips up into his lover with renewed fervor. Steve was beside himself with absolute euphoria while he bounced on Tony’s cock, the swollen head nudging at his prostate. He held himself upright, keeping his hands on Tony’s sweat laden chest.
“Come baby, let me feel you,” The blonde whimpered out between raspy cries and moans, his mouth sinking to Tony’s neck. He sucked at that tawny skin, the blood vessels breaking from the pressure to leave a perfect love bruise.
The two men kissed for a while, their minds becoming lost to merely sensuous touch and sound. Tony eventually coaxed Steve to lay on his belly, the brunette laying on his side next to him.
Once he composed himself, Steve grabbed up his basket and headed to the floor right below the penthouse (his floor), to get his Easter basket for Tony. He put it together quickly before heading back to the elevator, asking J.A.R.V.I.S to make it so that nobody would be able to get onto the elevator while he was inside. His and Tony’s relationship wasn’t secret, their fellow Avenger’s knew, but nobody besides Tony obviously knew of Steve’s appreciation of wearing lingerie. Steve intended for it to stay that way.
“What’s the name of the place?” Tony asked. He’d be sure to pay all her expanses. Even if she tried to tell him no. But she told him the place, sniffling and wiping her nose on the handkerchief he had offered her as they entered the elevator.
Reaching a hand up, Tony brushed some of her lovely, light hair from her eyes, nestling it behind her ear before wiping a tear off her cheek. He let his thumb caress her small chin, feeling the delicate skin there. “I am so damn sorry, Pepper.” The woman just nuzzled into his touch, looking up to him with glistening, wet eyes.
Tony drifted his hand from Steve’s chin to his cheek, and the super soldier leaned into his touch, closing his eyes and breathing lightly. The man’s touch was so warm. He was overwhelmed with a sudden joyous emotion, knowing that Tony mirrored his affections. They could have this, a relationship that was more than just friendship and teammates. Opening his eyes, Steve held Tony’s gaze that was filled with an uncanny adoration.
“And why would I want to stop touching you?” Tony challenged, smirking darkly and reaching back up to rub Steve’s arousal.
“Don’t worry, I just wanna open you up like this,” he assured Steve. When they made love this way, Steve always wanted to face Tony, to watch the brunette’s face when he orgasmed. Steve obliged then, shifting on his stomach, his lingerie swishing against the comforter. He spread his legs once more, leaning on his elbows so he could turn and see his boyfriend. Tony smiled and gently patted Steve’s gorgeously round bum as a way of thanking him for changing position. Working his way between Steve’s legs, leaning in to bite at the muscular shoulders of his love, Tony couldn’t help but to think of how happy he was to have Steve in his life. Not just as fellow avengers, but as boyfriends, lovers, soulmates.
“Nick,” Tony said before leaning in against Steve once more, kissing his hole. And he heard the man bite back a moan, trying to be as discreet as possible. Tony snickered lightly, burying his face back between Steve’s cheeks, suckling on the wet rim.
Steve was purely joyful in that moment, being wildly made love to by the man he would soon call his husband.
“There now,” Tony said, leaning back on his heels. “Tip top shape. Let’s get you back into the water, huh?” The merman smiled and nodded at that. But when the inventor wrapped an arm under the blonde creature’s shoulder and lifted, the merman let out an ear-piercing scream. Tony bowed under the creature’s shifted weight, his feet slipping. The inventor’s gloved hand caught against the merman’s tail, the cyan scales slicing through the dark leather like butter and slicing his palm. Tony grunted in pain, holding his injured hand. He could hear the crew members running toward them, but Tony turned his attention back to the sea creature who was cradling the upper right side of his tail.
Tony loved touching Steve this way, feeling every dip and curve of his muscles, shifting under soft skin. His lover was whimpering at the sultry caresses Tony indulged him in, wanting more of the glorious pressure of the brunette’s hands.
Steve’s eyes had been closed briefly, and when he opened them, he saw his love watching him, his dewy brown eyes captivating. That look alone was enough to make Steve catch his breath, even after all they had done.
The couple cleaned unhurriedly, putting their dirtied plates and utensils in the kitchen’s dishwasher and chatting lightly.
“I’ve got your back, Ferris,” Tony said with an easy smile, and Steve’s chest flooded with warmth, knowing that Tony had remembered the story he told him those few months ago.
“Mhmm,” Steve murmured, his penis coming to attention once again as Tony’s fingers slicked up his hole once more, making sure Steve was prepared enough for Tony to take him.
“No reason to fret, Steve,” Tony assured him. “I just want our doctor to watch over you for a small while until your wounds are healed some. If you enter the ocean now, I fear that predators would swarm you within moments.” Tony looked at him with genuine worry, which Steve truly appreciated. But Steve needed to get back to his group and warn them of the humans that were passing above their home. He also didn’t feel safe on this ship unless Tony was with him. Surely the man had other things to do besides play nanny to an injured sea creature.
An hour later, Tony was in his laboratory, working on Iron Man suit number, well he wasn’t really sure at this point. But it was getting up there, into the thirties probably.
Tony tensed under him, his breath a hiss as he inhaled sharply, only to exhale with a desperate moan on his lips. Steve knew how much his boyfriend enjoyed having oral sex done to him, liked seeing Steve on his knees, cheeks hollowing as he suckled and bobbed up and down on his swelling cock. And so, Steve indulged the man, humming around the genius’s arousal, slowly dipping Tony’s penis deeper into his mouth. Steve didn’t want to toot his own horn, but he had gotten pretty good at blow jobs. All thanks to Tony of course.
With that said, he decided to follow the crowd and embrace the holiday of love. It was his and Tony’s first Valentine’s day together as a couple, and Steve wanted to show his love just how much he meant to him.
“S-sorry, Mister Stark sir,” one of the crew men began finally, taking off his hat and twisting it in an anxious grip. “W-we had made purchase of some fishing equipment for when we return to our usual occupations as fisherman.”
Both men were startled when the door to the maintenance closet opened to reveal an elderly gentleman with slicked back grey hair and dressed in a blue janitor’s uniform. “Oh, I’m sorry. Am I interrupting something?” The man asked, looking rather confused. “I just need that cloth broom behind you, son,” he continued, pointing to Tony.
“Thank you, Pep,” the brunette said, giving a small smile to his assistant. “I’m going to take a pause from this,” Tony started then, gesturing to his workspace. “I’ll get some fresh air and look over the rest of the agreement document.” Pepper thought that was a grand idea as well, and headed off to her quarters of the ship to look through her own documents that needed tended to for their company.
Steve’s cheeks were flushed, his hair disheveled as Tony held him tight working his whole finger into the man. Steve was unbearably tight, and Tony tried to be slow, but the blonde wasn’t being patient, grinding his hips down hard and riding Tony’s finger, wanting the man to find his sweet spot.
Tony was on that brink of electric bliss, his movements jerking as his thighs quivered from exertion. Steve managed to grab a hold of the genius’s shoulder and pull him down, Tony losing his footing momentarily. The blonde kissed and licked at Tony’s lips, arching up against his boyfriend’s masculine chest, his dark facial hair tickling his chin. He threaded his fingers into the man’s dark tresses, tugging at it enough to yank another whine of ecstasy from Tony.
Tony could feel Steve shaking, his muscles twitching while he slipped his tongue inside the man, loosening the ring of the blonde’s rim. Tony adored making love to his boyfriend, enjoyed absolutely everything they did. Rimming was one of those acts that was so intimate and erotic. How Steve responded to it, so beside himself and needy, made Tony feelover the moon.
Once more, Steve tried to imagine the toy inside him, nudging closer to his prostate and fitting snuggly against the sensitive walls of his entrance. He thought of how the obscene image of the remaining beads looked hanging from his backside, and Tony looking at all in approval, seeing the blonde absolutely ruined and desperate for more of Tony’s sensuous touches.
“Yes, Tony,” he breathed, his voice confident and sure. With that then, Tony ensued his melodic actions. He pulled out of Steve slowly, grunting as he thrusted back into the man. The blonde whimpered, his fingers digging into his skin while he held his legs wide.
Steve had managed to venture out into the city within the next few days. At first he was nervous, naturally and understandably so. But soon the super soldier’s nerves turned into curiosity, and Steve found himself exploring the twenty-first century in awe and wonder. there were things about the world that remained the same too. The culture of America, both good and bad; the diligence of a nation, technology and expansion. The prejudice of those different to what was socially, and culturally acceptable... sadly that had not changed since Steve went under the ice.
“So what’s the real reason why you have been avoiding everyone?” Steve asked, closing door behind them. Tony locked eyes with Steve, taking a deep breath then.
“Good, you’re so good, Steve.” Tony whispered, suckling at the back of Steve hip until a purplish bruise surfaced on his beloved’s creamy skin. The super soldier didn’t say much, merely grumbling happily before flopping into the sheets that were now wet and sticky from his come.
"Brucie, I need to ask you something" Tony said out of nowhere one day as the two men worked in their community lab.
Tony had to bite his lip hard as his beloved constricted around his entire length, so that he wouldn’t fall over the edge as well. He wanted to hold off as long as possible, to come alongside the super soldier in the next round. His own body quaked with desperation, but the brunette didn’t want their perfect evening to end. Not when he had waited a week to see Steve and have him in his arms.
“Nonsense,” Tony responded, his sultry voice possessive, his breath puffing against the blonde’s backside. Steve felt his love’s hands lifting the night before sliding over each cheek of Steve’s ass. Tony’s dull nails dug into that taut flesh as the super soldier hummed at the sensation, his mind flooding with images of Tony touching him.
During one of Steve’s explorations through the city, the blonde sat outside a local cafe, sketching a bit while sipping at a bold brewed coffee. He had a newspaper with him from that morning, though he had not read through it yet. He was in the midst of drawing the architectural landscape ahead of him when he decided to take a break and read the local listings. There was no rush, and Steve unhurriedly read the articles, some not so exciting, and others enthralling.
“So, Steven Grant Rogers, my greatest love, would you take my hand in matrimony? And let me spend the rest of my days with you?”
Tony groaned at the sight of Steve touching himself, it was so fucking hot, how the thick, firm muscles moved under his hands. The brunette stroked him quickly, every once and a while thumbing at the head, digging his nail into the slit there. Steve lurched into his touch, gasping loudly as he continued to tug on his nipples and stroke the underside of his pectorals.
“Happy Easter, Tony,” Steve said, smiling a toothy grin before pressing a kiss against the man’s prickly jaw.
"Please, Steve... I need you," Tony whimpered, caressing the man's mark with delicate, loving fingertips.
Slowly, Tony massaged Steve’s hole, removing his fingers one at a time and feeling the spent ring of muscle flutter around the digits until it was fully relaxed.
Steve’s coat was soaked, the dark fabric heavy on him as he dodged a snowball from Clint. He didn’t hear Tony shout “look out!” until it was too late and he careened into the man, both of them tumbling to the snow laden ground.
“It will be,” he agreed, nestling his cheek in against Tony’s and holding him close. “You’re amazing,” he whispered, and he meant it entirely. Tony was one of the best things in his life, and he’d be sure to remind the man of it every single day.
“What’re you sketching?” Tony asked, changing the subject. If Steve was eyeing someone up, his battle was already lost. Steve looked down, adding a few more strokes of the pencil before closing it.
“You didn’t have to find me an apartment, Tony,” Steve said then, turning to face the man who was still on the opposite side of the room. “I know you don’t want me around anymore, what with me revealing how I really feel about you and all,” he continued. “You didn’t have to push me out the door though, and say it was
Then, Steve felt a sensation quite foreign to him, a sweet thrum of heat and relaxation flooding inside him. He looked down to see Tony pulling out the anal beads, one by one ever so slowly. “How’s that feel?” Tony inquired, watching Steve’s reaction as he moved the toy out of his entrance.
“Feels so good,” Steve said, lips nuzzled against Tony’s ear. “Fuck me, Tony.” Steve moved his lips over the man’s earlobe then, biting and pulling at it between his teeth. He started to shift his hips up and down on Tony, which was what seemed to have brought the genius out of his lust filled paralysis. He held Steve’s waist in his hands, pinning the man down against him as he started to work his hips into a cadence, slowly thrusting up into Steve.
Curiously, Tony slipped his thumb closer to the seam of Steve’s mouth, and Steve grinned before he gently took Tony’s thumb between his lips, nipping at the pad of the digit teasingly. Watching Tony, the super soldier started sucking on the genius’s thumb, moaning ever so softly as he did.
“That was amazing,” Tony mumbled, his breath warm on Steve’s skin. The blonde nodded, taking a deep breath.
“Love you most, Stevie,” Tony breathed, his voice pitching as the super soldier went to work unfastening the glass buttons that spaced down the brunette’s dress shirt. Tony didn’t say anything as he watched Steve’s fingers move, seeing the light of his reactor spill out once that black fabric fell away. The blonde leaned up, pressing his lips to the glowing blue face of the arc reactor. Though he could not feel the sensation of Steve’s lips on it, Tony still shivered, humbled at how it never bothered Steve, grateful for the way Steve loved all of him, metal bits and all.
"Tony," The man said quickly, taking off his sunglasses with his free hand. "Call me Tony." He dropped his hand then before taking a step into Steve's apartment.
Laying stock still, Steve stared at the ceiling. He reassured himself that this was fine. Friends did this, and Tony said it would be okay. Turning his head slowly, Steve’s eyes skirted up Tony’s frame before settling upon his face. Tony’s features were relaxed, and he hoped the man was having sweet dreams. Steve could hear the low hum of the arc reactor, that beautiful invention that kept Tony’s heart beating. Steve allowed himself to appreciate this moment, sharing a bed with the man he’d fallen for. Even if the feelings were one sided, Steve could at least have this memory to cherish.
After Tony awoke from the surgery and recovered, the brunette tweaked the device that Yensin made, so that instead of it being a magnet keeping him alive, it was an arc reactor, something that his father, Howard had designed and Tony perfected.
“You know, Cap, I think I just heard Rhodey call me. So I’m gonna go…” Tony started, turning as he spoke so he could high tail it outta there. He didn’t get far before the blonde grabbed ahold of his wrist and pulled him through the crowd. A few people looked at them, indiscernible expressions crossing their faces as they went.
It took Tony a second to realize what Steve was getting at before a salacious grin spread across his face. There was something about Steve, sweet, innocent looking Steve having such lovely kinks behind closed doors that made Tony’s heart swell…among other things, and he gave his blonde boyfriend a pat on his plush bum before hopping of the bed.
“I’m the luckiest guy in the world, Tony,” Steve said, nuzzling his cheek against Tony’s, the man’s facial hair rubbing wonderfully along his jawline. Tony’s frantic thrusts settled finally, the man humming happily, holding Steve close to him. “Can’t wait to feel you come inside me,” he added, tone husky.
But, Tony couldn’t will his feet to move, his worries exceeding the yearning to see his friend. So, he plopped back down, thunking his head on the table in defeat.
“I’m kind of nervous about going to this gala,” Steve confessed to Natasha, who straightened the tie of his replica uniform. He still had his old uniform, but even in its impeccably preserved state, natural cotton and wool could only be conserved for so long until the natural fibers broke down.
"I'm really not feeling the workout today guys," Tony said with a yawn. Steve noticed the man looked rather tired. Maybe he did not sleep well.
“I hope it’s a cake big enough to feed an army,” Steve murmured, tilting his face to look at Tony once more. He was dressed in a long black shirt, the sleeves pushed up to his elbows, revealing strong forearms. His dark hair was just a tad bit disheveled, and a spicy sandalwood cologne drifted from Tony’s tawny skin to Steve’s nose, the aroma riveting. Steve would never get over how handsome Tony was. That brought Steve to think again about the lucky lady the genius had his sights on now. He inwardly sighed.
“Oh,” Tony said, thinking about how handsome Steve looked in his button down and dress pants while they were eating dinner at his favorite restaurant. It was the first date they’d gone on in a while, though nobody else could know it was a date; they hadn’t gone public about it besides to their fellow teammates. Still, now knowing what Steve had underneath his trousers, Tony couldn’t help but feel heat flood his belly.
“Something like that. But should it really be any other way?” Steve challenged back, pulling back only to round the couch and stand in front of Tony, showing off his lingerie to the brunette. Steve smirked as he took in Tony’s changing expression. The man’s eyes widening, pupils dilating and a happy smile forming on his lips.
Natasha walked over to the ben then and took a seat next to him. “Besides, he told me he was interested in somebody new.”
Steve awoke to a cool morning sky, the pale, yellow sunrise ascending between the skyline. His alarm went off a moment later, and he yawned, tiredly stretching under the thin cotton sheets like a kitten.
Once they were all clean, the pair readied for bed, Steve slipping into a pair of Tony’s underwear that were a bit too small, his bum cheeks peeking out. It would just have to do, though, he didn’t have any spare clothing in Tony’s bedroom.
“Have you ever been around someone, someone that you saw in a certain light for quite a long time. And then all of a sudden there is a shift, and it’s too late to realize you’ve fallen for them?” Tony asked, his mouth speaking faster than his brain realizing it. Steve stopped drawing then, eyes looking to Tony, his brows furrowed in thought.
Opening his legs, Steve guided Tony back into him. “Go ahead, love,” Steve said softly, eyeing the man and smiling tiredly. That was all Tony needed to let go, bracing his hands on either side of Steve’s head. He began to thrust into a rhythm once more, not being as gentle as the last time though. He pounded into Steve, brutalizing his ass. Rolling his body against Steve’s, feeling the glide from the purple silk, Tony couldn’t help but feel the man’s penis hardening once more. He chuckled to himself; yep, three orgasms. Steve probably could go more, they just never tried. They should, though, someday. This was an important discovery!
“Come on, Tony,” Steve encouraged, swirling his hips and pushing his ass back against Tony’s own hips. “Come for me. Let me feel you in me.”
“You weren’t supposed to be back till the day after tomorrow,’ Steve said softly, feeling Tony’s chest and arc reactor press against his back.
Steve could not help but to yank his beloved close, meshing their lips together sweetly, the love flowing between them coursing through their veins. The blonde raked a hand through the genius’s hair, his mouth sucking at the brunette’s full bottom lip as heat began to kindle in his lower belly. It was not surprising though; they’d been away from each other for far too long. Steve’s longing for Tony had been a tumultuous sea of worry and self-doubt. That feeling of a smooth gold band on his finger let all those concerns fall away though, only for relief and pure happiness to spread and take root within him.
Steve was lost in his thoughts, still standing at the counter in the kitchen of Avengers’ Tower. He shook his head and grabbed his coffee and walked to the living area where multiple sofas and recliner chairs were positioned around a gigantic flat screen TV.
“What’s wrong?” The mermaid asked, poking Steve’s muscular side. The merman snickered before sighing; Natasha knew him well.
“You’re so wonderful, Steve,” Tony breathed, voice gravelly as his body slumped against the chair. He combed a hand through Steve’s hair, appreciating the softness of it. Steve purred in delight at Tony’s touch before he slipped the man’s boxers and pajamas back up to their proper place around his hips.
"Not dead so, I feel like that's a good sign," Steve tried to joke, though it was clear how much of an effort it was for him.
The front desk worker came shortly after they got settled with a tray of food, which the men devoured quickly. Tony had given Steve his apple and bread bun, which Steve really appreciated. His ridiculously fast metabolism could be a curse sometimes.
He’d only made it through half of the space when he entered a large, spacious room, practically knocking him off his feet. It was an art studio, bigger than anything he’d ever dreamed. A whole wall was nothing but glass French windows, giving a cottage like feel to the modern apartment. It would let in a wonderful amount of natural light during the day time, though now it let in the beautiful rays of the moon and stars. An easel was placed in front of the window, a large canvas resting upon it.
“God, you’re so damn hot, Steve. Can I fuck you now? I’m about to explode” Tony asked, his voice strangled.
“You really did have a good time today, right?” Tony queried, the man twisting the sheets of the bed in his hands. Steve watched him, thinking of how he rarely saw Tony so unsure.
“Shall we officially exchange our baskets now?” Tony offered, heading to where the blonde had placed the baskets earlier. Steve let out a sound of dismay, but followed the man like a puppy at his heels. He tried to calm his arousal, but Tony could get him hot bothered so damn fast.
Tony placed a hand over Steve’s though, stilling the blonde’s motions. “I was wondering, love,” Tony began, clearing his throat and meeting Steve’s quizzical gaze. “If you wouldn’t mind leaving them on… for me?” He asked, his voice soft and breathy.
Needless to say, that small thread, so weak and fraying as it tied Steve and Tony together in that altering moment, had broken.
He got his answers when they ended up in a fishing shop in western Pennsylvania, and Steve was staring at the fishing poles that lined the one wall in deep and utter confusion. “You’ve never fished before, have you?” He asked Steve, picking up a fisherman’s hat, furnished with colorful lures.
Tony brought his free hand up to Steve’s chest, tracing his fingertips along his clavicle as he added a second slick finger into him. Steve laid his head against Tony’s shoulder, eyes half lidded as he watched his reflection. Tony loved being able to take Steve apart this way, only to piece him back together with love, affection and sweet kisses. Scissoring his fingers inside his boyfriend, Tony slid his fingers down the crease of where Steve’s pecs met, gliding the palm of his hand over the taut muscles.
Unfortunately, Steve made it a whole twenty minutes down in the gym, punching a heavy bag before he couldn’t take it anymore. He wanted to see Tony, not just because he missed his presence, but because he needed to make sure the man was okay. It wasn’t a big deal, that’s what friends did. But if something was wrong, Steve would be curious to know why Tony hadn’t confided in him about it. He and Tony were close, and whenever something harbored on their shoulders, they would talk to the other about it, knowing that not too many others knew them the way they knew each other.
Steve moved with his boyfriend, feeling the way he pounded into him, loving the pain, loving all of it because it was Tony. He whined each time Tony rubbed against his prostate with the tip of his cock, his eyes pinned on Tony’s face.
“No, Tony. I-I don’t want us to stop,” Steve admitted, holding Tony’s gaze, seeing the man’s pupils dilated. Steve figured his looked the same.
After a quick shower, Steve dressed in nice dark jeans and a form fitting heather grey t-shirt. He couldn’t deny that he liked to look somewhat dashing when he was around Tony. He figured it was a common notion for anyone with a crush on someone to want to look their best.
“Hmm?” the blonde asked, his cheeks flushed, eyes heavy lidded, and his whole body on a love drunk rush.
“Don’t you realize how much of a kink that would be for me?” Tony mock whined, pulling Steve to him, their chests flush together. Steve merely giggled, snuggling his arms around Tony’s shoulders. And Tony poked at his sides, teasing the blonde with tickles, holding onto his blue-eyed boyfriend the best he could. Steve tittered, trying to wiggle away from the man’s teasing touches, though he didn’t try too hard, not really wanting to get away from his beloved’s grasp just yet.
“Yes,” Steve said immediately, grabbing the bottle up and looking at it. “I want to put it on you though, if that’s alright.” It was such a sexy thing to do, he thought, to worship Tony this way, to love him this way. He wanted to taste the man’s skin laced with sweet chocolate, the thought alone making his already hard erection ache.
“Thanks,” Tony murmured, wrapping an arm around Steve’s waist, his fingers brushing along the sheer, delicate fabric there.
“Hi, Tony,” Steve said when they connected, a beautiful pearly smile on his face. Tony really wasn’t ready for the bomb he assumed Steve was gonna drop on him.
“I think we should establish a safe word,” Tony said then, resting his hands on the super soldier’s upper thighs, lovingly caressing the defined muscles that moved under soft, creamy skin. Tony could see that he caught Steve by surprise, his brows furrowing in thought.
“That was a good shower, I figured they’d run out of hot water,” Tony said, stretching his back, his old t-shirt rising to reveal the tawny, taut skin of his belly. Steve’s eyes were glued there a good minute before he looked to Tony’s face, the man smirking at him.
That smile on his face fell flat when he saw the man talking to a pretty, young blonde woman, the lady laughing at something Steve had said. Tony stopped dead in his tracks, his glass of booze almost slipping from his grip as he watched the two interact. The woman sipped at her champagne as Steve spoke, and Tony didn’t approve at how close she was to him. Granted, it was a crowded place. Still, Tony didn’t like it. The female checked her phone then, saying something to Steve before patting the man’s arm and walking away.
It was silent then, and Steve heard the other man’s breathing deepening as he fell into a peaceful slumber. He watched the brunette briefly in the dark shadows of the room, the glow of his arc reactor muted by the heavy sheets.
Steve took a pillow in hand, wrapping his arms around it and laying his head in the crook of his elbow, the fabric cool against his heated skin. Each caress was leaving the super soldier keening, but it was when he felt Tony’s tongue graze his opening that Steve thought he was going to lose his mind, his body exploding with tingly goosebumps.
So, with two fishing licenses, poles, lures, bobbers, three different baits, waders, and some random supplies piled on the counter, Jerry rang them out.
As the months went by, Steve and Tony's friendship grew, co-leading the Avengers helped the men council once another on strategy, tactic and decision making, creating a team of strong, driven heroes, wanting to help the greater good. All this while however, as their friendship became remarkably strong, so had their soulmarks. Yet neither man had admitted this.
Steve gave a few more gentle tugs to his reddening nipples before letting go and leaning out of camera shot. Tony’s brows rose, confused as to what Steve was doing. He understood, though, when he saw Steve holding a bottle of their lube in his hand. Steve flipped open the cap, squirting an exuberant amount of the lubricant on his fingers. Tony would love some of that right now, he had to admit.
Steve eagerly spread his legs for his boyfriend, exposing himself completely for the man he adored. As much as this position made Steve vulnerable, his body on display for Tony, it was exhilarating. He secretly, or not so secretly loved how Tony gazed upon him with a hungry, possessive look in his dark eyes. Steve also knew that Tony enjoyed the control when they made love, to have Steve submit himself to the brunette when they were behind closed doors. Steve thought about how that was just one more area between him and Tony that fit together like that of two puzzle pieces.
?” Tony asked, calling his assistant by her preferred name. He then spotted that folder in her hands. “Is that the dossier of the company?” The inventor spoke before Pepper could. She flicked a curl of golden-red hair over her shoulder before handing Tony the folder and leaning against his work space, careful to not get the skirts of her bustle dress dirty.
Steve was getting hard yet again, and he wanted his boyfriend to partake in the pleasure he already had experienced twice, and craving it still. So, Steve got himself into position, eyes never straying from Tony’s as he seated himself onto the genius’s arousal. Tony shut his eyes and inhaled sharply once Steve was all the way down, the brunette planting his feet into the mattress for leverage, toes curling in desire. Even though Tony had worked him rather loose by this point, Steve still felt like could be torn apart by how big and hot the other man was inside him.
“Eh, fine. I’d rather not talk about them though, Steve,” Tony said, waving a hand. He was trying to desensitize himself from the situation, preparing himself for the worst.
Steve’s gaze fell to his chest again when Tony scraped his nails down them, making small red lines that would fade by the time they went to bed. “Eh-ehn. Yes, please Tony. More,” Steve whined, watching transfixed as the brunette flicked his nipples like a switch, the darkening pink nubs bouncing back into place with each passing swipe. How debauched Steve was, his appearance representing how he felt. He felt full and stretched, loved and claimed. It was all the feelings he yearned for, packaged up with a bow. And it was all because of Tony, the man he deeply loved.
The best thing for him was to spend a few days alone in his lab. He could clear his head while he tinkered. Things would be alright.
“Damn, Steve,” Tony murmured, a sensitive hand finding its way to the ribbon that held Steve’s wrists together. The fabric was just so soft compared to the masculinity of his beloved’s body. “You’re all tied up…do you want me to unwrap you?” Tony asked cheekily, his eyes darkening as he looked at Steve. The blonde nodded eagerly, moving in to kiss Tony passionately. Tony hummed happily, letting Steve’s tongue slip between his teeth. But soon the genius pulled away, resting a hand on his boyfriend’s chest.
Steve traced his hands over Tony’s shoulders, and over his clavicle before slowly drifting the pads of his fingers over his chest. The brunette humming in delight when Steve brushed his nails over the ruddy, pebbled flesh of his nipples. Steve smirked, flicking his gaze to Tony’s and continuing to drift his hands down, sliding his palms along the tawny skin of the man’s lean stomach before hitting the belt and waistband of the genius’s dark wash jeans.
Steve had never felt anything like this before, Tony’s tongue hot and heavy on his entrance. It was such a dirty act, and the image he conjured up of Tony down there, eating him out was almost more than he could bear. He felt Tony hum then, his lips pressed against Steve’s rim as his voice vibrated through the blonde. Steve’s thighs were shaking, and he had to hold them as still as he could while Tony lapped at his hole, his tongue swirling around the ring of muscle there.  Tony brought his hands up, resting them on Steve’s thighs before spreading them and holding them open, so that he could get as close to his boyfriend as possible.
“I love you, Tony,” Steve finally said, breathing lightly as his hands toyed with the elastic waistband of the genius’s pajama pants.
Also, there are a few past quotes in Italics that are from the second installment, "I Wanna Taste Her Lips: Tony's POV"... Incase you haven't read that one, Just know Pepper told Tony those things during their breakup ^-^
“Well, do you still have feelings for this person now? Should I play matchmaker and get you two together?” Tony asked. He’d meant for it to sound like a joke, but even to his ears it sounded sharp and cynical. Steve must have not picked up on it, though.
The merman had been surveying the perimeter of where his pod lived, looking for anything that would be considered suspicious. He, Natasha and their friend Sam were the three protectors of their pod, and it was their duty to report any strange activity to their director, Nick.
Tony was the first to regain his composure, pulling out of Steve, though still holding him closely. The brunette opened his tired eyes, noting the love bite on his beloved. He gave the mark a few soothing kisses, the genius’s tongue darting out and feeling the divots left onto Steve’s beautiful, pale skin.
During that snowball fight, Steve had the fleeting thought that Tony had felt the same way about Steve. The mutual feelings seemed to flow off of each other as they laid there in the snow. The unspoken words had said so much. Steve was waiting for Tony to admit something though, anything that hinted at him having the same romantic feelings for him. But after that Hulk incident, everything went back to the way things were. It must have been the cold getting to Steve’s head.
“Are you seeing someone?” Steve eventually asked, wringing the sheets in his hands, nervous for the answer.
“Yeah, that and your humility really won me over,” Steve added, slowly sitting upright, feeling Tony’s come slide out of his ass. Tony chuckled, leaning in for one more sweet kiss from the blonde before getting up slowly.
Tony had moved off of the blonde, hovering over him just out of reach as he locked his eyes with Steve’s. “There’s a few things on the agenda,” Tony breathed, his one hand settling on the latches of Steve’s bralette.
Steve stirred a bit, bringing Tony back to the present. The brunette looked down to see Steve looking up at him, smiling. Tony smiled back, bringing his hands down to drift up and down Steve’s sides. “You liked that, didn’t you? Seeing yourself while I took control,” Tony said.
“Fuck, Steve,” Tony rushed out, gritting his teeth to fight off his climax. “You like it like this, having me play with you as I fuck you? God you’re so fucking tight.” Steve’s moans were coming faster then as he teetered on the edge.
“What the hell are you doing, boy?” Obadiah Stane bellowed, pulling Tony to his feet. He saw the younger man’s torn glove and bleeding hand and he huffed exasperatedly. “Get him to the infirmary and have him cleaned up,” Stane barked, guiding Tony to their traveling doctor who had been on the deck as well, curious about the commotion.
He had probably been out there for a solid 45 minutes when he heard the front door open, closing with a typical creak. Tony took a seat next to him, saying not a word. And when Steve turned to look at him, the man had Steve’s blanket wrapped around him. Tony looked straight ahead, and Steve took a moment to appreciate his profile, his nose slanting softly until it turned up at the end ever so slightly. His eyes were like liquid pools, big and almost glowing as they captured the light of the moon and stars.
“Oh, Tony,” Steve breathed, spreading his legs and bending his knees so that his beloved had more room to touch him from within.
Soon enough it was Tony’s turn to wash Steve, wiping what remained of the dried mess on his belly. He was careful as he drifted the wash cloth down over his bum and entrance too. Steve was wonderfully aching, and he knew even with his faster healing, the bite of pain would last till tomorrow. Even the love bite on his neck would be a faint bruise. He enjoyed that though, knowing Tony marked him in such a way. The soreness in his backside and the marks upon his skin would be a lovely memory of this precious night.
It was the clearing of Steve’s throat that finally pulled Tony’s eyes away from his loins, looking back to Steve’s blue eyes, his pupils fully dilated.  “Are you just gonna leave me hanging here naked? Or are you gonna get undressed too?” Steve asked, and Tony could detect the hint of worry in his boyfriend’s voice. Quickly he worked his way out of shirt, the arc reactor glowing a cold blue in the warm lit hotel suite. He saw Steve smile widely then, his cock twitching in excitement. Tony was pretty sure he could have come right then and there just by looking at the blonde.
“And besides,” Steve added as Tony grabbed up the lubricant once again, dribbling the gel on the remaining few beads. “I’m the one who bought the anal beads.” Tony simply chuckled at that, his features lightened by the blue arc reactor’s glow. “So, I think I know what to expect,” Steve concluded with a grin, and the genius smiled back at Steve dotingly.
"Hey, Tony," Steve said, making sure to stand straight and stoic. He ignored the pain in his shoulder, ignoring the way the genius rubbed at his own shoulder.
Tony made a strangled noise, digging his nails into his thighs as he watched Steve acting so damn dirty. And the way he looked, so innocent as he did it nearly made him come undone. “Holy shit, Steve,” Tony said when he was able to use his vocal chords again. “What’re you trying to do to me?” he asked while grabbing up the lube once more.
“Well, this couldn’t be Loki’s doing,” Natasha murmured, and they all nodded, remembering how Thor had told them his brother had been killed on a realm none of them could pronounce.
“Oh, okay,” Steve replied. “Did you want to talk about anything?” Tony just shook his head with a neutral smile.
“Gotta say, Steve. You can wear my clothes whenever you want,” Tony commented, squeezing the blonde’s rump and chuckling low. Steve laughed too, leaning in to peck Tony on the nose.
"Yes, Tony," Steve cooed, eagerly pulling the brunette's shirt up and over his head. Tony found Steve's mouth again, a hand cradling the blonde's head, the other tracing the musculature of chest. He was pleasantly surprised and even a bit proud when Steve moaned so sweetly from Tony rubbing at his petal pink nipples.
“I think you’re blind to your feelings, Tony” Pepper said coolly, placing her mostly full cup on the counter.
“I thought I was the assertive one,” Tony joked, breathing deeply, regaining some sense of composure. He was terribly sensitive, and if he entered Steve too fast, everything would be over before it really started…and that was just unacceptable.
“Couldn’t make a life with darling Peggy, so you’ve settled on her niece,” Tony said as if it was obvious, his voice slightly laced with displeasure. “Sharon, she’s the girl you’ve been swooning over the past few months.” It was then that Sharon sidled up next to the two men as Tony continued. “It’s okay, you’re just going down the bloodline. I don’t know if Peggy would approve but-”
Steve locked his eyes with his beloved’s once again, a third finger swirling its way into his now soft, compliant opening. The genius saw Steve push his rump greedily down onto his lithe digits, the need to be filled and full obvious. Steve didn’t even need to say anything then, for Tony knew his boyfriend and his precedent needs better than anyone else. He knew Steve was losing focus, was getting close.
“We could always just hang out here. I don’t mind,” Steve suggested, taking a sip of his own coffee.
Steve gasped softly into the heated kisses of his love, his erection straining and downright painful at this point. Wrapping his arms around Tony’s shoulders, Steve found himself rutting against the brunette’s hip, the need for release too great to stifle.
“T-oh-hony!” Steve laughed, trying to move away from his love’s playful torment. His giggling quickly turned into a low moan of bliss when Tony nosed down Steve’s neck, licking and biting at the creamy skin that molded over his Adam’s apple and clavicle.
“You like being fucked hard…like bouncing on my cock, don’t you, baby?” Tony said in a winded tone, his other hand trailing to one of Steve’s nipples. Steve replied with a needy moan, his hips jerking when the brunette pinched that rosy bud, pert and pebbled from the desire that trailed underneath his skin.
“Love your gorgeous ass, baby,” Tony growled above Steve, his fingernails leaving crescent marks into the perky flesh of the super soldier’s cheeks, the indents fitting appropriately amongst the love bites Tony gave him earlier there.
“Do it. Fuck yourself,” Tony encouraged, eyes wide in both awe and lust, hungry for whatever Steve would do to himself. “Let me watch you please yourself, baby.” Steve looked at him, holding his gaze before smiling sweetly at Tony.
Tony pushed Steve’s legs up and over his shoulders, bending the man almost in half as he fucked him with fast thrusts. The noises Steve made were soft whimpers as Tony brushed against his prostate relentlessly. It was when Steve came the third time, chest heaving, nipples hard, hole tightened that Tony too climaxed hard, a cry escaping him as thick strands of come filled Steve up as he pulsed his hips into the man.
Tony looked at Steve with glistening eyes while the blonde spoke, knew what Steve was silently telling him. “Thank you,” Tony whispered, brushing his nose gently against Steve’s, closing his eyes.
“You don’t make me feel that way,” he started. “But I don’t want to ever inadvertently push you away,” Steve admitted, eyes cast down. He had lost so many people he loved. He couldn’t lose Tony too.
Tony sat there, twirling a screwdriver in his grip as he stared at nothing in particular. It had been two weeks since Steve and his mini vacation. And though Tony had other matters to worry about, all he could think about was that trip, and Steve.
“The headlines, they said there must be a new person in your life. And I recognize we’ve not stepped out together yet.” Steve stopped, feeling warm tears trickle down his face. He hadn’t even realized he had begun crying, his emotions wearing him absolutely thin as he let himself be vulnerable in front of the only man who had the privilege to see him cry. “Tell me, Tony,” Steve whimpered then, looking at the brunette. “Have we parted so much that you found solace with someone else?” Steve grimaced then, swallowing that ever present lump in his throat. “Have you fallen out of love with me?”
“I think you need to have your first one. And I’m gonna be the one to give it to you,” Tony remarked. “How would you like that?” Steve thought about it, and the vision of Tony between his legs, his mouth wrapped around his heavy erection caused him to groan, eyes closing.
“Good. Fuck, Steve your perfect. Keep going,” Tony bit out as he felt that heated coil in his belly wind up tighter. He dropped his other hand down between his legs, playing with his own balls before massaging his hole. He had no lube, and he really didn’t want to use spit. But his rim was sensitive as all hell, so this would just have to do.
He was content being alone tonight until he saw a shadow approach. Even with his heightened hearing, Steve never heard when Natasha entered a room. The red head sauntered up to the couch only to slide his sketching supplies over and take a seat next to him.
Tony carded his hand through Steve’s hair, slipping his other fingers free from the blonde’s behind. “So fucking perfect, Steve,” he whispered against the man’s skin, kissing the curve of his shoulder. All Tony ever wanted was what he had right in front of him now. Someone to love always, and for that someone to love him back. Steve was his everything, and he never wanted to wake up to a day where he wasn’t by his side. And Tony knew Steve felt the exact same way.
With an arm wrapped around Steve’s back, his fingers digging into his creamy skin, Tony took hold of the blonde’s chin, lifting it so that he could kiss the man heatedly, pushing back until Steve fell in against the mattress.
Steve had been yearning, and searching for that feeling of home, thinking that Brooklyn would provide it. But being with Tony was exactly what Steve was looking for, where everything fell into place, the cogs and gears working in tandem. Steve’s soul and spirit had been like unstable molecules, constantly vibrating, wanting to break out and find that balance. But as he sat with Tony, their sighs soft and their kisses languid, Steve felt his soul become filled with an overall calm, everything seeming to make sense. And as his spirit fluttered within him, Steve knew that he found his new home with Tony.
Tony fished that bookmark back out, eyeing the statue again. The muscles reminded him of Steve, the defined curve of a pectoral, the small waist and broad shoulders. tony felt his cheeks warm at the thought, his belly getting tight.
The genius smiled up at Steve, shear excitement and happiness spreading across his face as he planted his feet into the mattress for leverage.  He said nothing as he began a gentle thrust of his hips into Steve, falling into a smooth rhythm.  Tony dropped his hands to Steve’s thighs, caressing the muscles before fingering the lace at the tops of his stockings. Steve really looked beautiful in just about anything, and the way he looked in feminine garments was hands down Tony’s favorite thing he wore. Even more so than that tight Captain America suit. There, he said it.
“Wanna keep the stockings on this time, Stevie?” Tony asked, gently slipping his fingers up and down the thin knit fabric. He didn’t miss how they clung to the muscles of his boyfriend’s legs wonderfully, the scalloped lace at the top such a lovely addition.
When they entered their room, the interior design was similar to the rest of the home. A lovely Victorian queen bed was nestled in the middle of the farthest wall, deep brown end tables on each side. Steve set his suitcase next to the only window, trimmed in white wood. There was a gentle breeze that swirled the creamy lace curtains languidly, and Steve thought about how romantic this would be if he and Tony were here as a couple rather than friends. Though Steve was grateful for this trip with just the two of them, he cossetted in their closeness, drinking in Tony’s presence after a month of barely seeing him.
Tony grinned, elated by so many emotions before he took hold of the silky fabric of Steve’s lingerie and pushed it up until Steve’s chiseled belly was exposed. The genius kissed over every crest and trough of the blonde’s lovely abdomen, appreciating how Steve would sigh his name. The super soldier combed a hand in Tony’s thick hair, tugging at it and causing the brunette to let out a moan of his own. Slinking down his love’s body, Tony nibbled at Steve’s inner thighs, the blonde’s legs hiked up, toes curling as the genius’s chin hairs scratched at the tender skin.  The blonde could feel Tony’s warm breath against his clothed arousal, his length twitching with eagerness.
Steve couldn’t stifle his raspy cry as he came once again when Tony started stroking his engorged cock while also tugging at his hole with the strong flick of his tongue. Tony stroked him through it all, pumping every bit of release from him. The brunette’s lips were pressed to his entrance, humming and creating a sultry vibration that resonated through Steve’s entire being.
“Thanks for the breakfast, Tony,” Steve said, winking and licking his lips, making it clear he wasn’t talking about the omelet and bacon. Tony laughed, a mischievous glint in his eye as he stood up, hooking his arms under Steve’s and pulling him up to stand as well.
Steve hummed lightly to himself as he sat in his art studio in Brooklyn, working at his easel. He was practicing with his oil paints, dabbling in the wet on wet technique. The windows to the room were foggy as the cold air outside kissed the glass, the sky black save for a few pale grey wispy clouds.
In the bedroom, Tony slowly helped Steve out of his uniform, his hands knowing where every hidden zipper and snap was. With each bit of Steve’s skin being revealed, Tony placed gentle kisses there, his love’s skin salty from the mission. He heard Steve sigh softly when he nipped a long his clavicle before slipping the fabric down, allowing it to bunch up around his waist. Steve went to unbutton Tony’s shirt front, only for the brunette to still his hands.
Steve and Tony froze, staring wide eyed at each other like deer in the headlights before coming to their senses and bolting to wash the evidence of their tryst from the table.
“Oh, Tony. Miss having you in me like this,” Steve sighed out before gasping when his finger slid inside him. Tony couldn’t say anything in response as he fought with all his might to ward off his orgasm. Steve’s finger pumped slowly in himself, fitting more easily with each drag inside his channel. He grabbed his erection once more, stroking it in tandem with each thrust of his finger, adding another slick digit when his entrance started to loosen.
“Why don’t we get you out of those jeans, baby,” Steve breathed, unbuckling the man’s belt. “You’ve been so thoughtful, I should return the favor, don’t you think?”
Steve giggled, beaming up at Tony before he too sat up. “Actually, there has been a garment I’ve had my eyes on,” Steve admitted, taking the purple slip from his love. “Maybe we can look at some together tomorrow? You could pick out some pieces you’d like to see me in,” Steve offered, leaning to kiss Tony’s shoulder.
He heard the cap of the lube pop open, and saw Tony squirt a large amount of the gel on his hand and fingers. Steve spread his legs wider for the man so that he could have easier access to him, his eyes locking with Tony’s then.
“I wanted to wash up and be minty fresh just for you,” Tony said smiling as he tossed the towel to an abandoned corner. Walking up to Steve, Tony quickly straddled the man’s bare lap, his hands holding onto the arms of the chair.
“Hadn’t orgasmed like that in a while,” Steve admitted, chuckling lightly as he pressed his cheek in against Tony’s then. Tony laughed lightly too. Holding Steve close to him.
“Yes, it is,” Pepper responded, watching the man as he opened the dark brown leather sheath to inspect the documents. The assistant was referring to the meeting Tony’s company
“How did he arrive here?” Tony asked quietly, his voice calm as to not frighten the merman. None of the crew answered, their eyes diverted. “Well, clearly he didn’t just jump up here to get a look at you sorry lots,” Tony added, his tone now laced with annoyance.
“Anytime, Steve,” Tony replied honestly. He thought he wouldn’t enjoy fishing. And maybe he wouldn’t if he wasn’t with Steve, because the guy definitely made it more fun. But it was a calming hobby, like the blonde had said earlier. And he most certainly wanted to do this again, with Steve beside him.
“T-Tony,” the blonde whimpered, eyes fluttering as Tony bit a love mark into his one pectoral, next to the hyper sensitive nipple.
Steve smiled as he flicked his tongue up the underside of his beloved’s penis, the vein thick and warm as he traced its course up until Steve hit the tip of the genius’s erection.
Steve wasn’t a fan of Valentine’s day. Not because he was single every time the holiday came around, but because of how so many have forgotten the history of the holiday. He thought the materialism that plagued the holiday in the 1940s was bad. But now in modern day, it had surpassed even the generous gestures of love in his time.
About a year ago, Tony had been working in his laboratory in the Stark Mansion, creating a new weapon when a minor error in his formula caused an explosion, shrapnel embedding itself within his chest. It took the most advanced physician, Dr. Yensin, to save Tony’s life by instilling a small magnetic device within his chest. This allowed for the metal shrapnel to stay almost suspended in his body, so that it wouldn’t shred his heart.
“I saw you in the headlines,” The super soldier explained. “With a woman, walking a-and laughing with her,” Steve went on, unable to withhold the quake in his voice. Tony’s eyes softened, hearing Steve’s thoughts and worries.
Steve was left with a reeling mind, anxiety ringing in his ears. He cleared his throat then, feeling it constrict with emotion. Leaning down, he placed the plate and cup down next to the door. “J.A.R.V.I.S, would you be so kind and let Tony know I placed food and coffee out here for him?”
“You’re extremely overdressed right now,” Steve commented, chuckling lightly as he pushed the thick denim down over the curve of Tony’s rump before the clothing fell to the floor. Tony stepped out of the garment, kicking them to the side. Steve saw how the man’s penis strained against his maroon boxers. Steve felt his own penis jerk to attention once more. Soon enough, he’d be fully erect again.
“Well, I came in from Japan this morning. Jet lag and the time differences are affecting me,” Pepper explained tiredly.
“Pep,” Tony started, his voice broken and breathless. He was honestly blindsided by all this. He had thought that she was the one he would spend the rest of his days with.  Pepper just shook her head softly, though, her hair shifting over her shoulders from the movement. “Why didn’t you mention this before?” He had to ask, he needed to know.
“Tony?” Steve questioned, rubbing at his eyes with the heel of a hand. “What- Is everything alright?”
Steve’s chest swirled with anticipation. Yeah, he was a little nervous too, like with any new experience. But he was with Tony, and knew that everything would be alright. It was that thought that gave him an overall calm.
Steve was in his room, changing into his uniform. They were called in for a mission, their first one in about six weeks. There was an unknown creature wreaking havoc in Queens. Strapping on his fingerless gloves and securing the shield to his back, Steve headed out to the landing pad where the quinjet was.
Steve headed toward the communal floor regardless, not worrying about being caught wearing his frilly nightie. Natasha and Clint were on a field mission, Thor was either in Asgard, or with Jane. And Bruce was in South Korea, working with a woman by the name of Helen Cho. So, it was just Steve and Tony.
“Oh,” Steve said, brows furrowed and his heart sinking. He wasn’t going to deny it, that had hurt more than he wished. He looked back to see Tony, his back still to Steve. “Does anyone else have restricted access?” He then asked.
“May I?” Tony asked, approaching the oceanic creature before him. His non-injured hand gently grasped the raw edge of the cream cotton that was covering Steve’s lacerations. Steve watched him, looking at him, blue eyes wide. He had a swell of nerves, though he was not sure why. He trusted Tony, by the was so close, and Steve felt suddenly unsure of himself.
It took Steve a moment to come to, the feeling coming back to his body. He saw Tony smiling at him cheekily, as if he was holding back a laugh.
“I do, actually,” Tony said quickly. “I wanna know what happens.” When Steve just looked down, staying quiet, Tony gave him a gentle nudge with his elbow.
“You’re telling me,” Tony said. “That’s why Pepper dumped me,” Tony admitted then, holding his friend’s gaze.
“Bend forward some for me baby,” Tony said, his free hand gently pushing between Steve’s shoulder blades, encouraging the super soldier on. “This may be my favorite lingerie number of yours, love,” Tony added softly, his fingers slipping under the eyelet lace straps that clung to the muscles of Steve’s strong shoulders.
“Ahh,” Steve whined, pushing his plush bum back and chasing Tony’s cock, eagerly searching and needing that contact from his beloved.
“Oh Tony, I do. I really do know,” Steve said, his chest filling with butterflies while he laid a kiss on Tony’s forehead, brushing a few dark strands from it with his lips. He slid his lingerie down over his legs then, letting it hang around his ankles before he grabbed the chocolate bottle once more and poured a good amount in his hand. He shifted himself back slightly and took Tony’s gorgeous, warm erection into his hand, stroking him slowly, working the chocolate all over his shaft.
But Steve had been on the cusp of crying from the ripe pain of all that they’d done as well as still enjoying being under Tony’s gaze. With his hands still held down by Tony’s, Steve’s body constricted, muscles straining at that unmistakable sensation of his prostate being stimulated.
Steve’s breath caught with each passing movement over his body, his entire being buzzing with Tony’s sweet knowing touch. “I could easily get lost in those touches of yours,” Steve sighed, looking at where Tony’s hand was on his sternum before flicking his gaze up to the other man’s face. The super soldier laid his hand over Tony’s, holding it there a minute, his heart thudding underneath.
Without a word Steve took a step closer to the mirror, kneeling in front of it, and spreading his legs before looking back at Tony with an innocent expression.
to keep his mind off of Steve. All these blossoming feelings were nonsensical and absurd, so why weren’t they going away?
Tony shifted from his thoughts when he heard Steve’s moans grow more desperate. The blonde choked on a breath as his body arched. Tony knew that response; Steve had found his own prostate. The brunette couldn’t help but to smile, he’d rubbed that lovely bundle of nerves many times.
“I really don’t think that’s necessary, Tony,” the blonde replied after a pause. “It’s not like you’re blindfolding me and whipping me with a ridding crop.”
Natasha made a bowl of popcorn, the two of them devouring it 15 minutes into the movie. Towards the end of the flick, Natasha had her head resting on his shoulder, her eyes eyelids heavy. It wasn’t late, but Steve hadn’t seen her all day. He wondered if she had a quick mission.
The super soldier bit his lip when he felt the pad of Tony’s fingertip trace around his entrance, massaging the ring of muscle there. He felt a strong resistance when Tony attempted to push his finger into him, his opening tight and burning already.
“You know,” Tony started, thumbing at the creamy lace that nestled under Steve’s defined pecs. “I’m pretty sure Natasha got a glimpse of those when we opened presents earlier,” he said, nodding to the anal beads on the bed. He had expected Steve to blush in embarrassment, but the super soldier merely laughed, shrugging as if it weren’t a big deal. The brunette didn’t think it was a big deal either, but he wanted to get a small ruse from his boyfriend.
“Yeah, sure you do,” Tony said playfully. It was then that Tony turned to look at Steve more clearly, and the blonde saw the man’s brown eyes widen when he saw what the super soldier was wearing. “My my. I’ve not seen that little get up before,” Tony smiled, licking his bottom lip.
The super soldier allowed his kisses to be sweet and innocent for just a fraction of time before he slid his tongue into Tony’s, feeling the wet glide of his boyfriend’s own as well as the slippery enamel of his pearly teeth.
“I’m not telling you who it was. But we had connected so well, though things started out rocky. And then, one day, when I saw them, talking and joking with someone, their smile bright and genuine, I felt it. That love I had for Peggy so many years ago had come back.” As Steve told him that, Tony felt a bitter pit turn within him, and he’d known that feeling before; he was jealous.
“Stark, your father was a part of Project Rebirth. Don’t you think its slightly important that you get your ass over there and meet him? Fury asked, voice sharp and tone irritated as he glowered at the other man with his one good eye.
Steve gripped Tony’s thighs when he felt his beloved’s lips and teeth on his behind, the sensation so wonderful it made the super soldier light headed, his cock drooling with pre-release onto Tony’s bare chest. He didn’t think his love would really care at all; Steve would clean him up after all was said and done regardless.
The blonde obliged, resting his chin in his arms, looking at the genius who had opened the lube and squirted out a large amount on his finger and palm. Steve sighed pleasantly when he felt one of his fiancé’s fingers journey down to the cleft of his ass before settling at his hole. Steve’s penis was fully erect by now, and when Tony slipped his finger completely inside, Steve’s cock twitched against the unkempt sheets.
Steve finished changing the oil and filter then, still thinking over everything as he scrubbed up any spilled oil as well as cleaned the tools before putting them back into Tony’s toolbox. He meandered over to his sketchbook and pencil, still resting on the stool.
Steve knew what Tony was going to do, but nothing could prepare Steve for that scratching stimulation of the genius’s cropped beard deep inside the soft flesh of his rump. Clutching at the comforter, Steve squeezed his eyes shut, moaning lowly when he felt Tony lick around his rim.
Tony fucking loved it when Steve rode him, getting to see the man’s face up close as the pleasures of love making etched upon the blonde’s face. Pressing his chest against Steve’s, feeling the man’s hard nipples brushing against his own, Tony groaned, wrapping his arms around Steve and crashing his lips against his love’s.
for you," Tony admitted. "I am just having trouble coming to terms with it all. I am sure you have felt this way too, about the whole thing?" Tony asked.
The beeping of the monitor startled Tony from his vision, and he blinked a few times, his surroundings shifting back to the present. Tony instantly observed the monitor, looking at Steve's vitals. They were stable, and the genius gave a sigh of relief. He scooted his chair closer to Steve's bed, and with a shaky breath, he reached out a hand, entwining his fingers with Steve's. His sight blurred from unshed tears as he watched the man sleep, his dark eyelashes gently splayed on his cheekbones. The blond had an oxygen mask on, but the brunette could see his pink lips barely part as he breathed softly.
“You like it, don’t you, love?” Tony said, his breath puffing against Steve’s skin. Tony sucked at the skin once more, breaking the blood vessels to give Steve a love hickey on a bum cheek. He glided his hands up the backside of Steve’s thighs as the blonde held his knees to his chest, being so good for Tony before he went to work giving equal attention to Steve’s other cheek. He bit at it, pulling at the skin with his teeth, relishing in every obscenely gorgeous sound his blonde lover was making above him. “Yeah, yeah you do like this. Like how easily I can take you apart Steve.”
Tony considered it a blessing in disguise that there was an urgent matter at the tower. Tony had dreaded going to Steve Rogers's apartment even if he felt bad for the guy. Seeing Steve Rogers, Captain America, standing like a sculpted statue, tall and muscular. He was everything Howard had raved about. Tony wasn’t able to handle that truth as well as he'd expected. Steve rogers, Captain America was what tony was not...was what Howard compared tony to. Captain America, the hero he'd looked up to and loved as a kid was merely just a man, a success story for his father's genius mind.
All Steve could think of then was not himself, but his pod...Natasha, Sam, and Nick. He failed them, like he failed Bucky. He was not able to protect them, or the other creatures in the sea. That was the only thing he felt was his purpose...to help those who could not defend themselves. He jeopardized their safety and location too by being captured. Merpeople were not a rogue species, these humans would know there were more of his kind nearby.
“I said, I’m not in love with Sharon. I-I don’t like her that way. At one point, when she was undercover as my neighbor, I found her intriguing then. But most certainly not now,” Steve explained, his voice annoyed.
“Not masculine?” Tony asked, his voice light, almost incredulous. “Steve, honey, you don’t have a bone in your body that isn’t masculine,” Tony assured him. “You’re perfect. And I wouldn’t want you to be anything other than yourself when we are together.”
Every sound Steve made beneath him made Tony smile. He flicked his gaze up only briefly to see the super soldier’s hands clench as he fought to control his strength in the bindings.
“Okay, baby, okay,” Tony said quickly, bringing his arms up and holding Steve securely, kissing the arc of the blonde’s broad shoulder. “Take some deep breaths a minute.” They both needed to settle down if they wanted to take their love making all the way.
“Oh, God,” Steve rushed out, sounding as if the words were knocked out of him by some unbeknownst force. The blonde looked over his shoulder the best he could, imagining Tony as he fucked Steve with his rosy tongue, his face buried into his rump and eliciting all the obscene pleasures from the super soldier. Tony’s lush, dark hair peered over Steve’s round behind, causing the man to close his eyes as his mind ran wild with image after image of the genius and that glorious mouth of his.
“I-I’m sorry,” Rhodey said, coughing while Tony grimaced and wiped his face with a napkin. “Did you say Steve? Steve Rogers?”
"I love you, Steve," Tony murmured against the other man's lips, leaning back a bit to see Steve. "I really, truly do, and that will never change. I just, want to make sure you still are willing to be with me, soulmates aside. This is your choice to make," Tony said. Steve could see the worry and doubt, he could feel Tony's concerns. Steve leaned back in, wrapping his arms around the small of Tony's waist.
“Merry Christmas, Steve,” Tony said, giving him a small smile. Steve looked at him, trying to find the right words to say.
“You assumed a few years ago that you would always hate Steve.” Rhodes said, knocking the brunette from his thoughts. “I think you’re just scared.”
It wasn’t the morning light that crept into the room that stirred Steve from his slumber, but the warmth of strong hands against him and the subtle press of an arc reactor into his back. The super soldier opened his blues eyes, taking in every touch that Tony was giving him before smiling and closing his eyes again. He’d almost considered it all to be a dream, until Tony shifted behind him and kissed Steve’s neck with light kisses, his facial hair scratching pleasantly at his skin.
"Tony, I know what you’re feeling, the pain, the heat. I have one too," Steve said, moving his shirt aside, showing Tony the mark. He watched Tony take in a ragged inhale, closing his eyes. "We both know what this means," Steve gently said, taking an apprehensive step closer. "I've been having visions, dreams...of these people from random historical times, Tony," Steve explained. "As if I know them. And in some way, shape or form it all revolves around their soulmark, bond, you name it," Steve continued, hoping to gage a response from Tony.
“Oh,” was all Tony said, and he knew Steve didn’t bring up Howard to upset him on purpose. Though, in the beginning, before they had settled their differences and became friends, Tony was positive Steve brought up happy stories with Howard just to piss Tony off. It always worked too.
Steve wore a dark green, velvety underbust corset, that was trimmed in an ivory lace. Tony took in how the lace trailed along Steve’s gorgeous, firm pecs, the scalloped edges brushing against his nipples teasingly. The sight alone caused heat to flood Tony’s southern regions, and he hadn’t even touched Steve yet. The genius’s eyes traveled down the blonde’s torso, loving how the fitted boning of the corset hugged Steve’s muscles. He finally rested his eyes on the matching green lacy undies the super solider wore, his semi-erect penis peeking between the rosette styled pattern of the lace.
“We don’t have lube,” Steve whispered then, leaning back to look at Tony whose expression held nothing but adoration for the blonde. He watched Tony smile brightly then, an arm still wrapped around Steve securely as he leaned forward to grab the chocolate sauce his boyfriend had set there minutes before.
“Steve,” Tony said breathily, pulling away and stilling his thrusting hips. “You know how much I love watching you as I fuck you?” He asked as he began undoing the buttons of his dress shirt.
“Hey, Steve,” Tony replied, moving to his feet, and removing the goggles he had to protect his eyes from any rust flakes.
Steve braced his hands on Tony’s chest, the burning sensation from being opened up causing him to dig his nails into the brunette’s skin. He felt Tony’s hands move from the cut lines of his hips to his ass, the man’s fingers spreading his cheeks as Steve was finally penetrated fully, his bum nestled against Tony’s testicles. He shuddered from the feeling of it, his body adjusting to Tony being inside him.
“Before we go any further,” Tony began, brushing his fingers on the silky ribbon once more, shivering happily at the visage of Steve bound with his hands above him filtering into his imagination. “I need that safe word.” Steve knitted his brows in thought, his bottom lip protruding out slightly.
“So needy, Steve,” Tony said, his cheeks warm from watching Steve. “Always so desperate for me.” Steve heard him, and thought that the man was absolutely right. In that moment, he looked ravished, with blown pupils, his reddened chest heaving as he tried to breathe, and his erection bouncing against his belly as he pushed down onto his love’s finger.
"I love you Tony, forever and always," the super solider said. Tony was beside himself with relief and happiness, and he kissed Steve again, a bit ravenously. He couldn’t help himself, their bond unable to be stifled anymore.
“You’re welcome,” the man responded, the one side of his mouth curving up. “I am sorry for what happened. I still have no idea what their intentions were when they hoisted you out of the sea,” Tony said with a shrug of his shoulders. “But I hate to have you here unsupervised.”
“I’m happy to hear that. Because no one else can have you,” Tony remarked. Steve’s cheeks warmed at that. He liked Tony talking with such assertiveness, the idea of him being the brunette’s possession. Steve wrapped his hand around Tony’s back, his other hand holding onto the outside of the man’s thigh. Tony smiled down at him, his hands holding onto the back of the chair as he leaned in to devour Steve’s plush lips.
Maybe it was the footage he’d seen of Tony flashing a knowing grin, spewing sarcastic remarks and in the public eye during a recent court hearing that revealed how confident and cocky the brunette genius was.
“O-oh,” Tony said in a rushed breath, kissing back with an equal amount of passion as Steve devoured every moan he elicited. Steve drifted his mouth over the raspy scratch of his boyfriend’s beard, nipping and sucking at Tony’s skin that trailed down his neck and throat. He wavered over a particularly sensitive spot of Tony’s, nuzzling at the area underneath the man’s clavicle.
Steve’s legs fell open even more, his body already exhausted as Tony finally pulled his fingers out of him, only to slick up his own aching erection. Steve lifted his head and watched him, Tony’s breath hitching at his own touch. Steve could only assume that Tony too was ready to fall apart.
“Yes, but I’m a mess,” Steve countered, pulling back to point to his torso. “And that’s not even mentioning my ass,” he grinned.
Tony sighed, rubbing a hand over his face as he plopped down into a chair, grabbing a stylus and tapping it on the table. Steve had a few things in his uniform that could always be improved upon, especially penetration into the fabric. Bringing up Steve’s file on the holographic screen, Tony looked over the man’s full body image, spinning it around to look for variables to improve. Besides his shield, the man didn’t have really any other weapons besides his ridiculous super strength and tactical skills.
“Ambush!” Tony yelled when more wet snow was flying at them in opposite directions. Natasha ran across the wall that enclosed the yard, hurling one right at Steve’s face. It was so cold, and yet so invigorating, his senses awakening. He laughed giddily, grabbing a handful of snow and packing it as he ducked behind a tree. He saw Thor running out from behind a training wall, throwing an icy ball at Tony and knocking the brunette flat on his bum.
Tony laid against the man’s back for a moment, breathing deep and inhaling the scent of a spent Steve.
Steve was taken aback when he saw Tony Stark standing on the opposite side of the threshold, a pair of sunglasses on, hiding his eyes. Steve quickly wondered why he would have sunglasses inside a building before more importantly wondering why the man was at his door.
