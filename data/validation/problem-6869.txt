Toni raised her eyebrows at the harshness of this butler's tone and words as Daniel just rolled his eyes. Invoking a laugh from Toni’s lips.
“More handsome than you...” Toni whispered; she couldn’t help the smile forming on her lips. Steve grinned back at the genius resting beneath him and sealed their lips in another kiss.
“Well,” the host laughed as the room erupted in screams yet again. “Captain America has spoken; Iron Man is the greatest Avenger.”
“Yeah, well. I’m sorry about this, Stark. Ya see I was trying for someone else, and well.” Reed scratched the top of head, flashing the shorter genius a smile. “This happened... You think we could put our genius minds together and put them back where they belong?”
“I can’t wait to see you in your dress!” Pepper squealed from the sofa, as she drank her green kombucha through a metal straw.
“Thank you… Toni. I’m not so afraid of the future anymore.” Toni leaned down and gave the younger man a kiss on his cheek.
Or hanging out with Toni in her lab for hours on end, sketching the brunette in her element as she worked on world-changing technology.
Toni pulled his glasses back up his nose with her fingertips like she always did. Smiling wider as she looked into his breath-taking blue eyes. Their faces slowly inching closer, both completely lost in the moment of the other in their embrace...
Toni sighed, nodded her head, and began making her way over to her side of the bed where Steve stood near the window. She pulled the covers back only to be pulled into Steve’s arms as stood beside her.
He also thought about waking up beside his little genius, seeing her crazy bed head as she lay snuggled up to his bare chest. Steve dreamed of going on ice cream runs together at three in the morning. He dreamed of taking Toni to a drive-in movie and holding her close to his chest as they watched a film on the big screen, where he would steal kisses from her lips during intermission.
Steve Rogers had a power over Toni Stark that no one else could match. It was like his blue eyes could put a trance on the brunette, his stare would stop her in her tracks and send shivers up her spine. Steve could make her feel meek and powerful all at the same time. His strong arms wrapped around her waist made her feel as if she was in the safest place on earth. Steve always made her feel as if they were the only people in this whole world.
Toni just smiled as she approached the taller man, hand feeding him the pink Starburst. A heated look flushing her pupils and a sultry grin growing on her lips as Steve’s teeth softly brushed her fingertips, and his tongue quickly danced across her soft skin.
“Who has the green notebook?” Steve asked the room, his eyes frantically searching the resident's hands for that leather-bound book that held his dirty secrets.
“He’s in a SHIELD interrogation room, with your mother.” Steve whispered, his hands softly gripping Toni’s forearms.
Thank you for reading!!! I have loved this story so much and it was so bitter sweet posting the final chapter!! Please scream and cry at me in the comments!!
“Come with me,” Steve told her, standing to his feet. The bigger blond went to throw her over his shoulder in his normal fireman's carry, but instead he turned her so she sat across his shoulders. Her face resting on his left shoulder as her right leg hung off his right shoulder. Her body resting along the back of his neck.
Maybe Peter doesn’t want their help. But let him just try to say no to Maggie. Not one super genius, super spy, superhuman, or alien god has managed it yet.
Forty minutes later, forty empty-chair-staring, no-contact-from-from-Cap minutes later, Tony goes home.
He makes sure Dad and Harley eat all of their meals. He learns how to cook with Steve so he can make Natasha her favorite cakes. He laughs way too loudly at Bruce's chemistry jokes.
Every member of the family has learned to check ceilings and vents when looking for their guest (Tony gave FRIDAY a note:
Peter is just...so painfully young. He's smart, way too smart for his own good, and he likes being smart. Steve notices he doesn't wield his genius like a weapon in the way that Tony and Harley do. Instead, Peter just likes learning. He likes maths and sciences, especially the sciences, and wants to go to school to make advances in the medical field that will save lives. He thinks reading chemistry and biology books is fun.
“Yeah, get out, y’all are gross,” Harley grumps. Accepts a kiss on the head from Dad, a manly thump on the shoulder from Steve. He actually is really, really exhausted. Harley’s also really, really relieved. He’s not 100% on board with Steve’s plan, but at least there is a plan. At least they’re taking this seriously.
Kids. Between the ages of ten and eighteen. Actual children, encouraged by the relationship between Steve and Peter, who begin to open up and speak, are passionate about it.
“It’s Peter,” Steve tells him, short and soft, the moment the Medbay doors have sealed behind him. “They’ve taken him into surgery.”
The kids mob him before he’s made it out of the elevator. It goes like this: a rush of giddy, squealing joy (okay, only Maggie’s loud about it, but Harley’s got that grin he always tries to hide spread all across his face). A pause of blank confusion. Dread dragging down all of Harley’s happy angles, and:
“Hey now, boys,” a woman coming down the sidewalk says, hesitating as if she wants to intervene, but also wants to continue on with her delinquent free day..
“It’s—” Steve’s eyes, wide with worry Tony is just starting to register, dart from Tony to carefully take in Maggie and Harley’s anxious, angry faces. Steve frowns as his gaze returns to Tony. “It’s not my place to say. You can come see him, I’ll explain everything—but I need the kids to wait here.”
"What he means," Steve interrupts, "is that we like to think we're all a family now. An official one."
“Peter was awesome, Harley,” Maggie chirps. “Fought all three boys at once. I kicked one in the nuts like you taught me but he got back up so Peter had to deal with all three of them. They went running at the end! You shoulda seen—”
Peter can deal with that. Maybe he can finally come out of the shadows and eat pizza with everyone else not have a panic attack at the mere thought of being in the same room as these people. It was possible they didn't even remember him, right?
Well, Thursdays have become good days, ever since Captain America started showing up at Brooklyn's Youth Center. The first time Peter saw him, he hid behind couches and nearly shit himself as the man walked in with armloads of ingredients for tacos on a Tuesday afternoon. Two kids, two very familiar kids, trailed after him with more ingredients. Then they all gathered in the kitchen and began making tacos for the kids and volunteers. Two days later, they came back again to help kids with homework and played games until the center closed. Then,two days after that, they showed up on aSaturday afternoon with box after box of pizza and pasta, sending kids home with to-go containers and full bellies.
Okay, he sounds cool. All calm and confident. But unless he’s a secret kung-fu master or something, Maggie’s kinda agreeing with the gathering, sniggering bully trio: this kid doesn’t look like much more of a threat than Maggie was while alone. The ringleader has pretty much recovered from the only real damage she scored, and now it’s less about mean kids entertaining themselves and more about proving a point, but no way Maggie’s wasting this. She wipes her face on her sleeve, keeps her finger pressed on the lock screen button on her phone until it vibrates three times. Harley’s received her emergency alert and location, a failsafe she both feels guilty for using and stupid for not using sooner. Then, she’s down on hands and knees, frantically gathering up her art.
“That’s ‘Greatest Generation’ to you,” Steve shoots back, then winks. It breaks the tension a bit, which Harley is extremely grateful for. Dad looks conflicted and guilty, but is trying hard to smooth it over with the
plus the follow-up grab. Then he pushes—looks weird ‘cause it’s hesitant, almost gentle—and that big boy goes tumbling on his ass, eyes huge with a shock Maggie shares.
“My deepest wish,” she finished. “It’s all of ours, Pete. Everyone says it's your choice, and I know that, but...please. Please say yes.”
Their foreheads drop together and Tony’s shoulders shake. Maggie has to hide her face in her flowers and Harley squeezes Peter’s shoulder because he looks like he’s gonna break.
“You’ve been talking about this kid a lot,” Tony tells him on a date in late January. Steve grimaces as embarrassment washes over him because he realizes how much he’s talking about Peter. “No, honey, you don’t have to be apologetic. You have always let me blabber on about my kids.”
“You want more, we’ll get more,” Steve says, and laughs again, and lays Tony down so he can kiss the rest of him.
“Yeah, or burgers, or shawarma, or Korean—” Harley’s looking around the street, listing off nearby restaurants. “Whatever you want.”
“—Three boys stole her art portfolio, and she tried to fight them off, and then Peter—” Harley turns, looking to introduce Peter.
“Exactly,” Peter says. “All I’m saying is that it’s not as simple as the Japanese were going to keep killing people. There’s more to it on both sides, and I would not have wanted to be the person making that decision. But it was a horrible thing and the people that died did not deserve it.”
“You got to him in time,” Tony says, reaching out because fuck it all. Steve is in front of him,  Steve needs comfort, and Tony loves Steve. “He called you. That’s what matters. He knew he could call you, and he did, and we’re going to make sure he’s okay. Yeah?”
Peter nods. They sit together on a couch in the office. It doesn't take long for Harley to come in, followed soon by Dad and Steve. The two are clasping hands, though Dad's free hand is holding an envelope and there's a pen in his mouth.
Giggling, Maggie rolls to her side and sees a picture of Steve with his arms around her shoulders, standing in front of the castle as Disney. Steve Rogers. Captain America. The man who modeled dedication and taught her about what it really meant to protect those who couldn't protect themselves—even when you're backed into a wall and it looks like you're gonna lose. Steve takes her on ice cream dates and pays for art lessons, encourages her pursuits that aren't academic like Harley and Dad. Steve is Maggie’s confidant.
“I promise you’ll regret this,” Maggie warns, swallowing fear and biting down hard when it tries to come back up. She absolutely hates that she's starting to cry. Her Christmas present for Dad and Steve (and her deepest, dearest Christmas wish) is in that portfolio. She’s been working on it for two months. When her art club teacher said it turned out amazing, Maggie was so proud that she couldn’t wait for Harley to come pick her up. She started skipping down the sidewalk on her own, too excited to stand still. It’s only six blocks from her school to his - she’s not a baby, she doesn’t need an overprotective brother meeting her at the door—or all the girls in her class gathering to giggle over how hot they think her dumb brother is. Today was a good day in a whole row of really good days, and that made  her confident. So confident, that she ruined everything.
“But,” Harley’s voice lowers, “what if he doesn’t have much time? How long can he really keep living like this?”
“Yeah,” Maggie whispers. If Peter hadn’t shown up like he did, she probably wouldn’t be. “You gonna find him? And then we’ll help him? If he needs it.”
“We have a new plan,” Maggie says. Tony’s kids have sat him down for a plotting session—for what, Tony isn’t sure, but world domination is near the top of his best guesses—while Steve runs through a careful workout with Peter, who has been declared wholly healed and ready for gym access, and not a second too soon. Spiderling has been crawling up the walls.
. Didn’t try to help me at all. But Peter jumped right in and he’s not much bigger than me, right, Harley? I gotta learn to fight like that. Steve! You promised you’d start teaching me—”
“Okay, here’s the deal,” Harley says. Life has settled into a new style of normal. Peter lives with them now. Kid’s still wary and wide-eyed; grateful and disbelieving, but he hasn’t tried to run away. And he’d better not try, because Maggie will never forgive him or anyone else if he succeeds.
"Peter!" she exclaims, running at him. Her tiny arms wrap around his waist and her head kind of collides with his chest, enough to draw a little ‘
“And because I know you, Steven, and you would have gone and beat people up and made things worse for Peter. He made me promise not to tell you.”
“There were these three big boys messing with me. They took—” the urge to start crying again hits her by surprise, and she swallows hard, chin wobbling. “—t-took my portfolio, and were going to—to go through it and film it, they said it was for Tik-Tok, and they wouldn’t give it back so I threw snow at them and then they started fighting me and
“So, what,” Harley says, because okay, Steve shared some super personal stuff and he can kind of see how it applies, but still: “you’re not going to help a homeless kid? A homeless kid who’s a
he tells himself. Tony steadily gathers up all his courage—wonders if he’s ever needed quite this much (he’s surely never had the certainty this courage grows out of)—and asks
Steve catches moments, though, where the rough life he knows Peter’s had bleeds through in his opinions. Peter tells him over the paper one night that he refuses to believe dropping the Atom Bomb was the right thing to do. It doesn’t matter that it technically ended a war. Was it victory if you had to beat someone into submission?
“Privacy is a constitutional right,” Steve says, frowning. “But what’s done is done. It’s what we do next that matters now. What strategy we take.”
is going to find out he's hacked the security feeds and has been using school resources. He's going to a school for geniuses. His teachers are geniuses. There's no way someone doesn't know, right?
“Hey, Harls,” Dad says softly, and steps in close to where they’ve sat Harley at his desk chair. Dad’s fingers brush softly through Harley’s messy hair, smoothing it from his forehead. “You’ve got the best of intentions, we know that. One of many things that make us so proud that you’re ours. But Steve’s got some good points. I’m not saying we’re not going to try—” Harley goes stiff, moves away without leaving his spot on the chair and Dad lets him go, comforting hand falling to his side. “We just need to think about all the angles here. What’s right, what’s legal, what’s possibleand, most importantly, what Peter Parker wants.”
“Tony, I’m so sorry,” Steve says. Harley gets between Steve and Tony; sidesteps to cut Steve off again when he tries to move around him. “I know you’ve been calling me—”
“Like a family,” she says. Definitely the dream. “I’m Maggie, by the way. Magnolia Keener, but you can call me Maggie.”
“I don’t know,” Steve says miserably. “He was barely conscious when I reached him. Out cold by the time I’d brought him here. He was—Tony, he was curled up in this alleyway, shaking and—and soaked in his own blood—”
She pulls her Christmas project out of her portfolio. It’s a Coat of Arms inspired by a unit on medieval heraldry from last year’s social studies class. She worked on the design for months before she started painting.
, and he’ll never stop being grateful for it, but it’s...heavy. There are lots of kids who need just—just a fraction of what Harley has, and their whole lives would look up.
"Oh, um." Peter swallows nervously. Sitting down and having a meal with these people is different than spending hours writing a paper with Captain America. "You really don't have to—"
“I’m okay,” Maggie whispers. At this totally ridiculous time when the bullies are gone and her art is mostly okay, while facing her handsome rescuer with his kind face and big, concerned puppy-dog eyes —she bursts out crying uncontrollably.
“I love you, Tony” Steve blurts, wishing there were more poetic words to say about how he felt for his boyfriend, for this incredible man who deals with him and trusts him and everything in between.
Steve huffs a laugh, warmth puffing Tony’s hair where nose and lips nuzzle almost-kisses into his scalp.
"I don't trust anyone with my heart, Rogers, and I think you know that. I am terrified of being broken worse than I already am, and of someone not being able to look past my arrogance and my anxieties, and the fact that nobody can place above my kids. Then, I met you. You loved me for all I have to offer, and you loved my kids as if they were already ours. I have wanted you for so long that I don't know what it's like to want anything else. And so here I stand, broken pieces barely glued together, and asking you to do it again. Because if you agree to have me, I vow to stand by you until the end of my days. Through every nightmare and every fight, through all the dangers we know in our day jobs. I promise to always bring you coffee the way you like, even if it's gross. I promise to be the one who defends you when you aren’t around and supports you when you are. I promise to continue learning what love means.”
Steve sighs, casting a look over at Harley. The teenager is holding one of the many boxes of Chinese food they’d ordered for a Saturday at the youth center.
“I’m sorry,” Maggie  sobs. Tries to tell him again that she’s totally fine and very grateful; her brother will be here soon - he can go if he needs to. It’s a garbled, hiccuping mess and her phone won’t stop buzzing, and she should answer it and she really, really needs a tissue—
Except, it's been months, and they haven't tried anything. Captain America hasn't stalked the halls looking for a mutant to reprimand, the kids haven't followed him or tried to approach him, and he simply...hangs back, eats good food, and comes to realize that maybe they don't know he's Spider-Man. Don't want to find him and stop him or arrest him. Captain America just wants to serve the community that served him forever ago.
“Yep, that’s exactly what you’re going to do,” a new voice says, and suddenly there’s strong shoulders and a steady voice between Maggie and the bully-boys, just where Harley would stand if her wishes had actually brought him here. The new kid isn’t as tall as any of the bullies and certainly not as heavy, but he doesn’t look afraid. At all.
“How’d ya get him to stop fightin’ like that? I could use that trick; it would save my ass lotta trouble.”
"And we owe something to you," Harley insists. "Since, you know, I couldn't be there for Maggie and you were. I feel like we never got to thank you properly. This could be our chance!"
As he reaches for his shower caddy, Peter wonders how long he can keep this up. He's been living in ceilings and under staircases in the school for a couple months now (since his last hideout got raided by the goddamn FBI). Surely,
It’s just that this is a really nice restaurant, the kind of restaurant it takes forever to talk Steve into eating at because the prices are apparently ridiculously high and no matter how much money Steve makes, he never gets used to spending it. Or letting Tony spend it instead.
it. Maggie wipes angrily at hot-cold tears streaming over her cheeks, shoves past an uncertain sidekick to try to get to her art. The most important one hasn’t been stepped on—yet—
Then there’s Harley:her brother,her best friend,her protector (though she’ll never admit that he really is her knight in shining armor). Maggie’sentire life has been lived with Harley by her side. No matter who they lived with or what city they were in, Harley is there with a shoulder and a laugh, and sometimes illegal activity she definitely doesn’t support.
“I don’t think so, sweetheart. I’ll check though.” With a wink and a final pat, he leaves his kids, and follows the man he thought would end the day as his fiancé.
Peter stares at the envelope in his hands before looking up with wide eyes. He stammers, unable to settle on one thing to say. He looks so confused and hopeful and just—raw. So far from the boy who saved her.
How New Years, a time of celebration, became him staring at the crowded city and drinking to another year of misery.
FRIDAY doesn’t answer. Which means Steve asked her not to, probably. If Tony loved him any less, he’d program that impossible.
Harley is gonna be so mad at her. Not half as mad as he’ll be at the boys she’s about to lose a fight to though, and that’s even worse. He always overreacts— subconsciously, maybe he thinks he’s make up for all the times he didn’t stand up to bullies when he was little. Now, he’s taller than Dad and never cries, and anyone who acts like the tormentors of Harley’s past get shut down so hard and fast that his own memories get scared. That’s how Maggie figures it, anyway. Harley doesn’t even care how much trouble he gets in for it.
There’s a pause. Steve’s next breath shudders on its way in. Tony feels the vibrations of it in his cheekbone, in the press of his shoulder under Steve’s. “Well, that works out well,” Steve says, voice a little raw, “‘cause I’ve been kind of hoping to spend all of everything with you.”
That evening, when Peter joins the other kids for dinner, the little girl he saved—Maggie, he remembers—drops the bag of tortillas she’s holding and beams. Between the bright smile and sunshine yellow hair, Peter considers that she's a little like the sun.
"False," Harley corrects. "I just don't see the point in being tested on random facts to memorize. There's never any discussion on the philosophy of the past or learning from the cultures. We just have to remember when D-Day is."
“He’s part of us now,” Harley agrees, nodding along to Maggie’s unexplained point. “The two of us have become a three.”
“Right. We sit in our billion-dollar tower and wait for a runaway kid to knock on our door like ‘Hey there, Cap, I had a funny feeling you wanted to see me—’”
“It’s okay, Maggie. Really into Captain America? Stay right there, I want to see the look on your face when he shows up. He hates bullies almost as much as I do—”
“When my mom died,” Steve startshaltingly, and Harley’s eyes snap to him, intrigued in spite of himself. Steve very, very rarely talks about his past. Any part of his past. “I was—the same age Peter is now, actually. Had nothing left. Except my best friend, and my best friend’s family, and they wanted me to come live with them. They were the best people—didn’t have much, but they had...a good home. They loved each other, were kind to each other. Would have treated me as one of their own.
It's in between the ceremony and the reception. Maggie knows from movies and stories that this is the quiet time for the newlyweds to have a moment; to revel in their marriage. It's why it's a little surprising to her that her father requests her presence in a private office.
"Steve?" Peter frowns. He glances to the kitchen, where Captain America is whistling and wiping down counters.
It’s less than two blocks to Harley’s school. Maggie cranes her neck to look everywhere while they walk, but if Peter is near enough to be seen, Maggie sure doesn’t see him. She stares out the window all the way home, too. Can’t stop thinking about Peter as she eats her own plentiful dinner and crawls into her safe, warm bed.
“Hey, hey, it’s okay,” Mystery Kid keeps telling her. “That was really scary, and you were a total badass back there. Sometimes this happens after a fight, you know? Once your body knows you’re safe, it’s all, ‘cool, let’s cry now!’. Happens to everyone. Shoot, why can’t I find—I swear I had a pack of Kleenex in here somewhere—” between her tears she sees him digging through his backpack, looking for tissues. He’s flustered and blushing a little, and it’s so different from the cool courage he showed when he stepped in to help some random little girl getting bullied on the streets that a hiccup catches on a giggle.
“When we first met,” Steve chokes. “I was homeless and confused and...displaced. I seemed to never be alone, but was so desperately lonely that every night felt like I was stepping into some kind of void. Day by day I felt like I was fading. No family and no friends. No life.”
“No problem,” Mystery Kid says, all smiley and relieved. “Looks like everyone’s good, then, I’ll be going—”
Maggie tries to go to sleep, but her brain keeps whirring away with thoughts of her mystery savior. Maybe Peter has his own safe, warm bed too. And plenty to eat. It’s not like they can really know.
“Try me and find out. And then get some therapy! Targeting people who don’t have the resources to protect themselves for your own amusement is a serious character fault. And possibly symptomatic of unhealed childhood hurt and a really unhealthy coping mechanism. You should really get that checked out!”
Maggie lets out a laugh through her sobs as she watches her idiot brother almost kill himself running through traffic to cross the street. Tires screech,horns blare and Maggie shrieks, but in an instant Harley’s there, perfectly fine, grabbing her in a hug so tight and  fast that it squeezes her lungs. A moment lapses and Harley pushes her away just as fast, looking around wildly for a threat—zeroes in on Mystery Kid—shoves Maggie behind him.
“Clearance granted,” Tony orders, already halfway back to the elevator. The kids are right there with him, of course, and maybe they shouldn’t be, but one look at the set of Harley’s jaw tells Tony he doesn’t have time for this fight. “Take us to him. Who’s the guest?”
He waves her over. From what she can see of the screens he has up, he’s hacking into CCTV footage of the street Peter saved Maggie on.
“You know what I chose? The opposite. I lived alone, desperate and miserable, and drove Bucky mad refusing everything he tried to give me.”
“This can’t be legal,” is Steve’s take on Harley’s triumph. “This—Tony, this is exactly the kind of illegal we—we, uh, have serious discussions that will always be responsibly resolved—”
When Steve met Peter Parker, he didn't know this would happen. Didn't know that he would have one conversation with the kid and think "I can help. I can help him."
“Look,” Harley pleads. “Look, this kid—he needs help. He helped us. We owe him, right? Does it really matter how many government agencies I hacked to find him?”
“That’s why I love you,” Dad croons. He gets extra sappy every time Harley acts up, because he’s just that petty. “The Man with the Plan. Sleep is an excellent plan.”
The only reason why Tony turned Steve’s proposal down is because he thinks he won’t make a good husband. Nothing more, nothing less.
And then there’s Tony. Tony who’s always out partying. Drunk and high. Having models and socialites hanging onto his arms.
“Yes, they will,” Tony insists. “Me a part of a fake public proposal? The stocks are going to plunge, the board will be on me even more than usual, and the media—”
Steve beams with pride. “The one and only. I mean, who could resist him? As I told Justin Hammer before this, Tony’s one of the smartest people around but also the most beautiful person I’ve ever met. It’s probably shallow of me to say that but you know, appearances are what you usually notice about a person. But he was the first person I saw when I was defrosted. And I remember thinking, ‘Wow. He’s beautiful.’ Then, I got to know him and he’s also beautiful on the inside. His heart is as golden as his armor. I can assure you that. Even—”
“I love you,” Steve says. “I still do. There’s not a day that passes that I didn’t miss you. Regret leaving you the way I did. I wanted to tell you, to write to you. I wanted to show up at your door every time I was in the city. But I know that if I did, I’d get us both in trouble.”
“About time you guys pulled yourselves together,” Clint finally says, sipping on his chocolate milkshake.
“Of course I’d notice,” Tony exclaims, sounding surprisingly offended. His eyes soften, his voice lowering. “I’ve always noticed you.”
“I figured you’d say that. So, you know.” Tony climbs up to his feet, pulling one of his desk drawers open and reaching inside. “I didn’t lock myself up for no reason. Here. It’s not vibranium but uh, hope you like it.”
Steve squares his shoulders. He’s wasted days trying to psyche himself up, wasted days listening to his friends psyching him up for this moment. He can’t waste this moment. Not again. Not when he knows better now.
“You have my heartiest felicitations!” Thor cries, banging his fist on the coffee table. It’s a good thing Tony reinforced it not long ago. “May your love be enduring and may you both be blessed with many babes—”
“Yeah. It was like three am and I was hungry. I was lazy to whip up something so I just ate the whole jar of it.”
Steve doesn’t get to reply because their path is blocked once again, this time by an elderly couple.
Tony purses his lips, his eyes twinkling with mischief. “What can I say? I like watching you blush.”
Tony tries to put the thought out of his head as he gets ready for bed. But even as he slips under the covers, his mind insists otherwise.
The rest of the evening goes in a similar fashion. Every time a new conversation is struck, Steve's ready to wax poetic about Tony, launching into a speech ranging from Tony’s achievements and genius ideas to the mutual affection Tony and the Avengers have for each other.
Steve and Sharon. The golden couple. With their perfect blonde hair and perfect blue eyes and perfect teeth and perfect everything.
Tony’s eyes narrow but thankfully lets it go. “It was great,” he says, shrugging his jacket off his shoulders. Once again, Steve tries to avert his gaze. “Bobbi took me to Coney Island.”
“And five hundred more,” Tony adds, clinking their drinks together. “Until you meet your mate, that is.”
Tony’s used to going alone. He isn’t one for hiring or inviting anyone to be eye candy. His friends show up every now and then to show him support or for publicity purposes. But never as his date. Ever.
Steve grimaces. “Yeah. Had to skip school for a week. Ma wouldn’t stop saying, ‘I told you so’, for days.”
The two of them seem to be whispering furiously as he approaches. He probably would’ve been able to make out what they’re discussing if everyone didn’t resume speaking.
There’s something behind his eyes that shakes Tony’s insides. But he turns away and makes a move to his car because he can't, he really can't—
He instantly regrets the accusatory tone when Tony flinches. If he hadn’t been for his four-year friendship with Tony, Steve's pretty sure he wouldn’t have noticed. Tony's tells are subtle like that.
“Here,” he says, pushing a drawing of them into Tony’s hands. It’s them chasing each other in the park with smiles on their faces last spring. “Something to remember me by. If you still remember it’s from me.”
But the thing is, he would rather not eat pineapple pizza for the rest of his life if it meant having Tony on the loveseat next to him, have their heads bent together as they chat and laugh and ignore everything and everyone.
Tony huffs, crossing his arms over his chest as he juts his nose to the ceiling. “Like… Like you’re in love with me.”
“I don’t mean that she salutes the flag before she sleeps. Unless she does it now but—” Clint pauses, shrinking at Natasha’s scowl. “Like think about it. They’re both blonde and blue-eyed. They’re both SHIELD agents who’re obsessed with leather and motorcycles. They’re both hot and smart and witty as hell. I could go on—”
“Tony is not a thing to be paraded around,” he replies coolly. “He’s a human being and my partner. He has every right to want to keep our relationship quiet. I’m not afraid of showing him off at all.” His grip on Tony tightens in a more possessive grasp. Tony shouldn’t find it as flattering and hot as he does. “He’s a genius, a philanthropist. One of the most brilliant and resourceful men I’ve met in the world, even. The Avengers are lucky to have him on the team, on our side. Don’t you ever think that—”
“It’s not. I just…” He crosses his arms across his chest. “Look, I’m fine. I’ve gotten hurt over worse. You do know the serum would’ve healed me in a jiffy, right?”
Tony continues to poke holes in his waffles, trying his best to ignore the pairs of eyes zeroing on him.
She’s perfect. So is he. They’ll make each other happy. Better than Tony could ever. And that’s okay.
Steve’s imagination has entertained the most outrageous things over the years. Take the time he thought he was the descendant of Captain America, for example (he was five, sue him). Or maybe the time he thought he saw God when Scott Lang accidentally nailed him on the head with a football because concussions.
But he must’ve said out loud because Tony’s letting out a quiet chuckle. “That’s because I’ve been crushing on you ever since we met.”
does Johnny look like him) but boring. Steve isn’t as open to trying new things as Johnny is, and steers clear of the big parties and events Tony is forced to attend. Unlike Johnny.
“What you mean 'why you'? I love you because you’re you. I didn't fall in love with your muscles and super strength and your spangled ass. I fell in love with your smile, your kindness, your compassion, your— I'm gonna shut up now before I say something dumber.”
Great. Now Steve thinks Tony is pining for his spangled ass. Which is true but fuck, he never meant for him to know. Especially like this. Definitely not like this.
“She kissed his cheek,” Steve interrupts, his voice barely a whisper. “Twice. And she was wearing one of his shirts.”
“That's super cool of you.” Kamala’s comforted expression slips back into a tentative one. “I, uh, I also have another question. It’s about you know, designs for my suit. If that’s okay with you. And if you have the time to talk.”
There’s thunderous applause when Steve finishes his speech. It's a feat considering the space in the hangar. Unsurprising considering he’s Captain fucking America. Even if he isn’t, Steve has a knack for having people hanging onto his every word.
“What if I want to be more than friends,” Steve continues, wringing his hands, his cheeks reddening with each passing second. “What if—”
The smile he sends Tony’s way leaves a warmth in his chest like it always seems to do. He hates it so, so much.
. He’s Iron Man. He’s from the Civil War line. He knows very well that Steve doesn’t care for him. Every MCU Steve except probably Endgame Steve doesn’t care for him, including Miles’ sad and pathetic Infinity War Steve. Miles’ Steve only feels ill-disguised guilt and probable anger for Tony.
She flashes him another smile and pecks his other cheek, before slipping away, leaving him to his thoughts.
Tony jerks upwards, his fingers accidentally playing a discordant chord. The reprimand on his lips dies out when he sees who’s at the door.
He made it after a conversation with Bucky and Sam, which involved them trying to persuade Steve to ask Tony out for the millionth time. And just like all those times before, Steve had chickened out, opting to channel his feelings through art instead.
intelligent, compassionate, and cunning. These are traits she and Tony definitely have in common. It's no surprise Bruce picked her.
Steve raises an eyebrow but doesn’t say anything. Tony hates that they’ve been reduced to this – strangers who tell each other lies.
When Tony wakes in the morning to Steve’s beautiful face and beautiful smile, he knows it’s time to end this.
Maybe it’s the close proximity they’re in right now. Maybe it’s the ballad in the background or the soft smile Steve is flashing him or the intensity behind his gaze. Maybe it’s the impending union they have to fake again once the song’s winds to a close.
Steve’s heart skips a beat, drinking him in. Sleepy Tony has always been a sight – his messy hair, half-lidded eyes, his quiet grumbles. It’s just absolutely adorable.
They lapse into comfortable silence after that, letting Bruce Springsteen croon them all the way to Central Park. Steve takes the opportunity to run things through his head.
For a moment, he lets himself forget that this is all an act, that Steve and him really are in a relationship.
Steve’s footsteps must’ve been loud because their head twists behind, a pair bright blue eyes eyeing him with genuine warmth.
He knows Bucky hasn’t always been a fan of his, always harbored suspicion, throwing in jabs at Tony every now and then.
Clint’s eyes widen. “Holy fuck. Le Bernardin? That’s like one of the most expensive places in the city.”
“We should watch a movie next week,” Tony begins. “In the cinema. It’s been a while since we went to the cinema.”
Yet here he is at the annual gala for the Maria Stark Foundation, getting ready to play a role he loathes.
Thankfully, JARVIS doesn’t make a comment at Steve’s embarrassing escape, silently directing him upwards. The whole elevator ride feels like forever, Steve’s shame growing by the second.
Tony brightens. “Oh god, Asgard was… Holy fucking shitballs, Steve. I was in freaking Asgard! Like I can’t begin to tell you how freaking amazing it was!”
The way Steve stares at him is both comical and flattering. “Wow,” he says with a low whistle. “You really are a genius.”
“Even in your fuckboy phrase. Every time I saw pictures of you, videos of you, you just… You look different. Not the boy I remember.”
The smile he receives in return is blinding. The smile that he's always wanted trained his way for years. The smile that's now meant for him and only him.
That isn’t brand new information. Tony’s heard Miles and Kamala discuss it a couple of times before. But to actually hear it from the source, from the man himself—
Their friends move to vacate the room, not without protests from Clint. As soon as the door closes shut behind them, Tony shifts his attention to Steve, crossing his arms.
“Eager to head back, are we?” Tony asks. He sounds like he’s teasing but the little edge in his tone that unsettles Steve.
There are a lot of things Steve knows about Tony – that his favorite color's red. That his love for coffee’s unparalleled. That Tony has no interest in inheriting his father’s company but wouldn’t mind working in the R&D department.
His eyebrows knit, zeroing on Steve’s bruised cheek. He uncurls his fist, reaching over. “I was worried,” he murmurs.
“I am,” Steve half-lies, trying his best to hide his arousal and annoyance. He shouldn’t be upset. He and Tony are being rescued from their date with death, after all. “It's good to see you.”
There’s an odd edge to Steve’s voice, something Tony can’t identify. Tony’s tempted to prod, but judging by his flushed cheeks, clenched fists, and gritted teeth, Tony doubts he’d get a proper answer out of Steve. Instead, Tony mentally files the observation away for the moment.
They’re called the Avengers, a superhero team dedicated to protect and avenge. Iron Man’s the leader.
If Steve's cheeks were warm before, they're definitely on fire now. He knows how much Peter Parker means to Tony. Their close brotherly relationship, something that warms Steve’s heart.
But still, Steve can’t wrap his head around who this is. A friend, maybe. One Steve hasn’t met before. Or maybe this person isn’t Tony’s friend. Maybe it’s one of Hulk’s secret pals or Natasha’s or—
“No!” Steve exclaims hastily. “I was just—” His eyes narrow at Tony’s shaking shoulders. “Seriously, Tony?”
“—but I never stopped thinking about you. Sometimes, I’d think about what could’ve been. More often than I should. I used to wonder why I couldn’t stop thinking about you. Why I could never stay, let anyone stay.” Tony sighs into Steve’s shoulder. “You ruined me, Rogers. You ruined me for everyone else. And I hated you so much for that.”
His eyes drift down to the wool blanket that’s cocooned around him. Tony moves to unwrap the fabric. A hand on his shoulder stops him in place.
Steve lets out an annoyed exhale, sitting up straighter on the bed. “You know what. I’ll go to Howard. First thing tomorrow. I’ll tell him to take you back and—”
“It’s not funny,” he begins when he hands the card over, “and it’s pretty corny and kinda simple but—”
“No,” Tony repeats, this time quieter, softer, and all too loving. “I do. I do feel the same about you. I’ve been in love with you since we met too.”
This isn’t like the other kisses they’ve shared, brief and chaste. Steve kisses like he fights, focused and furious and intense. Tony couldn’t help but give in, wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck.
He can easily remember everything about that night. The conversations they had, of the way Steve threw his head back as he laughed at a shitty pun Tony made, of the grease staining their fingers as they shared a bowl of fries, of the bar lights casting a golden halo over Steve’s head because he’s goddamn fucking angel.
Her grin widens. It’s the one Steve loathes with every fiber of his being. The one that tells him she knows something he doesn’t. The one that tells him he’s being a dumbass.
Once again, Tony outdoes himself, dressed in a T-shirt-blazer combo, along with dark jeans and dress shoes. Steve isn’t sure whose idea it is but he hates them for it and he hates everything about this situation,
His mother had defended Tony, had stormed out of the room and found him crying in the corridor, had taken him into her arms and kissed his tears away.
Tears threaten to spill through his eyelids again. Tony distracts himself by closing off Humpty Dumpty with a flourish, his fingers manically following one key after another as the song breaks into a furious crescendo. He almost crushes Steve’s fingers in the process.
Tony had pegged Kamala for a Marvel fan but he didn’t expect the various merchandise filling her room, from posters to mugs to toys. Even her walls are painted in familiar red, gold, and blue.
A blur hits Zola in the chest. He crumples to the ground in an instant. The blur doesn't stop, sailing over Tony's head and bounces off a nearby wall before disappearing from sight.
The bell chimes behind them. An elderly couple makes a beeline towards the cake display, arm-in-arm.
Despite Tony’s protests, he later finds himself sprawled on Natasha’s couch with a box of pepperoni pizza between them.
many things he wants to say. All the words and sentences clash in his head, swirling around in a whirlpool of anxiety, hope, and fear.
“I know it’s difficult to reconcile with such a thought but Tony, you do. You’re one of the best people I know. You do deserve him. I’ve seen the way he looks at you. He genuinely and wholeheartedly loves you.”
“You get ‘Winghead’,” Tony counters. “You get ‘Prince Charming’ and ‘Adonis’ and ‘Beloved’. And I swear I used to call you a ‘Capsicle’ when we first got you defrosted. That’s like twice the number of nicknames Carol
“Don’t need to thank me, Mr Stark,” Cap replies, sitting a short distance away from Tony. The gesture shouldn’t have stung as much as it does.
“I’m going to make this clear so you’ll stop treating poor Carol terribly because she didn’t deserve the cold treatment you’ve been giving her. Let’s get one thing straight, Carol is and will always remain my friend. I do not plan on kissing her or dating her because one—”
It takes everything in Tony not to scream. All he could do is stiffen in place, the melody he’s playing coming to an abrupt and dissonant halt.
“Don’t bullshit me, Steve,” Tony snaps. “You know what I’m talking about. Your weird, one-sided beef with Johnny.”
Guilt seeps into his heart. Tony can’t stand the sight of a kid getting upset, especially because of him. Even after all this time, Kamala’s still a little starstruck and nervous around all of them. Tony gets it. He’s known Steve for years and he still pinches himself about it from time to time.
He doesn’t think about how lonely he is as he watches his friends gather their lovers in embraces and waltzes.
Tony waved his hand in dismissal, ignoring Steve’s attempts at comfort as usual. “Sure. The whole package meaning my wealth, my company, etcetera.”
That grabs Tony’s attention, turning as Steve speaks. Steve almost wavers at the sight of Tony’s face.
“Even then,” Tony echoes firmly. “Because I love him. I’ll always love him. There’ll always be a part of me that’ll love him. Because he’s everything good in this world, everything I aspire to be. He makes me want to be good. Be better even though I never could measure up to him. And he’s right to dump me. Because he deserves better than some fuckup like me. And I’m glad he dumped me because he deserves better.”
Steve’s blush deepens. “I didn’t have any nightmares. Just couldn’t sleep. I asked him if you were awake but he told me you weren’t. So I headed down to the gym, beat some punching bags around. He only told me you’re up a moment ago.”
But then he remembers and suddenly he’s crumbling to the ground because all he can think of is Steve pressing him against that door that’s miles and miles away and kissing the life out of him.
Which of course, brings him to this moment – being carried bridal-styled out of a ‘burning building’ (which is just a Barbie dreamhouse covered in paper cutouts of fire) by Steve Rogers.
Steve bristles as Bobbi returns his flirtation with ease. She isn’t special for owning a motorcycle or decking out in a leather jacket of her own, on top of the leather fingerless gloves and matching boots she has on. Steve rides a motorcycle, a Harley-Davidson in fact. And he wears leather jackets. He'll definitely wear them more often next time.
Ever since they watched the sunset perched on the edge of Miles’ window sill like a pair of idiots, Steve’s taken every opportunity to seek Tony out. Whenever Tony isn’t occupied with someone else, Steve sidles up to him to initiate conversation about anything random, from the latest beef between Sam and Bucky to the differences between cupcakes and muffins.
“You know,” Tony begins after the food has been cleared and they’ve finished a lapse of comfortable silence. “I always thought about how funny this is.”
“Oh no, you don’t,” Steve interrupts, resting his hand on Tony’s shoulder. Years ago, Tony would’ve shrugged him off. Now, Steve’s glad Tony’s willing to let Steve touch him, let alone hand him things. “We’re having breakfast. Bruce's making breakfast tacos and you are going to join us.”
“C’mon, Hill. This is a party! Not a stuffy ass meeting. If you wanna talk shop, leave an appointment with JAR—”
Reed shakes his head, flashing him a smile. “Not at all, Captain. I think I should steal my wife for a dance as well. Congratulations on the engagement once again.” He gives them a nod in turn and a knowing look at Tony as he takes his leave.
Besides, he really doesn’t want to be the guy to break Steven Grant Rogers’ heart. Bucky might shoot him in his sleep.
“I mean, he isn’t entirely wrong,” Tony replies. “I mean, out of all the toy lines, I think we’re the best examples of that.”
Steve thinks of pulling him into one last hug, thinks of finally telling him everything, thinks of pressing his l—
Tony’s smoothing down his clothes when JARVIS announces that Steve’s requesting access to Tony’s room.
“Hey, I’m trying to list all the reasons why you’re amazing and why anyone would be lucky to have you. Don’t interrupt me.”
The door opens with a series of beeps. Footsteps approach. Tony braces himself before spinning on his heel.
Steve’s standing in the lobby downstairs, dressed in a navy two-piece. It's an outfit Tony’s seen him in one too many times. And yet every time he lays his eyes on Steve, it feels like the first time.
“There’s nothing wrong with that.” Tony reaches for his hand, and Steve willingly takes the touch. “I love you. I want to hear about the things happening in your life, and right now, a lot of that is Peter. So talk about him as much as you want, alright?”
“Cool your itty-bitty tits,” the leader-bully mocks. “We’re helping you out! We’re doing a series on what random people keep in their bags. You’ll be Tik-Tok famous!” His sniggering sidekick is holding his phone up, probably already recording.
“I’ll keep you two updated,” Tony says softly, a soft hand for each of his kids’ heads. “Grab a snack, play a game, everything’s gonna be okay, got it?”
She’s always had a good life. Maggie’s father may not have wanted her, but her mother cherished her and her brother protected her, and his biological father--Tony Stark-- chose her. Maggie loves Tony, calls him dad, thinks nobody can touch him. He’s the one who taught her what it meant to be a good person, to look at the world around you and decide to make it better. He uses his talents to help others, and he’s teaching her to do the same. With his heart and his mind and his money.
The thought of his uncle makes Peter's chest cinch together. He tries to ignore the sweep of nausea. Grits his teeth until it hurts and the pain distracts him. From there, he finds the locker room and spends his shower running through formulas for his trig test under his breath. He closes his eyes, loses himself in the math, and for a little while—he forgets. Peter forgets listening to May when she shoved him into a closet and asked him to
a kung fu master, because he twists this way and that until one of the bullies accidentally clocks the other, and that one starts crying while the other keeps shouting the same dirty words over and over, and Ringleader-Bully gets to his feet and starts sneaking away.
“Of course, sweetheart,” Steve assures, big hand warm around her shoulders. “As soon as Christmas break starts, right? That’s our deal.” But he’s staring after where Peter disappeared, frowning.
And he braids Maggie's hair. He studies the color wheel to be able to properly comment on Maggie's work. He stays up as they talk about how pretty girls are and the best type of nail polish to wear with their school uniforms.
All of this is discussed by the time they get their drinks and find a seat at a table. Peter doesn't know whether he's exhausted by Maggie, or completely under her spell.
“Let’s hope you’ve grown out of that phase,” Dad says, light and teasing like it’s a joke, but Harley sees the way he holds on tighter.
Peter purses his lips. “But at what cost did that decision come? With great...with great power, you have a responsibility to use it in a way that makes the world a better place! What about dropping a bomb on civilians makes the world a better place? We killed women, and men, and children. So did Hitler, so did Mussolini, Stalin, and every other person who’s the ‘bad guy.’ Why was it okay when the U.S. did it?”
“I’m sure,” Steve says instantly, hand coming up to cup Tony’s cheek. Then he bites his lip, caution sliding over open joy. “I do have, um, one question of my own...”
” Maggie insists, like this cryptic one-name message is both incredibly important and stupidly obvious.
“I hate you!” Maggie yells. She backs up, but just to grab more slush.The first handful misses, the second hits one of the sidekicks. A passerby steps on one of Maggie’s drawings, , too preoccupied by pretending not to see the big boys closing in on her. Maggie stares down at her precious portfolio scattered along the sidewalk and feels rage build within her. “I didn’t do anything to you! Eat shit, shitheads—” she begins to crouch to pick up more ice to throw, but the biggest boy is too close. Maggie panics and surges forward instead, shoving him away with both hands. He just laughs at her while grabbing her wrists, wrenching her arms above her head. Maggie spits and it lands on his coat, but he doesn’t let go.
Peter's stomach rolls every time they walk in; is it a coincidence that the week Peter saves a little girl with his superhuman strength, and Captain America is somehow close to her, they start showing up at his favorite youth center? Are they looking for him, tracking him down and wanting him to explain his strength? And if they find him, will they try to make him stop being Spider-Man or arrest him?
“Not to mention the mafia-held waterfront warehouse CCTVs,” Dad says at the same time, slipping from stern to proud. “I’m out of the country for two days and you’re stalking the damn mafia?—But hey, nice job there, kid. I sent a tip-off to the FBI, they’re shutting down a major drug shipment as we speak—”
He forgets about hearing the bullets ring out and leaving the closet, choosing to try and stop the bleeding on May's stomach or Ben's neck. He forgets about Jimmy and Karen, foster parents who smacked him every time he asked a question and had locks on the fridge and cabinets.
“When we met,” Maggie finishes. The coat of arms still carries the shape of Steve’s shield and the arc reactor, her paintbrush and Harley’s wrench, but she’d added something new. “The spider is obviously you.”
“Okay, so ground me, take my debit cards until I learn my lesson, whatever,” Harley says, not even bitterly—the hypocrisy going on here is all kinds of ridiculous, and it’s just as thick from Steve “Regularly Disregards Every Kind of Law and Authority in Search of Truth” Rogers as it is from Tony “Hacks the Nearest Database Out of Habit” Stark—but he’s on a mission. No-last-name Peter, Maggie’s Knight in Shining Armor, is Peter Parker. Peter Parker, twice-orphaned foster-care runaway. Peter Parker, star student at Midtown School of Science and Technology. Peter Parker, homeless. Peter Parker, Spider-man.
“That’s exactly what you’re going to do.” Tony meets his son’s eyes. Holds. Harley gives in with a duck of his chin and reluctant half-step back, and Tony sends up silent thanks.
“If you’ll have me,” Steve says, blushing and grinning and kissing Tony again. “I’m yours, Tony, always.”
“Yeah,” Harley says, face twisting guiltily. “I thought he was the reason Maggie hit the emergency button at first. Must have scared him away. Shi...oot. Goshdarnit. I wanted to thank him. Return the favor.”
Mystery Kid turns around. “You okay? Sorry I didn’t get here sooner! I mean of course you’re not okay, no one should ever deal with that crap. But are you hurt? Anything scraped, sprained, bleeding?”
She’s scooping up gross, gritty, half-frozen slush from the snow-plow pile at the edge of the sidewalk before the stupid boys are halfway through their Tik-Tok intro. Leader-bully starts to unsnap the portfolio case’s leather cover—it’s a super nice case. Captain America gave it to her.
“How bad?” Sick dread coils cold in Tony’s gut. “That’s—Peter’s blood. All of this—” he gestures helplessly at Steve’s soaked shirt.
Steve cannot help himself. He leans forward and asks Peter, “How is it you came to have such strong opinions on power and responsibility?”
Peter Parker. Maggie loves Peter and his selflessness. He has a weird determination to improve the lives of every single person around him. He protects the people of New York because nobody protected him. He looks like a dork when he drinks milk with dinner (even lasagna!) or snorts at the cheesy jokes in Star Wars. Peter doesn't know how to talk to girls, he walks into walls despite his super senses, and…
“I’m serious,” Tony says, pouting just a tiny bit. “Gods and aliens exist, I’m not ruling out an afterlife. And if I get one, I want to spend it with you.”
“I’ll take that as a yes?” Tony says, befuddled and confused but very, very happy the moment Steve’s lips leave his long enough to get a word out.
Steve frowns. “You’re talking about the kid who was standing with you when I drove up? He split real fast.”
“Say, Rogers,” Tony adds to the tail end of a yawn, reeling in from a luxurious stretch, curling home into his favorite place in the entire universe: Steven Grant Rogers’s arms. Things have been hectic. It’s been too long since they got a morning like this: just the two of them, resting and happy.
“Um, no,” Harley says, sass creeping up to impertinent levels. “We want to make sure Steve understands what it means to marry
“I still think you should try,” Natasha says. “If you want. I’m pretty sure you’ll like the outcome.”
Tony shouldn't be upset. It’s not like Steve and Tony are dating, let alone in love, in Steve’s case. Their relationship's built on casual sex and friendship. Nothing more. Tony's long accepted the fact he's meant to be a placeholder for the person who would heal Steve's lonely heart.
“Something for a special someone, huh?” he asks, hoping he doesn’t sound as disappointed as he feels.
He could feel Steve tracking Tony’s movements as he pulls out another cigarette. This time, he doesn’t offer to light it.
“Oh right. Sorry. Rambling. But yeah, I know what you’re gonna say, ‘Why do you need Carol? Aren’t you a genius?’ Well, newsflash, I don’t know jack shit about engagement rings.” He pauses. “I mean, I could’ve asked Natasha or Sharon but you know, they kinda scare me sometimes. And since Carol found me losing my mind in the workshop and since she’s staying over—”
“I haven’t gone on a date with a guy in a while. Probably haven’t since you got defrosted, I think.” He shrugs. “So I can’t be mad at you about it.”
Which means they’ve done it enough times for Tony to be okay with it. Steve isn’t sure what to make of that.
He escapes his kidnappers. Finds his way to safety. Comes home. Fights another battle that is the devil named Obadiah Stane.
Steve nods. There’s a sparkle in his eyes. Tony doesn’t let himself hope. “I know it’s cliché for me to say but it’s true. I met him as Iron Man first and I remember being enchanted by his grace and intelligence.”
Not that Hammer knows that. Hell, only Tony’s close friends do. Still, it doesn't change how it feels.
Tony feels his cheeks warm. “Rhodey actually dared me to master it in a year. I did it in six months.”
He shouldn’t feel upset. Disappointed. After all, he’s scrawny, little Steve Rogers, the outcast of the school. How could he think that the smartest, most handsome, and most charming guy he's ever known would give him a second glance? Tony’s way out of his league. Guys like Tony go for jocks and cheerleaders and other trust fun kids. Not nobodies like Steve.
Slowly, he cracks an eyelid open. There’s a campfire in front of him and his clothes are laid out not far from his feet. Further on is what looks like to be the mouth of a cave. Outside, a thunderstorm rages on.
Fortunately for Tony, his secret stash of gummy bears remains untouched. He snatches it up before hustling over to the elevator, just in case he bumps into anyone.
“You’re right,” Miles whispers in awe as Cartoon Steve screams Cartoon Tony’s name for the gazillionth time. “They like each other.”
It must’ve worked because her lips twist into a knowing smile. Steve doesn’t like the implication of that.
Steve couldn’t help but huff. Tony can be overly dramatic and sulky and pouty when things don’t go his way. It’s infuriatingly adorable.
He has to admit, Natasha has outdone herself this time, putting him in a black vest over a cobalt blue dress shirt with slacks and high-tops. Steve feels both comfortable and out of his element at the same time.
Natasha’s threat (Tony has no doubt it’s a real threat. It’s Natasha, after all) happened a couple of days ago. Tony hasn’t bothered acting on her words.
She had shaken her head before leading him to the music room, sat him down next to her on the same stool he sits on now, and played this very song to him.
He doesn’t hear about the move until weeks later. And even then, the news isn’t even from Steve himself.
“Now that we’ve gotten that all cleared up,” Tony begins when they break apart, “I heard you were going to have a pizza party yourself. Got room for your boyfriend?”
He’d relive the final moments of battle – him shooting through the sky with a nuke on his back. It usually ends in him saving the city, his body floating among the stars for eternity. Other nights, Tony falls and falls and never stops. Several times, he wakes up to ice in his veins and blood in his mouth. Those times are the worst. They’d leave him shaking until daybreak.
It’s nothing like the fireworks or blaze he expected it to be. Kissing Steve is quiet, slow, and warm. Like coming home from hell. Given how the night has been going, it might as well have been.
He doesn’t bother lifting his head up to greet them, choosing to burrow his face further into his pillow. The bed dips in various places. A soft hand cards through his hair.
So, Tony hadn’t been hallucinating. Only it hadn’t been Steve who came for him, but Captain America. Which is good. Very, very good.
“Oh. Right.” Steve nods vigorously, tracing the rim of his mug. “I thought you looked familiar. I’ve seen you in the news and in uh, pictures.”
Hammer doesn’t seem as happy about the turn of events though, his smile thinning. “Captain Rogers! What a pleasant surprise. I didn’t expect to see you here, considering you’re always absent.”
Carol snickers as she leans in for another kiss and Steve is definitely not staring. Not at all. No sirree. Carol and Tony have the right to display their affection for each other in front of him and Steve definitely doesn’t feel like a third wheel and—
“Sharon told me there’s like a three-month wait to snag a spot,” Natasha continues, spooning fried rice between her lips. “How did you even get one?”
Because this is Steve Rogers who he’s talking to, the man who broke his heart, the man Tony thought he’s over and done with, the man he’s still hopelessly in love with after five miserable years.
Tony’s leaning against his Porsche, nervously wringing his hands. He brightens up at the sight of Steve.
He swings his legs off the bed, eager to escape. Fingers latch onto his wrist, stilling him in place.
“Good! Everyone’s good. My dad sends his regards.” She rubs the back of her neck. “I, uh… I was wondering if I could ask you a question.”
He doesn’t wait for him, doesn’t look up to see his reaction, dashing off to find Jan so he can get the fuck home.
Natasha reaches over to pluck a handful of fries off Sam’s plate, ignoring his protests. “There was still too much pining happening between you two. There shouldn’t be any pining involved between fiancés.”
Instead, fingers wrap around his wrist, yanking him into a dark alley. Before he can open his mouth, he’s enveloped in nothing but heat.
Then again, being alone with Cap means that their friends won't be teasing him about being naked in front of a national icon. Small mercies, he supposes.
Silence befalls them at the sudden outburst except for the Katy Perry song blasting from the speakers. It’s not surprising, considering it’s coming from Steve of all people.
Tony scowls, his heckles and humiliation rising. “Look, Cap. I’m a big boy. I can handle playing second fiddle. I’ve always had my whole life. No one wants me. No one loves me. So don't act like you do. So get out of here and see your fucking soulmate and leave me to—to—”
He should turn her down and look for Steve. Stay by his side. Make sure he doesn’t run off before midnight so he can kiss his stupid, stupid smile because he’s a coward.
Whenever Tony does something, he gives himself to it. Playing an instrument is no different. It’s easy to lose himself in his music the same way he loses himself in his work, to let the symphonies consume him whole, to let his senses be overtaken. He only surfaces when a song ends but it’s always fleeting, his fingers itching to start another.
eyes are boring into Tony’s and they’re slowly dilating and all Tony wants to do is press him down. Hold him down and lean forward to—
Neither of them speaks for a long moment. Tony could imagine the thoughts turning in Steve’s head. Steve’s always been one to fixate on the weirdest details.
“Yeah,” Tony echoes, his voice a murmur. He clears his throat, his eyes glancing away. It’s times like these that he’s glad he has his helmeted head screwed on. He doubts he could take Steve’s reactions to Tony’s expressions. “I wasn’t talking to you, by the way. I was talking to Peter.”
“And Johnny said he’d set my stash of blueberries on fire,” Tony admits. “Plus, JARVIS kicked me out of the workshop so you know. That sealed the deal.”
“Should we head back to the Tower?” he asks, hoping for the opposite. He’s been having such a wonderful time, just the two of them. He’s reluctant to let the day end, to let Tony return to Carol. “I’m sure—”
Steve lets him scream at him. Lets him stomp his feet. Lets him tell him what a fucking idiot he is, that he’s going to get himself killed, that—
Tony's gaze drifts over to the ballroom. Somehow, they've garnered some attention. It isn't surprising considering they're Captain America and Tony Stark. But the glances are pointed at their linked arms, with some attendees whispering to each other.
Tony takes his time in the shower, getting dressed, and styling his hair. If anyone could see him right now, they'd probably think about how ridiculous he's being, how effort he's wasting. It’s dinner with Steve, after all. Tony could be wearing a rucksack and Steve wouldn’t even bat an eye.
What's surprising is Tony's reaction. The Tony in front of them can’t be the same Tony who has to be dragged or hauled out of his workshop for meals or gatherings, let alone galas and big parties. For him to willingly agree to be set up on blind dates by his friends is a huge breakthrough.
Tony’s so much older now, with wrinkles and laugh lines and a goatee painted on his face. His eyes and smile are as bright as the last time he’s seen them in person.
Tony snorts. “Seriously? C’mon Steve. You’re amazing. You’re loyal, smart, sweet, caring, have wonderful abs—”
“It’s not funny, Tony,” Steve mutters as Tony pries his hands away, and god, has his eyes always been this brown? Has his lips has always been this pink, felt this soft? Fuck, they’re so soft.
It doesn’t make sense. Before this, Tony had been on the brink of death and his repulsor pump was almost empty. How could he feel fine now? The only reason he could think of is that someone recharged while he was unconscious.
,” Clint continues, “this is totally gonna work. They’re both hot and they both know they’re hot. They’re both smart and they both know they’re smart. She loves chardonnay. He loves whiskey.” He spreads his hands. “Match made in heaven.”
That’s when he notices Steve’s getup – a dress shirt that brings out the silver in his eyes, slacks, and a pair of ankle socks. His typical tousled hair is slicked back. Tony’s pretty sure it’s gelled.
“Did everyone leave on a holiday to the Bahamas without me or what?” Tony mutters, stomping over to the cabinets.
Tony swallows the bile crawling up his throat. “I couldn’t find you! I thought you snuck away. Got yourself killed out in the field. And all I could think was how much I wronged you and you died thinking I hated you and thought you weak when that’s the furthest from the truth and I—I—”
Tony lets himself take him in, take in those long lashes and his unblemished skin and the light freckles dusting his cheeks. Features meant for someone else to admire.
It takes everything in Tony to not reach over. To cup his jaw in his hands. To not run his fingers through his hair. To not taste the sugar on his lips.
. Isn’t seven months too long to keep your relationship secret? I mean, Tony here deserves to be shown off, not hidden away like an embarrassment.”
It’s a set of color pencils, the kind that costs a lot. Ma had told him they couldn’t afford it when he asked her.
“Shut up. This isn’t funny, Rogers,” Tony mutters before lifting his head up. “Do you really want to shackle yourself to me for another five hundred years?”
“They’ll kill you,” Steve says, wrinkling his nose as he wedges it between his teeth before offering to light Tony’s.
Pepper and Sharon are clutching each other, their cheeks tear-streaked. Natasha’s hands are balled into fists. Carol keeps her distance from the bottles, her eyes trained on Tony’s. Rhodey sighs, thumbing the empty bottle in his grip.
Tony freezes, his next words dying on his lips. That’s unexpected. Super unexpected. Super unexpected to the point that he’s gaping like a fish for the next several moments.
Carol pushes another mug Tony’s way. Unlike Steve’s, the coffee is served in Tony’s own mug. And not just any mug. It’s Tony’s favorite, the red and gold one with a black cat slapped in the middle.
Tony’s standing in front of the shelves of breakfast cereal, debating on which one has the highest sugar content when he inhales that scent and hears that quiet timbre coming from behind him.
“Come on, Cap,” Clint says. “We all know Tony needs some pick-me-up. Locking himself up and moping over his last breakup isn’t healthy.”
Tony doesn’t know why they don’t. It’d make sense to. They’re all friends. They’d understand how stupid the whole thing is, even if Tony has to suffer at the hands of their teasing.
“I know guys with none of that worth ten of you,” Captain America spits in his face and Tony can’t look away, can’t tear his gaze away from those bright blue eyes behind Cap’s cowl have him rooted on the spot.
Throughout the whole spiel, Steve’s ears are a bright shade of red. Tony lets himself indulge, lets himself wonder if everything Steve is saying is a lie.
Considering Tony and Hank’s hostile relationship at the moment, it’s obvious Hank says it for Steve’s benefit, which is fine since Tony doesn’t give a shit about Hank Pym.
Tony picks at the hem of his cape. “It’s been five hundred years, Steve. I just— Aren’t you lonely?”
“Nope,” she replies, leaning over to peck him on the cheek. “I can kiss you if you want. If you don’t choose to kiss Steve.”
It feels like an eternity, both of them staring each other down in silence. Steve should’ve predicted this. Of course, confessing his feelings for Tony wouldn’t be smooth sailing, but he always expected to either have his feelings reciprocated or otherwise. Tony’s reaction doesn’t indicate on which side he falls in. It’s terrifying, not knowing.
“I think we should stop here,” Steve tells him. “Before we get more miserable. We don’t make each other happy anymore.”
“You know,” Tony murmurs against his lips, “I almost agreed to a second date with Johnny. He was fun. He made me laugh. And he’s a good kisser—”
“So,” he begins, eager to be skinned alive as soon as possible and half-hoping Bucky’s hiding somewhere with his rifle somewhere, “what is it you wanna—”
“You did ask,” Steve says. “I can go on, you know. There are so many things that have happened here.”
When Steve and Natasha resume their spar, Steve makes sure to jab harder and dodge faster, to try to win. He knows he’s getting reckless. Sloppy.
As expected, JARVIS does as he’s told, leaving Tony in silence for the rest of his ride down to the communal room, which is surprisingly empty.
Which is just a bunch of lies. He would’ve stood his ground if Natasha hadn’t pulled out another knife from her sleeve and all-too casually begin to sharpen it. Steve's pretty sure she's messing with him but well, better safe than sorry.
When Tony steps inside the gallery with Jan on his arm, the first thing he sees is Natasha and Sharon in a corner, their arms linked together and their soft gazes and smiles never leaving each other.
Regardless, the gesture seems to bring a crimson blush to Steve’s plastic cheeks and Tony finds himself wishing that he could lean forward or have Steve lean down and—
“Only if you want to,” he says. “I know we’ve never talked about it and I know you don’t feel the same way—”
Of course. Why did he think that Tony would side with someone who isn’t his girlfriend? Steve may be one of his best friends, but Carol? Carol is more than that.
“Hey,” Tony cuts in softly, cupping Steve’s jaw. “I’m cool with it. I mean, now that I know that the feeling’s mutual and all. Still, you could’ve taken me out to dinner first before springing that on me out of the blue—”
Despite the press branding Tony as a shameless flirt and playboy, he is anything but. Sure, there might have been a couple of moments here and there. But they’re usually pretty tame, mostly sly winks directed at people, which Steve barely witnesses. Or at least, after Steve met Tony.
“I can imagine,” Tony murmurs, brushing several stray locks away from Steve’s eyelids. “We’re going to have to talk about this. A long talk.”
Well, he supposes he is giving the card to Tony. Just not in the way he would’ve liked. And that sucks so fucking much.
Tonight though, all he wants to do is trade it all in for the bombast of Black Sabbath blasting through his workshop speakers as he works in grease, the bustle during team dinners, or the comfortable silence he shares with Steve whenever they spend time together.
It’s a small one, tucked in a corner at a small gallery. A personal one by a Steve Rogers, about a love story for the ages that stood against time.
“Hey, that’s my AI you’re talking about here,” Tony says defensively. “Sides’, is this really that imp—”
Sometimes, it’s easy, like they’ve done this before. Then again in some way, they have. Even before the fake engagement, Steve and Tony have been inseparable. Steve would spend most of his time down in Tony’s workshop, talking about everything and nothing. They’d make time to visit galleries and museums, head to the cinema every week, have brunch, lunch, and dinner, and everything in between at every restaurant they could find.
“Have I forgot to mention that I’ve been in love with you for four hundred and ninety-nine years?” Steve opens his mouth but Tony cuts him off. “And before you ask, no, I don’t care what people think about us. People have been assuming for years, anyway.”
Steve stands between the doors, holding them back with his hands, his eyes clouded in concern and confusion. “Tony, what—”
Tony sighs, turning to Natasha in hopes she’d let him sneak away like old times. Just like Steve, she’s gone.
“Yeah,” Steve says, his lips tugging to the side. “The beard. I, uh… I— I mean, movie me. Movie me grew it out. Because of you.”
“Fine,” Steve blurts out without a thought. “I just— I’ll pay for it. Later. Yes! I just— I need to go.”
“Oh, Tony,” Steve says, hushed like it’s a secret meant for the both of them and the both of them alone. “I
Jan’s wonderful with Steve and Sharon. She smiles when she’s supposed to smile, laugh when she’s supposed to laugh, teases Tony at every chance she gets because she’s freaking Jan van Dyne.
“Don’t you worry that pretty head of yours,” Clint says, miming a zipping motion over his lips. “I didn’t tell a single soul.”
Tony’s body goes taut. He tightens his grip around the neck of the bottle he’s holding. He thinks it’s vodka, maybe rum. Tequila.
Tony wills the thought away. He’s not going down that path. Not at all. After all, they’re freaking toys. All of that doesn’t apply to them. It doesn’t explain Steve’s weird demeanor around Tony. But that’s Steve’s problem, not his.
“What New Year’s Eve part—” Tony’s eyes widen, the words finally registering in his head. “Oh fuck.”
Tony barely curbs the disappointment growing inside him. Of course. Why should he expect anything else? It’s stupid of him to even think that Cap would come for him on his own accord.
Tony's nursing a cup of lemonade, scanning the crowd and counting down the seconds until he can slip away when he feels a tap on his shoulder.
Their journey takes them to the very first place they met. Not as Captain America and Iron Man, but Steve Rogers and Tony Stark.
Tony can’t remember how long ago that was. Fifteen minutes? Twenty? He should’ve noticed that the room’s turned a little darker, no thanks to Steve’s hulking body blocking the corridor lights.
The grin Steve’s sporting begins to slide off his face as his eyes drift down to Tony’s lips, darkening with what Tony imagines is desire. Which doesn’t make any sense because well, it’s Steve. In what world would Steve want him? Desire him?
But then, he could just keep his eyes closed and stay in bed. He can’t remember the last time he got a decent day of sleep. To take that away from him is daylight robbery.
The show isn’t as bad as Tony thought it’ll be. Sure, the animation isn’t the best and the dialogue and humor are obviously aimed for kids. But Tony would be lying if he doesn’t find certain parts downright hilarious or not feel wistful at the dynamics the cartoon Avengers seem to share, especially—
But every time he steps outside, all he can see is Steve, in every single face, in every single place and he thinks,
“I didn’t believe him at first ‘cause you know, you’re you and I’m me and why would you look at me that way—”
In a flash, they’re scrambling to their feet, hastily grabbing onto each other. In the flurry of activity, somehow Tony ends up tripping over his own feet, knocking him and Steve back onto the ground.
“Um, thanks.” He clears his throat, fighting off the urge to bury his head in the nearest hole. “I guess. I think. Um—”
Tony and Hank haven’t always been at each other’s throats. Back when Hank was a part of the Avengers, Tony, Hank, and Bruce spent a lot of time bouncing ideas and talking science. But coupled with Hank’s dismissal from the Avengers and his insecurity over Jan’s close relationship with Tony, their friendship dissipated over time.
She nods, glancing between the two of them. “Well. I know when I’m not needed, Cap.” She presses her lips onto Tony’s cheek. “Raincheck?”
Tony ignores the smug and knowing looks his fellow toys send his way and he definitely ignores Steve’s burning stare.
As if by magic, some of the grogginess Tony feels dissipates. He cracks an eyelid open, meeting a pair of perfectly blue eyes and a perfectly cheery smile and a big dopey mug. It's a sight Tony never, ever wants to be greeted with this early in the night.
“And you said you have questions,” he murmurs in reverence as Steve tops his masterpiece with a perfect
“Not yet. There’s something—” Tony cuts himself off. “Hey, we should get some hot dogs. Bet you’re starving.”
A familiar pang surges through Tony's chest. The last thing he wants to do is break down over an old lover in front of Captain America. An old lover who happens to be a man.
Like sure, he likes Peter. Likes him a whole lot. In fact, he and Peter were bought together as a Christmas present for Miles. They have the strongest bond out of all the toys.
That didn't make sense either. Only a handful of people knows of his heart or how it works. None of them are Captain America.
“Besides, it doesn’t matter if Carol and I have a thing. Our engagement is a sham. You don’t get to play the jealous fiancé or—”
“Here,” she says, thrusting a slice of red velvet cake towards him and it’s not fair that she’s playing dirty. He could never say no to red velvet.
But then, Steve thinks about Tony’s warm smile and wonders if he’d even feel less lonely if his classmates actually like him.
Maybe Tony would decide to stay and live among the wonders of another planet. Maybe Tony decides that Sif and him would make a great match (Steve has his doubts) and gets engaged on the spot. Maybe Asgard and its people are no match for Earth and Steve.
The engagement ring is nothing glamorous – a titanium band with a gold inlay and a tiny ruby nestled in the middle. Steve even had it engraved with the words ‘
“Well, jury’s out on that.” Tony groans, slumping in his seat. “God, we should’ve told them it was all a misunderstanding.”
Tony takes a much-needed step back. “You two have fun,” he says before shooting them a half-hearted wink. “But not too much fun.”
It’s already bad enough she’s around. Now, she’s taking up all of Tony’s time. Tony who has stuck to her side ever since the party started, Tony who kissed Carol on the cheek (life is so unfair) and teased her about her cat, Tony who shoved slices of pineapple and ham pizza at her  even though Tony absolutely loathes pineapple on pizza but Steve loves it, and sure, Tony gave him the one with the most pineapple but—but—
“Well, they’re idiots. Whoever they are. Because you—” Tony's gaze softens. “You deserve a million gifts.”
“It’s never too soon to date,” Tony counters. “Sides’, Pepper and I broke up... What? Seven months ago? I think it’s high time I get back into things. Go out. Have some fun.”
At that, all the tension Steve has been radiating dissipates. He exhales, slumping further in his chair. “God. Fuck. Yes, please.”
One outing turns to two to three and then Tony could barely keep count because all the days somehow bleed together when he’s with Steve Rogers.
Tony comes home. Waits until midnight. Tiptoes over to Jarvis’ room. Begs him to give him a ride over to Steve’s. Climbs the fire escape to Steve’s room.
“They’re not as good as what you do, trust me.” Tony plucks a card from the basket, flipping it over and thrusting it towards Steve. “I mean, this is amazing. I don’t know how you managed to sell these.”
“You play all these instruments?” Steve asks with awe, a hand hovering over the neck of Tony’s electric guitar. “Even the harp?”
“Oh. I used to crash at Tony’s place back when you guys were broken up.” Carol shrugs. “It was really quiet then since you know, no Avengers.”
“Okay, I think he got the message,” Tony interrupts, tugging Steve by the sleeve and dragging him away. “See you later, Hammer. Toodles!”
An involuntary chuckle tumbles out of his lips as Steve shakes his head and turns away. He knows it’s a joke, meant to distract the both of them from their impending doom, but he couldn’t help but find the irony in it.
“We were together for three years,” Tony points out. “You and him, were like, what? A year? Maybe if you’ve had the time—”
“Jesus,” Sharon says when she finds him drunkenly drenching his canvas in shades of brown. “Bucky and Sam were right.”
“You love Barnes. And I know he means a lot to you. I couldn't just watch you lose the love of his life again. Not when you've just found him.”
Right now, he should be looking for Steve. Tony hasn’t seen Steve since he stormed off. It’s worrying.
“Tony,” Steve begins, beaming in a way Tony has never seen before and fuck Tony’s heart is shattering again, “this is Bucky. Bucky, Tony.”
Plus, Steve’s a master tactician. He has superstrength, superhearing, able to heal quickly. What can Johnny do besides bursting into flames? If Tony wants skywriting written in fire, Tony could just build a machine that could—
“Why the pseudonym?” Sharon asks on her first day as his agent. “Don’t want people knocking at your door?”
She’s proven wrong when they step into the living room and find Clint, the rest of the Avengers except Sam, who had headed back to his parents for the holidays, and Carol noisily chatting.
But that was before he knew of Carol. Carol who could’ve been wondering where her boyfriend is. Carol who Tony might’ve made plans with. Carol, who Tony is—
Tony chuckles, Steve following along. It’s one of the most melodic sounds Tony has the pleasure of hearing.
He could barely make out the whispers against his skin, the hand rubbing circles on his back, the hint of pine filling his nostrils.
But then the possibility of Tony giving the bakery a one-star review on Yelp crosses his mind. The last thing he needs is his mother directing that Disappointed™ Stare of hers at him for the rest of his life.
Steve’s eyelids flutter, his lips parting. He… He doesn’t know how to feel about that. One thing’s for sure is that he’s definitely going to have words with her later. A lot of words.
Dashing is a total understatement. Steve can’t even find the words to describe Tony. With his hair slicked back and dressed in a two-piece, he can’t remember the last time he’s seen Tony this put-together. Then again, Tony always looks put-together, always looks like he’s dressed to kill. Impress.
Steve rolls his eyes, chasing after Tony’s fingers again. This time, the glove parts, revealing a weathered hand. It’s warm.
A flicker of hope ignites in Steve’s heart. He ignores it for the moment. The less he indulges in them, the better so he just closes his eyes again and lets Natasha work her magic on him.
Now that she’s facing him, the stranger’s features strike a chord in him but not strong enough to help put a name to her face. Maybe he’s seen her in pictures or the paper. Maybe he’s passed her by on the street or a coffee shop or even at the bar a couple blocks away.
Steve felt his cheeks burning, embarrassment getting the better of him like it always does. “I know it sounds stupid…”
Tony could easily imagine standing next to him, drinking in Steve’s laugh. It’d be clear and sweet, the most melodious thing he’s ever heard.
Tony sighs, sinking back under the covers, sinking back under his self-loathing and misery. “You and me both.”
And if he calls on JARVIS to help him strategize ways to beat Carol the next time, no one has to know that either.
Tony snorts at the rhetorical question. “Please. Everyone knows you’re a sassy troll behind those all-American blue eyes.”
Steve doesn’t know how long he stands there, only snapping out of his reverie when Clint calls for his attention.
“The engagement. It’s fake. We’re not— We just found a ring on the sidewalk. Steve had the stupid idea to propose to me. As a joke. But then people saw us and started recording the whole thing and we— I—” He sighs. “It’s fake, okay?”
Tonight, he is Tony Stark – billionaire and philanthropist. And he has people to schmooze for the good of charity. Tonight’s not about him.
Steve rolls his eyes, clasping his hands together. “Well now that’s all cleared up, how about taking your helmet off? I’m dying to know how your lips feel.”
Ever since Tony pulled him out of the ice, Steve’s been in love with him. It wasn’t difficult to. Tony’s the first person who truly made him feel welcomed in the future, who sheltered him from SHIELD for as long as he could, who gave him a home. Tony, who is smart and funny and kind and everything Steve loves.
Tony rolls his eyes, snatching it from Steve's grasp. “More like my breathing. You do know that’s creepy, right?”
“Uh yeah. But it’s not exactly…” Tony pauses, rubbing the back of his neck. “You’re free tomorrow, right?”
Natasha scoffs. “I don’t believe you. The Steve I know is too stubborn for his own good. The Steve I know has been pining over Tony Stark since you guys met but never made a move because he’s an idiot. The Steve I know thinks that this proposal is the only chance you might have with Tony—”
“I see,” Thor says, his gaze darting between the both of them. “I suppose I could leave you both here to indulge—”
“Sure you do, birdbrain. But yeah. You guys are fun and all but it’ll be nice to go out and have a nice time in a less platonic setting, you know? Have some little flirting going on—”
“I was supposed to be on candy buying duty.” Tony plucks the lights from Steve’s grasp as he nods to the boots he has on. “Since Peter, Ororo, and Jan aren't around, I thought I’d take these out for a spin.”
That’s when Steve realizes – Tony’s tapping his finger on his arc reactor, a tic he does when he’s nervous.
“Enough, Kamala,” the teacher stresses before turning her sharp scowl towards Party Pooper. “James, it’s not nice to interrupt your friends when they’re talking. What do we say when you’ve made a mistake?”
Tony groans. He’s never going on a mission with those two ever again. He’s also never going to blurt out his plans during battle ever again.
“Neither did you,” Steve counters. “I mean, that is. if you even like me. I don’t want you to marry me because you don’t—”
Steve’s smile remains as tender as it was before, his posture remaining firm. Tony almost stutters to a stop.
“Well,” Steve begins, raising his bottle of lemonade in the air, “here’s to five hundred years of friendship.”
In that short exchange, there’s a lot of things to process. For one, how could Carol vaporize him? Tony actually talked about introducing Carol to Steve? He thought Steve would—
Instead, he clears his throat, doing his best to keep himself together. “Thank you. You don’t look too shabby yourself.”
In the midst of the chaos, Steve randomly pops up, offering to help catch Rhodey for Tony. Ignoring some knowing looks from the other toys, Tony immediately accepts the offer because he could never say no to free help when it comes to catching his dumb best friend.
Tony’s splashed on the news again. This time, he’s caught stumbling home with a man and a woman with the biggest grin Steve’s ever seen. He looks downright miserable.
“If you say that the way they’re acting confirms they’re together, I will steal that ring and propose to him myself.”
Steve’s standing on the other end of the room, throwing his head back in laughter as he converses with Dugan. His shirt sleeves are now pushed up his elbows, showing off his toned arms.
He scowls. He loves Natasha. He really does. But he hates how she could see right through him sometimes, hates how they're more alike than he’d like.
“Wait,” Bruce says during breakfast. Tony had been whisked away to a shareholder meeting, leaving the other five alone. “Aren’t you two married?”
The tinkle of piano keys and his mother’s crooning still lingers in Tony’s mind as he shuffles out of his room and into the elevator.
Steve reaches for his hand towel, dabbing the sweat trickling down his head and cheeks. “Uh, JARVIS? Who—”
“Well, what about you, huh?” Tony shoots back. “You had to know I’ve been drooling over you for four hundred and ninety-nine years!”
A combination of disappointment and relief floods through Steve. At least he knows now Steve isn’t Tony’s type.
Tony’s lashes flutter, his lips curling in a genuine smile. Steve has never seen anyone this pretty in his life.
“Not that. Although that has cropped up pretty often. I mean, us. Having an anniversary for our friendship. Like, who does that?”
If only he could bury his nose in Tony’s damp hair, take in the fresh scent of apples, or trail his fingers down the nape of Tony’s—
Tony does, shy and guarded and nervous. Steve readies himself. He’s waited years for this moment. He needs Tony to know before they lose their breath, before he has to watch Tony die.
“Until I met you,” he continues, “and you blew my world wide open, baby. All of a sudden, waking up was exciting because most days meant seeing you. You gave me a building to live in and a friend. For so long, I was content, even when I wanted more of your kindness and your dry humor, and your ridiculous bots. I wanted more of your children’s laughter and Saturday night dinners. I wanted everything from you, but couldn’t understand how the bland shell of a person I was might be someone you loved. And then you came to me and you filled me with light and love. I will never forget that, Tony. How you breathed life back into me and how we both understand where we stand in each other’s lives. So yeah, I agree to have you. In return for your love and your faithfulness, I promise security. I promise to apologize when I’m in the wrong and to remind you of your worth, every day until I’m gone. I promise that I’m not gonna get it wrong, but baby...I’m going to give it my all because you deserve that. If you let me, you’ll get it.”
“Maggie, sweetheart, you’re okay,” he says, holding her tight. “What happened? You’ve never used the emergency signal before—”
“That’s not what we’re saying,” Steve says immediately. “Like your Dad said, you’re trying to do the right thing here. I believe in doing the right thing.”
“I gotta find him,” Harley says. His jaw is set. Usually, Maggie’s heart falls when she sees that because it means he’s going to be obsessed with whatever he’s decided to do until he’s finished doing it, and she’ll be treated as an annoyance the entire time, but right now she’s glad. She hadn’t noticed at first, but now that she thinks about it, she’s pretty sure the clothes Mystery Kid Peter was wearing were all too big or too small, and he had on hoodie but no coat, and she can’t get out of her head the way his face changed when Harley mentioned pizza.
She huffs, all thoughts of sleep abandoned, and gets out of bed. Carefully, Maggie sneaks down the hall, taps her secret knock on Harley’s door and tries the handle. It’s not locked, so she lets herself in.
(Figures Maggie would attract a literal superhero for backup. She’s got every single Avenger wrapped around her little finger already. Might as well start collecting New York City’s various Vigilantes of Questionable Motive and Character, too.)
“Double names, really?” Harley rolls his eyes. “And no, I did not hack the security feed. But Peter told me where he’s living when we were playing basketball the other day. His foster parents are shit and he would rather live anywhere else than with them. They don’t care as long as they get a check.”
“Hey, no problem,” he says. “Did any of your art survive? Gosh, I shoulda been faster. I only caught a glimpse, but what I saw was
In an instant, she’s free. Her attacker drops Maggie in favor of doubling over in pain . Part of her feels guilty, but he deserved it. He
“Keep moving, lady,” one of the boys says. Maggie uses the distraction to kick the bully holding her right in the crotch, just like Harley taught her.
In the MedBay, the three of them lay eyes on Steve Rogers: the love of Tony’s life, literal blood on his hands (soaking half his shirt and smeared in fingerprints on his sleeves) striding up as the elevator door opens, already apologizing.
“...Pizza?” For a moment Peter looks like he’s going to change his mind. He sounds hungry. Actually, now that Maggie’s calmed down and really looking, he looks hungry. More than it’s-been-a-long-time-since-lunch hungry.
They’re looking at the people who came before them and saying “you fucked up our world, and we’re going to do our best to fix it.”
“Hey, hey,” Tony says, Maggie’s devastation mixing dangerously with his own worst fears. He shepherds everyone into the living room, hopes the way he collapses on the couch doesn’t give away the despair he’s trying so hard not to feel. “‘Course he didn’t say no. Why would he say no? I just didn’t get the chance to ask.”
Maggie's double-handful of dirty snow soups him right in the face. While his mouth is wide open. He spits swears and street-shit and throws her portfolio to the ground, now reaching for Maggie instead.
With a silent groan as not to reveal his hiding spot, Peter turns and looks at the ceiling. Why in God's name does the cleaning staff have to be so happy all the time? Like, okay, yes they have to be there and make sure everything is set for the school day and their job is hard. They should be able to use their workspace however the hell they want when they think they're alone.
“Not if he doesn’t trust us, sure,” Harley says. He has thought about this, and repeatedly told himself that it can’t be the real issue here. “But come on. Iron Man and Captain America swoop in to save you, you get saved and you’re happy about it. Every kid at least
“Yeah, yeah, sorry—but Steve, we were going to take him to eat—he looked like he needed it, honestly—I assumed he was a pickpocket the moment I saw him, he looked like he might be desperate enough—”
“That’s war, Pete,” Steve says firmly. “You make the decision that will ultimately save lives. It sucks, but our world is one where war exists and people die. Japanese forces were not going to stop unless they were stopped, so we had to make a decision.”
“Yes,” Steve says. “He—he’s going to make it though. He has to make it—he’d lost a lot of blood before I even got to him—”
“The most important one survived,” she says, offering as much of a smile as she can. “...wanna see?”
“My uncle,” Peter tells him quietly. Where he’s been tapping a pencil to the table, he stops and looks Steve right in the eye. “Before he died, he had quite a lot to say about what people do with the power we have.”
Maggie steels herself and reaches into the pocket of her bridesmaid dress. Out of it, she pulls a piece of paper neatly folded and hands it to Peter. Steve sets a hand on her shoulder while they watch him unfold it. He gasps a little as he traces fingers over her art.
Everything is beautiful. It's a March wedding in upstate New York with purples and greens all around. Maggie wears a lavender dress and strolls down the aisle with a big bouquet between Harley (Tony's best man) and Peter (Steve's best man). The vows are said without microphones, heard only by the priest and the family that is closest to the front. This moment isn’t going to be heard by the hundreds of people looking on—only by those who love Tony and Steve the most.
“I trust you completely, love.” Tony’s voice is firm but gentle, like he really wants Steve to understand. “And if it's your way, it's our way.”
It’s just that Tony has been planning this date for weeks. Months. Actually he was planning this date before he even dared dream of asking Cap on a date. It was less planning and more fantasizing at that point, but the ideas born in that fantasy were good ones.
“Enchanted to meet you, Maggie,” her rescuer says. He starts to say his name, but at the same time Maggie’s own name is shouted. The exclamation echoes, loud and panicked, from the end of the block.
“You already answered it.” The way Steve’s looking at him, you’d think Tony engineered the sun itself. Which is silly, because Steve
Maggie drags Peter towards the taco bar and thrusts a plate in his arms. She's talking a mile a minute about her art and about her brother's genius, and how her mother got remarried and moved to California, so her father swooped in and asked for custody. They were together for Christmas and everyone got along really well, but she is honest enough to admit that she loves living with her father. Well, not her father by blood, but her father in all the ways that count. Harley's the one actually related to Tony, but he's been the one who took care of her for her entire life.
