A silence stretches between them for a minute or two, so comfortable Tony is reluctant to break it but there’s something he wants to say.
The twenty-first century has much to offer, so many things in fact that it would be impossible to mention them all. From technological to social advancements, passing through cultural and artistic developments. Clothes and architecture. History and science. The Earth is a world of endless wonders and the best part of it all is how so many of them are yet to come.
“You’re the one in charge here, Tony,” Steve tells him.
Devastated.
Tony hears Steve sigh, a sound so small he might have confused it with the rustling of leaves if not for how attuned he is to Steve and his being.
And it is the truth, it isn’t about him. Maybe it is another item in the long list of things Steve and Tony need to discuss and come to terms with, but right now it’s not what the conversation should be about. This conversation is all about Steve, because Steve deserves conversations to be about him and his feelings and his experiences.
Therapy twice a week on his own is already hard enough, raw in ways he’s not sure he’d be able to explain. It drains him of energy while at the same time filling him up with hope. It kills him over and over again, only to bring him back to life. Sharing all that with a group of strangers that have their own crosses to bear… It sounds terrifying.
Everything is far from solved for Steve but perhaps he’s been looking for answers in all the wrong places.
“What?” Tony asks as Steve opens his eyes again and meets Tony’s gaze.
God, even his voice was beautiful. Steve wished the Earth would swallow him down. Now. Please.
“He did,” Pepper agrees. “But our world still needs heroes, now more than ever. And he would have loved to help, I just know it. So I’ll do it for him, in any way I can.”
They’re sad tears and happy tears and Tony’s mouth actually curls up in a soft smile despite it all. It must be mirror neurons or something because seeing Peter’s happy face in the photo compels him to smile back at the image.
How many more of these days will they have to live through? How many more times will they need to be painfully reminded of what they lost?
“You know we haven’t met him before either, right?” Bucky asked while pointing at himself and Sam.
“How does life go on without them? How do we help the people that are still here to create a new future?” Tony pauses and he takes a breathe.
His steps take him to Steve’s room first where he encounters a closed door.
Steve is the first one to move but he doesn't completely separate from Tony. His hand stays clasped in Tony’s and his free one moves to Tony’s knee, resting there unobtrusively. His eyes are closed and his brow is set in a deep frown like he’s deep in thought or concentrating on something.
His hesitation is so palpable it can almost be seen as a physical manifestation taking up the whole bedroom but Tony can’t put his finger on why the reason for it is. Is the reluctance due to fear? Is it an awkwardness born from Tony’s gesture?
_______________________________
There had been times Tony had had to remind himself to pay closer attention because although Peter’s lips were moving Tony wasn’t listening to any of his words and, even in dreams, Tony knew what a privilege it was to still be able to hear Peter’s voice.
He makes the decision in a split second and he doesn’t take even a millisecond to think if it’s a good idea or not.
Tony doesn’t move his body but he does move his head, turning it towards the place where Steve’s hand still rests on his shoulder.
He needed time, he needed to be able to look at his armor and see the salvation it has granted him so many times before and not just the failure it had started to represent.
He’s learnt not to blame himself for the part of him that to this day, so many years later, still sometimes clings to parts of the past, embellishing them, probably remembering them in a much more golden and optimistic light than what they truly were.
Slowly, Tony opens his eyes and, for a second, everything is so bright it hurts to look at. His hand comes up instinctively to cover up his eyes and protect them but Tony still feels groggy and, above all, confused.
Tony opens his mouth widely and brings his left heart to his chest to place it over his heart. “You think I would betray you?”
And then, as if the universe feels like it owes him something, he feels a pair of familiar arms wrap around his waist and a chest press into his back, seeping warmth into his skin.
“Me too,” Tony agrees, confirming that where they’re concerned a single word is enough and Steve can feel it’s honesty.
“I am graciously letting you pick once again, Steve.”
He can’t help but look over his shoulder as he’s making his way to the elevator to check just one last time that Tony is still there, in the flesh.
“And the way you fell for me? That’s not a problem, either. I’m honored, actually, that you saw in me someone worthy enough of your affection even when you thought I was already gone. It’s a little unconventional, not gonna lie, but our whole life is unconventional, Steve. What’s one more thing to add to the list?”
“Lyla loved this movie.”
“I made a move, if you want to call it that, and he said no. He said it was behind us and it would be better for us both to leave it in the past.”
“You’re a fucking pain in the ass,” Steve declares as he takes a pillow and throws it at Tony, who easily dodges it.
Midnight normally finds him laying in bed but sleep rarely finds him easily these days.
“Oh,” Steve murmurs, prolonging the vowel sound. “Those are the worst.”
“We should all have just been better at talking to each other,” she summarizes.
He looks up when he hears soft footsteps approaching him in the stillness of his surroundings and he has to squint his eyes slightly to make out Bruces’s shape coming towards him.
For the first time since they all got settled into the conference room, Tony’s gaze fixes solely on Steve. He’s leaning against a table, his arms crossed and his legs too, a defensive pose if Tony’s ever seen one. But there are no enemies for him in this room, only allies. Or at least, there are no enemies for him in the room at this moment.
Tony goes through three different psychologists before finding the one who works best for him, a young woman that only just recently graduated and is working two different jobs, one in a private clinic and one in a non-profit organization for people who lost loved ones in the Decimation. Steve’s search is more straight-forward and he starts seeing a therapist that Sam used to know and sometimes worked with.
Natasha’s gaze softens, in fact her whole face does. She visibly swallows and licks her lips a couple of times, as if trying to gain a little time to find the correct words.
“No leftovers, I guess,” Steve declares as one of his hands gestures towards the empty boxes.
For every grand moment Tony and Pepper have together they get a heartbreaking one in return.
Tony feels dread fill up his body to the brim because no, Steve wasn’t just leaving but Tony’s last idiotic comment has made him want to.
Steve extends his arm and points to Tony’s bed.
Tony smiles and this time, he’s the one taking action and placing his pale hand on top of her blue one, grasping it gently for a few second until he feels her grabbing it back.
After sniffing and shaking his head as if to try to clear his mind, Steve says “You’re awake.”
The thing is, once a thought enters Tony’s mind, it rarely leaves it without being explored over and over again. His thoughts tend to get demolished, restructured and completely renewed. Tony’s mind is in constant search for new ideas and possibilities so anything he can use as a study subject is good for him,
Steve and Tony are standing on opposites ends of the table, maybe three feet of distance between them but it feels like they’re standing closer than ever and yet a thousand miles apart.
It’s the second utterance of his name that makes him finally move his eyes away from the nothingness above him and fix his gaze on her.
He leaves it as it is, maybe because he wants the storm in his heart to match the sort of storm the downpour creates in the shower.
_______________________________
“You know I…,” Steve clears his throat. “I’ve also been thinking lately that I could use some help. I’m pretty sure at this point everyone could use some professional help. Hell, the professionals might need some professional help themselves.”
“Sap,” Tony says, not really knowing if he’s talking about Rhodey or about himself.
“Like a divorce, yes,” Tony confirms. “God knows we’ve never been married but we did fight like we were in the middle of a nasty separation at the Hellicarier all those months ago, if I remember correctly.”
Thor’s voice is, unsurprisingly, the loudest. It echoes through the whole living room and startles Tony the most. The rest of the voices mix and blend together, more harmonious than strident.
He knows he won’t die and yet he thinks he will. He knows it’s not real and yet there’s never been anything more real than this.
“When did you learn?” Steve asks.
“So that was good, huh?” Tony asks, and Steve can hear the smugness in his voice. However, he can also pick up the waver in it, signaling Tony’s trepidation.
“What do you mean?” Tony inquires.
The Avengers have to tread more lightly than ever and Tony hopes Steve hasn't forgotten about that.
A soft silence follows this interaction but they’re both still looking at each other, both still sporting sad smiles on their faces.
The TV serves as background white noise for him to fall asleep after he finishes eating. He doesn’t even move to put his dish and cutlery away to the kitchen, just leaves them on the coffee table to clean up later.
I hope you all enjoy this chapter!
“Good,” Tony says. I think this means we can go back to the kissing, right?”
“I’m so happy that you’re back, Tony.”
“I figured.” Tony shrugs. “But that’s what they do. Hardcore worriers, the pair of them.”
Years ago there would have been extensive and excessive coverage with news like that by the Avengers. There would have been channels praising them and glorifying their every action while other media outlets would have painted them as the true villains of the story.
No matter how many times Tony goes through the conversation in his mind he still can’t quite grasp how so little was said and yet so much was understood. They never really said the words and they never really talked about it but Tony doesn’t feel like they could have or should have done more.
Tony watches as Natasha stands up from her seat to join Clint on the opposite sofa. She curls up next to him, her head on his shoulder and her hand on top of one of his. Clint slowly but surely curls back into her, resting his head on top of hers. When the screen brightens up their faces Tony can see the silent tears that are rolling down their cheeks.
No, the fight didn’t do this. Thanos did.
“Tony…” Steve says back, his face slowly but surely lighting up in understanding.
Tony spends the entire day in bed after that, covers over his head, not even crying, just feeling empty.
It had been a sweet and fun picture with Peter and Tony holding the trophy upside down, big smiles on both their faces and a look of utter pride coloring Tony’s expression.
The conversation halts then. Steve is looking away from Tony, his gaze fixed on the white floor tiles. Tony gives him time, seeing clearly that he is deep in thought.
Tony turns and tilts his head so he can meet Steve’s eyes as he talks.
“Hi, Nat,” Rhodey greets. “How’s it going?”
_______________________________
Pepper calls him the day Bruce tells him he will be able to move around freely again and tells him she believes it’s a good idea that he stays in the Compound.
“Miss Potts. Pepper,” he corrects himself. “I don’t know how much there is of the team, of the Avengers. Barton and Romanoff work for SHIELD as I do but we don’t really work together. Thor’s off world as far as I know and Banner… I think he’s gone back to India. Or to some other place far away from here. It’s not like he told me.”
But when Tony thinks about the dream there comes a time, normally after a couple of minutes reveling on the images of it, when the thought that these are now the only moments he gets to spend with Peter strikes him and punches all the air from his lungs.
He sits down on the chair next to Tony’s and opens the ice-cream carton, ripping the protective plastic seal. “You don’t have to eat everything, anyway. I just brought you some options.”
_______________________________
“I could have lost you, without even a goodbye.”
“Of the fantasy,” Steve completes her thought.
about your bad day, Tony,” Steve says, clenching his fists. “Which you haven’t even told me about, by the way. I just think after the day we’ve had it’s better this way.”
Before Tony even realizes it’s happening, Steve spins them both over on the bed so Tony is lying beneath him. Steve doesn’t lie down on Tony, instead opting to stay on his knees so he can pull off his t-shirt and throw it away to the side.
It’s something Steve once mentioned in passing in a conversation about what happened during those days when they had to fight Thanos separately.
“Hey,” Bruce says, and a light breeze gently ruffles the white, loose shirt he’s wearing.
This morning, the rest of the team are already there and they all offer their greetings when Tony joins them.
“Please make sure she's okay today,” he practically begs and then runs off, leaving Steve and Tony looking at each other, confused and anxious.
A lone tear escapes from the corner of her left eye and although she quickly wipes it away with her ring finger Steve catches the short path it walks. Pepper presses her lips together until they turn white and she rests the tips of her fingers on them, like trying to control a sound she doesn't want to escape her mouth. Maybe it’s a sob, Steve thinks as more tears start gathering in her eyes.
something you will have to do alone,” Tony jokes, trying to hide his abashment at the comment.
“Tony,” Pepper breathes, and the pressure to his left eases, most likely due to Pepper raising her head.
A small folded piece of paper is presented to Natasha, Bruce and Tony and before the two men can even make a move towards it Natasha practically rips it from Steve’s fingers.
_______________________________
There are a few new Stark Industries’ things Tony can tell him back but most of the conversation on his part has to do with interpersonal Avengers’  business. Thor, Clint. Natasha and Bruce. Rhodey wants to hear it all and his insights are helpful for more than one thing.
“You’re welcome.”
Steve rolls his eyes fondly and, if Tony were here, he would scoff out-loud at Tony’s ridiculousness.
When he opens his eyes the blue of them seems almost multiplied, like all the tears he cried cleaned away a layer of dust that had been accumulating there for months.
Sure enough, when Tony looks to the side towards the less cluttered part of his workshop he can spot one of the sticks burning away slowly and only emitting a very faint trail of smoke. Steve is always very adamant about not placing the incense anywhere near what he considers to be dangerous surroundings even though Tony has told him a million times that the chances of there ever being a fire in his workshop are slim to none.
_______________________________
“Yeah, well, that makes one of us.”
Rhodey stands from his position at the workshop table where Tony and him had just been playing around with a couple personal and idle projects. He walks over to Natasha and opens his arms to pull her into a hug.
There’s been something plaguing him for weeks now, something he’s grown more and more desperate to do. It’s consumed his every waking moment and he’s embarrassed to admit that it’s even made it into his dreams once or twice during the past month. It had been something he had thought of before but in the past few weeks it’s grown so unavoidable that he wonders how it’s possible that Steve hasn't picked up on it before.
He absentmindedly keeps repeating the motion as he gets dressed in comfortable clothes and only stops when FRIDAY’s voice startles him and pulls him out of his head.
Tony helps Steve and Steve helps Tony, but in order to be able to do this they both need to be able to help themselves.
“No,” Tony says.
Natasha steps into the elevator, Tony following her, and tells JARVIS to take them to Tony’s and Steve’s floor before turning to the man and with a hand resting near her heart she innocently says, “I’m not implying anything at all. I totally believe that Steve
They settled on one of Disney’s newer releases because even though no one would have ever predicted Captain America and Iron Man would ever pick that one, it seemed like the safest choice at the time.
“Happy birthday, Tony,” Steve whispers.
Tony’s mind fogs up immediately once again.
Here Tony has spoken about Peter more than he’s done so anywhere else, here Steve has told Tony stories about his mother and his sickly youth, and although he hasn’t yet opened up about recent events -losing Sam and Bucky, his thoughts on a possible reversal of the snap and other such topics- Tony feels like they’ve made some leeway during their heart-to-hearts. Steve is now more prone to share anecdotes from his time away from the States after the Accords and every time he shares something with Tony it feels more impactful and closer to being what he really needs to be talking about.
The clockwise motions of his tongue on Tony’s rim make him gasp so Steve keeps at them for a while. Steve’s tongue breaching Tony’s hole makes him swear loudly, so Steve pulls it away only to bring it back in millimeter by millimeter. The addition of one finger as Steve keeps licking at Tony’s hole makes Tony groan so Steve tries his luck with two after adding more saliva to his rimjob.
Pepper arrives at Avengers Compound really late at night on a Saturday, almost at 5AM in the morning, an emergency meeting having postponed her leaving Malibu by almost three hours.
Because of these thoughts and the anguish they leave him with, Tony has not been participating into the conversations going on around him during this meal. If asked he wouldn't be able to name any of the topics Steve, Natasha and Bruce have been discussing for the past half hour at the table, but he knows his friends don’t fault him for it. They’re familiar with each other’s moods by now and they’re pros at giving each other the things they need, like space in his case now.
Tony’s mind goes through every article, every interview, every comment he read.
Steve moves unexpectedly but he doesn’t go very far. He just turns on his back and laces his hand on his stomach as his eyes settle on the ceiling. The intensity of his gaze would have anyone thinking the secrets of the universe reside in the white cement above him.
The flicker of hope has turned into a supernova and Steve feels ready to explode and be reborn.
Distinguishing between dreams and nightmares is very hard these days for Tony.
On the days where his frustration gets him and he feels ready to explode after an entire day of no  fruitful results on his work with Bruce, he searches for Steve. Sometimes they sit in silence and sometimes Tony will talk until his voice goes rough and his mouth feels parched.
“Yeah, should have known you’d be against me in this too,” Steve comments just as Tony positions himself right in front of him, standing across the table where Steve’s seated.
Tony hesitates, Steve’s desperation compelling him to accept but not sure that would be the right move.
Steve huffs and his expression turns into a bitter smirk.
“And yet he’s still not here,” Tony quips.
“This isn’t about me,” Tony says.
“Tony?”
Rhodey arrived yesterday afternoon to spend the weekend in the Compound and, as he promised, he’s not there for work. He’s there to simply be with Tony, to share time together like that haven’t been able to do in a long time.
“Do you want me to?” Steve asks very seriously and the question paralyzes Tony.
“Tony, you’ve survived a lot worse than that. You don’t give yourself enough credit,” Rhodey says, his voice full of conviction and pride.
“Can you…” Steve starts asking but he interrupts himself to instead start positioning Tony how he wants him.
Steve hadn’t been too eager about it, as he was never too eager about dating in general, but Natasha had only told him, “You’ll thank me when you meet him.”
“It is,” Natasha replies, sounding convinced. “He and I both know it.”
Rhodey snorts and Pepper lets out a giggle at this.
It’s Tony creating playlists for him for different moods and situations: a playlist for the gym, a playlist for when he showers, a playlist for when he’s feeling nostalgic, a playlist that only includes songs with a color in the title because Steve bet Tony he wouldn't be able to find twenty different songs for twenty different colors -Steve loses the bet-.
“They kind of are like kids,” Steve reiterates and is rewarded by Tony’s face subtly lighting up as the right corner of his lips curls upwards.
Still coughing lightly Tony makes a vague gesture and hold his hand out waiting for Steve to hand him the bottle.
“Thanks, I try.”
“He wants you to turn into the Angry Guy” she explains. “I told him about it.”
As he opens the bedroom’s door something inside him stills and quiets even though he’s only a few feet away from the start of his walk. The sight of the Compound’s halls has now different meanings and associations and it succeeds at calming the desperate part of him that feels helpless in his own room.
Once, both Natasha and Bruce had joined them in the living room for a marathon of the
It reminds Tony of Rhodey’s own belief that he and Steve would be okay. It sends a shot of hope through his heart and Tony’s throat clogs up. There are still a thousand voices -Rhodey and Natasha and so many other; even his own too- and a thousand doubts and a thousand feelings.
“What?” Pepper asks, frowning.
“Tony would have loved to introduce you to all these 21st century things,” Pepper says. “The big ones and the small ones.”
The images fade away as soon as Steve pronounces the sentence and he turns around to face Pepper and Rhodey again. Their hands are joined over the table as if they're both taking strength from the other and their faces both show tear tracks.
She speaks fondly about the trip to Paris they took for the Valentine’s day they were dating.
He once had a thought -a dream, perhaps- that this place, the Compound, could be something grander than any one had ever seen before, and maybe, after Ultron, even if he hadn’t personally been there to see it, it had been for a few months.
Denial stopped being possible for Tony months ago, but it was easily replaced by doubt. Doubt when Steve’s near him and his heart wants to escape out of his chest. Doubt when he has a bad day and he wants to tell Steve to never touch him again. Doubt when he goes long without seeing Steve and he misses him, a feeling so strong that longing isn’t enough to describe it.
Steve’s face is full of pain, a pain so raw it seeps into Tony’s insides.
Tony keeps pulling on Steve’s arm and guiding them further away from Natasha’s room. Without having consciously decided to do so, Tony finds that he has moved them towards his own room, and they’re now standing in front of his ajar bedroom door. Steve seems to realize this fact at the same time that Tony does and he makes a shrugging motion with his shoulders that dislodges his arm from Tony’s grip. Tony takes a step backwards, putting some distance between his body and Steve’s as soon as he notices Steve’s deliberate move.
“I’ll just be going and letting you go too,” Tony says as he moves from in front of Steve, clearing his path.
Steve has to press the right button again to illuminate the screen when it turns off so he can continue to stare at the picture.
It’s barely a whisper, nothing more than a puff of air leaving Steve’s lips. “Tony.”
Pepper’s been calling him and Rhodey has texted him more than once to ask him for a spar or a drink but Steve’s has made terrible excuses to both, excuses he knows neither of them believe.
If anyone was watching this from the outside they might have mistaken them for a team, but nothing could be further from the truth. They’re all standing next to each other but they’re not together at all.
He can admit it: he needed Steve.
But if there’s one thing that Steve would place above all others is the opportunity to capture so easily and so perfectly every moment of it. Photographs are Steve’s favorite thing in the entire universe. Selfies, to be more precise.
Clint murmured “That’s my girl” and Natasha smirked at him. Steve still only had eyes for the man he had hit.
Tony had completely forgotten she was here for a minute and although a lot of Natasha’s whole being resides on making herself invisible and unassuming whenever she desires to be it makes Tony feel unsettled even to this day. Especially because this time he doesn't think it had been her choosing to blend into the background. Tony had simply been completely enraptured in Steve and oblivious to the rest.
_______________________________
The first mistake, and probably the biggest one, was thinking he didn't really know Tony when he did, even if the version of Tony he got to know was incomplete. He got to know Tony through his friends, his creations, recordings, interviews, photos and the mark he had left behind in the world. And that is not all that Tony Stark is but the things Steve learnt were real.
Steve and Tony walk to Steve’s room relaxedly and in silence. They’re not in any rush and they're both feeling each and every minute of their day so their steps are short and drowsy.
“Oh my god,” Clint tried to say through his laughter. “oh my god, man. That was incredible!”
“I don’t think there is a way we can reverse the snap,” Steve echoes Tony’s words from yesterday.
Is Steve’s sadness just naturally more consuming than his happiness or has he actually not known happiness around Tony ever?
“How?” Steve asks, despair and desperation leaking from his voice.
Steve’s birthday goes by without much fanfare, only Natasha, Bruce, Tony and the birthday boy himself celebrating it together by having a fancier than usual lunch at the Compound. Steve had decided weeks before that he didn't want to do anything special and he had booked an appointment with his therapist for the evening, anticipating the heaviness and weariness of the day.
With Steve it’s home and safety and comfort, as well.
“It’s not that I don’t think you can do this, it’s that you shouldn’t have to. Let someone else shoulder the responsibility for once,” has been Tony’s response time and time again.
_______________________________
The funniest thing about the entire situation is how clueless Steve has remained throughout it all.
He wants to laugh but he can’t. He’s trying to breathe but he can’t, he can’t.
Steve’s words confuse Tony, who frowns. “What?”
“I don’t think so,” Steve denies, shaking his head a little bit and moving Tony’s hand with it.
Tony breaks away from Rhodey’s gaze and turns back to look at Natasha.
He’s about to correct her but she holds up one of her hands.
Only one year.
“He’s not doing well,” Bruce announces and although they knew about it having the confirmation from Bruce feels like a dagger to the chest.
“What…?” Tony asks, not yet capable of uttering an entire sentence.
“How are-“ Pepper hesitates. “How are you feeling?”
He’s dying, he’s dying, he’s dying.
Steve gets to his feet promptly, startling Dummy who was standing close to him and making him roll back a few feet so Steve doesn't knock into him with the momentum of his movement.
“Rhodey found him,” Natasha announces, still out of breath. “He found Clint and I’m going to go get him.”
“Yeah, you’re a regular Neruda,” he teases.
Pepper nods. “I do. But there’s something different between you. You've been spending a lot of time together, right?”
His body would have definitely not withstood the toll of the Iron Man suit.
Tony opens his mouth to talk but he finds himself at a loss for words. There are so many things he wants to say to reassure Steve but they all taste hollow and insignificant in the face of Steve’s disclosure.
The few group sessions they’ve attended together have been centered around discussions of grief and acceptance, Tony having noticed in each one of them the careful maneuvering around any ideas of reestablishing the past but also of moving on towards the future. It’s like most of the people were trying to live while suspended in an ambiguous limbo of time. Not quite the past and not quite the future.
Pepper hugs both Natasha and Steve, and Steve timidly whispers an “I hope to see you soon” as Pepper is pulling away from his embrace. She places a delicate hand on his cheek and simply answers, “Of course”.
Steve sighs.
Steve nods and Tony places his hands on Steve’s shoulders, gently guiding him backwards towards the couch so Steve can sit down.
Stark sent that nuke up into the portal but he’s not coming down and Steve knows they need to close it as soon as possible.
Now it’s Tony’s turn to look at Steve defiantly and with one of his eyebrows raised. “You don’t need to rub it in, you know?”
Tony’s hand stills but he keeps it resting on Steve’s stomach, unmoving, almost weightless and yet completely impossible to ignore.
JARVIS’ voice startles them both, making Tony jump slightly in place and Steve thinks,
For the entirety of the conversation Bruce, Steve and Tony have let Natasha be the only one to do the talking, because she’s the one with the most information and hence is the best prepared one and also because Clint’s is hers in a way he isn’t anyone else’s of the men present.
“Steve,” Tony begs, not sure what he is begging for.
“You never honor our Monopoly deals!” Rhodey shouts as he he throws up his arms. “You always say we’ll work together against the rest of the Avengers and then you work against me first chance you get!”
Steve follows Rhodey’s lead but he takes a seat on the couch after taking off his jacket.
It’s that last word that convinces Steve to do it. Virginia Potts doesn’t seem like the type of woman to ask for things, much less ask for things that imploringly.
Steve smiles at Tony before turning his back to him and taking a few items from inside, but Steve’s body blocks Tony’s view of them. Steve turns around after a few seconds and Tony can’t help but chuckle when he sees what Steve is holding. A huge carton of ice cream -mint chocolate chip, Tony’s favorite flavor-, a box of Oreos and a bag of gummy bears.
Tony sighs as he hangs his damp towel out to dry in the hook behind the bathroom door.
“Were you waiting up for me?” Steve asks, holding a paper bag with no logo in it in one of his hands. He walks towards the counter and deposits the bag there but makes no move to remove the contents from inside it.
He closes his eyes too.

_______________________________
a good cook,” Tony says, reaching across the table and covering Steve’s hand with his own.
Tony nods. “That was a hearty conversation deserving of breakfast, I believe. So count me in, Cap.”
There’s nothing else to say between them for now, at least not for a few more minutes. The moment has pretty much spoken for itself.
Steve had said.
It might make more sense that Steve is giving it credit for but he has always been somewhat of a romantic, of a dreamer, and he thought the first time he finally kissed Tony he would do it after a beautiful night walk through Central Park. Or maybe after a romantic dinner by candlelight cooked by himself. Or even in the heat of the moment after a battle with the Avengers, dramatic love confessions included.
It’s only after he stops being able to watch Pepper go through the glass walls of the room that he realizes he wasn’t the one who told her about Peter and that that was the first kiss they had shared in over three weeks.
He feels dizzy but it’s almost an afterthought, having grown used to it the past couple days. It almost reminds him of the days he would spend locked up in his workshop so absorbed in one of his projects he would forget to eat for hours at a time. The sensation is not exactly the same but that memory is better than remembering how dizzy he’d be after getting waterboarded those first few days in Afghanistan.
He’s on a short leave from the Air Force and Tony feels almost gleeful when Rhodey calls him to tell him he’ll be staying in New York for the entirety of it. They’ve been talking at least once a week, like they’ve been doing for years, but in the past few months that hasn't felt like enough. Tony has had more than his fare share of scares and complications in his life, and Rhodey’s profession isn’t exactly known for its safety, but the slithering feeling in the pit of his stomach has never been as uncomfortable as it is now whenever he has to hang up from a conversation with Rhodey.
“But Toooooony.” Natasha mocks, arms crossed in front of her chest, her body positioned to block the pathway to the coffee maker. “Clint is my best friend, Stark. You have nothing on him when it comes to being persistent and believe me, I never cave.”
As soon as Bruce has finished talking Steve clears his throat.
“When you arrived I don’t know what I was feeling, it’s so confusing. All I know is that I took everything the wrong way. I was so sensitive and my brain kept looking for signs where there weren't any, I guess,” Tony ventures. “That wasn't your fault. But I’ll take a leaf out of my therapists book and say that it wasn’t really mine either. I wasn't being difficult on purpose.”
Maybe it was being over nine thousand miles away from New York, by now a lot more than just his safe space. Maybe it was the constant and full schedule he had to abide by during the trip. Maybe it was stepping into his businessman persona after having been away from it for so long. Maybe it was missing Steve with all he had.
Without giving it much thought Tony brings their hands up to his face and turns them so he can deposit a fluttering kiss on the back of Steve’s hand before bringing their hands down again. He looks into Steve’s eyes once more and it feels like they both decide at the very same moment.
It’s a silent request for permission and Steve answers silently in kind, opening his arms and extending his legs so Tony will be able to fit above him.
“Yes, Tony, I will.”
the world. We could have worked together. But…”
Steve stops, having run out of breath while speaking and needing to take in a big gulp of air to fill his lungs. He doesn’t continue speaking after, though, he just lets the last question go on unfinished. He’s looking directly at Tony, his head turned to the side even though his body is still facing forward. The intensity of his gaze is overwhelming, and if Tony was standing he’s pretty sure he would have been knocked off his feet by it.
It’s a losing battle and he forgets to breathe. There’s air in his lungs but he swears he forgets to breathe.
Rhodey comes back towards the kitchen island, cookie plate in his right hand. He deposits it in front of Tony and immediately takes one of them between his index finger and his thumb and offers it to Tony. Tony blows lightly on it and takes a small bite of it. The cookie has been baked to perfection. It’s soft and chewy, just like Tony likes them, the chocolate chips melting in Tony’s mouth before he even starts chewing.
If Rhodey or Bruce were here with him Tony would be trying to make light of the situation by making a joke. Maybe a “It’s show time” comment or a big show of rolling his eyes obnoxiously. Hell, if it wasn't Steve who Tony had to confront in just a few seconds
On the days where the sun feels too bright, too much like an undeserved prize, and he doesn’t want to leave the bed, he’s grateful when FRIDAY allows Steve entrance to his room.
Tony takes a step forward at the same time that Steve does, and he turns around so his back is to Steve. He moves his right arm first and puts it through the sleeve as Steve moves the coat so the shoulder of it settles on Tony’s own shoulder. Immediately after they repeat the action for Tony’s left arm and this time Tony has to hold onto the sweatshirt’s cuff so it won’t raise awkwardly through his arm and stay wrinkled under his coat.
Tony frowns slightly at Steve’s breathlessness.
“That— That’s not what I meant,” Tony says.
but I maybe suspected. I just… I was deep in denial. Still am, a little, not going to lie,” Steve explains ruefully.
The next time he wakes, he’s not alone anymore.
“You do?” Natasha questions but before Steve can confirm or deny Clint springs up from the couch.
“I’m glad to help in any way I can,” JARVIS assures.
“We’ve finished the wine bottle. Let’s go open another one.”
There's also discussion of depression during this chapter, similar to the themes we've had throughout the story already.
Tony, who always makes sure to make Steve’s every day better in any way he can. Tony, who is so selfless it sometimes terrifies Steve. Tony, who was the first one of the two to say I love you. Tony, who acted surprised when Steve said it back. Tony, because it’s always Tony.
This time the failure is not their fault.
“I used to help Sir before…” JARVIS pauses. “Before the Battle of New York.”
He’s not dying but he is. He knows he’s not dying but he knows he is.
Tony blinks forcefully and rubs his shaking fists into his eyes to clear his vision. When he looks at Steve again the man has one arm on the doorway, gripping it tightly, his knuckles white. His other hand is balled up into a fist next to his thigh. His posture screams worry and pain and if Tony looks up into Steve’s face that’s what his expressions reflects too.
Pepper was right -of course she was- when she said Tony would have loved to introduce Steve to every 21st century thing. As soon as Steve gives the go ahead Tony immerses him in a thousand things he hadn’t even contemplated experiencing before. Steve hadn’t even thought it was possible, considering that since meeting Pepper and Rhodey Steve has dived himself into the new century as much as he’s been able to.
He walks over to his walk-in closet, directly to the place where he knows it is. It’s easy to find, being practically in the middle of the room. It’s one of the first things he sees each morning as he walks inside every day to change clothes.
“I don’t want to lose you either,” Pepper says.
Steve laughs again but softer this time. His arms wrap around Tony’s shoulders, moving his body back so he’s resting completely on Steve’s chest.
“You,” Natasha replies.
Steve’s breathing through his mouth and although it’s not a very loud action in the silence of the room it feels clattering.
Steve’s face looks red with excerption and his cheeks are wet from tears that keep pouring out of his eyes desperately. His nose is running and he is breathing noisily and heavily.
Tony takes a step to put himself in front of Natasha instead of standing slightly to her side. This also serves to put his body between her and Rhodey.
It’s been quite a long time since Natasha’s felt the need to disguise herself or hide anything at the Avengers Compound and the fact that she’s trying to do some semblance of it again raises alarms in Tony’s mind immediately.
“Hey, listen to me,” Tony says, making sure to look directly into Bruce’s eyes. “We’ll bring him back, okay? If what he needs is to be here with us we will make that happen. We won’t leave him behind.”
“You like him, right?” Pepper asks him even though her face says she already knows the answer.
So Tony decides to go for the simplest and shortest answer in the hopes that Steve will fully understand.
The last conversation they had was full of empty threats and cutting remarks and deep hurt that was consuming Tony’s every nerve in his body and his soul: hurt for Rhodey’s precarious situation, hurt for Steve’s disregard of the teams’s well-being and Tony’s position, hurt for Natasha’s treachery.
“Tony,” Steve sobs. “That was never your fault.”
By the time Tony makes it out of his room the fight has seemed to finish and neither Clint nor Natasha are anywhere to be found on the common spaces.
Steve’s never been bad at texting -at least not in the last few months when it has come to keeping in touch with Tony- but he’s never truly been the one to initiate it. He’s also never truly been the one visibly straining to keep the text convos going.
“No you didn’t.”
Steve starts to turn slowly, rotating on his feet, Tony still held in the air, his feet dangling back and forth, his face delighted.
Steve can spend forever ignoring his needs, his feelings, his weaknesses. Steve can spend forever ignoring himself. But Steve never, not even for a second, ignores Tony and anything that might have to do with him.
“Have you noticed how often I wear your clothes?”
The living room feels so empty it’s almost suffocating. The space could host dozens of people comfortably but only Bruce, Rhodey, Steve, Tony and Natasha herself are occupying it at the moment.
“Well, I had made plans for lunch with Clint and Natasha called him. When she found out we were together she decided today was the perfect day for the double date she’s been craving for for so long.”
Steve frowns, confused.
Her eyes turn from looking at Rhodey to gazing into the horizon a little bit, focused on some faraway point, glazing over as if lost in her own mind.
“Huh,” Tony wants to smack himself from not coming to that conclusion sooner. The pants are one of Steve’s favorites track pants, after all. “Yeah, I guess I took them from the floor or whatever when I last got dressed thinking they were mine.”
Tony meets Rhodey outside, before he can even take one step towards the residence building, He’s just exiting the Air Force plane that has touched down at Avengers Compound to bring him to New York when he spots Tony and he grins delightfully. Tony doesn't run to meet him halfway but he doesn’t exactly walk either.
“What do you think is the reason for the change, then?” Steve asks as he uses his towel to pat his forehead and neck dry.
“He even had them do little poses and everything,” Rhodey remembers and although it’s less obvious than it is on Pepper his eyes look suspiciously misty too.
“What do you mean?” Tony asks.
“Oh,” Steve murmurs as his hand falls from the knob.
He hasn’t yet opened his bedroom door but his body is still half turned as if he was just about to walk inside it.
“This is delicious,” Steve says as he brings his fork to his mouth again.
“Wait,” Steve takes hold of one of Tony’s arms, stoping his movements. “You can’t go to sleep covered in grease, Tony. Let’s take these clothes off of you.”
“C’mon,” he says as he starts to move towards the bed. He climbs into it, discarding some of the throw pillows and kicking them to the floor. “Get comfortable, Captain.”
Even after three weeks traveling through space Tony wouldn't consider himself an expert on it but one wouldn’t need to be to be able to catch the devastation the planet has suffered.
He stands still as he watches Steve’s face color a dark, furious crimson, his shoulders rising almost to his ears and his nostrils flaring. He stands still as Steve bites his tongue to the point where it has to hurt. He stands still as Steve grabs his jacket and slams the door behind him, leaving Tony alone for the night.
It takes them 3 trips to take everything back to the kitchen and they immediately start loading the dishwasher, a task that normally falls on Tony and Natasha seeing as how Steve and Bruce are the ones who do the cooking.
Steve shakes his head.
“I won’t take more of your time,” Steve says. “I just wanted to give you my condolences.”
But Tony’s complain gets swallowed by Steve’s mouth, proving to be the most effective distraction. Tony’s hands rest against Steve’s back and take a fist of his own t-shirt (the one that the soldier is wearing) when Steve bites his lips particularly hard and makes him see sparks under his eyelids.
“What’s all this about?” Bruce inquires before Tony can.
_______________________________
under attack?
“Are you going to miss me, Smurfette?” he teases and without looking at him Tony hears Rhodey choke down a laugh.
“JARVIS, common floor, please,” Steve indicates as soon as they’re inside the elevator.
Steve leans into the touch for a second and he chuckles as his eyes close. His laugh is short but it sounds real and free, like such a simple moment is making him truly happy.
And then Steve closes his eyes.
But the Moon… Tony believes there’s a point in everyone’s life where the Moon succeeds at captivating your entire attention.
Seven.
Steve breaks the lock their gazes had been in and now it’s his turn to look out the window as Tony speaks.
_______________________________
When he was a little boy he had tailors assigned to him, little tuxes and leather shoes prepared for any kind of Starks Industries event that he had to attend.
“I also think I need to start helping out more in other ways. I’m going to be contacting government officials and some activists I know have already started doing some work. Things are chaotic outside, Tony. Economically, socially, environmentally, everything’s changed and even if we reverse everything that’s happened, will all those things be alright?”
“That obvious?” Tony asks, trying to grab one of the cookies but getting smacked in the hand by Rhodey wielding a spatula. Tony retreats his hand and glares at his best friend who just rolls his eyes.
“He kind of would have hated to hear that,” Rhodes informs him. “Tony didn’t do these things… He wasn’t Iron Man for the heroics or the glory… He was just…”
Slowly, so Tony can refuse him if he wishes, Steve starts moving his hands towards Tony’s hips. Sensing no sign of rejection on Tony’s demeanor and reading no objection on his facial expression Steve places his wide hands on Tony’s slender frame and gingerly picks him up, making Tony place his hands instinctively on Steve’s shoulders.
Tony moves in for a kiss again but before he can reach Steve’s lips he’s stopped.
Steve. Natasha. Bruce. Thor.
“Damn you, Romanoff.”
Steve doesn’t ask him to clarify, he just smiles softly and whispers, “Anytime.”
Bruce must read Tony’s hesitation and carried-on guilt on his face because he suddenly clarifies, “I promise it isn't something bad. It is something I maybe should have worked on a long time ago or maybe something that was only meant to happen this way. It is—“
It’s not like that hasn’t already become obvious enough by now.
Bruce dislodges Thor’s fingers from their grip on his shirt and moves backwards again. He seems resigned and angry all at once now but the first emotion seems to win out an internal battle in the end.
Despite his having forgiven her a long time ago something inside him still settles when hearing the words, like maybe the healing process has finally ended for this one emotional wound.
“FRIDAY, lights at 10%.”
His shoulders drop almost inappreciably and his head hangs down a little.
“You forget he used to be a spy just like me,” had been Natasha’s answer during on of their first meetings regarding the issue.
“I’m so happy,” she repeats. “And I’m so sad. So unbelievably sad about what happened.”
Tony finishes the bottle entirely and hands it back to Steve so he can throw it away. Steve then opens the mini fridge once again and takes out a couple more water bottles, this time walking over to the side of the bed with the chair and placing them in the nightstand there, sitting down as soon as he’s done so.
Tony doesn’t move for a few minutes, even if the position has to be killing his back, until his stomach rumbles.
Steve chuckles and goes to dip his own spoon into the ice cream. “I know how annoying you are about the good brands.”
But maybe that is actually what Steve was trying to ask him because, maybe, Steve knows as well as Tony does what their weaknesses are.
Tony raises his head and looks in the direction of the kitchen exit pondering about the abruptness of Steve’s departure. There are few places where Steve could have headed after leaving, only a handful of places where he feels completely safe and could have gone to protect himself, to stitch the broken pieces of his soul back together.
Tony supposes he always knew Natasha would end up coming to him about it and it makes sense she’s doing it when Rhodey is here considering he’s the one most constantly working on the Ronin case, even if he’s doing it on behalf of his military work and not on a personal basis.
Tony thinks Steve will plaster his body against his once again but now that they’re both down to their underwear Steve chooses to do something else.
Steve’s back and shoulders are so rigid Tony can almost feel their tension from across the room. Steve’s hands are balled up in fists and they rest next to his thighs on the bed. His posture screams defensiveness and tiredness and it hurts Tony’s heart.
She moves away from the kitchen counter and comes to start next to Tony. “But because I’m not stupid and I know you, I’ll escort you to your room myself.”
“Oh man,” Rhodey says, beer in hand and sprawled out on Steve’s couch. “Tony was just this little squirt back then, smarter than anyone and everyone at freaking MIT and causing trouble every other day.”
“You do realize that if we eat all of that we’ll end up puking our guts out all night, right?” Tony points out as Steve walks towards him and deposits the items on the kitchen table.
He walks into the room quickly, FRIDAY opening the sliding door for him without him even having to ask. Steve turns around, closing his book and depositing it on his desk as he turns his chair towards Tony.
Tony extends his arms, reaching out towards Steve and beaconing him closer so he can touch him. Steve reads Tony’s silent plea and he scoots closer towards him, resting his hands on either side of Tony’s face, holding himself over Tony’s body. Finally, Tony’s hands make contact with Steve’s chest and the smooth, unblemished skin there. Steve’s so soft, his skin feeling like heaven under Tony’s fingertips. He’s warm to the touch and he gets warmer as Tony’s hands explore his upper body.
“I’m so okay,” he says. “Super okay.”
He knows it’s not his fault, and he’s learning day by day that he doesn’t need to deprive himself of the people that surround him because some part of him tells him he doesn’t deserve them.
“Thank you, Tony,” Steve whispers, wearing the smile Tony knew he’d get out of him as he takes his Iron Man mug.
Steve keeps watching her for a few seconds and then his eyes travel from her face to the half-full bottle she’s holding and to her face again.
The street was loud and buzzing from all the people going by them even though not many cars had ventured to move in the snowstorm. Natasha and Sam were nowhere in sight but Steve’s plan would serve to remedy that.
It’s getting harder to breathe with his nose pressed completely to Pepper’s neck so Tony moves to rest his chin upon Pepper’s shoulder. His face is now facing forwards but his eyes are still closed until a the clearing of a throat captures his attention.
It’s family.
Tony doesn’t speak to confirm it but he does squeeze Steve’s hands to show his affirmation.
Nebula’s face subtly lights up and Tony’s surprised to recognize and understand the expression instantly.
Sometimes, the more you repeat a lie the more you come to loathe it.
“Maybe we could try another time?” Steve tries. “Pray to God that this time nothing life-threatening happens?”
“Tones,” he utters, voice full of wonder.
One of the charities she has started to work closely with, an organization taking care of kids that become orphans because of the snap, is in the process of building a massive orphanage in Boston and she believes his presence will give them a boost in publicity because for some reason the remaining Avengers still hold the regard of the majority of the population.
“Did he tell you about Thanos?” she clarifies.
It’s a patient kiss, slow in its tentativeness. Steve’s lips are a little dry against Tony’s but they feel  nice, nevertheless. Tony has his eyes closed, willing all of his attention towards each of his mouth’s nerve endings.
“Hello, Captain,” she greets him back. “Thank you for being here.”
_______________________________
He must have opened the package backwards because it takes him a second to realize he’s looking at the back of a picture frame, the metal claws that fix the thin wood layer and the little clawfoot meant to help it stand.
“So…” Tony pronounces, extending the vowel in the word. “You want to talk some more or…?”
“And we can also work every day to make sure that if we have to end we don't destroy us,” Steve pledges. “I won’t let you lose me, Tony. And I won’t let myself lose you, either.”
“Sorry,” Tony says. “I didn’t catch that, I guess I am very tired, too.”
Tony is looking into the light and there’s a woman and she smiles.
The good days were much different and they were spent inside the house. The good days were enjoyed entirely in pajamas or big, black t-shirts that let no grease stains show. They were spent with Jarvis in the kitchen just listening to him ramble about the cooking recipe he was trying that day or in his room, already filled with what were, probably, too many sharp objects for a kid his age.
“I still feel guilty every time I think about Bucky for letting him fall,” Steve whispers in the dead of the night.
“It’ll be there for when you are,” Tony says. “It’s yours.”
There’s something about the passage of time marked by their birthdays that Steve absolutely loves.
There are a thousand thoughts, and a million contradictions, and a hundred voices, and a billion feelings. Tony can hear Rhodey’s voice encouraging him and Natasha unknowingly begging him to do better than her. Tony remembers a dozen failures he made with Pepper and he tries to suppress the memories of every time he’s been let down or has disappointed someone himself.
When Tony and Steve go out there is no one following them from one place to another, trying to find the scoop on their life. They hold hands and less people ogle at them that Tony would have thought. They share meals in quiet restaurants, where conversations are practically whispered, like people have grown zealous of opening up their lives.
Tony intercepts Steve as he is making his way out of the Tower for a training session with some SHIELD recruits. Steve is about to walk out of the doors when Tony suddenly appears in front of him, physically blocking his exit. Steve could pick him up and move him aside but even quickly realizes how over the top and inappropriate that would be so he just stops dead in his tracks and waits for Tony to move or do something.
“So I need to try. I need to make him see that we’re still here for him.”
Tony and Steve stay like that for a good half hour and during that time the sun has made its way up the sky, bathing the room in a collage of oranges and yellows and making Steve’s hair almost shine where a stray ray is hitting it just right.
They’re not putting on a show for anyone, they’re not posing in front of the world, it’s a photo just for their eyes. Actually, it’s a picture just for Tony’s eyes and that’s what makes Steve fall in love with it.
There’s no use in hiding anymore. If everyone is going to be an open book so will he, no matter if the rest of the world doesn’t want to read what’s inside his covers.
His instinctive lashing out is met with Steve’s body going rigid in an instant.
Steve had, not surprisingly, been waiting for him on the helipad, and by the way he had slammed his body into Tony as soon as he had stepped a foot on solid ground, the days spent apart had affected him in just about the same way.
Sparring and training with Iron Man is something Steve will never tire of. It’s been weeks now and he still finds it as exhilarating as he did the first time.
“That sounds fucking ridiculous when I say it out loud,” Steve says.
Clint stays silent but his posture still screams combativeness.
It shouldn’t happen like it does, but the six month anniversary of the Decimation goes by completely unnoticed and unremembered at the Avengers Compound.
Finally, Nebula’s eyes move towards Tony’s and for the first time in 3 weeks she gives him a true, soft and voluntary smile.
Their love, so big and at times so blinding, brings forth so many problems and challenges that maybe, in another world, would only make them stronger but in this one only serve to push them further apart.
The man turned to face Clint, his face wet but his glare terrifying. “Thanks, Barton. Your help is deeply appreciated.”
“So then, why?” Tony asks looking even more confused than before, if possible.
He leans forward on his chair and leaves the glass he was holding on the table, using his now free hand to run it through his hair.
“No, you're not,” Tony says.
When they’ve all finished eating Tony notices Steve giving one of FRIDAY’s cameras a very conspicuous look. He’s trying to be subtle and sly about it but when he turns his head to look back at Tony he blushes as he sees Tony with one of his eyebrows raised in enquiry.
“Now?” Steve asks. “Like now, now?”
He waits. One second. Two. The third second feels eternal.
“Snow war?” repeated Steve.
After long minutes of looking away Steve looks into Tony’s eyes again and everything becomes sharper again, more transcendental and hard-hitting.
“War Machine is what Tony preferred to call it,” Rhodey informs him.
When that doesn’t help he has to wipe his under his nose with the cuff of his sweatshirt.
When Rhodey is serving the cake on small dessert plates Clint declines his by abruptly standing up from his seat. Natasha glares at him but Clint starts moving away from the table and heading for the exit.
“Rhodey, what is it?” Pepper asks again, this time letting go of Steve’s arm herself.
Steve’s laugh is quite obviously frenetic and desperate and Tony is pretty sure there is nothing helpful he can do except be there for Steve and have him know that.
Perhaps that is the worst part of it all, this uncertainty Tony will have to die with, the not knowing if there is anyone, anyone at all that he’s leaving behind.
And yet, talking about himself had Steve closing off, pulling away and hiding himself away from Tony. Hiding his face, his reactions, himself. It had him literally running away the minute something came spilling out of him in the kitchen.
“Maybe I do,” Tony corrects. “Maybe I have to lose her in order to not lose her, you know?”
But through everything they try again and again and again they can only reach one conclusion: there is, perhaps, nothing to be done.
_______________________________
Pepper stand up and moves away from his bedside, letting go of his hand. She extends her arm to grab a glass full of water from the nightstand and she brings it over to him, placing it gently against his lips, tipping it lightly so he doesn’t have to angle his head awkwardly.
Tony’s 48th birthday starts like the last two have started for him and Steve: in bed together kissing.
Without saying another word to Steve Tony starts walking towards his walk-in closet. Steve doesn’t call out to him, just stays behind sitting on his bed, waiting patiently as his eyes follow Tony across the room.
He goes on with his normal post-workshop routine, taking his Captain America mug and filling it to the brim with black, strong coffee. The mug was supposed to be a joke, never to be used, but when he gave Steve an Iron Man one and told him, “See, now we are the cutest couple to ever couple”, waving around his Captain America one, how was he to know that Steve would really start using it? But Steve does, and Steve loves it, and it’s only because Tony loves Steve that he started using his too. (And also because it is a cool, vintage cup, ok? But whatever.)
Bruce and him start reading every book, every paper, every text they could get their hands on, be it about any number of sciences they believe could be helpful or about any other topic they would have dismissed in a previous life, books about magic, and rituals, and religions and forces beyond human understanding.
Miss Potts gives him a soft smile.
Steve frowns and his mouth starts opening but Tony moves before he can utter a single word or make a noise.
Tony takes a couple of steps forward and brings himself closer to the glass walls but he makes no move to enter the room yet. He doesn't want to stay outside much longer while Steve is unaware of his presence because that seems like prying on a very private moment but he wants to make sure that he doesn't take Steve completely by surprise and unsettles him.
Pepper winces again upon hearing the recollection. “Yeah, that was terrible.”
“Nothing,” he answers, keeping his voice light. “I just didn't know you were at the point of traveling with Bruce quite yet after everything.”
that you’re wearing Steve’s clothes.
Each and every single one of these people Tony is looking towards to lost someone a year ago. It’s statistics, mathematics, the simple fact that half the population died and that means all of the other remaining half of the planet had to suffer the consequences too.
This uncertainty alone could have killed if he wasn’t already dying anyway.
The feeling abates when he receives a text from Steve telling him he’s on his way back to the Compound.
“I came to say that we’re leaving,” Nebula speaks for the first time. “Rocket and I.”
It’s all so overwhelming and Steve feels about ready to explode every morning when he wakes up.
_______________________________
Miss Potts looks very proper and put together in her black dress and Colonel Rhodes looks very stoic in his service uniform but Steve doesn’t need to look too closely to see the tightness around their eyes, the matching bags under their eyes and the way they both have to squint every now and again as if trying to will the tears away.
His eyes stay focused on the ceiling, though, because every bit of courage he has left doesn’t actually amount to that much courage anymore.
Tony turns around on his chair and his eyes widen slightly at the sight of Steve. He says something that must have been directed at JARVIS because the doors open immediately after.
And Steve. Steve as he’s cooking while Tony sits quietly at the table. Steve enraptured while watching movies. Steve on his bad days, quiet, withdrawn and then trying to put a smile on his face as if that’s going to fool any of them.
“Thank you,” Tony says.
Tony swallows and looks away from Steve for a second, focusing his gaze on the wide set of windows where he can see the trees moving slightly with the early morning breeze.
“I knew Tony better than anyone in the world except maybe Rhodey,” Pepper starts and Steve frowns lightly in confusion. “This past few years… Being Iron Man... It meant the world to him. He finally felt like he had found his calling.”
She’s going to be flying directly to Japan for Stark Industries business and they both decided it wasn’t necessary for Tony to go there with her. He’s been working on some R&D designs for the company and he’s scheduled to have a meeting with some engineers next week in the City to start developing some of them but the business intricacies of SI are more and more lost on him these days.
“I’m going to show you the whole world,” Tony says.
He moves his eyes to the screen for a second and indeed, the last of the credits are just rolling upwards, leaving the screen completely black.
He’s there but he’s not there. There are traces of his presence and yet it would be very easy to miss them and believe he never arrived.
Tony looks around as if Steve could be talking to someone else and then looks back at Steve.
He stands and reluctantly lets go of Tony’s hand.
Tony is wearing gray sweatpants that drag to the floor a little and a ratty t-shirt from some band Steve doesn’t recognize, a couple of holes showing the wear and tear of the item. He looks soft and cozy and something in Steve is screaming at him to take the steps that are separating him from Tony and run his fingers through his messy dark hair. He stays frozen in place, though, unable to move his eyes away from Tony’s frame.
Tony? Why did that name sound so familiar?
There are two different sketchbooks in the room, one on the workbench with two pencil cases and a case of coals resting on it and another one on the couch, looking as if it had been thrown haphazardly there.
Once they’ve completely calmed down Steve moves his hands off of Tony’s hips only to bring them to his shoulders and slowly start instructing him to turn around without words. This brings them both eye to eye as soon as Tony tilts his head to look up at Steve. Their chests aren’t touching but they’re not a full inch apart.
He might not be excited about the idea of a social gathering with Pepper Potts and Colones James Rhodes but it does beat the other options he has for the night.
An enormous Tower for a house in the heart of Manhattan. Four teammates that he doesn’t really know. The CEO of one of the world’s biggest companies discussing publicity strategies and funding opportunities for his team with him.
A small frown forms between Steve’s eyebrows.
She immediately stops talking, her sentence unfinished.
“Getting a taste of what me and Steve could have and then watching it all crumble away… I don’t know if I would survive that,” Tony says.
As you can see the number of chapters for this fic has gone up once again and I now think this story will have a minimum of 10 chapters. Notice how I said minimum? Yeah, I'm still not sure that's the final count.
(Find me on
Is Rhodey okay? Is he, too, mourning unconsolably at not having been able to fix things? Have Natasha and Bruce taken refuge on each other? Has Nebula been alone all this time or is she finding comfort in having one of her old teammates back? Is Thor feeling in any way better after having been able to kill the man responsible for all this pain?
_______________________________
A new tear is threatening to leave the corner of Steve’s right eye but he wipes it away with the tip of his index finger before it can roll down any further.
If anyone had asked him a couple weeks ago, he would have sworn that there was no such thing. He didn’t wear Steve’s clothes and much less wear them enough for it to be considered an obsession. Now though, he’s been embarrassed to find out he
Other times Steve hates nothing more than having to be the Captain.
Everyone’s been cracked open from the blows but Thor seems to have closed off like never before.
“Pepper. Pepper, thank God.”
The moment Tony feels his first silent tear escape his right eye, Tony brings his left hand up and places it delicately against Steve’s head.
Urgency in the tip of his fingers.
Tony starts shaking his head and he can’t hold back the tears anymore. They fall steadily as he blinks but there’s almost an order to them, like his body has learnt the perfect art of crying by now. Enough to release the sadness but not too much to render him unconsolable.
Tony has never seen Steve so full of anguish that it spills out of him this rawly, so uninhibited in his pain that it can even be felt through the air by other people.
Tony feels anger building up inside him but the fire doesn’t burn for long. The flames turn into smoke quickly and although he still feels angry enough to know he’ll find it difficult to talk to Steve after the event is over the feeling that starts consuming him rapidly is despair.
“Why would you think this could ever ruin us?” Steve asks, his lips moving against Tony’s finger. “Is it because you don’t think I feel the same. Because you have to know by now—”
That’s why the words shouldn’t feel monumental, but they strike something in Tony that shakes him to his core. They should feel redundant but they don’t. They aren’t life-changing but they’re important just the same.
“Look, it’s my time to apologize, okay?” Tony interrupts him before he can continue speaking. “ I’m sorry about what happened, about the way I reacted. I wish I could say I didn’t want to hurt you or Barnes but it wouldn't be true. At the time I really wanted to hurt you. I wanted you to hurt as much as I was hurting. I’ve never known that kind of rage before. But it wasn’t seeing Barnes, or the Winter Soldier, kill my parents that did it for me and you know it.”
“So what is?” Steve asks. He sounds resigned, like he already knows the answer to his own question but he doesn't want it said out loud.
Through it all Steve works very hard to never be left alone with Tony. It hurts in ways he can’t even understand but it feels easier than the alternative.
He’s not ready to open his eyes but he feels a hard squeeze in his left hand where it’s still joined with Nebula’s, where they’ve been joined for the whole flight back. He lets a couple of seconds pass before he squeezes back and opens his eyes.
The room is quiet when only a second ago Tony could hear people’s surprised gasps and erratic breathings.
And Steve does.
Tony moves the arm in which he’s holding the shield even though it is unmissable that it is what he’s talking about.
The rest of Tony’s morning is spent in a blur of calls and emails with people from the Maria Stark Foundation about their latest project, one that Tony has been deeply involved in for the past few months. Most of the charity’s work has been mostly contained to the US since its creation, but Tony has been pushing to change that with mixed results. The idea seemed simple in the beginning but there’s been a lot of bureaucratic work they’ve had to do in order to make it happen.
That is why once Natasha plants the seed, Tony can’t stop thinking about his apparent obsession with wearing Steve’s clothes.
It’s a simple confirmation, something that Tony knew but he needed to fully and wholly accept inside him. The minute he does the pain that had settled hard on his stomach lessens. It doesn’t disappear completely but it dissipates enough that it leaves space for other feelings in its place.
“You beast,” Tony jokes, stretching his arm to pat Steve’s stomach with his right hand.
“I don’t know,” she confesses. “Bruce told me that you and him are going to try something?”
She presses her lips together and clears her throat before continuing.
Steve blinks at him and opens his mouth, making Tony believe he’s going to speak, but he just yawns. He holds up a finger silently asking Tony to wait and he only puts it down when he’s done yawning.
Objectively he didn’t do much, seeing as how Bruce had been off working on his own, researching and working on Hulk issues he’s been trying to perfect, and the rest of the residents of the Compound were off most of the day.
Steve’s question brings everything to a halt.
But not Steve.
“Yeah,” Rhodey says. “I know that feeling.”
Once upon a time he would have been embarrassed to confess it but it matters very little at all in this moment.
“I came to say I’m sorry about how our lunch went the other day,” Steve says as he rests his elbows on the table. “I had been looking forward to it.”
“I left him be, at first. He was in no real danger and he was no danger himself so… I left him be. I should have just left him be.”
Steve smile grows and he nods, “Deal.”
Bruce and him spent the whole previous day in talks with a shapeless alien that communicated with them through the intergalactic video conference set up by Nebula and Rocket by projecting voices into their head.
It makes perfect sense, of course. There are many things from his past that Steve has stated regrets over, but if there’s one that the Decimation took its toll on that was James Barnes’ situation and, therefore, Steve’s involvement in it.
“But what if I have him and then I lose him?” Tony asks, his words coming out a little desperate. “What if maybe having him means not pursuing this at all?”
“I feel like that’s something too fitting for most of our days,” Steve says.
“Yeah, you absolutely look like you’re thriving right now,” she sarcastically points out.
“Yes,” he assures her. “Everything’s fine. It wasn’t that bad of a fight and I’ve taken care of things just as we planned. It actually…. Well, I have to say things went very smoothly thanks to some of your plans.”
When they separate, with one last bite from Tony to Steve’s bottom lip, Steve’s mouth is cherry red and puffy, and a shiver of arousal zips through Tony’s body.
His shoulder feels cold when Steve removes his hand from it but suddenly it’s his side that warms up when Steve occupies the space to his left. They’re not touching but Steve’s big and strong body cuts off some of the wind from making it to Tony. He’s also sort of like a furnace, a small star emitting heat that is making its way into Tony’s bones.
Steve and Tony start dating on a lovely April night, even though they’re not outside to actually enjoy the warm weather.
“Well, baby cakes, as long as it is a mutual thing I can live with it.”
“I don’t think you would, no,” she agrees.
“Steve!” she greets him, sounding worried. “Are you alright? Did everything go okay?”
“What didn’t you mean?” Steve asks, uncrossing his arms and opening them up in a sign of question. “To avoid me?”
“It’s nice to meet you.” Tony said when the handshake ended. It had probably lasted a little too long to be considered casual. “I’ve heard a lot about you.”
Only a minute ago he wasn’t sure he was ready, or even wanted, to have the conversation, the one that has always seemed inevitable after everything that happened between them, but now, realizing Steve is not going to be starting it, Tony can’t help but feel like the world has snatched something precious away from him.
She walks over to him and bends a little bit at the waist so he doesn’t have to look up at her awkwardly.
Steve closes his eyes and tries to forget for a minute that he can feel the shape of his Stark-phone pressed against his ear. He desperately wants to believe he is back at home, in Tony’s penthouse, cuddling with him in what has already become
So, Tony has never been that particular about the clothes he wears. Even less so since he started dating Steve. And that is why this recent development in the crazy storm that is Tony’s life doesn’t make any sense.
Now that for one second, and by a simple slip, the conversation has turned to Tony Steve is finally opening up, like a rose in bloom. Tony showed his own insecurity at Steve, even if he hadn't meant to, and Steve didn’t hesitate and was there ready to catch him.
“I love you, too.”
He’s standing close to Steve, so close he can see his Adam’s apple move when Steve swallows heavily.
It’s fast and efficient and the second the last of the nanobots slips into place Tony feels it deep in his bones. The suit is him and he is the suit.
Tony begins to spend a lot of time out-doors, to the surprise of everyone around him, but most of all him. There is something suffocating now about locking himself for too long on his lab and not seeing any sign of life. It’s too close to what some of his nightmares still are -too close to Titan- and so he starts bringing some of his equipment outside. He sits on the grass, papers, tablets and holograms all around him while he asks FRIDAY for input.
Steve and Pepper move their gazes away from the discussion and lock eyes from above the rim of their wine glasses. Pepper rolls her eyes exaggeratedly and takes a loud sip from her glass, making Steve chuckle.
_______________________________
But if Tony and Steve thought that Bruce’s and Natasha’s comeback would be more relaxed than how the day started they were both dead wrong. Natasha’s first steps back into the Compound are nothing short of the march of a soldier walking into war. Bruce’s first steps back into the Compound are nothing short of those of a defeated soldier making his way back home after a lost battle.
“Tony, Tony,” Rhodey says as he puts his hands on Tony’s shoulders to try and calm him down.
It’s the knowledge that there could have been love but the universe didn't let it become that.
Tony walks out of the walk-in closet with one of the shield’s leather straps placed on the crook on his arm and the other one gripped tightly on a fist with his hand.
Pepper hums shortly and bites her wine-stained bottom lip. “I was the one who said you’d be good together, remember? Before we even had Tony back.”
Because the first time Tony tells Steve he loves him is also the day he calls him the love of his life.
He knows it isn’t true, he knows it was only a matter of time until Peter upgraded from petty thieves and street criminals to the bigger leagues, and he knows Peter never needed his help to become the big hero that he was. But the
“Everyone,” he ends up saying. “I hope everyone is okay.”
A frown deepens the lines on Steve’s face and Tony is hit by the sudden realization of how Steve looks older than he did when they both first met. It shouldn’t be that surprising because over 6 years have gone by since then and Tony can definitely tell
“Dessert,” Steve states, moving his hands as if shaking some grand prizes.
“I don’t know,” he answers honestly.
As his second tear traces a path down the slope of his nose, Tony tightens his grip on Steve’s hair.
But once again Tony lost and once again Steve is gloating because if there is one thing Steve Rogers had been born as and has never, ever lost -even through all the trials and tribulations of his life- it is being stubborn and competitive.
His voice sounds gravelly as he speaks and he wishes he didn’t need to move to get a glass of cool water.
His voice is now nothing more than a whisper and he can feel himself slowly deflating but he says, “So I got nothing for you, Cap. No coordinates, no clues, no strategies, no options. I’ve got nothing,” his finger hits Steve’s hard chest, right in the center of his sternum. “Zero.” Another jab with his finger, this time harder. “Zip.” Another tap even though his arm is shaking now. “Nada.”
“I’m not asking you to work for me. I’m not even asking you to regroup the Avengers if you really think under different circumstances the team won’t work,” Pepper promises him. “I’m just asking you to consider moving into the Tower so I could help you with anything you needed. So maybe Rhodey could help too. Even JARVIS perhaps, although I don’t know if you’ve ever formally met him.”
He looks younger, somehow, positioned like that. It’s like he’s trying make himself smaller, like he’s trying to hide from the world. Like he’s only a little boy scared of all that’s happened and all that’s to come.
That day it is very obvious there are two separate groups within them: there’s Pepper, Rhodey and Tony; and then there’s Pepper, Rhodey and Steve. Both groups have their own idiosyncrasy down, even if they’re a little out of sync, but most of the awkwardness originates from trying to mesh the groups, trying to make them work and blend until there’s only one.
She’s crying and although he doesn’t feel ready Tony opens his eyes because if there is even a small chance he can make this easier on Pepper he will take it.
It seems like it’s just simply something Tony likes. For no particular reason, with no particular motive. It’s a small gesture, effortless and uncomplicated. It’s like keeping a piece of Steve with him at all times but not needing the constant reminder that he’s there. They’re comfortable and soft, and most of them carry that particular smell that Tony has come to associate with the super soldier.
They’re not actual hearings per se, more like “casual business meetings to go over the issues of Ronin and the possibility of future retributions and consequences”. Or so Natasha says.
Tony’s jaw clicks shut and for a second it feels like he’s less able to gulp down oxygen here than he was back in the ship.
The suit is a work of genius, even Steve can tell, and his more sensitive side even sees it as a work of art.
Just like with Tony and Steve it’s taken time and work to get things to this point but just like with Tony and Steve it feels as natural as breathing most days.
It’s like a switch has gone off inside him. Like he’s seeing things clearly now where before he was just trying to walk into a room with his eyes closed and all the lights turned off.
“Okay.”
The first real bad day Tony has while dating Steve doesn't start off as a bad day at all.
“Here for some quiet contemplation with dear-old me?” Tony asks, curious.
Steve’s chair squeaks unpleasantly against the tiled floor when he pushes it back and stands up abruptly. His hand rips away from Tony’s hands, leaving them hovering awkwardly in the air.
That changes the first night JARVIS helps Steve during one of his worst nights at the Tower.
Steve and Rhodey are able to spend less time together but they quickly create a connection in the way only people with similar experiences can, in a way that Steve’s only been able to create with fellow soldiers. They spar together and Rhodey never minds the fact that Steve can always beat him, saying it’s improving his skills better than any other kind of fighting could. They drink and laugh together and, every once in a while, they whisper to each other about the sleepless nights and the memories.
When he’s done in the bathroom Tony walks back into the bedroom and sees that Pepper is still in the same spot he left her.
Most mornings he wakes up feeling the need to move and do something almost immediately. He’s never particularly needed a lot of rest and when he was younger he was very good at running on little to no sleep. These days it has more to do with how repose calls to grief for him. The minutes Tony spends not doing something are minutes when a thousand unwanted thoughts can make their way into his head and Tony’s become proficient at avoidance. Staying in bed does him no good, especially when the other side of it always stays empty. Every morning. Every night.
“We?”
One of Steve’s hands leaves Tony’s and with the remaining hold he has on his right one Steve starts moving slowly towards Tony’s bed. In just a few, short steps they reach Tony’s bed and Steve signals Tony to sit on the edge of it. He doesn’t let go of Tony’s hand when he sits but his hold is lighter now, like he’s giving Tony the opportunity to pull away if he so desires. Tony doesn’t want to break his connection to Steve so he tightens his hold on Steve’s hand and pulls him forward until Steve gets the hint and moves to sit next to him.
“Oh, hey,” Rhodey greets.
It’s clear Steve has worked it out when his eyes grow soft and all the muscles in his face relax. It makes him look so much more handsome, Tony thinks. Or maybe it’s not that, because it’s not like Tony can think of a time when Steve is not completely and utterly gorgeous. Maybe it’s just that Tony prefers this version of Steve, the one less troubled by the world, the freer one, the happier one.
But when Rhodey tells him, “Tones, man, I don’t need the perfect retelling of it. I just want to know what it was like for you.”
been putting this off for way too long.”
Natasha tends to describe him as honest. Honest because he rarely lies to any of them and honest in his intentions. They’ve recently established an strong rapport together and she’s become bolder around him. She speaks her mind and challenges him when she’s not happy with one of his decisions and although she has never said it out-loud Steve knows she also thinks of him as a determined -at times stubborn- person.
There’s no sound from the other three people and no movement either, so Tony continues.
Tony looks around the room at his friends -at his family- and he feels their grief and their regret mixing with his as strongly as if it was all just his.
Tony walks out of the shower when his fingers start showing signs of pruning.
_______________________________
“You ready or what?”
They love each other. They've loved each other for a while. They’ll love each other tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after that.
“Hey, there you are,” he greets, making no move to get closer to Tony again.
“Stop it!” Tony begs in between breathless laughs once Steve has introduced tickling him into the equation.
“Hey, sweetcheeks.”
Romanoff nods.
(See? Tony does really know him well. Steve is totally a romantic at heart.)
When Tony moves his hands to try and remove the towel from Steve’s body, the soldier reacts quickly and captures both of Tony’s hands with one of his.
“I have a feeling that after what you went through Tony would have wanted to keep all of you, the Avengers, close together,” she says. “I guess with him gone… I want to keep you close to me, in a way.”
Perhaps that’s where his bout of bravery comes from. Maybe it’s because of how brave Tony thinks Steve has always been that he feels like he should match him. Maybe he’s always just trying to be worthy of someone like Steve.
side and I’m sorry you felt like you couldn’t trust me enough to tell me about my parents.”
It takes them the blink of an eye to move their heads close together. It takes them a century to press their lips in their first ever kiss.
Steve chuckles and this time Tony is aware enough of Steve’s reactions to his words to laugh with him.
And then, Steve can’t help but think:
“I know you can do it,” Tony agrees. “I’m just wondering if it’s the best thing for you.”
On days when they fight -because no matter what they’re Steve and Tony and they would fight their own shadows if there was a way to do so- Tony calls him bull-headed, self-righteous, a perfectionist, a hypocrite and a million other names. He always, always apologizes after. Some times it takes him hours and other times it takes him days; some times it’s a straight-forward apology and other times it’s laced in so many embellishments and sarcastic quips that Steve has to decipher it. But Tony always apologizes.
“Sure, Steve,” Tony pronounces. His eyes are narrowed and he’s looking at Steve like he’s trying to solve him like one very difficult math equation.
“So,” Tony said after a couple of minutes in which no one did or said anything. “I could still use an introduction, Nat.”
He sighs and Tony suddenly can feel deep in his bones Steve’s own exhaustion, a perfect mirror image of his own.
The fight never ends but the fight has ended him, this time.
“What’s wrong with you?”
“I think I make a terrible substitute for Tony, anyway,” Steve tries to joke. “I don’t have the style or the confidence or the attractiveness for it.”
Neither of them can be sure there is a tomorrow in the horizon. They both know there is a possibility they won’t make it another day, and by the way things are going, it’s obvious Tony is the one closest to the abyss.
“The way Pepper and Rhodey talked about you, what I learnt from JARVIS, the videos and stories… It might make me sound crazy but it brought me closer to you. I know now that what I felt then was nothing compared to what I feel now.  I hadn't really known you before but the glimpses I was able to catch, the small things I saw… There was something there, a spark of love that you ignited when you came back.”
“It made it a little difficult to get out of bed this morning,” Steve says.
When he thinks about it he does it with a little hint of pride.
On the days where he’s happy, Steve is there too.
He clears his throat to get rid of the uncomfortable sensation of dryness on the back of it. He’s about to inquire to FRIDAY about the light when he feels the bed move without him causing it.
Tony decides not to think too hard about it and he pulls open his door, walking in the direction of the kitchen confidently and purposefully.
“We could be so good, we really could. I’d love the opportunity to show you that,” Steve says. “I’d love to prove that I’m not just delusional for all this I just told you. I don’t believe in things like fate but I think I found you for a reason. I needed a reason to live and not just exist in the 21st century and you gave me that, even if I thought you were dead at the time. And it’s only gotten stronger since I really got you.”
in Rome, he knows Tony understands it.
“Tell that to him, Nat,” he demands.
Truth is, he has lost most of his appetite.
As he and Pepper start walking towards Tony’s room Natasha and Steve head towards the sliding doors in the living room and they step outside to take a walk around the property. As he turns around to close the door, Steve’s eyes catch Tony’s. It’s only for a second but it’s enough to give Tony the bout of strength he needs.
the understanding.
It’s a relief and a shame all at once.
and they had set themselves to once again face each other in the damn game.
“I don’t want to admit it but I think this may be it, the last opportunity I have to say anything at all.  We’re running our of oxygen and I think I can feel it coming.… I…,” Tony pauses and a bitter laugh escapes his lips after around 15 seconds. “The last opportunity I have to say whatever it is I need to say and I, for once, am speechless. What a fucking irony.”
Slowly, Steve’s head turns to the right and he meets Tony’s eyes.
“Tony, hey.”
Steve’s kisses had started out ferocious and hungry, raw in the most visceral way. Tony hadn’t even felt the cold for the whole half hour they had spent kissing outside, Steve’s warm body keeping him sheltered for the whole of it.
“Yes!” Pepper replies as she starts calming down but a laughter escapes her throat again. “You’re so totally his type.”
“I don’t know what I’d do without you.”
Pepper nods and when she moves her head to the right the light reflects on her eyes, letting Tony see the tears gathering in them.
Steve doesn’t actually say a word.
Tony gets up from the chair and approaches Steve, wrapping his arms around his waist and ignoring the catcalls coming from his friends (mostly from Clint, obviously).
“We’ll work on it,” Steve promises. “We have to do better.”
“I know being a dick can be part of your trademark but you just went beyond what’s acceptable,” Natasha states as she points with her right hand at Clint.
Steve leaves the Compound late in the evening to have an emergency session with his therapist. The fact that he’s willing to face the risk of running into the press while being outside proves how much Steve is really in need of it.
When Tony makes it back to the Avengers Compound it’s obvious that while he passes Thor every once in a while in the common areas his presence follows that of Clint: two phantoms, not quite people anymore, not quite ready to continue on with their lives.
His silence lets her know Tony agrees even if he doesn’t want to confess his weakness out-loud.
His psychologist would be proud of him for being able to recognize that he was just in as much need of support as Steve was. But life-long instincts to ignore his own feelings and hard-wired desire of helping the ones he cares about above everything else are hard to get rid of.
As time passes Tony feels his eyes start to drop, his eyelids growing heavy, and at some point after 3:10 AM -the last time his eyes drift over to the clock and check the time- he must doze off because next thing he knows he wakes up slouched down on the living room couch as Pepper whispers his name and pushes a strand of hair away from his forehead.
As Tony bends down to close the dishwasher door Steve clears his throat. Tony incorporates and closes it, pressing the button to turn it on and then looks at Steve. He’s standing in front of him, hands in his pockets, his expression concerned.
“Well,” she says as she moves a couple of steps away from Steve now that he’s no longer coughing. “The hand holding. The intense looks. The smiles. You’ve been doing it all night.”
“Never.” Steve proclaims, moving Tony around effortlessly and positioning himself above him. “Not until you admit you look good in my clothes.”
“Steve!” Tony whines, extending the vowels of his boyfriend’s name.
Tony bites his bottom lip to prevent himself from letting out a soft laugh but he can feel the smile grazing his lips. He extends his hand and waits a couple seconds while Nebula looks at it, obviously debating internally whether to take it or not.
But the image that Steve’s watching right now doesn't paralyze him because of the place it’s showing.  It’s who’s standing in it that’s left him speechless, because it’s not any of the Avengers, no matter how unusual that would have been.
Pepper comes back to New York and stays with him for a little over a week and during that time they have videoconferences with shareholders and employers from all around the globe, even with other companies from their sector that have started cooperating more with them to try and keep the markets from crashing.
perfectly and comes down just past his bellybutton, leaving a strip of skin visible between the shirt and his pants. A delicious, very bitable, very appealing patch of skin.
“Steve,” Steve says.
“If he’s not talking to me or Valkyrie I doubt he’d agree to see someone, a psychologist, I don’t know,” Bruce guesses.
But Tony is tired. He’s exhausted.
Pepper reaches over and brings her glass of water to her lips. She sips slowly and Steve knows it’s a way to gain a few seconds to compose herself. She places it back on the table and gives him a sad smile.
Tony doesn’t speak during this time except to guide Steve along on his breathing and remind him he’s still there, things like “That’s good”, “Keep breathing” and “I’m here”.
“How about we make a pact?” Tony announces a little suddenly and a little too loudly, startling Steve.
Meanwhile, Steve is still crying.
“Look, don’t tell the others, okay?” Tony pleads. “I’m honestly fine with having the party. They’ll have fun!”
Tony stands and starts walking towards the couch. Steve incorporates a little, keeping his back to the couch’s arm but bending his legs so they’re not taking the complete length of it.
But Clint is different. He’s combative, violent even -at times-. He’s snappy with everyone around him, even with Natasha. Maybe even more so with Natasha because of how much trust there is between them. It’s like he’s put on this hard-shell around him, an armor he won’t take off, an armor that is slowly becoming all that he is.
He just holds her as she cries and silently vows to do his best to help her. To help Clint.
A silence envelopes them both but Tony’s surprised at how it’s not particularly an awkward one. It also doesn’t feel comfortable, though. It’s a heavy but manageable silence and they let it stay there with them for a couple minutes, just basking in it.
The event is the biggest Tony has ever participated in and that’s saying something. It’s still the most silent he has ever heard the Washington DC streets being.
A silence follows Steve’s words and the only thing Steve can hear is DUM-E’s soft chirps from where he’s bumping his metal claw lightly into U’s one, the second bot ignoring him for some reason Steve can’t seem to interpret but Tony would probably understand immediately.
“Let’s go to bed, Rhodey,” Natasha instructs as she walks closer to him and clasps his shoulder.
Steve lets out a painful sounding sob.
Growing agitated at the muffled sounds from the outside Tony walks into his adjoined bathroom and turns on the shower. The shower head is a big and round thing that makes it rain inside the big glass cubicle. If he so desires Tony can change the settings to a thick jet, a lighter stream, a steam sort of spraying and 4 jets that don’t stop moving in circles for some reason Tony has yet to understand.
When he’s close enough to it, standing right over Steve’s seated form, Tony crunches down, resting one of his elbows on an empty space next to Steve’s body. This leaves Tony a little below Steve and Steve has to lower his gaze to look directly into Tony’s eyes. They’re so big and earnest, a warm and shining brown that Steve hasn't been able to reproduce correctly on any of his drawings or paintings.
The look in her eyes tells Tony she knows just as well as he does how difficult it will be to actually make that happen, but neither of them shatter the fantasy yet.
“Careful, Tony. Be careful,” warns Steve, still standing next to him and looking over him intensely.
He looks at her and smiles sadly as their eyes lock.
Can you believe we broke the 100k barrier with this chapter?  *Paul Rudd's who would have thought? meme*
After maybe a minute has gone by Tony starts fidgeting and transferring his weight from one leg to another, simply looking for something to do under Steve’s intense gaze.
He wants to say,
“Would you—” Bruce starts but then he stops himself.
Tony’s delighted face changes with Rhodey’s comment, though, and it transforms into an expression of genuine offense. Even so, Steve can still see the glint in Tony’s eyes, clear indication that he’s enjoying the bantering with Rhodey to its fullest extent.
She delicately puts her hand on top of the one Tony still has on the table. Tony looks down at them and then looks up at her face. She looks concerned, her forehead not quite set in a frown but still carrying tension. Tony moves his other hand away from his chest and tries to smile reassuringly at her.
Steve nods but Tony’s speech doesn’t really need any feedback now that Tony’s on a roll.
Pepper’s also one of the most supportive people Steve’s ever had about his art and she never fails to comment on his talent and the beauty of his creations. She has some of Steve’s pictures framed and on display in her office and she’s helped him show some of his art anonymously in small, inconspicuous galleries.
It’s maybe the reason they used to work, before they grew away from each other instead of growing into each other.
Tony side-eyes him and then looks down at his wrist watch, a newly gifted one from Pepper.
“I don’t even know what you’re complaining about,” Steve says as he inserts the Blu-Ray into the player and presses the button to close it. “You were the one who said you wanted to watch this movie the other day.”
Feeling like it’s what he has to do -and too full of pent-up energy to go to sleep- Tony waits up for Pepper doing some idle work on his tablet. He’s got three different projects open on his device: one for Steve, one for Natasha and another one for Bruce.
“What’s wrong?” Steve says, his hand moving closer to Tony’s head, like he’s going to caress him or run his fingers through his hair.
Tony throws his head back, his breath catching in his throat and his hips rising from the mattress, chasing more contact with Steve’s body. He moves his hands away from Steve’s chest and wraps his arms around Steve’s waist so his hands can settle on his back. Slowly, he traces a path from the top of Steve’s back to his ass, grabbing onto it with both hands to push Steve’s lower body into his.
trying to do better and we want people to keep moving forward. That’s true. But that’s not all you did.”
And Steve knows Tony is insecure and tends to think very little of himself. So of course he would immediately think Steve’s avoidance of him comes from a place of hate, especially after how the last interactions Tony remembers between them went.
Steve’s the last one to exit the building so he’s the one closing the door behind him. He then turns back to Tony and looks on as Tony blows into his hands, trying to warm them up with his breath.
Steve playfully bites Tony’s earlobe making him yelp. “Now who’s being the asshole?”
“I don’t know,” he says. “Some days I think it is the worst idea I could ever have and then other days I think maybe it could be the best thing to ever happen to me.”
“I’ll be back as soon as I can, I’ll just shower and make a couple of calls and then I’ll be back,” Rhodey repeats.
In a very quick maneuver Steve stood up from his crouched position and aimed his big and compact snowball towards Sam.
Steve shakes his head at Tony’s comments and his plan.
But seeing Steve cling to his shield, having him right in front of him and knowing him, truly
As soon as Tony’s gaze settles on Steve’s the need for hiding dissipates.
They’re all sitting around Tony’s living room table, at the Tower’s penthouse that had been previously been left unoccupied during all those months they believed Tony to be dead. Tony and Steve are on one side and Pepper and Rhodey on the other.
He ends up sitting on the floor with a sketch he keeps in the workshop on his lap as the bots move around him, the sound of their joints and their wheels soothing and comforting in between all the chaos in his mind.
The different social climate, and the subtle cultural changes, and the political differences all around the world, and the different fashion sense, and aliens, and gods, and super spies, and robots, and the different buildings he spots around Brooklyn the few times he goes to visit.
I am so sorry for how long it took me to post this chapter.
A bead of pre-come runs down the size of Steve’s dick and reaches his hand. The touch is drier than what Steve generally prefers so he moves his hand away from his dick and brings it over to his mouth. He quickly gets his palm wet, running his tongue precisely through it, and one by one he  puts his fingers inside his mouth, wetting them as well.
“I was also not in a good emotional state,” Tony confesses. “And part of it had to do with the Accords, with why I thought we needed them. That’s why things got ugly in the end, I think, because it became personal.”
Tony waved his hand around, nonchalantly.
“One more thing,” Steve says, still sitting down on the couch, making Tons have to look down at him.
“We’re not soldiers,” Stark had said.
He’s wearing a pair of loose jeans and a gray hoodie that is very soft to the touch. Tony knows this because he’s seen Steve wear the same outfit a hundred times, his preferred clothes for staying in.
Things get calmer after that and it’s like the world has let out a collective sigh of relief.
Bruce bends forward a little to get a little closer to Tony’s level and height. Tony raises his right hand on instinct towards Bruce’s face and he touches Bruce’s cheek lightly with his fingertips. Bruce’s left hand comes up and his fingers wrap delicately over Tony’s wrist. They don’t apply any pressure or move it away, they just stay there, a reminder, an anchor.
“Did you really let me win?” she wonders.
“What did you…” he stammers. “What did you mean about Tony and me?”
There’s a slow movement to Tony’s right and Tony opens his eyes, not having realized previously that he had closed them. Everything is blurry around him but through the daze Tony can make out the shape of Steve in the doorway, so imposing and comforting at the same time.
“He would have probably called you self-righteous at times but he would have actually admired your determination, he’d definitely comment on your ass all the time and I would have to suffer through it constantly,—“

“I’ll have to think of what things are appropriate to reveal without breaking Sir’s privacy but I genuinely want to help,” JARVIS assures.
The experience had been unlike anything Tony had ever lived before and, from a scientific standpoint, it was marvelous and terrific to be able to participate in something like that. From a more personal view of things Tony had gotten bored of it after two hours and well into the third one he had realized the conversation was going nowhere and the information this guy had supposedly had on souls and matter had all been useless in the end.
“I’ve been doing some research,” Steve explains. “Into group therapy and professionals. Psychologists and stuff. People who could fit, you know? I’ve been doing it for me but um… Also for you.”
In the end, although Pepper never asked him for the Avengers and he never promised he’d be able to reunite them, the Avengers is what they have. All under the same roof. Not quite a team but still close enough to work together.
“What if…” Tony starts but his sentence trails off.
“Thank you,” Steve says. “Thank you so much, JARVIS. I would love to.”
He nudges Tony’s legs open a little wider so he can fit his upper body between them and he lowers his face towards Tony’s chest. His kisses first are slow and exploring, his tongue coming out to lick some of Tony’s scars or moles. He takes his time making his way down Tony’s sternum, tracing a pattern that Tony quickly recognizes as the arc reactor if the arc reactor was something that Tony still had incrusted in his chest.
He can’t stop replaying the conversation in his head and each time he comes up with a different way of how he could have handled and said things differently. If only he’d been a little less quick to jump to conclusions, he thinks. If only he’d been a little more clear-headed so he could have supported Steve as he now realizes Steve needed.
“I mean it,” Natasha confirms. “If I hadn’t, we wouldn’t be in this mess right now. If I hadn't, I wouldn't have wasted so much time. I wasted time waiting to see if something would happen, and then I wasted time worrying as things were happening. Later I wasted time waiting for him to give me a sign that he was even alive. And then I wasted time waiting to see if something would happen. Again.”
They’re attuned to each other now, whether they like it or not, and Tony thinks that, as much as he hates the situation, there could be worse people to be stuck with on a stranded ship moving across the universe with no real aim or direction.
Pepper’s voice disconnects him from his musings and brings him back to the present, pulling his eyes from his hand and Tony’s towards her. She’s standing from her chair and grabbing the wine bottle with her left hand as she grabs her glass with the last. She’s smiling lightly and looking directly at him.
“There’s something that I…” Tony starts and then backtracks. “Would you mind coming in for a second so I can give you something?”
Natasha’s yell echoes around the living room and it halts Steve in his process of getting up to face Clint. As if magnetized, Steve’s body falls immediately onto the couch again, this time closer to Tony, their thighs and shoulders touching in wordless support.
Bucky was the first to move and leave their hiding place. He proceeded carefully, his eyes alert, looking for a sign of either of his enemies. He walked the street in what to an outsider would look like an aimless pattern but Steve knew better. He was a distraction.
He makes it to the common floor in less than a minute and he heads directly to the living room, his legs feeling like they’re going to fail him at any second.
“What a mess of a team we’ve become.”
“I told you there could be revisions. We could have worked to make them more to our liking,” Tony reminds him.
The nightmares still happen and there are nights when fog floods his lungs and electricity paralyzes his muscles, but they’re getting easier to deal with now, maybe because Steve knows he’ll be able to actually get better sleep the next night.
His other hand is still placed on Tony’s shoulder, unimposing, monumental.
As they finish eating, Steve and Tony start clearing the table, leaving Natasha and Pepper with their wine glasses in hand, just talking.
Steve’s head turns abruptly to the left, letting him look at Tony directly in the eye. The pain and anguish in his expression nearly breaks Tony in half.
Feeling his every muscle protest at simply standing up, Tony concedes to the point and goes to move to the bed.
He just hopes Nebula will forgive him for leaving her alone. He hopes Nebula is alive long enough to forgive him for it.
“But I don’t think I would last much time there.”
Tony is surprised to find how unsurprised most people are by the announcement.
Tony in particular has had to deal with experiences like that for all of his adult life. Hell, he even had to deal with things like that before he could even be thought of as a real adult.
“Sorry,” Tony murmurs.
whether that means he can be silent, bubbly, introspective or nostalgic depending on the day.
“I can’t believe…”
“They’re kicking our asses.” Steve said matter-of-factly from his placed crouched behind a car, where he and Bucky were hiding and catching their breath from the snowball fight that had been going on for the last 15 minutes.
“I mean we can come to some kind of arrangement, Cap,” Tony proclaims. “You get them every first weekend of the month. I get them the odd numbered months. You take them on Christmas and I’ll have them on Thanksgiving. We switch off every Four of July because I don’t care if you’re Captain America that’s one of the funnest holidays.”
They get interrupted by a different waiter this time, this one carrying their two plates with her. She quickly sets them down on their table and leaves with a smile and a wish for them to enjoy their food.
Steve laughs and nods, giving his attention back to the bots for a few seconds until Butterfingers moves away from him prompting the other two to do the same. They don’t move back towards Tony but to their corner of the room, where they start playing around with a few toys and objects that hadn’t been there the last time Steve had been in the room.
“There were other kids we sometimes played with or hung out with but… That was mainly because they liked Bucky. Or just convenience, maybe, because they lived closed to us. No one came around, and even less so stayed around, because of me.”
“Yeah, well, time has granted me perspective and I know now that there are worse things that can happen to me than apologizing.”
The color is different from the redness that had been there before from the crying. This time it’s a little more subtle, more pink than red, it looks softer on Steve’s features. Tony prefers this color a lot better than the one before.
“Of course, Captain,” JARVIS replies.
“I do understand, you know? I get your worry. And I guess in some way I should find it flattering that you worry this much, because that proves how important it is to you,” Steve says. “But I know two things about this. Only two certain things. The first is how I feel about you. I’m so certain of that.”
He tries to think of something to say, something to diffuse the tension he can feel building up inside him. It’s a fruitless effort and after five or so seconds he’s still drawing a blank.
_______________________________
“I know, I know,” Steve agrees. “I think if only the Accords business had been going on things could have gone very differently. I would have listened to you, I swear. And I think you would have listened to me too.”
Looking at the raccoon, Tony says, “Honestly, at this exact second, I thought you were a Build-A-Bear.”
It’s something that has stayed unspoken for a long time and finally starts to whisper its way to life.
Maybe his failure was some sort of cosmic destiny he always had to fulfill.
“But there is another reason I haven’t visited him. The same reason I hadn’t talked to you about any of this and the reason I close up every time my therapist wants to talk about anything that has to do with the Decimation. I thought if I didn’t talk about it maybe it wouldn’t come true,” Steve confesses. “It seems illogical because it’s always been true but… If I didn’t say it maybe one day I’d wake up and everything would be back to normal.”
She signals to the chair across from where she was sitting and he sits down as she does so too. It leaves them one in front of the other but before they can start talking again a waiter comes by to ask them for their drink order.
Tony extended his hand towards Steve. “Well Steve, seems like we’re going on a double date.”
young, young in a way Tony hasn’t felt in years, if ever.
“She called me a couple of weeks ago,” Bruce explains. “She was thinking of settling with all the remaining Asgardians somewhere on the north of Europe because she said they couldn’t keep roaming around as wanderers from one planet to another forever and she knows how much Earth means to Thor.”
Tony’s eyes quickly move away from Steve’s own and Tony makes no attempts to hide the fact that his gaze is now focused on Steve’s lips. Unconsciously, Steve licks his lips as he swallows, feeling suddenly nervous and restless. Tony mirrors his movement twice and ends up with his bottom lip pulled between his teeth.
“I don’t know how we’re going to handle this but I need to go to HQ to see how badly things have hit us and to create a plan. I don’t know what’s going to happen to Stark Industries and it feels so wrong to say this because at this point there are a million more important things than a freaking company but-“
He sleeps.
Not everything they talk about during their walks is revealing or significant, it’s not even always serious. They’ve had more than one conversation about Steve’s loves for YA novels, Steve narrating the entire plot of them back to Tony. They’ve laughed way too many times at stupid jokes and puns by the lake. Other times they’ve reminisced together about some of the happy memories they share, reminding themselves that their acquaintanceship and friendship hasn’t constantly been marked by jabs and blows.
“Yes,” Bruce confirms as he nods his head. “I don’t know if he’ll come but… He knows.”
Death is the most permanent state there is in nature and Thanos made sure of that before he died.
The raccoon -and is it really the lack of oxygen? It has to be- shrugs. “Maybe I am.”
“I want to tell you,” Tony says, his voice shaking a little. “I do, I swear. But I’m… I’m scared.”
is, it’s all
The walk towards the outside feels like hours but Tony knows it really only takes seconds as he hears the ramp finally extend entirely.
Inside the shower the only sounds he can hear are the water cascading around him, the splashes his feet make as he moves and turns and his own breathing.
There’s only one possible answer Steve is able to give, anyway, and it’s the honest one.
Tony clears his throat to let Steve know he’s there and Steve’s shoulders tense immediately. He doesn't turn around, however. Tony doesn’t know if he prefers it this way or if he would rather have the opportunity to look Steve in the eye.
This is something Tony has always known. Or at least something Tony has known ever since he first became Iron Man.
With practice Tony also found that not always the more you repeat a lie the more you believe it.
Tony untangles himself from the sheets and the comforter and he swings his body to the side to stand up. His legs feel unsteady when he touches the floor with his feet and his knees almost buckle from his weight. He hasn’t eaten anything since the night before and this, combined with the quickness of his moves, makes his vision go dark from dizziness.
This is closer than they’ve been in months, even closer than the two times they have had sex this week, Tony thinks. It may not be objectively accurate but maybe it feels that way because this is definitely the closest they’ve been emotionally.
“Look, I know you’ve got your psychologist if you want to talk about any of this but just let me say one thing,” Rhodey pleads and Tony nods, gesturing at Rhodey to go on. “I think we all live with a little fear all of the time, especially after Thanos. But at the end of the day I guess it’s all about what makes you more scared: having him or not having him.”
He doesn't move for hours, staying in the same position for so long that his muscles start cramping and seizing. Then, when he can’t stand it any longer, he turns arounds, changes positions and stills again. FRIDAY tries calling to him more than once but Tony doesn't respond and she’s been with him long enough to grant him his space as long as she doesn't think he’s in any danger.
“This place is now ours,” Tony clarifies. “It’s in both our names. I want us to have it for when… For when we get time again, so that we can come back. Make some more perfect memories.”
Steve is standing in front of the sofa where Tony’s seated and it looks like he must just have come through the door. He’s wearing his thick, leather jacket and its shoulders look a little damp due to the light drizzling that has been going on outside for most of the day.
Tony’s hands start shaking and he can’t get over the shock of seeing Peter’s face once again, even if just in picture format.
“Miss Potts. Colonel Rhodes,” he greets somberly.
They’re both still learning, but as they spend more and more time together they’ve become better at reading the other, or at least these new versions of themselves that had grown and developed during the two years they hadn’t spent together at all.
“I want to apologize again.” Steve insisted. “I am so sorry about the hit and I hope it really didn’t hurt.”
There are 365 days in any given year, except if it is a leap one.
Tony shakes his head and exhales a chuckle, taking Steve’s mug with him.
Did he mean it? Is that how he truly feels deep down inside?
It’s good when Tony realizes that the persistence of Bruce and Natasha isn’t as needed anymore. Maybe it’s Clint and Thor lowering their defenses, or maybe it’s a little bit of the repetition hay-wiring their brains, but they start joining lunches and dinners even with Natasha away on Avengers business or Bruce on some volunteering trip, respectively.
Maybe it’s because he feels like if he says it enough times it will make up for the way he didn't believe it at first. Like this is the repentance he has to do for ever doubting Tony’s worth.
“I’m sorry,” Steve repeats his apology. “About the speech, about what I said. Natasha was right when she said I wasn’t thinking clearly. I know you think that too and you’re also right.”
The dream had ended pleasantly and slowly, unlike so many other dreams that find him ripped out of them before he’s ever ready to leave.
“Oh, I am?” Steve raises an eyebrow and Tony lets out a rough laugh. “Okay, I am.”
A year can be so short and it can be so long.
He’s become an expert at them now, selfies, and Tony always jokes that if there ever was to be a contest for best selfie-taker Steve would be proclaimed the winner by a landslide and that “not even those Kardashian-Jenners would have any chance at all against you, honey”.
Tony immediately understands and a short look in Rhodey’s direction tells Tony he does too.
His breathing takes a little way to regulate and his heart also needs a few minutes to resume beating at its normal pace, not at the wild staccato it had taken as he had woken up.
Natasha leaves for a while to retrieve her own tablet so she can work on composing emails and strategies while sitting next to him.
_______________________________
Steve’s face is the first thing Tony notices.
, Steve thinks.
In less than a second an intrusive thought slithers its way into Tony’s mind and kicks the air out of his lungs. The image of Peter disintegrating in his arms mixes with the image of Steve’s face dusting slowly as he looks up at Tony from his place laying on a dirty floor. Tony knows it isn't real but there is still the tiny part inside of him that feels the image as if it was. It’s like having his heart ripped out of his chest and Tony stands on wobbly knees from his place at the table.
Or perhaps not fate. Maybe the universe? Destiny? Life?
“Oh, Tony.”
“You’re right,” Steve confirms. “Thor still has a place with us and we need to try as best as we can to make him see that. I think he’d benefit from being back here with us, even if just for a while. But if things don’t work… Maybe it’s not such a good idea that you go alone.”
Steve doesn’t move his hand away but he lets Tony’s lower body down back into the mattress and he climbs back up the bed so he’s face to face with Tony again.
It feels like that night creates something special between himself, Pepper and Rhodey.
“I’m still scared,” Tony decides to confess, not willing to start this off hiding anything from Steve.
“Morning. Sorry I fell asleep on you last night,” Tony apologizes.
Steve points to the kitchen. “You take the pizzas to the living room and I’ll get some drinks and napkins.”
His depression is a part of him, Tony knows. He also knows by now that it doesn’t to have all parts of him.
In summary, he feels exhausted, depleted, frustrated and famished as he makes his way to the communal kitchen after taking a shower where he had to scrub his skin almost raw to get rid of the weird gooey orange substance the Doombots squirted this time around.
He snaps five or six shots before being completely satisfied with the end result and then he turns so that his back is against the glass windows, pressing the button on his phone that flips the camera to selfie mode.
The first sensation Tony feels upon waking up is warmth.
Natasha’s eyes sparkle as she nods at Tony’s words, knowing there’s going to be little resistance from Steve and Bruce if this is what she’s really committed to do.
“Boss, Captain Rogers.”
As soon as he gets there he sees that Natasha is already next to Steve and he can see Bruce arriving from the opposite hallway, looking scruffy and disheveled and Tony knows they’re mirrors of each other at the moment.
Tony wasn’t lying when he said Steve has as much claim to this place in his head as he does and if Steve isn't ready for Tony to be here yet he’ll leave, no matter how important he thinks tackling these issues together at the moment is.
Tony looks at her, at her clean face that shows the bags under her eyes and the soft lines of worry on her forehead, and asks her, “So you and the Doc…?”
Steve turns his head to the left to meet Tony’s eyes. He holds Tony’s gaze for around 5 seconds, as if trying to read something in them that Tony isn't sure he can project. Finally Steve moves his eyes way from Tony’s but only long enough so he can lay his body down next to Tony’s. As soon as he’s settled in his new position he captures Tony’s gaze again.
He hasn’t said much during the meal, Pepper and Natasha carrying most of the conversation while Steve intervenes here and there asking them questions.
The correct
There are some moments that don’t need to be captured on camera.
And the next moment he refutes his own comment, “And then I’d feel guilty for feeling that way because I was not there on vacation I was there chasing a guy that wanted to destroy our whole universe.”
“Why the whiplash?” Rhodey questions. “Is it your history? The Barnes thing, I mean.”
Tony scoffs and he whispers, “Yeah, maybe.”
more of Steve’s style).
They don’t say anything, the only audible sound their combined breaths, a little out of sync and a little too loud in the quietness of the room.
There’s still a tightness around his eyes, surrounding the wrinkles that mark the passing of time on Bruce’s face, but Tony knows what it’s like to be able to finally take some deep breathes even when everything isn't right in the world and he’s relieved to see Bruce finally letting go of some of his restraints.
Steve’s tenseness comes from the belligerent use of his last name.
Pepper’s eyes seem to focus and they move abruptly to his trapping him in the blue of her gaze. Her eyes are filled with sorrow and Steve can understand the feeling perfectly, being well-versed in it himself.
Tony has been looking at Steve in the past hour for longer that he’s done so in weeks but now he really focuses on him, trying to read in the tightness around his eyes, the lowered corners of his lips and the slight tremble of his fingers how best to proceed.
“Too cold? We can go back inside,” Steve proposes.
. Still, he’s thinner than he’s ever been before, stronger than during his teenage years but maybe leaner than he was. He has days where certain foods upset his stomach and he had to take up training on the Compound’s treadmills to build up his resistance again.
For the first time in the conversation Steve feels the familiar burn deep in his stomach that he’s come to associate with Tony.
Tony’s speech starts getting faster and faster, his words manic and slurred, a telltale sign of how his exhaustion is taking over.
Pepper takes him as her date to a Maria Stark Foundation gala and she walks him arm in arm around the room for the whole night. They chat with various politicians and shake more hands that Steve can count and sip from their champagne flutes as they watch various people take the stage and accept their awards.
_______________________________
1AM greets him as his eyes roam the ceiling above him, boring and dull but the only think he can keep his attention on. That’s probably the worst part about it. Sleep eludes him but wakefulness does too. 1AM means he’s somewhere in-between asleep and awake, some gray area of conscience where he can’t think clearly but he can’t turn off his brain.
While they all want to see Thor get better they’re afraid Bruce going to see him will actually have the opposite effect on Bruce. A simple glance shared between Steve, Natasha and Tony confirms they’re all sharing the same idea.
They stay like that, then, for several minutes. Just two men sharing a space but being farther apart that they have been in months. It’s heartbreaking for Tony, and he logically knows it must be pretty painful for Steve too. His own wounds left him unable to recognize pain in Steve last night but this morning, in the light of day, it’s easy to recognize it.
It’s scary, so terrifying to think Tony can do something to fuck this up.
Although that might not be the reason why the others are staring quite so intently, because Steve’s shirt is actually
still Captain America, even out of the suit. Even without the shield. That doesn’t mean you have to go charging back into battle. Not any single one of them,” Tony says and he wills Steve not to move his eyes away from his. He needs him to see, to understand that Tony means every single word of this.
Steve’s hands are cold against Tony’s cheeks.
“You look perfect.”
“Why me instead of Sam?” Steve wonders himself. “Why me instead of Bucky?”
It’s easier than breathing. Easier than trying to take a deep breath while he’s crying because his father has hit him once again. Easier than trying to make his lungs work as Jarvis’ coffin is lowered to the ground. Easier than trying to gulp down air as they pour water on a towel placed over his head in a desolate cave. Easier than pushing air through the reactor placed in his chest.
Rhodey groans, “Yeah, I guess I did.”
The look on Steve’s face and the way his eyes seem to sparkle after Tony’s response tells Tony that yes, Steve perfectly understood.
Natasha smiles at him and pats him on the small of his back, right above his butt, teasingly. “What are we having?” she asks as she peers over his shoulder.
That’s the word that does it for him.
For a while very few people ever saw him out of them and each time made him feel out of his depth, like he was giving away parts of his soul without permission. He only felt truly comfortable with Pepper, bare feet and honest smile, no armor or wall between them. When the break up happened, there was never a need to build up a barrier again and even through the fog of awkwardness in their interactions for weeks after, it always felt refreshing to spend time as he was and as he feared being seen.
Before the Army and Project Rebirth and Captain America, he had never had the opportunity to lead anyone or anything. He was too sickly for it and, honestly, no one ever gave him the time of day and no one would have ever trusted him to do a good job at it. His aspect was the only thing most people could see and Steve’s appearance before the serum didn’t particularly scream
A bomb has gone off inside him and he can’t stop the devastating effects of it except all the bomb has done is mess up with every single one of his emotions, tangling them up so thoroughly he’s not sure which one he’s feeling anymore. There’s no joy but there’s also no pain, there’s no sorrow or anger. There’s an emptiness in the mist of all the chaos and it’s both a relief and a warning sign.
Tony lifts his eyebrows and nods his head in a sign of silent encouragement.
But Tony’s a whole new world and proof of that is that Steve can now say he gets that reference thanks to a Disney marathon with Tony.
Looking at Peter’s face Tony realizes he doesn’t even know if Peter liked Christmas. Just one of the millions of things he’d make sure to learn if he ever had the chance again.
There is no real explanation for Tony’s obsession with wearing Steve’s clothes but Tony has found that it isn’t really a pressing matter anymore, that there are more important issues. Like, for example, figuring out how far he can go with fondling Steve in the kitchen before Barton starts screaming at them for public indecency.
Their love already defied the laws of death and oblivion once, Steve thinks, so it wouldn’t be a surprise if it transcends beyond them when they’re both long gone. Theirs is a love story for the ages. A miracle of life.
The morning after sees Tony up before Steve in a real turn of events.
Tony frowns at the idea but he’s learned to trust his gut so he separates his back from Steve’s bedroom door and starts walking with a destination in mind again.
The day the Avengers’ PR team releases a statement regarding the possible reversal of the snap -or more accurately the almost impossibility of that happening- Steve and Tony spend hours holed up in Tony’s workshop. They stay in silence for long periods of time and when they speak the conversation is at times stilted. Every word seems to drip remorse and Tony and Steve have so much going on in their own minds that it’s difficult for them to find the right words to comfort the other.
It’s about Steve.
Steve runs his hands up and down his thighs, a nervous habit of his that Tony still remembers. He turns his head towards his right shoulder and uses it to wipe away the wetness from his face, leaving his skin irritated by the force of the movement.
Clearing his throat, Tony withdraws the arm that was still placed on Steve’s back and scoots his body a little more to the left to create more space between his and Steve’s bodies just in time for Steve to straighten his back and turn around to face Tony.
With the hand that is not touching Tony’s body and without removing that one, Steve reaches into the pocket of his running shorts and retrieves his phone. Instead of verbalizing his answer Steve presses the button that lights up the screen and turns the phone around so Tony can look at the time himself.
Steve pauses for a moment and then he’s the one reaching for Tony’s hand. He intertwines their fingers and smiles.
As Steve reaches them, something inside Tony breaks and reshapes itself back together, making it easier and harder to think, easier and harder to breathe, easier and harder to live
He’s not conscious of having matched his breathing to the recording until JARVIS praises him for it with a soft, “Good, Captain. Keep going.”
Overwhelmed, Tony has to close his eyes as the ship starts to cross the atmosphere and, after only a few minutes of quiet darkness behind his eyelids, Tony starts to physically feel the ship losing velocity and descend.
Today the last is true, Tony
He takes pleasure in a job well done and he now finds it natural to guide people, to try and shape them into the best version of themselves they can be. He knows he’s not perfect at it but he’s grown to find pleasure in knowing his voice is heard after so many years of going ignored.
It hurts, this being together but not being together, this having her back but not deserving to.
“You were trying to get out of that rematch tomorrow because you know you will lose again.”
“Most people didn’t,” Miss Potts states.
He turns his face up towards the Moon as he feels tears gather into his eyes.
Tony’s still confused but he takes Steve’s had without any trace of hesitation and lets himself be pulled to his feet. As soon as Tony’s standing Steve drops his hand but the movement isn’t rushed or abrupt, it lingers and soothes, like Steve’s not really letting go, just guiding him along in other ways.
JARVIS’ voice when it comes agitates Steve like it always does.
“I don’t know,” Tony confesses. “I have absolutely no idea. You think I don’t ask myself that every day? Why am I here? Why not Peter? Why is it me instead of him?”
he thinks.
He says it as if he still had any trace of hope in him.
“Much better,” Tony honestly replies. “Still not perfect but ready to try some solid food again.”
He drums the fingers of his left hand against his thigh and tries to stay awake by singing several AC/CD songs to himself. He gets through “You Shook Me All Night Long” but loses track of things around the second verse of “Cold Hearted Man”.
But neither of them showed up again in any public spaces around the Compound so Steve and Tony had to fend for themselves.
Tony Stark over Iron Man.
but the first thing he tells him after two years of absolutely no communication between them isn’t his name.
He wakes up gasping and panting and sometimes even crying. He wakes up wishing he had never gone to sleep and he wakes up wishing he had never woken up.
The rise and fall of his chest must tell Pepper he’s still awake because after half an hour of silence Pepper whispers his name in the dark.
Tony Stark may not be alive but Pepper Potts and James Rhodes are making sure that his memory never dies.
Steve’s eyes focus on Tony’s chest and a smirk appears on his lips, “Well, the shirt does look good on you.”
He’s trying to sound angry still but the corners of his mouth are tugging upwards.
Natasha wipes away the tears that have fallen from her eyes even though new ones keep rolling down her cheeks.
Steve knows he’s laying down on his own bed at the Tower, he’s even got his eyes open to remind himself, but his brain refuses to really believe it. He’s gasping for air and fighting himself. He knows reality, he knows what’s real, but something inside him rejects it no matter how much he tries.
“I know,” Pepper confirms. “I love you, too.”
Steve can’t say life gets back to normal after that because the old normal used to mean not having Tony with them, but little by little they all start building a new normal together.
Tony, with his own issues. Tony, with his own share of past trauma. Tony, who the few times he interacted with Steve when he was alive never failed to challenge him. Tony, who had been part of something so much greater just like Steve.
His legs dangle off the table and with the index finger of his right hand Tony beckons Steve closer.
The door of the workshop opens for them without them having to touch it and then closes behind them as soon as they step outside. This proves FRIDAY has been keeping an eye on them the whole evening even if she hasn't interjected at any time.
Steve stays silent but he nods again. Pepper sighs and that compels Steve to finally look at her. She’s wearing a sad smile on her face and her eyes aren’t focused on Steve. She’s looking towards the left and her eyes seem a little lost on some imprecise point of the restaurant.
Other times trying to explain their situation is too difficult, Tony has noticed. He doesn't blame the rest of the world for not going through their same ordeals and he would never want them to have to, but it’s complicated to explain how he feels and what he’s going through to someone that has never had to experience any of it.
It’s watching the world come to terms with the situation just as Tony has had to watch Steve come to terms with it. Just like he has to come to terms with it himself.
But no matter what, Bruce and him don’t stop working.
Tony decides to turn his body to try and get a glimpse behind him when just turning his head does nothing to help. He moves very slowly and carefully, first turning his waist and then getting his legs to follow. Finally he rotates his shoulders to rest his weight on the left one instead of on the right. When he stops moving he finds himself in the exact same position he was in before only this time facing in the opposite direction.
Tony presses his thumb harder into Steve’s lips, cutting him off.
Steve is the first one to pull away, bringing his spoon towards his chest as if protecting it from assault.
Before leaving the room he takes a deep burgundy robe to pull over his thin pajamas and he sets course towards the living room.
But it’s also heart-wrenching. It’s one of those unexpected reminders of what the Decimation did that hide under beds, in tight corners, behind curtains and in plain sight. They're always there, those reminders, but sometimes they’re easy to miss because they’ve become part of every day life.
It’s not even ten at night yet so Tony knows it’s futile to really try to fall asleep but he closes his eyes as Pepper gently whispers, “FRIDAY, lights out”.
With those words -just those 12 words- Tony is sure he has most likely broken a part of Steve’s soul that will never be put back together again.
“I shouldn’t have snapped,” Tony apologizes.
They saw him at lunchtime when they had ordered a couple of pizzas and he’d joined them in the living room for a while wolfing down a couple of slices. He’d left as soon as he’d been done eating and Tony is immensely thankful that Steve is so attuned to him and his need to spend some one-on-one time with Rhodey.
“Okay,” Steve says, prolonging the word in a way he’s picked up from Tony.
He moves his hand away and only then realizes Steve’s eyes had been completely focused on his finger and, for some reason, this only serves to anger him more, having Steve’s complete attention when he didn’t have it in the moments he needed it most.
This is not how it’s supposed to be like. If there’s a light this isn’t supposed to be how it feels. He fell asleep and the light was supposed to take him but he’s now awake.
“I’m sorry.”
Their legacies as men and their legacies as heroes.
“None taken,” Steve laughs. “It's not something I could have predicted myself.”
It wouldn’t be as obvious as it is for Tony if he hadn’t grown completely attuned to everything that Steve is, but he can spot the second the fight leaves Steve’s body. It isn’t outright noticeable. It doesn’t change the posture of his body or the tone of his voice. It’s something else, it’s somewhere else.
It’s accompanying Steve to support group a few times, hesitant -because he would never want to infringe on Steve’s private spaces, but touched when Steve tells him he wants him there.
As soon as he’s made sure he won’t be causing a scene or disturbing anything, he presses down onto the arc reactor in the middle of his chest and the suit starts assembling around him.
Bruce’s comment is followed by his hand pointing at the t-shirt Steve is wearing and when the soldier looks at it and sees what Bruce means his reaction is one of genuine surprise. He turns red, the blush traveling all the way down his neck (and his torso as well, Tony knows without having to see it) and sputters non-sense for a while before closing his mouth and pressing his lips together, closing his eyes as if surrendering to his fate.
Steve’s steps get louder and louder as he gets closer to Tony. Tony opens his eyes just in time to see Steve crunching down so he’s eye-level with him. Steve leans forward and rests his elbows on the edge of the mattress as he looks Tony in the eye.
“I help you find help,” Tony states, motioning to himself and then to Steve. “And you help me find help.” This time Tony points first to Steve and then to himself. “How does that sound?”
“Tony.”
“You said what you thought would make people happy without stopping for a minute to think if it was true,” Tony disagrees.
Natasha bids her goodnight the earliest and she leaves for her room after planting a kiss on each of the men’s foreheads.
That’s what happens with the Avengers as Steve moves into Stark Tower even when the restoration works are still in progress.
“You can’t feel guilty about this. I know how much you work every day to change the way things are. I know how much it means to you,” Steve says. “This isn’t your fault. If…If we can’t reverse the snap… If we can’t fix the Decimation… I won’t let you think you failed at this.”
“Yes, you. The change you’ve shown since Tony’s been back,” she explains. “I mean, you’ve changed since the Battle of New York and it’s obvious that you needed time to settle after waking up and finding that everything you knew was different. But now, since Tony’s return it’s like you’re… I don’t know how to explain it.”
“Steve,” Tony whispers back.
It’s not a big declaration, or a heartfelt confession, or a passionate speech. It’s smaller, simpler, more real. Real in the way their love is.
“Here you go,” Tony says softly, depositing the mug next to Steve’s head.
“You’re proud of me?”
They bond greatly over art, something Pepper is very well-versed in and something Steve hasn’t been able to focus on in a very long time. He tells her about the time when he dreamt he would maybe dedicate his life to it, go to art school in Brooklyn and soak in all the knowledge he could. She takes him to museums and little art galleries very few people seem to know of but she donates to often. She encourages him when he tells her he’s thinking of signing up to some courses and hugs him when he gifts her a portrait of her for her birthday.
“I also promised to show you Europe and I’ve only shown you some of it,” Tony says, evoking a promise tacitly made, a promise he’s taken to heart just to make Steve as happy as possible. “We’re missing Vienna and Prague. We need to go to Poland and even further north to Norway and Sweden. It’ll be nice to have a home base here and I want it to be this. This right here. This can be home, too.”
“Where is he now?,” Tony asks before he’s even aware of the words leaving his mouth. “Where?”
They both laughed and Bucky stood from the bed, clapping his hands loudly.
Steve nods but his face still shows uncertainty.
“To be fair, I don’t think Bruce and I understand half of what is going on around us when we’re working.”
“Okay, wait,” Tony demands. “I don’t know if it’s me that’s having trouble processing this information or if it’s you doing an awful job at explaining it so, please, please, just… Can you tell me everything?
Four.
“You never really talk about it,” Tony states. “You never really talk about Bucky.”
“Hey,” Steve greets him. “Good morning.”
“Just call me when you can so we can set up a time to meet,” Miss Potts requests. “Please.”
He wants them there because this anger and this hurt and this disappointment and this sadness, they’re all familiar. They’ve been living within him for years, unwelcome guests in his mind, guests that sometimes sleep by his side every night and sometimes don’t visit for days at a time.
Clues? Coordinates? How is Tony supposed to know? And if he did know, doesn’t Steve think that would be the kind of thing Tony would share from the get-go?
“From what I can tell, that was already your third cup of coffee.” Damn spies and their spy-senses. “You’re not going to have a fourth one, Tony. Go to bed before Steve has to drag you himself.”
It’s Pepper catching him working on Avengers’ projects and becoming so silent it leaves him feeling uncomfortable even as she walks out of the room. It’s Pepper trying to ask him about Peter and Tony instantly wishing he had a Scotch glass in hand.
Tony stays silent but Natasha knows her words have not been in vain.
“I feel like I’m dying, everything hurts.” He rubs his eyes with his fists and blinks a couple of times to clear his vision and he swears he caught a glimpse of a fond smile painting Natasha’s lips. “Don’t even think of making a joke about my age.”
“I just wanted to say that Rhodey, I mean Colonel Rhodes, is coming tonight to have dinner with me and I was wondering if you would like to join us,” she asks.
he muses as some old footage of Pepper and Tony dancing at a charity function plays on the TV.
Thank you once again for the support and the love this story is receiving.
He’s smiling when he says, “Not yet.”
“I—” he stumbles over his answer. “I want you to do what you want to do.”
Tony sighs dramatically as he pats Steve’s cheek. “I guess you’ll just have to grow it again so I can see it.”
Bucky once again repeated “Damn Wilson” under his breath making Steve shake his head at him.
The stars blink back at him and Tony selfishly imagines they’re shining just for him and the thought shames him so much he has to rip his gaze away from them.
Tony’s gaze is solely focused on him now and he’s wearing a somber expression, like Steve’s answer to this silly question is worth a lot more that Steve can even imagine.
“What’s wrong?” Tony scoffs. “Everything’s fucking wrong, Rogers.”
Steve’s not shouting, he hasn’t even raised his voice above a normal tone of conversation, but Tony can hears his voice clearly and perfectly. Maybe if there had been any other sounds he wouldn’t have been able to but the Compound is eerily silent these days, especially at night, when Tony sometimes swears he can hear everyone’s breaths as they try to futilely fall asleep because that’s a thing they all perfectly share nowadays, the crippling insomnia.
“Tony,” he starts, his voice low, not needing to sound louder in order to be heard in the silence of nature. “How are you feeling?”
His eyes are trained forward on some indistinctive point across the lake where a slight breeze rattles the leaves of some trees. His attention is trying to memorize Peter’s face as it smiled at him in his latest dream and simultaneously trying to erase any and every image of it.
When they get there the room’s door is open and Steve walks inside first.
“If you’ve had a bad day maybe it’s just best for both of us,” Steve insists.
Steve visibly relaxes and goes back to sitting in his chair. He grabs the spoon Tony was using and places it inside the now empty ice cream container, next to his own.
Tony doesn’t hesitate before continuing his ministrations and he pinches Steve’s nipples between his index fingers and thumbs. He rolls Steve’s nipples a few times, tugging at them every few seconds. Steve’s hips have started moving against his and it’s clear it’s an instinctive move on Steve’s part.
Sliding the notification from the text away from the screen Steve finds himself staring at Tony’s lock-screen.
The door is closed and Tony turns his back to it, trying to rest casually against it. His air of nonchalance doesn't appear to fool Steve, however, who doesn't comment on it but does raise an inquisitive eyebrow.
But since Siberia and finding out the truth about his parents’ death -
“How are you?” Natasha asks, her voice small. “How’s Thor?”
“Well, hello,” Tony says and although Steve can’t see his face he knows his expression must be one of confusion.
Bruce swallows the long sip of water he had taken before responding. “The experiment is a little personal. Maybe a little unorthodox.”
He also doesn’t need to think much about his answer to this question.
“Ready?” Steve asks him and Tony starts walking towards the living room doors that lead to the outside as a response.
Looking at Steve feels like an oasis. Laying with him and just remaining there basking in the moment feels a little bit like freedom.
“The rest of the Aven—,” Steve hesitates. “The rest of the group and me.”
“Go to bed, Nat,” Tony tells her. “You can keep helping the world tomorrow.”
The folder, of course, is simply named “TONY”.
He’s under no delusions of this being a reversible thing and it’s not even like it’s something he’s hoping for. This is permanent and this is what he wants, truly, but this being permanent means this is what he’ll have to learn to live with. Pepper and their relationship was the one thing he had been able to hold on to after the snap and now even that is gone.
The characters on screen are going through some kind of race when Clint speaks.
_______________________________
Over an hour has passed but to Tony it could have been a minute or it could have been a year.
Bruce laughs again, twice in less than a minute, and it dawns on Tony how much lighter Bruce appears. It somehow shows in the way he’s carrying himself, in the way his shoulders have seemed to drop the weight they had been carrying for so many years.
“You mean about the break up, right?” Tony enquires, wanting to make sure that’s what Steve really is asking.
“What are you implying with that tone, Romanoff?”
Natasha sips at her wine absentmindedly as she stands, her hips cocked and one of her elbows resting behind her on the marble counter. To almost anyone else in the world it could look like Natasha is trying to avoid answering Tony’s previous question but Tony knows better. She is definitely bracing to answer it as honestly as possible. That takes courage, that takes patience. That takes Natasha a little bit of time.
Tossing and turning. Tossing and turning.
Like Steve said, as long as it's a mutual thing, Tony can live with it.
(It’s slow and it’s distressing for them both, opening themselves up, but they do it. They learn to trust each other and to share the burden of their grief. Neither is good at following advice but they make an effort.
By the time he’s stepping out into clear air for the first time in over 20 days Nebula is the one supporting his weight entirely and he feels a burst of energy corse through his veins as the cool night air slams into his face.
Tony’s shoulders drop and he brings his hands up to his eyes, rubbing them harshly with his fists. Steve removes his hands from their place on the table’s edge so he can move them towards Tony’s own hands. Steve delicately wraps his bigger hands around Tony’s, moving them away from Tony’s face and intertwining their fingers.
Rhodey doesn’t say a word the whole time he’s speaking, just hums and nods along and sometimes squeezes Tony’s hand when he can feel him drifting off and disappearing into the confines of his own mind.
“I’m sorry if that was inappropriate and if I overstepped but I just… I just…” Steve takes a deep breathe and opens his eyes, focusing his gaze somewhere over Tony’s shoulder. “I want to help. I want to help you, Tony. And I want us to be okay. I know that’s an utopia because this is not something we can just be okay with but we deserve to at least not feel this bad.”
There have been no resurrections, no come backs, no reunions or rebirths. The people that were gone are still gone and no miracles loom in the horizon waiting to be performed.
“I just—” Steve starts, crossing his arms again but this time making it seem like a defense mechanism, an armor instead of a weapon. “I thought we were past this. I thought we had the kind of relationship were you could talk to me about things. Things about me and things about you. Things you need to figure out.”
He’s not ready to let go of Pepper but he needs to feel Rhodey, to know he’s not just imagining this. He moves one of his hands and extends it towards his best friend who doesn’t hesitate to grab it and intertwine their fingers.
“That was the other day,” Tony says while chewing on the food making Steve pull a mildly disgusted face at him. “Today I wanted to watch something else. Keep up, Buttercup.”
Tony hasn't recovered by the time he leaves the room so he doesn’t have time to answer who’s ever spoken to Rocket about him.
“I don’t need to yell to let you know I’m angry,” Tony replies.
“Rhodey,” Natasha says, almost chocked up. “Thank you.”
“How’s Pepper doing?” she asks.
He turns it around and his breath catches in his throat.
Inhale and clench fists.
“Today was great, Mr. Stark.”
A few times, no words have even been needed as they’ve just shared the time with each other. It’s helped them clear their heads and it’s served as a comfort and a distraction for both.
“Bruce,” Natasha responds in kind, but before she can say anything else Bruce abruptly turns around and heads down the hallway he came from.
“Three hours?” The beat fastens. “Four?” His friend doesn’t stop and Tony can feel in his bones the moment she completely wins the battle. “Fine, fine! I’ll go to sleep and I won’t wake up until the next giant octopus attack. Happy?”
Since then he’s only been abroad when he was picking up all kinds of SHIELD ops and the same kind of problem arose: no time to enjoy the different countries he’d been stationed in, no desire to walk aimlessly through streets that reminded him he was in a strange world he hadn’t yet grown accustomed to, no people he felt close enough to to ask them to accompany him.
Steve lowers his gaze and hopes the warmth he can feel in his cheeks hasn't transformed into a blush that is too visible.
“You did?” Tony asks and his voice sounds a little disbelieving and a little bit wonderment.
This, whatever
Tony chuckles. “He was not subtle at all. I didn’t even have to dig deep to find out who he was and it still baffles me that more people didn’t find out about him.”
Steve promptly realizes where Tony’s eyes are focused and he admits, “Oh, yeah. We, um… We went after Thanos.”
“You promised those people we’re going to bring everyone back!” It bursts out of Tony in the form of a shout and he is so overwhelmed his eyes close and his jaw tightens in rage.
They’re outdoors and yet if feels like Steve’s words are sucking the air out of the world. No one seems to be breathing, too enthralled and connected to Steve to do anything but hang to his every word. For Tony it’s always felt like Steve can command a room simply by walking into it so it’s no surprise that everyone else feels like that too.
“I love you,” is all that Tony can think to say.
He walks to the left side of the bed and reaches under his pillow to retrieve his pajamas. He changes into them as Pepper leaves the phone back where it had first been and walks into the bathroom, leaving the door ajar as she starts brushing her teeth.
He sounds groggy and disoriented and his question makes Tony move away from Steve quickly as if he had just been scolded for it. It’s a reflex, an instinct, and Tony immediately feels a flash of guilt. He isn’t sure if it comes from how close to Steve he had been or from how fast he’s moved away from him.
Heartbroken.
Pepper living in the Tower and managing Avengers’ business means Steve gets to see her quite regularly but they both make an effort to not make all the time they spend together be related to work.
He knows what he wants the answer to be. He also knows what he thinks the answer should be.
“What?”
She shakes her head. “I should have known. It’s not like we’ve had a lot of time to pick things up. It just felt nice to think that maybe this was the one thing we would get to keep.”
“Are you sure?” Tony asks her, because it’s really the only question he can ask.
“Steve!” Tony calls and it makes Steve stop midway to grabbing the bottle.
“You don’t,” Tony states but his face still shows confusion.
Enraged.
The sentence is phrased like a question but Tony isn’t sure if he’s making sure that is Steve’s desire or is he is asking for permission.
A slight pressure is applied to Tony’s left hand and he recognizes Pepper’s touch instantly.
“Great!” Clint yelled excitedly.
The lights brighten lightly and Tony sits up in bed rubbing at his eyes and stretching.
Steve closes his eyes and focuses completely on his breathing and he lets JARVIS’ comments and words guide him back towards shore.
She’s there making coffee when Tony walks in and when she turns around to face him the bags under her eyes are more pronounced that Tony has ever seen them. Her eyes look glossy and the redness under her nose gives away just how much she’s been crying.
It’s not something to worry about, at least not for Steve, who has now vowed to himself that he will make it work. It was only the first try and there are tons more to perfect it.
Steve’s and Tony’s breathes have synced up in their position. In and out and in again.
“You think that I wore Steve’s clothes on purpose?” Tony wonders. “I have enough clothes that are mine, thank you very much.”
He flies it around Steve and performs a demonstration for every single one of the added features it has and they both are excited to try sparring as Rhodey wears it. It’s thrilling and a fun challenge to Steve, who even gets to use the shield.
“I know, Rhodey, believe me, I know,” she says.
“Happy New Year,” Natasha whispers.
“Can you hold it or should I bring it over or…?,” he softly asks.
“I don’t know if you were already showing this side of yourself to Pepper and Rhodey but you definitely weren’t showing it to us,” Natasha continues. “You’re finally being open with the rest of the world. You’re letting us see who you really are.”
This time Steve does laugh out-loud and hearing his own laugh echo around the scarce bedroom in the safe house makes his chest ache and his hands itch with the need to hold Tony. He’s been gone for longer than this more than once before but each time Steve finds it harder and harder. He was able to live without Tony for more than 30 years but maybe it’s because of how long that time was that now he feels incapable of spending a minute away from him without feeling like he is missing a limb.
“I was afraid for you and selfishly for me too. I was afraid for Bucky. I was confused and I took the easy way out. At the time it would have been more difficult to talk things through and face the situation head on so I ignored it, that’s what I did. Like it would disappear and stop being a problem if I didn’t speak of it.”
Tony captures Steve’s bottom lip between his and gives it a sweet tug before letting it go before pecking Steve’s lips once, twice, three times and then separating.
“But,” Steve rushes to say. “I promise that’s all over. I’m done avoiding you, or Pepper or Rhodey.”
For him, it’s all about home.
Steve’s palms start to sweat and his breath catches in his chest.
As soon as he’s got both arms into the garment Tony grips the coat’s lapels and tugs so that it covers his chest and his neck properly, and then zips it up all the way to the top.
When he opens his eyes again JARVIS has brightened the room a bit, not to the lights’ full extent but enough that Steve now feels more comfortable. He looks around his bedroom and takes inventory of a few of the items in it. It helps with focusing his mind again and while he can’t completely forget it numbs the memory of what he’s gone through a little.
“Come with me?” he asks.
He was never that close to Clint himself back when the Avengers were still the Avengers. In fact, out of all the original members Clint was definitely the one Tony had had less of a bond with.
Tony’s 48th birthday falls on a Friday and the Avengers, enlisting Pepper’s and Rhodey’s help, have been planning it for the past month. There’s not a single thing that has been left to chance:  the venue is booked, the catering services too, the DJ already has their playlist preferences, the invitations have been sent out and Natasha has been helping everyone pick out their presents for Tony because she didn’t trust them by themselves.
“I opted out,” Steve replies, a small and rueful smile on his face.
It feels like fate is testing them.
Steve turns his body so it faces Tony completely, but he leaves the separation that there is between them and Tony is grateful for it.
Before Tony can complain, however, Steve’s hands move to the buttons on Tony’s shirt and Tony quickly gets with the program and helps Steve undress him. He’s quickly down to his underwear and Tony would mourn the loss of a sensual stripping down if it wasn’t for the fact that he knows he’ll have time for that another time.
“Hi, Tony,” Steve greets back.
Steve chin lowers as he tries to hide the small smile he’s sporting.
“No,” Bruce rejects. “We can’t let him think he’s losing someone else.”
Steve stood in front of the mirror and adjusted his black hat over his blond hair. He nodded to himself when he was pleased with his appearance and, despite his initial reluctance, he started to grow excited at the idea of a fun, mindless game with his over-competitive friends.
Instead, they all move towards the living room and Tony receives a few gifts from them even though he had told them he didn't want them to get him anything. They’re not outrageous gifts but they’re all thoughtful and personal and Tony cherishes them as he has cherished every single true gift he has ever received in his life. There have been a lot fewer of them than a lot of people might think.
Steve’s quiet voice surprises Tony and he gives a light startle. It really doesn’t count as Steve talking to him directly because the comment was mostly spoken into the air but it’s more than Tony has gotten in weeks and it makes him feel eager for more, even if it’s just scraps of a feeling, crumbs of a connection.
“You can take the next one,” Steve says, squeezing Tony’s hand once, twice, three times.
“I don’t know,” Steve says. “I’m not sure what it was that I felt back then. I think I did start falling for him when he was gone but it wasn't as real as it is now. I’m gone on him, Pepper.”
It starts chaste, only a brush, a caress.
He goes to Romanoff because he knows she is the only one who knew Stark before and because, for some weird reason, Steve knows she’s the one most likely to always tell him the truth and to speak to him as an equal.
“I just want to finally talk, Tony. To try and make things right,” Steve insists. “Please.”
Tony’s heart stops in his chest.
in case any of you need or want to talk, be it to vent or if you're interested in thinking about something else. We can talk about Stony, Marvel, TV Shows, books, food, etc! Really, I'm here for you, my friends.
Bruce goes silent and the other three of them are looking intently at him but not saying anything, just watching their friend struggle pretty visibly.
FRIDAY wakes Tony up really early in the morning or really late at night, depending on how you look at it.
He curses himself internally, hating how vulnerable he feels. The drag of the day has left him more exposed than he normally would allow himself to be, even with Steve.  In a way, it feels liberating to sense emotions other than the suffocating sadness he was feeling only a few minutes ago. Incredulity and outrageousness are easier to handle, more explosive towards the outside world than towards himself.
“I guess you’ll have to make it back for that rematch and see,” he replies.
“Okay,” Tony concedes. “Okay, Steve.”
Tony’s voice sounds combative and it’s a relief that he doesn’t have to work for it. The anger, the hurt, the disappointment, the sadness…; they’re all there, and Tony wouldn’t be strong enough to call upon them if they weren’t already floating to the surface.
“I love you,” is what he ends up saying when they separate.
One of her hands finally reaches towards him, her left hand making its way to Tony’s face. The touch is so gentle and light, her fingertips grazing the entirety of his face, from his forehead to his eyelids and down the slope of his cheeks to his chapped lips.
Tony wakes up to a full-out screaming match between Natasha and Clint. Tony has never seen Natasha raise her voice so much even if he has seen her raging in anger and quaking with fear. He can’t make out her words from behind his closed bedroom door but she sounds desperate and on edge.
“Are you sure it is a definite no?” Tony asks her. He’s well too acquainted with ending things that aren't meant to be over.
Today, though, when Tony proposed they watch
_______________________________
It’s the way they’ve been for a while,
Tony chuckles and maybe it’s a trick of the light but from his position Steve thinks his cheeks redden slightly.
Steve will never forget the first time he encountered JARVIS, before he and Tony ever got together, and how he amazed he was at the fact that Tony had been able to create a person from a machine. Because that’s what JARVIS is, no matter how many people would dispute that fact. JARVIS is a person that Tony programmed, made real, gave freedom to learn and evolve and expand.
“But really,” Steve says. “I know no one would expect this answer from me but my favorite part of the shows was the little kids. I felt so useless doing that stupid tour but the kids… They made me feel important. They were always so enthusiastic.”
Steve’s voice breaks and his eyes fill with tears. He loosens his grip on one of Tony’s hand so he can pull his hand away to rub at his eyes with it. He wipes both his under-eyes with his ring finger and then dries his finger on his sweatpants.
Before Tony can even utter his disbelief at the hour and inquire as to why she woke him up, FRIDAY answers the unasked question and Tony starts wondering if his AI has also developed some sort of mind reading power and if that is the case, he probably should be feeling more worried about it.
