Stupid Steve.  And stupid Bruce, for thinking that the super-heavy elixir might actually be of use.  Sure, Steve wasn’t in
Steve shrugged unapologetically.  Then he said, “You’d think Iron Man would have better things to do than rescue his teammates.”
.”  Tony nudged Steve’s foot with his own, then danced back a pace, careful to avoid a retaliatory swipe that did not come.  “Let’s go.
“Is it not in your nature to share knowledge?” added Anij.  “To tell those who allow you to drift among the stars what treasures you find?”
“They are our brothers and sisters,” Stovok reminded quietly, fiercely.  “It is within us to speak to them, to show our capacity for mercy, to—”
Where Marker was almost clumsy on the ground, he was lightning in the air.  No one, not even Iron Man, could catch him.
Letting his eyelids slide shut, leaving his hand where it was, Tony dared to believe that maybe, just maybe, they could be a family, after all.
Tony stared at the bracelet for a moment, then closed his fingers around it, leaving his hand in Steve’s open palm for a moment.  “You know I can deactivate these remotely.”
Tony scrunched up his nose.  “Nobody says that,” he muttered, regaining his usual confidence as he strode in the direction of the open-door bakery, trailed by Clint, licking his chops, and Bruce, wringing his hands.
.  His breathing quickened.  He reached out, gripping Cap’s sleeve, unaware that he was even doing it before he was
Steve ignored him, licking his thumb again and trying to scrub off the marker print.  Tony caught his hand and insisted, “It’s for your own good.  You will lose all respect as a leader if you don’t make good on it.”
.  He shrugged, feeling exposed, stuffing his journal back into his pocket.  “Didn’t see the point,” he defended lamely.
“Pinch did the trick,” Tony lied, a headache low in the base of his neck.  “And since when did you become an optimist?”
“My super-massive-spy-skills.”  Clint squeezed past him and leaped onto the bed.  Natasha pinioned him with lightning-speed—Steve blinked and missed the attack, only catching Clint’s yelp as he found himself trapped between her legs.  Then Clint laughed, breathy but unafraid, like a hyena caught between a lion’s teeth.  Natasha held him for barely a second, then released him, but Clint stayed where he was, asking in a wheedling tone, “How come
Tony grumbled, “Fun-sucker,” and leaned his shoulder against Steve’s briefly.  Then he pushed off and sauntered back to the car, brandishing the keys.  “For a super-soldier, your situational awareness is
“Then no,” Steve said simply.  “And for God’s sake.”  He took the Pepsi away and set it on a high shelf.  “
“If I knew, I’d tell you,” Steve replied truthfully.  Thor nodded in acknowledgment, releasing him.  “I’ll look into it,” he offered, pulling out his journal and jotting down,
over to its rightful owners,” Pierce growled.  The lack of geniality was thick; Pierce's blue eyes were nearly black as he stared at the unyielding face of his newest challenger, who looked back just as malevolently.
Steve pulled back to look at him.  It was hard to look at him; ashen gray, bandages wrapped around his throat.  He looked like a corpse.  Yet he breathed steadily, asked evenly, “What for?”
Steve had to leave, just so he would not disrupt it, so he would not get in the way of Tony finding something, anything, in the mind raging against itself.  Leaning against the wall, bad knee a strong hurt—nothing to do with the brain, there, just muscle and bone and the miracle of changing barometers—Steve listened to it go on, and on, and on, waiting for a scream, a yelp, a shout of terror, some animal sound that would signal the end.
“Good bird,” Tony told the last one, silently wishing Kevin was just another cybernetic alien he really could take a whack at.  At least S.I. was doing everything that it could to take down the beast.
Steve could not shake off the question a second time.  He shrugged, trying to dissuade Tony’s attention,
“That’s really the sticking point.”  Tony dug his feet into the grass.  “That, and the four years of training.”  Looking around, Tony said, “I think we deserve a reward for this one, Stovok.”
Ten minutes and one phone call later, a slightly out-of-breath zoo employee met them at the gate, opening it manually with a slight screech of metal.  “Come on in,” the employee greeted.  “Hope you don’t mind walking and talking.  We start to wrap up operations at five o’clock on the dot, most days.”
,” Tony snapped, giving him a shove of his own, flat onto his back.  It horrified him that Stovok went with it.  Vulcans were a prideful people.  A shiver of dread raced down his spine.  “Stay
Clint hopped over Tony, bounced to the showroom floor, and bolted.  Steve ground his teeth.  “Let him run,” Tony insisted.  “Maybe he’ll burn off some of that energy.”  After a decidedly long moment, Tony shimmied out of the truck and landed on the showroom floor.  Then he clapped a hand on Bruce’s shoulder.  Startled, Bruce ripped the pamphlet in his hands in ‘twain.  “It’s fine,” Tony said, stuffing the ripped pieces into a pocket.  “Don’t worry about it.”
, very contained about it, but Steve noticed the looseness in his shoulders.  The Tony Stark that walked into the bar had surreptitiously walked out, well before Natasha finally conceded, “Well, if I’m driving tomorrow, then I’m leaving now.”  She stood with a kiss to Steve’s cheek that came out of nowhere and made him flush more than it should have, and a pinch to Tony’s shoulder that made him grimace.  “Be good.”
“Knowing you, Stark, I would assume it to be none of these things,” Thor rebutted lightly.  “You should come to my hearth,” Thor insisted suddenly, laying a palm flat on the table, “and I will have my finest cooks prepare you a meal.  You all are such starved creatures.”  He stacked another plate on an already precarious six-plate pile, then shook his head.  “It is like attending to starving dogs.  Eat,” he insisted, putting the berry bowl in front of Bruce, who dutifully reached up and plucked one off without looking up from his book.  “A warrior must upkeep his strength.”
For a few moments, the whole world seemed to slow down, until it finally synced up with the measurable rhythm of Steve’s breath.  Slowly, daringly, Tony began to shimmy upward.  He felt Steve’s hands bracing him, first around the hips, then the outer legs, finally gripping him by his ankles as Tony gasped and clawed at the edge of the opening.
Steve was right, of course—Marker’s hide, unlike Snow’s, bore short spikes, too stubby to grip.  Flying with him required ropes and a strong grip, under the best of times.
Bruce, at least, seemed relieved at the newfound breathing room, while Clint had been surfing the radio for the better part of an hour.
,” Tony said, following the convoluted logic easily.  The Nibirans below were making ground, so he began walking backwards, one hand on the grooved stone.  “Stovok—this planet appears fully compatible with Earth biology.”
want to be noticed as he hurried across the floor and disappeared into his own room.  Well—at least the Big Greenie was not out today, Steve thought.  One saving grace.  “We’d’ve saved you some, but since you were so busy getting some—”
Moreover, with just 30,000 permanent residents, Juneau had a theoretically ghostly population density of around 10 people per square mile.  In reality, the majority of Juneau’s residents huddled together, creating their very own small town.
“Can I post this on my Facebook?” ice cream man interjected, emptying a second jar of sprinkles onto Clint’s ice cream bowl without sign of intermission.  “It’s super good for business.  Celebrity endorsements.  We’re a young startup, you know.”
What's next? It's a surprise. 🐼❤️ Don't worry, the gang will reunite! And thank you very much for the support; it really does mean the world!
Sneering, Tony turned away, flopping back towards the window, the rain.  Steve said politely, “It’s a good name.”  Rico sniffed around Tony’s back.  Steve moved forward to reclaim the cat.
From a hundred different directions, the glacier crackled, respiring with the thready breaths of a frozen river.  A steady wind blew throughout the cavern, providing welcome airflow, while an unfrozen river trickled past their feet, smoothing over and around swaths of rounded pebbles.  It was nail-biting, downstairs: not merely another cold room, but a cold so filling it could be cupped in one’s hands and drunk, like water.  While the rounded pebbles were gray and black, every dripping inch of ice was ethereal blue.
“I know more than well to hold my drink,” Thor placated, slightly louder but still composed, a gentle giant’s smile on his face.  He offered the flask to Bruce, who stared at it with owlish eyes.
Lured by the commotion, the bloodhounds came running.  “Jeremiah!  Ezekiel!  Get back here!” Coleman shouted from the opposite end of the orchard.
By 0900 hours, he was off to the proverbial races.  With parting head pats to the Griffons, Steve dutifully endured a three-hour-long tour of the nation’s capital, including a walkthrough of the Smithsonian Museum and a visit to the World War II Memorial.
To Steve’s relief, Tony let out a raucous laugh, easing some of the doubt coiled in Steve’s shoulders.
He went through the winding blue maze, hyper-aware of his exposure.  The tired travelers around him were looking anywhere but at each other, but he had the strong impression that at any moment, he could be spotted.  He was jumping out of his skin with impatience by the time he reached the front desk and asked in a friendly but assertive voice, “Now, all I need from you is a ticket to New York, can you do that or can you not?”
Once, when he had been very young—so young he could not recall the exact year—Steve Rogers had met the dinosaurs.
The staffers seemed torn between insisting he come down immediately and allowing the god to carry on, as Thor’s sonorous voice filled the marble hall.
Tellurium remained where she was, looking out at the sea, but Thallium hopped up onto the couch and slipped under Tony’s new cotton wing, huddling close to his chest.
“I gathered that,” Coleman said with a nod.  He stood.  Both bloodhounds stood with him.  “Aye—you kids be good,” he warned, as they padded around Steve, sniffing hopefully.  Steve just dropped a hand onto the nearest one’s head, patting it.  “Dogs.  Trouble at the best of times.”
The scene faded abruptly.  Tony blinked, surprised, and did not have time to collect his own person, seated on a bench, before Stovok stood, paced towards the far window.  He stared out into empty space mutely.
Then Admiral Fury said dryly, “Perhaps next time, Stark will write for flying monkeys.  Might shave off some time from our rescue.”
with his pencil.  He wondered if it was exhausting, being aware of so many problems, if that was why Tony turned off the radio, protecting him from the twenty-first century.
,” Thor greeted, the warmth in his tone lifting some of Steve’s own hunger-induced angst.  “I had not thought to see you again.”  He extended a hand.
The concussion had already worn off by the time Clint finished buying him an apology sandwich, ignoring Steve’s insistent claims that he neither wanted nor needed an apology sandwich, and they did not have time for sandwiches because they were supposed to be on a grab-and-go mission, besides.  Clint said, “There’s always time for Cuban sandwiches,” and pulled out a bag of Secret Agent Supply-related goodies.
Clint knocked on Steve’s window.  Steve pressed a little button to roll it down.  The miracle of modern technology.  “. . . Yes?”
.  This isn’t a book.”  He threw it on the floor, picked up a tablet, pulled up a blank holographic screen to play with.  “A book is—concrete, dead, an account.  This is a
“I think it’s an Earthworld,” Tony said excitedly.  “Class M, definitely, but—humanoid, common linguistic phonology, Bruce, we could name a
“No,” Tony grunted, resisting the weight pushing down on his shoulders.  Terrible, terrible person.  She had drugged him.  She must have.  With her . . . horrible, mind control, powers.  That was it.  “Him.  Talk.  One minute.”
Shaking his head, Steve looked up as their waiter returned with a single slice of toast and a side of margarine.  “Let me know if you need anything else,” she said sweetly.
“Provisional officers traditionally sign up for six-month contracts,” Carter said.  “You have been with us for nearly two years.”
“Not about deserve,” Tony said.  Bruce looked at him, hopeful and sad and bitter.  “Not about deserve,” he repeated.
Tony pivoted back to interrogate him, but Steve interjected, “Toss me another one’a those sparklers, would ya?”  Natasha obliged.
Tony had no idea what ‘the mark of the Gorn,’ was, but from the way Thor gestured furiously at his upper own arm, he realized it must have been literal.
Tony did not know how long he fought the Gorn.  But he felt Stovok’s hand on his shirt, dragging him abruptly away from three of the Gorn and clunk-clunk
“This better not be some kinda fossil joke,” Steve acknowledged, back to his original seat behind Tony, while Bruce sat behind Clint.  Thor had agreed to meet them at their destination, which worried Steve, but—well, he
faster, there was no way Clint could win in a dead heat—but Clint, through moxie alone, tagged first base, half a second before Steve tagged him with the tennis ball.
“I shall,” Thor, son of Odin, peacekeeper of the Hirogens, said cheerfully.  “’Til our paths next cross, prey.”
“I did think it was a bit unusual,” Tony admitted at last, “that you’d end up in The Bad Place.  Captain
—it meant something, but when Steve Rogers said it, Tony knew it was true, because Steve Rogers had taken the shot in the dark to become Captain America.
Her jaw came to rest on his shoulder, heavier than a hay barrel.  He almost buckled, back straining to support the weight.  “I gotcha, I gotcha,” he chanted.  “I gotcha.”
Steve approached the green monster and held out his arms in a peaceful gesture.  “See?  I’m right here.”
“God, damn, that’s a cake,” Tony acknowledged, stepping around the corner without his suit, Lucky yelping joyfully in the great distance.
Tony relaxed a little, unconsciously afraid he would have to struggle through an explanation, but there was something in those two words that allayed it.  The need to even try.  “Thank you.”
Tony had no sooner taken a seat at the table then the merry band of Starfleet voyagers arrived.  Still dressed in their spacesuits, they stood out only in stature.  “Who leads this community?” Liaison Hill asked authoritatively.
“Little lukewarm, dear,” Iron Man critiqued, one leg jaunted over the other in the director’s chair.  “Is this the
“Hippies are all about flower power,” Tony said suddenly, pushing himself to his feet.  “Peace in our time.  Make love, not war.”  At Steve’s expression, he added, “I didn’t invent them,” with a self-absolving shrug.  “Oh, and, uh, dams.  Too many dams.”
relationship with touch.  Giving it was dangerous, but receiving it was much, much worse.  Even Steve knew to tread carefully.  But Tony did not flinch from him: the morning light was soft, and Steve’s hand was steady near his waist, and Tony trusted him.  “I’m pretty sure you’d find a way to be attractive then, too.”
, this is what I don’t want, and I’m too selfish to chase myself off.”  He tried to push halfheartedly at Steve’s side, but Steve held on.  “Who is this damn scared of losing something they already have?”
The egg timer had just gone off when Steve reached the bottom of the stairs, telling Rico, “All right, don’t fuss, I’m here.”
“It is well,” Thor assured, returning with improbable speed from the little convenience store with a handful of rope.  “I shall secure Smoked One to the rooftop.”
Steve firmed his jaw, like he wanted to keep arguing about the integrity of baking cookies, but then, with a sigh, said simply, “Okay.”
He knew he was suffering.  He already knew it.  He just wanted space to let his wounds cauterize themselves.
When the Ba’ku stood silent, Thor frowned and took a seat.  He turned to Romanova, whose poker face was implacable, and said, “This doesn’t usually happen.”  With a deep sigh, he waved a hand and said loudly, “
.  Steve kept his mouth shut.  Two days ago, he was fighting aliens.  He felt he had earned a little peace.
“And we shall climb the High Mountains,” Thor decreed, one arm perched heavily across the branch of Steve’s shoulders.  “To Himinbjörg.  They shall write songs about us.”
With a shudder of revulsion, he thought about how lucky and unlucky he was, not to simply be a beating heart in a box, harvested by the glorious future.
Then Bruce shuffled into their little half-circle.  “I don’t—I don’t like storms,” he said carefully.  “I—”
.  The medicos skirted around the simple truth of the matter, but Tony knew it anyway: the dragon had broken his back.
Tony tried to ask, “Stovok,” but Stovok gave him a meaningful shove and a spear embedded itself directly between them.  “Got it,” he redirected, and bolted headlong after Dr. Banner.
Having learned absolutely nothing from the experience, Tony chucked his other shoe at Steve.  Steve repeated the toss.
“You risk it all for just one,” Steve mused, looking out at the water.  “Yet you lose so many.  I still don’t know what happened to. . . .”
“You know what?  I’m glad we went with the Hell Hole,” Tony said, sitting in the back of the truck with Bruce, who was snoring on his own shoulder, and Steve, who was sitting across from him, sipping on a milkshake.  “This ain’t bad.”
Weirdly enough, he did not blame the dragon.  He blamed himself, for making a suit that could not handle the impact and venturing into dragon territory.  If tame dragons could accidentally hospitalize their companions, what feral ones could do to humans they saw as prey was beyond contemplating.  And that was all he was, that was as far as the adversity went:
“When Snow left,” Tony rasped, his voice breathless, his battered body resisting the exertion, “how did you survive?”
, like he was not confident he would be welcome in this space, but if he brought water, hell, he could stay
“That’s great, buddy,” Tony said, sensing an opportunity as he stepped forward and grabbed Bruce’s arms.
Steve resisted the urge to cover his ears.  Clint seemed to enjoy it, bobbing his head to the beat—one of the beats, as there seemed to be at least twenty.  “This is
Sitting top-down in the Audi, Tony offered Thallium a vanilla ice cream cone.  Thallium chomped down on it, not deterred by its cold texture.  Dragons were hardier than humans and smarter than humans.  Even their relationships with humans expressed complexity, ranging from warm to standoffish.
to do is avoid another open war between the Klingons and the Federation,” Carter retorted.  “If it comes at the cost of two officers—so be it.”
The blast felt less like a punch and more like a splash of boiling water.  Steve dropped and rolled in the concrete like it was snow, too shocked to cry out, focused totally on dousing the heat.  Iron Man said breathlessly, “
“If you’re gonna learn,” Natasha said, handing Steve the keys to the car, “there’s no better place.”
Tony searched for days for Radon the Second, who had also vanished in the night.  Unlike Curium and Iodine, R2D2 had not resurfaced.
“It feels like homeworld,” Stovok said softly.  He shifted a hand from his own thigh to brush against the blades, using the back of it to avoid the sensitive fingertips.  “It’s . . . sharp.”
“Tony?  Tony, are you hurt?” Steve asked urgently.  He had had the arc reactor removed years ago, but the artificial sternum still bothered him, and if—
The humanoid alien offered a hand.  Tony reflexively shook it.  The Nibirans hooted and the presumable elder struck him across the face with a growl.  Tony barely had time to process the sharp pain of it before the Nibiran elder grasped him in a skeletal hand and directed him towards the huddle.  He collapsed on his knees next to Stovok, reaching out automatically to feel for his pulse—appearances didn’t matter, he was
Tony made a sudden punched-out sound, then spun around so he was facing the far side of the field.  “What,” Steve demanded, and before he knew it, he had three laughing baboons on his hands.  Well.  Steve was pretty sure Bruce was laughing out of fear of being excluded, but Clint was cackling loudly in pure enjoyment, and Tony, try though he might, could not suppress the giggling fit that overcame him.
Half the nest was gone: only green Thallium, bronze Tellurium, indigo Indium, blue Actinium, red Curium, and yellow Radon-2 remained.
After a moment, he clicked his light off.  “Stick to the posted speed limits.  Avengers,” the cop said.  And he returned to his car.
“Suit yourself.”  Steve shimmied further down, calling down below, “Ey, watch where you’re pointing those flashlights!”
Steve glared at him.  Tony held his gaze passively, then reached suddenly into his pocket, pulling out Steve’s journal.  “Dropped that.”
was a gift from S.H.I.E.L.D., which was an odd and unsettling thought that went right back into the box labeled
“Allow us to finish,” Sojef entreated, one hand resting over Anij’s for comfort.  Tony waved impatiently, then stood up, pacing the room.  Sojef went on: “Earth had just endured a terrible war, and still, we saw the rise of Terra Prime.  We knew that another conflict—perhaps even interstellar in nature—was only a matter of time.”
“Tell him he needs a cut,” Tony called out, sitting on the pavement and sifting through the bag, now with Clint’s help.  It appeared to be full of Steve’s clothes.  He chose not to be irked about it; it was not like he had any privacy in the army, and all of his clothes were S.H.I.E.L.D. appointed, anyway.
Tony nodded, shifting one step closer, leaning into Steve’s shoulder.  “We do,” he said.  “We give them a good one.”
—but Tony could not decide what flavor of malevolence was most present before, with indifference, Cap added, “It belongs on Asgard.”  Thor cuffed Cap on the shoulder, giving him a huge, jovial shake.
Steve wondered, patting the cat once on the head.  Golden eyes looked up at him, and it occurred to him that the resemblance was uncanny.
Steve ignored him, continuing his ascent until Tony was forced to back out so he could finish the climb.  Tony did not let Steve push himself to his feet before collapsing on top of him, both arms wrapped around his neck.  Steve huffed in exasperation or amusement, Tony could not tell, and stood anyway, forcing Tony to let go.  Then Steve held out a metal bracelet.  “You dropped this,” he said politely.  “Didn’t think anybody would find it, but—can’t be too careful.”
Steve thought, glancing halfheartedly down at a white placard and startling when he noticed, out of the corner of his eye, a
He pulled himself back from it, watching as Tony sketched: “The neural network is like a superhighway system,” Tony said.  “Habits are like roads, formed and deformed over time.  You can almost see their presence in the folding of the brain. . . .”  And on he went.
“Don’t goddamn interrupt me, this is for the well-being of civilization,” Iron Man ordered.  “Now.  The point is, we’re all going to live inside Iron Man suits for the rest of our lives.  That’s it.  No more adult fun times, we are all going to—I’m not done,” he protested, as Steve forcibly dragged him out of frame.  “They’re going to love the sanitation pitch, it’s—really gross.  That reminds me, I might have peed.  Can we take five?”
“It is nice you’re doing this,” Steve said at last.  Tony looked at him, an almost defensive anger in his eyes, like Steve was making fun of him.  “No, I mean—for them.”  He waved vaguely at Clint, who was still valiantly deflowering the entire orchard, it seemed, and Bruce, who had hidden himself in a tree.  “I think that it’s—very unselfish of you.”
“Nothing’s wrong with my bike,” Steve insisted, teetering on the edge of real anger.  Reeling himself in, he shook Tony’s hand off and said, “Thor—”
, the possessive as natural as every article attached to his own name—standing in the middle distance, hugging the wall in his black uniform, like a gargoyle presiding over the cards of the mortal masses beneath him.  He was smart to stand back, Steve thought numbly, as the Tony in front of him, fully ten years younger than his grim huddling successor, went from pale-faced, white-wheeling-terror to eyes-rolling-back unconsciousness.
,” Tony insisted, crowding him.  Bruce fled towards down the opposite end of the hall.  Tony followed, hot on his heels.
Tony said nothing, staring at the cat.  Steve could see the multitude of emotions spinning behind those genius eyes, even as Tony’s jaw firmed quickly in unmistakable scorn.  “
He could not bear to shut his eyes, to not see the danger coming, so he stared at the space in front of him, watching Steve creep into his periphery.  There were no bloodstains on the floor, no massive red flags waving in the wind, begging for a quick fix.  A bleed could be stemmed.  But this—there was nothing for
“Came to the right place,” Coleman said.  “Good place to get away.”  He looked around, surveying his land.  “Good place.”  A warm breeze washed over them.  It was terribly comfortable; Steve envied the man’s calm place in the world.  Then Coleman said softly: “You’re him.  Aren’t you?”
He felt tempted to sit on the rocks and let himself have his fill for a while, at least until he could settle in his mind the precise shade of blue above him, but the others were already moving on, Natasha’s back disappearing into a fissure broad enough to walk sideways through.
Barton said, “Finally.  We got some real beef on board.”  Stovok sighed audibly behind his own mask.  Tony could have sworn Romanova smirked as she replied:
“Twenty-six.  Hey, same as you,” Tony said, ribbing Steve and balancing his checkbook on a barrel.  “Bruce, you want anything?”  Bruce backed away from the nearest shelf so hastily he bumped into the next-nearest shelf rather violently.  “All right, just the pies and the bird.”
,” Tony complained, still chewing.  “Do you even know the Heimlich?  I’m gonna die.”  He swallowed hard, then sighed, “False alarm.”
Nodding once, Steve said, “It’s not all bad,” and then offered a parting pat to Ezekiel’s—or was it Jeremiah’s?—head.  “I’ll be seein’ ya.”
“Actually, Iron Man has nothing better to do,” Iron Man replied, sauntering over, blocking the city with his own metal back.
—Tony would never have guessed the waterworks.  Just as a teardrop was about to drip off his nose, Steve dabbed it with the back of his sleeve.  “You
A superstitious part of him worried that even learning the basics might impair his chances of successfully going home, as if he really would start to look like a futurian and act like one if he spent too much time reading all about how things
He stalked across the bridge, ignoring Barton and Romanova and their pristine contracts, nearly smashing the elevator button.
—”  Swinging himself to his feet—and privately congratulating Pepper’s superior interior designing skills for saving his life—Tony stormed around the couch, grabbed the severed broomstick, and whacked Steve on the head with it,
After maybe twenty minutes of comfortable walking, not quite at spearpoint but not quite free to break formation, Tony mused, “Always wanted to take a romantic walk in the woods before being ritually sacrificed in a volcano.”
as Tony claimed his spot beside the king.  “Everybody shut up,” he ordered, reaching out for the tiny telephone held in Thor’s outstretched hand.
Kneeling next to him, Steve leaned over Tony Stark’s mouth and nose, but there was no warm waft of air.  Steve's blood ran cold.  He
He had to choke back the same feeling of creeping terror as Tony Stark looked at him with the same wide eyes, as if he had been fatally shot without a mark on him, and then the glowing blue reactor went dark.
“This,” Steve said seriously, grabbing Smokey on the way up and handing him back to Thor, “this is why we have reveille.  A
The floor creaked when they stepped inside, but the rest of the interior was eerily quiet.  It had also been tidied up, erasing all traces of their presence.  Immediately, Steve knew that Natasha was gone.
Steve shouted back grimly, “I figured that.”  He moved back towards the car, the monster that could probably rip him in ‘twain, and announced, “Fine.  I won’t leave.”
It took Steve longer than it should have to scowl at them, but there was a smirk on Tony’s lips and a relaxation in Clint’s shoulders that told him maybe he was all right, after all.
To his surprise, Natasha answered.  He looked at her for a long moment, mentally shuffling his impression of her to include the blonde hair—a part of him suspected that she was a natural brunette, just to spite them—before looking pointedly over her shoulder, at the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent sitting on the made bed.
A loud knock came on the door.  Steve looked over at Natasha, who looked back at him expectantly, cradling her own mug of coffee.  The knocking continued.
“I mean, he’s alive,” Dr. Banner said weakly, leaning away from their fearless leader as Tony glared at their nighttime visitors, chatting and crunching audibly on what sounded like either fleshy coconuts or animal bone in the near distance.  They had migrated close, started up a roaring fire, even kindled the beginnings of a
Eyes on the road and hands on the wheel, Steve refused to let his past feelings for Chicago set the stage for future disappointment.  He had already been disappointed by New York.  Every change felt like a childhood monument, torn down and replaced with something ugly.  Even if the original had been ugly, the loss of it stung, a cultural touchstone eroded by time.  The idea that he might lose the memory of Chicago, too, made something twist in his gut.  “What’s in Chicago?” he finally asked, half-hoping the answer would be
“Sir, I must inform you that this volume is considered damaging to human hearing for any duration,” the radio interrupted in a calm British tone.
.  He’ll heal,” he told J.A.R.V.I.S., who stood passively nearby, judging him with the judgment of a thousand WEBMD articles on head trauma.  Hooking both arms around Steve’s available arm, Tony dragged him around the corner, then puffed, “Will you

“Highly improbable,” Stovok deadpanned, scanning the environment.  He abruptly paused, back to Tony, and said calmly, “There.  On the mountain.”
“Am I not invited?” never-one-to-be-left-out-for-long asked, slowing his pace to walk on Thor’s other side.  “Quid pro quo—I did bring you here.”
“Are you okay?” the monster asked, naïve as ever, believing there was such a thing as a normal Tuesday in Tony Stark’s body.  There was, once, and then, through the power of aging and alcoholism, there were fewer episodes.  Now, he could not define where the pain was supposed to end.  The pain felt inextricably intertwined with him, like a bramble threaded into his very bones.  The thought of others yanking on the edges to see where they were embedded made him want to scream in frustration.
He moved slower than he used to, slower still without the cane, but he kept pace with her as she padded down the hall.  He even slid the glass door open for her.

, of course.”  He tried valiantly to suppress a smile at the tiny, almost grim smirk Stovok gave, adding to save himself, “I would never associate with a recreational spelunker.”
He got Tony on the floor, aware that his poor bastard of a doppelganger was going to have hell to pay with S.H.I.E.L.D. for insubordination and not giving a
“FAH!” Thor scoffed, stalking over in his blue-gray armor.  The children shrieked and dispersed; the Hirogen tackled the Vulcan to the dirt, and the children, sensing no danger, reconverged, piling on top of the Hirogen in fits of giggles.  Seemingly unaware of his human cargo, Thor stood and began dragging Stovok by the foot back towards the ship.  Stovok actually rolled his eyes, but he did allow Thor to drag him off, perhaps on the grounds of peacekeeping.
being punishe—”  Then he paused, composed himself.  His expression went blank.  Holding himself at his fullest height, a robotic aura of calm settled over him.  Tony felt a shiver walk down his spine.  To Alexander Pierce alone, he asked softly, “Save the city—get a demotion?”
“No,” Tony said.  “No, who told you that?  I’m going to punch them in the face.”  Feeling emboldened by Stovok’s lack of resistance, Tony grasped him by both sides of his face, felt the mixture of mixed emotions, like paint splatter on a canvas, red for heat, blue for intrigue, yellow for invitation—and risked pressing a smacking kiss against his cheek.
“Not a bad intuition,” Steve allotted, glancing at the card, memorizing the number, and offering it back.  Hill wordlessly took it.  “As you were.  Commander.”
By 0430, he was off to raise the flag at the White House.  When Steve demurred that they had far worthier recipients, the organizers insisted that: “To one man or woman, it is a great honor.  But to the nation, bearing witness, this will be living history.”
Poor kids from Brooklyn did not have much opportunity to get up close and personal with the celestial.
Tony waved a hand ambivalently, looking more tired than angry, approaching the far side of the room.  “That’s a view.  Not bad.  Not bad at all. . . .”
.  The Gorn scampered off the ship at a skipping bunny-hop that reminded Tony of old footage of Moonwalkers.  He laughed in spite of himself, even as Stovok flushed green on his cheekbones.  “As I was saying—”
Steve stared at him.  He had a dinosaur puzzle on the carpet in front of him that was three-fourths complete.  Bruce immediately folded onto the floor in front of him with a thankful sigh.
“What’s there to tell?” Steve replied, abruptly closing the box and storing it with the others.  “It worked.”
Maybe Tony was stark raving mad and Clint was little better and Bruce, alone, chose to go along for the ride—but Steve chose to walk back.
—”  He thrashed in furious terror as Stovok grabbed him by the wrist, careful not to touch his bare skin, and began dragging him back towards the cave.  “Ha-ha-hang on a se-se-s-second, pointy, this isn’t—”
Tony winced at the proffered hand.  “I don’t—do, handshakes,” he huffed, as Thor pulled him into a firm embrace.  “Okay.  Okay.  Thank you,” he wheezed.  Thor released him.  He staggered back.  Steve steadied him with a hand on his back, but Tony waved a hand, moving back to the car.
,” Barton complained, but he did as Tony asked, angling the vessel into an almost vertiginous drop.  “H-A-W-K-E—”
Natasha arched both eyebrows.  “If I hadn’t,” she said, “and you had stood there and listened, what would you have thought?”
Hulk snorted again, then smashed his fist against the car again.  “I said I won’t leave!” Steve shouted.
Natasha squeezed his arm briefly, then let go.  A paranoid part of him wondered if it was a signal—maybe Clint was in trouble, or Tony was hiding a wound, or, God forbid, something was mangling Bruce.
“Are you sure?” Barton asked gravely.  “You know the survival rate for Klingon hostages is less than six hours.  It’s been twelve since we left the
Dragons were of the Earth and yet, somehow, inexplicably, beyond it.  What troubled humanity never seemed to worry dragons.  Dragons had somewhere to go, After.  Dragons were prepared to fight, tooth and claw, for survival, yet they passed gently into the night.
.  And I’m stuck six flight-hours away in a crowded airport, barely able to raise a signal, never mind fly into New York, and you’ve gone ghost.  After the biggest historical event of the century.”
Aside from the refrigerated rooms in Tony’s sprawling estate, there was little hint of it, outside.  The southern coast of California rarely saw snowfall, unlike the mountainous terrain in Utah.  Only Actinium preferred the sandy shore.  Even Thallium, who followed Tony most places, retreated to spend time with Marker or Snow after short exposure to the sun.
Tony lowered the bear spray cannister with a conspicuous rattle.  “Oh, come on, I’ve always wanted to try it,” Tony whispered, as a black bear snuffled at the trail, not ten yards ahead of them.  “Does poison ivy grow in Alaska?” he asked, staring intently at a bush.
One of the Nibirans passed him a coconut-shaped object.  Tony’s growling stomach warred with his scientific mind.  Consumable materials were so rarely compatible among different races that alien delicacies were considered the gems of the consumer market.  Life loved to experience all that the universe had to offer, but few things were more incompatible than digestive systems.  Hell, even Vulcans refused Terran foods, and they could practically suck nutrients out of
It hurt a lot to scrape his chest over the rock, but then he was halfway out, his torso in the open air.  Some indelicate maneuvering and he twisted and fell on his side, gasping sharply.  He hunched in on himself for a moment, wounded, gripping his chest over the scar tissue of the long-gone reactor.
“It’s not my birthday,” Steve reminded Tony, once they had stepped out of range.  “Or Christmas.”  Then he frowned.  “It’s not Christmas, is it?”
“That’s a scorched Earth if I’ve ever seen one,” Tony submitted, staring at the enormous space rock, red-hot and deeply wounded.
“When you say it like that,” he began softly, but he was out of breath, out of arguments, out of paltry lies.  He wanted to writhe with it, frustration, indignation.  A part of him wanted Steve to hurt.
“What—”  Steve removed the bucket, let it fall to the ground noisily, turning to look at him.  “What
“This is Kevin,” Iron Man said, holding up a two-by-four demonstratively.  “We all hate Kevin.”  He made a
Steve did not add himself to the scene, tucking the book back into his pocket.  Then he simply drew in a water-laced breath and enjoyed the view.
,” he added, using the shirt off his back to tie Clint’s hand to the safety railing.  Then he took off at a dead sprint down the adjacent path.
The tips of Stovok’s ears were very green, but he flexed his feet thoughtfully against the grass, something rigid in his expression softening.
, he thought giddily.  He startled when Steve skidded into view, looking at them all—mother of dragons, hatchlings, and Tony—before exhaling hard.
“I don’t know,” he said, hearing the fretful air in his own voice, the anxiety for home that could not be placated.
“Uh-huh.  Sea, food, seafood,” Tony agreed skeptically, laying out the third shuffled deck.  “Don’t take it personally, I wouldn’t expect a fossil to—”  There was an unsubtle kicking-of-shins sound, followed by a wheeze from their resident comedian.  “I wouldn’t expect a fossil to get it,” Tony finished adamantly, glaring at Natasha.  “Final warning, one more time and I’m filing a compl—
going to—oh my God,” Tony said, pushing down Steve’s shield arm, which surprised Steve enough that he let him.  “Can we be gentle-ladies about this and talk?”
He struggled upright.  Steve did not try to stop him, deter him from having the conversation with a statement like
The gas gauge—handy, that; old cars used to make drivers guess how much gas was left—was still solidly above the “E for Empty” line, but it was nice to get out, stretch his legs, put some miles back onto the meter.
“Definitely not,” Tony agreed, reaching out.  It was tempting, but decorum pressed him to grip Stovok’s covered wrist.  Stovok did the same for him.  “You’re a crazy sonuvabitch.”
“I’ll have the formal writeup sent to your PADDs,” Carter said calmly.  “Lieutenant Romanova and Ensign Barton will accompany you.”
Steve did not hide his hand, because he had no inkling about what the game was actually about.  Tony made a, “Hm,” sound, then looked expectantly around the table.  Without a word, he reached into his pocket, pulled out his wallet, and set it on the table.
, a steaming hot, freshly brewed espresso, in my hand, in the next ten minutes, or I will make my own cadaver.”  After a beat, Tony added, almost politely, “And a pair of shoes wouldn’t go awry, either, there’s a hole in mine.”
“Chest compressions,” his Tony repeated urgently, still speaking only to him, confiding what seemed like a terrible secret, planting Steve’s other hand firmly over the first, interlocking them, right over the arc.  “Brain damage sets in in less than four minutes.  It’s been over two, Steve,
, Tony Stark, who famously holed himself up in his lab and refused to be bothered on his most special day, had remarked once.
“Yes,” Tony said.  “See?  Same team,” he added, appealing to Steve’s better nature with a thwack to his aproned chest.  “Where did you
“. . . We asked the kid how he had located you.  You should be grateful he’s a fan of your work, Stark.  He recognized the distinct curvative of the transponder signal and saw a proof of the theoretical passageway documented by
They had already searched the museum’s top floor, as well as two “modern art” exhibitions that Steve would have liked to have spent more time with, before arriving at the ground floor, where Thor was holding court.
“Monkeys?” Thor, a huge security officer who was one of the few Hirogens who did not hunt humans for sport, intruded.  “I do not understand—”
“I don’t need it,” Steve deterred, looking around, feeling like he was back on stage, reading a script, judged for every missed word.  “I’m—”  It would be untrue to say,
Tony caught up to him, dragged him into a staircase.  Steve dug both hands into his own hair.  “Hey,” his Tony urged, ashen-faced under the mask, rattled but steady as he squeezed Steve's forearms.  “Look at me.  I’m okay.”  Steve looked, looked at him even though he had to swallow again, words he dared not say, did not have the right to say after smashing the shield on his back into that very reactor with real intent.  “I’m okay,” Tony repeated, like
Steve lost time tripping over a tree root, tumbling and rolling out of the fall in the same movement.  Ahead, a gaggle of horrified tourists watched Thor’s progress.
With Thallium dozing on his chest, Tony watched Marker, who gazed back at him.  Indium sniffed around the fire, his chest splashed indigo in the firelight.  Then red Curium pranced over and tackled his brother.  They snapped and clicked at each other, like a pair of flashlights flicking on and off.  Thallium sat up to watch but declined to join the brawl.  When Indy finally pinned Curie, Marker clicked, firecracker loud, and both small dragons separated and scampered off.
Running on exactly one hour of shut-eye, Steve still did not absorb the meaning of Clint’s words for three seconds.  Then he flushed red, went through eight or nine immediate responses, and finally stormed over to Thor, sat down on the couch, and huffed out a wordless sound of annoyance.
“I try to be.”  Still wearing that hooded, almost happy but mostly peaceful expression, Steve said, “Got somebody to be sweet to.  Makes a difference.”
A mixture of pride and guilt swamped Steve.  Pride, that he had neutralized the enemy—and guilt, that he had hurt somebody, regardless of loyalty.  Happy was red-faced but silent, gripping his arm above the broken appendage and looking like he wanted to strangle Steve with the one hand left to him.
Narrative side note, "Roscoe" is an OC concierge--his job is to pull strings and make things happen for a wealthy client like Tony Stark. I always find Tony's billionaire status to be a particularly fascinating facet of his lifestyle, and during my research, I kept coming across the man-behind-the-curtain of the ultra-wealthy class. "Roscoe" won't take a bullet for Tony, but he will find the doughnuts Tony really likes and have them shipped across the country to his doorstep at two a.m., for a really heavy room service fee.
It reminded Steve, incongruously, of his first and last encounter with a bear trap—the breathless, blistering pain crushing his leg had forced him to choose quickly,
On he went.  Steve tried to absorb it all, but his brain kept tripping over its own tape files, rerunning certain clips.
“Hope not,” Chief Security Officer Rhodes said beside him.  “Because last time, you lost one of my best men and the ship’s second-in-command.”
Iron Man turned on her.  Steve stepped forward, almost instinctively shoving himself into the fray as Iron Man surged forward, closing the distance so he could jab a finger at the both of them and
The heat of it drew the ache out of Tony’s bones.  Marker’s presence, quiet and almost uncertain as it was, drew an ache out of his soul.  The golden dragon had made his way indoors and curled up in the far corner, watching him intently.  Tony could feel the questions in those black eyes, but he offered no answers.  He cast no blame, either, although a part of him wanted to.
Clint pushed back his chair and reclaimed his takeout with a triumphant little laugh.  They all watched him cackle maniacally to himself as he abandoned the room, slamming the bedroom door shut behind him.
A choked laugh escaped Steve, barely a huff of breath.  No, no, they were not trying to be his enemy.  But they were hunting him down.  He swung around, unable to keep his back to them, but it was just Natasha and Hill.  He wanted to ask if he tore down the wall, how many agents would be snooping behind it.
As he sliced up some tomatoes, Steve could not help but think about how much it filled their home, despite how little they talked about it.  Maybe it was because Tony had always been the talkative one.
With the tactfulness of a bull elephant, Steve announced, “You’ve been in a coma for four months.”  Tony reeled.  He was glad he was already lying down.  Steve asked with the sort of frank compassion characteristic of his time as Leader of the Avengers, “You want a glass of water?”
replied, gun in his coat but confrontational manner still beginning to draw nervous attention from the rest of the room.  “Step away please.”
“Dams,” Tony repeated seriously.  “Write that down, it’s a whole—thing.  Got a bit dam-happy.  Ruined more than the salmon runs.  We’re working on it.  Kind of.”
“We must find shelter,” Stovok said, voice drained of emotion but on the edge of tension.  “At once.”
Tony’s expression was bleak, yet his tone was indifferent as he said, “Certain . . . inherent risks.  Closed, open loop, it all hinges on—”
“Guy’s gotta eat,” Steve said, shrugging self-consciously.  He had always had an offbeat relationship with food—for most of his life, it had been the one point of envy that he could not shake, the yearning in his gut that entreated his humble lifestyle for more.  His Ma’s cooking had always been comforting to him, but he had preferred the company more than the food.  “What’s your favorite?” he asked suddenly, putting distance between himself and the memory by directing his attention at Tony.
While Steve stood back and watched in stoic resignation, Tony picked up the ingredients and poured them into the bowl, indicating, “See, the beautiful thing about cookies is, you don’t have to be perfect to be
Steve Rogers paused audibly, not breathing or speaking, before resuming both: “I just want to make sure you’re okay,” he said softly.
Lincoln Park and Wrigley Field are clearly both celebrated Chicago locations/attractions (can't speak on "Lou's" or "Adler" yet, as those are spoilers, but Google is free and I won't stop you, haha!), but did you know there really is a Secret Agent Supply Store in Chicago? Check out "The Wicker Park Secret Agent Supply Co." if you're curious!
That was the real kicker, he thought, genuinely annoyed that he could not report to his pesky fellow man that Hell had, in fact, frozen over.)  Mostly hungry.  Why had he died on an empty stomach?
Steve managed to persuade Tony through sheer force of will not to be sick.  Then he confronted a more serious problem.  “Tony, there’s no beds,” he seethed, realizing belatedly that all three bedroom doors were firmly shut.  “You’ll just have to sleep on the floor.”
No matter: Tony took another scalding gulp of coffee, then scrubbed his bloodshot eyes with a hand.  “If you don’t shut those curtains,” he warned, his voice low, raspy, and very serious, and Steve thought about denying him, but then remembered a long-ago piece of advice,
Steve saw red.  He forced himself to take a deep breath, to slow his heart rate before he could not restrain his own anger.  “What is this?” Steve demanded, voice rising.  “Some kind of—of—evaluation?”  He stumbled over the words.  He did not know how to say them without revealing that the thought of failing it scared him the most; that he would not be capable of
Steve clicked the radio again.  Something that passed for music filled the car.  Tony bemoaned, “Absolutely not.”
Feral like Barium, Ferrum, and Iodine.  Someday, they might all try to eat him, if he gave them half a chance on an empty stomach.  That was the way of wild dragons.
Still, there was more to life than star-trekking.  There was more than the great big nothingness out there.
it,” Tony mimicked.  Then he made a swipe for the flour bowl.  Steve lifted it out of reach.  “That’s not fair.”
“Briar Patch,” Tony agreed.  Then, doing a visible double take, he asked Stovok, “Since when do you speak
Steve gave him a heartfelt deadpan, then proceeded to the more relevant details.  “They said you were a former weapons’ manufacturer,” he paraphrased.  “Who—”
Tony prodded the suit with the broomstick handle.  The vacuuming ceased.  Both suit and man turned to watch as Steve calmly rolled the vacuum across the floor, raveled up the cord, and hooked it over the back of the machine.  “Perhaps he has ceased,” J.A.R.V.I.S. speculated, turning to look at Tony.
Steve remembered watching the tape run for a while in silence, all that cheap wasted tape.  It was a courtesy, he learned later.  The real equipment was nearly invisible, it was so small.  The outdated dinosaur stuff was for his benefit.  He could only imagine how poorly the conversation would have gone without the overture:
“Royalty,” Mayor Cuff said, offering a gracious bow of the head.  “You surround yourself with interesting people, Mr. Stark.”
“Nothing happened, Tony,” Steve assured, surprised to find his own voice forgiving.  Sure, he had been beaten up by the river, but he had lived to tell the tale.  Maybe Clint would have jumped, had he given the man the opportunity.  Certainly, Clint would have died if he had.
Life was good.  Life was damn good.  Some mornings, he even woke up before Steve, because Tellurium had decided to bully him out of his own bed—that part was perhaps less than ideal, but the heart-swelling moment of
Tony huffed, a pronounced point amid the undisguised exertion of trekking uphill.  “Okay.  I don’t believe in God, but I do think Thor is telling the truth, because if he’s not, then I’m crazy, and I’m not crazy.”  More huffing.  “I don’t have anything against God, but if I knock on a door and no one ever answers—why keep knocking?  And that’s just the—”  With a sudden defeated huff, he stopped and very nearly collapsed on the trail, stretching out his legs in front of him without a care for impeding nonexistent human traffic.  “Tip of the iceberg,” he finished.
Tony pushed at him, not hard but with enough fear that Steve let go and stepped back, realized what he was doing.  “I’m sorry,” he began, as Tony tried to come awake, process what was happening, and flee, all at once.  “Don’t go,” Steve pleaded.
By some miracle of interior design, Tony landed not on the concrete floor but on an adjacent couch.  He sat up, dazed but unharmed, and watched Steve throttle the suit, attempting to decapitate it while it continued to hold down his legs.  Flopping down on his back, Tony bemoaned, “This is my punishment.  This is my cosmic
“You’re going to have to,” Tony admitted, hating the sudden claustrophobia clinging to him, the abject
Fury nodded at him, then looked around the bridge.  “I have yet to congratulate Dr. Banner on keeping the two of you alive.”
I have had these silly Avengers ideas kicking around for so long, I worried I might never have an outlet for them. To finally be in a position to write them is a joy, and I am so fortunate to invite you along for the journey!
His knees went weak.  Too proud to fall, he put a hand on the frozen wall and controlled his descent, letting his legs fold in the pebbly gravel.
.  Natasha was right.  Steve stepped forward, reaching out, saying out loud, “You gotta let somebody help.  You gotta let
Steve took a seat at the table, casting a rebuking look at Natasha, who looked unfazed.  Bruce had almost succeeded in shrinking out of sight when Steve netted him verbally: “Dr. Banner.”  Bruce winced but peered up at him dolefully.  “What is this?”
Steve blinked once, slowly.  He looked right at Hill, even as Natasha stepped back, inviting him in.
Steve gave Tony a flat look over his stack of strawberry-rhubarb pies.  “I’ll buy you another pair, all right?”
Turning, Steve regarded the Vision.  “Death always seemed a strange thing to memorialize,” the Vision explained, stepping closer.  “Like . . . treading water.  Is it not weight, to carry them?”
A perfect chameleon, despondency set aside for unfettered anticipation, Thor stepped into the greenhouse, drew in one huge breath, and declared that it smelled like
Steve stared incredulously at the scene before him, trying to decipher the mixed feelings in his gut.  Part of him was hungry—hungry for family, hungry for love, hungry for home and kinship and
“Mm,” Tony said ambiguously, stealing a fry from Steve’s basket, ignoring the instinctively rebuking look Steve gave him.  “See, I thought you were on
Immediately, Tony removed his helmet.  He could hear voices in the distance, pleasant chatter, the sound of children playing.
Of all the things he had expected to go extinct, drive-in theatres seemed high on the list.  There was something precious about them.  Precious things never lasted.
“It’s Beethoven,” Tony grunted, chewing so aggressively Steve worried for his jaw.  Then Tony set his knife down—embedded it in the table next to the first one, actually, but Steve caught the sentiment—and complained, “I finally get the guy and I
“It is true,” agreed the first elder.  “We have nothing to gain through negotiations.  “We have nothing to lose by their extinction.”
“No,” Tony interrupted, holding up a hand.  Steve waited.  “I’m not asking you to spend the rest of your
Tony glared a hole into the table, then sighed.  “Nobody’s got the kind of love you’ve got to give,” Tony insisted.  “It gives out, somewhere.”
Jeremiah gave him one last deep sniff, then trundled back over to his master.  “Oh, c’mon, you gotta love dogs,” Steve insisted, tossing an arm behind his head, uncaring that he was failing the objective to pick strawberries.  Clint could pick enough strawberries for five men.  Clint could probably pick enough strawberries for fifty men.  “Everybody loves dogs.”
“I got it,” Tony said, shifting out of Steve’s one-armed hold and chucking the crumpled-up bag of popcorn at the back of Clint’s head.  It bounced off.  Clint lunged for it and lobbed it back with force.
“Well, hiya,” a stout woman in a straw hat greeted, leading a small, furry llama on a leash.  “I’m Linda.  Welcome to Little Bushel Alpaca Farm.”
.  This is Alaska!” Thor exclaimed, still wearing his swim shorts, floral tunic, and plastic guitar—apparently oblivious to the cold.
“No, I gave it to Bruce,” Tony said, indicating the empty shake and the sleeping not-so-giant.  He passed the drink back, adding, “I hate vanilla.”
“Thor’s always hungry,” Tony reminded.  They both looked over at the careful clink of plates eight and nine joining the pile.  “That’s not a full carton, that’s the whole henhouse.”
But then Tony said, “Aren’t we all, Steve?”  Steve almost wanted to cuff him, to throttle him for the scare, for the sheer dread he had put so simply and easily in Steve’s heart, but Tony was not wrong.
“Merry BIRTH-day, dear . . . THEE,” Thor insisted, setting the cake on the table.  Steve could feel the heat from two feet away.  “Merry BIRTH-day, to THEE.”
Steve’s was not: “Wow,” he said softly.  A pair of long-necked monsters grinned at each other, mouths agape, tails curved to overlap on the far side of the room, their positions as playful as they were austere.  A lush simulated forest breathed fresh life into the skeletons; it seemed possible that they could animate at any moment, ducking down to nibble at the greenery around their tree-trunk limbs or perhaps groom one another.
Tony blinked slowly at his surroundings, unable to comprehend them.  They were in a cave—a small, dark cave, but a cave, nonetheless—that was just tall enough for a man to stand in and pace, as Dr. Banner was, keeping as much distance between himself and their Vulcan leader as possible.  “They’re primitive, of course they’re
Steve sighed.  “Don’t be,” he murmured, kissing Tony’s temple.  “Got every right to be angry, Tony.”

good.  Stronger than he had in weeks.  Now that he listened to his body, he noticed the missing twinge in his back, the absent ache in his head.  “Is there a positive form of radiation?” he mused.  “Because I feel
that would not materialize into a breakthrough.  It was very irritating.  “So, what, we hail the Klingons, ask them to send back two of Starfleet’s finest, thanks?  Do they accept fruit baskets?”
Shaking his head wordlessly in wonder, Tony stepped out of the stone-walled home without waiting for further discussion.  All he could think was,
“I’m not sour,” Steve snapped.  Bristling, he added, “Just because you’ve never rationed a day in your life—”
, Tony thought, as Steve toed the severed broom head aside and picked up the cord instead, plugging it back into the wall.  The vacuum came alive.
“Sure thing, Pixie Meat,” Tony said, swiping the bowl from Bruce.  “Where’s the rest of the band, anyway?”
Oh, good.  That was good.  Steve nudged him up the cave wall.  Somewhat detached from his own body and all the fear associated with it, Tony observed, “Never pegged you for the handsy type.”
, and Tony struggled to do so, afraid Marker might really hurt him if he did not make a candid attempt.
, I’ll walk,” and was forced to sit back down when one of his two babysitters threatened to Taser him.
“Ha-ha,” Tony said, pushing himself upright.  Once he was on hands and knees, Stovok gripped the back of his uniform and set him on his feet.  “Thanks.”
Then he thought of colors, soft blues and misty whites, and said, “F.R.I.D.A.Y., hold the elevator.”
to experience something, to deliberately reach out and touch the universe.  From the shifting weather to the fickle company, control was a scarce and precious thing.
Thor’s effortless strokes belied the strength of the river.  The tug below was powerful.  The shock of cold water robbed the remaining breath from his lungs.  Ascending proved difficult; staying above the water, nearly impossible.  The fast-moving current made it impossible to tread.
“Bruce, you want one?” Tony called.  Bruce startled at the sound of his name, looking away from the full-grown white alpaca he had been stroking.  He shook his head adamantly.  “What’s that one?  Snowball?”
Tony thought, patting him on the gold-sleeved arm.  “S’fine,” he said out loud, words slurred.  The air was cold, even though Stovok put off body heat like a living furnace.  Tony’s face still felt numb.  “Not exactly how I planned to spend m' evening, but I’ve never slept with a Vulcan before.”
Tony cleared his throat.  When Natasha released him with a parting kiss to Steve’s cheek, Tony made an objecting noise and promptly shoved his way between Steve and Bruce, who cowered aside.  “Tony, be nice,” Steve warned.
“What, six-foot-two, looks like a Labrador Retriever got lost in a Honda dealership?” Tony said around a mouthful of mints.  He offered the box to Steve.  Steve took it, then set the telephone pointedly on Tony’s open palm.  Tony rolled his eyes but held onto it.
Tony just said, “Not much of a hiker.”  He tried to take in a deeper breath, winced, and said, “Let’s just—let’s just get back to the car.”
One, Juneau had the highest percentage of millionaires of any small town in America.  About one-in-ten households.
“Ahhhh,” Thor said with a twinkle in his eye.  “A bargain, you strike?”  He reached into his own pocket and produced a flask.  “Asgardian’s finest, aged for a
is a mouse.”  It did come alive in a frighteningly real manner, skittering across the table in such a way that, had Steve been a little more awake, he might have leaped to his feet in alarm, but as it was, he watched the fuzzy ball roll along before returning dutifully to Clint’s palm.  “I’m gonna put it under Stark’s bed.”
“They seemed happy,” Anij said softly.  Sojef laid a steadying hand on her shoulder.  “We would have given them the same choice, to leave if they so desired.  But time was of the essence.”
“Hail!” he heard from a distance.  The river pulled him under before he could respond, careening him towards destiny.
“Strike?”  Looking at the coffee, Tony added, “No, I just don’t drink drip coffee.”  He stepped outside, slid the door shut behind him, and looked around.  “You wanna go look at some flowers?  I’ve heard good things about the Conservatory.  I haven’t seen any flowers in a while.  Nobody buys the billionaire any flowers.”  Lifting his coffee, Tony gulped it down, then added, “Oh, and, I wanna show you the playboy mansion.  It’s a national treasure.”
“Soft, too,” Tony said, smoothing down the blades under a hand.  Stovok looked at him, his expression rebuking, almost distressed, before Tony lifted his hand and the grass slowly rebounded.  Then Stovok relaxed, mirroring the movement, far more carefully, still using the back of his hand.
With meaningful dismissal, Steve took a seat on the couch, staring Hill down but no longer actively bearing down on her.  Natasha joined him on the couch.  Steve wanted to snarl at her, to demand to know why she could not choose a side, but he kept himself in check.  He had a good rep—he needed to keep it.  He drew in another deep breath and let it out slowly.
The nice thing about Natasha was, he could walk alongside her in silence and not feel strange about it.  There was so much mystery in her past that even chipping away at it was a hopeless endeavor.  What she gave was enough for him; what she gave was
Maybe it was.  “You might want to stop him,” Natasha advised, thankfully letting go of him and nodding at Tony, who was staring at a sporty black-and-gold car that was apparently so important it had to be behind a leash.  “Before he does anything rash.”  Then she slipped away into the crowd.
Iron Man looked at him stoically.  “See, that’s not the thing I want to be thanked for,” he said at last.  “Hold onto me.”
.  One stranded Starfleet ship full of cannibals had scared the pants off Starfleet Command, and the infamous five-year contract had arisen shortly thereafter, under the misguided belief that space, alone, was the cause of their insanity.
Steve held him in place with one arm and spear-fished another hot dog off the grill with the other.  “I said,
“It’s another country out here,” their guide said as they paused and looked out at a commanding strip of wilderness, stretching off into some three thousand square miles of forbidding terrain.  “You can get lost in it.  Don’t forget your bear spray,” she advised.  “They won’t hurt you, but they might rough you up.”
Then he looked over and saw the two bachelors on the couch—one beheaded, the other zonked out of his mind—and told them, “I

Tony glared at him for a moment longer, then twisted his shirt, released it.  “I will shave your head in your sleep,” he threatened.

The clerk looked at him, then the empty box, then the soaked cat, and finally back at his face.  “Yes, we do, Captain America, sir.  Do you need a towel?”

Bruce shook his head, but Thor insisted, “Come, I shall show you my quarters,” and Bruce had no choice but to follow.
“If he took it, it bonded,” Steve said, like the truth was ripped out of him.  “It’s gone, Tony, who are we to take it back?”
Hulk shifted until his back was facing her, almost shy in his manner.  Steve wondered what kind of mind the Hulk had, then decided he was probably better off
, Steve meant, families were generally large and the very center of Irish life.  The whole clan survived and died based on strong blood bonds.  Separating oneself from one’s kin was like stepping out of a well-formed encampment and vowing to cross the tundra, alone, with barely a month’s provisions to get by.  There was civilization on the other side of that vast stretch, opportunity, a world beyond the simple life, the unstable but familiar world of farming.  But there was danger, and hardship, and loneliness, too.
, he thought, looking over at Marker, gliding on the air effortlessly, unaware that he was remarkable, that anyone would love him.
Cracks splintered the barrier around Tony’s emotional heart.  Anguish threatened to creep in.  “This may come as a surprise,” he said, voice steady but not for long, “—but I am, too.”  He hunched inward a little, automatically, an instinctual response, facing a wall with a monster at his back and afraid of neither.  The worst was inside himself.  The suffering was completely contained.  All he could do was lash out, desperately communicate that underneath a smooth overlay, the thorns were
He was.  Angry.  Afraid.  Anguished.  He held onto Steve’s arm.  It did not budge.  He found comfort in it, the sheer substantiality.  It felt real.  Not like imaginary spiders or even the desperate pounding of his own heart.  “I just.”
“I’m not bored,” Tony enunciated, arms folded on the back of Steve’s seat, chin resting on them.  Steve had long since given up trying to keep him in the backseat, and apparently even given up on trying to maintain a personal bubble.  Part of him worried that he was giving in too easily, but another part sort of shrugged its shoulders and asked what it was to him if Tony Stark needed the space.  “I am . . . on the lookout.”
Carefully, with plenty of lead time to reject the gesture, Tony reached over and placed a hand on Stovok’s knee.  “I wouldn’t have you anywhere else.  Commander.”
, but Thor shuffled back on his rock, wrenching a cry out of Steve’s chest as he was dragged over the sharp rocks.  Once half of his body was out of the water, he managed to grip on with his working left arm and use it to grip onto Thor’s armor in return, relieving the strain on his right arm.  He gasped desperately in relief.
He could feel Tony breathing desperately, gasping, trying so hard to live.  Steve reached out, grabbed a metal hand, and squeezed until the metal finally retreated.
visitor, Tony could only conjure up drinks to share in the lounge area with Tiberius.  He was grateful that Marker was sleeping outside, Steve and Snow off on a hunt.
He sat upright slowly.  Marker nudged him again, trying to help, and Tony inhaled sharply.  Finally,
, Tony chanted, pacing the floor, waiting impatiently for Happy to appear.  Marker was cheerfully devouring a butchered ewe, while four of the six hatchlings risked life and limb to carve off smaller snippets from his prize.  The other two hatchlings had curled up with Snow, who looked troubled, her attention drifting from Marker to Tony and then the door.
“Mine is much larger,” Thor interjected, gripping one of the overhead straps, looking over them dismissively.  “I cannot tell which of you is which.”  He turned to face Stovok.  “I will assume you are Stark.”
“You’d think the whole ‘killer Bird Flu’ would be more concerning,” Steve replied, sitting in Tony’s favorite bean bag and crunching down on chocolate chip cookies.
Thor paused, gave him a look that had frozen the heart of more than one lion, and continued calmly towards second base.
Tony’s expression softened, some of the indifference fading, revealing a hint of fear, of shock.  He schooled it back to indifference, hackles raised, as uncomfortable with their setting as Steve was, but when Steve said, “Come here,” Tony blanched, almost trembled.
From a short distance, Hulk snorted sharply.  They both turned to look.  Hulk was looking after them, nostrils flaring.  Steve sighed, waved a hand, and shouted back, “I’m just takin’ a walk.”  Hulk growled.  “I’ll come back.”
Warily, Tony idled one step closer.  “I don’t know if I like desperate on you,” he joked.  Tried to.  His own voice sounded strained.  “Which is weird, because normally I love when my partners—”
Tony said, “Hm?”  When Steve looked at him, he was tapping at his telephone again.  Steve nudged him.  “What?
Owned by Peugeot, the Onyx was listed as a coupe—a two-door, closed-roof—concept car.  Steve frowned.  “What’s a concept car?” he asked.
“Half-Vulcan,” Tony said, looking down at Stovok, his head and shoulders balanced on Tony’s folded thighs.  “He’s human, too.”
Thor said, “YES!” loudly enough that Lucky sprinted back to them.  “Come to me!” Thor encouraged, arms out, as the dog leaped into them.
Steve watched Tony walk right out the door.  He half-thought Tony might drive off and leave them all stranded.  He could, Steve realized, equal parts discouraged by his own dependence and untroubled at the thought.  They could all get by.
Tony made a sad little trumpet sound.  Bruce watched Thor drink intently, then, with sudden fear, asked, “Uh, is that—are you sure about—”
Humming, Tony said, “I know a better place.  They got music.  Blues.  Not my thing.  But I’m kind of falling asleep here.  Walk with me.”  And he got up without another word.
He met her halfway, flinching when a huge drop of blood landed on his shoulder.  She breathed on him, hot and oily.  She could set him on fire faster than he could make the door.  And still, it was the least effective of her killing techniques.
Tony said, “Nice work, Smokey,” and pulled out a cutting knife.  “Who wants to bet I can slice the cake from this distance?”
.  Give an inch, they took a mile, removing the door if they had to, giving themselves the freedom to act
“The Vulcan gave us hope,” admitted Anij.  “Vulcans have always exercised restraint.  We admire their ability to act for the greatest good.”
He skittered back a step.  Tony pinched his brow.  Happy gritted out, “He’s—” but Tony cut off viciously,
“Thor’s specialty is hand-to-hand combat,” Stovok reminded patiently.  “I believe it would be an insult to his race to intrude upon his glory.”
of these,” and trying to ignore the warmth in his chest when Steve leaned to kiss his knuckles.  “Well.  Aren’t you sweet.”
Tony smiled, then schooled his expression into a sterner one.  “You’re not supposed to agree with me.”
Snow hunted weekly, but Steve fed the hatchlings from the meat locker daily, occasionally driving out to a butcher shop to restock.  Snow preferred her meals hot-blooded and squealing, but Marker, who had grown up in a more refined environment, enjoyed his meat frozen, occasionally raiding the meat locker for a snack.  Captain Fearless scolded the gold dragon fearlessly for his transgressions, but he could do little more than inflect a stern voice to deter the brute from his spoils.
“No, you have to bake it,” Steve said, replacing the cookie dough ball on the tray, rolling up more dough without missing a beat.  Tony gave him a floored look.  Steve did not even pause.  “Don’t you know anything?”
, anybody with half a mind should be scared to death of his anger, but she sat on the bed like she had never been touched by a storm, and he could only snarl in impotent anger back at her, not daring to make the first move, to declare war against S.H.I.E.L.D.
When he came to, he was in a state of shock, and mercifully alone.  He heard distant, hair-raising clicking sounds, followed by wet crunching noises.  He realized, suddenly, that he had evaded a very close call through another’s misfortune, and that, if he did not evacuate the territory immediately, he might still be on the menu.
Tony skidded into home plate, breathing hard but literally glowing with triumph, arms stretched out, blue light bright under his shirt.  “Two-nothing!” he exclaimed.  “Two-nothing!”
“Get lots of tourists this time of year.  Come to see the whales, mostly,” their guide explained.  “Humpbacks, orcas.  The real treasure is the glaciers.  You should check out Mendenhall.”
Ready for Chicago? I have *plans.* 🐼❤️ (And a new puppy! Been having an absolutely lovely time with him behind-the-scenes.)
Steve did not sigh, stepping forward.  He let the main door shut loudly behind him.  After a confused moment, Bruce opened the curtains, shedding light on the room.  It was still barely sunrise, and Bruce blinked when he saw it, then covered a yawn behind a hand.  “Natasha’s got coffee,” Steve offered charitably.
As the hoots and clicks and laughter resumed, Tony looked down at the Vulcan on his lap, sighing deeply.  “Please wake up.  Please wake up,” Tony chanted, less fearful than simply desperate.  “Please.  Somebody’s got to be the beautiful buff blond around here and it sure as shit ain’t me.”
Or, at least, he neutrally tolerated it.  He neutrally tolerated Steve, too.  As far as Steve was concerned, neutral tolerance was golden.
Tony let the silence steep between them, interrupted only by the wind and crashing waves, dimmed by the thick rock walls, and Dr. Banner’s soft snoring.
“Then you’re insane,” Tony said.  “I don’t need rescuing.”  He spread his hands.  “I’m doing quite well for myself.  As you can see.”
Even more defensive, Steve reached for his half-eaten bread.  “Well, we had first aid, too,” he justified, slathering the bread in margarine and refusing to admit that he had holed up in his appointed room and ignored virtually every entreaty to come out.  Not long after, aliens had come knocking down their door.  “We had everything we needed,” he defended.  “I have seen nothing we did not have, only improved upon.”
Fun fact: While there is no Little Bushel Alpaca Farm, there *is* a Thistle Creek Farm, which has over 60 alpacas. It's located outside Buffalo, New York. All OCs are purely fictional.
, according to Natasha and Clint, respectively.  (Clint wore his I’M ACTUALLY HAWKEYE shirt at least twice a week and got recognized on average once a month.  Tony envied him.  But only in small ways.)
, but he could not leave the dragons alone.  Not even with Happy.  They might very well eat Happy, he thought, two sets of dragon eyes fixed on him.
“Don’t talk to her like that.”  Steve didn’t know he had a voice like that inside him, but the thought of either of his new teammates—and they were a team, damn Fury, damn S.H.I.E.L.D., damn it all—blowing each other’s tops off was enough to flip a switch inside him, erasing the fatigue, leaving only cold, stony command in its place.  “You don’t talk to her like that.”
Laughing, Tony rolled onto his back and howled with amusement while Stovok grumbled and paced around his own quarters, restless as a jaguar.  He even managed to dictate a report, which Tony noticed left out the juicy bits in the cave and the long bits at the volcano.  He said loudly, “Kiss and tell!” and heard the recording pause.
Hulk roared, making both of them flinch, but as soon as Clint turned the hose back on him, he subsided back to a peaceful smirk, seated almost like a Buddha.  It was, admittedly, surreal, with all the blue-purple-pink foam on him.
,” Steve said, perhaps a bit too drolly, as Tony gave him a look that implied he lacked gratitude for the gift of knowledge and did not offer him any sort of cold-weather gear.
With a very odd laugh, a sort of start-stop inhale, Iron Man managed, “You touch me, I’ll knock your fucking head off.”
Nodding, Steve acknowledged, “He’s a crazy sonuvabitch.”  Bruce relaxed a little, like the elephant had finally been spoken for.  “But he means well.”  Consolingly, he added, “If he gets out of line, I’ll reel him in.”
Sighing, Steve propped his face on his hand and rested his elbow on the windowsill, glaring out the window.
“Well, now you’ve done it,” Tony told him, unwrapping a burger with shaking hands, excited and scared because oh, God, it had been
“Okay,” Tony said at last, and Steve instantly resumed petting him.  Tony sighed with uncontained frustration, resting his chin on top of Steve’s head momentarily, wondering how the hell he was supposed to make it until morning, where he would be
With a reverse inhale, Tony awoke, eyes flashing open, pain erupting in his chest, static foaming down his right arm.
.  Here, I mean.  Say what you will, you are an old man, now.  In this century.”  Tony looked at him, but there was not a hint of mocking in his eyes, no laugh-with-me humor in his tone.  “It’s been sixty-seven
His work with antimatter was only second to his work on dark matter and energy.  He had made many friends throughout the Federation by spreading the celestial good news: they were in the infancy stages of harnessing it, for travel, leisure, and commercial use, and he was going to help them get to full capacity in his lifetime.
“You seem awfully happy,” Dr. Banner said gruffly, cleaning up an errant claw mark on Tony’s left arm.
Rico was often underfoot, diminutive and quick, lightning out of the bottle.  Rico took pleasure in destroying things and got into everything he was not supposed to, prompting Steve to think one step ahead of his conniving cat brain.  Rico also loved to watch Steve cook, even though Steve’s best dish were his sandwiches.  Rico seemed to love hot objects, whether it was warm fireplaces or stovetops, creating perennial dread for Steve as he leaped to be one step ahead of his cat, who would fling himself less hazardously onto a pile of fresh laundry.
Dr. Banner held up a hand, approached the hole in the ground, and stared down at it.  With a full-body shudder, he dropped first to his knees, then flattened himself onto his belly, chanting
“Uh-huh,” Steve said, glaring at the landline with real ire as it failed to reveal its secrets to him, unplugging the cord.  Natasha laid a hand on Steve’s arm.  To have words with him.
“No,” Natasha said, lounging on the bed next to Steve.  “I used to be a little girl.”  Then she smiled.  Steve found his lips twitching, an involuntary echo, and wondered if she knew how contagious her smile was.
Hulk thumped a fist on the ground, then stood up, wandered ape-like over to the car, and—to Steve’s horror—smashed a fist against the rooftop, concaving it.
“I could watch this all day,” Tony said, surprisingly happy, to be on-world, away from the fuss-and-muss of filing reports, enjoying what life had to offer.  Then, scowling, he added, “That doesn’t mean I’m going down without a fight.”
, Steve closed his eyes to listen properly and acknowledged, “You got Beethoven in there, too?  The sound’s incredible.”
“I’ll suck the venom out, it’s fine,” Tony insisted, clunking off the vessel.  The heat was intense, but he still stuck two fingers in his mouth and whistled loudly.  Three of the Gorn looked over immediately.  Tony stomped his feet at them.  They stomped over.
Tony arranged himself artfully on the bench.  “We both know you can finish that report later,” he simpered.
“You guys are missing out.  I think my hearing aids are shorting out,” Clint said, a little more loudly than usual, covered from head to toe in rainbow-colored soap.  “Is this toxic?”
There was a whine from Clint, followed by footsteps sprinting towards the outfield.  Thor got up and offered Steve a hand up.  With a huff, Steve took it and pulled himself back upright.
“Oh.  Well.  Same as you,” Tony said, swaying into him as the elevator began to descend.  Steve let him stay without moving him.  “‘Fuck off, Nicholas.’  I added the ‘Nicholas.’”
, back onto the ship.  “You are becoming dehydrated,” Stovok said, and handed him an in-case-of-emergency hydro-pack.  “Drink this.”
, the man inside the metal jacket went on, lying sideways across the conference room chair, the picture of nonchalance despite the bloody trading cards scattered across the table,
Much like you all do! Thank you very much for your ongoing support, and I hope to have even more silly adventures up soon.
Then he heard it: chittering, nearby, yelping and clucking noises that grew in volume as they neared.  Tony nearly got up, but he trusted the Vulcan’s ruthless judgment over his own animal need to
The chef paled but had no choice but to endure the Hirogen’s praise until Thor released him.  Still shaking visibly from the encounter, the chef nodded, said, “I’ll make more,” and blitzed off.
A firm knock came on the external door.  Tony sighed loudly as Romanova switched the transport into pre-transit once again.  He just wanted to get in,
“We would have left sooner,” Sojef submitted, “had we been able to requisition a vessel earlier.  First Contact had just been made with Vulcan when we sailed off into the stars.  We recognized your. . . .”
“I’ll pass it along,” Steve assured, confident that Clint would find them, when he was ready.  He turned again.
“This is a near ideal arrangement for heat conservation,” Stovok explained, his arms like iron around Tony.  “I apologize for the breach of decorum.  I aim only to maximize contact.”
If only he could look at New York with anything other than bitterness, Steve thought, grimly tailing the group.
out of the blue, you would have no idea if I meant bread or—cheese,” Tony went on, evidently not plagued by the same quarrels, plucking a blueberry from the pile.  “Could be a lovely pinot, an exotic truffle.  Caviar.  All of the above.”
Steve just retraced their steps back to the front door.  He looked back at the interior, empty but for Tony Stark, who replaced the mug on top of the napkin.  “Well, all right, then,” Tony Stark said decisively.  “Onward.”
,” Natasha replied.  Looking at Steve, she said, “I am not afraid of wolves,” and nodded her chin at the door.  “He is.  There is your answer.”
“Most probably a protective layer to shield from direct exposure ultraviolet radiation,” Stovok theorized.  “A fascinating adaptation.”
, mind you, might take. . . .”  He ticked off his fingers, then shook his head.  “I’m sorry, what were we talking about?  I just have this overwhelming feeling of, is this joy?  And both of you are frowning at me.”
Steve winced a little, like Tony was making fun of him.  Tony said, “I don’t mind.”  Steve frowned in confusion.  “Uh, you know.  Picking favorites.”
He blew out a relieved breath.  Then he looked to his left and stiffened at the cluster of Nibirans, staring back at him with undisguised shock, spears pointed at him.  Holding up his hands in a placating gesture, he said, “Now, I know what you’re thinking—”
The woman grinned.  “You two fellows ought to stop by the Fred Meyer down the road.  Get stocked up.  You hikers or fishers?”
He marveled at the marble dunes of Steve’s back, smoothing his palms over them methodically.  Steve’s breath wafted across his folded arms, his half-lidded eyes regarding the ocean view with mild interest.  His entire demeanor reminded Tony of a lolling big cat, approaching but never crossing the line of boredom.  He indulged Tony’s whims.  He indulged
Grumbling under his breath, Tony shoved the vacuum back in the closet, dumped the soapy bucket in the sink, and dispatched a Roomba to siphon up the mess.
down there, already devouring Bruce—poor, sweet Bruce—and waiting to make him their next victim.  There was no way out: they were surrounded by pockmarked rock on all sides, each full of holes, eroded tunnels.  Desperately afraid, Tony hid his face against Cap’s neck.
Tony drew in a shallow breath.  It was painful.  The reminder that he was gone, and past, and over.  He wondered if it hurt for Steve, too, breathing in Hell, existing in a place beyond existence.
stricken by illness at such a young age as to be permanently shaped by it—that was one who could hardly shout and be heard, even once.

“No.  Go make it up to him,” Clint ordered.  At Steve’s expression, he gave Steve an encouraging shove in the right direction.  “I will not have Operation
Steve swallowed, surprised at how dry his mouth was.  “What’s your point, Tony?” he asked, glad his voice was stiff, upright.
Shaking his head, Steve strolled to first base, resting one foot against the very edge of it.  “Having fun?” he asked Natasha, who had wisely held her ground.
?” Steve snapped, before checking himself with a tight sigh.  Tony was right, but: “I don’t wanna hear it,” Steve repeated.
Thor merely held out both arms and shouted, “Fair Lady!” with such an award-winning smile Natasha smiled back.  “You have returned!”
That got a huff of laughter from Tony Stark.  “I’m pretty sure she’s my guardian angel.  But I don’t believe in God.”
—the starship had exploded in a wave of light at nearly the same moment that three of its senior members had teleported, presumably onto the neighboring Romulan vessel, to render diplomatic aid.
The heat from the semi-dormant volcano seemed to give Stovok a second wind.  Not so for Tony.  He sweltered in his gabardine uniform, cursing himself for not removing the top half of his uniform at the lip of the volcano.  At least it protected him from the heat radiating far below, oozing between cracks in the hardened rock.  Any closer, and they would really start to feel it.  He was still considering removing the tunic when he bumped into a stationary Stovok’s back.
It gave Tony chills to read accounts from those who had lost their dragons.  It happened routinely, since dragons came and went in the lives of humans at their choosing.  They were not bound to humans, and so, all too often, a human companion awoke to find their seemingly lifelong companion had vanished for good.  The grief was terrible.
,” he repeated.  “Please respond.  Please respond,” he said, quiet but sincere.  “This is the stupidest, goddamn—”  He made sure to step
Tony grumbled but yanked the wheel, parking on the curb.  Clint snored on.  Bruce jerked awake, staring at them as Tony turned fully in his seat to glare at Steve.  “Now what?”
.”  And then, despite his burning lungs and exhausted legs, he pushed himself to his feet.  He flicked on his own tricorder beacon, which clicked softly in the right direction.
Stovok ignored him for a few more seconds, then turned the sink off, returned, and grimaced firmly at the fruit, back in Tony’s hand.  “Acid,” he said.  “Highly acidic.  Like a—”
,” Steve insisted quietly, digging his feet in as Iron Man tried to lurch away.  Thank God he could not fly without full power, although Steve sensed he wanted to try, wanted to risk it.  “Come on.  You’re hurt.”
Standing noticeably straighter with undisguised satisfaction, Tony noticed Steve’s arched eyebrows and affected an air of dismissal.  “See?  Nice guy.”
“The ripple effect will be minimal?  I agree.  It seems that, at worst, you have become . . . part of their mythology.  Starfleet doubts even you would risk your reputation within the Federation to capitalize on it.”
Depositing the leftover Coleman pies on the counter, Steve began to wander around the penthouse, taking in the Chicago skyline, while Thor showed off his quarters to Bruce—“This bathing apparatus is quite primitive, but effective!”—while Clint snored from another room, Natasha and Tony exchanged words in their corner.  The conversations began to blur together as Steve approached the big windows, looking out at the city.
, with its teeth-filled maw nearly grazing the high ceiling.  While murmuring admirers had passed by him, his mother had stayed close, gripping his hand tightly, like he might run away and never return.
“Mm-hm,” their guide replied, hiking along the road, relentless, unexpectedly spry.  “Wetter than Seattle.”
for—“I want everybody out,” he declared suddenly.  When no one seemed inclined to listen, he turned back to the king and his men and said, “Now.  I want everybody out now.”  Snapping his fingers to indicate the masses, Tony pointed out rightfully, “We got Loki.
He waited, half-expecting Stovok to drag him to the garbage chute and dispose of him.  But Stovok merely frowned at him, looking genuinely confused, and said with real affront, “Why did you lick me?”
“Am I not supposed to?”  Tony shrugged a shoulder, grimaced at the way it pulled on his back.  “They’re . . . like people, but . . . different.”
There was nothing particularly remarkable about it—it was not the day when Tony would sign off the Iron Man armor to a trusted branch of Stark Industries led by Peter Parker, for example, nor was it the day when Tony would celebrate his twenty-first year of marriage (a day that Steve had once imagined would never arrive)—but it was a beautiful snowy morning, and Tony was there to witness it, and Steve was there to bear witness to
“And I will make a suit,” Tony assured.  “I’ll attribute the rest to Barton failing to reset your shoulder six times.”
With the foot traffic muffled, Steve took a few moments to collect himself, running shaking hands over his legs.  He liked people, but he had trouble distinguishing people grabbing him for a fight and grabbing him for a photograph.  It was easier to keep them at a distance, but Steve hated it as much as he preferred it.  He
Sniffing at the bedcovers, Rico’s big flat ears twitched.  Tony flopped onto his back suddenly, the left half of his body more ragdoll than the right (
He bristled, unsure where the trap would spring, but aware that there was one, there had to be one.  “Fine,” he snapped.

Relieved, he kicked back in his chair, only to be hit with a wave of heat as the transport vessel pressurized with the ambient humidity.  “Whew, it is
“How did you find us?” Commander Stovok asked, like he was asking for a mission report about a vague world he had never been to, and not the fate of his own life.
—Tony reached out and dragged the cat towards himself.  Rico went low for a moment, nearly flattening himself on the mattress, then, decisively, leaped onto Tony’s chest.
Nevertheless, if transposed onto the densest population center in the United States, the entire city of Juneau, Alaska could fit comfortably within 1.1 square miles of New York, New York without altering the existing demographics.
He stepped out into the city noise, the bright blue sky shining bright through the skyscraper jungle.
Steve broke away from the pack, approaching Coleman and his hounds.  One of them stood up and toddled over, tail swinging back and forth.  “They’re not usually much for strangers,” Coleman mused.  Steve stroked the sunbaked copper fur, unable to keep a smile off his face.  “Where did you say you’re from, again?”
“Not that I ever want to stifle your creativity,” Tony said, watching Steve jimmy at the windowsill, “but you do realize Natasha will cut off your dick if you break in, don’t you?”
but Tony’s preferred method was alcohol, and being shitfaced would probably only make cave-diving worse.
Gotta love crocodiles, Steve thought, following Thor around a glass wall and into a dark, underwater world.
have something on hand, he berated himself, ready to scream in frustration.  They lived with dragons, how could he—
This was all Barton’s fault, he thought, whining audibly as he shuffled forward.  The hellhole entrance reminded him of a storm drain, the kind on the sidewalk that led to unthinkable places.  He hooked one leg over the edge, carefully straddling it.  He squeezed his eyes shut, then swung his other leg over the edge.
Tony held his ground, leaning his shoulder into the door.  The silence dragged on.  He heard his own rasping breath, felt his heart pounding.  He felt, briefly, almost like it was not meant to be known, the handle twist with the simultaneous application of a slightly more rigorous push on the door.  He snarled audibly and shoved it back, hard, sending a message.  There was no possible way to lock it again, not with the handle caught between them, but he did not concede to the inevitable.  He would not give in.
Steve just stared at him for a long moment.  Disconcertingly long.  Was he a mirage?  A dream?  “Uh,” Tony managed.  Rhodey moved away.  “Hang on,” Tony rasped at him, grasping at him loosely.  Rhodey lingered by the side of the bed, just as Steve lingered in the doorway, staring at him.
on elevated platforms.  Admirers flocked to every car; it was no wonder, Steve mused, that every hotel in a thirty-mile radius was booked, almost solid.
Tony crossed the floor, never so far from the machinations of his own body that he could forget that he had one but swiping up the paperback and swinging it in the air meaningfully.  “You don’t get it.  This isn’t a book.  This is a blueprint.  Somebody’s going to make this.
Clint snorted a laugh into his beverage.  The volume in the living area reached a crescendo as Thor finished his guitar solo.  “Would you
Bruce swung with heart and managed to bounce the tennis ball to the pitcher’s mound.  Clint, who had been loping around the farthest reaches of the field, took off like a shot, streaking across the field while Bruce, blind with panic, raced for third base.  “Other way!” Tony shouted.  In a definitely-illegal but highly efficient maneuver, Bruce cut directly across the field, now on a collision course with Clint.  Clint dove past him for the ball, rolled, and came up running.
“What,” Tony said, then snickered, before reigning himself in with a visible effort, “do you call—a masturbating bull?”
The homeworld of the Ba’ku was eerily similar to Earth.  But—not the Earth Tony had grown up on, which had been shaped in every way by the stars.  It more closely resembled an Earth of lore, where Corinthian columns and sprawling bathhouses were not out of place.  It was like a living time capsule.  It made him uneasy.
Steve huffed in disgust.  “Little late for that, son,” he started, but Tony secured a grip around his wrist and
She had it all: hundreds of cozy beach villas, a statistically higher-than-average number of beach bars, and an equally improbable number of pristine white beaches.  With a year-round temperature of twenty-eight degrees Celsius and the highly desirable ability to produce rain only on command, Risa attracted more than her fair share of tourists, including countless Starfleet officers in need of some good old-fashioned R&R.
immediately.  The Briar Patch provided a compelling reason to extend your service, but I am afraid there is no further work in the immediate future that requires your expertise.”  Almost apologetically, she added, “I had hoped a trip to the Briar Patch might . . . cool your appetite for spaceflight.  Naturally, you have demonstrated the opposite.”
Gut twisted up by the pointedness of the confrontation, Steve had to point out, “I know there’s no going back.”
, Tony had explained once, curled up inside the dryer, like a cat.  He had many eccentric tastes.  He had always been smarter than Steve, taking advantage of them.
Oh, sure, Steve could clear a nine-foot-wall without so much as a running start, but it was still impressive to watch Clint leap into the night with abandon, following the trail out to the edge of Lake Michigan with fearless bounds.  “You go into the water, I’m not fishing you out,” Steve warned, as one leap put Clint within scant inches of the retaining wall.
Tucking himself closer to Steve’s front, allowing those big gentle monster claws to rest against his back, he breathed a short sigh of relief.  He was safe now.  He was safe from other monsters.
Leaving himself open to retaliation, Steve gripped the sides of Iron Man’s helmet in both hands, looked right into those soulless eyes, and insisted, “No one’s gonna take it, Tony.  We just wanna help.”
Steve tried to coax Rico to play with the feather teaser, but Rico seemed to prefer the sticks-and-mud-and-rocks-if-we’re-feeling-rich approach: he shredded unattended bags of cut oats and gnawed on Steve’s newest pair of shoes to his purring heart’s content.  And he pissed on the floor.  Still not a fan of boxes.  The Google said it could take four weeks to litterbox train a cat.  Steve figured that was just proof that everyone was a work-in-progress.
Tony had not been cleared to drink, but he had accepted the alcohol gratefully.  Anything to numb the mind.
“Should’ve held onto it, then, Tweety,” Tony said, still filling in answers.  “It’s too easy,” he complained suddenly, crumpling up the paper and chucking it at Clint’s face.
made it to Australia and back in one piece.  Who was Steve to question the almighty Navigator on his journey?
to rip it out of her hold, and swung around to face Natasha, embarrassment flushing his ears when he saw she had not moved an inch.
“Haven’t seen me in action.  I’m a master of my craft,” Tony whispered, holding out a palm.  Steve warily handed a couple over; Tony swallowed them dry.  “Ta-da.”
—but even the notion of it, that there might never be another stupid Tony answer to a stupid question of his was . . . disquieting.
“Shh.  Savoring.”  Tony stared at the card a moment longer, then pulled out his telephone and said bluntly, “Roscoe, it’s happening.”
“I want one horrible line for this horrible drink I am about to drink,” Steve explained, holding the shot glass up demonstratively.
Dr. Banner began to climb towards them, swaying dangerously towards the lip.  The Nibirans above watched for a few more seconds, then turned back, almost as one, and began to ascend.  Tony had no choice but to fall in line, or be shoved over the edge.
“This morning.  Must’ve known you were coming,” Steve added, finally pulling back but holding onto him by the shoulders, frowning at the blood.  “What’s—?”
Steve sighed, but he settled behind the wheel, reacquainted himself briefly with the stick, the pedals, before turning the key in the ignition.
Steve scowled.  Thor snored on.  Looking around the snow-dusted alley, Steve said, “I have an idea.”
Shedding his coat, Steve decided it would be at least twenty-five minutes before they arrived at any destination, shimmied until his back was against the soft leather floor, and for good measure, draped his own leather jacket over his face to block out the city lights.
Dolefully, Bruce got up and came over.  “Now, don’t you hurt him,” Steve warned, as Tony hopped down and bear-hugged Bruce from behind.
The Adler Planetarium was perched on the very edge of town.  It was clearly closed to visitors, cool and dark, but at a gentle rap from Tony’s hand, the door opened to them.
Tony nodded, like it was not a big deal, but his body language betrayed worry.  “What about Romanoff?”
I tend to change names of small franchises to not besmirch real locations--i.e., a real cider farm becomes a fictionalized cider farm--but in the case of Chicago, there's plenty of character built right into the city that I'll do my best to capitalize on. Still, the proximity of nameless coffee shops and ice cream parlors to the hotel is real, although, like the alpaca farm, I will continue fictionalizing plenty of actual establishments to protect smaller brands from my goofy wrath.
“Here’s your drink,” Steve reminded, sliding the glass closer.  Tony looked down at it, made a single sad noise, and Steve took pity on him.  “All right.  One line.”
“I’m walking with Steve, he’s always lost in thought, anyway,” Tony said, falling back and gluing himself to Steve’s side.
Hulk kept turning to look away from him.  Tony dauntlessly stepped around in front of him for the third time.  “I will buy you ice cream.”  Hulk looked at him intently, as if to say,
Steve waited.  A very polite minute, if he did say so himself.  Then he said: “. . . Most people sleep in a bed.”
When he heard the clicks from above, he stepped outside, staggering across the uneven ground towards the dragon.  Marker met him halfway, pressing his huge head gently against Tony’s torso.
Steve started to fold down his pile—he had no idea what was going on, but he suspected he would be better off keeping his mouth shut and going along with it—when Tony slapped his hand over his, interrupting him.
,” Iron Man protested, jetting into the air to escape, while the yellow lab pounced on Steve with a vengeance, so wiggly and enthusiastic he managed to knock Steve into the grass.  “Lucky, don’t eat him,” Tony added, as the dog writhed on top of Steve, lapping at his face.  “Well, now you’re definitely not getting birthday kisses.”
Tony struggled after him.  Snow stood on the lawn, looking regal and menacing in the moonlight, blinking at him stoically.  Steve approached her with such agitation that she hissed loudly at him, and he paused.
“I’ll buy,” he offered, a compromise he felt transcended time, transcended tastes.  Three sets of eyes affixed on him.  “You—everybody’s gotta eat,” he clarified.  “Let me buy.”
With faint exasperation, Steve explained, “It hasn’t even been a month, Tony.  If I—gave up on them, that easy, then it’s like I—wouldn’t have missed them at all.”  Even saying the words hurt.  But they were also liberating.  Like admitting that they still mattered made their existence more real.  Closer to him.  “I don’t want to grow apart.  I don’t want to let go.”  That was too close.  He backpedaled gently: “If I’m not careful, next thing you know, I’ll start wearing jeans.”
Then one rose and deliberately approached Tony, its walk strangely human.  Humanoid aliens were surprisingly common—
“Ah,” Steve replied.  Then: “Barton’s?”  The yelping returned, but he caught Lucky on the jump, looking around the estate curiously.  “This isn’t New York.”
Steve blinked once, twice, checking that the horse-and-buggy clopping towards them was not a mirage.  “Amish?” he repeated.
Stovok seemed tempted to critique his form or maybe his imprudent manner of execution.  Then he relaxed, kissing back with only a hint of desperation.  Tony slid a hand around his nape, keeping the pressure very light, and Stovok sighed against him.
Tony gave him a very exasperated look.  “Yes, Steve,” he said, which surprised Steve, more than it should have, his own name spoken back to him.  “Of course I do.”
“They are beyond help,” dismissed a third Councilwoman.  “Let the Federation eradicate them, once and for all.  This is the path they have chosen.”
Six dollars and thirty minutes of soap time later, a lone car pulled up to the station.  They all looked over as it pulled into the empty lot and parked about ten paces away from their own pancaked vehicle.
.  He could land just about anywhere in the Universe and be all right with Commander Stovok alongside him.  Apart—it was a very cold place.  “I—” he started.  A Nibiran whooped impatiently behind Stovok.  Stovok released him, and Tony marched up the footpath, clinging to the rocks.  “I can hail them.  If they come in range.  They got my signal once, they can—”
With a sigh, Tony yanked a throw blanket off the back of another couch and chucked it at him haphazardly.  He started to storm off, relieved of duty.
He ran a hand through his hair.  His heart was pounding.  He could not begin to accept that the paradigmatic shift had occurred.
Steve assessed the diagram for a long moment, then looked at Tony thoughtfully.  His gaze fell to Tony’s hand, and Tony looked at it, noticed it trembling.  He flexed it for a moment, working out the kinks, said stiffly, “If I was half my age, I’d do it myself.  At this point, I’m going to be the old hand who sponsors it.”  Suddenly annoyed, he scrapped the document, closed the program, and finished to the darkness, “Kids these days.  Where’s my goddamn dinosaur park?”  Tony stalked off, one hand twisting in his shirt automatically.
Incongruously, Tony started shivering.  “Hey,” Steve said, rubbing his thumb over his shoulder.  “What’sa matter?”
He had almost successfully drifted back into complete indifference when he heard, “Wait, we forgot grandpa,” and groaned privately.
Breathing hard from the chase, Steve watched in mute wonder as Natasha rounded second base and carried on to third.  Tony pointedly stepped out of reach as she neared him, then let out an alarmed yelp as Natasha briefly gave chase before doubling back for an easy home run.
,” Bruce replied.  He did.  As a dragon companion, he understood what was often enigmatic to those who never bonded.  Dragons ruined lives, relationships.  The fascination with them often stemmed from ignorance.
The cloaked figure took one step closer.  Tony tensed, looked away, frustrated.  “There’s nowhere to run from you, is there?  I can’t even find peace here.”
“C’mere,” Tony said, pulling him physically and metaphorically out of his thoughts, half-shoving him into the front seat of a low-lying
Tony made a deeply disgusted sound in the back of his throat, like he would actually spit on the floor, before restraining himself to, “
Steve clasped his wrist in a proper Asgardian greeting.  “It’s good to see you, too, Thor,” he greeted.  “And I’m not that easy to kill.”
“No, you’re very good at it,” Steve protested, taking a single step backwards, towards the hellhole.  “I’ve seen you work.  Got patience for days.”
Thank you very much for continuing to join me on this silly little adventure! I really am having a good time, and I hope you are, too.
“It’s nothin’ new,” Tony said, in a teeth-grindingly placating tone.  He flicked the dial to another station.
Three exhilarating seconds later, Tony was in stitches—not literally, of course, merely halfway to a fit, leaning against the alleyway for support as he wheezed with laughter—while Thor had Steve in a one-armed chokehold.  Then Thor looked down at his captive, said jovially, “Captain!” and Steve realized he would, in fact, get to keep his head another day.  “You bastard!” Thor proclaimed, releasing him and slapping him on the back, sending him face first to the snow.  But Thor laughed and Steve could not help but huff in repressed amusement as he pushed himself back to his feet.
Stiffly, Steve said, “I read what was relevant.”  He did not want to talk about it, how he had not touched his
That, alone, made the stop worth it, and Tony was inconsolably pleased about it, but at least Tony kept his amusement to himself, facing away from the group, hiding a very self-satisfied smirk.  Even Natasha seemed at ease, strolling along the cobblestone garden.
I think that covers all the notes! Hope you liked it, next chapter will be PACKED. Thanks again for reading!
“Nay,” Thor said.  He was aiding Bruce in the removal of candles, mostly by eating them.  “You have arrived.  Exactly as intended.”
Turning to face Stovok, Tony remarked, “I’m feeling deeply patronized, aren’t you supposed to keep the peace?”
“All right,” Steve interjected, when Tony looked thoughtful for a little too long.  “We’re not vigilantes.”
“Bah,” Hulk said, which would have been funny, had he not then decided to leap onto the car and smash it into a pancake.  When the Hulk had finished, he sat down right on top of the flat metal and looked sternly at Steve.
Romanova offered a hand.  Tony warily took it, letting her pull him to his feet.  Then she said, “Positive radiation.”
“Here,” Tony said, reaching over and turning the dial to a station that seemed more static than anything.  “EDM.  Everybody’s favorite.”
Steve sighed.  Then he sniffed—gross—and wiped his nose on his sleeve again.  Looking up, he opened a cabinet, pulled out a box of generic, pre-made cookies, and handed them to Tony.
“I am under no circumstances driving you eight hours to S.H.I.E.L.D.’s front door,” Tony deadpanned.  “Take it or leave it.”
know was Stovok’s warm arms wrapped around him, his warm Vulcan legs on either side of his own freezing human ones.  He hardly dared breathe, unsure what to make of it.  “We’re all going to die.”
Thor wrapped an arm around Steve’s shoulders, then pulled him aside.  “What is a ‘hippy’?” Thor asked.
They never did.  Yet they insisted on putting him through misery.  Would anyone tie a torniquet around their own arm and prick themselves without great incentive?  It was a miserable exercise.  And to think, it could be futile: centrifuges were not oracles.  Centrifuges could only answer questions asked by those speaking on behalf of desperate people, people willing to hurt themselves to find peace.
Thor growled.  “I shall remove your head from your shoulders if you speak to me again in this manner.”
Marker stood, improvised ropes around his shoulders, ready to fly.  His black eyes did not stray from Tony as Tony stepped around him, and in those eyes, he saw his father, looking at Radon, and impressing,
With a mute look of annoyance at the demeaning nature of the summons, Steve nevertheless paused before the telescope, wondering if this was how Galileo felt, once, before pressing the rounded glass to his eye.  Then he leaned down and looked up.
Who knew: maybe the calf would usurp him and claim the throne.  That would be a bit of a scandal, wouldn’t it?  Hell could use a bit of a shake-up.  That was what Tony was doing.
Prowling the outfield, waiting for a chance to make his next hit, Steve heard, “It’s just a game, Blade Runner,” and ignored it.
“Why should we meddle in the affairs of Terrans?” asked an elder of the Vulcan High Council, looking down upon Stovok with open distaste.  “Half-bloods like you may feel sympathy for their distress, but we do not.”
“I like Wisconsin,” Steve offered.  That got Tony to look up.  Steve met his eyes in the rearview mirror.  “I’ve been around,” he defended.
“Come down with me,” Steve repeated, paradoxically stepping forward, up.  “I might torment you.  But I’ll help you, too.  I’ll help you find the peace you’re looking for.  Somewhere that isn’t here.”
,” Tony mused, unable to look away from those pale blue Vulcan eyes, trained on him so very earnestly.  “I don’t know, could have been attacked by
On cue, the door swung open.  “Hey, buddy!” Clint greeted loudly, ignoring Steve’s quelling look.  “Can’t believe you two finally got a room!”  He held up a six pack of cans triumphantly.  “We’re celebrating.  Without you.”
“I am,” Tony said stiffly.  He wanted off the ship.  He felt strange, around Commander Stovok, like something they were not supposed to mention had happened.
Marker opened one huge black eye to look at him, an almost hopeful hum abruptly silencing.  Tony set down Thallium.  She immediately tried to crawl back into Tony’s arms, both forepaws on his legs.  “No,” Tony told her, even as Marker stared at him, expression frozen in time, neither smile nor scowl, an unfriendly, friendly face.  A stranger.  For a delirious, heart-stopping moment, Tony thought,
Steve glared at the signature, then licked his thumb and attempted to scrub it off, ignoring Tony’s amused huff.
Tony liked dangerous things.  Marvelous and strange things, too.  He enjoyed exploring the unknown, enjoyed sitting back on a pleasant evening and watching his superior office engage a race of seemingly unremarkable Terran children on a planet so distant its existence was not known until their arrival.
Another cosmic shift.  Tony recoiled automatically, a full step back, when he found himself standing amid a battlefield, littered with hundreds of bodies.  Stovok walked among them calmly, occasionally crouching to press his fingers against the back of their neck, where the Vulcan carotid was located.  He eventually stopped and looked around, took in the devastation, one of countless Romulan offenses on Federation-protected planets, all done to draw out Earth’s forces, to separate them as much as possible.
“Great,” their guide said.  “Not one of those cruise ships, are you?  Don’t strike me as the Carnival type, but I’ve been wrong before.”
Steve grabbed him by the back of his shirt to pick him up.  Bruce growled, low and leonine.  Steve froze.  Everyone else did, too.  Then Bruce yawned tamely, “I love nature,” and allowed Steve to carefully pick him up.  Steve set him on his feet, giving him a gentle nudge in the right direction.  Bruce went.
“I will expect a full report on the Nibiran contact,” Fury went on.  “Delivered as promptly as possible.  Damage control—”
“Come back to me,” Tony said.  Steve looked at him, held onto his gaze, let him come into focus, because the rest was entangled, unknown, impervious, and wretched, but Tony was
Tony pouted, genuinely put out, before shaking his head at himself.  “Plenty more where that came from.  You got video?”
“Whatever I should do, I should do it with a dragon at my side,” wrote one doting companion.  Yet in the same historical breath, another grieved:
Clint paused mid-shovel to acknowledge, “Yeah, I’m okay with that guy being the future King of Everything.”
“You know what amazes me?” Barnes said.  “We should’ve won this war in three days.  But instead, we’re . . . goddamn, we’re getting our asses kicked.”
Tony paused, back to Steve.  Then Tony deflected, “I’m tired, I’m going to bed.”  He wasn’t tired and he was definitely not going to bed.  He was sore, but he resisted the urge to rub his chest.  It would only make it worse.  “I’m tired,” he repeated out loud.  “I don’t wanna talk about it.”
Tony made a soft noise, drowned out almost entirely by the terrestrial rumble of the volcano.  “We’re not talking about that, are we?” he asked, indicating the caldera with a wave of the hand.
Steve looked skyward for support.  Ol’ Pokey scooted up the tree another foot, in no apparent rush.  It was a two-for-one special, after all.  “No,” Steve insisted.  “You
.  You will come along.  Whether you do so willingly is your prerogative, but know that resistance is futile.”
Even when Steve did not initiate the contact, he permitted it, a gift in its own right.  Pressing both hands against Steve’s back was like . . . sifting two handfuls of sand through his fingers, or maybe gripping a cool decanter of scotch and watching the liquid swirl in the light—grounding, an undeniably real sensation.  So much input was
Not merely the poets would suffer.  The navigators, who looked heavenward for inspiration and consolation, would be stranded on pitch-black nights.  The Earth itself would look vastly different, her spin untrimmed by the resisting tug of the Moon, her waters tepid without the churning pull of an orbiting satellite.  Days would be shorter and nights would be bleaker.  Whole ecosystems, dependent on tidal forces, would simply vanish.
Steve offered to sit on the roof with Smokey, but Tony just rolled his eyes and shooed him into the front passenger seat—all right—and sat on his lap.  “This seems safe,” Steve muttered, one arm wrapped around Tony’s middle to keep him from flying through the windshield.
Honestly, Steve felt that was mean-spirited: Thor had a lovely voice, even if it lost some of its symphonic value as Clint clapped along to the Norwegian equivalent of an Irish drinking song.  There was something charming about it, Steve had to admit, as Thor carried the song and Clint cheered him on every step of the way.
The sub-rigorous application of the monster’s true strength failed.  A second, more rigorous application would not.  Tony knew this.  Tony held on anyway.
The wound on his arm had already begun festering.  Another round of antibiotics, he thought, massaging his right arm.  The scars from a much larger bite were still visible.  He had tangled with a wild dragon, seeking to swallow the hatchling entrusted to his care; he was lucky to still have his arm to show for it.
It was a sure strikeout, Steve knew, as Clint wound back his arm and launched the tennis ball towards Natasha, still waiting at the plate.  Sure enough, the tennis ball streaked past Bruce, mere yards from the base, and—kept going, uncontested, as Natasha stood her ground and Bruce skidded to a halt on the base.
“I did not lose him,” Tony defended, turning back to the tribesmen and flinching as they stared back.  “You don’t think they—ate him, do you?”
Steve focused on the more immediate problem at hand.  “Tony, don’t encourage him,” Steve said, as Tony held up his telephone and instructed:
, he decided, slightly nervous he might actually pass out before Steve returned, heart still beating too fast.
Finally, he said, “C’mon,” and moved.  Tony did not make a sound, too caught up in his own shaking to protest as Steve shifted out from under him.  Waking up his legs with a few hardy thrashes, Steve disconnected the wires and scooped up the Iron Man, surprised at how light he felt—part of him expected Tony to feel even lighter, yet another part of him remembered already,
) cardigan.  Steve had no complaints about the light-colored shirt underneath it, but the blue jeans were ranchers’ attire, miners’ equipment, as out-of-place on the showroom floor as a bathrobe in a bank.
care,” Iron Man said, as at least six ducklings followed them, all wearing their plague beaks and holding up their cell phones.  Choosing his words carefully, Tony added, “I just think that,
Tony grumbled, then deliberately leaned into Stovok’s shoulder.  Even through the suit, Tony felt the muffled blue of irritation, the deep gray of volcanic uncertainty, before Stovok stood and approached the copilot’s chair, breaking the contact.  The brief red flicker of worry did not escape Tony’s notice, but he chose not to comment on it.
in popularity, due to their sturdier build and higher carriage, which modern buyers regard as highly desirable traits.
“It’s very real,” Thor rumbled, speaking to no one.  “And I shall best it once again in combat, with Stark as my witness.”
And they didn’t talk about it, didn’t need to delve into all the ooey gooey ugly mess of feelings, of,
Put him on a starship, give him free reign and enough credits to make Admiral Fury steam, and Tony Stark could make magic come to life.
And then, like magic, a basket of spare ribs materialized.  Steve perked up immediately in the booth, but Tony preemptively swiped the basket from him.  Steve frowned at him, but Tony warned, “You bite these in half, I will bite you,” and Steve thought,
“Tony!” Steve called, hurrying after him.  Tony did not pause.  Steve caught up, caught him by the arm, and said in a low voice, “Absolutely not.”
Thor nodded, then seemed to brighten visibly at the prospect, even though Steve knew that there would be no
, Steve thought, resisting the urge to stomp his feet or shove his hands under his arms as he paced around the tarmac in a leather jacket.
Steve breathed easily, shield at the ready, guarding his chest, his throat.  “You may want to consider a different wardrobe,” Hill advised.  “If you’re serious about laying low.”
Tony patted Bruce on the back, assuring, “You won’t have time to worry about the storm.  We will all be dead in a ditch.”
, Steve wanted to tell him, but he let Bruce hold on.  He had dealt with more than one frightened soldier, more than one Captain America fanatic.
“Tell Fury to lay off,” Steve said at last, grateful for how measured his tone was.  “I don’t care what his motives are, I don’t care if he’s worried—the situation is under control.”
, he was supposed to be in his lab, deep in thought or on the verge of sleep.  He would gladly have summoned Natasha to take care of business if she had not threatened to neuter him the next time he so much as texted her after midnight, and he would sooner adopt an Old World tarantula than give
A very warm hand settled over Steve’s wrist, near his limp-fingered hold on the shield.  He could dig out the steel foundations from their concrete encasements without loss of personal integrity.  It horrified people, when they saw how tough the serum had made him.  But the hand settled on his with a sort of implacable innocence, immune to fear.
Although the path was short, the walk back was long, but Steve did not rush it, and honestly, there was something to be said about a leisurely walk with one’s sweetheart.
In a little over two hours, the sun would be up.  It was enough time to slip onto the couch or even the floor and catch some z’s, but Steve felt uneasy without a posted guard.
Realization dawned on Stovok.  Tony could feel his surprise in the air—red, like the Briar Patch.  “You left the planet?”
Steve was tempted to chuck him on the ground and be done with it, if only there would not be consequences to his actions.  “Well, what
smell like flowers.  An abundance of flowers—hearty stick-to-the-tongue honeysuckle, soft dusty wisteria, a whisper of lemony four o’clocks, a breath of dewdrop lavender.
“Please tell me that’s not real,” Dr. Banner implored from the very back of the vessel, as far from Thor as he could get.  “The lizard monster can’t be—”
Wondering what life forms might have inhabited the doomed world was what kept Tony up at night.  Life wanted to propagate; life feared extinction, erasure above all else.  Confronted with proof of the Universe’s unflinching violence, Tony felt weirdly unmoored.
They just sat and waited as the smell of cookies permeated the air, and the heartbeat of the world ticked on, and something good and easy brewed between them.
Tony’s breath wheezed in his chest in terror, and he thought for a moment of having to file the report alone,
Steve Rogers had his own bedroom, his own private den, but he liked to stay there, with Tony, to be beside him at night and share a few hours before drifting apart for his own nightly cycle.  He was too restless to sleep when Tony was there, but he drowsed, big-cat-like, eyes nearly shut, a warm space heater for Tony to curl into.
about it, and the field grass was soft, anyway.  Then, in fairness, he fell backwards, just in time for bloodhound number one to trundle over and snuffle at him.  “Hey, puppy,” he greeted, smiling when Jeremiah sniffed at his hair.  “Hey.”
Not to be outdone by New York or Los Angeles, Chicago led the Nation in wartime production—and bought war bonds by the bucketful.  An easy market to win over and an even easier city to like, the Chicago of his memories had been culturally vibrant and economically booming.
And then, just like that, Stovok shuffled into the sand and hauled him forcefully into the sunlight.  Tony squeezed his eyes shut against the light, even though he gasped with relief, nearly hugging the ground in gratitude.
According to a helpful pamphlet, the Niagara River had an average current speed of four knots.  Given that the threshold for a fast-moving river was
The colors faded to black and white, empty, almost blank, and Tony ripped his hand away belatedly, surprised to find the world around him, the cathedral silence in his head.  He looked around at the white trees with their red leaves, the dark earthy ground, and then back at Stovok, whose eyes had slipped shut again.
It was an odd asynchronicity.  The airy space was almost stiflingly warm, but the cold was low, in his bones, perforating outward.  He chafed a palm over his arm to warm it.
Then a voice, clicking, high-pitched, and the little Nibiran scattered, piping back gleefully.  There were noises of relief and scolding, and then the last of the Nibirans moved on.
“OK, let’s take five,” Steve said, pressing a button on the camera that did absolutely nothing.  In the same voice that once made an alien dictator pale three shades, Steve growled, “
has already done the bulk of the preliminary search,” Romanova reported, “and located five gravity wells in the target area that are consistent with planetary bodies.  One appears to be a dwarf star.  The plan is to start on the outer edge and work our way in.”
“All right, losers,” Tony began, swinging a baseball bat in a loose arc, standing in a semi-lit baseball field.  “Let’s—”
This really was Hell, Tony thought peevishly, hooking both legs over the arm of the human skull throne.  He could bring fire to the underlings, but why should he?  Then the next bastard would complain about how hot it was and find a way to cool it off.  Endless cycle.
At 0730, the President left to attend other matters.  Dutifully, Steve lingered, chatting with the remaining VIPs, who could barely contain their excitement at his proximity.  When an ice-breaker asked for a self-portrait, Steve insisted they be taken in the gardens, where the lighting was better.  First, he paid a brief visit to the kitchens, where he thanked the staff and signed the chefs’ aprons with an artistic rendering of
Steve growled, a wordless protest, like he wanted to hurt Tony just for the chance to hurt himself.  Exercising his compassion muscles, Tony squeezed his hand hard and said, “Look at me.”  Steve did, gaze flicking up without lifting his head.  His eyes were incredibly blue.  They had an almost iridescent quality to them, at night, that made them hard to look away from, especially since he blinked less often than the average person, but:
Despite years of surveying, it remained an unbreachable vacuum, indifferent to their attempts to negotiate with it.  Full of pinpricks of light and even smaller collections of celestial dust, some home to life, some of which was naïve enough to believe itself capable of controlling the game, space was beyond understanding.  It was terrifying.  And exhilarating.
, he thought dryly, but Tony Stark would surrender the shirt off his back before he would surrender the wheel.  Not that it would be a fair trade: the shirt on Tony’s back was
Steve knew precious little about Alaska.  But he knew precious little about most things.  Most of what he knew about the world was raw knowledge, the kind acquired with his own two hands.  Distant lands full of distant people—those were things he read about but never expected to truly inhabit.
“I would refrain from eating or drinking,” Carter reminded.  “Until you have reconvened with the starship.”
, Tony thought affectionately.  “Steve can kick Kevin’s ass,” Tony went on.  To his eternal credit, Steve frowned at the word choice more than the actual swing.
“Missed you, too,” Tony said, staying where he was and noticing a flashlight over Bruce’s shoulder, Clint’s voice whining in the near distance:
Carter continued to look at Stovok, who finally said coolly, “I believe his mental faculties are intact.”
Steve looked over, but the voice came from a woman seated behind the counter, arms folded across her chest.
Without bitterness, Tony allowed himself to float back down to the ground.  Taking off the helmet, he stepped inside the manor and removed the rest of his armor.
There were bikes, too; lots and lots of bikes.  Steve looked at them with more than passing interest—Harley-Davidson had survived the War, he was pleased to note—and wondered what had become of his own.  He doubted S.H.I.E.L.D. would leave it to rot, but it made his stomach twist to think of even his

Splitting his attention between the circus trio and Tony Stark, Steve recited the report from memory.  Even the irrelevant stuff, like,
.”  Doubling over, Tony hacked up a lung.  Steve took pity on him, fetching him a glass of water.  Tony shook his head, holding up a quelling hand and asserting through a wheezy breath, “I am an unkillable
Their guide spared him the need to say something: “We ought to turn back.  It’ll be getting dark soon.  You boys have a place to stay?”
That got him going: Steve had only to walk and nod while Thor relayed his experiences with a rather large assortment of horrifying creatures on faraway worlds.  He had bested all of them in combat, although he did not shy from admitting, “It was on my third encounter with the Ak’ak’chu’la’for that I prevailed over it.”  Steve saw him look at the informational placards with a zeal that almost matched his own, absorbing every word with interest.  “I was under the false premise that Midgard was devoid of monsters,” Thor admitted, which almost made Steve feel guilty for not explaining the obvious:
Tony approached without caution, unafraid of another bite or even a full-fledged attack.  Tellurium—
game we could find,” Tony interjected.  Tony then picked up his chair and set it down extremely close to Steve’s.  Rather than finding the proximity annoying, Steve found it weirdly comforting.
Shrugging, Tony said, “Oh, they’re long gone.  Halfway to Nebraska by now.”  At Steve’s unimpressed expression, he added, “C’mon,
“Not so worried about first contact?” Tony asked Stovok, resisting the urge to double over and gasp for breath.  He wasn’t twenty anymore, and these uphill climbs were hell on the knees.
” Thor announced, speaking at a cadence that indicated he had not heard Tony’s humbler contribution.  “
“Mm-hm.”  Tony waved a hand.  “Which is easier, harvesting lumber or repurposing it?”  Then, almost apologetically, he stepped forward and rested a hand on the car’s yellow roof.  “Not that I would.  I’m such a
Mayor Cuff had a wonderful way of speaking, easygoing but meandering, never so straightforward as to become droll.  If he had asked for the rights to tell Steve’s life story, Steve might have handed them over, then and there.
A hysterical laugh bubbled out of Dr. Banner, anyway.  Tony understood it, even if the sound sent nails against his spine.  With a barely audible, almost missable sigh, Stovok stepped forward and pinched the good Doctor on the neck.  Dr. Banner’s expression did not have time to register the blow; he simply dropped, limp, and Stovok lowered him carefully to the ground.
“It caught fire,” Clint said, clasping Tony on the shoulder before yelping as Tony shocked him with his pen.  Steve needed one of those.
At last, Thor relieved him by scooping up Mjolnir.  Steve let Clint drop; Thor tossed the hammer once into the air, silently considering something.  “What plans have you for us, Stark?” he asked, tone very odd, trying and failing to be idle.
“Pitstop,” Clint agreed, tapping the little hearing aids.  “I wanna fly.  Like, all the time.  Step on it, genius-man.”
Nobody at the table moved.  Except Tony: he flattened his arms on the table and rested his chin on them sulkily.  “What?” Steve asked him.  When Tony grumbled inaudibly, he nudged him.  Tony sunk deeper into his arms.
“Well, if he dies, he asked for it,” Barton said dryly, but he seemed almost acquiescent, like he, too, trusted in the plan.  A moment later, the prickly, cold water feeling of being unmade was offset by stepping foot on a terrestrial world.
.  He let go as quickly as he dared, Stovok’s hands steadying his waist as he backed up.  “So, I found a fruit.”
Gripping his chest over his heart, Tony flicked the ship into autopilot and spun furiously to face the stowaway.  Stovok looked unrepentant, holding onto an overhead strap and looking down at Tony without malice or surprise.  “I will have to make a note in my report—”
He passed Clint, who whooped after him.  He kept going, running until he felt hot-blooded instead of cold-, until he felt
Before Steve could gently explain that the Liberty Bell was a very fragile historical artifact and not used to announce anything, Tony piped in, “Sorry, pal, it’s in the wrong direction.”  Then he hooked an arm around Bruce’s shoulders and told him, “You know what I’m thinking.  Pittsburgh steel.
Clint made a spirited attempt to break free of Steve’s hold.  Steve tightened his grip in response, grumbling, “Hey,
Thor inclined his head—“As you were, Captain”—and took off after Clint.  Clint yelped and fled, unwittingly leading the god along with the tennis ball in hand.
Steve shut the door on him.  Standing immediately on the other side, Bruce blinked up at Steve hopefully.  “What?” Steve snapped.
Narrowing his eyes, Stovok said, “It is not something we discuss with outsiders.”  Then he looked back down into the pit of hell, frozen over.
“Jeremiah!” Coleman repeated.  Steve kept a perfectly flat expression on his face as the bloodhound brought back the freshly-tossed shoe, covered in slobber.
Then it was off to the gardens.  The rest of the party was waiting for him, including the President’s own
They were allowed a full hour in the well-guarded restaurant before Steve’s handler barged in.  Steve already knew why, but he feigned indifference as he listened to them reiterate the itinerary.  When he noticed the literal beads of sweat on the handler’s brow, he caved with a polite, “Give me a minute.”  The handler bowed and fled before Steve could change his mind.  Steve sighed, looked at Sam apologetically, and said, “Duty calls.”
Steve glanced at the nightstand.  “Five-to-seven,” he said.  He gave Tony’s leg another tug.  “C’mon.  Let’s go.”
the day he took Tony Stark’s hand in marriage—but he saw the way Tony smiled, that old impish smirk, a little more crooked but no less real for it, and thought,
The gears turned again in Tony’s head, as he observed the half-strapped splint and the slow but steady way Steve brushed his arm, a ginger touch but an insistent one.
Easing the door open, Steve used his palm to suppress the natural creakiness of the wood.  He surveyed the rest of the room briefly.  Even with the lights off, there was more than enough moonlight drifting in beneath the drawn curtains to illuminate Clint and Bruce on the sole bed.  Bruce had hidden his head underneath a pillow, while Clint had sprawled on top of the covers, both arms outstretched in a territorial claim.  Clint made no sound, but Bruce snored into the mattress.
.  Tony had been resting for weeks.  He could not make himself work, could not escape the fog of unwellness, lost in those three damnable words:
He saw his companion in the human tribe sitting in an armchair, reading a book by moonlight.  Tony interrogated, “Why are you up?”
He listened, anyway, like a telegraph receiving an encoded message, his attention totally focused on Tony as he drew.  He was meticulous about it, but he added each layer on top of the previous one, complaining briefly, “I can’t splice this,” before flipping to another page, hastily drawing his original wheel, and carrying on at a new level of detail.
He shook with a violent shudder, rattling the desk at his back.  A pleading tone entered the monster’s voice: “I don’t want you to suffer, Tony.”
Tony pulled out his telephone, pulled up the strange blue map, and then pocketed it with a nod.  “Okay,” he said, getting up.  Steve watched him.  Tony arched both eyebrows expectantly.
Not one of them had the heart to stop him.  Tony did say, “If we set a forest on fire, let it be known, I said—”  He perked up when Bruce set a plate of cake in front of him, evidently forgetting his ire.  “About fucking time.”
The loneliness of the shore was palpable without Dr. Banner and Stovok to keep him company.  Scowling, Tony kicked at the sand, which was hard enough it felt like kicking a rock.  Cursing, he paced back and forth, refusing to even look at the hole in the ground.
Tony seethed out a wordless hiss, like he could not bring himself to even come up with a word vile enough for Steve or “the cat.”  “I’ll be back,” Steve assured.
They followed the Ba’ku to an open-air dining hall, where perhaps a hundred members were already eating.  They paused to ogle Thor, then returned to their meal.
kind of motion.  “And I feel like I’ve done the bulk of the work,” he went on, indicating the nearly overflowing bowl.  “Wouldn’t you say so?”
Tony was asleep in their bed.  Steve wanted to be satisfied, relieved that Tony was OK, but the worst day of his life had begun with Tony asleep in their bed, a soft kiss to his temple and a mute promise to be back, but by the time Steve had returned, Tony had not been asleep but unconscious.
.  He almost wished Stovok had not pinched him in the first place; if he had been dragged through, kicking and screaming, he might have at least internalized,
with him, to spend so much time with a pack of lunatics who enjoyed spelunking.  Team bonding experiences were never predictable, but he liked seeing what kind of orchard-picking, bronco-busting, cross-country-pork-eating adventures they would get up to, without his direct oversight.
Lucky yelped and ran off to greet the newcomer.  Steve tossed Tony off his back, then turned to face Natasha.  “Tasha?”
Steve inclined his head the barest fraction.  Then he looked at Rhodey.  “I’ll be back,” Rhodey said.
If he had a fishing pole, Steve would net and haul Clint himself.  As it was, he could only watch in frustrated horror as Clint disappeared from view.  “And it’s goddamn beautiful!” Clint added buoyantly.
Tony thought, jamming his fingers against the side of Stovok’s neck, the bottom dropping out of his world when he felt nothing, no trace of a pulse.  Even as white noise fogged his ears and panic clouded his judgment, he slid his fingers around to Stovok’s nape, where, steady and strong, Stovok’s pulse thrummed.
“Uh-uh,” Tony protested, his voice carrying much better without the noisy drone of the machine.  “You put that down.  You
Stovok did not respond.  He did, however, change shirts—and Tony tried, oh-so-hard, not to look, but he looked, as Stovok slid his command gold and insulating black shirt off, and replaced them with a simple white dress shirt.  It made him look strangely human, even as he pulled on a navy-blue jacket, with his Commander’s insignia clear on the shoulder.
“Keeping it—like that.”  Realizing he was dancing, skipping around the question, Steve said frankly, “Making sure the armor doesn’t go anywhere you don’t want it to.”
Dr. Banner covered his mouth fearfully, and Tony snarled audibly at him, biting into the meat of his hand.  “You idiot,” Tony whispered.  “You could’ve been killed.”  Already hauling himself to his feet, he insisted, “C’mon, we have to—”  Whoops, excited, nearby, and accompanied by flying spears, made Tony nearly piss his uniform.  “Oh, for the love of God,” he seethed, then yelled openly as Dr. Banner made a break for it—thankfully in the right direction, but, still.  “BANNER!”
Tony just thumped him on the back of a shoulder and said, “Giraffes,” like he might choke on his laughter if he held it in any longer.
“Ohhh, don’t tell me you’re afraid of a little puppy dog,” Steve drawled, laughing at the realization as soon as the words left his mouth.  Tony tried shushing him, but Steve just laughed, unable to help himself, a little giddy and more than a little amused at the notion of the great
And it probably had something to do with the fact that the Avengers were the biggest celebrities in town.
He felt a tremendous urge to see the hatchling grown, saw in his mind’s eye a full-grown Tellurium, high in the sky, a giant that feared no predator.
Shaking his head in disbelief, Tony said, “God damn, God damn, God damn,” until Steve turned around and hugged him back.
There was a prolonged silence, the kind that tumbleweeds drifted over.  There were no tumbleweeds this far North.
“Sir,” Happy said somberly, “it’s my job to be observant.”  He flicked a glance at Steve.  “What’s your job?”
“No,” Tony said at last, pushing himself to his feet with a great exertional huff, “you haven’t earned that.”
Tony set down the clock and reached for his pocket, pulling out a telephone.  “I’m on it.  Anyone else craving seafood?”
Tony stared him down, arms folded across his chest.  “No,” Tony said at last.  “You have to earn it.”
“I understood the meaning,” Stovok dismissed.  He frowned.  “You mean to say this is Terra-like?”  He actually seemed disappointed.
Face twisted in a grimace, Rogers managed, “I—hurt you, Tony.”  Looking at the reactor, paling visibly, he added, “I wouldn’t’ve done it, Tony, you know that, if it wasn’t your
Bruce looked dolefully at Steve.  “What?” Steve asked, keeping his voice as neutral as possible.  Bruce still flinched.
“Here, let me—there’s a—”  Tony forced his eyes open as Rogers leaned over him, disheveled, chalk-dusted, looking like a puppy that had been dragged out of a dumpster and left on his doorstep.  He tangled a hand in his tattered uniform.  Rogers gingerly deflected his grip, getting a hold of the attached remote on Tony’s right side instead.  “Sorry, shouldn’t lean over—”  Sitting back, Rogers held up the remote triumphantly, then frowned at it, like an old man without his glasses, before pressing a button and setting the remote aside with a half-shrug.  “There.  Now.”  Without self-consciousness, he returned his hand to Tony’s free one, squeezing.  “You with me?”
.  An awful crackling noise, an awful splintering sensation almost made him stop, but his Tony hissed out, “Keep going,” and he did.
The clerk took him back to a room.  “This is nice,” Steve said, having never seen twenty cats in the same room before.
is a six-letter word for ‘white whale,’” Clint insisted, shoving himself between the front seats and pawing around for the newspaper in Tony’s hands.  “Hipster capital’s gotta start with a B.”
, Tony promised him, gritting his teeth as he transferred his own weight into a wheelchair for the first time.
“Better go even out the odds, then, huh?” Tony said, moving to stand, but Stovok put a stilling hand on his shoulder.
.  Tony shivered, compressed his own chest, a loose approximation of a hug.  He hated ghost stories.  “But you . . . you’re different,” Steve ground out.  A hand appeared over the back of the couch.  Tony pressed himself against the wall, alarmed, but Steve followed, leveraging himself up with clear effort, a silhouette, a rictus of discomfort.  “No one was there when you broke, were they, Tony?”
There was something approachable about him, making it easy for Steve to approach him, clasp him on the shoulder, and wordlessly remind him that they could not stay forever in Amish country.
“No, I am not,” Steve said stubbornly, aware that he was probably two wrong moves away from a real penitentiary.  God damn twenty-first century and its god damn rules.  Whatever happened to a little trust?  A little understanding?  He breathed the wrong way, it ended up in the paper.  Huffing—
Desperate, he tapped the little insignia on his uniform, drawing the alien’s gaze.  “Starfleet,” he said.  “Star-Fleet.”
“Not without you.”  Another step closer.  The light dimmed noticeably.  “You have so much to live for, Tony.  You have a family.”
Little Bushel Alpaca Farm was home to more than fifty alpacas.  “Started with three.  Kept growin’ from there,” Linda explained.  “Been in business since 2004.”
possessions being repossessed.  He knew they had a museum exhibit dedicated to Captain America’s legacy; he did not like to think that Steve Rogers’ footprints were being likewise collected for posterity.
, Steve thought, although it was tempting, so very tempting, to reach for the fraying edge of Tony’s proverbial coat and pull it back, to see what the great Tony Stark did not want him to see.
“We can dance all day, Sojef,” Anij replied.  “I would rather dance and drink, if it is all the same to you.”
Missed you guys! Man, it feels like forever when I'm away for more than a day. I've been working so hard on this chapter, and I am so excited to give it to you! Whoo-hoo! It's here! Get hype! It's 10k! Yes, you read that right! 10k!!
” he repeated, but the god did not acknowledge them a second time.  Scowling, Steve removed his jacket and tossed it aside.  “You
“I vote we take our ch-chances with the n-natives,” Tony submitted, arms folded furiously across his chest, wishing desperately he had a parka.  His all-black uniform was only thick enough in the ambient coolness of the starship; on warm planets, it sufficed, but on colder ones, it failed to retain much body heat.
amount of sincerity, Tony corrected himself.  He needed to stop reading into it.  Vulcans were made of stone.  Almost literally—there was hardly anything else to work with on barren, superheated Vulcan but stone.  Stark men, supposedly, were made of iron, but Tony could point to his lovely space suits and then his own flesh and blood and draw the distinction.  “Proceed, Stark.  I do not want to make you.”
Stovok gave him a palpably unimpressed look behind the mask.  “We will most certainly be logging our journey, regardless of the outcome.”
“God damn,” Clint said, his tone completely different, the biting, tired edge gone.  “He’s out.  Get him out of there.”
“Starfleet can also provide protection,” Liaison Hill went on.  The Ba’ku hardly took their eyes off her, and Tony couldn’t blame them.  Although tactfully immune to most aliens’ charms, he could appreciate the incredible empathy that was innately part of the Betazoid race.  They did not merely speculate; they felt the fear, the hope, and even the joy of the affected parties.  It made her invaluable in the emissary.  Although Tony did
.  He already had enough on his plate, a damnably large amount of misery to grapple with, without their good will and—
into your speech, we wouldn’t be here,” Steve said, unscrewing the cookie jar lid and stealing one of Tony’s
It was so far below the ice that it was nearly darkness, yet there was still enough blue light to easily navigate the icy room.
A tiny, almost missable smile quirked the corner of Steve’s lips.  “You make me happy to be with you,” he acknowledged.
The keeper just said, “They’re squealers,” and offered Steve another bucket of apple slices.  “Watch the horns—they’ll gouge ya.”
Some places, Tony said, were seeing record shortages on salmon; others had more than they knew how to eat.  It was the story of the new world: a patchwork place, a place of famine and fullness, of “salmon and shortage.”  Steve thought about crossing out the original simplified note in his journal, then drew a line to the bottom of the page and wrote,
The suit politely pinned Steve’s legs to the couch.  With an impressive amount of force, given the use of only one arm, Steve promptly rocket-launched Tony into the air.
“I thought you two walked off’a the face of the Earth,” Steve greeted Thor and Clint, two-and-a-half less-than-exhilarating hours later, as they parked outside a little convenience store.  He promptly grimaced as he was enveloped in a hug, telling Clint, “All right, that’s enough, I didn’t die.”  Prying him off was easy: Clint turned his attentions on Natasha, who, once more, flipped him effortlessly over a shoulder, sending him into the grass.
“If it was easy,” Steve said philosophically, “everyone would do it.”  Then, with a tired sigh, Steve added, “I don’t think we’ll have any more trouble from Mr. Stone.”
“Okay,” Tony said, giving him a two-handed shove from behind, slipping around him to drag Clint off the bed.  Clint hit the floor with an audible
Tony moved obligingly off to one side, flopping down on the bed next to him, enjoying the space.  Steve blinked at him once, gaze flickering over him from head to heel.  Effortlessly pretty, Tony thought, feeling almost soporific, comfortably at rest.
Cap placed a comforting hand on the back of his shoulders, before retracting it.  Tony struggled upright, alone, cold, and unmoored, until Cap rested a steadying hand on his back, lower but no less chaste.  Tony turned to him, antsy, and frowned.  Then he licked his thumb and used it to wipe the dirt he had kicked under Cap’s eye.
, but she folded down next to him instead, shoulder-to-shoulder.  Rage caught up to him for a moment, and he wanted to tell her he was not hurt, that she needed to go where she was needed, he could hold down his own for however-long-it-took.
, or you’re going straight back to the med bay,” Tony told him.  That, clearly, was beyond whatever messaging machine was receiving on behalf of Steve Rogers.  Steve’s hand did not budge.  “Let me,” Tony repeated, pushing his hand against Steve’s.
“You’re too big,” Tony told him.  Marker clicked at him curiously.  “No, you’re too big,” he insisted.  “Go back to bed.  I’ll be out in a bit.”  Once the ache in his back died down.
Tony got dressed and was almost out the door for some much-needed fresh air, when green Thallium poked her head into the room.
Steve’s hands shook as he gathered up his coat.  He did not need it, but he hated not having one around.  Who knew what would happen if he woke up in the arctic without one?
, Steve mused, watching the sun set over the horizon while Natasha rode shotgun and Tony and Bruce put their heads together in the backseat, looking at a telephone.
“Captain,” Steve said without missing a beat.  “United States Army.”  Then, crumpling the empty burger wrapper, he finished, “I’m on leave.”
After a brief moment, he felt the touch of two fingertips against his index and middle finger.  They withdrew before he could comment on it.
dinosaurs, then there was likely no adequate comparison for the bones alone.  “Yeah.  Yeah, these are monsters,” he impressed.
The monster scraped its claws against the door gently.  “I just want to help,” the monster insisted softly.
Grumbling, Tony retreated to his own lab, then gave up on it, too sore to sit at the bench.  That was the price he paid for being with dragons, he thought, shaking his head.
“And how dearly I should miss our friendship!” Thor chortled, clasping Bruce’s knee.  “I fear many of my own kin have become accustomed to a certain hospitality.  I embrace the perils of off-worlding,” he stated proudly, releasing Bruce, who had paled several shades but seemed unharmed.  “Your people are my people.  As the future Ruler of the Nine Realms, I am at home among them.”
“Don’t slip,” Tony said quietly, as if speaking too loudly would amplify the danger.  The rock shelf narrowed instantly, from a comfortable lip to a nauseatingly narrow footpath, clearly carved by many travelers over centuries of traverses.  Tony noticed that a groove had formed along the wall, the work of thousands of grasping hands, daring to venture where no man had ever gone before.
“I love you,” Tony interrupted, honest but sincere.  “And I accept your offer.  To Terra Incognita,” he toasted, holding up his hydration pack.  “We’ll be pirates.”
“You ever consider dyeing yours?” Natasha asked, as Tony lifted the backpack out of Steve’s hold and carried it off.
Taking a laidback approach for once, Tony thumbed a duck-billed dinosaur over his shoulder.  “Finally found something older than you,” Tony said.
Tony said, “Oh, yeah, this is all the rage nowadays,” with a convincing poker face, but the way his hand shook with repressed laughter as he reached for the dial gave him away.  To Steve’s chagrin, Tony turned the dial up to an insufferable volume.  “Doesn’t it just
Tony hesitated, hand hovering over the side of his face again, tempted beyond reason before resting it firmly on Stovok’s covered shoulder.  Shame welled up inside him, guilt at taking what had not even been given, but, desperate to defend himself, he reasoned that Stovok could have broken his hand, if he so disliked the intrusion.
,” Tony insisted, quickly taking a bite before Steve could steal it.  He moaned euphorically.  “Oh, my God.  It’s even better than I remembered.”
Steve gave him a stern look.  Might have been more menacing if he was not still a little blotchy in the face, wet of the eye.  Ick.  Poet, thine name was not Anthony Edward.  Waiting until Steve’s back was turned, Tony creaked back to his feet.  “Sit.  Down,” Steve ordered.
,” somehow worming out of Steve’s grip and scrambling onto Steve’s back, both feet off the ground.  “Get the dog away,
Steve and Clint exchanged a look.  Clint sidled half a step closer to Steve, like it would afford any privacy in the wide open field, and asked seriously, “You ever seen that guy
“Of course it’s fair,” Steve said, leaning up on very tippy toe to set the bowl on top of the cabinet.
Shaking his head, Tony said, “You could have told us not to report it.  The cloak-and-dagger approach seems brash.”
“Hullo,” Steve greeted the pet store clerk, holding a rain-soaked Rico under one arm and an empty cardboard box in the other.  “Do you sell cat litter?”
Steve said, “You’re kidding.”  At Tony’s unchanging expression, Steve’s frown deepened.  “. . . You’re not kidding.”
Steve heard the crack and flinched; Tony liberated Happy’s gun in a surprisingly quick movement, and for a moment Steve thought they really were on the same team, taking down a bad guy, but then Tony pointed the gun at the floor and ground out, “Not another
Stovok sighed behind his mask.  Thor went on, “I must reclaim my lost honor.  Will you accompany me to the land of the Gorn?”
Surprised, Steve acknowledged from the forest floor, “You’ll tell me why you don’t like God, but not dogs?”
was the crown jewel of the Federation, and she would prove dearly missed, should her disappearance prove irreversible.  The act was more than posturing—it was a declaration of war.
“Hey,” Steve greeted, relief oozing from his voice.  A small echo of a smile appeared on Natasha’s face as she replied:
It did not matter that it was impossible to find a dragon that did not want to be found.  It was not magic; it was simple fact.  Dragons were sleek, cunning, and experts at camouflage.  From a young age, Tony had known that dragons were good at hiding—they had to be, to survive against covetous humans.  Even a relatively large animal, like Marker, was miniscule when compared to the vast continent below.
“Now, see here, I haven’t committed to anything,” Steve reminded Howard Stark’s son, who paused, then turned to look at Steve.  He really did look like his father.  Trim up the beard, affect an air of,
Sighing tolerantly, Steve stepped onto Iron Man’s wide boots and slid his arms around his waist.  “You like making me need you,” Steve accused.
Then Tony sat down by the nearest—admittedly very pretty—fountain and complained about his feet hurting some more.
Sighing, Steve reached up, but instead of throttling Tony, he simply rested a hand on the back of his neck, at the base of that frenetic, genius mind.
The cabin door was locked.  It was early enough that Steve could forgive Bruce and Natasha for not immediately rousing to let them in,
“What, you think I’m a wuss?”  Tony’s voice was only a touch hysterical as a louder, more ominous rumble removed Tony’s hand from Stovok’s shoulder, seemingly of its own accord.  “All yours, Spunky.”
Thunderstruck, the junior engineer wheeled over to his control panel.  Tony stepped back onto the platform.
It disappeared when a boy, no older than seven, came running up to him.  “Come play!” he said, breathless but earnest, tugging on Stovok’s sleeve.  Stovok stared at him blankly for a moment, like he had never seen a child before, before rising smoothly to his feet.  Sojef opened his mouth, but Anij squeezed his wrist, and he closed it.
Thor did, doubling back to sweep up the tennis ball.  Bruce kept running.  Steve thought about calling out to him that the coast was clear, then shook his head.  Bruce would figure it out.
Quick warning: here there be alcohol. No shenanigans beyond the usual tomfoolery--so, a bit of drunken silliness, but nothing particularly scandalous--and alcoholism will not be a major plot, but I felt I had to mention it.
me?” Tony mused, sitting next to him at the outdoor bar.  He had worked out a brace that allowed him to sit comfortably for hours at a time—a remarkable improvement, given his restrictions to lying down or standing upright for months prior.  He felt almost normal again, able to do most things that he could do with a fancy car battery in his chest.  Jumping jacks were a no-go, but tinkering with his suits was back on the table.
Control was the gift.  This was the precious proximity that millions coveted—to be so near the living legend!  Captain America had inspired
“If you choose to stay here, you will have—a place,” Tony said at last, words stilted, waving a hand like he could find the ones he needed.  “I’m not making any promises that you’ll
He did not want to choose between them—he hated the thought of choosing between them and sanity and Tony and whatever blurry insanity was on his mind—but Natasha spared him.  “Volkov boyat’sya—v les ne khodit’,” she said, her voice smooth, smoothing over, as near to forgiveness as he would find.  She stood.
“Aye,” Thor agreed, laughing when Tellurium suddenly jabbed him in the knee.  “I like this one!” he repeated.  “She is spirited.  A true
“Merry Christmas to you, too,” Tony said tightly.  “Yeah, coffee’s good.  Sure as shit won’t be sleepin’.”
Tony shivered and said nothing.  Sitting down at his feet, Steve rested a hand over the blankets for a long moment, weighing his options.  He could not even tell if Tony was asleep; the helmet was truly a mask, hiding everything from view.
Stroking a hand along the silk-smooth hood of another futuristic car, he thought about mentioning how nice it was that people still drove cars in the Twenty-Hundreds.  Had he speculated, he would have guessed that ground cars would have gone the way of the covered wagon, the horse-and-buggy.
Natasha stood, just slowly enough that Steve only bristled when she took a step closer.  She reached for his non-shield arm, rested a cool, delicate hand over his wrist.  “It’s been a long day, Cap,” she said, her words almost mesmerizing in their cadence, calm and self-assured.  “Wash up.  Get some rest.”
“Well,” Steve said, when neither Bruce nor Tony moved.  “I had hoped to find some peace and quiet.”  He stood up and reentered the log cabin, letting the door shut pointedly behind him.
“Couldn’t imagine a better guy,” he said, when Tony asked him, from the relative privacy of the outdoors, what he thought about the match.  “He’ll know how to handle her.  They’re easy when they’re small.”  He smiled, then rubbed the underside of his chin absentmindedly.
.  He switched their hold easily, knocking Steve’s arm loose to place a bone-crushing hand on Steve’s nape.  “We shall make them rue their forgetfulness,” he promised.  “On my honor.”
Steve had his shield braced around Tony’s chest, ready to block a bullet, before the stranger was halfway across the room.  The man had a lumbering aura, like a bear.  Tony said, “Wow, I could just swoon,” in a dry, sarcastic way, that made Steve almost lower the shield before the bear-of-a-man neared and really did pull a gun.
fault.”  He said it not meanly but honestly, relieved that the burden of failure was taken off his own shoulders.  “Don’t fuck up,” he warned.
“Uh-huh,” Tony muttered, the first and only thing he had said for the duration of the trek, and Steve supposed that was a pretty good repayment.  The warmth against his back was not entirely bad, either.  Illinoisan nights in early May were almost as brisk as New York nights—the joys of living on coastal waters, Steve mused.
Ignoring the two guest bedrooms, Steve proceeded straight to the master.  “Tony?” he repeated a third time, worry entering his voice as he observed the messed-up bed, the wreckage of a frustrated man.  “Are you hurt?”
“Don’t let me change you,” Tony said emphatically, pulling back to look at him, grave and worried.  “Don’t—”
Tony said, “You wish you had my armor, hunter,” and probably deserved the elbow to the side from Stovok.  “
He followed, halting abruptly at the sound his own feet made as they sloshed through the water.  There was no exact picture-memory for it, but like a horse balking on the trail, he could not make himself move through it.  His vision tunneled, until he could not see Natasha at all, deep underground, deep under the ice, trapped in the water,
“Valcusians,” Thor repeated, holding out a hand in greeting.  “Surely, you have encountered them on your many noteworthy travels.  They are quite memorable.”
“This never leaves this room,” Tony added seriously, pointing at each of them in turn.  “Or I’ll never hear the end of it.”  Then he lifted his telephone to his mouth and ordered, “Roscoe.”  An alert voice responded briefly.  “I’m really craving some Lou’s at the Adler in less than an hour, think you can make it happen?  I’ve got five friends.  Oh, and Captain America really needs something nice to wear, if you can show up with a suit, I’ll throw in an 1872 Clive Christian Original to your next gift basket.”  Tony ended the call without another word, pocketing his telephone and clasping his hands together.  “Voila.  Bookkeeping done.”
fall backwards this time, hastening to give them space, but, honestly, Steve didn’t know what the big huff was.
.  How one man could live in such an armor was an abomination, a horror come to life—not something Steve could afford to dwell on, snapping:
Not hard enough to take him to the floor, although Steve did wonder how strong Clint thought Natasha was, if this was considered a normal embrace.  “Get off me,” Steve grunted.
He did not interject to ask how far medicine had advanced, if they could, in fact, duplicate the serum, because he did not want to know the answer.
“Hey, sweetheart,” he murmured.  Thallium looked up, depthless black eyes fixing on him, communicating something he could not hear.  “Wanna go for a drive?”
Rico yowled.  Tony froze, and Steve did, too, nearly forgetting the cat.  Afraid he was hurting Rico, Steve set him down on the bed.
He was stiff from sitting in the same position for so long when Tony showed up.  If he did not move, he thought, then he did not have to acknowledge or face reality.  Then Tony leaned against him, despite the roominess of the bench.  When Steve did not move, he leaned in more.
“OK,” Tony rasped, surprising Steve.  Response time dulled with fatigue, Steve did not move fast enough for him—in fact, did very nearly the opposite, stroking a thumb against his shoulder, confirming,
Tony said, “With you?” and only grumbled under his breath as Carter stepped further into the room, peering into the washroom like she expected to find a Vulcan hiding behind a shower door.  “I thought he was on the bridge,” Tony added.  “You try the rec room?  Got a mean arm for pool.”
had arrived once and simply left precious cargo behind, then it all made sense.  “I must’ve had more Saurian brandy than I thought,” he speculated aloud, but his head felt fine.  Unusually fine.  Despite the miracle of modern technology, he always had a whiff of a headache, humming in the background like electronic equipment.  The silence was pleasantly unusual.
“There were no Romulans.”  Tony turned to Admiral Fury, blinking in surprise.  Grimly, he reported, “Those were Talosians.”
Thor beamed, smoothing a big paw of a hand over his own deep gray shirt, hair tied back in a string, like a sailor.  “You are most kind, Stark.”
“Don’t hurt yourself,” Steve advised dryly.  He finally wrapped an arm around Clint’s middle and pried him off the hammer, which clung to the pavement.
“No one’s stopping you from taking time off in Aruba,” Tony was saying.  “Which means I can only assume you’re here by
“It may be difficult to accept at this juncture that our actions were not hostile,” Sojef said, speaking very quickly, so as not to be overridden.  “We only desired to send you away in peace.”
, before remembering it was Tony Stark he was referring to, who absolutely would.  He nodded placatingly.  Tony surrendered the basket.
“Hrah!” Thor cried, hot on his heels.  In desperation, Clint chucked the ball again.  It landed inches from Bruce’s feet.  Bruce looked down at the tennis ball, then at Thor, and reversed course.
“I should drive,” Tony insisted.  Looking out the window, he complained, “I don’t like—it’s giving me a headache.”
“And the rest of the crew?” Dr. Banner husked.  Tony shared Dr. Banner’s shock, but he could not bring himself to believe that they were the only survivors.  The
Natasha Romanoff pushed back her chair and followed.  “Steve,” she added, almost incidentally, when he made to take his first bite of his own meal.
“Every day,” Steve admitted with a painful smile.  “You don’t forget.  I can’t,” he clarified.  He watched Snow preen her own scales, using her horns to scratch the itch.  “I remember all of them.  Started with twenty eggs, y’know.  Ended with twelve hatchlings.  Now we got six.”
Tony grumbled but obligingly unzipped the suit, stepping out of it and clasping Stovok by both arms.  “You’re
,” he seethed, too weak to scream, too hurt to battle, but fighting them down, laboring for the chance to die.  Steve kept his footing, only to trip over a loose piece of street, landing clumsily on one side.  For a moment, he was tired, he was frustrated, and he missed everything so much it was like its own delirium, but there was nowhere to go but up.
“You haven’t met Thallós,” Tony pointed out.  “She’s a sweetheart.”  He thumbed the dragon on Steve’s chest, adding, “They’re not bad.  I mean, not
,” then winced as Thor lifted a Gorn high overhead, half-fearing he would rip the reptile in half, before he ejected it from the game.  “He hates me.  I’m too good for him, and he knows it.  I’d be a
Sighing in mock consternation, Tony said, “I’m surrounded by imbeciles, but it’s a burden I bear graciously.”
.  “You all right there, Brucie?” Tony called down.  Bruce held up a weak thumbs-up, then pushed himself to his feet and limped off to join Natasha.  Tony returned to his task immediately, using some kind of electric nail puncher to lock the boards in place.
Thor thankfully released Tony’s helmet—he had faith in the suit’s integrity to withstand even a Hirogen’s wrath, but there was nothing like being caught in the lion’s teeth to make one a theist—and turned to face Barton.  “I have no business with you.”  Thor turned back to Stovok, then looked decisively at Tony and asked, “Will you accompany me?”
I use the phonetic English spelling ("Volkov boyat'sya - v les ne khodit'") to aid the flow of reading for my predominantly English-speaking readers, who may not be familiar with the Cyrillic pronunciation. I view it a bit like spelling out dinosaur names (e.g. aar·kee·aap·tr·uhks for "Archaeopteryx") to encourage non-Russian readers to begin developing a familiarity with the Russian language.
“Be calm,” Stovok advised, turning back to the Nibirans and clicking a few times, then indicating the mountain.  The Nibirans clustered around them, caging them in, and began to march towards the hill.
Realizing he was arguing with a nice lady who had let them into the Zoo after hours just so Steve could argue the finer points of monkey care, Steve said carefully, “I suppose I’m not exactly an expert on the matter.”
“Nah, the Zoo’s closed.  I’m sorry, pal,” Steve explained, indicating the closed gates outside the Lincoln Park Zoo.  “Guess we’ll have to come back another day.”
Thor threw both arms into the arm.  “Yes!”  Steve frowned and looked down at his hands—one gripping Clint by the back of the shirt, the other
A rap on the window startled Steve out of his doze.  “Sleeping Beauty, we’re leaving,” Tony said, standing outside the car.  Steve blinked, disoriented.  This wasn’t his bed.  This wasn’t his home.  What in the world was—
The green twins—Neo and Praseo—were gone, as was red Cadmium.  “Caddie?” Tony repeated out loud, surprised.  He gripped his shirt over the arc reactor in unconscious anxiety.  He knew that Neodymium and Praseodymium were both feral souls, but he had thought Cadmium was tame.  It bothered him that he had misjudged the hatchling’s character.
Steve looked at the Mansion, wondering what kind of beauty and ugly Tony was rambling on about, before shaking his head and moving on.
Having forgotten entirely about the original wager, Steve reached into his pocket, pulled out the slightly crumpled but otherwise unharmed blue lollipop, and examined it thoughtfully for a moment.
“No, you said don’t do anything to it.  Ah,” Tony acknowledged, pointing at him.  “That’s fair, but I’ll let that slide.”
“I really need to brand myself,” Clint announced.  “Rake in some royalties.  Hawkeye starts a Pepsi-Cola war.”
kid,” Tony began, already steaming, pointing a finger at him accusingly, attached to an IV.  He reached for it.
Tony jotted something else down.  “I wanna play,” Clint complained, shoving himself between the seats again and ignoring Steve’s restraining arm.  “It’s my newspaper.”
Tony snarled mutely in rage, trying to form words, to think of anything to spit at the monster that would hurt half as much as his own bleeding wounds.  He wanted to tear the flesh from the backs of those so convinced they could save him if he let them, to hurt them enough they would hesitate to touch him.
“Wait a minute, you want us to go sniffing around an irradiated bathhouse for unidentified Klingon sympathizers?  Isn’t that what unarmed patrols are for?”
He rested his head on Steve’s folded arms.  Steve lingered quietly, close enough Tony could hear Steve’s heart thumping along.  Finally, Tony dragged one of his hands loose to curl around Steve’s arm.
Possibilities sprang to Tony’s mind.  Maybe the planet was the same age as Earth, but tetherless.  Tony looked to the sky for a small glowing satellite, but nothing stood out to him on the semi-cloudy night.  Moons had a tendency to rapidly slow down even a ballistic planet’s speed, but an Earth-sized moon was still rare, and finding a much smaller hunk of rock was difficult without equipment.
I wish to keep myself out of the narrative as much as possible, so I'll simply state my health has been less than outstanding, but I have triumphed this day to present you this chapter!
energy that Steve shut up long enough for the car to roll up to them.  Clint and Bruce were gone, but before Steve could ask where
, Steve thought, then frowned at himself, catching on, even as Tony stole another fry from his basket.
Tony nodded, then shook his head, trying to find a way to prelude it.  “. . . You’ve heard of Vita rays?”
, Steve thought, looking out over the waters of Lake Michigan, the great inland sea, nothing like the roaring Atlantic yet reputable in its own surreptitious way.
“Actually, that’s spelunking,” Tony said, staring in disbelief as Stovok shimmied and squirmed his way into the improbably narrow crevice.  “You’re absolutely insane, you know that?”
Carter came to a halt in front of him, frowning even more severely.  “I was not in the launch bay when he reboarded but assumed all was well.”
, all gunmetal gore and exposed guts, animalistic creations—but Steve saw the cars of the future for what they were, robotic perfection, sealed off in strange, oblong packages.
Thor beamed.  Bruce gripped Tony for dear life.  Steve sighed, already knowing if it came down to picking straws who would bravely volunteer as tribute, but Clint said loudly: “What?”
Focusing on the press of his fingertips into warm skin to keep the ghosts away, Tony tracked the path of Steve’s breathing, from hip to shoulder and back again, to banish the demons.  There were no knots to smooth away, no sore spots to kiss better.  Steve was as perfect as perfect could be.
