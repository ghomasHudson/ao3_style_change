Then he hangs up. Steve’s just going to have to forgive him for that. Carefully, the three men head towards the door, exiting the building to find themselves on the street.
Steve throws his arm around his shoulder to keep him close, nodding towards Tony to tell him that it’s alright. He’s not mad. Sad, yes, but he’s not mad that Tony made this decision. Tony barely manages to reach for Peter’s face, only feeling his skin for a short second before his hand drops down again. With that, he feels his consciousness leave him once again. His left eye starts getting dark as well. His mind goes numb, and finally, he feels like he can rest.
Clint says through the comms. He’s quickly followed by Natasha.
Eventually, after Thor seems to have dropped his guard a bit, Thanos finally finishes his sentence.
“I know what you’re gonna say to me,” Peter starts, retracting the mask. Tony takes in a shaky breath, involuntarily taking a step back.
“Okay, so the ‘how’ works. Now we gotta figure out the when and the where,” Steve starts as he’s standing next to the multiple screens hovering up. Tony is not too far from him, listening to the man speak with a soft smile on his lips. “Almost all of us has had an encounter with at least one of the six Infinity Stones.”
Tony puts his head in his hands, feeling too exhausted to continue. He’s at the verge of passing out, too hungry to continue, yet having to appetite even if there would have been food. His entire body is probably shutting down on itself.
“And now I gotta hear it…”
“Can you imagine, that sweet girl we know used to be her?” Clint asks as he ducks out of another attack. Natasha chuckles breathily.
Tony sighs. “But now it’s dead in the water. We’re a thousand light years from the nearest 7-11. Oxygen will run out tomorrow, and that’ll be it.”
“Can you stand?” Sam asks. He holds out a hand towards Vision and helps him onto his feet. A bit breathless, Vision leans onto Sam while Wanda grabs his other arm to put it over her own shoulder.
“I don’t know if you’re ever going to see these. I don’t eve know if you’re… if you’re still… Oh God, I hope so.” Tony rubs at his eyes. He’s too tired to fight the tears at this point. “Today’s day twenty-one? Uh, no, twenty-two. You know, if it wasn’t for this existential terror of staring into a void of space, I’d say I’m feeling better today.
It’s so… Tony thinks he should feel annoyed, but all he can do is grin. After all, the dude stopped a giant spaceship the height of Stark Tower. Instead of saying anything at all, Tony starts walking towards the blue light that origins from the ship. Two characters appear on the street, as if they’ve been transported down by it. There’s a tall, ugly one, and then a skinny ugly one. Yeah, they’re both ugly.
“Steve?” he hears behind him. When he turns around, he finds Natasha standing there with her mouth fallen open. She’s holding Bucky’s weapon in her hands, looking it over as sadness creeps into her gaze.
But they’re not fast enough. Thanos rips the web out of his face and kicks Strange down. The entire scene is filled with action, and Peter can’t focus on everybody at once. One moment, Strange’s red cape is covered around Thanos’ gloved hand and prevents him from making a fist.
They pass everybody, nodding at them, thanking them for coming. Peter is surprised at how composed Pepper is, too. He’s right behind her, and when he sees Ned standing there with Harry and Johnny, he gives them a small wave. He’s a bit surprised that Wade is not here.
“Let’s just say that the greater good has rarely outweighed my own self-interests.” They exit the elevator at last, and head outside. Tony follows him without a doubt, finding himself curious right now.
As soon as Tony turns and sees red-eyed-guy holding Peter with a blaster aimed at his head, Tony holds up his other hand until it’s directed at the man. Anger fills him entirely, especially at seeing his son struggle like that to get free. Next to him, Strange pulls up another lightshow as a weapon.
This was even before Tony knew Peter was his son. He looks back at Clint with wide eyes. “Was he there?” he asks.
He couldn’t call himself a chef just yet, but with another, smaller mouth to feed once every week, both he and Steve had to work on it so they wouldn’t be giving Morgan takeaway all the time.
The street where people are running, screaming, panicked. A woman even falls down on the ground in her haste. Tony runs up to her and pulls her up.
They’ve calculated their numbers before, and this plan is only going to work with them. They could have recruited more friends, but there aren’t enough materials for them to go through with that. While Scott is testing out the special suit for this, Tony checks up on Rocket building the large device that is going to make this plan work.
Tony nods, excitedly. They both pull up their travel-suit and let the helmet surround their heads. Holding on to each other’s hands, they both press their button to go back.
thinks this guy’s the strongest, then that must really mean something. Tony walks up to the stairs, holding on to an ugly-looking pot to stretch his legs for a bit. The ache in his muscles is the only thing that might keep him sane while Bruce is panicking around him.
That’s how he sees Captain Marvel keeping Thanos from closing his hand. His right hand, which is now hidden underneath the gauntlet. That means he must have put it on, already. Peter wants to get there, but he can’t reach them all that easily with all these bad guys constantly getting his way.
With aching muscles and loud screams that nobody can hear, Hilde forces the two of them inside, before using her foot to automatically close the door. Instantly, their lungs are filled with air again. Yaël starts coughing as she seems to choke on something. Hilde quickly sits her up, slapping her on the back.
That skinny son of a bitch actually threw him into the sky? Well goddamnit! After getting his thrusters to work, Tony turns around to fly back in the direction of the battle. It’s dusty, and messy, and it turns out that Skinny is way more difficult to handle than Big due to the fact that he can move objects with his mind, but Tony’s sure they’ll figure something out.
“And you?”
“Stop!”
“Wade?”
“Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe,” Drax offers while still holding on to his belt.
Thor finally looks up, yet he speaks no word. Instead, it’s Bucky who calls out for him. Steve hears his footsteps approaching, but there’s something wrong.
Tony gives him a playful glance as he moves to close down the trunk. “Thank God I’m here. Regardless, I fixed it this night. A fully functioning Time-Space GPS.” Tony holds up the device he’s been tinkering on the entire night. Steve knew he’d been busy, so he’s not that surprised.
As Thanos approaches, the others all start running towards him – except for Clint, who works better at a distance with his arrows. Despite throwing multiple explosive ones at him, Thanos seems little bothered about.
“No, no, no!” she mutters out, tightening her grip on Yaël’s hand. She does not look good at all, covered by dust and ashes. At least she’s not burned, though that is honestly the most surprising thing right now.
“Not that it’s a competition, but she loves me 3000. You were somewhere on the low 6 to 900 range.”
“I knew removing the stone from her would not kill her,” Gamora eventually continues. “Though I wouldn’t have imagined there to be a child.”
“Really? Were you looking for it?”
“Okay, you should not be wearing that, okay? That is a part of a special birthday gift I’m making for Mom.” Tony gives the helmet a little kiss, and then he pulls it off her head, revealing his daughter’s smiling face. Tony’s chest aches when he recognizes Peter’s smile in hers, but he can never look away from her.
What just happened in those ten minutes he feels he has been gone? Were they actually five years? In what universe does Pepper have a suit? Because Peter knows that’s her; he can recognize her voice, immediately.
“Wong you’re invited to my next birthday party,” Tony calls out towards the wizard who just sent Big into a whole other place, leaving nothing but the monster’s hand behind when he closed the portal on him.
“I think you should go,” she tells him, observing Strange with a worried glance. Then, suddenly on the other side of the portal, Bruce appears as well.
“Your brother thought you to be dead.”
“Oh, no, she eventually gave up.” Steve then glances towards Thor’s left, where the tree-creature is standing.
“And we’ll just… be normal. No more hero-business. We’ll leave it to the younger generation. We deserve a rest.”
Tony startles when he sees two known HYDRA members enter his tower. Oh, how little they knew, back then. Rumlow and Sitwell looked innocent enough back then.
Hilde knows that they shouldn’t remain on Earth. Thanos will return here, and with there being two infinity stones at the same time… No, they can’t test it. She might be sneaking around, but she can’t help it. Luckily, Stark has received some of the escape pods from the Asgardian ship to repair. The guy seems to be good with his hands, but there are a couple of things Hilde still has to tweak to get it working.
“Why the long face? Let me guess; he turned into a baby.”
to know are made aware. And that’s enough for Tony, it seems.
about a father keeping his son safe. This is about the entire planet; no, universe. If they fail now, they’re going to be losing so much more.
“Magic!” he calls out in excitement. This is so cool. “More magic!” He yanks Thanos’ head down, going through another portal. “Magic with a kick!”
“I’m not letting you go without a medical professional,” the woman warns Hilde, who shrugs.
(See the end of the chapter for
Thunder shoots Thanos a few meters backwards, and it’s quickly followed by a large axe thrown by Thor. Thanos tries to stop it, even, but the weapon is strong. Very strong. And so is Thor.
Barely an hour could have passed after Thanos left. Yaël has yet to awaken, and Gamora can’t move without grunting in pain. They’ve received a message from a nearby vessel that has agreed to pick them up, so until then they’re stuck here.
“How did you do it?” Clint wonders the moment they’ve packed it up in its reserved container. Natasha grins at him widely. She’s been doing that so much more, lately.
He shares another look with Thor, who remains speechless.
“Pete, focus,” Tony tells him quietly. Peter nods and returns his attention to the task at hand. He stops listening to what the blue-skinned woman behind Quill says. “Okay, Quill, you got to cool it right now. You understand?”
It’s spring, the sun is high in the sky and the temperature is agreeable. The trees aren’t shaking, meaning that there’s barely any wind around them. As the Quinjet approaches the facility, Steve can’t help but just
“Are you sure?” asks his partner with a serious tone.
“In the Hudson?” Natasha sounds surprised. Steve shrugs.
“’A Hunka-Hulka Burning Fudge’ is our favorite,” Wong adds.
That’s when he sees the first sign of Peter dissolving as well. The first pieces of him moving up in the air. Tony refuses to acknowledge it and holds on to Peter, tightly. In turn, Peter clutches to him tightly while he sobs.
“I don’t know how you’re gonna get it through all that,” he mumbles out before he can think of it. But his words don’t seem to move that smile away from her face. Especially when Wanda lands down right behind her, looking pissed off and yet relieved to see him at the same time.
And Tony lowers his hands, giving Strange an exasperated look, holding back a sigh.
“I can go without breath for a long time.” Hilde lets out another deep breath, but then marches towards the airlock. Opening the first door, she starts tightening the tethering cable to her belt and gives it a few tugs. Then she grabs some thruster boots that she might have stolen out of Stark’s workshop. They’re silver, not having had the dye job just yet. It’s better this way; now they match the Valkyrie uniform.
“No, you’re a stowaway. The adults are talking,” Tony finds himself snapping at Peter, who makes himself a bit smaller while trying to fade into the background.
She’s relieved, though, when she finds a hatch on top of her. Carefully, she opens it, looking through the small lift and finding an empty room. This whole ship is weird, she thinks as she jumps out.
Had this not been a life-or-death situation, Tony would have made a few remarks that probably aren’t meant for his teammates ears. Luckily, he knows when to hold back. Despite being very impressed by his fiancé’s powerful moves, Thanos still seems to be too much for him.
Peter returns.
“Well, maybe it could be?”
“I told you. You’d die for that!”
“I CAN TRACK IT!” she eventually cries out when she just can’t take it, anymore.
But Steve knows, because these past five years have been making him feel like his hair’s turned grey, anyway.
She can’t look at it anymore. She only should focus on Vision. On the ultimate sacrifice she has to make. Vision looks pained for a while, until he lets out a relieved breath and closes his eyes, as if he’s feeling free.
“Tony.” It’s Steve who interrupted him. Tony gives him a look, hoping they can just get inside, have this done with. “We can try and bring Peter back. Morgan can meet her big brother. Just imagine… It could be a second chance.”
“Where’s James?” she asks him, while hugging the gun closer to her. Before he can answer, Rhodey comes up to them and tries to look around for answers a well.
“We’ve barely been gone a day,” Natasha points out. Rhodey rolls his eyes.
Nebula is next on the matter of the Soul Stone, which is still the vaguest part about this all. “Thanos once held the Soul Stone, but lost it and it hid itself inside another being.” Everybody knows who she’s talking about. “It’s by pure coincidence that he came across it again, but rather than extracting the stone from her, he decided to use her as a weapon.”
They’ve lost all control. Peter now, too, gets the helmet on as he awaits impact. Finally, Strange seems to want to make himself useful as he makes some movements with his hands and they’re suddenly surrounded by orange lights.
“Loki, what in Father’s name are you talking about?” he asks, though his voice sounds more like he’s demanding it. He doesn’t sound too amused, clearly not liking the fact that Loki and Yaël know things that he doesn’t. Hilde pretty much shares that feeling.
There’s a large wave of disappointment that must have fallen onto Quill as he takes in that news. Tony decides that this is enough. He takes a step to the side, reaching out for Peter and gently taking him aside.
Shuri smirks at him. “Why didn’t you just reprogram the synapses to work collectively?”
So after a moment, Tony reaches out his hand to the man next to him. Steve hesitates for a moment, but then he returns the gestures. He squeezes Tony’s fingers before bursting into tears right next to him.
But the sad look on Thor’s face stops him. The God of thunder has his hands clasped together, as if he’s praying for Tony who is standing right in front of him.
, don’t do anything stupid ‘till I get back,” Steve warns his best friend. Bucky rolls his eyes.
“You’re talking about adopting a child here, Tony! And sure, you have Peter and he can perfectly take care of himself, but the kid you’re intending on pulling along into your little family? They won’t have powers.”
“Your math is blowing my mind,” Tony deadpans.
But Natasha is smirking as she looks over her friends. Excitement is fresh and clear on her face. “Guys, if you pick the right year, there are four stones in New York.”
“Howard… Rogers.”
Steve went ahead to check on Bruce. He took one of the cars and left early in the morning. Tony slept for a little bit longer, but eventually he had to get Morgan ready to bring her back to Pepper and Happy.
It’s that woman with the horns on her face, but the other, larger one he doesn’t recognize.
“I think these matters are more important than legal travelling-“
Tony can only look at him, though where Peter is taking his left hand, Tony manages to squeeze it a bit.
“Eyes up, stay sharp.”
Tony sobs. “I love you, too.”
The others, he doesn’t really know that well. Or, he knows Mantis maybe a little bit, but not enough to really be certain about her. The same goes for the blue and green women not too far from her – though those two certainly seem to be way more experienced in combat than Mantis is.
“Hey man!” Peter greets Big before turning to Tony. “What’s up, Dad?”
“The universe lies within your grasp,” Annoying guy continues, averting his eyes from Thanos, as do the others. The four accomplices look in fascination as Thanos places whatever was inside that cube onto the golden gauntlet he’s wielding on his left hand.
Rhodey returned to the military. There isn’t much else for him to do, after losing May. Tony’s been insisting that his best friend try and date somebody, but it never seems to work out. Eventually, Rhodey just seemed to accept the fact that he’s not going to find anyone else.
“This is it,” Tony mutters lowly, inaudible to others. He takes a step back from Bruce, afraid that he might actually hit somebody that is standing too close to him. “What’s our timeline?” he asks, trying to keep his voice levelled.
“I’m going to allow that,” Tony mutters out. “If Thanos needs al six, why don’t we just stick this one down the garbage disposal?”
And as Peter becomes nervous, Tony armors up. As much as they’re trying to turn the ship, it doesn’t seem like they’ll steer clear from that thing on time. And much like Tony expected, their flying donut hits the other ship, causing for their vessel to tremble around them. He can see on the side of the screen that multiple parts of the ship have been destroyed because of this.
“I don’t know,” Peter manages out at last. “But… I don’t-“
“I just took down three guys for you. You’re welcome,” Johnny Storm says playfully, completely engulfed in flames as he smiles down at the two. Tony squints at him, but Peter holds up his thumb.
“Oh, but he didn’t know,” Hilde assures him. “To be fair, he thought up until last month that Loki had been dead, too. Turns out that wasn’t true and he’d been pretending to be the King the entire time. I tell you, that family is just weird.”
“Lazy,” Yaël concludes. They look at Hilde, but she just shrugs.
“Ready, Cap? Alright, we’ll meet you back here, okay?”
Tony is pulled out of his train of thought, and he offers him a tired smile. “Yeah, that would be swell.”
“Steady, Quill,” Tony says, though he immediately notices how parts of him are already turning into dust.
“Okay, look… Thanos has the biggest army in the universe, and he’s not gonna stop until he- he gets… their stones.” He points towards both Vision and Yaël, the latter not looking surprised at all.
“Shit!” he calls out before he can think of it. Behind him, a soft voice repeats his word.
Hilde feels her breath going faster, and there’s this pressure on her chest. She would kill for something to drink at this point, but both the compound and the tower have a strict alcohol intolerance here, meaning that there’s nothing in here. It’s not the time to head out to a bar, so Hilde just has to bite through it.
Gwen’s father was another matter; while the man hadn’t been too close to him, he had become an ally and helped him out, eventually paying that with his own life. In contrary to Gwen’s belief, Peter
“I think some fresh air will clear our minds for a bit,” she assures him, and that seems to be enough to convince Vision. He puts on the coat, grabs his shoes from the ground, and once they’re both ready they take each other’s hands and leave the hotel hand in hand.
Spaceships, Tony has already decided, are not his favorite things in the world.
“Sif should stay here,” Yaël points out. “She might be more helpful here.”
“Dad?”
“No!” Yaël suddenly calls out through her grief. Hilde literally pulls her off the ground, towards the open door. She doesn’t pay attention to the fact that the group of five can see them scuttering off. All she can do is keep an arm over Yaël’s face, and hope that the weird hair-color she’s sporting is different enough from the way Thanos remembers her.
She’s also introduced to Thor’s ex-girlfriend. A short woman called Jane Foster with a big attitude and even bigger guts. According to Thor, she slapped both him and Loki without hesitation. Hilde likes this woman already. When Hilde asks why she would go to New Asgard, Jane simply explains it with ‘I’m waiting for my boyfriend to return so I can tear him a new one.” Whatever that means, Hilde is sure that it will be good to watch.
“Here’s an interesting story though. Many years ago, my grandfather had to hide the stones from the Dark Elves. Wooh, scary beings.”
“Uneventful,” Vision adds.
“Hey!” his son greets him, for the first time in five years. Tony doesn’t have the time to react, as he’s immediately pulled back up on his feet by a very excited Peter. “Holy cow, you would not believe what’s been going on!”
“Well, that’s the thing,” he starts. He takes the shield from the ground, holding it in his hands one more time. It feels weird to think that this is the last time; good, but weird. There’s a relief, but also some sadness at the thought that this thing that has kept him safe for so long will, in a few moments, no longer be his.
Thanos walks behind Gamora. “You’re strong, me,” he starts. “You’re generous, me. But I never taught you how to lie. That’s why you’re so
And that’s true; he hasn’t seen the Hulk since Ultron, which is a long-ass time ago. Since Bruce came back on Earth, he hasn’t had any incidents, which Tony thought had mostly to do with the guy being better adjusted after spending some time on a nerve-wrecking planet.
“Worth a shot. It’s over, it’s okay.”
“The blade, it stopped me from phasing,” Vision mutters out.
“Let me see that,” he says. Though he remembers that piece of paper. He’d filled in quite a few of them. His own handwriting is put down on the sheet, where he kept on giving praise for Pete’s hard work. Peter had been so happy with it.
Steve tries to talk him out of it, but Tony is determined. Once the super soldier is convinced, the two men are next to one another on the small bed. Tony rests his head onto Steve’s chest, putting his hand over Steve’s heart and feeling it beating underneath his fingers.
He hears Steve say something to Sam on the other side of the line. Tony, meanwhile, turns around, looking at Strange standing there in that ridiculous outfit with his ridiculous hair and his ridiculous face and-
Due to no act of his own, Tall Guy is pulled back by a pair of webs. Tony recognizes the sounds of those shooters, anywhere. His heart skips another beat, but right when he’s about to see Peter from behind the fallen soldier, Scott’s gigantic foot squashes the bad guy like a bug. Literally.
All we are is dust in the wind.
Happy, May and Rhodey follow him inside, probably just as curious to see what’s going on. They get up the stairs, and the first thing Peter hears is Morgan’s happy giggling.
“I lost my son, too, Scott.” Tony says as he points his finger at the man. “The most important person in my life, I lost him, too. Of course, I would do
It’s just three words, but it’s enough to make Hilde’s entire body feel cold. And that’s when she sees the Quinjet land from the window.
Tony looks over the people around here. Most of them, he recognizes, but others he even has no idea of their names. At his point, he doesn’t even care. When he notices Thor sitting further away on a bench, he notices the God is sulking.
Fighting alongside Peter is at the same time the best and the worst thing. Mostly, it drives Tony a lot to go all the way and even more whenever he sees somebody trying to hurt his boy, but at the same time the worst thing is to see Peter being thrown around the place like he’s nothing but a piece of toy.
“The Reality Stone?” Steve urges on. Thor nods in understanding and marches forward.
“I’m sorry, what, we’re just sitting around, waiting for the right opportunity?” Thor sounds annoyed.
“Hey!” he calls out to get his attention. Strange turns, looking back at him with a weird expression in his face. “You said one out of 14 million, we win, yeah? Tell me this is it.”
Hilde wouldn’t have been able to say that it’s Helen’s first time in space if she hadn’t known it.
“They would want us to leave!” she returns. “Keeping you away from that creep is more important than saving the King.” She can’t believe what she’s saying; once upon a time, guarding and protecting the royal family was her only mission. Now her only priority is making sure that the Asgardians arrive on Earth safely, though without a King. It bites.
Shit, the man inside looks like he’s bleeding. Tony points at the vehicle.
“Escaping won’t be enough,” Yaël mutters sadly. “He’ll hunt everybody down, eventually…”
Vision lets out a loud gasp, his hand reaching up to his forehead. Wanda looks up, pulled out of her thoughts as she looks at him, finding him hunched forward as if he’s in pain. She doesn’t jump up on her feet, though, since this isn’t the first time it’s happened.
“And the Mutants?”
I want to remind everybody of the previous warnings. They still apply for this chapter.
“Let’s start with the Aether.” Steve brings them back on track, pointing at the screen with the red cloud on it. “Thor, what do you know?”
Underneath his foot, the other man speaks, too. “I’ll do
“Whoa, the structure is polymorphic,” the young scientist says. She’s dressed in a flashy orange dress that looks more like a raincoat. It’s always been said that the Princess of Wakanda has a unique fashion sense, and she wears it good.
“We like each other a lot,” Hilde says after clearing her throat. “But it’s nothing too serious so far.”
“Speaking of rings, Tony-“
“I hope they remember you,” he says. Peter doesn’t know what sound he lets out. He holds on to Tony, tries to keep him up. Blood is drooling out of Tony’s mouth, and his breathing isn’t going smoothly at all.
,” FRIDAY returns. Suddenly an orange flash passes him by, forming some sort of barrier that approaches the ship. All the dust that has been flying through the wind goes along with it, stopping right against the ship.
He’s been so focused on Scott and Steve that he barely noticed Natasha moving aside until she’s facing him again. Her expression looks broken, her eyes red. Tony’s words are obviously hurting her, and the man quickly realizes it’s the first time he’s seen her so emotional. As long as he’s known her, he never saw Natasha cry.
“…Odinson, the rightful King of Jotunheim, God of Mischief, do hereby pledge to you my undying fidelity.” Standing in front of Thanos, Hilde sees him suddenly jumping up, holding a small knife in his hand as he attempts to stab it into Thanos’ neck. She hears Yaël make a small worried sound when they see him fail. Instead, Thanos grabs Loki by the throat and pulls him off the ground. Thor starts struggling against his binds, but he seems overpowered in every way.
“What are they?” she asks, her heart racing faster with each image she sees. Next to her, she feels Vision stiffen.
Thor suddenly turns towards the man, who looks like he’s about to crap his own pants. “You, where is your screen?” he asks. The man frowns for a moment, but then points towards his bed. Then, there’s another shot hitting the ship. The lights turn down once again, coming right back up immediately.
Eventually, without a way to get out, Peter gets surrounded by even more Chitauri and other creatures. The arms can’t seem to catch up, and they’re all piling up on top of him. Especially adding the massive explosions suddenly happening around of him.
“We need to leave,” she hisses at her, barely audible. Yaël doesn’t move. A tear rolls over her cheek, falling on the floor underneath them.
And the jerk doesn’t even yet know who Peter is.
“He can destroy life on a scale hither to undreamt of,” Strange continues.
wanted a holiday away that
Happy and Pepper got married as well. Not long after the attack. They felt like the group needed a win. And it had been a good distraction. For a moment, Steve and Tony managed to forget their worries and they danced together at their feast. But it only lasted a short while as more thoughts of Peter entered their minds and they had to return home to grieve.
Quill makes a face. “What master do I serve? What am I supposed to say, ‘Jesus’?”
“Yeah. The first time we really started living together, wasn’t it?”
“Uh, no, not really. You keeping secrets from me, bro?” Tony asks, patting him on the shoulder before walking through the hall. He’s never really been here before, but he’s heard of the place through Peter, who seemed pretty impressed.
People might be confused, about the whole 'grandmother' part, but for that explanation, you should head to the second story in the series. It's called 'Golden locks, silver arms', and it's about Natasha's past with Bucky.
“Hey, husband,” he repeats.
“Really, really good. Really good. Do you plan on helping out?” he tries. He feels a faint pain in his side on the place of his scar, but he’s sure that’s just mostly mentally since it hasn’t been hurting for a while now.
“It means get lost, Squidward!” Tony knows Steve has told him something about pissing off his enemies, but he just can’t help it. Skinny puts his hands together, slightly turning his head towards the big one holding an axe and telling him something. Tony can’t hear what it is.
“For what? Nearly dropping me into space?” Strange counters, not at all sounding impressed. A fury sparks up inside of Tony, and he marches forward to face Strange with a heaviness in his breath, his hands balled into fists.
And at first there’s the cape trying to hold Strange back, but in the end it’s still just a cape. It loses its grip, and Strange goes flying again.
“I don’t wanna go, I don’t wanna go, dad, please, I don’t wanna go!” Tony doesn’t know if he ever felt this way before; his entire chest is being ripped apart with every word Peter is saying.
“Protecting your reality, douche bag.”
With Pepper.
“I can’t- he won’t-“
The battle on Titan starts.
“I know.” Tony lets out another deep breath and then scootches to the side on his bed. He pats the empty space between him, gesturing for Steve to join him.
“You wouldn’t,” he mutters.
Tony finally stands in front of him, and now standing closer Peter realizes that his arm isn’t just limp; it’s simply not there. It’s missing.
“Avengers,” Steve starts as Mjölnir finds its way back into his hand. It’s quite the sight, with him leading such a large army. Tony still can’t really believe it.
Steve sees some red flashes, and suddenly the drill things float up in the air, held up by some red clouds. After they’re dropped back on the ground, he hears Okoye in his ear.
at it.”
“This here is Hilde.” She points at the dark-skinned woman who looks defeated more than anything. “And those two are-“
Steve chuckles. Sam’s a good friend. That’s why Steve chose him, after all.
Tony freezes, letting go of Peter. The teenager seems to realize his mistake immediately, his face falling and his mouth dropping over.
“Your minds melted even though Steve’s in Wakanda and you’re here?” Pepper points out. Tony groans, rolling his eyes and waving away the comment. “Tony, be realistic here.”
Wait…
talkative.”
,” he hisses at them, and Hilde can’t help but let her mouth fall open. Her first reaction would be to push him back, but they clearly have more important matters to think about.
Tony gestures for Peter to follow, and the two of them go stand at the edge of the platform, looking down at the figures underneath. It’s pretty much a miracle that they didn’t hear them, but Tony figures they’re pretty high up, and the ship itself makes enough noise to cancel it out.
He drinks from his bottle of water while FRIDAY works her magic again.
But that’s not what Peter would do, is it? Peter wouldn’t give up. He’s too much like Steve. They might not be related by blood, but they have a lot in common. Too much, maybe.
to actually respond. How about that? “Come on, come on, man.”
Yaël shrugs. “I mostly lost my balance whenever I was using Earth, but other than that my body never suffered from it, I suppose.” She grabs a hold of her cup of coffee and starts blowing on it before her eyes widen and she jumps back up. “Oh, I’m a horrible host! Do you want something to drink?”
Tony finally manages to get a good look at him again. The kid hasn’t aged a single day. He looks shaken, yet not entirely in a bad way. It’s more like the whole, current situation is giving him all kinds of energy that add up to his already overactive state.
“We’ll take care of him. And Morgan. They’ll be fine, I promise you.” Pepper bites her lower lip and turns her head upon hearing one other presence. Noticing who it is, she squeezes Tony’s hand once and gets back on her feet.
Thanos lets out a deep breath. “How far away are we?”
They’re relocated to a place somewhere in ‘Norway’. An old city that has been abandoned due to too small a population. They rebuild it, and name it New Asgard to honor their home. And it’s far from their Kingdom – the Midgardians even call it a ‘City’ rather than a Kingdom – but it’s a start.
“O-Odal,” he returns.
“Well, that didn’t seem to work out now, did it?” Natasha points out.
“Great idea. We’ll call you back later.” Rhodey reaches up, ending the call and swiping the hologram of Ross across the room until it’s gone. “I’m going to hear about that later. Doesn’t matter, it’s good to see you guys.”
Yes, that child is pretty much like his father.
And he’s been carrying that around, ever since. Tony gets it. But they have to be realistic here; it Thor does this, he won’t be there anymore to see the results.
“My name is Brunnhilde, I’m a Valkyrie of Asgard and I need to get back to my people.” It’s the same thing she’s answered each time, but never has the person in front of her indicated that he’s going to go with her wishes. In fact, she could break out of this room without trouble but the point of them coming here is to find refuge. Being violent is not going to help their case.
I've noticed that the chapter that aren't in Tony or Peter's POV are quite short. It's because I'm not used to write other characters, and I'm mostly only including their chapters to make the story a bit more clear. I don't write in Yaël's POV since she's Caspinn's character, and nobody can write her like she can. Caspinn doesn't write anymore (at least for now), so the chapters including her are almost always written in Hilde's POV.
It’s Mantis who speaks up when Thanos only lets out a growl. “He’s in anguish.”
Hilde passes the house of the Royal Family. It’s not a castle; not by far. There’s no place for that. It’s just a simple house with five bedrooms and three bathrooms. There’s a large garden for the happy Golden Retriever they called Mjölnir for some reason, and last year they even installed a pool for the kids to play in.
“They’re heading to Bruce?” Tony asks.
“I understand, my child,” his heavy voice tells her, as if speaking to his daughter. “Better than anyone.”
That’s a hard question, because Tony hadn’t really been there during either of their births. He only met Peter when he was older, and he didn’t want to have anything to do with Morgan until he met her for the first time. That last part hadn’t been his proudest moment, but he hadn’t been in a good headspace at the time.
“So, Howard is going to have a son,” Peggy starts once Steve is finished. Out of all that he’s said, that seems to be the thing that caught her mind.
Tony lets out a long breath. “For now,” he returns. Then he moves his head up until his lips are pressed against the top of Peter’s head. He kisses him there once, softly, and then turns away towards Strange. “Why would you do that?”
to kill himself,” Tony finally concludes the story. “I woke up here where I found all of you outside the house.”
“In Laymen’s terms, it means you’re not coming home.” It’s a way to make it easier on the ears. Not that they’re going to like it.
“Did you lead him to us?” the dark-skinned woman asks. She stands up, though she still looks a bit shaky on her feet. Gamora doesn’t look away. At this point it’s the only thing she can do; holding her gaze. It’s the only strength she can show.
Oh, that’s the guy he and Peter fought back in New York five years ago. Right. Tony shoots a couple of blasts his way, but it doesn’t seem like he’s moving fast enough.
When she knocks on the door of her destination, a small child comes to greet her with large, brown eyes. Looking down at him, she immediately recognizes Prince Raido, who looks so much like his father, except for his darker skin and dark eyes. He’s not as much a trickster, as he has the ability to shift his shape in any way he wants. He even sometimes surprised them when he woke up and turned out to have changed as a girl. In those moment, the child would be happiest when put in dresses and having his long hair braided up nicely.
Sad scene incoming. Poor Wanda
Peter nods, standing up with her and following her out of his room.
“You have my word.”
Ned is never going to believe this whole thing.
“She’s right, you can’t,” Strange deadpans, as if this whole conversation isn’t going shitty enough as it is.
“I’ve heard some rumors…”
“You’re going to die for that!” Thor promises Thanos, voice broken, hurt, words hard. Hilde only notices the tear when it rolls off her cheek onto the ground. Meanwhile, the annoying one of the five gestures towards Thor, and some metal flies up to his mouth to prevent him from talking further. Then he leans down, taking the Cube from the ground.
“When did that happen?” he asks. And Steve knows he’s talking about the silver ring he’s wearing. Steve clears his throat.
Yaël, Gamora remembers. She looks unconscious. And pale. Gamora tries to get up, but she can’t manage.
“Where is he now? Where?”
Gamora says nothing else. She knows the gravity of her crimes. She’s been raised a machine, but she did grow some sympathy over the past few years since meeting the Guardians. Now that the staring match has stopped, Gamora looks over at the familiar unconscious figure further away. She hasn’t changed much. Maybe her hair is shorter than Gamora remembers.
“Thank you.” The others follow Bruce to the large living room where they can sit Vision down for a bit. Rhodey, who walks a bit slower than the others, stays behind for a bit as he grabs his cup of coffee from the table to take it with him. Steve reaches out for him to get his attention.
Wanda takes a deep breath but nods. “I miss him,” she admits.
In between figuring out the plan, Tony also had his side-project. Now that it’s time and they’re all back inside, Tony heads to the workshop and digs out the red-colored gauntlet he put together for this whole mission.
She doesn’t like the current tension going around there. Stark and his son going missing really set the mood for the remaining time, and it won’t get better until there’s word of them being safe. But Hilde can’t call out for them. It’s too dangerous to attempt at communicating.
At the last part, he loses his voice and his legs begin to tremble. Steve reaches out for him to stop him from falling, and Tony throws himself into his arms. The sob that exits his mouth after is uncontrollable.
It all happens so fast, Hilde can barely even understand it. Yaël has to press her hand onto Hilde’s mouth when Thanos nears Heimdall, looking down at him like he’s nothing more than an ant about to be crushed by his boot.
As he, the King and Natasha march closer, they can see the woman trying to break through the barrier with her sword. She doesn’t succeed, but still smirks despite failing. Steve can see it now that he’s standing in front of her.
She’s just about to make a turn back to the ship when something hits her and swings her out of balance. She gets out a muttered curse, but she can’t hear it.
Wanda has no idea what Thor is talking about, but it seems pretty personal. She can hear Thanos stammer some words, but never managing to form a full sentence. Thor pushes the axe even deeper into the Titan’s chest.
“Hey!” his Dad calls out to him. When he looks him over, the man seems even younger than he is. Tony sees him point over his shoulder while holding on to a can of what must be beans, and some flowers in his other hand. “The door’s this way, pal.”
“I’m sorry, Dad, I’m-“ Peter can’t finish as tears overtake him. Out of his left eye, Tony can see Pepper putting her hand onto Peter’s shoulder and gently directing him to Rhodey’s direction. She knows that Peter can’t handle it. Rhodey immediately opens his arms to the kid, and Peter falls right into them as he lets out a loud cry.
Despite the urgency of the situation, Peter seems to enjoy himself as he swings around the ship, entering hallway after hallway and coming up with many little gadgets that he found in some of the chambers. The way it usually goes is that he tries to show it, attempts to demonstrate how it works but then accidentally breaks it. Tony finds it too endearing to be annoyed; after all, Peter can use this distraction.
Vision smiles at the ground. “If you’re worried you can still call them; it’s not because
“Hello? Rogers?”
Bucky has changed for the better. He’s got his sense of humor back, he smiles occasionally, and he loves to tease people – except for Tony; he’s always careful around him, just like Tony’s careful around Bucky.
“Vision,” she starts, feeling her entire body shake. “Vision, if that’s true then maybe going isn’t the best idea.”
A knock pulls him out of his train of thought and Peter puts aside the frame while he passes his sleeve over his eyes.
“Staying here would be suicide,” Loki bites back at his brother.
“Yeah,” she returns before squeezing her eyes shut. “It’s just those dreams again, is all.”
The view on the screen changed after a couple of hours. At first it had been planet passing by, but eventually it became clear that the ship is nearing its destination with one particular planet staying in the center of the image.
“In plain sight.”
“If I give you the stone, will you leave the others unharmed?” asks the holder of the stone. Gamora can barely see her face; her golden eyes are red from tears and exhaustion. The man next to her looks just as battered as her. His skin still a touch of blue. The child they’re holding in their arms looks to have the same tint of skin as its father.
“This place looked a whole lot different seven years ago,” Clint points out, a little bit out of breath. He’s holding a piece of paper in his hand, which he hands forward in Tony’s direction for some reason. Tony frowns, seeing the others look back at him. “It worked, Stark.”
“That’s why it’s yours.” Steve holds out his hand and shakes Sam’s. And in that moment, Sam seems to catch it. But that’s probably because Steve put his left hand on top of their shake. Sam smiles down despite the tears, nodding.
“I’m sure they’re alright,” Yaël assures him. Hilde wishes she had her optimism. Everything seems far from alright. It’s just the quiet before the storm.
Hilde sighs. So much for the calm they’ve been having for now. Better take this matter into her own had.
“Alright, I’ve got all I need. Thank you for your cooperation,” Coulson says. He stands up, holding out a hand for her to shake. Hilde frowns at it before taking it, not at all holding back her strength and finding at least a bit of joy in seeing him squirm
“Yes,” she says. “But there are more than two trillion neurons here. One misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures.”
“’Undying’,” Thanos mumbles out, grabbing a hold of Loki’s wrist and pushing it aside, making Loki drop his weapon. The struggle on the God’s face is clear, and it does not bode well for any of them. “You should choose our words more carefully.”
“So what you’re saying is that Vision isn’t just the stone?” Wanda starts to sound hopeful.
“So how do you think things are going in New York?” Wanda asks, trying to get a conversation going after a couple of minutes of nothing more than silence. “I think Peter had a field trip today, I wonder how it was.”
They found trouble with their plan to get pregnant when it turned out Happy was sterile. So with her wish to continue with her goal, she approached Tony in the hopes he would be a donor.
“I won’t take offence. If you want to try, then try. I’m not going to stop you.” Tony shrugs if off as Steve sits down in front of him. Morgan holds out her hand, and when Steve wants to take whatever she’s handing him, he realizes it’s a piece of potato.
As Tony tries to walk away from the group just to get a bit of peace of mind, the others hurry back after him. Especially Quill who doesn’t seem to want to keep his mouth shut.
Tony doesn’t hesitate further, he flies up in the air, seeing that the spaceship is already high in the sky.
“We’re working on that right now.” Steve gestures for Tony to get back inside. “Rocket and Nebula are on their way. Rhodey’s not too far out, either.”
There are no answers. There’s nothing. There’s just… this reality.
It goes back and forth for a bit. The male one chasing after Vision, the female one attacking Wanda. She likes to think she’s holding her ground pretty well, but she’s very much aware of the fact that Vision can’t go on like this for much longer.
“Loki?” Hilde asks as well. She opens a few doors, but finds noting other than dimmed lights. Thor, too, looks into rooms. By the time they find an open door with the lights still on inside of it, they walk inside to find Loki grabbing Yaël’s arm, pulling her along in a seemingly desperate way.
“Absolutely nothing.”
Feeling annoyed, Tony decides it’s the best he’s going to get. He gets his helmet back on, and points towards the wizard. “You better be right,” he tells him before he flies off again.
“You ruined the time heist!” Scott eventually says angrily.
of having kids to call his own. A little brother for Peter, or maybe a little sister. Or two of them. Or maybe even three.
“Let’s get you on the jet,” he eventually gets out, turning without another word. Natasha and Sam give each other a look. Wanda only feels worry, as there’s clearly something bothering the Captain.
“I need at least ten minutes, maybe fifteen at the most,” he says, his voice sounding a bit more certain now. Hilde nods, pushing the button to open the door and carefully looking through.
“You are the holder of an Infinity Stone. We can’t let him get to it.”
Howard guides them back to the elevator Tony came in to. “So, flowers and sauerkraut. You got a big date tonight?”
Peter frowns and looks up. This is an Iron Man suit, except it’s not Iron Man. It’s a blue suit, and the one holding him is definitely a woman.
“It’s like my head is just… mush! Just the smallest hit and I lose everything,” she complains. Then she sighs, dropping her gaze. “Almost everything.”
“Tony, we’re gonna need you to focus.”
“I’m scared to hope, again,” Tony admits. He feels Steve kiss him on the top of his head before he leans to the side to pick up his book again. Once they’re completely settled, Tony’s hand grabs Steve's and he starts playing with his fingers absentmindedly.
Tony’s in outer space, and Peter went along with him.
“Hilde…”
“Surprise,” Tony says, mid-hug with Morgan who clings on to him like an octopus. Tony swings her around with a wide smile on his face, which looks… wounded, still. Scarred. His  Like there’s a burn-mark on the right side of it, going all the way to his neck and probably his arm, which looks limp as it hangs next to his body. There seems to be something wrong with his right eye as well.
The others regroup a bit further away. They don’t comment on the pair, still standing on the platform. Bruce gestures that they should start up a game plan and figure out their best approach.
Tony shakes his head and fails to hold back a snort as he raises his hand. “I’m gonna stop you right there, Scott. Are you seriously telling me that your plan to save the universe – to bring back my son – is based on
“And I believe telling all youse, alive and otherwise, what we needed was a suit of armor around the world! Remember that?” This time, he looks over at Bruce who simply seems defeated, almost more than Bruce. “Whether it impacted our precious freedoms or not- that’s what we needed!”
A cold shiver passes through her as she sees the footages.
Tony gets up from the chair he was seated on. He then walks to the camera, suddenly looking up so that he’s practically staring at each of them. “
In only a matter of minutes, large explosions appear on the surface. Everybody heads towards the windows to have a look, except for Shuri who helps Vision up on his feet. Steve gives T’Challa a look, both of them agreeing that they’re running out of time.
Bruce tries again, letting out another loud grunt. There’s a slight bit of green appearing in his throat, but that seems about it. Strange gives him a look that indicates ‘hurry up’.
Halfway putting it on, he can’t hold it anymore. With one arm in the sleeve, he lies down next to the helmet, slowly feeling his consciousness disappear. He’s aware that this might be the last one. The last time he’ll close his eyes. He should fight against it, but he can’t.
Shit, Tony feels his eyes sting upon hearing Steve’s voice. He reaches for his chest, but the metal suit is in the way for him to reach his scar.
The sight she sees on the escape pod is one she wouldn’t have expected. One she wishes she didn’t have to see. Thanos is towering over a pair on the ground. A woman in a white-silver suit is on the ground, knocked out for the time being. One human looks defenseless but still holds up what seems to be some primitive gun.
Loki, once again, transforms into Steve and repeats what he just said. Much like last time, Tony lets out another snort because of the impeccable impersonation. But quickly, Thor gags him mid-sentence as he’s transformed back into his original self.
“And I swore off dairy, but then Ben & Jerry’s named a flavor after me, so…”
“Yes, Tony,” he says after that. His free hand, he presses against Tony’s chest, where it’s immediately covered by Tony’s hand. Meanwhile, Rhodey must have let go of Peter, as the kid is suddenly back with them.
“I’m fine,” he lies. Obviously he’s not fine; he lost another parent. The fourth, by now. There’s this hole in his chest that gets bigger and bigger and Peter knows that it will never fill up again. That hollow feeling when thinking back of his Dad will never go away. He’ll have to live with it.
Much to Tony’s pride, he sees Peter coming up, shooting one of his typical webs in Strange’s direction. When he catches him on the shoulder, it’s not too surprising that the teenager lets out an excited ‘yeah before realizing that he needs to hold on to something.
“Certainly not, I speak for myself,” Strange says, making another weird move with his hands until more orange glowing things appear. “There’s no trespassing in this city and on this planet.” Next to them, Wong does the same thing.
But the others don’t understand his words. Of course, he’s bringing up terms that sound logical to him, but is complete nonsense to them.
There’s another touch to his shoulder. Tony startles, turning around and distancing himself from who-ever was touching him even more.
Steve passes his arm over his forehead to get some blood out of his face, as well as some loose hair. “You are not going to believe it.”
Ten minutes later, they’re all outside again. It’s warm, the air breathable, and it feels completely abandoned. There’s something about the sunset-colored sky that irks at Tony. When he sees Quill pull out some yellow glowing device – space stuff, nothing Tony wouldn’t be able to invent on his own, obviously – he waits for him to do something with it.
Howard seems impressed by it. “Smart guy,” he points out.
Strange seems alarmed at that. “Under no circumstances can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos. I don’t think you quite understand what’s at stake here.”
“BOOM!” Rocket shouts, startling both Tony and Bruce. They give him an annoyed glare, and the raccoon simply smirks without giving any excuse. They get the gauntlet out of the chamber and put it on the workbench to have a look at it.
“No!” she shouts before Thanos could reach Loki. She grabs her knife and swings it in the direction of Thanos’ neck. She’s fast, but Thanos is faster. His hand moves up until the weapon seals itself inside his hand. He grimaces when he looks at his hurt hand and pulls out the knife. Without warning, that very same knife ends up slicing through her gut. The weapon sticks out of her belly, while the green colored blood starts dripping out of the wound. She never even saw it coming. How could she not see it coming? She’s been trained for this; she’s the fiercest warrior in the universe. He’s made her that way.
They’re careful not to touch the stones. Rocket is next to him, observing him work with the little mechanical arms connected to FRIDAY. Next to him, Bruce is keeping tabs on the readings of the stone. It’s careful work, but that makes it even more safisfying when it’s finished. Now, all they hope is that it’s not going to explode next to them.
Immediately, everything goes dark.
“You look exactly the same,” he points out. Peter blinks a couple of times, and then he opens his mouth again.
“We hope everybody’s alright?” the man who introduced himself as Reed Richards asks. The woman, Susan, helps Gamora step inside of their own space craft.
“Admit it, you should have ducked out when I told you to.” Tony scans the devices around him once more, trying to see it from a different angle. “I tried to bench you, you refused.”
“Doctor,” Hilde greets her. If there’s anything she’s learned from Earth, it’s that people like their earned titles.
Tony instructs Morgan to head inside and wash her hands. He follows her in, only to come back out with a jug full of water and a couple of glasses. He hands out one to his guests, giving Steve the last one while looking him in the eyes with a questioning look.
They’re meted by a group of four. A tall man with wild brown hair and grey streaks in them is the first one to greet, quickly followed by the woman Hilde heard through the communicator.
Only a second later he’s blown away from the small explosive that has been thrown their way. It’s a small energy pulse that gets the both of them thrown back. He can hear people approaching, then a loud voice shouting.
“Just go and see, Pete,” Steve assures him, with tears in his eyes despite the happy expression he has. Is he… joyful?
The village is purring with hope. Some Asgardians that haven’t disappeared felt like they couldn’t stay here and moved out to other cities. The ones that didn’t, all have their own houses here. Now, hearing that their King is maybe part of a plan to bring back their missing loved ones, everybody is talking about it.
“Insect!” he hears above him. This is probably not the right time to tell him that Spiders aren’t insects.
“No, but-“
“Come on, Steve, wake up.” Tony shakes him by the shoulder. Steve’s eyes open carefully, and he looks tired and hurt all at once. He frowns once noticing what’s Tony’s holding. “If you lose this again, I’m giving it to Peter and Morgan instead.”
Can’t somebody bring his Dad back?
“Dad, we need to stop the bleeding,” says Peter after a moment of quiet. Tony looks down, as if he only just noticed it. He lifts his hand, and blows something into the wound. He has no idea what it is, but it’s probably something Dr. Cho invented if it’s specified for wounds.
“You… will never be… a god,” Loki whispers out. After that, he stops moving. Hilde pulls on Yaël’s arm, trying to get her back on her feet. Where Thor is kneeling on the ground, they can hear a faint ‘no’, but the metal thing on his mouth prevents him from talking further.
“Me, too, obviously.” Tony reaches forward to kiss her forehead. “But now it’s time to sleep, alright? Love you, tons.”
He knows a bit about Hilde. Mostly, that she likes to drink away her worries of her past. From Bruce, he learned that she’s also quite the skilled fighter, but didn’t use those skills for a long time due to being too drunk mostly.
It had been a little after that when Pepper came with the news that she wanted to have a child. Tony had once pointed out that Pepper never wanted to become a parent, but it seems like something has changed in that time. Probably the massacre of half the universe that does it.
The world is so different from then. There weren’t any worries for Thanos – except maybe from Tony’s side after that particular vision Wanda gave him. They were all just friends; none of them knew too much about one another. It was just their team, getting to know each other without too many complications.
Peter holds up his hand. “I’m back-up?” he tries.
Pepper pulls him into a hug and Peter holds on to her, pressing his eyes against her shoulders as he starts sobbing. Pepper gently pats his back, kissing him on the side of the head.
The streets are empty; it’s pretty normal for this place. It’s why they chose to go here rather than a sunny beach or anything else. This is just down to Earth, enough to make them feel like they’re at least a
In the past twenty-so days, Nebula must have come to care about him, as she’s lingering her hand onto his shoulder when he’s taking what must be his last few breaths.
Noticing something in what she’s presenting him, Tony reaches out for the image and twists it around for a bit. “Give me that eigenvalue. That, particle factoring and a spectral decomp. That will take a second.”
“I should sure hope so,” Peggy laughs. She leans her head against Steve’s chest. “I’ve missed you, Steve. But it’s been 2 years now.”
Tony looks up at the red-haired woman. While her hair is still short, the natural color she went back for looks so much better.
“My boy,” he whispers, moving up to kiss Peter’s head. Then he snuggles his face into his hair, as if he tries to take in his smell. “I’ve missed you so much.”
Man, Peter would never wish to stand on the opposite side of any of them. While he’s not fought Natasha before, he’s been trained hand-to-hand combat by her back when she still thought he was ordinary. He’s never seen Okoye in action before, but he’s heard many stories about her and her other warriors. Shuri, he has yet to meet, but he already knows that he will like her very much. She might be a great potential friend.
“Oh, uh, my wife’s expecting. And, uh, too much time in the office.”
There’s no particular reason for them to want a moment to themselves. Tony just told them he needed some air, and his former team – his first team, that is – just decided to come with him and… what, spend some time together?
Tony sees no way out
“We swore an oath to protect the Time Stone with our lives,” Wong adds dramatically. Tony rolls his eyes.
He doesn’t know when he dozed off, but suddenly there’s another touch on his arm. He startles, once again holding up his arms to realize that the suit is still in the container on his chest. He calms down, though, when he finds Peter crouching down next to him.
Tony blinks in confusion. He feels like crap. Seriously. His entire body aches. Is this what old age feels like?
“My brother is wrong, many times.”
No way, that stinking bastard! Is he really going to switch sides like that to save his own skin? He didn’t want them out of there to save them; he wanted them gone so they wouldn’t know he was such a sneaky weasel.
“How can I? You’re taking all the stupid with you.”
Well, you know, temporary, that is. IF NATASHA, LOKI AND GAMORA GET TO LIVE IN THIS VERSE, SO DOES TONY!
The eerie silence around them remains. The wind is restless, as if it’s trying to warn them about a shift, somewhere. Wanda can feel it in her powers; in the part inside of her that must have been created by the stone they tried to take out of Vision.
“Not one single bit,” she admits. “Using the powers always took a toll on me. When I made fire, my body would go in hypothermia. Creating water would dehydrate me. Air speaks for itself.”
And now there’s barely any of them left.
, Tony thinks to himself as he takes in the dark environment around him.
When she notices Gamora is awake, she gives her a dirty look.
Natasha goes after Clint, after they managed to track him at last. He’s been all over the world, tracking down people so it seems. Tony doesn’t try to think too much about it; they’ve all sunk into a dark hole once, and Clint is currently still in one after losing his brother and his family.
Clint is quick with the container. It’s not a good idea to hold on to an Infinity Stone for too long a time.
“And bring another beacon towards us?”
“Because… we didn’t think of it,” Bruce admits in defeat. It’s obvious here that there are two smart people out here, but Shuri always seems to be the outstanding peak on the graphic when it comes to her brain.
Around the second week ending, Tony doesn’t even feel anything at all. He has none of his medications on him, and about all the drinks around here are alcoholic, which isn’t helping him, at all.
“Right. Another detail he forgot to mention.”
The next stop is Asgard. There he just drops Mjölnir on a table he finds, mindful of not being seen. He makes quick work of injecting the Aether back into Jane, and before she can even turn around he’s gone once more. Now, on Morag he carefully puts the stone back in the orb, and then he puts that one back on the stand it supposedly had been on. The moment the orb comes in contact with the stone, a forcefield comes back up, protecting it from being taken.
“Gamora, no,” Nebula breathes out exhausted now that Thanos has let go his hold on her. She barely reacts when Gamora puts her hand onto Nebula’s face. She wants to help her, fix her. Put her back together.
Using his usual tricks, he webs up everybody until they’re safe. Or, as safe as is possible in this place. He grabs for Mantis, Drax and then Quill. Or, is it Drax? He can’t remember names all that well.
“Cap?” Steve hears from the side. It’s Bruce who is gesturing at him to come along, and Steve nods. Before he can walk off, an arm suddenly grabs his and holds him back. It’s Bucky who’s stopped him.
She’s weak. Thanos taught her not to be, but she still is. She was taught not to love, yet she still did. And now she doesn’t know what will happen to her sister, or how the man she loves is doing at this moment.
. She can barely get anything done before she’s knocked aside, losing the energy and smashing through a window with a painful grunt.
“What’s new with composting?” he says despite not even paying attention. Before Steve can even answer, he turns back to him with his arms crossed. “I figured it out, by the way.”
Scott is struggling with holding back his smile. “A time heist?”
He’s pulled out of his thoughts by Peter’s voice behind them.
“No resurrections this time,” Thanos mutters out, throwing Loki’s body in Thor’s direction and walking towards the rest of the order.
Peter knows there are no anxiety meds or antidepressants in space. Normally, he should be fine for at least a couple of days before he’ll start feeling like something’s wrong again, but this current situation is not helping at all.
That’s Sam, who sounds out of breath.
Rhodey says nothing. All he does is reach out for him and touch the side of his head while keeping his head bowed. Tony’s known him for long enough. Rhodey doesn’t handle loss with words, but with silence.
“D- Don’t!” It’s all Tony can manage out. Peter puts his hand onto Tony’s chest to hold him back when he tries to move. Further away, Strange lifts his hand and brings the green, glowing stone back into view. Where-ever he had been hiding it, Peter has no idea. At this point, he doesn’t even care.
“We’ve contacted the Four,” Natasha says right before the hovercraft stops. They’ve arrived at their location.
“Besides,” Quill continues, turning back to Strange who had asked the question in the first place. “He didn’t go to Nidavide or whatever that is. He said something about Nivadellir, said he needed a new hammer or some kind of weapon that defeats Thanos.”
“You just didn’t want Fury to know about it, did you?” Rhodey points out. Tony presses his lips together.
“’Cause I got some important shit going on here! What do you think?” he says, probably a bit louder than he should. Morgan frowns at him, but only playfully, so. “No, I got something on my mind. Got something on my mind, that’s all.”
In the next room Wanda’s finally let go of Vision as she moves around, accepting some sort of shake Clint must have prepared as he walks around with a tray of them. Vision is seated on a chair, still holding on to his side
Strange walks his way, the cape now once again back in its place. “Can we control it? Fly us home?”
“Obviously,” Steve returns. He pulls back, though he keeps his hands onto Tony’s shoulders while keeping eye-contact. Tony can see now, indeed, that Steve has red eyes from upcoming tears. It looks like he’s trying to keep them at bay, but he’s failing a bit at it.
“Yeah, that’s on
“Ah-hahahaha! You guys are so screwed, now!” shouts Bruce in his excitement from a bit further away. Steve can hear him in his ear, and even he feels a twitch of happiness inside of him.
“Quantum fluctuation messes with the Planck Scale, which then triggers the Deutsch Proposition. Can we agree on that?”
“I am Steve Rogers,” he returns.
“No!” he calls out, waiting for the inevitable blast. But nothing seems to come, and even Thanos realizes it as he look back at his hand. Managing to get a little bit closer, Peter can see that the stones are no longer on the gauntlet.
No, T’Challa’s bloodline has perished. There’s no way forward.
“You could not live with your own failure,” Thanos starts. “And where did that bring you? Back to me. I thought by eliminating half of life, the other half would thrive. But you’ve shown me that’s impossible. And as long as there are those that remember what was, there will always be those that are unable to accept what can be. They will resist.”
Steve takes a shivering breath next to Peter. He reaches out his hand for the man to take, which Steve does. He gives him a sad smile, and Peter can see the tears in his eyes. The ones he’s trying to hold back.
Hilde understands why when she sees Thanos throwing the Hulk down on the ground as if he weighs nothing to him. She holds in the surprised gasp. There’s a low muttering somewhere on the side of the fallen Asgardians, and suddenly a bright, colored light engulfs the Hulk, lifting him off the ground and making him disappear from the ship.
We're reaching the end. I've been writing two full days on this to finally finish it! Though I might need to filter through some of the mistakes, but it's very late and I need to go to the hospital tomorrow for the entire day so I'll fix those then.
His heart breaks, once again, at the mention of Peter. He feels his eyes starting to sting. “You
“Good. You had me worried there. ‘Cause that’d be horse shit. That’s not how quantum physics works.”
Danvers? Is that a new team member? Peter never heard of her before, but he’s curious, especially when that bright light comes down right in front of him, revealing a woman with short blonde hair in a red-gold-and blue suit. She smiles at him when she sees him, and Peter realizes he’s practically hugging the gauntlet.
“All Thanos wants is to bring balance into the Universe by killing half of its population,” Loki explains. “He’s been invading planets, performed genocide to prove his point.”
Tony goes back to the ground where he takes down three more guys. He’s about to move out, when suddenly he’s flying again – and not in the good way. He smashes up against some of the debris, finding a large, faintly familiar figure running back up to him.
“Got to hustle, Steve. Things looks like they’re about to wrap up here,” Tony says as he’s scanned the interior of the tower, seeing the original Avengers group all gathered around Loki. He sneaks inside the tower, JARVIS not even telling on him as he doesn’t sense any intruders. Tony is not an intruder in his own tower.
“That’s right,” Tony smirks, not removing his eyes from Big, who is trying to make fancy, menacing movements with that axe of his. “It’s been a while. Good to have you, buddy.”
“Some time ago, your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me,” comes from the larger man standing behind her.
Hilde hears many rumors, happy and sceptic alike, as she goes through the streets. People avoid for a little bit, knowing her to be head of the Royal heir’s personal guards. She’s no longer on her own with it, but she still sees it at her sole responsibility.
Yaël must have had an even harder time than Thor did, adjusting to parenthood. But that’s mostly because the child has particular powers that often make the woman lose sleep. Whether it’s shapeshifting, telepathy or even just the random ability to freeze things with his hands.
“I saw this coming a few years back.” Tony gestures with his hand as if his head is exploding with their stupid questions. “I had a vision. I didn’t wanna believe it. Thought I was dreaming.”
“Fantastic!” Hilde cries out in relief. She hears a snort coming from Helen, who must have awakened from where she fell asleep. Failing to grasp what’s so funny about what she just said, he decides to ignore it.
But from where Steve had fallen, Tony can see him come back up again. Willing for his reparations to go faster, Tony aches to go to him and stand by his side. But as it seems now, he’s the last one standing, and extremely outmatched.
“You will not believe what’s been going on. Do you remember when we were in space? And I got all dusty? And I must have passed out because I woke up and you were gone. But Doctor Strange was there, right? He was all like ‘It’s been five years, come on, they need us’ and then he started doing the yellow sparky thing he does all the time-“
He’s been forgetting to eat and drink, until Nebula – that’s the woman’s name, by the way – forced a tasteless meal into his mouth and made him swallow it whole.
“How long is this gonna take?” Sam asks. Bruce shrugs.
“Tony Stark!”
“Hey, since when does Pepper have a suit?” Peter wonders out loud. Steve chuckles.
“Maybe,” she admits. “Either way, Thanos is going to pay for what he did.” She grits her teeth, the tone in her voice nearly giving Hilde shivers.
Bruce immediately counters. “
“Strange,” Tony calls out distantly. The two of them haven’t been hanging out a lot in the past, mostly just short introductions and small arguments about magic, but that has been enough for Tony to strongly dislike the man.
she hears on the other side. It’s the voice of a woman. “
As the locked doors all open up again, Tony notices Scott wandering off to the windows after noticing something outside. He barely pays any attention to it when his phone suddenly goes off inside his pocket. Not a lot of people have his number, he realizes, so it’s probably Pepper or something.
Peter’s already running back towards the army by the time he sees Tony return to the scene as well. Dropping down somewhere close to where Carol went down, Peter hopes that he finds the gauntlet and takes off with it, again.
He hears the others in his ear, but he can’t react. He can’t really hear them, as his ears are ringing a bit from being too close to the explosion. He can only focus on that bright light that suddenly appears out of nowhere, flying through Thanos’ ship with such a force that makes it break apart from the inside. After going through it a couple of time, there’s an explosion and the thing crashes into the lake.
(See the end of the chapter for
At that, Hilde gets an angry look from the girl; one that’s clearly tired of that same question.
“That you needed to pee?”
Hilde frowns, sitting down on the seat next to Yaël and throwing her arm over the armrest. “You’re dreaming while you’re awake now? Some people would call that ‘having a vision’.” She gives her a light smirk but it doesn’t reach her eyes and she knows it. Yaël simply sighs.
He can see in Peter’s eyes just how excited the kid is. Probably too excited for their current situation. But every mention of Thor just gets him all riled up; of all the Avengers, he’s yet to meet him, after all. When he turns to look at Tony he gives him a big smile. Tony rolls his eyes.
“Clearly, you weren’t actually born here, right?” asks Tony after they’ve been walking together in silence. Steve is in military uniform, while Tony’s wearing a suit and his glasses.
Clint nods. “So we have to pick our targets.”
“I just wanted to bring him back. I wanted to do that for us. I miss him so much.”
“I am GROOT!” he shouts. Steve snorts and nods his head.
A purple explosion destroys the wreckage that crushed Thanos, and the giant lets out a raging shout. Suddenly, out of nowhere, there’s a flock of bats following Tony. Where did they come from?!
After they separate, Steve takes a step back when he sees Pepper approach Tony. With the woman hugging him tightly, Tony can see the others over her shoulder. Happy stands there a bit further away. Then there’s Rhodey, Clint, Natasha and Bruce.
“Come, let’s take a walk,” she says. Vision laughs slightly.
When Tony arrives at the Compound for the first time in years, he finds Steve already standing outside with his hands in the pockets of his hoodie and a tired expression in his eyes. He already looks done, which is kind of hilarious. Tony stops the car in front of him and rolls down his window as he looks over at his partner.
“What about Steve?” he asks.
“You will pay for his life with yours,” she gets in return. The woman’s voice is gentle, despite her rough appearance. “Thanos will have that stone.”
Steve shakes his head. “That’s not gonna happen.”
Peter tries not to listen too much to Strange. Instead, he focuses on Tony, who’s next to him. No, he’s on him. Tony has his arm wrapped around Peter’s shoulder, as if he’s afraid Peter would disappear if he wasn’t holding on to him. Peter doesn’t mention it. At this point, his Dad is the best comfort in the world.
“Alright, just get over here, please,” he finally gets out. “Mr. Lord, can you get your folks to circle up?”
Steve falls silent. The book drops on the ground, though he remains unmoving, frozen in place. “What? Wow, that’s… amazing and…” Steve lowers his gaze after that. “Terrifying, now that I think of it.”
“Hey, what’s going on?” he asks curiously as he finally seems to see the change on the screen as well. They’re nearing the surface, it seems. And they’re not slowing down.
“On it!” Peter shouts back, swinging out of the park. Tony regrets his words immediately; he hates seeing Peter in battle, but it’s worse when he’s out there, far from Tony. He just has to trust that his son can hold his own for now.
He’s just following the sounds. There’s nothing more for him to do right now; he has no plan, has no idea in which way he’s in his advantage here. This guy can move things with his mind, including those glass-like blades that he’s currently sticking up Strange’s face.
“Hi,” Tony takes the man’s finger rather than his hand. What is he doing?!
“Sorry, we got a problem,” he admits, sadly. Behind him, Scott lets out a bitter laugh.
“That’s rarely good.” Hilde still smiles; she doesn’t care about what other people say.
She hears rather than sees the other stones powering up. With large eyes, she looks up to see what he’s up to, only to notice the glow of green on his thumb side of the gauntlet. For a moment, she wonders why that reminds her of Strange’s stone, until-
“It’s over,” Peter tells him. “He’s gone. We’re alive.”
In an instant, a big, powerful blast throws her away from where she’s standing. The last thing she remembers seeing is yellow, glowing lines cracking through Vision’s skin, and after that, the stone must have broken.
But Pepper, the woman he goes to for all his questions, the woman who guides him to the better path, disagrees with him, makes it obvious that it
“What do you- what do you think is coursing through my veins right now?”
“I’m sorry, honey,” Tony returns, feeling a tear roll out of his eyes.
He’s about to ask for more. About to demand answers, but Strange disappears as well, leaving only Tony, Peter and the blue woman here.
She finds her staring straight ahead most of the time these days. It’s become a bit of a normal occurrence, but so far Hilde hasn’t really taken the time to ask about it.
It takes her too long to get back on her feet. The two creatures are holding their weapons against Vision, sticking it against the stone. Vision lets out the most agonizing noises, which brings up a strong anger inside of her. With quick movements, she shoots off two more blasts to get the monsters away from him. Then she picks Vision off the ground, levitating both of them into the air to get away from there as quickly as possible.
Hilde sighs again, already tired of this. But she figures the best way to get back to her people is by doing what this man asks of her, so she starts speaking.
“I suggest that somebody is you?” Strange tries. Tony turns around, giving him an unimpressed look.
“That’s really great, you guys!” Clint is the last one to approach them. Rather than giving them individual hugs, he wraps each arm around both of them and pulls them together. The others quickly decide to join, making this their first – yes, literally – group hug ever. Tony feels himself getting a bit squished after Bruce joins in, though he’s still amused because of it.
“It’s really unclear; the entire school was empty when we were trying to find somebody.” They had been there, but the school looked abandoned. Like it had been so for the past year or so. Yet Steve’s pretty sure that he’s had contact with X about two weeks ago, so they couldn’t have been gone that long. Surely, that means that something happened at that place and they went back into hiding. There’s no telling where they are right now.
“I know it seems like a selfish act, but I can assure you that it’s not. You must take Yaël away from here as quickly as you can.”
Disappointment goes through her when the half hour comes to an end. Hilde feels her heart sink a bit. The bitter truth is that there’s nothing else to do; she gave it a shot, but found nothing.
He had it made a while back, but only thought of carrying it along with him after returning from the past. He had hoped that he could give it to him on a happier occasion, but he’s out of options now.
“I don’t feel so good,” he says while he looks at his hands. Yet there’s no sign of Peter fading away, is there?
Yaël doesn’t return; she gets back to America, back to her friends. And eventually, Hilde gets an invitation from Bruce – who appears to be back as well – who suggests she comes over to the States to celebrate something called ‘Christmas’.
“I need to get a few more people.”
Thanos raises the gauntlet, and all the stones start glowing. Peter gives him a pleading look.
Wanda has to deal with the situation, and this might just break her.
Howard smiles, genuinely, upon hearing that. “A girl would be nice. Less of a chance she’s turn out exactly like me.”
“What is it saying?” she asks. The words leave her mouth much easier than they used to. She’ll probably never lose her accent, but the fact that she no longer has any trouble to form sentences is something she’s rather pleased with.
“Do it, Quill! I can take it!” he shouts.
“Did we get them all?” asks Bruce while he’s holding the familiar amulet Strange once wore in his hands. The ones carrying stones all raise them up in the air, bringing the count to six. Natasha and Clint give each other a high-five upon realizing that they’ve made it.
The dot is shining even more brightly than before. It’s expanding, further and further, the readings getting completely confused about what’s happening.
“WHAT DID YOU DO?!” he asks when the waiting gets too long.
“Maguna?” he asks. The nickname stuck after Morgan kept on saying her own name wrong at first. Tony picks up the little toy rat on the ground and looks it over. “Morgan P. Stark, you want some lunch?”
Despite having Tony’s permission to return to the team, Steve stays at home and spends some more time with Morgan. Tomorrow, she’ll go back to Pepper and Happy’s, so he’s probably just trying to get as much time together as possible.
Gamora found the whereabouts of the Soul Stone a while ago. Or, well, it’s not as much an exact location, as it is a way to track it down. She doesn’t want to know what kind of ancient technology it took for her to figure it out; it’s probably with an ancient relic that existed even before the Infinity Stones ever did.
“I’m serious.”
Peter’s safe, that’s enough for Tony. He needs to get Strange now, after all. He forces himself onto the ship, only taking one step inside when FRIDAY speaks up.
“No, we don’t say that. Only Daddy says that word; he coined it, so it belongs to him.” He’s talking about himself, obviously. That doesn’t seem to hold Morgan back.
Clint nods. “Asked me if I was going for the new model of an Avenger suit. He wasn’t a fan of the colors.”
Clint pokes her in the side, and together they walk away, leaving the unconscious girl where they know their past selves will find her again. If everything goes well, they’ll have her filled up with the stone again in no time. They head back to where they came from, and wait to meet up with the others.
“Right now, hope is all we can do.”
By the time they’re entering the meeting room they find Rhodey deep in conversation with Secretary Ross. To be fair, Steve had hoped that they’d seen the last of him after the whole accord-business, but obviously that’s not going to happen; their line of work demands lots of contact with him.
“We should at least discuss it?” Scott suggests.
“That face goes there.” Tony puts his hand in front of her face and pushes her head gently onto the pillow. Morgan chuckles but lets him do so.
There’s silence.
Okay, it probably hasn’t been hours, yet, but it sure feels like it.
“Maybe we should get back, finish this whole thing and get done with it. The sooner we get the others back, the faster we can find some peace in our life.” It’s Bruce who suggests it. He’s pointing back at the compound, where they left the others to relax for a bit. The team nods, all of them getting back on their feet. Noticing that Thor is the last one to move, Natasha heads to him and hooks her arm into his.
Vision gets it. He gets it, but he also doesn’t. He’s asking her to do something she can’t bear to live with. Something he won’t live to see the repercussions of. He won’t know what becomes of her if she does this.
Steve takes Pepper’s place in Tony’s medical room. Tony doesn’t point it out. He knows Steve feels bad enough, already.
“And still conversely, it may also be his best chance
Tony freezes. Wait, he hadn’t thought of that. Calculating back, it’s indeed… no, wait…
Instead, he directs his next words to Bruce. “Hey, do you want a piece?” he asks, as if he’s offering Bruce his last piece of pie. That in itself is really rare since Tony doesn’t share his pie.
“It’s much like I expected; kind of boring, endless, dark.” Dr. Cho sighs. “But I’m rather here actually helping than on Earth where all I can do is wait. She needs me.” The doctor nods to the person behind them.
Sam follows, not that much later. He flies up in the sky, circling once around Steve as more portals start appearing around them. Near the ground, but also in the air. Thanos says nothing during that time, but he does seem a bit confused about it.
Tony chuckles despite the situation.
Yaël explained to her once that that was what had driven Wilson mad. Hilde can believe that part.
Natasha looks down at the paper Clint is holding, lifting her hand to her mouth.
He hadn’t been paying attention, because suddenly there’s a little girl standing next to him, wearing a blue Iron-man helmet and holding out her gloved hand. Yeah, he bought his own merch. She made him do it after they went shopping together – under disguise, that is – and she begged him to buy it.
Yaël must have seen it all happen. The pregnant woman is standing there impatiently as Hilde re-enters the airlock with the thrusters, now holding an extra weight in her arms. A weight that actually becomes heavy once the door closes behind her and gravity has returned. She comes down with a loud noise as metal meets the floor.
Natasha chuckles at the thought that they might have been responsible for her being out of Thanos’ clutches. It’s good to have a win, once in a while.
“It sort of seems like you can,” Steve counters with a hopeful sigh.
“Crap,” she mutters out. This sucks. Though when she hears the footsteps nearing, she gets back into action, running towards the refrigerator and crawling inside. It’s cold, making her wrap her arms around her body as she shivers, crawling inside deeper.
“What do you want to know about your brother?” Tony gently strokes Morgan’s hair out of her face while he offers her a sad smile.
Peter helps him back up on his feet. It’s quiet around them, yet there’s something heavy in the air. Something Tony can’t explain. When he looks around, the others look a bit lost, except for Strange, who appears to know everything that’s about to happen.
“If you hear anybody approaching, clear the screen and get back into that vent.” Once she sees nobody, she starts running again. She doesn’t even give Odal the time to answer to her instruction.
It’s going back and forth, neither really hitting the other. Steve thinks he’s made progress when the one he’s up against loses his staff, only to get a strong hand on his throat. Steve struggles to get out of his hold, feeling his breath getting strained for a bit.
“It’s ridiculous.” Tony fights back another laugh as he looks at the scene in front of him. Next to him, Scott climbs up onto his shoulder, tiny again.
Steve approaches him, trying to grab a hold on the dust. But it’s nothing more than that; dust.
“You telling me this’ll actually work?” Rhodey sounds surprised as he looks over at Tony with the purple orb in his hand. Next to him, Nebula stills seems to be unsteady at her feet. She squints over at everybody, as if she’s seeing them all for the first time. Tony just blames it on the time-travel.
Chapter warning: major character death.
Steve presses his lips together, a clear indication that he’s not going to speak further. Peggy laughs, then.
“Hang on, son!” Tony shouts without realizing it. He would fly off, but it seems like Big doesn’t give him much of a chance to do so. When the jerk actually throws some electrifying device onto him, making him unable to move, he figures that he’s pretty much toast right here.
“Okay, so, how do we do this? Do we ask the stone, gently?” Clint kneels down next to Natasha and looks over the unconscious body in front of them. “I bet you fifty that won’t work.”
Hilde rolls her eyes. “What have we done to deserve this?”
“That’s 100% you.”
“What dance-off?” He’s probably going to regret this, but he has to ask. Anything to make a plan should be helpful.
Thanos?! No, I’m here to kill Thanos, he took my girl- Wait, who are you?” Finally, FINALLY Quill lowers the blaster and turns to Strange, though still holding on to Peter who now takes off his helmet as well.
Tony wants to cry it out, but his suit still doesn’t allow him to move. The sight of Okoye, accompanied by T’Challa and Shuri is such a sight for sore eyes. Without saying a word, the three slowly walk up to Steve in the same pace, looking over at him as if to greet the super soldier. All Steve can do is stare while trying to catch his breath.
“Tony, what the hell?” Steve grits out the moment Tony’s reached him. They make their way back to the abandoned little room they came in at. There are a couple of more people they pass by, but none of them even look up at them.
“Thanos is coming,” the girl simply says.
After that he goes back to the SHIELD headquarters, putting the Tesseract back. He disappears before anybody can see him.
That’s better.
“Oh, it’s just a book on composting,” Steve admits. He’s been working so much on the garden, of course he would be reading up on it.
bad now, is it?
Yeah… Since then.
Steve knows
Okoye throws her spear, but is thrown aside. Natasha is buried under large blocks of Earth.
“Tony, you lost another super bot?” Bruce asks nervously.
“I’ve spared enough lives, today,” returns Thanos. Peter closes his eyes and hugs Tony tightly. If he’s going down, Peter’s going with him. Tony won’t have to go through this, alone. They’re in this, together.
“We’ve done lots of things together. You’ll have to be specific.”
“It’s too late,” says Vision behind them. “We need to destroy the stone, now.”
yet. Just as quietly as before, she opens the door back up. Hidden behind from debris, she finds Yaël hidden, looking at the fight in front of them. Everybody has their backs turned in their direction, so Hilde comes to join her.
“What’s going on?” she wonders, though not speaking up. She doesn’t want to catch the attention of Thanos, who has his eyes closed. Gamora knows he’s not sleeping, but he’s ‘charging up’ as they say. He’s preparing himself for recapturing the Soul Stone.
“I know you got a lot on the line, with your daughter. But I lost someone very important to me. A lost of people did. And now we have a chance to bring her back. To bring everyone back. And you’re telling me that won’t even-“
“Alright everybody, stay where you are. Chill the fuck out,” the man says, moving his blaster so that he can remove his helmet – and huh, this guy is human? “I’m gonna ask you this one time; Where’s Gamora?” Now the gun is no longer pointed at Peter, but at Tony, instead.
“I did,” Scott counters, but Tony shakes his head.
“Alright, we’re optimistic, yes. I like your plan, except it sucks so let me do the plan, and that way it might be really good.”
Wanda can’t explain what she’s feeling. There have been too many deaths today. Though, not only today. She’s lost her parents, her grandparents in Sokovia. She lost her brother when they were trying to fix the mess they created. She lost Peter days ago. How could she even do this?
Feeling like he has to get out of there right away, Tony hurries back to Steve’s side, not at all even noticing how Howard turns to look back at him with a confused look.
“If you can get me Vision’s body, and if you say that you can still ‘sense’ him inside of there, I think I can make something work,” she states. There’s a little bit of hope coming back to him, and while he doesn’t feel the strength to really show it he’s actually happy for Wanda. Besides, while it’s a bit of hope, it’s not a promise for success. Vision’s body, where-ever it is, has been left for five years. Who knows if Wanda can even still feel him somewhere inside of there.
Tony bites his lip for a moment and lets out a deep breath. “My old man was hard on me, too. I never really thought he really…
If they do this right, it won’t take too much time. One at a time, they jump forward to distract her, make her use her powers at them while hurting herself with it. Even Natasha has to admit that, while she’s powerful, her powers aren’t all that practical. To use them at the cost of one self? It’s not a way to enter battle, that much she knows.
“You must do it, Wanda. Please. We are out of time.” Wanda feels her lower lip tremble as Vision pulls up her hand and puts it against his cheek. When she feels his skin underneath her fingers, she finally stops interrupting him for a moment. Her eyes never look away from his as he speaks to her.
“I want two sides, one side over here and one over there,” the one Thor threw on the ground starts saying, pointing at the two different locations he mentions. “Divide yourself equally. Co-operate, and things will be more pleasant for everybody.”
“Shit,” says Morgan excitedly. Tony thought Steve had brought her to bed, already, as she came to give him a goodnight kiss already. Seeing her sitting on the stairs, she must have been watching Tony work again. He shouldn’t have been surprised.
There’s the usual banter always needed to lighten the mood a bit, but Steve’s not entirely joining in on it. His mind is still stuck in space, where two of the most important people in his life are currently stuck with maybe no way home. After they finish here, if they finish here, they need to start a rescue search.
Hilde ignores her own tears as she pulls the other girl along in the hallway. Fear creeps up to her when some glowing, purple light starts surrounding them, creeping up into the entirety of the ship. Shit, they’re running out of time. This whole ship might just explode on them!
But Peter loses his footing. He stumbles forward, right into Tony’s arms. “I don’t know what’s- I don’t know what’s happening. I don’t-“ he ends up with a sob, unable to finish his sentence. Peter is scared, and Tony doesn’t know what to do.
Thor, now dressed in armor and with his hair pulled up. His long, formerly-messy beard has now been braided together. He looks very much the Norse God the stories depict him as.
He’s updated on everything that happened the day after returning to Earth. All of the Avengers that remain have gathered together, but next to that, there are also a couple of Mutants that must have been present for the battle, as well as Susan Storm and Reed Richards. Nebula and the Raccoon, Rocket have also joined, but those two are especially quiet.
The titan gets on his feet and takes his helmet off his sword and puts it back over his head.
“Hello, Aunt Hilde,” greets Raido. Despite her often telling him that she’s not his aunt, he’s always ignored her and kept on calling her that. Yaël is not too far behind him. She puts a hand on her son’s shoulder and even bends down to pick him up.
Steve finally turns around, now noticing the yellow glowing circle slowly getting larger. Having never seen one before, he looks at it with a frown. Especially when three people come walking out, each and one of them looking angry as Hell.
“You keep on surprising me,” says Thanos while he looks down on the black-haired figure. When he reaches out for him, the man holds himself over the woman next to him. A woman holding a newborn baby in her arms.
Much to his unawareness, outside the ship, Peter finishes his climb back on the vehicle, looking down at the world underneath him with a shaky breath, his back pressed against the metal behind him.
Walking outside, Tony finds that it’s good outside. The weather’s pleasant, the sun shining through the few clouds that are in the sky. He never thought he would enjoy living in the nature that much, but here he is.
With a moment of quiet, he looks over at Strange. For a few seconds, he can’t help but stare. Strange is
Pepper gives him another sad look. “May disappeared. As well as Ned, MJ, Harry and Johnny.”
“Bruciebear? What are you doing there?” Tony suddenly asks. He waves at Pepper before walking up to the portal. He ignores Strange but rather just steps through it to face Bruce, who looks nervous. That’s never good.
offering him to get some air? Together? Who is this man and how has he ever become the Howard Stark Tony knew?
Not that she’s settled down. She’s not capable of settling down, that much she’s aware of. But she’s had her few adventures on her days off. Life would be boring without it.
“But you didn’t come back here to stay,” Peggy states, having noticed it immediately. Steve sighs.
“Not you idiots, I’m meaning these in the back.” The soldier walks past them, approaching Wanda and Vision and putting his hands on their shoulders before moving on to Hilde and Yaël, doing the same with them. “How was vacation?”
obvious, Wanda can tell that his voice is slightly shaking. She throws her legs over the bed and gets on her feet to make her way to Vision.
Strange looks conflicted and shakes his head. “If I tell you what happens, it won’t happen.”
“Alright, move it Stuart Little. Things are getting dicey up here. Let’s go.”
Looking at this place, he figures that this feels more like home than he would have imagined a room he never entered being. It’s like Tony knew exactly how to make it Peter’s. It’s been cleaned, kept tidy over the years, but it’s obvious that other for that reason nobody ever came in here.
“Daniel?”
Peter nods, seeing her flying past Thanos without trouble. That is, except when Thanos throws his weapon towards a particular brown van Peter knows is important for some reason. There’s a large explosion, and Carol is thrown off her course. The gauntlet flies out of her hand and falls down on the ground.
“I just feel you,” she admits, cupping his cheek once again. Vision looks only slightly disappointed at the lack of an answer. His own hand goes onto the back of her head, his eyes never leaving hers. Slowly, he leans forward to press their lips together in another tender kiss. It’s not heated, but it still warms her body with love and adoration. But she can’t tell him that. Not yet.
At last, with the great distraction, Strange finally manages to get a good grip on Thanos’ gauntlet. Everybody jumps together at once, giving their own hand on subduing the giant. Quill uses some device to pull his right arm down. Tony grabs the gauntlet. Peter throws some webs and manages to stay in place with the claws. Strange makes a portal, and at last Mantis appears from above. She’s stayed out of the fight mostly, since she doesn’t have any obvious attack-style. But right now it’s her moment to shine.
“Somebody get to Vision!” he calls through the comms, but when Thor gives him a look, the God of Thunder merely shrugs. He has no idea where they are.
“Where are we going?” somebody asks behind her. Hilde recognizes Korg following her. So he made it out, that’s good. She’s going to need his strength in the last bit.
him, so somebody has to travel to Scotland.”
“They’re on another space mission,” she explains. “They’ll keep an eye out for Pete and Tony. You know the two teenagers are friends, so they’ll do their best to find them.”
But wait, that means-
“And I-“ he starts, though it seems to be hard to get through the words. “Am… Iron Man.”
“Steve?” Peggy asks with a breaking voice. Steve clears his throat, unable to look away from those brown eyes of hers. Her lips as fiery red as always, her hair put up neatly. She’s in a pink dress, though her feet are bare.
Trigger warnings: I do want to share these for this chapter. In case you don't want to be spoiled, I'm putting them in the end notes. But, please, if this stuff easily gets to you, prepare yourself by checking over the warnings.
“Steve,” Tony whispers out. The beard is gone, though the red skin on his chin means it must have happened only recently. His hair is still as long as Tony remembers it. Looking at Steve, Tony realizes it’s a sight he never thought he’d see again.
Tony sits down on the floor, right in front of where he put down the helmet. He hasn’t picked it up for a long while. There’s no use for it, anymore.
“Because we have each other, and that’s all Tony ever wanted for us,” she says. “His mission was to get you back. To keep us safe. And he died knowing that he’d succeeded. That’s the best thing we could wish for him in this situation.”
“Alright, the glove’s ready,” Rocket eventually declares. “Question is, who’s gonna snap their freaking fingers?”
“I will shred this universe down to its last atom. And then, with the stones you’ve collected for me, created a new one. Teeming with life, but knows not what it has lost but only what it has been given. A grateful universe.”
Wanda can see it in Steve’s movements that he’s getting exhausted. Despite that, he holds on to his shield, lets out a deep breath and takes a step forward.
“But you didn’t think!” Tony hisses, suddenly marching up towards Peter and grabbing his arm, shaking him a bit without thinking about it. Peter doesn’t seem bothered by it as he just keeps on talking.
,” Peter says, sounding a bit breathless.
“Yeah, uh… surprise,” Steve tries.
As they’re gathered, Bruce and Rocket agree to travel to New Asgard to get Thor back on their team. He might be a little hard to convince, much like Tony had been, now that he has a family of his own. Tony’s certain that Jane might be able to persuade him.
“We need to get the Hulk,” she whispers, clearly not intending to follow Loki’s orders, either. Hilde quickly nods, casting the crowd around them one last look before hurrying after Yaël. Standing in front of the door is Korg, who gives them one short nod before shielding the door away completely. Silently, Hilde opens it, and the two women get through.
“I know, right?” Finally, with a well-placed blow onto Yaël’s head, she’s down on the ground. Not yet knocked out, but Clint’s already on that. He shoot’s an arrow right at her face, which explodes so close to her that she loses consciousness instantly.
Why would the Grand Master need a fridge that looks like maze?
“How far away are we?” Yaël asks with clear annoyance, though allowing Helen to draw some blood. She flinches a bit when the needle goes through her skin, but other than that she doesn’t react from it.
Once the beam stops, Steve can see three vague figures standing there. It takes him a short moment to see who it is. It’s the sight of the cape that makes him realize it with glee. He grins upon seeing his friend for the first time in years. It’s been very long since they’ve last seen each other.
“Pete, I’m so glad to see you,” the super soldier says without letting go. Peter automatically moves his arms up to hug him back, though he’s feeling very exhausted right now.
But suddenly Quill punches his weapon against Thanos’ face, accidentally hitting Mantis on her hands. The girl pulls away with a painful cry. He feels Tony pull away, meaning that Peter has to give it his all. He pulls, harder and harder while his Dad tries to stop the man who is currently ruining his
“I’ll start up the escape pods, you go get Bruce, alright?” Hilde asks. Yaël nods, heading into the direction of where the Hulk is supposed to be. Hilde wonders, for a short second, if she’s not making the biggest mistake of them all by separating. But, she figures they don’t have much time. They need to hurry if they don’t want half of their people massacred.
“What are you reading?” he asks, but then he looks over at the model on his desk the next room over. FRIDAY never put it away, just kept it there for Tony to look at. He loses his thoughts a bit while observing it.
With a stammering Scott in the background, Tony gives Steve the numbers he think are correct.
Tony, who is still held up by Peter, turns to Strange. The sorcerer hasn’t moved from where he’d been sitting. “Tony, there was no other way,” he tells him. It’s the first time he addresses him by the first name.
Tony rolls his eyes. He really needs to have another conversation with him about what they’re supposed to call each other in public when they’re like this.
“Hey,” she says to calm him down. As if it’s an automatic reaction, Vision’s right hand holds on to her wrist in search for contact. She frowns slightly; while these reactions aren’t new, this time it seems like he’s even more troubled than before.
“Can we do that?” Nat then asks. Bruce shakes his head.
,” Ross counters as Rhodey takes a step back and crosses his arms. As he moves, the automatic braces whir along with it.
Peter would be close to his friends; Ned would come over and watch a movie. Harry would be vague about his own project and maybe drop a hint that he went on another date with MJ. And then MJ would deny it, because she’s not dating Harry, obviously, why would anybody think that?
The ship moves forward, still, nearing some structures that look like they’ve had better days in the past. He figures it’s a ship, perhaps. Or an old building. And as they approach, one of these building-things seems to get closer and closer. Much closer than Tony would like.
“He was. Then he wasn’t.” Steve sighs. “We also have a kid.”
“No, he lived in Toronto. Were you even paying attention?”
“Then why did you come here?” Peggy leans back in her chair, her brown eyes staring him down. Steve chuckles hesitantly.
“Maybe we should get back to work, huh?” Peter suggest, realizing that there’s trouble ahead. Steve nods;
“What is this guy’s problem, Mr. Stark?” Peter asks from where he’s standing up, all the way back at the fountain. Well, at least he remembers now that ‘Dad’ is not acceptable while dressed as Spider-Man.
“So, how long is he staying this time?” Pepper suddenly asks. Tony clears his throat, pulling his mind out of the train of thought. She’s probably right, after all. It’s too soon. Way too soon.
“I’m getting us out of here,” Hilde explains without looking up. She doesn’t want to look back at the pregnant woman, carrying the sole heir to the Asgardian Throne inside of her. She has to remember her promise to herself. Her promise to the future king of Asgard.
“Cap. Captain. Steve. Sorry, America. Rogers. Look, if you do this, and this doesn’t work, you’re not coming back.”
And it’s true that the gravity here isn’t as strong as back on Earth, as is proven when the girl – Mantis, Tony remembers – starts jumping up and down on a spot that must have a particular low gravity. Tony catches Peter observing her, clearly in a bind on whether or not to join her. He’s probably hesitant because he’s supposedly an Avenger now, and Avengers don’t mess around. Much.
“THANOS!” A blade is thrown at Strange, but the man deflects it without trouble. He sends his cloak to the large man’s face, throwing him on the floor. The man in the middle, with the red glowing eyes, flies up into the air, shooting at Tony with what seem like two little blasters. They go one-on-one for a bit, but where Tony has his strength, this guy seems to have nasty little gadgets in return, as is proven when he puts some sort of magnet onto Tony’s suit and gets him literally stuck onto the ship.
“With your car?” He only asks it after noticing the lack of keys in his hands. Steve then shrugs again.
“Nat, we did stand. Yet, here we are…” Tony’s eyes meet Steve’s. He hates that he’s disappointing him. Natasha turns her head, probably to hide away from them. He wonders what he’s doing here; once upon a time, they were his team and he would have gone high and above for them. This time, all he can see are the ways this plan can fail.
Now Vision also turns his head towards Bruce. Steve has no idea what’s going on.
“I’m sorry, I’m not,” Steve admits eventually. He looks away from the open space he’d been staring into and turns towards his friend. The others are preparing Vision into Shuri’s upper lab, so Steve should probably join them.
But Thanos is ahead of her. Accessing her sister’s memory files, an old conversation she’s had with Nebula not too long ago plays out like a faded flashback. She and Nebula were about to part again after the whole Ego-business. For some reason, Gamora felt the need to share this piece of information. It had been a new thing she wanted to try; sharing secrets with her sister.
she suggests, and Peter laughs. He hadn’t even thought of that, before!
But physical exercise is necessary, according to Dr. Cho. And to be fair, the only exercise he’s been having in the past few months is the mindblowing, extremely hot sex he’s been having with Steve. Because, to be completely honest, the sex is exhausting in so many ways! Tony shivers even thinking about it now while he runs, though it’s the good kind of shiver. Exhausting, yes, but still good, let’s not forget that!
They meet up at the alley again. Natasha and Clint are already there, all four of them resting in an abandoned car full of debris on top of it. The two former-assassins look pretty fine on first glance, and when Steve finally jumps off the building and goes down on the street, they hold up their stone in excitement.
Mjölnir. Literally, he’s holding the hammer.
“I’ll go with you if we return to the wreckage,” Yaël eventually says. Hilde’s head snaps up.
Tony doesn’t answer, there’s no time for that. He gets to the hole, sends out some of the nanos in its direction and immediately the hole gets shut. When there’s no more sucking them into outer space, both Strange and Peter fall down on the ground with a grunt.
Warnings: some Infinity War dialogue
“I’m pretty sure there would have been, to get the two other stones.”
Nebula helps him on his feet. Tony has no idea where she gets her strength, but being part machine must help with her survival. She guides him through the exit of the ship, where the lock seems to have opened. Carefully, they walk down the stairs.
Peter jokes out.
,” says Rhodey through the comms.
Steve, who must have heard the conversation behind him, activates his communicator and lets out a soft sigh. Wanda can see him in the corner of her eyes, but she doesn’t turn towards him. All she wants to keep her attention to is Vision.
“You’re right,” Yaël points out, startling nearly everybody in the room as she hasn’t so far spoken at all. “But it should. After all, yours is not the only stone here. And while the mind stone might be attached to you on a matter of life and death, mine isn’t.”
“See, ‘not winging it’ isn’t really what they do,” he admits. That’s when Peter decides to join in on the conversation.
“Thanks! You’re the best, buddy!”
Tony sighs, walking up the stairs before he turns back to look at Natasha. She’s barely been to visit, probably because of the child in Tony’s hold. Of course, Morgan has no idea the red-haired women further away is her grandmother. What are they going to say?
“Don’t do this,” Gamora begs, though she knows it won’t do anything good.
“Thank you,” Tony finishes. He supposes today’s as good a day as any to be wearing the workout cloths. With a quick movement, he pulls on the two cords, tightening up the suit around him. At least that way it’s less baggy when he does his next thing. Tapping his finger on the container on his chest, he feels the metal starting to emerge around him.
Tony blinks back at him, grinning before he realizes it. His mind wanders back to the finished model downstairs. He could try and perfect it even more, get a 100% success rate if he puts a bit more time on it.
not in the mood for it.
So Hilde makes it her special mission to keep this child alive, no matter what.
Before he can put another hand on Vision, Steve tackles him to the ground with all the force he has. While he gets back on his feet, he looks over to Vision who doesn’t seem to be moving at all despite his blinking.
“We could let out a distress signal,” Gamora says breathily as she leans back against the wall with her eyes closed. She pulls her hand away from her wound, finding that she’s already bleeding through the bandage. As soon as Helen Cho notices, she hurries to her side and gestures for her to lie down. Gamora shakes her head.
Tony nods without really realizing it. Quill pauses for dramatic effect before pointing at them smugly.
“You should have gone for the head.”
Morgan seems to have forgotten about the strange people rather quickly. The moment she’s got her food to munch on, Tony sits on his seat next to hers and leans back while he rubs his hand over his face. This here, he wouldn’t even have expected, anymore. He knew Natasha never stopped trying, but Steve…
“World governments are in pieces. The parts that are still working are trying to take a census. And it looks like he did exactly what he said he was gonna do; Thanos wiped out fifty percent of all living creatures.”
Hilde knows who she means. The woman is looking over at her son, whose eyes are stuck on the TV screen in fascination. The child doesn’t even hear them talking, so entranced by the two bears talking to one another.
“You’re from Earth?” he means to ask it, but it’s more of a statement, really.
“Oh no,” Tony groans. Excited fans, he can handle. Happy children even more. But please, not…
Wanda bites her lip. She can’t really help it. Befriending Peter Parker has been one of the first steps she needed to begin letting go of her brother. And she knows that Pietro will always be a hole in her chest, the missing half of their whole, but somehow along the way she’s come to consider Peter as some person she needs to take care of. In a small amount.
“Right, well. Imagine you’re SHIELD, running a quasi-fascistic intelligence organization. Where do you hide it?”
Another sad scene incoming
“Whatever it takes. Good luck.”
It’s a good celebration, a good distraction. And to be fair, the whole business about this Thanos completely slips her mind from meeting all these new people. After all, he’s just a guy who collects some stones for his stupid armband.
Wanda has made a promise, though. One she intends to keep, which means that, under no circumstances, she would read Vision’s mind unless she gets his specific approval. So far, she’s never had to, either, but even she has to admit that the urge has been there more often than not in these days that Vision seems to be uneasy.
Loki has regained his Asgardian skin color. He’s once again pale, yet he’s maybe looking even paler than before. His eyes are tired, sad and surrounded by red circles. His hair is sticky and plastered onto his face, yet he doesn’t let that stop him from taking care of his son.
“Yeah?” Tony startles, not having realized that he actually wandered off with his thoughts.
“That’s what you want. How did you find this?” Tony holds up the helmet and looks at her questioningly. Yeah, Morgan is maybe 100% completely normal, but she’s still inventive and extremely sneaky.
“My old man, he never met a problem he couldn’t solve with a belt.”
Natasha gives him a long look while Steve moves forward to sit down on another, empty chair. It’s the only empty one – the others are filled with even more maps.
“I can’t,” Strange continues. “Because the universe depends on it.”
Oh, so Bruce calls it Bucky-time, too. How quaint. Tony rolls his eyes, but eventually he does pick up the phone. He finds that he has a message from Peter, who tells him that he just left for the field trip. Tony smiles slightly, though it changes into a frown immediately when he realizes Peter has no idea what’s about to happen.
But they’ve discussed this. There have been countless of conversations about this particular moment, and Steve is not going to pull back now. He even consulted Bucky about it, who seemed to agree with it as well.
“Oh, we blew it,” he breathes out, the sudden realization falling over him like a wave of ice cold water once he notices the suitcase, along with Loki, are gone.
Tony shakes his head. “Weren’t you the one who wanted me to help you guys out?”
Irritation wells up, Tony points at Drax before addressing Quill. “Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page.” Quill just lets out an exasperated sigh, like he’s used to this happening.
Peter glances over at the newcomer who just spoke. It causes for Quill to turn to her in shock.
“Hello, Tony Stark,” the woman in space greets him. He can hear her through the ship. How is that possible? And how does she know his name? Is she an Angel? Is she here to collect his soul or something?
“How about Steve?” Bruce then interjects. Tony turns towards him, automatically reacting to that name.
a good experience at all.
A cry escapes from Peter, and he’s suddenly frozen in place. Is this real? Is he just stuck in a very, realistic-looking nightmare? His heart skips a few beats as Thanos puts his hand on top of Tony’s, as if he’s about to crush it. He’s talking, but Peter can’t hear it. He’s rushing that way, reaching him at last when Thanos takes a step back.
“Drax I swear, stop calling us morons or I’m going to shoot this at your head,” Quill warns him, holding up his blaster. The man called Drax now looks horrified, putting his hand against his neck.
“We have to go,” Vision suddenly says, grabbing Wanda’s hand and making his way back to where they came from.
Silence falls over them. A TV on the wall is playing the current news, but Tony can’t focus on it. He looks around the room for a bit, but then grabs for his cellphone. Except, there is no cellphone.
“Why aren’t you going with them, then?”
When Peter’s getting too close to the hole in the wall, Tony starts flying up their way. He knows that his suit can’t handle the force for that long, so he needs to make sure that his boots hit the ground immediately. He can’t help but smile, though, when Peter gets surprised by the metallic spider-arms that he created into the suit.
“I don’t really think Steve’s fashion-sense is what actually matters right now,” Natasha points out. She still has her blonde hair but she hasn’t been bleaching it anymore, meaning that there’s already red coming back on the top. As it turns out, the blonde was supposed to trigger some memory of Bucky’s according to her, but it ended up not being necessary in the end. She probably hasn’t yet found the time nor the motivation to change it.
“I love him, Peggy,” Steve admits. “I thought he died and I- I didn’t know how I could live knowing that he wasn’t there anymore… And it made me realize that
Tony wants to laugh. He wants to cry. He wants to do so many things, but at this point, all he can do is step forward.
She hopes he’s alright. Hopes that he’s not going to do anything stupid. She’s already surrounded by stupid – not that she dislikes the rest of the group, but it’s true that they’re not the brightest people in the bunch.
“Alright, we all have our assignment. Three Stones uptown, one Stone down. Stay low, and keep an eye on the clock.”
“What do you mean, no?” Tony counters. He stops walking without really thinking about it, putting his hands on his hips while he tries to stare her down. Pepper doesn’t look too impressed by it.
So as Scott is ranting against him, Tony can see Natasha and Clint give each other a surprised look. Scott has never really been like this before.
Sam laughs. “Alright, can’t argue with that,” he agrees. After a quick goodbye Sam steps away from the bench. Steve watches him disappear back in the direction of his car. Once Sam’s completely out of view he turns his head to Tony’s.
It’s rare to see Natasha crying, but it’s clear that she’s been pushed to her limit. Steve walks in on her trying her best to hold back her tears after ending another meeting with the guard – that’s what Tony’s started to call them. It must have been more dead ends, probably.
Howard points behind him again, still holding that can. “Wanna get some air?”
No. No way! No, no, no! Don’t tell him that-
“Tony,” shrugs Steve, then. Thor’s eyes widen while he picks up his axe again, preparing himself for another charge of thunder.
And the room suddenly goes cold. Hilde knows that’s not just in her mind; the temperature has seriously dropped down a few degrees, all due to the girl Loki’s desperately holding on to. Her face is looking just as pale as Loki’s, her eyes full of horror, memories. That name means something to her that should probably scare them. The fact is, Hilde needs more than a name to be scared off. Even hearing Hela’s name didn’t bring fear into her. Sure, it pissed her off and it brought back a whole lot of memories she’d rather drink away, but nobody’s perfect, right?
Wanda feels something heavy inside of her. She's way past crying at this point; it's like there are no more tears to shed. But Peter is like her little brother, and the thought that something happened to him makes it a bit hard to swallow past that lump in her throat.
idea, after all.
“It worked!” Tony wraps his arms around Steve and lets out a relieved sob. “We’re going to get my kid back.”
She looks at the people that had been on the ship, scattered around the place and glad to take another breath of fresh air. But there are children who have lost their parents and vice-versa. People who had to let go of their loved ones because they weren’t fast enough in the evacuation. Somewhere, Korg tries to keep everybody’s spirits up but it’s clear that it isn’t working.
“Are those the nanos?” Bruce asks. Of course he knows about them; Tony involved him in the process of making them, after all.
“Among other things, yeah. It’s good you’re here.” Tony gets out of the car and gives Steve a quick greeting kiss on the cheek. Then he heads to the trunk of the car to get his research out.
Oh, that’s Bruce. Tony grunts, realizing he’s leaning against a tree.
People that were lost all start to come back, one by one. But Tony is only looking for one particular portal. If the person he first sees isn’t somebody he recognizes, he moves over to the next one. He only stops once he notices Strange’s ridiculous cape.
“Bruce!” Tony calls out for his friend. Noticing that the others are on their way to help him up, Tony tells them not to move him. He then uses his suit’s healing spray. It doesn’t do magic work, but it mostly helps holding back infections and is quite the effective pain killer. Tony knows; it’s what he used back on Titan after being stabbed by Thanos.
“No, no, sitting here and staring at that thing is not going to bring everybody back.” Thor starts rambling after that, speaking faster the more he wants to make his case clear. Tony steps forward and tries to interrupt him.
“A bit chalky,” Strange responds.
“Talking about adulting, I’m about to do it again.” He looks back at Steve for a moment, swallows past a hard lump in his throat, and then turns back to his friends. “After we get Peter back, Steve and I… we’re gonna get married.”
Tony chuckles. “Oh, was she now?” he asks jokingly. Steve gives him another unimpressed look.
“Tell me a story,” she demands.
“I don’t like you going out there alone, but I feel like Hilde knows what she’s doing.”
Tony smiles, thinking back of that one hot afternoon after school, where he took Peter and May to the city and they had some ice cream. Peter liked The Captain America Cookie Dough, while Tony had to secretly admit he preferred the Bow’n’Arrow Bananas.
“If he gets his hands on all six stones, Tony-“
“Dad?” he asks.
“I’m not.”
The last part is Bruce. Steve sighs in annoyance that he can’t just find them. He nods once at Thor, and then hurries towards any of his other teammates. Anybody who can at least track the others. When he finds none, he asks for specifics.
Tony's adventure in space continues
Then, all he’s holding in his arms is air. The last of Peter’s dust flies up into the air, getting further and further away from Peter. Tony falls forward with a cry. His hands are dirty; they’ve been through Peter’s hair, and now they’re dirty. With dust.
“I love you, dad.”
“Because you still owe me a dance,” he tries. And Peggy’s conflicted face, though initially sad, brightens a bit as she eventually laughs as well. Then she looks down, shaking her head.
Pepper snorts at his complaining. She gently pats him on the shoulder before moving forward again. The trick here is to never stand still during a jog. If he would stop walking, it would become extremely hard for him to pick it back up again. He might just summon the armor here and make it fly him home, that’s how tired he is.
“Oh, God,” Steve mutters, looking over at the Kingdom of Wakanda in the background.
They quickly realize what he’s looking at. Staring ahead, all they find is Thanos, sitting on a piece of debris. When he looks up at them, he doesn’t even bother to move. No, instead, the titan is looking back down at his hand, as if he’s admiring his manicure.
In the past few years, there have been a few times he started tinkering on the armor again, but mostly he’s been putting his attention on Rescue, instead. He wasn’t really planning on being Iron Man, anymore, and the Rescue suit was mostly a joke. At least, that’s what he tells himself now. Back when he started working on it, all he wanted was for Pepper to have a way to protect herself.
“Remember at the end when the woman expelled the thing into space through an airlock?”
Sam, who is now sitting next to Steve, looks over the lake. There they can see Peter on a little boat with Morgan, the two of them laughing suddenly. They look like they’re having fun. Steve’s really glad that they get along so well.
Yaël sits back down carefully. She spilled some of her coffee on the ground, so she scowls at the new stain she just made.
“Well, that’ll be easy to remember.”
His boy, Peter.
As they draw closer to the planet, eventually Strange seems to notice it, too. He comes to stand next to Tony, looking upwards. Neither of them say anything, though Tony’s attention is divided; after all, Peter’s exploring the ship as we speak.
“We gotta turn this ship around,” Strange breathes out while trying to get up. Tony pulls the helmet back, making his way to the controls and finding nothing that even slightly looks like anything on Earth. It’s still easy enough to understand the basics of it, he thinks.
“I can’t say that everything will be fine when they won’t. But I’m sure that, eventually… we’ll be okay-ish. One day, maybe it won’t hurt as much.”
It’s taken a couple of weeks for them to practice, forms of meditation and intense concentration, but eventually Vision managed to make himself appear actually human. Of course, the human form he manages to create is that of a man clearly many years older than hers, but that doesn’t really bother her at all.
They suit up. It’s what they always end up doing. Every one of them has their own thing to wear, adapted to their own body shape – though Tony did have to make some adaptation for Thor’s, as he’s gained even more weight during his time here from all the stress-eating he’s been doing. The constant worrying over his children… that can’t be healthy, right?
He knows he shouldn’t do it. He’s too busy taking out one bad guy after the other to spare a look, but he does it anyway whenever he’s in the air. As he’s shooting a beam towards one of those bastards, or whenever he’s throwing out any other weapons at them that aren’t his repulsors, he can’t help but look to the side once or twice to just catch a glimpse of him.
“You can?” Wanda’s eyes get teary. She smiles when Shuri puts a hand on her shoulder and promises her she will do all she can to make it right. Peter looks down at that. In fact, he’s really glad that his friend gets someone back that she cares about. But Peter can’t help but feel a little bit jealous, still.
Peter’s thrown at Strange, which knocks him down. His head turns for a bit while he takes off his helmet and tries to breathe in some air. There are some more explosions around him, and he hears Tony flying around. Of course, his Dad would never let anything happen to him.
Tony tenses up. Right, he had heard about it, but since the whole business with the accords he hadn’t really paid much more attention to it. Besides, being the dad of a superhero is also pretty tiring business.
“I have to,” comes in return from the super soldier. “I’m just worried… what if they’re dead?”
that Peter might be here and that there’s just some sort of bug with FRIDAY’s tracking system
“It’s alright,” Vision mouths at her. She can’t hear him, but she can read his lips. “I love you.”
She runs into the hallway, expecting the others to follow her. Getting to the hallway computer, she enters the ship’s settings and starts up the emergency alarm. Almost instantly, people start walking out of their rooms to see what’s going on.
While the order’s attention is directed at Loki, who is still standing there – untouched – Hilde grabs the arms of a few of the remaining Asgardians.
“It’s a long story,” she admits. Right when Hilde expects her to speak, there’s the sound of vehicles approaching. They’re all black, stopping close together until one particular man gets out, taking a device to his mouth.
“Yeah, yeah, I’m alright,” he returns before sitting up a bit. “You?”
Thanks to Tony’s earpiece, Peter can follow everything. That’s how he knows that his next destination should be somewhere to his right, where he last saw the Black Panther running away from something.
Suddenly, someone grabs Hilde’s arm. When she turns around, she sees Yaël looking at her with those golden eyes of hers.
That is until she mentions the name ‘Gamora’. Isn’t that the person who the rest of the Guardians were looking for?
think I’m dead, too.”
He can’t much recall his parents’ funeral; he’d been five, and there hadn’t even been bodies to bury. Mostly, Peter had been scared and held on to Aunt May’s hand with tears in his eyes as he wondered when his parents would return and why they left in the first place.
Tony moves to turn the helmet off, though he lingers his thumb over the left eye. It’s over. He doesn’t have it in him anymore. Feeling the chill of endless space, Tony puts on the coat he found a few days earlier. It barely keeps him warm, but it’s better than nothing.
Tony frowns. Peter seems confused, too.
After that, she’s out again. Back to her people.
But they can’t risk it. So Tony’s just going to have to do his absolute best and make sure that nothing is going to happen to his son.
“Maybe not, but unless anybody here carries another Crown of Surtur and the Eternal Flame, there’s about no way for us to fight through this one once again. Except, maybe…”
“-and I just thought about-“
“You left this at home,” Tony tells him, holding up the familiar, round shield. Steve gives it a hard look, unwilling spare it another glance.
“Stone keeper,” Skinny says, turning towards Strange. “Does this chattering animal speak for you?”
“Did you seriously just say ‘hither to undreamt of’?” Tony asks, letting out a small grunt as he pulls on his leg.
“Well… Maybe one day things could be more serious.”
“What’s… what’s going on?” Peter can’t place it. He’s hallucinating his Father here, isn’t he? Is it because he hasn’t taken his pills for the past five years? Because Peter’s pretty sure he didn’t even exist during that time. Did he? What the shit?
“Thor’s sister.”
But after a while it gets too much for him. Nebula’s innocence hits him at his core and he has to distance himself; get some alone-time.
“Right,” Steve sighs. He needs to keep moving. There are much larger things at stake right now. Quickly he raises his head, letting out another long breath as he prepares himself mentally to face this next challenge.
The woman smiles sadly and puts a hand against her chest. “I’m Helen Cho. I’m a doctor, and it’s my specialty to heal wounds like those.”
Tony glances back at Steve, who gives him a knowing look. Tony lets out a shaky breath, and then he leans to the side until he’s completely resting up against Steve, who wraps an arm around his shoulder and holds him close.
They pretty much destroy the church. If their lives hadn’t been in danger, she would have felt more guilty about it. But even as they try to hide away at the train station they’ve been thrown in, the two creatures don’t seem ready to give up just yet.
“Right.” There isn’t much more they’re going to get out of Thor on that matter, so they indicate for him to go and sit again. Thor nods, passing his hand through his long hair, though stopping when his finger gets stuck on a knot. He grumbles as he tries to untie it.
“He did it,” he hears behind him, but he barely pays attention to it. He pulls his arms closer towards him and presses onto his chest to keep it from hurting. But it hurts, nonetheless. It’s always going to hurt.
“Is there anything you can do?” asks Loki while holding his child in his arms. He looks like he can’t hold out much longer.
It was around Gwen’s that he figured that his life was doomed, and that the better way to go was to have no friends at all; at least that way nobody would die. Harry had gone mad, he had just learned his parents were murdered by Oscorp, and then the love of his life died.
Nobody joins in, nobody speaks. They allow them this moment, this reunion that had been short-lived on the battlefield, but can be extended all they want now.
“Infinity Stone?” Thor asks, confused. Hilde just has absolutely no idea what this is about, but she doesn’t ask. Instead, she starts running back towards the door after the ship gets another hit.
“What’s he been doing?” Tony asks for clarification. Thor shakes his head.
He finds a store where he gets some other clothes. He’s got money on him, the vendor doesn’t even look up, just takes it and doesn’t ask questions.
He turns to glance back at Tony, who’s resting on the ground. When he raises his own hand, his own glove adapts itself into a new shape that allows the stones to fit onto it. Knowing what this means, Peter lets out another shout, though he’s immediately stopped by the Princess of Wakanda who seems to have realized the same thing.
Tony takes another breath, surprised, actually, that Strange hasn’t yet interrupted him.
It can’t actually be…?
“They’ll never know it. Because you won’t be alive to tell them.”
“What’d be so awful about that?” asks Tony, pretending to be confused though he understands his words more than ever.
“What are you talking about? Where are we going?” asks Scott, who is being kept out of the conversation. Natasha and Clint stop him, both of them knowing that they shouldn’t interrupt the two as they’re brainstorming like this.
Thor charges up again. Steve glares at Thanos. “Born out of blood,” he corrects the titan.
Hurray, Natasha lives!!
He’s glad that he came to stand in front of the chair, as he falls back in his shock. Bewildered by the discovery, Tony lets out a surprised gasp before he puts his hand on his face. Never, ever in his life did he expect to find anything as close to this.
Steve rolls his eyes and scoffs, though he can’t help laughing as well. When he returns his attention to his book, Tony moves to sit down next to him.
“I’ll go and look around,” Hilde says lowly towards the woman who is busy looking out of the window in search for anything.
“Shhh, it’s alright, Son. You did great. You did so good.” Tony gently strokes through Peter’s hair to keep it out of his face. But it’s no use. By the seconds, more and more of Peter disappears.
She finds Vision where Steve told her they were. Steve is making work on getting any kind of weapons from the large body with the spear through its chest. Rather than focusing on them, she hurries to Vision who seems to be grunting in pain. The wound in his chest looks even larger than it did before. She holds out her hand towards it, wishing now more than ever that she had healing abilities, instead.
“That’s too high a price.”
Wade would stop constantly
“I am not leaving this ship. Who-ever this person is, whatever he wants, we’ll meet him and we’ll find a solution,” Thor says, crossing his arms and pulling up a smirk. Hilde feels compelled at rolling her eyes upon seeing the smugness on his face. Diplomacy, it’s an idea he’s trying to follow, though Hilde’s not sure if it’s a process he can actually follow through.
Hilde wanders through the hallways for a little while. It seems like the general meeting is over and everybody is preparing to leave. The only voices she hears are those of Yaël and Steve, somewhere in the common room. She stops in her tracks and make sure she can’t be seen.
“Spidey, that’s the wizard. Get on it!”
“I mean no, as in, you haven’t even been together an entire year. It’s too soon to start talking about kids.”
Big is starting to run. Tony walks forward as well. He throws his glasses to the side, hoping they’re not broken, since they were the best pair he has. When he sees Big swing his axe in his direction, Tony lets the suit form a shield on his arm, which he uses to stop the blow.
The four nod, marching past Thor and directing their attention to the people of Asgard.
“Don’t worry,” she says in that familiar Sokovian accent. Right next to her, Okoye prepares her spear.
“Come on, we got a situation,” he says. It doesn’t matter if he starts scolding Peter for getting onto the ship; he’s here now anyway and there’s nothing much he can do about it. What he
“Oh, shit,” Hilde mutters out soundlessly. She lets herself be thrusted forward and grabs on to the unconscious figure of Loki, hovering between the broken pieces of the ship. Quickly, she reaches for his neck, or his wrist. Anything that might indicate that he’s alive.
“I missed you,” he whispers towards the kid.
“Just as I was going to agree with her Wade showed up. I don’t know how, he just did.” Peter can easily figure how Wade appeared in the after-life. “He just started talking to this woman, greeting her as if she was the love of his life. She acted very much the same way.”
“Define lunch or be disintegrated,” the girl jokes. Tony holds up his hand and feels his mouth drop open. Where did she get that thing?
“You’re unbelievable, Steve Rogers,” she gets out. Then she stands up, holding out her hand. “You better not step on my toes.”
“I’m sure they’ll be fine, Steve,” Bucky tries to assure him. Steve chuckles sadly.
“Good,” says Quill.
“If you really wanted another kid, you wouldn’t have done this,” she says, tapping the container that’s attached on his shirt. Tony looks down at the sort-of Arc reactor that isn’t really an arc reactor but just something he’s been working on in the past few days. It’s actually something he’s rather proud of, and he’s planning on perfecting it even more in the future.
After a bit of talking, Tony finally lets go of Peter. They have to follow the plan. They meet eyes for a short moment, sharing a nod of understanding, and then Peter stealthily crawls up the wreckage to his designated hiding place.
Tony doesn’t have the luxury to check on Steve when he’s been thrown aside by Thanos. Surely, the Captain is fine. As are the others. He can start hearing them through his commlink, he quickly realizes. They sound very much alive.
He doesn’t look up when Quill flies over at last. Good, they could use the extra hands.
“A time heist. Of course, why didn’t we think of this before?” Tony looks over at Steve, who has a conflicted expression in his face. Tony hates that he has to be the party pooper here, but he’s never been the optimist. He’s the realist. “Oh, because it’s laughable? Because it’s a pipe dream?”
He’s seen things.
Thanos doesn’t lie. Gamora knows that he will keep his word after getting the stone. He’ll just leave them to die here. And Gamora will be the first to go. Thanos knew exactly where to stab to give her a slow, and painful death. He’s the one who taught her this all.
But then there’s a final blast, this one sounding louder than the other one. But she’s not near a computer, she can’t check if there’s any of the shield left, but she figures there isn’t. Crap, they should have moved sooner.
“Nat,” Steve returns, realizing what she must be experiencing now. When Natasha looks up again, her eyes are red and tears are already forming in the corner of her eyes.
The pair moves forward, except they didn’t expect there to be another woman in the elevator once they manage to get inside. She’s got her hair put up, and is wearing a dark blue dress. Around her neck, she seems to have got some sort of SHIELD-necklace for some reason. Could it be her badge, maybe?
Tony chuckles. “A story? Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed. The end.”
“Thanos did it,” is the last thing she manages to say.
“Uh, I guess,” Tony mumbles, not really wanting to interrupt Steve like that. Whenever he’s on important Bucky-time, Tony just rather stays out of it.
It takes him a while to find Vision in the part of the forest. Bruce is having an internal battle with the Hulk for a moment, but Steve passes him by. It looks like he’s only right on time to find Vision, who is dropped on the ground and looking upwards with a painful glance. The one hovering over him is giving another one of those monologues to make themselves feel better.
Tony is shooting beams towards Thanos, but that doesn’t seem to hold him back at all. Peter sees how the pieces of nanotech are slowly running out from his legs while he puts all his power onto the beams.
At this point, Natasha, Clint, Sam, Okoye and T’Challa have all joined Steve and they’re all forming a barrier in front of the wounded Avenger. That doesn’t make Wanda lower her powerful charge that she keeps prepared.
