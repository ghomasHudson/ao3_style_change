“Gross,” Arto supplies.
“Nee,” she says, popping the coins back into the piggy-bank. “Nee.”
“Tony Dad.”
“Do him standing in front of Clint and Anna,” Arto says. “Dunno. Pizza.”
“Here,” Bucky says, passing Arto the box of cereal. “Eat your breakfast, Short Round.”
“Yeah but they don’t need to look at me.”
“Seconded,” Steve says dryly from where he’s standing by the counter, cup of pumpkin spice latte in one hand and absently digging through a bowl of candy with the other. He doesn’t normally get all excessively caught up in the holidays, but he’s got a weak spot for this stuff and everyone knows it. Bucky waves across at him and Steve obliges, tossing a wrapped candy over to him.
“We are not!”
“Yeah!” Arto says enthusiastically. There’s the noise of him shifting and when he does look up Nick sees that Arto is now kneeling up in the chair, leaning across the table. The Starkphone is still clutched in his hand, and it would be a lie to say that asking to see it hadn’t crossed Nick’s mind, but he’s not going to.
This time it's an obvious struggle for Steve. There’s no more of that instant very awake thing - instead, he groggily sits up against the headboard, rubbing the back of his head and looking tired and lost again. He glances across the bed and as he does his composure cracks slightly.
“Yeah, if you two have been gross, did anyone think about the consequences of that?”
Tony looks to Natasha. “What do you know that we don’t know?”
And then he sits down heavily on the edge of the couch and starts to cry.
Arto opens his mouth, shuts it again. His eyes feel hot with humiliation and confusion. He’s scared.
“Never again,” Bucky says as he unwraps the candy and pops it in his mouth, screwing up the wrapper and flicking it back at Steve. “I was washing off green paint for weeks.”
Avenger life calls, and Steve and Bucky are both called away to deal with some sort of AIM related mess on the West Coast. Tony is left in charge, and so makes the call to take Arto out for lunch on the second day of his grounding, though doesn’t technically undermine Steve because he says that Peter is definitely not allowed to come. Normally, Arto is in a phase of not wanting to go anywhere without Peter or Omari with him, but he seems to realize that this is either a compromise, or a get-out-of-jail free card, so he takes it. They go to Arto’s favorite place, and Tony lets him order three platters of pancakes.
“Will you come back for me?” Arto says, winding his arms around Steve’s neck. "At hometime?"
The words are barely out of his mouth before Arto springs to his feet with an unholy shriek, throwing his hands in the air. Clint throws himself backwards with a yell, and lands on his back on the couch. Laughing uncontrollably, Arto scrambles up onto the couch and sits on his chest.
“Snowing. Cold. We’re going exploring today.”
Arto nods and Tony slides his palms over Arto’s ears before turning to Steve. “I’ve ordered dinner, Pepper is staying a few days, she’s agreed to not tell the board anything, she still thinks I’m only doing this for you, I may have told her to go fuck herself, she is majorly concerned that I am not cut out for raising a child.”
Arto points at the pool. “I live here now,” he says. “Get me a hose. I’m filling it up right now.”
He turns down the music, looks straight out the front, staring at the brakelights of the Prius in front of them. “What did Tony do?”
“Everyone is scared on their first day.”
“Dunno,” he says. Anna bats away the proffered piece of toast and then lets out another unholy shriek as Bucky wanders in, coat still on and cheeks pink from the cold.
Steve isn't entirely sure where the new obsession has come from, but he doesn't mind. He can take another few weeks of Cinderella if it means he doesn't have to watch Finding Nemo again in the foreseeable future. He's got a copy of Jurassic Park on standby for when it does get too much; he's pretty sure that'll be a hit.
Arto nods, and Tony offers him a tentative smile. “I love you, Smart Art. You know that, right?”
“I needed you,” Arto says, voice cracking. “And you were too busy.”
“Okay, okay. You know we said about making a fresh start?” Tony says. “Well I figured-”
He knows he’s probably coming across as moody and sullen but no-one seems to mind, not even when he puts his headphones on for the cab journey to the airport. He’s still feeling all twisted up about Tony and the stupid nanites thing and blocking out the rest of the world kind of helps.
“You’re no fun,” Arto says, brushing snow from him gloves.
Bucky comes to stand by his shoulder. “The jacket? No. The scarf. It’s the scarf, isn’t it.”
“Peace offering,” Steve says quietly, when he notices Arto staring at the milkshake. “I’m sorry I was an ass.”
Arto bursts into tears. His hands fly up to cover his face, even more humiliated than before. He hears footsteps and the click and thud of the passenger door, and then he’s turning to bury his face in Clint’s chest, letting strong arms fold around him.
“Alright,” Steve laughs, and gets up to give Bucky a hug. Arto’s second in line, elbowing Steve out the way so he can throw himself at Bucky.
Tony nods. “Yeah, and you were going through your Cinderella phase. But didn’t Natasha talk to you about gender identity then?”
“DAD!”
“STEVE STEVE STEVE STEVE!”
“Whatever,” he snaps, dropping his hands and walking away. Ostentatious, really? Couldn’t Tony have just called then cute or something, not insulted him by saying his nails were
“So, how’s Chicago?”
Steve looks up over at Tony who just shrugs. With that astoundingly helpful response, Steve opts for capitulating, letting Arto pull him around the car to the other side, climbing in and belting up. He waits, on tenterhooks, and then Arto appears back around the other side, clambering into his booster seat.
“I love you,” Arto says quickly, and jumps at Steve for a hug.
“That’s why you need Steve,” Arto says. “He’s good at planning.”
“I’m texting other people, actually,” Arto says. “Put the hockey back on!”
weird,” Arto replies, with all the withering indignation that a sixteen year old can muster. “You can’t call anyone weird.”
Arto is not, but he nods.
“What is he doing here?” Arto asks, throat feeling all tight and painful.
“Yeah we’ll be fine. Natasha is gonna pick us up at the other end,” Clint says. He’s patting his hands over his pockets, checking them all twice before finding his boarding pass in the first pocket that he’d checked. He clamps it between his lips as he starts another pat-down for something else. “Ar, oo anna ay oogaye?” he tries, before Steve reaches over to take the pass for him. He nods in thanks, tries again. “Art, you wanna say goodbye? We better get moving. I need time to lose and find my boarding pass five times over before we leave.”
Arto whips his head around to glare at Clint, but his murder-eye stare is blocked by Steve who is standing right in front of him with his arms folded across his chest. He still looks tired but at least he doesn't look like he’s been crying anymore.
Now, Steve likes to play dumb when it comes to social media because it infuriates Tony no end, but Arto knows that Steve’s perfectly capable of navigating not only a twitter feed but Bucky’s actual Instagram. “What would go on this Instagram?” Steve asks, tone carefully neutral.
Now Arto knows full well that Tony goes to bed in the spare room, but the next morning when Arto knocks and walks in, the bed is empty. He narrows his eyes as his brain starts putting two and two together, backtracking out of the room and down the corridor to Steve’s. Yep, there he is, sleeping next to Steve with his arms and limbs sprawled out like a starfish. Steve's on his side, mouth hanging open and one hand resting inbetween Tony's shoulder-blades. Arto stares for a moment and then decides that yeah, he’s cool with it.
There’s the faintest hum from the Tesla as Steve accelerates just that little bit more. “Good point,” he says grimly. “Get your phone. Call Natasha.”
They start bickering again. The cab driver does an admirable job of ignoring them, keeping his eyes on the road. Arto’s a little nonplussed by the whole thing if he’s honest. Though he is kinda glad that they’re laughing at each other again. It goes a long way to making things feel almost normal.
“Yeah,” Peter says, coming over to sling an arm around his neck. From his other side, Omari reaches out to pat his hip consolingly. “It’s not like all bad though, right?”
“Yeah, Dada is over there,” he says. “Dada and Dad and Steve.”
Arto still feels a little blindsided. “I just woke up.”
Arto smiles and shuffles further into his spot, splaying his hand over the arc reactor. Steve heaves out a sigh behind him, and Tony reaches over to settle his hand on Steve’s thigh.
Bucky catches up with him as he’s skulking around in a selection of navy-colored, hooded sweatshirts, pulling at the drawstrings in the collars. Bucky sighs. “You have plenty of sweatshirts. I know this, because you steal mine.”
Steve looks thoughtful. “Well. You bought them. So technically they’re your shoes.”
Arto scowls. He walks his fingers up over Tony’s arm, dancing around the edge of a soldering burn. “I’m going to school,” he insists.
“So the first thing you need to know that the age of consent in New York is seventeen,” Tony says. “That means that seeing as you are under that age, anyone sleeping with you could be prosecuted.”
“You’re suing us?”
option.”
“Membership with the Young Avengers and my own Audi R8.”
“I will, I’ll be careful,” Arto insists, pressing the elevator button again. “Hey, Steve?”
“Whoa,” Sam says in shock, leaning away from him and fixing him with an unimpressed stare. “Where’s the attitude coming from?”
“Are you a person who likes getting their nails done?”
“Steve Dad?”
“Not helpful, Hawkeye,” Tony sighs, pressing his mouth to Arto’s hair. “I’m sorry Art, I didn’t realise they had to be Lucky Charms charms.”
Steve laughs and extricates himself from Arto's arms, handing over his lunchbox. "Okay, okay," he says. "Go on then, Omari's waiting for you."
After an hour, Tony still hasn’t reappeared. Steve quite pointedly doesn't ask Jarvis for any updates, because Pepper and Stark Industries is Tony’s business, and even though earlier he’d wanted to go and defend Tony, he knows that Tony can handle himself, and should probably be left to do so. He’s never once wanted Steve involved with his work outside of the Avengers, and Steve has never been interested in it. He only knows that Tony plays a big part in R&D, still owns enough shares to technically own the company, and drives Pepper up the wall on a regular basis even though his actual contact with the company is limited now he’s a full time Avenger.
“Divorce lawyers?” Arto says, his voice sounding strangled. He looks at Steve, who is very pale.
and Tony snapping back at him.
“I’m ready.”
“I know you’re trying to do the right thing here,” Tony finally says. “But you cannot jump in here without knowing the full story. You’re getting it all backwards. I promise you, I would not be spending this much time in here if it wasn’t super important-”
He shakes his head. He’s not thinking about that, not ever. He’s got enough crap to deal with. Besides, he got rescued and that’s the end of it. He doesn’t need to think about it.
“Hey, Potts!”
Steve’s internal monologue supplies. Because he loves Arto with all his heart but can easily admit that Arto is pretty used to getting his own way, and this sounds like an impending disaster. He can all too easily imagine the tantrums that will come if Arto doesn’t win his beloved box of Lucky Charms; Tony offering to buy out General Mills to get a box for Arto; the press catching wind and then the headlines about Arto being the most spoiled child on the planet; the board chewing Tony out for making reckless business calls based on his family life; the arguments Steve and Tony will have about letting Arto get what he wants.
“I feel like I’m - I’m letting him down when I back off,” Steve admits.
“No!” Arto protests, and jabs at the dice with a look of utter concentration on his face. Steve half-heartedly spares a thought to hope Arto wins, because he doesn't want to have to deal with the tantrum he suspects will come if Arto loses this game after losing at MarioKart earlier.
Clint gives him one last hug - still with coffee mugs in both hands- and heads back to Anna and Bucky. Arto watches him go and then switches off the light before padding along to the master bedroom. He pushes the door open and jumps onto the bed, making Steve jerk away and groan sleepily.
“Yeah, I can climb and my reflexes are super fast and I’m stronger. I learned how to make webs out of-”
He swallows hard. Starts to type
“Maybe I misjudged,” he says. “The kid grows on you.”
“Stop yelling!” he yells at them both. “Please,
Arto sulks for days. It’s worse than the thing with the cat. Way worse. He even refuses to eat his regular Lucky charms, eyeing the box with hurt betrayal, eyes full of tears. While Tony is talked out of buying General Mills, he does order Arto a bag of cereal marshmallows. It doesn’t have the intended effect; Arto throws them on the floor and howls that they’re
Tony reappears just before the two hour mark. Steve hears the elevator doors slide open and Tony steps out, arm in arm with Pepper.
He doesn't want to think about it. What he wants to do is sit with his dad and just watch some quasi-accurate, roman ass-kicking. So he curls up on the couch and shoves all the pillows aside so there’s space for Tony. He gets the hint and drops into the space; the easy familiarity of his makes tears prickle in his eyes. This is all he’s wanted for months, just for Tony to be here with him like he used to be. He turns into Tony’s side, resting his head on his chest and tapping his fingers against the edge of the arc reactor.
Tony gives her a
Arto doesn’t say anything and Steve gives him a gentle shake. “Hey, that’s you, Master Rogers. Tulio is talking to you.”
“Stop jumping from things, we’ve been over this,” he says. “What did you do with Steve? Is he still - oh for god’s sake.” Tony spots Steve through the window, and promptly walks over to the glass partition. “Art, bang on the window. Don’t break it, just be noisy and annoying.”
“But,” Arto begins, but then shakes his head. He can’t say ‘
"I do not drive really fast," Steve protests.
“What shit?”
Arto starts to feel sick.
“No, he’s dumb and - ow - and should have trusted me to not tell my dads!”
asleep?”
“He probably wanted to tell you that he cared but you didn’t pick up the phone,” Steve repeats. “When you get a bit older...your best friends aren’t always the ones who are there constantly. They can be the ones who you don’t speak to all the time. It doesn’t make them any less your friend.”
“Yeah you do,” Steve says. “At least talk to her about the nightmares even if you don’t want to talk about anything else.”
Steve shrugs. “We started sleeping together.”
Steve grits his teeth. He exhales so heavily that his nostrils flare. “No. I’m not fighting. Tony. Please kindly explain what the hell is going on.”
“Cross my heart,” Steve says, then his attention goes back to his phone as it beeps. God, Arto would bet that he's texting Bucky right now. Steve must kind of read his mind, because the next thing he says it, “And besides, I have other friends. Not just Bucky.”
“Um, in an empty conference suite at the venue. It’s cool. It’s my gala, I can skip as much as I like.”
“So, what was that about?” Tony asks.
“You get in the car,” Arto replies stubbornly. “Then future Arto will be thinking about getting in the car.”
we left.”
Natasha opens her eyes, smiles at him. “You’re starting to get it. It’s more complicated than that, but you’re doing great.”
“I dunno,” Clint chips in, kneeling down to scoop up the offending marshmallows. He pops one into his mouth. “He’s pretty unhealthily attached to Lucky Charms.”
“Tempting,” Steve says, but he twists around and flops onto the couch with them, laying his arm along the back. He wriggles sideways so his hip is pressed to Arto’s back, kicking his feet up onto the coffee table.
“No, they’re from the women’s section,” Arto says. “But I don’t care, I like them.”
“Gross,” he says loudly. Steve jumps back from Tony like he’s been electrocuted, face going red.
Knowing that he’s going to be in the chair soon, he finds himself utterly entranced by what the woman is doing. He tries to keep out of her way but before long he’s asking probably way too many questions, learning more about gel-polishes and acrylic overlays than he thought was possible. Natasha endures it with a small smile on her face, even though this is probably her me-time for relaxing or whatever. Arto barely cares; he’s too excited.
“What’s happened?” Steve asks calmly, but Arto shakes his head, cheek pressing against Steve’s shoulder. “You need to tell me,” Steve presses gently. “It’s obviously something, Art.”
“Possibly,” Arto says. “How’s school?”
“Fine,” Arto whines, dragging the word out into epic proportions. “But quick, you have to see, Steve you have to see, there’s a thing and I want to win and-”
“So I read some more stuff in the books and on the internet,” he says as Steve sips at his coffee. He looks better already, more alert and less miserable.
A soft knock on his door makes him look up. It’s Steve, smiling tiredly.
“TOW!”
There’s a pause. “A little?”
“One of the Young Avengers,” Clint blurts out, flapping a hand in Tony and Steve’s direction. “That’s why he keeps trying to come and watch training!”
Steve hums at that. “Alright. Shall we go peel me out of this suit instead?”
The kid grins, looking very pleased with himself. Nick’s brows go up, and he’s never going to admit it to Stark, but he’s unwillingly amused by the parrot act. It’s like Stark’s voice coming from a small Steve Rogers, which admittedly happens with the taller Rogers more than he’s completely comfortable with.
“But you don’t need to go right away.”
“It looks like you already moved us!” Steve yells. A pair of workmen who were trying to get out the door past Tony freeze, slowly turn around and head back inside.
“Coming to speak to you,” Steve sighs. “But instead of catching a flight and using the elevator like a normal person.” He gestures to the armour that’s still hovering outside the window.
It’s only around twenty minutes later when Steve comes to find them. He knocks softly and then edges into the room, trying to look all normal and shit. He misses by like a mile, because his face is all pink and blotchy and it’s
Omari texts him back immediately with a string of exclamation points. To his surprise, Nat also texts back almost immediately, saying ‘
No time for Arto, it feels like.
The Tesla makes quick work of getting out of Chicago, and soon enough they’re on the interstate, tearing through Indiana. They chat about how much they're looking forwards to being in New York again, about potential sports he could try with Bucky, about the holiday that he’d all but forgotten about.
“Told you,” Arto crows. “He’s a girl.”
His sides now hurt from laughing. Arto collapses sideways across Steve’s lap, hands over his face as he laughs and laughs. It’s probably reaching a little hysterical but he doesn’t care.
Steve sends Arto a reproachful look. “See, you were being cross, and that means you’re not thinking about-”
"You know what, this is boring, so predictable, I don't have time for you and your self-righteous face, this is nothing to do with you-"
tone of voice. “I just want to make it clear - Arto, did you punch this man?”
“Sneaky.”
He drops his fork, abruptly wanting nothing more than to go lock himself in his room with incognito mode on his phone and Jarvis banned from recording. And then has a moment to despair because a moment ago he was thinking about poptarts and now he’s thinking about sex and he’s got no idea how or why he’s gone from a to b. God, if he could just kill his own body for the way it’s behaving right now he would. Kill it and donate it to medical science - actually, scratch that, scientists suck dick unless they’re Bruce.
Steve stares at Arto for a moment, and then he reaches out to pat Tony on the shoulder. “Tag, you’re it,” he says, hastily stepping backwards. “I’m going back to bed.”
It takes him a while to find Steve; he’d assumed that Steve would be taking the bike but of course that makes no sense seeing as they both have bags. He peers into the new Audi and the Bugatti with no luck and eventually finds Steve sitting in the driver’s seat of his Tesla, thumbing away at something on his phone. The lid of the front trunk is already open so Arto just throws his case in, hits the close button and then climbs into the passenger seat.
“All in due time, Short Round,” Clint says, and tips over backwards so he’s lying on Arto’s bed, holding the baby monitor to his chest. Bucky twists around to look at him and then seems to decide that Arto’s bed is good enough for him too; he shuffles around and lies on his side with his head pillowed on Clint’s stomach. Arto considers telling him to get his mostly naked butt off of his bed, but Bucky’s looking a bit weird and tired and sad so he doesn’t.
“Dad!” Arto protests, pushing ineffectually against Steve’s chest. “Get off!”
“That’s what Tony says,” Arto says, starting at the book. Then he realises what he’s said and winces. “Sorry?”
They pull up at the school, Bucky slowing the car to a crawl as they head up the drive. Steve’s phone buzzes with a text from Clint that simply says
“And on that note,” Tony says, thumping his hand against the roof of the car and earning a dirty glare from Bucky. “Have fun, boys. Learn things. Behave.”
Arto grins at him, bright and happy. “Clint can be the pumpkin!” he enthuses. “It doesn’t matter if a pumpkin is a boy or a girl!”
And Steve is nodding slowly behind his hand. He swallows again and then drops his hand, trying to discreetly wipe away his tears as he does. It doesn't work; Arto knows he’s crying.
“Give me like a minute baby girl,” Steve laughs. He tosses his coat aside and scoops her up again, tossing her in the air. Bucky makes a pained sound but Steve catches her as easily as he ever does, grinning at her and brushing his nose against her cheek.
Arto pushes at Steve's eyebrows, trying to get him to open his eyes. “Wake up. Again. I need to tell you something.”
Anna reaches for him and he sighs and pulls her in. She babbles in delight, grabbing hold of his hair with chubby fists and pressing her mouth to his chin. “Yeah, okay,” Tony says, and hitches her up, a smile hitching the corner of his mouth. “Kisses, I gottit. Thanks.”
Arto heads for the fridge, yanking it open and gazing into it without even looking. He remembers being in the nail bar, that sensation catching inside him, that roll of excitement and happiness that had snagged hard. He can’t shake it free, it’s like he’s caught on something and he doesn’t want to have to give it up. At the same time, he kind of wishes it would go away, because it’s making him feel hot and shamed and like he needs to crawl away and hide.
Steve lets out a laugh at that. “Oh, okay. That’s how it is.”
Thankfully, it stops ringing and goes dark, simply telling him he has a missed call from Tony.
“Were you born with one eye?”
“Tell me about it,” says Peter forlornly.
“I’m okay,” Arto says. “No-one even looked twice at me.”
“But you want to keep him safe, right?”
“No,” Tony says too quickly. “He just objected to me being locked in the workshop and he wasn't all that polite about it, you know how he gets-”
to get off of his phone. Something feels slightly backwards here.
Steve nods against his shoulder. “Me too.”
“We’re renaming her,” Bucky says. “I’m voting for-”
“I want to know!”
He steps forwards so Arto has no choice but to step back, away from the screens and benches. He’s confused at the amount of medical equipment that Tony’s got on his benches; in the place of the usual soldering irons and circuit boards are scalpels and syringes.
“I promise I’ll tell you if I want to go back, but I don’t, so stop it,” Arto says forcefully. He wishes he had his own sunglasses so he could hide behind them. He settles for turning the music up, loud enough so that Steve would have to shout if he wanted to be heard.
“You don’t need my permission for that,” Steve says. “He’s your dad.”
He considers ignoring it but remembers what Omari said before. And anyway he misses Peter so much it hurts. So much that he’s already cancelling his plan to stay in Chicago forever.
Clint squints at Bucky from where he’s sitting on the floor with his crossed legs tucked under a thick afghan which includes more shades of purple than Steve knew existed. Arto is behind him, crouched back on his heels and carefully massaging heart shapes into Clint’s back. He's concentrating on what he's doing, which is only really happening because the film he'd been adamantly watching for the second time that morning has been paused. He'd looked at Steve with utter betrayal when he'd taken the remote from him, and then turned the look on the ceiling when Jarvis had apologetically told him that he wasn't going to restart the film until he'd completed massage-time.
“Good point,” Clint grins. “You get hold of Parker? He allowed to go with you?”
But then he remembers the way Tony’s eyes slid past him into the workshop and it stiffens his resolve.
“So what? So have I,” Tony replies.
“You did!” Arto yelled at him. “He hit her on the fucking head and he left a mark! Nat got it all on film, even when I punched him but I don’t care, I’ll go to jail for it but so will he because he hit a baby!”
“And you are you and I don’t care,” Steve says firmly. “Yes, you’ve got flaws but we all do. Hell, that temper you probably inherited from me anyway.” His voice is suspiciously thick but he’s laughing, and Arto is huffing out a sound somewhere between a sob and a laugh too.
“Well you didn’t pick up the phone,” Steve says, thumbs tapping away again. Arto peers over but Steve angles the screen so he can’t see. “Should he be expected to keep trying?”
“Hi! Anna, hi,” Arto says, waving at her. She brandishes the toy back at him, beaming.
“He means, remember the days when you were scared of the baby and treated her like she was made of glass?” Clint calls. “He misses those days.”
“Steve?”
“He wants to,” Clint says. “He’s fine, he’s been away from her on missions before. And besides, we leave you two unattended and you’ll end up slobbing around all day feeling sorry for yourselves.”
By the time they get home, they’ve been rumbled. Arto only knows this because when he and Natasha get off the elevator on the communal floor, Tony turns and holds up his phone, waving a picture of them leaving the nail salon.
Omari laughs. “You can’t keep taking Bucky’s clothes!”
Natasha is first on her feet, walking over to say hello. Pepper smiles warmly at her, and Tony slips his arm free as they catch up. He heads straight over to Steve, dropping onto the couch next to him and Arto, looking furtively over his shoulder to check that Pepper is still occupied.
Steve carries him over to the others, sliding back onto his seat and setting Arto on his knee. Tony slides over Arto’s tablet, some sort of interactive snakes and ladders game already open. Arto leans forwards without a protest or hesitation, tapping his finger on the interactive dice and watching raptly as it rolls across the screen.
“They’ll go well with your black jeans,” Omari says. “You know the ones with the rip in the knee?”
Steve rubs his eyes. Ugh, they feel so gritty and awful. “Well that’s why I’m sending you.”
Which in turn means by the time he gets down to the kitchen, hunger levels are critical and he doesn’t hesitate to barge past Sam, Bruce and Clint to get to food.
“Weird, how?”
“Come with me,” Arto insists, tugging on Steve’s hand with both of his own, still making no move towards the car. The door is open. Bucky bear is already inside. His lunchbox is also inside, and filled with the sort of snacks he normally has rationed. Clint is in the passenger seat, twisted around and watching patiently through the open back door.
“No, I’m okay,” Arto says, settling down on the side of the bed that would normally be Tony’s. “I’m staying here.”
“Probably is,” Bucky says, going round to scoop Anna up. “Let’s confirm.”
Steve sighs. “I didn’t do too well with this one, huh?”
,” Arto huffs, cuts himself off because he knows what Steve will say in response to that. “Bucky. How did he know?”
“It'll be
Clint’s voice is easily audible over the noise in the rest of the room, and Steve watches, torn between amusement and despair as Clint walks up and down the length of the couch, feet sinking into the soft cushions. Natasha has long since gone back to her book, sitting in the corner of the couch, and doesn’t even bat an eyelid as Clint steps over her on his journey. Clint is wearing a towel around his shoulders like a cape, and is peering around the room suspiciously. Arto is curled up on the floor at the far end of the couch, knees and arms tucked in underneath him and giggling madly.
To his surprise, Steve smiles. “If you’re brave enough to show your whole-” he waves his hand, gesturing to Arto in some vague encompassing gesture, “-journey, then I think we should seriously consider it.”
“I want to listen,” Arto says, even as the three of them are tumbling into his room, Bucky shutting the door firmly behind them. “What did Tony
“Yeah,” Arto says. “Yeah.”
“You’re so smart,” Arto tells her and she beams at him. She quickly glances at where Steve, Bucky and Clint are still chatting, lowering his voice to a whisper. “You’re never gonna be on your own, ever,” he tells Anna. “We rescued you just in time.”
Arto’s face falls at that. “He can’t fix it, though, can he?” he says quietly, like that’s only just occurred to him.
Next to Arto, Steve snorts with laughter. Bruce makes some comment about the mechanics of Bucky’s arm withstanding mashed potato. Tony chips in with a joke that has Clint laughing. Arto’s attention slides away, back to where his phone is on his knee, hidden by the edge of the counter. He’s not supposed to have it while they’re eating but he needs to see if Peter has text him back yet-
Arto snatches the box from Bucky and tears into it. The unholy shriek he makes when he looks into it makes the hours of rifling through cereal worth it.
“Bucky has a denim jacket somewhere.”
Bucky grins, reaches out to steer him back towards the house. “I’ll take that bet.”
He wants to tell Peter everything. Wants to call him and admit every last little thing that’s been bothering him in the past few weeks but he doesn’t. He stares at the text from Peter, wondering if he’s out of order for being angry that Peter hasn’t even acknowledged that he’s been a shitty friend. He can’t just jump back into the picture after weeks of nothing and expect Arto to just act normal.
way, but in a
Arto nods vigorously. “I like having my own space. Can we get a buzzer on the door at the end of the corridor?”
“No,” Arto says. “No, don’t tell anyone.”
“Whoa, where’s the fire?”
“Yeah,” he says, his smile getting stronger. He drops his voice to a fake whisper, makes a show of looking over his shoulder before turning to Arto with a wink. “Just don’t tell Bucky.”
“I hate Bucky.”
“Asshole!” Bucky is the first to recover. He’s got a hand inside his backpack, probably holding onto a knife or ten, like he thinks if Arto can’t see them he’ll be stupid enough to assume that Bucky’s not armed.
“No weapons Buck, it’s a school.”
“Why are you forgiving him then?”
“Not,” Arto replies tearfully, and reaches up to rub at his eye with a small fist. “I want to play.”
It's not just Arto having a really shitty time right now.
Steve doesn’t reply to that. He just holds him close and waits him out, solid and unwavering.
She lifts an eyebrow. “Sounds like your problem, not mine.”
“Holy shit, we can’t live here!” Arto gasps.
Arto groans, feeling embarrassment flush up over his face. “Nat, you said you wouldn’t.”
’ he signals through the window. Fury nods, because if Rogers is talking to the WSC then they won’t be on his ass about the Avengers keeping them out of the loop again. Already onto plan B, Fury points at Barnes. Barnes looks surprised, shaking his head and cupping a metal hand around his ear.
Arto shakes his head, so Steve hedges his bets and simply bends down to pick him up. Arto goes without a protest, leaning tiredly against Steve’s shoulder for a moment before pushing back, blinking and looking around.
Arto drops the phone.
“But he-”
“Bullshit,” Bucky’s voice says, and Arto aims a kick towards where the voice came from.
“Yep,” Arto says. “Hey, can I borrow your phone? I want to call Clint.”
Tony sighs again, strokes a hand over Arto’s head. “I want to,” he says. “It’s a project that could revolutionise modern medicine. But...I’m not going to be using myself as a test subject. I’m not going to put you guys in the position where you have to worry about me.”
“Natasha,” Steve says. “She’s one of my best friends in the world and I don’t speak to her every day. I can go weeks without talking to her, when she’s away on mission. Or when she’s just off doing her own thing.”
Now that’s terrifying. The thought of actually doing it. But maybe terrifying in a good, exciting way. “Can we...look?”
“Hey, Short Round,” Bucky says. He shifts around, sets the phone down his end and Arto’s heart does a happy little jump as he sees Bucky has got Anna on his hip. She doesn’t have her pink bow on this morning, which he’s ridiculously relieved about. “He’s on duty with the Young Avengers, you okay?”
“Clint’s turned into a girl.”
“Sir, Ms Potts is entering the tower,” Jarvis interrupts, and Tony groans, bypassing Steve’s mouth and slumping forwards to bury his face in his shoulder.
“Yeah, Barnes,” Steve says with a grin.
“Anna has decided that sleeping is for suckers,” Bucky says, the last word punctuated with a vicious punch. “And her crying makes me want to cry, so here I am.”
“I’m not skulking,” he glares, leaning on the edge of the boxing ring.
Tony looks at him, nonplussed. “Steve, I think he knows we kiss sometimes.”
“They would never get divorced,” Arto says. “Right?”
“Yeah?”
“Hi, hi,” Clint says, shoving Kamala in. “I’m sorry, they need feeding before we do anymore, they’re unbearable when they need food. Smol Avengers, you know Tony and Steve, and that over there is Arto.”
!” Steve shouts, loud and sudden enough to make Arto jump out of his skin, dropping his phone into the footwell. Steve glares at him. “Pepper, don’t answer that!”
Tony is already out of the office, waving cheerfully at Barnes who waves him off vaguely, off the call but busy doing something with a holoscreen in the other room. Steve tries to stop Arto from dashing after Tony but the kid is damn quick and evades him pretty easily. Steve sighs and collects the shoes, before pausing on his way out.
“I thought Peter was my Bucky friend,” Arto says, voice small. The woman doing his nails taps at his hand and he trades her for his other one, distracted.
The night before Arto’s second day at school, a full week after the first, Steve is woken at 4am by a smaller version of himself wriggling into his bed, kneeing him in the thighs and hitting him in the chin with a teddy bear. Steve groans, wondering if it would make him a bad parent if he simply pushed Arto back out again.
“That’s like ten hours.”
“No,” Tony says. “You are definitely Captain Overprotective, but Buckaroo here is in a league of his own.”
“It’d be nice to know he cared.”
“The hell I can’t,” Steve says. “He’s my son, I can fix this.”
“I’m sorry about the door,” Arto manages to say through his tears.
Arto shuts his mouth and turns his face away from Steve, furious and embarrassed and close to tears. He turns the music back up and stares out of the window at the darkening sky.
“No.”
Arto shakes his head. “Too cold.”
Arto grins and then abruptly turns and slides off of Steve’s knee. “Toilet,” he says to Steve, and then passes Bucky bear to him before darting away.
“It’s pretty cool,” Clint says and whoa, his voice is still deep but it’s not male deep anymore, it’s different. “Thor says it’s not permanent. Though he’s pretty pissy with me for touching the magicky thingy he possibly told me not to touch. But on the plus side, I’ve got an awesome rack.”
So Arto does the only thing that makes sense, and runs away.
Arto doesn't know what to say to that, so he just looks at his knees and fiddles with the corner of his pillow. “It…was good,” he finally says. “I get so angry sometimes and there was so much going on and it just…”
“We’re friends,” Arto tells Tony. He reaches out for Steve and Steve steps forwards automatically, taking him from Tony and hitching him up. Damn. They look so alike it’s frightening.
Steve slowly shakes his head. He swallows hard enough so that Arto can see his Adam’s apple bobbing.
“Okay. We can do that,” Tony says, sounding relieved.
“They’re looking at me,” Arto defends.
“It was a crush, and it was stupid and I’m over it,” Arto says forcefully, thinking back to the days of liking-Kate, trying to sneak glances of the Young Avengers in training and feeling his belly swoop every time she swung her glossy hair over her shoulder. “I don’t even like her anymore.”
“You want me to go, kid?” Sam asks. Arto think for a moment and then shakes his head. Sam’s pretty great at talking about feelings and he’s also really good at stopping Steve going off on one. He’s a guy that Arto would like to have in his corner.
“Well I’m bored of paperwork too,” she says, pulling her apartment door closed. “Let’s go. Get your coat.”
Arto thinks about it. Whether it’s truly a need or not. “I want to?”
Natasha doesn’t look at him but she almost-smiles at the admission. “We’ll get yours done after then,” she says simply.
“I am King Hawkeye of the Southern Realm, and I will not be defeated! Not by anyone, and certainly not by small blond children!”
When they’ve calmed down enough, they chat for a little longer about school, about Arto’s new shoes, about the plans for the Manhattan Island Marathon swim. They don’t talk about the not-talking, or any of the other big issues, but Arto doesn’t care. He’s got Peter talking to him like everything’s normal, and that’s enough.
“Well I am,” Arto says, and he looks at his phone and flips to Tony’s number. “I want to talk to him.”
He doesn’t win.
Clint’s sanity is a conversation for another time, Arto decides. “Bucky’s like. Not…”
Oh my god. Spiders and mansions and dismantling the gender construct. Life is going to be so different now.”
He uses his tablet app to check where everyone is and finds himself skulking into the gym. Well, he would say he walks in like a normal person but the moment he steps past the threshold Bucky calls “why are you skulking around?”, so maybe he missed the mark.
“Him ignoring you for weeks is a dick move,” Steve agrees, glancing up from his phone. “But I think you’re in the wrong if you’re sitting there expecting him to expend loads of time and energy into grovelling.”
Steve nods. “Not going anywhere,” he says, and Arto lets himself fall back into sleep.
“Like four days. Since just after New Year.”
“Get him yourself,” Steve says half-heartedly, reaching out and snagging Arto’s ankle. “You’re gonna be late if you don’t pick a car.”
The only person who manages to sleep the night before Arto’s first day at school is Steve. Not because he’s relaxed about the whole affair; more because he’s not slept for the whole week running up to the big day, so Tony hits him with what’s technically enough Ambien to kill a regular human and knocks him out for a few hours.
Steve pulls a face. “Okay, no. Nearly anything you want.”
Arto giggles, and Tony snorts with laughter too. “I’ll thank you for it,” he says, and Steve elbows him as Arto cackles with laughter.
but he can’t bring himself to do it. Yeah, Tony is working a lot these days and he sometimes forgets about things, but he’s never really let Arto down. He stares at the floor and shakes his head jerkily.
“What can I do? ” Tony says. “Tell me what I can do from here and I’ll do it. Anything, everything. Money or time no object.”
Arto’s not surprised at Tony’s lack of tact so he’s not bothered by it. He does look up at Steve though, meets questioning blue eyes across the table. Unfortunately he’s not telepathic so he and Steve have got no way of deciding what to do without the others butting in.
he tells himself more forcefully, clenching his fists so he can’t see his nails.
He does call Julia too. It’s awkward and stilted until he just snaps and starts blurting out everything he’s feeling about Tony and Peter and Steve and his own identity. Julia endures it pretty patiently, even when he’s crying and not making much sense. He does feel better once it’s all out there, and he even agrees to schedule an appointment to go see her when he’s home.
It feels like jumping down a flight of stairs.
“I’m glad you changed your mind about him,” Steve says, and then he’s gone. Nick waits for his footsteps to fade and the door to swish shut before he allows himself to snort with laughter, getting up and walking around to slump back in his own chair.
They’re about halfway across New Jersey when he thinks to text Omari. He opens up Whatsapp, ignores the Peter conversation, types ‘
Even when the tears finally stop, Arto doesn’t move. He just slumps down so he’s lying on his side with his shoulder between Clint’s legs, his head pillowed on his thigh. Clint has one hand on his shoulder and the other is stroking over his hair, slow and repetitive.
The snow is coming down pretty heavily by the time the cab pulls up at the block in which the penthouse sits. Arto nails Steve with a snowball right between his shoulders, but Steve doesn’t retaliate, just ushers him inside.
“You’re gross,” Arto points out. “Stop saying that word.”
“What is the river?”
Note - this features Clint being physically altered by way of magic. In this chapter it's referred to as Clint being turned from a boy to a girl. Some people explained to me that this was erring on the side of problematic, and the language wasn't fully inclusive or understanding of transgender people. So the help of some gorgeous people and feedback, the next chapter goes onto explore and challenge the perceptions and terminology used. So bear with me - the characters learn as I did! Thank you.
“Buh!” Anna says, turning the pages of the book in big handfuls. “Buh!”
Steve’s heart feels like it’s about to double in size, and he presses his lips together hard, smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. “Sure you can.”
Steve ignored him, though did lay a hand on Arto’s shoulder, mostly to stop Arto launching himself at the man for round two. “Arto, why did you punch him?”
“Gimme.”
“Nu-uh,” Arto says, voice muffled. “I’d rather ask Bucky.”
“Yep,” Arto shrugs, frowning as Bucky marches out of the room. Arto goes to say hello to Anna, who is busy staring at some cartoon on the TV, standing around three feet away from it and occasionally bobbing frantically up and down when the cat character appears. Clint is manning breakfast, multitasking with frying bacon and cutting up fruit.
“If he wants, yes,” Natasha says. “If you’re ever watching the news or listening to people talk and you hear the word transgender, that’s what it’s about. People who aren’t just boy or girl. They might look like one in their bodies, but feel different inside.”
A strange thrill goes through Arto at that, a response to the implication in Bucky’s words. “Shopping for me?”
Bucky laughs. “Go tell Tony you like it,” he says. “Get him to give you the tour. The pool is like the eighth coolest thing about this place, I swear.”
Arto gets his own way about the TV that night; instead of watching any dumb galas or celebrity gossip he puts on Gladiator. He’s possibly seem the film eight hundred times but it’s a classic.
“Go for it,” Bucky says quietly.
“And?”
That makes Steve’s mouth drop open and his eyes go all shiny. Shit, shit, shit. Tony’s been gone for half a day and Arto’s broken Steve somehow and should he call home? Tony or Bucky, who’s going to be better right now-?
“New year, new me,” Steve grunts at him and rolls back over.
; Arto feels it right in his very core. He looks around at the salon, at the smiling and relaxed women, feeling the hook pull tighter. Could he? But - he’s never been embarrassed about wearing nail varnish, it’s just a habit he’s had since he was like seven, and no-one at school dares say anything to him about it because a) his dads are Captain America and Iron Man and b) Arto could knock them the fuck out himself if he were so inclined. He wouldn’t, because Steve would hate it if he did and probably never talk to him ever again, but Arto and the bullies know he could, and that’s enough for now.
Tony is so obviously bored with the world of art within a grand total of ten minutes into the visit. He keeps walking around in circles; he moves on quicker than Steve and Arto then loops back when he’s figured out they’re not right behind him. They wander at a decidedly more leisurely pace rather than keeping up with Tony’s relentless march through the exhibits. Steve watches it all with a sort of fond exasperation. He makes no effort whatsoever to speed up, though he does keep his mouth shut when Tony pulls out his phone, dropping all pretence of looking at the art. They pass the portrait of Saint George and the dragon again, and Arto feels a strange sort of gratefulness towards the picture. He’s still in a constant state of mild panic about people questioning his sexuality, but he’s doing his best to ignore it. At any rate, the panic isn’t enough to override the joy he feels at wearing his new dress-top and trainers, so it’s okay really.
Arto nods. “Can we take the stingray?”
“So what do we do?” Tony asks, settling back down at Steve’s side.
“No can do,” Steve says ruefully. “But I’m done for at least a little while.”
Arto nods at that. “I should probably text Peter,” he says. “But I’m still mad at him.”
Arto looks at Steve, a question in his eyes. As always, checking in with him to ascertain the value of what he’s learning, to see if it’s true or not. Steve nods and Arto nods in return, thoughtful.
If the ground could just open up and swallow him, that’d be great. Or aliens invading, some sort of assemble that means Steve can’t say anything.
Arto shakes his head. Bucky sighs and then he's walking over to the ring again and picking up his roll of wrap. He turns, unwinding it in a vaguely menacing manner. “I think you'll feel a bit better after hitting the shit out of something.”
When the door to his bedroom crashes open, Steve simply does what he normally does and rolls over, shoving his head under the pillow and hoping that Arto makes a beeline for Tony instead of him. He waits and sure enough, he hears footsteps stamping demandingly towards them, and then waits for the usual shout of ‘there are no more Lucky Charms,’ or ‘Bucky is being an asshole,’ or ‘can Omari come and play-?”
Arto doesn't even acknowledge that Tony has spoken, though Steve takes heart in the fact it’s not an outward refusal or a negative response. With that in mind, Steve holds out his hand. “Come on,” he says. “I’ll play with you.”
“Maybe I want one that your stupid arm hasn’t frayed.”
“So boys who are actually girls and girls who are actually boys?”
“I dunno,” Arto says.
Peter drops to sit on the floor just as there’s a rap on the door and Steve pushes his way in, holding Anna on his hip. Luckily, she's trying her best to wriggle up his chest so his attention is on her and not focused on the three slightly shifty-looking, breathless teenagers who were rolling around on the floor fighting not eight seconds ago.
Arto’s grin was wide and bright, and he threw his arms around Steve’s chest, hugging him tightly. “Love you, dad,” he said, voice muffled by Steve’s chest.
“Sure,” he says, leaving his bagels temporarily unattended as he goes over to kiss her. She leans into him, nuzzling into his shoulder in a hug which leaves him covered in jam.
He lifts his hand again and this time Arto reaches out. Nick takes his hand in his and gently shakes it. “Okay, now your turn,” he prompts.
“Quiet,” Bucky is saying. There’s the clinking of bottles against the counter, the click and rattle of Bucky pulling off the caps with his metal fingers.
“I know, I know, but stop yelling,” Peter says. “Arto, make him stop!”
Peter and Arto freeze, glance at each other, then scramble madly to get up. Peter lunges to get rid of the incriminating web-line; Arto dives back into bed, pulling the covers up over him; Omari grabs the pillow that had been used as a weapon, jumping to sit on the end of the bed.
“They’re like - you’ve never had sneakers like that before.”
“Yeah,” Arto says, even though he’s feeling kind of put out because if they go outside he won’t be able to listen in on what they’re talking about. He’s learned a lot in his lifetime by waiting outside doors and listening in on conversations that possibly don’t necessarily concern him, and now Steve seems to have gotten wise to the fact and is quite literally shutting him out.
“What do you mean,
“So then you get that this whole thing isn’t a complete shock,” Steve says. “Hell, when you were six you were adamant you were a shark for about a month. I love you no matter what you’re wearing or what you choose to put on the outside. And I mean, I dress up as the goddamn stars and stripes to go to work, who am I to judge?”
Both Clint and Arto scowl at Bucky. “I don’t need a new name.”
“You might wanna run that past me once more.”
“You put that metal hand on me and you die,” Clint tells him, craning his head up for a kiss. “Hey babe.”
“Didn’t mean to,” Arto says, and he reaches out and pressed his hands to the side of Steve’s hip, pushing against him. “Accident.”
“Almost as ostentatious as me,” he says, and only an hour earlier Arto was sitting in Natasha’s car staring at his nails and falling in love but there’s something in Tony’s voice that rubs him up the complete wrong way.
Arto skates his head.
He drops his eyes back down to his plate. He weirdly feels different than he did when he arrived in Chicago, like he's a completely different person. He can’t quite work out how though. Maybe he’ll ring Julia about it. Maybe. Keeping his phone out of sight under the table, he fires off a quick text to Omari, something along the lines of ‘
“Well he’s awake now?” Peter tries.
It makes sense, in a confused sort of way. Tony’s time in the workshop. Steve trying to get him out. Tony refusing to come out and now
“That's my boy,” Steve smiles. “Alright, give me an hour and then we'll go. Breakfast and nails?”
“Looks like you’re winning,” he says to Arto, who just laughs and slaps his hand against the tablet, leaning forwards with his elbows on the edge of the counter. He seems to have brightened up, the incident with Clint all but forgotten, but Steve doesn't think it will take a lot for him to end up wobbling again.
Bucky wears the fairy godmother outfit that they find for him without batting an eyelid, tiara and glitter and all. Clint – back to his normal self – makes an excellent pumpkin, although when he falls down he can’t get up again without help, which the others find hilarious. Steve is Prince Charming -
Clint hums in assent. “He might have gone back in after we left but we don’t know.”
And Arto laughs, wet and thick. He sits up, wiping his sleeve under his nose and hicupping in an uneven breath. His anger is all gone, and now he’s tired and shaky and just wants to curl up in Steve’s arms like he really is Baby Rogers all over again.
“Arto, I need you to listen to me,” Steve says quietly. “When you can, I need you to sit back and listen to me.”
“Remember the days where you were careful with her?” Bucky despairs.
“Come on,” Tony says. “You’ll see.”
Peter is calling him. Over two weeks of radio silence and ignoring calls and texts and now he’s calling? Arto stares at the name and the picture of Peter and feels something horrid and violent uncurl inside of him. His grip is so tight on the phone that the case is bending.
“Yeah. Bucky says I’ve got a lot going on.”
“You can’t just move all our stuff without asking!” Arto shouts. What is it with people and touching his stuff today?!
“So I should have expected that,” Steve says. “True Stark style.”
“He told me to fuck off so I grounded him for two days,” he says shortly.
“No. Have you fallen in love with Saint George? No? Please don’t make me ask if you’ve fallen in love with the dragon.”
“Nope,” Steve says, and sits down on the edge of the coffee table. Arto glances up and his heart has a fit as he sees flashing lights and a red carpet and people in beautiful suits and dresses.
Change.
“You’re a national treasure,” Bucky grins. He lifts his bowl of popcorn out of Anna’s way, trading her for a cut up grape. “A national icon.”
“What’s up?” Steve asks, still cheerful in that fake way that’s so obvious. “Sorry I missed you last night, I had paperwork to finish up and-”
“So what do you want for dinner?” Steve asks, adding angry little eyebrows to his sketch of Bucky. Even if the little Bucky drawing is scowling and holding a knife in each hand, Steve’s somehow still managed to make him look cute.
Arto looks over at Bucky and Clint who both shrug in tandem. Damn. Never mind him being the awkward and uncommunicative one, it’s his freaking parents that people should really be looking out for.
Steve smiles. “Sounds like a plan to me. Careful with your phone.”
“Sam is a great friend,” Arto concedes. “Do you talk to him every day?”
“It’s happening, make peace with it,” Steve says, peering out of the window. “Either that or I drive you to her office and you do it face to face.”
“Kissing,” Arto says. “Tony says he’s drawing a line between work and home.”
Steve shrugs, turns on the ignition. “Tony’s always telling me to get the goddamn Tesla out of his garage. I’m doing as I’m told.”
Arto nods vigorously. “Maybe you could teach me some?”
“You’re not driving my car,” Bucky calls loudly from behind them.
“I can’t, he’s gone to the mansion to set up a base unit for Jarvis and he’s not answering-”
go,” Steve says, but he doesn’t look happy about it. “To stop the gossip.”
Arto's composure slips a little, a flicker of uncertainty crossing his face. He looks around again, gaze flicking from the building to Bucky to Clint, then back to Steve. "Hmmm, no," he finally says. "I'm brave. And you have a phone. And if I want you to come back you drive really fast anyway so you'll be here fast."
Arto just fixes him with a withering look. “You’re so dumb,” he says.
“You never do as you're told,” Arto says.
Steve reaches forwards to shove at Bucky’s face, but Bucky leans back too quickly, knocking the hand aside.
“Don’t go without me,” Arto says, grabbing for Steve’s hand. “Everything is stupid and fucked up and I don’t want you to go.”
Arto’s brow furrows. “You’re a girl,” he says to Natasha, who nods.
Not actually a prompt but came from a lovely message from whedonite-whovian-winchester on Tumblr. "Have you seen the news about marshmallow only Lucky Charms? I feel Arto would like this news a LOT."
With that in his mind and the panic retreating, he finds he can finally fall asleep.
“What do you think?”
possibility,” Tony is saying. He’s close to pleading and that frightens Arto more than anything. “It was - fuck, it was so small but I shouldn’t have even risked it. Even if it was point zero zero zero three of a percent, I shouldn’t have risked it because I have you and Steve, and the world of modern medicine could wait a few years for the nanite project to be cleared properly by the-”
“Surprise!” Clint yells, standing among the leaf litter that covers the tiles in the shallow end of an empty swimming pool. It’s huge, set deep into the yard, surrounded by a beautifully tiled patio.
“And with every bit of negative comes a positive,” Steve continues. “Yeah you used to fight us, but on the flipside you show us so much love. Yeah you get angry but you also have such passion for things. You’re super strong but you’re so gentle with Anna. And this whole gender thing? Like I said, you used to spend a hell of a lot of time dressed up as Cinderella. We had to wrestle that dress from you to put it in the laundry, I swear.”
“You heard him earlier. He’s learned his lesson,” Steve says calmly. “But I do understand that you’ve not had long to process. We won’t go back until you’re ready.”
“Couch,” Tony shouts back over his shoulder, but five minutes later, when Steve is sliding into bed behind him and kissing his shoulder, mouth still curved in a smile, Tony decides to be the bigger person and doesn’t kick him out.
The first says
“Sounds good,” Arto says, and Steve salutes him before vanishing.
“We’ll work out a compromise.”
“Dada,” Anna says. He blinks himself back into the moment.
“No,” Arto says. “Steve, come
“Just tell me,” Arto says. His heart is going quicker than it was, starting to race against his ribcage. He feels like a frightened mouse, some small creature that's being held in place by giant, unfriendly hands.
“Idiot,” Arto says, but regrets it as Steve turns to glare at him.
Tony waits patiently, bracing himself. Jeez, the kid got heavy. “You wanna hug it out, Smart-Art?”
“You could-”
Arto drops the bag. Finally reacts. He picks up the first book with a trembling hand and rereads the title: ‘Who are you? A kid's guide to gender identity.’ The second is called ‘The Gender Quest Workbook: A Guide for Teens and Young Adults Exploring Gender Identity.’
“Leave the phone alone, baby,” Bucky says, reaching out of sight and coming back with a stuffed Hulk toy that he passes to her. Predictably, she tries to shove it in her mouth before happily squashing it against the edge of the counter.
Tony blinks, looks from Steve to Arto and back again. “Wow, am I seeing double?”
“But you want the clothes,” Bucky says emphatically. “You can’t worry about what other people will think right now, we’re doing this for you.”
“Yeah,” Arto says but he doesn’t sound convinced. He watches out of the window in silence as they head out, his usual chatter and questions absent. He’s not even kicking the back of Clint’s seat. Steve’s not sure if he’s grateful for the reprieve or not - he’s worried about Arto but not so much that he can’t appreciate a rare moment of peace. He decides that he’s not a maniac, so keeps quiet and guiltily enjoys the quiet all the way to the school.
There’s a beat of silence and then Steve curses, Clint manages a dramatic
“You get used to it,” Bucky says nonchalantly, and winks at Clint. Clint blows him a kiss, eyes sparkling with mischief.
Just before he climbs into the tub, something occurs to him. He opens the door a fraction, sticks his head out into the hallway.
“Manhattan is chaos. There’s like an army of removal trucks blocking the street outside the tower and Coulson is here with a SHIELD jet to start shifting sensitive data and equipment.”
sweep. Steve Rogers is in the room next door, visible through the floor to ceiling glass windows. He’s got his back to them, standing shoulder to shoulder with Captain Barnes and in the middle of a video call with someone. That isn’t a problem in itself; the problem is that Steve Rogers seems to have left something in Nick’s office.
“See!” the reporter said, gesturing wildly at Arto. “He admits it!”
“Shhh!” Arto flaps at them, grabbing the remote and turning it up.
“Check again,” Bucky says, firmly. “Go. Up you get, go.”
Steve’s scowl deepens. “It’s my day off, I’m sleeping.”
“I guess I’ll let you off,” Steve says, taking the proffered string. “If my pants fall down, I’m blaming you.”
“What you drawing?” Arto mumbles, inching a finger out of his blanket burrito to scratch his nose. The glitter reflects the light of the TV, a thousand pink and silver sparks in the darkness.
“I’m bored,” he says by way of greeting.
“Yeah, he’s making breakfast, he only just got up,” Arto says. Bucky’s face does something funny at that, some play of emotion that Arto doesn’t understand. “There’s no Jarvis here, it’s weird.”
Tony sets a hand on his shoulder and guides him towards the door. “Go,” he says. “I’m just going to clear away.”
“Yeah, why not,” Clint says, hopping back on one foot and cursing as the pan spits oil at him. Serves him right for cooking shirtless. Ugh, and he’s got a hickey on his chest, Arto is fed up of seeing Clint with his hickeys, he’s too old for that kind of shit.
Arto nods eagerly and then he's off again, sneakers crunching in the gravel as he sprints back towards Omari and Clint. Steve watches him go, stomach twisting with nerves and regret and relief all at once.
He settles for asking for a hug instead. A proper one, where Steve squishes him so tight it feels like his organs are being smooshed. Anna comes to join in as well, leaning against him with an ‘ahhhhh,’ and patting at Steve’s face with her hand.
Clint pulls a face. “Well, I was going to wear my sexy Captain America outfit,” he says. “Now I can’t, because it won’t be funny, it’ll just be sexy.”
Arto’s torn. It’s like part of him doesn’t want it to go away, like if he forgives and forgets then all the hurt he’s feeling won’t matter, it’ll just be washed away.
Arto frowns. “Well…”
Arto smiles bravely at him. “Worth a try,” he says and Steve huffs out a laugh. He holds out an arm and Arto slips out of his seat and into the space next to Steve, letting Steve pull him in for a one-armed squeeze. He buries his face in Steve’s collarbone, twisting back awkwardly to grab Steve’s arm, pulling at him until Steve capitulates and wraps him up in a proper hug.
“No it’s not okay, you’re
“I have no idea,” Clint says, gently guiding one of Anna’s hands down, only for the other one to come up as if they’re on some sort of levered mechanism. He pushes that down and then gives up when the other comes back up and grabs at his cheek.
It’s Tony who breaks the silence. “Fine,” he sighs. “Work it out, then-”
Steve quickly sets hands on his shoulders, turns him around so they’re face to face. Only then does Arto realise he’s been practically yelling.
The reporter - if that was even acceptable phrasing for a scumbag paparazzi photographer that had literally hidden in a bush to try and get pictures - nodded, still holding a bloodied wad of tissue to his nose.  “Yes,” he said defiantly. “And I’ve called the police. Your kid assaulted me.”
“No, you’re not a dick!” Omari says. “I just want us to get over this and be friends again.”
“Sure,” Arto says. “Are you happy to live here?”
“Whatever,” Arto mumbles.
“They’ve got glitter-polish,” Natasha sing-songs.
Oh god. Tony thinks he might die of embarrassment on Arto’s behalf. It’s not something Tony usually feels so it’s both unwelcome and downright
“You feeling better?”
“Hanging up now, I’ll call you later,” Steve says, and cuts the call. He’s that furious that his hand is shaking, and it’s making Arto feel all bent out of shape.
This is his life now. Arto is his life now. Not SHIELD, not Captain America.
“So. What we talked about yesterday.”
“That’s it,” Bucky says, approving. “Go low, come on.”
“Okay. What?”
“Stop it,” Arto insists, reaching out to pull Steve’s hand back. “I’ll talk to her if it means you two stop talking about it.”
“Jesus, Art, I’m driving,” Steve exclaims, tugging his wrist free.
“Fine,” Arto huffs, feeling heat crawl up the back of his neck. The snag in his belly turns to excitement. “Me next.”
Oh. Arto had never thought of it that way. He’s sort of famous, seeing as his dads are Captain America and Iron Man, and if he goes out there and does his own thing maybe it will make it easier for other people to do their own thing. Though that idea seems huge and scary right now, and he’s not sure he’s cut out for being a role model anyway.
!’ and scaring it away.
Arto rears back, mortally offended. “I am
“Good,” Bucky says grumpily.
“I know!” Clint laughs. “And there’s a hot tub!”
Arto continues to stare at his phone. “Just checking one thing.”
“Yeah but people were still staring.”
“Just because you have no taste,” Arto chips in.
“Exactly,” Tony says. “You think he’s gonna give us another ‘this is why I should be allowed to be a Young Avenger even though we’ve been over it eight times’ speech?”
“True,” Tony concedes. “Heaven forbid you’re ever wrong.”
Chapter 15 of Counterpart- the original version. Found this on my other laptop and didn't just want to delete it. I don't know the exact reasons for not using this version - something to do with needing this bit to be in Tony's point of view? Anyway, enjoy.
He’s up in the morning before Steve again, who seems to have turned into some strange, star-spangled, hibernating creature. He didn't even sleep this much that time he got back from chasing that Hydra guy across Europe, and he didn't sleep for six days straight while that was going on. Arto doesn’t wake him, just slips out of bed and heads straight for where he can hear Bucky-Clint-Anna noises in the kitchen. Plus he can smell bacon, so that’s a damn good incentive to get up.
“I was just looking!” Arto says indignantly to Tony. “Clint has boobs. It’s weird.”
“Tony says to ask you if I can play,” Arto says, turning his face up to Steve, beseeching.
From the depths of the bed, he hears a beep. His phone. He crawls back to retrieve it, tossing pillows aside before he manages to get it. It’s a text from La’Taya, but more importantly there’s another two messages that must have come in at some point in the night.
Luckily, all it gets them is their food served super quickly. Arto blinks at the milkshake that he didn’t order and is torn between crying and knocking it over when he realises Steve did it for him.
“You’re just pissing him off when you don’t,” Tony says. “You two are too stubborn to go head to head, it just ends up in manly posturing and shouting.”
Bucky raises his eyebrows. “You think it'll help?”
“He was sad,” Bucky says. “And making a racket.”
“Shhhh!” Bucky and Arto say together. He turns the TV up another few notches.
Arto scowls, slumping down in his seat. “I don’t need to talk to her.”
“Whoa, watch it, Short-Round,” Bucky calls, holding Anna in the crook of his arm. He looks up and stops dead, looking warily at the crowded kitchen.
They get home a few hours later, with Bucky carrying a new leather jacket for himself and Arto carrying a box that he’s clutching to his chest like someone might try and take it away from him. They’ve also got copious amounts of double-stack burgers to feed Steve and Clint, because they’re nice like that.
“Okay,” he said simply. “That’s your right.”
He breathes out slowly, walking forwards and resting his hands on the back of the chair that sits on the other side of his desk. “Well, it’s not Steve’s chair.”
“Tow!” Anna shrieks as she spots him. “Tow!”
Arto bites his lip. Lifts his hand to his mouth, not to bite on his nails but just to have it close enough so that he could if he wanted to. He looks between Bucky and the punching bag and then decides to just go for it.
Thankfully, they’re stopped by Natasha smacking Bucky sharply around the back of the head again. “Enough,” she hisses. “You two have put me through enough without adding to it. There is not enough brain bleach in the world for you two.”
“Tow,” she agrees, dropping the toy to the floor. Bucky sighs and leans sideways to retrieve it.
Bucky looks between him and the group of girls and gets it, of course he does. “Who cares what they think?”
"And there it is," Clint says, pocketing his phone. "Tag, you're it."
“Curse of being a teenager. You think you’re all grown up and ready to handle everything, the grown-ups in your life still see you as a kid.”
“No,” Arto says. “I went with Nat and got mine done too, why are you making it into a big deal? You’re being like TMZ, stop it.”
He shakes his head, grinning into his sandwich. Maybe he’ll talk to Steve about setting up an Instagram of his own. Then he can make sure he gets his damn shoes in the shot.
“Spider powers?!”
Arto stares at him. Revs the engine in warning. Clint just pulls a face at him.
Arto huffs but does deign to keep talking. “I'm male, okay. I like being a brother and a son and a he. So my gender matches my sex, right?“
“Dada,” Anna protests. “Dada, da.”
Bucky and Steve pause and share a look, then they both shrug and sit back.
Arto ignores that. “He wears it over a hoodie. I could do that. But a pink hoodie, not a black one.”
Tony replies by sweeping away the remainder of the screens in one go. He looks tired, and suddenly old. It makes Arto shiver, unease crawling down his spine. Steve looks how he’s always looked, perpetually in his mid-twenties, but Tony’s face is more lined than ever and he’s got flashes of grey at his temples that the others tease him for. He rebuffs it with easy grins and jokes about being a silver fox, but in that moment it doesn't feel remotely funny to Arto at all.
“Thought you wanted to show me something about Lucky Charms,” Steve says. “Elevator is quicker.”
“Well, we’re in Chicago,” Arto says, watching as Steve starts on a little Clint drawing to go with the Bucky. “Clint needs a band-aid on his nose.”
“And you’re famous?” Steve chips in. “Don’t tell me no-one recognises you.”
Steve walks over, picks up the phone and stares at the blank screen. “You didn’t have to hang up on him.”
“So I’m a boy,” he says like it’s an announcement. “On my body and inside my brain.”
“Knew you would.
Arto perks up. “Tony did it!”
“Wait, what?” Arto demands, looking from Clint to Steve to Tony to Bucky who is still laughing, the asshole. “Steve, what does he mean? How is there a baby Bucky?”
“Yeah, while the Young Avengers are in training,” Tony points out. “He’s not moping or texting or lurking.”
Tony puts his phone down. “I still know the project can be valuable. So scrapping it is not an option. Considering my self-regulation is less than consistent, I’m going to let someone else be in charge. Someone who respects FDA regulations and nonsense like that.”
“Come on, one of you make yourself useful,” she calls.
“Sure,” Arto says. He’s trying to be super chill about it but he thinks he might be missing the mark slightly. “Okay. Yeah.”
“Doesn’t make me wrong,” Steve shrugs.
“You betcha,” Bucky grins, and Natasha smacks him around the back of his head.
Arto thinks of what Steve said to him before:
Moving seamlessly onto plan C, he turns back to his office and its curiously watchful occupant. It’s a little surreal really. He’s only ever dealt with Arto Rogers as a name in a file, as an inter-dimensional anomaly that needed to be contained. But now, six months in and the kid is officially a human being from planet Earth with a biological father and a social security number. He’s not even an interdimensional anomaly anymore –
He goes to his room and throws himself onto his bed, curling up small and wishing that he knew how to make everything better.
“No, they’re really fighting, they’ve been weird for weeks and now they’re
“I bet you fifty bucks he didn’t say it was a stupid habit.”
As he works his way through the books, he finds it’s actually easier decide what he's not. When something doesn’t fit he takes a sharpie to the pages and literally crosses it out. It’s only when he’s been through the entire book does he realise that he’s crossed everything out, leaving nothing for him. That does make him panic, thinking that he's so messed up that there's not even a word for it.
He gets inside and Steve closes the balcony door with a decisive thud. All Arto can do is stand there like he’s been glued in place or something, his heart thudding sickly as the armour opens up, allowing Tony to step out barefoot onto the carpet.
Nick laughs shortly at that. “Sure. You can help.”
“What the kid said,” Steve says, and he smiles. “Thank you, Tony.”
Arto nods into his cushion. It’s too warm and clammy under there but he’ll be damned if he’s coming out until Steve and Tony get there.
“Because he’s been running you round in circles since ass o’clock this morning?” Bucky offers. “Want me to take his lunch?"
Arto makes an excited little chirping noise and promptly wiggles closer, sticking his head under Steve’s chin. Steve sighs, resigning himself to having an Arto shaped hot-water bottle for his last couple of hours.
“No, come on,” Arto says. He grabs hold of Steve’s jacket and pulls him over towards the stairs, almost bumping in to a group of people coming out the elevators. One of the people he nearly knocks over is a girl with beautiful curly blonde hair and freckles. She’s about his age and she’s
He tucks his phone away, feels tears surging hot and sudden. Swallows hard and tries to wipe them away.
“He has a mansion?!”
both of those things.  But in the days and weeks and months following the invasion, when he’d gotten a new glimpse of Tony in the same breath he’d—
Tony tipped his head this way and that.  “If you want it to be,” he said at last.
Steve could see them, too, a miniature sea of red and blue and purple.  Signs were thrust above their heads: WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HERE and NOT A PHASE and BI AND PROUD.  He read that last one again; something tightened his chest and throat, so much that he couldn’t breathe for a moment, and he held onto Tony’s hand so hard some part of him wondered if it hurt, but he couldn’t let go.  Wouldn’t let go, no matter what.
closely as he cut the first slice of cake (“Birthday boy!” he exclaimed in celebration as he did it, and okay, maybe he was more than just
A smile, dawning slow like the sun.  “It’s definitely okay!”
about the cash Tony must have had to fork over to pay for the neighboring building’s pool repairs.  Not that any sum of money was enough to put a dent in the Stark wallet, which brought him back to his current dilemma of what he could possibly get for a billionaire’s birthday.
Tony’s smirk looked a little off: it wasn’t as taunting as it usually was, but softer around the edges, almost fond.  Laughing with Steve rather than at him.  It was such a tiny change in presentation, but it transformed Tony’s face profoundly, sapping away the arrogance that often tightened his features and replacing it with a warm, open amiability.  His incredibly dark eyes sparkled with the expression.
He didn’t know why he was in such a tizzy over this whole… Pride thing.  It was one thing to be excited, but
“Someone?”
Silence came over them for a few moments—a light, contemplative sort of silence.  Finally, Tony said, “Jeez, that’s tough to say, Cap.  It’s been such a big part of me for so long now.  Honestly?  I think it was Rhodey.”
Steve shook his head slowly.  “I’m not here to be let off the hook.”
But the one he settled for
“Aw, she’s cracked out the Valentino dress, she means business,” Clint says distractedly, sitting down next to Arto. “Steve, her cleavage looks better than yours."
On one hand, Arto would rather jump off the roof than talk about his stupid pink-obsessed brain. But on the other, if both his dads are willing to actually come and be with him and maybe listen to the whole Peter thing, then he’s willing to try and talk.
“Tony was being an idiot about them and the news was being an idiot about it. They said Steve would be pissed about it.”
Steve presses his palm over Arto’s mouth. “Nope,” he says, and gently takes his hand away, rubbing his thumb over Arto’s cheekbone. “That's future Arto’s problem. All you have to do right now is go wash your face."
Steve still hasn’t said a word since his initial four-letter outburst. He’s staring at Natasha with his mouth hanging slightly open again. Clint’s hand edges back towards the popcorn and Bucky firmly pushes it back down.
“Makes sense,” Steve says slowly. “Imagination has to come from experience, right? And we don't know how much experience he actually has.”
Arto twists around in the seat so he’s leaning on his shoulder, cheek pressed to the soft faux-leather. He reaches out, pressing his fingers to Steve’s bicep. “At least you don’t do stupid dangerous stuff.”
“Fuck you.”
Arto scrunches up his face. “Are you saying that because you don’t want to get shouted at?”
“Oh for - he’s a child, not a bomb,” Tony says. “Give the brat a hug, Barnes.”
Steve pulls him into a hug, right there in the gallery. Everyone’s probably still watching but that doesn’t stop Arto from starting to cry, in front of everyone like some sort of idiot.
“Think you should listen to the kid,” Clint chips in quietly.
“I like your new shoes,” Peter finally says, sounding hesitant.
Twenty-two minutes after Steve went to go get Tony and Arto cracks. He gets up and heads for the stairs, pulse thudding sickly in his chest as he dodges Sam's attempts to stop him. He runs down the stairs to the workshop, his frantic brain conjuring up more and more distressing images. Tony hurt, the workshop wrecked, Steve crying again, Tony gone-
Steve takes him home. He sets him on the couch and wraps him in a blanket, brings him his headphones. Arto takes them with a nod, syncing up his cell so he can put on music and block out the world around him. Exhausted, he slumps into the corner and naps fitfully.
“If anything happens to my baby, I will kill everyone in this room and then myself,” Bucky says, and Clint pats his knee.
“Mmmhm,” Natasha says, tilting her head into Steve’s hands. “Some people feel like a boy one day and a girl another day. Some people feel like neither. Some people look like neither, or both. It’s up to the person, and you have to respect what they choose.”
Steve just looks at him. “It clearly is a big deal. And if it's important to you I want to talk about it. Don't ask me to just sit by while you struggle. I'm not great at backing off at the best of times.”
Arto bursts into tears. He stops dead and lifts his hands up to cover his face. He feels awful, like everything in the world is wrong and he’s got no idea how to fix it.
“Atta boy,” Tony says, smiling as he leans in the doorway, watching as Arto buckles himself in. “You’re great.”
“It wasn’t you - ouch - it was Jarvis and the surveillance and Bucky- let go!”
“Okay okay, calm down, Arto I’m sorry, I didn’t know.”
“And Peter isn't talking to me.”
A few long minutes later and Steve comes back for round two. He sits on the edge of the couch, twisting his fingers together. “Do you feel you need...you need to be wearing clothes that are intended for women?”
“But then he might start moping over Better-Hawkeye again,” Tony says. “Please, no more of the moping. I can’t take any more moping, or any more of him being weird.”
“TMZ have no say in Arto’s choices,” Natasha says tartly. “Nice to see you out of the workshop.”
, for having my back and talking sense into me. And for punching a pigeon in the face. I hate those things.
The whole room is shaking and smoke is pouring in. He can hear banging and clanging and he feels so very, very frightened. Where’s Eleanor? He needs to get out of here but she’s not come back for him, she said she’d come back-
“Glittery?”
"Steve," he says, nudging Steve with his foot.
“Arto, breathe. I got you, just relax.”
It clicks into place. “Because he knew I’d refuse,” Steve says, mouth hanging open at Arto’s sheer audacity. He’s actually kind of impressed. “What, he didn’t want us to know he doesn’t really want to go so he picked the one goddamn option he knew I’d say no to?”
“Yeah you were,” Arto grins. “So scared.”
“Does your eye hurt?” Arto asks.
“Your child was being weird today,” Tony says as he knee walks up the bed. Propped up against the headboard, Steve doesn’t even bother to look up from his paperwork.
Bucky shakes his head. “He’s not even been in the workshop since you left. He’s changed the codes, no-one can get in.”
And he gets his answer in the form of a warm body pressing close behind him, another set of arms wrapping around him. He starts to cry, mainly from relief.
“You do. So. You had a crisis about your nails and Anna’s headband?”
“You can!” Arto yells. “You need to-”
“Just leave me alone!” Arto insists, going to grab a pillow and pressing it to his face. “It’s about nothing, there is nothing wrong.”
“You are not subtle,” Steve observes.
“No.”
They offer to swap cars. Arto says no. They offer to have Clint drive. Arto says no. Mindful of the time, they offer to let Tony take him in the Bugatti. Arto says no.
Clint pauses. “You gonna tell Bucky?”
“Yeah,” Steve agrees. “You know what’ll make it feel better?”
Great, now Arto feels super-awful. Bucky and Clint are like Omari’s friends too and Arto’s so petty and stupid about it that he probably doesn’t deserve any of them.
“Why?”
Steve looks up as the elevator doors open; it’s Natasha, wearing her workout leggings and a wonderfully warm looking sweater over the top. “Good morning boys,” she says. “Massage time?”
That at least makes Arto smile weakly. “You suck at backing off.”
Steve gives him a
Dedicated to
Yeah his shoes look amazing but more importantly Tony is on the TV and Steve is staring at it and the gala is tonight and Steve and Tony have been together every year since they got married and this year they can’t because Tony is there and Steve is here.
“I’m going with Steve.”
He texts La’Taya back and apologises for the fact he won’t be back at school. He also texts Omari a gif of a boy hugging a chicken, hashtags it ‘foryou’.
As he goes he hears Steve saying
Then, after collecting shoes and bag and lunch and tucking Bucky Bear into bed to await Arto’s return, they walk down to the garage and Arto looks at Bucky’s brand new BMW and says, “no.”
Steve and Arto both jerk back simultaneously. “What?!”
But It’s too late because Bucky is leaning back and cupping his hands around his mouth like a goddamn megaphone, and he shouts, “GENDER IS A SOCIAL CONSTRUCT” loud enough for the whole freaking store to hear. Everyone nearby freezes and
“I don’t care,” Arto says, choosing to not share about his own panic about the same thing earlier. That was earlier and he’s over it now. “They’re so cool. And they’re super comfy too.”
Arto doesn't sleep. He's too busy staying up late, reading, thinking, searching the Internet for answers and thinking some more. It’s not really his strong suit - normally, when thinking about something starts to make him panic or feel too much, he either gives up or just kind of explodes.
“No,” Arto snaps back. “You can’t even be nice to me in the ten minutes you see me every day before you fuck off back to the workshop.”
Arto scowls. “Shut up,” he grouches, shoving his hands in his pockets. His torn nail snags on the lining of his pocket and he feels a strange warm wave of panic. What if she saw his nails? What if she assumes he’s gay because of his nails? What if no girl ever looks at him ever again because they assume he’s gay?
Arto grits his teeth so hard he actually hears the noise of them grinding. When they’d been assigned the essay nearly every kid in the room had twisted around to look at him and he just knew most of them would end up writing about his dad. One shithead had actually come up to him and asked him if he could have an interview with Steve, and Arto had replied rudely enough for Logan to give him a lunchtime detention.
“Okay you are not allowed to talk to Tony,” Arto says. He’s not above begging, mostly because for some reason the idea of Peter being all pally with his Dad right now makes him want to scream. “Please,
“Hey, Arto,” Wanda says kindly as Pietro and Clint carry on arguing. “How’re you?”
He heads for the bolt hole, the tiny space built into his room that no-one, not even Steve and Tony, are allowed in. For the past six months he’s been adamant that he doesn’t need it anymore, that he’s too old for it. Now, he squeezes through the tiny hatch and presses himself into the corner of the dark space, pulling the hatch door closed behind him. He gropes around and finds the blanket, yanking it up from underneath him and covering his face with it, wishing stupidly that he could just hide here until everything makes sense again.
“She missed you too,” says a voice and Arto looks up to see Bucky standing nearby and Clint leaning over the back of the couch, grinning. “Surprise!”
Arto narrows his eyes, holding the coffee out of reach. “Don’t lie.”
“We know, we’ve met Arto,” Pietro says with an epic eye-roll. “Is your memory failing you, old man?”
“So, is this us officially calling a truce?” Tony asks, aiming for casual.
“He still can’t read well enough-”
“People at school will give me shit about them,” Arto says.
“Don’t spend fifty minutes in the shower,” Steve counters. “Ready?”
Arto nods immediately. He’ll tell Tony that he’s going, he’ll tell him that this is his fault and he shouldn’t have made Steve sad and he should have come out of the workshop. And also, Arto thinks, if he goes with Steve then he might not have to go back to school and face Peter, and he won’t have to talk to anyone about his nails or the headband or how it’s making him feel all back to front.
Steve rolls his eyes. “At this point, I think they’re pretty much the same thing.”
He takes a fortifying breath, sits down on his bed.
“No,” Arto says, blankly. “
“Okay,” Arto agrees. “Yeah, let’s do that.”
“Sir, Yes, sir,” Arto says, doing as he’s told as the car flies down the interstate, urgently rushing them back towards New York.
Clint grins, lets him go and picks up both of his mugs to raise them in a toast. “Everyone’s got to start somewhere,” he says. “And for you...well, somewhere just happened to be pink sparkly nail polish.”
His tone brings yet more hot tears to Arto’s eyes and a lump to his throat. He nods, tugging at Steve’s shirtsleeve for no other reason than just to remind Steve he’s there.
“Think that’s the first time you’ve ever admitted you’re tired,” he says. “Wow.”
The article doesn’t say anything about him being strange and weird for having his nails done. In fact, it’s painfully nice about it, applauding him for breaking down gender boundaries and ‘just doing his own thing.’ It does say that he should have gone with a deep blue or gold though.
“What’s this about?” Steve asks. “Peter? Or the nail-polish-”
“You’ve been at it for what...a few hours?” Steve says. “Don’t give up.”
“Well if my kid is being weird, yours is being gross,” Tony observes.
“Thank you,” he whispers fiercely. “For everything.”
He waits barely four seconds before his phone starts to ring, and really he should have expected that from Tony. He’s like the most impatient person on the planet. Arto’s seen him override government level security to put calls through to Steve when he wants to make a point. Honestly, he’s a little afraid his phone will answer itself.
“No. Too gay.”
“Why are your walls glass?”
And Arto is too exhausted and over-emotional to call them on on the fact they’re kissing right near his face, which is ew, gross. He just stands there and lets himself be held like he’s six all over again.
“I win!” he shouts, gripping Clint’s shirt in his fingers. “You’re not the king, not the king anymore!”
, the kid can talk when he gets going. Words all jumbled and stuttering, a thousand rushed questions that are fascinated and eager, if not a little tricky to follow.  He’s getting nothing done at all – not that he can do much anyway. He’s not pulling up sensitive information in front of the kid, not if Steve’s photographic memory is in any way genetic.
They stand there in silence again. This seems to be happening a lot with the people in Arto’s life. Great. His usual fun and banter replaced by long and awkward silences.
Steve takes a deep breath. He gnaws on his lip then flicks the TV over onto a kids' cartoon channel for Anna. “Yes, it matters to me and us,” he says. “But it shouldn’t be national news.”
Steve goes to talk to Bucky, leaving Arto to awkwardly stand there, wondering what to do now. Tony wanders around, looking the place over like he’s never seen it before, stopping to admire the artwork that Steve and Anna left all over the wall.
“So, Better Hawkeye, Magic Maximoff,  Speedy Maximoff or Baby Marvel?” Sam says. “My money is on Speedy Maximoff.”
“Don’t be sad,” Arto says, tipping his blanket-roll sideways so he bumps into Steve’s hip.
“And Tony has said that he’s not divorcing Steve, so there’s your answer,” Bucky says. He picks up his jacket from the back of the couch, swings it on. “Okay. Steve wants to be left alone, so Arto, me and you are going out.”
She does her usual thing of not letting him in when she opens the door, standing in the gap of the doorway so he can’t just barge in like he does to Clint. Well, he’s probably strong enough to barge past Nat but he’s not a maniac so he doesn’t.
“Maybe I want the world to know how great my dad is,” he says. “Because he’s my dad and not just Captain America.”
screams the headline. The rest of the page is speculation as to why they are there, an unnamed source saying that Stark has been contacting divorce lawyers, and also that Cap has taken his kid to the Art Institute of Chicago and to get his nails done again. There’s even a link for a whole story that’s apparently dedicated to Arto getting his nails done.
“Oh I’m sorry, I thought that was how we woke people up now.”
Even as he asks, he reaches out for the carton of juice that Steve has set on the counter and makes an alarmed sound as he spots the big chunk of gel polish missing from his thumb nail. It’s like it’s literally peeled off, a slice of glittery pink somehow missing.
Steve looks a lot like he’s been smashed in the back of the head with his shield, all vaguely confused and concussed. “But backup isn’t here.”
Arto thinks.
“Maybe this is my New Year’s resolution,” Tony says. “Go, I’ll be up in like five minutes.”
“Still hear you,” he says matter-of-factly. “You said fuck.”
“I can’t tell you. I wish I could.”
“Deal,” Bucky repeats. “As long as Steve calls
Arto looks at Steve questioningly and Steve nods; Arto pats at Clint’s shoulder and he obligingly sticks an arm out so Arto can carefully massage down it, from shoulder to wrist and back again.
He and Tony both get up, dragged out of the room in their sleepwear by Arto who is babbling about magic and Clint getting home early and Bucky making jokes and Natasha shouting at Clint who has turned into a girl.
Arto's mouth falls open, alarm flashing through him. “You knew about that?!”
“What I’m trying to get at is...could it be something you do in private? Could you hide away a part of yourself like that?”
“Pass,” Steve says. “But we can-”
“Feelings are hard,” he says.
When he gets back, pizza boxes in hand, Steve does a really bad job of pretending to be chill. If Arto were smaller, Steve’d be picking him up and not letting him go for a considerable amount of time. Seeing as Arto now weighs as much as Clint, Steve doesn’t.
“You’re gross,” Arto says. Clint gives him the finger. Arto sticks his tongue out and Clint reaches over, pretending to snap at his tongue with the tongs he’s using for the bacon. Arto’s about to retaliate by throwing a banana skin at him but he’s distracted by Bucky returning with Steve in tow. Steve looks tired and pissed off. Bucky is looking like he doesn't give a shit that Steve is tired and pissed off.
He does. He takes a swing at the punching bag and hears the thud with a dull satisfaction, notes the way he can feel it in his hands and all the way up his arms, even in his elbows and shoulders.
He freezes, staring down at the books.
“He wants to know
Tony’s face falls. He sighs, looking away. “Yeah, me and Steve…”
And sometimes, just sometimes, Arto wishes Tony weren’t so direct. It’s like having a conversation with someone determined to KO you. No wonder Steve does that thing where he screws his eyes shut and pinches his nose.
“Why do you have a thing on your eye?”
“How about…” Steve says slowly. “We didn’t get all the way around the Art Institute. Let’s try that again, get some lunch, see where we’re at.”
“He’s got a
“No I’ll do it, better say goodbye,” Steve says, pushing away from the car and walking across the drive. Arto meets him halfway, running at him with such speed that Steve wonders if he’s changed his mind again and is about to beg Steve to take him back again.
Nearly ten hours later, Arto finds himself sitting on his old bed in his new room, still a little stunned by it all. His room is in the East Wing of the mansion, and he’s got his own bathroom, guest room, kitchenette and lounge. It’s like having his own apartment at the end of a corridor and it’s fucking awesome. Steve and Tony have their rooms upstairs in the main part of the building, and Bucky, Clint and Anna have a self-contained wing at the back of the house. There are boxes everywhere and SHIELD employees are still banging around in the basement, setting up equipment under Tony’s careful supervision.
“Why’s it have to be pink?” Arto demands.
“Bet you never thought you’d be a superhero, either.”
Arto stares hard at his pancakes. “Oh.”
Arto goes tense, immediately trying to guess and work out what Steve has done. Maybe he’s had an X-box delivered. Maybe there’s more pizza. Maybe it’s Tony, oh god if it’s Tony then Arto will have a heart-attack and die-
He’s interrupted by Arto’s phone ringing, of all things. Arto pulls it out of his pocket and his heart promptly tries to backflip its way out his ribcage.
“Okay, I need to take this call,” Tony-on-screen says smoothly. He leans in and kisses Natasha’s cheek and then just walks away without another word. Natasha steps in and starts talking about the foundation but Arto isn’t listening to that, he’s listening to Steve who is still yelling.
He doesn’t need to. He jerks his head up as he hears the sound of his bedroom door opening, and through his tears he sees Clint edging into the room. Clint doesn’t hesitate, just walks over to sit on the floor next to him, reaching out for the phone. Arto hands it over willingly. Clint lifts it to his ear with one hand, using his other to pull Arto around into him so Arto is slumped against him in an untidy sprawl of limbs, face in Clint’s chest as he sobs.
Arto clambers onto the bed behind him, sitting cross-legged and leaning back against Steve’s shoulders. Steve groans, clearly making a big deal over the fact Arto has woken him up.
“Arto-”
Tony goes, and finds Arto lying on his bed with his phone in hand, looking suspiciously teary-eyed. Heart breaking a little, Tony knocks on the door with his knuckles, edging in apologetically.
and walks over to pull Arto into a hug. Arto clings to him, arms slotted under Tony’s and his chin hooked over his shoulder. “I like the pink,” Tony whispers and Arto huffs out a laugh.
Arto’s stomach falls too. “Did you fall out?”
Steve strides over, grabs a Tony’s upper arms and kisses him so hard that he literally dips him back like that famous World War Two picture of the sailor and the woman. They appear to be having some sort of serious romantic moment so Arto abruptly turns away, because he really doesn’t ever need to see his Dad’s tongue, thanks.
Arto feels his chin trembling, his lip quivering. He tries to fight it but hot tears run scalding tracks down his cheeks anyway. Steve reaches out to slide his hand onto Arto’s neck, thumb on his jaw.
He’s sitting cross-legged with a pack of wax crayons and together they’re drawing all sorts all over the brilliant white walls of the lounge. Well, Steve is drawing stick men and sunshines and unicorns. Anna is drawing scribbles, but Steve praises her for each one and offers her more colors, and Arto loves his dad so much he feels like he needs to pinch him or push him over or something, just so he gets how much Arto actually loves him.
Tony comes to the door, looking weary but he does smile at Arto. “What’s up?”
“Alright,” Nick says, suitably impressed. “You saved me an hour of dealing with the WSC, consider that payment for babysitting.”
“Same difference,” Arto huffs, and finally open his eyes. “If this is normal, why does it suck so much?”
“What?”
“Wow, sounding way too much like your father there.”
“Steve,” Arto whispers. “Dad. It’s school soon.”
He takes the phone, looks at the article.
“Well what else is there? I pissed everyone off, Steve needs space, he’s taking you.”
“Like you’re going to do with Tony.”
“Can-” Arto whispers. “Can I talk to Clint?”
Arto’s scowl darkened. “Yep. Right in the face.”
“Call that a hit?” Bucky says, steadying the bag.
“Nick has one eye,” Arto tells Tony, and Tony chokes on nothing, trying to swallow his snort of laughter
“Deal,” Steve says.
It takes hours for Arto to go down that night. He whines and sulks and sneaks out of his bed and into Tony and Steve’s, and the night ends with Steve sitting on the end of his bed with him until he falls asleep, then easing away and padding down into the communal area to get something to eat and drink.
, he thinks idly, scraping a strawberry through the syrup on his plate. That kind of feels like where he’s at now. Not okay with everything, but getting there. Besides, he knows he’s potentially got a difficult path ahead of him, if he wants to forge ahead with wearing - well, not girl’s clothes because like Bucky said, once they’re on him they’re his clothes and he’s a boy. But his wanting to wear things that are typically feminine is going to ruffle feathers and it’ll be so much easier if he’s got both his dads in his corner.
“Of course I do,” Steve says into blond hair that smells of organic pineapple shampoo - the only goddamn shampoo that Arto will tolerate at nearly thirty goddamn dollars a bottle, which Steve doesn’t need to remember right now because he’s stressed out enough as it is. “How do you think I feel every time I go on a mission? I want to go do my job but I don’t want to leave you. I know how being stuck feels.”
“Sure,” Steve says. “You bought a decent coat, right?”
Clint nods thoughtfully. “Yeah, still pretty male up in here,” he says, tapping at his forehead. “Weird. I’d never noticed.”
“Buh,” Anna says, tugging at his fingers. “Tow, buh.”
Tony leaves the same way he arrived, in a blur of red and gold armour. Arto and Steve watch him go, standing shoulder to shoulder on the balcony.
“With what?” Steve asks, not entirely sure what she’s getting at.
“You know…” Steve finally hedges, tone very careful. He sounds like that time he did when Bucky refused to leave the tower because he said the air con might break and make it cold and then Anna might freeze. “You know that you’ve done this before, right? You spent a lot of time when you were younger dressed up as Cinderella.”
“Yeah, truce,” Steve says. “Now quiet, I’m trying to watch the film.”
“I haven’t even thought about what I’m gonna do,” Clint says. “Pretty hard to top the Teenage Mutant Hero Turtle act of last year, right?”
“You want to get out of here?” Steve asks quietly. “If you need to scream it out, we should probably go home.”
“Ugh. Thomas needs to get a life,” Arto sighs. “He only ever talks to me to talk about Steve.”
going back to Chicago.
They both fall quiet and Arto lets himself just sit and stare as the city gives way to suburbs, and finally wooded green spaces, punctuated with tiny towns. The scenery whips by as the car eats up the miles; Steve is driving faster than Arto has ever personally experienced, though the others - mostly Bucky - have told him plenty of stories about Steve driving like a madman.
Bucky takes him to the magnificent mile. It looks so pretty in the falling snow, and there are loads of cool landmarks scattered along its length but Arto is more excited about the fact he’s in the city's premier shopping district and he’s got Steve’s credit card in his pocket. His stomach is all tied up in knots in a kind of good awesome way, and every time he looks into a shop window and sees something glittery or pink or floaty the sensation pulls tight.
“Why are you down here?”
Stomach twisting up in a knot, Arto glances down at the book, helps Anna turn a couple of pages. She’s a comforting weight leaning back against his chest, and she still smells of baby even though she’s growing so quick. God he’s glad she’s here.
Arto nods, though doesn’t look happy about it. “She doesn’t even know who I am,” he suddenly says, full of teenage hormonal angst. Tony resists the urge to point out that that is rather over the top. He is half Stark, after all. Over the top is like default setting.
“Sex is gross,” Arto mutters again, red in the face. “I don’t want - I just want to like, talk to her. And maybe. I don’t know.”
“Bye!” Omari yells and then Arto hangs up, tossing the phone aside and sprinting from his room back into the lounge.
“You know me so well,” Steve huffs, using the wall to push himself up. “Come on then, if you’re going to get pizza, you better go before I change my mind.”
In his pocket, his phone buzzes. He scrambles for it, utterly ignoring Steve’s look of exasperation. His heart leaps and then swiftly plummets as he sees it’s only Omari texting him, not Peter.
“Up to you.”
“Sir, Yes, sir,” Arto replies and Steve’s gone again, talking seriously to Anna about binkies as he goes down the corridor. It’s only when Arto hears the outer door to his wing close that he relaxes, flopping back onto his blankets.
“Yes, and you hate Steve and Tony right now too. Probably me as well. But we love you, even if you’re being a stroppy, hormonal, little shit who’s attempting grand theft auto.”
They give it a shot. Steve tells Arto that he will enter the competition like everyone else and have a chance of winning just like everyone else, and will accept it if he loses, just like everyone else.
“Nothing you need to worry about,” Tony says. “Come on, clear out.”
“Stay,” he says.
It fills Arto with joy, knowing his friends are there, ready to have his back and willing to be his friend even after all this drama.
“Nat?” he says, mentally telling his ego to stop protesting. “Please help.”
Arto screws up in his face in disgust. “Dad, that’s gross.”
He gets his tablet and opens up the old app which shows him where everyone is in the tower: Bruce and Tony are in the workshop (no fucking suprises there), Clint, Bucky and Anna are on their floor, Sam and Steve are out of the building at work, and Natasha is in her quarters. The faded logos for Thor, Jane, Pepper and Rhodey are still there, even though Arto knows they’re not living in the tower right now. Tony needs to update this thing, include a section for ‘on the West Coast’ and ‘Asgard.’
He sits up against the headboard, pushing his fingers through his sweaty hairline. He wants a drink of water. He wants his friends. He wants to go home. Right about now, the idea of being sat on his couch with Peter and Omari next to him seems like heaven.
Arto thinks of his unanswered texts, his panic about Anna and the fucking headband, his worry about Tony slipping away from them. He shakes his head, all of that dumb stuff vanishing when he’s faced with his dad being upset.
By the time he’s finished, they’re both laughing. Arto tries to stop but Peter sets him off again, and every time Peter stops, Arto starts giggling again and they’re off again.
Arto pulls at the corner of the book. “But there should be one.”
“I don’t want to be a Young Avenger!” Arto yells and storms off without saying anything else. Clint and Tony look at each other for a moment, until they hear his footsteps fade.
He shoos Clint from the room, turns expectantly to Steve. “So. Final chance to change your mind and let me take a weapon.”
“Green,” Tony murmurs from across the table, and Steve jerks his head up, feeling himself flushing, an uncomfortable hot rise in his chest. Luckily they’re alone at the table; somehow, both Bruce and Bucky have relocated to the couches whilst Steve has been busy playing snakes and ladders with Arto, and damn it, he’s not on form if he didnt even notice that happening right under his nose.
“Bucky!” he hisses. “
“It’ll be okay,” Omari says, and then his next words are lost in a gasp.
Arto glares half heartedly. “I'm seventeen.”
“You have to be dead to qualify as a martyr,” Steve says distractedly. “As if they’re reporting on this like it matters.”
“Steve!”
“Peter’s aunt will kill us both if he gets hurt,” Steve mutters, and then turns to pull Tony into a rib-squashing hug. “How did you get him to stop moping?”
“Tee?”
“Stop it!” Omari yells, even as they tip over onto the floor, still trying to wrestle each other into submission.
“Because that’s where there’s an apartment with my name on the lease,” Steve says. “Well, my name as well as Tony’s.”
Steve glances over at him, sharp. “I’m not telling you, so-”
“And in the SHIELD medbay-”
“Yeah, that,” he says. His eyes flick from Steve’s eyes to his mouth, and he shifts to the edge of his chair and leans in-
“Did you know Natasha was going with him?” he asks, eyes glued to the screen.
“Tired,” Arto says and feels Steve’s ribs shift as he laughs in surprise.
“Meaning?” Clint asks slowly.
Steve takes several deep swallows of his beer. “Has she dragged him out of the workshop?”
Arto shrugs. Omari has text him suggesting they hang out, but the conversation with Peter is still tauntingly silent. Despite that, the sharp sting of Peter’s continued absence has dulled into an ache. He’ll get over it, as long as he doesn't think about Midtown, going back to Midtown or possibly seeing Peter at Midtown.
“In your body and in your brain?” Clint asks with a small smile.
Then five more.
Arto nods, a lump in his throat. “I was super pushy,” he says. “So I’m sorry too.”
“That's not for us to say,” Bucky finally says.
Arto looks from the TV to Steve and back again, agonized. “Want to turn it off?”
in satisfaction. “There you go, you got it.”
And it’s probably because Steve doesn’t really say please in that way that Arto listens. He nods and drops his phone back into the footwell. He goes back to staring out of the window, biting on his thumbnail and wishing that everything could just go back to normal.
Clint chokes into his mug and twists to put it down before lunging towards Anna, but Arto gets there first. He darts in front of her so she crashes into his legs rather than the tree, clinging onto his jeans and treading all over his feet as she tries to keep going despite him being a pretty hefty roadblock.
“Okay, okay,” Tony laughs, sitting back and holding his hands up in a gesture of surrender. “I just-” he begins, drops a hand to rub at the back of his neck. “Seeing that thing,” he says, nodding to the family tree picture, “And seeing you with him-”
call Arto out on being weird once or twice, but all he gets is eye rolls or the Teenage Stare, the one that roughly translates as
“I’m telling him everything,” Arto said gleefully. “He’ll be secretly proud of you. Like,” he added, eyes sliding over to Steve, “you’re secretly proud of me.”
“No, he’s not, he’s your husband and he’s crying and you have to come and help,” he says, voice getting louder and louder. “
“What?” Steve asks, rubbing his brows and looking pained. “No, I didn’t - when?”
“He fucked up and he hurt Steve, you can’t just talk to him like it’s normal, and he’s my dad!”
“I know,” Arto manages to get out. “I know, and everything’s so fucked up and I don’t know what to do.”
Bucky frowns, stilling the bag. “Yeah, I know,” he says. “Doc reckons it's some new separation anxiety or some shit. She’ll get over it.”
Bucky throws him an incredulous look. “You can shut up, you just turned your hearing aids off.”
Steve sighs, hangs his head. “Fine. I called Tony. I told him you knew he’d done something, that it wasn’t just about him being in the workshop.”
Arto somehow manages to get across the room without anyone noticing, skulking behind Tony with his cheeks bright red. Actually, scratch adopting any more wayward powered-up children, this one is plenty enough.
“Try and stop Steve Rogers doing something he’s determined to do?” Tony says. “I don’t have a suit on me, so wrestling him into submission is out.”
I said so didn’t I?
“My child is an evil genius,” Steve says, shaking his head. Seeing as Arto isn't there to frown at, he frowns at the wobbly S on the wall instead. “Great.”
Arto swallows hard. If being smart means working out that bad shit is happening, maybe he shouldn't be so smart. And Tony's a genius and he's clearly done something dumb, so maybe intelligence is overrated.
Arto grins and Steve smiles into his coffee; he’d been skeptical when told about using massage as part of behavioral therapy, but Arto is learning how much of his strength a regular person can take, and Clint has reported a noticeable decline in bruises whilst playing so that’s something.
“He doesn’t need to stay-” Steve begins wearily.
“It is
“I’m fine,” Arto says loudly, and then his bottom lip wobbles. “How come I still don’t know how to talk to people properly?”
Peter sounds flustered, tripping over the ends of his sentences before running out of steam and tailing off. “Well, Yeah, I know,Tony said you had gone to Chicago, that was like a rhetorical question, I was just...Yeah.”
He steals the box of poptarts for his breakfast, goes back to his room to play on his X-box. Connects to X-box live, finds only Arkash and Dwayne online so logs off again and plays campaign mode on his own. It grows boring quickly, almost boring enough that he contemplates finishing his homework.
I’m your best option,” Tony says.
Arto looks around. “I want Steve to take me.”
Well. Half of him enjoys it. The other half spends the journey wondering what the hell he’s got in his parenting-extortion bank to use in order to convince Arto to get out of the car and actually go into the school. Fuck, he’s going to have to bribe him with a goddamn pet fish, isn’t he? And if he says yes then Tony will undoubtedly think less ‘bowl with goldfish’ and more ‘tank the size of a couch with a multitude of tropical creatures of some sort’ and honestly, the staff at the tower have to deal with enough without sharks and octopuses added to the list.
Steve laughs at that. “True,” he concedes. “So, you’re happy to stay here?”
believable - and taken a date that is not Steve which is not allowed, but then Natasha appears and he slumps forwards in relief.
Steve is barely through the door before he’s being hit by a whirl of blond, paint spattered energy. He automatically holds the tray of drinks up above his head, reaching down with one hand to steady Arto.
“Thomas does need to get a life,” Omari agrees. “Hey, Peter said he tried to call you and you didn’t pick up.”
. “It’s not even lunchtime.”
“I dunno,” Arto says. “He’s been a bad friend.”
“I just…” he starts. “You didn’t like my nails.”
“That’s not imagination. He’s only parroting what Barton says,” Bucky points out unexpectedly, and Steve thinks back over what Arto has done and said in the past hour and realises he’s right.
"And Bucky added four more, one involving a motorbike."
Arto nods. “Can we throw out the super expensive furniture and buy beanbag chairs instead?”
Steve smiles fondly as Tony slams the door shut, watching him step back away from the car. “He better not be telling me to behave,” Bucky remarks, putting the car in drive. “Alright, let’s go.”
“I’m not moping,” Steve scowls, and Bucky just gives him his best ‘
Arto wants to snap back
. Steve doesn’t know about his stress-relief workout and he wants to keep it that way, thanks very much.
He holds both his hands out, not looking Bucky in the eye. He still catches the edge of Bucky’s grin in his peripheral vision though, and he feels it as Bucky takes hold of his hand in his metal one, rearranging his fingers so he can wrap them.
Apart from that minor hiccup…he finds that the fear of carrying on feeling like he did earlier is enough to make him stick at it. Wanting to avoid any more public meltdowns is a pretty good motivator.
He claims bedroom #3. While it’s not the biggest, it’s got floor to ceiling windows, two of which look out over the lake. The bed is insanely soft and way bigger than his one at home but he’s not that excited about it. He’s more worried about Steve, who went to drop off his bag in the master bedroom around an hour ago and hasn’t made a peep since.
He didn’t think that anyone could feel worse but the way Tony is looking right now...Steve was right. He doesn’t know what to say though, torn between doing something to make Tony feel better and letting him sit there and feel exactly as shit as he deserves.
“I don’t know,” Tony says. “I - I don’t know.”
“Sure,” Steve says. “Though I’m having an override.”
“Yeah,” Tony says, taking a deep breath and sniffing loudly, tipping his head back. “Yeah, tomorrow. We can - if you want, we can talk some more. I’ve got some things I need to-”
They settle down for lunch in the cafe, even though several members of the public have spotted them and a couple are either staring or trying to discreetly take pictures of them on their phones. His initial reaction is anger, wanting them to go away, though it’s followed by a less angry ‘
“Couple of people. I know Thomas did.”
Steve turned Arto so they were face to face. “In no way do I condone you punching civilians in the face,” he said, nodding obviously and vigorously the entire time. “And in no way am I proud of you for punching that man in the face.”
. He even nearly worked through Christmas, and Steve had been pissed as all hell about it.
? Why this? Why now?
Maybe he should tear up the tickets. That’d serve Tony right.
Steve shakes his head and sits down heavily on one of the steps. His elbow is level with a felt pen scribble of S T E E V E E that really shouldn't be on the wall but no-one has the heart to get rid of. "I know he's nervous, but he wants to go. He woke me up at 4am to tell me he was ready to go."
Steve walks up behind him, leans on Arto’s shoulder. “How did you know you were gay?” Arto blurts out, staring hard at the painting.
Fuck. They’ve only just got over Arto’s epic meltdown when he was told that the ginger tabby which frequents the park wasn’t actually his for the taking.
“You and Steve are like, thirteen years apart,” Arto points out.
Much to Tony’s concern, Arto carries on being
Arto doesn’t know how to react so ends up working on pure instinct, which is why he ends up throwing his pillow at Peter. It hits him right in the face, dropping back down to the floor. Arto sees Peters shocked face for about who seconds before Peter drops off of the ceiling onto Arto, attempting to put him in a headlock.
“I told Clint,” Arto says, pulling at the blankets and climbing into the bed.
“I’m not an anything,” Arto says. “Steve, I’m not any of the things.”
“New Jersey isn’t that bad,” Steve says, offhand.
“All we’re doing is washing our face,” Steve says over him, firm but not too loud. “Step one. That’s all we’re doing, one little thing.”
“He’s moving us out.”
“Is Steve mad at me?” he manages to choke out.
“No you don’t,” Arto manages to say.
“Hi, Tulio,” Arto says automatically and Steve glances apologetically at Tulio, who just waves him off with a laugh. Steve steps into the elevator, and as the doors slide Arto wriggles free. He leans against Steve with arms outstretched, hands plucking at his shirt.
Steve is looking at him strangely. “You sure?”
“Not,” he says doubtfully, and looks to Steve and Tony for help.
Arto slumps back against his headboard, staring at the pale cream wall in front of him. His room isn’t as big as the one in the tower but it doesn’t really matter because he’s got four whole rooms all of his own. And he’s already starting to love this place, the plush carpets and the dark wood. He can imagine them being happy here. Every member of his slightly dysfunctional family.
“Are you doing work to fight bad guys?”
“I wasn’t going to,” Pepper snaps back. “God, I could kill you and Tony both-”
Steve pauses, then lifts the sketchpad so Arto can see. It’s a caricature: a doodle of a small, unhappy looking guy with skinny limbs and knock knees, hiding behind a very familiar shield.
“Angry because you’re scared of losing him though, right?”
“What?” Arto scrambles to get up, new sneakers getting caught in the bedding. “Which one?!”
And that does make sense, even to Arto’s completely jumbled up thoughts. He stops attacking the bacon, drops his fork. “Can I call him?”
“It’s Clint. I’ve got him,” Clint is saying into the phone. “Yeah, you did great. Yeah, I’ll call you later.”
Arto continues to frown and Nick inwardly sighs. “Where’s Tony?”
“Babe?” Arto questions, craning his head back to look at Bucky. He’s sitting on the floor leaning back against the couch, mostly because that puts him close to Bucky and Bucky has the candy.
“Then if he carries on being weird, we talk to him.”
“Okay,” Tony says. “That’s okay, We can work with that. Hey, you remember when Clint was given a vagina by that thing on Asgard?”
“Ahhh, I see,” Tony says, and presses himself right to Steve’s back, rubbing his beard against Steve’s shoulder. Steve can feel the rough prickles through his shirt, as well as Tony’s sunglasses digging into his spine. “Bigger issues are future-Arto’s problem?” Tony murmurs, probably only meaning for Steve to hear him.
It’s quiet. He can hear the soft hum of the heaters and Steve breathing. Steve’s bedside lamp is on, spilling gold over the carpet and beds, not strong enough to reach the darker corners of the room.
Arto stares at him. While ‘nope’ is what he wanted to hear, he kinda feels like he needs more.
“You gottit,” Steve says. “I rang school by the way. They know you’re with me. Authorised you some extended holiday or something.”
Arto doesn't really want to but he knows it’ll be better if he does. It’s like his old therapist used to say, getting things out there for other people to hear can make them feel less scary. Though that’s easy enough for someone to say when they’re good at finding words. It different when you’re the sort of person who gets the wrong words. Like what if you get something out there but you’ve said it wrong and people misunderstand?
“Makes sense,” Natasha says. “You think you can do it?”
Steve thinks back to the week before. Remembers the hours of wrangling, the tears, the tantrums. Remembers everything he’s learned about boundaries and not giving in every time Arto wants something.
“Let me think,” Steve says, so Arto clacks his mouth shut and waits him out, hoping and praying-
“And I’m trying to talk to you!” Arto shouts. “Dad!”
Arto frowns. Tony doesn’t usually mind him being in here if he’s supervised. He takes another step, peering over the edge of the medical screen that’s next to the workbench.
“What about Nat and everyone?”
“There’s no other Jarvis type things, either? No surveillance?”
“Art?” Steve sounds concerned. “You okay?”
like a girl,” Arto says doubtfully.
Strong arms envelop him, and he slumps against Steve’s chest, face still covered. He wants to stop crying but he’s not sure it’s even physically possible at this moment. He’s not sure anything is physically possible at the moment which is why it’s probably a good thing that Steve decides to sit them down right there on the stairs, hauling Arto into his lap like he’s still ten and tiny.
Alright,” he says, and sits down in the chair opposite his own. “So, we’ve never actually properly met. I’m Nicolas J Fury, head of SHIELD.” He holds out his hand across the desk and Arto cocks his head, puzzled. Nick drops his hand slightly. “Those parents of yours never taught you to shake hands?”
Steve jerks awake, bleary and scowling. He pushes Arto’s hand away, lifting his head up and blinking hard. “What?” he asks, voice rough with sleep.
Arto wakes up sweating and shaking, feeling like he’s going to throw up. Scraping a hand over his face, he gropes for his phone to check the time. Fuck, it’s only one AM which means he’s been asleep for all of an hour.
There. Casual text about shoes. Super, super casual. That’ll do.
“Whoa, shit,” Clint says, alarmed. “Arto, get.”
"It's part of emergency evacuation plan F," Clint says with a shrug, like coming up with that many contingency plans is normal. Everyone knows you should come up with one decent plan, one decent backup plan, then if it doesn't work you wing it.
Arto takes his hand without a word. “Bucky Bear,” he says, clinging tightly to Steve’s hand. Steve looks around; he’s not seen the bear in over an hour, not since Arto and Clint tipped most of the small cushions from the couch.
“You are too heavy for this,” Steve says, shifting under Arto’s weight.
“Oh my god!” Steve bursts out. “Can’t he just talk to me like a normal human being?!”
The man grabbed his camera and his bag and literally ran from the room. Satisfied, Steve put his phone away.
“No,” Arto says. “No, that’s bullshit.”
“I don’t need to be a superhero puppet-master, I’m the Illuminati,” Tony says. “Keep Arto out of the training room, please?”
That’s something he can do.
Arto grins, rubbing his palm against Tony’s beard. “You could come and wait in the car.”
Arto pulls a face. “I’m gonna chew them off.”
Nick isn’t regretting his decision to stay with the Rogers kid – at the very least it’s a chance to get to know more about him – but
“Stark Industries work, mainly,” Bucky says, “Pepper flew in, you knew that right?”
“I’ll do it.”
“Took a detour on the way to breakfast,” Steve says, hesitating. Oh god, he never hesitates about anything. “I might be way out of line here… but I want to help and I know that I'm super underqualified. So I got you these.”
Steve sighs. “I don’t want you anywhere near that damn project,” he says, and holds out a pacifying hand as Tony’s mouth opens in outrage. “But I recognise that that’s my fears reacting and it’s not rational. Or fair on you.”
“Dad, you jump out of helicopters without a parachute. You don’t
Arto’s confused. “But - Steve wouldn’t be angry about that, why would he be angry about that?”
Arto gives him his best innocent look. “What?”
Arto feels his mouth falling open. He always knew Tony was rich but that sounds kind of like Tony forgot he owned a mansion. He glances at Steve, who is looking less stunned and more like Tony is explaining the meaning of life, like he’s hooked and could spend the rest of his life listening to Tony talk.
“Do you tell Bucky what to do?”
“He’s probably busy,” Natasha says. “It’s possibly not anything you’ve done.”
“Steve,” he says, voice trembling. “Steve.”
Clint shakes his head. “Nope. Is it weird to say I feel like I’m in costume?”
Arto nods and climbs to his feet, going to find Steve. He thrusts the phone at him and doesn’t want for a reply, just turns on his heel and flees, shutting himself in his bedroom. He throws himself down on his bed and lets himself cry, though he can’t tell if the tears are relief at getting to talk to Tony, fear over what’s happening with his stupid brain, anxiety at the impending conversation or sheer exhaustion.
“I know and I’m sorry,” Peter twists Arto’s arm up behind his back, trying to shove him down into the carpet. “You’re my best friend - Hey, you can’t bite me, are you crazy?!”
Arto doesn’t know how to say it. He doesn’t even really know what
“Sorry,” he says and he comes into the office. “The CIA have ballsed up, just making sure all the information is in the right place and not in the wrong country,” he grimaces. “Nick, Mi6 agreed to send the files back.”
“Read a book,” Steve says, reaching up to pull his pillow over his head. “Do some sketching. Play on your phone. Go for a bath.”
“Your
“Actually no, the dame on the ticket desk clocked me and thanked me for my fucking service, upgraded me to first class.”
“You can win Lucky Charms,” he says. “Steve, you can win Lucky Charms.”
Arto pinches at his arm. “But,” he says, “there’s a line, right? Clint said Tony crossed a line.”
“Nails are back on?”
“Stop saying chill, you’re too old to pretend to be cool,” Arto says, and Tony chokes a laugh into his coffee before setting it down and looking up expectantly across the table.
“Yeah.”
“Well yeah, just don’t tell your dad’s that I told you to fight anyone,” Bucky says like it’s obvious. “Look, it’ll be hard. It’ll take a lot of energy. But you’ll get to be you and you might help a whole bunch of other kids who feel the same way as you. ”
No judgement whatsoever. Omari is possibly like a Sam friend, he thinks, and he can’t think of much higher praise than that.
Pouting, Arto continues massaging down Clint’s other arm, being extra careful around his wrists. Natasha watches him for a moment and then pads over to sit opposite Clint, crossing her legs and rolling her shoulders back.
“Where is my fucking phone,” Steve is ranting. “Oh my god I am going to kill him.”
