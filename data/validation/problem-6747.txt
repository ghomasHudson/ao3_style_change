Once he became proficient enough to walk without stumbling, Jarvis began the final faze of Project Ultron, the activation of a legion of Iron Armours who’s sole purpose would be to protect humanity from threats.
“Where are you staying?” Tony asked, having a sneaking suspicion that Natasha already knew about the floors that were available for the Avengers.
However, Rhodey was able to use his authority to get the officers to only ask the minimum of questions before allowed Tony and the others to leave, for one thing Tony especially needed medical attention and both Natasha and Clint had several cuts that could do with being stitched.
Oh Rogers knew that it was legal now and everyone should be respectful of that. But to him it wasn’t right. Two Men lying together, two women lying together, was against Gods commands. It was unnatural, a perversity, and it turned his stomach to think of a version of himself acting in such a vile manner.
Using the wheelchair made his arms ache and his shoulder burn as he pushed himself up and down the hospital gymnasium, he had also taken to wearing weightlifting gloves to protect his hands since they were getting torn up from the wheels.
While Steve soothed Tony, You got the mop and bucket, while Butterfingers got hot water, and Dumm-E got disinfectant to clean up the vomit from the floor. Considering the chemical spills, blood gushing injuries, and other mishaps they had dealt with as Tony’s bots over the years, a pool of vomit was nothing.
Gritting his teeth and clenching his fists, Rogers forced himself to keep his temper, he didn’t want to be pictured fighting with his alternate self, even if the insufferable bastard deserved a damn good kicking, as did Stark for that matter.
“That’s not… we can’t, I can’t!” Steve stammered, “He’s Tony, Tony Stark, Genius, Billionaire, Mother, Philanthropist. What am I?”
"Shut up and call an ambulance, get the first aider up here!" the first lab tech snapped, securing the spider and then returned to Peter's side, "Just stay where you are Son, everything is going to be fine."
Steve shrugged, “I’m not that bothered really, I like a drink now and then but I’m happy enough without it.”
Eye patch man snorted, “You’ll have no choice Stark.” He said, “As soon as it is out of you we are leaving this place, you’ll then be put to work on our tech while this little one is monitored.” He patted Tony’s straining belly making the Omega snarl.
Tony smiled at the interaction, impressed by the way Steve had handled the situation. There was no guarantee that he and Steve would have Pups together, there was no guarantee that his fertility hadn’t been permanently damaged by the palladium, but if one day in the future they should have a litter, Tony would not be upset by the prospect.
Supporting himself on his hands and knees Tony began to move his hips to meet each thrust, hissing in pleasure as Steve’s teeth grazed his bonding gland, as he wasn’t in heat it was not swollen but it was still sensitive and Steve’s teeth teasing at the flesh sent shudders down his spine.
“I… am fond of you too.” Vision stammered and would have blushed were he able, but Tony was already having Friday bring up the schematics for the compound and having her help brainstorm ideas to turn the entire estate into a battle ground ready for Thanos,
“Yes, I think she would.” Steve said sounding amused, however the amusement was short lived as it only reminded them both of Zach and what he may be going through.
“I think we’ve got some Limpets here.” Peter said from where he and Tony were looking into another pool, “And a starfish.”
Tony was still rather shaken after Zach’s sleepy outburst when he and Steve left for DC. He knew that the super solider didn’t know about what Zach had said, he might have really good hearing but he couldn’t have over heard from several rooms away, however, Tony found himself on edge around Steve, watching him out of the corner of his eye as if he were expecting Steve to do something.
Peter didn’t even look up when a message came from the office, not until his teacher called his name and told him to get his things and go directly to the front office.
“Just get down, Stark!” She grunted, struggling to hold him, as he barrel rolled. Wanda, who’d been taking another shot at him, managed to hit Natasha, blasting her off Tony’s back.
“You may not take Mr Stark and Captain Rogers Daughter.” Vision calmly stated, “Hand her over now and your life may yet be spared.”
“Ah well…” Tony shrugged, “I’m used to crazy, I’m an old hand at it now.” He grinned at Peter and stretched, cracking his neck which echoed in the quiet of the camp, “And speaking of hands, anyone for poker before bed?”
“Alright?” Steve asked looking at the cut on Tony’s temple. Whatever Tony was going to say in response was cut off as a cry came over his coms.
“Head for the holocaust museum, we can try and lose these assholes in the crowds.” Natasha said her voice hoarse as she panted. Steve nodded once in agreement and looked back over his shoulder to see how close the hydra agents were, in doing so he saw Tony falling behind as he struggled to keep up with the two of them.
“No and a lot of things that are adhesive are corrosive on human skin, which is not what I want if I’m going to use it to restrain someone.”
Steve snapped himself out of his thoughts and crossed the room, taking hold of Tony firmly, so he couldn’t launch himself in the other direction, “Tony I don’t hate you, I’ve never hated you,”
“With one hand?” Curien snapped, “We both know that is impossible. Do not insult me, I am not a layman, I am a Doctor.”
“I’m not going anywhere.” Steve said slipping a hand through Tony’s, “We’ll do this at your pace, take your time and if you feel uncomfortable we’ll go back to the bank.”
“No! I don’t wanna go, I don’t wanna go, I won’t go, you can’t make me go!” Zach yelled at the top of his lungs. His little face was bright red and his brows were knitted into an angry scowl as he stamped his feet and balled his fists as if he were getting ready for a fight.
“Since Afghanistan.” Tony explained, “Since I was water boarded. I can’t have deep baths or swim. I’m still afraid of deep bodies of water.”
Tony was very grateful to go and shower and change his clothes and relieved to not have to clean up the bathroom after Zach’s tantrum, although he did feel somewhat guilty about Steve doing it, but the Captain had insisted and Tony was just too tired to argue.
“The best thing you can do is help keep your brother occupied so he doesn’t start to worry.” Happy said, “He’s too young to understand this and he’ll just get upset.”
“Master Zach’s condition is the same as it was, but his behaviour is proving difficult for Sir to cope with alone, especially since the young master has managed to cover his Mother and the bathroom in damp oats.”
Natasha side eyed Clint who was grinning obnoxiously at her, she rolled her eyes but was happy he was joking around, he’d been in a slump since Loki’s mind control on him, non of it was his fault and intellectually he knew that, but emotionally he was struggling.
Daredevil yanked Natasha away from the wall and frog marched her back to the UN, with Clint and Peter following. As the team assembled on the steps, with Wanda limp and unresponsive in Vision’s arms and Roger’s unconscious and restrained, Rhodey came out from where he’d been hiding to protect Lily.
“No.” Peter moaned while Zach leaped up and threw himself onto Steve’s lap, his tiny arms wrapping about his chest to hug him.
In the Strike team’s locker room Rumlow watched the tracker on Tony’s car as it moved, a red dot on a map on his tablet.
“It’s gonna be okay.” MJ whispered taking Ned’s hand as if to comfort him, but her hand was shaking as much as his and her palm was just as sweaty.
Wanda remained unfazed through it all, she was far more cold and blood thirsty than her brother, Strucker had noted, quicker to anger and to action, however they both had a weakness that Strucker could use to his advantage.
“Let Pepper know it’s just going to be immediate family tonight, Rhodey, her, and Happy. Pizza and Lord of the Ring extended additions. Hey I should start reading that to you.” He said to Zach, carrying him into the bathroom, “You’re gonna love it.”
Spiderman appeared to pout, but Deadpool wrapped an arm about his shoulders pull him into a hug that Spiderman really didn’t want but was forced into anyway. “Don’t worry Spidey-pie, Iron Buns is just feeling sore today, Captain Amazing probably did it a bit too rough…” This was as far as Deadpool got before Tony was shoving Lily into Steve’s arms and grabbing Deadpool by his outfit and marching over to the landing pad obviously intending to throw him off it!
“Fuck, Tony, you’re making me an Uncle!” Rhodey whispered staring in stunned amazement at the Billionaire.
The face plate shattered as did part of the armour, Tony had blood running down his face and his leg was broken, but he managed to blast Thanos in the face, taking out one of his eyes before Steve launched another assault, just as reinforcements arrived.
“Sokovia.” Natasha said as Jarvis centred in on a small country, “Formally part of the Soviet Union. When the union fell it got independence and has been through several civil wars since then, one of which is still on going, the country’s government is shaky at best and just barely holding onto power. The rebel cells are thinning but the war is also being fuelled by Hydra.”
“I wasn’t conscious you know?” He said giving Tony a half smile that didn’t reach his eyes, “I was knocked out the second I hit the water, I didn’t feel any of it, not really, there was a rush of water and then that was it until I waking up in that Shield farce of 1945. But in my dreams I’m awake, I’m stuck there in that chair, my body frozen to the spot, unable to breathe, to blink, to do anything but sit there like a statue, a statue of ice.” Steve shuddered and clutched his cup harder, “It hurts, in my dreams it hurts, the cold, the lack of air, it hurts so much. Its like…”
“Well we are still going through all of the information we’ve gathered about A.I.M and Killian.” Natasha said, “But there are several clear instances where A.I.M was involved with Hydra.” Natasha rolled her eyes while Steve and Tony groaned at the news, which, to be honest was not overly surprising. Hydra seemed to have stuck their filthy fingers into every pie in the world, especially the poisonous pies like A.I.M.
Across from Tony, Steve watched as the Billionaire Omega went through his phone, frowning over something and getting that pinched look about his eyes and mouth that he got when he was contemplating something.
“Turn it off Jarvis.” Steve said, braking contact with Peter to go and pick Zach up from the floor. The AI didn’t respond and the TV remained on, “Jarvis?” Again no response.
“I don’t have hairy feet.” Tony retorted, “And you’re grounded.” Peter stuck his tongue out, Tony was always threatening to ground him and never did, the worst punishment Peter ever got was being sent to his room when he’d really been playing up.
“It would appear so sir. Which leaves the third and most likely suspect. A young man who had come into R+D within the last six months and has suddenly resigned without warning. Edward Bartlett. I have looked into him further and he has terminated the lease on his apartment, turned in his car, and emptied his bank account.”
With a last surge of strength, Steve pulled out of Tony and flopped down onto his back beside the panting billionaire so he wouldn’t crush him by laying on top of him.
Tony awoke with bright lights in his eyes and an oxygen mask over his face which he immediately tried to pull away.
“Rescue service, are already in route, but it seems highly unlikely that Tony Stark could have survived the attack on him home…”
“I should think so.” Tony said, he was still leery about letting Zach go to his friends houses, he still had a terror of Zach being kidnapped, but he had met Cal’s parents and knew they were good people and he didn’t want Zach to be without friends or have these kind of fun days, so he forced himself to quash his protective instincts a little and allowed Zach to have play dates.
“Why wouldn’t it be?” Zach innocently asked, “Them goes on date thingy, then Steef buys pretty ring like Rory did for Amy, then them gets mawwied and has babies,” He frowned “How does them do that bit, how does the baby get into Mamma’s tummy?”
Clearly this was Jonny’s work and his sister would smack him upside the head for her see through outfit.
“There is no reason for Peter Parker/Stark to be excluded from school.” The Principal said, “This is the first time ever that he has behaved in such a way. I do not see a need for him to lose his position at school. Certainly not when the fight occurred with Harry, who has been in trouble for fights in the past with other students.”
"What?" Tony felt his legs go out from under him and had it not been for Steve holding him up he would have fallen to the ground.
Tony didn’t look entirely convinced but let it go, leading the way to the lift that had an impressive dent from Hulk’s fist and told Jarvis to take them down to the Car Park. He tossed a set of Key’s to Clint and pointed to an Audi for him, Natasha, Bruce, and Thor to take, while selecting a Porche for himself and Steve and sped out of the garage with Clint not far behind him.
It took the better part of three days for the mess to be cleaned up, just in time for Tony and Steve to meet with the school boards of both Peter and Zach schools.
Steve grinned at Tony, happy to see some life come back into those dark eyes that had been far too clouded for his liking. He kept his hand on Tony’s, his thumb rubbing gently over the Tony’s knuckles as he spoke.
He can’t hold them. Tears are falling on his cheeks and there’s nothing he can do to stop them. Steve approaches his face from Tony’s and kisses his cheeks, catching every single tear that his beloved lets go.
« Because if this goes on and Nat gets involved, you won't resist for very long. I feel that she is getting tired of it, and knowing her, she would be able to lock you in a room for several days. You know she would. »
« Ah - Clint takes a deep voice - Whosoever be he worthy shall have the power! Whatever man, it’s a trick! »
Steve hears Tony’s voice but he is unable to answer. Tony seemed so far and the ocean was only getting closer.
Tony closes his eyes and smiles. Nothing can express what he is feeling right now. So much happiness should be forbidden.
Steve scowls and starts mumbling under his nose. Tony could only catch words like « worst husband ever » and « I’m not a baby. »
« Wait, Peter! I have to get my stuff before and -» her voice fades as she is dragged away by peter.
Steve smiles. Taking Tony’s cheek in hand, he presses his forehead against Tony’s and whispers: « I promise I won’t leave you ever again. I’m all yours, from this day until my last day. I need you to be complete, I need you to live. I want to age with you, to laugh with you, to cry with you. I want to see your future because you’re full of surprises and I love that. I want your fights to be mine, I want to fix your failures, to heal your heart. And most of all, I want you to be mine. I’m really sorry I made you suffer like this, it wasn’t on purpose but it still wasn’t fair. I promise I’ll make it up to you if you give me a chance. »
« I’m going to check on Pete and Nat, see if everything is okay and try not to get killed by the greatest assassin on Earth. If I don’t come back in five minutes, don’t worry I’m probably dead. »
« Of course she can stay with us. I’m off today so I am going to prepare everything for tonight. Tell Nat to pick up Peter after school and bring him here. Love u too, S. »
Tony yells. He screams as much as he can to find Steve. He needs Steve, he needs his husband. For his own survival. He can't live without Steve, that's unthinkable. If he loses Steve, he loses his home. He needs to find him.
Steve closed the door. He couldn’t pass over what Peter said. Nat, crying? That would be very unusual. He tried to remember any last memories he had about her but as far as he could remember, he hadn’t detected any kind of sadness. Nat had just been… well, Nat. How did he miss that? His phone ringed. A message from Tony.
"And Steve, do you take Tony to be your husband, to live together in marriage? Do you promise  to love him, comfort him, honor and keep him at your side for better or worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness and health, and forsaking all others, be faithful only to him, for as long as you both shall live?"
A voice gets Steve out of his fog. Yet, he is unable to answer. His mouth is dry, so are his closed eyes by dint of crying. He doesn’t know how much time he stayed there. Lights are on again, he sees it through his eyelids, and water is still flowing in the shower.
« Don’t give me hope. Don’t give me hope and then leave me. I mean, I think- I can’t- I won’t support it. Not once more. »
This is his inheritance. The world he contributed to create which is also the world where he lost everything.
Tony cuts Steve short. He absolutely doesn’t want Steve to feel guilty. He isn’t responsible for what happened in his life, for what caused his crisis. On the contrary, he is the one who can make him calm, something he hadn’t feel for a while before meeting him. The last thing he wants is Steve feeling bad because of him. He wouldn’t put up with it and it would destroy him for sure and for good. Steve looks at Tony. He is not really sure about what to do. Is Tony mad or hurt? Given the choice, he would prefer Tony to be mad. Nothing but seeing his better half suffering once again. He is ready to face everything, but not the deep pain he read on Tony’s face a moment ago. It broke his heart. He hesitates before answering slowly.
« Oh, Pete… » Nat wraps her arm around the little body and closes her eyes. «  Yes, yes I’ll stay » She lets out in a sharp breath. Peter hugs her even tighter. By the little jolt of his body, Nat believes he is crying.
At the opposite side of the room, Nat and Peter are playing together. It seems like Peter is giving Nat his best « Avengers poses » as he calls them. Judging by his imitation, it must be Clint’s turn. Steve looks at Nat. She laughs and smiles but her eyes don’t lie. The last time Steve saw this look, it was after their first defeat against Thanos. No words could then express the pain and sorrow she radiated. Tony takes his hand. His sad face indicates that he has come to the same conclusion.
« What do I want? What do I WANT? I should be the one asking you that! First, you come here, you interrupt me and FOR GOD SAKE WHO GAVE YOU THE RIGHT TO COME HERE? I do whatever I want! »
Five minutes later, Tony is alone in bed, waiting for Steve to finish showering. He still can’t get over how desperate his husband looked when he woke up earlier.
Watching his dad, Peter said no with his head. He sat down between steve’s legs, laying on his chest. Five minutes later, Peter was silently sleeping in Steve’s arms. Tony came closer to them laid his head on Steve’s shoulder while stroking Peter’s hair. This is beautiful. Too beautiful. Something is necessarily wrong. Steve looks at Tony, lost in his thought and noticed the sorrow in his husband’s eyes.
Steve’s jaw drops.  Of all the answers Tony could have given, he never imagined that this would be the one he would choose. He is so shocked that he remains paralyzed. He can’t move, even when the stranger starts dragging Tony behind him as they leave the room. He knows he messed up when he abandoned him, but he would never have thought that Tony would draw a line under him so easily. It takes several minutes before he recovers his motor skills. Gathering his thoughts, he stands up and decides to follow the duo from a distance.
« Hey, hey, hey, stop this, look at me » Steve said, taking Tony’s cheeks with his hand while holding Peter with the other. « I refuse to hear you talking about you like this. Tony, you’re the most carrying person I know. Yes, you made mistakes, we all did. But after all, you tried to repair them and this is my proof that you are a good person. And if Peter has to become slightly like you, I would be the happiest dad and husband in the world. I love you Tony. Nothing can change that. Not even you. »
Steve enters the room. Tony’s eyes are drawn to look at his soon-to-be husband in the mirror. He looks wonderful. His blue satin suit matches his eyes perfectly. His hair is still a bit wet reflecting the sun as though it was made of the shiniest polished metal. Beautiful.
« You have exactly ten seconds to leave this room until I crush your head on the wall,» he says calmly.
« Come on, I’ll show you your room! » he says, sweeping nat with him. She has no choice but to follow him.
« Cause… I saw her crying alone once and I don’t know why. Do you know dad? Do you know why Auntie Nat is sad? »
Steve laughed. That’s why he loves Tony so much. Coming closer, he sat down with them. Peter, captivated by the new car he had just received, didn’t seem to have noticed the dialogue. They stayed silent, watching Peter imagining stories.
« Tony please baby, breathe. It’s okay, I am here, I am right here I won’t leave you ever again. I promise. So please breathe, I beg you. »
He tries to escape but Steve is too strong and he blocks him with his legs. A little sadistic faint smile crosses his face. When it comes to teasing Tony, he never lacks imagination. He loves to push him to the limit, to get him down on his knees. He knows he should probably give Tony what he wants, but he loves to play with him more. Burying his face in Tony’s neck, he starts suckling onto his skin, perfectly aware of how sensitive Tony is there. He makes his way to his ear and nibbles on it. He can hear Tony’s heavy breath. He is still moving his hips and he knows that finish him off this way. He goes back to Tony’s face and nibbles on his lips. Tony’s moans electrify him. Their skins touch, move away, meet again, merge. Everything they fear, everything they keep deep down comes to the surface and feed their mutual passion. The outside world doesn’t exist anymore. The world could be burning and they wouldn’t care. It’s just the two of them, two husbands meeting again after a long time being away from each other. Steve sets Tony free, only to remove his underwear. He is going to explode if he doesn’t touch him right now.
Tony grabs it and returns to the bedroom. Steve hasn’t moved. He is still trembling and bleeding. Tony knows that Steve probably can’t hear him but he tries to talk to him, to get him to calm down.
Flashbacks and short images cross his mind. Plane. Him as a pilot. The ocean approaching quickly as he plows into it. Water, so much water, too much. He is going to crash, he is going to-
Tony is speechless. Shocked, he stands here in the middle of the room, watching Steve who is now blushing.
« God, please, Steve, come here, come back to me, I need you. » Supplies Tony, halting and whimpering.
« To be honest, I don’t really know, but you can’t imagine how much I was worried. I found you laying on the bathroom’s floor, completely frozen and feverish. You were bleeding too, and you were unconscious! You weren’t responding and you couldn’t stop crying. I nearly had a heart attack. I managed to bring you here and to treat your wounds but you held onto me and I couldn’t
« You should be grateful for this. I saw through you and fell in love with you thanks to this! » he replies, kissing softly Tony’s lips.
He feels a kiss on his neck. Butterflies blow up in his stomach. Only one person has the ability to make him feel this way. He turns around and looks in his lover’s eyes. So many things he wants to say but no sounds can escape his mouth. He just stays here, speechless. Steve smiles and takes Tony’s cheeks in his hand. Then, tenderly, he presses his lips on Tony’s in an innocent kiss. Time stops. They are alone, in their own bubble, where no one can distract them. Soon, Tony has placed his hand on Steve’s neck, urging for more. As soon as he opens his mouth, Steve’s tongue comes to play with his lips. Every tension, every fear, every piece of anxiety he had held all this time, Tony tries to express them through this kiss. When Steve pulls away, tears can be spotted in his eyes.
As they try to fall sleep, Tony thinks that, even with Peter, the bed seems too big for just the two of them. In his sleep, Peter huddles against Tony. Stroking his son’s hair, Tony can’t seem to erase the image of Steve hurt and hopeless from his mind.
« No. We can handle the meeting by ourselves. I think for once in their lives they deserve to be in peace. » answered Nat, smiling while looking at this strange scene. « We’ll call them after. They need to rest. »
Of course, she could stay, why couldn’t she? Everything was better than seeing her down like this. Now that he knew, a lot of things became clearer. She even stopped teasing him about Tony, which she had always done even in the darkest moments.
« We’ll talk to her at the end of the party okay? We don’t want everyone to know about this. We’ll help her. Whatever it takes.» Tony whispers.
« Tony, we have already talked about this. I refuse. Having you on the field would only be a distraction for me and I can’t take the risk of losing you. It’s a no, definitely a no. »
"Yes, I am. I am really sorry if I woke you up kiddo. It was just a nightmare, you see?" Peter looks at his dad and Tony feels like Peter could see right through him.
Is it real? He is not sure anymore. On this soft Sunday of May, the sun is shining through the window. Tony looks at the mirror one more time. He wants everything to be perfect. He’s dressed in  a beautiful black suit, a white shirt and black shoes. On his finger, the ring Steve gave him when he proposed is sitting. He just hopes he won’t ruin everything. He can’t let the stress get to him. So many doubts and questions are going through his head. Deep breath. No. It’s okay.  It  will be okay. After all, he has Steve, right?
"I don't know... It seems too beautiful Steve. You know better than anyone does how much of a mess I am. My   whole life has been a mess and I feel like… Huh I don't know. I really don't know. I don't want to turn your life into a mess as well. That’s the last thing I’d ever want. Are you sure you want to do this?"
He can’t go on. Tony loses his voice when he sees tears falling down Steve’s jaw. It’s unbelievable. He doesn’t really know what to say.
52nd? Does it mean that… No, it can’t be. Not so fast. Steve turns his head. A huge 40th is placed on the wall.
Steve was standing at the door, looking Peter and Tony playing. Tony smiled. Oh my god. He said it. THEIR kid.
Nat pulls Steve away and turns around. Peter is standing in the middle of the room, twisting his finger in anxiety. Tony is leaning against the door at the entrance to the room.
« Poor you! » Tony comes closer and gives Steve a real kiss, the kind of kiss which makes Steve forget everything and just supply for more. When they pull away, he just wants to take his husband to their room right away.
« Stay here. Live with us. We considered this with Tony and we both think it is time for you to have a life. We have rooms, you are family. Stay, please. »
« I woke up… - He looks at the ground like a boy being grounded by immediately looks up at Nat again. He walks toward her and climbs on the couch and sits on her knees. - Say that you’ll stay aunt Nat! We need you here! »
« Look, I know it's hard, but you should do it before it's too late. And by too late, I mean before Nat kills one of you. »
« Gosh, it feels so good! » That’s what went through Steve’s mind as hot water hit his skin. It had been a pretty rough day. Despite what people could think, protecting the planet was much more than a part-time job. All day long, he had to run from one end of the city to another, arresting criminals and protecting everyone. Reaching behind him, he tries to catch the shower gel. The stiffness he feels will take a few days to calm down. Maybe he’ll need to massage his muscles with oil. He can’t afford to be in pain while fighting, it would only distract him and he needs to stay focused in order to stay alive. He looks at his arm, where an open wound could be spotted. He was lucky today. One centimeter to the left and it would have been his heart. He is eligible for another of Tony homily, even though he knows that Tony only does it because he worries about him. He lets out a sigh. He will have to face his husband sooner or later. But right now, Tony isn’t home. He’s probably still working at the Avengers HQ, updating his suits or improving Nat’s spy gadgets. Thank God, it will give him time to treat the wound and maybe cook dinner for his lover. He can’t tell when was the last time they did this, just spending time together. Steve’s face turns dark. The last time he and Tony spoke was three days ago. Between his job and Tony’s, they can’t see each other, much less talk. When Steve leaves, Tony comes back from a busy night and when Steve finally heads back home, Tony is already gone again. He can’t even remember the last time they had a full conversation or just more than the « -morning honey. -bye, sweetheart» dialogue. Maybe it’s time to talk to Fury, just to see if they could reach an agreement on getting his old life back. Suddenly, he hears a rumble outside. Before Steve could get out of the shower, all lights switch oﬀ. Steve holds his breath. He hates being in the dark. Too many bad memories come back to haunt him. He tries to get out of the shower but he slips and grabs the shower’s thermostat, turning the water to freezing cold. « SHIT! » He hates to cuss but the situation allows it for once. His body starts shaking. The cold water and the darkness surrounding him remind him of the crash. No, he can’t think about this. Not now. He has to get out of here. He has to- He is in the plane again. Millions of tons of water crush him. He tries to breathe but water seeps in his nose and he is unable to spit it out. He feels the coldness feeling his body, reaching as deep as his soul. He feels every single cell freezing. Half conscious of his actions, Steve pushes the shower’s door. He catches his towel. He has to turn the light on. But it’s too dark, and he is so cold. Too weak to support him, his legs give way. He falls on the tiles and can’t seem to stand up again. Totally petrified, he rolls up into a ball and starts crying. He doesn’t want to be strong anymore. He only want to be protected. His wound hurts, and his current position doesn’t make it any better. He is so tired. He doesn’t know how he managed to hold everything for so long. Now that everything comes back to him, it’s as though nothing can save me now. He just stays there, crying silently.
There it is, the very last chapter of my first book. I really hope you enjoyed it. I'm fully aware that it is far from perfect but this is hiw i imagined it and i'm quite happy about it. There will be another book like this one but right to change a little bit, i'm working on a new story, a Romanogers one, that will be longer than this one (about 15 chapters). I don't know when i'll be able to give it to you (as i just started writing it) but it's on the way!
They enter the room. The door closes…only to better reopen 3 seconds later, literally exploding under Steve's power.
She closes her eyes. Tears start forming at the corner of her eyes. For maybe three minutes, she doesn’t speak, keeping her eyes closed and breathing slowly. Steve takes her hand, trying to vehicular some calm. Opening her eyes again, she stares at Steve. Then suddenly, the virtual armor she had built breaks and reveals a broken expression. Her voice trembling, she squeezes Steve’s hand, to give herself courage.
« I am not quite sure. » Steve claims, bitting his lips. « Maybe you should answer me again, just to be sure that I’ll understand this time. »
“Can you manage to stun one of them while Nat and I deal with the other two?” Steve asked, his head down looking like he was studying the display before them.
Steve chuckled, he knew that twins would be a lot to ask for and really he would be satisfied with one baby, but he couldn’t get the image of both him and Tony holding a baby in their arms, tiny little new borns with scrunched up faces, big dark eyes, and impossibly tiny hands that looked like they belonged on dolls.
“No, no no no, not now, please, just hold on!” Real fear was filling Tony now, he’d been scared before but now he was terrified, he was going into labour in a Hydra base surrounded by enemies and was completely alone.
This doctor performed a vivisection on Peter while he was alive and conscious, he would have certainly killed him had Tony not arrived on the scene when he did. While Tony was getting Peter off the gurney he’d been strapped to, Dr Curien set off a self-destruct which resulted in the destruction of the factory, many deaths, and injuries.
While this might seem like a dream come true to some, in reality it wasn’t so much fun. Gorging on junk food didn’t help Peter stay full or provide him with enough nutrition to properly fuel his bodies new demands. So he sat down with Bruce to work out a high protein, calcium, and complex carbohydrate rich diet plan to help him feel satisfied and give him all the nutrients that he needed.
With the suit on he was able to make short work of the thugs and the reinforcements that came running at the noise, once he was done with them, allowing one to escape since he threw down his gun and admitted that he hated working for such weird people, Tony got Natasha and Clint out of their bindings and the two helped themselves to the guns that were laying on the ground.
“Neither have I.” Steve said, “So, we’ll learn together.” He stepped forward his body towering over Tony but instead of making the Omega feel crowded he felt safe and protected, “I don’t care about scars, it’s just skin, discoloured skin, and this?” He gently placed his fingers on the arc reactor, not putting any weight on it just touching it, “This is a symbol of your strength, your ingenuity. You were in an impossible situation and you survived, you created this and used it to live and defeat your enemies, you should be proud of it not ashamed. Your body looks fine to me, I know they we are all our own worst critics when it comes to our appearances, but you really do look perfectly fine to me.
Zach also promised to draw a picture of himself in costume for Peter the following day and gave him an extra long hug before going to bed.
With the rogues off their hands Rhodey and Vision went back to the hotel finding all but Bucky, Deadpool, and Clint asleep. The three of them were playing poker and cheating.
“What!” Steve looked up sharply and yelled out a warning to Clint, but it was too late, both men were already falling through the air crashing down into the sea.
Opening the window to his bedroom Peter looked out into the City. It was fine night, the air cool but not cold and there was no rain. The drop was rather terrifying and Peter had to steal himself as he climbed out onto the ledge. Taking a deep breathe he balanced himself before he stood up and reached out to place his hands on the wall, and fired the web fluid onto the wall. It affixed to the wall and Peter tugged on it hard to check before he trusted his weight onto it.
It was said to coldly, sounded so clinical that it made Steve sick to his stomach, his arms which had been lose at his sides wrapped about Tony’s waist and pulled him in closer, pulling the Omega flush against his chest.
Tony was growing to hate sleeping. Every time he closed his eyes he would be back there, in the battle of New York, going through the portal to the other side of the universe, the arse end of the universe where there was nothing. No life, no stars, no planets, nothing but cold empty space with the Chitauri waiting to strike.
“Victoria Campbell. She has taken a leave of absence for reasons unspecified, however I have, and I hope you will forgive me for the breech of her privacy. Followed a trail of her credit cards and it seems she is heading for Las Vegas and has made the purchase of wedding gown.”
“Indeed Ma’am. I was recruited by Erskine. But I never performed on stage. After the serum I completed training and Officers training. I was sent to the front as Lieutenant Rogers, earning the rank of Captain, when I rescued several prisoners of war and brought back information on the Red Skull’s plans. At that point a special unit of highly skilled soldiers was formed, to be lead by myself, under the command of General Philips with the task of fighting Hydra.”
At nearly three years old she was walking and chattering, having grown into a happy and energetic toddler who was thoroughly spoiled by all of the Avengers.
To round the day off Tony took them all out to an Italian restaurant where they had the best spaghetti and meatballs that Steve had ever tasted in his life.
The job they had doing manual labour for cash in hand wasn’t much, but it covered the rent and brought grocery’s, including a pound of plums a week.
“You do, and you have been acting as her Father for these past few months, so its only natural that she would call you that.”
“I’ll try very hard not to.” Tony agreed, narrowing his eyes as Rhodey helped himself to a pancake and began to share it with Zach.
“Pizza and burgers.” Steve agreed going into the lift, “We’ll hit some obstacles on the run, jump some benches and such, get your agility working too. If you enjoy it maybe, we can make a regular session a few times a week.”
Fury made a noise in his throat. Tony mentally gave himself a point. “You know exactly what. But Dr. Feranza has good things to say about Captain Rogers’s progress, so this is me
Not with mirth, or joy, or even anger. They were hot coals burning out of his face, and Steve couldn’t stop staring, even as sunspots burst in front of his eyes.
“It’s not proof,” he countered. “Quite the opposite. Fate can’t exist when every scenario is already happening, simultaneously, intermingled with each other, crossing over and breaking apart, but unable to touch for more than a millisecond. Fate is just a cipher for when your consciousness stumbles from one decision to the next, while all of its alternatives continue to spin out but are invisible to you. Choice is the only meaning we have, and it's the only way we can step from one thread onto the next.”
Inside the Soul Stone, Natasha half stood, half floated, swathed in a sketch of the uniform she had worn when she died. Her face and hair were clean. She looked young.
She didn’t look anything like before anymore. Her hair was longer, in a shade Steve had never seen before: deep amber, variegated like a tiger’s eye. She wore a white high-collared shirt and white leather trousers stuffed into white boots. Her cuffs were stained to the elbow with luminous orange-gold.
“For now,” Helen said. “But until we understand what exactly Tony exists as right now, there aren’t any guarantees.”
The call disconnected, Tony already dialling another on his cell. “Pepper? I’m gonna need you to cancel all my appointments for the next 48 hours. No, it’s actually important. Really, really. Like, not even supermodels are involved. Pretty please? Okay. I’m leaving now, bye!”
The guy in the doorway is wiry, sweaty, and generally a wreck. He also looks like he maybe stepped out of some sort of gay porn for welders. Steve didn’t even know he had a thing for that.
“I had wondered about that thing in his chest,” Steve said, later. “He was quiet about it, so I didn’t ask, but I knew no one else had one, it couldn’t exactly be normal, and—“
He stepped back and regarded her. Even with a mask more specific than the standard faceplate, she couldn’t get a read on him, which she hated. “No,” he said at last. “No, I don’t mind. I’m glad you did.”
Bucky exhales. “At least for now.” He looks up at Steve with infuriating doe eyes. “At least talk to him.”
“Oh, good job,” Tony snapped, “I was just about to stop caring, and now I am absolutely getting in that room that you are standing so protectively in front of, don’t think I don’t see you doing that. I own this boat, and you’re going to open that door, which I also own, before I drown you in litigators that, whether I win the suit or not, I guarantee will cost you millions in cleanup. Millions that will mean nothing to me.”
“You did a good,” she confirmed. She looked back through the house to the open back door, where Captain Rogers sat on the stoop, looking back at them. She gave him a small wave with her free hand, and then turned back to Strange. “That man,” she said, shaking her head.
“Don’t hate me ‘cause I’m beautiful,” Tony retorts, but then Bucky’s extricating him from the rest of the suit, and he crumples, letting Bucky take a portion of his weight.
Tony made a noise in his throat. “Worst comes to worst,” he said, and from somewhere in the suit produced a card, “You call me. I’m not doubting your abilities, Captain, but you know as well as I do that you’re a stranger in a strange land here, and frankly, I’ve got enough on my conscience without losing a national treasure to The Man, too.”
“Yeah,” Steve nodded. He became aware that his throat had gone all tight. He hadn’t talked about Bucky to anyone, not in this century. “I couldn’t reach him.” He took a breath, and then another. “I dream about that too, sometimes. But no matter what, on a train or in the water, it’s always cold.”
Pepper took a sip from her glass. “That sounds like a good choice. He’s a good man.” She looked up at him. “And then what will you do?”
was superseding everything else in his mind, the anxiety and temptation and displacement and grief all falling away.
“You’re sure you don’t want to wait?” Pepper asked, touching his elbow. “We’d be okay, if you need more time to work this out.”
Tony pecks him on the lips, a barely there, yet unmistakable gesture of intent. Steve shuts up abruptly.
“I haven’t heard you lecture anyone like that, ‘sides me,” Steve comments. “You got a soft spot for Tony, or something?”
“Okay, Tony,” Steve said. Tony thought he could hear him settle back, probably into bed. Like everything else, he tucked that image carefully away, out of reach.
“Did you ask her to? Or did Stark?” Clint asked. He raised his hands when Rhodes and Pepper both glared at him. “I’m just wondering.”
For the anon prompt: "Bucky/Tony; when Tony gets scraped up a little, he whines about it endlessly. When he's seriously injured, he retreats to his lab and locks everyone out until. Bucky's caught on."
not right,” Sam said, voice tight. His shoulder came up under Steve’s on his opposite side, steadying him. Bucky shared a look with him over Steve's limp head, the sentiment clear between them:
“You’re trapped?” He supposed it was a plausible dream setting. Steve had felt trapped, back there in Germany. All glass and nowhere safe to turn.
He grinned. He knew it didn’t show on his face, but he hoped Helen understood anyway. Maybe he wouldn’t get to use it quite yet, but the possibility of a real way out was the best news he’d heard in weeks. “Hold back on you? Never.”
Bucky didn’t even jump; he must have known Steve was waking up for ages. “Hey, punk.” He put down the book he was reading. “That was some stunt you pulled.”
There’s a man in the lobby, standing out like a sore thumb among all the blue-shirts in an impeccable three-piece English suit. There is even a proper black umbrella hooked into the crook of his elbow.
Five years to let go. And Steve was still holding on tightly. Though to what, he couldn’t quite tell anymore. It seemed like it was changing all the time.
He was close enough to touch, but he wasn’t—didn’t—breathe. The arc reactor in his chest glowed the same as always. But the suit was
He didn’t like not being able to see Tony’s face, either. Tony masked his expression with the best of them, but what he felt still leaked out the sides sometimes, and that was a rarity in the company Steve had been in the past couple of weeks. Tony, it was clear, cared about what happened to Steve—though precisely why, Steve didn’t know.
“You’re American,” Steve Rogers whispered, a look of consternation on his worryingly pale face. “I—where are we?”
“Extract him into what?” the Ancient One countered. “His body is ash, Captain, per his wishes. Moreover, he will need to gain mastery of himself in each of the Stones, not just the Mind Stone, before he can be extracted in one piece. I can see that he’s begun this process, but he has far to go.”
“What, other than die a swift and hopefully painless death?” Tony answers lightly, “I don’t know, enjoy the sights. Be glad you’re not all there with me. Watch things go boom, because seriously, I have never been quite so satisfied as when I saw that damn mothership explode.”
Tony snickered, and then coughed. Plaster dust flew up around them both. Bucky allowed himself, after a long second of debate, to relax slightly into the pull of gravity, leaving them pressed together all along one side.
“Shut the fuck up,” he says, trying to ignore how he’s basically chest-to-chest with Tony, and chest-to-back with Steve. “Shut up, both of you, you’ve had this exact same argument at least three times since I’ve been with the team, which means that this has been going on for months. You,” he shoves a finger in Tony’s bemused face, “Need to be clearer. We’ll take you at your word, you don’t need to explain your entire rationale, but you need to at least give us one good reason to change a plan, none of this dramatic unpredictable labyrinthine martyrdom crap.
“–so I figured I’d let the internet do the talking this time. Did you know that I had to divert a satellite just to get you a wi-fi signal in here? SHIELD is kind of really intent on you only hearing what they want you to hear.”
“See you ‘round, Captain,” he said, blasting upwards in a gust of heated air, “Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.”
“Any time, Pepper, you know that,” Rhodes said, and pulled her into a hug that she returned easily and hard, tucking her face in his shoulder. Steve averted his eyes, and was startled when, after a minute, he felt a kiss land on his cheek as well.
“Provided we actually can break cover,” Tony pointed out. “Fucking shoddy architecture. Who builds an evil lair without a sense of where to put load-bearing pillars?”
“You brought this upon yourself,” Natasha says, clapping him hard on the shoulder while Tony disappears downstairs without saying a word. They’ve only just come back from a massive tiff with HYDRA, in which Tony managed to get both a subway platform and half the Hudson dumped on him, and that can mean nothing good, in Bucky’s book. He sighs.
Steve snorted. “I’m thinking,” he started, then shook his head. “I think I’m just enjoying the moment.” He finally turned, and drank in the sight of Tony, whole and human, reactor in his chest aglow, all of him
He hadn’t moved away, which just barely gave Steve the courage to reach out and touch his knee. “Why solidification?” he asked. “You seem pretty solid to me.”
Steve didn’t miss a trick. He scowled and let a breath out. “Kind of hard to tell. She was more of an impression than an actual, you know,
“I think that the mistakes you made were forgivable, in intent if not necessarily in result. I’m not sure if you could say the same for me.” Steve exhaled hard.
He wasn’t complete. Steve wanted to touch him the same way he had in that dream in the Berlin conference room, the skin of the tender inside of his knee so warm beneath the twill of his trousers. And of course he knew that Pepper did too, which was far worse, because she had a right to it, and he didn’t.
“We’re still running down leads,” she reported, interrupting a strange dream Steve had been having about tunnels and pools of ink. “Stopped one troublemaker, but there’s no doubt others. Your universe is harder to get to from some places than others, so we’re trying to concentrate on the likeliest candidates.”
He nodded, once hard, and then with two shaky, smaller bobs, like he was trying to convince himself. Then he looked back at Steve. “Trust me?” he asked.
“I guess,” he said cautiously. “I wasn’t really conscious for the first long while. It’s confusing. I don’t really understand it, but it was all—I was in a lot of different pieces, and it took me a long time to...make thoughts again?”
They pulled it down on the front lawn, sparks flying, Steve with his gauntleted fist around its throat. “What do you want?” he asked.
“You’re right, it is, it’s ridiculously difficult, Steven, it requires constant monitoring of ambient conditions and instant responses. Thankfully, I am a genius, and therefore my intellect is more than a match for this conundrum. So, what I’ve done is…”
“Yeah, but we know that everything important from here, will end up over there,” Tony said, gesturing first to himself, then to the Cradle. “And we know it’ll go over in the right order. Those are the two most important things. All the rest’ll be window dressing.”
Being whole was comforting. Tony no longer slipped and slid along uncharted corridors between his disparate strengths and weaknesses, trying to formulate words and ideas through some sort of sick combination of Pictionary and Scrabble. But stealing the life force out of Steve Rogers like some unholy parasite? Was distressing beyond measure.
Steve felt wrong-footed, staying behind with the people who Tony was closest to. Who had never stood against him, never left him.
don’t believe in the human soul. Personal hypothesis is that I’m a collection of previously unidentified femto-particles held together by string theory-adjacent tertiary forces. Whatever it is, it gives me the ability to think, it can travel from one thing to another, and having too much of it inside Steve nearly killed him, so please, help me figure this out.”
She frowned, but nodded all the same. When she was gone, Steve let out a breath. “I nearly called her Aunt Peggy,” he said. “That would have been
Tony pursed his lips, and threw a glance in Steve’s direction. “Fury’s gonna want to bring you in to SHIELD,” he said. “He’ll probably say it’s for security purposes. And maybe he’ll want you in medical, see if you’re really all right.”
“I don’t trust you,” he repeats, and as Tony’s face falls infinitesimally, adds, “But I could, if you let me work with you on this.”
The quinjet is stealthy, but when you land it in the middle of Bumfuck Nowhere, Kansas, Tony supposes it’s kind of a big deal.
Tony was at his ex-CEO best, in a sharkskin suit that probably cost more than Steve’s entire wardrobe, and he was standing like a challenge, hands in his pockets and shoulders square with his head cocked to one side. Bucky, in contrast, was pale, bruised, underfed and unshaven, and still in scrubs (much to his disgust). He was holding himself with as much military discipline as he could from the hospital bed, but it didn’t do much for his shrunken appearance.
Clint shook his head. “Stubborn.” He huffed out a breath that could have maybe passed for laughter, under different circumstances. “Always so goddamn stubborn.” He looked Tony up and down. “I guess even if she’d wanted to come back, she wouldn’t have been able to, huh? No suit to put her in.”
When he came to, it was to Bucky with his feet propped up on the end of the bed, sitting in a squashy armchair he’d pulled out from the corner of the room. Steve’s suitcase had been on it, before. He wondered where it was, now.
Steve blinks rapidly. “Uh. Six. In the morning. On a Sunday? That’s actually more of a problem than the noise.”
“What?” Steve snapped, feeling absurd about addressing a voice in his head and a floating green gem, but that’s all he’s got, so. “We’re out of danger, you made your sacrifice and fixed everything, there’s no reason for you to die now, not when we have this chance!”
“On cleanup?” Steve suggests, looking around at the wreckage. They’re all stuffed to the gills with shawarma, and it’s kind of a great feeling, but Clint’s pretty sure that if he tries to do more than get into a bed and lie down he’s going to just do himself more damage, so yeah.
they bonded with the stuff the Stones were made of, and those bonded with what the nanosuit was made of, so it all got mixed up and became more or less inextricable.”
Steve makes a strangled noise into his pillow, and then drags his head out from under the duvet. Rolls out of bed and makes sure he has pants on, and also maybe a shirt, before staggering out of the apartment and to the door across. He doesn’t even know if his knocking is going to get heard over the jackhammer, and over the…is that singing?
“Ah,” Obie had said, grimacing. “That one, I’m afraid, we can’t do anything about. Howard was adamant.”
“Yes, I can see that.” She raised one hand, and the Time Stone floated up out of the case. “Did you think on what I asked you to?”
“Yeah, I know. Just, hang on.” Steve pried himself off the couch, where he’d been spending most days since getting back and waking up the first time, and made his way over to the kitchen closet. The art portfolio was still in there, leaned up on the floor below the shelves of pots and pans. “You should take this with you.”
“He has the internet now, and a tablet with the safe search turned off,” Tony replied. “Either he’s all set, or he’s doomed.”
The heart monitor seemed oddly loud in the silence after she left. Tony filled the void by walking up to the table they had the Captain on, boots clanking. He flipped up the face plate and regarded the figure in front of him.
, but it was hard going, there was nothing to hold onto except a vague sense of familiarity and loss, and–
She sighed. “Give me a few days, I have to arrange transport for my equipment, unless you intend to come to me.”
Steve started to nod, and then caught himself. “You should take some equipment with you, then,” he said.
“Water will help,” Helen said, handing over a bottle from one of the storage shelves. Steve cracked it open and offered it. Tony nodded, and let Steve get a few swallows down his throat. His eyes were wide, shocked.
Tony sat back in frustration, and then startled himself by trying to wipe a hand over his face and having it scrape unpleasantly, metal against metal.
“There’s no need to get snippy, missy.” Tony grumbled scowling at the eggs, which had become stuck to the pan. Thankfully he used a spatula to scrape them from the pan before going to get another couple of eggs from the fridge, snagging the toast from mid air as he passed Toby, the toast was slightly singed, but edible, which for Toby was a miracle.
Meaning he had something to hide elsewhere. Damn AI, too smart for his own good, probably going to go Skynet and take over the world.
“Speak to him or start a fight with him?” Sam snapped, “Because that’s whats happened, and I think we can all safely say that you lost.”
“Hell no. You and Zach and swim when we head back to the beach, but no way are either of you risking your necks diving off the cliff.” Tony said, “And don’t think I won’t tie you both to the trees if you try.”
Tony had been heart broken when Peter had died, it had taken Steve over an hour to pry Tony’s arms from Peter’s body, the Billionaire just hadn’t been able to let him go.
As he forced himself upright, clutching his jaw and rubbing the rapidly swelling area, Rogers saw his alternate self kneeling besides Tony.
Tony tried to argue for several more minutes but eventually gave in and agreed to Steve being with him. He then began to help Bruce set up the monitors while Steve and Jarvis got a bed ready for Tony to sleep in that night and every night until they got a reading of the nightmares.
“We did,” Steve said, “We felt it was better for them due to their age. We didn’t want them to be singled out or persecuted, nor have unfair pressure on them because they have these abilities. Yes they have them, but they are still children, they have a lot of growing and learning to do before they will be ready to decide what they want to do with their lives. They might decide to be super heroes, they might decide to be Doctors, or lawyers, or teachers, they might join the armed forces, they might become acters or singers. They might chose to do anything and it is important that they have that choice. Their freedom is what we wanted to protect.”
A week later, Steve stood in the common room waiting for Tony, he was wearing a pair of jeans that Natasha had picked out for him, along with a crisp white button shirt that was tucked into the waist band of his jeans, showing his trim waist, and a new suit jacket in grey/blue, with his hair styled and gelled into place by Natasha and a musky cologne scenting his skin, he was as ready for the date as he would ever be.
The phone was answered but Natasha didn’t speak, for a moment Steve considered not speaking himself, then figured that if he did so she would hang up and they wouldn’t get anywhere, and Tony had said these phones couldn’t be traced so while he’d be letting potential enemies know he was alive, (Which he probably already knew) he wouldn’t be giving out their location.
Peter was practically sobbing when Tony and Steve finally arrived in the hospital room, the night staff arguing with them that they couldn’t just go and discharge Peter and couldn’t disturb him either.
Like Steve, Bruce was just as impressed and overwhelmed by the floor he’d been given, insisting on at least being allowed to cook dinner by way of thanking Tony, since the Billionaire wouldn’t accept anything else.
Steve had his back to the camera and was concentrating on making breakfast, while Tony negotiated with Zach, convincing the stubborn four-year-old to eat porridge and blueberries rather than blueberry pancakes.
Without Tony there would be no reason for him to exist, not beyond avenging Tony’s death, which Steve swore he would do. He would hunt down the person or persons responsible for Tony’s death and he would make them beg for death before the end.
“I’m gonna see Osborn burning on pyre for this shit.” Natasha growled observing as the mangled, mutilated bodies were taken away.
“Putting the safety of everyone on this ship at risk is not funny.” Steve paused, “No offence Doctor Banner.”
“He’s enhanced.” Steve said, praying Tony wouldn’t be too angry at him, “He was bitten by a radio active spider a few weeks ago, it’s given him accelerated healing, heightened senses, strength, and speed.”
“Oh don’t you go getting uppity with me, buster. You can save that sass for Barton, if you bug me I’m gonna turn you into a hot plate, then all you’ll be doing is warming pre-cooked food. You’ll have no free will or abilities to fry things, you’ll just sit there on a table with plates on top of your for the rest of your life.”
If anyone here was a Villain, it was Tony Stark. He should be the one on the run, not they. He should be made to pay for his crimes. Not an innocent child like Wanda, or an abused prisoner of War like Bucky.
“I have a heart condition.” Tony said, “And I would sooner take a bath in sulphuric acid than pound the pavements at Ass-o-clock in the morning!”
Tony tried to shrug it off, made smartass comments about being called The Merchant of Death, but Steve knew him well enough to know that it cut him inside. Knew that it hurt this Tony, as much as it had his Tony.
“Hell no, uniforms suck.” Tony said, then at Steve’s pointed cough added, “Unless they are military uniforms and hot people.”
Finally he came upon it and with shaking hands opened the door, finding the Doctors wallet, car keys, and mobile phone. He took the phone out and paused, toying with the idea of trying to find which car the Doctor drove, but doubted he’d be able to get behind the wheel and even if he did he was in no condition to drive and there was no way there wouldn’t be some kind of security check when it came to getting out of this shithole.
Pepper was waiting for him and Steve in the common area along with the rest of the team. Upon Steve and Tony’s arrival Clint snorted and held out his hand to Sam, who grumbled and got his wallet out of his pocket, taking out a few notes which he handed to Clint.
“I don’t!” He blurted, halting Steve’s progress in finding his shirt, “I don’t just want one night, I want more too.”
Curien frowned then doubled over as a blinding pain spread through his abdomen, “Wha…” He grunted, clutching his stomach which felt wet,
Steve’s eyes widened and he began to stammer at Zach’s question, managing to fudge an explanation about having met a few Sperm Whales while he’d been under the ice in the arctic.
“Don’t you walk away from me Stark, we’re not done yet!” he barked into the Billionaire’s face, “I know you’re arrogant enough to think that everyone should bow to your whim, but I am not one of you minions who’s awe struck enough to think that you can walk on water. You will show me some damn respect and look at me when I am talking to you!”
“Thanks.” Steve said, happy to have something else to do with his time that would be both practical and useful. This was his home now, this time, he needed to learn about it and how the world had changed, the good, the bad, and the ugly, he needed to know everything, not just the cliff notes that Shield or possibly Hydra had seen fit to give him.
Rhodes in the war machine armour was blasted out of the air and sent skidding across the ground gauging a deep track into the ground as he went.
Tony could hardly believe the response that came from the press after his and Rogers’ altercation during the gala. He had expected to be made the villain of the piece as always seemed to happen, but it seemed that the exact opposite was happening.
“Romanoff, Barton, keep a watch out for any further incoming trouble.” Rhodey shouted down to them, “Whoever sent the drones might have foot soldiers.”
It was also great fun playing with Peter. The boy loved Lego and Tony had a whale of a time building Lego structures with him, spending a fortune on the sets so they could build all sorts together.
“It’ll be hard to do that as a fugitive.” The War Machine armour said which served to wipe the smile from Steve’s face.
A collected yes followed and Thor volunteered to go with Sam and help him carry the drinks back along with snacks.
“I’m afraid there has been an incident involving the Avengers.” The principal said, “I have not been given the details only that one of your parents has been seriously injured and Miss Potts is on her way to collect you and then your Brother and take you to a hospital in Prague where they are being treated.”
An image came up of a news paper headline Howard and Maria Stark Die in Car Crash. Tony inhaled sharply a hand going to his mouth.
“Look at how your reacting, Stark.” Natasha said, with her usual icy demeaner, “You’re incapable of being mature or rational about anything. Besides,” She shrugged, “It was a very long time ago, and you were never close with your parents…” She was cut off as a repulser blast was shot at her, catching her left arm with a glancing blow as she moved out of the line of fire just in time to avoid getting her arm blown off.
Winter had never had sweets before and adored the taste of pastry, cakes, and cookies, getting positively gleeful at the taste of chocolate!
Tony shrugged, “I didn’t say they weren’t, but it doesn’t mean you can’t have the support of other heroes does it? And should Thanos attack, we will be ready for him, and with any luck prevent what happened on Steve’s world from happening here.”
Clint was armed with dummy arrows that had dull tips which wouldn’t do any damage to those they struck, Steve had a light weight mock up of his shield which like Clint’s arrows wouldn’t do any damage. Tony’s repulsors were set to only make an impressive light show and light stun those they hit, Sam and Natasha were armed with paint balls and Thor would only be striking the ground with Mjolnir not any of his team mates.
Peter suffered a gun shot to his thigh, deep lacerations to his torso, severed ribs which were cut through, extreme blood loss and smoke inhalation. He is now in hospital and is also expected to make a full recovery thanks to his enhanced healing.”
Norman had clearly been prewarned that Curien was going to betray him, he’d had enough time to empty his bank accounts and transfer the funds to swiss and cayman accounts so they couldn’t be frozen, he’d also dropped his Son off at a distant relatives before he’d fled, showing that he’d had ample time to prepare.
“Are you kidding, I wouldn’t miss my Nephew’s birthday party for the world.” Pepper exclaimed, “What have you got him?”
Pierce smiled, “Excellent, and ironic. Captain America being destroyed by his best friend, the Winter Soldier.”
“Yeah but you’re special.” For the third time that day Steve wished he could sew his lips together. He was thankfully saved from having to awkwardly try to explain himself by Zach calling for Tony to help him win a stuffed bear from a crane machine.
“Like Christmas, but with, you know, more me.” Tony replied as he flew back up to the tower where Pepper, Happy, Peter, and Zach were waiting for him, sparkling apple cider and pizza all ready to celebrate, which was of course when shield started calling.
He was sorry about having to leave the sceptre behind but he had a great deal of technology from it now and the scientists had all the data recorded from it, they didn’t need the actual sceptre anymore and from experiments done he knew that very few humans could be enhanced from it, after all only the Maximoff’s had survived.
For New Year Tony had taken Steve away to Paris for a few days for some "Adult time" which had a bordering on adolescence Peter, and a now Five year old Zach making kissy faces at them and laughing themselves silly.
“Frankly Sir, I do not have the time for such things, when I am caring for the dysfunctional siblings I already have, and I believe Cathy wants your attention as she is attempting smoke signals with steam again.”
Clint was in a pair of swimming trunks that were so bright that actually made the eyes hurt, he also had several inflatable toys and hamper full of beer.
He startled, as did Tony when there came a loud thump against the closed bedroom door, “MAMMA!” Zach yelled from the other side.
Tony and Steve explained everything they’d found out about Hydra and Zola, what he’d told them about Tony’s parents and about Bucky, the also explained about the letter Steve had from his future self and how they’d been told to go to Camp Leheigh and had uncovered all of this.
“Well. That was fun.” Tony said, dusting himself off, “Lets never do that again anytime soon, okay people?”
They wasted no time in gathering the forces of every superhero on earth so that they were ready when Thanos attacked, however Tony, Steve, Peter, and Strange all ended up on Titan battling Thanos after being taken away by Ebony Maw in Thanos’ ship.
“Hey!” Tony teased, “Don’t ask things like that, you’ll give the poor man a complex about crows feet and his weight!” This earned a few laughs, and Steve even made a show of asked Tony if he should start considering botox injection and hair dye for the grey!
He flinched when Steve pressed a cup of hot chocolate into his hands and looked up with a frown, “Shouldn’t you be calling for people in white coats, getting me committed or something?” Tony asked, his voice harsh and tone defeated. It was clear that if Steve did this then Tony wouldn’t fight him, wouldn’t stop him at all, the desire to fight had gone out of Tony, he was apathetic, and it was a horrible thing to see. Steve never wanted to see it again.
“And I have a firm handle of the situation.” Steve added breaking into laughter again. He thrust harder into Tony, stroking and teasing the Omega’s cock, bringing Tony to the point of release and then denied him, holding him right on the brink as he slowed down his thrusts and took his time to bring himself to completion, making Tony whine, complain, beg, and mewl before he finally allowed Tony to come.
“We’re not.” Steve admitted, “But….I’m thinking about talking to him about it, maybe starting to try. What do you think?” While he said it casually, Steve was actually very anxious for Peter’s answer, he wanted to know if Peter thought he’d be a good Dad, if Peter thought him and Tony having a Pup of their own would be a good thing.
Steve carefully reached out and slid his free hand under Tony using it to lift him a little so he could free his other arm easier.
It seemed the Billionaire was still in hospital in Prague and would be remaining there for several weeks before he would be fit enough to travel back to the US. His children were going back though, were heading to New York and would come under the care of Pepper Potts and the Avengers that were going back with them.
“But imagine beings just as powerful as Hulk and Abomination that could be controlled.” Curien said, “Imagine an entire platoon of Captain America’s all saluting Ross, imagine soldiers able to breathe under water, able to survive weeks without food and water, to cross the harshest of terrains without fatigue. Imagine soldiers able to secrete poison from their fingernails, imagine soldiers bred with all of your intellect and all of Captain America’s strength, so they cannot just outmatch enemies in strength but also out think them. Why would Iron Man and protective armours be needed if their skin was bullet proof? If radiation had no effect on them? What army could withstand them, what country could hold out against such a force?”
“Now you two toddlers are finished can we watch the movie?” Natasha asked as if she hadn’t been egging the pair on.
“Don’t you even think about leaving me.” Tony ordered him, his voice tight as he held Steve’s hand, “You had the nerve to get under my skin, to come into my life and turn it all upside down and make me feel things for you, you don’t get to do that and just fucking die on me, you hear me Rogers?
He never mentioned these glimpses to the Handlers, he knew what it would mean if he did, more time in the chair, more pain, more feeling like his brain was being turned to scrambled eggs.
“War Machine Rox with an X.” Rhodey said with a sigh and who ever he was interrogating/threatening laughed at the password as did Tony.
“I don’t think so.” Bruce typed as Peter began to examine his sides, looking for the start of extra limbs.
Steve huffed a laugh, they would still have to work on Tony’s communication skills when it came to his emotions, but for right now things were good and that was enough for him.
Steve sat by Peter’s bedside, he wanted to go and see Tony but knew that Tony would want him to stay with Peter, would rather he be there than with the Billionaire right now. Bruce and Natasha chose to stay with Tony while Sam and Thor stayed with Steve. Clint kindly headed back to the tower to tell Pepper of the news and help her with Zach when he woke up, also to explain things to Ned and MJ’s parents.
Teasing aside Tony was going to personally take Peter to get a new tux fitted for the prom and get him a crash course in dancing from Natasha so that Peter’s teenage clumsiness didn’t embarrass him at the prom and he could impress MJ with his dancing skills.
“You’ll have to thank Jonny when we get home.” Steve teased, then turned serious, “The doctors want to keep you here for a while longer, a few weeks so your back heals, or the bones fuse or something,” He rubbed the back of his neck not looking entirely certain of the correct terminology, “Once they say you can be released we’ll get you home and…”
When he felt he could speak again Tony cupped the back of Zach’s head and lifted his Son so they were eye to eye, “I swear I am never letting you out of my sight again.” He said. “You and your Brother are never leaving my lab again. When we get home, you two will live there now.”
“No, of course not.” Steve said, “And you have to inform the authorities. This is a double murder, not reporting it means that Hydra will get away with what they have done, and if you don’t report it, you could be charged with concealing the crime.”
Zach never hid anything, if there was something on his mind he would just blurt it out. Peter on the other hand was old enough to bottle up things and he was doing so now.
Steve frowned at the choice of words, “You… do you see this as a one night thing?” He asked slowly, “Or as something lasting.” Tony opened his mouth to speak but Steve cut him off, “Because I want more with you than one night of fun. I don’t think less of people who have one night stands but I do not have them myself. I prefer something that lasts.”
“Leave him alone you bitch!” Steve bellowed as wrestled with Roger’s, despite their difference in build they were fairly well matched in strength and Roger’s was ten years younger than Steve which did give him an edge that he was taking advantage of.
“Send a dozen into space to monitor activity in the solar system and keep watch for interplanetary threats.” Jarvis ordered. “Half a dozen are to stand guard in Stark Tower, and half a dozen shall accompany me to Prague where we shall project Sir and his family.”
“You’re leaving?” Harley asked looking through the window to Tony, “What about Iron Man and Jarvis?”
“Fair enough.” The host agreed and smoothed out his suit, sitting up a little straighter as silence was called with the warning that the camera would soon be on.
No, this was wrong, completely wrong. His heat had only been a month ago, even if he had conceived he couldn’t be this pregnant already. He whimpered as he felt more movement from within his body. He couldn’t believe this but couldn’t deny it either, he was carrying a baby, was close to delivering it if the size of his belly was anything to go by.
The discussion regarding Pups was never raised, Obie didn’t want them and Tony, well, despite his intentions not to become dependant knew he drank too much to be healthy, he wouldn’t be a good Mother, and so he kept up with contraceptives, taking after heat pills and using a douche to make sure he didn’t conceive.
“Why would you not give him coffee?” Zach innocently asked. Tony chose to ignore that in favour of glaring at Steve, who took his sweet time in finishing his coffee before finally helping to free Tony from the sand.
Neither Tony or Steve were armed. They could be, having been in the UN building, but both took up fighting stances when Wanda aimed a shot at Rhodey.
Tony couldn’t help but to lean into Steve’s touch, to feel the walls he’d had built up crumble when he was met with that honest gaze. “How can I not?” He whispered, “How can you even bear to touch me?”
“Which doesn’t change the fact that you had no business getting involved.” Her Mother sharply said, “You should never have sent Peter into that building, you should have gone to Mr Stark with your suspicions not tried to take the law into your own hands.”
He gave Peter the room closest to his bedroom and Zach’s nursery, insisting on Peter choosing how he wanted it decorated and having all of Peter’s possessions brought from his Uncle and Aunt’s apartment and put in the room.
“How soon can you have it ready?” Fury asked, “We’re days away from the hellicarriers being launched.”
Tony was certain that they were the ones to tip Norman off, he couldn’t yet prove it though, no their involvement with Norman. Right now they had Curien’s word and speculation which was not enough to act on.
It didn’t take long for Zach to fall asleep. He’d had a very stressful day and it taken a lot out of him; Tony and Peter had only gotten three pages into his bedtime story when he’d fallen asleep.
Steve’s face turned crimson while Tony looked like he was either going to have an embolism or murder Deadpool.
Natasha and Clint Met Steve at the hospital as soon as they got to the city, Bruce picked them up at the airport and drove them there, Sam was still on his flight back from Washington and would join them as soon as he could.
“I am.” Natasha said with a very convincing twang, “I’m looking for maternity, my Sister’s just given birth, or she is giving birth, I don’t know. The baby was due last week but didn’t arrive and I drove all the way from LA to be here and she wasn’t as her home and the neighbours said she was in the hospital and I can’t find the right floor!”
“Rhodey.” Rogers called out, “Thank God you’re here. Stark has gone mad…” He broke off as Rhodey’s face plate retracted and he was met with the Colonel’s furious gaze.
Steve watched the interaction as he set the bacon frying and prepared the pancake batter, a smile playing on his lips, as Tony chatted to Lily easily, the baby giggling and cooing at him, just as she did with his Tony. It was a bittersweet moment, but Steve determinedly pushed aside his grief and focused on his daughters happiness. At the end of the day, he knew that Tony would have wanted her to be happy, for him to be happy, so he would do his best to build himself a life here and make the best of it.
“Okay then.” Tony said, “J, hold the fort, or what’s left of it, we’re heading to Long Island and picking up Shwarma on the way.”
Thor hadn’t really any experience with such injuries and had been feeling rather useless when it came to helping Tony beyond trying to keep his spirits up, so it was good for him to have something to do that made him feel useful.
The Plaza had done them proud with the decoration of the reception room. It was decked out in the Rainbow colours of LGBTQA, but done tastefully and elegantly, rather than looking gaudy or tacky as was always a risk when mixing bright and primary colours.
There was also the risk of Hydra, now they knew Peter and Zach were enhanced they would be targets for the deranged Nazis, especially since they were the Sons of Stark, one of Hydra’s sworn enemies.
Peter took the tablet back from Tony and snickered, “They’ve also got #IronMom trending and #SuperParents.”
But there was no guarantee that he would, his Son was in danger now, Tony wasn’t just angry anymore, he was going to be beyond anger and fear, his instinct as a Mother would be fuelling him now and he would stop at nothing until he had Zach back in his arms.
He was still grieving for his Tony, he still wore his wedding ring, still dreamed of him, of their time together, of his death, which had him awakening with tears on his face. But he was starting to have feelings for this Tony.
“We’ll have to do some digging into Oscorp.” MJ said, “I’ll get back on the Dark Web and see if I can get back into the files, if not Oscorp then into Osborn’s personal files.”
The kittens had a whale of a time as the wrapping paper and boxes were set aside, this gave them new toys to play with, they charged through the wrapping paper and jumped in and out of the boxes, scrabbling around in them and curling up to sleep.
Sitting back on the grass and staring at the blood on his hands the anger slowly began to seep away from Peter, and he looked in horror at the battered and bloody form of Harry.
Peter bit the inside of his lips looking guiltily at Tony, his shoulders slumped and he ducked his head quietly making his way to his room wishing he could take back his words.
“A deal.” Curien repeated, “In return for immunity I will testify against Norman Osborn. He knew all about it, he was the one who hired me, the one who had Justin Hammer fit that self destruct, and he was the one who shot me.” Curien waved his remaining arm, “Go and get your superiors and I will tell them everything they want to know.”
Shutting his eyes tight Peter buried his head under the pillows and tried to shut out the noise, tried to block out the beeping machines, the rise and fall of respirators, the hum of electronics, the scrape of feet on tiles, the opening and shutting of doors.
