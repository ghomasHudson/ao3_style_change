Tony shook his head, but it appeared Steve wasn't looking at him; his eyes seemed fixed on a point somewhere left of Tony's head. "No," Tony said, "the bricks you demolished were a recent addition, they were crap. No offence, Cap, but I don't think even you can just kick the concrete walls down."
Tony: You know, I was about to say 'yes, I lied in order to fuck with you head', but I thought you might take me seriously even for a moment, and you know what, I'm not that much of an asshole.
“Yep,” Tony said as if didn’t matter one bit, although they both knew better. He paused for a moment, then allowed: “Also, in between doing fun things, we can talk a little too. If you absolutely insist.”
"That's off the record, lieutenant" said Steve with a small smile. "At least that's what I think Fury's going to do." A beat. "Don't tell anyone?"
"Steve, this is Peter Parker, my genius intern, here for the weekend," Tony told Steve with relish. "He invented an anti-magnetic inverter for his high school science fair. Peter, this is Steve Rogers, aka Captain America, whom you've already met, if you remember. He was... bluer and somewhat more flaggy at the time."
"We're the most logical choice," Steve interjects. "Now, I know you said you don't know any real facts, but whatever you can remember would be helpful..."
“So, you’ll call?” Steve had asked earlier, with a small smile. They were still in the cabin. Leaving the cabin behind felt a bit like one tiny, happy world ending.
Don't you insult my music player!" After a moment of struggling with entangled cable, he extended one earphone to Tony while he put the other to his own ear. "Wait a sec. I wanted to play this for you anyway."
Tony, living and breathing beside me, snapping at me, joking and casually flirting with me more and more as we lived on and talked and hung out with an unprecedented ease. We cuddled a lot, towards the end of that period. We used to regularly fall asleep on the couch and wake up hours later, bleary and achy, wrapped around each other more often then not. He seemed perfectly happy and comfortable with that state of affairs, so I was not going to pressure him into going any further, obviously. But I was going insane with desire. It had almost disappeared for a while, brought low with my processing of grief, but then it came back, and with a vengeance. Just his hand on my arm or a comfy bump of knee against knee made me light up. His constant physical closeness made me burn for him. Having him there and not being able to touch him the way I wanted to, to run my hands all over him, feel the geography of every muscle under my fingertips, not being able to make him truly mine and kiss him into oblivion – it drove me crazy. But I just sat there and breathed through it and enjoyed every second of that torture, because how could I not enjoy cuddling with Tony?
Steve had said, and he'd sounded uptight, he knew that. Just like he did when he said something he felt
The point is that the coin may land so that either heads or tails are showing, any number of times in any number of universes. Random? Perhaps not. I do not know.
"I'm sorry to lose a competent engineer, Stark," Jacobson said. "But I know pilots are what we need right now. If you ever change your mind, there will always be a place for you in the tech."
"What the fuck are you doing here on foot, what the fuck were you thinking, why the fuck were you walking over the frozen lake," Tony was muttering as he hugged Steve to himself with all his might, flying towards the cottage at top speed. He didn't have time to say anything else. Already they were on the porch, and then he was helping Steve through the door. And as they stepped in, Steve suddenly went limp in Tony's arms and collapsed.
– sharply – and then Tony leaned his knees into Steve's under the table, and Steve's own legs straight out refused to obey. He wouldn't have been able to stand up at that moment even if he wanted to. (He didn't.)
Yeah, fine. He was just getting too invested in The Game. The important thing was to focus on the work.
Tony lifts his hand from Steve's stomach then and shows him his index and middle finger. "That's easy," he says, as the pressure on Steve's prostate eases even more, so that it's barely there, an unfulfilled promise of deep pleasure that makes Steve want to scream. "All you need to do is ask me to put two fingers in you. Again, I won't be gentle."
He waved his hand impatiently. "I know how it works." He was sitting still, but he was drumming his fingers on the bench between us in a frantic rhythm. "And, in your timeline, we lost? Won? What?"
The mission gets more interesting after they identify their mark at the insanely boring convention and sneak after him towards the back rooms of the venue. Who makes weapon deals at a third rate dentist convention anyway? They do manage to plant bugs and listen in on the bargaining, and in the end Tony hacks into the phone of one of the participants and manages to steal a good deal of the blueprints, easily separating the real ones from red herrings, which is why Fury wanted him on the job in the first place.
, Tony thought without much gusto, mostly pissed at himself. If nothing else, he'd forced the stupid impulses down and he could think clearly. He didn't do anything stupid either, for once.
"Steve... How come you're here?" he asked me then, and while it didn't sound like a reproach, I heard an echo of it in my own conscience. I understood what he meant.
"I suppose I tricked myself into getting to this point, so that I'd have to tell you. I won't back off now." He tried on a smile. It didn't quite work, so he went on. "So, when I said Steve and I were just sort of friends with benefits, occasionally?"
Around 5 p.m. or so something triggered the alarm around the perimeter. He'd set it up to detect large animals and, well, people. The property was private, and while he didn't mind hikers in general, the lake house was enough out of the way that rarely anyone ended up there without intending to; and Tony generally liked to drop by and take a look. So call him overprotective. It was the house where his daughter was supposed to be growing up. 'Simple living' was more Pepper's dream than his, and even though he'd truly come to love some aspects of it, he still missed having, say, an elaborate security system. If a bear started sniffing around the porch where Morgan could be playing, he liked to know about it. This went even more for people.
, even here, even under these circumstances, if only he thought Steve actually wanted him. He meets Steve's eyes, and what he sees there catches him by surprise. Steve's pupils are shiny, dilated. His breathing faster. His gaze keeps flicking down towards Tony's body. "You kind of like the idea, don't you?" Tony thinks, and is surprised at the sound of his own voice actually saying the words. He wants to backtrack, backpedal, but Steve swallows visibly and nods.
"This wasn't supposed to be possible," he said. "Strange said there was only one future in which..."
Avengers, the original Avengers – are together again, a family again. And they are, it took time but they are. Or it might be the fact that, one snap of big green fingers later, the world is made whole again, if for a minute. But it's not just that. Tony asks, but she refuses to acknowledge anything. Steve just observes. She reminds him of himself, once Erskine was done with him and it suddenly felt like he had the means of doing what he thought he was meant to, in the world.
"And, er, tossing platforms at people", Steve said, in a feeble attempt at humor that couldn't mask his enormous relief, at least from Tony. Steve held out his hand, and Peter shook it.
"It's not just that," he admits, still not turning around. And then, more forcefully: "Dammit, Steve, you
Steve says nothing. It would be nice if he expressed some sort of disagreement, but whatever, Tony probably should have thought about that before he started turning everything he touched to shit.
, big guy," Tony coaxed him. "You need to pass the physical as well." Tony pretended to give  him a critical once-over, even though the blanket was in the way. "You're kind of flabby."
"You know the air's freshest this early in the morning." He grinned at his private joke that wasn't really his any longer.
We got to talking. She did offer one last boon to an old almost-friend. Alone, I was inconsequential enough; my going off apparently changed noting significant. I'm actually happy about the fact. These days I'm mostly content to watch the world roll by.
We do have a lot  of conversations, over the next days and weeks. This time around I find myself talking even more than he does on many occasions. Tony is pressing me for every detail, as if something depends on it. It's as if he's curious to find out as much as he can about this different life he could have had. About me and him, about our marriage. The how, the why, even the
"I'm just tired," he whispers, because he doesn't have the strength to speak up. He's in Tony's arms, and Tony's arms are the most beautiful place in all the galaxies, and if that morning someone told him he'd end up in Tony's arms, even for a moment, Steve would have told them they were crazy.
"He's been badly depressed ever since Pepper died," Natasha tells me two days after my arrival. We are sipping beer on the roof of Tony's mansion. (My Tony and I lived in it briefly, but Tony hated it. Too much memories, he used to say.) Tony has fallen asleep after lunch, and we are talking alone. "It's not as if it was a particularly happy marriage either."
, deeply asleep, had a vision of drawing Tony. This was where it got weird (no, wait, everything was weird
He placed the tip of his cock at the rim of Tony’s hole and pushed. Hard. And with a flash of pain, the head was in, stretching, burning. Steve was
"Yes," Tony whispered in answer to his own thoughts, "I would." The abrupt realization almost made him stumble.
"If... you are not sure..." Steve falters for the first time. He's been so level-headed and matter-of-fact ever since Tony found him. In him it spells contained desperation, Tony thinks, but he isn't sure. He can't read him. He needs to learn to. Then Steve gets his act together again and in a very controlled voice he says: "If you don't, I need you to tell me now. If you need to think, do. But please don't say yes and then..."
This was how Peter Quill found him: both elbows on the railing (mildly wet, oh well), eyes closed. Tony heard the balcony door behind him, probably someone sneaking out to have a smoke (and
Just like I couldn't imagine a world in which Steve didn't love his Tony. I wanted to believe it. Maybe we were just subjective, and blind, but it actually made me smile.
I didn't think you'd..." He flailed for a way to go on, but the words were deserting one by one, leaving him naked and alone. He tried again. "But now I thought you'd maybe..." He blew out a frustrated breath. "Whatever you want is fine," he finished lamely.
"What's with the hands, Cap?" Tony muttered. Belatedly, Steve seemed to realize this was weird. He stepped back and cleared his throat uncomfortably.
They are thick – and bulky – and it's almost scary to think of both of them ripping in and out of his hole, but the thought sends a dark shudder of want down his spine. "Right," he whispers, because his throat feels dry and a little bit like broken glass.
“Anything,” Steve said at once. But by the way he was looming over Tony, resting on his elbows, staring down at him with a look that bordered on predatory, it wasn’t so hard to figure him out.
(He was still angry, of course he was, Steve figured. Only, he didn't seem angry via texts, but maybe it's easier not to sound angry when you just joke and send funnies). (Maybe he wasn't angry any longer. Maybe he just didn't have anything to say to Steve.)
, with an alien army rushing through. No, we didn't invite them in. No, we didn't somehow attract them. We weren't even a team back then, we barely knew each other. We came together because we were needed, and because there wasn't anyone else. Two scientists, a soldier, two government agents... We... [mutters to self] Listen, the Avengers, the present and former Avengers, we always... We fought for
Tony: Seriously, though, are you all right? When did that happen? After Madripoor? Did something happen there?
Steve blinked at him over the coffee cup Tony had handed him as soon as he’d set a foot out the bedroom door. “Well,” Steve began blearily at the same time, “I don’t remember the last time I slept this long or this... What?”
Tony blinked. Sighed. Decided that, if he was ever going to tell the truth about this night, he could do it now, with Rhodey, or not at all. "I... just told Steve I loved him, pretty much." He thought this over for a moment. "Yep. I'm probably very much not okay."
Tony shook his head. Having Steve here filled him with strange longing: he wasn't sure for what exactly.
On the ship, Tony banters with Strange. He banters with little Peter. He almost banters with the bad guy.
Steve's ass is next, the process the same. Gently at first, than a tad more firmly, hotly. Over too soon, though, while he still wants more, can take a
"Do you want a paracetamol? I found some in the bathroom." That was the only thing he could think to say.
? I know you want to fight the good fight, we've already established that, but if you fool around with Stark for a bit, who's going to find you out? Here? Who's going to report you? Who's going to
"You and I, together? Come on, what could possibly stop us?" Tony said this lightly, but it left a new scratch in the old hurt. Too much, too soon. He sighed. "We should probably go to sleep. The plan for now is, if someone comes in, we kick their ass. Tomorrow we think of a way to open the goddamn door."
On the third day, Tony found inspiration in Bruce's words from the first morning. He recruited Scott, Luke and Quentin Quint to come with. The idea was to go to the gym for an hour, get really sweaty and gross, then go for a run around the tech deck as a group;
Tony had tried to imagine this meeting a million times. He had thought that, after all the messages and confessions, it would go easier. They would fall into each other’s arms, unable to control their passion and... It was pretty decent jerking off material, really, of late. But now it was as if a transparent plastic wall was between them, like something was stopping them from getting close, from touching. Steve felt further away than when there was an ocean between them.
worked, and as Fury related how they had been relatively close and how they caught the signal and just shot over here with full 5.5G , whatever that meant – Tony's knees disappeared away from Steve's. Still, that
"My foot's fine, forget my foot," Tony retorted. The fluttering in his chest was an unwelcome companion. He'd never admit that he liked being fussed over. He wanted for Steve to keep fussing over him while he himself unsuccessfully batted it off. As an impulse, it was completely despicable. "But, eh, thanks," he said, sounding forced even to his own ears.
Burning in his face wasn't unpleasant, actually. It made him forget the creeping cold in his bones. And he felt a certain cheekiness that hadn't visited him for a longest time. It made him feel alive and warm again, all of a sudden. Perfectly serious, without changing his expression in the least, he said: "You know, that's exactly what I meant."
Steve sighed. "Fine," he said. He was next to the nearest viper now. The craft seemed in a pitiful condition. Salvageable or not, though – Steve couldn't tell.
wasn't there – everything would fall into place, but that never happens, and it just gets progressively worse."
He was hot from standing so close to the fire, sweating uncomfortably. The flames danced  furiously in the fireplace, making shadows cavort around the room, casting Steve's face in unnatural red light, making the angles sharper, making him look older and almost gaunt. The sight nearly broke Tony's heart in an instant somehow. It became clear to him now that Steve had been ruminating on Tony's words all this time, torturing himself. And Tony had... meant them. At that moment in time. For all of five angry, hurt, over-exhausted minutes before he fainted.
Tony: I think it's going to get split in two, actually. Hell, I'm going to give a birth to Athena. I have a mother and father of all headaches in the world, and I think I'm going to throw up, and I just took the meds, and they should kick in soon, I hope they do. But I was just sitting here, thinking how I should have known sooner, and I can't shake that feeling, that's all.
In the beginning – this new beginning – there is a bit of a celebration and a bit of mourning, all wrapped into one; there are friends reunited, and there are reconciliations; hands shaken, hugs exchanged, glasses clinking against glasses. There are even some speeches. As the evening progresses, these get less boring, albeit a bit slurred. Because, in this instant that is a beginning and also an end, there is a big party taking place at the Avengers Compound.
, I'm not going to bother you with that again, like ever. So let's just forget the whole mess, okay? No biggie. Er, see you later."
Tony: Oh, I'm not going to be mean to you now, after everything. If that's what you thought. And we did work together, and hell, Steve, yeah, it felt good.
. Just at the beginning of his hole, stretching the rim stingingly, deliciously. He heard Steve suck in air, then he relaxed the digits a little. Now they were side by side, inside Tony’s hole; Steve waited for him to adjust, but too soon, too vigorously, he pushed in; Tony welcomed it. He welcomed the ache and the stretching and the sharp burning. He could feel his cock jump, jerk, once, twice under Steve’s hand. And the clump in his throat was too dry for words, and he could feel the flood within him start, rise, but he pushed it down, down; not
now – that had to be the stim talking. He wondered vaguely if Steve would insist on soup again, and a tiny part of him sort of hoped he would.
it not pleasant, and by now he's so desperate to feel anything at all right there that he cold weep. It goes on until his skin is burning, until Steve starts moaning in earnest, and then Tony is back at playing with his nipples, now working on his neglected right one. Taps and caresses of the tails. The warmth building, accumulating. He wakes his nerves up incredibly slowly, incredibly patiently; softness, softness, and then, all of a sudden, a sharp sting on the slightly sore left breast makes Steve jerk. Tony is smirking at him.
He knew he managed to hurt Tony. A moment of satisfaction was wild, rampant, but then a cold, black, poisonous regret settled in and nested in his heart like a snake. He had not only been rude to his friend, but he had done everything he could to hurt the person he cared about the most.
Tony didn't want him to, either. It's absolutely best for all that he's accepted the position as the leader of the newly founded West Coast Avengers. He has a plane ticket for tonight and everything. The party was just a short stop on his way.
"If you're well enough to banter, you're well enough to drink tea," Tony decided, semi-grateful for an excuse to get out from under the blanket, now that Steve didn't need his body hit so desperately anymore. He scrambled out. "Friday," he snapped while he grabbed his bathrobe that was draped over the back of a nearby chair. "Scan his life functions again."
Tony rests his temple against the top of Steve's head, just for a moment, and to Steve it's worth a million words.
The Red Line, the borders of the known space. Once you ended up on the other side, your chances of finding a way back home were next to nonexistent. And this is where they were now.
As we were nearing the establishment, I looked around, noticing the small differences from the New York I knew – here a store front was painted green, not blue; over there, a fancy flower shop stood in place of a bookshop where I'd bought something once. And  since I was paying so much attention to the details and not the big picture, I only then realized where we were.
. But to do that, he needed to actually challenge himself, otherwise he'd keep thinking about Rogers. "Wanna do full G today?" he asked, his fingertips hovering above the slide. Full gravity slamming you into your seat as you sped, a real simulation of what it would be like to fly. Tony felt anticipation build.
Steve sounds so vehement that Tony thinks about his answer for a moment. Tries to be as honest as possible. That's all they have left, after all. "Maybe it needs to be actualized in order to
His words had broken the spell. They had dispersed the cloud of quiet companionship that had somehow descended upon them.
, essentially, the same person. If I believed in souls that's how I would call it, but I don't know what I believe in any more; I
(I'd always loved the way Tony shook hands). I covered it with my other palm, tenderly, like a little bird. It wasn't the way a friend would comfort you, but it wasn't exactly the way a couple would hold hands, either. It was somewhere in between, and I it was a perfect reflection our relationship at that moment in time.
Natasha raised a hand, as if to pat him on the arm, then let it fall. "Is this what we are doing now?" she asked softly. "You complaining that you don't know how to teach and me trying to be reassuring? Really?"
It was like a dam had disappeared and Tony's words could flow freely again. "Okay, so maybe I didn't think it was cute back then, but now, in retrospect..." He snorted. "Nah, still not cute. Listen, though, I'm always jealous, I understand jealousy. I'm probably the triple world champion. But Steve?"
Here," he says. He'd been kneeling to the side of Steve, at the level with Steve's hips, so that he'd have good access to Steve's ass.
Even in his mind, Steve can't imagine them saying anything real to each other. Just an endless string of unfinished sentences that they, by some miracle, still understand. If he breathes wrong, the magic might disappear.
"I don't do much in the way of cooking now that I'm, ah, on my own, but I like to keep a soup pot going. Perpetual soup – that's how Pepper... well, that's how Pepper used to call it."
Tony just shrugs. "Oh please. Everyone always complains about seats. You know what would have been actually conspicuous?
Tony: She heard about Madripoor on TV, figured I'd be a wreck over it, called to ask me if I was okay.
Tony: But honestly, I've been at it for months, and in the beginning I wouldn't have told you  to save my life, and then I felt a little weird for not telling you, but I didn't want to deal with any of it. And I didn't have all that much. Or, I did, but it all felt disjointed. I didn't have anything real before Natasha pointed me into the right direction, and then everything fell into place very nicely.
"Do you actually know what I will do next?" I asked, spurred on by a bout of curiosity and something Bruce had told me about her.
And then Steve's mouth is on his own, and without a second's thought, Tony parts his lips, and suddenly he tastes Steve's tongue, hungry and hot, and the kiss vibrates with wanting, and it feels
Steve, more often than not – always happy to spend time with him in an unobtrusive, easily deniable way. Could Steve really have been so blind? He remembered the way Tony rushed to his side, today, and the way he jumped in front of him when his SHIELD buddies started pulling guns at him. Oh.
"So, the music or the people?" he heard himself ask, and his tone was light, playful. Maybe there was nothing wrong with just fun, after all.
Steve takes a moment to untangle what Tony is saying. Mostly because he can't believe it, Tony figures. He frowns. "You are failing at... not loving me."
They rented two sets of gear, and in the end Steve took to snowboarding like fish to water. Well. One big, golden fish that was used to having two legs but now had only one tail to steer with. Unlearning something is generally harder than learning, but Steve laughed and laughed whenever he tried to separate his legs but couldn’t, and ended up on his ass. And Tony watched him laugh and enjoyed showing him tricks and seeing him progress inhumanly fast after the few initial mistakes, and he couldn’t tear his eyes away.
they hadn’t let go of each other. But now, as the thought crossed his mind in a bout of panic, Tony wriggled his hand free and pretended to adjust his glove. The panic itself had been way too exciting.
And while Tony explained how, for years and years, he couldn't make contact and today he happened to think of how to make an amplifier for his comm. that
At witch point Tony shared a knowing look with Steve and inconspicuously rolled his eyes at him, perhaps conveying more than he meant to. Steve's smile became so incredibly sad for a second that it practically wasn't a smile at all.
Tony: I'm hearing echoes of Natasha in certain turns of phrase, but mostly it's all his own cute, isn't it?
Tony: So, basically, that's not a bad advice, since I realized I didn't give you any last night, and you asked for some.
You are not supposed to get hard just because someone said hey, are you? It was silly, really. Not fifteen minutes ago, when they were with the others, the two of them seeking and avoiding each other’s eyes across the room, Tony had been completely fine. But now the anticipation was burning in his stomach and his breath was getting shallow.
"So, er, hi. Tony," Steve said, and then, with a certain defensive note, "I'm... I thought I'd go volunteer in a soup kitchen." As if he expected a negative reaction to this statement. As if he cared.
Tony: Yeah, this may be totally unfounded, but I've a feeling we can work it out if we actually try.
"But your people didn't let you know about the electricity problem and the possible pipe problem?" Steve asked.
"It's red, though," Steve said with a most beautiful, tiny smile and he pushed the sweater into Tony's unresisting arms. "I think you'd look
And now Steve is staring at Tony's smooth face weirdly, and Tony has an irresistible urge to say something caustic.
Steve had come looking for Chief Petty Officer Jacobson because he didn't know what to think of Stark and he couldn't stop puzzling over him. He had a vague idea that consulting Stark's previous head of departmeent might help. But, upon not finding Darryl in his office, Steve had followed his gut and ended up in the illicit tech bar.
Tony: Besides, I do talk to T'Challa occasionally; and he's not hiding his opinions, if nothing else. And I can put two and two together. I'm not stupid.
either," he added with a sharp little laugh that sounded almost painful, "I just..." For a second, Tony Stark looked almost lost for words, which was not what Steve would have expected from him, but then again, he was nothing like Steve had imagined him to be, either way.
"Yeah," Steve said on his way out (because he could think of no excuse to stay). "I knew that." He closed the door softly behind him and gave it a conciliatory look.
Steve didn't move away. He stood there like a rock. He must have his own gravity, Tony figured, if he's affecting me like this. But Steve's hand rose, stayed motionless mid-air for a second, then, moved forward jerkily. His knuckles brushed against Tony's chest for a merest instant. Right where the arc reactor used to be. It was the weirdest of caresses and it made Tony's heart jump painfully, wanting more,
The ship had no surveillance systems. The ship had no normal comms. No network. All of that had been removed during the refurbishment. As the war had shown, the Cylons – intelligent machines that they were – could infiltrate those systems. They acted as a super-virus, and no firewalls helped. The human race was now forced to use old, outdated equipment, immune to the enemy infection.
Tony: I'm just supposed to make it clear that whatever you lot are doing has got nothing to do with the Avengers any longer. Yay. And not take any questions.
Tony fumbled for something inane to say, a comment to divert attention, to mask his eyes that had gone wide with worry.
Tony gave an amalgam of a nod and a shrug. Either it was nonchalance incarnate or he looked like he was having a fit. No way to know, really. He very much wasn't staring at Steve's bare chest.
I was cradling my mug to my chest, apparently. I only became aware of it because of the way he was looking at me, and it. It was one of our old mugs, from the set that we had back in the Tower. They were made of cheap white ceramics, with our symbols on them – a set of six mugs, sent to us by a fan. They were kind of tacky, and we all loved them.
This is in reference to the famous last words of Captain Lawrence Oates, an Antarctic explorer, who said "I am just going outside and may be some time" before going out to die. I figure this is famous enough, but in case it's more of a culturally specific thing than I thought, there:)
The slant of Steve's shoulders, when Tony finds him, spells quiet despondency. His limp hair is plastered to his head. The rain is streaking into his neckline. It's almost over the top, the way the weather fits his apparent mood. (Hey nature, your penchant for drama impresses no one.) His tee is soaked through. It's pure white, and not what Steve had on last night. Tony thinks it must be his own t-shirt Steve found in Tony's bedroom this morning. It's too small for him, obviously, but he's never learned his own size, anyway.
Some days we quarrel so much I don't even know why he tolerates me around. Still, he starts tinkering with things he thinks I'd like, so I know he's happy I'm here, even if it doesn't always look like it.
Near the beginning  of the mutual-ignoring-fest, Natasha had cornered him and asked, so casually Tony thought she might explode with off-handedness:
Volstagg's," someone threw in dryly. It was the guy Tony knew as Falcon. "Volstagg's not dead. He's over in the medbay."
Trying to suppress a smile and failing, Steve wondered if he should be a little offended at this, but it was just Tony being Tony, and at this point Steve wanted to see him so much that it hurt in his chest.
From time to time Tony would grow sad thinking about Morgan, and he still tinkered with his interquantum travel ideas. There would be crazy spurts of work; he wouldn't raise his head for days, but he always came to the same conclusion. It couldn't work. There had to be one problem he couldn't solve, I suppose. We did talk to Strange and the Ancient One (who was still alive in our timeline), and they outright refused to help and told us not to ask again. I thought it was probably for the better, but I still hurt for Tony.
This was the day after, colored by headache and nausea and his mouth tasting like cardboard and ash and shit.
"Not that one!" both Valkyrie and Barton crowed shrilly as Banner approached an unoccupied bed. Tony rolled his eyes. They could at least try to think of something else. These people were going to give him a headache, but, if nothing else, they were marginally more lively than all the Daves and Gales.
"Could I borrow the clothes now?" Steve called out from the living room. "I keep tripping over the blanket."
"You don't owe me anything, Tony," Steve added, and he sounded infinitely sad, and now Tony wanted to bang his head against the window he was leaning his forehead against.
"He's alive. I'm going back in." He was chatting to Tony, idly and unnecessarily. He knew he should stop, but where was the harm, really? Tony was waiting for Hope to arrive with the parts, anyway, and...
, Rogers would say very seriously when he was happy with Tony's progress. Things like that. He even made something resembling a joke from time to time, but overall it seemed to Tony he was generally happier to get these conversations over with as soon as possible. There was something about Tony that made the man agitated, and for better or worse, Tony was absolutely unable to let it go.
I kissed her on the cheek before I left. Both from me and from my Tony, to his friend and the mother of his kid. "Thanks," I said gently, "Pep."
I'm getting old, just like everyone else (only slower). Otherwise, I would have heard Tony approach. "I'm here to claim the surrogate best friend privileges," he says to Natasha, coming over, not even sparing me a look. He's got his mask back on. It's not his media mask, it's his
was looking. Still, when his gaze strayed towards Rogers, Cap started. He looked away too quickly. Blinked a few times. Hurriedly started pretending he was doing something else.
said thank fuck. Thor showed at my door up yesterday and wouldn't shut up about something called Kyrumption. Apparently that's..."
Steve had the decency to laugh, the fiend. "She's always going to love you best, Tony," he said then, which somehow  made everything better, Tony was stunned to realize. "You're a wonderful Dad. I know you are. I can see it."
, Steve wants Tony to ask. He can practically feel the question in Tony's eyes. And yet Tony says noting, and Steve says nothing, and the silence reigns once more.
Just urgency and pressing need. As he heard Steve groan again, this time lower, hoarser, he felt his hand fill with wetness, and he let himself go too; the waves of bittersweet release passed too soon. He leaned his cheek against Steve's back as he came and for a moment he sobbed without tears. It was, he figured a bit later, probably just relief.
Tony gave him a look. It was a speculative look. Tony knew Steve had recognized it for what it was because he fell silent and waited, very patiently.
half was way more pathetic and he wouldn't disclose it to save his life; so what he settled for saying was: "Yeah, okay, Cap." It was really, really lame, and he'd managed to forget Steve had asked him not to call him 'Cap' too. This big hole that had grown in his stomach because of the man's painful absence couldn't really be considered
He stepped back. He never meant to impose on Tony, and he must be doing it right now. That was why Tony had gone so still all of a sudden. That must be it.
Flying economy class is a deeply scandalous experience in itself. The tiny sandwiches are apparently produced from cardboard and glue, but at least there are drinks. Tony decides to make things more fun (for himself) by ordering for Steve before the man manages to open his mouth. "Red wine for me – something romantic, please – and a coffee and a glass of apple juice for the stunner over here." He waves an unconcerned hand in Steve's direction, then he winks at the flight attendant, and in stage whisper he adds: "Lover is lightweight, you see."
He'd considered going down to meet Steve – to be completely honest, he'd considered standing by the main gate of the Compound since 5 in the morning. That would be the time he'd woken up, had he actually slept; he suspected that the short, tossy, turny experience should probably be called something else and not sleep. Besides, eagerness was one thing. Doing a Pluto the Dog impersonation by the gate was quite another.
a few guards, but Tony made a quick work of them from a distance. The lab personnel themselves seemed far less eager to fight. Steve and Tony tied them up; the best the two of them could do right now was to inform the Sokovian police once they were out, but they couldn't leave before inspecting and possibly destroying some of the files. There was an interesting amount of data there, connected to the winter soldiers left dead in Siberia, where the drug that had been used on Steve clearly originated. In the end, they left a ton of other logs pointing to illegal activities, but they destroyed, deleted and smashed everything that had to do with Steve and the supersoldier project in general. Tony swiped some data and saved it on a memory stick.
Steve snorted in a most infuriating way. "That's not exactly how I'd put it, although I'd say there was some beating taking place there, yes."
Steve was standing to him. He himself was leaning against the wall to take the weight off his bad foot, and now Steve was there, in front of him, all big and looming. Warm and near. Something in Tony stirred, a tiny rebellious fire of
and do what needed doing on one side. A misplaced wish to impress the man on the other – to show him he could be useful, show him he was good at this. Prove he wasn't just an arrogant asshole.
"I told you this was going to be on my terms or it won't happen," Tony says, and it's so inflectionless, sounds so mechanic that Steve can't be sure there's Tony in the armor at all. What if it's just a remotely controlled shell?
I knew exactly what he was talking about. Tony had told me – my Tony, I mean, the one from my own timeline.
Tony missed Rhodey. Missed the familiarity and easy companionship of many years. Bruce could be almost equally sarcastic, though – just as obstinate and infuriating, as well, when you got past the mild surface; that was one of the reasons Tony liked him.
Tony: Rogers, you giant dick. Do you know how many worst case scenarios I can develop in a matter of seconds when you're not replying. You're hitting me in my worst fears and it's just not fair.
The building was a maze of corridors and staircases. They had no floor plans and, not knowing the terrain, they were at a tactical disadvantage. They had almost been caught between two enemy groups once already. At this point, barricading themselves somewhere and trying to hold out until the possible help arrived seemed the only option.
"Oh, shit," Tony jumped up. "The cinnamon rolls." He ran over to the oven, saving them at the last moment.
"There's a diner that's always open nearby," Steve said. "I could... ah. I wouldn't mind keeping you company. If you want? Otherwise they'll serve you eyeballs and hooves and rotten vegetables because you're an Outsider."
called for questions. Not food, not air; answers were what he needed. Answers and plans. He realized he was back to fully alert, and on the verge of starting to fidget.
BARTON: So... Hi, I guess? I'm Clint Barton. Hawkeye. The guy with the bow and arrows you barely remember seeing. Except in Madripoor, everyone saw me in Madripoor. This is exactly what I wanted to make a statement about. I'm an international fugitive, a former agent of SHIELD, a former Avenger. A lot of former things, then. I'm only talking on behalf of myself, not on behalf of my... my friends. Maybe a little bit on their behalf too, but primarily for myself. I'm doing this because... Plainly, because I think people have the right to know the truth about what happened, and you are not getting it anywhere else right now.
"Under your feet now, I know, I know," Tony said impatiently. "Here, I'm going to... There, I tweaked it, the results should start showing in a few minutes."
, because before, when he wanted to seduce someone, he'd pretty much flirt shamelessly and brazenly until it worked or blew up in his face. This required far more strategy. If you put all the infinitesimal clues together, you'd get one big fat zero, give and take a few decimals. He wasn't
Tony shrugged, as if that was of no consequence whatsoever. "I made a fortune – once again – on this planet; then I lost a fortune; now I'm in Timely." He never mentioned anything about his change of heart, about melting down his guns, nothing. He could go on and on about that to Steve, once he got into his cups, but now, not a word. Perhaps it didn't matter to him as much as Steve thought it did, after all. Perhaps nothing here did. Tony's real life had come calling.
And Peter got hold of Tony's hand and pulled him in – not really, but a little bit, so that they were standing closer to each other, the earphone cord pulling them together; and than even closer than that. And Peter started moving, urging Tony to do the same.
"Er," Tony says, "I know I'm a bit too much. No, scratch that. I was being an ass. I need to apologize."
Approximately at this time someone else entered the diner. At the sound of the door, Steve snatched his hand back as if Tony's was burning hot. Then he shot an apologetic look at Tony.
"But like this," Tony adds quickly, still holding his fingers up, parallel to one another. "Side by side." Which is even worse – it's way worse. Steve isn't sure he could take it at all, like that. "And you ask – no, you know what, Rogers, you
"Not terrible," he says, because he doesn't want to be unfriendly, but he'll be damned if he admits he hasn't had so much fun with friends in a very, very long time. "I kind of missed certain aspects of this." He waves his hand vaguely.
. He becomes aware of Tony's left hand, then – the one that was pressed into the underside of Steve's right knee, pressing it into Steve's chest harshly. Tony lets go of the leg now and lets his whole palm ghost over Steve's cock, lighter than a fly fluttering against glass. It's so light that Steve wouldn't even feel it if he wasn't so sensitive, so highly tuned to every point of contact. And as Steve's cock twitches up to meet the palm, Tony snatches it up, so that Steve has to buck up and manages only to brush it with the tip of his cock, just for the second, which makes the burning even worse. Which is probably what Tony aimed for in the first place. His hips falling back to bed, Steve manages to shift the angle on Tony's finger, and it lands deceptively close to his sweet spot. It's more intense than ever now, he's so turned on, so high pitched, so close to the unreachable peak. Tony lets him have it for a second, two, even twists his finger for a moment so that Steve feels the friction, the pressure against his prostate, everything; but in seconds it's gone, and there's just stretch and burn, and the unfulfilled need in his cock. He's so frustrated that he yells, and Tony laughs his mechanical laugh.
"Am I going too fast for you, Rogers?" Tony asked dryly, deftly undoing the blanket and letting it slip to the floor. "Want to try casually dating for a couple of years instead?"
, but in a mostly friendly manner. "But after she died," she goes on,  "it was as if he lost the light of his life. I honestly didn't think he'd take it that badly."
They were dragging each other away; Tony couldn't rightly tell who was dragging whom. For anyone who didn't look too closely, they probably looked like two friends, walking arm in arm. Quite hurriedly, in a straight line, bumping against the dancers, not stopping to apologize – towards one of the ballroom exits. Out.
"What the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck," he chanted in his head. For a second it seemed Steve's efforts were going to pay out, he was on his stomach on the edge of the hole, the wolf getting close, barking at him.
or he was going to strangle himself with his own smile. He'd escaped onto the balcony, and thanks to the lovely Norwegian weather, it wasn't occupied. Shivers and the dampness weren't so bad, really. Just a bit of air.
"Do I make you nervous?" Tony asked, half jokingly, but not. And making Captain America nervous might have seemed like a ridiculous concept, but this was his Steve, who could cry if he was sorry, who got overwhelmed in crowds, who had as much of a public face as Tony did.
"You okay?", Tony whispered again, sliding his fingers in and out, opening him up, not ungentle but hurried. He couldn't help but rub his cock against Steve's ass, craving contact, craving
Steve gasped. This seemed to be the last straw. He parted his lips, and suddenly their press against Tony’s was hard, unrelenting, and his tongue shot into Tony’s mouth almost forcefully. Steve struggled to free his hands from between their bodies, clumsy for a second, forgetting he was supposed to let go of Tony first. And then one of his arms was somewhere around Tony’s torso, but that one was almost irrelevant, because the other hand was squeezing Tony’s ass cheek, insistently, almost to the point of pain. Then he pulled him even closer, in a jerky motion, holding Tony’s pelvis in place and pushing his own groin out. He bent his knees a little and rubbed his cock directly over Tony’s while keeping the other’s mouth shut with his own.
The conversation did open a can of worms. I had no ID and no legal status in this universe, unless being dead counted. In the end we swallowed our distaste and reached out to the reformed SHIELD; and (after some genetic testing, because, unlike Tony, they weren't about to gaze deeply into my eyes and declare it was really me) they promised to help us. In the meantime, I'd started volunteering in a soup kitchen. Tony teased me incessantly about my do-goodery (his words) and scoring points for the afterlife (also his words, but then he winced at them, so we moved on), and then declared he'd come with; he protested I spent too much time away from him and that he was bored. The very first time he tagged along, though, we got recognized. Someone took a picture, and it of course went viral. There were wildest speculations about me faking my own death and whatnot (on a battlefield, apparently, with more than a hundred witnesses, because that's how good I am at deception), and about Tony cloning me. In the end we had to hold a press conference, with Tony rambling something incomprehensible about quantum and laws of probability. He admitted to me later that it was mostly utter gibberish. Everyone nodded along sagely, though, pretending to get it. As it turned out, in a world where half the population turned to ash and came back five years later, it wasn't such a big a deal for one more person to get resurrected. We didn't mention diverging timelines and me traveling from one to another. No one would have believed
Tony: I’m not holding a grudge here, is what I'm trying to say. I just still feel like shit about it and don’t know how to stop.
Steve gave him a sharp look, compressed his lips. He too seemed to be teetering on the edge of patience. "You're untested; you've barely been through training. There is no way I'm taking a new recruit with me."  Cap wasn't used to this. He was used to having real, trained soldiers at his command, to giving orders and having them followed. Understandable, that. So was, in a way, Tony.
, Steve thought. (It was completely appropriate for the situation.) "I..." He picked up his courage; not saying anything would just make this more uncomfortable. "I thought that maybe you had fever. That's how my mom used to check." He shrugged defiantly, leaned back against the wall.
him, down to all the uneasiness and claustrophobia and vulnerability, somehow, it shot through him, making him even stiffer, even more prone to be on the defensive.
," Steve murmurs at him in that same tone of voice, damn him. Tony wants to melt on the spot. He barely manages a half-sarcastic thought of
Sitting on the edge of the desk, Captain made the piece of furniture appear even smaller than it was. It seemed his legs stretched for miles and miles. He was close, and so very human, right then. It would be so easy to just reach out and touch him.
Steve's eyes popped open and he gave Tony a long, earnest look, far more alert that Tony would have given him credit for. "No, Tony, it's all right.  It's... Oh
"Just give me a minute," Steve said, slightly overwhelmed, more with his own thoughts than with Tony's words, even though they were coming like a flood through a broken dam. "I'm trying...I."
But we are not a country, and we are not a government, and we weren't democratically elected, and we weren't sanctioned to do this. And many will say we don't have the right to do what we do. And maybe we don't. It's probably true. Is that a fucking excuse to sit back and NOT do anything? No. For me it isn't. And while I hate the state of affairs right now, and I hate that I'm apparently a criminal, and while I wonder a million times a day whether I made the right decision, I am what I am, I am where I am. Just a guy, with some training, with no super powers, doing what I can, helping where I can; it's been pointed out to me it's called vigilantism. Well, so be it, then. I... I am sorry. I liked the other way better. I
Their king had ended up in the head of an otherworldly Steve (an indigenous Steve in that place, Natasha supposed); and, to make things even more complicated, that
It seems they are back to playing with the handle, because the pommel is cold against Steve's left nipple, pressing into it, circling until it perks up, alert and sensitive. And then the coarse woven leather of the handle itself is being dragged over it, now across the areola, now against the nub itself, snagging. Softly, then harder, then softly again, until his nipple feels hot, a little sore, and it's still not enough. He wants
Despite Tony's attempts to distance himself, his insides are a dark sea, and he feels lost there, clinging to a piece of driftwood, and he can't even find himself, he's so small; if Steve doesn't look at him at least one more time, Tony will surely disappear.
"Holy fuck, Steve," he says, and it's Tony's voice, finally, finally, and he sounds tired and hoarse and just a little bit awed. "Holy
"So," Steve says, in a surprisingly calm voice, and it's really not fair that he can do that. "You seemed pretty into it, back there." And what's even less fair is putting all this on Tony, because Steve wasn't much better himself, either.
to come, if you don’t want to.” And then, since all the words up until then were pretty much the opposite of what he actually
subsiding slightly, but he still suspected he won't be able to get very far like this. He stripped the kevlar west from the largest of the unconscious enemies and tossed it to Steve. "Put that on. No arguments."
“Well my day was great. Woke up about four hours ago, fixed my hair, took a shower, the works.” Hmm, this wasn’t working. He needed to turn up the charm, get Steve comfortable. “Lesson three, make the questions personal. You really want to know the person. Ask questions you actually care about the answer to, y’know if you want more than a one-night stand.”
Stark, in the middle of doing his weekly yoga sighed, “Just what I needed while I was trying to chill. Alright,” he stood up, succumbing to his fate and making his way outside to the Guardians.
“Believe it or not this wasn’t really intentional. I didn’t know what to expect until I suddenly realized what I wanted.”
“Well shit Rogers,” Tony laughed, a hand patting Cap’s chest. It was hard to think with those hands rubbing up and down the meatiest part of his upper thighs. “Need another lesson, Champ?”
There were two shirtless men on the screen, their junk hanging out in front of Jesus and everybody. He’d been assigned to find naked human figures to draw for his art elective since their class had been canceled the week prior. Oh, he was dying, his face was pure red and his Spider-senses were going crazy from emotion. He’d gotten so used to Tony’s presence he barely set off his senses until he was too close.
“It’s my new suit. You like it? It’s made of about seventeen different things not found on Earth. It’s the same armor I’ve been working on for over four years. It’s actually almost complete.”
“I’m sure you will, take a chill pill and watch a movie or something. You’ve been going nonstop for three weeks straight. Don’t you need to sleep?”
Both of them just lay there softly moving against each other until Steve pulled back and kissed Tony gently, one hand going up and down his thigh.
Cap reached up and took off his helmet as if Stark’s comment reminded him he’d been wearing it. Softly he said, “You.”
Bucky tried to forget the day he told Steve how it was between him and Nat. He remembered the pure and genuine happiness in Steve’s voice. But Bucky had known him long enough to also notice the veiled guilt tugging at the blond’s face. Steve was his best friend, the two loved each other more than anything in the world.
“Okay, so first lesson. Take your date to a nice place to eat. It doesn’t have to be this expensive, but we both know who I am.” Tony walked into the place which was lavishly decorated with blacks, greys, and other suave colors. There was a classically European vibe to the décor, and a live band was playing something with lots of violin. The hostess was wearing an adorable black outfit and got them seated after Tony confirmed the reservation. They got placed in a comfy booth that felt very private. An unscented candle and fresh flowers decorated the middle of the table.
The party devolved into watching Peter’s favorite movie, massacring the graduation cake, singing karaoke for those brave enough. Mostly they all sat as Quill, Peter, and Thor made asses of themselves. It was a lot of fun, and a really good day when they’d had so many long ones as of late. Soon everyone but Steve, Peter, and Quill turned in. Nebula said her goodbyes and went to go sulk on the ship, having her fill of contact. Thor was asleep in an armchair, snoring with crumbs on his chest and beard.
“No,” Cap enunciated with a particularly naughty butt squeeze, giving him a look, “I mean, I know how it’s done. I’d just like to know what you want. How you want this to happen,” Steve’s eyes were nothing but calm and hungry, cheeks were rosy.
“What did you just say?” he said, rushing over to the receiver and reading the message himself. He immediately stormed over to the captain’s chair, put in some coordinates, and they blasted off without much warning.
She waved her hands, “I’ll tell you all about that later.” She grabbed a huge bag and threw it over her shoulder. “Let’s go home! I heard about New Asgard. Tell me everything.”
“I got it!" he called, smiling wide at the brunette. Nodding at him in greeting, he walked up the boardwalk and stood in front of him. The blonde noticed the other man was shorter by quite a few inches but his height wasn’t what he was focusing on. This man was stocky, fit, a little hairy, and his face was handsome, even if it seemed more aged than his own. The brunette looked kind of like he didn't belong there. Steve was actually having a bit of trouble not smirking at how out-of-place it was to see someone so short with so much anger in a calm little beach town.
Steve looked at them both and nodded. “Yeah. We are. We’re trying it out. There’ll be a second date soon.” For a man over six feet tall he sure seemed smaller when his expression was that cute. Bucky grinned.
Nebula looked at Quill and just sighed, “Thank you, Tony. Send us that date. We will be available if you need anything.” She slapped Thor aggressively in his man boob and he stood up.
She pet his hair, looking up at him and smiling carefully, “I know.” She guided his face to hers and kissed his lips once, “I love you, too.”
Tony sat up with insane hair smelling like beer and bad choices. The sound of the TV was so loud all of a sudden. He scrambled for the remote, squinting in the dark at the keys before he finally just turned the TV off.
Both Peter and Tony stopped. Peter first looked excited, squintily confused, and then suspicious. He knew for a fact Tony was still really mad at Cap. What could be so important that he’d come here and willingly talk to him? Peter wished they’d be friends again, it was obvious this separation made Tony sad. Tony and Peter needed each other more than ever, and even Peter knew that they were each other’s one true tether to life. Tony had lost his world, his Pepper. But Spider-Man knew Cap was special to him. Maybe this was a good thing? Or really really bad.
“So, after you’re done, you walk your date to their car, porch, door, stoop whatever. That’s when you can definitely tell how it all went. It’s all in the goodbye, Cap.” Tony leaned against the wall, smirking up Steve.
Later than night, two out of three Avengers were drunk enough that it was good cause just to chill in a local hotel for the night. There was some sort of festival thing happening tonight that Tony prayed wouldn’t keep him up, but he didn’t really care. Normally he’d like a good night out, but he was sort of drinking to forget Pepper leaving him for the umpteenth time…and it felt good to be in a place that was as far from home (in a sense) as possible. Tony had been overseeing that new augmented reality tech, and it only made him want to drink more. Everything made him want to drink these days.
Very much going for it, Tony leaned forward, licking the head of Cap’s member and gripping the length in a fist—god the feel of it. As he slowly pumped him, he was fascinated by how perfect and pink the tip of his cock was when his foreskin was out of the way. He licked the tip with the flat of his tongue, grinning when Cap made a quiet gasp, his leg jerking. He licked and kissed his way down the bottom base of his thick length. There, he softly massaged the other man’s balls, watching as muscles in Steve’s leg’s tensed and flexed. Licking his way back up, he took the head into his mouth and started sucking, earning him a moan-like whine from Steve. Oh, he liked that a lot, huh? When he looked up, Steve was actually looking down and to the left, biting his lip. Carefully, he took as much of Cap’s length down as he could, and slowly pulled his head back. He repeated the gesture, eyes fluttering shut at how god damned good it was for him. Steve was always so freaking clean, and due to that, the scent down here was just him and warmth.
There was a soft almost-awkward pause before Rhodey spoke again. “Nat told me this morning that Tony’s been ignoring calls.”
Steve did stop, blinking once and taking a steady breath. This conversation made him feel like he was fighting some sort of battle, it was just so personally important to him. He knew from the moment he’d hopped in his car that he was going to do more than just check on the man. He wanted him back in his life and hadn’t realized that he’d needed a push.
“Run! Run, Jesus Christ!” Quill shouted, running and weaving toward the Benatar through alien trees as a slew of shots rang past his helmet. He heard the bumblebee like buzz-hum of the laser rounds just barely missing his head. He may have been chunky, but he was fast! At least he thought so. Until all of a sudden felt immense pain and one of his legs gave out, making him fall down hard before he had a chance to zoom away on his leg jets. “Fuck! Did I just get shot in the ass?!”
Nebula knew them well enough to know that usually when their hands touched they’d smack each other around or just be stupid about it in general, but this time, the pair just looked at each other in the dim glow of the tech.
More easily this time Steve worked in a second finger until he was just thrusting two of them in and out of Tony’s ass so smoothly he wanted to whine about it. Steve’s fingers rubbed against his prostate with every little thrust, but he was a man who needed more than just fingers to really get him going, even though they felt amazing. Tony still made small sounds because it did feel nice. Steve was quiet, seeming focused. Steve must have either watched porn or done this to someone because he was widening and moving his fingers in a way that was suspiciously pleasing. With each small movement, Tony knew he was closer to having the thing he wanted most inside of him. He was grinding his hips against Steve’s urging him to pick up the pace.
“We’re okay,” Peter repeated, holding the two men to himself as he treaded water in the middle of nowhere. The water wasn’t too cold even though it was February, so at least they wouldn’t freeze to death before anyone got there. Peter’s mind was a mess, but focused on the task at hand. Keep these two alive until help came. That’ all. It was going to be okay. He couldn’t look down, he couldn’t think about how deep the water was.
“Oh,” Peter said. Tony’s suit receded back into his chest piece. He pulled his glasses out of a pocket and just shook his head slowly. Peter could tell he was worried and beyond angry, he was too, but mostly because they all could have died. And someone did, he felt so guilty he couldn’t save their stewardess. She’d been his stewardess for over three years, and he had really adored her. His mind was still trying to process the whole thing. It was rare they were ever in dark about anything. It didn’t help that the Avengers were pretty scattered right now with everyone off on important missions, so only Rhodey was able to come with Tony when they made their emergency exit.
“He left this morning looking pretty annoyed. It was pretty funny actually,” Bucky said, scratching the back of his head underneath his own messy half-bun and sauntering on up. He needed a haircut real bad. “Gonna go see what that was about.” He leaned down, kissing the top of her head and petting her temple with a thumb. She looked up at him and their eyes lingered on each other. “I love this,” he squeezed her bun.
“It’s the, well it’s my, ah new prototype suit! Ever since I learned the tech, I have been really into making it better, right? So this one is made of nanobots, but I’ve been tweaking things. It’s so fun being a real scientist Mr. Rogers.”
Thor was leaning against one of the walls holding a soda, and Quill was gripping his hoodie front, just kissing him. Peter was so quiet that by the time they noticed him it was too late.
“That’s when I said, why don’t we just scrap the carbide, and substitute the alien stuff? Like, that Starguy said we’d get a few I.O.U.s! And that’s how I helped make—ta-daa!”
“Cool,” Quill responded, clapping his hands once and then pointing at nothing. “I’m gonna like, take another tab and go to bed I think. I got pretty hurt today so…have fun watching the Death Star get blown up.”
There was something magical about eating breakfast with Steve while they watched snow cover the lake outside. It was lovely, and probably a much better date than getting sweaty at a park. Steve was beautiful in his washed jeans and socks. It wasn’t the date he would have chosen, but it was nice anyway. Rogers was a such a giant sap. He watched as the man ate his pancakes—he was such a hungry guy—and then got more. He wished he could focus on the conversation, or eating, but the only thing he could really focus on was the way Steve’s lips curved around that fork. The way his eyes would warm when they looked at him. Or maybe even the way his biceps flexed when he brought his cup to his mouth. It had been years since Tony had slept with anyone, and fuck if this man’s very presence wasn’t like holding a burger over a starving man.
Once he found a rhythm, he got comfortable, rubbing Steve’s thighs. The other man arched, gasping as his length disappeared into Tony’s lips with each bob of his head. It was clearly driving the blond wild, and feeling him respond like this was making him groan. Steve’s hips were moving gently against Tony’s face, twitching every now and then from little jolts of pleasure. Tony gripped Steve’s thighs and hastened his pace. He sucked hard, bobbing his head relentlessly. He was nearly nose to pubic bone each time his head came down. He was breathing hard just from the sheer thrill of it and was making clipped moans in his throat. Steve was gripping the blanket and moaning too, not seeming to know what to do with his hands. Tony couldn’t get enough of him. He wished he could deepthroat like a pornstar, but he just couldn’t. That was fine, he was able to swallow Steve down far enough anyway to please them both.
One of Thor’s friends? Out of all the people in the galaxy, the person who could help her loneliness was a friend of Thor’s? She dearly hoped the woman was much different than him, or else she might actually go mad.
“Okay then! Fantastic. I’ll call you. Y’know a real date isn’t that different than just going out to dinner, but there is a finesse to it Cap. Something no super-soldier serum can prepare you for. In the meantime, we’re gonna go downstairs and watch that Lord of the Rings movie I’ve been telling you about. It’s great, it’s only about three hours long.” Tony was acting nonchalant but his heart was hammering and his mind was going a million miles an hour. “C’mon, icecream later.”
Iron Man stared at him for a good long minute and then shook his head once, looking at a stunned Peter.
“Remember what I said about—are you looking at porn?” Tony grinned and his eyebrows practically flew into his hairline in something that looked kind of like joy.
Instead of responding, Steve just looked at him and said, “That’s the first time I’ve ever heard him call you ‘Dad.’”
“You know to be almost a hundred, you’re pretty cute,” Stark said with a chuckle, surging forward and hugging Steve. At least, it looked like a hug until Tony grabbed him by the waist and started flying upward. As Stark’s feet left the ground he felt Cap hold onto him tightly. He was actually disappointed. The first time he did this Steve shrieked. Now he didn’t even look surprised. He sort of had that expression husbands got when their wives wouldn’t get out of department stores. “What, no shout this time?”
avoiding them, but only because he was finally taking some phone calls he’d been putting off. He was in the middle of a serious discussion with a company that was helping him make more drones when he saw Cap come out of the elevator with a burger and a glass of iced tea.
Tony’s own curiosity got the better of him and he somehow managed to get the lead out of his feet and actually walk over there to Cap.
“Hey kids,” he greeted, sipping his drink and offering them all a friendly expression (well mostly Nat and Cap). It was the first time he’d seen Nat since Christmas.
“Yeah, everyone knows that’s my name.” There was a pause where Cap licked his lips and then stared down at the floor, taking a small breath and letting those long, lovely eyelashes brush his cheeks with every blink.
“He means if he dies or gets old, squirt. Can you even get old?” Tony made a funky gesture pointing at Cap with his index finger as they all made their way into a fancy country club. It was dark outside now, but Steve was pretty sure there were huge golf courses just beyond the tree line.
“Oh, hey dude! What’s up?” he turned and she heard the gross sound of him wiping his nose on his sleeve. “Hungry? I was ah just about to make some ornams. With sauce,” Quill boinked his eyebrows a few times.
“Guess you’ll have to come and find out,” Steve said, getting up and leading the kid outside. Quill stayed behind to finish off a pizza. God he’d forgotten how good Earth cheese was. When they all got outside, Peter shouted and threw himself at a beautiful black Ducati motorcycle that was just sitting outside.
The ship came in slowly, and Quill was keeping it well and clear of any trees. It was loud and the engines rustled the leaves and grass in visible waves. Tony squinted against the wind, leaning on a doorframe and scratching his facial hair. When the ship landed, Quill came walking out holding a big box in a strong grip. He may have put on a shit ton of weight, but like Thor he still had pretty nice arms.
He laughed and then stood, grabbing her by her waist and snatching her to him. “Respect your elders,” he growled, squeezing her sides.
“Take a ride…with Captain America…on his motorcycle? Pft, who wouldn’t want that?!” He ran upstairs so fast Steve wondered if he’d hurt himself. “Hell yeah!”
“Yeah.” Tony noticed Steve’s nipples through that thin shirt, since they were way more noticeable right now than usual. He couldn’t resist the temptation and lifted up the material, kissing one of his pecks, licking a nipple. Steve’s hand came to the back of his neck and he played with the fine hairs.
In seconds, the man—with golden hair he noted—popped out of the water and jogged to the beach. Just as the stranger’s feet slapped the wood of the boardwalk, a seagull cawed somewhere nearby.
He went upstairs and made himself a massive and sugary protein shake, probably worse for him than better. Then, he went to his gym area and began to bench some weights since he needed to clear his head. If Peter wasn’t here, he probably would’ve let himself go to shit, just like the planet…but there was no way he could let his guard down. What if something worse than Thanos came? He’d be ready, he’d probably lose again, but maybe he could keep the kid alive. That was really all that mattered.
There was a whining, sharp ring in his ears as wind suddenly sucked him and Happy from the craft. There was screaming, and fire, and he was falling with Happy’s arm still clutched tight in his grip. His suit formed around him just as a second explosion rang so loud it nearly knocked Peter out. His eyes were wide and focused. He wasn’t even breathing as he looked up and around, seeing the back half of the plane falling, on fire.
The next thirty minutes were filled mostly with Tony telling Cap all about what he and Peter had been up to—but mostly about what the kid was doing. Steve felt a fullness that he wasn’t quite sure how to describe, it really seemed like Tony genuinely loved Peter even more than he’d thought he did. It was such a new side of him. It was wonderful, seeing him like this.
Steve nodded, coming in as Peter moved aside. Just as his left foot crossed the threshold, his eyes locked with Tony’s.
She watched him, scratching a non-cyborg part on her arm. This was her life now. And it could have been worse. Not much worse, however.
"Well too bad. Cancel it. Why the hell'd you even let me make an appointment during my vacation anyway?"
They stood in the entrance for a minute, and then Tony glanced at Steve. The other man had a distant look in his eyes, and then turned to Tony with a somewhat sad expression. “My whole life I’ve wanted to take someone dancing.”
Thor made a frowny kind of smile that was more of a look of amusement than anything else, “And all I know, is that your sorry ass is the only reason I get out of bed in the morning.” Even though it was slurry, accented, and drunken-sounding, the heaviness of Thor’s voice gave Quill pause.
When Steve pulled his fingers out of Tony’s ass, he slapped his non-spanked cheek with those wet debauched fingers, causing Tony to shout Cap’s name. Tony could hear Steve pop the cap and lube himself up, but it just wasn’t
“Whatever,” she hissed, standing and washing Quill’s blood off of her hands. Thor was useful when he actually got off of the couch and helped them. She was thankful he at least contributed, even if he was hammered 90% of the time. His hair was still long and his beard was still nuts, but she beat him with tools if he didn’t bathe, so at least their ship didn’t stink (anymore).
“Oh yeah?” Steve growled lovingly, wet lips kissing the corner of his mouth. Tony tilted his head to capture Steve’s in a full and messy kiss.
As Happy waddled over to sit by Peter, Peter’s chest thudded with an absolute sense of sudden and impending alarm. A whirring noise started up somewhere. Happy was sitting, but the action looked like it was in slow motion, the clouds went by sluggishly and the sound of the jet engines faded into a dull hum.
He stuck himself to the side of the plane as it tumbled on its way down. There were remnants of both wings left, and they were causing the plane to spin in ways that made Happy’s limbs get thrown around painfully. He crawled inside the plane, webbed the captain’s door and then walked inside of it, using one arm to break the seatbelt and yank the unconscious captain out by his shirt. He wrapped both of his arms around the men and ran, jumping out of the falling cabin and turning on his leg and back thrusters full-blast.
“I know,” he agreed. He was still in full combat gear, fingers laced across his waist just watching her do her thing. “What drug do you think that was? I don’t feel much right now.”
Quill meanwhile sighed, the healing tab working, making him feel all warm. Sometimes it made him feel like he was peeing. He checked, nope, not actual pee this time. “Well that sucked,” he groaned, smooshing and rubbing his face with a hand. His hair was messy—but still cut the way he usually had it. He was just laying pathetically on his side, noticing a box of cookies under the briefing table from this angle.
He pulled his mouth back and started sucking and licking the head only, pumping Steve’s length in a tight grip that nearly had the other man whining. By the breathy way that Steve was breathing, he could tell the head must have been his favorite, so he kept it up, sucking and pumping until Steve moaned and his hand flew into Tony’s hair.
Tony hadn’t even realized he’d had his eyes shut. He opened his eyes and looked up at the other man, not sure if he wanted Steve to slam him into a wall or if he wanted to run away, his thought processing power was pretty much gone. All he could do was stare at Steve’s lips and feel those powerful, large biceps under his own palms. He licked his lips and then gulped in some of that charged air between them.
“Yeah? And…?” Bucky was in a black shirt that had its sleeves all the way rolled up like some sort of greaser. Ever since Nat made a comment about his biceps, he can’t help but show them off for her. It made him love his own body a little more.
Nat muttered, “Interesting,” as she walked over and began to eat a few of them. She and Bucky destroyed seven of them each by the time Cap made his way up.
When he sauntered on into the kitchen for some pick-me-up, he was surprised to find Steve making blueberry pancakes. His favorite. Hmm. He smirked as he watched the big guy flip them.
“Yeah, I’m tired. Don’t care to drive right now. Besides, there’s one last very important part of a date I haven’t gotten to teach you about.”
“I’ll stay.” Steve got comfy, throwing his arm over Tony’s chest and cuddling up beside him, almost like women used to lay on him. He was just too darn precious to move or fight him on it. So he went back to sleep hoping his kid wasn’t scarred too bad from this.
Steve was looking down at him like a big handsome man on Christmas, and his grip was firm but sweet. His feet moved with ease, a few beats ahead of the music sometimes from his enthusiasm. Tony’s heart pounded, and whenever Steve turned them too quickly it made him laugh. He didn’t even care he’d swiftly been put in the woman’s position.
“Sing with me, Nebula! C’mon! Someday, love will find you! Break those, chains that bind you—” Quill held his arms out to her, drawing his elbows in and doing the most ridiculous manly shimmy the blue woman had ever seen. He grabbed her by her wrist anyway and pulled her from her favorite chair. “One night! Will remind you—” Quill was headbanging and pulling her elbows in time with the beat. She frowned but moved with him, enjoying his energy far more than she would have ever admitted. He was obnoxious, but she loved him anyway…perhaps in the way a cat loved a dog it was forced to live with.
Steve tentatively rubbed his hand up and down Tony’s stomach, turning his face so his lips were against Tony’s ear. He didn’t say anything, just kissed his ear in a way that made Tony quietly gasp and inhale from tingly pleasure. His nose was buried in his hair, and his lips were kissing the shell of his ear. The warmth of his breath gave him chills.
Tony grabbed one of Cap’s pecks kneading the thick muscle for a moment before going lower, and actually palming the bigger man between them. The action made Cap gasp, and he grabbed Tony’s leg, roughly rubbing the softest part of the back of his upper thigh.
With a new Asgardian in their roster, they all hopped back in the ship and left the beautiful vistas of Aedi behind.
A few days later Bucky and Nat stood together watching Steve get into one of Tony’s nicest two-seater cars. Tony had flown in but always had some sort of fancy car waiting at the airport. Steve was in a nice dark navy suit that had a matching dark navy shirt, with no tie. It was a casual sort of formal that Nat told Bucky really suited him. As the car sped off, Nat turned to Bucky and said, “Y’know, it’s kind of weird.”
logo appeared behind Peter, who was standing on a stage in front of almost 10,000 people. Some were fans, some were reporters, but a great many of them were investors and shareholders from some of the biggest companies in the world. There were a few sign language translators on stage with him, translating in American English and British English. Other than them, he was alone with thousands of eyes on him. It used to terrify him, but now he got a sort of excitement out of it all. His adrenaline kicked up and he felt alert and ready…It was easier when he was actually talking about something he cared for.
“It’s fine, I’ll do it. I like that one about the Bohemians,” Thor mumbled, leaning down into their cooling box to pull out a few peach-colored sodas. “Cool?”
Peter wiped tears from his eyes and nodded rapidly, sniffling and trying to keep it under control. “I can’t believe this is actually happening. I’m going to make you so proud.”
He heard a man to his left and ducked just in time for the man’s fist to graze his hair. He turned around, grabbing the man’s arm and throwing him into a boarded window so aggressively that the board splintered and caved in. The man was half in the window and half out. Between he and Nat, the place suddenly became deadly silent in less than ten minutes.
The closer he got, the more he lost focus on the hot breath sending shivers down his neck and the other man’s arm clenching his torso around the ribs. Somewhere he vacantly registered Steve felt like he was already getting hard again—how the fuck—and that he was so close. “I’m almost there,” he breathed hastily, gasping at Cap’s steady hand. In no time he was moaning and drawing his knees up, clenching his toes, and coming all over Steve’s hand.
It was also really nice to have Peter home in Avengers HQ. Everyone had missed him. Tony missed him so much it hurt, and he was right here. Steve kept giving him little looks across the table, and Tony did find them comforting. They had been dating for a few weeks now, and it was nice. He’d also forgotten how good it was to spend time with the only other people on the planet who cared about him, go figure.
Steve licked his lips, running a hand through his hair and nodding with vigor, “It’s perfect.” After their drinks, another song came on. This one was a bit slower. Tony was still trying to come to terms with the flip-flops his heart was doing when Steve took his hand and led him back out to the dance floor. He took Tony by the waist and used it to pull him close. This proximity and closeness was making Tony’s heart thud in his ears. He was unable to make eye contact with the other man, and looked down and to the side, focusing on anything other than those perfect blue eyes. There wasn’t much quick movement or spinning. It was just slow and agonizingly romantic.
Cap didn’t have time to yell at him as the line went silent. He smirked at his phone and then quirked an eyebrow, shaking his head. Damn Tony for spreading that rumor—it should have died in 2012.
“Happy, Happy? Are you okay? Hey!” Peter held onto him, lightly getting the other man’s attention. “We’re okay! It’s okay!” Far in the distance the plane parts crashed into the ocean. Peter had flown hard and fast down toward the ground, so they were much faster than the free-falling plane.
Tony was going to skip town before everyone woke up, but you bet your ass he was going to stay now. “Oh yeah. I’ll order breakfast for everyone. Ever had yakitori first thing in the morning? It’s fantastic.”
Bucky nodded, shaking his head and brushing some powder out of Nat’s hair. “Sounds good.” She was alright, and that was all that mattered. Even though they both had thin bullet-proof vests on and she was a badass, it did little to ease his worrying mind. “Let’s get the hell out of here, this place stinks. I need to fix your arm.”
Cap stopped walking and then just turned with an expression looking half genuinely offended and half humored. Peter ran ahead yelling something that sounded like, “Not sorry!” And Tony actually just started laughing. He was laughing in that somewhat high-pitched way that melted Cap’s heart. He missed him so much. He found himself laughing too, besides himself. Mr. Parker’s gotten some nerve, he liked it.
to make sure all drones were cleared and destroyed in efforts to help Sokovia. He hated it when shit fell through the cracks. It was always messy. That’s why he liked to do things himself.
“That sounds like a plan,” Happy said, sounding genuinely relieved to watch something more palatable.
Quill nodded, “Oh yeah, I feel better. I fucking hate Kukats, geez.” He rolled his shoulder, stretching and realizing he was still in disgusting, torn clothes. He saw Nebula was resting in a chair in the back, a blanket over her lap. “I’m gonna go shower, hey if you make us some soup we can watch
She barely opened her eyes, seeing Quill sitting at the planning table and holding his chin. Their ship was dim, and aside from the mechanics of everything running while the ship went autopilot, it was quiet. He was turned away from her mostly, and he had his elbow on the table. This wasn’t exactly new, but it had been a very long time since she’d seen him so sad. The man never really cried full-on tears and snot, but he’d get this glossy-eyed look when he thought no one was watching. The moment she’d decided to get up, she heard Thor’s massive footsteps coming downstairs.
Steve just looked at him. Tony thought it was cute, he looked either overwhelmed or excited…he also looked damn serious at the same time. It was hard to tell with this guy.
“He’ll be fine,” Steve encouraged, kissing Tony’s temple and watching Peter drive around. “He’s a better driver than you are.”
“I know,” Steve said, looking up at him with the tiniest tingle of something. It left Bucky stunned. Did Steve know what he was doing? He didn’t know whether he was happy for him or concerned.
And so he did. They walked together, all the way out to Tony’s beautiful car. When Tony finally got to the driver’s side, he opened the door and then turned to look at Cap. “Alright, bye Cap—” he got shushed by a kiss to the cheek. Steve was leaning on the car and watching him with a look that just about made him melt into his shoes.
“I’m okay, Dad,” Peter said shakily, overcome with relief. Even though this wasn’t bad guys shooting at him or Thanos throwing moons at them, it was still terrifying. Rhodey put the plane into autopilot and closed the cargo door, giving the captain and Happy first-aid.
“Even I don’t know,” Tony was grumpy, seeing him on it made him mad…but he looked so darn happy. “Put on the helmet before you ride that thing around.”
He took a shower and finally put on something more presentable. Hopping in the elevator and bobbing his head to one of Quill’s favorite songs—“Dancing Queen” was a guilty pleasure—he arrived in the basement, surprised Tony wasn’t working on something down here. Maybe he’d managed to get to sleep tonight? He opened the door to Tony’s room, which was never locked. When it was, he minded his own business.
“Hey! That’s the captain’s call.” Quill held up a hand, putting the other on his hip like he actually held some semblance of authority in his socks and sleeping shirt.
“Hey! Cap, it’s fine. You were just exploring your sexuality right? I mean it’s 2016, gay marriage was legalized a year ago. I get it. Weird-ass place to do it, but I get it.” Tony said, trying to make him feel calm. He never came out to his own father or mother. The only person that knew he was bisexual when he was younger was Jarvis. Jarvis had held him when he pretended he wasn’t upset, and maybe Rogers needed some validation too. “The whole world knows I’m bisexual Steve. It’s fine. Who you choose to sleep with is none of my business.” Tony’s heart lurched.
Steve opened his door and walked in, laying the garment bag on the bed and throwing himself into his favorite chair. “I have no idea.” The rooms were more like mini-apartments for each Avenger. It was always harrowing that they were so quiet these days.
“Can you imagine? An old guy Captain America?” Peter grinned, mimicking the way Steve liked to stand with his shield. “I can do this all day—until my Xanax kicks in…oh, my back!”
Thor nodded, not having taken his eyes off of her. “Sif, you’ve got to tell me everything. Where have you been? What happened when my brother banished you? How’d you get on Aedi?”
“Yeah, and water’s wet. What’s happening in your life Cap? How’s that uh, counseling thing going at the community center?”
Steve was dressed in jeans, winter boots, a dark navy sweater, and a brown bomber jacket. Jesus he was always looked so good, like the clothes he wore were made for his body specifically. It didn’t help that he had pink-chilled cheeks. His hair was styled like it used to be in 2012, and he looked as youthful as ever. He looked just plain cute. He was surprised he didn’t turn up in plaid again like a freaking baby boomer.
Tony’s lips parted a little, “Excuse me?” When the actual fuck did Steve get this smooth? In his own dojo? “You smooth fucker,” Tony said exasperatedly.
“God! I fuckin’ love the 80s stuff on this thing. Yes,” he shrugged his shoulders in time with the beat, pressing his lips into a fine line and looking genuinely kind of silly. “How can you not like this Nebula? It’s a masterpiece.” He shimmied his way backward in his socks, nodding his head melodically as he ripped open a candy package. He chewed on one of the long pink straws, offering one to Nebula.
The moment they got in the craft, Bucky had Nat take off her top layers so he could look at her wound. She’d dusted most of whatever drug they’d been trying not to breathe out of her hair, and once she was just sitting there in her pants, boots, and compression bra, he got to work. A bullet had sliced open her arm, but it wasn’t deep. The thing about those kinds of injuries were that they hurt like hell even though they weren’t deadly. He sat beside her and delicately stitched her up with the small first-aid kid they always had nearby. When he was done, he sprayed it with antiseptic, and wrapped some gauze around her arm. He leaned down and kissed her shoulder, then her cheek, purring, “All better,” into her hair.
“I just really want us to talk again. I’ve been worried about you. I know you’ve got a life here and I’m real happy for you. I don’t want to change any of that. I’m not asking you to come back to the base, I just wish there was something I could do to—”
Peter let out a massive exhale, collapsing onto the floor, and then scrambling up to hug Tony. He wrapped his arms around him and squeezed him tight. Tony wrapped his arms around Peter, burying his nose in Peter’s wet hair.
The kid had spaced out thinking about Ned and by the time he snapped out of it he looked a little sheepish. “Sorry! Distracted!”
“Aw Steve,” he breathed. He knew the big blond had wanted some sort of dance when is plane went down. “Well, this date is for you. Dancing is an admittedly old-fashioned thing to do, but it is still well-within the realm of date-approved activities. I haven’t danced in ages.” Tony looked out at the much more casually dressed crowd and then at Steve, who looked like he was having a memory of something far away. Even Tony Stark new this was a big deal. The poor guy just wanted a dance, fake date or not. “Alright, well you know what? I know how to dance, let’s do it.”
There was a new silence between them, one that was more comfortable. It was broken by the very loud and obnoxious sound of Peter’s stomach growling.
“Scenery. Sometimes people I know. I paint Nat and the lake a lot. I’ve painted one of your suits before,” Steve said looking almost shy.
“If he, ever hurts you—” Quill nodded is head in tune with the beat. “True love won’t desert you…You know, I still love you!” Star-Lord drew his hands into fists and started more forcefully nodding his head. “Now we touched and went our separate ways. Dun dun dun dun…dun..” High at the top of his voice he began singing the medley of the guitar. The guy was clearly off in his own world fist-pumping and playing the music so loudly Nebula could barely hear herself think.
Only one beat passed between them before Tony, finally losing what little self-control he had in the first place, leaned over and kissed the corner of Cap’s mouth. He put his hand on Steve’s shoulder, tilting his head and then finding the other man’s lips. He swore he heard a small noise come from Cap that sounded breathless or something, the noise might have even come from himself, how could he even tell with his own heart thudding in his ears?
The two Avengers (plus an Avenger junior) stood in the living room of the nice cabin, just staring at each other. After a long hard staring contest, Iron Man finally decided to talk.
“Heard there was breakfast,” he said, quickly going and eating some. Bucky and Steve both had absolutely massive appetites due to the serum. They could eat forever. It didn’t take long for them to absolutely decimate the skewers of chicken, the noodles, dumplings, and cups of soup. It was the best breakfast any of them had had in a while. They struggled to take care of themselves, especially when they were busy.
Steve nodded, “Go for it.” He was watching Peter absently, but his mind was stuck on how Tony’s shirt rode up last night so far he could see his underwear and the hair line that disappeared beneath the hem of them. Steve was pulled from his thoughts whenever Peter clapped his wrists together after putting on two things that looked like fitness watches. From them came a suit that trailed up his arms quietly, going all the way from his wrists and hands to his feet. Finally, the suit melted up around his head, forming the typical spider-eyes he was used to seeing. This suit was black and red, with a few hints of white. It was very impressive. He moved around a little bit and then the suit began disappearing to his wrists and back.
“Maybe I will. Not every day an Avenger graduates,” Bucky said, nodding and then slapping Cap on the leg.
Steve met his eyes as he chewed. He swallowed before replying, “Doesn’t really matter. Maybe one or two. I’d like a boy and a girl.”
Even as Tony took a step back to eventually turn and walk away, he got the distinct impression that Steve didn’t want him to leave. Normally he’d be all over his partner, he was 100% the bang-on-first-date kind of guy but this…it was Steve. Steve was so different, he didn’t think it was right some how.
Bucky made his way up to the kitchen in the Avenger’s penthouse on the top floor. It was the floor above the conference and residential rooms. It was his favorite floor because there had been many good memories here. He, Cap, and Nat would all watch movies together. He was sure it was even more of a sacred place to Steve, who he’d often find just sitting on the couch alone with only his phone on. It was also the floor with the espresso machine and today he was in the mood for a fancy coffee.
“I am beyond glad for you Steve, I think it’s sweet. Even if it’s weird,” Nat came and patted his arm. He smiled at her until she left to go work on actual Avengers business.
Steve’s eyes widened only slightly, yet again immensely surprised by everything coming out of his mouth. He looked at Tony’s face and then turned to look at Peter in the backseat, who was smiling broadly.
Tony was startled but pleased as hell that he didn’t have to walk him through this or do it all himself—hopefully—and so he took a deep breath, letting Cap get a feel for it. Tony pushed up Cap’s shirt, leaning down and kissing one of his pecks, then a nipple. Cap’s index finger slowly rubbed down Tony’s ass until he felt the small give of his rim. He circled his finger experimentally, switching between his middle and index. Tony could tell he was figuring it out, and he’d allow the slower pace for now. He was preoccupied with kissing and sucking at Cap’s marvelously plush chest. God, he could die here.
With a hesitant feather-like grip, Steve reached and drew Tony’s member from its confines, a feat made somewhat difficult due to Tony’s love of tight name brand underwear. The moment he sprang free, Cap stopped kissing him for a moment to just look down between them. Tony wondered what he was thinking as he slowly picked up pace, pumping all the way from Steve’s balls to the head. Cap’s eyes fluttered closed and he bit his lip as his back arched a little, his own fingers squeezing around Tony’s member. Tony could feel that Cap wasn’t exactly experienced at this action, but it still felt great, the man was a fast learner after all. Tony wasn’t holding back how the touches made him feel, either. Steve’s hand slowly cupped his balls and then massaged them with his thumb in a way that had Tony reeling, and groaning. He thrust his hips gently against Steve’s hand, and gripped the comforter in a fist. Steve kept doing just that, and it was so good, Tony was more or less just absently working Cap’s member in time with those delicious movements. Cap’s moans were softer than he thought they’d be, almost shy at the moment.
