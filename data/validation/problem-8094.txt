The blond gets startled when he hears something fall on his right, turning around and almost screaming when Tony is standing right before him. As is, he clasps his chest and breaths deep. "Tony, sorry, you startled me."
Jarvis ranked him pretty high as well. There, right below his own family and friends, stood Tony. And the kid was content with that spot. It was the highest he had ever ranked for anyone.
A soft smile was playing around his lips as he twirled his engagement ring around his finger.
"They all know Tony. And they don't care. Why would they? You deserve this. You're finally behaving properly. Everyone is grateful for what I'm doing."
Clint peaked up first and grinned broadly. "I'm always up for a challenge. What is it?" The archer asked overly excited.
I'm still looking for a bèta reader, leave a message if you are interested!!
Just as he flew up, ignoring the shouts of the others to stay, he saw a stray bot from the corner of his eye, aiming... and shooting.
I'll be whoever and whatever you want, if I could please have another chance."
It would be over soon now. Bucky had come back to the tower, finally, and now Steve was spending every free second with him to help him heal. It hurt to watch them together. Tony loved Steve and understood why the blond loved Bucky.
And if Tony pulled yet another all nighter? Well, that was nothing new.
"What have you seen?" She asked while the archer dropped from the ceiling.
Tony has initiated full lockdown, nothing goes in or out. Even his air supply is filtered from within.
The three males present were all silently waiting for the door to open. The two older men were focussed and looking thoughtful. Loki looked terrified as usual.
"Hey Stevie, when are you going to get here? I have-" Tony begun excitedly before getting cut off by his boyfriend.
Without a sound the blond slipped under the covers and pulled the smaller man against his chest, careful not to wake him.
By the time Tony came out of his workshop, it was 2 pm a day later. He was hungry, tired, and slightly tipsy.
But I don't eat as much as he does. I'm not allowed. Food is a reward for good behaviour.
Steve was not really paying too much attention to Pepper's expressions, just trying to remember why the name Tony rang a bell.
Natasha just shook her head and muttered softly in Russian as she retreated. Those damn idiots.
That made Steve freeze. "You- you invented a new element??"
It took her some time, and by then Tony was dozing off on Steve's lap.
Clearing his throat that clogged up due to the emotion filling him, Loki quickly answered. "Yes sir, awake and ready." No one had ever cared about his privacy. And it would have been Coulson's right to walk in, it was his house after all. Loki felt a bit silly for being so happy with just a hint of kindness.
Natasha was a very private person. She was also known for her skills in espionage and deduction. Truly, it was a miracle she didn't notice it sooner.
Steve snapped out of his shock and nodded, handing the cup to Tony and sitting down for the first time since he left this morning.
His thoughts are interrupted by Steve quickly elaborating. "No
Bruce rested a soft hand on Loki's shoulder and squeezed gently. "You don't have to lie to me." He whispered calmly before pulling his hand back and slowly rolling up his sleeve. That got Loki's attention, Bruce saw him glancing carefully his way behind the sunglasses. When he held his arm in the light, Loki could see the cigarette burns, the cuts from glass bottles, the over all scars, and the green eyes widened in shock.
A certain blond super soldier stretched out on the empty bed back in New York. He hated sleeping alone. And with Tony Stark as his partner it happened too often for his liking.
Oh and how that fell wrong. Clint stumbled to his feet and ran off, followed by Natasha who sent Thor a deadly glare at her way inside. Bruce followed later, stuttering some apology before speeding away.
Tony followed, looking small and scared. It made Clint's blood boil.
Peter pouted again but did as he was told.
Bruce saw him tug his bag closer to himself. And the squad watched the boy hurry away a few minutes later.
Natasha opened her mouth to volunteer to go next when Clint suddenly grabbed Tony's hand and pulled the engineer up to his feet.
There was a tiny nod while Loki's hands clenched into fists.
And with that, the two assassins were moved in.
"Thank you brother, I shall see you after classes to ride you home!" Thor boomed before leaving again. That was odd. But when Loki looked up a little, he could see Bruce looking at him. His friends glanced his way as well, and they all smiled softly. It made Loki confused. People didn't smile at him. He quickly turned around and continued walking towards his class, this situation was just too weird. Besides, he had an essay to write.
Odin always cuts me as if I did it myself, he says a useless kid like me won't ever be believed. Everyone will think I only want attention.
Any second now. Any second he could be called a liar and sent home. Father would be so angry... And Loki was already so tired. And his body hurt so much. He didn't know why he kept trying. He had nothing left to fight for. Nobody would miss him...
They stood in silence for a while, the elevator rising slowly.
Instead of smirking, Tony smiled softly and apologised. "I muted Jarvis, I didn't mean to miss anything important. Was there a mission?"
I'm sorry for taking so long to post, so here is an extra long chapter
Tony blinks in surprise before carefully asking, "So... You're not gathering up the courage to kick me off the team?"
I get slapped for that.
Steve was sitting on the couch, sketching the scene before him. Tony and Peter, side by side, working on a pile of metal and wires looking like a dog. Or something roughly resembling one anyway. Peter was practically beaming as he gave his dad a lecture about colour coding wires. Tony just grinned fondly at his son with his adorable too big safety goggles that covered half his face.
He curls up against the foot of the bed and fumbles the chest open. And it's bad enough that he can't write a letter because his hands are shaking too badly, but it's too dark even to read. Miserable and denied even that comfort he clutches a handful of letters he can't see and curls around them, still afforded the meagre comfort of the faded scent of Tony on them - drowning and grasping at the knowledge that everything Steve dreamed may have been kind of real and kind of not but
right now. They walk upstairs - Steve first and Tony following - and Steve pauses before going into his room.
All at once a yawn nearly splits Steve's face in half, right in the middle of a word, and Tony laughs quietly. "Bedtime, I think," he says.
It's early yet, but what is Steve going to do? The faster he can get to sleep the faster it'll be tomorrow and maybe things'll be different. So he gets ready for sleep, but at the last moment he stands looking down at his bed and he just can't do it.
have to let go of him and slip away.
They're halfway down the street from the station, but Steve hears the train as loudly as if he were standing on the platform. The whistle as it comes up the mountain and rounds the last bend, warning anyone near the tracks. It rumbles and grinds into the station. The brakes shriek. There's an awful wait while it doesn't move. Then the whistle blows again, and the engine roars, and the chug chug of the wheels starts and picks up speed, and a few minutes later he can't hear it anymore at all.
"I mean," Steve says, awkwardly, "it's your house now too, Tony, and I know it's not your home yet but I'd like it to be someday. You can do whatever you like, have as many people over for as long as you want them. And honestly, I mean, you only just got here and you don't know anyone yet – other than me, but, I mean, I know it's not the same – so honestly the longer you'd like to stay the better, Mister Jarvis."
Despite the fact that he's a good four inches shorter, Mr Jarvis looks down his nose at Steve and sniffs. "Thank you for the courtesy, Mister Rogers, but it's quite heavy."
"And what if he doesn't tell me?" Steve doesn't want to say 'and what if he lies,' because he's not going to accuse his own husband of being a liar – but still, the fear is there.
let you rest and eat before dragging you off to the chapel."
"No!" Steve manages to find his voice at last. "No, I mean, I mean yes, of course I will, of
Just as the house comes into view between the trees Tony blurts out, "I'd like to try. To work towards that. With you."
Tony looks away. "I keep thinking about them, too. They only kept working for my father to stay with me. Jarvis told me in his letter. I think he was trying to make me feel better that they had to leave when I did, but all that means is they didn't want to be there, either, and I kept them there."
And before Steve can accidentally press him for answers on what on earth
are you moving the table?"
how fantastic it is, he's so apprehensive his hands are shaking.
Another sheet of the cheap paper:
"Sorry that took so long," Steve tries, but Sam holds his hands up.
Steve laughs, can't help it, and tips his head back to look at Tony and says, "This is perfect."
Tony raises his chin. "I'll be comfortable here, with you, without having sex."
"What if he tells me and I don't understand?" He says this more quietly. He's not – he's not like Tony. He isn't well-educated and sophisticated. He isn't near so clever. He wasn't raised in a city and he's never had real
Later that day Steve finds what he will come to think of as The Letter. He and Tony have dragged themselves from their bed at last, intent upon completing their chores and sating their ravenous hunger as quickly as possible. Tony's barely out of Steve's sight for a moment until all at once he's just not there anymore. Confused, Steve comes all the way into the kitchen and closes the door behind himself, looking around as though Tony will suddenly pop out from the writing desk or something.
you to marry one of them?" Steve splutters. He thought Jarvis really cared about Tony. Although, now that Steve thinks about it, that would explain the way Mr Jarvis treated Steve while he was here.
"Steve," Tony says again.
Steve barely manages to pull out a chair before he sits down heavily.
Tony's sprawled in front of him. He's buried in the pillows like Steve's kisses pressed him into them, his hair is a wreck, his chest is heaving for breath. His arms are at his sides, hands fisted in the covers despite how lax the rest of him is. His legs are spread around Steve's knees, and his cock is standing up beneath his drawers and shirt and making Steve's mouth water. And his eyes (drinking in the sight of Steve's chest and arms, apparently) are wide and surprised and sparkling, and his face is flushed dark, and his pulse is leaping in his throat, and his mouth is hanging open now but a moment ago he was smiling.
Damn it. He'll just sleep on the floor outside Tony's door. Tony will feel guilty if he knows about it, though, so Steve'll go to his own room first and change out of his clothes, grab a pillow and maybe a blanket, and come back out after Tony's already settled.
Steve doesn't know what to say to that either, so he just smiles and shakes his head, pushing his fingers into Tony's hair and cupping the side of his head.
Manhandling Tony without permission is something Steve would never do. All the same, it's desperately hard to not turn around the other way and gather Tony in his arms. It's nothing to do with sex and everything to do with protection and comfort. He wishes holding Tony would make Tony feel safe as much as it would make Steve feel like he's keeping him safe, but it won't. He knows it won't. The one and only physical touch Tony has ever deliberately initiated between them was the fleeting kiss at the top of the stairs, and even then Tony immediately ran away and got a locked door between them. He's never initiated a
I need you to know that I don't blame you, Steve. I won't. I know I'll be hurt and I know you'll feel guilty, but I won't blame you. I know you can't help it. I'll be all right.
Unlike always, as soon as they both climb in to bed they fall into each other, Steve pulling Tony into his arms and Tony pressing close, Steve's head on the pillow as Tony sprawls over his chest and kisses him, and kisses him, and kisses him.
"Nothing to be sorry about," Tony says softly.
me. And like I said, I didn't have anything to fall back on, not really. Couldn't run away with nowhere to go, couldn't get help with no one to turn to, couldn't get access to any tools or anything, couldn't even physically defend myself. And the more I tried to explain myself and act like I was a person the more they'd say I was hysterical and getting strange ideas and needed a nice alpha to calm me down."
(And even in the midst of a tense situation, even coming up against another way Tony was so wronged by the people who were supposed to care about him and on the receiving end of Tony's distrust, Steve can't help but think 'adorable,' and marvel at how expressive Tony is, and love him all the more.)
The final page is also on Tony's good stationary. It's dated today.
Unable to help it Steve lets his eyes fall closed again, smiling dopily and staying where he is, head low enough for Tony to reach his lips for quick kisses, again and again and again.
– comes to a standstill. Quiet and gentle as he knows how, Steve says, "Hello, Tony."
"Tasha," he sighs, "I need a little bit
help; Steve just wants to touch him. He resists again when they walk down the steps off the porch, and yet again hen they climb into the buggy (Mr Jarvis in the middle, as yesterday), but when they get to the chapel Tony's still sitting in the buggy and Mr Jarvis is waiting at the foot of the chapel steps by the time Steve ties Star to the hitching-post, so Steve takes that as tacit agreement that he's allowed to offer his hand this time.
Tony rolls his eyes, but turns towards Steve anyway. "You don't have to ask permission to kiss me."

wrong with you. Nothing at all. You hear me? I love you. And I -" he bites off the rest of the sentence.
"Not really," Steve admits, and Tony laughs again. "It's just that I'm a terrible dancer."
Tony, but that makes no sense because the Tony that wrote to Steve and the Tony that stood in front of him were the same person, except in Steve's head they're
The only sound is the rain softly pattering against the roof. Steve's never been so lost for words in all his life.
"Not that I've heard about," Clint says.
The rest of the day passes normally, and things are fine until that night. The sun's set, the doors and windows locked, the fire banked, and they're about to go upstairs to bed and part ways. Steve is literally wringing his hands because he does not want Tony out of his
Love blooms at night, in daylight it dies,
, and goodness only knows anything she says is probably going to be worth her weight in gold.
Tony's quiet and Steve doesn't say anything else, just keeps gently stroking the back of Tony's hand where it's still lying on his chest.
"May I kiss you?" Steve asks.
"Please tell me if you don't like something," Steve says, shirt forgotten as he drops his hands to rest lightly on Tony's knees, feeling the bony realness of them beneath the sheet. "Tell me if you
"I know," says Steve. "I'm offering. I just want you to be comfortable, Tony."
"It took me a long time to see it - well, a long time and a lot of time spent with Jarvis and Ana - but Obie didn't care about me, not really. Not about
"Tony! Steve! My favorite hermits!" Clint cries as soon as they cross the threshold, jumping up from behind the desk to shake their hands.
about going hungry or anything...
"All right," Tony whispers. He closes his eyes and leans back in his chair, tipping his head up and rocking the chair a bit. "All right. Let's get married. Tomorrow. Please."
Before he can figure out what to say Tony laughs harshly, turning away and beginning to pace. "It's fine, Steve."
No one moves till Clint strides through the doors and says, "He got on the train. Watched till I couldn't see it no more. He's gone."
I love you forever,
"All right," Tony says. He isn't whispering, Steve can hear him clearly, but all the same it's like his voice is
“Yeah. That boy over
“That’s… horrible.”
He put Jamie into Rhodey’s arms. “They’re so small. I literally can’t believe how much it hurt. Really, Rhodes. I’d wake up with an open heart wound every time if I could avoid this much pain.”
Natasha plans something. Steve seems to win.
on the other hand, can’t.”
Whatever he had just said seemed to convince Steve because he nodded. Tony really wondered how he had not been able to get how to talk until last month. Of course he knew they should be able to talk without having to think about how to present it. But that was a battle for another day.
To his great surprise, Steve really stopped talking. “I am listening, Tony.”
“Good. You will not go alone. Rogers and you will find the informant and bring him here.”
“Did you get what I asked you for?”
With a content smile, he pushed inside him.
Tony nodded, burying his nails into his palm. “That’s really nice. Thank you.”
The worst thing about it was that he could not go to the authorities with this. His was considered
“I was frustrated and desperate. it was not okay of me to lose control like that,” he continued. “But it’s done. All I can do is make it better.”
“Haven’t decided yet. I’ll think about it, after all, it’s one of the few honors I have.” Steve may have had the right to decide over their residence and their bank accounts but Tony and only Tony alone was allowed to name them. Actually, he had wanted to involve Steve in the progress but now that he thought about it the moment was perfect. He was gone for at least two days so he couldn’t pressure him into calling them however
Another option would be to call the Omega Distress Services but this would also mean that someone else would know of his secret and he was not having that.
Steve’s eyes widened. “They are… kicking.”
“He’s pregnant, Steve, alright? Remember that.”
were the one with the brilliant idea of
“No, I don’t think I will stay. Maybe it’s better if I leave you alone.”
Rogers would understand that.
Tony nodded, mostly because this meant he didn’t have to look into the poor boy’s eyes again who’d come back from his first night with Justin Hammer. Tony didn’t have to imagine how bad he was in bed; he could smell dissatisfaction on the boy. Not to mention the other’s.
“We will.” Steve said. It didn’t sound too promising, at least for Tony. And really, he wasn’t wrong.
“Apart from me loathing you and you destroying my life?”
he asked. “Do you think I like punishing you and teach you how to behave? I don’t, really, if I could choose you would just behave like every other person on this planet but you need some tutor lessons when it comes to that.”
She nodded and looked at Steve. “Do you want Mr. Rogers to stay?”
Steve at least tries.
Tony balled his fists. “Stop treating me like a goddamn child!”
“We could name the girls after our mothers.”
Tony is screwed. Literally and figuratively.
“You are?” He raised his eyebrows, not sure what to make of this
“Mr. Stark, if you fire a gun at me, I’ll be dead. It doesn’t matter if you are an Omega, a beta, an Alpha, female or male. I’ll be dead. So if my death isn’t affected by this, my life shouldn’t be either.”
He knew there were other things he would have to think about as soon as he was out of here, but not now. Now his adrenaline was high and he was breathing heavily enough to be a worthy competitor of an asthmatic.

Steve had sent him a location a few blocks away.
“Shut up!” he interrupted him. “
He thought of Tony. Was Tony the same? No. No, definitely not. Ton had kept harming himself, had worked himself half to death, barely eaten because of those bloody heat suppressants. He had
Really, she was a saint and Tony liked her too much to dread those examinations.
“Wait-
take you to a restaurant.”
“You… you…”

“Jup, I know.” he crossed his arms. “Steve, really, I don’t wanna know how many or what gender. I am huge already so I already know it’s more than one. Enough for me.”
“Yeah, I heard the only pain that’s worse than giving birth is being burnt alive.”
To him, it was really astounding how one single changing fact could ruin his reputation forever. Many articles analyzed his behavior and tried to link it to his nature as if it had been evident all along that he wasn’t a Beta. He knew they were merely doing this to relieve their conscience. After all, he knew how the press worked.
“Yes.”
“As are heat suppressors. Do you want me to undress you, sweetheart?”
was Tony Stark. He had dealt with worse than a hundred-year-old narcissistic bastard. He would get through this. Hell, he had gotten through three months of captivity. This was a child’s play.
There was silence for a while. Neither Rhodey nor Tony or Rhodey said anything. In the end, though, Steve nodded and sat down. “What’s the matter, Tony?”
Steve wants Tony to go to the doctor's. Tony wants his peace and quiet.
“Good morning, Alpha.”
Rhodey is shocked about what happened. Tony has to deal with the aftermath.
“You wouldn’t have come then.”
“I didn’t know it was SHIELD’s field of activity. You don’t usually interfere with political parties. Why now?”
pregnant he was a sarcastic ass, but with his body being this confused, he had gotten twice as bad.
"I tried to explain it to you. What you make of it is not my issue. Now, I made dinner.”
“As far as I can see, they are all healthy.”
"Jamie, Emma and child number three.”
“Nothing that was written down. But of course.”
“I don’t mean it as an insult, Tony. It is only natural, right? Nature wanted me to take care of you when we are bonded so it would be stupid to give you the same judgment as it gave me. In that case I would be futile.”
But not that. I’m begging you”
Tony rolled his eyes. “You are not scary, Cap. I know you wanna be. And I know you think I would give a shit about your att- ah-!” Tony flinched when Steve pulled him up the chair. His coffee mug broke into a million pieces. Tony was shocked, to say the least, both startled by the noise and by the sudden movement. He got almost
“You threw a $1700 gadget at a window.” he started. “You started to say very disrespectful things. You only ate an apple which is little.”
“What about their genders?” Steve interrupted his train of thought.
“Obviously.”
Rhodey had never questioned his desire to be independent. Also due to the fact he had thought he was a Beta, but even now he couldn’t see any difference in how he treated him.
“‘m lost. Can’t find the party anymore.” he lied although, in retrospect, this excuse sounded silly.
“Sure, Steve. Three pups are almost ripping me apart from the inside. But don’t worry, I am all good. Easy-peasy lemon-squeezy.” He took deep breaths like the nurse had said, trying to keep his mind clear at least.
“We’ll start from the beginning, then.”
He had been more than indifferent when Steve had set his rules and when he had punished him. It had sucked but he had never felt so anxious before. Maybe because this was an extreme injustice. His only crime was his PTSD, not that Steve
“He presented. It’s enough for them.”
known. After all, it was everything his Alpha agenda desired; Omegas were treated like objects, valuable enough to bid on them, especially when they were virgins. Tony refused to keep thinking about it or the idea of someone being less worth after being knotted to another.
He put him underwater again until he knew Tony was on the brink of drowning. “Why are you sorry?”
“I am glad I could help.”
The panic room was only a few hallways away. He would cope. Somehow. Normally, people could still think straight during their heats but he had never heard of a case that suppressed them for 30 years. With even steps, his mind getting more cloudy with each, he was sneaking into the panic room, pausing when he heard steps.
listen. I want you to leave now, Lieutenant Colonel. I will have to talk to my Omega privately.”
“Welcome.”
still your choice. If you don’t want to, we won’t know. But you won’t go outside then.”
“I know,” he sighed. “What I meant to say-”
Sorry for posting that late, I had a nice trip to Vienna.
The engineer cursed silently; even freshmen at MIT would have done better. But he had not been able to think straight since yesterday. Surely, he was getting sick. All the signs were there: He had a high temperature, bordering to fever, and a headache that didn't seem to go away. Probably just the flu. But since Tony normally worked through his flus without turning a hair, this was not something he considered tragic. Just annoying.
“You will listen to
“You really did it. You fucking took those suppressants again.”
Steve approached him and Tony tried his best not to flinch away again. Steve was furious with the statement and frankly, this was what Tony had intended. He winced when he felt pressure on his wrist.
Unless you want to end up as a pile of dust.”
“You should have a special room. It decreases anxiety attacks.”
“Oh… of course. Sorry, I just… didn’t work with an Omega before.”
Rhodey nodded and reached him a pillbox reading
When he had regained his balance he heard how the door got slammed behind them and he swallowed thickly. He had gone too far, it seemed. And although he had claimed not to be scared of Steve, a shiver ran through his spine when the taller man approached him with slow, even steps. Tony resisted the urge to step back and decided not to lose face and remained.
Tony and that boy weren’t the same. They weren’t, couldn’t be.
The light got switched on and it was blinding for him at first. He squeezed his eyes shut and could only open them twenty seconds later. Oh god. Steve was bleeding from his nose.
“Deal with the consequences, yeah,” Tony interrupted him and took another sip from his coffee.
“I’m- ‘m sorry.”
“But I won’t. Tony, when did I ever do anything I didn’t tell you beforehand? I told you about the rules, you broke them. There was a punishment.” He led Tony to the dining table and made sure he started to eat the soup before he continued to speak. “Whenever you break a rule I punish you and it is forgotten. Is this not easier, Tony? You do something wrong, get punished and you can let go of the guilt.
Something inside of Tony just snapped and he called his armour. The metal was not entirely adequate anymore; His figure had gotten slightly curvier and thinner without the suppressants. But it still fit. He pointed his repulsor at Steve. “Try me, Priklopil!”
“Yeah, because most of us can’t graduate college before some dickhead decides to knock us up.” He rolled his eyes and took the screwdriver in the other hand.
maybe. He really had no idea. Left extremists were just as bad as right extremists.
“No idea.” he yawned. “Always liked Emma.”
Rhodey to stay for that talk since Tony didn’t want to know how bad it would get along with the other. Rhodey didn’t need much of persuasion. He didn’t want to leave his best friend alone with Rogers either.
He knew in this very moment that Steve meant it. Whatever it was that Steve would do right now, it would not get better when he struggled. There was no option where he came out on top. This was the best chance he had at the moment.
” Steve stepped forward, Tony had no idea what he was intending to do. He didn’t have to find out, though - Rhodey was faster and twisted Steve’s arm behind his back. “I said
” He frowned. “What, do you want me to give you a rule book?"
“We have learned our manners, I see. The shirt as well. Everything.”

“You need

“Stark?” Adam Ford, one of Hammer’s partners, looked at him mischievously. “What are you doing here all alone?”
“Tell me.”
This was the first time Steve apologized and really, it surprised him, caught him completely off guard.
“Yeah. I will try to appreciate it more. But I just… All I am asking you for is time, Steve. Those changes don’t happen overnight. And you also have to understand that I am not your personal slave. I have my own thoughts on topics and I want to make my own decisions where it counts.”
He would’ve almost laughed. Only Steve Rogers was able to be obnoxious enough to blame the hormones instead of reflecting his shitty behaviour. “No, Steve. You alpasplained me through my
Tony immediately bit his lip. He had said something wrong again. Why was he even trying still? It seemed he was always getting it wrong ever since he and Steve had bonded.
Tony's confused for just a moment, and then he runs over to Steve and kisses him
He is very, very conscious of his body as they walk. He knows he's not traditionally handsome himself, but based on what people have told him over the years a big strong alpha is almost always attractive, and if nothing else Steve
Tony gasps, curls forward like he's been struck, yanks Steve's hair so hard he pulls himself right off the bed, clenches his thighs around Steve's head and comes.
Come and save me, Steve. Please save me.
"So?" Steve kisses his cheek.
Silence for a moment. Steve still doesn't know what to say. Rather, doesn't know how to say what he wants to.
with me, because by myself I could - I could -"
just let me -"
Even as Steve thinks this Tony spreads his knees a bit, and his knees knock on Steve's hips, his thighs not yet bracketing Steve but open enough that they could be. Steve isn't leaning his weight on Tony but all the same his clothed cock brushes against Tony at the same time that something very hard and very hot bumps Steve's stomach, and Steve's hips reflixively jerk sharply forward.
WHY DON'T YOU WANT ME
could do. Things like cooking and cleaning he'd mentioned, but even in his letters Steve had told Tony he didn't have to do anything he didn't want to. Tony had said he'd like to try, and that he'd try to learn as much as possible before he arrived.
The silence is broken by Mr Jarvis. He smiles, makes an expansive gesture to the buggy, and says, "I shall have to insist the wedding take place before the train arrives tomorrow. But so long as that is assured, then by all means, let us away to your home."
Sending and receiving physical letters in the actual mail is, no lie or exaggeration, one of the best feelings in all the world. It may seem silly and pointless, but it won't once you try it. Do you have a friend who doesn't live with you? What about a relative? Seriously. Write someone a letter.
, so he licks and nuzzles his way out of Tony's opening, over his balls, up the jerking length of his cock, kisses the very tip and then swallows the whole of him down in one long slide.
I'm not sure I can make it much clearer than that."
He looks around for Tony one last time, but there's neither sight nor sound of him. So he picks up the envelope and opens it. There are pages and pages, and even before he starts reading he can see that some of the pages are Tony's fine stationary and some are the cheap stationary Steve gets, and some of the pages are wrinkled and torn, and the first page looks like Tony's hand was shaking.
"I don't, though," Tony says.
physical touch between them, not even just a brush of fingers. Touching Tony won't make him feel protected and cared about; Steve keeping his hands to himself will. So keep his hands to himself he does.
but instead of going to bed he lights the candle stub and douses the lamp and curls up on the floor with his back to the foot of his bed and the small chest he keeps Tony's precious letters in open in front of his knees.
Steve gasps.
All Tony does is wrap himself in the blankets, throw his pillow down, and flop down on the floor. He sets up so he's also lying with his back to the fire and his face towards the door, but he's turned so he and Steve are upside-down to each other, the tops of their heads half a foot apart and their feet towards opposite walls.
He sneaks a glance at Tony and sees him duck his head shyly, but there's still a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth.
"It's not him," Tony breathes, and Steve looks at him sharply. He's trembling, barely, so slightly that Steve wouldn't be able to see it if he weren't sitting next to him. "I've never seen him before."
of that box; every single minuscule little scratch. I made the inside new, remade the lining using scraps of clothes I liked and grew out of; covered it with pictures from magazines and books my parents threw away for whatever reason. I kept so many things in there that I was so attached to. Ana used to call them my precious things. I guess they were.
"No, but I might," Steve says. Tony laughs, but half a second too late - like he's thinking something else entirely and doesn't want Steve to know.
"I have to go," Steve says. He stands and pays and is out the door into the blinding sunshine in less than half a minute, but even that seems too long.
for how little inflection there is in the words.
If Steve thought he was in love with Tony before...
"Of course," Steve says, because what else
Tony is his own person. Steve wants to protect him and make him happy, but it's not up to him. If Tony decides to do something that Steve thinks will make him unsafe or unhappy it doesn't matter, because it's still Tony's decision. Tony may have been hurt before and may be scared now, but that is no reason for Steve to
Tony's not there. The fire is still banked, the windows still shuttered, the table and chairs still exactly how Steve left them last night. He's disappointed until he opens the shutters on the window over the writing desk and then closes them right back up again. Of course Tony isn't out of his room; the sun's not even started rising yet. It's still full night. He's definitely still upstairs sleeping. The sky is dark, the stars still out, the dew falling invisible and cold, and Tony's upstairs beneath this roof, safe and warm in his bed, sleeping peaceful, and maybe he sleeps sprawled out and graceful or maybe he sleeps curled up with only his hair poking out from a mound of blankets and maybe his cheeks flush pink and warm and -
Tony snorts a laugh, and Steve laughs with him, playfully nudging him in reproof. "It made sense! I assumed your family had money and then fell on hard times, and that you were making a living off your intelligence. And I was so – gods, Tony, I couldn't wait to get you out here. To take care of you. I was so excited to get you out of whatever sort of boarding house you were living in in New York and out here where you'd have a whole house to yourself, and where things wouldn't be as opulent as what I thought you'd grown up with, but where you wouldn't have to
"Thank you, Tasha," he says. That's not enough, though, so he sweeps her up in a hug, laughing when he pulls her clear off the ground and she kicks her feet in the air. "You're a good friend."
Shyly, it seems, Tony accepts. Mr Jarvis gives a pointed look to Tony, and a severe look to Steve, but doesn't object.
The last word isn't even out of his mouth before Tony says, "Stay with me tonight?"
he wants to me.
mind at rest if
How to write them with Steve so close, though? On the one hand he'd prefer to never sit on anything that isn't Steve's lap ever again, but on the other hand he doesn't want Steve to read what he writes. Not that he'd write anything he wouldn't also tell Steve, but it's - not secret, but - private. It's private.
But, well, Tony's made his decision and told it to Steve very clearly. Steve going against his wishes and NOT marrying him would be just as bad as Steve forcing him to get married if he didn't want to.
"Steven," Tony says, eyes burning into his. "Come
In the end he puts on his under-drawers and his shirt, then dashes back to the house quick and furtive as a thief. Tony's not on the first floor so Steve closes the door quietly, then runs fast as he can on tip-toe across the room and up the stairs. He doesn't breathe until he's safely behind his bedroom door.
He leads them to the house and up the porch. He wants to reach out and help Tony again, but it's only three steps; Steve just wants an excuse to touch him. He fights down the urge.
Steve's so startled he chokes on his own spit and can hardly cough because he's laughing so hard. Tony swats at him, but he's smiling. "Steve! Stop it!" Tony laughs. "I am baring my
Tony smells so good here, and the proof of his arousal and enjoyment is heady. Steve mouths at his cock, licks at the head, seals his lips to the side of it and sucks, laps down to the base and pushes his nose through the curls to press the point of his tongue to Tony's balls. He wants to press his face between Tony's legs and get even closer; cover himself in Tony's smell and sweat and slick.
Steve gulps. Later he'll be both impressed and relieved by how frightening Mr Jarvis can be and the fact that there are people in the world other than Steve trying to take care of Tony. Right now, though, he's mostly just intimidated.
Clint raises his eyebrows and spreads his hands, motioning to the whole building, since Bruce is clearly outside his home.
Steve gives a watery laugh. "I'll take blanket permission for hugs, all right?"
"Oh!" Steve says, snatching it as soon as Sam holds it out. It's addressed to Tony Rogers. "Oh, gods, thank you!"
Now, though, driving towards it with an obviously wealthy Tony and an openly disdainful Mr Jarvis, Steve's seeing it through their eyes, and it looks like naught so much as a rude little hovel. Tiny and mean and out in the middle of the woods in the middle of nowhere, with not even polish on the floor or the first story divided into more than one room. He has the half-wild urge to turn the buggy around, tell them the house burned down and put them up at the hotel in town instead.
"I agree."
"Yes, yes, gods yes," Tony groans, and Steve presses his face into Tony's neck, the feel and smell of Tony's skin against his face and ears and pressing against his closed eyes, smothering himself for the space of one breath to keep himself from coming right then.
talk with him about sex."
Darkness falls rapidly, the sun sinking beyond the mountains in a burst of glory outshone only by the stars that light the sky. Clint lights a dozen lanterns in the barn (all of them hung high to prevent anyone from bumping in to them) and a handful of people pull out instruments and settle against the back wall. A handful of people including - Tasha? Steve stands and stares for a moment, but it really is her. He had no idea she played fiddle.
"It did seem like he wanted to." Natasha points out while actually physically pointing with her wooden spoon.
(--o--)
Actual glass bottles. Tony always ordered them because he knew it made Steve feel a bit more at home.
A cup of water was held up for him, courtesy of Steve, and Tony emptied it in one go.
"Tony? Are you alright? Everyone has been trying to contact you for days..." Bruce said worriedly while holding a steaming mug of tea close.
"I'm sure they'll find something soon." The PA reassures his boss before getting up, excusing himself, and getting back to work.
I got nine minutes late. And so the yelling started. I never like that. I already know I'm useless and horrible, and it hurts just as much every time. I thought I would get used to it.
Sorry for the long wait, I had a massive writer's block.
Tony whimpered and nodded nervously. "Only yours." He whispered scared before being pushed towards the bedroom.
Loki was getting nervous, no one could read it. "Not really. There's nothing wrong." He said and tried to take the papers back. He grabbed miss though, Clint was faster and pulled them back.
Pepper admired his stubborn nature, which had been the reason for hiring him in the first place. Honestly any other assistant would have walked out ages ago. But Steve stayed, was good at his job, and became a friend to Tony.
So without further ado... Here's the Comfort part of this Hurt/Comfort fic.
While standing in the elevator, the doors opened halfway to a stubborn looking Steve.
He was laying on the floor, barely conscious. Only awake because he had to know...
Bucky nodded reluctantly but made him promise to tell someone if things turned dangerous.
For a moment Tony closed his eyes and enjoyed the contact. He had missed this. Had missed
The billionaire who made it just hoped his boyfriend liked it.
So far, no one had pointed it out yet. Cap didn't even mention it during the debriefing, only claiming Tony had snatched Clint up before he hit the ground.
Another knock on the door had Loki flinching and then blushing at his response. He truly was pathetic. But when none commented and Bruce simply pet his knee with an understanding grimace, Loki relaxed a little.
I'm looking for AU's to write, maybe some odd pairing.
Shuffled footsteps could be heard and Steve steeled himself for whatever he was going to see. He heard a pause in the footsteps, a mumbled "might as well get it over with", before his new boss stepped around the corner.
Tony was flying, the suit wrapped safely around him.
The voice of the AI was all to be heard in the mansion after the clock struck midnight.
Clint handed the papers to Phil, and Loki fought to keep those filthy tears inside. He succeeded, he hadn't cried in years.
Tony had been found wanting, just like Howard always said.
Loki was completely wrapped up in the documentary. He had always loved learning and studying. Even though it was immensely frustrating having to hide his knowledge.
Tony did cut down Peter's workshop time. The kid could use some order in the chaotic life of the Avengers, so there were mostly set times during which father and son would work on fun projects together. Sometimes Bruce joined and they would make something science instead. Or Clint would show up and ask about something from a movie. The archer mostly whined about lightsabers, which,
"No. He did." The student whispered barely audible.
Tony had a crush, and he hated it with a burning passion.
He wasn't good enough. Wasn't worthy.
"Who will try next?"
Coulson made a mental note to get the kid some new clothes, that actually fitted and were warm and soft. "No need to apologise Loki." He whispered thoughtfully. There was a lot that needed done.
Steve cupped Tony's cheek with a hand, brushing a tear away with his thumb and looking straight into those stunning eyes. "Tony, we all have blood on our hands. But you... you have cleaned them a long time ago. It wasn't your fault. Ultron wasn't your fault."
Steve swallows thickly and immediately starts rambling. "I'm
Barton suddenly wasn't that hungry anymore. The sight of the student looking absolutely terrified to accept the food made his stomach churn and his throat clog up.
Steve was the first one to go to the school councilor. Originally he went to Coulson to switch scholarships. He went from sport to art. He was good at sports, but he didn't like it as much as art. So as soon as a spot was free for him, he switched. Phil quickly figured out there were some minor issues at home, and wrote him down for a weekly meeting.
Phil nodded firmly and Hill stepped forward to lead Thor out of the room. After a lot of commotion, they were gone. Fury followed them after looking at Loki for a second, his eyes hardening in anger of all who hurt this boy.
The sun was shining bright as Tony opened his eyes. He groaned and quickly closed them again, head pounding with a mild hangover.
And especially not when Steve would undoubtedly hate him for what he would do soon...
However, he did take this opportunity to watch Steve flex those stunning muscles under his way too tight shirt in preparation.
Phil's calm voice poked through Loki's dark inner monologue. "Loki..? Loki. You are not kicked out." Phil said softly, causing Loki to be confused. "You don't have to go back. We will find you a place to live, we will arrange your college bills. I want you to take some tests, make them as good as you can. Because I believe you can easily get an academic scholarship." Coulson quickly reassured the scared kid.
Told you it wouldn't take as long go update this time ;)
Bruce had fled to the library as soon as he could. At this period in the year, right after the first exams, it was deserted there. It was safe, calm, quiet.
He wasn't like Howard was he? Shit.
He and Natasha shared everything. Including their observations about their host.
Steve enjoyed his new job. Not one day was the same and stopping Tony from blowing up the lab quickly became a specialty. That would be fun to put on his resume.
He was an idiot for thinking it had been fading.
Tony sipped from his coffee, humming content at the bitter taste. "Okay but that's like, a forty minute train ride?"
Bucky seemed surprised Tony was even awake and cleared his throat softly. "Tony, Steve is getting some food, but I need to tell you this before he gets back." The soldier took a deep breath before continuing. "I'm sorry Tones. I truly am. I never meant to hurt you. At first... At first I got here and wanted to do anything to get my Stevie back. But then I met you. And you two are so amazing together. And I just... You are amazing Tony. You and Steve deserve to be happy. I had stupidly hoped we might work, the three of us. I know you don't think of me that way though, and that's fine. Just... Please give Steve another chance. He loves you and I promise I won't be in your way. I'll be gone the second you want me to."
The assignment was formed by mister P.J. Coulson, and given a one day time span.
Get a shrink, check. Stop drinking, check. Stop flirting, he could totally do that. What else... He'd have to be nicer, work harder, make time for Steve a lot, and follow orders.
"We will keep an close eye on both Steve and Tony." She decided after a minute of thought. "If we notice anything odd, we'll talk to Tony."
A small smile formed on Pepper's lips. "I'm afraid that's... classified. I will not be able to give out any information until you've signed a nondisclosure agreement. The identity of your new boss cannot be leaked. However, you are always welcome to talk to me if anything bothers you." She spoke kindly and without hesitation.
Tony liked Steve. Which was rare, since he hated most people. Or, they hated him and so he automatically disliked them. But Steve was different. He didn't run off screaming after all.
Phil's house, will things change for Loki? Or will it get worse?
14:15 - rapports
Bruce went to Betty, Clint to his farm together with Natasha and Phil, Thor was up in Asgard, and Tony... Well, Tony celebrated as he does every year; alone.
Steve was his favourite.
Steve recognised a basic humanoid shape somewhere in it, but the shoulders were hunched, the arms out of proportion to the body, and most noticeable, he was completely covered in hair. Large fangs poked out from over his lip, and his nails were long and dark, almost claw-like.
It was Natasha who brought the four together, she was the adopted daughter of the principal. After one abusive home after the other, she ended up with him. It worked out.
Natasha's expression slowly grew more tensed as she listened to Clint's story. It certainly didn't seem right. Puzzle pieces were starting to fall together, and she didn't like the picture they were forming.
Stark had injuries he never bothered to check and left with a description for antibiotics.
Tony wanted to both scream and laugh hysterically at the same time. Instead, he cleared his throat. "Yeah, sure, talk to you soon Cap." He said emotionless before hanging up.
I cannot show anyone this.
"Miss Potts, I have a student who needs a full physical exam. With documentation." Coulson said and shared a look with the  nurse who immediately understood what was implied. She held the door open to her examination room and smiled softly at Loki. "Come on in, we'll get this over with as soon as possible."
As he slowly calmed down and the blood stopped rushing through his head, he could hear someone else.
One brief second of tension... and Bruce held the hammer above his head with a broad smile.
In the mean time...
Phil was sorry? No one ever apologised to Loki... That was... Strange. Why would he do that? Even if Coulson had made a mistake, he was the head of the house.
This was happening a lot faster than anyone anticipated.
They briefly discussed taking the test for an academic scholarship, but both decided that Loki couldn't handle that just yet. Showing his true mind in public would become a challenge.
"Ah yes! Of course! You must simply find a romantic partner! One to spend a life time with. I believe once your romantic intend is set, a simple kiss would suffice to trigger your release!"
Of course Captain Rogers was happy with the saved lives. But Steve was worried sick about his boyfriend who had survived the disaster due to some sort of miracle.
I notice I have a grade higher than normal, for maths. I quickly check with the teacher. But it is correct. I scored rather high at the last test, and now my grade has gone up.
"No... Just, we were worried, that's all..." Doctor Banner muttered surprised and indeed worried for his friend's sanity.
As he looked at his screen, he opened his testament. Steve had been added. The one person who could deal with Tony on a daily basis. He would get some stocks, some money, a part of the tower. He'd be a rich man.
Loki tensed, but Phil smiled. "Tony, Bruce, how are you two?"
It's a miracle, I know.
Tony can't help it, he's grinning. Chuckling even. He grabs Bucky's shirt, pulls him closer, and presses their lips together in a soft brief kiss.
Of course, if Tony pissed him off, insulted and fired him, chased him away, he wouldn't be too hurt.
Time to meet the school councillor, will he be able to help Loki?
"He took me out. Courted me I suppose. Finally we moved in together and slowly things changed. He didn't just hit me one day. It grew towards that step by step. At first he asked me to stop drinking, which I did. Then he started controlling my work hours, my meals. It seemed like he was taking care of me first, but it soon became really controlling and just... wrong.
Iron Man flew off and was the first to arrive at the scene. Doombots. Fucking doombots. With an annoyed sigh, Tony started blasting away, avoiding hits, and basically distracting the robots from harming any civilians.
Tony looked up with wide eyes before clearing his throat and looking away. "It's fine. I was just- going back to bed anyway."
And the genius agreed. After all, Bucky was Steve's best friend and boyfriend, Peggy was his first crush. Tony was just... There. But it was alright, Peggy had married and gotten children. And Bucky died decennia ago. Tony would be fine.
With three smooth steps she reached the couch and glared at all the heroes sitting there.
It wasn't like that at all.
The movie ended, Cinderella got her happy ending.
"Please Steve... please don't... I will send Bucky away... I promise..."
No he actually stuck around even after his disastrous bad days. Honestly, after scaring the poor guy out of the workshop, Tony had totally expected to get a call from Pepper saying Steve quit. But no. He still showed up the next day with his bagels.
The student took a sip of his tea before putting the cup down, hands shaking. He didn't answer until his arms were firmly wrapped around his own chest. "I- I got home late. So I was pu-punished." He stuttered softly, terrified.
No charges were pressed to Bucky. Apparently there had been a camera blackout. There was no evidence Bucky ever assaulted Captain America.
(--o--)
There was something very strange they did note. Bucky spent quite some time in the workshop.
The others almost groaned.
Also, let me know if you want Loki to end up with Bruce or not :*
His head was pounding. That's the first thing he noticed.
It stayed silent for a very long time. But Bruce waited patiently, until...
Phil pulled a face that suggested he was not exactly pleased with either thought and silently put the stool in the shower. "Please try to walk as little as possible? You need rest to heal." Coulson said softly as he helped Loki up and out.
After a tense few seconds where Pepper stared at him until he swallowed nervously, she smiled and nodded, seemingly satisfied with his answer. "Good, now, I know you have experience as a P.A., Carter had only good things to say about you. This job won't be too different. Your new boss is... eccentric. He has a certain disease that makes his appearance rather shocking, and therefore he never goes out. It will be your job to assist him with his paperwork, and also to make sure he stays alive."
Bruce got challenged next and the scientist agreed after a bit if prompting. "Alright guys, but don't expect too much..."
Tony had been drunk since the moment he walked into the workshop.
The walls are pretty bare, and my bed isn't always comfortable. Sometimes I have bruises or muscle aches and then I can't really sleep well. Like this night, my side still throbs a little, so I haven't really slept much.
Phil had told him he did not have to do any chores until specifically ordered to do so. The embarrassment of making a meal for no reason was still fresh in his mind.
(See the end of the chapter for
A slap to his face snapped him out of it and he stared up at a shocked Bucky. "Steve, stop that shit and go fix this." The soldier said sternly.
, who could move the hammer even before they worked together and saved the world.
He had the piece of paper prepared since he got named an official Avenger, knowing he would have to leave eventually.
"Pep! A little warning would be nice!" A male voice shouted back, only serving to make miss Potts roll her eyes.
And that was that. Tony showed them around their perfectly designed suits, the range, the dance studio, and finally, the common area. It was nice. Light. Open.
"Easy there, it's just me dude, sorry for startling you."
him. It freaked Tony the fuck out.
This chapter doesn't have one. You can trust me. *grins widely*
Trigger warnings for Self-Harm
He might even be glad his asshole boss was dead.
Worthless. Useless. Fucked up.
There were even pictures of how disgusting he was. Now everyone would see what a gross freak he was.
19:14 - nothing
They both had missed this and it was obviously visible on their faces.
Pepper had Work on one. Tony being on time was two. And Tony took that as a victory. Because it meant he was kind of high in Pepper's list.
He could feel anger coursing through his veins but carefully pushed it back down, now was not the time. He had to check Loki's state first.
Of course Tony can't help but snort, it's not everyday you hear Captain America use that expression.
Wanna bet?
Let me know what you think! :)
There was a strange sense of déjà vu when Tony woke up for the second time.
SHIELD fell while Tony struggled with Extremis. And everything was suppose to calm down after they defeated Ultron. Sadly, things were not looking good for Tony. But then again, when did they ever?
"What the hell did I do??" Clint asked confused and annoyed.
to spend time in the workshop with you. He wants to learn and build with you. I'll talk to the team, mostly Clint, he shouldn't have said that and-"
Steve was too sweet, too kind and caring. With a heart the size of Manhattan. If Tony died, he would be hurt.
It was always a challenge to get Tony (he quickly stopped calling him Mister Stark after almost starting a panic attack) to eat or sleep. Steve quickly figured out that as long as he left snacks everywhere, Tony would eat without even realising it, just picking up whatever was nearby.
"When I heard that the Avengers were moving in here I was both horrified and pleased. Horrified because I knew it would attract all sorts of trouble, and pleased because Tony could use the company. Pleased because I thought you would all look out for each other.
poses. He suddenly understands Steve's insane blush.
Bruce frowns and shakes his head lightly. "It's nothing like Tony to set Steve up though. Remember your third date." The calm scientist reminds him gently.
It made Bruce a little nauseas, the defeat in the other boy's voice. The surrender, the emptiness. He needed help. Right now.
6:15 - the alarm goes off.
Clint frowned, still hidden in the vents. Why did Tony believe this shit? If Steve was truly hurting him, why would Tony believe that the others knew?
The broad shouldered student refused to belief anything but praise about his father. He even went as far as to accuse Loki of lying and cheating only to get attention. No matter how many statements they told him about, or proof they showed him, Thor kept his own stubborn opinion: Loki had done it all to himself just to get attention.
With a sigh, Tony focused back on his work. He had been getting distracted a lot lately, messing up in battles more and more. And now someone even got hurt. He really had to get his head back in the game.
Now he just needed one final key ingredient.
Natasha throws a piece of her popcorn at the glaring archer while answering. "We were just talking about how much he looks like you." She explains while smiling sweetly at her fellow agent.
Now his heart was still bleeding freshly. He needed some space and time to think. To build the walls back up that had crumbled while around the two soldiers. The genius runs a hand through his messy hair and orders Jarvis to send a suit.
"Tony? Are you alright?"
Unable to comprehend what was going on with the heavy pain medication clouding his mind, Tony simply nodded. He suddenly felt exhausted and tried to fight the sleep looming near the surface. Darkness surrounded him as he heard Bucky's soft reassurances of safety.
They're both silent again while Tony let's that information sink in.
Secondly, his whole body felt strangely numb.
Clint bailed from the game and groaned when he saw how bad Natasha's cards actually were. "You're right. Steve will be good for him."
I almost forgot, happy birthday to me. I'm glad Odin forgot his birthday present to me. Last year was horrible.
Bruce nodded and told Loki to come by after classes to say hi. Which was basically stating he wanted to know how things went. Then the brunette left and Phil grabbed two cups, putting them on the desk before turning the water boiler on. Once the tea was ready, and Loki was holding the cup between thin hands, he did feel calmer than ever before on the school grounds.
There was a brief knock on the door before it opened, a woman entered first. Loki recognised her as the head of security, miss Hill. After the stern looking woman, a confused looking blond entered.
And he had an asshole father. His father rarily talked to him. And when he did, it was to tell him what a failure he was, and what a mistake. He avoided his father now, and his friends helped him see the words weren't true.
Loki still looked terrified.
Maybe that's why he never told anyone, maybe he did just want attention. Or maybe he just hoped Odin would cut too deep or hit too hard one day, doing what Loki was too afraid to do.
Shit.
He never wanted Peter to be bullied like he was.
Oh well, he had done it for Steve. Had promised to take care of himself more. Had worked so hard to try and remember to eat, sleep, and not live on just coffee and alcohol. And look where it got him? Locked in a workshop with just robots and an AI to keep him company.
The blond supersoldier almost drops the plate he is holding and turns around fast enough to give a regular guy a whiplash. "Tony! Oh, ehm, I was just-"
Most people were wrong.
The genius rolled over to Steve's side and breathed in his smell from the still warm pillows. Apparently the Captain had stayed longer than Tony had thought, or maybe he just hadn't slept that long.
Said student was keeping his eyes down, his hair hiding his face, and his fingers fumbling with his sleeve. Clearly uncomfortable.
Natasha smiles sweetly at Tony. "You should tell him you want him to screw your brains out while you're at it." The assassin says casually before dragging Bruce into the elevator leaving a spluttering engineer behind.
of Steve's art. There's drawing after drawing of Iron Man. Most of them in epic battle poses, but a whole extra series of the armour doing all sorts of normal things like baking and shopping for shoes. It's... It's cute actually. And amazingly well drawn. The lines are so smooth and every drawing shows the strength of the metal perfectly. It's gorgeous. The contrast between the sharp armour and the soft actions is astounding.
They share a look before Clint answers. "We have a few suspicions. But, no concrete evidence."
For a moment he hesitated, claws hovering over the word 'love'. He sighed and deleted it, leaving just his name. Steve didn't deserve to be burdened with that. Tearful declarations of love on a deathbed should be saved for people who both loved eachother. Not for unrequited crushes.
Apparently his shock was visible on his face, because Loki quickly grabbed his sunglasses and put them on. "Just leave me a-alone." He whispered as he looked away.
Of course, he still spent most time with his father in the workshop.
What next? The alcohol, definitely.
Tony sighed and simply sat behind his desk, staring into the distance as he tried to tune out that little voice in the back of his mind whispering that he should have seen this coming. Why the hell would anyone want to celebrate Christmas with him?
The end?
are mine. Not anyone else's. Get that?" Steve almost growled and pulled Tony roughly against his chest.
. I just.. Couldn't choose. I still can't. I'm.. I'm so sorry-"

Shocked, Phil quickly took the plate from the young adult's hand and made him sit down again. "No, Loki, don't do that. You'll get injured. You have to rest your ankles, doctor's order." Coulson said a little sternly and watched Loki twirl his fingers nervously.
It wasn't until months later, after his therapist pushed him, that Tony dared to ask Steve out for real. The smile which formed on the captain's face at that precise moment was still one of Tony's fondest memories.
It took a few hours before the door flew open. Steve was on his feet within a second and froze when he saw Bucky standing there looking furious. Steve quickly realised something was really wrong. After all, the Winter Soldier didn't show emotion, including anger. This was pure Bucky looking very pissed off.
Tony swallows thickly and shakes his head. "No. He- He snapped sometimes when I messed up. He taught me sparring. But I'm old and human. He's- He's so strong."
"Can we talk?" Tony asked softly, and even though Steve was surprised, he nodded without hesitation.
Without mourning a beast.
However before any spy could notice anything, something else happened.
Tony had to be a better dad than Howard, he just wanted Peter to be happy.
It seems to last an eternity before the two men part to smile at each other.
Bruce shrugged. "If Tony doesn't want to celebrate Christmas together that's his loss."
But just as the councillor finished his suggestion, Loki already grabbed some foil, covered the salad, and put it away. He wasn't as awkward and clumsy with his wheelchair as Phil thought he would be.
Phil didn't look pitying, he just looked thoughtful. "You are Thor his younger brother?" He asked to get the picture in his mind fitting somehow.
He seemed less loud and more shy. Perhaps the relationship with Steve truly had changed him. After all, he didn't drink anymore, didn't sleep around, didn't party hard. He actually didn't go out at all unless it was necessary.
Surprisingly light footsteps announced Phil walking in with his bags of groceries and Loki tensed just a bit more when they froze in the door opening.
Tony looked from Steve's heartbreaking expression to Bucky, looking him over as much as he could and feeling relieved when he appeared unharmed. "You okay?" His voice came out crooked and raspy.
It wasn't until a few minutes later that he remembered where he was.
Natasha pulled Bucky inside her apartment, locked the door, and asked Friday to call Clint.
"Sure thing Cap, what's wrong?" Tony asked as he mentally hoped it wouldn't be about Peter. Tony knew he was messing up again, but he didn't know how to fix it. He just wanted Peter to be happy dammit.
Soon the Avengers sat down around the table with dinner being divided over their plates, thoughts of their genius team mate pushed to the background.
Just as Tony finished the last touches on the decoration, Jarvis announced a phonecall.
Tony took another sip from his bottle and rested his head against the wall he was leaning against.
"I don't understand..."
Of course Steve just stared straight at him until he got the point and sighed.
It was the first thing Bruce had heard him say, and it was a plead not to hurt him. This was definitely not good. Something was very wrong. The signs were there, and all of them feared something was going on with Loki. Maybe it was time they tried finding out what.
"Oh look, he lives." Bucky said dryly even though there was a hint of worry in his voice that would only be noticed by those who knew him.
Loki nodded ever so softly, that didn't sound too bad. Normally he would have kept quiet and hidden away, but he was just so tired. He couldn't do this anymore. Maybe... Maybe if Odin got angry and kicked him out, he would be able to get a job and a place of his own...
Steve smiles sadly and looks down at Tony in his too big sweater. "I wish you had told me when I called yesterday, but I understand why you didn't."
Clint laughs and pokes Steve with his elbow. "Didn't he show up covered in slime because he didn't want you to think he forgot even though all of Manhattan was covered in gross slime monsters?"
"J... Send that to Stevie..."
"I won't hurt you. And I don't want your money." Bruce said softly. "I just want to help. Thor said some mean stuff back there-"
It had taken a few days for Clint and Thor to feel guilty, but they finally came to understand how Tony would take this on.
It almost seemed to be pulled from an old movie, so perfect. Loki could barely believe it as they pulled in the driveway.
Natasha bit her lip as she realised Bucky had been right. Tony's PTSD was still horrible, and Steve abused it.
started to fit together. "
First of all, there was the obvious malnutrition. The kid looked like a walking skeleton.
Tony tried wiping away the tear that had escaped him and looked away, ashamed. Hurt.
), was trying to find a cure. In the mean time, all Steve had to know was that the light in Tony's chest was
The beast rolled his eyes and took another sip. "Anyway, why don't you just crash here in the weekends? We have some apartments set aside for staff. They're not huge, but I'm assuming it will be a lot easier to just walk up a few floors than to take the train every morning." Tony was clearly in a good mood, it must be one of his good days.
"Some time, sure, but he's been avoiding me all week! And even worse, he still won't tell me his-"
Well this was certainly interesting.
"Ya okruzhena idiotami." The Russian muttered as she took in the confused looks around her.
Loki only briefly struggled, but it hurt his aching body too much. And so he ended up following with his head hung.
My arms drip blood on the cold floor, and so does my back. The card is taken from me again and signed as is expected.
. As soon as they found someone who could do the same... He was out.
Steve busied himself with making some tea while his boyfriend slowly woke up properly somewhere during his second cup.
It was so wrong. How could someone as filthy as him fall for someone as perfect as Steve?
I should have gone home sooner, but I wasn't finished with my homework yet. Thor is still angry at me, so I will have to walk home again.
It took Phil a lot of patience and a calming voice to remind Loki that no one here would judge him for his intelligence. He was safe. He wouldn't be punished for showing his brain.
Tony swallows thickly. He looked down for a moment and caught sight of Clint's cast in the corner of his eye. Of course.
Tony opened a new file and typed a quick message. He couldn't cry anymore, but his heart ached as he added the note to the will for Steve to get after he died. He had already written similar notes to Pepper, Rhodey, and even Bruce and Thor.
Natasha visiting Odin?
He should have-
Tony had nodded in acceptance and walked out of the conference room not quite realising what had happened yet.
__________________________________________________________________
I always spend my breaks in the library. It is calm and peaceful, there aren't any people to bother. I slowly eat my lunch, it's an old cheese sandwich today. I made it for Thor yesterday, but he never ate it, instead eating the chicken I also added in his lunch.
Please let it be an easy cure. Please let it be easy...
Steve couldn't stop the small chuckle. No matter who his boss was or what he looked like, Steve had the feeling this job would be fun.
Months passed and the press slowly moved on. Months turned into years and aside from the occasional person wondering what happened to the billionaire, the world moved on.
But why did it feel so
Tony was curled up on the couch in the common area about five weeks later. His hair wet and dripping while hid hands shook terribly.
Clint curses loudly and Bruce just nods in agreement.
"Show me." He said a little louder and watched a feed from a security camera pop up on the nearest screen.
"Is there anything I can do to help?" Steve asked softly.l
And judging om the smile Steve wore when he walked in, the Captain agreed completely.
"I'm sorry I didn't go and talk to you."
This Christmas might not have been perfect, but it was theirs. And no one would be able to take it away from them.
"H-home?" Loki whispered shocked. Home. It was a word without feeling, he didn't know what a home was. He had always wanted to know though. "I... It's really not necessary." He whispered instead. He didn't want to be a burden after all. This man had offered him so much help, he couldn't ask for more. "I can go to..." But where could he go to? Nowhere. He didn't have any other options. Loki was so scared to agree, he wanted to, gods he wanted to. But he was stuck in a wheelchair, useless. How would he earn his keep?
Loki thought about it for a moment, he didn't want anyone to see how misformed he was, how often he must have misbehaved. They wouldn't want to help him if they knew how often he was punished. But then again, they also couldn't help him if he didn't agree. And not taking the chance would mean guaranteed punishment. And that is why the boy nodded softly. "I will see her at her earliest convenience." He said softly.
Anything angsty is awesome. Anything not angsty will be turned into angst.
On days like these, Steve wouldn't even see Tony, aside from some glimpses of fur. It's why he was so surprised to hear the familiar footsteps coming close. His breathing stuttered. Did he have to leave? Tony never came into the living room... What changed? Would he be angry? Would his eyes fill with pain again?
There were casual drinks, Bruce holding a hot cup of tea, Natasha sipping from a glass of Vodka, Clint just munching on some chips... it seemed causal, Tony doubted he was welcome.
Thor agreed with a loud "Aye" and asked Steve to go first.
This is what it feels like to be a number one.
Phil read the essay carefully, feeling the blood drain from his face. This was so much worse than he thought, and he had sent the kid back there. But now came the most difficult part, collecting evidence. The papers were carefully put aside and Clint softly slipped out.
James's shoulders sag and he sighs. "Yeah, well, neither do I. Just, small things that don't make sense." Bucky sits down on the couch, suddenly feeling very tired. "I like 'm more than I should. He's just... amazing, adorable, smart, funny, charming. And he things he's worth nothing." The brunette whispers and hides his face in his hands.
Who looked like he was half animal.
Steve noticed first and poked an elbow in Tony's side to make him see. The two shared a glance and Steve quickly sat down on the couch beside Loki.
I hope you liked this new chapter.
But he had dragged it on for too long. So what if he hadn't had a hug from anyone but Pepper and Rhodey in years? So what if Steve smiled at him whenever he walked in? So what if Tony's heart felt just a little warmer whenever Steve was near?
Loki had been terribly nervous, what if he screwed up? What if they were like Thor and didn't believe a word he said?
Tony gently shook his head and told Peter to eat his sandwich. "You should be in the class with kids your age Petey, now eat."
Natasha may claim the contract safe and pretty basic, but Bucky stood by his claim that she was a spy, so she couldn't be trusted. Anyway, Bucky was suspicious. Why would some random secretary suddenly get promoted to some secret rich boss? It made no sense.
Looking down into those watery brown eyes, Steve felt himself lean down, brushing his lips against Tony's in a soft kiss.
The next morning Natasha had woken up and went searching for Steve to spar with. When she heard from Jarvis that the Captain was in the workshop with Tony and Peter, her eyebrow twitching was the only sign of surprise. "Blya, ny nakonets-to." Natasha muttered as she reached the workshop and peeked inside.
Have fun!!
They were getting closer. And Tony had to cut it off.
Also, thank you all for the kudos!! I hadn't expected that. So, thaaaank you :*
Pepper catches her eyes and nods. "He did. He officially quit being an Avenger. Even
Something was missing though. When Tony went down to the workshop leaving behind a sad looking Peter. The workshop felt empty without Peter's chattering.
Of fucking course it was. "What about him?" Tony couldn't help but turn on his defences as he walked to the kitchen, Steve following him. It stayed silent for a while. Tony turned around and glared at Steve. "Just tell me Rogers."
Steve.
Or no, he was useful. After all, he made tech that saved lives these days. He just wasn't
"Nope." Tony says with a popping sound on the P. He shrugs and feels himself smile softly. "If I had known it existed sooner I would probably have been following it already."
They had been dating just over a year now, and last year Steve went to visit Peggy and the whole Carter family for the holidays.
But now it was up to Clint to see what was going on upstairs.
He sat down on his couch and didn't say a word, caught in a loop of
A spark of hope had set in Loki's chest and refused to leave. Perhaps his story could be similar to that of Cinderella.
The writing feels nice, like someone is listening. But no one can read this. I will burn these pages and never hand them in.
As always, Tony's worries were pushed aside when he laid eyes on the men he loved. The two gorgeous soldiers who were all his.
Natasha starts cursing in Russian again while Steve walks off towards the lab, praying he can get to Tony before the engineer does anything stupid.
Tony didn't move. He stared at his workbench while a cold ache hurt his chest. This was the best for Peter. It was.
The test results from Loki's examination come back...
Where he had expected someone with a grow defect or maybe a weird skin disease, this would never have crossed his mind. Another thing standing out, was the blue light emitting from his chest, bright and flickering slightly.
Barton rubs the back of his head and shrugs. "Just a prank Steve. No need to get your panties in a twist."
__________________________________________________________________
He focused back on Pepper when she cleared her throat. "I know I already warned you, but please keep calm. Whatever it is you think he's going to look like, you'll be wrong." She seemed serious and a little worried, and so Steve nodded.
That wasn't too bad...
Tony stares up at Steve from where his head was resting against a broad chest. "Steve? Wadda ya doin here?" He slurred heavily, making Natasha frown.
Steve saw Tony become alarmingly pale and quickly continued. "He wanted to know if he'd done anything wrong. He asked when he could go back to your workshop again."
"Tony?"
"Please... Take good care of him..." And with that, darkness surrounded him once more.
Said engineer looked up from his work, dark marks under his eyes betraying his fatigue, his brown eyes dull and glazed over. "Mmm?"
It took the older man a bit longer than he wanted, he hadn't wanted to keep Loki alone for too long, but eventually he had bags with bread and meat and vegetables and everything else they would need throughout the weekend. Especially with the guys coming over tomorrow. They ate in bulk.
"No please. I know you're going to apologise again and I can't stand it. Tony, I'm not leaving you. I love you, you silly amazing wonderful insecure lovable funny idiot genius." Steve said while gently cupping Tony's face with one hand and looking into those beautiful brown eyes. "I missed you."
Eyes shot open again and Tony stared at the man besides him. "Steve?" He muttered with a crooked voice.
The exhausted genius could hit himself for responding so stupidly. Only... The last time Steve had dragged him from his workshop seemed like centuries ago. The last time Steve had even touched him must have been weeks ago. Their last date... Tony wouldn't even think of that.
The blond soldier easily scooped Tony up, setting the smaller man in his lap and holding him close.
"Mister Rogers." The CEO greeted surprised. She didn't know exactly what happened between him and Tony, but she could guess. Tony cared for Steve, so he had chased him away, like he had tried to do with her and Rhodey.
Jarvis, bless his golden layered circuits, already started the coffee machine so a nice hot cup of Tony's favourite blend was waiting for him.
The psychologist smiled at the confident man sitting before her.
"This is the livingroom, the kitchen and diningroom are that way. I'm afraid I don't have an elevator so I will have to help you up and down the stairs until you're allowed to walk again." Coulson said calmly as he pointed to the right doors and pushed Loki in a clear spot in the livingroom.
Right after the battle, Tony lived alone in the penthouse of Stark tower.
"Sir, if I may-"
Tony looks up surprised as Steve blurts out his disagreement. "It would be too dangerous Cap." Tony continues slower, confused and slightly hurt. Is that it? Does Steve want to kick him off the team and make someone else pilot the suit? Because Tony knows he's not a good teamplayer but he would never be able to give his suit to-
First thing on the list; new arrows for Hawkeye. New gear. New comms. Anything that could help to make sure this never happened again.
"I tried to keep my distance when I started falling for him. He's Stevie's fella, I would never steal him away. Only... I never even knew Steve was gay. As far as I know he is straight as a whistle. While... he knew I'm bi. That's what you call it right?" At Nat's nod he continues. "It just didn't make sense. And then there is this weird thing where Tony brushes away his PTSD. This... There was a cup that fell, water hit his face... I'm pretty sure he got a panic attack. I wanted to comfort him. And he told me to go. Said it wasn't worth it. I should spend my time at more useful things."
Something, Natasha pointed out harshly, they apparently didn't deserve.
As Tony gently cleaned the cuts in Bucky's hand he couldn't help but ask. "Why did you do it?"
The final drop was a stack of paperwork being delivered to the tower claiming he and Bucky now owed a luxury penthouse in Brooklyn. If this was Tony breaking up with him, it sucked.
While waiting for one of those meetings to start, Steve met Clint. Clint was at school with a scholarship for his archery. But he was at the councilor at order of the director of the school, Fury.
"Yeah, you've been operated on eight times. Been unconscious three days. Doc says you have to stay in bed for at least two weeks. It will be a few months before you're allowed back in the field." Bucky says briskly as he tries to hide his crushing worry.
This takes '
Steve relaxed just a little and grabbed Tony's hair, pulling him along to the bathroom. "However, you're still not behaving perfectly. I saw you looking at Natasha. She's not going to help you. And you have been spending time with Bucky again. You know what that means don't you Stark?"
Pepper smiled again and handed him a thin stack of paper. "Read these through first, if you'd still like the job, you can come return them signed tomorrow and start immediately."
The student rolled his chair quickly to the kitchen and grabbed the pasta from the fridge, setting it on the table and rolling out of the way. His hands were nervously twitching in his lap. The What-if's buzzing around his mind. Loki closed his eyes and hoped. Hoped that Phil would like the food. Hoped that he wouldn't be thrown out yet. Hoped that for once he could rest without fear of Odin walking in.
Steve's expression was so sad and filled with love at the same time, it was almost a bit of pity, but not quite. Empathy maybe...
"You know, normal people actually
Coulson parked carefully inside his garage and told Loki to stay put while he grabbed the wheelchair.
Clint was never one to beat around the bush, Natasha knew that. Still, she would never get used to him dropping from the ceiling and stating something that should be impossible.
Tony just grinned like the world didn't matter. "High and dandy suit-man. We still on for tomorrow?" The hyper engineer asked while Bruce rolled his eyes amused.
With shaking hands he parted the curtains slightly, it filled the room with the soft light of the moon, and from where he lay on the bed he could look at the stars.
She would visit him again, and see if there really wasn't anything he could do.
And with that, Pepper opened the door.
Natasha cursed violently in Russian as she looked inside, widow bites ready.
Steve and Nat shared a look and nodded in agreement.
He had been waiting for the moment. From the day he started dating Steve, people had been warning him not to hurt the Captain. Like he wasn't already terrified of doing that.
"Not now Tony, just... Just leave me alone alright?"
When his stomach grumbled in protest of only getting a few bites, Loki blushed and hoped no one had heard. There was no such luck.
One glance at the fond look on Steve's face, and Natasha slipped out. The Captain would take care of this.
If anyone else had called his name he would have simply kept walking... but not for Steve.
He understands that the genius had a lot of responsibilities, but it hurt knowing he didn't even spare a moment during Christmas.
I'm cold. I still don't know why Banner bothered to bring me to Coulson. I don't know why Coulson is wasting time on me when he could be helping good students.
"Although... He isn't my father." Loki whispered with pain lacing his voice.
"There is no need to apologise brother, I should be the one saying sorry. I should not have said the things I did. I do not know what has happened, and yet I judge you like I do. Please forgive me my harsh words?"
Clint made an intensely sad noise and curled up against Natasha, while Bruce was shaking again. Tony comforted Bruce this time while Steve shook his head intently.
Tony knew there would be talking later, which he didn't like. And makeup sex, which he very much liked. And Steve would probably make a point about Tony's insecurities. There would probably be tears involved.
Amazing gorgeous funny Bucky.
23:12 - alone
Natasha sat down on the coffee table to face them and appeared reluctant to talk. "Tony? You have to tell us what happened. So we can make sure he never hurts anyone ever again."
It didn't take long to arrive at Phil's house. A simple but nice looking home. Complete with white picket fence and a red mailbox.
The student couldn't quite finish it all, his body wasn't used to it. But when he didn't get punished for wasting food, when Phil just put everything in the fridge and smiled, Loki decided that perhaps Coulson truly was different. It gave him a spark of hope that maybe not everyone was like Odin.
Pepper had no trouble believing him.
Pepper smiled again when Steve relaxed a little and handed him a phone. The newest StarkPhone to be exact. "You'll need this. It's yours, consider it a signing bonus. Now, it has an AI installed who can help you with whatever you need, though you should have met Jarvis already since he's also installed in our downtown office. It also gives you access to a work account to pay for whatever your boss may want you to get. Or actually," Pepper briefly stopped talking as the doors opened and they got out. "actually it is for whatever he
Someone offered to help him. Maybe, just maybe, things would become a little better. Just a little. He didn't expect much, but if only he wasn't sent to his room without dinner as often, he would like that. Not that it mattered what he liked, he would accept whatever he got.
-:•:-
The four guys were sitting on the roof as they did every Monday, cherishing the moment before another week to fight through. Natasha appeared beside Clint, scaring the shit out of Tony.
Loki had gotten to his feet to grab another plate, and didn't quite manage to silence the pained noise.
Ah. That explained the confusion. "It is not too bad. I walked to school yesterday. I am able to walk to the shower."
He never meant to force Peter down the workshop. Didn't want to force him to work day in day out to become the perfect engineer, like Howard had done to him. But what if he had done exactly that? What if Peter would grow up hating him for pushing him into his footsteps? Tony doubted he could live with his son hating him.
Chapter 3
Of course Tony didn't believe him, but that was alright. Bucky would just keep repeating until he did. They had a lifetime ahead of them after all.
Of course Steve just told him to suck it and -after reading the contract thoroughly- signed it.
"Hang on." Tony immediately interfered. "You don't know what's wrong, you're just believing your father, and haven't even given Loki a chance to speak?"
Clint looks down at his feet and clears his throat softly. "It's my fault. Me and Thor had been having a prank war. Eventually we came to a tie and wanted to prank someone else together. Tony's been so distant, we thought it might bring him around if we just teased him a bit. It... got out of hand."
Natasha was stirring through the soup, silently glaring at everyone, a calculated gaze aimed at the pot before her.
He was vain, arrogant, selfish, greedy, and most of all; naive.
He had just a few days left anyway.
Steve looks startled, shocked, and completely confused.
Just the epilogue after this and then it's over
Apparently it hadn't pleased Steve, since he pulled a sour face. "Yes, well, aside from the typing error which I'm sure will be fixed without an issue. That's not why I'm here. When I started here, you said I worked for you. Not for Tony. And he wouldn't be able to fire me. And yet, he did. Out of nowhere. I'd like to know why."
Dressed in cleaner and nicer clothes than he had ever worn and his ankles throbbing, Loki grabbed some books out of his tattered schoolbag and decided to make some homework he wouldn't hand in. Science was his favourite, together with physics. Those were the hardest to fail because he loved studying it.
Tony loved the Captain with all of his damaged heart. They had been together for a few months now, after having lived in the same tower for years.
"Wow hey, I don't know what's going on, but I'm sure there's been a misunderstanding."
Such a simple statement took him so much energy and courage. But it was worth everything to see Steve turn back and smile.
Tony just raises an eyebrow while looking at Steve who's trying very hard to avoid making eyecontact which is so unlike him. "How about we begin with how you're avoiding me."
He wasn't worthy. If there was any proof for it, this was it. Everyone in the team was considered worthy, they were good people. Except for him. He was the black sheep, the rotten apple.
Meanwhile Steve is already halfway to the elevator.
Clint stopped from the vents after the bathroom door closed and waited while his hands clenched tight. He couldn't stop Steve on his own. He had to wait for backup. But it was killing him.
"Clint..." However, she trusted his judgement. "What happened?"
Steve pulled back and walked to the door. "I'm going to take a shower, want to join?"
I make breakfast for everyone because I have the most time in the morning. So I bake bacon and eggs for father, eggs and toast for mother, bacon and eggs and toast for Thor, and I just eat whatever is left over. I'm not hungry in the morning. The kitchen is nice and bright, it's very big, but I have to make sure everything is clean after I use it. At seven everyone gets out of bed and eats, when they're done I clean up.
"I'm sorry." He whispered softly, wiping the tears away and fumbling with his threadbare shirt.
And with those legendary words Tony grabbed the bottle and emptied it. There went his three months of regulated drinking.
"Go ahead Loki, you should eat. And this is yours." Coulson said softly.
Tony did spend lunch with his son, cutting his sandwich in something that was meant to be a spider, and watching the happy smile with relief. "How is the reading coming along kiddo?" Tony asked with a warm smile, feeling himself relax around his son.
Tony took a moment to think about the question and shook his head eventually. "No, I don't think I could ever come to that conclusion ever again."
This feels rather nice. But I feel so tired, and it all hurts so much. I'll go to sleep now. Maybe I will get a diary. To write.
"Perfect. Buy the penthouse and have it put on Steve's and Bucky's name. Oh, and get that young designer girl who did the tower to decorate it. No limit on the budget."
"Tony?"
"Well, ehm, we need your help. Or actually, Loki needs your help. Like you helped us." The brunette answered. An intelligent boy, that Banner. With that last scentence he made sure Phil knew exactly what was going on, without straight up saying it. Informing, without creating an awkward environment.
There was no one there, barely anyone there as they walked through the school. Loki in his wheelchair feeling useless. Feeling like a bother. But afraid to deny the offer of a home. Just when the exit came into view, and Loki relaxed a little because they got out without running into anyone, two people came walking around the corner.
“Blankets?” he asked carefully.
When he heard Steve growl lowly, his attention was brought back to him. Not that he could do much. All he could do right now was to hope Steve would fuck him now. Or not. Either way he wanted this decision to be made as soon as possible because he felt how he burned up even more. Although he hated Steve’s guts right now, he was impressed he could hold himself back this well. After all, he was sure his scent was extreme.
“You said the same thing about the pups.” he reminded him.
“I see.”
When he reached ‘
“Excuse me?” Tony had done many things way over his comfort zone already but this? This was too much. “We have triplets at home who would like us back alive.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Please.” Really, he would destroy him with facts. Slowly, meticulously. But not now. Right now he wanted nothing else but Steve to push inside of him, to end the heat, the burning.
He was okay with being called a self-centered asshole but he was not a traditionalist. He did his best to support the Movement, to advertise its advantages. He might have been a Beta, but the people listened to him and were astounded every time he donated another eight-digit sum to the leaders of the ORM.
Tony quoted. He was not sure if Steve was trying to make him understand or if he wanted to manipulate him.
“I don’t think so, Stark.”
“An- Tony, nothing happened.” he said gently. “You dropped something. I want to check if you are hurt. Will you let me?”
Tony cursed under his breath but did so. He looked calm but his thoughts were racing; he hated how the smallest of things could push both of their buttons. His rage grew and grew but he didn’t say anything.
anymore.
and a sharp pain in his nose. It seemed to be broken. He had half wanted to scream at Tony, tell him that now was not the time to discuss them cuddling or sleeping in the same bed, especially since holding him was a natural instinct. But by the time he had opened his eyes, Tony had already transformed to a sobbing ball in the corner, babbling apologies for the hit and trying to reason it with something Steve would not quite comprehend. All he knew was that this had not been some plan to make their life even more difficult. His Omega had been scared, no,
“Tony, you are pregnant. And overreacting.”
“Mhh, I- God, Alpha, please-” Tony couldn’t form coherent sentences anymore, it was too late. There was only Steve. There were only Steve’s hands and Steve’s cock and Steve’s growls that made him feel good, made him feel needed. Only he could give an Alpha this pleasure, only

Tony nodded. “And my role is the household and the children, then.”

can lose my patience.”
Tony! Can’t you see it? You are not good for yourself. You are self-destroying, you-”
It took Tony about twenty seconds to kick him into his crotch, punch him in his throat and leave. He couldn’t go into the room in question without him seeing, though, so he quickly returned to the festivities. Steve was talking to a very successful lawyer when Tony came back. He’d put enough O fragrance on himself to eradicate Adam Ford’s existence. Steve would not know they ever met. It was better this way.
“Bond him.”
“Probably. Your choice.”
“We should finally ask how many we’ll even get.”
He would be able to show him off to other people, to claim him as his own with every look they gave to Tony. He’d even managed to get his hair under control.
“Huh, a bit straightforward. Let me buy you dinner first at least.”
If I tell you I need an epidural and that I can’t handle the pain, I expect you to believe me and let me.”

“Of course, Tony. What is it?”
“Well, it

Hey! I am not dead, my laptop broke is all. And until I could afford a new one... well...
“You are doing it again, Tony. I am being nice, and I am trying to help you. And you? Spit in my face for this.”
“I will not cry in front of you like a child again,” he clarified. “That was the whole Omega hormone thing. I normally don’t do that.”
Half of the time, he was almost sweet, trying to make life not so shitty for him. Tony had always been a fairly social person and the fact that he couldn’t leave the penthouse without someone potentially trying to stab him in the stomach.
But luckily he wasn’t.
“Is your budget that low or is personnel shortage being a bitch?” he crossed his arms.
He just laid there, eyes wide, and tried to comprehend what had just happened, without much success. Instead, the Omega closed his eyes, drifting into sleep when the itchy feeling disappeared and got replaced by utter and complete exhaustion.
“We talked about this.”
“Jokes on you, Cap. I just run on caffeine, anxiety, and spite.” As if he wanted to demonstrate his point, he emptied his mug with one single gulp.
He had not even realized that he had not counted number nine. It had been a simple slip of his mind. But that didn’t matter, he thought bitterly.
“Take. That. Back.” His voice had gotten dangerously low.
“We will start the bidding now.”
“Steve? let’s go out later. A park, a restaurant, take your pick. I wanna socialize.”
“Well, don’t worry, I will help you out, Tony.” Steve’s voice was cold and sounded aggressive at the same time. Probably he was mad he hadn’t known.
“Yeah, look Cap, that won’t work.” Normally he worked until about three or four and slept about two hours. Sleeping eight hours was nearly insane. He had work to do, after all.
“Yes, Alpha,” he muttered. He didn’t care where, he’d pass out either way soon.
“I… I am so sorry, alpha. I am so- I’m an idiot. Please, I… I’ll fix it.” He was bonded, he reminded himself. He belonged, he was wanted. He would get punished and then it would be over.
Sorry for the long break, I am currently writing on another similar fanfiction, this time with a slightly better Alpha Steve (he's a good guy) and a very disturbed Omega Tony (ma bean) in the 1940s. It's called Small Steps. (https://archiveofourown.org/works/24113185) Feel free to read and comment!
“I’m sick.” he simply replied. “Really sick.”
No, choice two and three were impossible. Not only was what he had done considered a crime, but he would also have to tell the world that Tony Stark, the mouthy Beta acting like an Alpha, was actually an Omega.
am talking, Steve. Your Alpha ass will listen to me now, for once in your life!”
“Yeah, he can stay.” Tony nodded.
He nodded at that. True, Steve might have not always been decent, but he was better than those men in Afghanistan. He had comforted him, made him some milk. He was holding him and had not made a fuss because of his nose.
- sat next to his new Alpha, head held low. He didn’t talk and just remained in the same position. Judging by his make-up, he’d been allowed to freshen up a bit after his first night. The bonding mark was clearly visible, as was the despair in his eyes. Steve didn’t know what to think of it. Well, he did. This boy was merely a child, not old enough to get pulled into this shit, or any shit for that matter.

alpha before who would want to miss the heat of his mate. But he figured Tony’s circles were quite different in that regard. Probably the reason why richer folks didn’t have too many children. “Look, I wanted to go to the store with you anyway. We need some things for you.”
A sharp noise had him flinch. The glass he’d been washing up had slipped from his fingers and was covering the floor in shards. He stopped breathing. The whole world slowed down.
“Yes, you do. You have some influence, surely.”
“It’s like a newspaper, Capsticle. I just wanna read the news.”
Immediately he shook the thought from his head. Not happening. He would not like this. Steve was helping him through this shitty heat. After that, he would probably pay him to shut his mouth and everything would be okay again. Or at least he hoped so. He had to hope because his mind got cloudy again.
It was rare that it happened but not
His expression was unreadable and for a brief moment, Tony thought he’d turn him down. Finally. Some common sense.
If there was something he knew, then that not many people were really concerned about what happened to his kind as long as the population grew. And she was Beta, so the whole conflict would not have to affect her at all.
He pushed down his hospital gown and decided to stare at a blank space on the wall. All of this was so embarrassing. He knew he wasn’t the only one feeling this way and that most Omega men couldn’t wait to finally have their flat chest back. he was no exception. His breasts had not gotten big (thank god) but they were there. That was enough to feel awkward. His back was turned away from the hospital door so that even if someone (Steve) entered without knocking, he wouldn’t see.
“Rhodey jr. or James?” he asked with a grin before he thought about it. “You know what? Nice idea. Say hello to Jamie.”

“They are kicking.”
“I will wait until you are done.”
decision what’ll happen to them.”
Hey guys, yet another chapter!
"Is that the 1940s version of it?" he tried in an attempt to find his humour again.
Steve clenched his jaw, clearly humiliated by Tony’s words in front of the doctor.
Steve glared at him again, not quite sure what he wanted to say with that. Didn’t he want someone to watch him eat? “The pan is empty.”
“That’s enough.” He wrapped his hand around Tony’s wrist and pushed him on the bed. “Put off your shirt.”
As always, thank you so much for supporting me with comments and kudos, it's a real motivator to keep on going!
“Yeah…” it was like he had no energy left to give him a witty remark. He was pregnant. Him. He was no longer the Tony Stark he had loved to be. No, if he would have to keep the pups, he was damned to stay at home and take care of them. Even if Steve finally stopped being an abusive piece of shit, he would never take care of them. No, he would basically be a single parent.

“It’s just a club, Tony,” he said as if his mate was an impertinent child that didn’t want to go to bed.
I should raise him with a British accent.”
that you still breathe.”
“Me too.” He didn’t. “Bye, Rhodey.”
“Please.” Tony was kneeling on the wet floor of the ensuite bathroom next to the room. “Please, anything.
“No suppressants. It’s… birth control. Just birth control, I-”
“You’ll sleep on the floor tonight. Only good Omegas get a bed.”
He fell asleep with the feeling that everything would maybe work out. Maybe.
He still stared at the shards. Only now his knees gave in and he tried to collect them with his hands. He didn’t know where the broom was or if he was allowed to use it. He didn’t know if Steve wanted him to stand on the shards or have him beg on the streets until he had enough money to replace it. All punishments he could imagine.
The next thing Tony felt was the cold water on his face and his aching lungs. He couldn’t breathe, couldn’t breathe, couldn’t breathe, couldn’t-
“Name?”
Conflict and he didn’t care too much either since she had never treated him any less than Steve. Something very rare, if he was honest. Most of the time she had even asked Steve to wait outside.
“Who the hell gave them to you?
“Don’t even end the sentence, Fury.” Tony stood. “You have agents for that shit. If you even think I will go to the OPP alone without my suit, you’ll goddamn-”
“Of course. Are there other questions at the moment?”
After he had finished his milk, Steve led him back to bed. it was 03.23 AM. “Your nose…”

Tony and Steven get into their first OPP party.
He could picture him perfectly. He could see him at an abandoned park bench doing nothing but stare at people and trying to sketch them as fast as he could. He wondered if the people would notice, if they
The person frowned, not sure what to think of the scenario. “Did I interrupt something?”
He hadn’t screamed, he hadn’t hit him. It left him relieved and confused at the same time. After a hot shower, he put on tight black trousers and a tight shirt. His parents had packed his clothes. There was not one comfortable piece for him. But it didn’t matter. He used the time Steve needed to shower to put his clothes into the wardrobe. He had eight sets of lingerie. Maybe he would like another pair next time. He shoved the one with the stars to the back of the closet.
Steve talks to Tony.
“I was hoping you’d say that, Rogers. Now, I think we should discuss the formalities tomorrow. For now, you should probably go and discuss this.”
“If… If it’s possible?”
He had needed some preparation until he’d gone to SHIELD: He had put a binder around his chest to flatten it (there was no way he’d let them see that) and put on an old suit of his father that had been too big for him even when he’d been on suppressants. It was a good way to conceal his curves though. The amount of aftershave he put on so the others wouldn’t smell him was ridiculous. The suppressants had also suppressed his scent and Tony wasn’t really down for snide comments.
Bucky didn't understand why Steve was so set on this promotion. Yes it paid more, but it was all the way in Manhattan and he didn't even know who he would be working for! And the job description was so vague, what if it turned out he had to, like, blow some old dude? That could
When he walked into the kitchen only Bruce and Natasha were there, both surprised but not both showing it.
He sped forward as fast as he could, cringing when Barton hit a balcony on his way down. Judging from the pained grunt audible over the comms, Clint was injured.
Like he was stuck in a fairy tale, the curse would be broken if someone loved him enough to promise eternity. Or that's what the bullshit curse said anyway. Promise eternity. He thought about telling Pepper, she would probably marry him to cure him. But then she would be stuck with him forever and he didn't want to do that to her. She deserved better.
Natasha wasn't so subtle and simply stared at Tony with a raised eyebrow. "So you're gonna lock yourself away anytime you and Steve fight?"
Also, thank you all so much for your support, it truly means a lot.
Thor goes upstairs to his bedroom to play video games and talk to his wrestle friends. Mother goes to sleep early, she often gets up early for her work.
The genius mutters just before the screen turns black.
Visiting her was the only change that stuck. After discussing everything with Steve, Tony decided he did want to talk to a shrink. After all, that hadn't been behaviour healthy and he knew it.
Of course. This was it. They were over. And here he was, waiting up for the boyfriend that just dumped him.
Natasha took over and tased Steve multiple times, leaving him twitching on the floor.
Leave a comment :*
His father had put Work on one, Reputation on two, Money on three, Friends on four. It went on like that for quite some time. Until finally Legacy at seventeen, and Tony at eighteen.
The smaller man backed up and fled the workshop.
They knew.
"Really." James promised softly before placing a fond kiss on top of Tony's head. "Can you- Can you tell us what he did to you? This wasn't the first time he hit you was it?" Bucky asked softly.
Friday evening the crew comes over, how will Loki react?
"Sir, I do not think-"
Yeah he had worked hard throughout his life, but no one else saw it like that. And rightfully so. Pulling a forty hour working spree to finish a new design was hardly comparable with people working three jobs to support their children.
"May I come in?"
The blond swallowed thickly before speaking up. "Yes miss, I do apologise but I seem to have missed who exactly I'll be working
Honestly, if Steve hadn't seen half of this stuff in person, he would have assumed miss Potts got hit on the head.
The embarrassed genius wanted to go hide in his workshop, but Bucky convinced him to go to the common room. The two brunettes ended up curled together on the soft couch.
"I'm sorry I didn't tell you about my Christmas plans." Tony whispered at the same time as Steve spoke up.
Page 2
Steve brushed a hand through the messy brown hair and smiled sadly when Tony leaned into the touch while brown eyes widened in shock.
Romanov eyed Clint's expression and heard the slight slurring in Tony's voice. "I'll go next." She said calmly and wasn't surprised when Clint frowned.
"But Brucy..." Stark whined. "He has been avoiding me ever since-"
James moved back into the bathroom and gently tugged Tony out from underneath the cold water, wrapping arms around the shaking man and whispering soft kind words. "You're safe Tony. I've got you babe. Deep breaths. You're in Stark tower, New York. Penthouse.
Tony sniffles adorably and nods softly, his brain an absolute mush after all the emotions coming over him in the past week.
I hope it doesn't disappoint :*
It all hurts so much. The words spewed during the slight beating that followed the cuts spin around in my head. It's always the same. I should be grateful.
The sound of something breaking broke the silence, coming from what Steve thought would be the kitchen.
Loki paled and started to shake slightly, Barton was reading it. No. Nobody was allowed to know how worthless he was. No.
Phil Coulson was a very observant man, which made him very good at his work. He looked from a slightly distressed and worried Bruce, to an unknown student who screamed issues.
I like the kids from that group but they're not in my class." He pouted. "Can't I just go to the other class daddy?"
Bruce heads to the library. But there are more than just books present...
Bucky showed up at Natasha's door one evening, looking both angry and nervous, sad and upset. "Natalia... I- I think Stevie... Steve isn't the same person anymore. I barely recognise him. And Tony-" The normal stoic soldier had to take a deep breath to calm his voice. "Tony seems to get hurt more often than anyone." The last sentence was a whisper. As if sharing a secret he was afraid to share.
Tell me what you think of Thor's response!
"No!"
When Tony finally drifted back to the surface, his bed was empty. Of course. He should have expected that but it just... It hurt. A lot.
important and he had to make sure it didn't get damaged.
Pepper Potts stood in the door opening looking absolutely
"No please... I don't have anywhere else to go. Please let me talk to him. I can be good. I can! Please I will apologise. I will behave. I can be good. I promise. I didn't mean to be bad." Loki rambled in obvious panic. "Please allow me to go back. Please..." The student trailed off as he realised... There was nothing Phil could do if Odin said he didn't want Loki anymore.
Those three idiots finally get around to actually talking.
He doesn't quite
Of a happy ending.
I'm so sorry for the long wait,
Tony felt cold dread spread through his chest. Oh god. What if Peter asked Steve to take him away? What if Peter hated him? Or wasn't happy? Or- shit.
And Loki didn't understand. Was this what was suppose to happen? Would he have avoided punishment if he had been kinder? It was a classic, Phil had said, apparently it was normal for children without parents to do all the work.
Secondly, he had to make Thor believe them. This proved a lot more difficult than anticipated.
A true love kiss???? Was he kidding???
Clint couldn't stand it anymore. He sent Nat and Bucky a message with his phone.
Ps. I love your comments :)
After grabbing a bottle of scotch, Tony headed to bed. He was done with the day. Done with the holiday.
Tony tilted his head slightly, Steve thought it was cute, which he really shouldn't think about.
The blond soldier sat down at Tony's bedside and took his hand again. "Hey Tony, good to see you awake. How are you feeling?"
The archer say down in the edge of her bed and ran a hand through his hair. "I wanted to grab something to eat. Saw him sitting in the common room. Thought he might want some company. He... Nat... I think he was in the middle of a panic attack while a fresh bruise was forming in his face. I asked him about it, he said it was a sparring accident."
To say he was surprised would be the understatement of the year.
The day already began strange. Phil had helped Loki up the stairs the previous night, made him take his meds, and showed him a small but comfortable guestroom with a small bathroom attached to it that held a shower and a sink. There was just a bed with soft light blue sheets, a dresser, a nightstand, a mirror, some landscape painting, and... A window. A big widow that could open, with nice green curtains.
He would be
Bruce followed in quite a similar matter only he immediately got dragged to a nice fancy shiny lab and proceeded to not leave the space for the next three days.
I could say I'm sorry for the last chapter, but I would be lying.
"I am not certain... The tales merely mention dreams of desire and love." Thor looked very confused, and Pepper looked up with a frown.
Iron Man flew around shooting the swarm of big fat birds, ignoring Clint's comments about Angry Birds.

"-on your left!!"
Stark loved both Steve and Bucky, they both deserved to be happy. Maybe it wasn't that bad if he could watch the two men he loved be happy together. Only... Not yet.
All eyes turned from the screen towards the god who appeared larger than life.
"Ah, the magic of the curse does offer some clues. Most victims speak of odd dreams and desires fuelled by pure instinct." Thor explained and frowned when Steve took a step back in shock.
Steve snapped out of his shock when someone flicked his nose. "Hey!"
Of course his thoughts immediately jumped to Steve, good pure gorgeous
Once alone, Tony realised his hand was bleeding and sighed, what a shitty day. As he looked through the kitchen cupboard for a first aid kit, he heard a knock on the open door.
Tony didn't understand what the big deal was, he'd do it again any day.
Steve stares at the screen with wide eyes while Tony isn't even looking at the camera anymore.
Bruce had been listening in shock. He recognised Loki's way of thinking all too well, thinking there was no way out. But now he knew, there were solutions.
He was trying to fool himself, but what else could he do?
He passed the kitchen and froze in place. The whole counter was filled with bowls and plates stacked with food. Cold food.
"Oh no, we're all trying. Come on Stark. You're not a coward are you?"
Tony would later blame his exhaustion on the soft nod he gave, blame his intoxication on the way he easily let Steve drag him along and put him on the couch besides the others.
"No. It is not normal to have to do all the work. Everyone has chores, some more than others, but making one person do everything is wrong."
"Sir? I mean, mister Coulson, c-could I... Maybe... B-borrow the wheelchair? I ca-can't..." He could roll the wheelchair towards Coulson's home. If he could find it. Hopefully it wouldn't be too far. He was just so tired.
"Tony? Is that true?" The soldier asks softly while looking down at the shivering man in his arms.
Alas, after way too many weeks stuck in that room, Tony was allowed to go home.
), and the Avengers were all living in Tony's tower. It was... nice. Weird, but nice.
The engineer enjoyed his relationship and worked hard to postpone the moment he'd end up alone again. Because if Steve left, the whole team would follow.
So he would just have to change that then.
The beeping of the heart monitor slowed down until- "No!!"
Apparently it wasn't some new crazy genius. It was an old crazy genius.
It's a strange world they're living in.
If anyone noticed the small shiver running down Tony's spine they didn't say anything. "Missed you too." He answered softly.
He had literally created a killer robot. There was more blood on his hands than of any of the team members combined.
Not to mention, Steve was kind and caring. Even more stubborn than Tony.
About three long hours later a Quinjet was landing on Tony's private beach. Steve came running out while the engines were still running and climbed the stairs up to the mansion at record speed.
"I'm also glad you came back."
Tony swallowed thickly before answering. "We've talked about this Peter, the workshop is dangerous. Go play with your Legos for a bit, I'm almost finished with work, I'll come join you for lunch soon alright?"
The afternoon passed in peace. Loki adjusted to not expecting a hit at any second, while Phil adjusted to another person living in his house. It was easier for the latter than it was for the former.
So here's another chapter for you lovelies, hope you'll enjoy it!
Steve just smirked smugly. "Never even crossed my mind."
"Fuck." He cursed out loud, running a shaking hand through his hair. There was still time, Peter was only six. Tony could still fix this. He'd give Peter a normal childhood, or as normal as he could living with the avengers. No more workshop.
Howard talking down on him and smacking him around a little when he fucked up again, didn't compare to being beaten to a bloody pulp on a daily bases.
I must honestly admit, from all the chapters I have written so far, this is not my favourite.
Peter stared at Tony as if he was an idiot, a look the six year old was way too good at. "
Tony blinks surprised and just nods. He should probably say something about Steve not owning him anything, but he's way too curious and kind of an asshole, so instead he just follows Steve as he heads to his floor. What kind of secret has Steve been keeping?
They had all expected there would have to be a lot of begging and bribing before Tony would talk. Perhaps it was the exhaustion, or just the emotional turmoil he had been through, but Tony talked.
He had been silent ever since.
"Tony, for the last time, Steve doesn't hate you." Bruce said tiredly, rubbing the bridge of his nose while trying very hard not to smack his best friend.
The genius tried to breath deeply as the suit wrapped around him and had Jarvis increase the level of oxygen in his suit.
Fast forward a few months and Steve was able to walk into the workshop whenever he wanted. To talk, or just to sit and sketch. The two got along really well, they became very good friends. It wasn't until Coulson pointed out that they had to register their relationship for SHIELD, that they realised they had been going on dates for quite some time.
"Who did that?" Bruce asked a little tense. Someone didn't just get a blue eye.
Steve rested a hand on Tony's hair and smiled. "I want to stay. Now sleep Tony, you need it."
The CEO stayed behind while Steve and Natasha entered the dimmed room.
Alas, Natasha became better at it and could soon identify the difference between real emotions and his masks.
Loki simply nodded as he did not understand Coulson's response. Was he not allowed to shower?
Anyway, you couldn't blame Tony for flinching. Not when everything seemed so bright and the world was spinning a little. "I'm fine Steve." Maybe he was slurring a little. He might have had a few drinks. And even he knew the combination of no sleep, alcohol, and caffeine was not healthy.
"Loki? Did you make me dinner?" Coulson asked gently and carefully, he had a gut feeling as to why. But he very much hoped to be wrong.
Pepper's cries could be heard behind him, muffled against Thor's chest.
The chatter continued until everyone was seated at the dining table. Loki rolled in and bit his bottom lip. Would he be allowed to sit with them? After all, this was their safe place to hang out. Should he really be here uninvited and unwanted? He could go without dinner, he had had two meals today. He would be fine.
On the far left was a boy with brown curls and glasses, he was curled up on himself a little, and smiling shyly at the jokes the others made. Sometimes he made a soft comment that would make the others roar with laughter. His name was Bruce Banner.
The first camera showed the conversation between Steve and Bucky in the livingroom.
It was a regular day for Tony when things changed. He had just put Peter to bed, they had worked on a robot dog together and almost got it to work. The boy had bargained for two stories in exchange for taking a bath, and Tony had grinned and complied. So the engineer exited his son's room with a sappy grin, a warm feeling in his chest that he always had when spending time with Peter. He considered going back to the 'shop to get some work done but decided he wanted to spend some time with the rest of his makeshift family instead. Mostly with Steve if he was honest with himself.
The brunette sat down on a chair in the corner between two bookshelves and curled up, taking deep breaths to calm his racing heart. The combination of someone big and imposing, yelling, and defending a father... it didn't work out for him.
Tony scoffed and used everything he remembered about his press days to appear nonchalant and arrogant, instead of heartbroken. "You would have thought wrong. Things have gotten way too personal. We aren't friends. You work for me. Potts might claim otherwise, but I'm still the one who's signing all the checks. I needed an assistant to bring me stuff and fetch my dirty laundry, not one to try and get friendly."
If there was anything Tony was good at it was avoiding his problems until they either went away or bit him in the ass.
Coulson arrived at the mall quickly and went straight to the nearest clothing store. It wasn't anything fancy, they just sold basics, exactly what Phil needed. He roughly guessed Loki's size and bought a few pair of pants, some shirts, underwear, and socks.
Page 3
I'm afraid I may have one again now, but at least I have three chapters to post for you all. Which I will do during Christmas break.
Quite tempting...
And yet... the hero flinched when he heard the elevator doors open earlier than they should. There he was. Captain America.
Steve had to go.
"Of course we are." Coulson answered the young adult with a small smile. It would be good for Loki anyway, to be around people who understood. People who wouldn't judge or harm him.
It was a long shot. The answer was most likely no, but Pepper had to try. And judging by the stubborn twitch in Steve's jaw, he would be right there with her.
Loki goes to destroy his essay, but does he get the chance? Or will help be sent his way?
Loki just froze. "No one... I walked against a door." He whispered.
And that's when it started. Thor had sat down, and Coulson started talking. First he had to figure out if Thor knew anything about the abuse going on. The genuine shock and surprise suggested that was a no.
"I got it Loki, thanks." Coulson said with a smile, assuming Loki came to help him.
Jesus fuck. Steve had an Iron Man fanpage. Well that certainly explained some things.
Romanov practically did her own physical exam, leaving only half an hour later with a few pictures and a few notes on the back of them.
to a whole new level.
"I'm sorry." The student whispered once seated back in his wheelchair. This time while Phil grabbed his keys from his pocket, Loki wrung his hands nervously. And when Phil unlocked the doors to his precious Lola, there was a soft voice speaking up.
That night when he sat on their- well, on
With those words, the genius downed his drink and slammed his glass down too hard, shattering it in pieces. "Fuck", he mumbled annoyed. The light in his chest was not doing great. It was flickering more often, and dimmed more and more each day. At this pace, Jarvis estimated he only had about a month left, maybe two. Impossible to find someone to love him for, well, him. Not his former looks or ever growing fortune.
The arm was first of all, very very skinny. Then there was an angry red, marking the pale skin. Rather fresh scratches were framed by dark bruises. They were obviously untreated and a few of them already looked too red and swollen. Underneath them were thin scars, Bruce recognised those all too well from Clint's arms.
I hope you like it, enjoy, and as always; be aware of your own triggers!
But this... Loki Odinson. The worst case of abuse she had every seen or heard of. It was as if every single thing she ever encountered was applied to this single person. She could not imagine how anyone could have gone through that without going insane. The list she had made was seemingly endless.
"It does. For me." He eventually answered. He had no worth after all, so a few punches in trade for a house, clothes, and college, was nothing.
Tony Stark was not number one.
Clint looked ashamed while Phil shook himself for not realising. Coulson nodded gratefully to Natasha, who simply nodded back. They all had a rough past, least they could do was look out for each other.
Finally the time was there. Three weeks of continues working had lead to a gorgeously decorated Malibu mansion, a shiny new bike in the garage, a massive Christmas tree in the living room, a pile of gifts for the Avengers ready to be shipped to New York, and one exhausted Tony Stark smiling happily.
. "A bit out of hand? According to Friday, Tony has been drunk for the past week. Now, I'm going to fix this mess, and afterwards you're going to grovel. Understood?"
Thor looked insulted and sounded like it as well. "Stark, mind your words. My father is an honourable man. And I shall not have you insult him as such. His word is truth."
Tony couldn't help but smile softly when he saw Bucky and Steve waiting for him by the car, both looking at the genius with fond smiles. Bucky was practically smirking while Steve helped Tony stand up and wrapped an arm around his waist.
Bucky nodded with a small frown. "I promise as well."
Steve tenses and has to suppress the urge to growl. "And,
Bruce was actually surprised Tony wasn't slurring yet, for he appeared very drunk while mumbling the words seemingly to himself.
The second Tony left the room, Natasha had slapped Clint on the back of his head and hisses angrily at him in Russian.
This time when Tony opened his eyes he could make out two silhouettes, one at each side. Steve on his right, Bucky on his left, both holding his hand carefully and looking damn worried.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was obvious the thin boy didn't like having attention drawn to him, and therefore Phil turned to Bruce first. "How may I help you Bruce?" He asked in his every calm voice as he motioned for both boys to have a seat.
The blond does look intently at the genius and frowns again. "Tony... Are you sure this is what you want? I... You don't have to do this. You don't have to sacrifice anything. You deserve to be happy."
8:40 - first class
Tony looked at Steve knowingly before replying. "Still, you've been incredibly good at your job, and you've dealt with my shit without explanation. I just- Jarvis told you about the curse right? And- Well, some days, it's more? I- It's harder to- fight off the instincts. And- shit, it's not an excuse. But I wanted to apologise, for what happened that first time. I'm sorry for scaring you. And I'm glad you stayed after." There was a twitch in Tony's limbs as he spoke, as if he was cutting off subconscious movements continually.
Okay so maybe Steve was freaking out a little. After a strange first day that mostly consisted on getting to know the lay-out of the top two floors, talking to Jarvis, and bringing Mister Stark lunch, Steve had gone home in a daze.
"Are there any possessions there that-" Phil wanted to ask but he got interrupted by Loki.
"Bucky?" Ah... There was Bucky... Kneeling by his side shouting orders while ripping the suit off to access the wound on his chest.
"Until we can have your stuff picked up, you'll need some basics. I'm going to get some groceries for the weekend, make yourself at home. You can watch a movie or whatever you want. I'll be back before dinner." Phil explained calmly as he already made a mental list from what they would need.
would be coming out. And indeed it did. "No buts. Peter thinks you're mad at him. You're worrying, which proves you're nothing like Howard. Now go to your kid and start finishing that darn robot dog before I ask Bruce to finish it."
A loud whistle was heard just as Steve dropped the card.
Just an hour after asking if explaining things to Thor would be alright, some new people were present in the office. Loki was still seated in his wheelchair and now positioned besides Phil's desk, said man sitting on his spot behind the heavy wooden piece of furniture.
Basically; he was an idiot. "Steve-o, I need you to answer me something straight. It's important alright? Promise you'll answer honestly?" Tony asked surprisingly serious.
He hadn't even gotten Tony a present.
Loki had the five sheets of paper clutched close. He was going to burn the last three, and hand in the first two. That way Coulson wouldn't find out about the beating. Or the cutting. Or the strapping. Or the words.
"Done Sir." Jarvis said calmly before breaking the silence again with a surprisingly hesitant voice. "Sir? If I may be so bold, why will Captain Rogers wish to leave the penthouse in the tower?"
Steve is now fidgeting with the edge of his shirt as he looks at Tony look at the page.
Silence filled the mansion as Tony stared at the mistletoe he was still holding.
"I don't... I don't understand." The genius whispered softly, not taking his eyes off Steve in case this was all just some messed up dream.
Another moment of silence until Steve finished and put the rest of the supplies back in the kit. When he stood up and headed for the door, Tony cleared his throat.
Tony held his hands up in defense. "Maybe, but I did just discover a new element so I think I deserve a break."
Their dates were calm, slow, some would even say boring. Alas, with a life as hectic as theirs, boring was perfect.
Tony just knew things would end in flames. He would annoy Steve until the breaking point and be pushed aside. It was inevitable.
Bucky looked up when Clint made a sad sound and swallowed thickly. "It gets worse." The brunette whispers pained. "I saw him stitching up a cut on his arm. And one on his leg once. I caught him wrapping his ribs up. And- oh god... I'm pretty sure he's afraid of Steve. Whenever the punk would walk in, Tony would close off. Shy away. It's, it's heartbreaking to see. I thought- I thought Tony was getting hurt but that Steve was helping him through it. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm doubting that punk is good for Tones. This can't go on like this. We need to help him. Please."
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve took a second to clear his throat before telling the Artificial Intelligence to play it.
Not at all.
His reply was cut short by Bruce pointing down at the ground below. "Guys, look." He mumbled while pointing to two figures walking through the gates.
All he saw when he looked at his hands was red these days.
"Tony?" He whispered shocked, getting a weak smile in return.
Tony takes a sip of coffee, sighing and pulling his shirt aside to look at the blue gem in his chest, dimmed and dull and flickering on and off randomly. "Let's hope so."
The remaining evening was spent on the couch with a movie.
"You'll be working a few floors up, so allow me to walk you there as I explain some more." The new CEO of SI said calmly.
Let me know if you liked the edits and want me to do that again in the future!
On the brunette's left was his boyfriend. Broad shoulders, a warm smile, and blond hair always perfectly combed. He blushed whenever Tony made a flirting remark, and made sure no one did anything to get them into trouble. Unless it was fun of course. He wasn't a boyscout, even though his boyfriend insisted he must be. His name was Steven Grant Rogers.
"Loki...? Loki, what's wrong? We can watch another movie. But I promise you, everything will be alright." The captain of the football team whispered softly.
When the door to his workshop opened and Steve walked in, all bright eyes and carrying food, Tony almost stopped himself again.
him whenever you wanted?"
Until an arm wrapped around him and held him close to a nicely tanned chest.
Steve wrapped his hands around his mugs and frowned lightly. "You do not have to apologise Sir, I understand-"
Loki set the table, his ankles were throbbing by the time he had gotten a glass and plate from the cabinets, and rolled back to the livingroom.
The dark haired student took a moment to simply sit and rest his aching muscles. He remembered miss Potts telling him to take his painkillers regularly, but she had only given him a dozen or so. If he took them now, while the pain was still manageable, he would no longer have any by the time he would really need them.
"Ever since he found out you're actually Iron Man, yes I know, you've only mentioned that about a hundred times in the past week." Doctor Banner interrupted the other brunette and calmly took a sip of his tea, already knowing what Tony was going to say.
But I have gotten pretty good at making breakfast, so I didn't make any mistakes this morning. I hate making mistakes, burning food is the worst. Burns really hurt.
"Tony? I brought bagels from that little bakery you like so much." Steve says cheerfully as he walks into a surprisingly dark workshop. Tony isn't in his usual spot, nor is he laying under one of his cars... The lack of loud music leaves an eery silence behind, making goosebumps form on Steve's arms. "Tony?" He tries again.
Sure she was probably joking, but Tony almost agreed with her.
"Tones, thanks."
He appeared tense and nervous which only worsened as Steve walked in. The Captain greeted Natasha kindly and rested a hand on Tony's shoulder. "You should get some sleep. Come on Tony."
He looked down at his watch and decided to get some take out, too tired to cook once he would get back home.
And be careful!! This is a dark chapter!
In a world with aliens and magic, fangs and a fur almost seemed normal.
After showing up in Stark tower without warning, Steve had spent all his time with his best friend.
Thor was looking pissed off and started talking. Luckily they had their own spy. Bruce and Tony had developed hearing aids for Clint that could pick up sounds very far away. So they kept silent while Clint listened to what Thor was saying...
is worried."
Loki's first birthday after getting out of there?
"I... I'm allowed in the car? But... There are o-only t-two seats." That would mean he would sit next to Phil... He was supposed to sit in the back. On an old towel or a newspaper, and that was if he was allowed in the car.
Eventually Loki decided to stay in his room and set to get dressed. Coulson had left all his new clothes on top of the dresser. And so the student only had to reach over to grab a soft shirt and a pair of jeans before limping into the bathroom and grabbing a quick shower.
With Steve gone, Tony could think more clearly. Whenever the PA would be close, Tony's instincts screamed at him to do weird shit. Like drag Steve to his bed. Or
Until Tony fucked up.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I'm not-"
Bucky seemed worried when he arrived from work and found Steve staring ahead.
Odin left, and he took my blanket. The door is locked again, and the lights are out.
He just didn't care anymore.
Instincts? Steve had never thought about that before. Jarvis did explain the curse, how it turned Tony's DNA halfway animalistic. But aside from the obvious physical changes, nothing had appeared different. "No Sir, it's alright. I wasn't scared, just startled. If I may ask... I just- Jarvis mentioned people were working on a cure?"
"I'll see you tomorrow morning Tony. Don't forget to sleep."
From that first day as Pepper's assistant, it had been difficult to read Tony Stark. He was very skilled in hiding his emotions. It was... slightly disturbing.
Steve looks so adorably confused, Natasha's words fill Tony's mind and he decides to go for it. They've been exchanging personal information for a bit now, might as well continue the trend.
Tony leaves for Miami, giving Steve and Bucky their space...
She had worked for the university for years now. And she had seen many things in her days.
Steve's shoulders slumped after he hung up and he heard the phone creak in protest to slowly being crushed.
"-earth to Stevie, hello!"
Avengers assemble.
"You absolute
Obviously his human brain appreciated the view. Steve was adorable, a cute firecracker who would probably kick his ass if he ever called him that.
"Listen," Steve says. He stopped whittling ages ago; now he lets the tools fall onto the table at his side and twists in his seat, leaning towards Tony. "I know that both of us knew this would be moving real quick, but you only just saw the place. If you don't want to get married tomorrow, that's fine. You can stay here while you make up your mind, or I can get you a room at the hotel in town. Like I said before, Mister Jarvis is welcome to stay as long as he likes. I know – I know we both knew this was going to be fast, but Tony, don't do anything you don't want to do. Don't do something you're going to regret."
Still no reply.
Steve swallows. It always hurts to talk about Bucky, but he managed to say that whole thing without a catch in his voice. "It was."
It doesn't take long for him to tire this time. He starts thinking about it, and realizes how long it's been since he's run. The only reason does is when he wakes from a nightmare, and for a while now he hasn't needed to go for a run after waking and writing to Tony instead. Huh.
One good morning was more than he ever thought he'd get. One time being as close to Steve as physically possible and both of them overwhelmed with pleasure was beyond his wildest dreams. Things like that don't happen in Tony Stark's life, and they sure as hell don't happen twice. So if this morning was the only time sex is ever going to be like that -
There had been a brief moment of complete terror when Tony realised he was going home. After all, what if Steve and Bucky had only stuck by him out of pity? Or because they didn't want to give him bad news while in the hospital? What if they would leave him as soon as he had healed up?
Loki stayed silent for a long time, and just as Phil wanted to open his mouth to say something else, he spoke up. "Okay. Yes... Okay."
"Tony."
His heart was aching, his head throbbing, he felt like absolute shit. "Jarvis?" God his voice was all cracked and pitiful. "Where's Steve?"
When he heard the door open and Coulson entering, he paled and immediately turned off the TV. Dammit. He hadn't been paying attention. He should have been helping unloading the car!
