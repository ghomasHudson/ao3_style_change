“Sure thing, I can help you figure out some things, if you want? Then you can use everything on your own”, he suggested, and the other man nodded in relief. “What is that you’re looking for?”
“So you and her..?”, Steve asked, pointing at Tony and then at the closed doors. “I’m sure she’ll warm up to you”
“Was it worth it then?” he asked as he closed the door of his room. “To travel here?”
Tony almost jumped back; he hated being touched, it reminded him of how others, even Steve in his own universe grabbed him to force him to listen to them. Bad memories, memories of his torture in the caves, of Stane touching him with those hands, of people who wanted nothing but hurt him. This Steve was no different. With his tall and stronger posture, he seemed more willing to strangle him if he had to than the Steve from back home.
Tony watched Steve carefully and nodded when Steve allowed him to continue, leaning forward to trail his tongue over the man’s defined muscles, worshipping every muscle of his body, admiring how well-built he was for someone who didn’t even follow such a strict training as himself.
“You didn’t have absolute faith in my tech? I’m offended, I really am!”, Tony joked, to which Steve replied with a chuckle.
Just like that, Tony Stark was gone yet again.
“I know what those nightmares are about”, Tony stopped him. “It’s about them, right?”
Steve held Tony’s arm lightly, looking at him in the moonlight that shimmered through the window and outlined his features even in the darkness. “It was worth it, just to spend more time with you.”
Tony was behind him, being unusually silent, but even him knew all about the sanctity of silence in moments like those. He watched the Captain walking slowly towards the large closet, holding the handles for a moment before opening it. He couldn’t see properly what was inside, but he didn’t want to intrude and disrupt Steve when he was clearly having a strong emotional moment. However, he was there for him, Steve knew that.
“Well if you wish so then it will happen,” Steve said, smiling down lovingly at Tony.
Steve’s eyes momentarily lingered on Tony’s hand. “Are you too tired to do what we had agreed?” He asked.
“I’m asking because if yes then, I’ll have to move, you know," he said, hoping that Steve would get the hint.
“Are you feeling better?”
“Really?” Steve asked. “I thought you would have marched with your army?”
“So, what’s next?”, he asked Tony as he was unstrapping him from the metal bed that he was placed on, flexing his arms and getting on his wheelchair once again.
Both him and Tony just stared at the spilled sand on the floor and the bag on the other side of the room, locking eyes with each other and starting to laugh.
“To make two demigods fall in love is not the right thing to do, especially these two,” the thunder god's son said as he shoved Cupid's son forward. “Now fix it.”
When Tony woke up, he didn’t want to disturb Steve; the man looked so peaceful and he couldn’t believe that they fell asleep like that. He wasn’t going to admit it, but that night he slept so peaceful, the disturbing nightmares not making an appearance to haunt him. He got up and started getting ready for the day, if the press conference was going to happen, he needed to look at his best at all times. Not wanting to make any further noise, he opened one of his laptops in his bedroom, surprised to find a mail from Zola, announcing that he would take over the press conference that day. Tony narrowed his eyes; that was his job, scientists weren’t meant for those things, they worked behind the scenes, he was the one to flash smiles in front of the cameras and throw one liners that would make them top quotes of the day. It was time to do some heavy investigating work; they didn’t call him a genius for nothing. For a top secret government organisation, they sure didn’t take into account that Tony was able to track them down and hack their data in seconds. Getting access into Zola’s email communication was a piece of cake; the more he started to go through his conversations with people, the more suspicious he became. There were some boring, normal conversations in German that he skimmed through, but things got interesting when he saw Steve’s name mentioned.
Steve scratched the back of his head, confused. “I enjoy it, yes, but our deal...” he said, not knowing how to respond. “I have a promise to my mother too, but my duty to protect my home comes first. I would give myself up for my people, if that is what you wish.”
“You can at least pretend that I'm here, you know. Now just let me go, and nobody gets harmed.”
“Sushi? Oh, you’re going to love it, everyone does”, Tony said with a light gesture, even though that was an understatement. “It’s going to be here in an hour or so.. the food I mean. Then you’ll have a perfect verdict”, he said as he turned on the TV and changed channels quickly when he saw that “Back to the Future” was playing. Steve didn’t need any time travel related movies at that point.
“But… he wasn't… you need to see this with your own eyes.”
That proud smile was so contagious, and Tony found himself returning it, pulling his boyfriend down for a praising kiss. It tasted extra sweet, tasting the melt candy, licking his lips when they finally pulled away from each other. Before he could say anything, the loud clock was heard in the distance, signaling that it was midnight - Christmas was upon them.
Tony nodded. “Or die trying, like a true hero," he said, tightening his grip on Steve.
“Tony! Stop staring and go inside!”, Steve shouted as Tony froze in place, just looking at his once business partner being turned into a monster right before his own eyes.
“So you managed to bring him in, huh? What did you offer him? Something good, I hope”, a voice was heard from the top of the stairs.
When the rest of the crew came running, he got one of the thermal detectors, throwing it away after a couple of scans. What was he even doing? Of course the hero’s temperature wouldn’t have been preserved after so many years dead in the ice.
“I know that you can’t trust us willingly now, Captain Rogers. But I'm asking you to put everything at side for now and come at the Baxter Building. There is someone that you need to see.”
“We must learn while our minds are fresh,” Steve said, sitting up and adjusting to the grip around his waist, “while Apollo still rides his chariot across the sky; his presence will bless us.”
It seemed to be raining every single day. The sunshine that they sold everyone who moved into the suburbs of New York was an absolute lie yet so many people were buying it. There wasn’t much for him to do anymore, he hated going outside, yet his stay in the veteran hospital was an absolute nightmare. Others were glad to be there, among their fellow soldiers, who seemed to understand what they were feeling and going through at all times but this...this wasn’t for him. He wanted to be out there again, into the action, serving his country.
“I don’t think that you understand what is going on here…”
Leaving the building with his cheeks swollen and a solid dose of painkillers and anesthetics, he managed to take a taxi back to his apartment; the driver understood him, which took him by surprise. Staring at the bulge in his pocket caused by the napkin that he wrapped the tooth in, he remembered how excited he would be whenever the tooth under his pillow would disappear whenever he would lose another tooth. His mother would say that unfortunately the tooth fairy didn’t have enough money on her for him, but Steve found the idea of an actual fairy coming to take away his teeth whimsical. Of course he knew that his mother was the one to replace the tooth with a few coins, but he would always act so surprised; he knew his mother was working as hard as he could to afford a better life for them both.
Steve immediately aimed his own gun at her, her men doing the same but to him.
He nodded and yawned widely before standing beside Tony. “Ready to go.”
Tony shook his head as he breathed in and out, trying to recollect himself and not to show how shaken he truly was after the sights that he had just witnessed.
nobody else that could pleasure him and see him in such a state. With a deep breath, he let the helmet pull back, revealing his face as he kept his eyes on Steve, feeling his warm breath against his skin at last.
Tony looked at him with a little confusion. He didn't really care from anyone. Why should Steve be any different?  “These are public baths, Athenian,” he said. “We need no privacy for them. You know, we’ve been seeing each other training and bathing for years, it’s not really a big deal.”
“You’re welcome, after all, it’s not the first time that I took care of her, right?”, Tony said as he sat down by the nearby workshop bench.
“A doctor like... saving lives and such? No, I couldn’t see myself as one... But mathematics, physics, astronomy... those interest me; I’m just really curious, I want to know about everything,” Tony said with a hungry spark in his eyes.
Even with all the combined effort, everyone was getting tired, crushing down, panting.
Of course, it was far too late for Steve to know that, not when Tony made sure that he was returned back to the depths of the ocean where they first found him along with Janet and Hank, the only other team members available for that small ‘ceremony’. It wasn’t until he uttered those words himself that he realised that maybe after all, what he felt about Steve wasn’t just respect and admiration. During his time as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D he would spend hours locked in his office, thinking about everything that happened, reading the letter that Steve left for him over and over again. How could this happen? It wasn’t part of the plan, he was a futurist and yet he didn’t see Steve’s death happening. No, it wasn’t supposed to be like that, that was clear from the start. And yet, he had to deal with it, waking up from vivid nightmares, Steve’s chest wound right in front of him, or the way he looked at him when he was pinned down on the ground, shield raised, ready to hit him. He would see him in his sleep, he could feel Steve grabbing him, Tony would apologise and then he would just realise that.. this was all a dream. Even Maria Hill was concerned; Tony was breaking down and despite his efforts, it was plain to see. Still, he had to stand up and be Iron Man, especially with the rest of the public, not to mentions his former team, not being big fans of him anymore.
“Can I put one up?”, Steve asked again, kneeling to examine the different colours and writings on the locks.
The Captain didn't reply; he was lost in his thoughts, and besides, what else was there to say?
The room was large, decorated with blood red banners and all kinds of gadgets – telescopes, machinery, all manner of things that seemed pieced together from things Steve almost recognized – as well as large containers of wine.
“Like I said, you’re not experiencing any out of body experience or anything like that. I don’t know what you think it’s going on now, but you need to be seated inside about it. I know the serum prevents-”
Tony heard his words, the rest leaving little to the imagination, understanding why Steve seemed to be so shy. After all, if Steve hadn’t brought up the duty to his people and mother, maybe his dream could have become true when they were together back in Sparta. “And did you like what you see?” Tony asked him in a softer voice, approaching him even more, warm breath against Steve's skin.
“Jump in! You earned this!”, he smiled as he patted the seat next to him and took a slice of the extra cheesy pizza.
“I actually do like spending time with you too”, Steve said calmly.
“Morning”, Steve replied as he took a long sip. “I figured it out, don’t worry, nothing’s broken. And before you say anything, yes, I can read the instructions and follow them. Oh, and this coffee tastes great, thank you”
“There is no need to try, you resonate a natural determination,” Steve said as he stretched a little.
“Now if you excuse me, I have the next search party to prepare in about..”, he said, looking at his silver watch on his wrist. “5 hours. I’d rather shut my eyes for an hour or two before that”, he announced, shutting off the communication and taking off his large, dark blue parka that covered most of his face, especially when the goggles and hoodie were on. The only visible part of himself was his trademark beard that he carefully trimmed even in this cold weather.
Tony returned the smile and ran his fingers through the blonde’s hair. “Hey, that’s what I do”, he replied with a soft chuckle.
“Ouch. You don’t know how to have fun, do you? Poor guy”, Tony said, shaking his head.
“Are you?! Did you have your entire life taken away so those sick psychos could experiment on you? Did you?! I’m going after them.”
Tony felt the heat rising in his own cheeks as Steve seemed astonished by his actions, but the fact that he asked to reciprocate surprised him in such a pleasant way. “Yes,” he nodded sitting still as he kept his eyes on Steve's beautiful, heart shaped lips; the lips he'd just kissed. “Yes you can.”
“Of course not, Reed.”, Steve replied, shaking his head. His voice was eerie calm, haunting even. He was devastated, he had no idea why all this was happening and it shook him, finally realising how much Tony’s loss shook him. “How can I be… when all this is happening?”, he continued, gesturing at the numerous bodies around the room, not even looking at them now.
“And who looks older out of the two of us?”, Steve laughed.
“I haven’t,” Tony said with a nod, rubbing water against his arms. “And most certainly, not one who happens to be a demigod. Honesty is an appreciated quality, isn’t it?”
“I’m sure that you do, but now’s not the time. Hand over the Gauntlet, Tony, we can catch up later.”
Steve soothed the marks over with kisses once more. All this time he’d been yearning to love someone and now he finally could. What was more; the man was a fellow demigod, who shared responsibilities just as he did. Tony was someone who he could pour all of his emotions out to and Steve kissed his skin over and over, enjoying the faint blush on Tony's cheeks.
“Does...this make us friends?” Tony asked hesitantly, fighting the urge to rub his cheek against Steve’s hand, closing his eyes in satisfaction anyway. He was strangely comforted by Steve's warm palm touching his skin.
“We have come to correct you, to save you from yourself,” The large voice of the blonde man boomed, and then he gestured over to the brown haired archer, tugging him by the ear. “Or correct the mistake of this foolish demi god.”
“Tony!”, Steve shouted as the man ran closer to him. “My legs..”
Steve moaned even louder as he felt Tony’s breath against his ear, tilting his head back to try and feel him on his cheek. “Tony!” he cried out, encouraged by the pleasure surging through his body, and by Tony’s words, trying his hardest to push back to feel him deeper. His eyes would roll back if he were in any more pleasure.
Tony shook his head. “I didn’t touch a woman in the way you’re suggesting, no.”
“Is that right?” Tony huffed, and he shook his head. “Clearly those people need to see the real monsters out there. And do you agree with their characterization?”
Tony raised his hand, as if he was trying to catch Steve back, his fist closing tightly as the men set off. But not before he had met Steve’s eyes yet again, seeing the pain, disappointment and betrayal in them. He had never felt so guilty before in his life. He had killed before, he had destroyed homes, and yet breaking Steve’s heart seemed far worse. “I love you,” he said in a low voice as his eyes met the ground, shaking in frustration, letting out a loud cry and dropping on his knees, remaining there for a moment before grabbing a spear and running from the city.
“T-tony...” He whispered between a whimper.
And there it was, set on a big pillar, almost in ceremonial style.
Shaving felt so much nicer, as as him brewing coffee and sitting on the breakfast bar, eating his piece of toast and catch up with the news. Of course Tony was featured in them, apparently there was a press conference that he was going to hold and announce “a new direction for Stark Industries.” He patted his legs, getting himself ready for the day. Tony gave him directions to the Tower, but of course he was going to be able to spot the giant Tower from miles away.
“System activation for Captain Steve Rogers”, he commanded it to say, concealing his own voice as he waited for Steve’s reaction eagerly.
“I want you to keep your calm… I’m still trying to figure out what happened here…”, Reed warned Steve as the blond walked closer to the table.
Steve’s voice was loud and clear, he could tell that Tony needed the backup and he was offering it; he stood by what Tony believed anyway, he wouldn’t let someone who clearly had no good intentions to use something as dangerous as the formula that gave him his advanced skills and powers, it wasn’t something people could just play with. It was a potential weapon, and that’s how he was used back in the day in first place.
He didn’t have a chance to apologise, or better, he didn’t find an appropriate moment to bring this up. Much to his surprise, Tony didn’t seem to hold a grudge against him, but he really seemed like he expected something.
Steve looked at the man’s hand and held it instead. The moment he did, he same spark he felt when Tony first held his hand in front of Peggy’s grave returned, but he didn’t jolt back, instead he rubbed the back of the man’s hand, urging him to talk if he needed to.
Steve looked away, looked down and reached to play with a small tuft of grass, being sure to keep his eyes on it as his cheeks reddened. “It was just, pleasant,” he said. “I’ve never had a dream like it before.”
Steve nodded, moving close to the other bag and getting himself ready, before delivering another kick. This time, only a bit of sand came out, but the bag was still in place.
“Tony, Tony, Tony.. You arrived last night and didn’t even bring me a souvenir or made a call? That’s now how you were raised now, were you?”, the old man said with such a fake smile that made Steve instantly clench his fists in defence. His beard wasn’t as carefully trimmed as Tony’s, and his suit didn’t seem to fit him as well as Tony’s; in over all he seemed really pretentious and he didn’t like it, the patronising sound in his voice confirming that.
“You look as though you are prepared to leave this place, Steve,” his best friend said as he approached, footsteps echoing in the monumental structure.
Steve's expression turned more serious for a while, and then he glanced down momentarily to think. He was forbidden to fall in love. But he was sure his mother would understand that he was doing what he needed to do to protect his city. “Do you wish for us to be lovers, then?” he asked.
Steve’s eyes narrowed slightly and he remained huddled over Tony protectively, glaring at the two men. “I know who you are...”
Steve clumsily tried to lock their lips together in the type of kiss Tony had taught him. He groaned every time Tony thrust into him, and heard Tony's demand for more. He panted, pulling his hips back, rocking them back and forward harder and faster to meet Tony's thrusts. Now Tony was starting to reach his sweet spot with each thrust, and it caused him to call out Tony’s name enveloped in a long, drawn out moan.
He was woken up by the sound of the street outside; he didn’t open the window just before he went to sleep, but there it was, wide open. His back was turned, so he didn’t see the man who was standing behind him, frozen in place by the night table with his hand going for the napkin resting on top of it.
“Home sweet home, right?”, Tony replied, but the tone of irony in his voice was strong. “You ain’t seen nothing yet.. this is why we’re trying to save this world, Steve. Before it’s too late, as you can see from up here”
“Doric Style marbles,” Tony muttered as he walked along inside the Temple.
The glass wall lowered and Reed gave them a last look before the door slid shut behind them.
“What did he say? What happened to him?”, Steve asked, his attention back to Reed.
His threats were cut short when Steve’s vibranium shield hit his suit of armour, sending him a few metres back.
“Uh..thanks?”, Steve replied, looking slightly confused. “What..?”
Steve could feel his lower lip trembling, holding up his shield to knocking away a spear that was aimed at him. “You were more than that I fell in love with more than that!” he screamed back at him, eyes welling up as he pivoted on his foot to use his shield to knock away a Spartan that charged toward him.
Tony’s smile widened - of course he remembered that time - doing as he was told, he watched the marshmallow get toasted, curious as to what Steve had in mind. His curiosity was catered to when Steve asked him to open up, spooning the marshmallow that was so gooey, feeding him a piece and creating a small breach that lead to the hot chocolate, its sweet smell coming out from it.
Tony fluttered his wings, flying up close to Steve. “And if you’re not excited yet for tomorrow night...here’s a little taste of what you could expect..”
“I think they can manage on their own for a little while,” he said, even though he knew that he had to go back. “Come with me, to Sparta. I’ll treat you well, I swear it, and we’ll have that discussion over a feast, like I promised.”
“That’s now what I meant but… I feel that you do.”, the engineer continued. “You and him… you've got a long history, I can see that… and I can say for sure that… he did feel the same way…”
“Mr. Stark”, the sheriff replied, nodding politely. “Yes, Marshall Fury has indeed warned me about you, sir”
The Captain finally managed to look away, shutting his eyes painfully. He expected things to be bad, but this.. this wasn’t the place he loved and wanted to protect once, this was a living hell. And on top of that, according to Tony, he haven’t seen the worst. He dreaded going back to Brooklyn, even though the other man warned him not to. However, that was where he belonged, if he was going to start a new life in this century, he had to view every other part of his past first, mourn and then eventually let go. He tried not to think of that, that he couldn’t go back to what he lived before, but dismissed the thoughts when he noticed that Tony was staring.
That’s what they would say when trying to explain Tony’s broken heart. He wasn’t careless, but the moment that he let someone inside his walls, they were easily shattered and broken down. That’s what happened everytime that he decided to let someone handle his heart; there was never a happy ending to any of those stories.
“You never said that...”
Steve smiled just as brightly, “Do you mean that?”
“I wouldn’t put it like that.. we’re not in a phase where people walk around with oxygen support and huge anti-pollutant suits like astronauts do.. but that’s exactly what we’re trying to prevent here”
“In a good way?”
“Mr. Stane, I’m sorry to disappoint but Dr. Erskine was the founder of the serum, Mr. Stark merely helped with the equipment, not with the formula itself. And yes, the serum is still in fact working”, Steve replied calmly.
“No. You’re a recovering alcoholic.”, Steve growled; he would never forget his talk with Tony, watching him being so desperate for a sip from his bottle on the floor, unconscious when he busted into his hotel room in flames to rescue him.
“Yeah, of course I will”, he snorted as he put more pressure on Steve’s hips, his fingernails digging into the skin and leaving his red marks on it. “Do it for me, moan like you did for Iron Man”, he commanded.
“What…? He was my friend… he-“, Steve replied, startled with the sudden question.
Tony let go as soon as they reached the familiar gates of his home city, jumping off to lead Steve to his stables, helping him take care of the horses and his chariot. And, when they eventually resided in his chambers yet again, it was particularly late, the place in complete darkness. The city seemed to be sleeping.
Tony smiled widely at the prospect of being the only one worthy to witness that beauty, and then quickly shook his head, trying to dismiss the thought. “You don’t have to worry about that, there’s nothing wrong with it.”
Walking up the stairs proved to be a bit difficult, but he refused to take the elevator, wanting to test himself. He eventually got there, and when he stepped into his new home, he saw it from a completely different point of view. He felt nice, warm, for the first time in months, glad to be alive.
“Ah! Hey, be careful, let go of me!”
He wasn't sure if he was allowed to use the term friendship when Steve seemed to be holding back so much, while Tony was going all out instead. But Steve gave him a look when he used the word friendship.
Steve’s eyebrow twitched; he was trying to act calm but Reed was right; this Tony wasn't cooperating or understood how dangerous and important the situation that he found himself into was.
“Entertain me?” He asked, narrowing his eyes even more, slightly biting on the inside of his lower lip as he shied away, a bashful look on his face with the heat rising to the tips of his ears and turning them a bright red.
Steve listened to him carefully, piecing up events that happened between them, words that have been spoken, actions that were taken. Coming to think of it, they always hinted that sort of thing to each other; they weren’t just any pair of friends.
“What did I say? What’s my name?”, Steve said as he stepped behind a divider, getting rid of the soggy tights and putting on some cotton boxers and dark trousers that were passed to him, walking in Tony’s view again, kneeling down and starting to tie the rough boots that came with the rest of the outfit.
“Your city, your rules,” Tony replied. “Whatever you decide, I will follow."
Tony stayed close, and Steve clearly wanted this as much as he did even though he'd just told said this was nothing more than friendship. Surely doing such intimate things with someone meant something more, at least in Tony’s eyes. But now wasn't the time to think about this. Steve had asked Tony to show him, so Tony tried to, lowering his hand to rub it across Steve’s chest, sliding their tongues together.
He looked healthier than he did locked up in Reed’s lab, that was for sure, but he didn't feel at ease. There was no reason for him to feel that way, he wanted to go home and he was stuck in a situation where anything could go wrong in a matter of seconds. In fact, nobody promised him that Kang couldn't end up in his own world, threatening his own team of Avengers and leaving him no world to return to after this was over.
Tony was still working on believing that the Captain, the man that has been by his side and in his bed for so long was finally letting him see him like that, in such a desperate state, cheeks bright red and wet lips, his mouth wide open as he was letting out those sweet moans that Tony adored already, but then again, it was difficult not to love everything about the man he adored and idolised.
“You haven’t done much to prove my people wrong,” Steve said, although Tony was clearly not enjoying his reputation. “However, I can see this other, lesser known side to you, a softer side. But doing what you are currently doing, to please your father, is the side of you that I have been warned about, the dark side of you. And it is the most common perception of you. It shows me that the demon still exists within you, and it tends rear its head to me more often than your more human side.”
“Of course. Anything you want," Tony said with a nod. He felt protective, sensitive towards the young Athenian, not wanting to hurt him in any possible way, not when he was so innocent and pure. Tony wasn’t going to taint Steve with his own ways; Steve deserved to be treated in a delicately, carefully.
“No, you know what? I’ve hand enough for this, we will talk and get over this, whenever you like it or not”, Tony insisted, sounding as determined as ever.
“So are you,” Steve replied, kissing Tony’s neck lightly, just like the night before.
Happy was waiting by the car, relieved when Tony and Steve came back.
“I’ve lead these men here,” his friend replied calmly. “They were looking for you and the Athenian."
Tony smiled as he felt Steve's reaction. “I’m glad you didn’t leave earlier,” he said softly.
Steve took a deep breath and stepped outside the car, looking at the gates and then at a flower vendor by them, walking up to him. “Can I have a bouquet of lilies, please?”, he asked him as the man picked out the flowers, and the blonde put his hand in his pocket to take out the money, finding nothing in them. Of course, how could he even possess any bucks anyway? Those weren’t his clothes, he didn’t have a wallet, he had nothing. He opened his mouth to explain himself, but a hand extended from behind him and paid, the vendor offering him the bouquet. Steve turned around and Steve held out the flowers to him.
“It wouldn’t surprise me at all to hear that you know more about him than I ever did, Steve. We didn’t exactly get along.. I guess I tried to..”
Tony made sure that the blinds were closed, and closed the distance between him and Steve.
“I see that you've already figured out what is happening… or think that you did…!”
“I am no mortal. I am the son of Athena,” he said in a firm voice, being blunt as always. “Do you not wish to stand to greet guests, or do you deem yourself higher than the culture of our elders?”
“I have a plan. Attack”, the billionaire replied coldly, jumping off the jet and flying towards the direction of the thunder.
The soldier’s tired eyes turned to the screen, the scientist stepping outside to let him watch. The footage seemed normal, he could only see the morning sky, but all of the sudden, the screen started flickering, a bright light emerging from the clouds, an armoured figure which seemed to be on fire falling down the sky in great speed.
“I can’t help it..”, he mumbled. “I told you before.. and I do remember this very clearly. I care about you more than you think..”
“Ladies and gentlemen... This is indeed, Captain America”, Tony announced once he found his ability to speak again, his voice almost shaking. “No! Don’t touch the ice, we’ll transfer him as he is! We don’t know what seventy years in there could have done to him, or what will happen if he unfreezes right here”, he yelled as soon as the crew members started to approach, holding up their equipment.
“Signs of affection aren’t to be taken lightly, Athenian,” Tony explained calmly, “and I told you not to believe the words that are said about me. This is me trusting you right now, saying that I need your help.”
“For the last time, I’m not setting a trap for you,” Tony sighed. “I can see why you can’t trust me, but would you deny the knowledge that you came here intending to give us? Would you deny giving it to someone who really cares? I’m asking you as a friend, Steve. A friend who wants to know more.”
He nodded to show that he acknowledged what Tony said, gesturing for him to continue. He wanted details, explanations, not to be patronised like that.
“Sure, whenever you’re ready.. I have access.. or should I say.. I can hack certain databases and we can find all the people you’re looking for”, he said.
Steve turned around and headed out quickly, letting out a sigh of relief once he was away from the other men. Tony noticed that relief, and he couldn’t help wanting to know more.
“Boss, why is everyone buzzing about Captain America?”, Rhodey’s voice was heard as he stepped in the tent, eyeing Steve right away, staring at the star uniform that the blonde rushed to hide from view.
“Oh, yeah! We want to offer you a new place. I understand that you’ll be staying in that veteran hospital that you were picked up, right? The new apartment is..part of your re initiation progress. New beginnings and all that jazz. Before you ask, yes, it’s still in Brooklyn. And a very nice modern place too, equipped with the latest tech. The bed is so comfortable, you have no idea...”
“Iron Man!”, a disheveled Captain America yelled, cowl off to cool himself down, shield blocking any heat rays coming their direction, doing his best to protect them both. “You need to get rid of that suit, right now!”
“You’re coming with me?”, Tony asked, blinking. “I think you should stay down with Pepper until I’ve taken care of that guy..”
And then their eyes met.
“Your words are as much of a threat to me as the rest of your weapons are which, it seems, are not a large threat at all,” Steve said, staggering back as he was punched and using the shield, crouching down and then upper-cutting Tony with it.
“Where are you, Stark…”, he sighed to himself, staring outside the window.
His voice was heard in the distance now, and Steve slowly pulled away from the other man, watching him dissolve into the air.
“Yeah...”, Steve muttered. He didn’t realise how blue Tony’s eyes were, they really were pretty, and the carefully trimmed beard of the other almost rubbed his own chin when he got even closer.
“Easy now...easy...”
“I’m going down!”
Steve reached over and took some of the bread, along with the meat, taking a bite into it and nodding. “This isn’t bad at all Spartan,” he said, tilting his head in delight.
A flash of purple and green.
Steve got to his feet and helped Tony, neatly packing everything away. “I’m sure I will demonstrate that to you,” he said.
“Hey, James”, Steve nodded, getting the mug and taking a long sip.
Tony moved back a little, dragging Steve down with him as he kept their lips connected, not wanting them to part. He had enjoyed Steve’s teaching and company throughout the day, but this felt so different. He wanted all of this as much as he wanted Steve to teach him more.
“I came to check out the shower, you told me to..”, he said, stuttering for the first time in that century. He was used to see people changing in front of him because of his army days, but Tony wasn’t a fellow soldier and this was his own bathroom, he was technically the intruder.
Steve responded with a whine, nuzzling Tony until he scratched the top of his head this time around.
“I’m doing it.. I’m walking...”, Steve muttered, mostly in disbelief. The steps felt light, despite the appearance of the sturdy prosthetic legs, which reminded him of armoured boots that knights used to wear, or rather, space suits featured in those movies that everyone seemed to love nowadays.
After Steve had spent some time teaching Tony, he pulled out some brushes and dark coloured natural paints that he kept amongst his scrolls, showing them to Tony with pride. “These are the finest in Athens,” He said.
“I just think that the time we’ve had together despite our differences, has been very eye opening,” he murmured.
Tony could see that Steve seemed to be scared of him, which was a little surprising given that the blonde was bigger than him, at least in Tony’s eyes.
“Tony”, Steve said before Tony could say anything else. “I think that fighting a war and staying frozen for a good number of decades prepare me to leave in the cruel wasteland in Brooklyn”
Steve nodded, feeling humbled by Tony's gratitude, once more seeing a side to Tony that he hadn't been expecting. “I appreciate your hospitality.”
“Yes teacher, of course I want to learn," Tony nodded, blinking at Steve’s comment. “You find my body fascinating?” Steve nodded, and Tony smiled. “Thank you,” he said, focusing on how Steve seemed to take in everything. “That’s the result of year of Spartan training. Cruel training."
“You should have thought this better, pal. Breaking into a cop’s apartment? A rookie mistake”, Steve growled, pressing harder the man between his shoulder blades.
Not once he thought that the legs looked abnormal or scary- he was just glad to be able to walk again and in their way, he knew that they looked..beautiful. Looking at the shower, he then looked back at his legs, not wanting to risk anything and ruin them. He smiled at the sight of them again as he stepped inside the bedroom, heart beating faster as he changed into looser clothes and for the first time in forever got into bed on his own. The wheelchair that he used for so long was in the corner of the room, and he got out of bed, putting it inside the closet, before drifting off to sleep.
Steve blinked again, his bright blue eyes focused on the suit that now sat up on the table,
“We have word that another Athenian ambassador is at the main gate," the man told him, leaning against the door and watching Tony.
When he came back, he carried pieces of wood, and he set them down and worked at them until orange flames jumped up, lighting his contented smile.
Tony smiled at him, humming against Steve's skin to get him to stop talking, moving his tongue around Steve's nipple instead, and his tongue hot over the sensitive flesh.
And, just as he did, he felt a sharp pain in his back and his eyes widened.
“Where to?”
“Chill out, boss, no need for military talk if you don’t even know what you’re talking about”, a voice was heard behind him.
“That’s Colonel James Rhodes, but we all call him Rhodey. By all, I mean I do. He’s a friend, we go a while back, ever since college”, Tony explained as he noticed how Steve’s eyes seemed to be fixed on the tent’s entrance. “He’s a good friend, he won’t let anyone know, if that’s what you’re worrying about.. as for the rest of the crew.. well, I’ll have to come up with something more than rely on their code of honour to keep quiet about the discovery. Ideally, I would have found you all by myself, but this didn’t happen so..”, he trailed off. “Come on, we’ll get the first chopper back, what do you say?”
Finally his eyes moved over to the suit that was on the table, lying there like a doll that had been left by its owner. He stepped up to it with a pensive expression, his hand rubbing his chin and eyes still squinted in thought, wondering if this was the suit that Tony was talking about.
“Desire?” Steve asked. “Is desire not impure? I have always been taught not to succumb to it.”
“See? That wasn’t so hard now, was it? Saved us all the unnecessary shooting.. even though I’d love to have an excuse to shoot you, darling”
He didn't really talk to Steve, he could have sworn that the Captain was avoiding him, for one reason or another, but he didn't know why. Maybe the things that he said shook him more than the blond would let him know, but Tony was truly struggling to keep his sanity as the person that kept him company most of the days was this Reed Richards. Apparently they were close in this universe, but sometimes, the way he spoke about that other Tony, about the things that they did together really troubled him. He might have been morally ambiguous in the past, but he wouldn't never cross lines that his self in that universe apparently did.
Tony looked at him and sat up before moving closer to him, wrapping an arm around Steve to bring him close. “Here, is this any better?” he said as he rubbed Steve's shoulder.
The intruder groaned as Steve pressed his arms behind his back.
They walked inside the glass elevator that was on top of the rooftop, Tony casually leaning against the handles and watching the city before them. Once he would just admire the view, but now, with the decaying buildings and the heavy smoke, it was rather painful to watch. It seemed that Steve thought the same, because he avoided looking, focusing instead on the light panel with all the number of the floors.
“Wait right there," he ordered as he walked towards the door. “At least get some rest and supplies before you go back. If you can’t talk about the differences in our mind-sets, you can at least vouch for Spartan hospitality.”
“Point taken.”
“If you can play it back at the Tower, sure..”, Steve blinked.
“It wasn’t that bad, was it?” he asked him with a chuckle as the suit stopped vibrating, that smug smile remaining on his face.
“What’s the situation?”, he asked as he stepped outside, rubbing his hands together.
“No, no!” Tony replied quickly, shaking his head – and then he lowered his eyes, wondering how his confession would be met. “I don’t want to be remembered as a demon, I want to do something good, something great.”
“I kept seeing myself, laughing happily around them, and next thing I knew I was there, standing alone and they were all gone. After we.. got to know each other, the nightmares were still there, but it ended good, you always appeared next to me after they were gone, and I could always go back to sleep. But then..”, he said, his grip tightening around Tony’s hand. “The nightmare always started with us two together, and ended with me alone again.. sometimes I would see you.. well.. not alive”, finished, swallowing down a whimper.
“I'm letting you out of here.”
“Warned?”, Tony huffed. “Let me guess, is he complaining about the money he lost the other day? Can’t help it when the old man gets stumped every time he gets a card in his hands”, he chuckled lightly.
Tony looked at him, staring straight back into his azure eyes, wanting to say something. But he really was at loss for words. He wanted to tell him to try harder, but he was tired of asking not getting anything in return. He'd known Steve for so little time, and yet he'd thrown himself at him, hoping that he truly found a friend, someone he could really open up to.
The scientists gave each other a victorious look, and it looked more sinister than Steve could even fathom, which made him feel slightly phased.
“I wish not to stay with those who drink the blood of my people, son of Ares,” Steve said trying to walk to the door,   taking long strides to be faster than Tony.
“You don’t know about his kidnapping?”
And that was exactly when the nightmares started again, this time being more vivid. He couldn’t explain how that was linked with Steve’s departure; they didn’t sleep together or anything like that, they were just teammates and friends, it wasn’t like Steve was lurking at his floor and he could feel his presence to calm himself down. No, that was it, it might have been exactly what Tony wanted. Maybe part of him did want the strong Captain to be the one to calm him down whenever he would face these problems, whenever he was feeling alone and threatened.
The red haired flipped her hair back, nodding. “I heard a lot about you, Rogers. It’s nice to finally meet you”
His eyes opened wide when he heard the door creaking, the bright sun entering the small building. He blinked a couple of times, but that’s when he saw him standing in front of him, taking off his hat and slicking his hair back, always with that smug look on his face. Tony Stark was there, inviting himself in and taking one of the chairs, his feet dropping on the desk.
“Don’t worry, Tony..”, the soldier reassured him, waiting for the perfect chance.
Steve could feel his heart being ready to jump out of his chest; the way that Tony acted surely rang a bell, but it couldn’t be that, right? He wasn’t just preparing a confession, him, Tony Stark, his old friend and partner, Iron Man, trying to actually confess that he had feelings for him, right? Not after the war they fought, after all their differences and arguments that they shared.
Steve shut his eyes tightly, feeling Tony deep inside him, trying so hard to keep his head up when he just wanted to collapse under him. “Y-yes...” he stuttered, quickly gritting his teeth again.
“Interesting? Why?” He asked before rolling his eyes, “Let me guess, it’s due to my reputation of being unable to age...”
He helped Steve out and into the elevator, unlocking the apartment's large white door and stepping at the side. Steve wheeled himself in; everything looked really cosy, the few suitcases with his belongings from the hospital were already there. Tony was right, a huge TV was there, a laptop on the small table, the tech looking out of place compared to the humble yet elegant decoration.
“How old are you anyway?” Tony asked as they walked, wanting to learn more about the man who had shown showed him more about what real culture meant. “Got a wife waiting for you back home?”
“You like the booze? Take your pick; we’re supposed to throw you quite the warm welcome anyway. And you Irish know your business more than we do”, Tony said, pointing at some of the shelved drinks.
When Howard passed away, it was up to his only heir, Anthony Stark to take over, to carry on his father’s work and give the world something else, something that his father couldn’t promise at the time. At first, it was easy for Tony. With his well beyond average intelligence and creativity, his visions of the future started to take shape; everything that seemed to belong in science fiction was being built right in front of everyone’s eyes, and Tony soon rose up as the most promising man for at least a couple of decades. He managed to save what his father strived to save, but still, not everything could be saved, which was a blow to such a perfectionist like Tony Stark.
“Hello, I’m here to see Tony Stark? The name is Steve Rogers”
The next morning, he sat up, looking for the chair, but as he removed the sheets, he smiled to himself.
“I guess that Captain America is back then.. Thank you, Tony..”, Steve said with a faint smile.
A makeshift ladder was hanging there, and wasting no time, they started climbing, Steve at the front again. As soon as he got up, he turned around, only to see Tony attempting to climb with the Gauntlet on, slipping on the very last step, but Steve managed to catch him, dragging him up.
“All of them, that is correct”, Tony made a mental note to save the footage at the corner of his database for future reference.
There was something different about Tony presenting the same logic behind the project as the other 2 scientists did. He was more approachable, he spoke like a man who knew from experience how tough the war was, but that was impossible, all he had heard about Tony Stark was how he was born, fed with a silver spoon, being unbelievably wealthy and enjoying a healthy, comfortable life.
Steve hesitated a moment, but sat down next to him all the same. “Thank you,” he said, looking around. “I don’t often sleep in large rooms such as this.”
“You see this? He’s.. they called, well, many names, but Thanos seems to be the most common one”
“Welcome to the future, Captain”, Zola said proudly, holding the door open for him as they stepped inside.
Tony’s cocky smile from earlier was gone, behind his glass prison. Something was wrong, he could tell, but he couldn't hear anything, even though the change in Steve’s expression and posture left little to his imagination.
“Is that a promise too?” Steve asked, standing up and brushing himself off, picking up his things again and looking over at Tony, admiring how much lighter his mood seemed.
The next morning came soon enough, and the moment Tony opened his eyes, he saw Steve sleeping right next to him, his golden hair hiding his eyes, a peaceful smile on his face. He couldn’t help but press his lips against Steve's, his fingers running through Steve's hair, thinking of what they had done the night before.
There was something in his tone that made Tony smile. A fan of his? That was flattering, to say the least.
“You saw us? Together?” Tony said, trying to get Steve to tell him as he moved closer. “That doesn’t seem so bad.”
“Really?” Tony asked with a soft chuckle. “I kind of want to witness that, I bet it’s not as bad as you make it to be.”
“How are you feeling?”, Tony asked in a lower voice, getting behind Steve and pushing his chair towards another more secluded room, where  a metal table was waiting for them. It looked ominous, it certainly made Steve shudder unintentionally, hoping that nobody else caught that.
“Well, you get to work with me now, try and not get too excited. We're going after something.. well, if we manage to retrieve it, it’s going to make us both filthy rich and set for life.”
“Run the tests, keep me updated”, Steve finally decided, but before he could even leave the room, a voice was heard coming from the panel that Reed was staring at.
“You can sit here…”
“Don’t you even think about touching him!”, a stern voice was heard behind them, and before blinking an eye, the syringe was knocked off Stane’s hand, leaving the older man rub his fingers in pain, knocked down by Steve with a swift movement.
“Because you are different,” Tony tried to explain, shaking his head. “I don’t know what it is about you, but you are nothing like any other person I’ve met. You can... tame me if you put it that way. You take out the human in me, not the son of Ares, it’s just... well so far I was being just Tony.”
Steve’s breathing hitched the moment he felt the buzzing inside him, eyes rolling back with pleasure as he tilted his head forward to rest by the collar of the suit, his hands raising and placing them flat over the tri-beam plate, “Uhn- b-but you’re, you’re Iron Man...” He moaned, his hips slowly beginning to move on the hardness, trying to adjust so that he could feel him more.
“Pray to your own father, not my mother. She helps those who deserve her help, those who are pure and loving and wise,” Steve said firmly once more.
“I, I think it is even though I have never done this with any other ‘friend,’” he said in mild confusion, tilting his head to the side. “I don’t know, but we can try? See how much we enjoy each other’s company.”
“And here we are”, Tony said, interrupting his darkest thoughts. “Those are the living quarters, is where I spent most of the time when I’m not busy running around the company. I’ll modify the security system so it recognises you as well.. since this floor is more..private to me”
Tony noticed how Steve pulled away, but he'd already been used to raising his voice every day during training, and that was before he started giving orders instead, which still required him to yell. It was a natural reflex; shouting to prove a point, or to make people fear him. It was what he had learned. But he forgot that Steve was different.
“I...I think I feel the same, you know,” Tony nodded, his heart racing. “It’s different. It feels so real, when you touch me, when you talk to me. It’s all different from anything I’ve felt before, about anyone. And if you decide to let me in, I promise I’ll give you nothing but the best - fitting for a proper demigod."
Once they were secured, he finally had all the time in the world to open the bag where they kept the Gauntlet. His eyes were shining once again; at last, an artifact, an ancient relic of the past was in his touch.
“I have learned all I need to, Spartan; that your bite is fierce and your appetite supersedes that of the Cerberus,” Steve said with a nod, quickly stepping out and grabbing his spear from one of the guards, heading out toward the gates again.
“He’s bluffing!”, Tony called.
“Put that suit on”, Steve said, this time in a less threatening way.
“Thank you, Tony..”, Steve nodded as he turned his eyes away, outside the window again, watching.
He finally stood still for a moment, standing in front of Steve yet again.
“Together, partner. It’s a promise”
“Do you think that’s why we’re here?” Steve asked. “Why I am so drawn to you?”
“I’m glad I didn’t either.” Steve replied, pulling his head back to look at Tony, admiring how at ease he seemed.
“No, he had... something, a cellist I believe”, Tony said, snapping out of his thoughts.
“I’m Tony Stark”, Tony repeated. “Howard Stark’s son”, he added, trying to hide the resentfulness in his voice, for now. “My father was present during the experiment, my company and I, including government facilities know about the procedure and the serum, we’ve studied it”
Tony’s hand hesitantly moved closer, eventually patting softly Steve’s palm. Steve smiled at that sight, and gently closed his hand around Tony’s.
The blonde nodded. A damn good start.
“I waited forever for this, I think I can handle 10 more minutes”, Tony said with a nod, letting Steve rest by his side as he carried on rubbing his back, so pleased and eager to see what else was in store for them that night whilst Steve shut his eyes, gently relaxing, feeling looked after and thinking that perhaps he should’ve done this sooner, but good things come to those who wait, and swallowing his pride for once bore great results indeed. Though there was this nagging thought that he’d had all along that brought a small smirk to his lips as he recuperated his energy;
“Why should I trust you? How am I supposed to know that you’re who you claim to be? You could be HYDRA agents in disguise, who knows?”, the Captain asked as he strained his back.
“So can I stay for a while?” Tony asked him, really wanting the company of someone different, of someone he never met before.
“So you’re saying that in 70 years you made Earth unlivable?”
Steve’s voice was slightly shaky.
Steve was so relaxed, even though he would hardly talk during those rides, always relieved to put his own two feet on the ground. Still, having Tony hold him close like that was a blessing back in the day, and he was glad that his cowl covered most of his blush, not that Tony was able to see.
“I was told that you wanted to see me. Before you say anything, I’m sure you know that I turned down many job positions since I came back.”
The invasion of his privacy didn’t go unnoticed; it irked Steve, but he should have known that every information on him was out there for everyone to see, which was how he was found in the first place. So much for a private, quiet life.
“I’m glad about that,” Tony nodded, not really knowing what to say. “It’s nice to see that my influential skills are growing.” This was Steve’s territory and, without wanting to admit it, Tony felt strange to be in the very same city he'd sworn to burn down before.
The he bumped into something; it was still too dark to tell what or who it was. Times like these he actually did miss the reactor’s bright light. A pair of hands reached out for him and he gasped, pulling away straight away.
No, the sky wasn't falling down. He was falling, everything seemed to move in such a slow pace. Is that how people felt when they died? Were they also thinking of their best friend in their last moments, trying so desperately to remember their smile, anything but the look of disappointment and betrayal that they last showed him when they parted ways?
“Really? I’m sure that we could find a thing or two that I need to be taught”, he chuckled in the same voice that would always manage to send a shiver down Steve’s spine.
“Of course I am”, he replied quickly. “So you’re saying that the serum kept me alive for what..70 years? I was aware of certain side effects, we all were, but I didn’t expect something like that to be plausible”
“Is this..New York..?”, he asked Tony, unable to take his eyes away from the sight.
“I... Don’t want to be alone again.” Steve said, “I do want to return home but. It’s going to be lonely.”
Tony’s eyes widened and shook his head, waving with his hands. “No, no, that wasn’t what I meant at all. Doing this shouldn’t feel like an obligation to you, Athenian. I won’t ask for you unless you really want it, and if obeying your mother comes first, I will accept it. This has nothing to do with your people, it’s just for us.”
Sure, words could add more to what he wanted to convey, but Steve Rogers was a man of actions above all. And it was then that a whistle was heard, a small giggle and a loud ‘finally’ coming out of the doorway, too late to pull back from a kiss that felt about right in terms of length and passion. Iron Man, or rather, Tony Stark didn’t pull back either, and it was the best thing he could ever ask for.
“I’ll show you then. Take it as me being a personal guide, I’ll fill you in and show you more practically what changed. And help you adjust to this new life”, Tony rushed to reply, voicing his desire to actually help.
Tony raised his head slightly, looking at Steve. “I don’t know. Are you leaving?” he asked.
“Didn't you hear me? You’re staying here. He’s going to kill you.”
“You keep saying that, but I haven’t seen anything yet, pal”, Steve teased.
Steve took a long time to recover, not hearing one word from his mother as a consequence for his actions. He was now impure, and would have to redeem himself.
“Easy there, Stark.”, Steve replied as he let his book at side and helped Tony sit up properly in his bed.
“Those are some pretty old fashioned values from someone of the future like you”, Steve pointed out, even though he started to observe the environment around him, the lit up hall with many doors leading to rooms he didn’t even know what they were.
“I guess I..missed you when I was away.”
Steve didn’t reply to that, instead he looked outside the helicopter and kept his eyes fixed on the icy land beneath them. He closed his eyes, to indicate that he wasn’t really in the mood to talk anymore, even though when he opened his right eye to take a peek, he could see that Tony was relaxing and just enjoying the trip.
Steve enjoyed kissing Tony's skin, pushing himself up against him to lick up and down the tendons in his neck, his hands firmly in place. He didn’t want to admit that he was falling for this man, just as he had fallen for the girl before. With her, he had made no move. With Tony however he couldn’t hold himself back. Without Falcon there to stop him, to be his moral compass, he was very easily swayed. And he opened his heart to Tony; especially when it meant that Tony would protect his people instead of slay them.
“You like deals, then? All right, here’s another one; you stay and think about my offer to help, and I won’t say a word about your city or your people. Like a proper pupil.” He offered his hand again. “My turn to give you my trust.”
“Yeah, I will properly head to the gym or something”, Steve replied, picking out a shiny apple from the fruit bowl.
“Steve, this is Jarvis. Jarvis, this is-”
“Don’t you dare touch him.”, Steve growled.
Tony found himself looking at Steve’s focused expression more than the writing itself, moving his hand as Steve showed him, creating the same little marks that he did. “It’s not that complicated, is it?” he asked.
“Fine, fine, you can have tomorrow..”
Tony wanted to hear it; he just needed to hear something hopeful for once, to have someone to reassure him that he was not beyond saving. And Steve was there all of the sudden.
Steve nodded. “Then... Farewell, son of Ares,” he said in a confused tone, not knowing what else to say as he took a couple of steps away from him and went on down the path.
“What?!”, Tony said, standing up and leaning over the sleeping soldier, who didn’t seem as peaceful as he did before.
“So, what you’re saying is..?”
“I’ll take this as a whole new learning experience then" Tony said with a firm nod. “The stars look prettier from here. We’re blessed with a clear sky.”
“We need to run some tests on you, you might be on grave danger, you don’t-“
“And what good are you doing to your people when they will not even be able to bury you appropriately? Do not cross my path, Athenian. I can let you go now if you beg for forgiveness," Tony said with another huff, motioning for the guards to stay to one side as he jumped across and hit Steve’s shield with his spear, amazed by the sound it made. He felt the need to compliment it. “That’s an impressive weapon."
His tone was a mix of surprise and excitement, he was honestly in loss of words, not knowing what to say, what the appropriate reaction was.
That feeling, wanting to be the one in control got even worse ever since their nights together seemed to be more frequent, and Tony needed to feel powerful yet again, relive his glorious, good old days, but he could see that being a gentleman about it got him nowhere. He needed to use all his intelligence in a more mischievous way, and that’s when he told Steve that he was working on a different suit for him, still gutted about the loss of the Iron Patriot. In reality, that suit wasn’t anything special in particular, at least not from the outside. Nobody could know until it was activated, and Tony had a plan in mind to help him get on top once again.
Steve wore his finest armour, placing his helmet on, readying his spear and shield as he stood by his men, awaiting the attack from the rival city.
“We’ve both been hurt, Steve, trust me,” Tony said. “One would think that being seen as children of the Gods has many advantages, but it brings us nothing but betrayal and loneliness. I don’t want to be hurt and alone, not when I can change that. And you have me as your friend, Steve. Don’t ever doubt that. You’re my friend.”
Steve kept himself protecting Tony, glaring almost like a lion, with his golden hair framing his face.
When Steve opened his eyes, he forgot that he fell asleep in first place. He remembered hugging Tony close, talking for endless hours about their life, enjoying the company of someone like he haven’t done in years. But now, Tony was nowhere to be found, Steve looked around worryingly, seeing nothing. Standing up, he walked across the room, trying to locate him or a message, anything that would tell him where he was hiding. He was a busy man, he knew that, but he guessed that calling him would distract him instead, maybe he was having one of those press conferences of his.
Tony could have stayed there forever, just watching the handsome man bathing. He looked so much more at peace, nothing like before, his golden locks at the side of his face. “Sometimes I think that you’re the son of Aphrodite instead,” he blurted out before he could stop himself.
“Right, right, Bucky it is. Who came up with that name anyway?”
Tony had had his eyes fixed on Steve when he uttered those words until he noticed Steve's eyes widening, the man behind Steve holding his own very spear - a gift from the gods themselves – where it pierced through the dark armour.
Tony could see it himself, a faint sign that the Captain was indeed alive, somehow.
“I thought you may understand me, that you needed me, and that your pleas for help were genuine. But no Spartan would ever need or want an Athenian” Steve said, walking over to the door and reaching for the handle.
“And what if you need to be educated the Spartan way, Athenian? What if you must finally learn what matters and appreciate the necessity of war? Is that supposed to be a challenge?” Tony huffed a little. “Because I will take that challenge, but it’s not honorary to kill an ambassador in time of war."
“Yeah, I've seen that. You’re messed up, all of you”, Tony hissed, hating the fact that he didn't have his armour to protect him right now; it was probably still in shard somewhere in the background, locked away from him. Being a common prisoner to those doppelgangers was something that he wouldn't tolerate in the slightest.
The door slid open and the cold breeze that blew on his face truly made Tony think that he was walking inside a freezer. “What…?”, he asked, eyes fixed on the tables and the sheets that covered something under each one of them.
Tony’s eyes lit up; Steve was making progress, most likely due to the injection that he got, which would hopefully cure him.
“Violence is always pointless,” Steve said shaking his head again. “I’m trying to educate you, Spartan, but if closed minds would rather be stuck in their own ways then so be it. I would love to see your men try and kill me where I stand, and fail.”
He was slowly starting to fall asleep, thinking of quite a few things, mostly wanting to go back and visit his mother’s grave at some point, wanting her to see the brand new Sheriff star on his chest. He smiled at the thought; she was always encouraging him to fight for the greater good, and there he was, clearing up the towns from criminals and all kinds of smug faces.
Soon, they reached the marbled building, and Tony pointed at it as they walked inside. Steam coming out from the main room, and Tony started to take off his tunic and sandals.
Steve nodded; nobody he knew was as well informed about the different universes that existed as well as Reed did.
Steve blinked a couple of times, looking at Tony with wide eyes.
“Don’t force me to hurt you, Stane!”, Steve yelled at the large monstrous man as he rolled at side and threw his shield on his back, hearing the man growling in pain.
Steve felt his own chest getting heavy, kneeling down next to Tony and offering him a napkin. “You had to see it…”
Tony reached for Steve as he pulled away, wanting to say so more, but he couldn’t with everyone else in the room, with everyone accusing him of doing something that could bring the wrath of the Gods to him. “Wait, Steve I- didn’t say that, I said that it wasn’t him," he said, pointing at the archer. “Will you leave us alone?” he snapped, ignoring Rhodey’s disapproving gaze on him.
“For using it without just cause,” he said, “I shed blood, even though I said I wouldn’t. So if I am to be hurt without it, that is the weapon's will and it is what I deserve.”
“Well, I can’t show you now, it’s only useful in the night sky... maybe tonight?” he suggested.
“Aaa-aroo!,” Steve howled, his ears lowering in disappointment with himself, trying so hard to follow Tony’s instructions.
Tony knew that something was wrong, but he couldn’t really tell what. His own reflex on Spartan kids mocking his size when they were all training in his teens was to shout and start fights, compensating for his lack of a body more well-built. Sometimes he would even shout to his father about not giving him a more suitable body, one better befitting the son of the god of war. But he never received an answer.
“My mother gave me the water. I was unaware of its capabilities,” he said with a hint of remorse. “I can die, just not of old age.”  But his eyes went to Tony’s medallion. “What is that?” he asked, never having come across such a thing before.
“Because I have a duty, a duty to live up to my name, do I not?” he asked, conflicted by the way that Steve argued. “Being the son of the god of war… I can’t bring peace, can I?”
Steve moved himself on top of Tony, flicking his own hair back as he moved his tongue clumsily down Tony’s neck, trying to mimic what Tony had done to him. Tony moved his fingers to Steve’s head, moving through his golden hair as he threw his head back, appreciating Steve’s efforts, and then let out a yelp of surprise when Steve's mouth reached his nipple, his grip on Steve's hair tightening. “Oh... Steve...” Steve kept going, licking around his nipple before taking it into his mouth, sucking at it, following by example, and Tony's whole body tensed at the feeling.
One day, he was sitting in the temple of his mother, examining his shield and trying to clean it once more, when he heard a sound.
“Yeah, that’s why you emptied them didn’t you? You threw that guy off the ship!”, Tony snapped. “We don’t know if he was actually an enemy, he could be mind-controlled like Barton. Great way of showing off what a great hero you are, Rogers”. That part did make a bad impression to him. Having Steve lecturing him earlier on about being a hero and seeing him doing that did provoke him.
“D-damn you Tony Stark...” Steve muttered with a bittersweet pleasure, feeling the warm musky breath cascade along the skin of his neck, close to finishing but not wanting to give Tony the pleasure of watching him. “T-turn your head!” He barked.
He slowly turned around and met Steve’s lips with his own to kiss him deeply, desperately. Steve’s mouth widened to the kiss, closing his eyes to let their lips slide together, eager to taste Tony's tongue again. His hand trailed its way up from Tony’s waist to stroke his hair, and Tony moved his own hands behind Steve’s back. He stroked it gently as he carried on kissing Steve the way he knew that he liked from what he had seen so far, being careful and passionate with him, enjoying the feel of Steve's fingers in his hair.
Tony walked over, placing an armoured hand on Steve’s shoulder. “We’re taking down Kang and then I'm going home. Trust me, I'm enough for all of you, no need to fight over me”, he tried to joke around.
Tony raised his shoulders. “So did your Tony. He needs to evolve constantly, to create something better, to make sure that he can face any threat that the universe will throw at him, he’s a futurist-“, he trailed off, realising that this was pointless; Tony was dead, he surely didn't see this coming, did he?
Tony sighed heavily. He could see how Steve was judging him, disapproving of everything he said. “You know, I had thought you would understand. We are children of the Gods, Steve," he said, not realizing that he called him by his name. “We know first-hand what it feels like to have responsibilities, to have to live up to expectations. I might sound ridiculous now, but I...think that we could be friends.”
“It was my honour to fight by your side, Tony Stark. Until we meet again”, Steve nodded, offering his hand for the other man to shake.
“Then I don’t want to lose this,” Tony said. “I want to be friends with you, Steve."
“And how are you so sure about that?” Tony asked yet again, crossing his arms.
The chance was finally given when they escorted Thor and Loki, both heading back to Asgard, taking back what belonged to them. They were all dressed in normal attire, away from the uniform formality. They agreed to part ways for now, but promised to stay in touch and come together when they were needed to.
Somehow, he felt that this man might be able to do it, to change him for the better. But if Steve said that he couldn’t, then Tony knew he was beyond saving.
Steve lowered the shoulders of his large tunic, letting the fabric pool around his waist as he turned his back to Tony. The material slipped down his pale white skin, along the muscular curves of his arms and back, and he stepped closer to the edge of the bath.
“It is.” Steve said, his eyes on Tony, watching the drops of water sparkle as they skimmed across his skin, as they danced down his body, “but there are many beautiful people in this world, and I fail to compare to them.”
“Oh, I acknowledge you, Son of Ares. I acknowledge your wrath and your enjoyment for striking fear into those who oppose you. You have done nothing but prove me wrong and prove my people right,” he replied, looking over at Tony with a glare. “What else do you want from me? Now, if you'll forgive me, I do not enjoy talking to mules, I will take my leave.”
The flight wasn’t stable, Steve had to try his hardest to stay on track as he was flying out the city and towards the facility that he had been to for the past couple of days. He could hear people screaming or taking pictures, but didn’t care; his priority was to get there as soon as possible and make everyone who was involved in this pay. He tried really hard not to think of Tony’s reaction; he did feel bad, he most likely wasn’t behind this, just like he had sworn, but that seemed like a personal battle, he had to deal with those people who used them alone. Then again, he also knew that Tony would take it personally just as much, they used his name and money to fund this sickening operation when Stark only wanted to do something good for a change. Maybe he was too harsh, but it had to wait, his priorities rested elsewhere.
“That is great news, then!”, Stane said, coming closer and patting Steve on the back, to which the blonde noticed that Tony responded with a twitch of his eyebrow. “So, when are the tests going to take place?”, he asked, rubbing his hands together.
And he didn’t remember a thing. Fixing his brain took so much time and effort, and when he did find out what he did during that cursed war, he couldn’t help but wonder why the hell he got the person he mostly cared about killed. That bond seemed non repairable, but somehow they managed to do it. It took some time to fix that broken trust, but that smile and hug were honest. But the true question was whenever Tony could actually confess or not. Would he risk it? Just like he did every time in his past, like when he trusted Bethany and Rumiko and it ended up with him getting hurt and blood on his hands? Steve’s blood was already there, despite him being alive and smiling like always to him when they met. They even started going out, just the two of them. Tony wasn’t sure if those classified as dates, but he enjoyed them. He even liked it when Steve started letting him get closer, his cheek almost against the man’s chest, the beating of his heart audible. And when the lights went off, the reactor’s light emerging from the billionaire’s chest lit up Steve’s calm face, who would smile down to him and say that it was time to go to bed.
The son of Zeus gritted his teeth, slinging a hammer by his side, spinning it threateningly as the dark haired man spoke.
Steve took the scrolls quickly, possessive of his work, shoving them back into his makeshift satchel to hold them close to his chest as he backed away from Tony. He looked cautious, wary as he spoke. “I’m taking my leave, don’t you worry.”
“I was kidnapped and tortured a few years back. Was doing a tour, demonstrating a new missile that I created. Terrorists knew how valuable I was, how much people would pay for me, but of course, you can guess why they hated me so much. They might have wanted me alive, but nobody clarified how..alive they needed me to be. It..it wasn’t pretty. it still isn’t pretty..”
The soldier looked at him, not saying anything at all yet. He eyed Tony, and that really made him nervous, not knowing what was really in his head. However, he had to take chances, he didn’t have many choices and one was being offered to him at that moment. Maybe the man before him had good intentions, but he couldn’t know that, and even though he would hate to admit it.. he had no idea what to do now. Trying to take in all that information and seem calm and recollected while doing so was hard, he needed time alone to think about everything, and that too meant somewhere to live.
Steve nodded. “I want that,” he said. “Do you?”
“Yeah, sure”, he replied without really thinking about it twice. He didn’t expect to like being around Tony Stark, but once he got to know him more, he seemed like a genuinely nice and fun person. He was glad that he took Happy’s advice and forgot anything that he ever read about him in the magazines.
“You use me as a scapegoat, you bring me here then mock me and my teachings, and then you use your sharp tongue to cut me,” Steve answered. “I will not be a victim of your abuse, or any other Spartan. I pry into your reputation and you use it as an excuse to talk about how once more, your people are superior. Any excuse to wedge that in, of course. So yes, you bring me here just to laugh, as though I am your entertainment to make up for your lack of theatrics. I am a fool to have had such hope for a man who crushes dreams.”
“And you will fight when there’s time to stop that?” Tony snorted. “You speak like a true Spartan.”
Steve's hands rested on top of Tony’s head, fingers brushing through his curly hair as he felt the kisses, and he closed his eyes the moment he felt Tony’s hand along his front. His tunic slipped off his shoulders, down to his waist, and he gasped a little, opening his eyes to peer at Tony once again as he pursed his lips together, cheeks flushed.
Under the blanket, there was…
“Rhodey”, Tony said, stepping in front of him and Steve. “This is..Steve Rogers, codename, Captain America.. but we’re trying to keep it low, his request was to-”
He gazed at the card and nodded, placing it down along with the now empty bottle of water, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand and grabbing a towel to dab around his neck and forehead, brushing away strands of hair that had managed to escape his always perfectly curtained style.
“I love you, Steve”, the older man whispered, speaking with so much conviction. “I’m in love with you”
Tony flinched once more; he didn't know how he was supposed to react, what he was supposed to say in response to that. That he was thankful? That he was going to help the Avengers of this dimension? That he was going to give his own life if he had to? He wasn't sure about anything.
“Did you find anything?”, he asked the scientist who in his own turn, shook his head. “Where on Earth is he…”
“No, no! You will stay here, I will keep you here!”
“You have enough in your head, Stark, I’ll take care of this myself”, Steve replied firmly.
“Even though you’re the one destined to kill me?” Steve asked.
“I’m not allowed to be more than that, Tony,” Steve replied sadly, “I’ve told you before.”
“Yes,” Steve said. “When I touch you I get this strange feeling, as though I am supposed to be next to you. I don't know what that feeling is, but perhaps it is the fates, as you said, pushing us together to help our parents. Many soldiers feared coming to Sparta, but I refused to show fear and I needed to face you, even if it was for you to turn me down.”
He really did, from back in the day when he was a child, when he would rarely have some time to relax, when he was walking back home with bloody, dirty knees, clinging on the paper bag in his arms, the medicine he managed to get for his mother in it. Walking up the road and staring back at the sunset was one of the few memories he still held dear to him. It was even the same during his Cap days, when exhausted he would look back at the people he would save, the terror himself and his commandos would prevent, smiling to himself and finally feeling that he was actually doing something good. But now? Seeing the sky of the city he truly loved like that, and to know that if he headed down to his old neighbourhood the sight would be nothing but devastating? No, he wasn’t even sure if he could take that sight, but he had to brace himself and do it.
That one night, Tony knocked on Steve’s room, having one question in mind to pop at him. Steve answered the door, his smile more natural now than it was the first days they talked to each other.
“Then you’ll be the first. And last” Tony shivered, rubbing his neck. It was good to let that out of his chest, but still, something was missing.
Tony gave him another look, pulling Steve away from the main line of fire, the medallion healing most of his wounds already. “I...I love you, Steve, and I didn’t want to come to this, to this massacre," he said, gritting his teeth to stop himself from pouring any emotion into that moment. “We can stop this now, together.”
The Captain didn’t really seem into it, and Tony wasn’t judging him either; it was hard to put himself into his shoes, but he was sure that he would react differently. On the other hand, he didn’t know the circumstances in which Steve found himself before he was waken up. Or rather, he did; the man sacrificed himself to save everyone, and now he woke up, well alive, decades afterwards to find the world he once thought he saved in that state. On second thought, if he thought about it more, he would be as devastated as Steve was, if his technology made this world worse instead of improve it, just like he expected.
“Let me tell you what, you can drop by the Tower tomorrow. Stark Tower, I have a top class gym and you can start training and performing the physical tests there, how does that sound? Much better than a lab. Besides, I need to show you something about those legs, they can do something really..amazing. I’ll stay cryptic tonight, you’ll see tomorrow. Rest well, Cap”, he saluted as the car stopped in front of the apartment block.
Tony held on Steve’s face so desperately, bringing Steve's hand to touch his own cheek, Steve's words ringing in his ears. “No... No we’re going together, you hear me? Together, that’s what we agreed, didn’t we?” he cried out, the weak smile on Steve’s face only making his anger and frustration worse. His eyes caught sight of medallion hanging down around his neck. With a sharp pull, he ripped it off his neck, placing it on Steve’s wound.
Steve’s eyes focused on the arc reactor yet again, biting on the inside of his lip before daring to ask to the question.
“But you do realise that your return could mean so much more to the public. To see their hero rising up again, giving those talks of yours that got everyone pumped would be for the best, trust me. They need a hero right now, and your timing is absolutely perfect, in fact, it wouldn’t be any better, we-”
Tony reached for his shield and held it over their heads straight away, to protect them from the falling stones. “Stop, you’re going to crush the roof down!”
“How can I keep him out?” Steve asked, continuing with the gentle, comforting strokes as he looked down at Tony, at the way the water looked when it was combed through his hair to let the tips of the black strands flick up at the ends. “Any suggestions?”
“You know..directing such a huge company can be dangerous..”, Tony shrugged, and Steve noticed that the man held on his chest protectively for a split second, like he was hiding something from him. “Either way, I’ll show you around now”, he said quickly, getting back inside the glass elevator and waiting for the other man to follow him.
“You said that before, yet you’re standing here now,” Tony said. “Something made you come back, am I right? What was it? At least answer that before you decide to leave.”
“Got it.”
“So you refuse help when it’s asked from you? Is that it?” Tony asked with another hiss. “How blunt does someone have to be to appreciate their call for help?”
“I think I’m starting to piece things together,” Tony said with a cheeky smile, admiring Steve’s bashful reaction. “Why was it that pleasant?”
Several hours later, Steve was still sitting on their bed, ears lowered.
Tony was holding back his own breath as Steve moved under him, the other arm moving to hold the soldier’s hands up, above his head as he moved closer, the distance between them shortening. He knew that Steve was aware of what he was going to do; after all, he was always doing those sorts of things on him, always preparing him before he would get inside him.
“Happy Hogan, my number is on the address book on the table. Along with numbers that you can reach Tony Stark. He’s taking this project really seriously...”
“Don’t thank me”, Tony said before Steve could even open his mouth. “Just take them”
“On your own?” Steve asked curiously, looking into Tony’s eyes and enjoying how Tony was one of the few people who would stare directly back into his own.  “Like what?”
Tony’s eyes lit up at the soft nod, and he nodded towards. He wanted them to move together because he wasn't going to move an inch away from Steve. Not now that they were together again, now that they had all the time in the world to dedicate towards each other.
Despite Tony’s attempts to ignore it, Steve’s groans in his sleep kept Tony awake. He wouldn’t bear it, he couldn’t accept that Steve didn’t want his help to get over this. The thought that Steve kept things hidden from him, even though he tried everything to make Tony open up to him instead, didn’t seem fair. Because, one of the things that Tony hated but also was thankful for being with Steve was that he changed him, made him a better person, taught him how to share his burden with him. Right now, Steve was doing
The blonde was taking deep breaths, trying to calm himself, but it wasn’t until he saw the grave of someone from his past in this new age that it made him realise what was happening. It felt so surreal; there he was, looking like the man from the 40’s, in a new century standing by the grave of someone who held dear in his heart. There was no way of him going back to that era, of undoing what had been done, and that killed him.
“Like I said; I’m Tony Stark, perhaps the surname rings a bell? Howard Stark? Manhattan Project? Worked closely with the government back in your Cap days”
“I should go to the temple of Hephaestus and give him an offering, to show my thanks,” Steve said. “Without him I wouldn’t have met you.”
?, Tony thought as he smiled apologetically, cleaning the rice pieces up.
Steve looked down again, saluting at the crowd, receiving yet another loud cheer. He sighed in relief as he stepped back inside, rubbing the back of his head.
“Why now? Why…this?”, Tony asked.
He was angry with everyone, and yet he wanted to protect Steve.
Tony was trembling when he wiped his mouth clean; his stomach was tied in knots, his heart wanted to jump out of his chest, he wanted to close his eyes and think that all this was part of a gruesome nightmare. And so he did, pinching his arm, but upon realising that all this was real, he almost threw up again. “All of them… are dead…?”, he asked in a low, barely audible voice.
“Help yourself, Athenian,” Tony nodded to him as he sat on his bed. “There’s plenty more where those came from, and you’re an honourable guest after all.”
Tony shook his head, head turned to start scanning the area. “He’s got Christmas business to attend to. Got it, the big guy there? The device in his hand, if we get our hands on that, it shuts down this whole shindig. No sure what it does yet, but I’m sure that we don’t want to stick around to find out.”
Steve gave him another faltering smile in return.
That looked off too. Tony just looked into those bright blue eyes, the eyes that right now radiating something that didn’t belong to his childhood hero. No, this wasn’t Captain America in front of him, he refused to believe that.
Steve looked at the chariot and then climbed on, sitting next to Tony and looking at the vehicle that seemed so polished - spikes and all.
“I will return you to your mother,” he said. “Perhaps you can grovel to her for forgiveness.”
Tony sat back and watched him, the way his eyebrows would furrow in concentration, watching the image taking shape as time passed until he realised what Steve was doing. “Is that..?” he asked to be sure.
But it still didn't feel right; Steve knew that keeping Tony there would only hurt him more when it would be time for him to go. He wasn't a replacement, not in the slightest, but it sure was a good way to try and accept Tony’s death and move on, especially since he could actually talk to Tony and hear his opinion in so many things. Next thing he knew, Tony would develop Stockholm Syndrome, and that was something that Steve wanted to avoid; he wasn't going to keep Tony there against his will more than he deemed necessary, but they didn't seem to get nowhere. Kang was nowhere to be found, they didn't receive another message from him nor they've witnessed another sudden appearance of Tony from yet another universe, which was good news. However, Tony was separated from his friends and family, his team was out there looking for him and they couldn't contact them in case that would have more consequences.
His suit black to fit in with the dark lab, he landed close to her, who was still scouting out the place, coming up with a plan of attack.
“I’m here no matter what, got it?” he told Steve again, wanting to make sure that he was serious about that.
Steve gasped at the sudden voice next to him, startling enough to drop his scrolls before he took a scrambling step back as he spotted the dark wavy hair, side stepping away from Tony.
“A nightmare probably? I know how this feels, trust me, I’ve had my fair share of-“
Tony could have sworn that the battlefield was slowing down, that all he could really see was Steve and the confusion and despair in his eyes, standing there watching him as people were slaying each other around them in a battle that they couldn’t stop. “Steve!” he cried, even though he wasn’t even sure if he could be heard, and then one of the Athenian spearmen managed to get past him, dropping him to his knees.
“She always does that, jumping straight into the point, no emotional welcome back words or even a hug”, Tony shook his head at Steve, who seemed to be trying to figure out what exactly the relationship between Pepper and Tony was. They were bantering and their talk wasn’t too formal, and the way Pepper treated him clearly indicated that they were close friends even.
Steve took the coat and looked at it for a moment, before placing it over his shoulders and covering his mouth with the scarf that Tony also handed him.
“Carry on with your insults Spartan, how very cliché of you.” Steve replied, elegantly flicking his wrist to gesture, almost welcoming him.
Happy shook his head as he took a seat on the large, comfortable sofa.
Steve nodded. “Yeah..so, see you tomorrow..Tony”
“You know you were a completely different person, back when I met you,” Steve said. “I had never felt more humiliated in my entire life, and now you say how I’ve taught you things? Like what?”
Steve smiled as he held the door open for him and then stepped inside the car.
The fall of SHIELD only meant one thing; that the Avengers were needed once again, and he didn’t hesitate to suggest that the Earth’s Mightiest Heroes stayed in his Tower. It was fun, trying to allocate everyone to rooms and floors; getting used to a full household was certainly something that Tony wasn’t used to and he quite secretly enjoyed the constant company. Working in the lab with Bruce, bumping into Clint and Thor in the kitchen, arguing about the quality of TV shows with Natasha and sparring with Steve.
“I-iron man...” He moaned.
That particular day, Tony was sitting in his chambers, polishing his sword, when his close friend Rhodey stepped inside. If he wasn’t Tony’s best friend, he would probably get mocked about his female name, but nobody wanted to get on the God’s bad side.
He had done it yet again, whenever there was the slight chance to escape a life that was set for him, he managed to ruin it, by either saying too much or too little. In this case, he blamed his inability to express his true feelings, whether they were caused by the arrows of the cupid or not.
She wasn’t in a good mood, and the shot near Tony’s feet proved it.
That’s when Steve first noticed how reckless this man was. Not accepting to work as a team, take no advice from the others. He shook his head in frustration, grabbing a parachute and getting ready to jump. It was quite the bad start, and his leader instincts were being tested. When he finally reached the battlefield, the situation was out of hand: Thor and Iron Man were fighting, destroying everything in their path.
“That’s right, Steve, carry on...do it for me..”, he muttered, his voice calm and steady, moving his suit accordingly as he leaned forward, now able to taste him as well, his wet tongue reaching for Steve’s neck, trailing it along it, tasting the sweat, his sweet smell taking over him. He slowly moved further up, rubbing his cheek against Steve’s before finally pressing their lips together, getting the kiss he thought that he deserved, his tongue crushing against each other hungrily.
Steve nodded. “You are the son of Ares, and my mother should have no qualms about me sharing a bath with a demigod,” he said, stretching where he stood in the warm water.
Steve nodded, deep in thought. He knew this too well, having to mask his feelings, his anxieties, his fears, when in the presence of others, suffering silently despite the therapy that he was getting for his PTSD. The last thing he expected was to have more in common with Tony Stark than expected.
“Cap!”, Tony shouted, almost by reflex. In his surprise, Steve didn’t correct him, instead he ran towards him and broke the handcuffs using his shield, hugging the man close to his chest.
“Do you have an appointment?”, the woman asked him, finally looking at him in the eyes instead.
Steve nodded, “I’m sure I will warm over time,” he said.
“Steve, sir.”
But the moment was gone and he would never find out what could potentially happen next, as Janet barged into the gym, calling them out for yet another seemingly routine mission. Nobody could really predict that they would split in teams of two and end up captured by what could be considered Iron Man’s greater nuinance of a villain; an encounter with him almost always ended with Tony having to use a different suit of armour for the next outing. He considered himself lucky that he ended up facing him alone, to avoid a brief walk of shame while he covered himself up, coming out of the suit that could cause him third degree burns if he didn’t get rid of it.
Tony rolled his eyes at Steve’s wish, not wanting for him to leave yet again.
Steve shook his head as he took a seat, rubbing his temples. This was the first time that they assembled ever since the incident in New York, and it was all because Tony Stark disappeared. Straight away, they all feared for the worst; just over a year ago, Tony has suffered a heavy attack from AIM and the Mandarin, but the thought that after that, he was going to be safe. Clearly, they were wrong.
He was however surprised to see that the man wasn’t kneeling on the snow because the darts hit him; he was in shock, and it was actually painful to see. With careful steps, Tony walked past the soldiers and knelt down with him.
time, spending so much time on his own, away from everyone else, wishing that Steve was alive, that this didn’t end up that way. And then, he was back. Just like that, the one person that gave him what he really wanted was back.
“Believe me,nobody did until we found you inside that cockpit, frozen. Well, I did, I spotted the shield first and.. it was without a doubt..well, you, Captain America”, Tony pointed out. “And just like I mentioned..we’re miles away from New York, but we’ll depart immediately, take you back and..”, he stopped.
“About what?”, Tony asked back almost straight away.
Steve looked at him with a look that said that this wasn’t up for discussion, taking off the top of his uniform and replacing it with a dark grey shirt, his dog tags hitting against each other and making a light jingling noise.
“Maybe. It would depend on whether or not you really want to, wait, do you want to be able to give love?” Tony asked in return.
“Look out there, Steve.. I really think that those people need you. They need to believe in someone, and you seem to be that person. No pressure or anything, I’m saying that from personal experience”, Tony replied to him, giving him yet another confident smile.
“Uh, thanks?”, Steve muttered as he looked around; the gym was indeed huge, so many machines to choose from, he was so distracted that he almost didn’t spot Tony there. He looked different dressed in sweatpants and a tanktop rather than his usual sharp suits. He was clearly a man who worked out, Steve wouldn’t be able to tell with all his thick blazer that he was normally wearing.
He decided to move, to go on another trip, to go and spread his teachings of peace and law. But who really needed him? He looked at his map and decided that Thebes should be his next adventure.
“My men know very well that dying in battle is considered a privilege. As son of Ares himself, I wouldn’t let any Athenian take the joy of war away from me or my people, and we’ll ensure that the great Sparta stands above any other Greek city. You have your ways, we have ours, and did you come all the way here to talk democracy and tragedies with us?” Tony asked him calmly, not losing his temper this time around.
“Hm..”, Steve said, unable to take something that serious so lightly like Tony did. He wanted to hope that the billionaire was indeed careful and not as carefree as he claimed to be, especially when he knew that people wouldn’t hesitate to plot against him.
“Jet...boots..? You mean that...they can fly..?”, Steve asked him in pure disbelief, not really believing what he was told.
Tony came down the stairs, buttoning up his Armani blazer and smiling at the newcomers. That guy certainly had a sauve air about him, and he reflected his father’s (as seen from the videos, of course) attitude, which Steve was still in the process of trying to decide if he liked it or not. Still, there was something about that man, something that he couldn’t place his finger on. Not in a bad way, of course, but then again, they didn’t really introduce themselves to each other.
“You better get used to staying here. You’re not going anywhere until we figure out what is happening.”, Steve finally replied. He would hate to keep someone under custody like that, like a common criminal, but Tony wasn't making this easy for him in the slightest, not cooperating. Not to mention that every time that he looked at him, he was reminded of his Tony, his death, his last argument with him.
Steve then realised that they were placed in a room where what he thought were mirrors, were in fact a glass, he was sure that people were watching him with their handy dandy notepads in hand, ready to take notes. He clenched his fists, nodding. With a quick pull, the sheet was removed.
Tony smiled to him, kissing him softly in return, lacing their fingers as he enjoyed Steve's company. “I just wish that I met you sooner."
Maybe being Captain America again wouldn’t be so bad after all, but would it give Steve another purpose to live and fight when everything seemed lost? Was he going to just fight an aimless battle to offer nothing to the world? That was his fear, of being rejected and forgotten, but Tony made it clear that even if that was the case, one soul would believe in him, and that was the engineer himself.
Steve relaxed, tilting his head and peeking over his shoulder to try and see Tony, but he could only see the tips of his curls, smiling at the comfort that sight alone brought. He let out a happy murmur as he felt the kisses to his skin, sighing softly.
“Sometimes that’s how soldiers should act-”
“That’s enough! Both of you!”, he yelled, trying to be in charge and settle things.
“To you, maybe. He was really fond of you, you know”, Tony replied, his eyes set on Loki.
He didn't know if Steve wanted him to stay or not but he saw the moment Steve realized he was still there.
“Gone shopping, will see you tonight. A note, really? Not a text?”, Tony read out loud from the piece of paper on Steve’s pillow. Still, there was something so endearing in the way Steve insisted on leaving notes around the mansion, almost always accompanying his text with little drawings here and there. He didn’t know it, but Tony was keeping every single one in a folder in his closet. Some of them were embarrassing, sure, but every single one meant something to Tony, no matter how unimportant Steve would consider it.
The blonde moved something from the back of the closet, taking a dark green uniform outside and placing it carefully on the bed, dusting the pins on the shoulders and chest carefully. Tony recognised it from the various photos he had seen of Steve in old newspapers, even though they were extremely rare; it was easier to find photos and articles of him in his Cap attire instead.
“Tony.. don’t make me look like the bad guy in front of someone that famous”, Stane said, shaking his finger in front of Tony’s nose.
“Someone like me?” Steve said, kneeling to take a closer inspection of the device.  “Please, I wish I could make such things.”
“I can’t say that, Tony, you know that very well..”, Steve replied, kneeling down to match Tony’s height, still away from him as he was commanded.
Steve blinked. “I had thought being a man of Sparta you would have...”
Tony examined him; was he breaking down in front of him? Was he about to do so? He wasn't sure, but something told him that Steve needed to hear him.
Tony remained silent as he enjoyed Steve’s comfort, and for that moment, he didn’t feel all alone any more. The way Steve touched him meant that he was understood for once, that Steve knew him. “Well, I want to do something on my own this time around,” Tony said his voice low.
, he giggled.
The next morning, Tony woke up a bit too close to Steve, quickly pulling away and hoping that his drooling wasn’t noticeable.
“I like you..and I missed you..did you get that?”, Tony asked him softly.
A notification on the tablet distracted him.
“I couldn’t agree more” Tony agreed, stroking Steve's cheek with the back of his hand. “I’m glad you came all the way to Sparta, despite everything that happened between us. I felt that we bonded, in a way.”
“I know but… they’re looking for you. Your team, your friends. There’s no point keeping you here… and I'm sure that they can protect you just as much as we can, right?”, Steve asked as he took off his cowl, running his fingers through his hair.
“You trust a complete stranger to sleep on the same floor as you do? And you’re willingly giving him access to so many things?”, Steve asked.
Steve scraped his teeth over his lower lip at the feel of Tony's mouth on his skin, and then he made up his mind, forgetting his caution and his shielded nature to duck his head and kiss Tony's neck. Why should he hold back, especially after that sign in his dreams?
“Oh, James, you’re just embarrassing yourself now”, she chuckled, and Bucky responded with a slight pout as Steve returned to Tony’s side.
Tony was almost out of breath, not even sure why. The Athenian felt so good when they were close, almost like he belonged there. Yes, he'd had other persons approach him, but this felt so much stronger. It was different.
“He’s not slowing down”, Thor said with concern, ready to fly up to Tony’s rescue. Before they knew it, Hulk arrived down to their level, with a rather beaten up Tony on his hands. They both ran up to him, throwing the helmet to the side, examining Tony’s state.
“You have no motive to help me.” Steve said, walking toward the door.
Bingo.
“Jet boots!”,  Tony exclaimed, arms spread open, expecting a cheer from Steve.
Steve wasn’t going to lie, it really was exciting.
“How long. Did you now?”
“You had taken a sip from it, right? You had some of the water in the fountain of youth, I know the story. You’re the one... the ageless warrior,” he said with a small nod, tapping on the medallion around his neck. “You know, I can’t die either.”
“Yes. And leave us alone.”
Captain America, his skills would surely amaze him now that he was able to witness them in person.
Steve tilted his head as he felt his lips part, Tony’s tongue pushing forward. The moment it did, Steve let out a small sound of surprise at the warmth of Tony’s tongue filling his mouth, the taste of wine that Tony had drunk. Steve’s hands reached up and brushed through Tony’s curls, Steve didn't know what to do with his hands so he reached up and brushed them through Tony's curls because he was being touched, his body was being appreciated in ways he’d never imagined, and he wanted to touch back.
Steve obeyed, feeling refreshed as the cold water was hitting his face. “Was the meeting all right?” he asked, changing into a fresh blue shirt himself.
“I gave up my chance, long ago. But you are young, you should have hope. And fate works in mysterious ways. We cannot do much but trust those who weave the threads.”
“Trust me.”, the man demanded in a calm voice.
“Mr. Stark informed me that you’ll be staying here..?”
He loved how open Tony was, how strong of a warrior he was, too, and how determined he was to keep Steve there despite his attempts to leave. Those attempts would have been successful, if Steve hadn't been dealing with the son of Ares, a man with a natural fire in his blood. Not only that, but he was a demigod too, one that was as pure as he was himself, and they were both experimenting and learning their likes and dislikes it seemed.
Passing over the bridge was uneventful, even though many merchants tried to sell their goods to him, but it was also where he had the chance to try raisins for the first time in his life, a new exotic delicacy that he enjoyed, savouring the sweet taste. Then he found a few more familiar things, such as olives, which were, of course, something he was used to.
They fought, they managed to win, and Steve rose up to deliver one of his speeches that made him who he was; the Captain America. They would bury their dead and then get back on their feet, be who they always were, the Avengers. They defended the world and put asides their own selves, and they wouldn’t just rebuild Asgard, they would rebuild their team, the world. Tony felt a fiery passion burning inside him when Steve was uttering those words. The soldier knew exactly how to boost up the morale of his troops, and this is why he was their Captain after all.
Rhodey looked at them both, almost like he was trying to get more of an explanation, but he got none, other than a look from Tony that said that he would explain things to him once they were alone.
“I hate you, Steve.. I hate you for making me love you so much..” Tony whispered, gripping tightly on Steve’s collar of his shirt. The man had a soft smell over him, the warm smell of sweet, red apples, a smell that Tony treasured so much.
“Why do you need a bodyguard?”, Steve asked him.
As he approached the door, he pressed his ear against it. Nothing, there was only silence. Taking a deep breath, he opened the door, rolling inside.
“Are you asking me to break them down?” Steve whispered, imploring silently.
“There is no evidence to prove that you are genuine,” Steve said. “Law and judgement are based on evidence.”
The Captain was shaking with anger, walking over to the panel and punching it, even though the voice continued to talk.
“Rogers - new suit is ready. Out on work. Be home later. -TS.”
Together, he had no idea where this could lead them, but he knew that the moment when Steve gently got his hand around his waist and lifted them both in the air, that only good things could come out of all this. The blonde didn’t seem to be losing his focus anymore as Tony cupped his face, lips touching his own, the long, soft kiss doing the talk for them.
For a few moments, neither of them said anything. Steve eventually lifted his own arms, wrapping them around Tony’s waist. It was comforting, even though no words were being said.
Steve moved along with Tony, his body easily swayed despite its large build, and he wrapped his arms firmly around the dark haired man, pulling back only to break the kiss and stare into Tony’s eyes with heavy breaths escaping lips swollen from the kiss.
There it was, his Captain America uniform, all patched up, like he had never been in the ice in first place. The star in the centre, the scales on the arms and shoulders, everything seemed untouched. His cowl was resting there on top of everything, the wings on the side standing up prideful. This was it, he was going to save Tony, he was going to wear the uniform and there was no turning back, not now, not ever.
“Tests? What are you talking about here?”, Tony asked in return, giving the older man a serious, questioning look.
Steve Rogers was resting against the wall, next to the empty, single cell, shutting his eyes and waiting for the older saloon owner. He got a good look at him the night before, but he only showed up for a while because he had to; big towns sure had weird customs.
“You’re located on Earth 616. This isn't your universe, you somehow ended up dimension hopping. What was the last thing that you remember doing?”, Reed interfered.
“I have no idea… but he better explain this when we find him.”, Rhodey replied. “Making us chase after him all across the country, we’re even going global and still nothing.”
Steve placed his other hand on Tony’s waist, sliding it down. “How do you manage to be so alluring, Spartan?” he asked softly.
“Right. The meeting is on the ground floor, I’m sure you can occupy yourself for a couple of hours until I’m done, right?”, Tony asked as he opened his suitcase, pulling out a dark suit and started changing into it.
Steve held Tony close, looking down at him. “Now what?” he asked.
Looking at the technological equipment in the room, Steve decided to find more about it later, but for now, maybe getting under the hot water could help him relax a tiny bit, just escape his thoughts and keep himself warm. Tony didn’t pass by to give him clothes or a towel, but exploring the floor could be a good idea, since he hated to stay somewhere he wasn’t familiar with.
“You still think I can teach you things?” Steve asked, still surprised to be invited back.
Tony took in all the sounds that Steve had made so far, encouraging him to keep going, wanting to take things slowly just to give Steve enough time to see if he really wanted all of this. And when Tony's hands finally reached his front, Tony stopped them to rest them just above it, continuing to reassure Steve with his soft kisses.
Steve swallowed heavily, shutting his eyes, “I will be killed, your spear through my chest, and I will die by your feet. You and your people will have Athens and enslave my people.”
Days passed and Tony seemed to fully comprehend how everything worked around this strange new universe. He wore the Iron Man suit, he went out on patrol with Steve, he was confident that in case of an attack, he was capable of fighting efficiently. That and the fact that he was receiving lessons from the master of combat himself, Captain America.
Steve sighed a little and picked up a brush, dabbing it into the paint before using the back of a tablet to paint on, gently making marks. “It’s pretty simple. It just takes practice.”
“Back to your posts people! Nothing to see here, except the next big thing in cybernetics!”
“This.. this is a memory box”, Steve simply said with a huff. “I keep, well, used to keep, things in here that meant a lot to me.. they still do”, he said as opened it and swallowed down, taking out some old sepia photos. He couldn’t help but smile nostalgically as he went through them all; him and Bucky smiling, the Commandos behind them, him and Cynthia laying on the grass, a picture of Peggy later on, looking so focused as she was reading a letter, her dark lipstick defined even in the old photograph.
He'd spent so long painting him, copying every small detail and shade on Tony's skin, and it made Steve realise how magnificently sculpted Tony was, as if he hadn't realised enough the night before when his lips had been his guide. He felt even more drawn to him; he wanted to explore him more. So, instead of replying, Steve continued with the passionate kisses to Tony’s neck, his long blonde hair falling to glide along Tony’s skin. Steve hadn’t felt so inspired to draw anyone, and yet Tony had managed to catch his eye right away, a muse to Steve already.
“Of course you can,” Tony nodded. “I’m sure you’re hiding a lot of talents from me. And if you want, I can teach you a couple of tricks of my own.”
Tony ducked as he saw Steve’s fists coming towards him, targeting a soldier behind them who tried to attack Tony when he leaned down to help Steve.
“No, Tony.. I can’t do it, not now”, Steve said firmly, sticking to his ideas. “Just.. give me some time to think, all right? I’ll stay here for the time being, I’ll contact you when I’ll make my decision..”, he said as he stood up.
“I think he should come in, Tony, we’re not barbarians. If we don’t let him in we might as well join the Persians," Rhodey said carefully.
“You are dealing with me! What the hell did you think that you do here? Ruining people’s live, you did this to me and everyone in that hospital! You are cowards, all of you, you- aaah!”
“You too, Tony”, Steve said. He didn’t want him to leave, Tony had been there ever since he woke up, but the moment that the billionaire closed the door behind him, he was alone again.
“They also talk about how you are a demon,” Steve added leaning down to fix his sandals, making sure they were tied on properly. “Worse than the ones that rest in Pandora’s Box.”
“Well, in our case… we did argue and exchanged some… not so kind words. But he’s a good leader. He might be stubborn and hard to deal with, but he’s a good, decent guy. I haven’t seen him in so long, but he shook hands and parted ways in good terms.”, he nodded.
When he did pull back, Tony raised his hand and rubbed Steve’s cheek with such affection, a grateful smile on his face. “It really did, Steve? Do you want to, well, will you do me the honour of sleeping beside me tonight?” he asked.
“Affirmative”, Tony replied as he watched Steve examining the arms of the suit, always unable to hide his excitement when it came to Tony’s own creations, which he seemed to love way more than he initially thought he would. “Mr Stark requested that you try my new functions, sir”, he said with a cheeky smile, holding back a chuckle.
“Where are we..?”
“Kind of hard to believe”, Tony raised an eybrow.
“Nothing at all?"  Tony said in a lower tone. “You can’t teach me how to talk, how to charm the crowds? How to act, how to draw, how to write? How to solve equations, recognize the constellations?” He wanted Steve know exactly what he wanted to learn from him. In a way, maybe Steve was right, maybe he was less cultivated and his savage side was stronger, but he wanted to change. He couldn’t just go to war and ruin a city that tried to help them, kill a man that saw past him in so little time. “You can’t teach me all that?” he asked again, his hand still raised.
Steve’s voice sounded nothing like the calm, soothing voice of his from the night before; he seemed ready to explode, he could only imagine how he felt. To hear that his life was ruined in the name of so called science, that he was exploited so blatantly, and that the man who he seemed to trust the most at that point of his life worked for those men...
“Your ambushes have harmed people in the past, I will not fall victim to them,” he said. “You are a siren; you lure me in here then you drown me in my own blood.”
“And why exactly are you asking that, Stane?”, Tony asked him defensively. “That shouldn’t concern you, Steve is here as a guest, not any lab rat or whatever you might be planning”
“Of course I would say that,” Tony said, moving into the embrace. “You, a lone Athenian came into Sparta and challenged me. That shows great bravery."
“I’m doing what Mr. Stark programmed me to do, sir. He merely wanted me to entertain you while he was away”, he said, nodding slightly.
“Is this… some kind of sick joke…?”, Steve asked between gritted teeth, feeling so close to throwing up, swallowing down heavy.
“You should respect the dead,” he muttered, gathering his composure as he picked up the scrolls again.
T’Challa. Always so wordy.
After all, he was trusted with many duties, and negotiating was one of them. The man in front of him seemed so devoted to his cause and, if the circumstances were different, perhaps he could have learned a couple of things from him. But still, when the Greeks were fighting amongst them, just like the Trojans did before, there was no time for empathy, and surely not for the enemy. The Peloponnesian alliance was relying on them, and there was no way he could back down now.
Steve pinched the bridge of his nose lightly to stop himself from displaying how pained he was by such ideals. “I do not wish to follow the example of those who fight over and over without cause, including the Gods,” he said, taking a step back. “I will heed your words, Spartan, though I will not endorse such behaviour. I never will. War is tragic, and the lives lost are countless. That is something I fight against, and I always will.”
“This isn't Tony. At least not
“Just go! I’ll take care of this!”, Steve insisted as he dodged an attack from Stane who was laughing maniacally.
Tony grimaced but he'd been hurt in so many more painful ways before. Steve’s attempts didn’t scare him in the slightest. “Then stop acting like one and listen to me!” he said.
Steve’s voice was really calm for someone who was on the verge of death, but Tony didn’t dare to question it, he looked into the face of death way too many times to count himself.
“Nothing?”, Bruce asked as he looked up from his screen as soon as Steve and Thor walked inside, back from yet another scouting mission at the other side of the country.
Steve looked over at him sadly. “You stop yourself from changing,” he admitted. “So many barriers, so much chaos and you’re torn between becoming a good person... And being a God.”
“Stark.. You know that’s an one way trip, right?”, came Steve’s voice in his ear.
He’s been talking about him? The thought made his heart flutter slightly, but scolded himself straight away; pull yourself together, Rogers, this isn’t about your wishful thinking or whatever, Tony Stark is simply interested in this project, not you. He needed to argue with himself a bit more, since when he developed the slight interest about Tony Stark?
“And you know nothing of Athenians yet you say we are weaker than you. Our knowledge, our ethics are what make us strong human beings, not pointless violence and killing. Not parading around killing the innocent, pillaging like savages until there is nothing but the bare bones of a city left,” he said, lowering his hand back to his side as he watched Tony flinch away from him.
“No…no… but that’s not what I wanted…”, Steve shook his head, fists clenching. “I didn't want him to die because of me… because he was tired of being a disappointment to me… that’s a lie, he really wasn't that.”
Tilting his head, he pulled it out, wiping the dust from the top of it and taking out a large film reel. “Oh.. I forgot they gave me those.. the pictures..”, he recalled.
With much more ease than before, Steve started hovering himself, getting a bit higher and giving Tony the thumbs up.
“Ah yes, your intense training,” Steve said, lying by the fire with his weight on one elbow.
The moment that he spotted the walls he had only seen once before, he held more tightly onto his spear, the medallion feeling so heavy around his neck.
“Would you ride with me all night to get back to Sparta?” Tony asked, wanting to be sure he understood correctly. “Just to be with me?”
Tony wasn’t sleeping, he couldn’t shut an eye after realising what the implications of having Steve there would be. For years now, Rhodey, and later Pepper joined in as well, would tease and question his love for Captain America. They would comment on it in amusement, call him a typical fan boy, but to Tony, it was way more than that. What he thought to be a kid obsession turned out to be something he would carry for a lifetime, and that room where he kept all the Captain America merchandise, and the memorabilia he acquired later, was kept a secret. Captain America marked him and helped him during his early years, and even as an adult, he would seek refugee to his stories and great achievements, get inspired by him.
Steve nodded to him and walked forward, opening the main door of the building, walking up the stairs. “The last step is a bit creaky.. the landlord would always tell us to skip it at night to avoid causing more noise..”, he told Tony as they stopped in front of a door. The building looked so dusty, and Tony tried to ignore the mould creeping in the corner, staying close to Steve when he stared at the wooden door with the number 8 on it.
“How.. do I..?”
“Come on, you can do it, for me”, he said again in a lower face, his hand reaching up to make Steve look down to him, wanting to see his face at all times.
The page that Steve was looking at was a rough sketch of a gauntlet, with a really rushed handwriting detailing the different orbs that seemed to be attached to it.
“Not much of a desk jockey, right?”.
Their first meeting didn’t exactly turn out to be good. Neither did their second one. Or the third. In general, it didn’t meet up anybody’s expectations.
Hank and T’Challa were in the Mansion’s lab, working to find a way to reverse “the bite”. He heard them talking about a curse, but of course they believed that whatever was going on with him was reversible and curable. Tony joined them from time to time but right now he was more focused on trying to help Steve speak properly again.
“So, you’re Howard’s son, right? I knew your father, he was a good man”, he broke the silence, looking at Tony’s profile as soon as he removed his helmet. He did resemble the elder Stark a lot.
Little by little, Tony finally managed to fit himself inside, gasping against Steve's skin. He was already wound up at the heat of Steve's body, at what he was doing to Steve. “Are you ready?” he asked, wanting Steve’s permission before thrusting inside.
It was impossible to fall asleep. He just couldn’t do it, after not spending nearly seven decades trapped in ice. If anyone was going to ask, he would surely reply that sleeping for so long must have been enough. He didn’t think of the consequences of waking up, surely his insomnia that he suffered from during the war would have gotten worse now. He predicted many sleepless nights in his future and that made him sigh.
“I’ve seen this before..”, Tony muttered, taking out his notebook and going through the pages.
“You learned pretty fast," Tony said simply, lowering his gaze to watch Steve's hand on his stomach.
Steve’s chest felt heavy, but whenever Kang was bluffing or not, this had to be done.
“What does it do?” Steve asked, “How does it keep you alive?”
“I’m not a savage, I’m as cultivated as you, you know,” Tony insisted. “Trust me, you’ll be surprised.”
Tony spent so much time looking at everything, admiring the beauty of a different city. It has been so foolish of him to want to ruin a place so promising, when everyone, including his people, could learn from this part of Greece. Instead of fighting, they could learn from each other. There was no need to ruin what made each city different.
Tony was there, sporting a labcoat over his usual expensive suit, walking to him
“Sharing is a pretty vague word,” Tony answered slowly, before he finally admitted it: “Women have been in this bed before just not in the way that people believe they did. And they are free to walk around here, to participate in everything, they are equal. They are fighters just like us; we don’t keep them locked up like you do, Athenian. That’s more like the justice you speak of, right?”
“You.. Do you mean that you believe in me?”
“We can go back to the palace if you want to, they are private baths there,” Tony replied, and Steve started to panic. “Hey, hey calm down, there's no need to panic now.”
“I was in the middle of something very important…”, Tony muttered, not remembering how long it had been since he stepped outside that lab room. Calling his Steve a lab rat before seemed so much harsher now that he had been on the other side of the insult.
Tony shook his head. He didn't want to hear that he was a disappointment. He had heard it so many times before, and now Steve was saying it yet again, it felt different, it hurt far more.
“I can’t vouch for that, you know. If you’re familiar with my title, I’m sure you know what people say about me," Tony said as he noticed the way Steve was looking at his chest.
He took a step closer to the water, standing by the edge as he removed the cloth by his waist, holding it out as he stepped in elegantly, careful to hide everything below his waist as he slipped into the warm water.
“Actually, you seemed eager to come with me,” Steve reminded him. “In disguise if need be.”
The rest of the crew had moved closer to him, some of them taking off their goggles to make sure that their eyes weren’t playing tricks to them.
“Hey”, he simply said as he walked towards him, the round object in his hands covered with a paper bag.
“What? What is it now?”, Steve growled, trying his hardest not to look back at Tony laying dead on the cold, metal table.
“Just like...that...”
Tony couldn’t help but watch the man’s muscular build, the way his shoulder blades would move, the muscles tensing when he stood and walked. And the steam must surely be playing games with his eyes; the man in front of him, who had looked so like a child of Aphrodite before now looked instead like a brother to Adonis. His beauty was beyond this world, and Tony couldn’t help but stare, letting his own tunic slip as he moved closer.
His voice shook slightly as he vividly recalled what he was shown, knowing he should have accepted his fate, but part of him just wanted to fight against it, change it, but it was written already.
“Perfect?” Tony asked, lifting his head to give Steve a soft kiss. “You really felt that way about it? I was worried; you are after the son of the virgin goddess, I had to take good care of you, you really deserve the best."
“What the hell was that about?”, Tony demanded to know, still standing on the same spot that he was, before the wall lowered.
“Spectacular,” Steve said, smiling as he lowered his lips to Tony's neck. “I haven’t slept so well in my life. You, Spartan, are truly gifted.”
Tony could see he felt alone, isolated, and that he wanted nothing more than for this fight to be over. “Because I’ll tell my people that they are wrong, that there’s room for change,” Tony said. “That attacking your city will only bring further torment to our home. And if you don’t want to be here, take me with you.”
Among the many ancient cities in Greece, there were two empires that rivalled one another due to the many social and cultural differences they had. The first was Athens, the largest city in Greece, ruled by the goddess Athena, city of wisdom and justice where the priorities were education and law. It was one of the most respected cities and one of the most beautiful, with its many architectural wonders that often astounded outsiders and visitors to the city.
He shook his head, disappointed in a pointless plight that would bear no results but a lost faith in the Spartans. What faith in their humanity he had seemed to fizzle out the more he was told. “Democracy involves a heart, Spartan. You do not possess that,” he said.
“Mr. Stark, we got it out!”, someone yelled, holding up the shield in their hands.
“Up late again? When will you ever learn, Tony?”, a soft voice was heard behind him, and he felt the gentle touch on his shoulder right away.
When Tony walked in the living room he had on that floor the next day, his hair carefully styled and looking serious in his clean suit, he didn’t expect Steve to be there, holding a mug between his palms and sitting on the large couch. His own hair was parted, but still not in the exact neat style it was on his Cap posters back in the day. He looked strange in a pair of jeans and a dark blue shirt, mainly because Tony expected him to look more..old fashioned.
“The Doc is dead and the formula died with him, that’s what I believe”, Steve interrupted their argument. “The serum worked on me, just me and that was it. It’s way too dangerous to assume that the same results would have any effect on a different person”
“Here we are. If you need anything, let me know”, she announced, lightly pushing Steve outside the elevator.
“Put that suit on, let’s go a few rounds”, Steve said coldly. “Let’s see what makes you special”, he hissed, his hand reaching for him.
“We did it! He’s gone for good, right?”
Steve continued to look at Tony. “Do you not want me here?” He asked.
“Tony”, Steve said after the credits of yet another episode started to roll. “Can I ask you for a favour?”, he asked. Being in the Tower was nice, the facilities were indeed amazing and Tony was making sure that he wasn’t deprived of anything. And yet, he couldn’t live like that, he couldn’t just sit back and enjoy a comfortable life that someone else was offering him.
“Not really… Tony and the rest of the Avengers were the ones that found me in the ice. He took me in straight away, helped me get back on my feet, and offered me a home… I'm… forever grateful for that…”, Steve trailed of, remembering the day like it was yesterday.
“That’s.. one of the oldest ones, I think, when they first started making them.. I remember Bucky’s reaction when we watched it together”, Steve said with a small laugh. “I gotta say, they were pretty inaccurate, but he took it more personally than I did”
“Avengers Assemble!”, Steve cried out, everyone gathering around him and Tony, their weapons and fists lifted up to face off the imminent threat.
“Do you want it to end?” Tony asked as he looked at him, still rubbing his chest lightly.
“No, no, that’s great, thank you, Stark”, Steve shook his head. “Oh um.. a change of clothes, towels..?”, he asked
Tony wanted to make sure that Steve was comfortable enough before he carried on with the soft caresses on his shoulders, leaning to press soft kisses to the man’s chest instead, his hand still resting by Steve’s front to give him time to get used to the feeling.
If there was one thing Tony Stark loved, it was to be in control no matter the circumstance. However, his time with Steve Rogers meant that he had to put that thought to the backburner and actually consider being submissive, after all, the man was a Captain, a super soldier who was used to good old morals and certainly wasn’t used to being with other men. Their relationship had advanced to a point where they were sleeping with one another, but Tony always took the more submissive role to make Steve feel comfortable. He had it stuck in his head that he had to be a man, and thus had to have the role of one. That was the only thing about their relationship that Tony had a problem with, considering he was pretty headstrong himself and he was doing his best to accommodate his partner, and he expected the feeling to be reciprocated, but no matter what he tried Steve would always end up on top or nothing would happen at all.
That look of submission and the fact that Steve was actually fighting back, or attempting to do so, only encouraged Tony to be a bit rougher with him, establishing his dominance over the Captain, having missed that feeling so much. His eyes were fixed on the soldier, noticing every single change in his voice and the way he was looking at him, the moans and clashing of the metal parts being a proper symphony to well-trained ears.
For that second, Steve saw his life flash before his eyes, and he held Tony’s hands tightly as he kept his eyes on him, dropping to his knees by Tony’s feet. He looked up, staring at Tony and staring up, his hands untangling from Tony’s grip as he reached up for him, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth with wide blue pleading eyes.
“No, it’s never that simple, is it?”
“What good will that do me and my people?” Steve asked, losing hope and hating being where he was, his arms wrapping around himself.
“You have no right to tell me what a hero is.” Steve said, brushing himself off and glaring back at Tony.
No, he couldn’t do that, not when Steve was so kind to him, teaching him so much, giving him things that no other had ever given him.
He couldn’t, however, find a button to press, anything that would activate the machine in front of him, but when he waved at the screen, it lit up, making him blink in surprise. The background was of deep blue colour, but when he tried to press the keys, a loud beep was heard and a window came up on the screen, asking him for a password.
It felt nice to have casual conversations like that and for both of them to let go of their constant worries, relaxing for what it seemed ages. In fact, meeting each other seemed to be the highlight of their days lately.
“Steve..?” he murmured. “Would you mind if one day we were more than just friends?”
“There was no other way, Steve-“
It had already been a week since they buried him. He was buried next to Maria and Howard, in the family grave. The funeral was broadcasted everywhere, Tony really got a funeral of a hero. No mention of the Illuminati fiasco, even though the looks that T’Challa, Reed Richards and Stephen Strange exchanged with Steve Rogers did raise a lot of questions. Not that Steve seemed inclined to answer any questions that Carol or Bucky asked him. He wasn't going to taint the man’s memory like that, not when he watched his coffin being placed sit feet under.
“I’m fine”, Steve said as he took a deep breath. “So, where are you living?”
Tony frowned. “Should I excuse myself for taking that for granted and just getting undressed?” he asked.
The breach of cold into his warm body made his mouth hang open almost instantly. It was difficult to relax with the long extension being pushed into him, he could feel every single bend, every twitch it made. He wanted to call something out, but he didn’t know what, so he continued with the pants, trying to relax his body just as he would tell Tony to.
Steve blushed slightly. “I appreciate the compliment, though you aren’t particularly hard on the eyes yourself. No wonder the women fawn over you.”
“Is that you worrying about me?”, Tony joked, trying to lighten up the mood, but so far his attempts to do that proved to be fruitless.
“Good morning”, he said as he sat down next to him. “I see you helped yourself with the coffee”, he pointed out.
Steve shifted uncomfortably at being called ‘ageless.’ He didn’t often reveal that he couldn’t age, especially to others, and he had known that his story was being spread around Greece.
Tony was still thinking of that moment, of that kiss waiting to happen but never did. “Y-yeah..but look at you! You’re flying!”, he exclaimed after he got back to his senses, not staring at Steve’s pectorals peeking through the wet white shirt.
“Steve Rogers, it’s a pleasure to meet you”, Steve nodded. Tony was certainly confident, which was sort of soothing; at least he seemed more trustworthy than scientists, there was something eerie about them, even though they promised him so much.
“Don’t overdo it! Give him another one to stabilise the pulse”, he commanded once he saw the soldier’s body tensing, the heart rates starting to rise up; there was no doubt about it, he managed to survive and maybe, they could even wake him up. “Step away now!”, he called, moving closer and being careful not to slip in the melt water surrounding the metal bed.
“Yeah?”, Tony asked with a yawn, fixing his night shirt.
Once the Spartans came into their territory, they stood, and Steve narrowed his eyes, raising his head as their general signalled the attack. He charged forward, knocking men back with his shield, trying not to kill them but simply to maim them.
“I don’t think so”, Steve joined in, cracking his knuckles.
“It seems so. There seemed to be reports of gems attached on the gauntlet. According to legends and various stories from around the world, the ‘Infinity Stones’ granted the wearer of the Gauntlet all kinds of different powers.Time manipulation was one of them, can you imagine, being able to control time and space? Anyway, they’re probably precious stones, which explains the different colours..”
“Don’t call me that”, Steve growled straight away, waving his finger at him.
Steve kept his eyes on Tony as he was pushed up, his scrolls rolling to the floor the instant Tony pinned him up.
“I’ve been wanting to meet you for months now, I’m not going away just yet!”, Tony exclaimed as he flew on the bed and took a sit, crossing his legs and arms.
“New functions? What, you have more little rockets in your fingers or something?” He asked. Steve would always address the AI as though it was a real person, it was a habit of his, and he couldn’t just hear a voice like that and not think it was real, especially if it was coming out of something tangible.
“You can?” Steve asked, lightly resting his hand over Tony’s shoulder as they walked.
“Leave it, it’s fine. I’ll stay on my side, don’t worry”, Steve reassured him as he left down their bags and went ahead to wash his hands and unpack.
“What the..”, one of them said with widened eyes, pointing with his gun at Steve, but the weapon was knocked out, only to receive himself a hard punch on the jaw.
“-Tony. I cannot thank you enough for this opportunity, I will admit, I was skeptical, I didn’t think that they look..that good, feel so real. I don’t even need to think about them moving the way normal feet do, they just...do it.”
Steve shook his head. “Is there any other room I may go to?” he asked, looking for another room quite frantically.
Steve looked at him with a deadpan expression instead. “I wish to leave this place and never to return except in battle. If wisdom is what you seek, pray to my mother. I have little time for your escapades. You say you are not playing games and yet your mind changes more often than a coin turning in the air. I have been tortured long enough by you.”
It took him days to reach his destination and, just as he thought, the ruler didn’t really seem fond of an alliance. But they talked everything through, and Tony decided to stay in the city, so big and busy and completely different from Sparta, for a while.
“Steve, don’t..”
“Don’t play with me like this; I know this is some sort of trap,” Steve muttered, “I would be giving you my people's knowledge, and that is all we have.”
Tony of course rewarded him, kissing the huge wet nose and Steve chuckled, a weird sound but cute nevertheless, at least to Tony.
“Uh...I was only aiming for the teeth, it’s not like I was trying to kill you or something..”
Steve’s fingers began to slip a bit lower, stroking the nape of the Tony’s neck as he stared at Tony, cheeks pink.
“I have nothing to give you that you say you don’t already have,” Steve said, looking to the other side again.
“I wouldn’t deem it mercy or pity; I would say that it’s more fun and interesting to watch your city walls fall, stone by stone, the city burning when we’ll celebrate our glorious victory. We do not possess empathy because we’re fine warriors instead, we focus on what matters, not hiding like cowards behind beautiful words," Tony replied as he approached him, their noses almost touching as he was looking straight back to the man’s eyes. “Is that all? You came all the way down to Sparta to try and insult us? That’s pathetic.”
“What?” Steve asked, turning his head to look at Tony.
“Bring the digging equipment with you, Rhodey! There’s something we need to see..”, Tony shouted back, squinting his eyes behind the large goggles to inspect the iceberg, getting closer to what it seemed to be the cockpit anyway.
Steve shrugged. “Not bad, for something Spartan made,” he said.
Steve’s blush covered his face and he panted heavily, strands of his golden hair beginning to stick to his skin as his strong arms buckled, and he used his elbows to prop himself up instead, raising his lower body for Tony. The sound of their bodies against one another was exactly like in his dream, and he let out another round of moans, his mouth opening widely as the pleasure slowly started to kick in, encouraging his lower body movement even more.
“Just that your cooking skills, from what I had heard,” Steve said, taking another bite. “You have a reputation for not being the best of cooks. Though apparently what I heard was wrong.”
Tony swallowed hard when he heard that question. Steve might not understand if he explained. “I didn’t sleep with them in the way that you think. We didn’t. Do anything together; they were just in my bed. I hate sleeping alone.”
“I'm not saying that what he thought was right… he didn't seem to be in a good mindset and acted in a really brash and quick way; he did however stop that incursion that you mentioned… and saved all of you for now. This wasn't your fault, Steve, he didn't do this to guilt trip you, he’s not like that, I know that I'm not, and I'm sure that he would agree.”
“Tony, what are those?”, Steve asked curiously, dragging him along a small bridge right behind the majestic church. He was looking at the bridge’s sides, both covered with different kinds of padlocks.
“More than many others before me. I intend to change them for the better.”
“That’s right”, the blonde replied, relieved that he didn’t have to shrug and shove away the possible comments about his Captain America status again.
“Herr Stark, what about the offer...?”
”, the voice replied.
“I’m just being honest, isn’t that what people do?” Tony said, even though he shivered when he felt Steve’s touch on his shoulder, almost protesting when he pulled away. “We all appreciate some good honesty around here.”
“Them…?”, Steve asked, resisting the urge to gasp loudly when he was faced with yet another horrific sight, straight out of a sick and twisted horror movie.
“So.. what does it do exactly? I mean, to you..?”
Tony spoke with such bitterness, and Steve could understand why; the device on his chest did seem painful to keep there. “Does it hurt..?”
Tony’s moves weren’t so elegant, and he had to swallow hard and shake his head when Steve talked to him, surprised that Steve wasn't asking him to leave. “What? Uh, no, not at all, I’ve came here before on my own, just not too often,” he replied as he moved to the edge and stepped into the warm water too, being careful to keep his distance from Steve. “I saw no need to come here since I’ve been sharing baths for all my life.”
“And I just knew that… this wasn't worth it, it wasn't supposed to end like this… he wasn't supposed to die from something like this…”
Steve appeared taller than he was to him as his back was straight, towering over Tony menacingly. An ex soldier was angry with him, an ex soldier with legs able to send him across the room and break multiple bones of his body.
“Your games with my mind are proving tiresome,” Steve said, giving him an unimpressed stare.
“Then I’m happy with that we have right now,” Tony said. “Can we keep this?”
“No, I won’t leave you alone,” Tony said as he knelt down and started to collect his things, turning his back to Steve. “Just let me dress up and we’ll find something for you”,
Reed walked over to one of the numerous panels in his lab, pressing a couple of buttons and stepping at the side as soon as a metal door slid open, a large surgical table with a white blanket covering what it seemed to be a human figure.
“Wait, before you do this”, he started, sitting on the bed instead.
Tony could tell that he was going to get an earful later, but at that moment, Steve was all that counted. He ordered the suit to pull the gloves off, his own hands finally touching Steve’s hips, massaging and rubbing the soft flesh on his own time, unable to stop as he was finally touching him.
He started to cut off the fur, keeping himself warm as he looked at his bloody hands; the son of Ares, that’s who he would always be. Why had he even thought that a simple demigod could change him, that he could even love someone? No, he was destined to be alone and carry out his father’s thirst for blood, just as expected.
