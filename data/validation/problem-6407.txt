“Uh,” Steve looked away.  “Sorry.  Never mind.  Dinner’ll probably be ready in a hour if you want.  Uh--”
“Ooh, is that us?” Pepper asked, stepping into the kitchen. On screen, they were shimmying their butts and shoulders in unison, then shaking their hands.

Also, I've been politely advised to offer you all a warning that this chapter contains Tony/OFC/OMC (though not very explicitly).  I think it's good for the story and I'm happy with it, but if you hate the idea of Tony with anyone but Steve (even briefly), you can skip down to the phrase "Back at the tower" to avoid it.
“Fine,” Clint gritted out. (Tony took a deep shuddering breath.) “Had to jump before they swarmed, but I missed the landing and I . . . I think my ankle’s broken. Shit!”
“And thank you for dealing with the cell phone situation.  You know I hate it when you skimp on eating and sleeping, but, well—” She looked apologetic.  “I’m glad you could get it sorted so quickly.”  Pepper grimaced.  “I can’t believe they tried to cover up the malfunction!  I could have brought in the big guns earlier if they’d said something instead of just flailing around thinking it would sort itself out at the last minute.”  She shook her head.
They murmured their acquiescence. Tony’s jaw nearly dropped at the sight of William Tyrone Macmillan III leaving a serious a business negotiation for a trivial social nicety.

you.”  Steve’s voice was almost small as he added, looking down, “I want you any way you’ll have me.”
“Good boy,” Steve thrust in hard. “Letting me have you, just the way I want . . . So fucking pretty . . .”
The castle itself seemed small, but it was hard to get a clear sense.  The guards led them down a long corridor and paused by a large double door.
Steve frowned at Clint very slightly, then said to Tony with utmost sincerity.  “I just can’t believe how fast you whipped up the prototypes!”
Tony stayed silent. He didn’t want Rhodey on the line for this. Still, it was good to hear his voice. “What the hell are you doing?” Rhodey demanded.
“Come up here, sweetheart,” he said, urging Tony up into his lap, both legs off to one side. “Come on.”
“Oh, don’t give me that!  You know why you’re grounded.”  Tony shook his head at the bot and grabbed another screwdriver.  “Thanks, Steve.  Now hold this one
"I'd be a gift, like a pretty bauble," Steve growled, slamming the goblet down.  Wine sloshed over the rim, splashing across the table and staining the nearby papers red.  "A sex slave."
“No, no,” Bruce said, shaking his head. “We are. Don’t listen to me. It’s . . . habit. We have a plan. I agreed to it.”
“You’re beautiful,” Steve whispered, stroking Tony’s cheekbone with his thumb. He licked his lips. Then his eyes slid closed and he tilted his head to the side, cupping Tony’s face tenderly in his hands as he brought their lips together.
Tony pulled the door open wide and stepped out of the way. After a moment of tense hesitation, Steve slunk inside, keeping his face and his body turned away from Tony’s.
“I want you to know,” Steve whispered back.  He shivered and pressed his head to Tony’s chest as he added, “I want you to know, even when it’s hard to say.”
“Because it would be okay if you weren’t, you know?” Tony said.  He meant to sound firm, but it sounded tentative instead.
Tony held in a sigh. Mrs. Rhodes meant well. (Maybe she wouldn’t wanna talk about it outright? Or maybe it was Rhodey and--) Tony glanced over.
Cap shook his head.  “You may know Tony well enough to realize he’d never be causal with a teammate, but you don’t know me at all.”
Tony snorted and Bruce looked up.  He frowned and repeated what they’d both been saying for the past fifteen minutes: “We only needed forty-five minutes.  How could this happen?”
His jaw dropped open at the sight before him: Pepper was wearing her Wonder Woman armor with nothing over it and pointing an old Stark Industries Glock 17 at his head, her hands perfectly steady.
Tony watched Steve pad naked to the doorway, footsteps nearly silent; he moved as gracefully as a dancer. His flawless muscles flowed under flawless skin. The perfect Dom, both superficially and truly: a perfect human biological specimen, and also devoted, tender, generous, noble.
Steve bit his lip, then asked, his voice gentle as he held his arms open, “Could you—could you please come here?  And get back in bed with me?”
Tony’s jaw dropped. “Jesus, Katie! What are you doing here?” He shook his head. “Why didn’t you say anything? PR can wait. Or Michael can handle it. Go home—be with your family.”
“Shit!” Tony turned to Steve, then back to Bruce, then back to Steve. “Steve! Sorry. I forgot I’m supposed to look at something, but I can be done in—Twenty? Thirty minutes?”
about the spreadsheet at all.  Tony would just grab him and . . . and he’d push him up against the wall and kiss him, then order him to his knees with his hands behind his back . . . maybe this time, Tony would tie them in place . . . “Beg for it, baby . . . Steve, tell me how bad you want me . . .”
Clint shook his head. “Dude, I can’t believe you’re this slow. Like hell Cap’s playing basketball right before Valentine’s day. He’s probably spent nineteen hours walking around Bergdorff Goodman’s trying to figure out what to buy for the sub who has everything.”
“Sir,” JARVIS said through the HUD, “may I remind you that energy reserves are growing low.” It should have been a question; JARVIS made it a statement.
. Something sharp and unpleasant and suspiciously like jealousy. (But it couldn’t be jealousy, because that was ridiculous. There was nothing to be jealous over!)
“Thank you, Bruce,” Steve said his voice going a little thick. Somehow Bruce always managed to make him feel better.  “I really appreciate your—”
When he tumbled out of the emergency stairs, Tony was unprepared for the sight that greeted him. Steve was outside, standing barefoot in the snow, wearing only boxers and a t-shirt. His body shuddered violently and his fists clenched the railing.
Then Tony closed a hand firmly around his balls, not quite pain but an intense sensation; Tony took Steve’s cock in his mouth and made him wail.  He wanted to come so badly it hurt, but he couldn’t.  (Not allowed . . . don’t you dare. . .)  Tony tugged at his balls and it pushed the urgency away a bit, but only a little and Steve fought himself to stay still ( be good!) but couldn’t stop fucking up a little, pushing his aching cock up into all the wet tight heat of Tony’s mouth.  (Breathe, breathe…)
After a few moments he reached up for Steve’s hand, pulled it around to kiss his palm and then moved it to his head.  (Hint hint.) Steve chuckled and began to stroke his hair.
Tony suspected that Pepper had a chat with Bruce before she left; there was something uncanny about Bruce’s ability to channel Pepper, but since Tony adored her—annoying nurturing and all—he wasn’t gonna complain.  Much.
When Steve shrugged off Tony’s compliments and before Tony could remember that he kinda hated going to art museums, Tony found himself asking if Steve would like to see the newly restored Islamic Art Wing at the Met.  The smile Steve gave him was dazzling and, yeah, totally worth snoring past some twelfth century vases.  (And, hey, if Steve can make
Steve drew Tony’s hands up, one then the other, and kissed his palms. He spoke softly: “Then I accept.”
“Well,” Bruce began, “what we know for sure is that none of these portals have been the same. The first three appearances were in the same—genre? type? class?” He shook his head. “Whatever we call it, those first three all look related. Each instance was an intensification of the original traits. For one thing, gamma radiation and reactor diffusion. But the energy disturbance on Thanksgiving and now today are radically different.”
“Well,” Tony announced after skimming the readings, “whatever it is it isn’t one of those spider things—not related to them in any way as far as I can tell. They weren’t carbon-based organisms and this one is. Sending it to you now, Bruce. You’re the better biologist.”
“Yeah,” Tony agreed. Steve was glaring daggers at his bread plate.  “Hey, sorry I asked.  We’re on a date. So, no more work talk, all right?”
“Tony, I’m so sorry,” Steve said, getting to his feet when he realized the seating was full. “Please take my seat.”
Steve ran his fingers softly through Tony’s hair. He kissed his neck and Tony shivered and rubbed his body against Steve’s in a filthy motion.
“Yeah.”  Tony nodded earnestly, then grimaced.  He let out a bitter little laugh.  “Won’t be glad to see
Captain America had just entered the mess hall, carrying a tray of the same mediocre food and wearing a plain blue SHIELD training uniform. Tom felt as confused as Captain Rogers looked.
“Oh sweetie,” Rebecca murmured, face sad. She kissed his temple and tightened her fist in his hair. “Don’t worry.”
“Cap,” Natasha said, “It’s been mimicking you. Why don’t you just have Iron Man fly you up as a demonstration?”
Belford nodded. “Domosterone inhibits the key psychoactive properties; we’re developing a separate drug for top drop.” Belford gave a little shrug and added, “though I’m hardly best qualified to go into detail on the neurochemistry—I’m only CFO.”
“No, you really can’t.”  Pepper paused.  “Well.  It’s been far too long, Mr. Stark.  Is your schedule clear for lunch tomorrow?  I’ll still be in town.  Shall I have my assistant call your assistant to check?”
—really is a date. That I didn’t misunderstand. I mean, right after we talked, I was positive! But the more I thought about it and the later it got, well . . .” Steve gave a sheepish smile and trailed off with a shrug.
When Tony finally surfaced, there were twelve training bots ready to take out to the ranch. He’d really been in the groove and—once all the details had been worked out—it hadn’t actually taken that long to put the finishing touches on all the old skeletons. It was soothing, pleasant work. He hadn’t gotten to the Stark Industries tech yet, but there was lots of time. Besides, who could say—maybe R&D would actually come up with a worthwhile upgrade on their own this quarter. (Anything’s possible. In theory.)
But now, they sat catty-corner, and in the silence Steve sometimes bumped his knee against Tony’s, then smiled.  And when Steve left his hand on the table, Tony sometimes gave it a little squeeze before grabbing another breadstick or picking up his glass of wine.
“Scrap that, J. Send the chart to the back. Give me . . .” (Fuck.) “Give me 7344. Yeah. And run a double check on my calculations on, uh, on 7217.”
Rebecca gave Deetz a meaningful look, the kind of wordless code longtime partners used. (Totally not envy. Not at all.) She kissed Tony on the cheek and then led him away, her arm linked with his.
“Yeah, yeah, Brucie,”  Tony waved at him.  “I’ll give you this one, though you never stated an explicit hypothesis.  You just dropped not-as-subtle-as-you-thought *hints* at your hypothesis.  So, actually, no--  you can’t have full credit.”
“This was stupid. Maybe I should cancel. Shit!” Tony waved his hands, unable to keep any part of himself still. “The press is going to go crazy! They’ll make it gross—like I’m bending over for my Captain or I’m team whore. Or maybe they’ll say Steve demanded it like some creepy
Rogers blinked, looking surprised by the question. As he considered it, he seemed a little amused and then more than a little wistful. He looked away.
Bruce, Natasha, and Steve nodded; so did Clint, but his nod was far from convincing. (Ah. Hence the guilty look.) Tony didn’t even bother pretending.
Ugh. Team romance? Gonna wreak havoc for them in the field. And can you imagine a break up? I mean, what are the odds that this is a long term thing? Mark my words, no good will come of it. This is why I never date coworkers!
Dedicated to MsSparks who has returned at last!  The internet was a sadder place without you, my dear.
“Nah, super-villains remember their last ass-kicking too vividly.  They won’t be stirring for a while.”
“Aw, yeah?” Steve asked, lilting Brooklyn. He pulled Tony close and placed a kiss on his cheek, whispering, “Pretty sure he’s already gone on you.”
“I’ve emailed the précis of the other events and coverage we recommend, to you and your team. I’ll expect to talk to you shortly.”

Tony forced himself not to grimace in return. (Ew. Gross.) If he had a dollar for every time some asshole used that fucking fundraiser as a bad pick-up line he’d . . . well, who’s keeping track? He was already a billionaire.
To Tony’s surprise, every few minutes Clint would whip out his phone to take pictures of every dish and everybody on his Starkphone. Tony opened his mouth to tease, but there was something oddly sweet about Clint’s sudden inclination to photograph the team. Tony wondered if Clint had many happy memories of previous Thanksgivings for comparison. Somehow he doubted it.
Phillips snorted.  "No, but I'm fit to serve as I do."  His mouth formed something almost like a smile as he added, "And I kill every plant I touch."
Files:  Boring and predictable.  A decade by decade precis of American history that, judging by its amateur level of historiography, was drawn up by some conscripted SHIELD agent.  A huge bibliography of works on American history, by period and theme.  Cold War.  Vietnam.  Civil Rights Movement.  Silent Revolution.  About 200 eBooks downloaded to his imitation Stark Tablet.  (SHIELD were a bunch of cheap bastards.)  Handbooks on weapons safety.  SHIELD ethics handbooks.  (Ha!  Those would a be a delightful exercise in fiction.)
“Of course I know that,” Rogers replied, a hint of mischief in his voice, “but it was the best pretext I could come up with.”  He shrugged.  “I’ve been wanting a peek at your workshop.”  He peered about curiously.  “It’s pretty swell.  What kind of bike were you working on?”
But he couldn’t.  The winds were cold--nothing like the warm, gentle breezes  that shook the olive trees of Italia--and he’d heard Northmen were as harsh and cold as their climate.
“Uh,” Tony looked at the portal data, “I’m actually still kind of in the middle of something. I think it may be a late night in the workshop for me. Go on up without me?”
“If you have another theory--get another sudden inspiration--can I trust you to talk it through with us first?”
“Tony would never hurt me,” Steve said indignantly.  “And why would you *threaten* Tony? That’s terrible!”
“Well, I couldn’t handle the cold very well as a kid. I used to watch the other kids from the window and wish . . .” He trailed off for a moment. “Then
“It is this time,” Tony said taking out his phone and scrolling through it. “You’ve got a whole set of hashtags. My favorites are ‘
Tony drifted away from the kitchen as Mrs. Rhodes marshaled her troops and gave them their marching orders. She knew better than to let Tony cook—Christmas 1991 has pretty much put an end to that. (What? He’d paid for the damage!)
“Not at all, Captain Rogers,” Mikie reassured him with a kind smile. “Please have a seat and we’ll get started.”
As they poured out of the limo exchanging ‘good nights’ and thanking Francis for driving, Tony’s eyes kept straying to Steve. Steve smiled.
Behind him, Tony heard the elevator doors open and the voices of his teammates. They went quiet when they saw the conference call. Tony turned to wave at them as Linda followed up.
“Thank you.” She stepped wide around him, as though his clumsiness were so overwhelming he might bump into her again while standing still. “Well. Have a good day.”
“You really don’t need to worry about that, Cap,” Tony answered with a laugh. “Everybody uses them, but hardly anybody knows how they work. You’re not behind the curve there, Big Guy.”
“I’ve got you, baby,” Tony whispered roughly.  It was like the wind had been knocked out of him.  His body felt wrung out.   “You were so good for me, so perfect. . . .  So strong, taking what I give you. . . . shhh, so good.”
“Already?” Tony said in mock surprise, as Dominick pulled up a new slide.  “That was fast! I’m amazed you could make PowerPoint slides while Captain America was talking.”
Tony blinked and stared at Rogers for a moment before asking curiously, “Are you in trouble for that little stunt?”
Steve took a deep breath and looked around the workshop, then back to Tony. He took a cautious step forward, very slowly, and said, “I know you, Tony. Really I do, but
Tony was startled from his thoughts by one of Dummy’s familiar little chirps.  (10% volume; good bot.)  Tony opened his eyes and smiled at the sight of Dummy with a large bottle of Smart Water extended in his claw.
“So, just wanted to check,” Clint said eventually, reaching back to scratch at his right shoulder blade. “We still on for burgers?”
“Then lead competently,” Tony shot back. “Actually, never mind. And, no, before you ask—I won’t be investing in— Sorry, what was it called again?”
“No rush, Tony.  I’m--”  Rhodey shifted and let out a little wince, then gave a wry little smile.  “Seriously, man.  No rush.”
“Fuck!  Oh fuck, Steve,” Tony gasped, then dropped his voice to growl.  “Stay there.  Stay just.  Like. That.”
Tony braced himself for questions or an awkward ‘sure is nice out’ or something, but the moments turned into minutes and Steve just stood there silently, gazing at the moon, not even glancing in Tony’s direction. (Not that Tony kept glancing at
had the best spread, not least of all because they got to cap off their story with some amazing candid shots of the team joking around, having burgers, and looking like one big happy family. Caption:
“Shut up,” Tony muttered. He was surrounded by dozens upon dozens of schematics, their glow faint. “Shut up. 'm thinking.”
“So, look,” Clint began, “I get that you’ve had a lot of adjusting to do.  To the twenty-first century.”  (As if Cap might need clarification on that.)  “It must be disorienting.”
“Really, I’m sorry,” Steve was saying, then added with an uneasy laugh. “I, just, I’ve never—and I’m so worried I’ll disappoint you or worse I’ll hurt you or something and--.” He let out a miserable sigh. “I’m supposed to know what I’m doing, but . . .” he shrugged.
Tony hesitated. He was hungry, and he did want to go to Ray’s—but he also didn’t want to. Rogers was . . . disorienting. The thought of Rogers and Rhodey together was even more so.
"Yeah," Steve agreed with a sigh.  Steve looked down and touched the blanket. He gave Tony a questioning look.
.) Tony unbuttoned another button and arranged his burgundy pocket square. Then he did up that last button again; he didn’t want to look tawdry.
between us, I mean, if I wasn’t imagining things.  I would never have asked him.  It took some fucking guts to--”
Steve didn’t want to be the first to speak. He recited Emily Dickinson in his mind, wondering if Tony liked poetry. (No. Probably not.)
(Maybe an even lighter poly-aramid for the sleeves; sacrifice some protection for flexibility, but still better than bare skin.)
“Sorry,” Tony said, wishing he hadn’t spoken. “That’s not on you. I shouldn’t have said anything, just, it was weird, you know? Meeting you. The guy he wanted me to be. Just, you know . . . weird.”
“I know you said coffee was enough, but I was there anyway and these looked especially good to me.” Rogers smiled a little and set them both on the side table next to the console.  “I wasn’t sure what you might like, so I just got an assortment.”
“Definitely,” Tony enthused, rapidly gathering steam, “and I’ll have Vera Wang or Martha Stewart do the decorations! Or, no, wait. Maybe we should do that ourselves? That’d be nice, right? We can decorate it together and drink mulled wine and eggnog and stuff. And, if you get back from Magdalene House in time, we can all eat dinner together or something. How does that sound?”
“Let’s hope that won’t be necessary,” Steve said with a little smile.  He nodded politely to the band leader as they passed; he nodded back and smiled at Steve.
Thank you all from the bottom of my heart.  Hoping to have the rest of this (somewhat abridged) chapter to you soon!
“Oh, right. Yeah. Okay.” Rhodey drank deeply from the cup. “Hey, Steve, have you heard any Michael Jackson yet? ‘cause he’s the
And Tony knew why Natasha wasn’t trying to visit—her spider senses recognized that he was in his lair for a reason and didn’t want visitors—but Steve . . . In three days Steve hadn’t asked after him? Or wanted to watch
Rogers shook his head, looked back and forth between Tony and Bruce, and asked them both, “So, if this thing is a portal, we can expect something to try and come through, right?”
There was something slow and deliberate about the way Steve touched him, as if it were all part of a detailed and carefully considered plan. Steve kissed Tony again and stroked his hands up and down Tony’s back, as if mapping his spine, sides, shoulder blades, tailbone.
(Shit, shit, shit.) Tony hovered indecisive, really wishing Pepper were there or he had a brain-to-brain link that would let her give him advice without anybody knowing. (Uh, weird. Anyway . . .)
Steve was still on the couch, with the blanket over his lap. Tony nearly snorted. (Waiting for that erection to go down, are we?)
Bruce mumbled something about multivitamins and maybe just one G&T; he was wearing a gigantic plaid dressing gown over matching pajamas.
The brisk evening air was helping Belford’s cologne to dissipate. Tony leaned closer. He tilted his head to an alluring angle. “Is that so?”
Back at the Tower, Steve gave them ten minutes to change out of their uniforms before convening at the dinning room table for a debrief. Tony arrived first—after all, he just had to step out of the armor.
Tony’s heart was pounding in his chest. He stared at Steve, who was looking away with unfocused eyes, as if at something in his distant imagination. After a few moments, Steve gave a little sigh as if coming back to himself.
“Do please forgive the interruption,” an elegant woman in her mid-fifties said. (Ah. Margaret Macmillan.) She was stunning in a full skirted, scarlet dress that, like her daughter’s, had an understated sweetheart neckline. Her dark hair was liberally peppered with grey, swept into a Gibson tuck. She looked up at her husband with an apologetic smile. “Tyrone, I’m afraid you really should come say a few words to the archbishop.”
” and they were kissing again, long and lingering and tender. Finally freed, Tony wrapped Steve in his arms and savored the opportunity to caress his back, neck, hair.
“Is that okay?” Steve asked falteringly, as if he might have pulled the chair out incorrectly or with sub-par skill.
“Or you could spread me open with your fingers,” Tony whispered, bringing their bodies together so they were aligned from head to toe.  “Hold me down and fuck me, long and slow or hard and fast.  Fill me up with your gorgeous dick and make me take it.”
Steve came shuddering and trembling in waves of pleasure that went on and on as Tony swallowed and swallowed, fingers still moving in and out, and everythingwas so breathtaking Steve thought he might faint.
Steve took long, deep breaths; beside him Tony did the same and it turned into another round of wet hacking. Steve frowned. He was about to bring Tony some water when the coughing fit passed.
“Oh, fuck off.” Tony bristled defensively. “I’m allowed to--” (miss) “be a little miffed when my Dom decides to bounce for two days to play basketball right before we out ourselves to the public, ok?”
JARVIS was quiet a moment before answering. (Triggering the self-harm protocol authorized JARVIS to report liberally on its trigger, but that didn’t mean he didn’t care about privacy anymore.)
shouldn’t be allowed on covert ops.  Tony wanted to inch a little closer to Bruce, but Rogers had worked his way between them as much as possible without actually touching anyone.
“Steve?” Pepper said, puzzled. “Who’s Steve?” Then, before Tony could answer, her face lit up and she asked, “Oh my gosh, Tony, are you dating again?”
But, Tony realized (feeling like a fool), that hadn’t stopped him from hoping he’d reach subspace anyway.
As he ran a thumb across Tony’s cheekbone, he felt very present. It was strange, strange to kiss Tony Stark with tenderness and have it returned. (Not like last time, not like--)
“He’s roasting the turkey?” Pepper repeated, then laughed and shook her head. “Well, what could be more fitting? He is Captain America after all.”
Steve watched them, the easy back and forth, the playful hints of rough housing-- it was all so achingly familiar. Steve’s eyes were stinging.  His face was hot, but the rest of his body felt cold.
“Yeah?  Cool.  So, I’m gonna head back to the lab, finish up a few things and maybe catch some sleep.  Meet you back up here noonish?”
“I, uh—” Steve fidgeted a little. “Sorry about bursting in like that. I didn’t know you were planning a visit. Or had been injured.” Steve shot Tony a reproachful look.
“Yeah.  Now,” Steve said.  “Besides, we agreed you’d get better hand-to-hand training from Clint or Natasha.  Please excuse me.”  With that, Steve strode purposefully from the room.
Chaos erupted. Agents sprang into action, some attacking the spiders in trios, some trying to hold the perimeter. Black Widow leapt onto one of the creature’s backs—her knife found the vulnerable joint between platelets; when she leapt away, the creature fell, belly-up, legs convulsing. Vibranium flew. Arrows exploded.
“No, it’s fine!” Tony reassured him. “I’ll come down later to look at what you’ve got. I think I might be getting near a break-through too. But, I’ll come down later, ok?”
Thank you so much for your support and sorry for the long wait for this chapter! I ran into trouble with this chapter and needed to do some planning ahead for the rest of the story (and the next one too!).  I'm still not entirely happy with this chapter but figured I had better post it and move on or Steve and Tony will be stuck in limbo indefinitely.
Johnson’s eyebrows shot up with surprise and perhaps a hint of indignation. (Tony had a reputation of a certain sort, after all.)
On the common floor-- formerly part of Tony’s own penthouse goddam it-- Tony followed the same routine calling out identifications: kitchen, gaming console, home theater, and so forth.  Tony’s space was all crisp black and white, sleek lines and sharp angles . . . metal, mirrors, and glass.
(And that was so fucking unfair.  Tony never got full credit for his work in R&D until people were afraid he wasn’t at the top of his game; then the investors and partners ran for the hills.)
“No!  It was . . .” Tony shook his head.  “Habit.  From the past.”  Tony’s voice went light and breezy, tyring to lighten the mood, “Don’t take me so seriously.” Tony shrugged.  “I didn’t mean it.  It was nothing.”
Tony reached down and slipped his pinky under the belt binding Steve’s hands.  He let out a little humming noise of approval and then there was a firm pressure at Steve’s neck and Tony’s hand curled tight around his shoulder.  Steve felt a sharp jolt, part-pleasure and part-anxiety, as he was unbalanced.  Tony bent him over, pushed him down face first.  Tony held Steve there--  his cheek pressed into the cushion, his ass and bound hands high in the air. Steve’s heart was pounding.
“Wouldn’t you like to stay?” Tony’d meant to fill the words with lush sexual promise (or he thought he’d meant to), but instead it came out uncertain.
“I’m pretty good.”  She hesitated.  “Well, I was a bit worried when I couldn’t reach you, but JARVIS swore you were okay.”
Steve licked his lips and took a little step back. Tony stalked closer again, pressing his advantage.
“Naturally, my dear Ms. Winters!” Tony exclaimed, plopping down in an armchair. “Wouldn’t dream of missing it. Uh, even if I never wrote back to your emails. Which, knowing me, I probably didn’t.”
“Well, a lot of people are idiots,” Steve said bluntly, voice annoyed (and a bit more Brooklyn).  Rebecca let out a delighted laugh and nodded her agreement.
Tony grabbed a rag and made a vague attempt to wipe his hands, leaving a dark grease stain on it. He’d been working on the training bots again, refining their interior engines.
“No.”  Steve took a deep breath.  “Then he said that this relationship would draw heavy fire when it went public—which it would because it’s impossible to keep something like this a secret, especially where we’re concerned.  Said people wouldn’t like us together. I told him, rather more delicately, I didn’t give a damn.”
Tom wasn’t sure if the intended subtext was “y’all look alike” or “you’re a scrawny little shrimp, unlike Rhodes, who’s a
“Steve, it’s okay.  Hey, hey, come on.”  Tony ducked down into Steve’s line of sight, smiling.  “Sorry.  My bad, okay?”  (Come on—words, stupid.)  “And, Steve?  I don’t need you to be like me or like Bruce.”  He squeezed Steve’s hand again.  “I just need you to be
)  Steve tried to ignore his swelling cock and concentrate on his reading.  He took a few long even breaths.
“What else could they do?” Rhodey answered, forcing the words out, breathless with laughter. “Stood at attention under civvies and a brassiere, hopin’ to hell he wouldn’t notice!”
(Calm down, stupid.  They’re both fine.)  Tony’s eyes flickered from screen to screen running mental calculations.
Steve wished he could remember more of the poetry he'd memorized in school as a child. Or the verse he'd learned later--the sort they never would have assigned, that he'd picked out himself, wide-eyed in the Brooklyn library.
(Oh fuck.) Tony let out a helpless little noise against Steve's chest. (Shit. Don't say it. Not out loud. Don't--)
As Steve and Pepper started to do the clearing up, Mrs. Rhodes took a photo out of her purse and handed it to Tony. He laughed. She’d brought a picture of him at seventeen, Rhodey twenty-two: both of them looking like sullen teenagers, forced into photographs sitting down at a beautifully set Thanksgiving table.
“Really, you should talk to Dom!” Jerry was saying. “It’s just now noon—he’ll be getting out of the B Gym! You could go talk to him about it!”
Steve bit his throat and he came, dizzy and gasping; his body clenched hard on Steve’s fingers as he spilled between them.
“So, boom, boom—there it is!” Tony said with a grin and a grandiose wave at the projections.  He bowed deeply, then realized Bruce was sort of frowning.  Tony spun and looked at the schematics again.  “Wait, what’s wrong?”
“You know, I really feel like we’re making up for a lot of things I missed in my childhood right now,” Tony said.
And Tony was just trying to decide whether to make some innuendo out of Bruce’s remark when Captain America came striding over.
. . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Steve felt a warm sense of relief to have Bruce's support, could breathe a little easier now that he'd shared his plan. He'd half expected Bruce-- (well, not
“Oh. Good.” Rhodey bumped his shoulder into Tony’s. Tony smiled up at him. “You’ve got a good team,” Rhodey told him again. “It’s good you’re coming up. Unit cohesion and all that.”
“Can you . . . can you teach me how to not gag?  So I can—“  he buried his face against Tony’s shoulder.  (Say it!  He likes it when you say *things* to him!)   Steve whispered into Tony’s ear, “I want to take you deeper.  All the way down my throat.”
Thanks so much everyone who has stuck with me!  I can't believe how long (or how slowly) I've been writing this story.  When I began, I was closer to Steve's age.  Now I'm closer to Tony's.  Crazy, huh?
“Well,” Steve hesitated a moment, “I mean, in an ideal world I guess I’m supposed to, uh, have the . . . patience to wait.” The tips of Steve’s ears were turning pink.
There, surrounded by papers and files, Steve was slumped against the armrest, sound asleep. There was a plate at his feet speckled with a few lingering pizza crumbs. His laptop had been folded up at set aside to his left.
“Number twelve?  Pear, goat’s cheese, and arugula?” Steve frowned. “Isn’t arugula a type of lettuce?”
Below him, Cap’s shield soared. Tony’d lost sight of Natasha—no doubt she was in stealth mode—but he found Clint facing off alone against a pair of spider things, retreating steadily while firing at point blank range.
Steve was making eggs—Tony could smell them frying—and just hoped Steve had made coffee. Lots of coffee.
“As you wish,” Tony said, and couldn’t resist adding, though it probably wasn’t wise or polite, “O Mighty Dragon-slayer King.”
“Yeah,” Steve answered. He sounded more than a little breathless. He gently tipped Tony’s chin up and gave him a lingering kiss, but when Tony parted his lips Steve pulled back.
“So,” Fury said, drawing the word out, long and expansive. Fury was sitting at an imposing mahogany desk. He gestured for Tony to take a seat in the low leather chair opposite; Tony remained standing instead. Fury did not get up. “You’re dating Captain America.”
Steve let out a strangled little laugh. Tony paused to grin up at him, but found Steve’s expression pained. (Shit.) Steve’s shoulders were still tight, his movements stiff. Tony hopped over one of the little railings by the west balcony; he pulled Steve to where the drapes would partially obscure them from the main room. Steve’s breathing was a little shallow and he blinked just a little too much. The noise of the party swirled all around them.
“Well, that’s it,” Tony said, hoisting his shoulder bag back into position.  He liked to travel light. Baby Agent looked confused and wide-eyed.
Somehow, Steve felt like he needed permission to touch Tony’s cock (can’t explain it, doesn’t make sense. . .), but the rest of Tony seemed more approachable.  Steve caressed and squeezed Tony’s ass in his large hands.  He rubbed his cheek against Tony’s thigh and hip bone, the scent of Tony’s arousal heavy in the air.  Tony reached down to run his fingers lightly through Steve’s hair.
He’d really thought that this was it—that Steve would Take Him To Bed, not just take him to his bed. Third date, right?
Tony woke up to find Rhodey in the chair at his side, sound asleep with his head and arms resting on Tony’s bed. Tony was tempted to wake him—to say thank you, to ask for news—but Rhodey looked so exhausted. From what Pepper’d said he and the team had been hunting aliens non-stop for days and days with only brief resting shifts; Rhodey needed the sleep.
“Thank you.”  She toyed with her coffee cup, then said, “So . . . ”  Rebecca leaned a little closer to Steve and Tony and continued, “I hope you don’t mind my asking--how did you two get together?”
“No! I mean, maybe. Sort of?” Steve’s ears started to go pink. “Heck, Tony, we already live together you know! And, I mean, it’s nice that we both have plenty of space to ourselves, even if it feels foreign to me. I just--” Steve looked embarrassed, but pressed on, “I’d just like there to be someplace that really feels
Tony raised his hands to the top button of Steve’s shirt, but before he could undo it Steve pulled his hands away again with a little smile.  He shook his head.
Thank you for all your support and affection!  And thanks so much for reading. (I maybe agonized over this chapter . . . Just a little.)  I hope you liked it!  Thanks again!

“Mr. Stark, would--” Rogers reached his hand out for a moment, brow furrowed.  Tony paused, but Rogers had fallen silent, frozen with his arm outstretched.  After a long moment, Rogers cleared his throat and dropped his hands limp at his sides.
“Shall we?” Steve asked. Tony nodded and rose from the table, then felt a flicker of uncertainty about whether he should have waited for Steve to get his chair. Happily, Steve didn’t seem fussed about it.
“Yeah,” Tony agreed, high and breathy. “But--” Tony laid a hand lightly on Steve’s chest and let his thigh brush against Steve’s as he murmured “—I’m asking which might please you most. The Benz? The Audi? The Lotus?”
“Yeah, sure,” Tony said. “We’re cool. Whatever.”  Tony rubbed the back of his neck for a moment, then offered Bruce a tentative smile.  “So, want to work on those readings?  Because I’ve got another theory.  If we fill our data gap with a theoretical reading, then . . . ”
“I need a gigantic bouquet.”  Tony unscrewed another of Dummy’s joints and replaced the bolt.  “Really big, but one that says friendship not romance.”
Another sip of her vodka. Steve’s stomach began to tighten up into knots; there was something decidedly unnerving about all of this. He felt like he was always missing something, like he couldn’t read between the lines.
, taking deep breaths in and out until he was steadier, calmer.  After a few more minutes, he crossed himself and sat back on the bench.  He paused to savor the beauty of the old church, letting his eyes linger on the geometry of the windows, the elegant proportions of the exposed rafters, the sturdy rows of heavy wooden pews.  (Maybe I should draw the interior sometime…)  He’d adjusted to lots of modern architecture, but this was so lovely and familiar.  He took long deep breaths, as if he could breathe the lovelieness in, hold it tight in his lungs until it spread to his bloodstream and coursed, warm and lingering, through his veins.
Phillips paused.  Steve waited for him to continue.  After waiting a while, Phillips sighed (looking disappointed?) and continued:
Rogers had confessed to Clint once, who'd repeated it to Tony, that he tried to watch a little TV every day to try and adjust to the future, but he found most of it so awful he had to change every few minutes.  Tony certainly knew the feeling.

“Sort of?”  Tony said. “More offering to find a way to share my art collection with the public.  If you like the idea.”
“Oh shit!” Tony exclaimed in mock horror.  “Did I speak without being spoken to?  What was I thinking? Slipped up again—I’ll never find a Dom if I’m such a little brat.”
“Well, I was talking with Natasha yesterday about my status. She said I was effectively discharged after the crash. So I think that means I'd still be eligible for the benefits from the GI Bill, right?” Bruce blinked-- he looked a little surprised but he nodded and Steve charged on. “So, I'd have a scholarship. I could apply to City College and get more of a formal education. I started looking at it on the internet. I did manage to finish high school, though I don't see how I could get copies of my high school transcripts or diploma-- not that they'd do me much good-- but I thought maybe Natasha would be able to help me come up with something. And apparently there are these tests I'd have to take, but I could start studying for those now so I could probably do okay on those.”
And then there were the people speculating about Steve’s mystery sub. Lots were posting pictures of Steve out running with Sam. Some speculated that Natasha was a secret switch, or even a sub. And a few suggested Tony. It wasn’t a popular theory and the objections were utterly predictable. (Too slutty! Too modern! Too old!) Tony rolled his eyes with an exasperated sigh. (Steve wasn’t going to like that. Any of that.)
“Yeah?” Tony sounded a bit relieved.   “Good.  ‘cause it’s really hard for me to work without at least some data points, you know?  And it seemed hard for you to put into words, so I thought this might be, uh, good.”  He kissed the top of Steve’s head.  “But you can talk to me too.   I . . . I like hearing you say it, what you want.”
“You’re so brave,” Steve said, his voice full of wonder. (Brave? Huh?) Tony peeked up at him from under his lashes. Steve’s eyes were wide with amazement, his smile soft.
Confused but intrigued, Tony did.  He explained the equipment that was required in the walls of the entire room so that they could create an illusory surface for the projected light to hit.  The miniature cameras. The pixel density.  Rogers asked a few decent questions—he’d clearly been reading since their chat about the spectrometer.
He tipped his head to the side and stretched out his neck, giving Tony a little look from under his eyelashes.  Was he wearing eyeliner and mascara and--
Tony strode down the hall, practically breathing fire. Harris didn’t follow.  Tony took vicious satisfaction in the way a pair of junior agents jumped nervously out of his way.
“Date was perfect, Steve’s perfect, I promise I’ll tell you more later, but I’ve gotta finish getting dressed.”
Huge massive thank you's to all my cheerleaders and idea-bouncers, especially Ergane, thigmotaxis, and Nonymos, who wrote me beautiful gift fic.
I am.  I’m on a conference call right now with Mr. Lawyer, Mrs. Lawyer, Mr. Director, Ms. Boardmember, and Ms. Potts.  Problem?
A little check mark appeared to tell him Tony’d read his message. He waited, but no little dots followed to tell him Tony was answering.
Tony wasn’t sure how long he’d been tinkering when Steve knocked on the workshop door and stepped inside. Tony knew it was bad; he’d brought the coffee carafe.
JARVIS chose “All the Single Ladies.” Pepper cried out in delight and started singing along as Tony did his best to recreate the famous dance. Pep gave a little catcall and swatted Tony playfully on the hip as he put on a show for her. Alcohol tended to loosen him up, so his hip action was pretty fucking fantastic—until he overbalanced and crashed right into Pepper, who saved him from falling off the table. She clung to him, giggling as she lowered them both to a seated position.
Steve, still sitting on the couch, smiled. “Congratulations,” he said politely. “That’s a happy occasion.”
“Hey, what’s this, man?” Clint asked with a mock glare. “You too good to fight anybody but Captain America himself? Mere humans beneath you?”
“Or before. Or . . . ever.” Steve looked mortified and hid his face in his hands. “Oh, God, Tony I should have told you sooner.”
Tony shrugged. “Once I thought to add mini arc reactors, the whole thing kinda solved itself.” He paused. “Okay, so I got in touch with NASA—they owe me big time—and they’re sending all their recent studies. Should hit your tablet in ten.”
But now it was 7:30.  Steve launched himself from his chair and, unwilling to stay still for the elevator, pounded up the steps from his apartment to Tony’s penthouse.  JARVIS unlocked the doors for him automatically as he moved from floor to floor.
Tony chuckled a little bitterly.  If it had been anything else, he probably would have enjoyed seeing Pepper so mistaken and wrong-footed for once.  She was almost always right about almost always everything; it could have been refreshing to see her get something totally wrong.
Steve sighed. “I told Nat how much I’ve been dreading the next gala. She thinks I’d be more comfortable at big events if I had somebody ‘modern’ at my side to help me navigate. And to discourage, um . . .
Sorry to leave you with a bit of a sex cliffhanger, but I'm leaving on a research trip today and hated to make you wait.  I figured I'd go ahead and post what I'd written so far. . . . Hope you like it!  :-)
“Yeah. I, uh--” Steve began. (Maybe now's the time...) “And I've been thinking about doing something a little more . . . structured.”
“According to the communal calendar, he has two meetings at SHIELD followed by an appointment with Dr. Jefferson, sir. His estimated arrival time at the Tower is six-fifteen pm.”
“I know how you feel, going to Fury’s office,” she said, with a grimace. “It’s really the worst. He’s the only person I know who can make ‘Have a good afternoon, Agent’ sound like a threat.”
“Oh, right,” Tony said with a grimace, looking a little embarrassed. “I just didn't want you to be disappointed, if I couldn't, um--” He glanced down.
“We have your order right here,” the girl said, clearly aiming for professionalism but looking more than a little star-struck. She glanced back and forth between Tony Y. and the Avengers a few times.
Bruce headed towards the elevator, but after a few steps Steve added, “Hey, and Bruce?  Thanks.  For the advice.”
“Glad you like it,” Tony said.  “So, anyway—kitchen’s right there, nice open floor plan.”  Tony felt like he should have more to say, but all he could think of was to point out the obvious as they walked around.
It seemed like there was nothing he could actually do. Maybe they should talk? But about what? (Pizza? No.) What else could he say?
. Part of Tony wanted to apologize to Clint too; but most of him was too pissed to do it). On the field, Steve coped with all the weirdness by being deeply stilted and formal. Only Natasha shot Tony the occasional raised eyebrow or smirking little half smile like usual.
Lots of ambient world building in this chapter, but I promise I won't let anyone intrude on our lovebirds in the next one...  :)
They kissed and kissed, slow and steady. Steve’s cheeks felt hot; there was an awkward, nervous fluttering in his chest. It had been easier last time, when he’d been so angry, heart pounding and adrenaline pulsing through his body—as if he’d been watching someone else do all those things to Tony through a long tunnel.
Tony took another sip of coffee and tried not to sigh audibly with impatience. They’d been at it for hours. (After their talk, Tony’d had a satisfying cuddle with Steve, until eventually Bruce pinged him through JARVIS. As Steve had set out for his run, he'd added tantalizingly, “Besides—I should go. I’ve got shopping to do. And a research project I’m eager to start . . . .”)
“Are you cold?” Tony asked, drawing closer.  Steve shook his head and Tony smiled, looking  smug.  Steve leaned up eagerly and crushed his mouth to Tony’s.  The kiss was rough and urgent, a counterpoint to Tony’s unhurried, gentle caresses between his legs.  Steve kissed Tony desperately, open-mouthed and demanding.  Little by little, Tony gentled their kiss and pulled back.
Steve’s hips gave a sudden jerk, pressing a little harder into Tony’s mouth. (Yes!)  Tony pulled at Steve’s ass, encouraging him to move. With a keening noise, Steve gave a more deliberate little thrust.
Steve shook his head. “It wouldn’t have been fair to ask them to fire Ruth, especially since she had two children to feed. Really, she needed Anna and Luca more than I did.”
“I  . . . I’ll be good.”  Steve could hear Tony panting.  The words came more easily now.  “I’ll make it so good for you.  Please, I want you so bad. . . ”
“Come sit on my lap,” Steve clarified, then added with a glimmer of nervousness, “You liked sitting on my lap last time, didn’t you?”
Thanks for all the cheerleading and to my amazing beta who took a last minute phone call to get this ready.
“Shit!” Tony cried. “Am I late for our date? Did I miss it? I’m so sorry! I was in the zone with my project and must have lost track of time. Please don’t think I—“
“He’s okay,” Tony cut in. “He’s going now. Don’t beat yourself up. But, yeah, Christmas—he’d like that.”
Tony caressed Steve’s thighs, ran teasing fingers across his erection, then brought a slick finger to Steve’s crack.  (Please, please, please . . .)  Steve uncovered his face to stare at Tony, unsure what to do with his hands.  The arc reactor glowed, beautiful and brilliant, in Tony’s chest; it lit his features from below, casting shadows across his face in the dim bedroom.  (Beautiful.)
Tony shrugged and Jackie gave a satisfied nod, before asking as always, “So, are we just doing the usuals today? Or are you gonna get with the modern age and let me fix you up nice?”
, but something about the wistfulness in his tone, the restrained and private answer, that made Tony wonder “from
“Why Rogers!” he exclaimed in an affectedly breathy voice, putting his hand over his heart. “Are you trying to take me on a
In the elevator on the way up the Tower, Steve still seemed tense.  Clint and Natasha hit the gym and Bruce went to his lab.  Steve turned to Tony urgently the moment they were alone.
Steve cleared his throat.  “I can’t believe Clint wanted to give you a shovel talk.”  Steve shook his head, frowning.  “And he thought everyone else would too!”
The film began.  Steve devoured his chili absently.  (There is something kinda nice about seeing old cars in black and white.)  Glancing over, Steve found Tony’d also inhaled his food before the police could even finish raiding the speakeasy.  Steve set their bowls aside and then, very casually, laid his arm along the back of the couch.  He often sat like that.  The back of the couch was just the right height for him to rest his arm there.
Tony pulled a lager from the fridge, then put it back and grabbed an IPA, though it was a poor substitute for Belgian ale. Natasha was curled in the far armchair. Bruce was next to her on the couch, then Rhodey and Rogers with Clint in the opposite armchair. Tony wiggled in between Bruce and Rhodey and grabbed a slice of pizza.
“No!” Tony protested, then looked away and admitted softly, “Well, yes.  I mean--I could feel it.  Couldn’t you?  Bruce was so discouraged; we were losing him.  And then I realized!  Hulk was smelling us.  But he couldn’t smell me in the suit; it was like he thought Iron Man was a danger to the rest of the team.  If I’d waited to talk it through, we’d never have gotten Hulk to a place he could start joining the team.”
Tony’d eaten his food too fast and wanted to go back down to the lab, but couldn’t seem to make himself leave while everyone else was eating. He tried to tune it all out, run some calculations in  his head, but all the politeness and distance, the china and the glasses, were getting under his skin.  Finally he couldn’t hold it in any longer—
The Dom showed no sign of moving (or actually using the bathroom); he just stood in the doorway, blocking the exit. Tony’s pulse was starting to speed up a little.
Tony frowned, fantasy fading. Natasha pounced, spinning Steve around in her grasp, kicking Clint away. Steve threw her to the matt and caught sight of Tony in the doorway.
Infinite thanks to everybody who has waited SO LONG for this chapter and sent me so much love, encouragement, and kindness!  This chapter was going to begin flashing forward to the Ranch, but then Tony just demanded that this part get written too.  So here it is.  I hope you like it!
Steve looked down at Tony with an amused smile, but Tony was flustered and distracted. Steve’s smile fell.
“What, because you’re the Dom?” Tony asked, with a teasing little smile. “Well, if we’re playing by those rules I’m supposed to be some wide-eyed virginal ingénue fifteen years your junior, so I guess we just can’t get anything right.”
Steve rewarded him by returning his mouth to Tony’s cock and taking it in his mouth. (oh yeah!)  Steve circled the head with his tongue a few times before easing down to take as much in as he could, his lips a firm pressure.  He hollowed his cheeks and sucked gently as he moved, slowly and cautiously, no discernible rhythm.  (wet . . . hot . . . wonderful. . .  )
Once Tony was sure damage control was a success, he steered Rogers toward the bar. Cap had seemed pretty surprised to have Tony on his arm and watch him schmooze, but he’d covered it up fast.
“Good morning,” Rogers said with a little smile. He poured a cup of coffee from the carafe and held it out to Tony.
“Cool.  Great,” Tony said.  “Good talk. I’ll be in the workshop, uh, working until . . . whenever.  You know, if aliens invade.  Or Clint orders Chinese. Or something.”
“For fuck’s sake, you’re only human!” Tony snapped back. “Or do you actually think you’re some sort of resurrected demi-god who can bear the world on his shoulders? ‘Cause that’s pretty fucking arrogant if you do!” Tony waved his hands, and narrowly avoided throwing his coffee. He jabbed a finger at Steve, coming closer. Steve took a step back.
Steve’s brow furrowed.  Tony still hadn’t given him the books he’d promised either.  Would it be okay to ask?  Or remind Tony?  Just to reassure him that Steve was totally sincere—he wanted to read whatever Tony wanted him to read.  That should be okay, right?  Well, he’d wanted to ask Tony on a date for Saturday night, so maybe he could remind him at the same time.
This close, the lavender & sandalwood scent was more pronounced, blending with the scotch and abrasive antiseptic of Tony’s bandaged hands.
“I feel pretty fantastic.  And, well, it’s nice that you’re glad to see me.  After the way things ended at MIT, I wasn’t sure . . .”
That evening, Tony put up only token resistance as Bruce coaxed him from the lab.  It had been a long day, Tony was beat (not the fun kind), and Bruce had promised him pizza.
Edited to add: I've invited questions about the world of P&P to try and jump start some more world building and to see what you're curious about.  Feel free to ask over at my tumblr post (http://ms-meredith-milton.tumblr.com/post/149419545576/questions-about-pp) or here if you'd rather.  Thanks! :)
(It was actually a good deal looser than it needed to be, but there was no need to nitpick. Looser was always safer. )
Tony laughed, then added wryly, “And I’m pretty sure Captain America wanted to throw him off the balcony.”
“Political scandal of the early 1970s. The president and his administration broke into the DNC, performed illegal surveillance, and abused their control of the IRS, FBI, and CIA to harass their political opponents. The president resigned before Congress could impeach him and was pardoned by his successor. And the President was . . . was . . . Clinton?—no. No! Wait.”
Tony could hear feet thudding all around him and Steve’s voice commanding, “Take your places! Weapons at the ready! But remember, if something comes out, you hold your fire for threat assessment.”
“Yeah,” Tony said at last, “Kinda in the middle of something here.” He’d hesitated too long. (Shit.) Tony shrugged, then added, “Have fun with Captain America.”
Tony decided pretty quickly that he liked Clint.  He was a bit of an ass, but he didn’t take himself too seriously.  He was a hardcore Dom, but Clint usually dated aggressive switches, so it made sense he got Tony.  (He had, apparently, dated Agent Kate Richards—the butchest, toppiest switch Tony’d ever met—and they were still buddies.)  Clint swore a lot, talked during movies, and sucked at air hockey.  So, yeah, Clint was okay.  Mostly.
What might things be like if he weren’t queer?  It was easy to picture how it was supposed to go, at least according to the patterns he used to know.   He’d have gone for drinks with Agent James and her friends.  Then, after a few times out in a group, he’d have asked her on a proper date.  They’d get to know each other slowly, little by little.  After a few dates, they’d kiss.  Then they’d be going steady.  He’d remember to call her his ‘girlfriend’ instead of his ‘girl.’  Things were different now, so he’d probably have seemed a little too slow, a little too traditional, but eventually, they’d— (Huh.)  Steve blinked.
Pepper set the tablet in Tony’s lap. He snatched it up eagerly as she turned to go, but at the last minute she turned back to him with a soft, hesitant, “Tony?”
Steve relaxed into it, letting Tony hold him up, letting Tony move him, use his mouth and fuck his face.  Steve felt thrilled and breathless, so aroused he might explode but somehow calm at the same time.  (Tony’s in charge . . . I’m pleasing him . . .)
“Scotch,” he ordered briskly, then remembered his manners—the bartender wasn’t the jerk—and added, “please.”
“Sir,” JARVIS said, nearly making Tony jump. “The limo is ready when you are.  Agents Barton and Romanoff are in the elevator.”
“Fuck me!” Tony gasped, unable to hold the words in. “Please, please Steve. Fuck me. Oh, God, fuck me!”
Thanks for reading!  I really hope that turned out okay.  The first section of Sexology is drawn almost verbatim from a real book you can read about on my tumblr, here: http://ms-meredith-milton.tumblr.com/post/96295025326/sexology-1904-world-building-for-power-and-paradox  The other two sections I made up, but with conscious imitation of Wm. Walding's style and attitudes.
Thank you for reading and for your kindness!  There's more on the way (hopefully more quickly this time...).
to come to the Acquisitions meeting.  He hadn’t actually wanted to go—he hated meetings—but he’d volunteered to be
“Oh God, Tony,” Steve murmured, reaching out to caress Tony urgently through his clothes.  He pressed hot, open-mouthed kisses to Tony’s cheek and neck, rutting against him eagerly.  Tony’s eyes fluttered open; he gave Steve a lazy, sleepy smile and rolled his hips again.  Steve threw his head back and Tony nipped at his neck.  Everything felt so good.  He wanted to make Tony feel good.  He wanted Tony to push him down his body, tell him what to do.  Or maybe he should beg for it?  Beg to suck Tony’s cock?
“Look, if you can honestly say that you want to be alone because it’s best for you, I’ll leave you alone. I’ll respect that,” Tony said. “But please don’t hide.”
“I’m sure he didn’t mean that,” Steve said, crouching down to look at Dummy. “Jim says he’s very fond of you.”
Steve let out a hazy little mumble and shifted in his sleep.  Tony tossed aside the water bottle and settled back down again, nestling close.  He needed to call Pepper back.  (Again.  Ugh.)  And he’d have to talk to Whatshisface for her.  McNeil!  Yeah.  And he really needed to figure out how to recycle that tech.  He’d start with the motherboards.  No, the display screens.  Wait, better yet, the keyboards since touch screens and voice commands would soon be phasing out old school keyboards.  He should--
Tony glanced over as his schematic went to screensaver—Classic cars—then back to Steve.  Steve rubbed the back of his neck and looked away for a moment.
“No, of course I remember you, Mr. Silverstein,” Tony said politely. The bartender handed Tony his drink. “You recently left Goldman Sachs for Morgan Stanley, I believe.”
“It’s okay.” Bruce patted him on the hand. “You can’t be a genius at everything. If I want a challenge, I’ll keep playing Steve.”
“What do you mean, ‘mmmm?’” Tony asked indignantly, doing up the buttons on the white shirt a little more slowly.
“Things changed when I got the serum.  Nobody could hold me down and do things to me if I didn’t want them to.  Regular ropes weren’t gonna hold me anymore.”  The first hint of a smile played at the corner of Steve’s lips and his voice was returning to normal.
. . . He thought he’d failed in his duty.)  Steve bit his lip.  Being together—like this—was so much
“Tony?” Steve’s voice was hesitant. Tony held his breath, frozen. “Are you okay? I’m sorry.” He swallowed, then asked, “Is this no good for you?”
UPDATED Author's Note: July 24, 2014:  Sorry for the delay on the next chapter!  I've been struggling with work and a big deadline coming up, am now out of the country for an ill-timed vacation where internet is very spotty, and the next chapter is proving a challenge.  All in all, sorry for the slow progress, all is well, story not abandoned, and I should be back with you in early August.  Sorry and thanks for your patience!
Like, for real guys, no natural human can look even close to Cap, except maybe Chris Evans who (read the interviews) literally did nothing but diet and work out for a YEAR to look close, which was fucked up. 3/3
“Yeah.  I haven’t figured out the details yet,” Tony admitted, “But I was thinking about what you said this morning.  About my art being in storage. And how art should be for everyone. So I thought, if you’d like, we could set it up.  Maybe someplace in Brooklyn? Maybe put it up on loan to BAM? Or get our own space? Free to the public.”
Thanks to everyone who has stuck with me for all these years, most especially my beautiful beta, thatwhichyields!
Pepper dropped by with papers to sign. She stroked Tony’s hair, gave him a kiss, then left him to his work, exiting with the clicking of stilettos and a soft, “call if you need me.”
“Well, he’s in the workshop if you need him, though I hope you don’t need him for too long.  I have to drag him to a meeting—a live meeting with actual people in a room together-- in about forty minutes.”  She looked a little frazzled as she brushed her too-long bangs out of her eyes.
Steve gave her a grateful smile; she just inclined her head slightly in return. They drank their tea without another word for a few minutes; Natasha was patient, but he wasn't quite ready to say more. Natasha slid off the bar stool with preternatural grace.
Rhodey shrugged and streched. “Slow. At this point, we’re hardly finding one a day, hiding away someplace dark, but we’re not sure if it’s time to call off the search.” He shook his head. “Banner put together a team and has been using our footage to calculate how many came through, then he and some guy in forensics have been trying to separate the goo and tally up the bodies. Looks like we should be done soon though.”
“Is it really?” Pepper asked, her voice tense and worried. “God! I just want to shake that man and tell him I don’t fucking care if he’s Captain America-- if he does anything that hurts Tony they’ll never find his body!”
Steve’s smile looked like happiness—not a blinding, flashy sort of joy, but something soft and shy and gentle—and Tony could feel his own smile matching it, even as he watched Steve walking away and the elevator doors closing on his smiling face.
play by Marquise of Queensbury rules. They’re really known for sportsmanship.”  Tony rolled his eyes.  “Riiiight.”
One by one, all Tony’s buttons came undone; Steve stroked his shoulders as he slid the shirt off.  When Tony looked up through his lashes, he saw Steve’s eyes fixed on the arc reactor. He didn’t touch it—of course not, that was in Tony’s contract—but he looked and opened his mouth to say something (no doubt something kind and reassuring).  But after a moment’s pause, he shook his head and leaned in to kiss Tony again, hands mapping the bare skin of Tony’s back, shoulders, arms.
is one of your favorite pictures,” Rogers said as he cooked.  “I can sure see why.  It was really amazing.”
Tony’s shivering abated as the heat lamps kicked into full swing. The air was crisp, cold but not punishing. Tony looked out at the dark expanse of Central Park. Over across the city, stood the mansion he’d grown up in, ostentatiously claiming a whole city block. He’d be going back there tomorrow morning. Back to where Mom and Howard--
Steve’s chest and throat felt tight, his skin hot; he was awash with a nearly overwhelming mix of guilt and gratitude, longing and joy.  He was at a loss for words, so instead he just
“Can I help you?” Professor Ellis asked politely as he stepped out of his office and saw Steve waiting. His greying beard was meticulously trimmed, his old brown shoes carefully polished, and his old-fashioned jacket well brushed.
Bemused, Steve complied. Tony dropped the pillow against the couch at Pepper’s feet and folded to his knees beside her. She let out a pleased little murmur.
Tony fidgeted a little as Rhodey looked at him, expression soft as he added, “I’ve only ever wanted to see you happy, Tones. Ever since MIT.”
“Don’t worry so much,” Mikie said, coming over to rest a reassuring hand on Cap’s shoulder. “You’ll do great. I lit a candle for you.”
“You looked beautiful bound for me, Steve,” Tony murmured as he slid his hands down Steve’s arms to lavish attention on his wrists.  Tony leaned down to kiss Steve’s wrist and palm as he added, “Tied up and desperate.  I loved seeing you like that.”
like a ‘50s Dom.)  The others were perched on Tony’s chrome and leather barstools, serving themselves pancakes, bacon, and fruit from a set of platters Tony’d never seen before.
“Christmas cookies,” he said with a little smile. “I know Steve said Chinese was fine tonight, but I thought he would appreciate having something a little more traditional.”
“About fucking time!  Hey, Bruce, how about the south side entrance for the main spectrometer base?”
“You shouldn't have to change,” she said, voice tinged with helpless frustration. “We weren’t doing anything wrong.”
“Nope, not that I know of, but there are some good ones left—don’t worry. I’ll pick something upbeat,” Tony promised, then said, casually, “Oh, hey, but before we get settled with
Like Tony was some wild doe to be tamed with scraps.  Was making Tony an omelet a victory somehow?  Did that mean Tony’d lost?
Tony squawked and his jaw dropped.  (Yeah, ick— should have swallowed first.)  And Steve was looking at him with his ‘trying to suppress my grin and mostly failing’ look.
Little by little, Steve uncoiled, his chest rising and falling with long, even breaths while Tony stroked him.
“Doesn’t mean he can’t be contained,” Bruce said, urgently, “Between my chemical knowledge and your engineering genius, we—“
Tony scooted closer to put his hand on Steve’s shoulder, half afraid he’d be shaken off, but he shouldn’t have worried. This time, Steve leaned into the touch, breathing deeply. Tony wrapped his arms around him.
“Isn’t my first time on this battlefield--and now I’ve got back up.”  Tony shrugged. “We’ve got a plan,” Tony said. “Just stick to the plan.”
“How’re you holding up?” Tony asked, smiling up at Steve once he found him again.  Tony squeezed Steve’s hand and pulled him over to the window, away from the crowd.
“It’s weird, isn’t it?” Steve asked, frowning into his coffee cup.  “Going into high alert and then all this waiting?”
Natasha looked at the PR gurus with polite interest; Bruce with ill-concealed discomfort; and Clint with an expression oddly like guilt. Steve, of course, gave them his rapt attention, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees.
The nastiness of the internet was familiar to Tony—after all, his public infamy predated the internet itself—and he was pretty well inoculated, but he wondered about Cap again. As a kid or young teen, had anyone called him a bitch? A slag?
“First round of tests, he said, ‘It’s obviously a mistake’ and patted me on the shoulder, but once they came back the same again and again—full sub—he wasn’t so confident. There was this new test—hypersensitive, just brought over from Geneva. His last hope.”
“I’ve got a bottle of Veuve Cliquot chilling in the executive suite,” she said softly. “Are you sure I can’t entice you to join me?”
Rogers added over his shoulder, “And since I know how much SHIELD Agents pride themselves on efficiency, you might want to start packing now. Because the direction I’m walking is to Fury’s office.”
Steve smiled back at him.  (Something’s off.  Or is it?  Am I paranoid?  Oh fuck.  Did he just look over his shoulder?)
Tomorrow marks P&P’s 2 year anniversary!  I posted that first chapter 2 years ago, having no idea what an amazing (and loooooong) journey I was setting out on.  Thank you for joining me and making the last two years so amazing.
“Tony, wait.”  She didn’t say it loudly, Rogers and Barton were just in the other room, but she said it
First Tony put on his favorite charcoal suit and a burgundy tie, then decided it was too much and changed into his favorite black slacks and a burgundy dress shirt. Then decided it was too casual and changed back into the suit. He wanted to change again, but he wasn’t fucking fifteen anymore so he refused to give in.
Tony was thinking about Rogers again and it pissed him off.  Why the hell did that guy get under his skin so badly?  (Okay, Howard might have something to do with it. Whatever.)  Tony’s mouth twisted.  Apparently mainstream Catholicism was too
(In the dank cold of that miserable cave it had been a comfort to know not all of his legacy would be drenched in blood.)
“Good,” Steve said, stroking his fingers through Tony’s hair. He took each of Tony’s wrists in his massive hands, holding them tight, as he raised them to his lips for a kiss, like he had before. Then, with a firm grip, Steve pulled Tony to his feet and into his arms. For a few moments, Steve just held him, hands stroking across Tony’s back in a steady rhythm.
Clint was staring at him in something akin to shock and actually took a step back when Tony jabbed a finger at him. “Not to mention that Adams played it for laughs! As if being raped to save your friends’ lives is
Pepper looked down at her lap, seeming sad.  “It doesn’t matter.  I’m sorry I leapt to conclusions.  So, uh, you were teasing him and—“
“The legend of Captain America--it’s only grown in the last 70 years,” Colbert says sympathetically. “That’s a lot to live up to.”
Tony found Steve’s hand under the blankets and took it in both of his, but Steve didn’t seem to notice one way or another. Still staring straight ahead.
Flushed and breathing heavily, Steve scribbled  “Work in progress-- be back later” on a note and flipped off the tablet.
Steve knew he reeked of desperation, but instead of withdrawing awkwardly the Professor only looked softer.
“Of course, I do,” Steve said apologetically, “But could we, uh, later? I’ve got basketball with Sam.”
For a hideous, disorienting second, Tony thought he’d blacked out, but he could still hear Steve and Bruce and soon his eyes were readjusting. As he recovered from the unpleasant flash-blindness, he found the glowing force field gone.
“Fine, fine.  I’ll keep the sexy words to myself, but what gives Banner?  Rogers this and Rogers that?”
Tony bade Bruce a distracted good morning, poured himself some more coffee, and settled at the counter, watching Steve fuss over the last of the brunch preparations.
Clint shook him off. “Just tell me if I’m looking for him at SHIELD or if he’s already in the infirmary.”
Tony pressed another kiss to Steve’s thigh, then his knee.  “Come on, babe.  You need to breathe for me.  No holding your breath.”  Tony reached up to lay a hand on Steve’s chest.  “Breathe with me,” Tony said then took a long deep breath.  Steve opened his eyes and matched Tony’s breathing.  They exhaled together.  Then took another deep breath together.  Steve watched the rise and fall of Tony’s chest, the movement of the arc reactor.
“I’m heading to the Morgan in about an hour,” she said. Her face lit up as she added, “I’m working on their latest acquisition: a trunk of fifteenth century Flemish manuscripts. Simply phenomenal.”
“And I’ll start with the gnocchi burro e salvia,” Steve said, “and then the pollo parmigiano and the sautéed vegetables please.”
“Yeah, well,” Tony agreed, jokingly, “dating basically blows, but it’s still the necessary first step for Big Church Wedding, White Picket Fence, and Bouncing All American Babies, so you’ll have to suffer through it eventually.”
So sad and sorry to be away from this story for so long.  RL was sad and stressful, but things are steadily improving and I hope to be back on a semi-regular writing schedule until at least October.
