“Oh, great, thanks,” Clint says and takes the whole load from Tony. There’s a pause before Clint asks, “Is he okay?”
Sam entered the room and the query of his soul pressed on the bond, but Steve gently brushed it aside.
Steve runs a hand through his hair. It’s visibly trembling. “They did have those words back then and if they did I didn’t know them. All I knew was that – so that’s what I used. That’s all.” He cuts off Tony. “I loved Peggy.”
“Good, we are making fantastic strides.” The doctor eyes Steve and then turns back to Tony. “I take it your companion knows?”
“Peculiar nature, what exactly could that mean?” Tony says as he sits back, his eye gleam as he examines each of them. Steve suddenly feels like one of those insects stuck to a board.
Even later when Tony tried to grill him about it, Steve stayed mum and even glared at him with a threat in his eyes. So now instead of working on his propulsion problem, Tony sits and stares at the holographic displays of Captain America. The data is so clean, so perfectly clean. He's dead. Went into the ocean almost 70 years ago.
“That’s mature,” Steve says and gives up trying to serve Tony. After a brief spell of merciful quietude, Steve must decide it’s a good idea to harangue him over lunch. “I’ve watched you, you know, over the last week. You’re intense. I think you’ll do it. Eventually. But- and here’s the thing – if you have stroke before then it’s all for naught.”
“No. No, you’re not,” Steve replies. He runs a hand through his hair and then gently touches Tony’s jaw. “I’ll be back, but I have an errand to do for the Brothel. It’s something I should have done sooner, but I thought I could hold off.”
“You’ll be under house arrest, under my control until we can figure this mess out,” Tony replies. “It’s the best I can do. As your alpha, I have that privilege. Let me do this for you.”
“Well, does this mean we’re like BFF’s?” Sam said and Steve spotted an almost clear adoration in the man’s features.
“Yeah, I get that,” Steve said and then to turn the subject around and keep them inching step by step toward recovery in their relationship, he added, “By the way I think this whole thing that I’m Divini too is a lot of hooey.”
Tony nods and tightens his lips before saying, “That’s fair. I haven’t been my normal self. I’m actually quite an entertaining fellow. You know, with all the sarcasm and witty dialog. Since we bonded, I’ve taken a route to try and train you. I’ve followed old lessons from a life time ago. I’ve come to the conclusion letting you have freer rein might be a good thing, especially after what I’ve seen at the conference.” Steven glances down at his held cock, clamped tight in the penis shaft. “As your alpha I still demand the right to your pleasure. It’s mine and mine alone to offer you. Do you understand?” Tony acknowledges the cock and ball cage and then reaches over with his ring and the locking mechanism opens, it falls off. Steve staggers a bit and lets out a low moan. “Understand?”
“It also means that we can’t split them apart. That’s impossible with quantum entanglement. Particles influence one another and predict one another regardless of how far apart they are- but-.” Tony stops. He’s missing something, something vital – something that changes everything. The clock above the fireplace– the one that Pepper made him put there years ago – rings the hour. “Shit!” Tony looks at Bruce. “Time. Time!”
“No idea,” Steve said as he glanced around the cabin. “Do you think he has some way to monitor the situation?”
“Wasn’t the mantra of your Hydra, cut off one head, two will take its place?” T’Challa asked and leaned forward. “Your escape with Mister Stark and Natasha’s coven surely did cut off the heads of part of the government of your country, but just because you have done that does not mean you have rooted out the cause of all evil. The root of it still exists in your lands. It rots the land and poisons it.”
“Tony, please, what can I do?” Steve said, and the ache pulsed through the bond, an ache so deep and so powerful it took his breath away. “Please, Tony, you have to talk to me. I can’t help you. All I see are these pictures, these moving pictures that remind me of the silent movies back in the day. Explain to me what’s in your head. I can’t help yo-.”
Steve stands and offers a hand to Thor. The big man is even taller in his hat and boots. Sometimes Steve feels positively dwarfed by the man. Thor’s duster doesn’t even kiss the wooden floor.
“You were in a pack before?” Tony narrowed his eyes as if he could read the truth of it on the fine lines of her face.
He sidles to the door with a hand on the wall to brace against in case the room loops and swoops. Before he exits the room he closes his eyes and clears his head one more time. Leaving, he finds Bucky waiting in the dark hallway.
“I’d want to see the data.” He can’t believe he would consider something as risky and hairbrained as this idea. “All of the data.”
Steve slips his fingers out and then waits as Tony calms himself, his erection is bloody hot and throbbing with need. Taking the tube, Steve lubes his cock and then positions it right at Tony’s entrance. He circles the head around and both of them moan in unison. “I’m gonna fuck you now. Bare. I’m gonna bare back it.”
“And I can honestly say when you came along, my vision of the vamps changed,” Clint said. “I finally got it. I wanted to be a better person, to make things better, to show the world that tolerance and peaceful coexistence was possible.”
“This can’t keep happening. It’s going to damage their hearts,” Cho says. Her features tell she’s deeply troubled by the report outs from the monitors scattered about the room. “It looks like their running on pure adrenaline.”
“Yeah. You have to know Steve, you can’t live like this. The doctors said the seizures will eventually lead to brain damage.” He puts up a hand to stop Steve’s protests. “The serum can’t keep up with seizures that last hours. We think that’s part of the reason why you lapse into unconsciousness now is that the serum has to work overtime to repair the damage done.”
I am participating in the Cap-IronMan Big Bang this year and am focusing all of my attention on my story for the event. 80% is due by 26 September and I am nearly at 20% (which is good considering I just started 2 weeks ago). I want to get the BB to that 80% or complete by 26 September, so I will post the next chapter of Beloved on Sunday 2 September. It's written, it only needs revisions. I hope you liked this chapter. I would really like to know what you think might happen in the next few chapters! I hope that my ending will satisfy!
“Yeah, he did. He’d gone and saved my ass is what he did. Idiot, told them he wanted to give them some information on you, and the town. Would be-.” He hisses against the pain. “Would be valuable.”
Steve leaned down as Tony opened his jeans. When he released his cock, Tony sighed as the tension race through him. Steve met Tony’s eyes and then tentatively swept downward, kissing along the way, setting Tony on fire. Steve teased Tony with a simple lick as if attempting to figure out what to do next. He licked again and again until Tony had his hands planted on the bed and his hips rising to meet Steve.
“So it really isn’t a jump to a different universe but a transformation of our universe?” Tony asked. It rankled him because he couldn’t recalled a time when soul packs did not exist. That meant that everyone, including Tony, been changed by an outside force.
“This is a viral therapy that is gaining some traction in the use of delivery of drugs to the brain. It is especially appealing because of its lower side effects. While there’s a lot of research going on about controlling the immune response, Doctor Wong and I believe we can penetrate into the brain tissue and target the optical nerve.” He flicks through a few slides and Tony furrows his brow as he looks at the graphics.
“A little, part of the nanites job that I programmed is to numb the ejection. This pad here on my palms is artificial. Inside where the nanites hibernation is artificial as are all the routes to the palm port.” Tony smiled at him, but concern creased his brow. “Do you find it repulsive?”
“Tony!” He walks into the lab. His shoulders are at ease and he has a jaunt to his step. They’d only started this thing between them. It still percolated brand new, warming and steeping. Steve nods to Bruce as he approached. “Nice to see you, Doctor Banner.”
When Steve moves to his ass, lightly stroking at his cleft, Tony stops him. “No, baby, you need to prep me. You ever done this before?”
Obie gestures to Steve with the hand he clasps around a tumbler of amber liquid. “Tell me who the new crew member is?”
“You don’t get to do this. Not this. You’re cutting yourself away. Again. You can’t do this every time. I can’t be part of this without you.” Tony held on as if a tsunami battered them.
"I'm not a doctor." The man steps over to him, extends his hand in a friendly, almost foreign gesture. "Agent Phil Coulson. I'm with the SHIELD. Nice to meet you Captain."
Reaching up, he shoves the curtain aside and turns off the water that’s turning cold now anyhow. He manages to get the curtain aside so that he can touch Steve. He leans against the fake tile, his face hidden with his arm, his face tucked into his elbow. He still has his clothes on. Or at least his shirt. His pants and underwear are gone. Tony finds them in a pile under the sink.
Watching out of the port window, An’Tony frowns into the light. It hurts his eyes for no real reason other than he doesn’t want to be here.  This is a ritual he’d like to forego, but he has no other choice. To get to sit in the High Alpha Chair above all others’, he needs to have a warrior at his side. Not just any warrior, an Omega warrior. And one with formidable power and reputation. He cannot have a naïve Omega, or a drone – that would not do for him to stake his claim.
Steve still didn’t look at him as he bowed his head. “Nothing. Everything. I don’t want to be something wrong. I was wrong for so long.”
Steve makes a mental note of that and then thanks Sam. “It’s important to me, thank you for telling me. And thank you for making this easy. You are my first client.”
“A little,” Steve replied. “I never backed down from anything in my life. Yet, now.” He stopped as if he’d run out of fuel.
He nods. “Carol found me. She brought me back to Earth. I didn’t want to go, but I was too old and weak. I hated going back-.” His voice breaks as he recalls the beauty of the Earth at the same time knowing his loss too great to sustain that wonder.
He raises his hand as if to take the letter, his letter to Tony. Tony moves it away from his grasp. “You don’t get it back. This is mine. Along with the other letter.”
“I’ll get it. Don’t worry,” Steve says. To change the subject and to ensure that Tony’s working on a different problem, he adds, “Do you have any idea where the Passage is going to be to get to the next rim?”
Natasha volunteered for the couch. Somehow or another even with Tony gazing intently at him, Steve ended up with Thor – which was utterly ridiculous. They couldn’t even fit on the bed together. He barely slept that night, but it hadn’t been because of the lack of space, but the sleeping arrangements. He never admitted it to anyone, but every once in a while, Natasha would glance at him with that knowing look in her eyes. Sometimes he wanted to know what she knew because he hadn’t a clue.
“Why do you sound like my mother when she forced me to go to Disneyland?” Tony stomps behind Steve into the two plus feet of snow. The drifts make it hard to measure.
“You don’t have to jump too far,” Tony said, and he thought his hands carried the stars as the projection seemed to merge with them.
Steve stares at Tony, but he’s blinking too fast as if shuttling through different memories. Maybe the Battle of New York affected Steve in ways that none of them could possibly understand. A quiver runs up Steve’s arm and Tony snaps to attention. Talking to Logan, maybe even Richards becomes a necessity as he watches Steve battling some internal foe.
“Well, it’s not all that accepted everywhere now. There are countries that outlaw it, that kill gay people. Shit, there are parts of this country that bend over backwards to make it so gay people don’t want to live there.”
“You’re going to be sorry that you’re doing this. It won’t be tolerated at the highest level,” Rumlow warned.
“Get dressed. We have to talk,” Fury ordered and then sneered at the doctors. “No more experiments.”
“You weren’t trained?” Tony asks and he’s more than aghast. It should have been in the file. Pep probably already knows this little fact, thus the reason she’s been so irritated with his choice. “At all?”
Steve doesn’t allow Tony’s negative response to color his attitude; he needs this assignment to work out. “Well, what can I help you with?”
“Maybe we should call Richards back up?” Bruce offers and places a hand on Tony’s shoulder. That’s a hard thing for Bruce to do, he always stays hands off.
Like in slow motion, he watched Tony's face close up, become the genial mask again, the grin stretching his face. And he turned on his heel, saying something on the lines with "Oh, over there I see some people I actually looked forward to seeing."
Something was brewing here. “Malibu?” Steve said lightly. “Been there once.” His lying liar of a voice seemed perfectly steady. As if Tony couldn’t feel his sudden tautness with his whole body.
It's only belatedly that he realizes Steve is sort of covertly signaling with his eyes. Tony follows his gaze and spots a few people from the plane in the crowd. Without a doubt, none of them have forgotten Tony's gleeful and memorable performances of the day. Oh, goody.
Forgetting himself for a moment, he tried to jump to his feet; gave up. "You know what, I don't see why you're even asking. You evidently have all the answers already, so why don't you tell me?" He was speaking coldly, looking to wound "What is it I'm going to do with it? Subdue you? Take you in? No, guard your back, Rogers,
"Well, thank you for your service!" Politely, yes, but aggressively, almost insolently. Practically demanding in their thankfulness.
But this one – this message was a one to be listened to endlessly, on repeat. This one was a one to which you rubbed your eyes and let your forehead sink against the table-top. This was a one to make you yell: "Okay, Occam, so
Tony closed his eyes, and sucked in a sharp breath, but just when Steve was going to draw his hand away, to apologize, he felt the flexing of the cheek muscle under his fingertip, felt a corner of Tony's mouth go up. He leaned into the touch slightly, and Steve couldn't help but move his finger downwards, stroke along Tony's lower lip.
"I can multitask, for fuck's sake" Tony snapped, then took an audible breath. "Sorry, Cap. Listen, I'll work better if I have an idea what's going on over there." Steve couldn't quite figure out how the man could produce so many words a minute, but he did sound a little distraught.
Tony drags  himself along, and into the shower, and he downs a painkiller, and after that he starts feeling like he's worthy of rejoining the human race.
That bewildered tone of voice again. It sounded exactly the way Tony felt. This was awkward to the max.
"Yeah, he'll do that," Sam answered, grinning blithely, seemingly not surprised at all. He was obviously referring to either Steve's speed or his remark; not to the way the muscles of his back moved under the fabric or the way the hem of his short sleeves practically cut into his biceps.
It's not easy, though. Maybe some other things need to be said first, between them. So he places a small kiss somewhere behind Tony's ear, because Tony is standing so close and
"We're not going back down," Steve said, wiping away the sweat. His hair was plastered to his forehead and  there was a faint smear of blood under his nose.
, or if there is corruption involved, or a nascent international incident or something... Well, there is secret police, there are intelligence forces, secret agents, there is working undercover... Every country does that, even across the borders, fuck the borders, yes, every country has spies too, every country breaks the laws there. If they tell you they don't, it's a big fat lie. I used to
He started carving the meat instead. It was a small roast, but in addition to everything else, it made the amount of food really ridiculous. And then there were the sweets, too. He looked at Steve as he was passing him the plate; Steve was looking at all the food as well.
Tony had been dreaming about Steve ever since he had (stupidly, unnecessarily) breathed in the remnants of a substance he was now calling 'timefog' (he wasn't so great with naming things, whatever; nothing could be as bad as 'BARF'). He had not only been dreaming about Steve, he had been dreaming about
It can’t be good when after three months of incarceration, his wits decide it’s time to fly out the non-existent window. He’s tried to pretend what he’s seeing and hearing is not happening. Every now and again, he checks the arc reactor and thinks maybe, just maybe, there’s something about it being implanted in his chest. Maybe its magnetic core is screwing around with his brain waves. That seems like hocus pocus, but that would make infinitely more sense than what’s happening in front of him.
“Yes,” Tony says and folds a hand over Steven’s. “What do you think about Estane and the idea of Stalls?”
Tony thinks of himself as a futurist, but he knows his history. While he agrees with the abolitionists that omegas should have more rights and be freer to express themselves, he understands the order of nature. There’s a force to nature and their biology that for centuries was disregarded as hocus-pocus, but the truth of alphas’ dominance, betas’ neutrality, and omegas’ supplication cannot be ignored.
The salesclerk only shakes his head, obviously not placing Steve. Part of Steve relaxes, having Tony parade him into the shop and declare that Steve is a personal assistant is dangerous enough, having him poke the clerk to remember him is just fool’s play.
They brought Nat in on his secret. She took the assignment seriously and even offered to be the alpha he was looking for, but Fury nicked that idea. They would be working together at SHIELD and he didn’t want any entanglements.
“Yes, no, no,” Steve said and then put his face in his hands. He felt like a kid again. Often, he’d come home to his mother and their cold flat. She’d see his bloody nose and cradle his face in her hands. He dropped his hands. “When I was a kid, I always thought I was a disappointment to my mom. She always treated me like I was a prince, but it was hard for her dealing with a kid with so many ailments.”
“Yes. We were a team. He was the greatest soldier. I’ve been remiss, son, I haven’t told you enough about Steve Rogers. That was his name, Cap’s name. I’ll get you a book to read. You’ll like it, better than that childish lion you’re hiding in your lap.” Howard hardened his gaze. “It would do you well to learn a little about a real man.”
“No. No.” He rubs at his forehead. The strange gray shadows flitter around his visual field. Like phantoms of his life, they taunt him. He’d thought Steve was something special. Obviously, he is wrong. Very wrong. “Tell him that we’ll get his stuff as soon as possible. Leave it at that. I don’t want to hear from him again. Block his number.”
“Sacrificed his gland? Everyone knows that you cut out the whole gland, you kill the omega.” Tony says. He knows some of his family history, but not this far back. “So that story sounds like a myth. Like that Medieval myth of Antonio and Stefan, Stiofan, whatever. Remember that one? My mother used to tell me those stories.”
“Not that I heard. Why?” She must sit down because the scene shifts to her floating with her legs in a lotus position.
“You homeschool the kids?” Sam asked. “Because if my father was a superhero and fought those alien things in New York, I’d be shouting it from the top of your barn out there. That is a barn, right?”
After he tidies up, Tony goes to the door to the presentation suite, opens it, and finds Steven waiting patiently on a small stool near the door. He immediately stands when Tony appears, which only serves to piss off Tony. He’s supposed to be kneeling. He’s dressed in a blue shirt with short sleeves, simple trousers. He wears the leathers over the shirt. He’s kept the snap from the breastplate to the collar open, obviously anticipating Tony’s demand.
“I have a few people to discuss your candidacy with. I will get back to you by Thursday of this week. If you don’t hear from me or Ms. Potts, then it means we’ve moved on and we wish you well. If you do hear from us, then it means you come in on Thursday, since the contract and the non-disclosure papers and move in that night. Agreed?”
He raised his coffee mug to them as he scooped up the plate with the waffles in hand and headed toward his workshop. With a little time and energy spent not thinking of his weird dreams, Tony focused on his work, though his mind drifted to the soul and the core and his astral projection more than once. He found himself muttering the cursed Mantra. He hated it but acknowledged it for what it was worth. It worked. It kept his brain on the task at hand. He didn’t get so much feedback from the new threads of the pack reaching out to Barnes and mystery witch girl and speedy brother. Maybe that explained the strange dreams.
“Do you think someone in the factions is plotting against him?” Steve asks as they enter the lift to the lounge.
“You have every right to protect yourself, Steve,” Peggy said. She never touched him, never forced him to stop ripping away at his nail bed. “You endured horrible things. No one should. No one. Not human. Not vampire. Not Divini.”
Her eyes softened in that beautiful, elegant way they always did for him. “Tony told me. He loves you very much, you know.”
“Yeah,” Sam said. He waited. He had the ability to read people and know when it was time to speak and when it was time to listen and to wait.
Waking up sweaty and horny as hell gave Tony flashbacks to his youth. Most of the time as a rambunctious teenager he woke up with visions of his latest crush in his head and a hard-on – he’d do the nasty with his favorite hand and get it over with, going back to sleep in as little as three minutes. It was quick and dirty back in the day. The new hot dreams faded and restlessness greeted him as it always did. He tried to pin it to the whole hell of New York and the void, but he knew it wasn’t that. Being on the brink of needing an orgasm and then suddenly being filled with a sense of loneliness and dread never happened to him as a kid but now seemed to be the current state of affairs. Plus the off kilter feeling emanated not from his brain but somewhere else – and that made no sense whatsoever. His whole being felt frayed and loose.
Rhodey coughs and says, “I’m getting coffee. You want coffee.” He pushes the chair out and it rolls, dislodging Tony. He catches himself and sits back in his chair.
Once in his room, Steve spends time packing the clothes because Natasha indicated that he will be staying with the prince. If the prince decides that Steve needs to leave each night, he’ll just have to drag his bag back to the brothel. Thankfully, Wanda offers him a suitcase that’s not a torn duffle. He’s careful to stow the brooch in an internal side pocket of the suitcase.  Finished packing, Steve spends some time in the bathroom cleaning and shaving. He takes the prophylactic meds to ensure he’s clean and the resident AI registers his compliance.
“No,” Steve says and looks down at their fingers laced together. “But I knew. I didn’t face it. I knew it in my bones but I never faced the truth about what Bucky had done to Tony’s parents.”
Tony had gotten right into Rhodey’s face. “Look at me, Rhodey. Look at me! Do you see a man who’s ready to give up? I’m not. This is me. I’m fixing it.”
“Not really seizures. Just like visions or images. Maybe they are seizures – maybe their petit mal seizures I don’t know and you’re having the big granddaddy seizures. We have to do something, Steve.” Maybe using someone’s name lends gravity and weight to the words.
“Hey, yeah, I remember you. Tell me Tony’s hasn’t done something half-assed and gotten himself in trouble or worse is in the hospital?” Rhodes asks.
Tony pulls away for only a second and nods in silent consent. They kiss again, longingly as if the kiss can’t possible give them everything they desire. Tony lingers with the kiss, tasting and touching. How did they go from team mates just hours ago, to this? And then Tony remembers the moment he used the gauntlet and Steve broke down before him. Destiny entwined them. They were meant to do this; they were meant to break so that they could come together again and be stronger for it.
“Okay, don’t worry about it. You’re not the first person to blow off steam at me,” Tony said. “And no, that’s not me being a martyr. Everyone gets the short end of the stick sometimes. It’s nice to think I get it from Captain America.”
“You get that we’re all going to be exposed in there, that we’ll be able to see each other’s deepest selfs.”
“You need to rest. So, I’ll let you go. The meds should be there within the hour. Three times a day for five days.” Before he protests, she holds up her hand to stop him. “Three times a day for five days, Steve.”
“I’m not sure the founding fathers were talking about me when they said all men were created equal.”
Steve only shakes his head. “Doesn’t matter, I don’t think it matters anymore. I would lay down my life for you-.”
Tony heaves Steve to him and sucks against his neck, biting and suckling. It makes Steve moan in response and he wants more so he leans into it like a beggar at the feast. It’s ridiculous really to think about, Steve has a clientele. This is his job but the feel of the prince against him, the rough touch of his beard causes Steve to want to break every vow he’s ever made. Tony’s hand cups his face and pulls him away for a moment, his focus briefly going to Steve’s mouth and then back to his eyes. Steve doesn’t deny him. Tony plunges forward, knocking them down onto the floor as he tastes and explores Steve’s mouth.
Steve gets up on all fours, spreads his legs and opens his mouth. Anxiety rolls over him; he wants to get this started and then he realizes as the haze of yearning to give of himself comes over him that he’s fully in heat.
“Stop, stop, stop,” Tony said and scrubbed at his hair with his nails. Nothing. All morning and he still got nothing from the web. But that was probably because soul packs were so rare, and that most soul packs were not scientifically, rigorously studied. He needed to talk to Bruce about investigating this whole fucked up thing.
“Oh you mean he likes the company of lots of women?” Bucky says with a crooked smile that only means he’s enjoying tormenting Steve.
Tony studied him for a long moment, his brows curled up, his focus intense. He sidled over to Steve since they had physically separated since they woke up. “It’s new.”
Tentatively, Tony places his fingers on Steve’s face. He closes one hand to let the heat radiating off Steve’s cheek warm him. The height of his cheek muscles, the crinkle of his eyes, he gently explores – Steve’s beaming, happy. Tony did that. Tony. He smiles back.
Automatically, he reaches out and grasps Steven’s hand, his omega stiffens in response but he doesn’t pull away. Tony knows protocol halts him from such an action, if he did he could be punished in front of everyone. Tony glances at Pep as she waits. “Can you leave us for a moment? Tell everyone to wait.”
“Well, maybe it’s time you and I figure that out?” Tony said and he felt the ground beneath him tremble. It wasn’t just the jet racing down the runway. He wondered if he’d crossed a line, but then Steve smiled and it eased the quaking through the bond.
“Wish I could do that,” he says and strokes the lion’s mane. “You are magnificent. So beautiful, gentle. I don’t know what you’ve been through but you’re one in a million.”
“Now that you know, he’ll want to torture you.” Tony’s eyes flash in the firelight. “I won’t have it.”
Steve snickers at him, but it sounds like he’s half hiccupping. It definitely teeters on being forced. Tony recognizes Steve’s effort to put yesterday behind them.
Steve snickered in return. “Not necessary.” He raced off down the pathway over the hill toward the creek. He heard Sam take off into the air. The last few days had been different for Steve. Not only with Tony but with the team. Things felt different. Together on the farm, the team not only worked on their battle prowess but also bonded in other ways. Laura had taken part in it too. At night she suggested they spend time at the fire pit and they all roasted marshmallows and cooked hotdogs as Thor told stories of the Nine Realms.
Apparently, the maniac had been Steve’s best bud, the one that fell off the train according to the history books. Or maybe that was all made up shit. Tony doesn’t know. But the Bucky he met was a wild bear because he rushed at Tony again and again. Steve's words meant nothing to him. Tony had grabbed for anything to ward him off. He managed to catch the old lamp with the torn shade to swing it at the bear. All to no avail.
Bruce is right – the media went crazy last year with the revelation that Captain America and Wolverine were an item. He remembered hugging a bottle of malt liquor and watching the television reports. Logan and Steve were both hot and they were together. The media ate it up. What was wrong with Tony that Steve kept his distance even though he professed to wanting to be in a relationship?  Was it lingering feelings for Wolverine, or was it Tony and his habit of leaping off the wagon into a cesspool of alcohol. It must be the information about the drinking. “Maybe he wants to break up with me because of the drinking?”
“Okay with me,” Clint said and smiled. He leaned back against the table and crossed his arms. “You guys must have some bone cracking sex.”
“Come on buddy boy, I’m not in my armor and you’re not just a human anymore. Those wings are heavy,” Tony says and Steve flails trying to get his weight under him.
when a thug tried to go for Steve's legs. And Steve listened and adapted like he'd been doing it his whole life.
Tony heard a note of stubbornness in Steve’s voice: “Yes, but this way I get to win. I get to go out and ski and do what I want. I’m not letting the cold defeat me.”
In the beginning, when Sam asked, Steve insisted he would fix this. He and Tony were friends, they cared about each other, right? They could overcome this.
She paged through them. I always admired her quiet poise. Her expression didn't really change as she looked at them, but I still did my best to give her some privacy. She looked away for a moment, and when she turned back, she was composed again.
"Yeah," he said, patting my arm earnestly and a bit awkwardly. "Yeah, it does. It makes a lot of sense."
Rogers was staring back, unrelenting. The intensity of the blue gaze almost made Tony shiver – with anticipation or trepidation or what, he couldn't say.
"I just want to immunize you against that shit, in case someone tries something similar. Okay? All right?"
"Look at me, you big ass," he said, tugging at my upper arm, so of course I did. I loved how handsy he was – I imagined he was that way with his Steve, because they were closer, they were these good friends (friends who could touch and kiss and have sex, apparently, and that kind of friendship was something I couldn't understand in my heart, but no one asked me to understand).
, he thought. Gales and Dales finally did  it. They were probably working on the next prank, and they tampered with something they weren't supposed to tamper with. They were pros, most of them. They should have known better. But no, of course they wouldn't – they all thought they knew what they were doing and that it was
Hope breathed out. "Okay then. You in contact with Tony right now, sir? Tell him to try and bring the wall sprinkler systems back online as soon as it makes sense to do so. It's not of the highest priority, but it would help a lot."
Beyond the area they had cleared, the next instance of the way seemed free of any major blockage, and not far ahead, a maintenance corridor on the right would take him to the side engine. The lights flickered again, somewhat alarmingly.
Tony met his gaze almost as if issuing a challenge. "What do you say I cook you a real, full-scale dinner?"
Steve likes to be alone in a crowd, Tony knows. He likes to go and look at people, watch life take place around him.
, for the maximum disgust effect. Clint caught them during the preparations and interrogated them thoroughly; then he decided to join in. No one, he said, was as repugnant as he was, and he didn't appreciate being left out. Techs had tried to repeat the stunt that had worked so beautifully the previous day. As predicted, they found the smelly naked pilots obnoxious enough, so they mostly stepped out of the way.
"We never were friends," Tony says instead, thoughtfully. "Not really, you know." It comes out wrong. Well, of course it does.
Months of horrors of forced small talk and unnatural politeness they had never stooped to before. And it was pretty much always he who took the initiative.
A quiet chorus of regrets and doubts was whispering in his ear as he walked; why had he made friends with his pilots, why did he have to accept this post, where Natasha was already serving, why could he not have kept his distance, the way he should have? In the end you just watched everyone die, and you went on and on and on.
, he ordered himself and turned to look Peter in the face. The man was wearing this open, bright-eyed expression that made it impossible for
"Steve. Do you actually really think it matters?" she said, a little too sharply, perhaps. "The fraternization rules? This is not just about the rumors or the morale, we both know it. It's about your own sense of ethics. You don't want to feel you are being unfair. But, do you really think it matters that you are not doing anything, if you look at him like that, if he looks at you like that? Do you really think you are not biased? That it's not influencing your judgment?"
There was Tony with that look again, naked just for a second, taken aback. If you didn't know his face so well, you'd have missed it. Steve thought almost anyone but himself would have missed it. He almost melted, there and then, almost took Tony's hand in his own, almost said
He tried plugging himself into a slightly altered BARF tech gadget thing he had come up with. The readings were... inconclusive.
It could be a malfunction, of course – what brand were these suits, anyway? As soon as the readings had flickered to life, Tony could see the quality was crap. But no, of course there would be fire somewhere ahead. There are no good catastrophes without a fire.
A picture of Tony and Morgan was on the shelf near the sink, so Steve came over to take a look, to busy himself with something. He'd seen Tony's daughter only two or three times before, when she was a baby. She was a lovely kid, and the soft look on Tony's face in the photo was something new and precious. And then Steve spotted another photo there, of Tony and little Peter, and he found himself once again struck with the realization how much sadness they all carried, and how much loss, and all he wanted was to stick by Tony right then, to work together in silence and perhaps to think about all the other people who also could have been there, with them, if things had been different, if they hadn't lost.
don't. And they may not agree with mine. God knows, you all saw choice cuts of our disagreements on TV. But these guys are not... they do not deserve to be vilified like this. Crucified like this. We all did wrong. And I think it's, I believe with all my heart it's your right to ask questions, and all of us, we should always question authority, and we should, we should take responsibility, yes. But we should also keep all the facts in mind. These guys are not villains, and you know it, or you should. Some of them are your own veterans. Steve Rogers, Sam Wilson. Decorated war heroes. Sam was pararescue, for God's sake, saving people was his day job even before he joined the Avengers! You know who they are, you
Apparently, in order to make him spill information, his chief captor, a sorcerer, had made Steve inhale smoke of certain mind-altering herbs. The effect, however, was quite different then expected. Instead of making him prattle, it had triggered a waking dream that felt disturbingly real. It was almost as if he had been transported to another place, another time, where all of them existed, just like here; and yet everything was somehow different.
Tony: Dammit, Rogers, do you have any idea who you're talking to? This is not crude, this is downright mannerly. You've yet to see MY crude.
Steve was barely aware of the waitress, even though he replied to her thanks very politely. Thank you, autopilot, you're ever helpful. In the end she even brought them burgers, her treat. They were probably good, they usually were, here. Steve didn't remember the taste at all.
"Your teeth are chattering," Steve observed from the blanket nest Tony was becoming acutely jealous of. The man still didn't sound drowsy in the least. Was he lying there, stewing as well? The thought wasn't as satisfactory as Tony expected it to be. Steve hadn't really
The last stop before the point of no return, Tony mused. It would almost be easier to fall into the old patterns, to embrace the enormous pain of a never satisfied longing, and get on with his life. That sort of pain was at least familiar, whereas this new, raw thing was overwhelming, it was too much, and Tony didn’t know if he could stand it.
He frowned, mildly incredulous. At least it snapped him out of the funk he'd been in. "Why would I be
Steve’s heart stopped for a moment; he hesitated, then let the doubt take over, the reasonable being that it was; the doubt, that’d been telling him not to rush this, telling him to wait. It had been right. Of course it had. Nothing so good could ever happen for real.
"Look," Tony interrupted. "Can we skip the apologies and such? We've both said our pieces. Let's say we're done with that. I don't have the stomach. I'll meet up with you, and we'll talk. Since you sounded so fucking sad. Look, I want to see you too. I do. But, honestly, I'm not sure anything good will come out of this."
Steve's bewildered look, and his belated, watery grin probably spoiled the effect, but this last piece of acting was all the consideration Tony was going to give to social niceties.  Everyone could go straight to hell, not stopping to ask for directions. (He could give those directions so well, though. He could probably draw them a detailed map.)
At Tony's grunt of protest at the delay, Steve started fumbling with the button. Impatiently, Tony pushed Steve's fingers away, unzipped himself, then started on Steve's belt, which was when the white haze behind Steve's eyes swallowed all thought.
Tony lets go of his nipple, after just a fraction of a second too long. "I told you I wasn't going to be gentle. At all," he says. It sounds strangely clinical.
She inclined her head so that her red hair fell over her face. "He seems like a bit of an asshole, but maybe he's not that bad. Honestly, I can't get a read on him." Her smirk was sharp. "Too much bullshit floating around the surface, clouding the view."
"Is this a kidnapping?" Steve asks placidly, and Tony has to resist the urge to stick his tongue out at him. He just snorts instead.
He ignored my question. "You know," he said conversationally, "I kept telling myself it was the only way – your death, I mean. It's a piss poor comfort, but you know... The only way we could save the world. One
I was still devastated, of course. The man I loved had died, and he was still dead, and that was going to stay that way, that was final. This wasn't him, exactly. But, still, in a way, it was, and I got to talk to him, and I got to laugh with him again, and suddenly, the world was back, bright in technicolor, and I could fill my lungs with air to bursting once more.
It sounded breezy, with an undercurrent of steel; it felt like an open wound. And now he can't even be bothered to say
People were bustling around, but at the moment, they were just white noise to him, the lot of them. An obstacle to finding Steve. It wasn't fair, but hyperfocus could be like that.
that Steve cared, in a way. He remembered Steve tearing up when they talked more than a year ago now, he remembered that night on the roof in Berlin, and he remembered the conversation too, more clearly than he cared to admit. The thing was, Steve didn't care like
Tony: People can be heady. It's like crowd-surfing, only you don't have to really move, and no one has to touch you. Thankfully. But I like people! On general principle.
He could see Tony's erection twitch in his pants, and the improbable sensuality of the sight made Steve stop for a second. Tony didn't even seem angry any longer, just urgent and needy and burning. Steve loved him so much in that moment that he thought it was absolutely impossible to ever love more than that, and then, instantly he loved him even more. And for a second he couldn't help but wonder: How's this even possible? And, if there was so much passion between them, if Tony wanted him this much, couldn't they do it again? Occasionally? At least when they are angry at each other, he thought wryly. And even though he'd half-promised himself not to hope for anything more, he hoped.
Tony wants to strangle Steve. He also wants to push him against the wall and kiss him silly, because he's missed this – the missions, the stupid bickering, everything. Having him so close.
must have approved the dolls, and I know for a fact you don't have a PR team to handle such things for you."
Darryl regarded him with apparent apathy. "Sir, if you feel like giving him back, I'm perfectly happy to have him."
is a strategy that cannot fail. He relaxes and nods. "I think we can allow ourselves something majorly unhealthy and high in cholesterol for this occasion, don't you?"
"I do apologize, but I'm going to have to check your names now, and I will need the list of pairs or, er, any other arrangements, please."
He thought it must be some kind of a natural anesthetic for the mind. He should look into it, it'd be interesting, on a purely scientific level. When the hurt was too much, when
We never talked about it again. I didn't want the solicitation of our shared fate. I did not want to be comforted, and I don't think she did either.
Steve gave him a bland, amused look. "Oh, all right," he said, tucking the thing around himself and arranging it like a toga, with one shoulder naked. Oh, this was going to prove a mistake, wasn't it?
For Tony, worry and irritability were almost interchangeable. Maybe he was that way because it was easier to admit to being irritated than worried. "You're kidding," he was saying practically steamrolling over Steve, forgetting about unimportant things like rank or following orders or whatever. This was a crisis, and he was used to dealing with those, whatever their nature. He was used to making decisions. "What are you going to do down there, exactly? You can't fix this. You go see if the folks are all right and all that. Help out the survivors."
"It's mostly just us that are left," Natasha said slowly. "You. Me. Sam. Clint. Who's going to mind? And I know what you are saying, but, looking at it from a different perspective,
He takes Natasha by her good hand, and takes Tony by the other. "Guys," he says, and his voice is hoarse, and his body is shaking with exhaustion, but his heart is full. "It's time to go home."
It must have been the shock of seeing him that made my mind reel this way. Thinking was hard. All my emotions seemed to be stuck in my throat, and I had difficulties putting one thought next to another.
He was momentarily saved from having to reply by the announcer's assistant poking her head in through the door (the announcer guy was too important to do it himself, apparently).
, he stared into Tony's eyes for too long – way longer than what could be considered socially acceptable, or, well, nonsexual. And Tony was standing there, motionless like a statue, and Steve was all to close, and it took just a speck of imagination to picture Steve leaning forward and pressing his lips against Tony's and pressing his
"Probably." He twisted his mouth. Steve leaned over to kiss him and Tony couldn't contain a smile any longer, no matter how hard he tried. "You know," he said, "right now, 'heroes coming together' gets a whole new meaning. Do we tell him that, do you think?"
Tony tried to grin. In the darkness of the room, it looked almost ghastly. His eyes were big and round and shiny, as if he were about to cry.
, in that particular timeline, and not one of the numerous others. From my present perspective, I can only guess the Ancient One knew there was a Tony here who'd lost his Steve, and couldn't handle it; and I was a Steve who'd lost his Tony, and wasn't doing any better; so she figured she'd do a bit of matchmaking. All in all, I suppose you could say the universe conspired to save us both.
Steve gave him a steady look that, absurdly, reassured Tony somewhat. "Then we sell our lives dearly," he said. And everything considered, the quaint melodramatic ring to the words seemed rather fitting.
But we also reconnected with our friends, many of whom had drifted apart, wrapped in their own, individual cocoons of grief.
"What are we working on, today?" he asked, trying to sound businesslike this time around. His own voice sounded weird and stiff in his ears. His face felt like wood.
His new Captain was eying him across the room with a scowl on his face. He wasn't a regular visitor down here. Apart from Thor, who, if the rumors were true, came down here following his heart, and apart from Valkyrie, who always followed the booze, pilots rarely ventured this way. Higher ranking officer definitely didn't.
Tony gave him a long look. While Steve was nearly sure he would say yes – he wouldn't be here, after all, if he didn't wish to see Steve at all – Steve felt a cold stab of dread at the possibility of refusal. Because, back when he thought he'd lost Tony for good, he learned how to deal with the sadness, but now that he was on the verge of having him back, he couldn't stand the thought of losing him again.
"You're dead," he informed me, which explained a few things. Then he stopped, stared hard into my eyes. "Shit," he said. "
He wasn’t sure how to deal with this either – how were they supposed to behave now, what were they to each other, what were the rules? (
was the one who was supposed to be hearing this, only it was too late. But, thinking back, I hadn't been good to this new Tony either. In my attempts not to use him as a handy replacement for my dead friend, I'd been keeping my distance, not saying anything much. He was doing quite the opposite. I remembered how he said he'd cuddle with me, that he could go cry in a corner. How open he'd been about his feelings about the kid he didn't really have. He'd included me as if that was the most natural thing in the world. He'd been wearing his heart on his sleeve in some kind of flag-waving emotional defiance. He stubbornly refused to view me as a stranger.
to make contact?" he was saying, and at that very moment, Tony was going through the motions of "Steve, meet Nick Fury, I told you about him," and "Fury, this is sheriff Steve Rogers," and, simultaneously, Steve was saying "Where exactly are they taking them, Tony? Where are they
As the ship's new mechanic (apparently, Fury desperately needed a mechanic), Tony had a cabin. It smelled of people and of bodily fluids and alcohol; not unlike any saloon in Timely, that is. Steve didn't mind. To him it sang of freedom – a freedom he didn't even know he wanted until it reared its head and beckoned. A freedom that was tightly entwined with how he could stand here and openly hold Tony's hand and didn't have to fight anyone for the right to do it. The ship cleared its landing spot; Steve could feel his stomach flip as they unglued from the ground.
In this timeline, the Ancient One is dead. It's Strange that finds me. "Gulliver. How was the fairy mound?" By those words I know he knows where I'd been, more or less. Still, Gulliver? I could have been Odysseus, at least.
. There would be group lectures. Personal instruction. Tests. It was going to be intensive, and it was going to be hurried, but Captain Rogers indented to put them through the basic flight training just as if they were at the Academy. He'd pass them if they deserved it, he'd flunk them if they made one mistake too many; there were going to be no leniencies just because they were possibly the last remnant of the human race, and the supply of new cadets was therefore somewhat limited.
. Tony's words to Fury rang in Steve's head. And of course he'd want to go – a brilliant inventor and a mechanic, why would he stay here, in the back of beyond? No, he was most certainly leaving, even though Steve was doing his best not to think about that. This was Steve's last chance.
right thing, anything that wasn’t a joke or an oversimplification or a cliché. He was careful not to say anything he wouldn’t say to, for example, Thor. No wonder nothing was working out.
," Tony said emphatically, catching both Steve's hands in his own. Which might have been a mistake, since they were so big and warm that Tony had to suppress the urge to hug them both to his chest.
And Tony could get away with it now, he knows, he could get away with saying nothing right this instant, and maybe they could learn to understand each other without too many words and maybe, at some point... maybe they would be so completely attuned to each other they could function real well like that.
The voice is metallic and level and it almost catches Steve by surprise, because he's used to hearing Tony's voice over the comm even when he has his helmet down. Over the comm, it's still Tony's voice. Tony doesn't lift the faceplate now, makes no move to step out of the armor, he's just standing there, near the door, all red and gold and cold.
She pulls it on, and then there is the nauseous shifting in the fabric of reality again. Thanos is no more and the gauntlet is no more, but all Steve has eyes for is Tony, who lands next to him and lets the nanities of his helmet disappear.
The simulator kept going faster and faster; the same maneuver, then the variations, one side and then the other, up and down, one enemy, two, three, evade, and do the loop and shoot, then another loop, then shoot again, faster and faster until his reflexes could barely keep up. Hot exhilaration coursing through him, he became aware of Cap's voice, nearer than it was supposed to be. "Lagging. You're lagging. The left, Stark.
Trying to steer their horses down to the river promises only trouble, but in order to get to the cabin for the night, Steve needs to get them across the water ways. The best place to traverse the river is within the rocky ravine. He stops them before they start the descent. Dropping to the ground, he digs out a scarf from his saddle bag, and tosses it to Tony, who catches it with ease.
Rumlow stood there and waited for Tony to answer, to tell him that he should have Steve worry about him. Instead, Tony rasped out, “Go to hell, you motherfucker.”
“What? No!” Steve bangs the table with the thick cuffs. “That can’t be still on the books. That’s an out of date law.”
The nurse and an orderly wheel the gurney out of the room. Steve stands there, alone, lost. His finger finds his wedding ring and his heart pounds in his ears. He doesn’t know how he gets to the room they’ve assigned to him, but somehow he’s there with Clint. The surgery is over in less than an hour. Steve spends the rest of the day at Tony’s side, reading as his husband slumbers.
Tony wraps an arm around his waist, tucking him close as he pounds into him. Steve cannot help the mewling and then outright sobbing need that streams out of him.
Steve nodded a greeting to the rest of the team and then introduced Sam – even though he was pretty sure that it already happened in DC. Some of his memory was disturbingly fuzzy from the time he spent in the hospital. Clint entered the room and sat next to Steve. Clint looked better as if he hadn’t been laid up due to some metaphysical ailment of his soul just a few days ago.
Steve takes it. “You are like a dog with a bone.” He accepts the helmet and then snaps it on. It smells weird. “What’s that smell?”
“On duty then? Not dressed for it.” He walked around the bar and headed toward the conversation pit. Raising his glass he said, “The joys of being retired.”
“No. No. It’s not,” Steve gulps out between the waves of pain spiking through him. If it’s all in his brain, why the hell does it hurt so much?
“I don’t-.” Tony stops and his brain stutters over the statement. Only one thing pops into his head and he blurts it out as he yanks his hand away from Steve. “Did you fuck my dad? Christ, you fucked Howard!”
Standing in front of him, Ross observed in the half dark twilight of the room. Steve lidded his eyes and tried to stop what was happening to his body, to figure out what was happening to him, but the fuzz in his head clouded any analytical thoughts. He growled this time, but it came out muted.
Stane places a hand on Steve’s upper arm. “Of course, I would hate for him to have those nightmares on top of all the others.”
“Controlling interest in what? My family? My clan? I’m a prime alpha – a dom at that, he can’t even think about it.” The very idea that Estane would even think to fight for Tony’s own family rights appalls him. “Does he even have an Omega warrior?”
After he finishes Tony squints into the sunshine. He needs to find a way out of here. If he can get the HUD to work, then he will be able to communicate with JARVIS. He looks down at the arc reactor, at some point last night he must have removed the wires connecting him to the gauntlet. He must have been exhausted not to remember anything, plus the sleeping with the man-eating lion. But that is not fair, he has no idea if Blu puts people on the menu.
There’s a flash and Steve jerks to see the Everhart is trying to barrel through the parade of guards. Tony only smiles and then Pepper says, “We have to go. It’s time.”
Steve stands up and says, “Not a Captain anymore.” He offers his hand. Strange takes it and gives him a firm shake. “Just Steve is fine. Please to meet you Doctor Strange.”
“Oh you haven’t felt anything yet.” Tony picks a rhythm that’s both merciful and tormenting. A few quick thrusts and then one long torturous motion that has Steve holding on like he’s about to be thrown free of a ride. He rotates his hips in response to Steve and then hits the sweet spot, startling his lover.
“You okay?” Clint says and Steve peers up at him. He’s leaning in the doorway, arms crossed, eyes sharp and bright.
He hears the sounds of crackling lightning again and his mind flips back to Thor. It’s not Thor – it’s Ultron tricking him, distracting him. But the shield is already in Steve’s hand and when Hulk pounds down at him, the shield deflects and resonates with a high pitched whine. Hulk stumbles back.
“Sonnet 29. It’s cliché I know, but it’s always been my favorite. I know it by heart,” Steve says and knows his voice is wistful and yearning.
“Glad you are alive.” Steve pushes the bedrail down and climbs out of bed. He wobbles on his feet and that’s a tell tale sign that he’s hungry and weak. He pulls off all the monitoring wires that Bruce begged him not to and then goes to Tony’s bed. The rail is down in an instant and he crawls into bed with him. It’s a tight squeeze but it’s about right. Tony situates himself on top of Steve and they doze.
“Okay,” Steve said and clapped his hands. “Boot up.” He looked at Laura. “Ma’am if you could keep the children in the house.”
“No, it’s not okay. He infected JARVIS. He’s been a double agent all this time,” Tony said and pushed Steve behind him so that he could protect him with his body.
He goes back to searching the room. Only the barest of essentials here with the bed, the table next to the bed with a drawer with several toys – nothing too elaborate. There’s also salve for after bonding. He picks up the tube and shakes his head. It’s expired. What else is new?
“I don’t think I could be a brain surgeon and luckily, I don’t have to!” He laughs a little, knocking her with his elbow, and she joins him. It eases the tension between them.
“It kind of was for a lot of my life.” Probably still is, but Steve keeps mum about that little fact. Pre-empting Tony’s analysis of the sonnet’s meaning, he jumps in and says, “You let the cat out of the bag with that one, didn’t you? Now I know you secretly want to have sex in public.”
“Maybe someday,” Steve said and leaned down to kiss him. Right now, it didn’t feel wrong or misguided or even filled with the devil. Kissing Tony felt right. “Beloved.”
Waking up shouldn’t hurt so damned much, but he’s learned during his lovely stay at Hotel Terrorist that surprises are the name of the game and are always horrible. He squints into the darkest pit of the cave and shivers. God, how he’d hoped he would wake up from this fucking nightmare, wake up in his Malibu mansion, the ocean singing in the background, and a good cheeseburger or two available to eat. God, he wants to fucking eat something.
Steve hesitated. He shouldn’t let her boss him around especially at such a sensitive juncture, but the fact remained that Natasha knew this version of Bucky much better than he did. Bucky threw Steve a glance and it felt like he’d lobbed a fast ball right into his gut. He stomped away, knocking past Natasha and going to the corridor. Natasha waited and when he was out of earshot said, “It took you how long to accept your own orientation? Don’t expect it to be overnight for him.”
Steve tosses the gauze and tape. His ribs are a horrid color of blue and black. "Let's say I know a little more than you think I do about who you are. Let's say I know you’re smarter than my average John. Let's say that I get you're curious. Let's say all of that. But in the end it won't get you anywhere or me. Or us. If you out us, we're gone. We have to move on. I don't want to move from here. It's the best place for us to figure things out. We burned our bridges elsewhere. Please, darling, don't."
The world around them fills the space. The gulls, the sea, the breeze sing together. The winds hit him and it’s chilled. Tony smells the saltwater and thinks maybe in the distance some seals might be around, he can smell their fishy hides. “You’re not going to lose me, Steve. No one is.”
“Your hole is pretty. But it needs abuse, doesn’t it?” Steve doesn’t answer right away, but the blush hits his face hot and warm. “Answer, omega.”
Steve has no words so busies himself with the water. Tony studies him and, with his hands in his pockets, says, “Cho said it went better than expected.”
When he finally pushed in the targeting blade and the bullet hit him in the back, he faltered and fell. He stared at the wound bleeding down his abdomen – the bullet had gone straight through him. In the very near distance he heard a wail as if the souls connected to him screamed out, trying to reel him back. He shivered against the cold and struggled to his feet. Listening to their calls as they suffered and struggled to survive the cataclysm and hell raining down upon them. Steve staggered, mourning the bonds linking him to them. He hated to think of them suffering, but his last act needed to be about Bucky, his brother. He closed off the beseeching cries along the tendrils of souls, severing them as if he cut off his own limb.  He went to Bucky then, not the Winter Soldier. He went and begged him to remember. He dropped his shield, the pain in his gut burned through him like fire. He went to pull off his glove to touch Bucky, but it was too late.
“I have my ways. But mostly Happy helped out a lot. He likes to do things for me. He’s my driver and Head of Stark Industries security. He spent a lot of time working on this for me. But now you’re here.” He drops off and doesn’t add -
“Let me,” Tony says, and he leans over to place the cup on the table and then turns back to Steve. “Can I touch you?”
There was so much Steve wished he would never remember. He nodded to Tony. The weakness had settled into his bones and became a part of him. For Tony’s sake, Steve wanted to jump out of bed, wrap Tony in his arms, and show the same strength, commitment, and fortitude that he’d done for so many years as Captain America. The thing inside of him prevented him, though, some deeply hidden weakness that drilled down to the marrow of his bones. He watched as Tony sat down next to him in the bed, gathered Steve in his arms and held him against his chest. Tony spoke in low tones.
He jumps and turns to find Steve standing in the doorway. “God, Steve. I’m sorry. I came in to get my tablet.” He lifts it as if it’s a defense.
Stark seethes at him, his eyes penetrating and black. “My father’s dead. I’m here because I know what it means to work with your hands and want to change things. I’m here to make life better in this shit-ass town. If you want me, I’m here. If not, then I’ll take my doctor and leave.”
“Are you sure? It won’t disintegrate into a thousand of these little buggers all over the floor?” Steve reaches to the shield.
"No ma'am, just trying to find out about my friend." He clears his throat. "Like I said on the phone I could make it worth your time."
“I understand. When I was younger and smaller, no one could see me. I mean even my best friend didn’t see me as a fighter. He kept wanting me to stay out of trouble.”
“Not Vision,” Wanda says, and her eyes go a bit dreamy. That is new Steve thinks but doesn’t comment as Wanda focuses on him to ask, “What’s going on Steve? Don’t tell me you’re falling for the fairy tale already? It’s only been a day.”
“Ah! Look whose talking? You flew a bomb into a hole in space. You always try and do the right thing and take everything on your own back. So don’t tell me-.”
“I want to hear you, I want to love you,” Tony said and let Steve flip him over. In no time at all, Steve had Tony on his back, knees over Steve’s shoulders and rammed into him – battering like a storm against the shore. Never relenting. Never pausing. Never stopping. Sweat dripped from his forehead and down his temples. He pushed in all the way and speared Tony. He felt fuller, tighter than ever and he growled out his approval as his feeding gland ached anew.
Hesitant, Tony scans the dark cave, wonders if he should wake Steve – he’s obviously having fever induced nightmare. If his wounds are infected, Tony’s screwed. Gathering himself, Tony crosses the small distance, only to see the same aura around Steve. It’s fainter this time, almost like an after image, or a blurred photograph as if the photographer captured Steve in motion.
The light blinded Tony. He squinted, and Natasha pushed him behind the pantry cupboard. “Door, Rogers, door!” Natasha ordered.
“He’s very qualified, but he knows nothing in the biomedical realm, Tony.” Pepper has a tablet in her hands, and she taps on it. It immediately sends the data to Tony’s glasses. He reads through it as she speaks. “He has a high IQ and a reasonable aptitude in the sciences. I think he’ll catch on quickly, but he won’t be more than a lab technician.”
It was good to hear that, to know that they truly had found a safe harbor. Steve stood up from the bed. His legs wobbled, and he held onto the side of the table. Disorientation came over him, he swayed. Tony grasped his arm to help him. He’d been foolish. He thought his strength had returned. Maybe this Divini thing cursed for humans.
“I look forward to it. And Tony?” Pepper adds. “Please get some rest. It’s going to be a stressful few days.”
An example of two sine waves with ebbs and crests matching was given as a figure. Steve knew a little about math, though geometry was never his strong suit. He scrolled past the figure and continued to read.
“Then what is wrong with me? I know what an omega is – what an omega should be. His role and his caste. Lord, if Estane drilled anything into my head it was that omegas were to be subservient. Not loved, not a part of the family,” Tony says and throws up his arms. He cannot seem to explain the dichotomy of thoughts running through his brain. “But it doesn’t have to be that way. Some alphas enjoy their omegas. I know this. But why doesn’t that lead to something more balanced. Why do I feel like I’m the bad guy.”
Words scatter around him like pieces of glass; they are sharp and jagged and pierce through the fog. He hears Tony asking questions and he wonders if the words are directed toward him. He cannot move his mouth. They don’t  exist.
“You can’t ask someone to fake date you, Tony,” Pepper is saying. “He could report you for sexual harassment.”
Tears blinded him. “I’m not even his mate anymore. He doesn’t need my blood. He needs nothing from me.”
Quickly, he turns away and focuses on his designs. Yinsen managed to get extra drafting paper from their captors and Tony uses the sharp edge of the battery connected to his chest to start the schematics. He’ll get this done. His father told him scaling down the arc reactor was a fool’s game. It couldn’t be done. But that was Howard – drunk and broken. He may have invented the thing, but he never truly understood it. Like Edison inventing the light bulb. He might be able to craft it, but he would never understand the true nature of electricity and atoms. Howard was miles behind Tony in intellect. Now, Tony needs to take his smarts and run a race where the penalty for losing will be his life and the lives of so many more.
Coming to terms with having a label and a position in a soul pack but not actually being accepted by the Steve, the fulcrum of the pack, drained away any of the hope he mustered. Tony recognized that in his own mind he flip flopped a lot regarding what he wanted from the soul pack but especially what he wanted from Steve. It would have helped a ton if Steve showed any outward signs of welcoming Tony. Sure, Tony felt the constant presence through the soul bonds, and the twice daily pings to ensure the pack members were safe, but nothing else grew from the seed of their soul binding.  Yet standing at the crash site today and experiencing Steve reaching out, searching for his fellow pack mates changed Tony. It hurt to think he stood on the sidelines. He wanted more from this pack. He hungered for it, but how could he when the pack leader simply thought of him as disgusting?
The little mechanical device judders in Tony’s chest. It isn’t right – it’s not the way it is supposed to work. Steve has seen it enough times to know better. “How do I shock it? How do I get it to work better?”
Natasha scowls at him. “I had a feeling you were going to say that. I’ll see what I can do to keep it on the quiet. But this is it, Steve, if anything and I mean anything like this happens again, we report it and file a complaint.”
“Bucky, you don’t have to worry about me,” Steve says.  He owes Bucky a ton; his friend has never judged him, always looked out for him in more ways than one. “I’m not interested in Stark.”
It ended up that Fury tried to steer Steve toward areas in the V-Corps where he could make a difference. Routinely, Steve ran the beat where he hunted down and brought into custody the radicals who tried to burn Vampires and torture humans who associated with them. But that had been years ago, and their problems always lurked around the corner like shadows hidden from the sun.
“For how long are we safe?” Steve muttered. He sat up and Tony could tell by the way he rapidly blinked his eyes that he was in the midst of a dizzy spell brought on by lightheadedness. Even with the serum, Steve needed an extra boost now and then to deal with the blood loss. A lot of vampires supplemented their mates’ diets with raw meats, iron, and omega 3 fatty acids in order to ensure a strong hemoglobin count and immune system.
Should he stop and call Tony? Tell him that he would be away? Tearing the helmet off, he pulled out his phone and called, he left a message. “Tony, I have to go and do some pack leader stuff. I’ll be back as soon as I’m able.”
“If it were only that.” Steven studies him. He licks his lips as if tasting the words before he answers, “Perhaps I have wished for better. There is nothing in our biology that says I am less than you are.”
Tony steps into the room. The view is outstanding. There’s a small lake, pond really, in the front that’s crystalline and icy in the drifting snow. “It’s beautiful,” he murmurs.
When the agent eyes Steve again, his expression softens. “Hey, just don’t let them hook you to any of the Strike teams. Those motherfuckers are batshit crazy when they get off a tour.” He slides the Residential chip to Steve.
Steve’s had a lot of practice over the months he’s been a whore holding back his orgasm until his assignment finds fulfillment. He can do this all day. But this time, he doesn’t have to – not at all. He can come, and fill Tony up. “I’m gonna fill you up, baby. You hear that sweet one, you’re gonna drip with me for days and days.”
Bucky cries out on the cot, and Steve startles out of his thoughts. He jumps up, putting the book aside on the bureau. Dipping a cloth into the cool water in the pitcher, Steve brings it over and lays it on Bucky’s forehead, and tries to soothe him, wash away the burning fever. Bucky opens his eyes with there’s something that eats away at Steve’s heart.
“That’s really odd. He should know better,” Tony says but heads toward the wreck. He turns briefly to Steve. “Are you coming?”
Tony opens his mouth but Steve replies, “As long as the rest of the deal is kept. My team comes home and is unharmed.” Tony seethes.
“Let’s just say, Captain, that happenstances of my life changed me. Some for the good, some for the bad,” Tony says. “I want to share the good with you.”
Tony gathered up the books and trudged over to his bed with the intent of sticking them under it. He could always pull one out when Howard yelled about it. As he pushed them under one of the books slipped off and flipped open. He started to read – he couldn’t help it.
It wasn’t true. He fought to open his eyes, to yell to JARVIS to get help, but his body answered to some other alien force. Inwardly, he struggled, battled with the growing senses of futility. His body frozen. His limbs became unresponsive, heavy and nailed to his sides. Darkness not like sleep surrounded him. It haunted him. Even as he tried to get his eyes to open, the creeping darkness slipped around him like a hand cradling his entire body. He fumbled, trying to fight it. He swung and then with great heave fell off the couch. Tony woke.
Intuitively, Steve reached out with one hand while keeping his other firmly on Sam’s torso. He grasped Tony’s hand and said, “I need more.”
“Twenty years of sobriety down the drain,” he mutters as his eyes implore Steve to say something to ease the pain. “All the champagne we had – wasn’t real. It was all fake.” Tony reaches for the tumbler and cringes. “But not this- not this little bit of poison.”
“Not yet, most of it is roughed in with circles and lines. I’ll do some more but you can leave if you want.”
“Oh,” Steve says and looks at the ad. “My printer sucks.” His mumbles the last and then with hands that are none to steady folds up the paper. “Sorry.” Tony reads the red blush of heat to his face. “Sorry, I really should get out of your hair then. I’m not mathematically inclined at all and I didn’t take stats at all in college.”
“Well, there goes the honeymoon, darling,” Tony says and winks at Steve – who is sitting frozen, staring at his huge breakfast.
“Going in,” Natasha says and a jolt of pain like lightning, like hotl liquid  metal, rides up his shoulder and down his arm to his fingertips at the same time.
Tony’s not sure what to make of JARVIS pronouncement, but his AI is concerned enough about it to inform him. Placing the interface on the lab bench, Tony pulls off his gloves and safety goggles and heads up to the bedrooms. When he gets there the door to the guest bedroom is partially open and he spots the flicker of light as someone passes and then paces back again. He knocks.
He went to the barn, giving only a quick wave to his pack mates before finding his way through the darkness up to the loft. He stopped at the door, wondering if he would be welcome. The tiny lantern near the side of the bed flickered with its electric light trying to emulate a candle. It barely offered enough light to brighten a 5 inch radius. Steve’s face lay in shadow on the pull-out bed, so Tony couldn’t discern if he was awake.
Most of the time he simply walks in – that’s how he did it on the ship. He pauses and decides to knock.
He settled in and examined the lead. It brought him here to 1437 Elmhurst Drive. A Clara Fury resides at the house next to a Jacob Beach. Tony walks up the flowered lined sidewalk to the small rowhouse in Baltimore. He knocks on the door clutching the paper work in his hand. The door opens and an older woman with kind eyes but a sharp gleam in them looks him over.
“No.” Why he said it, Tony couldn’t fathom or explain. He heard in the distance a voice ringing in his head, begging him, pleading with him. He aimed the repulsor but even as he debated a blur of motion swept by him. In milliseconds, the girl and her brother were standing next to him, her hands upraised and red energy crackling between them. He wanted to yell at her, to cry out, but then the world flashed crimson and he dropped away.
. That last moment he actually saw Bucky as he fell from the train etched a hole in his heart so deep and wide Steve never thought it would heal. But now he had a chance to – because he could apologize, talk to Bucky. As he focused on his old friend, something deep and profound in his eyes halted Steve. How could he waltz back into Bucky’s life and expect nothing to be changed? When he looked at how Natasha and Bucky interacted – it was intimate – a wash of embarrassment came over Steve.
Steve's hand on his arm. Too insistent, too tight for a social occasion. Someone might look at Steve's face, then see how white his knuckles were, digging into Tony's sleeve; someone could connect the dots. (His knuckles, white not because he held on so fast, but because it took everything he had
Steve knew Tony vented frustration through sex; he'd told Steve that years ago, when they'd touched upon it in a conversation. Steve should accept this for what it was, he knew that.
Sneaking a look over the man's shoulder, Steve spotted Logan, chewing on a cigar, nursing a tumbler of something amber-colored and trying to look as unapproachable as possible. Someone wasn't so good at reading the signs – a person, pushing forcibly in front of the guy, sticking out their hand like a lance.
The problem with playing at being a soldier was that Tony felt exactly like that: as if he were playing. Playacting.
I did my best to smile. "We could do that." It was depressing. I'd lost one house too many – so had Tony, I suppose. I'd thought I'd get used to the feeling of uprootedness. I loved people, I loved my friends, I loved Tony. I was happy to make my home wherever they were, but I had to admit something to myself: I felt this dull longing for a place I could come back to, years later, and still have it be there, unchanged. I teetered wildly between wanting to scrap together all the memories stuffed into the boxes around us and take them with me, and locking this place, tossing out the key and trying to do what I came here to do – start a new life. A clean slate.
Steve gave her a helpless look. "I don't know, " he said, fibbing a bit. He rubbed his forehead a few times. "That's not the... Look, the fraternization rules are there for a reason."
That dream never ended on its own accord. Tony always startled awake. There was sweat, there were tears; mostly, it was impossible to differentiate between the two. Occasionally, he would throw up. And on the other side of the world – and now he thought it was even true – he had a feeling Steve would sit up in bed and just shiver until dawn.
Tony touched him on the shoulder, just for a second, then let his hand drop. “See anything you like?” he said in a very soft voice, just to say something. Steve actually turned to look at him, which was, yes, a definite improvement.
, and Steve seemed to bump into him all the time, and Stark always had something smartmouthed to say – to Steve or in front of Steve – and then there were those looks that could burn through anything like hot lava (like hot chocolate, Steve thought, inconsequentially). Steve didn't know what to do with the way that made him feel. The more he tried to keep away, the more drawn to the man he was.
Tony shrugged; felt stupid. "It's dark, but there's an outline around the kitty door. That's where the food comes in." He was blocking it, so he moved to the side. "Anything?"
Tony: Again, okay, maybe it's better if you don't tell me who it is, in case I get pulled in too. But you could have your handler contact me somehow in case something goes to hell, okay?
, he thought without much conviction. Dread was rising in his throat gradually, like a slow, sneaky tide.
Tony: I do. And also, they are mine now. I expect the original as soon as it's safe to use the post again.
Tony keeps imagining how he would make him moan and fall apart if only he had the toys he actually liked - if the rules weren't designed specifically to make them hurt each other.
"Steve," Tony said, tentatively. "We can rebuild, you know? I never had the stomach to even come here before, but now that you're here – maybe we can do it? You know, together and all that."
Steve stepped into the kitchen, but Tony raised his hand, stopping him. "On second thought, you may actually get dressed if you want, you're beyond distracting this way. There are some clothes Rhodey left lying around over the years. In the cupboard in the living room. They'd be closer to your size than my pants, in any case."
But that would only complicate things. If that's the case, Tony should just lie low until Steve is out of here. That would be easiest. What a pity Tony never liked easy, really.
He did now, Tony noticed as he entered. There weren't any readily detectable signs of weariness, like you'd notice on someone else – black circles round the eyes or a general sag about the shoulders. No – Cap was always straight as an arrow and fresh as a rose; unbearably so. It could drive you crazy. Still – if you looked closely enough, there was now something in his eyes, around his eyes, that spoke of weariness, and Tony saw it there, and didn't like it one bit; then he reminded himself of his resolutions from the previous night, and also that he probably shouldn't be standing in the doorway, staring at his Captain like an idiot.
want to cuddle, then?" Steve said dryly. "I could pretend to snore if that would make things easier for you?"
. And personally, I firmly believe in democracy, and in sovereignty, and in the freedom of choice. This is not to say the others do not. They... I cannot speak for them, really. But what I can
Tony: But generally, screw people. I was thinking more on the lines of, right now I'm at an on-loan exhibition of Picasso's rare drawings
"You know what, I am," Steve said wryly, not even trying to sound convincing. "I really, really am."
Tony: So one solution would be to let it explode all over the world media, in Europe and everywhere. CANADA. But I got one better for you. I'm negotiating with Christine Everhart on this. As expected, she's making me piss blood over it, but I think it's going to work. Tell Natasha to pull the vid down from the net for now; we're giving Everhart the first exclusive rights to it for six hours.
Tony watched Steve move around, noticed him take in his surroundings once again – the dusty mantelpiece with a big, kitschy grandmother clock on it (this was a graveyard of unwanted presents), sharing the space with an old alternator and a glass jar of 2d nails. Howard had loved fixing the cabin himself. The room was lit by the fire and a single candle Tony had dug up from the kitchen drawer and slapped into a coffee cup because he couldn't be bothered to look for a candlestick. The couch and a pair of armchairs had paled with age and dust. The bookshelves were, of course, timeless.
"All I did blew up in my face. I fucked up. But, Tony, I..." The voices were outside their door now, and the first thud resounded.
He took out a small bottle of water. Without interrupting him, he placed it on the lectern, and, not looking at him, went back and sat down. When he finally met Stark's eyes, the man was looking at him with a slight frown on his face, as if puzzling over something. He snapped out of it at once, but Steve saw.
For a moment, in the reining silence that followed, nothing moved. And then the guns of Tony's old friends, like in a nightmare, turned on Steve, and everyone was yelling at the sheriff to
that tends to invite people he barely knows to live with him in his home after one battle, a lunch and some bonding. You don't have the best track record, Tony."
Steve frowned down at him, as he tended to do when he thought Tony's jokes were out of place. "You're not tricking me into using you as a shield or whatever."
The moment came and went too quickly, and the reason we were on the street came back to us. He wasn't going to get any help here; no one would open a handy portal and send him over to be a dad to a little girl in need of a Tony Stark. I knew I was supposed to dissuade him from that course of action anyway, but my heart ached for him instead. Let's face it. Whatever he decided to do, I was going to be there for him.
Steve frowned for a second, as if completely puzzled. Obviously, he couldn't imagine why Tony would ask for his number when Steve was just being polite and kindly. Tony should have shut up. Like, two years ago, probably.
"Oh, god," Rhodey whispered. "To hell with everything." And: "Okay." And then he turned around and shouted: "Carol!" far louder than the distance really warranted.
Rogers' face straightened almost instantly, but his eyes still glinted, almost mischievously. "Your pension plan is as follows," he bit off. "Elysium Fields if you're religious; airlock, flag and oblivion if you aren't. After ten years of service, you get ten more. You don't like this, you go back to tech and continue checking the deck for lose screws." Tony felt amusement stir inside him, so he tamped it down and shot a wry look at Rogers. Rogers caught it. Returned it, double sized.
"You're selling yourself short," Natasha observed coolly, and it didn't sound like a compliment at all. "It's easier that way, you know."
I thought frantically, ready to catch him if he fell, ready to perform CPR, but The Ancient One wouldn't do this to us, surely – she wouldn't send me to a timeline where Tony is alive only to have him suffer a cardiac arrest upon seeing me.
"I wish you failed," Steve says, and his smile is small and sad. What did Tony expect? Romantic music on cue? An impromptu proposal? What? They've both messed up too much, and Tony's final screw-up was the glorious culmination of it all, and it's too late for them... Just look at the downcast look in Steve's eyes. Even though he can't seem to look away from Tony's face. Even though...
