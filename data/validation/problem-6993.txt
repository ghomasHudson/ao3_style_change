Today's specials include a self-destructive, impulsive, shattered, genius and inventor Tony Stark, a la mode, served with a side of lawlessness, failure at relationships, and feelings dealt with ignorance and avoidance, with just a hint of regret, omnipresent pain somewhere in the left of his chest and a pair of haunting blue eyes.
"Just felt like a break I guess. You know, wanted to spend some time feeling like I  was spending it and not utilizing it, even if for a day." Tony crossed the street, getting in the way of a cab, as the driver hurled insults at him. He just put up a regal middle finger, and kept going on with his head high.
Tony picked up his wallet, shrugged on a hoodie. He grabbed a pair of sunglasses and slapped on his digital watch. It read ten forty. Giving himself a quick once-over, he headed to the elevator. With every passing floor, Tony became more and more apprehensive. Should he just cancel this whole idea and go on with his day at usual?
So, what the fuck did he need to do to forget every fucking thing that still brought up shattering images in his mind in the middle of the day? He couldn't go on like this, it was too painful, too pathetic. And he was Tony Stark. A broken heart to deal with was just another hurdle he was gonna have to tackle, although he hadn't yet pegged the reason behind this constant emptiness filling him up at every waking hour on a shattered heart. He hadn't yet reached the final stage of acceptance. Far from it.
Next came the alcohol. The slow traversal of golden, undoubtedly expensive liquid, down the drain under the sink. Pouring on, and on, it was almost as if it wanted to rush out of existence- drown every drop of itself in the unknown, never to be found. The empty bottle finally landed beside the clean dishes that were kept on the drying-station.
Pepper was right. It was no point painfully reminiscing over the past- it had happened just like it had happened. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't shake the images off his mind. But he could try to find peace with it, maybe discover a common ground.
Quietly taking the bottle out, Tony turned it over in his hand, letting himself feel it's weight, the density of the liquid inside it, as he was pulled into a vortex of his past.
Carla nodded. Once, twice. "Okay, I've got it, Mr. Stark. You can trust me with this, then. Why don't you wait around and I'll be right back when I'm done?"
Loneliness was rapidly and surely reforming its role as a habit- right when Tony had been lulled into believing that he finally had a family, a place where he belonged and was accepted for who he was, just as he was.
Next moment, his suit was drenched. Just fucking great. He'd been saliva-sprayed by three alien lizards who had probably set their hearts on Tony for dinner. He knew that the suit could handle water, but this was bodily stored digestive enzyme form three gigantic lizards from another planet that could spew out a tsunami from their mouths.
"Wow. You were concerned that I wasn't getting any." Tony covered his face. This wasn't a good morning, it was another godforsaken episode of Taunting Tony Thursdays.
God, had he missed the city. How many McDonald's had he passed till now? Even his, Tony Stark's brain couldn't remember. Just as he was about to sign a petition to officially instate burgers as America's national food, his phone rang.
"Oh, that's nothing. All I did was pick up some stuff from some shelves. Although, I do have a question."
"How was the conference in Japan?" Pepper cheerfully asked, as she widened her arms for Rhodes to hug her.
Wreaking havoc on his burger, Tony didn't care if he looked like a fool- bits of food sticking in his beard, he was too busy being incognito. It wasn't as if anyone was taking pictures of him.
"Sure, I'm not saying it can't. I'm just saying that you don't have to send me to Tokyo and Delhi and everywhere else to find something better, or more functional for me. You're just fine enough for me. Right, Pep?"
He stared at them for a long time. They were all smiling and looking cheerful. Steve was giving a full blown grin, exuberant blue eyes boring into the camera,  the knife held ready in his right hand, his left hand hovering over the table's edge.
The place was crowded, like always. Tuesdays didn't matter in Burger King. Tony Stark didn't matter in Burger King. And hence, he could truly enjoy his meal, not having been recognised even once this morning.
"Well, I had an amazing morning consisting of a blissfully anonymous breakfast at Burger King's. Now, I'm just roaming the streets of New York, figuring out what to do next on my rest-day."
Tony was sprawling on the couch, staring at the television. It was around one a.m, and he had no plans of getting off of his ass anytime soon. He felt weird sitting alone like this, trying to ignore his grating inner voice of reminiscence.
But what Tony had learnt- actually learnt- was that it meant smiling like a jackass until the world isn’t able to tell where the lies on your face end and where the truth in your eyes begin. Thanks to an incomparable amount of practise, he’s perfected the art of suppressing his emotions, drowning them- in fake smiles, in meaningless nightly (sometimes hourly) company, in alcohol.
"I don't suspect you. I care for you. I don't need a ring on my finger to show it is all." Her tone was clipped.
"You're right, he isn't." Rhodey looked at Tony, seriousness evident in his eyes. "Alright Tones, let's get you to bed."
After another hour, as the portal finally closed shut, was Tony able to take a breath of relief. Landing on the pavement, he saw Peter swinging towards him. Removing his helmet, Tony greeted Peter with a smile.
No sooner did the train start moving, was Tony lulled into a sense of dimmed consciousness. He wanted to sleep, but the adrenaline wasn't wearing off as quickly as he'd hoped it would. He was stuck in this confusing middle stage for now.
"It's the first time you haven't shown up at SI since the- since six months ago." She couldn't say Siberia. Couldn't even refer to it as 'The Incident'.
Military guy that he was, always tough on himself. Tony even tried to berate him about the dumb rules he made for his physio sessions, about how completing his goals mattered more than completing it in one go. Rhodey didn't care.
"I did? Must be a malfunction in my grammatical cognition abilities. I'm sure Mr. Holmes doesn't do that."
All Tony had gotten back was a, and he imagined Peter's innocent face while typing this- "Well there's some blue in there too. You think blue and red is original?"
He was about to scrunch up the flyer in a ball and throw it in a garbage bin, when Happy's face came into view, as the car came to a halt right in front of Tony. He shoved the flyer in his pocket and picked up his bags, placing them in the back seat. Getting in the seat beside Happy, Tony gave his own small wave to the man.
Three steps away, his feet suddenly stopped, as he stood there for a second, uncertain. Turning around and walking back to Peter, who was still rooted to where he had been standing, Tony grabbed the young boy's shoulders and his eyes turned the warmest shade of brown.
Maybe because back then, drinking was still relatively novel and he had had Jarvis and Rhodes and Obie (for the most ignorant parts anyways). Also, being thrown headfirst into SI not soon after, he’d been overloaded with too many things at once and found himself almost never free enough to sit down and contemplate about the gaping chasm in his heart and mental well being. And when he did find himself alone on rare, countable occasions, the women and seldom, men, had been there in his bed- keeping his mind off of things that threatened to encroach upon his pitiful and pathetic self.
He was surprised, truly genuinely surprised at the fact that there were zero calamities. Tony had got out unscathed from last night. Why? How? Did he-
Tears wouldn't come. That was one more benefit of alcohol- while his tongue was loose, his tear ducts weren't. Contrary to most, Tony'd never been someone who cried when emotionally difficult times struck, instead, he'd just packed and packaged it off to the unfathomable depths of his mind. He was good at that- remembering things that mattered. But right now, what mattered was that his friends knew that they mattered.
"Their salivary glands store saliva in extremely huge quantities, resulting in them shooting it through their mouths when required. The pH of saliva is slightly on the acidic side, and it's my opinion that they belong to a xerophytic environment, given the efficient moisture retaining physiology. Dry, scaly skin, nocturnal adaptation, and anatomical features support said opinion. In this planet, the kingdom Reptilia would explain most features. Except their eyes."
Yes, that was the glaring, obvious answer, besides the fact that Tony needed to get his ass out of bed. Willing himself to get up, he tried his best not to stumble, and made his way across the floor to the washroom. There, he carefully opened his eyes, daring to look at himself in the mirror. Time to assess some damage.
"You don't have to be so formal, kid." Tony laughed. "Anyways, you should go back to school. I'll try to call Happy and see if he can get the car by maneuvering it through all this rubble and concrete." He gave it a second thought, "Or if he could bring one of the choppers and land it on the roofs of one of the buildings that still luckily remain standing."
"Liar." His condescending inner voice taunted him. "It was the one place he visited most in the tower. He spent more time in the gym than in his bedroom, you really think a bedside photo frame would be a better choice?"  Tony wanted to strangle his conscience. He looked at the photo. It was from right after they'd defeated Ultron, when the tensions between the team had finally dissipated. They were all standing together, in front of the red, white and blue layered cake, with the American flag for the frosting. Right at the center, an edible figurine of captain america stood proud. The theme was a no-brainer, really, after all, His American-ness was born on the fourth of July. Thor and Barton, both had somehow made it for the evening, and even Natasha seemed less gloomy, ever since Banner had flown his green self into space (Tony had later Photoshopped Banner's picture on Steve's request, and had done a neat job of it, the proof was right there in Steve's locker). Steve was standing right in front of the cake, Tony, Thor and a Photoshopped Banner to his left and Natasha, Sam and Barton to his right. Wanda and Vision were both standing together behind Barton and Rhodey was standing behind Tony. Pepper was in Tokyo, away on CEO business.
Tony was rolling his eyes inside the armor, when he suddenly complained, "Hey, why'd you use the past tense? I'm still amazing."
Tony looked down at his own half-empty plate, and decided that since his appetite had, for some unknown reason, decided to leave him, Tony might as well get up and get going. He paid for the food, headed out and asked himself the million dollar question-
"Alright, come check for yourself, and I'm apologizing in advance to disappoint your scathing suspicions. Mac 'n' Cheese sounds okay?" Tony felt wounded. So, that's what Pepper thought of him- a crazy workaholic and a raging alcoholic?
"No, thankfully I remember that by heart. Interesting development, indeed. You know what, Friday, wouldn't it be amazing if I could analyze my emotions in the form of a pie chart? Note that down."
"Tony, you not showing up at work suddenly and sounding surprisingly sober on the phone is a reason for me to come. Is eight fine?"
It was only ten minutes ago when he was about to embark on his “self-care” routine for the millionth time- the bottle was ready, the glass was waiting, the ice cubes anticipating.
When he laid his head on the pillow, his brain started its involuntary whirring. The whirring which represented thinking about things that were meant to be thought about at ungodly hours like the one he was still awake at, no matter how bad he didn’t want to think about them. It was this whirring, this despicable, abhorrent sound that he could hear inside his brain, which was one of the reasons why he was desperate to find out why he couldn’t keep on pretending that the alcohol was working just fine. After all, it was his truest, oldest companion (not, in any imaginable universe, above Rhodey) that had got him through his parents’ death just fine.
"What makes you think I haven't been getting any?" Tony almost sounded offended. He could've been embarrassed, if not for his body's impressive resistance to blushing. "I'm Tony Stark." A hint of dilemma could clearly be heard.
Deciding to terrain the sidewalks like any other New Yorker, Tony started walking, catching up quickly to the regular beat of his steps. He had forgotten how quirky this city was- a potpourri of whatnot. He passed by a man dressed as Gandhi, a woman walking her dog dressed as Elvis (The dog, not the woman), a youngster playing the banjo outside a funeral home, a group of hippies distributing fliers about something Tony wouldn't even care to read, just throw it in a garbage dump as he turned round the corner.
It made Bucky look at Steve and pull him tightly in his arms afraid to let him go, he wondered, it was the only thing he has now, he wondered how much Steve had felt helpless in the past years they were apart. "It's OK; we can go to Peter's father and demand that he pays child support." Bucky said knowing that Tony would have already offered that to Steve, but knowing the Omega the punk was too prideful to except.
"The stars are talking… Thanos is going to reach Asgard soon; sooner than any of us thought, our only saving grace is that the Space Stone is in the hand of the Ancient One, and him being able to control the Stone enough to overcome its influence." Frigga whispered in a scared voice like she was telling Thor a forbidden secret that no one should ever hear of, and that itself caused worry and fear to talk hold of Thor's heart.
Steve dared to raise his hand, something my boy wouldn't do no matter what, especially when he is already smitten with you from the first time he saw you." Serpentine crossed her hands over her chest, the shadows behind her becoming wilder and even the dolls that were crawling on the grown shook their tiny heads in disappointment as they watch the events unfold before their button eyes…
So after agreeing on keeping the baby, Tony argues with himself about who to tell first, obviously his father was out, because let's face it, his father will worry too much about him, he will end up telling Stane and that bastard will end up manipulating his father against him, so his father was out of the picture, for now, that is. Rhodey was also out, mainly because he doesn't know where the Alpha was stationed, and because the Alpha would blame himself for what happened to Tony if he knew that the Omega got pregnant on the day of his party. And because Jarvis and his mother were dead (God rest their souls in peace) and he already told Dummy and his AI the great news. That left Pepper, who was supposed to return from her job interview right about now.
The next three hours were spent with Steven screaming and cursing and trying to wiggle out of those bracelets, he even tried to run, but his leg hurt so much that he fell on his face moaning in pain, which only made that metal fucker snort and watch him while opening its own arm which made a spark rush out, causing the creature to sigh and start tinkering with its own arm, which made Steven sigh and return to gaze at the bracelets trying to find a weakness in it. "Do you even sleep?" The creature asked when he saw Steven busy trying to free himself by biting the metal bracelets which so far no luck, it only ended with Steven's teeth hurting.
"Why did you tell me this?" Tony gritted through his teeth, wondering why of all the damn time Natasha decided to tell him her story. Why didn't she just answer his question and be done with it? Why did she feel the need to complicate things even further than they already were?
!" A voice from his nightmare purred not that far away, causing Tony to freeze in his place, feeling like a small mouse caught in the talons of a hawk.
Steve always seemed to understand him without him having to explain himself more than Tony was comfortable with sharing and the Omega is grateful for that, grateful that the Alpha understood… the Alpha didn't answer straight away, which made Tony close his eyes tightly, thinking that the Alpha was already asleep, but there was a tired sigh coming from down below which made Tony open his eyes and turn his head to the side.
"I don't know, we just click I guess? He was the same as Peter, probably why I feel more related and protective of him." Steve explained to the best of his ability, though Tony feel like Steve can't really put his feelings and thoughts into words, which made the Omega hum and snuggle into his embrace.
"It's so not my fault, Wanda! He came out of nowhere!" The boy said from behind him, and Tony let out a worrying noise, thinking that maybe the two of them are planning something other than this being an innocent bump in. But on another note, it wasn't like Tony didn't have the money needed if those two turned out to be little thieves who pickpocket him in the supermarket.
"I… do not want any dowry! I already arranged everything; I found a plot of land to build a house on, and I am going to pay the bride price, and I… I…" Whatever nonsense the man was going to say or try to wave to convince the queen to marry him, Anton didn't stay to hear; as fast as he can Anton turned away, his hands were clenched into tight fists and he gritted his teeth, anger coursing through him at what he witnessed.
Anton stopped in his place when he saw James sneaking around near the forest, and for a second Anton entertained the thought of calling the pup out and asking about his dam, who is probably sharping his (Probably stolen and not metaphorically) sword and heading to a quest to find Tyber and kill him for once and for all. Before Anton called the boy though, he was stopped when he found his son running toward the queen's babe, letting out a triumph yell when he jumped the boy; but Petrus' victory ended up soon as the children ended up rolling around and giggling happily.
"No Ma'am, it's just me, no family or a wife... I am a carrier, as for the kiddy I just confirmed the news with a pregnancy stick two days ago." Tony said trying to joke but failing at that miserably, especially when he saw the woman clench the car's wheel tightly after he said those words, which made Tony fidget and turn his gaze to the greenery outside. They followed the curve of the lake, the path leading down to the water's edge, and the house.
"Hey… what is it Handsome? Can't stay away from me the whole day?" Tony cheekily responded which caused the Alpha to let out a hearty laugh, a voice that nearly made the Omega melt as he let out a sigh and gaze at the man who was looking at him like he hung the moon.
Steve swallowed, trying to look around for an escape, only to find nothing, there are no windows other than a small one that won't even fit Steve's head, there are no other doors, no place to hide other than the tube, the only escape path Steve have is the same door he used to lock himself in the bathroom, a sturdy door that won't break easily. "Why are you doing this?" Steve asked, wondering if he made the man talk, time would pass and the police and Bucky would arrive and save him.
It was true that Steve had heard of her many times in passing; Peter seemed to enjoy filling Steve about his famous aunt whose secret weapons are high heels (Really?) but this was the first time he saw the woman in the flesh. It was due to her going on a business trip to Malibu by the time of his arrival at the tower. Pepper was fun, and it didn't hurt that the two of them had so much in common, which was a good thing in Steve's opinion. When Pepper start talking about the ball (Well, she called it Maria Stark Foundation but still, it has dancing, food, and fancy dresses, so it was a ball) that was going to take place in a few weeks from now, Steve couldn't contain his happiness… maybe just maybe, he had always wanting to ask Anton for dance and maybe this was his chance.
It ends up with Steve carrying Tony and putting him in the wheelchair in the corner that Jarvis brought earlier that day, he made sure not to dislodge the IV drip when he was doing that, Steve then took Tony toward the room that was attached to this room, that contained the pup. The second the entered the room and Tony's eyes fell on his pup, he starts sobbing loudly and trying to move toward the pup who was lying on the bed motionless.
Taking a deep breath, Tony marched to the door and knocked on it, not wanting to do something stupid and kick the door in a demon's face; he has enough of Steve hunting him, he doesn't want another thing that will. The door opened by itself, which caused Tony to close his eyes tightly and march inside, ignoring the chill running down his spine when the door slammed shut behind him. He didn't even turn around, his eyes taking in the room that he gave to Steve months and months ago, the first time he came to live with them. Surprisingly, the room was the same as the day Tony decorate it, nothing had changed other than the belonging that Steve brought with him or stole as time pass.
Steve's voice vanished completely, and he had to try with all of his strength to stop the tears trapped behind his lashes from sliding down his face that was getting hotter and hotter by the second. It was one thing to be shouted at like this by his mate in front of his brother, it was another letting his mate and his brother witness his weakness. Steve could only take a deep breath and try to ignore the humiliation that made him hot, he had to stay strong, maybe he could drag Tony with him to their room, at least then whatever the Alpha wants to shout at him, he wouldn't feel this humiliating pain. "Can we please go to our room?" Steve asked, hating how small his voice was, hating that he was so close to crying in front of Tony and Bucky.
Angie comes over to check on them and insists on bringing Tony a second serving, waving off his protests and whine with a glare and a threat. Tony could never go against Angie; he muttered soft thanks as Angie returns with a fresh bowl of broth in one hand and a jug of coffee in the other, setting the bowl down before him and filling his friends' cups. "C'mon, eat up!" Angie patted him on the shoulder. "Get some nutrition in ya, people will start thinking you're the ghost." Angie narrowed her eyes until he took the first bite of his second serving, causing the woman to smile.
"I… I waited and you didn't show up! Why?" Peter whined like five years old, but the small pup didn't care about that, not when the Alpha finally showed up after breaking his promise of coming and taking him to the lab, something that Peter dreamed about since he was very little and invented his first circuit board... but at least the Alpha showed up, not like... Peter shook his head at that trying to stop his line of thought.
Natasha pressed her lips tightly as she looked at the lake, her eyes going distant as if she was lost in some memory before she blinked, clearing her throat, her eyes gazing at the lake with a soft look. "You know… I was a kid when I came here? A foolish nine years old whose immigrant parents sold her to the highest bidder as a child bride." Tony tensed as he heard these words, a gasp trapped between his lips refusing to be let out. "I didn't know much, only broken English and that I was going to live in hell so different than Russia but still the same. Maybe that was the reason why when my
"They are going to be so jealous." Peter whispered in excitement which caused Steve to laugh a little at that, which painted a big smile on Peter's face as he looked at Steve happily, causing the Omega to sigh a little to himself before telling the boy it was bedtime, which made the boy pout a little and whine, causing Steve to smile a little.
"James, slow down!" The queen's voice was heard as he tried to calm the boy, but Anton wasn't focus on the queen, he was focused on Tyber who was becoming paler and paler if that was even possible, taking the shade of a sick person the nearer the Omega came until the two of them stood face to face. "You!" That word was a snarl, making the blood curl in the veins; even Anton had to flinch at the dark and hateful look Tyber was at the end of.
But what scared Tony was how the man said he will handle his teammates if they objected, like Tony's opinion was forfeited in this whole affair, which kinda made him a little mad that the man would immediately turn toward his friends thinking that their opinions matter without asking him for his permission, Tony was thirty-five for fuck's sake! He wasn't a fifteen years old girl that needed her father's permission to date someone, he was an adult!
It made Steve concern, it made him scared that something wrong with his baby, it all started when a month later Peter who was watching Tony Stark AKA Iron Man save the day once again, the inventor had made a place for himself in the pup's heart, Superhero the pup used to squeal happily, then it turned to his hero. May had been with him that day, telling him about her another failure appointment with the doctor, the poor woman and her husband had been trying for a child for years. It all started when they heard a scream from the living room, it made them run to see Peter crying with his nose bleeding heavily, Steve had panicked that day, he had run to his son to stop him from rubbing his nose and smearing the blood everywhere, May had run to her house to bring her car.
"Do you wanna go inside for a coffee?" Steve asked and Bucky laughed at that nodding his head. "But first… I wanna introduce you to someone." Steve said with a mischievous look pulling Bucky to the house next to his and knocking on the door, a few seconds' later footsteps could be heard from the inside and the door was opened and Bucky had to focus to be able to see the small blur with the blue baseball hat rushing to hug Steve tightly.
"It is not about understanding your side; I get it, the two of you were angry that your best friend caused the death of your only son. And because Rogers is not even a human, you don't feel guilty for what you did; even when he was your best friend, what you feel guilty about is lying to me for so long." Stated Tony, getting uncomfortable by the second as he looked any other way than his friends; Tony had already considered every scenario there was after Natasha left. As much as the town's people hated Rogers for killing and taking many lives, it didn't stop them from worshipping him and seeking his protection; if you asked Tony, it was messed up, really messed up of them to use Rogers like that and then throw him away like a used tissue, all because of a fucked up person wanted the power Rogers was cursed with.
"Hey wait! Steven, Steven, Steve wait! If you don't come back here your name will become Stevie!" Tony squeaked as he rushed after Steven, Bruce, Clint, and Thor followed Tony and Steven too, probably wanting to know more about the reincarnation theory (In Bruce and Thor's case) or wanting to ask Steven for some of his good luck (Clint) needless to say when Steven saw them, he booked it toward his room with Peter in his arms. Natasha, Peggy, and Bucky looked at each other with and shrugging at what they saw, but when they heard the sound of something crashing they cursed and rushed after their fellow Avengers, in hope of saving Steven in time.
"Did he?" Tony asked as he leaned back to check his baby, who was nodding his head fast, it was then that Tony noticed that his baby was wearing the karate uniform that Angie brought for him on his birthday not a long time ago which made the Omega puff his chest at how adorable his baby was wearing that outfit. "You look amazing, baby! Going to take Captain America down for Mama?" Tony asked just to be a little shit while cooing at his baby, making the four years old boy giggle at that and nod his head, which made Tony throw a smug look at the Alpha who was petting Goose with a smile.
Be assured though, that this is not the end of this story. I still need to write the story in Steve's POV and let's not forget that the prologue is still in the process of being written… so two more chapters to go! But if you like, this is the official ending for the story, so you can stop here.
Five months after that day at the clinic, Steve and Tony texted and called each other as much as they could even went to Central Park snd a few cafes and restaurants, and Tony was happy to say that they reached the stage when they can call each other a friend
The picture had both Tony and Steve in it, from the angle of the picture it looked like someone was standing outside of the office when they took it. Both Tony and Steve were kissing and holding each other wearing the same clothes they were wearing now; what made Steve pale though was the words that were written under the picture in a red sharpy.
Tony hummed to himself as he started preparing the picnic basket, promising himself that Tony and the kids could have their picnic in the backyard if needed. Tony hummed as he wondered about the kind of treats the kids would love to eat, thinking excitedly about tomorrow and how Steve would return home either tomorrow or the day after that. Tony was sure that when Steve returns home, the four of them would probably go and do something fun, considering that Steve had the uncanny ability to cheer the kids no matter what activity they choose to do.
"I want you to be Tony's doctor…" Steve said making the Beta choke on his tea and start coughing at that when Bruce looked at Steve with a panicked look, Steve gave a tired smile. "The only one I trust here is you, and to be honest I think the doctor in charge of Tony is hiding something, please Bruce, I wouldn't have asked you something like this if I didn't know you can do it." Steve plea making Bruce groan at that and mutter something about him not being that kind of doctor, which made Steve smile happily at that…
"It is… it is not like that…" Peggy's words trailed as if she wasn't even sure when she gave her answer, which more than anything made Tony shift in his place, getting uncomfortable by the confirmation he just gained. Tony doesn't really know what to do with that kind of confirmation other than trying to hide his wince.
"Are you ok, sir?" A small accented voice asked him, it made Tony raise his head to look at the person who spoke, a pup with a dark brown hair, brown eyes, and pale skin, Tony wondered if he was losing his mind as he let out another sob and curl on himself, trying to will his mind to stop this nightmare.
"Well, that's not something new, we all know that Stark is one lucky mother-ouch! What the hell Nat?" Clint whine as he nursed the sore spot he gained from Natasha's elbow jabbing in his ribs before letting go, the redhead on the other hand send Clint a death glare promising him death and pain if he cursed in front of Peter once more, it was reassuring, Natasha being protective of Peter that is, it made Tony relax a little.
"… They are dead…" Steven finally said after a while, swallowing and turning to the kettle, busying himself with making another cup of herbal drink for himself, his words though made the king pause, for the Alpha already knew that this was a possibility, considering that no Omega of his people will leave with the southern monsters unless they were forced.
It was a couple of eventful months; Tony could admit that. Between him and Steve going over their wedding plans, preparing for their month-long vacation, taking care of Peter, and mending their broken relationships with family and absent friends, and doing their jobs; there wasn't that much free time in their schedule. Tony will admit that it was stressful and he felt tired half of the time, but Tony won't replace any minute of it no matter what, especially when things were finally looking up.
Steve hummed and closed his eyes, waving his hands over the crystal ball, waiting for an answer, any type of answer really, but he only wanted to talk to one person, and one person only, someone who will be able to give him the answer he wants, someone who knew what's like to love a normal human who doesn't have the Addams genes, someone… someone like his mother.
"Keep your head down and shut up…" Steve growled making Stane gasp at that and watch Steve with terror. Steve could hear the shocked voices behind him but Steve didn't… couldn't care, didn't care that he had to use his Alpha growl, didn't care he broke a law of not using that voice unless, in danger, he didn't because that voice was getting fainter and fainter... dying out...and Steve felt that if he was late… he would regret it… Steve let go of Stane and went under the stairs, he saw from the corner of his eyes how Fury went toward Stane looking at Steve with a furrowed brows, and lack of trust, something didn't bother him as he thought it would…
"Just because my father-" She was cut by a glass of water being thrown her way making her squeak and avoid it last she got smacked in her face, she looked at Steve who thrown the glass with a feared look.
"And who the fuck are you?" Steve asked snappily which made the Alpha's face twitch just a little but he didn't do anything other than pulling a letter out of his suit pocket and hold it to Steve.
He still haven't found his baby boy, his baby that was supposed to be seven years and a half by now, a year pass without even having a picture of his pup to be able to define him by it, a year pass and Tony's hope was slowly leaving him, a year of following every lead and clue he could find about the pup, and nothing had come out of it, his friends were supportive, he could see it in their eyes, the hope that they felt every time he walked inside of his house after another appointment with another social worker, only for the hope to dash at Tony's anguish look.
calm. lowering his shaky hand to his belly, Tony could only gaze at his red substance painting his hand in dizziness when he raises his hand to his face; no sound left Tony, as he could only stare at his hand as his vision start having dark spots in them.
"You have a child?" Steven asked, wanting to change the subject farther away from the sanity question, and he thanks his lucks when the female answered the question and forgot her earlier line of questioning, which made Steven relax a little and listen to the female words.
"You mean your bastard child?" Natasha snipped, still angry that after all these years, Steve didn't give her any passing thought if it didn't include him hexing her or scaring her to death. I mean the woman went into an early midlife crisis and dye her hair blond, what the hell?
"Do you really think I am an idiot enough to actually work with you? Willingly? You get to be joking with me! I have met many stupid villains but you Sir are taking the cake." Tony snorted after he regained his breath, the humor still painting his face when Zemo's face turned dark at those words.
"You feel so good, Tony; so fucking good." Steve looked down at his lover as he spoke, leaning down to steal a kiss. "I love feeling you so deep inside me, filling me up. You're the only Alpha who could drive me wild like this, who could take me like this. Your knot is the only knot I need, and I need it,
"What's going to happen to my baby?" Steve asked, dreading the answer already, this was the first time that Steve managed to hear the truth about the Stark family, and it was only thanks to his brother-in-law who was facing the same dilemma as him; it made Steve concern and scared wondering what's his daughter's fate going to be, and what would happen if Steve finally went through the divorce as Natasha and Sam tried to convince him.
After they reached a faraway place from the screaming children and noisy adults Betty turned to Tony, a tired look on her face like she doesn't know what to say to him. "I gathered that he was abused by the way you acted over there, can you tell me more detail about him?" Tony stated as he crosses his arms, feeling like knowing what Betty will say next will make his mood darken.
Tony didn't know if he was going to sob or was going to choke on his laughter. It was so funny, so, so funny… now Tony can never get back home to new york, not when his father was keeping an eye on Rhodey and Pepper, not if he was already spying on them and accessing their phones. On the other hand, Tony can't stay here, he can't stay in this town and risk his baby getting hurt, or worse, getting her killed by the town's people or the monster that was living in the lake… Tony was really stuck… he was really stuck with no way out, surrounded by all sides that with no escape.
Tony on the other hand, just gave the woman a soft smile, taking her hand in his and giving it a gentle squeeze. "Would you believe me if I say you are not dreaming?" Tony asked with a soft smile, causing Sarah to let out a shuddered breath and nod her head, wanting desperately to believe that this was real. "Come, I have someone who would be overjoyed to see you," Tony whispered gently, pulling Sarah with him closer and closer to the room filled with childish giggles and laughter. Going inside Sarah could only gaze at the sight in front of her with shock and longing, her tears finally sliding down her face when the man holding the child raised his head and their eyes met… if this was real…
The sound of the door being opened made Tony narrow his eyes and with caution, he left the bathroom, then he froze… Obadiah Stane entered the room with a smirk.
Months passed, and with them came Winter. In the next few months after his meeting with Peggy and Bucky, Tony was displeased when he noted that everyone in the town started to approach him after months of keeping their distance. Tony didn't want to be approached, he didn't want to trust the people who hid something important from him and endangered his child's life, he didn't even want to stay in this town but was forced to because Howard was closing in on his location. Tony just wanted to be alone, he just wanted his and his daughter's life to be bearable, good, with no dominating presence forcing them to do what they don't like or hurt them when they are displeased.
Steve's jaw dropped, and disbelieve colored his eyes as he gazed at Tony. "Are you out of your mind?" Steve whispered, causing Tony to back away a little, what James did that Steve, docile and loving Steve, talked back to him? "You blame your own brother for your shortcoming? What the hell happened to you?" Steve's voice cracked, taking a step back when Tony reached out to touch his arm. "This is not you Tony, this is not you! Ever since you start taking extra hours at SI you changed, it's your father, isn't it? He stuffed your mind with his ideals again, is that it?" Steve asked, his eyes pleading with Tony, silently ordering him to explain himself.
"Is that so?" Anton hummed, his eyes falling to Shield in deep thoughts wondering if any of James's words had truth to them or if it was nothing but an over-exaggerated story told to the babe. But thinking about it now, Nattalegg did tell him that she found the Shield hidden in a secret place in the treasure room… as if the person who put it there wanted it to stay hidden no matter what.
"You know, I always thought that the stars were majestic beings when I was a brat, like they don't know how to swear at all, but I don't know if I'm disappointed or not to know that they do." The one who said those words was the blond with the bow, his words meant as a whisper, but unfortunately for him, Steven could hear them clearly.
"…Mr. Stark…" Harley said slowly, shifting in his stand, eyes darting from side to side which informed Tony that his worse fear was true; Harley has run away. Looking at the dirty clothes he was wearing and the muddy shoes did nothing but confirm Tony's thoughts, no kid in the clinic or the orphanage wore old clothes like this, not when Tony made monthly donations and fundraising to support the clinic.
Hearing that, Steven touched the deck slowly, gazing at Tony's eyes as he raised himself, hesitant and unsure as to if he was waiting for him should Tony push him back or leave. "
"But Dad!" the two teens whined as they were scolded once again for running away and leaving his side and annoying other customers. Tony felt a little bad for the harsh scolding the two teenagers got, but from the tired and exasperated look on Mr. Wilson's face, this was not the first time the two teenagers did something like this. "We are sorry, Mr. Stark." The two teens chimes in cynic as they turned to apologize to Tony after being ordered by their father; Tony on the other hand waved the apology away, a comforting smile on his lips informing the two teenagers that they were forgiven.
"Mama… Papa's Shield..." The pup's excited voice as he pointed at the Shield, touching it with his small hands made Tony smile and nod his head, he wonders to himself if Steve even understood his baby's broken speech long enough to understand that the pup wanted to see the Shield least bring it to the boy.
"Who was that mean Eye-Patch, Mama?" James asked after the two of them left the crowded area, which caused Steven to relax that he finally managed to escape the whispering and pointing fingers. Hearing his babe's words caused a chuckle to leave Steven's lips, amusement coursing through him at his son pout; as much as Steven wanted his son to enjoy himself and see the bear just like he wanted, Steven can't stay one more second with the people who kept pointing at him and shying away in fear.
"Hopefully you will know by the end of the week." Tony ended up saying, getting a proud look from Angie, as the woman took their order and promised to bring it to them shortly, even owning the place, Angie still loves to go around and take orders, Tony though, knows that the only reason Angie does that is for the gossips, for the woman knows everything that is happening in the town.
So why, after all the reasoning Anton thought of, was his Alpha furious? Ready to return to where Steven was and start a screaming match, why does Anton's Alpha growl and hiss and demand blood? Demanding that Anton find this Daniel and finish him? Was Steven not thinking of James when he decided to remarry? Did Steven remarry to give James some stability? Why…? Why? Why? Anton's mind kept repeating over and over, trying to find many answers to the questions that plagued him after the shocking sight he witnessed.
"But… but you have work today… and Papa said I'm grounded…" Peter mumbled which made Tony's lips twitch down before they twitch up in a smile, sitting instead of lying and pulling the boy in his embrace, making the boy look up at him with wide brown eyes, and Tony couldn't help himself from kissing the boy's forehead.
"This is our cue!" Tony grinned, picking up the bouquet of flowers that Serpentine arranged for him; to say that they were flowers made for a wedding would be laughable, it was more suited for a funeral in a horror movie that than; the flowers were just stalks full of thorns with a few black roses here and there with one single rose in the middle, wrapped by spider webs to keep them together.
"I used what Erskine gave me years and years ago, the Super-Soldier Serum." Howard stated, causing everyone inside the room to freeze, their breath getting stuck in their throat, unable to make any sound; the only sound in the room was Steve's pained whine and sobs of agony, making everyone blink their eyes and snap from the trance they were in.
"I am sorry for your loss sir, I may only have known him for a few days and he was a great man… We don't know each other that much, we only talked for two weeks and I asked him to drop a letter for me, so why would Dr. Erskine mention me in his will?" Steve asked in confusion as he took the papers from the older man.
"Alright, Friday, I'm sorry. You're gonna make me beg, now?" Tony joked. "Results, please. We're wasting time by pulling each other's legs. Yours are metaphoric, of course."
He would drink. He would remember. He would drink some more. He would be en-route to passing out, but still remember. He would pass out completely. He would wake up the next morning. He would remember the events of the previous night, and then traverse further back in time, deliberately inflicting upon himself a backlash of memories until it became too painful to go back any further.
"I'm just going to say it, straight shoot it. It hurts me and I'm going to have to deal with it like a head on collision. I've realised that back-alley-ing my way through problems won't get me far with this particular one. I'm going to do this for you guys, and I'm going to make it better. I promise, Pep. I promise, Rhodes. This is just temporary. I'm definite and exact and a hundred percent sure this will be the last time you'll see me like this. I'll take some time to get there, but when I do, I just hope that the two people I love most will be there by my side."
Tony'd rather have fading purple-blue-black bruises marring his face, memories of snow with a pink tinge with blood soaking through and a persisting ache somewhere in the left of his thoracic region rather than not be able to drink.
"So," Pepper tucked her legs in,  "-Happy tells me you went shopping today?" Taking a sip from the bottle, she tried to hide the quick wince at the wine's sharp taste. Offering the bottle to Tony, she reached out for a fork.
"Oh Jesus Christ!" Rhodey cursed. "Okay, you're officially losing your mind. Stop flirting with your fucking A.I. We gotta get you get laid."
Head pounding, eyes frying and insides squishing, Tony turned around the handbill. What was it still doing there? Tossing it away, he tumbled out of bed and into the shower and wondered how much he'd divulged last night. He knew it couldn't have been pretty, for sure. But then again, after having said everything (okay, maybe not everything), he felt a huge weight lift off his chest, leaving him lighthearted.
"What do I usually do for relaxing. You know, when I'm alone? When my time is just plain, old time and not money?"
Vision couldn't drink coffee. Poor bastard, didn't even know what he was missing out on. Although technically, he did know that Vision was perfectly aware of how every food was supposed to taste like, could explain the biology behind the sensation of taste and the chemistry behind why a certain edible tasted so. Gastronomy, it was all analytically stored in his brain, just like every other speck of information. Sushi. Spaghetti. Butter chicken. Crêpes. Shawarma.
It had ended up in him hooking up with one of the women at the meeting, and they'd taken an impromptu trip to Jamaica, leaving behind a trail of clues sniffed out by the media and the tabloids for the next five weeks to follow.
"That one. And that one. And-and that one too. You know what? Add two of those for good measure. I mean, why not?"
"Yes, I kinda did. For the, you know, food and stuff." Tony pointed at the array of junk food lying in front of them, while taking the bottle from Pepper's hands. Damn, the wine was sharp. The recollection of his resolution to go without alcohol for the near future hit him too late, once the wine had traversed down his throat. He felt a little disappointed in himself, which was anything but new.
Deciding to make himself coffee, Tony, stumbled inside the kitchen, welcomed by the sight of his best friend hidden behind the newspaper eating cereal, the coffee pot waiting on the counter, enticing Tony.
"Yes, Mr. Rhodes." The throat clear Friday did, made Tony want to bang his head against the walls. What in the name of Schrödinger was going on? "Boss's liaisons hadn't been taking place at par with his past rates. The average per month was dangerously falling and I'm concerned because intercourse is considered essential for the human health."
"Bingo." Tony smiled, his face alit in the golden glow of the single light above his head, casting long shadows across his cheeks and reflecting off his unnaturally long eyelashes. He didn't know it then, but he looked ethereal in that light. Something Steve would've caught on, and quickly shoved his hands in his pockets to hide the fingers that were twitching wildly to get hold of a pen, pencil, paintbrush, anything. The shadows moved as Tony pushed himself away from the desk, still seated in his chair, and scooted closer to the window, bringing himself right behind the glass. His eyes were fixated at every sight his retina could manage to produce.
Well, that genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist routine won't work here. Tony needed to assess what he could and couldn't do in order to keep traversing down the blissful path of ignorance and avoidance. He could throw on a navy Armani suit and head to SI right now but he knew that that would rob him of any chance to assess the possibilities in front him. He would be busy dealing with shareholders, PR, the media and every other organization waiting for him to crack, to give in and let them hound his ass. No. What he needed was some time to think about his options, and boy, did Tony need some time. He'd been needing it for the past six months, but had been procrastinating the requisite.
Staring at the swinging bag in front of him, Tony could feel the pain surging inside him. A tide rising and rising, with no plans to fall. Grabbing hold of the bag which was swinging forth towards Tony, he stepped backwards and glanced at himself in the mirror- sweaty, panting, and utterly defeated.
"It's my duty, Mr. Stark." Peter was probably blushing, but he still had his mask on. "Glad to be of service."
"Call the office and inform them I won't be coming in today. Give a smart, believable excuse- call in sick or something. And tell them-"
"Oh, man." Rhodey shook his head, clutching at his stomach. "That's quite the abstinence you've maintained." Bending over in uncontrollable laughter, other hand still gripping his stomach for dear life, he was totally enjoying humiliating Tony. "Man!"
"Alright then, make something up with twenty-eight point two percent generic, fourty-seven point five percent believable and twenty-four point three percent smart."
Quickly putting Tony's arm around his shoulders and grabbing him by the waist, they stumbled to the elevator, Pepper picking up Tony's jacket that had been stranded on the floor somewhere during the night. Taking Tony to his bedroom, they laid him down, as Rhodey asked Friday to lower the room's temperature and Pepper removed his shoes.
The ghostly glow of the smartphone's screen suddenly vanished from Tony's face, as he put his phone down. Sighing, he massaged his suddenly throbbing forehead, and swivelled his chair around, New York skyline suddenly splayed out in front of him through his glass window wall. Leaning back, Tony saw as the various pinpricks of light coalesced into a string of light bulbs, he could see a million vehicles going places, returning from places.
"No, can do, Mr. Stark. I would prefer sharing." Pepper laughed. She was sitting on the lounge, looking tired and regal at the same time. Her heels were scattered on the floor, her hair was loose and her eyes were weary. She was discreetly studying Tony, or what she thought was discreet anyway.
", he'd stashed a cellphone and has willed himself into never looking at it, ever again. It's been a long, long battle and Tony was worn out. To the last fibre, the last thread holding him together.
"Thanks for helping us, kid." Tony pointed at the devastation. "Things would've gotten a lot uglier if you hadn't shown up when you did."
"The man knows what he wants Tony. You've got to stop beating yourself up." Then, looking at Rhodey, she went on, "Did you know, he went shopping today?"
"Of course I do, Pep." Tony looked out at the night skyline, the lights blurring into incandescent circled in the field of his vision. "Rhodey's life has become shit because of me. Vision lost Wanda because of me. I couldn't even avenge my mother, because of me. Although I'm past that, but still, it hurts. It sucks that I keep messing things up." He took one gulp. Another- this time a big one.
"Yes,-" Pepper inwardly sighed in relief, Tony could almost hear it, "-I thought so.  So, why did you not show up today?"
Realising that he was still holding Steve’s mug, he slowly kept it aside, deciding against imparting it with the same fate. Sighing, Tony walked out of the kitchen, quietly whispering “lights” on his way out.
Rhodey finally put the paper down. "Sarcastic." Looking at Tony, he beckoned him to sit beside him. "You feelin' alright?"
"Well, I'm so sorry. Got lost there for a second." Tony picked up the cruet filled with salt and passed it over. "Here you go."
A.A Meetings worked for people who wanted to give up alcohol. Tony wasn't even sure what he wanted anymore. And what was the point of going to these meetings if you're anything but anonymous? He obviously wouldn't own up to that time when he was thirty seven and had decided to clean up his act, and had started doing things by the book. The bottle went into the dustbin, the glasses hidden in shelves, a similar meeting joined.
There was a distant ring, like alarms bells going off. Or, an approaching train- its engine whistling louder and louder and louder. Out of all the previous sightings of aforementioned enemies-of-state, this was the first time they'd risked being seen in a country which was a member of the UN- a clear supporter of the Accords. What exactly had happened in Sweden that necessitated such risk? These past six months, all Tony had done was vehemently ignore whenever there were news of sightings, telling himself like a mantra that it was over- that his ex-teammates, ex-friends' security wasn't his responsibility. That there was no path but forward, to move on and to forget.
Tony sat on the bench in the locker room, taking his head in his hands. He wondered if he'd ever get Pepper to realise that their downward spiral was all his fault, to make Rhodey realise that his condition was all on him, to make Vision realise that he couldn't be with the woman he loved because of him, to make Natasha realise that her going into hiding and them not being in contact even once in the past six months was his doing.
He could just call. Could end it immediately after, or rather, if, Steve answered, and before he could call back, Tony could very accidentally smash the phone to bits. And then lose his sanity, or whatever was left of it, over it.
Right now, though, just shovelling food down his mouth and watching the news reporter drone on and the absence of his past companions who'd share in this mundane task with him prick with much, much lesser intensity at his heart, Tony was content.
This was exactly the problem. Pepper cared too much. So much that the thought of losing Tony would put her heart to a halt. It wasn't just to let her deal with every bad news that accompanied a mission, big or small. Tony couldn't allow it, it would've been too selfish of him. He was about to apologize to her, when she made him love her once again, reminding him just what irreplaceable value she held in his life.
-Of course. He hadn't drunk anything last night. He'd been so busy thinking about getting out of this- this whatever it was, that he hadn't even realised when his brain had given up and lulled him into sleeping. No wonder this fine morning his vision wasn't hazy, his breath wasn't reeking and his brain wasn't numb. It was active, participating and prompt. Consequently, he remembered the reason behind it- he needed a plan of action.
"Yeah, no, the repulsor in the left leg is busted. The suit probably needs immediate attention what with the number of times it's been flung into buildings and drenched in alien saliva in the past four hours. Anyways, I can't fly back without having to listen to Friday give sermons about my troubling affinity for recklessness at least five hundred times, so I've got to get a car and face the onslaught of everyday traffic."
"Oh man,-" Rhodey gave an exasperated eye roll, his face alight with a splitting grin. "You had to make it weird. Sure, sure. Husbuddies for life." He went back to his cereal, still smiling with the satisfaction of knocking his friend's brain back into place.
"No, she's smarter. If you were actually feeling under the weather, it would've taken me 2 minutes, and not hours to recognize that you were skipping work. I'm your emergency contact, in case you needed a reminder."
Tony had simply written- "I feel like I've seen red and golden around somewhere else too. You are more original than that, I have faith in you".
Remembering something, Tony stood up, decisive, and walked over to a large, wooden shelf that stood in the corner. Removing a few books, he punched in the keypad to open a secret alcove in the wall, revealing his stash of some of the most expensive bottles of alcohol. Two empty glasses were sitting there too. He'd had it come in handy when a companion would be there with him in his office, right about before they'd proceed to have hungry, impatient sex. Pepper and him had shared another bottle when she'd been made C.E.O. Tony tried not to think much of that day, or rather, two in the night.
"Come on, off with it." Tony sighed, as he scrambled to sit at the feet of the lounge on the floor, leaning against it's edge. "You know you can ask me anything, right?"
Coming to him, Tony was a straight-from-the-coffee-pot kinda guy. No mugs for this one, no sir. Everyone knew better than to have their coffee after Tony entered the kitchen, barely opened eyes zeroing in on the coffee pot waiting on the counter. Chances were, besides a few dregs of coffee mixed with saliva at the rim, luck didn't have much in store for someone in line for coffee after Tony Stark. His haphazard lifestyle rarely dictated time for such trivial civility, and he made up for that with extravagance in other things- both external and internal.
"Exactly. Although I'm sure I'm a hundred percent, I never doubted our friendship." Rhodey finally subsided, his features calming down. Tony was staring at his best friend, his eyes wide open and a relieved smile playing on his lips. Of course, this was Rhodey, the bravest and one of the most important people in Tony's life. He'd always have his back. They'd always have each other's back. Their friendship was forged with iron.
He truly was a man who had everything in the world, and nothing. Sometimes, he felt like giving his brain up too, with the rest of the things he cared about.
She gave another adorable blush, the flattering kind. If Tony had been seventeen, he'd totally be into her. But unfortunately, life was a bitch and his own was the queen of all bitches. He was old, he didn't know how to cook, and he was having problems with his libido that he hadn't discussed with anyone yet. Tony's defense reflexes kicked in like a shot of morphine up an addict's veins.
There was a red, white and blue coffee mug sitting right between the mundane pile of clean dishes. It was larger than regular coffee mugs- striped with the aforementioned colors in reverse of the aforementioned order, stars clumsily engraved in it to prevent it from looking less like an almost-French flag. Which was exactly where it was from, when Tony had decided to keep a souvenir from a memorable night he'd spent with a French barista in Paris god-knows-how-many years back.
His eyes widened. It wasn't the table that Steve's hand was hovering above, no. It was Tony's own right hand which was resting on the table, the other raised in his signature peace gesture. It was obvious, Steve's hand was very close to Tony's, but yet, there hadn't been any contact, else Tony would've remembered it. If Steve had lowered his palm even by half an inch, it would've almost seemed as if he were holding Tony's hand.
Suddenly, the reporter paused and leaned away from the camera, listening carefully to her earpiece. After a moment, she looked straight into the camera, her eyes piercing and her expression grave-
He backed Vision as he threw heavy rubble at the three extra terrestrials, when one of them opened its mouth, wide enough for Tony to see some of the grossest stuff in the universe which he could've gone by fine without seeing. He knew what the reptile was going to do, and was already getting ready to fly away from where he was hovering, when suddenly, someone shot a web from behind him, which clamped the alien's mouth shut immediately.
Tony took the spot beside Rhodey on the couch while Pepper offered another plate of Mac 'n' Cheese, "It was wonderful, alright. There were these brilliant scientists and doctors with their own inventions and progress reports and everything. But none of them can match what you do, Stank." He looked at Tony, eyes brimming with ingenuity. "You gotta stop feeling this overwhelming sense of responsibility or guilt or whatever you wanna call it, alright? This-" He pointed at his prosthetic leg stretched out on front of him, "-works amazingly."
"The worst part is, and I realised it not more than twenty four hours ago- even alcohol has stopped working. That's why I was sober today." Tony's brain was starting to get woozy. A telltale sign that sleep was going to take over, that passing out was inevitable. He needed to be quick. "I'm fully aware of how inconsequential my sorry is, but I don't have the strength anymore. And it sucks. It sucks because I lost my family, I lost the Avengers. Pepper, you were so right about me. They do matter to me. Not more than you, never. But they matter more to me than I do to myself. You all do. And maybe that's why, I'm still haunted.... And that- that fucking Rogers."
"This. That. Sure. But, guilt? What about guilt?" Pepper's eyes grew a little stormy. She held out the bottle in front of him, dangerously near his head. Tony took it from her hands, thinking if he should be careful with his next words. "You have nothing to be guilty about, alright Tony?"
About five minutes, or was it fifteen? He hadn't heard them call his name multiple times, before Rhodey pointedat the bottle limply hanging beside Tony.
"Well, I thought straight from the bottle would be better. Instead of a glass, can I interest you in a whole bottle, Miss Potts?"
"Will you stop saying that word? Tony, you did nothing. And moreover,-" Rhodey turned to face Tony, "-I'd never friendivorce you. You know that right?"
"We've just had correspondence with our sources back at DC and there seems to be some urgent news. Not twelve hours ago, a terrifying accident took place in a rural town of Sweden. Apparently, a large explosion took place at the Biomedical and Research Division building of a private Swedish pharmaceutical company that broke into a massive fire. Due to heavy snow, the employees were given a two week long leave, eliminating chances of multiple fatalities. The destruction caused to the building required assistance from government authorities and the debris is still being cleared, with no dead bodies having been discovered yet. Speculations put current enemies of state and former Avengers, Captain Steve Rogers and his group of outlawed vigilantes as the reason behind this mishap, who were spotted fleeing Stockholm by the authorities last week." Tony's brain feigned ignorance of that information. "It is still unclear what exactly happened and a thorough investigation will be conducted by the local and international authorities. Meanwhile, we've got live recorded footage from a CCTV camera. Before playing it, we'd like to advise viewer discretion."
"I'm sick of you blaming yourself! Look, you gotta stop being such a pussy and start winning at life like my best friend, the genius-billionaire-ex playboy-philanthropist Tony Stark did. I know it's hard, but it is for all of us. That doesn't mean you can put it all on you because man, in case you need a reminder, we're all friends here. Me. Pepper. Vision. Happy. Friday."
, because one thing which he would always be sure of, surer than life itself, is that the people he's been trying to forget these past months were at their core, good people. The inherent goodness in them, stemming from their own lives which was, in one way or the other, full of hardships and sacrifices. It would have to have been something serious, bigger than the Accords, bigger than their...their disagreement, that drove Steve and the rest to take such a huge risk.
Tony just gave them a lazy smile, as everything around him dulled- first gradually, then all at once.
And the problem was exactly this- Tony wasn’t forgetting. He couldn’t forget the steely, unmoving eyes, the insurmountable pressure on his reactor, the hammering sound of his skyrocketing pulse and most of all, the cold, cold dread he was filled with, no matter how much, how far, how long he tried to drown it in alcohol.
He needed to do something that would take his mind off of all these issues that had been piling up on his mental peace. He needed to indulge in something normal. Something which would make him feel useful, but commonplace at the very same time. And Rhodey could always look after the remaining Avengers with Vision assisting him in managing the whole team.
Needless to say, the lines on his forehead grew deeper and deeper every time he restarted his journey of walking the whole four feet, and finally, after fourteen heartbreaking tries, Rhodey gave up. There were tears of frustration threatening to well up in his eyes, and his chest was heaving with the labour of an unimaginably intensive workout, but Tony just sat there, on the bench, staring hopelessly at his best friend.
"Indeed I'm Tony but how you-"  He started questioning but was soon cut by his father " Yes Steve is the Captain it's a long story and you were late so now it's time to eat!"
Steve thinks for a moment and then he offers " Okay then come live with me and you can make some blueprints for the company. Huh what do you say? I know that you're a genius you have great ideas it'd be really beneficial for us to have you in our team. "
Despite all his insecurities the teen decided to risk it. There wasn't much he could do anyway since he quitted his job and had no way to pay his rent.
"I doubt it but if he doesn't want to see you you should respect his decision. Anyway you'll never know if you don't talk to him.  It's 7 PM go to that cafe he works at and find him I'll tell everyone something came up. "
They get out of the restaurant together. It's cold outside and it's started raining. Steve notices that Tony wears nothing but the red t-shirt. "Aren't you freezing? " The boy just shrugs and keeps walking " I've had worse" "You'll get sick that's why people wear coats and jackets when it's cold"the blond insists.
Just before he turns in the corner he hears Rogers swearing. Tony always cares about the others. It was a promise he made to himself when he managed to rent the apartment. He'll always help whoever needs help. So he looks back and says loud enough for Steve to hear him " Hey Rogers you can of course come to mine to spend the night " He waits a little and as he's about to leave the older man comes slowly " Thank you kid I owe you " " Since I know your name without you wanting me to I'll tell you mine... I am Tony" " Well nice to meet you Tony and again thank you " " Pleasure all mine and don't be so grateful as soon as you see the place you'll freak out".
"What are you talking about? How could you even know of my existence? How are you even alive? This is all very confusing and I'm a genius" the teen argued.
I never thought I would actually post it and when I did I was sure that no one will ever see it. But you did and I'm grateful
"Hey lay back down I'll go. It's probably Nat and Clint. They said they'll swing by after their shift ends."
The man has the softest blond hair and even though he wears sunglasses Tony knows that he also has the most beautiful ocean eyes. " Oh god Steve what are you doing here!? "
It turns out he doesn't have to wait for long. An hour later the older man enters the workshop and heads to the office without acknowledging the boy.
Steve Rogers doesn't know the way the world works. Ever since the day he was born he never had to do anything. So he doesn't know how the little guy fights to survive.
"Clint! It's not like that I barely know him and I'm sure as hell he did it of pity. I mean he saw where I live and... "
They go to the counter and Steve gets out his wallet with a raise eyebrow in question. " Oh right that has to be like 100$." Steve takes out 150$ " You keep the rest " " Oh thank you. " So... Tony you got a break or something? " " Actually I finished here I'll close and then walk to the cafe " "Okay what about going to grab something to eat with me and I drive you there? " " What you mean like now? " " Sure why not? "
He had been down in the lab with Dr. Banner, experimenting with the elements and learning more through action than anything. Things got fuzzy and difficult to remember after they passed gallium though, it had become harder and harder to force his eyes to stay open, begging the doctor for just a few more minutes. He had to have fallen asleep in the lab… so how was he in his room now?
He slipped his tunic back on, turning to face this team once more. Leaving his cloak crumpled upon the floor and ignoring the cold as best as he could, “That proof enough for you?”
“But not everyone finds them. It’s difficult, they could live far away, not love you or already be dead. You could meet them and hate each other. So many things could go wrong, but it’s all worth it if you genuinely love each other. Soulmarks are the most common way of finding who your match is, find the mark, find them. What our dear friends and you, I presume, are suffering from is shared pain.” he paused to wave at the other 3, “The closer you are to your soulmate, the more apparent their injuries will be on your body. All of their mates recover quickly from their injuries and what could kill them doesn’t, but the pain can be too much.”
“Just a moment, I understand that you’re curious but I have a feeling it would be better for you to start small and work your way up. First, let’s get you settled in,” He led them down an impersonal hall, held a card up to a light on the side of the door which opened with a rush of cool air.
“No, you will face the team first.” His imposing counterpart said in what was probably supposed to be a nice tone. Tony squirmed in the hold as they approached one of the larger wooden cabin-like, the lack of people inside the gates feeding the part of his brain that was screaming about impending doom. The doors opened as they approached, two guards greeting the blonde in another language, the three talking for a moment before one guard left in the direction of the gate and the other led them down a short hallway, opening another set of double doors. The large man gestured for Tony to enter first, then closing the door behind them. Inside was a large rectangular table, surrounded by muscular men and women alike, all of whom looked downright terrifying, covered in different colored paints and armor. His escort stepped before them and announced something, everyone turned to look at him and spotted Tony, setting down their weapons and standing up in their place.
That honesty gained him some raised eyebrows, hand signals exchanged between a man dressed in a garish purple leather and two other members catching his eye, the purple man wiggling his fingers playfully when he catches him staring. He leans to his left and whispers something to metal arm guy next to him, whose stony exterior slips, contorting in an attempt to not laugh. The lantern lights reflect off the metal arm as the man’s shoulders begin to shake, hiding his face with one hand and shoving his companions shoulder with the other. A woman with long red braided hair to their right rolls her eyes and leans forward when the question and answer game resumes, eyes focusing on Tony sharply… too close to investigative for his comfort.
A man sat directly across from the entrance, long braided blonde hair and shaved sides gives Lightning Bolt a ‘what the fuck’ look and calls someone from a neighboring room to him, whispering into their ear and sending them off just as quickly as they arrived. Purple man watched the metal mans hands next to him gesture wildly, barking out a laugh as soon as they stilled and was rewarded with metal slapped over his mouth and a firm shake of his head. The man who had spoken before shot a glare in their direction and swept his cloak back slightly to move past his comrades, Tony’s throat clicked dry at the sight. Tony could already tell he was large but when the man’s cloak shifted back to reveal the rest of his body… he was absolutely ripped.
Without knowing what else to do to keep a conversation Steve tries to take in his surroundings. They have left behind them the cafe and they've entered a poor neighborhood. There're only old buildings which Steve is surprised that they even stand.
It's kinda scary. Specially for Steve who has spent his entire life caring only for himself. Sure he loved Bucky but not like this. This is new, different.
Two hours pass until the little bell on the door rings. Tony sighs as he puts the laptop away and stands up with a smile ready to service the costumer " Good morning how can I..." He stars saying but he freezes as soon as he lays eyes on the newcomer.
He finally talks " Omg Tony! You don't have to thank me for anything. I did what I had to do because I...oh fuck you don't even know how happy I am right now. Tony I love you and I can't imagine what could happen if you still wanted to die. Oh god I love you so much. "
It's late in the afternoon and Tony is alone at the cafe. His boss had asked him that morning if it was okay with him and of course Tony assured him it was fine. And it really was. It wasn't like he had anything better to do he hadn't enough to pay for Wi-Fi this month so he couldn't attend his courses.
"I'm glad you want to be with me right now. Don't worry doll everything will be alright." Steve says.
" What!? No! Of course I can look at it! " says Tony offended. " Okay then will you come... " " Yeah sure just a minute. "
Tony stares surprised " Would you trust me for this? I mean I haven't even graduated from high school. "
"Rhodey!! I can't believe it's you! I didn't even know you got my letter! Omg I missed you so so much! "
"People wear coats huh? You think everyone can afford that? There're people who don't even have a roof over their heads did you know that? " As Tony talks Steve can't help the feeling of shame how could he be so stupid he's seen the boy's apartment!
I was walking to my locker when I heard a voice behind me "Hey Stark" I wasn't in a mood to face anyone right now but then they called me again so I stopped.
"I don't know. I also have nothing to wear... I mean what if he wants to go to one of those fancy places? The most appropriate outfit I have is a t-shirt without holes... "
He walked in casually looking around but before he could go any further than the entrance he was stopped by a well built man. Well not as well built as him but still he was a super soldier after all.
So I surprised myself by updating. I really don't know how I found the time to write an other chapter. I swear my mom wants to kill me. She made me do all the maths and physics homework my teachers send during quarantine in two days and threatened to take my phone otherwise! Anyway I hope you like it!
He gets in and heads to the counter. There stands a redhead teen girl making coffee for a guy. He looks around but there's no sign of Tony. Just before he gives up and storm out the girl turns to him.
He drives the short distance to the workshop Tony works in silence thinking of the short brunet and their kiss last night and how bad he wants to hold him every single night and never let him get hurt ever again.
Sorry I didn't update last week I had no inspiration. I probably update again before the next weekend. So how's everything with corona virus and everything? I want to go back to school I'm so bored:-(
I know that I do. I know it for a while. I know that he's not stable and I may end up hurt but I can't help it. I love him.
As it turned out returning the stones wasn't as hard as he expected. It was quite simple really. The hardest part was saying goodbye to everyone,Bruce, Clint,Sam and of course Bucky, knowing that he wouldn't see them for a long long time. He already knew that there was no way he would come back immediately after the job was done. He belonged in the past.
Steve takes out his phone and check his messages while Tony sits in a corner with a book and a notebook on his lap. A couple of hours pass like that when the blond decides to start a new conversation. He picks up his gaze from the screen only to see that the teen has fallen asleep. His eyes soften and he lifts softly the boy and put him on bed.
She nods in approval " I was planning on going by to make sure he's alright but in this case I think I can depend on you ? "
Hey! I'm sure I owe you a huge apology. It's been over two months since the last update guys I'm  so so so so sorry. Also an extra apology for this chapter. I wrote half of it half an hour after I woke up during an online class and the second half at night after long day.
He had asked to be the one to return the stones in the past. He didn't know what he'd do, what he was thinking. He just knew that there was nothing holding him in this present anymore. How could he keep going without Tony? He couldn't.
"I'd love to" Tony smiles and before he can add anything Steve pecks his cheek and whispers " Goodnight doll I'll dream of you tonight " And with that he turns around and leaves Tony staring at the empty hallway.
Tony believes he's alone. Maybe he was but not anymore. I want him to know that I am here for him. I want him to know that I'll do anything for him. I want him to know that he can count on me. I want him to know that I love him.
" So Steve I have to find a nickname for you. I'm the nickname king you can't have one for me if I don't have one for you! "
As he's ready to lock he hears steps behind him. He turns around and comes face to face with the blond man from the afternoon. " Oh hey have you forgotten anything sir? " He asks. " I don't know I can't find my keys and I thought that they may be here " The man answers and Tony realizes who he is " Oh dear god you're Steve Rogers! " The man looks confused for a moment and then he just nods. " Okay come in and let's see if you can find your keys. "
Steve doesn't let his worrisome show until he's out of the place and can't feel Natasha's intense eyes on him. What if Tony isn't alright? What if he needs medical care?
" I don't know things were tensed when we parted. I hope to... " the teen sighs. "Oh I have a costumer. " And like that Tony goes to take the woman's order and the topic changes.
They're at the end of the second movie and as Steve's ready to click play on the third he notices that the teen's fast asleep in his arms.
"I can't believe this kid! Can he never be where he's supposed to be in time?" Howard complained loudly.
The walls are plain white and over the bed hangs a photo of a young boy with fluffy brown hair and big innocent honey brown eyes. The boy is smiling wide  at an older man while a woman's trying to convince him to wear his jacket. It's cute. Something Steve never had.
During the dinner Steve felt extremely overwhelmed sitting next to Howard with Tony just across the table. As soon as it was over he excused himself to the bathroom to get some space.
They keep talking for a while but then Tony  remembers that he has to go to work. " Oh shit my shift begins in ten minutes " "Okay let's go" Steve stands up after Tony and puts on his coat. "Hey you don't have to come with me it's a block away I can walk."  "No no no it's not a problem. " " Fine."
"But how? I won't make enough money to keep my apartment I will end up in the streets again" Tony says desperation clear in his voice.
He gets out and finds Steve. " I'm ready let's go "he says and the other man takes his eyes off of the screen of his phone. "Excellent do you have any preferences or I choose the place? " "I don't know Steve I only eat McDonald's or tomato soup in can we can go wherever you like. " " Okay how Italian sounds?"
He looks away from the note and sighs. What should he do now? Can he give his heart away like that or should he just leave? No, no he can't leave. The thought of leaving Tony and breaking his heart has the blond going mad. He can't do that.
"Mr.Barnes I was just trying to explain to this boy that he can't see Mr. Rogers without an appointment. " The receptionist answers.
"This guy worked in the workshop...you know the one who let me spend the night in his apartment that day... "
The man takes a step back and now Tony would've recognised him anywhere even though the last time that he saw him was almost 4 years and he has much larger now.
He opens the laptop and he can't help thinking of how lucky he is. Both of his bosses are understanding and don't get mad when he studies while he's working and his landlord even bought him a laptop.
He glares at me surprised but quickly he looks back to Howard. " I am really sorry I didn't mean to interrupt I was going to my room. " He says. I can say he is scared.
"No! That's not what I meant sweetheart. I don't regret anything! Actually no... I regret not doing it earlier. " The boy blushes a little at the pet name.
I can't say I am not used to this. It happens almost every day. Everyone in this school believes that I am a spoil rich boy who has everything he wants. Okay I understand their thoughts but no one ever tried to get to know me they just assume.
"You're lucky. Maybe it doesn't seem like it but you're really lucky you've got friends that care for you. Most of the people I hung out with are rich spoiled brats I guess I'm one too but we're not really friends. "
They choose a table in the back of the store next to the window and order a pizza (Margherita if you wonder because no matter what it's the best!) and they start talking.
After leaving the workshop early Tony has some time before his shift in the cafe starts. He walks around the streets trying to sort out his thoughts.
“Now you tell us why you are here,” Lightning bolt guy says, “And why you felt the need to break in.”
Tony’s wide eyes tracked the man as he crossed his chair again, pulling back when that maniacal smile turned his way. Something was seriously wrong with his uncle.
Bruce eyed the red in his cheeks and gave him an understanding smile, “Being comfortable isn’t a sign of weakness, Tony. I can’t remember sleeping as well as I do with Thor, ever in my life.”
Obie’s smile stretched across his face, all teeth but with genuine excitement in his eyes, “Excellent, my boy. Glad you’re finally seeing things my way. But,” his smile turned twisted, “I’m not sure your friend has the same sentiments.”
“Shit guys, what the hell happened out there?” Clint was the first to speak up once they were all in the infirmary, skimming his hands over Bucky and swearing at the amount of exposed skin peeking through the armor on his torso. A pair of hands grabbed his own, holding fast and mimicking deep breaths until they were both calmed down significantly, the soldier brought their hands up to his face and pressed his face against them, letting go with a small kiss.
Steve sighs softly and picks him up. He takes him to his bedroom. He puts him slowly on the bed and pulls a blanket over him before laying down himself. As he looks at the boy he can't help it but whisper
"But you did. I found the files. " His voice comes out calm and cold despite his freaking out inside. He wants to take it all back and beg Obie to forget the conversation but the words won't come out.
"Well maybe I don't know! Anyway I took him for lunch and I messed up he probably doesn't want to see me again. "
It had been a couple of months that he lived there and he was assigned to help in the kitchen. He himself knew how to cook pretty good. But his partner didn't. When he accidentally burned the food he ran away and left Tony alone to deal with it.
"Hey Tones! You look beautiful. Oh those are for you! " He gives the younger boy the bouquet of red roses he's holding.
Your comments always made my day. It was so nice to see that people are actually reading this story and like it.
"Yeah... " The teen murmurs hesitantly " Well... Lately I had some problems with my boss in the workshop. You see he did some illegal shit and I'd told him he had to tell me if he wants to keep doing it because I could get in trouble, you know "he starts.
"Welcome to my house!" Howard said as he unlocked the front door of the huge mansion. "I think my wife and son are  somewhere around. They'll be happy to meet you."
For tonight Steve hasn't any plans. He just wants to take Tony to his place and hold him. He finds the boy waiting outside dressed in a simple green t-shirt and old jeans.
He also found a place to work and make some money. He made a deal with his boss to give him less money in return for a meal and a shower. He learned how to survive out there in the winter and take care of himself. Sometimes he felt despaired but when he remembered his life in the foster he was grateful for his little corner.
We walk in and I realize that I don't even know his name. "Oh btw what's your name? " " I...ugh... I am Tony" He says hesitantly. " I am Steve" I tell him " I am going to the bathroom for a second will you be okay? " I ask. "Yeah sure".
They talked for hours till finally Howard believed him and all of his questions were answered but after that he didn't even hesitate to invite Steve to stay at his house as long as he needed.
He moved to his family house and try to seem responsible and able of being the CEO of maybe the most successful business of US. He didn't make it. People adored him and look up to him but he was only a public image. He couldn't run a business let alone make the difference.
"P-please Steve, a chance is all I am asking…" Tony's voice cracked as he said that, putting the cup down, making Steve close his eyes at that. "A chance to be in your and Peter's life once more, please Steve, this is all I am asking for… if you hate it after that… if you want me gone after that I will, I will go away and never return… just please." Tony plea with Steve hoping that the Omega will give him a chance, hoping that his father didn't destroy his only chance at happiness because of his bitterness, hoping that Steve wouldn't judge him and kick him out for Howard's actions.
"So you don't mind me loving him too, right?" Steve pressed on a little, which only got him blink from the boy and a little pause before Peter shook his head and whispered 'It's good', which made Steve wonder if Peter knows what he is going to ask. "So, I am hoping that you wouldn't mind if I married Tony, if I do that then he will be your Mama, but only if you want…" Steve explained gently, becoming concerned when Peter did nothing but frown and look away like he was in deep thoughts. "You don't want me to marry Tony, is that it, Pete?" Steve asked, wondering why Peter will become quiet and still at the idea of Tony being his other parent when Peter himself love Tony to the moon and back.
