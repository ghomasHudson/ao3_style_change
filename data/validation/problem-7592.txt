He looked sad. Captain America, the just and righteous and mighty and powerful, the peak of human perfection actually looked sad.
Steve reached for Tony’s hand and took the box. He opened it and took the ring in his hand. Tony on cue, extended his hand out to Steve who so carefully placed the ring on his finger. They smiled.
Steve paused and looked up to face Tony. “Yes, my knight in shining armour?”
Once he’d found it, he switched the rough fabric of the sheet around his shoulders for the soft caress of the red silk robe and secured it around his waist. All that remained now, was finding his missing bed partner.
His smile, his perfectly manicured hands, the way he moved, the way he spoke, the way his eyes travelled a thousand years into the future when he got an idea, even the way he overworked himself to come up with the prototype for his ingenious new idea.
Steve kissed Tony's belly over his black tank. Tony shivered. Steve moved a smidge up and kissed just above his husband's belly button, holding in the monsoon of emotions that threatened to expose itself and ruin the moment if Steve were to cry.
Steve’s face shifts a couple of times before he speaks. “Tony..” He says again. “I’m right here baby.” Tony nuzzles into Steve’s neck, feeling the cool metal of his chain. “I’m listening, sweetheart.” Steve shifts so he’s lying on his side, facing Tony but still granting him access to his neck. “I did something wrong.’ Steve confesses. “I love you Tony, I do.” He shuts his eyes, biting down on his back teeth. “I kissed him and now I can’t shake him out of my head.” Tony cups Steve’s face in both hands and presses his forehead to his. “You told me baby. I’m not mad. It’s okay.” He smiles genuinely, brushing his fingers under Steve’s eyes so he’d open them. “I love you and I know that you love me. It’s okay.”
"I'm so sorry Steve. I wish you the best of luck. And I love you so much, so much more than I'll ever be able to tell you. But it's time. When I drift off, I will dream about you. It's always you."
He spent hours in the bathroom. He scrubbed his skin raw and he still couldn't get the flecks of blood and dust off it. He hadn't even bothered with cleaning his uniform, just discarded it in the corner of the bathroom behind the door. He made some progress and eventually willed himself to part with the comfort of the hot water.
As the storm brewed on and the night began to fade away to dawn, they carried on unaware of their surroundings. Behind them on the balcony, the wind picked up further as the rain descended with more vigor and washed away the contents of the fallen coffee cup and Steve’s forgotten plan of starting his day early.
Steve shook his head. “I doubt it. He looked in a hurry from the way he took off so quickly.”
That was strange. Why wasn't Tony yelling at him? "You're not upset?"
He hugged him back, pressing kisses to his shoulder and cheek and temple.
Indeed, as the wind blew by them, it carried more chilled drops of rain. Tony adjusted the robe back to cover his shoulder and leaned his head against Steve’s warm chest to shield himself from the elements.
Steve smiled in return not to be rude. He was just in another place now that involved Tony being in the workshop when he got back from his mission. He never even left and he was already worrying about Tony. Clint didn't need to know that. Not that Steve felt like he could talk anyway so his smile sufficed. He did need to thank Clint for what he did for Jack though.
Steve loosened Tony’s tie. “Why can’t we both use it? Share it.”
So in deep into the bottom of his heart did he hide those feelings because what they had was good. Jack was the perfect son and Cap and Stark were happy if the kisses Clint caught sight of were any indication, especially before missions. He wouldn't ruin that for his own selfish reasons.
"I did. He also came to talk to me while you were sleeping." Tony shared willingly.
"I couldn't be myself. You said it yourself, there's a strange pattern."
"What do you want me to do baby?" Steve asked him, brilliant blue eyes gone mostly dark boring into honey ones similarly consumed.
Clint's mind was blank, what could he possibly say to that? He couldn’t admit how jealous of Stark he was or just how much sense it made now that Steve’s explained it.
"Guess it was just a nightmare." Steve kept his answer brief because he didn’t feel comfortable discussing his PTSD with anyone besides Tony.
He pushed his knees up to his chest as much as he was able and hugged Tony's helmet close to his chest. Even in his farewell message, his voice was soothing, and Steve could not decide whether Tony was soothing himself or Steve. He hugged the helmet closer, desperately wanting it to be Tony. He wanted to be able to comfort him from whatever was bothering him, curl up behind him and trace the veins of his forearm and tell him that whatever it is, they can face it together.
After a while of thinking and coming up with the same conclusion, Steve picked up his bag with his wet uniform inside and exited the jet to a barrage of bright lights.
No, Steve could not sleep in his bed.
Tony wipes away a couple of fresh tears and tilts his head up, connecting his lips to Steve’s. Steve kisses him softly, fervently,  surrendering himself to Tony’s lips. New tears streak his cheeks, but he can’t bring himself to care. He kisses Tony deeper yet very gentle, letting Tony lead him. Tony kisses him again and again, tangling his fingers in his blond hair, never wanting to let his lips miss a single brush of Steve’s. Steve pulls back, pain colouring his eyes. “I’m sorry..” He apologizes to Tony’s lips. “Sshhh.” Tony orders, capturing Steve’s lips again.
Steve pressed forward and kissed him, long enough to leave his lungs aching for a breath.
“I just need another minute, Tony. Promise.”
Steve looked even more hurt now. Good job Tony.
Steve was dressed in a blue suit, a few shades darker than Tony’s own. But where Tony’s suit sat perfectly tailored on him, Steve’s hugged the curves of his muscles obscenely. Not to mention the perfectly coiffed blonde hair contrasting with the most beautiful blue eyes. He was a sight.
The way he'd kissed him when he'd said yes.
Steve stared at his reflection and smiled to himself. He was so lucky to call this man his.
Steve laughed but it sounded more like a gasp.
Steve reached lower to pepper kisses against Tony’s collar bone, making Tony lean back over the railing and exposing more of himself to the night air. As the breeze suddenly picked up, it carried the raindrops across his face. “Oh Steve. Hang on.”
His scent, the smirk he only directed Steve's way, the way he got what he wanted every time. His arms around him, the look over his shoulder with narrowed eyes that spoke volumes, the way he waited for Steve, the way he blushed when he was sincere.
Tony arched his back for him and Steve interrupted his line of kisses to Tony's neck to press a soft kiss to the center of his chest. Tony's heart plummeted through his ribcage and he took hold of Steve's cheeks and kissed him to convey what his words were failing him to do.
He kissed what little skin was visible above the collar of Steve’s suit.
Tony kissed his cheek and Steve kissed his forehead. "I'll make it up to you kiddo. I promise." Tony smiled, lifting Jack from Steve's arms along with a few teddy bears.
Steve leaned back against him. "Are nothing compared to what you do to me." Steve finished his sentence.
Despite himself, as he stripped out of his office outfit, he felt butterflies in his stomach like he did three years ago when they’d agreed to go on their first date. Fresh off snapping his fingers and ridding the world of Thanos and his army, he understood then why he felt nervous. Now it didn’t make much sense.
Steve shifted and got off the bed, checking his watch.
Steve’s cheeks blushed. “Why can’t Steve Stark use it?” He whispered.
"I will play with Jackie you adorable puppy." Tony cooed, rubbing his nose in Jack's hair.
Tony scoffed at Steve’s comment. “As if. Only the highest standards here.”
Steve twisted his hand for the first time and Tony gasped loudly, doubling over Steve and holding him tightly as his chest heaved.
"I can't. I want to make Clint turn the jet around so I can come back to you." Steve’s voice cracked and he cleared his throat.
Steve woke up in his bed, surrounded by the scent of home and unsurprisingly, many teddy bears. He was probably crushing a few of them with his bulk.
“Bucky!” He calls loudly to wake the lazy soldier. “Bucky! Get up!” Bucky groans under the blanket and tosses to face away from Clint. “Wake up. It’s late. Come on!” Clint climbs up on the bed and hits him with a pillow. “Noo. Stop that!” Bucky complains, pulling the blanket tighter above his head. Clint rolls his eyes. “I made tea and coffee.” He bribes, hitting his boyfriend again. “Together? That’s gross. Bucky mumbles, voice quieted by the pillow he buried his face in. "No, not together! Get up!” He smacks him with the pillow over his head.
Tony’s playful smirk painted his face. “Mr. Rogers. You are planning on doing things to me.”
He turned Clint's hands over in his then threaded their fingers together.
He set about sketching Jackie hugging his Cap bear on Tony's chest the way Tony described to him. He hadn't gotten far when Clint came over and sat on an upturned tree's trunk opposite him.
Tony shook his head because there wasn't a word worthy enough to describe Steve. His Steve. He leaned forward and captured his lips gently.
"I called you like I promised. But you were napping you lazy bear." Steve smiled to himself. "I missed you precious one." He mumbled, pressing a kiss to Jackie's forehead.
Steve checked his watch then looked at his bag again.
"You're tired baby, why are you still up?" Yeah good one genius. You're the one who hasn't slept properly in who knows how long. He took another step towards Steve and now they were only inches apart, Tony smelling Steve's signature vintage aftershave. He cupped his cheek with his right hand until Steve met his eyes.
"All right JARVIS, save project MK 53. I'm going to take a shower and then sleep for about a week so don't let anyone disturb me."
Tony pulled back from Steve's embrace and gestured at himself with both hands. "We're going out to celebrate me wanting and working on being a better husband and father." Tony explained cheerfully before pressing a kiss to his husband's lips and getting up to the closet.
Steve, who is a saint; who always knew the right thing to say at the appropriate time. Steve who could comfort him by tracing the veins of his forearm up from his wrist to his elbow and make a warm shudder run up his spine. Steve whose kisses melted away all the hurt Tony ever felt, and whose hugs could turn ice warm.
Once he was standing a foot apart from Steve, he closed the small distance between them and wrapped his arms around him. “Hi.”
It's all Steve can think and he wished that he could stop thinking for a fraction of a second. He lost, they lost. They're all gone. T'Challa, Sam, Bucky. God, Bucky. How cruel was the universe he lived in that he had to lose his best friend over and over and over again?
“Steve.” Tony called out in the silent room.
"I see you kissing sometimes and you couldn't be happier, the both of you. But other times, it's like you're strangers." He reached out and tilted Steve's face to face him. "I just want to make sense of it because I hate seeing you hurt."
Steve withdrew his lips and took Tony's face in both hands before leaning his forehead against Tony’s.
Steve and Tony laid side by side on the bed, a sheet covering their heated bodies. Steve had his eyes closed, a smile painted on his lips, and Tony couldn’t stop examining the ring that fit so perfectly around his finger.
"I'm sorry. I can't stop thinking about you." Steve whispered, mindful of Clint.
Yeah, that was definitely fear. But why? Steve was just sleeping.
Steve flinched automatically but was careful not to drop the helmet as it began scanning him. His eyebrows knit together just the voice of Tony's AI sounded. "Match confirmed. Captain Steven Rogers. There's a message for you from Tony Stark."
Steve set the cup gently back on the railing. “It doesn’t have to be the start of your day. Go back to bed. Rest. Resume that beauty sleep of yours.”
"Why baby? You know we don't go out without a jacket. And you know not to go without either Adad or Papa, and definitely not at night." Tony worried. He just couldn't ever bear the thought of something happening to his Jackie.
Steve's smile widened and as if on cue, little drops of rain began battering the jet's windshield. "I think you're right."
Steve stared into Clint’s eyes, his own rimmed red that couldn't be noticed unless this close. "I can't be me without him."
"That sounds beautiful."
Clint smirked as he checked the small hideout for any remaining children. The image was too funny.
Steve knew that tone anywhere. It was Tony opening up a sensitive subject then deciding better of it. He could play along. After all, discussing why they couldn't sleep was a discussion that they couldn’t have over the phone.
Steve tried to free one hand but Tony shook his head and grasped Steve’s hand tighter, bringing it to his lips and kissing the back of it.
No less confused, Tony took Steve’s offered arm and followed him out of the restaurant and back into the hotel lobby. “What are we doing here?”
"Cause obviously this mission is just like drinking water. In and out, no muss no fuss. You are Captain America after all. The whole mission is basically just a waiting game. It's boring actually, waiting for the sickos to come out and direct the kids where to go with the drugs." Clint went on comfortably. Once he started talking to Cap, it was easy to talk about anything. It's one of the reasons Clint liked him so much, the fact that it was so easy to trust him and feel at home with him.
With a onceover look at himself in the mirror, he took a breath in and headed for the door.
Steve was still sitting in bed when he returned to their room. He sat down in front of him.
Steve was adamant to remain coy. “About?” He asked, tucking his head against the base of Tony’s shoulder where his cologne smelled the strongest.
Steve didn't know what to feel. Tony is alive and he's ecstatic about that, yet, he left him a goodbye message apologizing for things he didn't need to apologize for. He shook his head. He will not accept Tony's surrender. Because that's simply what it was. He can't sit idle and wait for things to somehow get worse. That's not what Tony does. Tony bends the situation to fit his needs, so Steve was finding it incredibly harrowing that he'd send him that message.
"He told me what you talked about, furthering what I already knew." He shrugged. "He also told me that he likes you so much and may even love you."
Tony watched as he licked his upper mustached lip afterwards. He bit his own and took a breath in on a sigh. “So, since our day has already started, what’s planned?”
“Hey. None of that crap.” Bucky lets Clint’s pants fall down to his ankles. “You know it’s true.” Clint steps out of his pants and looks up to find Bucky holding a dry pair. “What we have isn’t exactly ideal.” He kneels down and holds the sweats as Clint steps in them. “You had him first and you agreed to the whole Tony thing because you realized that you actually felt something for him.” Bucky pulls his sweats up to his hips and tosses him a shirt. Clint catches it and puts it on while Bucky was changing out of his own wet clothes. “Yeah. I love Steve and I love you but I love Tony too.”
Simultaneously, Steve felt his heart drop to his knees and jump up into his throat. A message from Tony for him? That must mean that Tony is safe. He could feel his lips begin to turn upwards into a smile. He'd wanted to not think about Tony at all because of raw wounds that still hung untreated between them, but he hadn't allowed himself to think about what could've happened to him. Not since Bruce mentioned that he boarded the alien space ship.
“Guilty.” Steve confessed, pressing a kiss to Tony’s neck.
He turned back slightly, careful of disturbing Jack and kissed Steve. "You did check baby." He reminded him.
He looked to his right and Steve was staring at him with curiosity, no hint of bitter blame or what the hell was that Barton.
“You.”
The image of shards of glass and red and gold made its way behind his eyelids and Steve forced his eyes wide open. "No."
That was okay. Tony was guilty and he owed this to Steve and he enjoyed it too.
"I feel it too." Tony whispered, his lips brushing against Steve’s. "I know now how you feel when I lock myself away from you."
Tony took Steve’s hand in his and they held Jackie's little hand. "How did you get past the security code on the gate to the balcony?"
Thanos said that he wasn't the only one cursed with knowledge, maybe that wasn't so true. Tony didn't know what was going to happen when he suggested that they take the fight to Thanos. He didn't know if they could win but he hoped they would, hoped they would be able to stop him before he could retrieve the rest of the Infinity Stones.
Tony had sagged back against the headboard and Steve was having none of it. He pulled him close and tight to his chest as his arms encircled him, blunt fingernails digging into his back, and his lips went to his ear. Steve had told him things he'd never admitted before, fears he has and worries he couldn't shake, confirming to Tony just how different this time was, all while praising him and reminding him just how much he loves him.
"I read that in your report handsome. I want to know the stuff that didn't make it on paper." Tony pressed, a hint of a smirk in his voice.
Steve opened his eyes to thankfully dim lightning, Tony being the gentleman Steve knows him to be, and the smiling face of his son. "Hey Jackie."
Steve attacked first, his shield at the front of his bike always a nice target for gun shooters. The drug lord saw Cap coming and opened fire, yelling at his henchmen for backup. The kids ran for cover behind an out of order bus.
Steve parted his lips behind Tony's ear and a full body shudder rocked through Tony's body.
"Thank you Clint. For convincing Jack to come inside earlier today." Steve nodded sincerely, truly grateful to Clint.
Tony sighed, accepting defeat for the moment. He looked past Steve in the living room behind them and noticed a bottle of wine and two glasses. “Was that there when we came in?”
Steve smiled and cupped his cheeks, his eyes wet too.
"Hey baby." Tony replied and wow did he screw up big this time if the awkwardness of how that sounded on his lips was any indication. How long did he spend in the workshop this time?
Tony began to put the clothes away in the closet, a fond expression colouring his face at the fact that Steve thought of everything, even though he still didn’t tell him much. Tony was gathering some clues; it appeared that Steve had arranged a little getaway for them, why though, Tony couldn’t answer. Yet.
"Oh I am sorry Mr. Bear. Forgive me." He set Jack down in his bed with the teddies he managed to grab and tucked him in.
"He'll be okay. He's got you for a dad." Steve assured him with a kiss to his shoulder.
Steve leaned over the back of the chair and whispered into Tony’s ear. “Oh, I am.”
"I don’t understand your relationship with him."
Steve kissed him as he began rolling his hips against Tony's.
Steve sat up and glanced at Clint. "Thank you."
Clint lowered his gaze in defeat. So much for time with Cap. Looks like Stark's the only one who'll ever take up space on his mind. He got up as well and poured himself a mug of coffee, taking it with him to the very rear of the jet to drink while he had secured the bikes. He could hear Steve on the phone as he began the task of unbolting them.
"Clint texted me earlier. There's a mission. We're leaving at dawn." Steve didn’t bring up that he hardly ever slept when Tony's away. Or that he’s been waiting for what seemed like ever. Tony doesn’t need to know. This kind of hurt is for Steve's heart only.
Tony was gasping again in a very brief time. Steve’s own little tiny whispered gasps getting louder.
"I brought you up here and cleaned you and dressed you." He sighed and turned to press his lips to Steve's neck. "I knew you weren't sleeping well. I saw your eyes when you came to the workshop. I just didn't realize that I was causing you to practically break."
"Papa." Jack repeated, shivering slightly despite Tony's arms around him.
Steve’s strokes continued for a while until Tony’s come down enough to take control and switch their hold so his hand made contact with Steve's member.
Tony smiled. "He's sleeping on my chest. He's all warmed up. And he's having quality cuddle time with Cap bear."
Steve wrapped his arm around Jack protectively. "Easy Jackie. You could fall."
Steve holds his head between his hands and tries not to think, to just focus on Tony. He concentrates on his breathing, managing to find a rhythm that matches Tony’s inhales and exhales. It’s working. Tony can feel his pulse slow under the tips of his fingers. “This is much better.” Tony whispers to the streaks of water on the window, only loud enough for Steve to hear. “Your pulse is slow and steady. Just like mine. Can you hear it?” Of course Steve can hear Tony’s heart beating and Tony knows this but he wants to hear Steve say something. Steve nods slightly in response but Tony is not content with his answer. “I didn’t hear you babe.” He leans into the back of Steve’s chair, still very gently working his fingers in the tense spots on Steve’s neck. “I can hear it.” He says almost to himself, leaning back just as Tony leans even further forward. “Let me know that you can.”
Steve laughed and pulled Tony back towards him, carrying on as if they weren’t interrupted.
He didn’t answer immediately, instead he captured Tony’s lips in a soft kiss. Tony smiled, going up on his tiptoes out of habit. He refused to be distracted and made the kiss short. “Steve!” He whined. “I saw the clothes. We’re escaping from the compound, aren’t we?”
Steve was confused. Clint obviously meant Tony but what did he mean he doesn't understand their relationship?
"You'd be you, amazing, forgiving, you, and you'd come for me because I messed up. Again." He shut his eyes and willed his voice to stay level, even if became deadly quiet. "Honey, I'm so sorry. My time is coming and my mind is everywhere but I can't help but think of you and Jackie. And it just makes me believe to my core how much I've wronged you and how much I've wronged us. I don't know.."
Tony leaned forward until his chest was pressed flush against Steve’s and he wound his arms tighter around his neck, leaving no space between them. “Why wouldn’t I be?”
"You finish the milk first like the big boy you are then you can have the hot chocolate." Tony smiled, pressing the cup into Jack's hands and keeping his hands over his to warm them.
Shaking his head, Tony leaned forward and kissed Steve. Before Steve could say or do anything, Tony mumbled the most intense feeling he’s had all night. “How am I supposed to survive a lifetime of you taking my breath away?”
Tony gasped loudly at the touch and Steve kissed him. Tony met his eyes then. "Steve.." He whispered.
Tony sighed; he always found it relaxing to watch the city, especially from high up. It reminded him of being in the suit and flying high up above all the unsuspecting civilians. Tonight though, it’s just a beautiful night with the one he cares about most.
Tony's thoughts were thankfully interrupted by JARVIS's offer. "Shall I ask him to come in sir?"
“There you are.” Tony whispered against Steve’s shoulder blade. A whisper was all his vocal cords seemed capable of this late at night. He wound his arms around Steve’s larger frame and revelled in his body heat.
“Take your time, babe.” Tony called back as he walked further inside the room, taking its components into account.
"You are a great dad. Jackie loves you." Steve insisted, reaching over to fluff Jack's honey brown hair.
Tony’s lips parted slightly in similar response. "Did you see Hawkeye baby?"
Once he was standing outside the entrance, he had to remind himself that this was because of Tony. That he was going to return to earth and he'd want to know how his baby Jackie is doing. It was for them that Steve took a deep breath in to steady himself and made his way inside.
Steve nearly ran back to the compound. His body was covered in new wounds left by those taken by the mad titan, his soul was stretched wide across time, his heart was constantly poked by shards of glass, but he was closer to finding the balm that can heal it all. It smells like baby powder and motor oil.
Tony pulls the chain just a bit further for his lips to ghost over Steve’s. “Kiss me Cap.” He whispers barely hearing his own voice, his lips brushing up ever so slightly against Steve’s. His lips connect with Tony’s softly, sliding together to fit his perfectly. Tony kisses him slowly despite wanting more, letting Steve lead the way and part his lips only when he had enough of tasting Tony’s own. Steve holds his lips to the genius’s until they both need to breathe. He pulls his lips away, taking his time and making Tony chase after his mouth. When Steve captures his lips again, he parts them a fraction, giving Tony what he wants but still commanding every move.
Steve shrugged, his hands sliding under the jacket of Tony’s suit and pulling it off. “I miss my man.” He tossed the jacket towards the couch.
It wouldn't have ever crossed his mind that the changes Cap experienced were because he was so tied to Stark that not seeing him for weeks continuously was like cutting that thread and leaving Steve hovering in the middle of nowhere with no one to go back to. A broken being drifting off into the unknown. Almost like not having a home. And didn’t Cap already suffer enough because of everything that he faced waking up into this century? Apparently and according to the universe, no. They wanted to torture Steve a little more. Maybe tempt his faith, test his mettle.
Steve’s hands immediately came up to hold Tony’s, threading their fingers together. “Here I am.”
Bucky loosens Clint’s fingers in his shirt, bringing his fingers up to his lips to brush his lips over them. Clint shuts his eyes and feels nothing but Bucky’s lips ghosting over his calloused hand. He made his decision to trust Bucky blindly a long time ago and knew that he shouldn’t be worried. He couldn’t help it, but he wasn’t going to pass on the opportunity to at least explain himself even if the captain decides to ignore his feelings.
Tony leaned back in his chair and swiveled it around. He was tired. There was no better adjective to describe his current state. Granted, it has been a while since he’s had a full day at the office. He’ll probably get reaccustomed to the hectically organised system soon enough.
He rolled onto his side to face Steve, then turned over onto his stomach to look up at him. Steve’s chest was warm as Tony traced a repetitive string of 0s and 1s to spell ‘I love you’ over his heart. Steve’s smile grew wider, familiar with the sequence. “I love you, too.”
"I'm not such a great dad." He mumbled, passing Jack the sippy cup of milk.
Tony shook his head slightly with a small smile on his lips. "This is different." He admitted. He was right. This was like reuniting the two of them after the time they spent apart because of him. It was a reunion between them. One that shadowed everything they’ve done together and brought them right back to their first time. With Steve being the exact opposite of everyone Tony’s had in his bed. Steve who was so gentle and careful about everything, even the smallest detail. Steve who took Tony into his arms on their marriage bed and made love to him against moonlight streaming into their room and brisk sea breeze filling the air.
"Certainly sir." Came the A.I.'s response as DUM-E began whirring around.
Steve suddenly got a burst of awareness, the serum sensing danger. Of course Steve didn’t think Clint was any danger to him but that didn’t stop his body from producing adrenaline. He furrowed his eyebrows. "Clint?"
Dispirited by the disruption, Tony followed Steve’s line of sight. “Oh.” He shifted his hands lower to cup Steve’s neck. “Do you think he saw us?”
Steve tilts his head to the side and presses his lips to Tony’s who isn’t expecting a kiss. Tony is startled for a millisecond before his eyes flutter shut and he gives Steve’s lips the attention they demand from his. He doesn’t have the chance to kiss Steve for long before finding himself being swept off the bed into the soldier’s arms. He loops his arms around Steve’s neck, resting his head on his broad chest. Steve carries Tony to the shower and sets him on his feet as he gets the water running at an optimal temperature.
Steve used the same hand on Tony's neck to brush his thumb across his lips in the most softest of caresses. Tony's lips slid apart slightly at the overwhelming emotion that swept through him.
Jack did his best impression of Tony's sassiest smirk. "Magic Papa."
Steve knew without the promises though, be they spoken or symbolic. Tony may get very busy but he'll never stop loving Steve. Ever.
He must’ve jinxed it though ‘cause soon Cap was sulking again. And that was the word. Clint knew about Tony and the way Steve was staring out the window, was like someone whose heart was aching. And Steve's no doubt definitely ached.
"I think it may have been an accident." Steve rested his head on Tony's shoulder, his arms finding haven around Tony's ribs. "Ask him."
Tony brushed his hand over Jack's honey brown hair. "What did he tell you?"
. "I don't know who's left but you can lead them. You can make this right. I know I'm asking too much of you, I always do. But if anyone, anywhere, can right our wrongs, it's you. You are more than capable and you are just the man that can kick that purple titan down a notch or two." Tony couldn't help but smile, the image of a victorious Steve was too beautiful.
Steve shook his head making Tony grin. “I’ve always wanted to make out with you in the rain. Bonus now that you’ve got these long golden locks.” Tony twisted a lock of Steve’s hair for emphasis.
He swallows the nagging fear in his heart and takes the last step towards Clint. “That I could fall in love with you as quickly as I have.” Clint’s jaw drops and his eyes widen still, tears forming at the corners of them. “You love me?” He asks childishly, spilling a tear at his disbelief. “I love you.” Steve admits, pulling his hands closer to him. Clint gasps and begins to cry, the rush of emotions he so rarely had confessed to him, sending him over the edge. He pulls his hands away from Steve’s to cover his face. Steve parts his lips, but all words are useless. He takes Clint’s wrists and drops them to his sides. “I love you but I don’t expect you to feel the same.” Steve reassures him, smile sad as his tears are threatening to copy Clint’s. He lifts a thumb and wipes away at Clint’s cheek. “I feel the same way.” Clint mumbles watching the Captain’s tears spill. Steve shakes his head, smiling.
Steve sighed and let go of Clint’s hands.
After the shower, Steve insisted that he dress Tony, everything from underwear to bed clothes. He even dried and brushed his hair.
"I love you." Tony didn't know what else to say. He knew he should've just said exactly as he felt but whenever he tried, he clammed up. And he did love Steve. He'd love Steve over and over and over again for eternity.
Steve gripped his hand where it rested on his hip. "Tony.." He murmured, lacing his fingers through Tony’s tightly.
He couldn’t make out any words and he didn't try to. Why would he hurt himself like that? No doubt they were talking about missing each other or what they'd like to do when they were reunited. Yeah, it would hurt if he heard Cap planning to bed Stark.
Clint could've sworn he felt his heart stop momentarily at hearing Steve describe what it's like to miss his lover. It was unbelievable just how much Steve truly loved Stark. Nobody could talk about missing anyone like that and shatter Clint’s heart the way Cap just did.
"You play with Jackie." Jack demanded as he rest his head against Tony's chest while Tony carried him to his room.
Jack giggled. "Tickles."
The smile that made its way onto his lips would’ve been too welcome had it not been for the fact that the muscles of his face were still asleep and it hurt to smile. Another gust of air made him shiver. He had been mildly aware of the cool air on his bare skin as Steve gave him his sole attention with his ministrations, had welcomed it on his then heated skin even. Now was a different story, and he quickly resolved to looking for his robe in their unpacked bags.
“Sorry.” Clint apologizes, unfolding his legs and kicking his feet up on the coffee table. “It’s okay.” Bucky answers distantly, the movie quickly grabbing his full attention. He takes a sip out of his bottle just as Clint’s finger pokes him in his right arm, tearing his eyes away from the TV. “How am I even supposed to get Steve down here?” He asks, worry taking over his voice. “Don’t worry about that. He’ll come down eventually.” Bucky reassures, stuffing way too much chips in his mouth, following them with a chug of coke. Clint impatiently waits for his eyes to return to his own. They don’t and Clint yanks the bottle out of Bucky’s hand. “What if he doesn’t?”
“Is that a Captain America promise? Or a ‘I promise’ but mean nothing by it.” Tony pouted.
Steve hung up with Tony and slung his bag over his shoulder, checked his shield and went out to find Clint already on his bike.
"Don’t you worry your pretty mind. I know what I have. I know what you are." Tony whispered confidently, running his fingers through Steve's sleep messed hair.
Steve laughed, a melody to Tony’s ears. “I did say you will find out everything.”
Bucky asks JARVIS to tell Tony to hurry because he’s missing too much. Steve’s blush deepens at the thought of his husband seeing this and Clint’s just about as red as a tomato. Steve turns Clint’s hands in his and to his relieved surprise, the archer doesn’t jerk his hands away. He wraps his fingers around Steve’s loosely and reluctantly, allowing himself to even take a tiny step towards him. Steve smiles small, rubbing his thumb over the inside of Clint’s wrist. He hears Tony enter the living room behind him and he looks back.
Steve looked up at him and his eyes were a mixture of rage and sadness. He opened his mouth to ask when Clint spoke.
“Oh, I grabbed that.” Steve announced.
The room had ceiling to floor windows looking out at New York City. Tony stood in front of one and looked out at the night sky alive with the lights shining from the many buildings, the brightest of which coming from Avengers Tower.
"Not sleep good." Jack answered and shrugged his shoulders, the blankets slipping off them a little.
Tony turned his head and kissed Steve until his lungs burned with the need for oxygen.
He realized when he went to fetch something to wear that Tony hadn't cleared out his room and a smile painted its way onto his lips. The man's generosity was bigger than life. He caught his reflection as he dressed and it drew his attention. The length of his hair and his facial hair were an attempt at a cover when he was on the run. He wasn't on the run anymore. He nodded at the fatigued figure that stared back at him.
The room spun and his body connected with cold tile. He heard a familiar voice..
Challenging, Tony knows exactly what Steve will do. And he does. Steve shifts a little in his chair so he’s looking at Tony and with a thumb coaxes Tony down to his level. He tilts Tony’s head to the left and brings his lips down to brush against his pulse point. Tony shivers. Steve doesn’t kiss or bite or lick Tony’s neck, just leaves his lips touching the soft skin. Very content to just breathe in his very familiar scent of expensive cologne and to count every beat of his heart under his lips as the sun slowly sets, darkening Steve’s room and creating Tony’s favourite mood.
His hands came up and found shelter nestled in Steve’s overgrown hair. He tugged him closer and kissed him deeper. “That’s more like it.” He whispered against his partner’s lips, once more, his vocal cords not capable of any volume louder than a whisper.
Steve desperately wants to follow him but can’t, not unless Tony wants that. He waits where he’s standing, shivering once in the cold against his naked body. Tony notices and holds out his hand, the print of Steve’s fingers on his wrist very vibrant. Steve’s heart breaks in his chest, knowing he’s the one who did that to Tony, as he steps forward and takes Tony’s hand, holding onto it very lightly. “Sit down.” Tony whispers, Steve does, not letting go of Tony’s hand. “You must really love me to be this violent.” Tony mumbles, eyes on Steve’s fingers as they run up and down his wrist softly, minding the bruise. Steve simply nods, acknowledging that he only hurt Tony because of how much he hates himself for kissing Clint. Tony licks his lips. “You’ve never hurt me..” Tony’s voice is choked with unspilled tears. “Ever.” He looks up Steve who avoids his eyes. “Why?” He asks, tears falling down his cheeks.
Boy, his voice sounded so good to Tony's ears right now. Even in the whispery tone Steve had used.
Steve can’t articulate any of his emotions so he settles for a sigh that lands Tony’s chin on his bare shoulder. “I’ll never stop loving you.” Tony promises in Steve’s ear, wrapping his arm around his waist. Steve turns a fraction to face Tony and presses his forehead to his, nose brushing his very slightly and familiarly. He watches as Tony flutters his eyes closed. “Even if you kissed someone who I wasn’t in love with.” Tony adds, his smile returning to his full lips. Steve smiles as Tony’s lips tug up and he thinks that maybe this can work. He can love Tony and Bucky and still have a last chance at discovering whether Clint likes him or just views him as a friend. He’s not giving up now. Not when he put Tony through so much pain last night. Not if Tony is still smiling and laughing and cracking jokes like nothing’s happened. Maybe Steve can do the same. He doesn’t need to be upset with himself so much when Tony and Bucky aren’t.
Steve pulled himself forward until his face was next to Tony's. He opened his mouth to say something and gasped quietly.
"Steve." He corrected and smiled to himself. It was always much more intimate to use his first name. "If you find this message, don't be upset. Part of the journey is the end." He sighed.
As soon as their eyes met across the room, Tony grinned and Steve stood up. Tony walked towards him confidently, the nervous butterflies he felt earlier having not been invited on their date tonight.
"I missed you too Tony. More than I can describe baby." Steve admitted, sitting up, keeping Jackie at his chest with his arm around him.
Jack nodded and Tony squeezed him into a hug.
His desk was piled high with paperwork; documents he needed to sign, drafts he needed to approve, and last minute changes to his schedule. He didn’t have a spot to set down his coffee mug. And if he were being honest, he had the urge to sweep his desk clear and let all the pesky paperwork take a tumble to the floor.
He didn't mind. A quarter of his face was better than nothing. Clint may have secretly liked liked Cap. He kept it to himself, not a soul knew. How could he tell anyone when Steve and Tony were so open about their marriage and child?
Tony brings his hands down on the Captain’s tense shoulders and begins messaging them to relax him a little. Steve sighs deeply under his touch, suddenly very aware of the precious metal ring on Tony’s finger as he works his hands efficiently. He did tell Tony what he did a few hours ago obviously, and even though Tony took it very well, he still couldn’t forgive himself. Steve suddenly drops his head down onto his desk,  too overwhelmed by the events of the day to make sense of anything. Tony’s hands follow him, wrapping ever so gently around his neck and rubbing delicately. He shuts his eyes and lets himself really feel Tony’s touch on his skin as he works just for Steve’s own benefit without being asked.
Steve ordered the cheque as Tony finished the last of his creme brulee. He licked his lips. “When are you going to tell me the occasion of this surprise date? It’s the end of the night already.”
Tony draws his hand back to rest on his stomach but the soldier reaches for it again. Tony allows Steve to thread their fingers and lay them over his chest. But he is confusing Tony so much. He hardly said anything since he pinned Tony to the bed and now he looks like he is facing a dilemma. “Steve.” Tony whispers, voice hoarse. He waits for an answer but Steve remains silent. “Steve.” He repeats and gets his hand squeezed gently in response. “Baby, answer me.” Tony tries, bringing his other hand to wander the length of the soldier’s chiseled body.
Hold on. Damn Steve smells good and he's so beautiful looking at me like that even though he looks so tired.
Steve smiled, the only indication of which to Tony was the way his facial hair shifted against the top of his neck. “Who said you’d be away from me? I’m not leaving this apartment. You’ll just be unaware of me.”
As he waits, he loses himself to the song that JARVIS has playing in the room, dancing and singing along to the music. All the songs are from his playlist and he knows without a doubt that Tony must’ve told his A.I. to play them at some point before he went to bed. That is if he did. He picks out the tea for the morning and soaks the bag in the boiling water, adding sugar, then he pours Bucky a mug of bitter black coffee, leaving both on the kitchen counter.
He hadn't even opened his eyes and already felt movement around him. That's great. He didn't want to be alone. A lot of movement surrounded him then and a little body was crawling up on his chest.
Clint stands under the New York Gray sky, cold to his bones and the rain soaking him even beyond. He sighs to the wind and shoves his hands deeper into his pockets. He regrets his decision or lack of decision rather, but it’s too late. Hours pass by as the rain continues to pour but Clint doesn’t have it in mind to go inside. He’s replaying the events that occurred earlier in the afternoon over and over again behind his eyes, coming to the same conclusion every time. He should’ve acted.
Bucky leads Clint up to his room and undresses him despite the string of complaints that rang in his ears. “I told you I didn’t want to change.” Clint repeats as Bucky pulls his hoodie over his head. Bucky simply laughs,  tossing the purple hoodie aside and proceeding to undo his pants. “What kind of a boyfriend would I be if I let you wear wet clothes to bed?” “A better one than I’ll ever be.” Clint mutters to himself but he knew Bucky hears his every word.
"JARVIS, have DUM-E bring Jack another hot chocolate. Oh and his favourite carrot muffins." Tony instructed. Always the one to spoil the ones he loves.
Jack kissed him on his cheek before loosening his arms.
Steve nodded, sitting up in his seat. At the change in angle as his cheek left the back of the chair, he became aware of the wetness on his cheeks.
"I'm sorry?"
Tony glanced back at Steve and felt his heart sink. Steve had the 'this is my fault' expression. Of course it was like him to blame himself for getting busy while Jack slept or rather couldn’t sleep.
Tony smirked. “Knew you liked it. Noticed you reacted when I first got to dinner.”
Steve did let Tony style and gel his hair, mostly because it calmed the both of them as well as Steve enjoying Tony running his fingers through his hair.
Tony chuckled. “Steve St-” Realization dawned on him and his chuckle faded only to be replaced by a hopeful longing in his eyes as they met Steve’s.
"You haven't done anything." Steve disagreed and went back to nuzzling Tony's neck.
It was inside the elevator and nearing the floor Steve selected that Tony spoke. “Does Mr. Rogers intend to do unspeakable things to me? Away from home, alone, isolated in a hotel.”
He paid no attention to Steve, his attention already claimed by the 0.07 of a degree drop in temperature that Jackie had.
When he finishes and gets dressed in Bucky’s favourite long sleeves shirt and a pair of purple sweats, he goes over to the little kitchen area in his and Bucky’s room to get started on breakfast. He never prepares anything fancy. When he spends the night with Bucky, he knows that by the time he wakes up, whatever he made will be too unappealing to eat. And when he spends the night with Tony, coffee will suffice. So he gets coffee started for Bucky and water boiling for his tea.
When they both needed air, Tony took the opportunity to ask another burning question. “What made you want to do this?”
The small box landed in his hand and he didn’t have to look to know what it contained. Steve bared his heart for him and he only wished he had the words to articulate how much that meant to him, how incredibly exact his feelings for him are.
He was breathing heavier than usual and Tony guessed that after who knows how many days, this was affecting Steve on a very deep emotional level. He had every right to. Tony knew Steve loved him a lot more than he'll ever be able to love him in return. It explained Steve's hesitancy and desire for only the slightest of touches. Tony owed him and he reminded himself of his promise.
The final touch to his appearance was a spray of a cologne that he reserved for special occasions. And nothing was more special than a surprise date with the love of his life. It was also one he so very rarely used that Steve likely wasn’t used to its scent and he looked forward to seeing how he would react.
A shiver ran down Tony’s spine as Steve purposely nudged his nose against the shell of his ear. He hoped they could actually get through dinner before they had to excuse themselves and get a room. Good thing the restaurant was in a hotel.
"I miss you so much Steve." Tony murmured in a scratchy voice. Saying that made him feel like even more of a hypocrite. He couldn't last an hour without knowing Steve is close to him. How did Steve feel practically all the time?
Steve smiled a small polite smile, not knowing what else to say and Clint turned around to the jet’s console.
They both heard the rain picking up by the heavy pattering it made against the railing before they felt it. Tony moved to duck from the assault of the water and accidentally knocked over the forgotten cup of coffee which fell over the balcony. “Oops.”
Another tear splashed against his cheek. He began to trance a vein on his wrist.
Clint sighs and leans back into Bucky’s strong chest. Bucky uses the opportunity to kiss Clint’s neck, to distract him even if just for a few minutes. “Bucky.” Clint mumbles, angling his neck to the warm lips. “Please.” Bucky repeatedly kisses the same spot on the long neck, knowing what it does to the archer. “Please what?” He murmurs in Clint’s neck. Clint brings his hand to hold Bucky’s metal one on his hip. “Don’t do this.” He manages through biting his lower lip that held his moans in check.
A flicker in his eyes suggested an idea. “FRIDAY, take the car back home.” He instructed as he stepped out of the car.
Tony furrowed his eyebrows. What made Jack so suddenly decide to come in out of the cold? How did he even make it past the sealed gate without bribing JARVIS?
He pulled out a fancy new tux that Steve's never seen before and laid it on the bed.
Okay, that's mean. Steve wouldn't actually ever discuss that on the phone and definitely not when someone was in earshot. Clint was just a little bitter with Stark for stealing Steve from him. Even when Stark’s not here, he's still here.
The world went shaky and the sound of the explosion rang in their ears.
Tony saw his tears and he couldn't help not comforting him. He pressed a single soft kiss to his lips. "I will give you all my attention."
Tony sighed as he decided to ask his other question. "What made you come back in Jackie?"
"What's up?" He prompted, shamelessly stepping closer to Steve who didn't mind one bit.
Steve shut his eyes as he realized that Tony knew about his lack of sleep. "It's nearly impossible to feel safe without you Tony."
"You know maybe it's the rain. Or better yet, my awesomeness totally overrid the gyro and tilted the jet to my side." He joked, jabbing his elbow in Steve's direction.
"I did." Tony clarified. "I saw you fall when I came to say hi. I was waiting for you to arrive."
"Hi Tony. Did I wake you?" Steve guessed that Tony would still be awake but what if he wasn’t.
"Actually sir," came JARVIS's voice into the bathroom. "The Captain is just outside your workshop sir."
"Noo. He talk to Jackie with JARBIS." Jack answered, turning over and lying in Tony's lap.
"As if I can stop thinking about you."
Tony reminisces his time with Steve. He couldn't even remember the last time they spoke to each other and it sent a cold spike straight through his chest. Tony regretted not having called Steve when he should've. At least if he had, he'd know Steve's status right now and they would be together, as they should be. Now Tony doesn't know if Steve fought to his last breath or vanished with the other fifty percent of the Earth as per the alien's plan.
"No. Trust Adad. Weeeee!" Jack squealed happily, bouncing again.
"You're very smart Jackie." He brought Jack's hand and Steve's up to his lips, kissing Jack's tiny fingers one by one, then kissing Steve's wedding ring, barely visible through his fingerless gloves.
Steve's hands were at his belt next and he was being kissed deeply yet so softly.
Tony was shivering even though Steve's body heat kept him warm. He bent his knees and locked his ankles around Steve's thighs, and held him tightly in his arms, taking in all of his bodily warmth.
Clint smiled as a faint blush colored his cheeks. "Don’t mention it Cap. You would’ve done the same if he was my son."
Steve tensed visibly beside Tony.
Steve could not control his tears as they returned at full force and streamed down his cheeks, pooling in the sleeve of his shirt. Tony's thoughts were of him and Jackie. Jackie, whom they never got to bring into their family. He was Tony's dream, and he became Steve's the second Tony asked if they could adopt him. He stopped dreaming about having a family long ago, but Tony pulled him into it and he couldn't have been more excited.
Suspicion confirmed. "You saw him didn’t you?"
“Come inside with me.” Bucky’s voice breaks through the rushing of the water, hand still on Clint’s shoulder. “I’d rather not.” Clint says quietly, hands balling to fists in his pockets. “Can’t stay out here forever. You’re gonna get cold eventually.” Bucky hypothesizes, letting go of Clint’s shoulder to brush the night - black wet hair from his face. “I won’t.” He sneezes in reply, betraying his words. “Sure you won’t. Come on. He’s locked himself up as well. You won’t see him.” Bucky literally shoves Clint back through the glass doors under the expensive shielding roof of Tony’s empty living room.
Steve opened his mouth to argue but Tony silenced him with a kiss. He could kiss Tony forever and forevermore.
"Tony." Steve called barely audibly.
“Stop it!” Bucky demands, emerging from the comfort of his blanket. “Nope! Not until you get up!” Clint teases, bringing the pillow down on Bucky’s face yet again. “Quit it!” Bucky yanks the pillow out of Clint’s hand and shoves it under his own. Clint brings out the adorable puppy face. “Please..” He pleads sweetly, fingers running up and down Bucky’s left arm. The soldier watches as he pouts and widens his eyes further. “All right!” Bucky gives up, smiling. “Thanks!” Clint says, excitement in his voice, already moving to get off the bed when cool metal wraps around his wrist, pulling him back down.
"But my biggest mistake was not calling you. I don't even know if you knew but I held onto that phone from the second it arrived in the mail. I took it everywhere with me. It was, in so many ways, my lifeline. Even if I never could bring myself to call you,
Steve chuckled softly. "Jackie."
"Sorry." He mumbled in apology, his cheeks coloring faintly but Steve only clapped him on the back and picked up his bag, moving a couple of seats back in the jet.
"Baby.." Steve whispered at his lips after the brief kiss.
Steve ducked his head in a sad smile that he hoped Tony wouldn't catch. He had no idea just how much Steve missed him. At this point, Steve wasn't even thinking about making love to Tony. He just wanted to be close to him.
He didn't keep Tony waiting long and returned to the circle of his legs, lacing the fingers of his left hand with Tony's right and using his right to slowly caress down Tony’s chest.
Steve was shaking. He didn't know what to do. Should he tell the team about Tony and go looking for him? Should he check on Jackie? Should he do what Tony said and take Thanos down a notch before all else? He didn't know. Right now he needed Tony more than he ever did. He couldn't make the tough choices all on his own. He wasn't strong enough, and that was hardly a weakness. He's stronger with Tony by his side.
"Here you go Junior." Tony said, swapping the sippy cups.
Steve tilted his head to look at his husband for the first time. He looked stunning. He was wearing a dark black tux that shone in the dim light, paired with a white shirt and a crimson tie.
"Bear Papa. I bear." Jack corrected with a tiny roar.
"Baby.." He murmured softly. "You haven't been sleeping well. Can you at least try for me?"
Steve moved to pick up his bag when Tony's fingers curled around his wrist.
Tony promised himself in that second that he'll be what Steve wants, his own needs be damned. It was a good decision because Steve kissed him so very gently, his kisses were barely more than brushes of his lips against Tony's.
Tony squeezed his eyes shut. He couldn't allow himself to think the word and let it carve a pathway into his mind. If he did, it would make it real and he couldn't let it be, even if he knew. There was another child, a much younger one, that was constantly on his mind. One that he would've been incredibly proud to call himself the father of. Before going their separate ways, Steve and Tony were in a good place, happy together, the happiest Tony had ever been in the 46 years he'd been alive. They were thinking about adopting a baby boy. Jack Rogers-Stark.
Everything was exactly as it had been in Tony’s dreams. He and Steve finally had the peace they so longed for, a quiet that was comfortable. While Tony had teased Steve about his intentions of bringing them to the hotel, Tony would have never guessed that this is how his day was going to end. His head rested on Steve’s shoulder and his ring-adorned hand was held in Steve’s.
"I'll lead." Steve shouted as he revved his engine and took off. Clint followed closely.
Steve's hands circled Tony's thighs as he moved from between his legs to pull down his pants. He pulled his off while sitting at the edge of the bed before wasting no time in returning to Tony.
Steve caught sight of Tony’s smile and pressed a kiss to his shoulder.
They lost. He lost. He was supposed to do more, be more prepared, should've anticipated Thanos's every move. But what good do 'if' and 'but' and "I should have' do now. The mad genocidal titan accomplished his mission, and Tony couldn't even begin to evaluate the losses. The world's losses, his teams' losses, his losses.
Steve nodded on autopilot, his mind elsewhere already as he looked out the window as the tower slowly faded from view.
Clint tilted his head to the side. "How do you mean?"
With a huff, he faced the direction of the street leading towards the compound and took the first step when something black and red caught his attention. The figure was across the street in the park and they were doing a good job of hiding themselves. If it weren't for the sudden twitch they'd made, they would've remained hidden.
Steve smiled, wrapping his arms around Tony as he held their son.
Tony attempted to bite at his thumb but Steve pulled his hand back too quickly. “Are you going to make me ask?”
He made it to the hotel before FRIDAY’s ETA for the car and it felt good. He disassembled the suit and was back in his carefully chosen outfit for the evening as he stepped into the lobby. A host approached him and handed him a card. Tony thanked him and examined it. He laughed. Steve had drawn them sitting at their undoubtedly reserved table along with a map of how to get there.
"All done handsome." Tony announced, heading away from the dresser to the bathroom to wash off the extra hair gel.
He was greeted with a terse smile that he could not bring himself to return. The social worker there could hardly hold it against him when she appeared to have been through hell herself. It clicked for Steve then, that she must've seen someone vanish into dust. He felt his body go limp.
Clint checked his phone. "About eight hours."
"I'll need to talk him right?" Steve never wanted to hurt Clint. And it makes much more sense now why he was asking about Steve and Tony’s relationship. Steve owed him a conversation where they figure this out.
Tony couldn't do it anymore. Steve's hand in his, their eyes locked together, Steve smelling and sounding so damn good to Tony who hasn't been with him in like ever, and Steve getting this close, well that was the final straw.
Nebula, who's his companion on the jet, who mostly leaves him alone to his thoughts and he's usually glad for, walked over to him and laid a thin blanket at his feet. He realized that he must have been shuddering quite a lot if she bothered to find him a blanket. His chest swelled at the act of kindness and constricted almost immediately after.
He couldn’t make the split second decision to either kiss him back or gently push him away fast enough before Clint's lips left his and Clint was walking out of jet.
It’s late afternoon and the sun hasn’t been up all day. Clouds have been moving in quickly and threatening to let go of their cargo. Clint shivers and watches his breath rise up. It’s colder than usual for this time of year and being out in the shooting range isn’t helping. Bucky’s arms wrap around Clint’s shoulders, covering him with the warmth of his jacket. “Thanks.” Clint turns around and shrugs into the warmth. “Any time. Are you ready for me to prove that I’m a better marksman?”
"No Steve. I get how it feels now. You being on that mission while I wasn't busy, I got to feel every little thing that you do on a constant basis. I missed you so much from the minute you left and it just kept getting worse." Tony's chest heaved against Steve's and it became clear that he was crying.
Jack swallowed a gulp of milk. "Went balcony."
"It was long and Clint saved my life from an explosion." Steve summed up briefly.
Steve felt like his heart would burst at the amount of emotion Tony's soft touch brought to him but he didn't care. It's been thirteen days since he was even this close to Tony and he didn't know how long he'd be gone for.
They kissed leisurely, taking delight in each other’s presence, unaware of the slow raindrops beginning to fall from the overcast sky.
"Baby." Came Tony’s sleepy voice into his ear.
"That's what I wanted to talk to you about."
"And when I do see him afterwards, I don't even want anything more than to know that he's right there with me." Steve blinked and a tear fell down his cheek. "That's what you described as me being myself and everything being fine. Because then I would’ve had my heart and mind return to me. Everything is easier knowing he's next to me. I can be me. I’m no longer just a ghost of Steve."
"Eight hours?!" Steve exclaimed and rose from his seat, taking his phone with him.
“Okay.” He stepped away from the bathroom and made his way to the living room.
It was like this every time Tony decided that his work and his inventions were more important than his Steve. But by far, this time’s been so very different, much more straining on the both of them.
"And when you've succeeded, when you've made him pay for everything he's done to us, I still have one more favour to ask of you. But I think you'll appreciate this one a lot more." Tony looked down at his hands, as if they're somehow a lot more precious because they've held the baby boy.
They sat like that wrapped in each other's arms for a while, Steve listening to the even beats of Tony’s heart and Tony peppering soft kisses to Steve's neck every few minutes. It wasn’t until Tony asked about the mission that Steve felt like he was being woken up from a good dream he was having.
He just kept his hand in Tony's and silently walked him into the bedroom and over to sit at the edge of the bed. He left then and Tony panicked before he realized that Steve was checking on Jackie in the next bedroom.
Tony laughed and it stretched his sleeping face muscles. “I knew there was a reason you were the one for me.”
Tony kissed his parted lips and jaw and cheeks and forehead, keeping him in his arms until his breathing slowed.
Steve’s whole body stiffened. How did he find out when Steve never said a thing?
A moment passed and neither of them moved, or wanted to, perfectly content standing in each other’s arms. It was Tony who pulled back a fraction to look into Steve’s eyes. “Cloak and dagger. Is that your new game?”
Clint shook his head as if he was trying to clear it out. "You were crying Cap. I'm not so oblivious as to not know that you were crying because of him."
Tony doesn’t move. He keeps standing where he is, wrapped up in Steve. “Tony..” The Captain whispers on a broken sob. A tear escapes and streaks Tony’s cheek. Steve’s arms tighten around him, pushing him back against his body, chain fitting between them and making Tony shudder at its coolness on his back. Tony touches Steve’s hands on his stomach, his touch barely a brush of fingertips but Steve stops right away. He raises his head and looks at Tony who whispers, “Let me go.” in a broken voice. Steve looks pained but drops his arms and backs away, giving Tony his space. The genius walks slowly back to the bed and takes a seat on the edge.
"Ummm."
Tony nodded and tried to steer the conversation away, hoping it would distract him from Steve brushing his thumb over his pulse point and his wedding band in an alternating manner.
Clint pursed his lips into a hard line. "That's not true Cap. You're you right now."
"I want bed now. You say Jackie can't go with." Jack pouted, picking up as many of his teddy bears as his little arms could carry.
Tony's hand came up to rest over Steve's, their other hands holding each other's tightly again.
"They keep you warm and keep your wonderfully kind heart beating, and they're beautiful because they're Tony's. My Tony." Steve had responded when Tony asked him why he chose to trace his veins the way he did.
Tony tucked him back in and switched the lights off for Jackie's night light as he left the room.
He's broken. In every literal and figurative meaning of the word, he feels himself to be broken.
"I think so yes. You being the guy who never lets a wrong slide." He chuckled. "But not tonight."
He had no choice but to get back and pull Cap out himself. He started running back towards Steve with the countdown in his ear. 7. 6. 5. 4. He launched himself forward and knocked him out of the way, having enough time only to hold Cap's shield in front of them for some protection.
Steve moved like Tony witnessed him move in battle, lightning fast and incredibly hush. He suddenly found himself sitting on the railing of the balcony, inches away from the cup of coffee that somehow remained balanced. Steve’s hands curled around his hips as he leaned in and touched their lips together.
He made him forget how to breathe whenever he looked at him with those Egyptian Blue eyes and he felt like he was swimming.
Steve's hand edged lower over his arc reactor and past his belly button to curl around him.
The last item was strange as Tony usually kept all armour gear in his workshop. It was also in pristine condition, as if it had never seen battle. It was beautiful, same as everything Tony created. Steve reached out to pick it up to examine it from a different angle when its eye slits suddenly lit up.
Tony’s robe was disheveled and showed more skin than it hid and he was glad for the effect he saw it was having on Steve. He bit his lower lip as Steve’s legs landed on either side of him on the too narrow bed. “Damn small bed.” He managed to huff out before Steve’s lips captured his.
Clint’s eyes follow his. “Thanks. I guess..” He grimaces. Steve catches his frown out of the corner of his eye and faces him. “The self esteem,  huh?” He says knowingly to which Clint nods and returns to watching his older boyfriends. Steve looks out across the range as it starts to rain more and a flicker of lightning hits over on the other end of the range. Clint is faraway in thought. “Do you ever think about it?” He asks, reclaiming the soldier’s attention. “Us having them and them having us?”
Steve wrapped his arms tightly around Tony. "You're not."
Tony pouted. “But I don’t want to be away from you.”
Uh oh. That means Tony must’ve seen when Clint... It's not like Steve was going to hide that but he didn’t want Tony to have witnessed it.
"Yeah baby. I won't be long. And I will call you." Steve leaned across the bed and kissed Jack on the forehead.
Steve’s arms wrapped around Tony, hugging him closer, breathing in the fading scent of his cologne. “By taking mine.”
Steve woke up to a different sound than the one he's used to and a hand on his shoulder. Bright light hit his eyes and he quickly squeezed them shut.
He spent a long time with Jackie. He'd nodded off in the chair he was sitting in and was woken by him trying to grab for his nose. He smiled and kissed his little hand. He kissed his forehead as well and stood up to return him to his crib. Jackie whined, protesting the loss of contact and making Steve wish he could take him home right away. "I'll be back." He promised as he turned around to leave.
Tony let his hand wander down to where Steve held him around his waist. “Thinking.”
"You didn't sound all right either." Clint took the seat opposite Steve's.
His mind drifted off to the last person who took the time to cover him with a blanket as he wrapped the thin article around himself.
Steve squeezed his eyes shut and tried to push those thoughts away. The last thing he wanted was to drag a knife through his old wounds that have begun to heal at last. The last thing he needed was to think about who gave him access to the compound and allowed him to call it home. The last thing he couldn't allow himself to remember were the memories he shared there. The absolute last thing he couldn't bear was the thought of
He trembled,
That’s what Steve is afraid of. Tony asking the only important question. He shuts his eyes, fingers still attempting to make a difference in touches on Tony’s wrist. “I wronged you and you don’t deserve that.” Steve says, his own tears spilling past his lashes. “I hate myself for what I did and I lashed out in the only way I know.” He continues, voice growing very quiet. “I would never hurt you. Never. I’d rather d..” “Sshhh.” Tony interrupts. “Don’t say it.” Steve lets go of Tony’s wrist to cup his face in both hands. “I’m sorry.” He breathes, his voice shaking significantly. “I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry Tony. I’m sorry. I’m horrible to you and I don’t deserve you. But I’m sorry.” Steve rambles, saying all that he felt so Tony would know. He drops his head, landing his forehead against Tony’s. “I’m sorry..” He whispers again, completely defeated by his own actions.
Steve didn’t touch him beyond brushing his thumb over his pulse the whole elevator ride. Tony didn't mind, he was uncharacteristically cataloging everything Steve did. That included the way Steve didn’t sweep him off his feet the second they were out of the elevator the way he always did to carry him to bed.
He looked over his shoulder at the adoption agency and his theory was met with further proof. He took a deep breath in and squared his shoulders. If he's right, they have work to do, and it won't be easy. At least he'll have him by his side, if he forgives him.
He somehow knew Bucky wouldn’t get upset and he didn’t. Maybe it is that Bucky is too sure that he’ll always have Steve. He’s had him the longest. In fact, Bucky actually kissed him for it, congratulating him on finally making a move. That makes up Steve’s mind and he decides that yesterday was a long time ago and today and right now, he’s with the world’s most desirable man who’s naked in bed with his chin on his shoulder. Pain and hurt and upset be damned.
Tony turned his face to press a kiss in the middle of Steve’s back. “What are you doing up? I don’t even know what time it is. But it’s definitely before dawn.”
"Oh sorry." Clint said quietly.
"That's all I ever wanted." Steve smiled, pulling Tony close to his chest.
Steve shook his head.
Steve wasn't confused anymore. It made sense now. Clint was pulling the sensitive thread, Steve's own worst fear. The happiness that Tony always managed to bring him versus the deep sadness that he was also the cause of. Clint was right. You couldn't ever make sense of their relationship.
As he spun his chair back around, he noticed a blue corner hidden until a thick black folder. He leaned forward and pulled it out, finding it to be a letter envelope. He raised an eyebrow. It was strange that an unopened letter made its way to his desk. His team took care of all mail and only forwarded what was important to him. Stranger still was that the letter was addressed to him by first name only, with no postage or return address. Tony came to the conclusion that someone placed it on his desk for him to read only.
Steve chuckled quietly, his shoulders shaking as he did.
As its door implied, the room was large. He was standing in the living room and he could see two other rooms and the bathroom Steve went to. He guessed they were master bedroom and bedroom. He made his way to one of the rooms and it turned out to be the master bedroom. What perplexed Tony was the bag sitting atop the bed. He approached the bed and opened the bag to find changes of clothes for himself and Steve, along with sweatpants and t-shirts they can wear to bed.
He turned back with a soft smile and brushed his thumb over Tony's cheek.
Red metal boots touched concrete as Tony willed the suit to form around him. A benefit of being Iron Man was that he could fly anywhere he wanted to. Fully engulfed in his second skin, Tony took off flying to his destination.
Steve sipped from the mug, not wanting to ask why Clint thought he didn't look all right. If looks are anything to go by, then Steve was a thousand times better than he felt.
Tony kissed him again, deeper and lingering before turning around and walking to the dresser to powder up any evidence of the tears that were there.
"Sshhh. Sshhh." Steve whispered at his ear.
Suddenly, his chest felt tight and he couldn't stand being in this forest where so many died. He sprung to his feet and began running and didn't stop until he had made it inside the hangar of the royal castle. He got inside one of the jets and took off, heading to the only other place that ever brought him peace; the Avengers compound.
The music still creates a happy atmosphere in the room that smells of coffee. Bucky turns himself and Clint around to lean against the kitchen counter. His eyes follow the gentle swaying of the curtains covering the cracked window. Through the mauve, Bucky only sees unmoving Gray. He brings his lips down to touch Clint’s short soft hair.
“I’ll be right out.” Came Steve’s voice through the door.
"Three hours, forty seven minutes sir." Replied the AI much to Tony's dismay. He knew he was being terrible when it came to spending time with Steve and their son but he had work to do. Threat is eminent and without his suits, he's vulnerable, worse than vulnerable. He needs to be able to keep the only person in his life who's forgiven him time and time again safe. Jackie equally so.
Clint had a brief second to get hurt before Steve was packing away his sketchbook and getting on his bike.
"Sowwy." Jack apologized with puppy eyes.
Steve didn't dream and he was grateful. He was having enough of a difficult time keeping the thoughts out of his mind while he was conscious, this was a rare gift. He didn't know how long he was asleep for, but he felt rested, and a little hungry but that can wait.
The bed was too small for his liking, a fact Tony made clear the second he laid eyes on the bed. It was hardly the spacious, luxurious kind he was used to but he had to make due. After all, he no longer was at home, not even in the same continent, and being on the run, even as Tony Stark, was still being on the run.
Though granted, his genius level dropped drastically whenever Steve's hands were on him and he quickly surrendered himself to the feeling of Steve’s full lips against his.
Steve smiled warmly and untangled his fingers from Tony, brushing the back of his hand against his cheek.
"Can't bweathe Papa!" Jack gasped, pulling on Tony's sleeve.
Tony’s tears fall in spite of himself. How could he help it when the man he loves pushed him away. Tony sits as still as he can on the bed while shaking with his tears and stares at Steve’s naked back. His wrists hurt and he rubs at them, making a low sound at the pain. He sniffles, wiping his tears away as new ones fell and gets up off the bed. Steve hears his movements and turns away from the window. Tony is heading for the door when Steve catches his arm. Tony shakes it off and it hurts to do so. But not as much as it hurts to look at Steve. More tears descend his cheeks to collect in his goatee.
"Find Jackie. He needs you, just like I need you. Just like the whole world needs you. But you would've saved the world. So, retire, adopt Jackie, raise him like a superstar. He can be Jack Rogers, he doesn't have to have my name if you prefer it that way." His heart constricted as the words left his lips. Jackie was their dream, he was going to be their son, and they were going to be his parents together. "
"Well we talked and I sketched a bit and it rained a lot."
Steve simply rolled his eyes at him and opened the door. He motioned Tony inside and followed soon. He locked the door after making sure the Do Not Disturb sign was present and removed his suit jacket. “I’ll just be a minute Tony.” He announced as he entered the bathroom.
Steve’s been in his room for too long, he realizes this much, but he can’t bring himself to go outside and face his mistake. He sketches away the scene that plays in front of him. New York’s dull dark before sunset sky raining down on the unsuspecting city below. The scene is truly magnificent. The sky where the sun is on the verge of sinking below the horizon is a brilliant bright red through the dark clouds, a very faint rainbow teasing through as well.
Clint’s full attention was back on him.
Steve sketches in pencil so he can’t fill in the vibrant colours of his sketch but behind his desk Tony is noting the extravagant display of nature. He points his camera lens at the wide window above Steve’s head and clicks to take the picture. He doesn’t stop there. He tries for a more romantic one that captures Steve’s back against the bright and yet monochromatic sky. Tony then zeros in on his sketch, noting it eternally in his camera. Steve settles his pencil down upon his sketchbook after signing the page with S.G.R. in his cursive handwriting.
Steve shut his eyes and finally turned his body halfway towards facing Tony. “I’m always close, silly.”
"With you." Assured Tony, lips at Steve’s ear.
Tony looked at him briefly while he considered the idea. "Jackie? What happened before you came to Adad and my room?"
“Was what there?” Steve turned and looked in the direction Tony was looking.
Tony took his hand and held it tightly. "Adad is not asleep baby. He just has his eyes closed."
Tony gasped then, quickly bringing his hand to his lips to not wake Jack up. Steve couldn’t just say things like that about him. These things were the things Tony was supposed to say to Steve. Steve, the love of his thousand lifetimes and his rudder and every pure thing that Tony couldn't ever do before meeting him.
“Ooh la la. The Presidential Suite. Pour moi?” Tony joked.
Tony could picture him as clearly as if he were looking at him right this second. The round face and soft fair skin. The wide, innocent honey coloured eyes, and the soft hair that was just a few shades darker than Steve's and a couple lighter than Tony's.
“FRIDAY! If I want to know when I’m getting there, I’ll ask!” He called out to the AI as he experimented with different ways to part his hair.
Steve pressed the call button for the elevator. “We’re taking the elevator.”
Steve hadn't realized that the autopilot had landed the jet in the field surrounding the compound. Nor did he realize that his mustache and beard were damp from his tears. He looked out at the large building and felt his heart constrict. Maybe coming here wasn't a good idea. It was certainly better than staying where the dead were.
He grinned, his eyes still shut. "Jackie."
Tony should’ve expected that he’d arrive at an empty home. Steve did say that he wanted to meet him wherever that address led to. He didn’t think of it at the time and was a little disappointed when Steve didn’t greet him at the door. He quickly remembered their date and realized he had just over an hour before he was due to meet Steve.
Tony didn't mind for a fraction of a second as he locked his arms together behind Steve's neck and pushed himself closer to him still, touching their chests together and pressing his forehead flush with Steve's. Tony kissed him like he wanted to draw the breath from his lungs as he urged him to move his hips. Steve obliged and descended on Tony's neck, peppering it with kisses as he pushed into him.
Yeah Tony wanted him, but if this is to be their first time in a while and also the last until Steve's mission was all done, well, he just couldn't rush no matter how much he missed Steve.
Tony opens his eyes at the touch and a smile brightens his face. “Steve.” He whispers, voice heavy with sleep. Threading his fingers through Tony’s, Steve faces his husband. “I’m here.” Tony cuddles up to Steve’s side. “Where else would you be?” He jokes way too early in the morning for Steve’s liking. He chuckles anyway. Tony brushes the back of Steve’s hand with his thumb. “Stop blaming yourself.” He hopes all too knowingly that Steve will. Steve kisses the soothing thumb. “I am to blame.” Tony shakes his head, pressing his forefinger to the Captain’s lips. “Don’t. Please. It’s okay. It’s more than okay.” He drops his finger and cups Steve’s face. ”They’re only marks. They’ll fade.” Steve attacks the inside of his lip. “I promise you honey.” Tony assures, smiling. “And now that they’re not hurting, I kind of like them.”
"Did you see Hawkeye Jackie?" Steve repeated, exchanging a shrug with Tony.
“I don’t want him to feel bad.” Clint grips the edge of the counter as he remembers how Steve’s lips felt against his. They weren’t like Tony’s or Bucky’s. They were just like Steve himself; gentle and honest and exploring, yet afraid. Clint knows exactly why Steve kissed him with such hesitance. And he had to go do exactly what Steve didn’t want to happen by not kissing him back.
"Night Papa." Jack yawned again, his arms coming up to wrap around Tony's neck as he backed away.
"That's what Jackie meant." Steve understood. "Oh baby. He'll be so sad."
His flight was long, even with the advanced Wakandan technology and autopilot. His heart ached to be somewhere familiar when the last of what he considered stable in his world was taken away. The compound can give him that. It was his home. He wished he could still call it that, but he hasn't been able to since..
Tony instantly sobered up. "I know."
..before slipping into darkness.
He stepped towards Steve who barely made it past the door.
"Let's go." Steve initiated but didn’t move a muscle.
It wasn’t until they had stopped far enough away from the baddies' hideout to not be seen but still monitor them that Clint kicked his bike in frustration.
Tony went silent as he remembered Steve's tired face from earlier in the day. "I don't need sleep if you hardly ever get it."
Tony laughed and sat him upright, handing him the sippy cup and picking up a muffin to feed him.
Tony stares down at his wrists, purple bruises forming in the shapes of Steve’s fingers. He still couldn’t find any appropriate words to say so he closes the distance between himself and Steve with a hug. Steve continues to hide his face in his hands but Tony is easing them down so they are lying on the bed. He just about had Steve under him when Steve pushes him away, going to stand by the window, darkness coloured by red clouds filling his vision.
He gave up on explaining the plan quickly. It's not like Cap was one to do something foolish and put them in danger. He could just tell him what's to be done right before they had to do it.
“Nope.” Tony refused. “It’s copyrighted to Tony Stark.”
"Baby.." Steve said after a while.
"That explains a lot. Last thing I remember was seeing bright lights and falling. Thank you by the way for the dim lights. I’m sure someone yelled my name though." Steve retold. Truth is, while Tony went to put Jackie to bed, Steve remembered a lot of things that happened on his mission. He’s very sure it was Tony who yelled his name.
The elevator dinged, signalling their arrival at the correct floor. Steve led them out and down the long hallway, stopping at the end of it in front of a door marked ‘The Presidential Suite’.
Steve takes in a sharp breath at Tony’s touch but still says nothing. “Steve, you’ve been so quiet.” Tony starts. “You didn’t say anything to me at all while we had sex.” He pauses as the memory of Steve inside him but not being his, being completely distracted, comes to his mind. He frowns. “Not even my name.” He buries his face in Steve’s shoulder, resting his hand just above his belly button. Steve turns to face him. “Tony..” He whispers the name, making Tony look up from his shoulder. “Talk to me, honey. What’s bothering you. What’s clouding your mind.” He asks, very concerned.
Breathless. That’s another word to sum up Tony’s day. Steve took his breath away, looking the way he did at dinner, froze his lungs from drawing up air when he revealed his heart to him, made his chest tight every time he reached for his hand and kissed the most valuable anything Tony now owned.
"Tony." He heard Steve call as he bustled around the room, pulling up screens with Jack's temperature and blood pressure one handedly as he refused to let him go.
Everything after the explosion was mostly a blur. He watched SHIELD go through the standard procedures and god knows how he gave his report of the mission. He was back in the jet wearing dry civilian clothes and drinking warm coffee. He must’ve changed to the clothes he had in his bag but he didn't remember. He was vaguely aware of how tired he was and that made sense.
Deep in his thoughts, Tony didn’t notice that Steve left the bathroom until he was scared by him. Steve had snuck up behind him and wrapped his arms around him.
"If you do that, who'll bring home the bacon?" Tony joked as he took hold of Jack's hand to steady himself.
Just, please Steve, make sure he gets to live a good life. With you. You'll be an incredible father; it's just who you are. My single greatest regret is that I won't get to see how good you will be to him. You know how I fell in love with him the second I laid my eyes on him."
"It's important to me because you're my friend." Clint decided to go with honesty. "Because I've noticed this for a while and didn't make sense of it until I saw you practically break."
"Cap. 25 seconds." Clint saw him trading punches with the drug lord. SHIELD intel left out the important detail that the guy was a martial artist. Nothing as great as Cap but he was enough to be considered a threat.
He couldn’t even do anything about it because he couldn't stop Stark from working. Cap wouldn't even want him to interfere and he respected that, truly. The hardest thing was, Steve didn’t deserve to be in so much pain.
"I wanted you to come back to me and that made me feel like the world's biggest hypocrite because that's exactly what I do to you. And I don’t even have reason to." Tony stopped, sobbing quietly at Steve’s shoulder.
"Yes mini me."
Clint looks up at the soldier and can’t decipher his expression. “Cap?” He asks but Steve says nothing, just takes another step towards the archer. Clint eyes the shrinking distance between him and the Captain.  What is he doing? What is he thinking? Steve takes hold of Clint’s wrist and leans into him, stopping only to see if he can go on. Clint is too shocked to produce any reaction and Steve presses forward. He brings his lips to meet Clint’s in a kiss and for a while, he’s sure Clint will kiss him back.
Steve was shocked. A while? "How long was I asleep?"
Tony brushed his nose at the nape of Steve’s neck, breathing in his scent. "Baby.." He inhaled and leaned forward to kiss him, Steve meeting him half way.
“I’m sorry.” Steve whispered at his shoulder. “Thought you could see me coming.”
"That's very impressive. Tell him I'm proud of him. And that I would’ve talked to him were he not napping. Just like I promised."
In the end he decided to style it similarly to how he did on their first date. He was possibly being a tad bit nostalgic. He knew Steve liked it when he styled his hair like that so it was bound to earn him bonus points if he calculated his outfit accurately.
He held him close to his chest, breathing in his scent, and placed a tender kiss to his forehead. He was sobbing so much that he wasn't capable of forming words anymore. But once again, the social worker seemed to understand him as she touched his forearm sympathetically and left him with the baby boy.
"Sorry baby." Tony let go, kissing his soft cheeks. "You want your hot chocolate?"
"How long was I asleep for?" Steve asked as he linked his fingers with Tony's.
Clint only nodded because the dynamics of their relationship were way more complicated than he expected. That had to be a reason for why it was nearly impossible to get between them. They're already experiencing the worst. No way they'll let someone bring them more misery.
Steve shook his head. That will not happen. Tony will make it out of his predicament and he'll be the one to show Thanos that he picked on the wrong guy. But Tony was clear about Jackie. It was obvious to Steve that he missed him, that Tony wanted nothing more than to be holding the baby boy in his arms and rocking him to a sound sleep.
Steve couldn’t help the grin that formed on his lips.
Steve's heart clenched. He too can't sleep well without Tony next to him. It's absolutely painful when he spends days locked away from him in the workshop.
Clint didn’t push, wanting to give Steve the time he looked like he needed to compose himself. He felt terrible now that he's brought it up. Steve was a hundred times sadder than before.
DUM-E came around then with a tray that had the carrot muffins and Jack's hot chocolate.
Tony lost count of the number of times Steve kissed his ring finger as he made love to him. He didn’t blame him; Tony couldn’t believe it either. Surreal was maybe the only word in vocabulary that described how he felt, how he hoped--, no, was sure, Steve felt.
Jack smiled as he sipped his milk.
Steve attached the shield to his back and got on his feet as well, taking in the damage. He could hear Clint talking with the nearby SHIELD helicarrier about the state of the children, the druglord and his henchmen as well as clean up but he paid no attention to that. One thought was on his mind. Tony.
Tony stared after him until he felt Jack pulling on his sleeve. He looked down and Jackie opened his mouth for more muffin.
Tony's eyes filled with sadness and he looked away, breaking a bit of muffin and feeding Jack.
Tony smiled as his heart filled with warmth.
With shaky legs, he made his way to Tony's room and climbed into his bed, surrounded himself with his scent and prayed that the lull of sleep takes over him.
Steve was back where he was and kissed up a trail of smooth warm skin up to Tony's heart. He laid his hand over the blue light and Tony's eyes slipped shut, the both of them listening to the arc reactor's soft hum.
Tony soon lost himself to Steve's lips and soft touch. Steve kissed him and kissed him and kissed him again and he'd never tire of kissing him. All very delicate and soft kisses to even more delicate and softer lips.
Oh! The mission! Riiighht.
He stood up and walked towards Tony, wrapping his arms around him briefly before snatching up his new tux and heading off to the bathroom to get ready for their date.
Protected from the soon coming rain under the roof of the platform, Bucky very smugly sets up his sniper rifle and takes aim. “You’re better in your dreams, Barnes!” Clint takes aim as well and fires his gun,  hitting the target in the very centre. He turns sideways to smirk at his boyfriend who sticks his tongue out and fires away. “Ha! You missed!” Clint exclaims, readying his rifle for a second shot. “What are you talking about?! That’s a bullseye!” Bucky complains, refusing to lose to the archer.
Jack turned over his sippy cup and shook it, letting Tony know that it's empty.
Steve got up and checked his small mission bag again. He was sure he had everything but he liked to be on the safe side.
Steve just stared at Clint. He wasn't sure where this was coming from or even that Clint would make that connection. He assumed Clint thought the tears were because of his nightmare.
“Still.” Tony untangled one hand and reached back to catch Steve’s windswept hair and pushed it to the side. He rose on his toes and placed a single kiss in the crook of his neck. Steve shivered; Tony smirked in triumph.
Steve didn't so much as blink.
"It's Papa's way of showing you that he likes what you said." Steve clarified, Jack quickly nodding his understanding like the smart boy he is.
He felt Steve’s laugh through his back before he heard it. “You must’ve had such low standards.”
Clint got on his bike as well. Being out of the shade of the ancient tree, the rain soaked him back in seconds.
Clint snuggles close to Bucky, resting his head on his chest. “Me having two boyfriends, you and Tony having three, Steve having two… How did that happen?” Bucky sighs and listens to the still falling rain for a while. “It’s what makes happy.” “Steve isn’t happy. I didn’t kiss him. He was so heartbroken.” Clint’s voice cracks at the last word. Bucky’s hand brushes his hair, his lips pressing to the blond hair.
They were shaken to their very foundation, and he couldn't even find it within him to feel ashamed for crumbling in front of them. Hadn't he suffered enough?
"You all right Cap?" He asked in a shaky voice.
"Nothing's wrong here Cap." Clint replied, braving his hurt feelings.
Eyes following Steve toss his jacket, Tony’s heart fluttered at Steve’s use of his nickname for him. He’ll never admit it. “Nope. You can’t use that. It’s mine.”
“Steve..” Tony mutters to the ever increasing rain. “I feel every beat, just about rushing. Expecting..” The brush of his lips on Tony’s neck does increase his pulse. “Are you gonna keep me waiting?” Tony asks true to his snarky persona. Steve answers by parting his lips very slightly and kissing Tony’s neck. He can feel Tony’s breath as he shuts his eyes and inhales deeply at the tingling sensation. Steve kisses him again and Tony responds in the same way, drawing in another breath and making Steve kiss that rising pulse point again. Tony’s arm comes around the back of Steve’s head, never pushing or forcing but letting him know that he can take it a step further. Steve moves his lips, kissing the entire length of Tony’s neck before sinking his teeth lightly on the exposed collar bone, making Tony visibly shudder under his touch.
Clint sits on the couch of the main living room of the tower, watching TV. He’s not paying attention to the animal show currently on. His mind is further elsewhere. Since Bucky dragged him down, Clint planted himself, cross legged on his favourite couch and has been thinking about exactly just what to say to the Captain. He runs over multiple possibilities of what he can but none are sounding right to him. Bucky makes his way over to him with a bag of chips and a bottle of coke and crashes down next to Clint, immediately reaching for the remote and flipping through the channels.
"Tony."
, I always knew you'd be there for me when I did call." Tony felt the first tear sting as it spilt over his eyelashes.
"I need you."
Steve didn’t comment though he couldn't have possibly missed the loud clang. He went about finding cover from the rain under the dense branches of an ancient tree. He pulled his sketchbook and pencil out and sat on his bag after making sure his phone was tucked away safely in his utility belt.
"Open for Jackie." Jack giggled adorably, lifting his hands away.
Steve stopped caring about what happens to him ever since he jumped out of the tower’s balcony when he couldn’t stop having nightmares about Bucky’s fall. He landed mostly unhurt as he slowed down his fall but it’s the thought that Steve was willing to leave him forever that frightens Tony. So it wasn’t far fetched to him that his husband would do more than just hurt if he lost him.
"I want to make love to you." Steve murmured at his ear lobe.
Steve lays awake in bed with Tony’s arms wrapping him in a loose hug. He isn’t dressed as isn’t Tony. They drifted to sleep in each other’s arms soon after the rain streaked window turned it’s watchful eyes away. He wants to listen to Tony’s every breath but the multiple sounds of the city below are interrupting the chorus of Tony’s gentle even breathing. He takes holds of Tony’s wrist by his hip and turns it over. The imprint of Steve’s fingers still present on the fair skin. Slowly and carefully, he brings the genius’s hand higher up and kisses the mark he left.
Steve pulled Tony’s arms tighter around him to give him more of his body heat. “I didn’t want to disturb your beauty sleep.”
He decided that making love to Tony the way he wanted for a while could be doable if he eased himself into it. That is when he familiarized himself with his husband all over again.
He brushed his hand through Jackie's hair. "Baby?"
Bucky bites the inside of his lip as he thinks. “Do you think it’s because Steve still feels bad and he knows you must be as well?” Clint nods. “I don’t think he left his room after you told me that he locked himself up.” Bucky lowers his mug as his eyes ask the question. “I know because it’s way too quiet. It’s never this quiet when Tony is up.” Clint theorizes that Tony must still be with Steve in his room and not down in his workshop blasting his music away. “Could be. He’ll definitely be there for Steve.” Bucky says, bringing his mug up to his lips.
Steve’s eyebrows furrowed. What did he mean he didn't sound all right?
"Huh." Very eloquent Tony. But hey, isn't that something. Jack just happened to get lucky and put in the correct pass code in one try.
Steve drops his gaze to their hands. “Yesterday when I kissed you..” He shuts his eyes and tries again. “We’ve been spending a lot of time together and I thought that.. that..” Steve sighs, unable to say the words racing in his head. “That what?” Clint pushes with another small step toward the chest that nearly knocked him over. “That you might like me.” Steve finishes his sentence, daring a glance up at the archer’s blues that widen before his eyes. “You could tell?” Clint asks, clearly not expecting Steve to confront him. The Captain nods. “I like you as well. That’s why I was as bold as I was because I can’t stop thinking about the things you say to me or how you can make me laugh. I never thought that I..” Steve looks away, the rest of the confession hanging in his throat.
"Tony.." Steve breathed, unaware that he's on his knees on the ground. He'd sunk down to his knees hard enough to have hurt them if he were still the way he was born, and he hadn't realized. He sobbed, and only then did he become aware of the tears streaking his cheeks. He hadn't noticed that he'd been crying as well. "Oh, God." He gasped as another sob shook his shoulders.
"Hello!" Jack greeted excitedly, bouncing on Steve's chest a little.
He shrugged. "When you haven't talked to someone for a long while, it comes back so easily and you click right back into place. It's always like that. Missing him, crying, and then it's all perfect until he leaves me for his workshop again."
“About what?” Steve wondered as he threaded his fingers through Tony’s.
Tony would've wanted to hold him, just the way he had the first time. He'd spent a long time with him that they had to be asked to leave. They laughed it off and promised to be back later. Only, Steve never imagined that he'd come back on his own. He swiped his index finger under his eye to catch a tear before it splashed onto Jackie's blankets.
Tony moved quickly not waiting for Jack to answer, getting one of Jack's many spare blankets in their room and wrapping him up tightly. He was also firing commands at JARVIS to check his temperature and vitals and to have DUM-E prepare him some warm milk and hot chocolate because that was Jackie's favourite.
Tony began making his way around the small apartment in search of Steve. He was nowhere to be found in the washroom or the kitchen and not in the living room, although the strong and most welcome smell of coffee carried on the night breeze was giving a clue to Steve’s whereabouts. He turned on his heel and headed in the direction the smell was coming from and ended up walking in the direction of the balcony.
"Aww no baby." Steve cooed softly behind Tony. "It's a good thing he told you."
As if pulled to him like opposite ends of a magnet, Tony sauntered forward, his silk robe flowing around him, until his chest made contact with the expanse of Steve’s back. Steve jumped a fraction, imperceptible to another looking upon if it weren’t for Tony’s cheek against his back.
Tony stood frozen, staring into the most beautiful blue eyes he’s ever seen, speechless in the eloquence of Steve’s words, petrified in fear of not being enough for all the elegance and grace that is Steve Rogers.
He pressed his forehead to Tony's and shut his eyes. "It's unbearable being away from you."
Steve shook his head as he laughed as the cup’s reign as king of the balcony’s railing came to an end while he got a better grip on Tony’s hips and lifted him off. Tony’s instinctively wound his arms around Steve’s neck as he carried him towards the bedroom. Once he stood in front of the bed, Steve lowered Tony down onto the mattress and hovered over him.
"I couldn't." Steve took Tony's hand that's cupping his cheek and held it in his delicately as if it was fragile, wanting nothing more than to know that Tony's right here in front of him.
"27 hours." Tony answered, chin hooked over Steve's shoulder.
Steve pressed a quick kiss to his lips, one that was over before Tony had the chance to react. “By the end of the night.”
Tony suddenly felt so vulnerable, worse than he's ever felt stripped of his armor. Here was Jack drinking his favourite drink, completely oblivious to the fact that he may have been in danger had he not decided to come to their room.
Clint didn't watch him so much anymore. Or he tried but he kept glancing to his right every once in a while to only see about a quarter of Steve's face.
"That's it Cap." Clint grinned his way. "You'll be back to your family in no time if you spend the time having fun."
The way he was himself, no shame.
"Hey Cap." Tony began, making a point of looking away from the piercing eyes of the mark 50's helmet, as if in fear that Steve would be looking through them at his soul.
He made the mistake of imaging Tony as he recorded the message and shuddered. Tony does not accept defeat. And Steve refrains from idea that Tony will succumb to his situation. But he didn't even know what his situation was. A few terrifying scenarios crossed his mind and he winced, turning over onto his side and curling in on himself.
Steve nuzzled against Tony's neck and moved his hand, stroking the both of them.
Steve gave his hands a gentle squeeze. "When I laughed earlier, it's because he was there, he was talking to me about what Jackie did and the weather and how the mission was going."
He was pulled out of his own head again as the glass door to his workshop unlocked and Steve came into view. He looked tired and definitely upset. Tony knew the reason for the latter. The first making sense as well if the clock above the door was any indication. It was 3:17AM. Usually, Steve would be up in less than two hours so it made sense that he looked tired. Tony figured his constant worrying about him wasn't doing so well for his sleeping either.
Steve, when he was last with Tony behind closed doors, made love to him like he knew something was wrong. He made a point to kiss him the entire time as he held him close between the comfort of his arms. He manoeuvred Tony so that he straddled his hips and Steve held onto his like he was holding on for his life, strong enough to darken the skin under his fingers.
Tony couldn’t even protest because every time he tried, Steve’s lips sealed his own.
Steve shook his head, breaking eye contact with him.
Tony understood and pulled Steve's hand away from their members. He laced his fingers through Steve's and took hold of them again.
He opens the door but Steve’s hand slams it closed. He takes Tony’s wrists to lead him to sit back down on the bed and gasps, recognizing his own fingers bruising Tony’s wrists. He lips are parted but there will never be any words to make this right. Tony slips his wrists out of Steve’s loose hold and turns to face the door. Steve presses up behind him and Tony becomes very aware of Steve’s stomach muscles touching his back. They didn’t have time for clothes before it all went to hell. Tony steps forward, away from the soldier’s warmth but there isn’t much space and he ends up hitting the door with a small thud. Steve fills the step the genius had taken, wrapping his arms around his stomach. He drops his forehead on Tony’s left shoulder and Tony can feel him shaking. His tears resume their rain, this time catching on the soft skin of Tony’s shoulder instead of his hands.
Steve pulls away from the sweet smell of Tony to look into his eyes as he backs away from the chair and heads towards the bed. Steve stands up and follows him, watching Tony sit down first then lie back, inviting Steve in. Steve climbs up to trap Tony under his body. Hands on either side of his head and legs on the outside of his own. Tony reaches up in the darkness of the room and slips his finger under the collar of Steve’s shirt, hooking it in the metal chain Steve always wore. He pulls on it a little forcing Steve to follow the movement and cover his body with his larger frame.
Tony's been locked up in the workshop for days with nothing but coffee and the various meals Steve sneaks onto his desk when he's too busy tinkering with something.
Tony didn’t realize it at the beginning but he too could do without the urgency that he felt when Steve first walked into his workshop.
Laying and hugging himself close under the blanket like he was, he couldn't help but remember the comfort of Steve's arms around him and the welcome warmth his body provides as he curls up behind him, protecting him with his body just as much as he often protected him with his shield.
Steve reached forward and adjusted them. "Next time you can't sleep well, you come to me and Papa okay?"
"Papa? How Adad talk when he sleeping?" Jack asked. And wasn't that the cutest thing ever.
"I should go." Steve whispered at Tony’s nape, hands on his shoulders.
Tony’s wearing Steve’s favourite sweater and it’s too big on him. “Raided the Captain’s closet again, Tony?” Clint asks when Steve and Tony are close enough to hear him. “I’m cold. Besides, it smells like Steve. Of course I’m gonna steal it.” Tony brags, letting go of Steve’s hand and jumping onto Bucky as soon as they are under the roofed section where the rifles sit. “Hey.” Bucky greets quietly, both hands steadying Tony who’s wrapped himself around his body. “Hi.” Tony smiles and brushes his nose against Bucky’s.
He met his eyes and did Clint look scared?
He loves Tony. He loves him with every fibre of his being, super soldier or not. The ring matching Tony’s on his own left hand serving as proof. He’s always loved Bucky as well. And Tony agreed to marry him despite him being in a relationship with his best friend. The both of them were really good at that, understanding that Steve was in love with the both of them equally. But what he’s done now might’ve ruined everything.
"Are Captain Rogers and Master Jack included in the list of those you wish to not disturb you, sir?" JARVIS asked, knowing Steve's been waiting outside the workshop for hours with his sketchbook and the noise of Tony working. Jack, Steve and Tony's son was sleeping peacefully under JARVIS's constant watch. Truth is, not only is Steve worried but Clint texted him earlier telling him that they're leaving for BC at dawn. Steve was already awake so it wasn't a problem and decided to spend the few hours next to Tony at least. You know if he won't come to bed.
It wasn't because he didn't care; it was because he cared too much. He still had obligations and duties to fulfil, for himself and for everyone counting on him. If he'd allowed himself to breach the edge into that line of thought, he'd be compromised. Tony means the world to him, had meant it before their fight and had meant it even more after. Perhaps that was another reason why he hadn't allowed himself to wonder, because he'd know if anything happened to Tony.
Steve shut his eyes and shook his head. “You seem intrigued.”
Steve returned his kiss just as gently, his eyes fluttering half shut and his free hand coming up to hold the back of Tony's neck to him, the other only tightening around Tony’s fingers, bringing his hand closer to his chest.
The smell took Steve back to Tony. It was his favourite blend. He had it everywhere there was a coffee machine. The jet obviously not being an exception.
Clint ran his fingers through his hair, just then also catching Steve's eyes. They didn’t break eye contact and Steve was still talking with Stark.
"Adad you go to get bad guy?" Jackie asked as Steve strapped the shield to his back.
Steve was thinking about his response when Clint’s lips touched his.
Tony bit his lip as his eyes began to sting. This is hard. "There's so much that I should tell you, so much that I owe you, and so much more that I need to apologize for." He bit his lip harder. "I was wrong. I was so wrong, Steve. Wrong to ever think that I could do this without you. Wrong to ever allow myself to believe that I'll be okay with the Avengers split. Wrong to ever let you walk away with Barnes when you did." Tony tightened the blanket around his shoulders when the memory of Siberia threatened to resurface.
"Are you in a hurry Cap? Cause unfortunately we've got about three more hours before we reach B.C." Clint joked then instantly kicked himself for it because Cap looked sad all over again.
Tony laughed, head thrown back and joy contagious. "Why would I be upset? Clint came and told me without being asked. You told me as well. I knew you would tell me even if I didn't bring it up."
"May love you." Tony corrected with a smile.
Steve opened his eyes. Did Tony just say what he thought he did? "What are you talking about baby?"
Steve walked in, sketchbook tucked under his arm and his hands in the pockets of his sweatpants that he wore to bed.
“I wouldn’t have you close.” Tony kissed Steve again, higher up on his neck.
Steve followed him and they were soon riding side by side. He sensed the tension taking over Clint’s form.
It was all too much for him, how at the same time, this felt familiar yet so strange and unknown like walking into an unfamiliar place. Not knowing your footing but at the same time, like knowing every corner of your home blindly. Maybe that’s how his relationship with Tony will always be.
"Why? Tell you as what? Why is it even so important to you?" Steve bit in return. It wasn’t his intention but this is his weakness. This is the conversation that if they had and turned south could mean him and Tony separating with no return.
Steve took the tray and set it down next to them on the bed.
“You tricked me.” Steve accused as he moved to kiss under Tony’s earlobe.
Boy, did Tony love it when Steve held him close by his neck, wordlessly claiming Tony his. Or the way he put Tony’s hand next to his heart, letting him know that his heart is Tony’s without having to put it into words. Because if Tony knew anything about Steve, it’s that words were never enough to describe his feelings for Tony. The same Tony who was didn’t deserve any of it as reward for his horrible actions towards his husband.
"Looks like I can't drive when it's raining." He quipped at himself.
Steve’s lips parted in awe. Tony looked down at his lap and smiled.
Steve suddenly lifted his lips from Tony's and was moving away, causing Tony to worry a little. He didn’t want him going anywhere. Steve paused as he sat up and removed his shirt before hovering over his lover again. Steve's hand traveled down Tony's torso to slow down and rest just above his belt. His lips slotted themselves behind Tony's ear.
Tony's already quickening breath leaped. He nodded quickly. "Yes. Baby.. I want that. You. I want you Steve. I want you to make love to me."
"Where to?" He asked, his voice breaking on the last syllable. Good job Stark. Way to woo Steve before he goes away on a mission that may last days. Then again, Steve didn’t specify the nature of the mission or whether anyone else was going.
He chuckled sadly. "Same with you, you patriotic hunk of muscle wrapped in an American flag." He allows himself to tease, because what more can he lose. And this is Steve, his Steve. No amount of time or distance between them is going to change how he feels about him.
"Steve. It's okay if you don't.." He cut himself off because how was he supposed to tell him that yeah I get it. You love me so much and you've missed me so much that at this point, the simplest of touches are way more important to you than fucking me.
"What did you talk about?" Tony smirked again but this one was directly at the corner of Steve’s mouth.
Steve nodded and sped up his hand marginally but Tony reacted. He clutched Steve's biceps and had his eyes squeezed shut, focusing solely on Steve's touch.
Jack yawned. "Forgibe you if I has candies."
"Just him?" Tony asked, brushing his thumb over Steve’s wrist.
Tony looked up at him.
Tony felt a kiss on the back of his hand as Steve brought his hand up to his lips. “My internal clock says it’s time to wake up. All the different time zones we visited are messing with it.”
"I've been seeing it for a while. You’d be tired and looking like you have half the strength you have for a couple of days. And then you'd be yourself again and everything would be fine. Or seem fine. Strange pattern don't you think? Not to mention it coinciding with Stark's trips to the workshop that last weeks." Clint couldn’t stop. Now that he's started, he needed to let it out. Needed to let Steve know that he felt for him and that he didn’t need to keep whatever this was between him and Stark a secret. He could talk about it to Clint. And even though he much rather prefered that he was the one in a relationship with Steve, he would definitely do all that he can to see him happy all the time. Not just in a weird pattern that depended on Stark.
So they spent the bike ride listening to engine roars and heavy rain battering the thick trees around them.
His hand drifted from atop his knee and splayed on the Wakandan dirt next to him; the very same dirt that was now mixed with the remains of his friend, his brother, Bucky.
"I missed you too." He returned on a murmur, meeting Tony's eyes again.
He disengaged the seatbelts and summoned the strength to exit the jet. The compound was empty, so that wasn't why he was weary. He was weary because he was about to be flooded with another wave from behind the broken dam. He took a deep breath, squared his shoulders and made his way inside.
Steve rubbed his back in an effort to calm him a little. He wasn't in a better case either. His heart yearning to make Tony feel better.
Steve didn't ask though, just turned his head to look out his side window again, finger tracing the path of a raindrop.
Thankfully, Clint only nodded in silent understanding. "Well we've been here for a while; it's just not time to move close to the target yet."
There were two very terrible snipers that they don't even deserve the title and Clint eliminated their threat efficiently before moving into the building easily, Cap having drawn out all the henchmen and was dropping them like dominos.
"I don’t ever need you apologizing to me. I never blamed you. I just hoped that you'd give me the same attention you give your creations." Steve admitted, his tears spilling.
He didn't have to go on though as Steve's lips found their way to his again.
“Just because you’re not actually watching the TV, doesn’t mean you get to bore me out of my mind by putting on a channel that shows documentaries about the possibility of penguins being homosexual.” Bucky spits out in one breath. Clint isn’t listening but the last part of Bucky’s complaint catches his attention. “Penguins are what?!” “Homosexual. That was the documentary that you were boring me with.” Bucky clears up, choosing a movie he finds interesting and lying back against the back cushions.
Clint and Steve watch as they run under the pouring rain with content smiles colouring their faces. Bucky chases Tony all the way to the entrance of the tower where they lose sight of them. Clint turns to face the soldier.  ”Wanna give it a try?” He asks, patting the sniper rifle in front of him. Steve’s eyes widen and he shakes his head. “No way. Not me.” He answers honestly, his smile audible in his voice. “Not in everybody’s interests, I guess.” “Maybe not. But bikes are in both of our interests.” Steve tries to make small talk but he can feel the awkwardness hanging in the air.
He was aware of Steve’s tap on the small of his back and  opened his eyes looking down at Steve to realize that he was practically using him as a mattress. "Sorry." He mumbled, lifting himself off Steve to sit next to him. He saw that the explosion managed to knock the druglord unconscious.
Steve had control and resumed his perfect strokes to the both of them.
Tony’s eyes lingered on the words Steve used to sign his letter. Yours. He only wished he was a fraction as elaborate as him to convey how much he reciprocated the sentiment. Folding the letter neatly back into its envelope, he took a large gulp of his once-again cold coffee and proceeded to grab for the first document he saw, newly invigorated to get his work done.
The bed shifted under a new weight. Tony. Steve reached out for his hand automatically.
Steve didn’t push it. If Clint didn’t want to talk, he could certainly understand that. Maybe he'll share when he felt comfortable enough.
Steve beat the robot and crawled into bed next to his husband and son, wrapping the blanket around Jack's shoulders.
God, Tony could kiss his husband forever and never want anything else. Steve continuously proved that to him.
His attention was caught by a shelf against the wall beside the door. It was full of little things that Tony found either interesting or precious. Steve remembered most of them, but they weren't arranged in the way they were now. There were a few new additions: a small teddy bear, the BARF glasses, a piece of paper with mathematical equations, a small mannequin wearing a black and red tracksuit, and an Iron Man helmet.
Tony simply nodded. It surprised him why he got so sad when he knew Steve was leaving. Maybe it was the quality family time they just had and were having did he not have to leave.
Tony knew that he was holding back his tears. He was doing the same.
“That you what?” Clint asks then runs over what Steve just said. I make him laugh? His mind smiles at him in his thoughts. And he can’t stop thinking about what I say? He shakes his head, trying to quiet the voice in it. Steve remains silent, turned towards Tony and Bucky who’ve gone very still. “Steve. That you what?” Clint repeats, his expression pleading that Steve have mercy and tell him. Steve’s upper lip curls catches between his teeth as he tries to say what he wishes to. He exchanges looks with Bucky and Tony who nod to him, encouraging him on.
Tony appeared unconvinced as he narrowed his eyes and pulled away a further fraction. “When?”
Tony looked up at their reflection in the glass of the window. “I should’ve, but I didn’t.”
Tony, who went out of his way to send a message to Steve to let him know his status, who practically gave him instructions on what he wanted him to do if..
The door to their bedroom slid open behind them then and they both tensed, breaking away from each other’s lips and loosening the tight embrace. Nobody ever came up to their room. Besides, all the doors in the tower were automatic. JARVIS wouldn't open the door to just anyone without asking them.
When he was physically exhausted, the serum kept him on his feet but at the cost of blurring reality and dreams together so he ended up in this fuzzy state. This is definitely the toll of many days without proper sleep. His eight hours nap earlier not doing much to replenish his energy. And after a mission, unlike when he’s at home where he got a few hours in and at least no physical exersion, this was how things were to be for a while unfortunately.
"It's hard to see if you don’t know all the facts." Steve whispered, sounding defeated. "I'm not me. This is a ghost of me."
"Shower with me." Steve offered, head on Tony's chest.
Tony’s heart lurched at being asked despite what he's been doing to Steve and he quickly reminded himself of his promise. "Whatever it is that you want to do. I'm with you."
"God, Steve.." He whispered, hot breath against Steve's hand. "I missed this. I missed you."
Tony moans quietly and arches his hips up into Steve’s. Steve pulls away from his lips to ghost over his neck. Tony holds onto Steve’s hands tightly and Steve returns the favour with a little too much vigour. Tony welcomes the pain, distracting him from the purple bruises painting his wrists. He wants Steve now that he’s himself, with only his dark haired and brown eyed self on his mind. He touches his hips to Steve’s again and Steve moves, stalking his way lower down Tony’s body. Tony’s eyes flutter shut, focusing his other senses. The window and it’s never drying streaks of rain in the red darkness still watch them.
Tony pokes Steve in the middle of his chest “Finally decided that I’m right?” He teases, bringing a grin to the Captain’s face. Steve pulls Tony to him and under the heavy spray of water. “Is it that obvious?” He asks, looking over Tony’s shoulder. “Mhmm.” He hears Tony say in response. “You’re you again baby.” Tony props his chin onto Steve’s shoulder. “It’s more than obvious. It’s my Steve.” Steve smiles wide to the wall in front of him. Tony laughs and reaches to his right side for shampoo. Steve shuts his eyes and relaxes under Tony’s fingers, warmth and sweetness filling his heart.
“What am I missing Bucky? I was in the middle of..” Tony leaves his sentence unfinished as he takes in what’s transpiring in front of him. “Oh this is good.” He amuses, making his way around Clint and Steve to throw himself into Bucky’s lap. He shuffles around to get comfy to watch his husband and boyfriend and steals Bucky’s chips.
Steve knows he should do something about Tony's habits but when has Tony ever actually listened to him when he suggested something.
Clint caught Cap's smile out of the corner of his eye and couldn’t help but smile as well. "Yeah it's only gonna get worse."
Steve’s eyebrows rose in surprise. How did Clint know where Jack was?
He heard Tony’s short snarky laugh.
"Papa!" Jack ran over to them and Tony reached forward and picked him up, hugging him to his chest.
"Not want." Jack shook his head. "Want chocowate."
"Yeah." Tony felt guilty. Not that he didn't every time he left Steve and Jack for days but the fact that Steve, his Steve, was quietly waiting outside his workshop for nearly four hours was a kick to the stomach. And Tony knew what those felt like. He got out of the bathroom on autopilot and waited outside.
"Then you called him like your life depended on it and you were laughing. I don't understand your relationship. I can't understand it."
"Was like magic Adad." Jack nodded. "I press the tiny buttons and big door open."
"When he works for days on end without so much as letting me see him or hear his voice talking to me... I feel like every atom of my body is itching for him, missing him on a level that I can't even comprehend."
Clint makes his way over to the kitchen to pick up his tea while Bucky forces himself to get to the bathroom. He takes a sip of the warm tea but has to set his mug down when JARVIS cues his favourite song. He swings around the room to the beat when Bucky emerges from the bathroom smelling of toothpaste. “You’re in a happy mood.” Bucky notices, stepping behind Clint to reach his mug of black coffee. “Yeah. I woke up to JARVIS playing my favourites. Must be Tony.” Clint stops dancing and joins Bucky at the kitchen counter, taking another sip of tea.
Using the extra help from Tony, Steve twisted up again and Tony tensed up, eyes shut and lips parted on a silent gasp as he reached his completion.
Clint tilted his head up again. "Please don't stop."
"I love you." Steve whispered in return, pressing a kiss to the speaker then hanging up.
Steve tucked his face into the crook of Tony’s neck and  inhaled. “Hi.”
Steve tried to contain his smile and didn’t offer Tony an answer. Tony stared at him but Steve didn’t relent.
Tony turned in Steve’s arms and looped his around Steve’s neck. “Why are we here Steve?”
Steve was the addict, Tony the addictive in small dosage. It's finally been switched around and Tony gets what it must always feel like for his love. He's glad.
Clint didn’t know how long he lay protectively over Steve with the shield in front of him.
Clint was far away to be safe but Cap wasn't moving. He was still taking out henchmen.
Immediately, he regretted his actions. The sheet had been protecting him from the breezy late night air that now mercilessly attacked his bare skin. He grabbed the sheet and drew it around his shoulders as the breezy air jogged his memory as to why he was naked. He immediately blamed Steve who stripped him of his clothes and in tradition, claimed the rented apartment theirs by making love to Tony on the tiny bed; even though it was him who initiated the circumstances, as per his unspoken tradition, which he’d never admit to Steve but guessed he already knew.
He lifted his head from his knees and looked at the dust-ridden field around him. The others have long since left but he couldn't will his legs to move after they gave out from under him when Thor couldn't answer his questions.
They lost track of time as they paid attention to each other so deliberately unhurried, Tony’s earlier eagerness tamed by the notion that they have all the remaining time of the night when suddenly Steve’s attention was drawn away from Tony by a quickly moving light. He looked up and saw a passing car.
He lays back on the bed and Steve follows him, climbing over him and kissing him more passionately than ever. “I love you.” He mutters against Tony’s lips, fingers threading through his on either side of his head.  Tony laughs and it sounds stunning. “I know. I know you’ll always love me.” He steals a kiss from Steve’s lips. “I have multiple bruises to prove it.” Tony smirks, digging his nails in the back of Steve’s hands. Steve smiles and kisses him slowly, savouring the taste of his lips, his metal chain dangling over Tony’s arc reactor.
Steve returned his kiss then pulled away to look into his eyes. “Yes.” He confirmed and kissed Tony deeper.
Tony’s look of pure bewilderment was astonishing. “Why?” He’d forgotten how he had the idea of getting a room before they started dinner. In his defence though, Steve was distracting.
"BC. Scout and take down a drug operation using children. It shouldn't be long if intel is accurate." Steve stepped closer as he finished, nearly trapping Tony even though there was nothing but open air around them.
Steve is panting heavily as he crumbles next to Tony. Something about the way he sounds worries him and he turns over to press his chest into Steve’s side. Steve glances over at Tony and grabs his hand, bringing it up to his lips and kissing it very softly. The gentleness of the action almost shatters Tony’s heart and he flicks his wrist to cup Steve’s face. He shuts his eyes and leans into Tony’s hand but the way he looks is far from peaceful. He looks pained and Tony absolutely hates it. He brushes his thumb over Steve’s cheek and to his surprise, Steve winces.
"Copy." Steve acknowledged but didn’t move still. The drug lord was not going down easily.
“It’s a little bit off centre.” Clint fires his second round just as those clouds began to rain slowly. Bucky rolls his eyes and fires at Clint’s target, hitting the bullseye again. He winks when Clint turns to look at him, clearly confused but impressed.  "Admit it.“ Bucky orders, his eyes glinting with joy at the expression on his boyfriend’s face. Clint shakes his head, "Nope. Never going to.” and fires again for practice. “Because you’re jealous!” Bucky supplies, over confident of his own skill.He earns a cocked eyebrow from Clint. “Come on! You are! I’ve been a sniper a lot longer than you have!” “Doesn’t make me feel jealous. Not denying that you’re really good either.” The archer compliments as both he and Bucky spot Steve and Tony walking hand in hand out into the range.
Tony moaned quietly at his lips and Steve looked into his eyes. It wasn’t often that Tony held back on being a little vocal.
"Yeah. We'll be moving soon." Steve paused, waiting for Tony's answer. "It is still raining. Probably worse here than where you are." Steve said then laughed.
But he honestly just wanted to help. It's not like his hopes for him and Cap getting together were that high. Maybe if he knew then he could talk to Stark about the proper way to treat the gem that he had.
That was it. If Clint thought he'd gotten Steve to loosen up earlier, well that just laughed in his face. The way he just laughed while talking to Stark, all loud and bubbly and beautiful and full of reckless abandon at something that possibly wasn't really all that funny, told Clint why he couldn't be the one for Steve. Why it had to be Stark who got the prize because people don't let go and open their chests up to just anyone. And Clint just witnessed firsthand what Steve's like when he lets his guards down. He’s never done that with Clint. It couldn't ever be him no matter how safe and at home he felt with Steve or no matter how wide he opened his chest for him. Nope. It had to be Stark.
The bright lights of the jet turned down and Steve opened his eyes to find Clint hovering above him.
“I love you.” Clint whispers, returning Steve’s affection. Steve’s smile widens and more tears run down his cheeks. He tilts his head, leaning down a little, and presses his lips to Clint’s. Clint kisses him back softly, simply brushing his lips against his. But it’s enough. It’s him and it’s Steve and it’s their first kiss and it’s right. Steve’s hands return to Clint’s hips and Clint’s loop around his neck, inviting him in. Steve kisses him slowly as if in promise that they’ll have all the time in the world to do exactly this. Clint smiles at Steve’s lips, pulling away hesitantly. Steve cups his face, thumbs brushing away the last of his tears. “I love you.” He reminds Clint who laughs and pulls Steve’s neck towards him, touching their foreheads. “I have a feeling you’ll be reminding me of that a lot.” He jokes. Steve chuckles and motions for Tony and Bucky to join them. They rise from the couch together and walk hand-in-hand towards Clint and Steve. Bucky wraps his arms around Steve’s waist, landing kisses to his neck. Tony holds Clint close to his chest and kisses between his shoulder blades. Steve and Clint smile at Bucky and Tony’s approval before Clint takes Steve’s lips between his again, returning his promise of forever.
"YAAAS!" Jack roared, causing Steve to laugh.
"You're right. It is difficult to understand." Steve admitted, looking out through the trees for any sign of the baddies.
Tony tore off another piece and fed it to him.
"I not like." Jackie crawled up Steve's chest further and put his hands over Steve's eyes.
Tony got closer and brushed his thumbs under Steve's eyes and over his cheekbones until he smiled. "I promised to make it up to him. You can help. But now you're going to put on the handsome new tux I had tailored for you and we're going out to dinner."
Steve opened his eyes and met Tony’s who smiled at him. He smiled back and pressed a kiss to the top of his head.
It took Tony a while to register that Steve was speaking after the shudder went through him completely.
They turned around, Steve still partially in Tony's arms.
Tony tilted his head back, biting onto his lower lip, his left hand coming up to tangle in the hair at Steve's nape.
A tear splashing onto Tony's arm returned him to reality. He went to wipe it away and realized that he was comforting himself the way Steve so often comforted him, tracing the barely visible lines of his veins.
"Wh..What?!" sputtered Tony as he washed his hands. "How long has he been there?"
"10 seconds. Cap you need to move!" Clint shouted over the comm.
“Yeah? You’re not hiding from me in there?” Tony joked, turning his ear to the door. He heard Steve’s chuckle.
Steve pressed his nose just off the nape of Tony's neck and kissed behind his ear. "You have me sweetheart. You've always had me."
Tony opened his eyes and kissed Steve, no questions asked.
He heard Tony tell JARVIS to connect Jackie's room's security footage to his phone as he put on his tux. It really was a work of art chosen by the most talented mechanical artist he's ever known.
Clint exhales and focuses his attention on Bucky and Tony. “Get a room!” He yells and Tony laughs. “We intend to!” “Get on with it then!” Steve joins and his words make Bucky ease Tony off his hips and onto his feet. He keeps a hold of his hand as he steps forward to kiss Clint and shortly after, Steve. Tony copies Bucky and kisses the two blonds before tugging Bucky under the rain and towards the tower. “Wait!” Clint calls as he is taking off Bucky’s jacket. “Don’t forget your jacket.” He says as he hands it to Bucky. “You sure you don’t want it?” Bucky asks taking a hold of his jacket. “Yeah. Absolutely.” He nods, earning Bucky’s wide grin in response before Tony pulls on his hand again.
Clint sighs deeply into the soldier’s chest. “I can’t ever bring myself to say it even if I wanted to.” “I did say that Tony and I would help.” Bucky reminds him with a sing - song voice, his smile evident to Clint’s ears. Clint looks up into the bright blue eyes. “Are you sure he’ll listen? He must really hate me now.” Bucky pecks Clint’s lips. “I’m sure. And he doesn’t. He just expected differently.” Clint’s fingers fist tightly in Bucky’s shirt in worry. Bucky’s metal fingers follow his to wrap them softly in his own. “It’s gonna turn out to be the best conversation you’ll ever have with Stevie.”
He didn’t have the luxury of time to think about it philosophically now, not when Steve was likely already ready, so he pushed the thought away and proceeded to wash up.
He pulled his lips away and drew Steve closer to rest his forehead against his. Panting, he whispered, "Don't. Don't you for half a second think that anything you could say to me would hurt me. Not with everything that I've done to you."
Clint would only come off as the bad guy trying to ruin their marriage by having feelings for Steve.
He could see from the elevation of their track that the drug lord was sorting out the kids outside his shabby hideout. He was pointing everywhere and it looked like he was yelling. Strange for the drug lord to be doing the henchmen's work but whatever. Clint and Cap were going to bring everyone in anyway.
They were both moved like they were never before; Steve's rhythm, while slow and gentle, the very meaning of making love, was faltering, Tony was beyond the ability to say anything as he switched between indulging Steve with the kisses he demanded with red lips and focusing on how he felt within him. They knew it wouldn't last nearly long enough and they chased each other with their release.
He chuckled dryly, wiping the back of his hand against his cheek. "That's me, Tony Stark, always demanding so much of you. But you never let me down, not once. I know you won't."
He was going to be late. FRIDAY informed him that ETA to Steve’s destination was 6:54 PM if he left now. He wasn’t done with his hair yet and he didn’t know how he should style it. It really didn’t help him concentrate how she kept updating his ETA every two minutes.
Jack yawned adorably. "He say that if Jackie stay on balcony, Jackie become Jackie popsicle."
He was perfect. He resembled the both of them enough, that he could be their son. But none of that ever happened. His fairy tale ending with Steve was spoiled before the story even began.
Tony agreed against Steve’s bare chest then tilted his head to press a kiss to his heart. Steve lifted Tony’s chin with a finger and kissed him, an act Tony promptly reciprocated until they fell back into their rhythm.
"Exactly. And at the time, he may have been. You’re not the one to blame." Tony soothed with a smile. Because I am. I didn’t ask JARVIS about Jackie before we got in the shower. He didn't voice that to Steve though. He didn't want him to leave feeling that Tony was hurt.
Steve kissed him further up and further still, Tony holding onto Steve's hands beside his shoulders tight enough to hurt but they both needed it. The reassurance that neither of them won’t be getting up and walking away anytime soon.
"Tell me." Clint demanded.
Steve blinked, shielding Tony from the entrancing beauty of his eyes, waking him from his spell, returning the breath to his lungs. His hand closed around the box and he threw himself at Steve, hugging him tightly. “Yes!” He agreed. “Yes. Yes. Yes!” He laughed. “Steve, that is everything I’ve ever wanted. I can’t say it like you did, but everything you feel, I do too.”
"I not puppy Papa. I bear." Jack roared for emphasis but he yawned again midway through it.
He curled up on his seat and let Tony wash over everything that he was.
Steve shifts his attention to Clint while his two boyfriends Eskimo kiss away. “Bucky trying to prove himself the better sniper again.” He mentions, not as a question. He already knows how competitive Buck is. Clint chuckles, “Yeah. Keeps trying to get me to admit he’s better than me.” He shakes his head, smiling. “Not in his dreams.” “You’re just as proud of yourself as he is.” Steve notes, his eyes drifting to Tony and Bucky who are whispering at each other’s lips.
"Trust me." He murmured and Tony felt his tank top lifting off his hips and lower torso and soon over the arc reactor.
If they'd been together, if they fought this battle against Thanos together, they wouldn't have lost. The world wouldn't have lost, the Avengers wouldn't have failed, and they wouldn't have failed the world. He would've still had..
Steve is biting the inside of his lip and Clint takes notice. “It’s okay Cap. Tony may not pass time upgrading my bike, but he spends a lot of time working on my recurve and arrows. We’re kinda even.” Clint attempts to draw Steve’s attention away from his previous frown. It works and Steve smiles slightly, nothing like his usual stunning smile. Did Clint really just think that?  Before he even has the time to make sense of what he thought, Steve is suddenly very close to him.
The way he asked if they could adopt a baby boy.
Clint's heart lurched at the image and accompanying thought. He needed to do something to shake loose the damp of sad emotions.
Could he possibly have been having a nightmare and didn’t realize that he was? Strange. But it wasn't that strange. Many a time Tony's woken him up from his nightmares, telling him that he was screaming.
Bucky rolls on top of Clint and plants his lips to his, kissing him deeply. Clint’s hand tangles in the messy dark brown hair, pulling Bucky down to him, and kissing him further. Bucky kisses Clint like he’ll never get enough of kissing him, and Clint moans under his soft lips, pulling him down further still and swelling his lips with his own. Bucky’s kisses become too deep and passionate as he wants Clint, making Clint pull back, breathing heavily at his lips. “Don’t want to..” Clint takes in a sharp breath. “To do this in the morning..” He murmurs to Bucky’s lips. Bucky nods, licking his lips and kissing Clint one more time. He rolls over, allowing enough room for Clint to slide to the side of the bed and get up.
He hadn't looked around the room when he'd come in, but now that he had, he noticed how vastly different it was. Tony must've redecorated since.. He too must have wanted to bury some memories.
Tony’s schedule was absolutely swamped. Between meetings to discuss how they’re finally going to put an end to the failed project that is the Accords and approving potential projects to be funded by the September Foundation, he had to reheat his 9:00 AM coffee four times so far.
Steve could imagine every word in perfect detail, thanks to Triple S. He definitely needed to sketch that while he waited for the baddies with Clint. Yeah, he packed his sketchbook.
He blinked. That's how Steve must feel. Tony always leaves him for the workshop after they spend a couple of hours together.
Steve’s eyebrows furrow. “Why?” He asks, pushing Tony’s hand away gently. Tony licks his lips, his fingers tracing Steve’s on his wrist. “Because you showed me how much it would hurt you if you ever thought that I would stop loving you.” “I’d do more than that.” Steve mumbles to himself, sitting up in bed. “That’s what scares me.” Tony admits, sitting up as well. “You have so little regard for your own safety.” He begins, slotting his fingers back through his husband’s. “And you don’t care what you throw yourself into if it makes you feel better.” Tony looks up to Steve’s eyes to find them directed at their joint fingers. “You can’t be so reckless for the sake of the ones you love.” Steve remains eyeing his hand in the genius’s, unable to deny Tony’s words because he knows he’s right.
