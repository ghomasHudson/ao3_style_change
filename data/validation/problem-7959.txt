Bruce raised his eyebrows. “As I’ve reminded you both about eighty times, Peter seems fine and as it’s unlikely that he will develop any more powers now that it’s been a few months since -”
“We were just having a cup of tea and talking about how
“Are we dead?”
“Tony, it wasn’t your fault. There was nothing -”
Tony was definitely his own unique brand of genius, but it was obvious that he also had his father’s stubborn will to see a project through.
For the first time, Steve felt a spark of hope, knowing there was a solid plan in place. Even if Thor couldn’t defeat Thanos, they would take the Soul Stone, bring back everybody else, and defeat him with the full force of the Avengers back in play. Of course, his optimism was tempered by the knowledge that he wouldn’t be around to see it.
“We don’t know that,” Tony snapped, a harsh reminder for both of them. He didn’t want to pass his endless cynicism onto Peter, but the kid had to learn. People weren’t always who they said they were - especially around people as trusting as Peter. He should have realized that Peter was impervious to cynicism and that a kid who regularly disguised himself as “Spider-Man” to fight crime wasn’t going to respond well to Tony trying to be realistic.
She explained to them how Thanos had to sacrifice someone he cared about in order to get the Stone. Gamora was probably the only person he had ever cared for enough to qualify, so she had been doomed from the start of his quest for the Infinity Stones.
Unfortunately, one nice conversation didn’t mean that Steve wasn’t undercover. He was abruptly reminded of that fact when Tony looked through the sketchbook. It had been a close call. Steve made up some story, detailed enough that it sounded legitimate, simple enough that it sounded plausible, to cover the fact that he had been drawing Peggy and Bucky. Frankly, he was lucky that Tony hadn’t recognized them. Steve knew there were pictures of Howard with the two of them, and only the fact that Tony avoided thinking about Howard as much as possible had saved his identity from being revealed in the middle of Central Park.
“Good morning, sir. May Parker is here and requesting a meeting with you as soon as possible. You have nothing scheduled for today. Should I tell her -”
Tony felt the urge to scream. “Does anyone else have a better plan?” He asked impatiently, pacing back and forth in front of them. “Because unless we send in the Hulk, which is definitely not more subtle than Iron Man, I don’t see how -”
“Reminds me of -” Steve cut himself off. He was on his third drink, and it must really be strong, because usually he had more self-restraint than this. He looked over to see if Tony would let it slide, but he found the other man’s dark eyes gazing back at him, a little too bright and attentive. “They remind me of this girl I used to date,” he said, and all of a sudden he found himself telling Tony about Peggy, again leaving out some details but keeping the important ones. He knew he was risking everything by spilling his entire personal life to Tony. But from the way that Tony had been inching closer to him all night, and the way the back of his neck felt warm and he no longer knew what to do with his hands, Steve also knew that he was so far away from the mission right now that it didn’t even matter what he was saying anymore. He’d done exactly what they said not to do: he was completely enchanted by Tony Stark.
“It’s okay,” said Tony, surprising himself. “You were doing your job. I - I mean, do you work for SHIELD? How exactly - uh, how is that working?” He had so many questions, he realized, but that was okay; he was eager to learn more. He tried not to babble. “When did they find you, by the way? Did you know that technically, Captain America is a trademark of Stark Industries, and -”
handed him part of the file before, but it had only contained relevant information. There had been nothing in there about Tony’s mysterious past. And honestly, Steve hadn’t read that far into it beyond
because they couldn’t get ahold of Tony’s actual designs for any of it. Steve felt strangely proud of Tony for successfully keeping secrets from SHIELD. Most people assumed that Captain America would be a rule follower, but he knew better than most that it was sometimes better to keep certain information out of powerful hands.
Tonight was different.
(Tony didn’t want to think that Steve was capable of such a thing, but given the other betrayals he had experienced, he had low expectations) - but there was nothing to follow up that ominous statement, just fuzzy silence. It took Tony about thirty full seconds to realize the call had been dropped.
Hey look, a new chapter! I hope it was worth the wait. Still un-beta'd, so... feel free to point out grammar mistakes and typos, but also, I am already aware of the overuse of italics.
“Was Tony alive?” He felt everyone’s eyes turn to him. “In - in the scenario, in the outcome that you saw - was he still alive? Because when we first met, you said you would let me and Tony die before letting Thanos get the Time Stone. Which was kind of harsh, actually, but I understand because it’s like, the fate of the universe and all. But then you traded the Time Stone for Tony. So is that why you changed your mind?” He knew he was babbling, but he had to know. Tony had done so much for him, and for all of them. Peter couldn’t stand the thought that Tony wouldn’t live to see the outcome that Strange was telling them about, the one where everybody lived.
He turned to see a frazzled-looking Peter Parker step out of the elevator.
“I don’t know,” the other man said almost boredly. “Hey, how hard did you hit this kid, anyway? He’s been out for hours.”
“I am Groot,” said Groot. Quill shushed him.
T H E   S O U L   W O R L D
Strange continued, “Upon learning about the threat that Thanos posed to the universe, I meditated to try and find a way to stop him.”
In contrast to their surroundings, the people appeared in sharp relief, looking normal - or as normal as one would expect. Peter was still in his uniform, and Bucky still had dirt and blood on him from fighting.
Tony sighed and ran a hand through his hair. “Peter, I want to know what the hell you were thinking. It’s three in the morning. That guy had a gun. You could’ve been killed. Fighting crime isn’t some game you get to play now just because you have powers, understand?”
Things were also going well for Pepper and her intern, MJ, who seemed to have every task complete before she was even asked to do it. Stark Industries was running smoothly, and everyone was happy.
“You know what’s weird?” Tony said as he stepped out of the suit for the second time that night, putting himself on Peter’s level as he walked closer. Peter took several steps backward, still refusing to reveal his face. “I just saw a guy hanging from a brick wall and he looked like he was covered in spider webs. Only, I don't think it was a spider. Did you know there’s only one known substance that’s stronger than spider’s silk?" He didn’t wait for an answer. “Carbon nanotubes. Which you can only engineer if you know how to use nanotechnology. And the weird thing is, I
“Don’t say that,” said Tony harshly. “Don’t say there was nothing I could have done. I could have been less stubborn. I could have listened to you, and we would have been together, and we might have had a fighting chance.”
T H E    S O U L    W O R L D
Peter still looked a little shell-shocked, wide-eyed and frightened, but also trusting. Too trusting, Tony thought, which is what got them into this situation in the first place. “Okay.”
“Peter.”
“What? No, no, no, come on!”
The lights above him were soft, and for a few seconds he was tempted to drift off again, to enjoy sleeping in. Except he wasn’t in his bed. The thought ignited a spark in Peter’s brain and his eyes flew open, heart racing, only to find himself face-to-face with a long-haired, handsome man.
“Thanos killed her to get the Soul Stone.” Nebula tilted her head, her dark eyes alternately lingering on Steve and Tony.
“I did,” she said in a way that plainly said
Peter glanced between Sam and Bucky, who stood together but with their arms crossed.
Tony was covered in dirt, dust, and ash, the same way everyone here had looked just after the battle. He had a cut on his forehead that looked bad, crusted over with blood; he had scrapes and bruises all over. And Nebula hadn’t been kidding: there was a horrible blood stain on Tony’s right side, enough red to make Steve’s stomach lurch, to make him think they were too late, but somehow it had stopped bleeding. The wound was fixed, but Tony wasn’t - he’d lost blood, he was probably fatigued and dehydrated from battle like everybody else, and his minor injuries were adding up.
“S-sorry,” Peter apologizes and quickly puts his phone on the nightstand.
He promised Peter a suit when he got back, and he never broke a single promise to his son. He doesn’t know what Peter had in mind, but he hopes his son appreciates the thought.
I just want to say that I appreciate everyone who's stuck through this. I know it's rough and if it becomes too much and you can't continue, then that's okay! I still appreciate how far you did come. That's all I wanted to say :)
Steve nods, but refuses to answer the question. Tony doesn’t push.
Thank you guys so much for the support! You guys are the best! 😊
“Take your time.”
“What’s going on?” Peter asks, excitement seeping into his tone. He tries to play it cool by clearing his throat and running a hand through his damp hair. “I’m not in trouble am I?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I wanted to. You and Mr. Rog-Steve, you guys are like...family. I see you as my dads or something and-sorry that’s weird to say.” Peter’s face is beet red at this point and he wraps his arms around himself.
“It’s okay, Petey,” Steve soothes. “I’m here. Mommy’s here.”
“You gonna get wet for me?”
“Come on, kid, you can’t sleep down here.”
“I love you,” Tony says before leaning in for another kiss. This time it’s slower, but the passion and love is still there. “And I won’t be late,” he adds once they break apart. “I’ll be here and then you and I will have a nice, romantic evening.”
“It might be too soon,” Bruce says, then his gaze falls on Tony. “Or can Jarvis figure that out, too?”
The alpha above him keeps him pinned tight while he works his slacks open to free himself. Steve’s stomach twists painfully and he squirms, trying to get away from the man. But then the same warning is being said back into his ear and Steve has no choice but to comply.
He doesn’t understand where they went wrong. They promised and assured each other that they could remain friends following the end of their relationship, but that proved to be easier said than done. Tony wasn’t helping the situation by distancing himself and Steve’s bitterness toward him was only making it worse.
Steve whines again and his bottom lip sticks out in a pout.
Tony rushes back to the room.
Bruce’s lack of response makes Tony wonder if he’s unhappy with Tony’s response. He doesn’t blame Bruce for being upset.
Tony frowns. “Is it that bad? Am I hideous now?”
“Yes you did. Maybe we never should’ve-” Steve glances down at the ring on his finger. He toys with the band before slipping it off and laying it on the counter. “Here. Maybe now you can find someone better.”
The door to the room opens and Steve snaps his head up, expecting to find the two agents that haven’t left his side since he was rescued. He understood they had an objective to keep him safe, but for the past couple of days, he’s never felt more safe. Just knowing that Pierce and Hydra were no longer a threat eased him.
Tony is quick to notice the shift in Steve’s tone and he has Jarvis shut off the hologram.
“I love you too,” Tony says and kisses Steve gently on the lips, then he presses their foreheads back together.
Steve sniffs the air, scenting the strangers, then realization hits. They weren’t strangers. They were his pups.
But he still yearned to know his dad. He wanted to know if he had changed over the past few years. Maybe his dad was different now and was looking for him. Peter didn’t want to get his hopes up though.
“I can live with that. A break would be nice.”
“You’re not picking her up?”
Knowing freedom is just within his reach, Steve moves toward the alpha and raises the blade.
“We usually struggle with this part.”
“Are you feeling better?”
Steve releases a small sob and Tony pulls him close, wrapping him in his arms and allowing him to cry into his chest. He cradles Steve’s head, fingers gently running through his hair.
Hi, guys! Ugh I'm sorry for this late post and probably not so great chapter. I hope the pace of this story isn't too slow. I don't want to rush in some things because Tony and Steve are still learning about each other. This chapter is pretty much some more backstory and them being cute. They're figuring things out I guess.
Steve chuckles and brings the spoon to his mouth, humming in delight when the sweetness touches his tongue. “Pete’s gonna be up all night. The kid loves sugar.”
“Hey, don’t worry about the money. That is never going to be an issue.”
“Not yet. I’m going to need more from you and my omega.”
“I’m sorry to bother you, but someone is here to see you,” Natalie says.
He’d have to show it to Peter someday.
Not a word is said until Tony is pulling into his private garage and shutting off the ignition. He takes off his sunglasses, revealing his glistening eyes. He glances at his son.
Steve chuckles and gives Tony another kiss, then he leaves the room to clean up.
“We eventually had to tell him to pick something else,” Bruce chuckles.
There’s a sense of relief knowing that he had another person on his side. He felt he could trust Nick now. His child would be safe and receive the best care. No harm would ever come to him or her.
The penthouse still resembles the last time Peter’s been in it. He can’t help but wonder if his dad even lives here. Probably not. He probably owns a bunch of houses.
“Can we talk?” Tony asks.
Their newest mission starts off different from the start. His suit doesn’t feel right; it’s tighter along the front, making it difficult for him to strap on the belt. Steve trails a hand over the middle of his suit, brows furrowing slightly at the small bump he finds there. It wasn’t like him to gain weight. The serum took care of that, and yet his middle was slightly distended. He shrugs it off.
Natasha peers up at him, eyes narrowing slightly. “Diapers are your thing.”
Steve shakes his head again. “He doesn’t want to. I tried. Tony, I tried everything. I don’t know what to do.”
“Dad?” Peter peers up at Tony. “Do you want to…I mean if you’re busy then I understand but Auntie Nat always makes the best cakes and I don’t know…maybe…”
The first thing Tony notices about him is the backpack around his shoulder. That answered the school question. The next thing was his red, glistening eyes. Great. He had been crying. Tony wasn’t sure if he could even cheer him up. He couldn’t even cheer his own self up.
“I hate doing this,” his aunt says.
“I don’t know. I just don’t feel good.”
“We better get going,” Steve gestures with his head toward the door. “I have some pants you can borrow.”
Steve smiles again, this time a little brighter than before. He rests his forehead against Tony’s, his eyes filling with tears again, albeit for a different reason.
He rushes to his closest and pulls out an old backpack, and begins filling it with clothes and other items he might need. Ned would probably let him stay for a couple of days while Peter gets his shit together. Then of course there was his Auntie Nat or even his uncles, Bucky and Sam. But then he wonders if they’d take his parents' side.
Bucky swallows hard but doesn’t contribute to the conversation. It’s obvious he doesn’t agree with what’s being said around him, but he backs down and lets the others make the decision.
Ned doesn’t finish his story. It makes Peter feel worse.
“Oh.” Peter is aware that the frown on his face hasn’t vanished. His dad must’ve told this woman about him, and though a part of him likes the idea of his dad acknowledging him, the other half is hesitant. He wonders exactly what it is his dad has said.
No. Steve wouldn’t do anything to hurt Morgan. He loved her. He was fine.
“Careful what you wish for.”
”Mr. Stark is not safe.”
“I’m still learning myself. It’s fine. We’ll be back in New York once the baby is born.”
Steve smiles. “It’s great to hear your voice, Jarvis.”
story. Look, I just need you to be his doctor-”
Steve turns his head and finds Tony in the entryway with an amused smile on his face.
“Yes,” he says through gritted teeth. “My rut is starting and I need to be away from him. What part don’t you get?”
This wasn’t how breakups were supposed to work. At least, to Steve they weren’t. Being in a relationship was new to him, but even he knew that once it was over, exes were not supposed to be doing what he was doing right now.
Tony doesn’t know what it is that makes him conjure up such a ridiculous plan. Maybe it’s because he feels guilty for almost hurting the omega. Maybe it’s because he’s drawn to him in a way he never thought possible. Whatever the reason, Tony wants to act on his plan.
The tears are streaming down her face now and she wipes angrily at them. Her family had never been perfect and she always believed that she would love them, no matter the flaws they had. But it was hard to say that now.
“Yeah! Look!” Peter pulls away and stretches one arm out, his palm upward and fingers bent in a way Steve has never seen before. Then something shoots out his son’s wrists and Steve’s eyes widen.
“I figured we could reminisce,” Natasha says with a small shrug and flips the album to the first page. She immediately coos at the baby picture of Peter. “Look at you! You were so tiny and cute!”
“I’m so good that I got an A on my history paper.”
“Is that why we’re going to California? Why not call the cops and let them deal with this bad alpha?” Happy asks.
Steve stirs and Tony snaps his head up, eyes trained on Steve’s face, searching for any indication that he was truly waking up or if tt was just a fragment of his imagination. Then Steve is squeezing his hand.
“You are,” Steve assures with a smile. He runs his fingers through Tony’s hair.
“Fine,” Tony grumbles and snatches up another piece along with a screw. “This is just fighting with me. This shouldn’t be this difficult. I build robots for Christ’s sake!”
Steve chuckles and rises to his feet, then he’s extending a hand to pull Tony to his. Tony gasps suddenly and sits back down in the chair.
“You ready to lose?” Tony smirks.
The sight that greets him is a completely different one than what he’s used to. He had been so accustomed to Steve feeding and comforting Morgan in the middle of the night, but something about this scene was all wrong. That smile Steve wore whenever Morgan locked her eyes with him was gone; instead he was crying, soft sniffs escaping him and shoulders shaking from the sobs he’s desperately trying to conceal.
With another deep breath, Steve makes the call. He waits, listening to the rings, hoping that he’ll hear Tony’s voice. He never does and he’s forced to leave a message.
“What did I say about beating yourself up?”
Steve’s belly twists into uncomfortable knots and his palms grow sweaty. He hasn’t felt this nervous in sometime. He takes a deep, slow breath to calm his nerves, but even that does very little to help.
They didn’t work. They barely managed to create a friendship and the romantic relationship they decided to try crumbled. Tony should’ve known it was a bad idea from the start. They weren’t capable of loving each other. They fought more than anything. At least, that used to be the case.
Steve sniffs. “But the others. I should’ve done something. I was their mother and I just let them...I hurt them.”
“How’s Steve?” Pepper eventually gets a chance to ask.
“I’m not just some rich asshole. Don’t listen to the lies people spread about me. I want to help.”
“Hey.”
Tony nods and Steve pecks him on the cheek before making his way up the stairs to console their son.
“The choice should be obvious, and it is. I’m keeping the baby. If you want to be on board then...then that would be ideal. Great even. If not...I understand. I just thought you should know. You deserve to know. Please call me back. Bye.”
Steve silences him with another kiss. “I’m okay,” he assures. “This is okay. I actually wanted...I don’t know. I was hoping…”
Knowing better than to argue, Steve gives up and takes the offered seat. With a heavy sigh he leans forward and claps his hands together. “What happened?” He asks.
“Just say it. I’m sure I’ve heard it already but it sounds like you need to get something off your chest.”
“Not like that. I’m still hesitant about that. I was thinking I take her around the compound, maybe spend some time outside. We both could use the fresh air.”
JARVIS sighs and Tony can’t help but roll his eyes. He didn’t need a scolding right now. Lord knows he gets it enough from Pepper.
“How did you not know you’re pregnant!” Tony exclaims. Now he’s panicking.
“I was just about to say the same thing. I thought I was living the life. I had everything I could ever want. And then you literally crash into my life and I don’t regret any of it. I love you and our pups. So much. This is the life I want.”
“Everyone I know is dead.”
“I know, but it didn’t work out that way and we just have to figure out how to do this backwards.”
“I think we have a name.” Tony kneels down in front of Steve, leaning forward and carefully resting his head over Steve’s belly. “Hey, Peter. We finally have a name for you, kiddo. Sorry it took this long. Blame your papa.”
Steve doesn’t even hesitate to supply an answer. “Yes.”
“You can have it later. But only one.”
Bruce rolls his eyes. “You? Nah. I missed Peter the most.”
His first instinct is to rush over and comfort him, but he finds himself unable to move. He wonders if Steve would even let him console him. Probably not.
“See? I wasn’t entirely wrong,” Tony says and leans closer to kiss Peter’s cheek. “I love you, kiddo.”
“Anything.”
Steve frowns and takes a seat near Tony’s legs. “It was
“You seem to be doing alright.”
“Please,” Steve begs, thrusting up against the hand that’s pleasuring him. Tony rewards him with more pressure. That same hand pops the buttons of his jeans open and slides inside, causing Steve to moan. “Tony, please. More.”
Sam chuckles. “And it only gets worse.”
“Is he okay?” Bruce asks once they’re in the kitchen and out of earshot.
Now it all made sense.
The ring is still on the kitchen counter. It’s a painful reminder of their latest fight. Not once has Steve ever taken his ring off. No matter how bad past arguments had been, the ring never came off.
The rest of the team hasn’t come in yet. They wanted to give Tony space and time to be alone with Steve before paying a visit. A part of Tony wishes Morgan was with him. Maybe she would be enough to coax Steve awake.
“Yeah. Hey maybe later we can grab lunch. Morgan shouldn’t fuss.”
It’s obvious his snarkiness was going to get him nowhere. The other alpha is clearly unimpressed with Tony’s behavior. The little voice in the back of Tony’s head warns him, practically begs him for once to behave, but he can’t help himself. For months he’d been dying to give this fucking asshole a piece of his mind.
Steve pokes his head out of the connecting bathroom, failing to hide his amusement at the sight. “He looks comfy,” he says with a small shrug, then he’s disappearing to the bathroom again.
But Steve wasn’t going to get better overnight. Occasionally he would stay in the shower longer than normal, or his morning runs would exceed their normal time. Tony didn’t worry too much about it. Those were the times when Steve would get a break from Morgan. And Tony promised him more breaks.
Steve collapses back down on the couch with a sigh. Tears are running down his face and he wipes at them angrily. Tony finds himself moving closer, no longer caring about the distance he knows needs to be between them. His alpha side urges him to be near the omega.
“You didn’t waste my time, Mr. Stark,” Alexander assures. “In fact this visit was helpful to both of us.”
There’s a small smile on his face when Morgan is in his arms. “Shh. Sweetheart, it’s okay. I’m here,” Steve’s soothing voice has Morgan quieting down. Her eyes open and she peers up at him. Steve smiles down at her. “You’re okay,” Steve soothes, using one hand to gently stroke her face.
“I love you more,” Steve whispers back.
“You’re a terrible liar, honey.”
“I’m never changing my mind.”
“That’s not you. Steve, whatever you’re thinking...it’s not you. I know you don’t mean the things you say or do because it’s not
Peter arrives at the tower later than he expected, but he’s not worried. It wasn’t like he used the main entrance anyway. He wonders if one day he’ll get the chance.
“It’s just like the picture,” Peter says, his smile returning. “This is perfect. This is amazing! Dad, thank you!”
It was safer-for both the child and himself- if his secret remained hidden. The last thing he wanted was for the world to turn against him and shun the child that was innocent. Not to mention Tony finding out through a gossip article.
Steve finds him tinkering away on his newest inventions, still clad in his work suit and smearing grease along the front of the white shirt. Steve sighs loudly and moves toward his husband, coming up behind him and wrapping his arms around his shoulders. Tony doesn’t even flinch or acknowledge that he was there.
“I don’t. He’s been kicking me all ni-” Steve cuts off with a groan when Peter finally wakes up and stretches. Natasha is the only one delighted to feel the movement.
“Sir, you have an incoming call from Ms. Romanoff,” FRIDAY interjects.
“He loved you too. He didn’t say it but I could tell.”
“Buck,” Steve says, his voice low. “I don’t want to die. Buck, I-I d-don’t…”
“I will, but we’re gonna try one more time with you, right?”
I got a tiny bit of inspiration for this story. I’m still working on it. I have some ideas but there for later chapters so I’m still trying to figure out what else to add.
“-how do you feel about the baby?” Tony continues, trying to hide his smirk when the teenager stares up at him with wide eyes.
“Are you guys having a baby?” he asks.
“Was he different when you two…never mind. I wish you could answer me. I hate not knowing what to do. You always knew what to do. I miss you so much, Papa.”
“What?”
With Peter distracted with the movie, Tony returns back to the bedroom. He finds Steve still in bed, staring blankly at the wall, tears rolling down his face. Tony has never seen him so broken.
Yikes Bucky almost punched Tony 😬  He did threaten him again so 😉
“I’ll check on him,” Sam offers and leaves in search of Bucky.
“Maybe. But I don’t want to get my hopes up. I’m happy that we got lucky with him. He’s enough.”
The thought of calling his best friends comes to mind, but then he’s reminded of the mission they’re tied up in. His hiatus affected the team and they were left taking on more work. They had more than enough people now on the team, but his and Tony’s absence still created a hole.
“You ready?” Steve asks as he opens the small bag of chocolate chips. Peter nods his head excitedly and tries to take the bag. “Wait a minute. Let me help you.”
“Do you blame him?” Tony asks. “I hated vegetables as a kid.”
“Then we both just have to meet in the middle. I don’t want to do this alone.”
“It’s better! We’re having a baby!” Tony exclaims, pulling Steve close to connect their lips. He completely forgets that Dodger is squished between them until he’s barking and wiggling free.
“I said after we look at names we can have lunch. Weren’t you listening?”
Steve repeats those words over and over again. It almost hurts more than his actually sobs.
“I mean I’m gonna tell them...soonish.”
This time his parents ignore them as they return downstairs and rush toward the front door. Peter makes sure Flash is out of the building and walking safely to his car before heading back up stairs.
There was no point in denying it. Tony shrugs his shoulders. “Didn’t you say you wanted us to be friends?”
“I mean…we’re getting close to being friends. He doesn’t bully me anymore. I think the baby changed him or something.”
“You’re hilarious.”
Steve had been over the moon when he got his best friend back. Tony got that. He had a best friend too, and he’d do anything for Rhodey if the roles had been reversed.
Natasha nods and takes the car seat. She takes a seat in one of the empty chairs outside of the room and sets the car seat down near her feet. Steve stays near the door, contemplating if he should barge in or wait.
“Okay. I knew you wanted the sweatshirt back.”
Steve doesn’t hesitate and moves closer until he can take Tony’s hand and allow himself to be pulled in close. Tony circles around him until he’s standing behind him and wraps both arms around Steve’s waist. His chin comes down to rest on Steve’s shoulder. They’re both facing the lake now.
“Please?” Steve turns to begging, knowing his defensive attitude will only get him in more trouble. “Please let me keep her? I’m her mother.”
Steve sniffs. “I think she’s hungry.”
I swear revenge is coming! I got help for some painful ideas 😈 Pierce deserves to suffer just like Steve, right? It’s only fair 🤷♀️
“It’s nothing. Let me grab you some clothes okay?”
“I won’t break it.” Steve kisses Tony’s cheek again, then he leaves for his run.
Steve props himself up on his elbows, watching with lust-filled eyes as Tony works on unbuckling his belt and crawling between his spread legs. Steve welcomes Tony with a lip bruising kiss, soft moans escaping him when Tony’s tongue slides into his mouth.
“I know, I know. I’m sorry. I guess I’m just grumpy.”
Each step is difficult, but Steve knows better than to show even a hint of pain. The alphas found his discomfort pleasurable and made sure to inflict more damage just to get a kick out of it. It was cruel, but no one was worse than the head alpha.
“Nope,” Steve quickly gathers his son, ignoring the whining and kicking. “Peter Benjamin, we do not get on the counter.”
“How do you know that? Did you ask? Oh wait no you didn’t. We don’t work and I’m sorry but it’s stressing me out.”
He sniffs and takes a deep, slow breath to calm himself, not wanting to give in and show up to school with red eyes and a stuffy nose. His appearance would be excused. The death of his father was still fresh.
The majority of the morning is spent tidying up her room and completing any chores she had, then working on the homework she had been assigned. It’s pretty uneventful, but at least she had something to occupy her time until her dad got home.
“Because it’s true. I got it from here. Go watch tv or something.”
Tony’s eyes open and the smile falters, immediately replaced with a frown. “You’re killing me, sweetheart.”
The threat was clear and the beta backs off.
Pepper lays a hand over his shoulder and rubs the spot soothingly. “It’s going to be okay. No one said this was going to be easy.”
“I mean it. Go back to bed, honey. I got her.”
Being the curious dog that he is, Dodger comes closer to sniff Peter’s sock covered feet.
“Come on, Petey. Bed time.” Steve shifts in his seat, grunting softly when he struggles to get up. Tony rises to his feet and offers Steve his hand.
“Mr. Stark?”
She steps into the hall and takes a deep breath. It would have been easier to hide out in the private bathroom her office had, but everyone would know where she was. She needed to escape and be alone, gather her thoughts. Pepper realizes now how wrong she had been. She couldn’t be alone now.
“Okay.” Nick rises to his feet. “You can train him, but if he goofs off-”
“I know, I know. But what else could this be? I haven’t seen you this sick in a long time. You haven’t had any bad shrimp.”
Steve doesn’t hesitate to make the trade, and once Morgan is passed off to Tony, he disappears to the living room.
“Sorry. But it is old, Buck.”
“No. That’s shitty of me to let you do that. It’s my fault, right? You clearly didn’t ask for this.”
“Are we going to talk about this or are you going to keep it bottled in?” Sam questions.
Sleep eventually does wash over him and Steve’s eyes fall shut. It’s not a peaceful sleep. He’s tormented by horrible nightmares. It starts the same way they always do, and no matter how hard Steve struggles to escape, the alpha pins him down and takes what is his.
“Yeah!” Peter pulls away and nods his head, the smile on his face brighter than before.
“I have to do this. It will be better for me and everyone in the long run. Just trust me.”
“Good afternoon, Steve,” Jarvis greets.
Steve frowns. “You sure? I don’t want to bother you and-”
Peter stares at himself in the mirror, brown eyes going wide and welling with tears. He didn’t look like his daddy at all. What was supposed to be hair on his face just like his daddy’s was instead brown scribbles. Peter panics and picks up the marker to fix his mistakes, but it gets worse.
Peter immediately backpedals. He’s thought about living with his dad full time, but all it’s ever been was just an idea. Peter honestly wasn’t sure if he could move out of the compound and away from his family. There was no denying that his family would let him go. All they wanted was for him to be happy, but Peter couldn’t leave them. They’ve lost so much already.
Yay Steve has his babies back! I’ll explain more in the next chapter, and then of course Tony needs to find out about them.
Sam nods in agreement. “So…should you tell him about the mission or shall I?”
He senses her presence and glances up, shooting her a tired smile. “Hey.”
It shouldn’t take Tony long to respond. If anything his response should have been immediate, and yet Steve notices the delay.
“He did?” Tony glances over in Steve’s direction, getting a nod in response. He turns back to his son. “I think you look awesome! Guess I need a costume too, huh?”
“It is. You’ll feel like yourself in no time.”
“Go upstairs,” Steve tells him, his tone still calm. Peter nods and runs up the stairs, not bothering to look back. Steve sighs sadly and leans forward in his seat, clasping his hands together and rubbing them for a moment before looking up at his husband. “That went well.”
James throws his arms around Steve’s neck, hugging him tightly. Steve hugs his son back, making sure to give him a gentle squeeze.
“I think you need to take a minute,” Sam tells Bucky. He removes the hand he has on Bucky’s chest and reaches for Bucky’s cool, metal one. He knew what this arm was capable of, and he’d be lying if he said he wasn’t worried.
But the voice in his head argues against that. If he was dead then Steve might as well be too. It was up to him to get his mate and son out of this.
“Hey I only knew him as the stubborn captain. I really wish I had the chance to learn more. Sorry. I’m ruining the mood, huh?”
There’s no response and one glance down shows why. Tony is already asleep and snoring softly. It’s tempting to lie beside him and snuggle him until he wakes up, but Steve finds himself growing tired. It takes a lot for his body to feel any kind of fatigue. He blames the missions and training he’s been focusing on lately.
“You’re under a lot of stress, too. It’s not your fault.”
“If you say so. Do you want to try again or are you scared?”
Tony curses again. The base of his cock tingles, his knot forming to lock inside and tie them together.
He was the one who screwed up. He was the one who pushed Steve and everyone close to him away. It was his fault. His mistakes.
“Can I lie down? My back really hurts.”
“He’s usually with you,” Natasha adds.
“Da!” Peter says happily and all attention lands on him. He’s pushed himself up, and on wobbly legs, takes a few steps toward his parents. He stops for a moment when he loses balance, but he’s quick to regain it and he moves his tiny legs a little more until he’s standing near Steve.
“Steve!” Tony calls out as he makes his way up the stairs. The first room he checks is Morgan’s, only to find her room empty. A few of her belongings are scattered around the room, proof Steve had been there at some point. Tony keeps looking.
She raised one eyebrow and didn’t look up from what she was typing as she pointedly moved her laptop away from where he sat, safely out of range of any potential coffee spills. “Can I help you, Mr. Stark?” She asked lightly.
The spiders were traced back to Oscorp three days after Peter left the hospital. Tony wasn't surprised, but he was angry. He didn't have much time to dwell on it, though, because then some... other things happened.
Peter looked properly ashamed, puppy eyes and all, but the only thing he said was, “Please don’t tell Aunt May.”
“Tony, would you please just listen?” Steve asked. He didn’t push Tony away, but he sounded exasperated. “I would
Tony sighed. “I know that.” Spider-Man had made a few headlines here or there, but that was different. If Peter’s name, or his face, were in the New York Times? That put him in a whole different kind of danger. Tony thought of how Peter refused to even tell his aunt about his powers because of how scared he was to put her in danger, and he barely refrained from a shudder. It would be a disaster for everyone involved if Peter’s secret got out.
“So… Spider-Man must have been at MIT that day,” said Steve. “Right? And he must be close to Stark, which narrows it down.”
He felt slightly better knowing that Bruce would be there to protect their most important secret, but he was still uncomfortable as he watched the three of them exit the room. As soon as the door closed, Pepper turned on him. “Was all of that really necessary?” She asked reasonably. “Tony, this is a good PR opportunity for the company. And it’s a good chance for Peter and Michelle to get their names out there. I don’t understand why you can’t just let him do his job.”
Peter let go of him with a bright smile and turned to Cap. “Thank you for rescuing me, uh - Captain America, sir.”
“So you’re saying that if they go after the Soul Stone - Steve and Tony - one of them would need to sacrifice the other.”
Steve called Tony back four times but there was no reply. After the fourth time he reached Tony’s voicemail, he threw his phone so hard at the wall that it shattered.
"Tony,” Pepper said sternly.
He had been given strict instructions to avoid the actual red carpet, entering through a side door instead. He had to show his ID to a man at the door, who checked his name off on a list. It made him feel like he was the president or something, sneaking around to avoid the paparazzi. Did presidents do that? He had no idea.
He carried a tan messenger bag that he never would have picked out for himself. It contained a notebook, a few pens, and an iPad that he barely knew how to use.
“Peter, Peter, no. I’m sorry, this is all my fault… I’m sorry….”
And then Peter became Spider-Man.
Steve was being horribly quiet about the whole thing, like he didn’t know what to say or do, either.
Steve’s shoulders stiffened, but all he said was, “Of course.” And then he was gone.
“It is my belief,” Strange chimed in, “and Loki’s, based on rumors from the darkest corners of the galaxy, that a loved one needs to be sacrificed in order to acquire the Soul Stone.”
Tony rolled down the window and shouted, “I didn’t even know how I was going to end that sentence anyway!”
“No promises!” Tony called over his shoulder, and then he disappeared down the hallway.
Steve was on his feet and halfway down the hallway before he realized what he was doing might not be the best idea. First of all, he and Tony were on tenuous terms at best. It was odd to burst into a friend’s room in the middle of the night, never mind someone you weren’t sure even liked you anymore. Second, Tony notoriously did not enjoy being woken up by anything other than the gentle sound of an AI, or sunlight streaming through a window. Generally, waking Tony up meant taking a punch to the face or a knee to the gut.
Tony was thinking about skipping the holiday party altogether until he realized that it was actually a blessing.
safe?
Bucky looked uncomfortable, but he said, “I think we’re somewhere in-between. I’m trying to figure it out. Hey, where did you come from, anyway? New York? Because the rest of us were in Wakanda.” He gestured to where a few people were gathered a short distance away.
Tony lunged for him, and all Steve could think was that he’d had it coming.
- as he put it all together. “Is that vibranium? Is that the real thing?” He reached out to touch the shield, but Steve walked right past him and up to Tony instead.
“Tony?” Bruce sighed after another long pause and put down the phone. “It’s just static.” He ran a hand through his hair nervously. “If he got on that spaceship when Thanos came to Earth, he could be anywhere by now.”
JARVIS muted the TV as the news anchor started asking for anyone who had information about the identity of Spider-Man to come forward to the police.
There was a tense pause, and then Sam snorted.
“Says the genius, billionaire, scientist, engineer, philanthropist…” Steve listed, and Tony had to admit, stoking his ego was working. He grinned. “Hey,” said Steve. “You want to grab some lunch?” He gestured to the hot dog vendor across from them.
- and hadn’t heard from him since. It made him feel antsy, and before he knew it he was formulating apologies for both Peter and Steve in his head that felt less than adequate for the way he had acted.
Tony hated to admit it, but she was right. “Look, I just -” He didn’t have a good excuse for his behavior. “I’m sorry,” he said finally. “Okay? Peter’s just a kid. I am just trying to keep it that way. He doesn’t need his name in the headlines for any reason.”
Peter groaned, and Ned said in a theatrical whisper, “Maybe he’s trying to get you to join the Fantastic Four!”
After taking Natasha’s advice and looking into Tony’s files, Steve was more confused about the man than ever. He thought about Tony all the time - at night, in the shower, even on his morning jog with Sam.
Pepper paused, glared, and then opened her desk drawer and handed him a thin manila folder. Tony opened it to find copies of Steve Carter’s driver’s license and press credentials inside, along with a signed agreement that Steve wouldn’t use the information he gathered to slander SI’s name. Tony wasn’t an expert on identity fraud, but he was pretty sure that it was all real, and if it wasn’t, that the signed form meant they could at least sue him. “I… see you checked all of the boxes,” he said carefully. He should have known better than to question Pepper’s methods.
They had to do something.
Tony stared at him for a minute. “Did he ask why you were here?” He was still suspicious. “He must have been wondering. Your ‘extended’ internship was supposed to be over by now.” He started pacing.
Ned shrugged. “I mean, sure? Where did you get a kitten?”
He realized he was still staring at the spot where Bucky had vanished like he was expecting him to come back.
“And I know it’s all too much for one person to handle,” Steve continued, voicing Tony’s thoughts. “But you’re not alone. I’m right here. And so is Pepper, and May, and MJ, and we’re not going anywhere.” He slid his hand from Tony’s wrist to interlace their fingers. “When Peter’s back, he’ll be here for you, too. So if anything like this ever happens again - and I hope that it won’t, but if it does - you’ll never have to deal with it alone. Okay?”
Close up, the God of Mischief looked the worse for wear: he was thin, bruised, and clearly tired. It seemed like his injuries from a past fight were frozen in time, still there but not healing.
He had died and come back once, but that wouldn’t happen again. If they couldn’t defeat Thanos, then this was the end of the line.
“Can't we just leave him?” MJ asked, deadpan, but she was already grabbing her chair again. Peter did the same, and they approached the spider from behind. They tried to go quietly, but Flash wasn't helping.
“But she doesn’t -”
“It was a long time ago,” Steve said honestly, “and it’s not something I usually bring up the first time I meet someone.”
“Tell us more about this scenario where we win,” she said. “Couldn’t they also use the Time Stone to turn back time? Why does it have to be the Soul Stone?”
Steve stopped reading and went back to the last part:
Tony cleared his throat. “Hello,” he said nonchalantly, like he hadn’t just spent the last half hour scurrying through the streets of New York trying to find him. “Are you following me outside of the Tower now, too?” (The best way to avoid looking guilty was to accuse the other person of the crime. At least, it was according to the plan that Tony just made up on the spot.)
Even though the call clearly said not to search for Peter, Tony’s first reaction was, “Can you trace the call?”
It didn’t take long to find him. Tony landed on top of a building, looking down into an alleyway where two would-be muggers were getting their asses kicked by a vigilante in a red suit and black mask, who had the advantage of being able to climb the walls. He was also shooting the same web-like substance at them, and it was surprisingly strong. It knocked a gun out of one man’s hand - wait, he had a gun? Fuck. Before he could think about it, Tony knocked both guys out with two quick repulsor beams, landing in the dark alley between them and Peter.
Big ones. With red eyes that he could see from all the way up here. And a weird green glow around them.
“I’m Steve Carter, you just said,” he answered cheekily. Even that was a lie, Steve realized. How did people go undercover for months on end? He couldn’t even stand it for a few weeks. “I’m a reporter from Brooklyn.”
Of course, that was before he met Tony Stark.
Tony decided to go to Peter’s house, because if he really had stolen the microscope then that was where it would find it. He met Peter’s aunt - who was surprisingly young - and they were having tea together when Peter finally came home from school, looking completely alarmed to see Tony there. Actually, the word Tony would use was
As Peter descended the stairs, more and more people - students, professors, harried-looking scientists - joined the chaos, looking for an exit. Peter was almost there when he literally ran into Ms. Potts. “Oh, Peter - thank God -” She was clutching a clipboard to her chest, and even as they were pushed a few more steps down the stairs, she managed to check him off a list. “Have you seen Michelle? I think she was listening to a presentation on the 14th floor…” Peter didn't even catch the rest of her sentence before he was dashing back upstairs. “Peter!” He heard Ms. Potts call after him, but he was too busy looking at every face he passed, and too worried because none of them were MJ. Those spiders could crawl up walls, and they were going fast. Clearly, they hadn't found the stairs yet, but it was possible that they had reached the upper floors already. Peter had been one of the first ones to react; he or Pepper would have seen MJ if she'd come down already. Which meant she was still upstairs. He was out of breath by the time he reached the eighth floor again, and he could hear loud clicking outside the stairwell. He pushed down the wave of fear and kept going.
It was a lot of information to process at once. Tony was dead? Who was Stephen Strange? Once again, Steve filtered out the confusing details and focused on what mattered: helping Tony. He lifted him with little effort, carrying him like a lifeless rag doll.
Finally, slowly, after a long beat of silence, Peter tugged the black ski mask off. Even though Tony knew it was him all along, it still came as a shock to see him standing there, looking so young and vulnerable in this dark alleyway in the middle of the night.
“He's an asshole,” MJ supplied helpfully.
Just as Peter’s eyes widened, May came back. “Tony, you should stay for dinner!”
Nat snorted. “He never trusted them, if that’s what you mean. In his reckless phase, he actually used to sleep with reporters, but he always kicked them out right away. Wait, you’re not –”
“Hurry up!” He complained, making a few weak jabs at the spider, too far away to really make an impact. “It's going to eat me or something!”
“How are we going to get Peter back without telling the world who he is?” Bruce asked, voicing everyone else’s thoughts.
On the first floor of Stark Tower, an intern ran through the spinning glass doors, the two coffees in her hand spilling a little as she bumped into someone. She paused only long enough to apologize before hurrying to get the caffeine to Ms. Potts’ office.
“W-what?” Peter stammered, caught out.
Tony sighed. The kid was probably right. He worried too much - wait. “Wait, did you say ‘won’t’ tell him?”
Tony was still convinced that Peter's internship had been a ploy concocted by Pepper to get him to be awake a reasonable hour. It was working remarkably well. After all, the hours Tony spent with Peter were usually productive, even if the kid did talk his ear off for a solid six hours sometimes. Pepper couldn’t stand being in the same room with them because she said there was too much “genius gibberish” going back and forth.
Steve wanted to know - more than he would like to admit - what had happened to Tony. He came when Bruce called because he had picked up the phone thinking it was Tony on the other end. He was ready for their fight to end. Mistakes had been made, and feelings had been hurt, maybe irreparably, but Steve knew that if he just saw Tony face to face that they could fix things, or at least try to work together. He wasn’t sure they would ever fully get past it, but he needed Tony at a time like this. There were more times than he could count in the last few years that he had looked around for Tony only to be disappointed; he often had problems he knew Tony could solve but no way to contact him. And now, there were bigger fights to be won. Their arguments seemed petty and ridiculous in comparison to the battle against Thanos. Steve needed Tony now more than ever.
“Steve can go.”
Peter didn’t even blink. “I told him that there was some stuff you and Bruce started working on while I was an intern that I found interesting and you let me hang around sometimes to check it out. Don’t worry. I made it seem like I was just a huge nerd.”
After a long moment when Steve just listened to Tony steady his breathing, Tony finally said, “I didn’t think we were speaking.” There was a moment of breathless silence as Steve slowly let go of his hand, and then Tony huffed a humorless laugh.
The third man finally chimed in. He had a deep, intimidating voice that put Peter’s spidey sense on high alert. “Do you really think Stark will fall for it?”
So there was a new plan.
“Phil Coulson, it’s an honor to meet you,” he said. When Natasha coughed and said, “Nerd,” under her breath, Coulson just rolled his eyes.
That afternoon, Steve snuck into the basement of SHIELD, where they kept all the paper files in rows and rows of file cabinets. It wasn’t hard to find Tony’s again; they were in alphabetical order. Of course, that also meant that the heavy file labeled
At floor twelve, he heard the distinctive sound of repulsors. The relief he felt was overwhelming. Iron Man. Tony. He would help them. The sound of repulsor blasts - picking off the spiders one by one, Peter guessed - followed him up the stairs until he finally, finally reached floor fourteen. The relief faded when he saw that the door was halfway off its hinges.
Pepper had also pointed out that Peter was the only person for whom Tony would stop working and pay attention. Tony explained that it was because Peter was smart and often insightful, and Tony could use someone on his level to talk to once in awhile. Pepper gently reminded him that he didn’t do the same for Bruce. Although he refused to admit it to Pepper, Tony grudgingly admitted to himself that he was a sucker for Peter’s puppy-eyed look.
tell with journalists.” He didn’t want to tell Peter about last night when he caught Steve on the phone, because he hadn’t even figured out how to feel about that yet, but he needed Peter to understand this. He pulled to a sudden stop in front of Peter’s apartment building. “I know Steve seems nice, but you can’t trust everybody. Reporters always have an ulterior motive, even when they seem genuine. You just have to be careful, Peter. I just want you to be safe. Honestly, what were you even doing out patrolling that late, after the party? You know, with great power comes -”
May started to recount the timeline of events to Pepper, who wrote it down so they could share their notes with the police when they called.
“For what it’s worth, I’m sorry,” he said in a whisper. “I knew something was coming. I just didn’t know it was going to be this bad. I thought - if we could get some oversight, maybe the weight of the world wouldn’t be on our shoulders all of the time.”
Strange continued, “I was in possession of the Time Stone. Before appearing here, I was on Titan facing Thanos alongside Anthony Stark, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and - the Spider-Boy.”
“Hey, we just saved your butt,” said Tony, still wrapped in Steve’s arms and showing no signs of going anywhere. “We get a happy ending, too.”
“Right. And what did I tell you that you should do when that happens?”
“Johnny Storm is going to be so excited when she finds out you were rescued by Captain America,” said Ned. “The cat,” he clarified when his friends just looked at him blankly. “Storm? I told her about you guys. She knows you’re Spider-Man. It’s okay that I told her, right?”
“Thanos is your - father?” He asked carefully.
(See the end of the chapter for
As Steve wasn’t actually a reporter, he had very little interest in starting that conversation. He was also mildly suspicious that Pepper was just trying to enlist help in distracting every journalist in the building by forcing them to look somewhere other than at Tony, who was now grabbing Steve by the arm, intentionally this time. “Actually, Pep, I was just going to get Steve a drink. The man deserves to be armed when he faces the wolves.” He dragged Steve away, and Pepper was immediately caught up in a conversation with another guest, eager to please everyone.
“Checking security footage,” said JARVIS in his ear. “Mr. Carter is headed north on 5
“I saw that Anthony would be instrumental in returning the universe to its previous state,” said Strange, which didn’t actually answer Peter’s question. “He and Steven Rogers are imperative to this outcome.”
“Bet I could build one before they leave,” said Tony, and some of the interns looked excited at the prospect, finally showing some interest in something.
“I - okay.” Steve’s baby blue-eyed gaze was clearer than it had been before, and Tony could practically see his mind racing with this new information. He got the sense that Steve wanted to say something else, but was holding back.
“Phil,” he said, a bit desperately.
“I did
He wasn’t looking at her face, but he felt MJ rolling her eyes at him. “You said he was tall and blonde and that Tony hated him on sight.”
“You know why I don’t want a reporter in here snooping around,” Tony replied with his arms crossed over his chest. He gestured to where Peter had just been standing. “If he gets any idea -
“I’m afraid that won’t be possible,” said Tony tersely, already annoyed for reasons he couldn’t quite explain. “We’re very busy here, you see,” he said to the reporter, whose blue eyes definitely weren’t distracting behind glasses that somehow made him more attractive. “Doing, uh,” he looked around, “science. Very advanced stuff. Which will take a long time. We can’t just give every journalist who wanders in here a story. I’m sure you understand.”
Curiosity got the better of him for a brief moment and Steve shuffled through Howard’s file, most of it containing blueprints and designs that he couldn’t begin to comprehend, and some photos that Steve was in. It made his heart twist. Then he reminded himself that he came down here to learn about Tony.
“Wait, Oscorp is going to be there?” MJ appeared next to them, and as usual, Peter was not far behind. MJ leveled a look at Pepper. “You didn't mention that before.”
A black and white kitten poked her nose out at Ned. Being friends with Peter was weird.
First, Peter started sticking to walls. This information was concerning to both him and Tony. They conferred with Bruce, trying to figure out if this was the only effect of the spider bite - because it was obvious that Peter's new ability could only be the result of the mutant spiders.
“Tony,” Steve interrupted.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve’s blue eyes were wide, but he didn’t try to push Tony off.
As Peter woke - minutes or hours or days later, he wasn’t sure - he slowly realized that his spidey sense was going crazy, his whole body tense, on edge. His hands were tied behind his back. As he slowly opened his eyes, he had the dizzying realization that he was laying on the ground but tied to a chair - clearly, at some point, he had moved around too much and knocked himself over, or maybe his captors left him like that just to further inconvenience him.
Steve hoped he had emphasized to Pepper that he meant no ill will, and she seemed to trust him. She also seemed to run things. That was working to his advantage so far. He wondered if Pepper could convince Tony to trust him, but he doubted it.
Steve’s heart was pounding in his chest. “I’m Captain America,” he finished, feeling a little more confident now that he’d said it aloud. “I’m sorry I didn’t tell you sooner, but I had my orders.” He paused, bracing for Tony’s reaction, but there was no reply. “Tony?”
Steve had been Steve the Reporter for less than a week, and he was already struggling to stay undercover. He was surprised to find that he wanted to keep his identity a secret for a while longer - not just because he wanted to complete the mission and find out what Tony had to do with Spider-Man, but because even in the span of a few short days, he had grown fond of Tony and Pepper and even Peter, who was a bright, charming kid. He could see why Tony was protective of him. And Steve had a feeling that there were layers to Tony Stark that he hadn't even begun to understand. He didn't enjoy lying, but he was willing to stay undercover for a few more weeks if it meant getting to know Tony. Of course, he didn't want to think of what came after that.
- that the kid has powers -”
Science and Tech Day was cool. That was the only way of describing it. They walked into a huge atrium with balconies as high as they could see, where every kind of invention was on display: from hover-boards and robots that did chores to holographic displays and an actual flying car (“Completely impractical,” Tony scoffed).
They acted as if the Soul World was still a mystery to them, and meanwhile, they plotted their own demise. They would wait for Thor to carry out his plan, because there was a slim possibility that it would work, and as Tony pointed out, “The fewer literal human sacrifices we need to make, the better.”
Ned looked at her blankly. “What guy?”
“Then what is it?” Tony demanded, and Steve didn’t answer right away. “I get it. It’s your job,” he continued, shaking Steve a little. “It’s your job to find the next scoop and to write the next big headline -”
a second voice said urgently. Male. It sounded vaguely familiar.
Strange frowned. “I believe we will, if the scenario I saw plays out on Earth. When Thanos is defeated, then the Soul Stone can be used to reverse the removal of half of the universe.”
“Oh, yeah. Shit. Listen, kids, if he gives you any trouble just remind him that Oscorp had to file for bankruptcy after their new ‘untraceable’ cell phones started biting people.”
“As a matter of fact, you can, Ms. Potts,” said Tony, doing his best to act like someone who was normally awake at this hour. “I just stopped by to see what was on the agenda for today.”
After laughing at a story about the time Peggy had woken him up by dumping water on his head, Tony asked, “Is she still around? You talk about her like this was all in the past.”
“What’s wrong, sweetheart?” She had asked, pulling him into a hug. Even if it was nothing more than a tough day at school, she wanted him to know that she was always there for him, no matter what. She wished he would open up to her more but she also knew she couldn’t force it.
Tony didn't realize it at the time, but that night, he accidentally adopted New York City's youngest superhero.
“It’s just me,” he said automatically, before realizing that maybe it wasn’t comforting for Tony to wake up to him anymore. He felt his face flush. What if Tony just wanted him to leave? “You were shouting,” he added softly. “I’m sorry to wake you, but it seemed like you were having a nightmare.”
“No! No,” said Steve hurriedly. He was still partly convinced that she could read minds. Nat took a sip of wine to hide her smirk, and he rushed to say, “That’s not why I’m asking. I was just wondering if it was me.”
On the third day after everyone vanished, a ship appeared in the sky. It careened into a field just outside of Wakanda and for a few tenuous, stretching moments, everyone was on edge, waiting. Then, a girl emerged from the small, broken ship. There seemed to be no one else with her. She wore a suit of armour like a knight, and her face was painted in bright colors. She didn’t look threatening. Well - on any other day, Steve might have been wary of her. She almost certainly was armed. But she wasn’t Thanos, and she didn’t look like one of his minions.
he didn’t yell after him desperately as Peter disappeared inside, but he thought it, feeling conflicted. Was this what it was like to have a son? He didn’t need Peter to look up to him or anything like that, although it was nice, but he wanted Peter to take his advice. Tony wasn’t trying to lecture him. He was just trying to make Peter understand the lessons that he’d had to learn the hard way - once, twice, six times over.
Finally, he reached the relevant part of the story. It didn’t make him feel any better.
Last time, he’d been back by morning. “He’ll be back in the morning and you can yell at him then,” she told herself. “You can’t call the police until the morning anyway because he’s only been missing for a few hours at most. He was back by the morning. He’ll be back in the morning.”
Peter hit his head hard, and everything went dark for a while.
Then again, there was still a stubborn part of him that wasn’t entirely sure he should trust Steve. Things had been off with him from the start. Sure, he was handsome, nice, interesting - and a good kisser, Tony could admit - but he still didn’t really know much about him. Even after hearing about Steve’s past, something still didn’t sit quite right. Tony tried to tell himself that he could fix things with Steve, and he wanted to, but it was hard to ignore the persistent feeling that something about Steve was suspicious - maybe it was the timing of his arrival, the questions he asked, or the glasses that he clearly didn’t need. There was something that Tony was missing, some essential clue he had overlooked….
“Shut up, Tony.” He managed to rasp lowly. Because none of it mattered anymore. An explosion, bodies, Bucky and Tony both gone.
From this angle his rank insignia and skull pin gleamed brilliantly. Every last inch of his uniform was pressed and in its place. Sharp silver and black.
Remembering the contents of the flask, Bucky fumbled for it with one hand. He unscrewed the top with gritted teeth and swigged back a few deep swallows of the brew inside, bracing himself for the sharp taste of horseradish and pepper.
Home. He could go home. He had a home.
"I'll ride in the car with you and the children." He decided, and the Baroness looked at him her gratefulness evident in the shine of her eye and the way she slowly released her death grip on her purse.  Belatedly Deiter looked to his captain who was thankfully nodding his approval. "Perhaps that's best. We can't be too careful."
He took a deep breath.
“So,” Stefen took a breath, his expression clearing somewhat.
?” he snarled, the agony turned to bitter resolve as he yanked Dvorak’s hand away and pressed down harder with the gun. “Well did it work? Did it?!”
He could see the calculation on his face, the barely suppressed greed as Göring asked, “My god, you aren’t Hughard Stark’s son are you? I didn’t-”
After supper was had and in those few hours of leisure before bed Natacha quietly made her way to her father's study. She knocked on the door and when he invited her in she slipped inside, shutting the door quietly behind her.
"What should we do if they don't find us?" James heard Péter whisper quietly to Natacha, and James bit his lip to keep from snapping at him that he should have thought of that before they ran away from the police and became traitors.
Would he be pleased that Tony had worn some of the clothing he’d had tailored for him? Surely he couldn’t know how Tony had wondered about that, wondered if Stefen had left it to the salesman, or if he’d gone through the selections himself, thinking on how the fine fabrics would feel against the skin and what cuts and lines would make Tony’s legs look longer, shoulders broader.
sister

The prospect of having a countess pay them a visit might have had the house in a tizzy in the past, but it remained a shell of what it once was. Even with Pepper spreading the news that Stefen was on the mend, the staff were slow to trickle back. They could hardly explain to anyone what had really happened, and no one wanted to risk their own health after witnessing his close brush with death.
“I gave them a future
“Is it your intention to remain employed here?” The slender young housekeeper demanded to know. She barely allowed Tony to babble a sound or two in affirmation before she smartly informed him that antics like the ones he’d pulled the previous night and just moments before on the front steps would see him promptly dismissed.
She put her hands against his chest and pushed as hard as she could, snarling when it did nothing to move him.
Tony, leaning against the side of the pen, laughing as if the question were stupid. Eyes narrowing on Steve now, accusing.
Maybe, when he got home Da would even teach him how to play his mandolin.
Evolve.
Tony had a theory to test.
Tony made no move to remove his own clothing and Steve frowned. Was it the audience they had? Given the circumstances, no one was going to see the action as anything but practical and necessary. So why was Tony just standing there awkwardly?
“You can still take pictures in the meanwhile, can’t you?” he questioned and Péter shrugged again.
Tony held his breath. He waited, but Stefen did not answer. He was staring through Tony now, seeing more than what was there, and Tony could only hope that whatever thoughts had swept him away were the ones he’d planted and not the nightmares that so often haunted Stefen.
“He’s a friend. A friend from the abbey.” Tony, realizing shamefully late for a genius what Clinton was likely doing there, scrambled to think of what to tell Natacha, who had her hands fisted on her hips in a distressingly Pepper-like way that did not bode well for keeping Pepper uninvolved.
Steve thought those might be the most beautiful words in any language.
“Themen. I don’t know much about clothes but your mother used to shop here. Susann really knows her way around a needle so…” Steve shrugged, hoping Natacha wouldn’t be too disappointed.
Natacha, sat beside Steve on the couch, looked up from her knitting.
Tony had heard him whisper so often as they made love in the darkness.
“Are you alright?” Tony asked.
There was so much he wanted to say. Needed to say, Tony thought as he took a deep shaky breath in and let it out slowly.
“Perfect.” Stefen decided with a satisfied smile, leaning back slightly to observe Tony in it for a moment before meeting his eyes once more. He looked so happy, as if finally, something wrong had been set to rights. Tony couldn’t take it. His heart felt like it was going to burst in his chest.
He looked up and his eyes met Bucky’s, contrite, grateful and equal parts determined.
“It’s still Captain until the official placement is offered and pending my acceptance,” Steve answered in reply, mouth tight. Turning to his notes he glanced up at Loki only briefly to indicate he may wish to pay close attention. “There are other officers in our network who can provide additional intelligence, some with higher clearance levels than I, but at present I estimate roughly six hundred thousand men across thirty-seven infantry divisions.
Trading a wary glance with him Stefen opened his mouth to call out to the person seeking entry to wait just a moment, but the knob on the door was already twisting, and a moment later a small blond head of curls appeared, the rest of Sara's s cherub like frame following not far behind.
"Gypsies." Péter confirmed in a small voice.
Bucky cleared the block his throat, which had suddenly gone tight. What was he doing? It was Christmas. Laura was dead and she’d never been family. Not the way he needed or wanted. What was left of his family was
Foolish, idiot, utterly insane (wonderful) boy! Tony cursed as he grabbed ahold of the moving body in the water. It was hard to see even in relatively clear (for a lake anyway) waters what with the streams of bubbles they were rucking up, but he felt James slip his arms around his neck, his fingers grasping to find purchase. The combination of his struggles and the sudden addition of his weight dragging them both further under.
“What does it look like?” He snapped, in no mood or mindset for another fight. “The children will sleep with us tonight.”
The end, when it came was like a lot of endings. No matter how many warning signs there were, or how prepared they tried to make themselves, there was no preparing them for when the trap sprung. It happened barley two days after the baroness had departed. They'd put the children to bed that night and Tony had gone to the captain’s room for a glass of schnapps and the evening chat that never ended, as he did most nights. He was well in the habit by now of waking before the maids arrived, and with Stefen's dedication to early morning exercises he had a ready excuse for being in the captain's room in the wee hours of morning.
Rogers held Tony’s gaze and Tony could see the anger in his eyes. He wasn’t a man who liked to be cornered. But he wasn’t made of stone either and Tony refused to balk, meeting the man’s stare and digging deeper for some hint of what he might be feeling behind that stony mask.
“For play clothes, something they can get dirty.”
His little green book opened easily, the pages worn to a soft almost velvety texture. He traced a finger over the letters,
“But then they stopped coming. That was bad because the whole family was starving and nobody could find work unless they were willing to get shipped off to the salt mines, and that was a death sentence. So you’d go stand in a line all day hoping for a days work and they’d take one look at you and spit.
“The uncles all played, Ludo in particular took him under his wing. Bucky’s Da always preferred the lute.” Stefen recalled. His voice was low and Tony wondered if Stefen was conscious of the way it slipped into that rough accented lit that Tony had begun to associate with country roads and Bakhuizen, when he said, “My grandfather made him his first violin. Made something for us both actually.”
“You startled me.” He ground out, accusing, because she of all the children knew better than to startle him.
The girl’s cheeks flushed red again and Pepper heaved an exasperated sigh. Patting her on the shoulder Tony departed, smile fading away as her heard Pepper take the girl by the arm and say something about paying him no mind.
“Aye Captain, but step lightly now, we’re here.”
He’d made it just to the end of the hall before he heard the patter of little feet behind him.
Ian sat up, suddenly very alert in his chair, dropping his knife with a resounding clatter that startled the table so keenly caught on the unfolding drama.
“They’ll all get by without you, you know. You can always write letters when you miss us, and you’ll be home before you know it for fall break.” Tony murmured from the seat beside him, maybe reading Peter’s mind, or perhaps just familiar enough with the way he thought to guess.
Tony sat up, the movement making his neck twinge.
~*~*~*~
"I know it's not. " Tony immediately snapped in reply, furious that Stefen would dismiss him so easily, and in that particular way. "I didn’t think it was a game when it was you and Bucky against a camp full of SS!”
~*~*~
Tony nodded to show that he understood, and continued to rock the sobbing boy in his arms. Stefen looked as if he wanted to say more, but after a moment he just clenched his jaw, laying a hand briefly upon Tony’s shoulder before he moved past them.
“You don’t seem all that surprised that I have company,” Steve opened, taking the reins of the conversation and hoping to catch the man off guard. Something told him Filip Coulson was a man rarely caught off guard however.
(See the end of the chapter for
“And here he told me he didn’t like to dance.”
Stefen drew in a short breath, and Tony’s eyes flew to the unconscious movement of his thumb brushing around the mark of teeth in his apple.
Tony said it offhandedly as if it was just a given that Tony would want Steve with him, sleep or no sleep. Steve frowned.
Best leave the heroics to the fighting men went unsaid. Tony chafed at the implication, but Stefen's eyes begged him to relent, begged him not to push; but it wasn't that in the end that made Tony back down.
“Yes. They’re very excited. I hope you have your evening cleared because they have a list of demands already.”
“Henrick.” His ruined voice sounded foreign even to his own ears. Please. He tried to say but his voice just cracked and the sound that came out of his throat wasn’t intelligible. Dvorak huffed a low laugh in response to the sound, shaking his head.
“Stef-,” Tony began, but there was a clamor from downstairs and then the sound of several pairs of feet stomping up the stairs. He saw it in Stefen’s eyes, how his heart jumped up into his throat at the same time as Tony’s did, because Hogan had apparently brought home a herd of elephants. Tony was at the door a moment later thinking that those had better be
Natacha was already dressed for the day, hair perfectly pleated, and Ian was noticeably in his clothes meant for exercise and play.
The children watched him with distrust (not that Tony blamed them after their last lesson). Not a single one of them volunteered an answer.
James stared at him for half a second, shocked into silence right along with Maria, and then his face clouded in a familiar storm of temper and he opened his mouth- no doubt to shriek and carry on- but Tony cut him off before the tantrum could even get started.
Glass shattered loudly within the room, snapping Steve out of the hurricane of white noise and horrific images in his head.
anomalies in their physicality and social behaviors.
“You know
He was holding his breath. Damn it. It wasn't his job to look after Rogers!
“Did it eat him?” Artur asked between his fingers and Stefen chuckled.
"We don't know. It could be a trap. We don't know if the Gestapo got here before us."
As Tony walked them back toward the bank, water lapping at their shoulders, James shivered against his chest.
“Am I supposed to know these people?” he sneered in defense and Nik slapped the piano top with a firm hand. Tony jumped to his feet, his fingers dragging over the keys in a discordant jangle of notes.
“Péter? Do you need us to stop, Péter? We can stop.”
“The list of names. It goes without saying that you are to show this to no one. The magazines are only to be sent to those listed as subscribers. No one is to be added to that list accept through myself or James and we will always do so in person.”
“What’s wrong?” Steve asked, and he was suddenly right there. Right in front of Bu0cky, taking up his vision and blocking out everything else. Bucky grinned, a nervous animal showing all his teeth.
Natacha stared, and somehow managed to give him the impression that she was rolling her eyes at him without moving them at all.
“Of course it’s rigged Tony.” Steve rolled his eyes, mouth stretched in a grin.
The SS officers outnumber the Wehrmacht two to one, swivels of black drowning out the gray of the Wehrmacht uniform. But here between the walls of the Führer’s home it was never clearer that it didn't matter what uniform they wore. They were all the same.
"What's the matter?" Péter asked warily, pausing with the rope when he noticed the odd stillness that had taken over Tony. "Do you hear something?"
Péter gaped at him, shocked by the tears that were in the man’s eyes. He’d seen few grown men cry in his lifetime and could not fathom that his simple little gift could reduce someone to tears.
“As for Stark Industries, you were given twenty percent controlling stock in the company which was to be held in trust by your uncle, Isiah Carboni. It looks as if he may have been pressured to sell shortly after your parents died. Stanislov now holds the stocks but I daresay not legally. We can fight that in court.”
“Don’t worry, I’m too fast for him,” Steve assured Maria who had her hands clutched tightly to her chest in worry.
Tony yanked the door open and Stefen's eyes widened, surprised by the sudden motion. For a moment they just stood on opposite sides staring at one another.
"Vis, good to see you. You weren't followed?" Bucky asked after shaking the man's hand, peering past him toward the door which Lang had already shut behind the departing priest as if he half expected gestapo to come charging up the hall. Vis shook his head and answered Bucky in a low voice, "We were careful. I've brought the papers. Any word from the tailor?" He reached inside his breast pocket and withdrew a small packet of papers extending them towards Bucky who took them with a short shake of his head.
Without thinking, Steve slipped his hand into his pocket, pulling out his little velvet bag of beads. He allowed himself to marvel once more at their beautiful deep red hue as he rolled a few idly between his fingers.
“But Herr Stark, you’ve not told us what our mission is,” Péter reminded him.
Through the window, behind the doctors bent head, Steve could see the garden. Sam was hard at work clearing out the flower beds. Spring had come back to the villa.
Da gave him a weak smile.
“There’s an unfortunate darkness to it, but that’s easily explained. Your mother was quite dark and it’s well known she comes from a long line of venetian nobility.” Frau Ursala was saying as Tony approached. She tapered off when Tony cleared his throat and both women turned to look at him.
“Are you going to start the car?” Ian asked, breaking the silence. Oh. Right. He glanced to the passenger’s side where Natacha sat, staring out her window at nothing, seemingly oblivious to Tony’s mood or his momentary lapse in focus.
Well, he kept telling himself throughout the long train ride. It was good practice for them all because he’d only have to do it again in a few weeks time when he met the captain in Berlin. A far happier reason to be making the trek into Germany.
It was only wise. This was his life after all. His untarnished name was his last measure of defense. The heart could say what it wanted to, but Tony was good at compartmentalizing problems and looking at things logically.
Tony returned the smile, elated, his brain spinning with ideas.
“For all that they despised one another, Isiah and my father were the same. To them I am the consequence of my mother’s choices. I am both her rejection of you, your teachings, and your way of life; as well as the uncomfortable reminder that such things can never truly be discarded.
Before he could explain that it had been a gift from the captain, she flitted away with a cheeky wink to join Bucky and the members of the band who were setting up nearby. Coulson’s warnings of her name being on a watch list, and the certainty that she would be followed from the party and possibly detained and questioned about the whereabouts of the war book filled him with fear for her.
She didn't want to break her father or his heart. She'd learned that too late. She didn't need him to stop trying to protect her or underestimating her, as long as he forgave her for following her own heart. The way Bucky had always done.
). He didn't listen. He didn't obey.
“Christ in heaven!” Tony cursed, tasting blood in his mouth from where he’d bit his tongue and turning to spit in the dirt beside the door before turning back to hiss in demand at the boy who’d just literally dropped in on him. “Clinton, you imp. What the hell are you doing here at this time of night?!”
. The sister could pass for a gypsy! I don’t care what anyone says, Major Rogers is a cuckold.”
“We can make more,” he assured her. And she nodded, murmuring, “I’ve seen Willamina make it before. Though now I wish I’d paid better attention.” Together they filled the bucket with the boiling water and somehow managed to get it upstairs without scalding themselves.
“Do you want to be excused?” It wasn't a question. Steve didn't tolerate bullying among his children and Péter knew that. A hard bit of morality to install when the outside world had decided to sanction it.
He sometimes looked at his da and thought there might be something like that hanging round his neck. The thing that turned him into the Captain and not ‘da’. It felt like his da had always had it, whatever it was, and if that where the case then maybe…maybe Ian had it too.
“You know how to fix it, don’t you Tony?!”
Releasing his frustration in a mostly silent huff of breath Tony shifted in his chair to ease the soreness in his back and wondered not for the first time in as many minutes, when they could get the hell out of there and back to their rented home. The only good news was that Bucky had plans to be away for the night (if the way he was staring down the dress on that brunette woman who’d been clinging on his arm all night was any indication) and Tony could steal his single room.
But it wasn’t to be, because there was a gentle rap on the study door a moment later and Charlotte’s voice intruded. She was apologetic but insistent that she must discuss something or other with him before she retired for the night.
Even so, he’d taken a terrible risk ripping that flag in front of Hammer. But it was done now and if his loyalty to the family could not be counted on, Steve counted on the man’s good sense to know that it would be his word against the rest of the house if he went to the authorities.
"She can't," Ian tried to mitigate. "Tony’s not a slave. He will come back when his aunt is better."
~*~*~*~*0*~*~*~*~
“Fuck you, no Stefen fuck you for saying that!” Bucky growled. “They’re my family too. And maybe it’s easy for you to forget where ya come from, but they are rounding people up out there.” Bucky swung his arm, gesturing out over the lake as if it stood in for all of the Reichland.
“We’d only just married, before the Germans came. My silly idea. I thought it would make us stronger somehow, facing the future together. But it was divorce quietly or lose his job and possibly face imprisonment for betraying his blood; Hank is very attached to his work.”
Deiter sighed, a headache pounding darkly behind his eyes as he left the villa that morning.
"Yes, we've kept a very close record of all that you say Herr Hammer. You say that Major Rogers speaks out against his superiors and allows his children's teacher, a man you believe he is having an unnatural affair with, to go against the state curriculum. You say that he has offered refuge to undesirables and that a monk – of all things – is building weapons and selling them to rebels right under our noses. You’ve even gone so far as to suggest that in a fit of temper, Major Rogers desecrated the flag in broad daylight, surrounded by witnesses." Lt. Stevens recounted succinctly.
Ian stared back at him, mouth firmly set.
She shook her head with a look of gravity that Tony thought had no business on the face of a child and said before turning away, “for Father.”
"A pain in the ass, sir?" Lt. Becker suggested good naturally. Dvořák laughed. That was right. Becker enjoyed the good Captain. Thought of him fondly like, some irritating sibling.
-The Road-
“Please. Da please. I'm old enough. I won’t be scared. I-I won’t miss, I-"
“Captain Khalmmer!” Steve cut over Göring, voice measured and unflinching. “I’m asking now. What happened at Dachau?”
November 11
Maybe she had cried that day and maybe she hadn’t, but the first thing she did when they finally pulled up to the villa and Frau Hogan was there, throwing open the door to rush out and meet them, was to burst into tears and run into the woman’s arms. There was some yelling and commotion from the rest of the children as they were set upon by Charlotte and the rest of the house staff, which quickly dissolved into tears and weepy accounts of their ordeal. The bravery that Steve had demanded from them reaching its limit now that they were home.
“You’ll be my guest Tony, no one will mind.” Stefen countered with a hopeful smile.
Bucky threw back his head and laughed.
Tony blinked blearily down at the little girl who squirmed in the bed next to him wondering how on earth she’d gotten there before he remembered that she’d joined them in the middle of the night, chased by a bad dream.
“Well Anton, I am a Stark. I’m not sure humility is in my blood.” Tony replied with a lazy grin and a titter went through the crowd in response. Tony’s arrogance had a unique way of charming people even though they should want to hit him. Steve should know.  Vonkov’s mouth puckered like he’d sucked on a lemon and there was such a gleam of rage in his eyes, that Stefen knew without a doubt he was one of the rare few who fell on the side of wanted to hurt rather than wanting to laugh.
Tony cut him off. “I am. Because I’m going to contact the others and offer myself and they are going to accept because they will see I. Am.The. most. Capable. There is no reason I shouldn’t go to Dachau.”
Steve reached for his knife.
~*~*~
(See the end of the chapter for
Stefen opened his mouth to deliver some retort, no doubt equally snappish, but at that moment the telephone on the desk began to ring the shrill sound startling them both so that they whipped their heads around rather comically to stare at it.
It was making the hair stand on the back of his neck. The housekeeper could stay if she liked, but Dvorak could not stand to watch another second.  He turned and slipped into the hall.
Hotel Riviera 1904
Her dark coils and deep brown eyes could have been from her French mother's side, her step father obviously having no hand in her looks. Dvořák had never needed to wonder at some first father the family neither knew or spoke of. They were good Catholics and loyal Germans, but these days the uncertainty was as much damning as any evidence. All over the country people were discovering grandparents and spouses who had converted from Judaism, whom under the Führer’s new laws still counted as Jews.
“You don’t sound so sure. I know for a fact that they hate my guts. Maybe I’ll just drop you off or something.”
His stomach rumbles again, reminding him of why he had gotten out of bed in the first place. Steve leaves the bedroom in search of two things: food and Tony.
Steve sighs. “Yeah.”
She had been 9 when he was born. The age gap between them wasn’t terribly big and she was still able to enjoy his presence without him being a bother. Some days she wished Harley was closer to her age, but that was only on the days when Peter refused to play with her.
The pain was excruciating, but it was evident that it was impacting others a little more. Bucky is silent, just like he has been ever since the night he lost his best friend. At the funeral he had finally let out his emotions, but it was obvious he was still holding back.
The uneasy looks don’t go unnoticed. Sam does his best to ignore them, but it’s difficult when he’s just as nervous about his husband’s behavior.
“Yes!” Steve laughs. “I’m pregnant.”
A part of Steve wants to punch Tony in the face and slam the door, but the other half argues against that idea, reminding him that he had wanted Tony to come back.
Hey guys. Sorry for the late update. I swear I’ve been trying to get my stories updated but I’m struggling, especially now after hearing about Chadwick. I’m devastated and honestly feel horrible. It’s hitting me so hard and no one in my family understands. Sorry I just wanted to get that off my chest. Anyway, thank you so much for your wonderful support. It means a lot ❤️❤️❤️
“I can...I can go home?”
“There you go. You were just hungry. You’re always hungry, huh?” Steve chuckles. He gently strokes her hair while she eats, smiling when she peers up at him. She lays a tiny hand against his chest. “Daddy will be home soon. I know you miss him.”
“He did say it was going to be the bestest Halloween ever.”
“Yes, sir,” Jarvis replies, “May I suggest you try getting some yourself.”
“Okay I never did that.”
“What a waste of a letter.” Bucky frowns.
He had been sure he’d never get that simple life he had wanted. The idea had been thrown away the moment he thought he lost Tony forever. They were never supposed to have found each other again, but here they were, with a son and soon to be married. It was better than anything Steve had envisioned.
“You don’t need to do that. We’re here for you, Pete.”
“I just want him to talk to me.”
Steve kicks him off. “Begging doesn’t work on me.”
“You sure? Those muffins might need it more than me. Have you had one?”
“It’s fine. If I need it then...it’s fine.”
“The pain?”
Tony peers up at Steve when he hears him sniff. Steve’s a wreck, his eyes giving away just how much pain he’s really in. Tony wants to comfort him too, but he needs to get his daughter somewhere else first.
Steve Rogers was a friend, a brother, and more importantly, a father. Steve was selfless, ready to risk everything for his friends and family. And just like his alter ego, he was brave and ready to stand up for what he believed in.
“So that alpha...he’s still looking for him?”
“Oh right because of…”
“Yeah,” Steve says, his eyes roaming over the pile of boxes that are waiting for him to open. He blows out a breath and runs a hand through his hair.
“Fuck!” Tony nearly shouts and Steve flinches from the outburst. “Sorry,” Tony apologizes, his tone a little calmer. He runs a hand through his hair and begins pacing, all while muttering every curse in the book.
Yay I got my power back on! It’s still cold but at least I can write again!
Tony’s eyes follow Peter’s outstretched hand and land on the round cake on the counter. It’s been decorated to look like Steve’s shield. The star isn’t perfect and the blue icing is mixing in with the red, but none of that matters. Peter made it with love and Steve would be proud if he could see it.
“Soon. Why don’t you stay here for a while. They need you, kid,” Tony replies.
“I promise,” Tony says again, this time more stern. “I won’t let them. I won’t let them hurt you or our baby.”
“It’s okay to be scared. I get that now. You’re this brave hero that will stop at nothing to make things right, and I guess I never thought you could break. But it’s okay that you did. It doesn’t make you less brave, or strong; it just means you’re human. We all have those days, and I never ever want you to feel ashamed about them. Just promise me you’ll tell me when it gets too much. I’ll be there.”
Tony thanks her and she nods her head.
Peter frowns. “You’re still talking about it.”
“Yes!” Peter cheers and throws himself at Tony, wrapping his arms around his neck and hugging him tightly. “Thank you, dad.”
Natasha releases a deep sigh and leans back against the couch. “If you say so. You’re so stubborn.”
“I’ll get the team together-”
The alpha falls to the floor. “Hail...Hydra.”
“Steve, you need to stay with me,” Nat urges, “the team will be here in a few minutes.”
She’s curious, that much Steve can tell. And maybe one day he’ll tell her everything, but he didn’t know the small group Tony insisted was both of their friends well enough and they’d just have to wait a little while longer until he felt comfortable to open up to them.
The sound of his pup’s distress has Steve leaning in close to get a look at Tony’s phone. Steve frowns when he takes in the sight of Happy’s slightly disheveled hair and the green and blue scribbles along his face.
Tony doesn’t reply and instead gives his mate a look over. The wounds on Steve’s face have already started to fade, and the bruises have changed from ugly purples to pale yellows and greens. The skin around his eye is slightly swollen and the gash on his cheek is already healing nicely.
Pepper rolls her eyes and leaves the office, shutting the door behind her. Tony lets out a heavy sigh and rises to his feet, deciding he wasn’t in the mood to work today.
It’s been too long since they’ve kissed like this.
“You’re the best,” Tony says when Pepper helps him discard the dirty tie and adjust the new one around his neck.
“Of course. Pretty soon your brother is going to be here.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s okay. I can finish his room.”
It was a lot harder to pick out a name than Steve anticipated. He had been given plenty of suggestions since he had learned that he was having a boy. Sam Jr. was out just like Bucky Jr. failed to make the cut. His friends meant well but his son deserved his own name.
“Steve, talk to me,” Bruce says.
Peter doesn’t tell anyone about the idea to meet his dad. They haven’t said it to his face, but he knows how they feel about him. He’s heard the fighting between his family and between them and his father. His dad was not well liked among their small family. And Peter understood why.
“Let me win? Nope. I’ll kick your butt this time.”
“Are you sure?” Steve appears wary, not that Tony blames him. It was difficult at times to take care of Morgan, especially when both of them were running on very little sleep. But Tony was confident he could manage just fine.
Morgan is still fussing when Tony returns. The cries she produces are always different, and little by little he’s beginning to understand what each one means. There were days when he had no idea what his daughter really wanted. But this cry he knew by heart.
“Yeah.” Peter smiles.
Maybe that was for the best. Tony didn’t deserve Steve. He didn’t deserve to have a happy marriage and life with him. Steve deserved someone who was going to love him unconditionally and make him happy.
“Who’s ‘we’?”
“Yeah.” Steve smiles at the thought. He always wanted a big family. He never thought he’d get that chance, but now he had a son and the possibility of more children.
Steve chokes back a sob and Tony wraps his arms around him, bringing him close until Steve is pressed against him. Steve clings to him tightly, releasing the sobs that wrack through him.
The lock on the door clicks and Steve snaps his head up in its direction. It opens, the sound of the metal scraping along the concrete floor makes him sick to his stomach. He backs himself further into a corner when two alphas enter the room. The warning growl he gives them does nothing to keep them away.
“Steve, did I...did I hurt you like he did?”
The walls continue to crack and cave in, pieces of concrete falling around him. It’s the heavy smoke in the air that makes getting out difficult. Peter coughs when the smoke rushes into his lungs. He hacks and sputters, doubling over to catch his breath. The smoke is suffocating.
“It’s my fault you’re…” Tony gestures to the small bump Steve is hiding under the sweatshirt. He can’t help but think back to the conversation he had with Pepper. There was no proof that the pup Steve was carrying even was his. He doesn’t dare tell Steve the doubts he still has.
He considered them friends. When Steve wasn’t around to keep him company, Dodger was there to listen. Tony trusted his new friend down in his lab, and more often than not, Steve would find both of them down there.
He rids himself of it almost immediately. No, he wouldn’t do that. He couldn’t hurt Steve that way.
Sam groans. “Don’t remind me.”
But then he sighs again. “I’m letting him up. But if he does anything-”
“There’s something about him.”
“Not yet I’m not. It’s too early.”
“How are you feeling?” Natasha’s tone is concerned and a frown has formed over her face.
“Yeah.” Peter nods.
“We better go. I’m sure the Avengers are freaking out about you being with me,” Tony says and he stands.
Peter nods and continues to gather his things for school. He could be a terrible liar and she would easily see through whatever lie he tries to string together. Eventually he’s forced to look up at her, hating how unsure she appears.
“Nah.” Steve waves him off. “Just sore.”
Steve smiles. Happy wasn’t a bad guy. He was one of the good ones.
“What did you do?” Steve asks again, his stomach coiling tightly.
“Yes.” Bruce smiles. “Don’t worry. You’ll feel it soon.”
“Let me know if he says anything about Ginger!” he called over his shoulder and without looking up Steve called back, “She hates when you call her that. And you shouldn’t encourage her. Dancing isn’t a proper profession.”
Dvorak just smiled, raising his rifle once more.
Steve picked his way through the rubble, side stepping an unmoving body face down in the water. The piping must have collapsed he thought as he sloshed his way around the building.
When Tony walked up, tired wrinkled and wet it was to catch the hems of Natacha and Maria’s nightgowns slipping through the boy’s bedroom door. Curios, Tony approached as quietly as he could to peek through the door they’d left slightly ajar.
"The Kindertransport!" Deiter realized with sudden certainty. He pointed franticly toward the train, which was still blowing, moments away from exiting the station. "Herr Captain, the train!"
“She’s alive. But my mother...” Tony’s voice cracked and he winced, carefully not looking back at the captain, feeling too exposed for words but unable to let it go with Ian looking up at him so woefully. “My mother isn’t either.”
There was a metaphorical release of breath when the officer, apparently placated by the word trickling down from command, nodded apologetically to Becker and wished God to be with them in their efforts to protect the Führer.
as their tickets had read, and made the trip to Vienna for the first time.
“An arrangement I assure you Captain that I was unaware of.” Justin was quick to say. “I warned Herr Stark to mind his place and your rules but he has no regard for authority. He’s caused nothing but chaos, unsavory visitors-”
"Oh, it's not that, though it does rattle to convince one otherwise. It's just that I'm meeting my fIancé in Berlin."
Sam, rising, shared a look with Frau Hogan.
“But you had one, and that was precisely the point. Do you want me to weep because your mother brought you down from a mansion on a hill, to celebrate on the wrong day of the year?” Grig questioned, frustration creeping into his tone.
He felt drugged. Slow and sluggish as he looked back down at his son who had opened his eyes to stare back at him, saying nothing, trusting.
“For what…?” Stark asked and Steve let out another little breath, like air pressure from a tire.
“You need this, then we will come up with a plan” Steve grit out, hands tightening where he held Tony despite the words that promised letting go. “But don’t talk about not coming back. You have to. I can’t –I can’t handle it if you don’t.”
Once, his goal had been to stop the storm that was the Third Reich because it was the right thing to do. The only thing to do. It was still the only thing to do, but now he wasn’t sure if he could do it if it meant losing his family or Tony, and it terrified him.
Stefen licked his dry lips and looked over the door, longing clear in his eyes and though Tony knew what he was going to ask before he asked it, it hurt still all the same. “The children. Are they here?” Stefen croaked, blinking blearily. Tony shook his head.
“I am a soldier. I’ll go where I’m ordered.”
The women froze, their bustle and chatter dying, as the captain barged into the room, his eyes immediately homing in on the strangers within their midst.
“Was that clear enough?” Tony murmured into the tense silence with a breathless laugh and Steve let out a huff that might have also been something of a giggle, maybe a cry, he wasn’t confident of what his body was doing anymore. His nerves felt like he’d been hit by a lightning bolt.
"Spider!" Kitty noticed him first, brown eyes widening at the sight of his crisp uniform. "We didn't think you'd come back. You look like you're here to arrest us."
He should thank her. But Steve’s tongue was led in his mouth. You didn’t thank a soldier for throwing themselves on a grenade for you. You just grieved.
"Leave us alone." The boy warned edging his sister backward until their were pressed up against the edge of the bed. "We won't go back."
They left James there and began their patrol. Tony and Péter made a wide circle around the surrounding woods, going out about a mile and circling twice more. They didn’t see so much as another soul. The trail Bucky had driven on the night they’d arrived remained buried in snow, unmarred by anything but a few deer tracks.
Steve’s mouth dropped a little in surprise and he lurched forward a little, blindsided by the news.
“Da!” the little boy cried, barreling into him. Steve braced himself against the door frame, knees shaking as he clutched his son to him. A second later Ian was shoving himself under Steve’s arm and there were other bodies pressing close. He could hardly stomach the emotion rushing over him. Felt dizzy and disoriented as he desperately tried to count heads. One. Three. Five… The relief hit him like a train, his eyes stinging viciously when he counted six.
"Yes." Bruce admitted quietly, "The abbot thought the captain was sending his children abroad, and I thought you'd take the first opportunity available to leave the country."
“Ask your uncle for help.” Stefen called, gesturing to Bakhuizen who had wandered further down the bank. Without missing a note the man managed to make a rude gesture, shouting something back in their strange polish and Stefen’s smile grew.
“Tony! What the hell are you talking about? Of course I wan’t you to come back. I don’t want you to go at all damn it!”
Tony was beginning to despise that look.
Philips cabin sat nestled on the side of the mountain, close to its highest point, in a pocket of thick trees. An unassuming little lodge. Kept up, but quiet and still in the way a house got when it spent long months without a resident.
you! Are you insinuating that the Führer would go back on his word?” Hammer glowered at him, rising from his seat with an expression of outrage and the rushing sound in Tony’s ears tunneled and then snapped until all he could hear was his own harsh breathing.
The sound pouring out of those doors was not that of his lovely wife, singing softly to amuse their children but it was no less stunning for that. He didn’t know why it struck him so dumb to learn that Stark could sing, he was a monk after all, but the rich sound of his voice stopped Steve in his tracks, his ears craning for every last word, his heart pounding wildly within his chest caught between the flush of fury that had carried him there and the strange yearning now holding him still.
"I'll handle it, but right now-"
“It is never harmless to speak against the Reich, Gwen, and you know that. Don’t you think it’s curious that the rebels have not struck this area since your father sent her home?”
The girl nodded eagerly and snatched the coins so fast from Tony’s extended hand Steve felt a whisper of an urge. He thought it was the sort of thing he would have smiled at once, so he made the gesture.
Dinner prep came together well enough - even with James poking his nose in every five minutes to voice his suspicions that a meal not prepared by Willamina’s hands was sure to be dangerous - and just in time to do something about the children’s increasing restlessness. Artur had been to check the tree three times and come back each time more disappointed than the last that the Christkind had not come to leave them their presents. Charlotte suggested they go outside and play in the snow with a wink in Stefen’s direction, but the children didn’t seem to find it suspicious when she begged off joining them, claiming to have a headache. With Charlotte staying behind in the house to work a little Christmas magic, Tony Steve and Bucky took the children outside.
His son stared back at him sullenly, shoulders squared, but beneath that sullen expression there was a wealth of vulnerability he couldn't hide, and a burning question in his eyes. One that only Steve had the answer to. Though it hurt to think his own son might despise him, Steve knew that he had not given Péter many reasons not to. He'd withheld the truth for his own safety, but without it what was Péter to think?
Bucky grit his teeth.
This is the KNIGHT at the INN, requesting that the CASTLE say hello to Wendy.
“I was terrified,” Tony answered easily, simply, as if that was okay. Peter’s shoulders let go some of their tension.
“I doubt everyone equally.” Stefen grunted in reply, resisting for a fraction of a moment before he recognized where they were headed. Tony rolled his eyes. But then, a splash of color on a lamp post caught his eye and he stopped suddenly, Stefen crashing into his back.
“I’m sure we’ll get it sorted. I’ll be back in a moment.” Stefen assured them. “Could you make sure Sara gets a warm drink? She took a chill.”
Soon this would be over. Only, Steve had spent so long focused on the one man he had never had time to stop and think about what came after. Once they’d killed the Führer, one way or another, then what? Would another mad man step into power? There seemed to be no shortage of them these days: Mussolini, Stalin, Himmler, Striker. Cut one head off, would three more spring up in its place?
because he chose you
“No, you’re not.”
Relief flashed through the captain’s eyes at the words, as if he were a sinner at the foot of a priest receiving grace. In a strange way perhaps that wasn’t far off the mark, Tony thought with some amusement. He was a monk after all.
"Of course you're wanted here, but don't tell me you'd give up learning molecular chemistry to stay home and keep James outta trouble?"
As Austria hurtles towards war the Rogers family faces new challenges. While the children struggle to navigate public life Steve and Tony navigate their deepening relationship. Can Tony really trust that his new family won't betray him and can Steve keep his activities a secret and keep General Schmidt from destroying his family at the same time?
Stop!
“Nonna.”
Willamina winked and jerked her head toward the back door, which had been propped open with a bucket to let the heat out and the brisk fall air in. The man who delivered the wood always stacked it neatly outside the tool shed.
He knew it wasn't. They both knew it wasn't. His anger made him lash out, made him want to see that impenetrable mask of calm that had settled over the girls face in the passing weeks, crack and crumble; but the girl was unshaken. If anything there was a glimmer of pity in her eyes when she replied.
Bucky got up carefully, adjusting Natacha gently until she lay down and he could tuck a pillow under her head. Tony observed the tenderness of the movements and thought with a strange pang in his chest that it was a pity Bucky had never settled down to have children of his own. For a moment there with Natacha, he’d almost looked soft – like a man the worst of life hadn’t touched.
He didn't remember as much as he'd like but he remembered her kind eyes and her rough hands.
Steve steeled himself taking a breath to gather himself back together.
“If I’m not a good boy you mean?” Tony shot back, accusing. He was breathing heavily, his breaths sounding ragged to his own ears but he couldn’t let this go. Couldn’t let Niklas Farkas get away with thinking that Tony didn’t know the truth. “It was not my choice to come here! I never wanted to get caught up in your war games Farkas! That was you and that was Hughard! You made Yinsen a promise you couldn’t keep and you sent him to the lion’s den!”
Even Péter, who at first had been excited at the prospect of cycling to town, had dug his heels in when he realized he might be seen by his friends. Well they were just going to have to find some way to live with being less than model citizens under Tony’s tutelage now weren’t they.
He was relaxed even as he was more attentive in his interactions with them.
That was the only explanation he had for why he felt as small as he did faced by the size and splendor of the villa. He came to a complete halt in the fare, caught off guard by the sheer grandness of it all. There were two grand staircases coming down from the second floor landing that spilled out into the opening of the grand entrance like two arms open in embrace.
“Don’t! Stefen damn you.” Tony faltered with a huff as the captain ignored him, picking up the receiver to announce that Captain Rogers was on the line. Tony wanted to throw something at him.
“Father Superior, a moment please?”
The floorboards creaked as Maria shifted her weight up onto her toes. She leaned against the arm of the chair to stare at him with wide pitiful eyes. Rubbing his sore neck with a grimace, Tony sat up. He’d positioned the chair facing the door so that he could watch for danger in the night. But now, pale morning sunlight streamed in between the cracks in the window shutters. Judging by the absence of wind pressing against the walls and the stillness of the air around them he thought the storm must have passed. Bucky's tracks were surely long buried in the snow by now. Which was good, because it meant for the present that they were untraceable. Tony tried not to think any more about the storm or the fact that Bucky could easily have driven off the road in it.
Steve licked dry lips and watched her carefully.
“It was coincidence he got sick when he did! If you questioned the others who were there they’d have to tell you.” Hammer insisted. “Ask the Baroness, she was there. She –”
Striker pinned the insignia upon his father’s chest, pushing the pin until it was stationary. If Ian hadn’t been so close or paying such close attention he would have missed the way his father flinched. It was just a slight ticking in his eyebrows, a tensing in his shoulders, but it was enough to tell Ian that the General had punctured through to his skin. He knew his da well enough to know he was dangerously close to losing his temper.
"Is that what you think this is about?" Stefen growled, the unforgivable edge of hurt underlining each word. Gesturing wildly toward the window he thundered, "You think I give a damn about those people?!"
The sounds he’d make. Because Tony wouldn’t just let Steve have it easy like that. He’d nip and bite and leave blood blossoms all over Steve’s skin, make his mark. And Steve would get a handle on his neck, his shoulder, and give it all back. There’d be bruises for day’s hidden underneath Tony’s shirt collar. Steve would know they were there every time their eyes met.
The sting of Tony’s comment hasn’t gone away. It probably never will. Steve knew Tony never intended to hurt others, especially the people he loved, but that didn’t change the fact that his words were hurtful in the worst way possible. The jab spoke volumes. It spoke the truth.
He was alone in the communal living room with a movie playing. It had only been put on as background noise while he tried to work on his latest sketch, but somehow or another he found himself intrigued by the movie playing on the screen.
“Uh.” Steve takes a moment to think before answering. “To be honest I haven’t had the chance. I’ve been a little occupied.”
“Me,too.”
“You think?”
“Can I come?” Peter asks, jutting out his bottom lip and staring at Steve with his best puppy dog eyes. It works every time.
“Benjamin Harley? It sounds weird to me. Does it sound weird to you?”
“At least we can mark the venue off the list,” Steve says as he makes his way over to sample some of the cookie dough.
“Thanks, Buck. I'm surprised you're here. I thought you’d be going.”
Steve frowns. “You’re not going to stay?”
“Petey,” Steve sighs and puts his son back in bed and pulls the blanket over him. “It’s bedtime. We can play tomorrow okay?”
“Did he forget to cut the crust off of Peter’s sandwiches? I left, Bruce. I left everyone. Steve never would’ve done that. I know I’m not perfect, and I know for a fact that I’m still the villain in this story, but I’m trying okay? I’m trying for that kid.”
“Barnes-”
break. You’re tired and overwhelmed. This would be good for you.”
“I know. I’m just glad it’s you and not some other weirdo in the tower-wait that’s not what I meant! You’re not a weirdo, Happy. I’m just saying that there’s a lot of weirdos in the tower.”
“He seems okay now.”
“It’s okay,” Tony says, though he knows their situation is far from it. He’s at the point where he no longer has the proper response anymore. Whatever he says never heals the ache and the loss of something they’ve never had.
Steve frowns again. “I know, but I didn’t have half of this stuff.”
That seems to get the beta’s attention. He narrows his eyes, unsure of what his friend was telling him was true.
Steve leaves sooner after that. He doesn’t feel any different. Maybe a little more hopeful.
“I have plans for you, Stark.” Pierce grins.
Steve flushes when he becomes the center of attention. He clears his throat and glances down, finding the floor more interesting.
The doctor’s words have his head spinning. Did she say baby? He was giving birth?
Morgan grabs the small carry on suitcase from deep in her closet and begins filling it with clothes and a few keepsakes. The idea of living with her Uncle Sam and Bucky crosses her mind, but she tosses out that idea. They’d side with her papa and have him come pick her up.
“Tony, I’m sorry but I need to sleep. She’ll be up in a couple hours.”
“Kitchen. I’d like to look out the window and see all of this.”
“Yes?” Peter replies a little unsure. “I mean…if you want. I don’t want to force you or anything.”
Steve rises to his feet and Tony catches him when he sways. “Come on, honey. Let’s get you back to bed and I’ll make you more tea.”
Steve gives Peter back his puppy and leans down to kiss his son’s brown curls. Peter tries to break free again, but one stern look from Steve has the pup frowning and lying back with a huff.
Morgan decides she’s no longer hungry and she heads toward the kitchen. Her papa is in the middle of getting breakfast prepared. He shoots her a smile, only for it to falter when she doesn’t give him one in return.
“Mama, he doesn’t...smell,” James says, appearing even more confused.
“He was in there!”
“I made a place for you on the couch so you can rest and take it easy. I have a trash can for you and some crackers.”
“I love you,” Tony says into the darkness. There’s no response. And that hurts more.
“Maybe I can cancel-” Tony begins only for Steve to cut him off.
“Will you relax?” Sam rolls his eyes and plops down in the arm chair. “He’s fine.”
Steve shudders and a small gasp leaves his lips when Tony takes the lobe of his ear into his mouth and nibbles on the soft flesh. Tony’s hands find their way to his broad shoulders, sliding the jacket of his suit off and letting it fall to the floor. Those same hands grip the silky tie and yanks Steve forward until their lips are meeting again.
“I don’t know. Iron Man is awesome. He did a lot of good things.”
“Good morning. I’m doctor Patterson,” She greets with a warm smile and holds out her hand for Steve to shake. Then she’s turning her attention to Tony. “How are you feeling?”
“Did you honestly think I forgot about him? He’s with Nat.”
“I should be going with you,” Happy says. “It’s my job to keep you safe.”
Steve leaves his wounds alone and steps into the shower. The hot water brings relief to his aching body, but it does nothing for the pain that has been tormenting him all day. The next time his stomach tightens, it punches a small groan from Steve. He rests his head against the wall of the shower, breathing steadily through the pain. One hand trails down to the bump, a gasp leaving him when something pushes against his palm.
Tony smiles. “No. He’s better.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hey, you’re not that guy anymore. So you messed up the kitchen sink. It’s not a big deal. You’re hurting right now. Steve was my friend too,but I can’t even imagine the pain you’re going through.”
Steve shakes his head.
“What can I say? I’m the favorite.”
The opportunity to talk to Steve doesn’t present itself. Natasha is coming over with a screaming Morgan in her arms. Tony is ready to take his daughter back and calm her down, but at the sounds of her cries, Steve is already out of his seat and rushing to get her.
Peter frowns at the pang of jealousy he feels toward his friend at this moment. The last time he had been this jealous was when they were six and Ned had a cool comic book. It was dumb but they were just kids then.
“Alpha, please.”
The room is brighter now, a clear indication that it was well into the morning. It’s tempting to go back to sleep, his body demands more rest, mostly due to the extra work it’s being put through to care for the pup. Steve lies back with a huff, one hand coming up to run through his slightly damp hair. He rolls over, bringing one of the large pillows close and breathes in the comforting scent of the alpha.
But Steve was the happiest. He had pictured a little girl but now he saw a little boy with Tony’s eyes and dark, curly hair. He couldn’t wait to meet his son.
“N-no.”
“Uh oh. Someone’s grumpy this morning,” Tony teases and he directs his attention back on the email he’s supposed to be writing.
“What the hell was he thinking? Drinking at a party and having sex!” Tony hisses angrily.
“Yeah,” Tony answers quickly and slips the document back inside the envelope. “It’s fine. Perfectly fine.”
Tony gestures with his head for Peter to come closer and he does immediately, doing his best to keep himself calm and collected. He didn’t want to blow this.
“She looks like you,” Pepper says, “and the little boy.”
Tony finds the strength to lift his head and connect them with the blue ones on the screen. He straightens up and is ready to turn the screen off, but a presence in the room stops him and he turns, expecting to find Pepper in the entrance, but to his surprise he’s met with his best friend.
“You have nothing to be sorry for. I'm the one who...well, you know what I did. And I can stand here and apologize but you’ll never forgive me, and I’ll never forgive myself.”
“Do you think he wants to meet him?” Bucky asks.
“Nope!” Tony says, making sure to pop the P.
But no one cared about what he thought. He was just a kid. It was so easy for everyone to run over him and treat him like he was nothing. His dad had no problem doing it.
Tony wrestles with the chains, biting back his own groan of pain when the metal digs painfully into the sensitive skin on his wrists. He needs to touch his mate, he needs to comfort him and assure him that everything was going to be okay. Steve needed him now more than ever.
Steve glances down at the sticky mess he made on his stomach. He grimaces. “Yeah.”
“He’s safe with you.”
“That is not me this time!” Bruce defends himself.
Peter reaches for his uncle’s hand, holding it tightly and quietly begging him not to leave. He hasn’t heard the full story yet, just a few details. So far he’s learned his uncle had been shot out of the sky, his left arm wounded from the gunshot and wings damaged from the impact of falling into Hulk’s massive arms. The wings could be replaced but his uncle couldn’t.
“What if you can’t?”
“Okay,” Bucky says, his frown deepening. “What does that mean? Are you leaving? Me, Nat? What?”
Maybe one day he’ll hang up the shield for good and give all of his attention to his son. Peter needed him more than the rest of the world.
“Wow.” Steve is still in awe. He watches with bright eyes as the image of his son moves in sync with the movement in his belly. Steve glances between the two, chuckling softly when the baby stretches out an arm.
“You stole countless lives.”
“Shh,” Tony shushes her and gently runs a finger along her cheek. She turns toward his touch, mouth open and closing, trying to suck his finger. Tony understands why she’s so upset. “You’re hungry, huh?”
Tony nods, then he leaves.
It only takes a few knocks before Natasha is opening her door. The smile she greets him with never failed to put one on his face in the past, but even she can’t help him now.
“Don’t screw it up.” Happy points a warning finger. “Steve’s a good guy.”
Steve nods, but he still finds himself reaching for a rattle. The material it’s made out of is soft and colorful, nothing at all like the rattle he had when he was young. He smiles as he brushes his fingers along the plush exterior. It goes in the cart.
They break apart and that’s when Peter notices the bouquet of flowers his dad has.
Tony smirks. “I can think of a few things.”
James moves closer to the group, squeezing through his younger siblings so that he could be close to his daddy.
It was fine, though. It was easier for Steve to work without him.
The rest of the dinner passes with ease. Steve opens up more, talking about his childhood and the struggles he faced. Tony almost envies him. He never struggled with money or food like Steve had. He had more toys than he knew what to do with. It was the affection and love he lacked. Steve at least had that.
Steve winces and shakes his head.
Dodger comes over and whines before licking Steve’s hand, trying to comfort him.
“What does that-”
Peter shakes his head. “No. I did it earlier to my Uncle Bucky.”
Steve scoffs and wipes at his mouth again. “You sound so sure.”
Tony ignores the question. He had one of his own. “You know me?” He asks the omega.
“I can do the living room,” Bruce volunteers. He meets the sad eyes of his nephew. “Or not. Pete, you decide. This was your home.”
The trip was only supposed to last a couple of days. Tony vowed it wouldn’t go over that length. Steve had assured him he was fine and that Tony shouldn’t worry, but it was clear the alpha was having second thoughts. They haven’t been separated before.
Peter sniffs and noses around Steve’s neck, searching for the spot that he associates comfort with. He finds it and sniffs; the sweet scent calms him.
Peter’s brows furrowed in confusion. He expects to see footage of his dad flying around the city as the famous Iron Man, but then he hears a familiar voice.
“I don’t want to hurt you anymore.”
“Not going anywhere, dear.” Tony grunts and rolls over onto his back,
Steve shuts the door behind him, pausing to take a breath and plan his next move. From behind he didn’t look pregnant, but he knew once he turned around, Tony would know.
Nick inhales sharply and rises to his feet. “How long have you known?”
“Why? Because you were drinking?”
“But I-”
“It’s what Pete wanted,” Tony says with a shrug.
“Y-yes.”
“You’re silly,” Peter giggles. “I’m gonna give you a kiss.”
One particular hard thrust has Steve crying out and his back arching off the bed. Steve clings to Tony tightly, his nails digging into the soft flesh of Tony’s back. He chants Tony’s name like a mantra. That spot inside of him continues to get hit with every thrust, pushing him closer and closer to the edge.
“We’re supposed to talk about this.”
“Sorry,” Peter mutters and rushes to sit down.
“Might I suggest creating a grocery list instead?”
“Uncle Steve!” The toddler points excitedly at the statue towering over him. Peter smiles and scoops his cousin up, bringing him closer so that he can reach out and touch the shield. “Oooh. Shield!”
“He’s mine. That mark means nothing.”
“Tony!” Steve screams, gripping onto Tony as hard as he can. His legs give out and with Tony’s help he’s carefully lowered back down to the floor. Steve pants heavily when the contraction finally releases its hold on him. “Tony, the baby’s...I can’t...I can’t…”
But Tony wasn’t that kind of alpha. He wouldn’t hurt him. He promised he wouldn’t. Steve just had to have faith in that.
“Steve? Honey-”
“We can stop. But I gotta know about that pup,” Tony gestures to Steve’s middle.
Tony huffs but allows Steve to introduce him to the alpha his mate has been spending a lot of time with. Sam of course was tall, handsome, and strong. For a moment Tony starts to question his own dominance. But then Steve is intertwining their fingers and shooting him that smile that is meant only for him, and Tony instantly feels better.
“Hey, hey.” Tony is quick to pull Steve close. “You’re not a bad parent. You’re just dealing with a lot right now. It’s going to be okay. I promise.”
“We’ll figure it out. Maybe we could go out with a disguise or something.”
Tony smiles at those words. “Yeah? You guys best friends now?”
“Relax. He was safe. I...I got scared okay? I have no idea what I’m doing and he’s just so...so...happy.”
“I don’t know! It hurts!”
The tv screen goes black.
“It’s nothing, Mr. Rog-I mean Stark-Rogers.”
Peter leaves and this time Tony doesn’t walk him out. It becomes something else he regrets.
“Killed!” Sam cries in frustration. “Jesus, kid, what were you thinking?”
“Don’t. Don’t say stuff like that. He loves you.” Steve comes over to offer reassurance. He places a hand over Tony’s shoulder and rubs the area soothingly. “You’re an amazing father. I know how much you love him.”
“Yeah.” Bucky smiles and glances down at his nephew. His smile falters and he frowns. “He looks like him.”
Steve smiles again and glances down, using the pup as a distraction from the conversation. He continues to play with the dark hair, finding comfort in it. Tony lets the issue go for now.
He means something else entirely but his aunt didn’t need to know that yet.
He doesn’t even understand why he would be going into a rut. Steve wasn’t in heat and was already pregnant. There were no heat pheromones to kick start his rut, and yet Tony’s body was responding like there was. He wonders if his cycle was just off. It wouldn’t be the first time.
“Prepared, Tony,” Steve corrects. “I just want Nat to have everything he’s going to need.”
“I didn’t mean it like that. He just…he’s tired.” Tony frowns at his own words. Here he was using the same excuse Steve loved to use on him. “I mean...come on, he can’t be. Right?”
“Then what are you gonna do? Because the Tony I know would pick himself up and get his shit together. You already wasted 15 years. Do you really want to waste another?”
“Does it matter?”
“It’s okay. I don’t want to be Captain America. I could never be him.”
Steve glances at the tray, his stomach rumbling in response at the sight of french toast, eggs, bacon, and orange juice. Steve huffs out a laugh and peers up at Tony. “This is it, right? There won’t be a surprise party waiting for me downstairs?”
“I’ll take care of this one. I won’t hurt it.”
“It looks good.” Tony steps back to admire their work. “Now we just need a mattress and sheets. Did you have any ideas on nursery themes?”
“Ouch.”
“You let your weapons get into the wrong hands. That’s what happened,” Steve snaps. He doesn’t mean to come off as harsh, but he’s in pain and he’s positive he would’ve come out with less bruises if Tony had tagged along for the mission.
“No! I mean yes but it was an accident and…” Tony sighs. “We were driving and the guy just came out of nowhere, right in front of the car.”
Peter shakes his head. “Just stop. You’re not my parents.”
“The crib is for his room. This can be in ours until he’s comfortable in the crib.”
Tony moves across the floor to get to the younger pups. At least they won’t be too rough with him.
Tony had nothing to worry about.
He places a hand over his belly, wincing when the pain lasts longer than usual. The muscles under his fingertips harden like a rock. His brows draw together in confusion and he glances down at the small bump protruding from his middle. It never did go away. He thought the added weight would have disappeared by now. He ran almost every morning and didn’t indulge too much, but yet the weight remained. It was puzzling.
He kisses them both before returning back to the room to join his mate and daughter. Tony is already in bed with Sarah cuddled up close beside him. He’s softly stroking her hair.
“I know, I know. You’re so strong. I know you can do this.”
“Try me.
“Starving.”
“I can assure you everything is fine. Mr. Stark is waiting for you outside. Just follow the lights.”
“You sure? Steve, we can wait.”
“Please. I do forgive you, Tony, I do. I know what you did wasn’t you. You’re not like other alphas. You’re not like...him.”
Steve follows Nick and the woman he later learns as Maria Hill to a new part of the hellicarrier. Tony remains by his side, holding him close and comforting him with his scent and tender kisses. The PDA probably makes everyone else uncomfortable, but Steve can’t bring himself to care. He had his mate back and they were safe.
Tony smiles softly and holds out a hand for Steve to take. Steve takes the outstretched hand and allows Tony to lead him out of the room.
“Have you discovered anything else?” Sam asks.
his fellow teammates. He waves them off and the meeting carries on.
“Buck-” Sam starts to say but then Peter is cutting him off.
There’s still a part of Steve that’s unsure about Tony’s absence, but then he reminds himself of the security guard keeping watch until Tony’s return. A few days would pass with ease. Steve had enough to occupy his time and mind until his alpha returned.
Bucky throws a leg over Sam’s lap and straddles him, cupping his face with his hands and connecting their lips again. Sam moans softly, his hands trailing down Bucky’s back and settling on his hips.
“You okay?” Tony asks.
He studies the letter, battling with himself if he should even open it. He wonders why Steve hadn’t called and instead sent his son as a messenger. That wasn’t like him. Maybe Steve had changed too.
“What? Call you out? Someone had to. I’m sure Pepper’s already tried,” Rhodey says.
He’s perfect. At just an hour old, the little boy already had Steve wrapped around his finger.
“Asshole,” Tony mutters to himself. He didn’t know Steve very well or any of his backstory, but no one deserved to be abused. “Hey,” he says, getting the omega’s attention. “You’re safe now.”
Maybe this was his chance to be different, to have something he’s thought about for the longest time. He could finally have a family.
He lost Steve.
“I figured. Dammit. Okay who’s here to see me?”
“You can go, kiddo,” Tony says and Peter snaps his head up to meet his eyes again. “It’s okay.”
Steve had to do it. He had to have the alpha mate with him, otherwise, they both would be punished. Steve didn’t want to get punished again and he didn’t want the alpha to suffer because of him either.
“Hmm.” Bruce’s brows knit together. “Have you been seen by a doctor before?”
“What?”
Steve is ready to protest, but he doesn’t get the chance. Another contraction is building and his body bears down on its own. The pressure between his legs increases, along with the burning. Steve whines through it, reaching down again to feel around the baby’s head. Tony’s gaze follows, his stomach dropping at the sight of the dark hair slowly inching forward.
Steve frowns in confusion. He’s heard those words before. Natasha has said them to him the night he was rescued. It didn’t make sense then and it didn’t now. Why did SHIELD want him?
“Of course,” Natasha replies with a smile. “You made it.”
“And the pup...they think this is the one?” Tony asks. He can recall the others Steve had told him about. He wonders why the previous pups weren’t chosen. Surely the other alphas chosen to sire those pups fit the bill. Tony didn’t want to press for answers, not when it was a delicate subject for the omega.
Peter sniffs and quickly wipes away the tears that roll down his face. “I just wish you were here. I keep thinking about you and dad and...us being a family. Maybe he would be different. I don’t think he likes me very much.”
“The Avengers can take care of that. They don’t need me either.”
“You guys are assholes,” Clint mutters.
A small smile forms over Steve’s face. Tony’s unsure if the response he gets is enough proof that the omega believed him. All he wanted was for Steve to feel safe and secure around him. Even if they still considered each other strangers.
Their baby was growing. It wasn’t just the pictures littering the refrigerator that was proof of that, Tony’s belly had grown since the first few appointments. The bump that had formed was small and barely noticeable under Tony’s clothes, but they knew it was there. Steve couldn’t get enough of it. His hands were attracted to the bump, his fingers itching to get a feel of it whenever Tony let him.
“He just likes you,” Steve tries to calm his boyfriend, that amused grin still on his face for Tony to see.
“I’ll handle it,” Tony says and he rises to his feet. He leans down to peck Steve on the head, then he makes his way up the stairs and toward his son’s bedroom.
Tony can’t bring himself to think about Steve. Just hearing his name is too painful. He hates the way he remembers him. Their last face to face encounter had been worse than the first time Tony walked away from him. He blew Steve off, and never gave him a chance to speak.
Nick waves a dismissive hand. “You’re free to go. Congrats on that baby.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Mr. Hogan is in the kitchen with takeout.” Comes Jarvis’ response.
“What?”
“Yeah,” Steve nods again, “I took three tests just to make sure.”
“Ice cream?” Peter asks, only to grow disappointed when Steve shakes his head.
“I’m confused as to what’s going on here. Tell me what?”
Tony’s phone rings after the signing and he immediately answers. He doesn’t miss the way Natalie watches him.
Steve was nowhere in sight, but any questions regarding his absence is quickly answered when Tony gets a whiff of freshly brewed coffee. He makes his way toward the kitchen, mentally preparing himself for what scene he’s going to walk into today. To his surprise and amazement, Steve is lounging on the sofa, quietly reading the paper.
Tony is lying back against the pillows, his legs spread wide and fingers twisting the sheets beneath him. He’s breathing hard and his eyes are squeezed shut.
is printed along the front.
“Yeah. It’s beautiful.”
“Go away! I’ll be fine!” He calls out. Steve is persistent and knocks again. Tony finds himself moving toward the door. He stops in front of it.
A wince crosses Tony’s face, though his is more because of sympathy for his husband. The epidural was wearing off and Tony was beginning to feel a bit of the soreness from the birth, but it was Steve who was feeling everything.
“Oh...yeah. Get some sleep, honey.” Tony keeps his arms wrapped around Steve, letting his hands fall to his middle. The muscles aren’t as firm as they used to be; the baby weight hasn’t been shed yet, not that Tony cares. Steve was perfect no matter what form he was in.
“That’s what I’m afraid of.”
Natasha grins, her expression reminding Steve of the smiley face on the test. At least hers was more comforting and he didn’t have the urge to throw her in the trash and cover her with tissues.
“Hi, sweetheart,” he coos, and adjusts the makeshift blanket around her. She continues to announce her displeasure with her new home. It’s a beautiful sound. “Shh. It’s okay. You’re all right.”
Tony appears the most annoyed. Steve blames his mood swings. They’re barely on their third store when Tony allows his sour mood to take full control of the shopping trip.
“Because I’m your best friend.”
“Mommy, can I have blueberries instead?” Sarah asks sweetly.
Alpine meows in agreement.
“There’s always a choice. Why-how did it happen? I can’t remember a fucking thing.”
The air around him shifts, filling with an abundance of sweetness and Steve realizes the session is done and the room is clearing out. Steve steps out of the way, avoiding the eyes of a few omegas that notice him on their way out.
The baby shower ends up differently than Steve expected. There were only five of them total, and yet Tony had prepared as if a hundred guests had been invited. Maybe a hundred was too big of a number, but Tony was probably used to having a guest list that long.
“I was going to wish you a happy birthday but…yeah, I’m sorry too. I’m sorry about everything, kiddo. I screwed up big time,” Tony says.
“Have you told him yet?” Ned asks for what seems like the millionth time. Ever since Peter came clean to Ned, it was like all he wanted to do was ask questions. Peter understands that his friend was curious and trying to piece everything together so that he can find ways to be helpful. The only thing Peter needed from his friend was a tight lip and to stop asking so many questions.
Halloween had finally arrived.
Steve nods and turns to Sam. “Can you take over?”
“I know. I’m just giving you a hard time. I’m happy for you, man.”
“Do you still think she’ll have my eyes?” Tony asks, coming out of the kitchen to join Steve in the living room. He lowers himself down on the couch near Steve, and gently adjusts Morgan in his arms, smiling brightly when she locks eyes with him again. “Honey?” Tony glances up in Steve’s direction when he doesn’t receive a response.
“Dad, look!” Peter waves Tony over excitedly.
“Sweetie, it’s okay.” Natasha pulls him into a hug. He doesn’t fight her touch and allows her to hold him close. “I miss him too. A lot.”
“No. Baby’s fine.”
Those three words never fail to make Tony’s heart flutter. He’s heard the words before from his mother, from his best friend, and occasionally from a few past partners. It was hard for him to repeat those words, except to his mother and best friend of course, but  whenever Steve said them, Tony didn’t hesitate to say them back.
Tony’s not even fazed by the threat. He’s been damaged enough.
“He’s still young and he still needs his dad. It’s nice to see you getting excited over your son. It’s sweet. Don’t screw it up.”
“I thought I wasn’t going to school,” Peter groans.
“Are you okay?” Steve asks, his tone laced with concern.
“Yeah. It’s okay. I was wondering what stupid thing I did this time.”
“Tony, what is going on?” Pepper demands.
Steve chuckles and sits up. “I’ll clean us up. Hold tight.”
“Aren’t you always?”
Peter slants back in his seat. “I’m just...curious.”
“No. Tony, that wasn’t you. You’re not like other alphas. I know that, and you should too.”
“I just want things to be normal. I know they never will be because he’s gone but he wanted us to have a relationship and I owe that to him.”
“False contractions?” Tony repeats. “Oh, so it’s not serious then?”
“Me?”
Steve doesn’t respond, and instead he’s spinning around and scooping his son into his arms. He holds Peter close. “I-I love you so much.”
Tony doesn’t stick around much after that. Bruce had offered him to stay and work with him, but for the first time in his life, Tony was saying no to work. His mind was occupied with the worst thoughts possible, and even working alongside Bruce couldn’t rid him of the horrible things his brain conjured up.
Steve attempts to untangle himself from his alpha’s arm to attend to their son, but Tony beats him to it.
Steve smirks. “What are you going to do to me?”
There’s a pause and the sound to the electric toothbrush buzzes from the bathroom. Tony goes back to work, more interested in the upgrades for his suits than participating in the current conversation. Anything related to the baby ruined Tony’s mood.
“No. Though sometimes it feels like I’m already taking care of one.” Pepper laughs.
“Don’t stop,” Tony pants and he brings Steve’s head back to his cock. “Baby, I’m close.”
“Fuck!”
Steve is struggling to get their daughter calm. Any effort he makes is failing. She’s screaming at the top of her lungs, the sound heartbreaking to hear. Steve has his own tears running down his face, but it’s not the tears that has Tony rush toward him. The tight grip Steve has on her doesn’t look right.
“Bed,” Steve mumbles against Tony’s lips and grips the front of Tony’s shirt, pulling him backwards.
I swear I was gonna have them kiss but then this happened and well...yeah, I'm not surprised. Maybe the next chapter there can be a stony kiss? Yes? Yes!
“You could,” Natasha assures. She glances down at Peter when he finally burps for her. More than just air escapes and Steve rushes to grab another cloth, grimacing as he cleans up the spit up milk.
“It’s going to be okay.” Natasha applies more pressure, hating the cries of pain Steve makes. “You’re getting out of this.”
Steve is pushed deeper into the room, his balance lost for a moment before he’s manhandled and led toward the bench. That’s when he fights.
“I know.”
“Probably more than that,” Natasha says, “he would pick it sometimes during movie night.”
He’s greeted with silence.
Steve huffs out a laugh. “If Bucky were here-”
“It’s okay,” Tony assures. He takes the spot beside Steve. “I’m not too sure what to do either.”
“Hmm…” Tony hums. His brows scrunch together in confusion, reminding Steve of the times when he’s in is lab and stumped over an equation. “Maybe JARVIS can-”
“And I did! I did and it was stupid and with the worst person on this whole planet. Probably the whole universe.”
“Surprisingly not so much. I guess I’ve...learned to accept those bad days. They’re a part of me so…”
“What kind of position?”
Tony smiles. “Sounds fun.”
“Steve, I know it hurts, but you have to keep going,” Bruce says softly.
“Stop making everything about you,” Natasha finally grants Tony an answer. He rolls his eyes and scoffs, expecting her to put him down again. “Stop,” her tone is harsher and this time he glances at her. “You spent 15 years worrying about yourself and doing God knows what. We needed you. Steve needed you. But that was then and this is now. The Avengers are fine, but your son isn’t. Stop making this situation about you and focus on him. He needs you.”
With a yawn, Tony makes his way toward the kitchen to set up a pot of coffee. He still remembers where Steve keeps everything and in no time he has the pot going and two mugs out on the counter. He doesn’t bother with breakfast, knowing he’ll end up burning the place down if he were to try. They’ll just have to grab a bite to eat while they’re out.
“That’s it,” Tony says and Steve glances at him. “We tried to give you a chance and you’re still being hush hush about this. Butt in the living room. Now.”
Tony chuckles. “Then what is it? I have some cool news too. Though mine probably tops yours.”
“I’m saying if you want to see him then that’s your decision. Steve never wanted Tony kept from you. I’m sorry if I’ve been a little overbearing-”
“You’re in a good mood this morning,” Happy says when he notices the cheerful expression on Peter’s face.
Steve winces and quickly wraps Peter in a towel to keep him warm. “I’m sorry, Tony. I know your space is-”
“Yes,” Steve snaps and he rises to his feet, grumbling in frustration when the wet spots continue to grow. “Jesus. I just changed.”
Tony sighs. “Yeah, okay. I’ll talk to him.”
They ride in silence for a couple of minutes. Peter finds the courage to look up at his dad, hoping he’d say something first. He never does.
Out of all the past encounters he’s had with Steve, that was the night he wishes he could go back to. Different scenarios play in his head, each one always having a happy ending. Tony would give anything to have that moment back again.
“Shit.”
Steve can’t help but scoff. “You’re going to get up when he’s hungry or needs to be changed?”
But he was wrong. His body betrayed him just like it had used to do in the past. The two miscarriages and stillbirth were all because of him. He tried to do everything right and care for the children he had been blessed with, only to fail and hurt them in the end. It was all his fault.
“That’s a bet you’d lose. But I’m prepared to give you what you really want right now, no struggle.”
"This is what Stark has always wanted you to do Stevie. You can’t say he hid it from ya,” Bucky said from where he leaned up against the wall watching Steve.
“Does he at least have it on?”
“Am I supposed to be aware of that, sir?”
I finally got around to updating this one! I guess I’ve been focusing on another story a little too much, but I swear this one and a few others are going to get some attention! Hope everyone is having a wonderful holiday if you celebrate it or just a wonderful weekend! I’m celebrating my Captain’s birthday 😉 Stay safe!
“Good evening, Mr-I’m sorry, but I’m afraid I don’t know your last name.”
Dodger isn’t as clingy today. Steve doesn’t complain, though; he’s happy to have some space to himself. The couch is comfortable now that he doesn’t have to worry about sharing it with a certain someone, but after awhile he begins to miss his dog’s warmth and comfort.
Tony nods, forcing a smile. It leaves his face the minute Steve is gone. With a heavy sigh, Tony directs his attention back to his daughter, their eyes meeting.
Steve smiles as he accepts the blue gift bag. He had already opened a few from Clint’s family. They had gifted him with a few baby outfits, a bottle set, crib sheets, and a couple of boxes of diapers. Bruce’s gift was a baby swing, Sam’s was more clothes and diapers, Bucky was simple and gave pacifiers and a shirt that said: Cool Like My Uncle.
“I know. I guess I didn’t know how. And he was dealing with a lot. I didn’t want to add to it you know. Then there was you. I didn’t want him to feel guilty because he had you and I...didn’t have one of my own. He’d do that...I know him.”
Peter begins to wake, stirring and whimpering around his pacifier until it’s falling from his lips. His cries escalate until they’re loud wails.
“Uh...I-I-”
“I’ll do it,” Bucky suggests with a smirk, making sure to flex his metal arm.
“So remember that little project we were working on?”
“Aww, Happy. So you really do care about me?”
“Let’s do it,” Tony repeats. “Let’s get married.”
“Enough,” Natasha scolds with a roll of her eyes. “Let us in.”
The rest of the evening passes by with ease. For the first time in a long time, the Steve Tony knew was making an appearance. Steve smiled more; he laughed. He was starting to feel like himself again. Tony was sure of it.
“No one said you did.” Sam smiles and he comes over to stand beside Steve. He lays a hand over his shoulder and pats the area softly. “I’m happy for you, Cap.”
Thunder booms again, and then the rain starts. Peter doesn’t care if he’s getting drenched in the cold rain.
“Yeah. Why wouldn’t we be?”
Yay I finally got around to updating this one. I’m off today so probably that’s why. I started the next chapter at work so maybe I’ll have that up this weekend 🤞
Their youngest pup was missing. Tony figures he must be napping. It was Peter’s favorite activity after all.
“I know,” Peter tells him.
“It’s good, huh?” Tony tells his daughter, chuckling when she reaches out for the bottle. “You know what else is good? Coffee. I guess I should’ve got some before this, but you come first. You’ll always come first.”
The kiss is unexpected, but Steve welcomes it. He welcomes Tony’s touch, not realizing how much he needed it until now.
“Let me guess...Thor ate the last pop tart?”
Harley lies back down and it’s not long before he’s drifting off to sleep. James smiles when it’s his turn, his eyes lighting up when Steve kisses him and nuzzles their noses.
Peter takes a deep breath and shuts his eyes as he thinks about the worst day of his life. He finds the courage to open his eyes, and when he does, he gasps at what he sees.
“But it’s not that simple.”
It was pathetic, he knew this and his team must know it too. He doesn’t miss the sympathetic looks sent his way when his phone rings and he rushes to answer it, only to discover it’s Hill, Fury or his doctor. No one else calls.
Pierce inhales sharply and issues another kick to Tony’s side, this time a little harder, and Tony’s sure blue and purple bruises are beginning to decorate his skin. He grits his teeth, not wanting to give Pierce any satisfaction.
He could still turn and run from the room, but he doesn’t do that. Peter needs him.
“She’s here.” Happy smiles and gently lays the newborn over her father’s chest. She takes her first breath, and the car fills with the sound of her cries. Happy quickly shrugs off his suit jacket to place it over her tiny form.
“It is stupid. But I love you and I love getting to spoil you-”
Peter chuckles again.
“I know,” Sam says, his voice thick and eyes shiny.
“Papa,” Peter groans.
“Too much?” Tony peers down at him and with one hand, reaches down to run his fingers through Steve’s messy hair.
“He turned it down,” Sam explains, shrugging when Bucky frowns at him.
“I’m sorry,” Tony apologizes again, “I don’t know what came over me. I didn’t mean to hurt you.”
Steve smiles. “I love you more.”
Shit.
“Tony, you can’t give up on us. The team needs you,” Steve says.
He stops right under where Peter is hiding, speaking into his comm. Peter can’t make out the other half of the conversation, but he knows it's his other uncle. He can't help grimace from the sappy exchange he's forced to hear. Sometimes he preferred it when they bickered instead.
“Well, yeah. Pete’s gonna need siblings. I grew up an only child and it-”
“We’ll figure it out,” Tony says. Morgan continues to stare up at him, finding comfort in the familiar voice. “Listen,” Tony sighs. “I don’t know how long papa is going to be away but...it’s just going to be you and me. I’m not him obviously. I know you’re annoyed with me because I’m probably doing everything wrong, but I’ll do my best. And then soon papa will be back and we’ll be happy again. Sounds good, right?”
“We’ll talk about this later,” Sam decides, knowing if he didn’t get his husband and nephew calm that one would lose their cool and the other would disappear from their lives. He couldn’t have that. Not after everything they’ve been through.
“I do...but then Auntie Nat is upset and I don’t want to leave her but then you guys are also upset and I’d feel terrible about leaving you and-”
“That would’ve been the smartest choice, sir. He is your bodyguard.”
They don’t stop him when he leaves, but he knows eventually one of them will come seek him out.
“You secretly love it.”
“No one needs me. I’m sorry, Tony. I love you. I’m sorry.”
He allows his eyes to fall shut and listens to the soft breathing of his husband. He keeps his hand on Tony’s belly, dreaming of a little version of him.
“Do you blame me?”
Steve stares the alpha down, refusing to give in when he had made it this far. But then a tiny whimper fills his ears and his eyes dart down to the bundle held securely in Tony’s arms. Steve whines in response and the blade slips from his fingers.
Tony peers up at Steve, eyes transfixed on the pleasured look etched on Steve’s face. He wants to make this feel good for him, to make up for almost forgetting about the big holiday.

A new scent fills his nose and Steve peers up, growling at the stench. Two figures emerge. Another alpha and a beta.
“Tony, I’m trying. Believe me I am. But you don’t know him like I do. You don’t know how...extreme he can be.”
“I can’t hurt you again.”
The beta immediately backs away, only to be shoved forward by Rumlow.
Tony hasn’t screamed yet. If anything he appears the most calm. He curses every now and then when a contraction starts, but it’s nothing dramatic. It’s Steve that panics. The roles were switched for once.
“What does he want anyway? You donated enough to his cause. Did you agree to work with him?”
Steve grunts from the initial stretch and he fists the sheets beneath him, his eyes shutting tightly and jaw tensing from the burn.
Steve chuckles. “Yeah, I guess we did.”
“Don’t.” The warning is said in his ear. Steve’s body breaks out in goosebumps from the feeling of the alpha’s warm breath against his ear. “I’m just curious. I wanna know what makes you so special. Why does Alpha get you all to himself?”
The other group members nod in agreement. Others smile reassuringly at their newest member.
Eventually Peter is latching on and nursing, the sound of his greedy sucking filling the room. Steve watches his son eat for a moment before he’s letting his head tip back. His eyes flutter and he quickly catches himself. He can’t fall asleep now. But his body demands that he do. Steve’s eyes flutter again until they’re falling shut.
He groans against Steve’s neck. “You’re getting close. I can feel you.”
“Hey,” he calls out to get the omega’s attention. Their eyes meet. “What’s your name?”
