He thought about The Avengers, the politics and the philosophy and the practicalities of them, a hundred different ways they might evolve and thousand new ideas he could explore on their behalf.
The fear of what he truly was, and what was going to happen to him - the anxious worries that he’d been forcing to the back of his mind since he first took the serum.
“Okay, just, stay here,” Tony warned Steve, gently. “I need to check on him-” he saw Steve’s eyes flash with concern, his jaw tensing at the very idea of letting Tony get near to him again, “-I know, I know, but I promise I’ll be okay. You have to listen to me now, okay?”
All of the widows in the house were made out of a specially designed material that filtered out the sunlight – and none of them opened. The
he was. In an instant, Tony found himself pulled up off of his feet and hard against Steve’s chest, the burn of Kevlar dragging over his legs. A rush of giddiness flooded through Tony’s head as he struggled to process that surge of excitement, his vision fading at the edges as he threw his arms around Steve’s neck, clawing frantically at his skin.
to watch you let go, Steve,” he whispered, as he very gradually worked his way down Steve’s shirt, exploring his body as he undressed him, tracing his fingers over the contours of his muscles, working his palms against his skin. “I want to watch you
the sound of Steve hissing in pain that Tony reacted to – it was too powerful an instinct for him to mistake, too clear for him to misremember. The same bodily panic he’d felt when Steve nearly burned himself, but so much stronger. A sudden, plunging feeling at his gut, a searing awakening of every nerve in his body, an impulse to go to him-
“So, are you going to tell me about it then?” Rhodey demanded, like he could read Tony’s mind. Tony screwed his face up and shook his head.
“My daughter, in an unofficial sort of way – tell you the truth, I think she’s glad to have us out of the way for a while. Give her a chance to show what she can do – she’s only twenty.”
pretty quickly supported his decision to become Iron Man, however crazy she thought it was - she’d even helped him risk his life to save the day, on occasion. She had, in fact, never put any limitations or judgements on the way Tony lived his life until the point he asked her to share it with him… Until the point that his life choices directly impacted hers. Which was, of course, fair enough - but it was also what pushed them apart in the end. The fact that Tony simply couldn’t allow someone to act as his better judgement, no matter now reasonable their input, no matter their right to try… No matter how much he wanted to. He realised now that he could have made any number of concessions for Pepper, but he couldn’t let her keep trying to
– through the darkness… the unmistakable sound and rhythm of sex, all around them… none of it as exciting as the sweep of Tony’s thumb over the back of his hand…
He walked over to the nearest work bench and lifted the case onto it. He flicked both of the clasps open with a sharp, unified crack. He felt a rush of heat run up his spine as he finally opened it-
There was a bottle of champagne waiting in Tony’s hotel room, along with two branded glasses and a corporate-looking greeting card.
“Let me know if there’s anything else,” Tony added, in almost the same cool, professional tone that had hurt Steve so much, earlier in the evening. “I won’t… yell at you next time. I promise.”
The first thing he recognised was the sound of Steve panting… the tone of pure, blessed relief in every breath. Tony lifted his head, waiting for a wave of warm, thick dizziness to roll behind his eyes before he let his forehead rest against Steve’s.
It was like, all of a sudden, someone had a gun to his head. To Tony’s head. It was pretty hard to concentrate on anything else.
If Steve could have known at the time that there was nothing more to be done, if he could have accepted this and just-
had asked for it – and maybe that meant it wasn’t that weird, or at least that they could talk about it, or…
“I never actually hated Bucky” Tony sighed, still somewhat embarrassed by this whole side of things “I don’t even know Bucky – I blamed him for all the hurt I felt in that moment, and… I probably would’ve known, even then, that it wasn’t his fault. If I’d let myself know it. If I hadn’t just wanted to lash out at someone… I do know it isn’t his fault, Steve. Actually… I know I should feel sorry for him. And… Look, I can’t promise it’ll be the easiest thing in the world, being around him, at first…”
“Oh, what do you want from me?” He demanded with faux exasperation. “I’m up to my nose in balls here-”
my brain that comes up with anything, in that world,” Tony carried on. “And I know nothing I could say about it would be sensible. But… I don’t know. I don’t know
And it was the tone that stopped Steve, more than anything. He was sort of operating on that instinctive, animalistic level now, responding to basic human cues.

,” Tony barked, loud enough that they probably heard it in the hall. Writhing up as much as Steve’s grip would let him, his breaths coming harsh and shallow as Steve’s movements became rougher, and faster..
The automatic lights had turned themselves off again… Steve didn’t know how long it’d been since he lost patience with waving his arms to wake them up each time. And, anyway, lying here in the shadows seemed more fitting, somehow.
it doesn’t turn out that the second stage of the vampire life cycle is a giant slug, or something. But, you know, when people promise in sickness and in health, and for richer and poorer and for better or worse - they’re all
Instead he worked his knuckles against his rim in short, sharp thrusts, remembering that deep, brutal rhythm Steve fell into…
that feeling… was Tony being needlessly cruel to both of them, saying no? Or was he being unthinkably selfish, irresponsible, letting Steve get further into this, without knowing what he was getting into…
And Tony had forgotten whatever sense that made, and remembered that such things were a very big deal, usually…
“It’s okay baby,” Steve whispered, taking his hand away. Tony cried out, bucking against nothing, but Steve just carried on soothing, “It’s okay, it’s okay baby.”
Steve knew Tony knew. He could feel it in the way Tony curled his fingers around his arms, commanding and careful. He could hear it in the smile that Tony breathed against his neck,
Tony slid his palms, slow and firm, over Steve’s neck and back, a perfect contrast to Steve’s frenetic, uncoordinated clawing. And Steve liked that he couldn’t move Tony, that he couldn’t hurry him or agitate him – that there was nothing to stop Steve from moving however he wanted, because he couldn’t possibly affect anything, whatever he did. Already, there was a dizzying sort of freedom to feeling so overpowered.
Steve’s entire body tensed with a static electric excitement, strong enough to push him onto his feet.
“Hm… It’s listed in the medical notes as wiring,” Tony mused, like he was talking to himself. “Not sure that’s entirely accurate, as a categorisation…” And he pondered for half a minute longer, and then added, “Okay, this is potentially a little bit more complicated than I thought – but it’s fine, the principle is the same. I’m just going to have to be a bit more careful…. And do a few things first…” And he walked back over to his tray of tools, not even glancing up.
How to explain this strange, almost pleasant reluctance to finally do the thing he’d waited so long for, and wanted so much… Just because, once he had, this incredible, magical, life-changing moment would be over.
And it was so against Tony’s entire life’s teaching to fall in love like that. To show and feel and risk any of the things you had to, to fall in love.
be confused, and anxious and unnerved by, at least. It felt like something that he should think very seriously about.
things I’d do to an enemy henchman that I’d feel bad doing to someone who genuinely needed my help. I mean, I kinda feel like if
But Steve let go of another heavy sigh, his eyes falling to the floor before he could bring himself to begin,
tell Tony he loved him, whether that was fair or unfair… whether it made it more or less likely that Tony would say yes.
“Sorry, nothing…” And then, when he recognised that Tony wasn’t going to let him get away with that, “I just mean…they
to know who he was? Did he even know what that question meant to him - was that what he was hoping to get out of this?
And Tony wasn’t sure what he thought about that. But it seemed to have a calming effect on his body, at least. His shoulders dropped; the threatened trembling edged away. He did
Steve glanced down, to the tiny, alien object sitting numb in the palm of his hand. And he looked at it.
“Well, that. But…” and Tony struggled for a moment, and then gave up “I dunno, a lot of this just feels unnatural to me – and that’s why I’m not going to ask about it, because that makes it sound like I didn’t beg a friend to refer me here, or something.”
“Came up when I was tracking those Russian volumes,” she explained, her tone still just a little bit too animated. “So, no, not a huge additional effort – overpriced.”
The first one Tony goes to is Steve, not, he tells himself, because of any lingering feelings he might have, or might have had, or might have had considered having at some point, or might be getting back in the near future, but because most of the others listen to him. If he can get Steve on his side, the only ones left to convince will be T’Challa and Strange.
In the end, Natasha takes care of all of the party planning because for a person this blunt and scary to anyone who really knows her she sure can turn up the charm when needs be.
“Don’t be rude, Sam,” Natasha says and Peter lights up before she adds: “Go fight someone your own size.”
All of the Avengers stare at him for the longest of time before they all collectively get up and start leaving. Tony’s protests are ignored. Strange is disconnected from the conference call as he tells Stark to never call him ever again. T’Challa, who is a scholar and a gentleman, waits until Bucky is done cursing the Stark lineage in Russian, Romanian, German, and about twenty other languages to follow suit.
“You tasteless tart toad,” he spits with contempt at Pietro. “You don’t put cyan next to a blood orange when you are trying to get a harmonious ensemble. They
“Yes,” Tony sighs. “I also need to ask you to please not embarrass me in front of my friends. Remember you’re an Avenger. You’re a professional.”
She laughs. “As if I’d ever trust you to drive me anywhere the morning after a party. Hilarious, Mr. Stark,” and hangs up on him. He smiles at his phone screen. Yeah, he was being an idiot before. In all the ways that matter, she’ll always be the love of his life.
The subject had not been addressed again. From what Steve understood, he was sort of the Asgardian equivalent of a high schooler who ran around town using the jewelry he stole from his mother to buy a fake ID to get into the local gay bar. Except their version involved a lot more stabbing.)
She flirts with a caterer until she agrees to deliver some quickly made dishes they can warm up and any excess food she has from other parties she served for. She convinces Wanda and Pietro to make some of the recipes their grandma used to prepare for Hanukkah after they claim their reluctance as any twenty-something-year old is wont to do, then Vision actually joins in on the fun. It also turns out decorating is way easier when two members of your team have telekinesis, and Vision and Wanda look sickeningly sweet hanging mistletoe everywhere they can.
FRIDAY pauses before she says, hiding her laughter, “Sure, boss,” and it is so unfair that all of his AI end up developing the capacity to heckle him.
He manages to make it last at least one hour before somebody (Thor) thanks Peter for convincing him to throw a Christmas party and the kid whips around to look at him with the widest eyes he has ever seen. Out of the corner of his own eye, he catches Dum-E wearing a  Christmas hat and running around after Natasha with a festive sweater while she ducks all of his attempt to dress her in it. Vision and Wanda are in front of the window watching Vision’s first snow, even if it is just an artificial show Tony and Bruce concocted yesterday night after too much eggnog. Bruce is talking with Harvey with great hand gestures while Thor pets his hair. Clint is doing a handstand in front of Scott Lang and Hope van Dyne to prove who is the cooler dad. Okoye is in a corner judging all of these white people while Shuri socializes with other geniuses her age and T’Challa pretends not to be happy about that. Deadpool is weighing the benefits of crocs versus flip-flops with Peter Quill, who seems fascinated by this new technology. Rocket, Barnes, Valkyrie and Nebula are talking about weapons around the Christmas tree under which suspiciously gun-shaped presents are sitting.
Peter comes out of the room pouting in black jeans and a white shirt, looking both very young and very old. Tony has to physically drag him out of the flat and into the Ferrari, which is the first time he has ever had to drag someone into a Ferrari, but anyway, Peter isn’t a huge car guy, so her beauty is lost on him.
have forgotten,” Tony says. Barnes narrows his eyes at him. “Anyway, if I could have everyone’s attention? Romanoff, please tell Clint I literally made these hearing aids and he is being an ungrateful brat.”
She smiles at him with a naked warmth Tony isn’t used to seeing on Natasha’s face, but then Valkyrie, who has spent most of the night gawking at these weirdly colored alien sisters Quill dropped off earlier, slides next to her and asks her if she might have this dance. If these two become a thing, they will be the most lethal couple in the history of the world - he is a little afraid and a little turned on, to be honest.
“Your lack of faith wounds me,” Tony says. “Happy to see you stunning as always, though. Red looks good on you.”
“Mister Stark!” he says, already bouncing on his feet. “What are you doing here? I thought you had that, uh, party thing?”
At her side, feet kicked up on her thighs, Clint is reading a trashy gossip magazine and obviously doesn’t have his hearing aids on. In splashy red letters, the journalist, who probably went to Harvard for this, speculates about
She skims her hand over the velvety fabric. “A mysterious suitor sent it to me a few days ago. A little stalkerish. I think I’m going to start locking my windows.”
Tony tries not to gulp too obviously while staring at Steve, something light and bubbly and ugh, fluttery, stirring in his chest. Finally he settles on saying: “Yeah, this could.”
“Of course you don’t,” Steve sighs, ducking his head to hide a half-smile so familiar it makes Tony’s heart ache. “Look, Tony, we have never ever celebrated Christmas in the compound. I mean, in the tower either. Since 2012.”
“Right. Natasha was still bleeding from her last mission and Clint was staying to make sure she didn’t start working out and reopening her wounds. We ordered a literal mountain of Chinese takeout we ate in front of the TV - not a Christmas movie, because you forbade those and said Christmas was a
In the other armchair, Bruce and Thor are ostensibly Not Cuddling, because they are, of course, Not Dating, Valkyrie, sitting by their side with a suspicious-smelling Thermos, stares in adoration at Natasha, who is splayed on the couch sharpening a knife in a vaguely threatening way for no real reason.
Steve looks up at him lazily from where he is sitting on an armrest trying to make himself as small as possible for Sam to sit, which is ridiculous when he is made of about six feet of abs and triceps and deltoids and other weird muscles.
anymore, in so far as anyone can not love Pepper. And she is still his favorite person on Earth with Rhodey, the ones he spends most of his time with. It is more like he misses when she was the love of his life, maybe.
Steve is staring at him so intensely Tony feels like his heart could float out of his ribcage at any moment. “Alright. I’ll help. And I’ll tell the team to help you organize it too. I’m sure Natasha would be great at party planning.”
“You know what,” Clint says, a weird glint in his eye. “It’s not so bad that you made us throw this party in the end, Stark. Wasn’t a half bad idea.”
Tony covers his mouth with his left hand. “Shhh. Don’t listen to Captain Boring over here. He played in gym classes instruction videos. Listen to me, the
Thor stops staring at Bruce with moony eyes and asks, “Is it Thanos? Did the contingency plan we put in place to welcome him fail us?”
At the most random of times, he misses her so much he is afraid he will break down here and there. He knows she is still here for him, whatever they are. He doesn’t even love her like
Peter catches sight of Thor, swoons, and spends the rest of the evening avoiding him. In spite of this, he seems to be having a pretty great time.
Steve had started to frown and open his mouth in incomprehension,  but behind Thor’s shoulder, Bruce had very silently yet very energetically shook his head and mouthed
“You’re all wrong and also morons,” Tony says. “Well, actually, I guess it is all about a white American. God, we really are the worst, aren’t we?
“Yeah, that’d be great. I’m sure Wanda and Pietro might act all blasé about it but they’d love putting up some Christmas decorations and lights. I know it’s too late for Hanukkah, and they only celebrate it with each other, but still.”
Steve leans against his side. If he leans back against him or feels happy and warm all over, well, it’s just because of the Christmas spirit.
Riri stares at her like the main character in a high school romcom. Next to them, Bruce, Jane Foster and Vision are talking about astrophysics and philosophy, every once in a while paying attention to the teenagers’ conversation.
Peter looks at Tony and Natasha like a forlorn puppy. Tony resolutely ignores him, because he is not going to fall for that. Not again.
“Attention, Avengers! And Loki. I have a statement to make,” Tony bellows, entirely clad in his Iron Man costume except for his face.
FRIDAY informs him Steve is in his room, ever the lifesaver, and Tony does not check his reflection in the elevator’s mirror as he goes up.
Shuri scoffs at them. “She obviously just swapped the steel for vibranium. True question is, how did you even get that vibranium in the first place?”
“You know when I told you I hoped we could be professional around each other this wasn’t what I meant, right?”
“Yes. He told me you’re an asshole,” Sam deadpans. She gasps in mock offense and throws her sufganiyot at him. When he catches it, she uses the distraction to kick him in the shin.
But as he watched Steve’s face… He didn’t know what it was. Whether it was the drugs, or the release of all this tension, or everything he’d just found out. But, suddenly, after all these years trying in vain to guess what Steve was thinking…He just felt like he understood him so well, now.
tired,” Tony sighed, as he strolled past him and into the living room. “And, honestly, there’s a lot that’s still filed under ‘What The Actual Fuck’, and I reserve the right not to respond to any of that, until The Actual Fuck is identified, okay?”
come from Vormir. If he hadn’t spent the whole of yesterday thinking about the person Nat grew into, and the debt he owed her, and the value of her
Steve almost felt sorry for Gary, knowing that he was about to miss out on what might be the only moment of excitement in his entire SHIELD career…that this might be the end of his SHIELD career.
Nick was cut short by a pained cry of alarm, as a particularly well-placed blow hit him right on the bridge of the nose.
That it was okay if collars and cuffs excited him and the thought of ball gags made him uncomfortable - that he didn’t have to explain it to anyone, not even to himself.
“So you kidnapped us. Obviously,” Bucky shot back, sarcastically. Stapes shoulders slumped even further.
Steve remembered that he’d already felt guilty for ignoring Bucky. He’d been thinking that he’d have to explain
He tried to lose himself in Steve’s easy, earnest conversation, the way he had for the last few months. Tony
Tony carried on caressing Steve’s back, firmer now, rolling Steve’s skin from his fingers to the heel of his hand, working his way down from Steve’s shoulders. Steve could literally feel himself being taken apart piece by piece, until eventually he just sort of…floated away from himself. His eyes slipped shut, and a dreamy smile settled comfortably on his face, and he let that wonderful warmth soak right into him, all other thoughts completely forgotten.
And again Steve laughed, thinking of how many times he’d though that exact same thing – and how bitter he’d always been about it. How he’d simply taken for granted that he would never find that person.
put as much distance as possible between him and Steve, who had been seated in between Bucky and Sam at the other end of the table.
Tony glanced at Steve and cocked a performative half smile, before he turned and strolled confidently towards the bar.
to pay attention to every tiny detail of his surroundings, for once. For the first time in ten years, Steve wasn’t listening out for anything-
Whimpering impatiently, Tony forced his weight forward, doing his best to push his feet to the floor as additional leverage - and, of course, Steve went with it, just like Tony knew he would. He kept Tony held close to him as he took a step backwards, cradling him protectively as the two of them fell into the couch, pulling Tony into his lap. There was another curl of friction as Tony ground into him, hotter and tighter than before. It flared up and burned out into an ever deeper need, an urgent, compulsive desperation for
in truth serums, cures for genuine sexual disfunction, reducing the likelihood of addiction, and any number of other potential leads that had been raised by their research, and discounted. That, and the fact that the results of each experiment were recorded and filed separately – there was not one single report making reference to multiple studies, or even multiple tests.
, deliberately dragging his tongue over Steve’s skin. The friction curled up along Steve’s spine, the pleasure beginning to pulse low in his hips – every beat a desperate craving for more.
He opened them again to watch Steve waving the nearest guests over, doing a reasonable impression of shocked and socially awkward. As expected, most of them were too drunk or too disinterested or too awkward themselves to acknowledge him – and, of course, as soon as one brave woman came to his aid, everyone else considered themselves off the hook and went back about their business.
being Captain America… Just being Steve, doing all those things. Making all those choices. Facing all those consequences…
“...I spent my entire life fighting a powerful urge to tell people what idiots they are,” Pepper observed casually, never breaking her stare. Tony grinned - more at the fact that she’d been listening than at what she’d actually said.
The music in Tony’s workshop was blaring loud enough that he could hear it over the top of the industrial angle grinder he was using. Not that he was really listening to it. The scream of tortured metal and the chorus of electric guitars had all faded into the same wall of sound, just a buffer between him and the outside world, focusing him on his work-
an impulse here, beyond the simple elation of being curled up in Steve’s arms - and besides the basic need to be with him - then it was more like that urge to
Something that had hit him like a lightning strike; dazzling and disorienting and totally unforeseeable…
“Well, no – I just don’t know how to say any of this yet,” Tony clarified. “And I will think about it, and figure this out, and do this better, I promise. But, what I mean right now is…”
Steve considered pointing out that he once went seventy years without a drink - but, even in this mood, he recognised that it would’ve been needlessly combative.
opening up to Tony at the time. That, in the moment, he’d felt safe and supported and so much less alone, for the first time in as long as he could remember…
Not reliving the searing pain of palladium breaking down in his chest, or the familiar panic of having someone he thought he knew -
He’d rethought so many parts of that plan, added so much to it, all without recognising what he was doing…
the Steve that Tony was, quite accurately, remembering - and he could see what Steve was really doing.
“I’ll radio as soon as I’ve got them,” Tony just talked over the top of her… taking careful aim at the wall, twenty feet to the left of the main entrance-
That intoxicating warmth was still pulsing beneath his skin, moving closer to the surface, pinching his shoulders in anticipation of something….
No time to deal with the fall out, if his younger self did exactly what he had done when he was younger - panicked and ran.
was wrong in the visceral, instinctive way that limbs-bent-backwards are wrong. The same sudden sickness in his gut, the same
At the top was an intricate pattern of tiny little squares, which Tony somehow recognised as a language. There was something about the flow of it, the fluid way the ink trailed from left to right even though the symbols themselves were so rigid… this was a train of thought, it was the alien version of notes in the margin. And then, just beneath that, in very square, almost childish handwriting, was written a single word: FOCUS.
He saw Nick go to answer him, a silent objection stuttering into nothing on his lips. And then he abandoned it in favour of cautiously picking up the rest of the pages, his eye jumping erratically from page to page as soon as they were in his hands.
Steve let out a relieved breath, far less subtly than he would have liked – still not relaxing entirely.
had known the whole truth about Bucky, and Tony’s parents, since the day that Hydra fell. But rather than coming straight to Tony, Steve had decided to go on his own secret manhunt.
Steve felt a spike of anxiety from the very bottom of his gut. When he swallowed it down, it tasted bitter.
Steve scoffed another drowsy laugh, pulling his jeans up over his hips. And then, as he shrugged into his t-shirt, he really thought about what Bucky was saying…
, Nick is right. Those tests are pretty worthless after a point. I mean, I’ve never taken an IQ test that would reward you for recognising an alien post-it note, while on drugs.”
Right now, Steve couldn’t think of a single thing he’d change about his surroundings. Everything was beautiful, and comfortable, and quiet, and for the moment, Steve was happy to enjoy what was. To just
body he saw in his fantasies - these more muscular shoulders, this slightly broader chest, lit up by the glow of the arc reactor…
If Steve had been able to find words in that moment, ‘stunning’ would have been an apt one - because this might’ve been the only time in his life he could have used it literally. The only time he had been genuinely, physically stunned into silence by something, because it was just that beautiful...
And, God, the electricity that ran through him in that moment. The anticipation of this, after all these years of build-up, the urgent need for this release-
Steve was used to lying awake all night, trying to remember every detail of the day, and analysing every possible interpretation, and guessing at every potential outcome – and usually,
Steve wasn’t sure he understood it… But he couldn’t deny that he felt a little calmer, when he recognised that he had no choice but to deal with this now.
And, with that, he walked confidently over the railing, and beckoned them to follow. They glanced at one another again, and then Tony looked over to the external hard-drive he had plugged into the computer panel… still blinking patiently, as the download continued… The he turned back to Steve and shrugged.
It was like Steve’s whole body was tugged sharply towards him. All of a sudden, Tony was so much more than a beautiful man. He was the physical embodiment of everything Steve loved so much about him; all that intelligence and bravery and kindness, made real. The urge to reach out to him was dizzying. To be able to grab hold of that dazzling,
And that meant Steve’s whole life – all his hope and dreams, all his future happiness – now rested on Tony. It meant that everything Steve had ever wanted, everything being dangled so tantalisingly close, was only possible if Tony was sorry for attacking Bucky like that… or would at least acknowledge that it had been wrong… or even, that he didn’t expect Steve to pretend otherwise…
He watched as Bucky gingerly lifted the makeshift bandage. And then he felt Steve just dissolve in relief beside him, as they both recognised-
thing that’s a big deal. Everything else heals extra fast, but sun damage? Even a slight pinking of the skin can hang around for months, or leave a scar-”
Suddenly, he remembered the story he had so completely abandoned in the last few days, the version of reality that had actually carried on existing without him...
“...Because, when Nat and I were in that bunker, finding out the truth about Hydra, we found out about all these big events that Hydra had orchestrated, all the things they’d been doing behind the scenes for years…” he explained, as Tony nodded impatiently,
And Steve watched her explain it – or, rather, he watched Tony’s face as she explained it, the way he ran ahead with a thousand more interesting questions, while she was relaying her basic instructions. Steve smiled at the way Tony just knew the exact co-ordinates for the compound conference room – but probably
“Well, whatever did it, we’d better go before they fix it – whatever we’re about to run into, it’s better than staying here.”
tried to think through some of those issues. Mainly - because it seemed like the most important thing, as well as the topic most likely to hold his attention - he’d
“Ha. I was literally just thinking that I end up in too much bullshit because I keep trying to be polite,” Steve laughed.
“Yeah, because they hate us, or because they want something from us,” Sam reminded him. “But we don’t have any reason to think these guys hate us, and there doesn’t seem to be anything they want from us - if there was, why wouldn’t they have just taken it by now?”
Maybe, if he could’ve introduced himself to Tony wearing ordinary, modern clothes, and addressed that team looking like a normal, human person…
desperate – to get you to see me, maybe I’d have seen you. Maybe if I’d been less concerned with making you see my point of view, I’d have seen yours. Maybe I’d have seen that it wasn’t
“Sorry kid,” he murmured, as he set it aside, “but there are worse things you can lose in the ocean.”
Tony had to pause there and inhale deeply, like he’d done that whole part of the speech in a single breath-
“...You died, in 2023, in that timeline,” Steve replied, dropping his eyes. “You died saving the entire universe.”
Steve didn’t have time to catch his breath, before Tony had pulled back and thrust into him again, and again, fucking him in a fast, solid rhythm. Sending wave after wave of feeling crashing through him, quicker than Steve could process them – soon pulling Steve into a state of mindless, desperate pleasure. He didn’t know how long he stayed lost there. How many minutes he spent just letting this sensation pulse through him, his cock weeping against his stomach, his fingers stinging under his grip on the sheets.
Finally, in desperation, he tried to think of the look of horror in Tony’s eyes as he realised what he was doing – surely
What he wanted and what he felt and what that said about him… Steve couldn’t work up the enthusiasm to care about any of that, right now. Not now that he’d started thinking about Tony –
Actually, it felt a lot like being in the sun used to feel, back when he could just get regular old sunburn…
“So, may I introduce you to Mr Rousseau May, and Mr Rousseau Taylor, the directors of the festival,” an unfamiliar voice announced…
And then Tony grabbed at him again, kissing him desperately, his body warm and solid in Steve’s arms… And Steve stilled. He held his hands firms against Tony’s waist, forcibly changing the pace of this, kissing Tony slower, and deeper…
Steve hissed out a string of swearwords, arching his back, tears pricking at the corners of his eyes as his whole body burned with the need for more. It
By now, Steve had softened into a warm, giddy intoxication, where everything was happy and comfortable and faintly amusing…
...He could let Steve see how much he cared about him, and he could put all of himself into every gesture, and admit to himself that he
Tony took the length of him slowly, caressing his hips, wanting to make Steve moan like that again, wanting to
And, as such, it came as of something of a surprise to recognise that he was already gripped by this entirely illogical, purely physical thrill… thinking of the blood draining from his body…
As much fun as it was, as good as it felt, to finally get his say… This had only ever been the start of it. This was just foreplay. In the fantasy, in the purest sense, Tony got to see the reaction to this-
…When it had first occurred to him that one day Steve would grow old, and become frail…and die… And, what, Tony was just supposed to go on living for a thousand years after that?
Steve’s smile still lingered, even as he planned his next few words - words he didn’t want to say, about a topic he never wanted to revisit…
“We’re going to do our best to fix this mess – C’mon, stand up” Steve informed her, offering her a hand. “We’re going to set those hostages free, and we’re going to do our best to make sure no one get’s hurt in the meantime – and if the authorities on your planet have a problem with your family after that, then that’s what they have to deal with.”
And then he heard Steve hum a little smile, before he dropped his head and pressed a soft kiss to that same spot.
There was something so compelling in that, in and of itself. The fact that Tony looked so beautiful. The fact that he looked so…
2) There is a fairly obvious drug effect on both of them in this chapter, which leads to some pretty out of character behaviour - although doesn't lead either of them to do anything immoral/dangerous/outside their usual ideology/especially embarrassing (I don't think, anyway) And I think it's fairly clear that it's the effects of the drugs.
“Er, right, thanks” Tony muttered – because this was, in fact, the third time she’d mentioned drugs “I’d tip you, but…”
, and therefore probably you… and now that I’m here, I think, you… aren’t like them.” She said, sadly. “And I’m risking a lot, coming here – and if you tell them I’m here…But, we’re… If no one stops them, we won’t have anything left to lose, and we can’t stop them on our own. They’ve made it so that we can’t stop them on our own. So. I’m here to ask if you’ll help us.” She finished, on a nervous rush of air.
body, slightly hunched and creaky moving. She took her time, carefully lowering the bar back into place behind her, and gently polishing her fingerprints from the surface of it – which gave Steve a few seconds longer to consider her… to realise that she wasn’t human. The proportions of her face were slightly wrong, and there was a bluish tint to her skin that he’d just worked out
“What do you think would’ve happened, if I’d said that in the bunker?” He asked, “If instead of just standing there like a cardboard standee of an idiot-” And he felt a little swell of pride, when Tony snorted a laugh at that “if I had just said, I’m sorry Tony, and I love you…”
“I don’t know, it’s only going to be half the story… I just, suddenly there are a lot of unknowns that probably
“They lie, you know” She added eventually, her voice quieter. “They manipulate, and they mislead, and they-”
Tony’s hips rocked into him of their own accord; an entirely reflexive, corporal reaction that he was then powerless to stop. As soon as he moved, that same searing pleasure engulfed him, that same physical longing consumed him - Steve’s face lit up with that same beautiful excitement. Tony had no choice but to surrender to that sensation, simply following his body as he chased it, quickly building into a fast, deep rhythm.
drinks that had been offered to him… And little bites of food… And he was pretty sure he remembered eating a flower, at one point…
been the person who would have lied to his face when he was at his most vulnerable, spied on him and tested him and let him build a fake friendship when he needed a real one - and Steve had always known that, because this was the Nat who did it to Tony.
So Tony swallowed again, and again, letting that feeling warm him through from the inside, the pain melting away from his limbs, his muscles loosening and lightening…
...He could take comfort in his own happiness. He could acknowledge that he’d made a choice that worked for
But his head was swimming from the cocktail of drugs he was on, and his whole being was still reeling from Steve’s outburst, and-
“Well, I’m already working on providing the world with clean renewable energy,” Tony answered, robotically, “so you’re going to have to give me a bit more than that.”
Already, Steve knew that a raft of sinister images and emotional traumas were waiting for him, as soon as his excitement dulled enough to let them in. He knew a fresh wave of anger and indignation was gathering, growing hotter each time he refused to look at it, until eventually it was sure to flare up.
answer, that somehow spoke to his elevated mood and his most long-held concerns, and everything in between.
“Oh God yes please Tony yes,” Steve barked, trying to jerk back against him, his eyes stinging and his mouth suddenly dry. He let out an especially undignified howl of protest as Tony pulled away from him completely, which broke down into a pleading whimpering, as one second without contact became two, and then three…
Steve shoved the phone back into his pocket with a bit too much force, screwed his eyes shut, and told himself not to think about it. He curled his hands into fists, digging his fingernails hard into his palms-
Flinching away from a hundred worst case scenarios. Imagining all the ways he could possibly fuck this up, and just how bad that could potentially be…
Bucky like that - because he’d already been through that agony once, and numbed himself to it as best he could… Because he’d only survived that pain by cleaving it out of his chest, and refusing to think about it.
And then, just like that, Steve found himself standing all alone, with those final words still ringing in his ears.
And he’d finally stopped trying to work out how he felt about Steve, and acknowledged that he already knew.
of them,” and then he let go of a frustrated little breath, and turned back to Bucky, the low lull of reassurance starting up again.
“Yes, fuck me, please fuck me, please-” again, his pleading was cut short by a cry, this time because Tony had taken his hand away to wet his fingers. Steve willed himself not to hold his breath, feeling himself coming close to tears in the few seconds that Tony wasn’t touching him-
actually smart, or funny, or kind – and just kind of bad at small talk. What if, when you get past that, it’s not so uncomfortable to be around him? What then?”
So, there was no way to separate the nicer parts of last night from the scary parts - and, even if there was, it should really be the scary parts that Steve dealt with first-
to get to Steve, to warn Steve, possibly protect Steve from a threat he didn’t even understand yet - and he couldn’t risk calling Steve, or going right back to him, when he didn’t know who was watching.
put all his internal pain into one blow, that he literally couldn’t hit someone with as much hatred as he felt for them… that he wasn’t strong enough.
Steve was tempted to stay there a moment and just watch him go… It was only the fear of being caught that pushed him, begrudgingly, to turn the corner.
Like his thoughts were separating from one another, sliding over the top of one another like oil on water.
But Tony was wound so tight now, flooded with such an urgent adrenaline, that it made him jump. He flinched away from her, his arm knocking into the counter with a strength that he usually kept carefully concealed.
And Tony laughed affectionately when he saw just how quickly Steve had thrown the door open, which meant his face was lit up with that warm happiness when Steve first saw him, his eyes shining and a hint of a blush over his cheekbones-
Twelve letters written from a Vampire named Dimitri to someone named Demi – who Tony assumed was also a vampire, but couldn’t tell for sure… Dimitri’s letters had contained very little detail about Demi, or indeed Dimitri. They didn’t give any clue as to where or when they were being written, they made no mention of recent events or the current political climate or… well, anything at all, except Ottilie.
Tony was so full of endearment and affection that it broke out of him in a grin. Which was something of a strange reaction – because, actually, he found that whole thing heart-breaking.
“Oh, he’s still at the bar,” Pepper replied breezily. “That Scaramouche guy found us, and said you were here, and I think he was going to wait for Bucky and Sam…”
He spent the entire flight home pacing from one end of the plane to the other, alternating between daydreaming about Tony and repeatedly checking the time.
to save people – you know, more than risking my life repeatedly, and going through incredible pain, and facing inhuman terrors – if any of those people had ever got off their asses and done
chance of Tony convincing himself otherwise, he had a single-minded time traveller on hand to warn him of exactly what would happen if he kept secrets from loved ones.
He gave it the briefest glance when he first strolled through the door, but he didn’t really think anything of it. He’d been staying in high-class hotels for long enough to recognise a brown-nosing business gift when he saw one.
It took Tony a few seconds to focus on the text, his eyes were so weary by now. A message from Rhodey, sent from halfway around the world:
And then Steve was kissing him again, more urgently this time, devouring Tony’s mouth without any restraint-
, at you… Trying to kill your best friend for it was just…” and he sighed, heavily, as he realised there just wasn’t any other word, “
… I don’t know if I would. Just because… it really was half a second. And I’d be scared to death that if I changed something… that I’d be left with something I couldn’t put right…” He sighed, and glanced up at Rhodey. “But that doesn’t mean I’m not sorry, and that doesn’t mean I wouldn’t do it differently next time. And – does this make any sense at all?”
He added two heaped spoons of white sugar to far too huge a mug of hot, very strong coffee, taking some small pleasure in his harmless little indulgences - the comfort of knowing that an unhealthy personal habit could be excused, just this once…
His frown deepened. That seemed a very odd thing to observe… He couldn’t work out why he would be afraid of
pretty sure I can work out the science of this, though. And I do have a hell of a lot of research here to help me, and a lot of it looks like it specifically refers to how you adapt these drugs… the other way, at least… and there are other experiments I could do first, to check I’m on the right track. See if these elements react the way I’m expecting them to, in general…”
Could he really bear to hope that there was a way out of this? Could he stand the agony of seriously searching for a way to make this work – would he be able to cope, when the answer was
"How often does it happen, then?" Clint asked, eyes clear and it was clear he wanted more information and biting back the instinct. "If you don't mind, but the transformation? Are you so scared it could get set off that fast?"
“Yes,” Tony said, voice a little too tight. “Except for the ornaments.” And some ill placed mistletoe.
"Great," Tony sighed. "Which means it will take forever for them to get over whatever issues they're having."
"Yeah, but he doesn't wear a heart monitor anymore," Natasha pointed out. "It might not be a problem anymore. And Phil," but she trailed off, no words coming.
Thor stilled, something shuttering closed on his expression. "Have you been here this whole time?" he asked.
"Do not jest about that," Thor said, shaking his head. "Not about your life. You made your own damned choices here, do not blame those who punish you."
A few afternoons later, Clint sat cross legged on the floor near the kitchen, several boxes stacked beside him. Tony was off with Pepper doing a media jaunt—and supposedly paperwork as well—and Steve still hadn't returned from his visits. So while he knew Bruce was around in the tower, he considered himself relatively alone.
"As much as I could.  He was a civilian, and one of the primary scientists in Operation Rebirth.  He did a lot of testing for us.  He was a decent man when I knew him," Steve answered, nodding once.
"They will get better.  But it won't happen overnight.  It'll take time and you have to be willing to let it," she replied.
Natasha opened her mouth to respond, closed it, repeated the action and finally managed to speak, "Did he realize he'd done it?"
"I'm sorry," Clint said, not an automatic reaction. "Firstly, that you've never understood how wonderful cats are with being allergic, and secondly that... well, you have to worry about something like that."
"Well, that's the thing with grief," Tony said, not quite approaching the ledge. "You sort of trip over it whether you mean to or not."
Bruce leaned back, resting on his hands and letting his center of balance tilt away from the edge, "I'll be careful."
Steve followed him over, looking into the studio before stepping past Tony into the room. He turned fully around, “This, Tony you really have thought of everything." He turned, meeting Tony's eyes. "Thank you," he said, and Tony abruptly snapped his eyes away.
"But you have control," Clint said, dragging over a bar stool and quickly forking food into his mouth, still watching Bruce.
"Probably wise.  I figured it's best to ask a minimum number of questions as to either of their reactions to pretty much anything."
keep it. I promise it is securely and secretly stored away and no one would be able to tell you drew it anyhow."
"Look," Clint shook his head. "He was my handler. We worked together. He had no one else," he added, looking back at the boxes. "Who might—" Rather than finish the sentence he tossed the ties back in, having been unable to get rid of a single one before pulling out a battered box where he knew Phil liked to keep his cards and freezing when he opened it.
Chuckling, Thor shook his head slightly. "I believe that was Loki's fault. I had to keep up with him somehow, and somewhere along the way I realized I enjoyed it for its own sake. It was worth his expression when I started arguing with him about a book he hadn't realized I'd read as neither he nor Odin had ordered me to read it."
Tony stilled, turning to look at him for a long moment before snapping his eyes back. "Shrapnel in my heart. Keeps it out." He had told Bruce what it was, on the Helicarrier when he wanted Bruce at least to be on his side. But no one else who didn't already know.
"Go with that theme then and you've got one gift done," Natasha advised, heading toward the men's socks.
"I'm actually thinking about how much I want to cause damage to someone who isn't here anymore," Steve rumbled in response.
Her lips curled upward at that, "Alright, true. What about hard wood or something like that instead of tile?"
"What about you?" Clint asked, still not looking over. "I mean, it's your first Christmas in this era," he continued.
"Use your new-found powers responsibly," Tony added, tilting up to drag his teeth over Steve's bottom lip.
"Yeah, well, nice and me don't really get along on any level," Tony said, looking away and counting down equations in his head.
"Poor soul," Tony said, even though since becoming Iron Man there had been few new videos of him on the internet with his shirt off—he was sure Pepper and Jarvis were relieved about the entire thing. "Dare I ask after you or would you hex me?"
"Come on," Clint said, pausing on the way back to the front of the store to pick up a plushy toy of Thor on the way. "We need to find you a frame and there's a store that sells movies nearby."
Gaping after Thor for a moment, Loki performed the second most foolish action he had taken that day and strode after him, "What by Odin's eye do you mean by that?"
“Cute,” Bruce repeated before he shook his head. “Well now I can’t really date anyone else, because who else would find the Other Guy cute anyway?”
Steve glanced between the three agents, finally turning his attention on Fury, "What are you looking for in the report?"
Steve paused, blinking before looking up and mentally cursing when he saw the mistletoe there. "Oh," Tony managed. "Who the fuck bought mistletoe?"
Tony gave him a sideways look, dropping the packages on his work table that was off to one side of living room. It wasn't the same as his full lab but he still liked it. "I'm sorry, did you expect Stone Age decor?"
Bruce paused at that, nodding again, "I don't want this to be a fling.  And I'm not sure what that's going to look like, but there's got to be a way around the other guy."
“Okay,” Steve said, looking bemused but also unbearably fond and Tony's chest was too tight so he pulled Steve back down, biting into his mouth.
"No," Tony replied. "Under my roof, my protection, yada, yada. Also, my alcohol you're drinking so shut up and enjoy it."
She paused next to a rack of some of the most expensive sunglasses she had seen in a very long time, "That actually doesn't surprise me much."
“And you think that has anything to do with you?” Thor asked, barely turning his chin over his shoulder, not quite looking back at Loki.
"This should just take a minute," Bruce said, stepping into the store to inquire about the steampunk-style telescope that was in the window.
Her lips curved into a smile and she looked toward Samuel, "Go chaperone." The cat barely reacted but naturally moved after Clint.
Steve's eyes narrowed at their silence and he carefully cleared his expression and turned to Clint, speaking softly, his tone and posture indicating remorse, "He, he's dead. He died fighting Loki."
Rolling a shoulder, Tony looked around. “Anything I could remember. You have a front room too, but I thought this might make it feel a bit more like… someplace you wanted to hang out.”
Thor shrugged, looking unconcerned. People stared at him in the streets and though he had long since picked up Midgardian clothing to wear but he still got sidelong glances as he passed. "It is harmless," he said.
"Well, those bottles may show up later," Steve responded with a grin, bracing his hands on the counter on either side of Tony's hips.
Bruce followed the archer down to the lab, entering his code and pushing the door open.  He winced slightly at the music volume, but simply crossed the room to where Tony was working. The inventor in question barely looked up, finally shoving his goggles back and looking up in confusion at the pair. “What’re you doing down here? Tell me Richards hasn’t opened another portal or some such nonsense we need to deal with.”
"He—" Tony frowned, brows drawing together. "Wait. You actively went to Rhodey and asked him about me? You mentioned that at the elevator but—”
Scratching the base of the kitten’s tail, Clint propped his chin up with his other hand, elbow on the counter.
“Please don’t use him as an excuse,” Thor said. “Mother would vouch for you, as would I, if you gave us the chance.”
"It made quite the impression on Loki," Tony replied and Clint just shook his head, going to help Steve with breakfast.
She ran her fingers through one of the front locks of her red hair, causing it to cling to her skin as she considered that, "I'm going to set aside the very serious concern over what that says about the Hulk as part of Bruce and focus on what you said originally.  You think the Hulk is in love with you?"
Loki took an equal step away from Thor, "Until they can make a cell to hold me.  I'll not spend my days trapped."
"Sure, Potts," he said, pressing up into the kiss quickly. "Enjoy the statement. Remember, we're the
“Yeah, yeah,” Tony said, waving a hand. “You too, sleep tight, the bedroom’s through there. I’ll see you in the morning, or whenever everyone’s up. Don’t like, expect everyone in the breakfast room when you’re there though. Oh and we haven’t heard from Thor yet, but sleep well.”
"I see no reason to celebrate their holidays," came the icy response as he dropped the illusion he still hadn't released, so that he was no longer dividing his attention and energies.
"I can fetch those for you as well," the clerk offered, hurrying away when Natasha nodded and waved a hand in his direction.
“Rest assured Clint will make certain you see,” Natasha replied, rising to find a throw blanket or three.
"I cannot express the extent to which I do not care," Tony said, mirroring Fury's posture for a moment and then realizing what he was doing, dropping his hands to his sides instead.
She arched an eyebrow, “You’re sure? I can finish this up if you would rather take the evening off from them.”
"But," Tony started again. He was used to fourteen foot trees that were professionally decorated and didn't know what to do with such a scraggly specimen.
Falling very still except for a clenching of his fists which telegraphed through the muscles on his shoulders, Steve drew a deep breath and bit back the first things to come to mind. “If you pity me, I won’t keep talking,” Tony muttered.
Finding what he wanted, Clint moved to the counter quickly so Steve wouldn't see what he was buying, stowing the films in his bag. "I'll be outside," he told Steve and moved outside, letting his head thud against the side of the building.
Steve stopped with him, looking at the display of ties for a moment before glancing at his teammate, "Clint?"
Clint hopped back up, going to fetch those things and bringing whipped cream and blueberries as well. Bruce glanced in that direction, "Oh, I didn't realize we had berries."
Steve smiled faintly, turning his head to rest it on the pillow and barely able to see Tony from the corner of his eye, "No, I'm good."
"I don't know, it might be nicer than the mocking of his profession which this could be taken as," Clint said and shrugged.
"Everything in this city just reminds me of what's gone," Clint said and rubbed a hand over his chest. "It's not better and it's getting better so slowly."
"Some of the things that were said, what happened to you, and ," he ran a hand over the back of his neck.  "Actually that mostly."
Stepping into the kitchen, Clint paused at seeing the other two there, but a small mew from Natasha's direction brought him over instantly. "Is that a kitten?"
"Just don't go near the fondue set," Clint said. "Steve, for some strange reason told Tony he could tinker with it."
"Apparently," Clint said. "Actually, that was a huge blow up at SHIELD for a while. Well, and then he turned around and asked for amnesty for Magneto. He's a walking problem some days."
"Stupid things like proper drinks, his history," Tony shrugged. "I know a lot more about Asgard now, just from throw away comments."
Pressing his nose against her shoulder, he clung to her, listening vaguely to the sounds of Darth Vader and R2-D2 in the next room over.
“I don’t know what to say about the other stuff,” Bruce said when the silence had stretched between them too long.
"They're going to keep damaging each other until they do.  Though they seem to come together well enough in a fight."
"We do, yes.  I'm still trying to figure out even where to start.  I haven't really done Christmas in a few years."
"I wasn't there, I don't know.  But the ornament was gone and they weren't talking about much by the time I arrived," Natasha stretched, keeping her gaze on him.
“Yeah,” she said, nodding and grinned when he slid over to the other couch, leaning down to kiss her with a hand going to her hair. She wrapped her fingers around his biceps and for a minute all the stress of a long-distance relationship disappeared.
"Guys?" Clint tried again, looking around. "Come on, I woke up out of that mind control thing and went down the surface. I haven't seen him since the portal opened--did something happen? Is he injured?"
"I have to admit I was surprised when you said you remembered any gifts this year," Charles mused, watching the other man.
"I can't imagine why," Tony said. An hour or so later, he was getting more desperate though. He'd seen a remote controlled airplane by chance for Rhodey but otherwise he'd made no progress. "People find shopping fun, don't they?" he asked the shelves in front of him, finding nothing useful.
"Ugh, and lose the joy of commercial air travel? Come on, I know Stark has better alcohol than this."
"Okay, now you've lost me," Steve said, curling his fingers around his own cup.  "Why would hating you be for my own good?"
She nodded slightly from where she was draped on the couch with a book.  Pulling her legs up near her chest, she motioned to the rest of the couch, "Yes.  Come sit down."
His eyes slid away. "I have no illusions that I lost two of my best agents that day," he said. "Because Phil Coulson had always been my best eye and Barton will never come back. I'm not asking you to leave them, you were always supposed to be a part of that team one way or another," he said, eye moving back. "But I hope they're not assignments that are mutually exclusive," and he left the
Thor nodded once again before he turned and left the room almost as abruptly as he came in, leaving Tony and Steve standing. “I don’t actually think that could have gone better,” Tony said after a beat of silence.
Steve sighed, shaking his head as he poured them each a cup of coffee, setting Tony's within the other man's reach, "Then we'll cross that bridge as we come to it."
"So I never pegged you for being the impulsive kisser," Clint said, eyes sliding away before he forced himself to look at Bruce.
"Alright," Clint said and leaned down, looking seriously at the two fondue sets. "Shut up and you can go together." They both stilled and Clint shoved them up in a cupboard.
"Well, luckily Pepper had framed the damn arc reactor he came out of the cave with, when he built a better one. So he shoved that in his chest and flew off in his shiny new suit with the old arc reactor and got pummeled to the ground because Stane built a suit of armor too," Rhodey said. "Now that I am sure you can find footage of. They fought, and Tony had Pepper overload the big arc reactor generator while both he and Stane were on the roof. Stane died, Tony woke up in the hospital connected to a battery until he could build another reactor."
“Honestly?” Thor shrugged. “With you in the picture I don’t expect anything to be easy at all. But if I strong arm you enough it’s possible to keep you on track.”
“Yeah, but,” Clint rolled his shoulder. “Do you like me independently of the Hulk or are you guys catching each other’s feelings?”
"How much of a partnership in action as well as in name?" Steve asked, pieces continuing to fall into place and he disliked the picture they were giving him.
He pauses again to let a dramatic silence stand. Of course, considering he is standing on a box in the middle of their living room, the effect is significantly ruined.
He’s breathless as he stops monologuing, trying not to watch Steve’s reaction, hands paused mid-air from all of his waving around. He heaves for a second before he starts to walk away and stop embarrassing himself and-
he adds when Rhodey, Natasha, the Maximoffs, T’Challa, Sam and Steve start nodding. “No, this is much more important than all of that garbage.”
Thor is thrilled about the entire process. Before they know it, he invited half of the Asgardians to their place, as well as Selvig, Darcy, Jane, Eddie Redmayne, for whom Jane apparently left Thor, and all of Peter’s friends with their families. Oh, yeah, and Fury, Hill and Coulson, of course. What could go wrong?
“It is indeed,” Vision says, “statistically much likelier that a white American male is once again the cause of our troubles.”
He comes in person to pick Peter and his hot aunt up at their apartment. He settled everything with her before because he’s not suicidal - well - not in this specific scenario at least - and he is pretty sure Peter doesn’t know because when the kid opens the door, he is in jeans and a bright green sweater showing Darth Vader wearing a Christmas hat.
The doors open without a warning and Steve is sitting right in front of him. He looks up from his tablet, startled, his face impossibly soft for someone whose traits seem carved in marble.
And this is notwithstanding the little fact that this tree has a color code and that color code is silvery white.”
to call her, but she just laughed for five minutes and then hung up on me. Being on a cruise has made her very rude if you ask me.”
“Well, you gotta admit, it is pretty weird. Why did he even wrestle a fish in the first place? Didn’t his flying thingie bring him straight to you? Did he swim there?”
“Why did Thor just jump aboard my ship with the most gigantic fish I have ever seen in his arms to invite me to your house for Christmas?” Pepper says when she calls him the day before Christmas with no prior greeting.
“Yes, alright, the world sucks, we live on a garbage planet ready to explode any moment and our president is an orange toupeed buffoon, we know that, Clint but this is more important. In fact, I would even go as far as saying this is the most important emergency any of us has ever faced.”
“The kid - Peter - Spider-Man - he asked me to come to his apartment for Christmas. So I asked him about it, as any good concerned mentor would, and you know what he told me? Every Christmas since his uncle died, it’s just him and his aunt, all alone in this tiny place they own, because there’s no one in their family left.” Tony clears his throat and looks away from Steve’s big trusting blue eyes.
On the other side of Clint, Pietro is talking in hushed tones to Wanda, a conversation filled with foreign words and dramatic hand gestures. Vision is doing this weird thing where he closes his eyes and floats and might be taking a nap or just reviewing a very interesting book on Goodreads.com. Loki is stuck by their side looking bored and playing with a StarkPhone with disinterest because, as Thor said, he needed to socialize with people his age.
“Being an Avenger is also a lot of responsibilities,” Steve says more seriously. “People rely on you. You need to accept that with that amazing power of yours comes-”
