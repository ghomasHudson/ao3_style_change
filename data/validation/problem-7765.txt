Once he was done, Steve looked up with an expectant look on his face, which really did not help tamper down Tony's confusion. When Tony didn't instantly react, Steve spun the cake around so Tony could see the words he had written on there and then gave another expectant look.
That was when Tony decided that their last and final surprise needed to happen sooner rather than later.
"Daddy?" The boy weakly croaks out.
If birthday wishes came true, Tony was getting all of his granted all at once.
"I'm so tired." Tony whines before flopping down onto the couch right next to Steve. The alpha just took it in stride, pulling Tony so his face was buried in his lap instead of the couch cushion without even bothering to open his eyes.
"Oh, need to worry about that, it's not going too far." Steve chuckles as he begins to pull his wallet out of his pocket.
As soon as the bartender gave been the slightest of nods, Steve was bustling both of them out of the apartment and into the car where they began to follow the ambulance.
"Forever and ever. That sounds pretty good, doesn't it Petey-Pie?" Tony asks Peter, causing the toddler to jump up and down in excitement.
"What's that star, right there?" Peter asks Tony, pointing at a star right next to the moon.
"Hey, hey, it's okay. I'll take you, okay? I'll drive. You're in no state to." Steve offers, waiting only for a second for confirmation from Tony.
Steve never wanted to be anywhere else but right here with these two boys. This is also why he had an ulterior motive for this vacation.
"I guess we should start getting the day started." Tony reluctantly says, giving one final stretch before finally opening his eyes and looking over at Steve. "Good morning." Tony greets.
“Then in that case, I would love to go out and eat some dinner with you before coming back and cutting into this delicious cake that I so selflessly baked.” Tony lighthearted teases.
"We appreciate it beyond belief. Not that I would change it for anything in the whole world, but getting through this past month has been the hardest thing I've ever had to do." Steve sighs, plopping down at the kitchen table and allowing the comforting smell of his mother's cooking settle him.
"Yes, I know who he is. His name is Steve, he's an artist and does commissions for a living, he's currently on a business trip, and he's desperately single." Peter informs.
Today was supposed to be Peter's very first field trip at school. The little boy had been talking non-stop about it to both of his Dads for weeks.
Steve was so caught up in all of these thoughts, that he didn't even realize that they had walked down all the steps to the viewing ledge.
”Promise that we’ll hunt for mermaids. Sorry I kind of promised that we would search for them while we walk on the path just in case there’s some freshwater mermaid we don’t know about.” Steve quickly cuts in, giving a small and nervous smile when Tony gave him a strange look.
Tony just smiled and leaned over to the side where he had a machine hidden and flipped it on.
"I found a way to connect it to his heart monitor. So I could always keep an eye on him even while I was at work." Tony explains.
But, almost as soon as all the negative thoughts rolled in, positive thoughts came chasing right after them.
The stranger was definitely Tony's type, though, from what was written.
"I've done some research and there are some
Inside were a bunch of blankets and pillows made into a little lay area that would be comfy enough for all of them to sleep on if Peter were able to sleep outside tonight.
"You can be my second Daddy, Steve, it's okay." Peter tries to reassure as if
“Oh, thank God.” Tony eventually breathes out once his body and brain was able to function once again. Although it wasn’t functioning enough for him to stop himself from actually saying that out loud.
And, yeah, maybe they should have focused on getting Peter to only eat healthy food while he was still under the weather, but they figured plain popcorn with no butter or seasonings would fine just this once.
(That could pretty much serve as the theme for the whole of the last couple of months.)
“He was my friend.” Natasha smiled, tired and without warmth. “All decisions have emotional components to them. Any one. Any
because of you. All of that, and still I’ve never been fucking prouder of you than I have in the last six months.”
“Oh man up Rhodes!” The man-Rhodes, presumably-stilled in his motions, something resigned stealing over his features. He turned, pacing over to where Tony was still rubbing at the sore spot on his thigh, the redhead standing off to the side unsuccessfully attempting to conceal a smirk. Proffered an arm. Tony straightened up with a jerk, face alight with glee; and curled his fingers around Rhodes’ bicep. The crowd went berserk.
“Oh, they’re gonna come begging at my heels soon anyway.” Tony returned breezily. “With
He never complained. He liked listening to her too.
And that was what he received, at least in the beginning. The screen sparked to life- Steve’s eyes immediately searched for Bucky, and found him lying prone on the floor with the smoking hole in the place of an arm. That was…that wasn’t
“I’m here on exchange, actually.” Steve returned primly. There was a rustle of static from his earphones-an audible sigh like he’d entirely missed the point. “And I’m pretty sure nothing can kill me in a gallery.”
The all-too familiar word, in an almost entirely unfamiliar accent caught him off-guard, and he jerked up, eyes flying open and fixating on a black figure in the surrounding white, not five hundred metres away. The Panther stood, helm off and tucked into the crook of his shoulder, shoulders pulled back straight and tight. He looked regal against the background, but somehow Steve’s addled mind kept focusing on the unimportant things, and how ice and snow didn’t look so ugly anymore.
Steve watched on, motionless, as the Tony onscreen ran a rough hand through his hair and knuckled at his eyebags.
“Like people care about the scientific accuracy of superhero names – “
Growing up in the back of circus caravans and being shuffled from one foster home to the next wasn’t very conducive for cultivating a reading habit-and Clint didn’t boast of one. He’d only heard the Tolkien novels read out loud, and not until his thirties. Laura started reading
Steve was under no delusions that this solved anything. There was no way that things would proceed as perfectly as they’d discussed in one, brief conversation- the team was still scattered, there was the matter of whether they’d even consent to such an agreement (though Steve couldn’t think of a single reason why any of them wouldn’t leap at the faintest chance to heal the divide). The Council would definitely cause trouble; Steve’s own stubbornness would cause a million more arguments. As long as there were screaming matches rather than fistfights.
“I’ll forgive you.”
“I heard you said some things to Stark.” The afternoon light filtered through the strands of her hair, shadowing her eyelids. Last names. She must be feeling guiltier than she expected.
It wasn’t even a pithy line – the last couple minutes had been the most honest ones Tony had shared with… not a robot, in a good few months. Before he left, he and Steve had been working their way, painstakingly, to a friendship and closeness that then never got the time to settle. Which lead to moments like these, comfortable and ingenuous until Tony got jolted out of it by the reminder of who he was talking to and words like
Steve exhaled, light and amused, and it was almost surreal to think that it was coming from the same source as all those aggravated sighs. He turned to face the mirrors, motion efficient and soundless for all that muscled weight, blue eyes dipping down before rising to affix on his reflection. Tony watched them in the glass too.
Well, he’d tried.
What?
the problem, and Steve didn’t know if that was what he wanted. He didn’t know if he wanted to acknowledge a problem at all. He didn’t know if he wanted to let the myth of a Captain America who forever knew his mind, collapse.
“How much more inland?” He asked, and the voice carried over the salt-heavy air too easily.
“See, the Secretary of State needs to be skilled at diplomacy, and I didn’t believe you at all there-they might wanna review that promotion…”
“Hey, honey. I’m home.”
“Lousy, actually – but I like your wordplay.”
“Look, I knew about you for months before I even…the first thing I did was drag you into a goddamn fight with people having thrice the experience, I was
His beginning words were slow, almost cautious, “I want to ask how you’re doing.” …but hell, he’d never been one for cowardice, and he wouldn’t start now. “But I’m getting the feeling that I’m gonna get punched in the face if I tried.”
Liar. Thief. Liar, liar.
Even if he could see value in Queens now past all the snobbery….sometimes he wasn’t quite sure if the snobbery was real, even back then. As a kid, he’d zoom past the smaller boroughs of New York, nose flattened against a limousine window- and watch the kids playing on the streets. He’d imagine being poor (and what a fucking joke was that, how condescending, a rich kid growing in the silky embrace of luxury wishing to live a little closer to the ground), imagine growing up like his father did, maybe; son to a fruit seller on the Lower East Side. Maybe then his genius would feel a bit more real to the people around him. A bit better deserved. Money
"This paper under your pillow. What's it for?" Steve continues to question, trying not to smile and give everything away as Peter turned around and reached for the slip of paper.
And that was all it took for Steve to settle back into his chair.
"What's the name for the order?" Tony asked, getting ready to write it on the cup even though there was no need; there was no one in there anyway.
"You guys still aren't ready?" Tony lightheartedly asks, making Steve sigh in relief when his tone of voice didn't sound accusing.
Steve couldn't resist tugging both of his boys into his arms, sighing in contentment. Steve was almost a hundred percent sure that there was nothing better in life than early morning snuggles with these two Stark boys.
But, of course, just like last night, it only lasted until about five in the morning, and Tony was once again left to his own devices after.
"Waterfalls? Like the ones from Peter Pan?" A tiny, groggy voice chimes in, making both men look over at the other bed that contained the slowly waking toddler.
"Is this about the chess game you've been playing?" Peter asks, making Tony's heart drop a little.
Their talking quickly turned into flirting as well, which was kind of odd considering neither of them knew the other and Tony didn't even know this guy's name. The only reason he knew the stranger was another man was only because their conversation somehow led to them telling each other what the other looked like.
Steve reached into the cooler and pulled the ring out, completely disregarding his previous plan to do it over lunch.
“The star building.” Peter sleepily murmurs.
"Will Daddy like it?" Steve asks even though he already knows the answer.
Sure enough, though, it only took about three mouthfuls of soup for Peter to begin crying. Even he couldn't resist the tempting smell of Sarah's cooking.
When they got to the gate leading to the back, Tony was there waiting for them, standing underneath a gigantic cardboard sign that read
Still in denial about the whole thing, Tony just figured that someone must have messed with the board in between the time it takes for Tony to get to the board and just pulled out the note instead.
But, of course, Steve couldn’t help but feel intrigued. It probably didn’t help that Tony was beyond attractive and Steve wouldn’t mind taking him out on a real date sometime.
Steve quickly scrambled to put the ring box back into his pocket, scooping up Peter's shoe after and hoping he looked as natural as possible.
"I am not pining!" Tony tries to deny it, but Peter saw right through him.
Even though she had to listen to her son ramble on and on about his sex life just to prove a point to his husband.
So far, their vacation together was perfect and exactly what they all needed.
“Steve. And I haven’t been here before, but I was meeting a very difficult customer and decided to stop in once everything was done.” Steve introduces himself.
"So you're who's ass I've been kicking in chess." The man - Steve,
"Bye, see you tonight!" Peter shouts after him, Tony flipping the teen off as he walked out of the door.
Breakfast went great, and Steve was surprisingly able to keep his cool enough not to raise Tony's suspicions. Now, Tony was currently packing up their car with their picnic stuff and Steve had promised to go into the cabin and help Peter get his shoes on.
Thankfully, the subject was dropped completely and the next thirty minutes were spent trying to keep Peter entertained for the rest of the ride there so the toddler wouldn't self-combust on the way.
They would write messages about each other day - the stranger talking about what kinds of art commissions he did that day, what kind of customers he talked to, and Tony talked about everyone's weird coffee orders and how slow it usually was at night.
Which was fine, it was fine, the stranger didn't have to spend every single day in the same coffee shop. He was allowed to have his own separate life away from a stupid chess game. Who knows, maybe he had a hot date earlier or something.
"Steve?" Tony gasps once it registered in his head what was happening. Almost as if they were in synch, Tony began lifting and lower Peter to the ground at the same time Steve opened up the ring box to show Tony the ring.
"Uh- W-Well, i-if you would like that, then yeah. B-But you don't have to call me... that... if you don't want to. You can just call me whatever you're comfortable with." Steve awkwardly stammers, nowhere close to being prepared for this conversation.
"Is he finally sleeping?" Steve barely manages to grunt out.
"What's on your mind, Little Bug?" Steve asks once he realizes that Peter wasn't going to come right out and say it.
"He's- They're taking him away. I gotta- I gotta go with him." Tony weakly points out, slowly wiggling out of Steve's arms.
"Do you seel candles here as well?" Steve asks, giving Tony a heart-stopping smile when he pointed at the candles in the back.
But, for now, he'll stay.
Before Tony's brain even had a chance to remind him that he was no longer doing anything and therefore was once again bored, the entrance door was swinging open and Peter Parker, one of Tony's coworkers, was walking in.
Again, he decided that cleaning the floor and tables was the best route to go and began doing so.
"I do too, but this is also a good lesson for him to learn, as much as I hate to admit it. It's good for him to realize that there are times where things just come up and plans can't always happen; even though I would have liked just as much for him to have been able to go." Tony shrugs, huffing a bit at himself for turning this into a life lesson.
"Do you think we'll see mermaids there?" Peter excitedly asks. Tony quickly realized his mistake and exchanged a look with Steve, both of them trying to figure out how to respond without dulling Peter's imagination.
It took a while before Tony’s brain caught up. All day he had thought that Steve was asking someone else out and all along it had been him? Steve wanted to date
Maybe he could even call Rhodey up and force him to wallow with him. His reasoning sure was good enough for it and seemed pitiful enough, he probably really could coerce Rhodey into it.
He quickly pulled it out to see that it was a folded-up note.
Soon after, all three of them went ring shopping while Pepper kept Tony busy at work, and both Rhodey and Peter helped him pick out the ring that they all felt Tony would love the most.
"Wha-What makes you ask that? How do you even know about that?" Tony stammers.
“There, there, easy, Little Iron Man,” laughed the werewolf, his voice now warmer and less cavernous now that he had shifted into human form.
In the morning Tony lazes around in the bed, and Steve draws him. It’s too early to have breakfast. Tony watches Steve with heavy-lidded eyes, and his lips curl. He moves under the thin white sheet, and stretches like a cat, sighing, eyes fluttering close for a few seconds, arching his back. His legs pull at the sheet, making it pool down his stomach. Tony watches Steve as this last shakes his head in disapproval -how is he supposed to draw him if Tony keeps moving every few minutes?-, and then he smiles. He’s caressing himself now, fingers tracing undetermined patterns on his skin, skipping over his nipples, tracing down his happy trail, wrapping around his half-hard member. He watches Steve as he starts stroking himself.
“Please come home with me. I’m not asking for a repeat, but please let me gift you that drawing. As a thanks. You’ve done a lot for me, Mr Stark, and I want to thank you properly.”
They started munching on the cake, which was very good despite now being cold, and as Steve took a sip of the wine, Tony smiled and finally answered;
After a few years, it came to pass that the fairy appeared again, though she did not appear to Joseph, but to a young man who was traveling from village to village. He was, as it were, lost in the dark woods. He had been warned that the dark woods weren’t the same as the light woods, that in one dwelt an evil sorcerer while the other was the home of the good witch, but Tony, as he was called, had always been a little pig-headed, and for all that his mind was brilliant, he was also a bit of a scatterbrain.
. Something he
“I have no idea who’s Bucky,” tries Tony, a tentative smile on his lips.
Steve had tried though, but there hadn’t been much time to talk things out. Tony had shaken everything off as if all was well -but it wasn’t. Trust had been broken, and Steve could see that Tony wasn’t allowing him to try and gain his trust back.
“Then I will have to wait for your wish to change, and see if it is a wish I can grant,” replied Jan, with a ‘I know you’re diverting but I’ll let it slide’ look he was used to see in Pepper and Rhodey’s eyes. “It wouldn’t be the first time, you know. People’s desires do not last forever, and they change over time.”
Sarah could never heal from the grief of losing her only child, and every day for many years Joseph would return to the forest calling for the fairy. But the fairy never came, and he had to renounce to see his child ever again.
“Bucky’s my best friend and roommate,” explains Steve. “He’s my only family. We enrolled together, and he lost his arm in the war.”
Steve’s breath quickens. He feels himself hardening, too.
! I know you mean well, but… do you have any idea what I go through every time I see him? I can’t. I
“What do you want, then? I’m not going to apologize. I was right about the Accords, and you weren’t. I’m not going to bulge on that. I’m tired of always being told I’m wrong, especially when I’m not.”
“I’ve heard of the sickness that fell upon your son, dear Joseph,” answered the fairy. “Your wife and your son are the kindest souls, and they do not deserve grief nor death. In this garden are enchanted rampions. They can save your child. But make no mistake, Joseph. If the sorcerer living here catches you, he will have no mercy for you.”
“Tony? Are you alright?” was saying Steve, looking at him with worry in his eyes.
“I need to go,” he said, his voice breaking, and he repeated; “I need to go.”
Steve doesn’t. He draws him just like that, fingering himself, the sheet wrapped around his calves. And Tony waits for him, maddeningly beautiful as he brings himself closer to the edge and then teases himself back down, never pushing himself over. When Steve puts down his piece of charcoal, Tony isn’t the only one leaking steadily. Steve puts on a condom in a hurry, joins him in the bed, rolls him over on his stomach, pressing him into the mattress, devouring his back with kisses. Tony watches him from the corner of his one visible eye, half his face buried in the pillow. Steve enters him easily -he’s so loose, so lax, so slick- and fucks into him slowly.
were you?” he retorted.
He could fill in the rest easily without needing to ask him. The guilt, the stress, the break-up with Pepper, the migraine from the use of the BARF machine - all that explained Tony’s aggressive and short-tempered behavior from back then, so different from his usual cocky-upbeat-genius one Steve had grown so fond of-.
The werewolf trotted next to him, sniffing the basket and licking its chops.
“You’re… a
“I like it,” says Tony. “The music’s great, and they have mean mocktails.”
Tony looked at him indignantly.
Tony squeezed his big wicker basket against his chest, breathing in deeply the comforting smell of the pastry inside. It was his mother’s best recipe of
There were once a woman and a man who had long, in vain, wished for a child. At length it appeared that God was about to grant their desire. Those were terrible times to have a child, for illnesses had spread through the lands and reached even their isolated village. When the woman finally gave birth, the unfortunate baby was born frail and sickly. His parents were scared he would die, but the child grew up through all the epidemics, until finally the sickness had left the land.
“I’ll explain,” said Steve, gently. “That’s why I wanted to have a talk with you.”
“Fuck you! You think I have no idea? You think you’re the only precious snowflake on this Earth who’s got depression? Fuck you, Rogers! I got depression when I was twenty-one, asshole, and all thanks to your best pals Howard and fuckin’ BUCKY! I was studying aboard, because I had already graduated from MIT, at seventeen, you know, that’s so sane for a kid, and then your fuckin’ boyfriend came along and offed my mom, and dad, and I was left alone at the head of Stark Industries, with dear Obie as some kind of regent, and we all know how much Obie really loved me! I was
“I… I’m not going to stay forever at your village,” said Tony, suddenly, his throat closing up in unexpected sadness. “My work there will probably end in a couple of days.”
“Ah, ah, right here, here, here, here,” gasps Tony, and Steve’s grip on his hips tighten, he keeps the angle and lets himself go.
“Well, you were thinking of me, weren’t you?” she said, and then her smile wavered. “Are you feeling better? You were so pale, before.”
“Yes, that drawing,” he says, unwavering.
“A het?” repeats Most Gorgeous. His voice is unfairly smooth, too.
“Jan! Jan!” he called as he entered the forest.
“Good evening, son,” she said.
“Ah, the tub isn’t… the tub isn’t big enough for two,” groaned Steve, hands moving to his belt. He paused, freed his face from Tony’s ministrations so as to look at him in the eyes. “You okay with this, right?”
His former teammate looked frail and small without his Iron Man armor. Vulnerable. Steve jogged to catch him up, noticing the way Tony’s shoulders tensed.
Tony smiles. Steve thinks back to all the fake smiles he’s seen him throw to the others, and can’t help but notice the one he’s been offered seems genuine. He feels himself warming up to the guy.
“Thank you,” says Tony. “I
Tony turned over, showing his back to him, and started walking away. However, he only made it a few steps before he stopped, saying in a voice so low that it took Steve’s enhanced hearing to catch it;
. Yeah, I’m the tinkerer. Tony. Nice to meet you.”
“Yes,” said Tony, his mouth full with bread and cheese.
’, that made the haze dissipate, and the nice boneless feeling left suddenly, replaced by shards of ice splintering through his bones as Tony remembered exactly
“Hey. So what’s a het doing here?”
Steve kissed him back, one hand taking hold of Tony’s wrists and pulling them off his shirt, and the other skillfully unbuckling his belt and untying his underclothes, and then a warm palm pressed against his half-hard sex, fingers teasingly threading through his pelvic hair. Tony buckled against him, and Steve pushed back, until Tony could feel the edge of the bathtub digging against his back. He moaned in Steve’s mouth, tongue curling around his, as Steve lowered his captured hands down to his own crotch.
“Ah, sure, sure, darling. Okay. I wasn’t going to stay here for much longer, anyway.”
“He wasn’t that loud,” muttered Steve. “And we went to bed pretty early!”
“The wiki didn’t mention anything about that. Is it okay… is it okay to tell me?”
And then again, Tony’s face morphed into an enraged one, and he spat out, voice icy cold and full of venom;
Steve’s fingers teased his nipple again, and lightening ran through Tony’s spine once more, causing a moan to rush out of his mouth. The thumb on his lips slipped between his parted lips, and Tony’s tongue immediately wrapped around the digit.
Steve has a fleeting thought about Bucky, wonders if he’s already home and if he’s cursing Steve to oblivion, because as Steve adds finger after finger, Tony’s moans get louder and higher, until suddenly he’s pulling on Steve’s hair, pulling his mouth off him.
Sorry folks, no sexy times in the first chapter! But I can promise you that there will be some in all the following chapters. I hope you enjoyed nonetheless this introduction to the story and characters. I chose "young side-kick Robin-looking" Bucky instead of the usual "Steve's childhood friend and Winter Soldier" Bucky, and put in Arnie, who is in the comics, indeed gay and the one who protected Steve in his childhood. I haven't quite decided who the Good Witch is supposed to be yet (I originally wanted her to be Wanda, but decided against it), so let me know if you have some ideas. Who would you like to see as the Good Witch?
“About that, Tony, you smelled tense and worried before you saw me and started playing. And you didn’t even warn me we were playing. What was on your mind?”
“Not you too,” he groans as Tony laughs.
Peggy was right: while Tony Stark is now rather absent from the public eye, he is a well-known figure in the higher circles, which means more rich people would follow his lead and get interested in Steve’s art.
“Natural tease, huh?” retorts Steve, his breath short and his knees weakening.
And then the mocking smile on his face extended, and he laughed: “Did you get
Still, Most Gorgeous looks affronted and his shoulders tense up even more.
“Hi,” he said to the little figure.
Jan evaded his hand and flew away, this time landing on Butterhooves’ head, right between her long, plushy, twitchy ears. Butterhooves blinked, and looked at Tony with her doe eyes. Tony knew that look very well.
The sorcerer looked at the rampion in his hand and then back at Joseph, looking surprised for a second, and then his surprise was replaced by a pleased, calculating glare. He said;
“Tony, please. I don’t want to fight.”
“You’re the one who said he didn’t want the sex.”
A tall tower was standing in the middle of the glade, its slate roof shining under the midday sun. The tower had neither stairs nor door, but near the top was a little window. The singing that so deeply touched Tony’s heart came from that window. He dismounted Dummy and let his mules graze in the bushes, while he sat on a rock, examining the tower and trying to spot an entrance.
Steve’s hands wander around, opening up Tony’s coat, pulling at his scarf, popping open the buttons of the sexy maroon shirt that was already not buttoned up enough. Tony’s body is warm and firm, and he shivers as Steve’s fingers, cold from outside, trail over his bare skin.
“Shh yourself,” snickers Tony, taping his fingers on Steve’s lips, and then he licks Steve’s palm.
“There is…” started again Tony, slowly. “There are only two times I ever, consciously, wanted to kill someone. The first time was in Afghanistan. I… I was the Merchant of Death, you know, but technically, I hadn’t killed anyone. Not with my bare hands. I came back from Afghanistan as Iron Man. But I also came back as a murderer. I burnt to the ground the place I was kept in, and I don’t regret it.”
“Will you be fine if I let you go?”
. You should warn a guy, seriously, Stevie!”
From the corner of his eye, he could see Tony deflating, his shoulders slumping, a deep sigh leaving him.
“They like being all dramatic.”
“A partner,” sneered Tony. He still couldn’t look up.
Tony calms down. It’s a very sudden quiet that falls on him, and Steve is worried he said too much, that he overstepped. But Tony breathes in deeply, sighs, and then says, voice back to normal;
“That’s alright.” Soothing. The voice was so soothing. Hell, he’d missed JARVIS. Why had he gone away again? “Your GPS locator is on. I can track you. I’ll be with you shortly.”
“Well…let’s put it this way.” The stool screeched against the floor again-Tom was getting up. The swinging light from the bulb reflected in his irises. “I saved your life.”
Everybody was slowly tramping off the stage, fishing out handkerchiefs to mop the sweat across their brows, rolling their shoulders and flexing their legs experimentally. Except-and Steve’s heart liberated itself in a tiny leap-Tony was climbing the stairs back up again, a stack of little green cards peeking out from his left fist. He was-oh
“So you think,” T’Challa began slowly. “That after our people had our rarest, most precious mineral stolen from us to fashion weapons- we’re just going to hand over about…eight hundred pounds of it to you?”
Today, though. Today. Today the blip had moved, too far from upstate New York- and somehow Steve could picture in terrifying detail as the plastic flip-phone was finally thrown into a waste bin and collected by trucks and shipped out of the Facility and
.wk. Well, that was an…interesting address. Tony caught his teeth pressing a little too tightly against his gums, and released the pressure immediately- eyes flicking to the rest of the details. No subject. Single attachment.
For all of his vendettas against ancient implements, there was something ineffably peaceful about the sound of pencil scratching against paper, soft and rhythmic. It was practically Tony’s lullaby at this point – head sinking into goosedown, closed eyelids limned orange with the afternoon sun, and the sound of Steve labouring patiently at his artist’s pad; a source of steady warmth at Tony’s side. A steady
This: the comfort, the familiarity, the ease-Tony threw his head back, veins straining against his sweat-damp neck, and Steve felt the knife slice through his heart, quick and easy-the
His heart sped impossibly, the room seeming too tiny all of a sudden. Fuck, he really should have knocked out that kitchen wall when he had the time last spring. The jam jars continued to stand recriminatingly on the counter.
“You…you have..” Sam was apparently finding it difficult to breathe, what with all the inexplicable mirth. “Eclectic tastes.”
Parts of Steve could still feel the serum kicking away, fighting desperately in its last stretches –
Cold, unfeeling blue. “Of course.”
But perhaps the only thing stranger than living life as a slice of self-aware bread, was doing it with
The minutest flinch, at the name. Stark didn’t appear outwardly anxious, but there was a tightness to his sentences and movements. “He’s…there was another cave in. During the evac. Rhodey…got out but Rogers is still-”
“Sokovia, actually.” Natasha’s expression didn’t change, worn out yet implacable. “She chose to side with Hydra. Started off this whole ‘clusterfuck’.”
God, he missed her.
“With my childhood history, you’d think I’d have gotten over it…but.” A little laugh, and Stark seemed to have snapped out of his little delirium. Except for his unreadable eyes. “I didn’t do much wrong, except for the crime of not being Captain America.”
Well, Steve thought, closing the lid of the bent laptop as far as it would go, plunging the room into darkness. Cool, dispassionate. Maybe Stark had a point when he said that some superheroes couldn’t be trusted to make the right decisions for themselves after all.
…but it didn’t really matter, did it? Steve turned, slow and unhurried, hands burying themselves in his pockets again. His shoes padded softly against the asphalt as he walked, navigating around spilled food and fallen banners from the White Night celebrations. A night of living, they called it.
Of course, what he also should have done in the past was let “genius billionaire playboy philanthropist” and “isn’t that why we fight? So we can end the fight and go home?” and “we need to be put in check” roll off his back. But he’d stepped up, shoulders pulled back and teeth bared, each and every time.
“Not that I don’t mentally note it down every time you say stuff like that–” Peter straightened up noticeably, smile broadening till it went from charming to no-one-panic-but-we’ve-got-a-DEFCON-5, “but I’m going to have to ask you to save it for the toast. Which you’re making right now.”
“I don’t think Mr. Stark much cares to make friends anymore.”
Two things swept over him immediately: the heat, and the noise. The air was muggy, weighed down by the Australian summer and the warm breaths of the Melburnian youth that had taken to the streets that night. If he shaded his brows with his hand and squinted, he could see a thousand people tracking their way through St. Kilda Road towards the gallery, easy.
” Down came the coffee mug- and then another, and another, ceramic and porcelain shattering to smithereens on the cold workshop floor. Another swipe, and the bits and bobs and tools went flying off the desks, clattering to the concrete in a horrendous racket that could wake the dead. The holograms kept flickering weakly in the background.
His ears were ringing. Or maybe it was their footsteps, staggering yet resolute, slowly fading away.
and Tony sees Steph’s shoulders pull tight, the muscles in her neck strain, her face close off.
Steph looks up, hollow blue eyes fixing on him.
“I didn’t see him tonight.” Sam didn’t lose a single beat, voice maintained at the same, even cadence. There wasn’t much eye contact to be established, when you couldn’t see the other person’s eyes. “Or you. The helmet…hides more than it-”
Anybody else, and Tony would’ve mocked ‘
Steve opened his mouth. “Who are you.”
Please
“Nah.” Sam waved the question off carelessly, but his thumb fidgeted with the base of the beer can. Steve proceeded to array his features into what his friends called the ‘Captain-America-slash-Concerned-Dad’ look (well, only one person ever called it that, but Tony wasn’t arou-); and Sam breathed out a soft puff of amusement in response.
It is in the little things. Natasha’s surprised blink when Steve brings her a peanut butter sandwich, the hollow silence when he curses on the comms and no one chimes the L-word back at him.
“Truth be told, I’m still not seeing where the worry is coming from, here.” Tony unfroze his muscles with purposeful deliberation, and proceeded to turn off the stove. “I’m being positively angelic here. Isn’t that how adults are supposed to behave?”
Tony nudged the shoulder next to his, gently. Not quite forties-style handsy comfort, but it would do in a pinch. His mouth quirked up, a softened version of the smirks he doled out all too easily. “You
Sometimes he’d raise his head, elbow propped and chin resting on his knuckles, watching the rises and swoops of the pencil with dream-heavy eyes. It was hypnotising, watching that hand deftly guide the graphite in seemingly random motions, blind to the design that was emerging on the paper in the background. It seemed almost unimportant; until those fingers lifted and Tony’s eyes cleared, like the image had suddenly come into focus and revealed itself to be a masterpiece of chiaroscuro.
“The first time I…the first time I thought of you like…” Steve trailed off, but Tony needed no clarifications. “When we were in the bathroom at that kebab place. You wanted to find things in common between us, and the first thing we agreed on was that we both liked being good at things.”
When he turned his head to the side, minutes later, Tom was looking at him, steady and assuring. “You do good things, Captain Rogers.”
“You sure?” Natasha mocked, and the affection of it was raw salt and soothing balm all at once. “You’ve been looking pretty bummed lately. Maybe you should go back to bed, rest those old, creaky joints.”
. Tony flapped his hand again, but this time to fan himself a little. “You think Carol would let me borrow hers? I have this hunch that Steve wants to see me in military fancy dress, but won’t raise the topic for fear of Disrespecting the Nation.”
The TV is on and running in the communal space, and Tony usually isn’t given to agreeing with the wisdom of the common public, but he’ll agree to this-goddamn, is it an idiot box. The only reason he stops is because he hears his name (and no, that isn’t narcissistic, it’s bloody human nature so shut your trap Romanoff. Even though she isn’t technically here. He supposes it’s a little disturbing that he has a mental Romanoff voice now).
The reactor dug into Steve’s sternum, a circle of glowing warmth. It felt nice.
,” Steve had to reduce his register to a whisper, but it was still rather irate for all of that, “-and she’s working for the government, and the two of us having any kind of contact could lead to suspicion falling on her and massive consequences.”
Steve pressed his lips together, bloodless in the rain. His hair was plastered to his skull, darkened and ashy, water scoring rivulets down gaunt cheeks. Sparse stubble stood out on a tight jaw, murky over paper-white skin, as did sunken eye sockets. He didn’t respond.
Two figures- red and blue, red and gold. Sparks flying in all directions as the shield caught the full force of the repulsors- Steve could still recall the faint sense memory of the metal warmed by battle shuddering under the pressure in his hands. He could remember every move as it played out in horrible definition on the screen- every blow flung, every desperate parry, every harsh pant, every groan of pain. What he couldn’t recall was the visceral imagery of it all- he’d never been in the position to observe, caught in a battle for friendship and loyalty, betrayal and vengeance. He hadn’t gotten to pause and see the cold Siberian sun gleam off titanium alloy, the burnished leather strapped over dark Kevlar, the hard sheen of arm plates.
Did Stark practice saying these words in a mirror? Flung them out, blunt and masterfully crafted, to curve back on himself and inflict the maximum amount of pain that it was possible for a human man to bear, and a lot more besides.
The Stones followed, five throbbing points settling below his knuckles. They still felt lighter than the phantom weight of an arc reactor, chest-warm and leaden in his palm.
“Slowly.” The voice said. The glass moved away, and Steve tasted after it, tongue flickering out futilely in the dry air. “Don’t move too much.”
“Penny for your thoughts?” It had gotten easier to read amusement in those eyes, over the years. Or maybe she’d just gotten better at showing it.
Steve stared back at Tony, at the hard, flashing eyes that seemed right out of a memory and a nightmare, but he couldn’t move his tongue to speak.
His body was stiff enough as it was, or Steve would have stiffened further. None of those facial features were ringing any bells. He’d never seen this man before, not even in old SHIELD records or photographs, or something grey and blurry in the newspaper. And unlike most people, Steve could be completely sure about that.
Tony’s impassive features provided no answer.
After he’s said his goodbyes, Natasha follows him back to his room.
Another nasty twist. “And Iron Man. Can’t forget about Iron Man.”
was the first thing to strike his head. The man wasn’t very tall, maybe five feet eight, or nine at most, not enough to loom over the bedside. He was broad though-with wide shoulders, thick, sloping arms and a round-ish face. Strong nose, smooth chin under thick lips, set against dark skin and darker eyes. His black brows arched high on a curved forehead, sweat gleaming against the hairline-the hair itself short and black, bristle-like.
Pitch black like Tom’s, now that he thought about it. Steve raised his eyes to meet Tom’s stare, that regard too perceptive by half. It was…he felt pared through, scraped over.
He could hear his own voice, barely above a murmur. “How many hostiles?”
The clock in the dining hall ticked, what sounded like rats scrabbled in the walls. Peter’s voice was noticeably more timid when he voiced, “New doodads?”
“It’s…less about winning,” and Tony wanted to cut him off immediately, but Steve so rarely begun new threads of conversation. It seemed important, somehow, to wait this one out. Pink lips flickered, pressing on themselves momentarily before continuing. “And more about being…good,” and cue eyeroll, no, bad Tony,
It’s a hand written page, smuggled in among the glossy pictures and official documents.
, that totally violates the law of conservation of mass by the way- and god, Mr Stark. Can’t we meet in the Avengers facility the next time?” Archimedes almighty, those wheedling eyes. The joy and the excitement when Peter babbled, it made denying him incredibly difficult. “I mean, your world and mine, it’s just……it’s just so small, you know?”
Agent Sixty Seven smiled at him dutifully, not an errant incisor to be seen, not even a mismanaged facial muscle. “This way please.”
“Nah.” Tony said, and didn’t bother to smile in reassurance. But this wasn’t a lie. It wasn’t a lie. “Nah, I’m good.”
Except the man in the dark leather suit standing in the field, face lifted to the sky.
Suffice to say-Sam had never quite been one to turn to the Almighty for assistance. (The seventeen hours straight spent in a chapel when Riley was still…struggling in intensive care didn’t count. Religion wasn’t meant to be just for crises. Otherwise it wasn’t religion.)
The paper crinkled between his fingers. Crease marks ran along the crumpled surface indiscriminately- lines as fine and spindly as spider webs, spanning the careful, neatly inked words on the page. The paper looked years old, stained yellow by exposure. It wasn’t. It would be completing six months today.
When the words came, they weren’t what he expected. “You’ve watched the footage from New York.”
“Tony, I…I am so sorry.”
Regardless. When your best friend is Russian, you pick up a few words-and his oft-remarked on idiocy set aside, Clint had a decent knack for languages. It was an almost conscious effort on his part though…not to pick up more than was minimal and necessary to get by on. He didn’t want to lose this. This hypnotism at feeling the words roll over him with and without meaning. Taking both him and Natasha to a place they’d never been, in their own ways. Childhood.
ambushed on site and had ample time to head back to base to put on that suit I pay for.” Huh, maybe it wasn’t that hard to argue with him after all.
“And you can stop looking for your shield too.” Steve’s roving eyes stilled, memory clapping him in place. He…he wasn’t really….he
“And he’s renowned for these kind of things, you know. Standing up for the little guy. Fighting against bullies.” Stark’s lips curve up, just the slightest. “He’s done it his whole life, and isn’t being hypocritical about it. And he seems reasonable, and fair, and just, and noble, and people listen to him, and understand his concerns, and marshal under his name, and change happens…and. And. Maybe there’s even a guy called Tony Stark who’s fucking
“You planning on standing there all afternoon like a creeper, Tones?”
A breath, brushing past the stillness. Like conviction finally emerging again, settling into its long-worn shoes.
“That,” Tony began, soft and quiet. “Might almost be touching, Rogers. I might have almost believed it too.” He rose to his feet, silhouette limned in orange by the setting sun- like a man on fire. His eyes were the darkest counterpoints. “If you hadn’t physically beaten me aside the last time I had the
He didn’t look like he’d gone on an odd forty-hour bender for science, choosing to forego sleep. He looked like he’d stumbled for hours and hours in its search and sleep had shut the door in his face.
“Of course.” It was like the affirmative words were falling out, one after the other, tripping out from Steve’s tongue- but they didn’t mean anything. “I’m…I’m sorry Sam.”
Same, Tony thought. Same, same. Or maybe since when he was four, and learned how to talk. It was so difficult to define what ‘on my own’ meant.
Steve watches, the warmth of the sun beating down his arms and back. He has a feeling Minsk is pretty nice this time of year too.
Tony laid his head on his arms, closed his eyes, and drifted off into dreamless sleep.
“Allow me to help.”
Steve generally regarded himself as a rather patient man. Sure, he liked excitement as much as the next guy- his career choice was kind of a blaring signal on that front. But he’d always hoped….well, back during the war, his fantasies had always taken on a very particular form. Peace. Something like prosperity. Contentment, perhaps?
“So I could say I’ve been selfish and that I regret it – but this is just more of the same. More selfishness. What I…” Steve’s mouth moved soundlessly, helplessly, seconds on end. “..want. And I want to. I just want to
No judgement. Yet Steve found himself being judged anyway.
Tony felt his jaw drop ever so slightly. Yeah. Yeah, that was exactly what he’d meant. He’d seen what the kid could do, but it was one thing to see a red-and-blue figure in spandex climbing up skyscrapers; another thing entirely to see Peter Parker act as if gravity was a mere suggestion, as though physics could take his permission to start behaving normally again. He didn’t blink as Peter hung upside down from the ceiling and swiped something out of the chest, then descend carefully with a triumphant grin pulling at the corners of his lips.
much louder than his usual volume, but it was like a ripple effect: the clusters of people around him immediately quietened down, and forty seconds in, Tony was counting, the entire hall was hushed and staring at him. It was scary, almost. Humbling.
The torturous half-curve reappeared, a smile that didn’t know what else to do. “An hour in, Peg came after me. Her gloves didn’t fit well, she was pulling ‘em off the second she walked in.” Steve was staring into the distance, hazy blue drawing a picture he knew so well. “Wearing her old coat too – the third button sat wonky, and you could see the fraying threads if you looked real close. It was how I knew she’d dressed in a hurry – Peggy always looked impeccable.”
, and Clint, angry and resentful, but still
“The kid isn’t going anywhere near this.” Not near people deprived of all hope, crushed under rock and bars. People that stayed alive long enough to die just before you extended a hand to save them. Was it cruel and narcissistic and loathsome to even think that? Yeah, yeah it was. But Tony wasn’t feeling very well inclined towards the world today. Not with the decisions it was making. Not with the ones it was forcing him to make. “You know who I’m talking about.”
the repressed anguish outlined in every stark line of his face, he’d gone through so much, only to be persecuted again and again and
And there it was- the elephant in the room. Or the teenager, in this case. Tony.
Alex – no, nope. This was an excessive reaction. He was excessing. Remember Pepper. He was zen. Zen was him. The game music wasn’t playing anymore, why was the stupid, peppy game music not playing anymore, Steeeeeeve–
His yell seemed to have the intended consequences – Steve Rogers straightened up from where he’d been crouching and peering past a toppled iron-wrought table, face brightening when he glimpsed Iron Man. Clad in a sky-blue tee, and a pair of chinos of all things, he picked himself up and jogged across to Tony; head bare enough to get wet should it rain, and no fucking Kevlar, and definitely not a shield,
“I will miss you Tony.”
There was a break there- a second of quiet that almost weighed heavier than anything Steve had been struggling with for the past few months: undercut sharply when Clint dropped the instruments in his hand with a clatter; light, piercing eyes that unerringly found their mark each and every time fixating on Steve’s face.
Because this was just like him, wasn’t it? Even while donating millions of dollars to impoverished students, and ways to help people get over mental trauma (maybe he’d have showed it to Steve, one day, and then he’d be able to have that last dance with Peggy at the Stork Clu-), he was still baring his vulnerabilities in their faces. Look, I made a way to deal with things people would rather not deal with. I’ll show it to you by publically displaying the last, tainted memory I had with my parents. Look, I have a chest full of shrapnel clawing its way right to my heart. I’m putting a bright, shining light right over it. So you know exactly where to hi-
There was another video listed on the sidebar, from a couple of months ago. Steve’s fingers guided the mouse, almost unfeelingly- he needed something older. Something reminiscent of better, livelier times.
A well-crafted pause, an incisive gaze darting upwards.
“And when we managed to take the big guy down…you could’ve done that. Flown over, stopped them from getting into the jet. But the first thing you did…” Peter stopped to exhale a breath. He didn’t look embarrassed now. Just certain. “The first thing you did, was land and check up on me. To see if I was doing okay.”
Natasha pressed her lips together. She released them on a soundless exhale, and he could feel her eyes trace his face. Her voice didn’t waver, words simplistic. “Why are you mad at me?”
Thank you again- for all the support, all the words of appreciation. You guys make me proud to be an Avengers and a Stony fan, and I hope the ride was just as great for you as it was for me.
Something tightened in his throat. Sam cleared it-inescapably loud even over Steve’s rustling and the quiet hum of the plane. “We…ah. We working on Vision’s intel again?”
It’s like a face shifting from the shade into the light; the gratitude moving over Tony’s features.
“And OsCorp is a better fit. I get it.” Tony could feel the smile stretching across his face, a fraying elastic band threatening to snap back to its original state at any second. He could feel the letter bunched up in the pocket of his slacks, paper rubbing roughly against the smooth cloth.
A touch of warmth – Steve’s hand had risen to curl around his left shoulder, broad palm holding him steady. Tony pressed back into the touch, eyes shutting briefly.
Play.
“And now I’m telling you I don’t, anymore.” Tony replied, gently. “Not that I don’t require your assistance. I’d be flying dead without you. But during downtime, unless I actively ask you for something- I’m asking you to gather some really important data for me, instead of shepherding my daily activities. Can you do that?”
and Iron Man hadn’t been using....any part of his arsenal except the repulsors to even remind him of the fatal strategic errors he was committing.
“This is how you’re gonna die!” He bellowed, voice modulator screeching with feedback, repulsors cutting off as his boots hit the plastic grass.
“Or.” Ross parsed out, slow and thoughtful. “We make an example of one of the richest, most powerful men in the world. Successfully incarcerate
“It isn’t safe.” T’Challa repeated, slow and measured.
Tony blinked.
“I.” Steve felt the words wrestle in his throat, let the true ones come out instead. “I’d like to think so.”
“Lila.” Sam voiced, quiet and considerate. Another lightning-in-a-bottle smile. “Hey, we all make our sacrifices. Don’t beat yourself over the head for it.”
“I mean, not for-I don’t live there anymore it’s just-it’ll be good for your career. Probably.”
A flash of confusion furrowing Tony’s brows at the words, followed swiftly by realisation. And weighted words.
Three steps away from the Mark I, and mini-missiles took to the air; hissing over his head and leaving smoke trails as they embedded themselves into the weapons systems of at least five suits along the wall, avoiding him entirely. A targeting system that prioritised weaponised threats over living signatures – smart in its design, buggy in execution.
Tony smiled, quick and painless. “To remind me that it wasn’t worth it.”
“So I am sorry. That I had a part to play in letting you think, even for a second, that disappointment was the best you could do.”
“So you’re telling me,” Sam began slowly, voice growing more despairing by the second, “that the entire city’s thrown a party, and you’re in a
“Outta here, I got that.” Deep, full breaths. In and out. “Why can’t I contact Steve?”
or goddamn Americans.”
The smile grew wider. “Swando.”
Peter, for his part, looked back at him with steady dark eyes like he’d heard anything else other than a man in his forties concocting nonsense out of bullshit. Then, without a sound, he pressed a hand to the surface of the wall he’d just slid hopelessly down against, and began crawling up the surface like his feet were magnets.
century. Perfectly round, smelt of iron. Concentric yellow rings, in a gold-silver alloy stood out against the dark brown surface. There was a circle of yellow at the centre, which bloomed outwards to outline shapely petals, with darker, intricate engravings spanning the corolla. The tips of the petals tapered out to burst into spindly, flawless patterns embroidering the petals of another, larger flower pattern. It went round and round, brown and gold curling into themselves, petal growing to petal.
They laughed.
To Steve.
Several more seconds of scrabbling at the knob and the door finally wrenched open with a bang and a shower of crumbled plaster, squealing hinges adding to the din. Tony stepped through into the white-tiled, dingy cubicle of a bathroom, the tiny window at the far end showing nothing but the tall walls of the neighbouring building, barely letting any light in. He knuckled around for the light switch and flicked it on, the bulb above his head flickering to life with a quiet crackle. The washbasin was barely a foot away, and it was another struggle of effort to open the tap, the packing nut and washer flaked over with jagged lines of rust.
“I could… I could do it again. Here.” Work at it, at belonging to this time again. It couldn’t hurt as much, couldn’t claw at his throat with the hollowness of it more than the first go around. “With you.”
It seemed like seconds till he landed again-wet sand crunching fitfully under his heels. Gigantic blocks of sandstone and basalt cast shadows down on the beach, looming up on either side of the sheltered bay. The ocean gleamed silver behind his back, and grey sand spread forward in miles before his toes, reaching the black walls where moonlight gleamed slickly off the mossy, sea-sprayed rock. It was deathly silent, but for the lap of the water. His comm was quiet-Steve wasn’t making a peep. The line seemed switched off.
“No bug and roach life detected…there’s barely even any bacteria.” Iron Man confirmed tonelessly. He was moving to the far left of the room, light getting smaller and more distant. “It’s unnatural. There was definitely something here.”
Cool, level, an android’s tones. “Captain Rogers?”
“Hiding secrets, asking no one for help, sacrificing yourself at every turn. I thought you’d stay this way forever. Until…the Accords.” And all for that Tony’s eyes were still fixed on that grey concrete, he could feel Rhodey’s gaze at the side of his face, willing him to look. “You discussed, and you negotiated. Argued and implored. Pulled every fucking trick you had, gave everything you could. Called in favours, bribed officials, made every promise. The guy who gave his address to a terrorist refused to fight till the last, possible second. Because the stakes were too high. Because your team needed you, even if none of them knew it. And you came through, and you did everything in your power to hold them together even if the world wanted to tear you apart.”
and down they came, him and the suit, catching the floor harshly on his knees. His mouth tasted blood, his chest screaming bloody murder. Not enough, the suit was dead weight. He needed something to support it.
“Trust is sometimes an impulse, Captain. And sometimes, it’s a choice.”
“I dunno.” Steve didn’t hesitate with his smile. Everything about that face, the voice, demeanour…so forthright. So open. Fuck, this was worse than the memory Tony was trying to rewrite each night. “Family, stability…guy who wanted that went in the ice seventy five years ago. I think someone else came out.”
“Wifi permitting, of course.” Sam conspicuously paused, shades of seriousness seeping into his tone. “You gonna be alright, yeah?”
He was staring at some indiscriminate spot on the floor, face wiped, harsh LED backlighting his head and casting shadows on his hands. He was blinking every three or so seconds- and some distant, mindless part of Steve noted that it was almost odd to see his face in shadow (
“I am sorry, but I must excuse myself. A rather urgent matter has come up, and I must fly out of Wakanda immediately.” For all of said urgency, T’Challa was as still and stoic as stone. “Forgive my poor hospitality, I and the Wakandan people would love to avail ourselves of the opportunity to entertain you better at a later date.”
Ah, the inappropriate joke reflex. Nice to see you finally kick in.
But Iron Man might have laughed, harsh and staticky. Or worse still, he might not have laughed at all. He might have pretended-continued pretending-to be a hollow metal shell, with no man inside.
“All access all the way.” There was something magical about the reactions of people, mostly the non-SI employees, when they walked into a corporate elevator and saw that they were going to be riding it with a large mechanical arm. Tony sometimes went through the clips before going to bed – his current favourite was a harried mom with her kid headed for the childcare on the 14
Constant, unaffected. But he ended up sounding like a fucking bitter old man anyway.
“Circumstances have changed since then.” There was something distant about the words.
“I’ve been told.” Tony fixed his eyes on a patch of wall, tone listless. It was okay. Rhodey deserved his chance at sharp words too.
. “I’ll think about it.”
“Very well.” T’Challa said, and stood up. “I’ll have it shipped over to your facility by the end of this month.” He turned around, meeting apparently concluded, prepared to leave.
and Steve suddenly felt aflame with it, the
, caught in the fuzzy reflection in the plates; Tony whirled around, thundering heart and wrists taut in the reflexive gesture that summoned the latest suit.
“It’s my genuine pleasure, boss.” FRIDAY sounded warm. She sounded…..pleased. Some days, her extremely enhanced emotional capacity, and lack of reluctance to display that emotion scared him. Today was not one of those days.
“Alright then, Cap.” And there it was, that nickname again. It was almost mindboggling to see the number of places and times it popped up when Steve actually paid mind to it. But Clint was the focus here- his plain, non-nonsense, outright
This wasn’t like taking on a team of thugs without his armour, or even a half-constructed ULTRON bot. This was Tony’s design. The Mark VII wouldn’t falter if Tony stuck a screwdriver in its grooves, there were no convenient latches to pull a gauntlet free if he got within range. The armour was devastating at close range, and lethal from a distance. There wasn’t… there had to be a way out of this. Right?
“Alright. So hypothesise with me, here-” And had Stark even been trying, at all? Staying inside the shell-or had it suffocated him so much within the past months that he’d gladly toss it aside, let it crumble at the slightest pressure. Or maybe Sam was being facetious and this pressure wasn’t anything remotely resembling slight.
Of course, he didn’t say any of that. Except a muted, “Me too,” and the responding spark in Steve’s eyes let him know that no more would be required either.
“Well, Barton is every nursery rhyme ever.” Tony says, because if he were a dwarf, he’d be called Meanie. He’s doing no one any favours by constantly making light of something Cap is trying to consciously share. He can’t seem to stop himself.
“Did…did you know?”
“My friend got out.” Steve wasn’t aware of the words until they struck his eardrums, rebounding off the grey walls. “But there was-”
“The installation is a couple of miles to the west, on the nearby atoll.” And while a part of Sam’s mind was paying attention to War Machine’s words plowing through the stagnant air; a bigger part still caught on Steve’s jaw clicking shut, on the dull
“But you know me. You know me and you know this toast isn’t getting any better from here on out, yet you’re standing there anyway all happy ears instead of booing me off. And that’s…that’s pretty special.” From the corner of his eye, Tony could see Peter quietly creep up to where MJ stood, cufflinks catching the light again as he scratched the back of his neck awkwardly. Could see MJ’s arched eyebrow, the little quirk to her lips as her fingers slipped into the crook of her husband’s elbow. Tony smiled. “And I guess that’s what we’re all here to celebrate. Something special.”
Clint knocked.
One beat. Two.
(Tony did hate to make snap judgements…but he’d bet it was the aunt. Hell, if
tech that goes into production-”
Tony scrambled under the next car purely on instinct, chest tight with exertion, lungs filling with the stench of burnt cement. Not a dumb suit then. Something intelligent was after his life… and it knew how to operate his armours.
please,
It reminded him of war.
“I like being good at things.” Steve pushed out, almost like it was a confession, gaze getting just a little cloudy. But two blinks later, it cleared out just fine, and an almost rueful smile rose to prominence on those damnable lips. “Wasn’t too accustomed to that, before the serum. Tried and tried, but didn’t get anywhere. After…it didn’t seem right. To have all of those abilities, and still not do and be…good, the very best, at whatever I did.”
“And that’s when it strikes me, an honest-to-Thor epiphany right in the middle of this twenty-one year old rugrat prattling to me about love.” A wry, amused sound escaped his lips – memory hazy and rose-toned, but still so vivid. “ ‘Cause you see, I’d been expecting a laundry list of perfections – ‘oh MJ so smart’ and ‘oh MJ so pretty’ and ‘she makes me crack up like a loon’. But Peter didn’t say any of that.”
“Don’t.” It was like the churning tar inside his chest had been sucked right out. He’d spat out all the sharp words, and now his chest was sitting empty, contracting uselessly. “UN orders must have come by now, we need to leave in an hour at mo-”
Eventually he raised his head- because that’s what he always did. The world swam in a palette of water-colours: washed out grey and dirty white, black snaking along the ground- gleaming dark red where it caught the light. He rested a gauntleted hand against the floor and pushed- whoa, whoa, whoa. The world
The man in question lifted his chin, afternoon gold sliding over liver-spotted, still glossy skin. His dark eyes appeared russet in this light, something sure and implacable in that gaze. He was smiling. “I don’t need to leave the ground to fly, Tony.”
He opened his mouth to- he didn’t know what really, but a half-spoken word from somewhere else sparked his attention. Maybe if the conversation topic had been different, he wouldn’t have caught it; but under the circumstances, the almost inaudible drone from the screen atop the bar pricked his eardrums unerringly-
as well.”
His eyes flew open, awareness flaring to life just as quick at the back of his head. His eyes burned- the insides of his eyelids seeming raw and scratchy, but he was far less bleary than he had been last night. Still no idea of what had woken him though.
Steve smiled.
he didn’t have it on him anymore. Old habits died hard, that was all. The man shrugged, broad shoulders rising and falling. “I would have brought it over if I’d found it. Maybe you lost it in the debris.”
, where Ginger thought Fred’s character was a married man; she was reluctant to dance with him at the start, but then got inexorably pulled in by his charm. That flashy throw-and-dip maneuver right at the end…Bucky had unsuccessfully attempted it with many a lady, Mabel had even broken an ankle because of i-)
Breath patterns……that probably meant hitches, indicating pain. Fuck, Tony needed to go there right now. Except…..no, Rhodey had snapped at him the last time he’d turned up in the middle of the night, even though Rhodey did it for him often enough. This flip in their dynamic probably threw him off- with Tony as the caregiver and Rhodey as the recipient…but no, he wasn’t that egoistic. Rhodey was perfect. Proud, but perfect. He might hate feeling so dependant when he’d been so self-sufficient all his life- but that wasn’t the reason Tony should stay away. Sometimes a man needed to stave off his pain in solitude, with no energy to spare for comforting others- and that was what Tony was after, really- getting comfort rather than giving. He might kid himself into thinking he was helping, but what he wanted was Rhodey to tell him that he was a jerk, and that nothing could keep Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes down and bound to the ground. He wanted to soothe himself by seeing Rhodey’s chest rise and fall, in a sign of life. Dynamics didn’t flip that easily.
…and that was it. The letter crumpled under his fingers, and Tony twisted his neck back on the headrest to stare at the ceiling, panels grey and dim. The light fixtures were bright though-scoring past his pupils and creating bright spots of blindness.
heart’, the model of Howard’s Stark expo, the half completed prototype shield.
Sam could hear it too, without ever physically listening to the message. “Bring Falcon,” the Manhattanite accent curling sharply over the ‘c’, truncated abruptly at the ‘n’. He could see Stark’s cold eyes as he voiced the message, dark irises just as aimless.
The onslaught of panic, the dark crushing him again. “
“You can’t contact him.” Professionality, but with a well of disturbance boiling just below the surface, out of sight. This wasn’t just a minor inconvenience. Real shit had gone down. “You need to get your plane and fly-”
“But that day in Siberia,” Train of thought abruptly terminated, Tony blinked up at Steve, caught off-guard despite it all. Something soft and acrimonious curved Steve’s lips, though his eyes looked bleak. “I got the answers I was looking for.”
Rhodey inhaled deeply. Tony would feel
Click. No blinding flash of light. Steve felt like punching the air in triumph.
“You’ll make some kid’s day.”
café had an ‘outdoor seating area’ carpeted with said plastic grass, currently deserted by patrons and two out of three potted geraniums on fire. Being under attack would do that to a place.
“That…has been taken care of.” Steve replied, almost on reflex- mind still whirling over the fact that Tony hadn’t mentioned his parents, or even strictly answered.
“They’re.” Peggy hitched a breath. Cast in unearthly scarlet or no, she still looked like Steve’s best dream. “It hasn’t happened yet, but… they’ll be. They’re.. doing really well.”
“Okay.” Steve said, a little toneless. “Okay. It just… it felt like you wanted to say something to me, before the fight.”
Tom grasped his left arm and pulled, Steve let him. His head reeled a little with the added height, world blurring; his weight coming to rest across a broad shoulder, Tom losing his breath with a quiet ‘oof’. Two seconds of simultaneous breathing, and then they stepped forward, staggering to the door step by cautious step.
Tony pulls back for an inch, and sees blue eyes, a shining face. He sees Stephanie Rogers, and thinks
“Are you his friend, now?”
They walked together into his kitchen, Clint only a few paces behind Natasha’s falling footsteps, eyes immediately darting to every glossy surface in the room. God, Laura had been stress cleaning again. She only did it when he wasn’t around, because she knew how much he hated reflective surfaces that messed with his sightlines…but that wasn’t a path he could go down either

He shook with it, the startlement. He blinked his eyes. Peggy smiled at him from across the diner booth, chestnut-hair shining in the light and victory suit as perfectly pressed as when he’d first met her. “You were gone there, for a while.”
“At OsCorp, actually.” Peter ducked his head, but there was still a glimmer of pride in his eyes. “The orientation was last week, Norman Osborn addressed us and everything-”
“So while we’re all standing around, let’s also raise a glass to Peter and MJ – who somehow, despite belonging to the same species as the rest of us who screw up on a daily basis – have managed to do everything, absolutely right by each other.” His jaw might have cracked a little, from the ache of grinning at the man who was dearer to him than any child he could’ve ever had – all the while the best guy he’d ever known, who loved
It was a curious quality- naiveté. He didn’t know if he quite admired, or despised it.
st – stop!” Tony managed to wheeze out between soundless fits of the giggles. The merciless assault halted for a second, and Tony gasped for precious oxygen. “You…are…older…than fucking Dumbledore. Would you…act like it, for once?”
Tony hummed, half in remembrance, pressing back into the arm that Steve tucked over his stomach. “Well, would you look at that. And now we’re in accord that we make each other better. All worked out in the end.”
that and we don’t make excuses.” It all sounded so…inexcusably simple, narrated by a man who knew through time-tested experience how much it wasn’t. And there was at least one other person here today who knew it too. Tony cleared his throat, soft and uncharacteristically unobtrusive. “We’ve lived with the best and worst in each other. And I love her.’”
“There was a bombed out bar, half a mile out from our base at the time.” Steve’s jaw barely moved as he spoke, the straight lines of it firming up like this was all just like any other setback. Set your jaw tight and push through, right? Tony wanted to break those lines on his knuckles, soothe it with warmed breath. “They hadn’t taken the alcohol when they ran, and I helped myself…after. Whiskey, mostly. Three bottles. Calvert – Buck and I’d never been able to afford it, but we used to see the ads in the paper – men lounging in a boat, fishing with full tumblers in hand, while a longnose shark jumped in the background.”

but his thoughts were interrupted by his own memories, mind flashing back to that last night with Yinsen in the cave; and there was nothing superficially similar about that situation, nearly ten years ago, and now. But it somehow felt like the same anyway. The same, cold, hopeless realisation of purpose.
A shower of sparks, a screech as repulsor energy met vibranium metal. He remembered the sound.
He couldn’t see as well as he would have if he’d been wearing the helmet, but that particular shade of blue wasn’t hard to miss. At the next intersection, stood a figure hugged head to toe in an eye-watering hue, snatched straight out of the American flag.
“Good… good girl, FRIDAY.” His fingers rose up to his neck of their own volition, feeling the vibrations of his very intact voice. No bandages.

And before you know it, she’s gone before she ever was there, leaving a mild ache in his shoulder and a deep, fatal gouge somewhere where his heart is supposed to be.
Then again – why keep it to himself?
(sometimes, if he thought back hard enough, he could almost remember a time he enjoyed being a superhero).
“I’ll go inside and take the one by the counter, keep an eye for the other two.” Steve didn’t miss a beat, not
Copying like kindergarteners, and Tony was beaming like one, dark eyes dancing in mirth. There were creases around his eyes, and down the corners of his mouth, outlining those mischievously pursed lips, pink and curled. His teeth flashed white when he smiled, brows arching high as he contributed to the stream of whispered insults that was flowing continuously between the two couples now. It was a strange contrast; that erudite smoothness persistent in his naturalistic movements, the slant of his lips-and that carefree shine to his eyes.
I'm definitely writing at least a second part- though I might extend the series further if the response is nice. Comment if you liked?
“This isn’t an emergency.”
“We’re not talking about this.” Tony sliced through his words without pause, or remorse. “You’re not going.”
“Hiring you as my personal assistant was the best decision I ever made.” There were still words coming out of his mouth, entirely on autopilot, why–
that he was moving-except the blaring, blatant lack of purpose behind every adjustment of a buckle, every mounting creak in the silence as armour and Kevlar plates flexed and released. Another twitch, and Sam’s eyes darted to the side and down-ineffably caught by bare fingers curling and flexing uselessly in thin air.
She’s mid-air, and for a second, Tony mistakes the spinning vertigo in his stomach for awe. She’s propelled herself off a crate, and while her left heel’s already caved the body of the bot in, her descending shield is poised to deal the final severing blow. His engineering eyes scope out the twisting figure in seconds-the straight lines running from the ballet perfect point of her toe to the trim waist, twisted sharply into a forty five degree angle as she inhumanly bends backward mid fall to snap the arm of the very human guy who’d snuck up behind her. Idiot.
Tony looked on at the Wakandan royal’s stony face, and reflected that perhaps that last sentence hadn’t been the best of ideas.
“We catch up.” FRIDAY hummed, almost chirpy. “He is the only other person my age I know.”
One breath. Two. Tony released a final exhale, hissing through his teeth before pushing himself back and upwards, the armour towering over his height as ever. The merciless lights were beginning to seriously bother his eyes.
if I did it to save Bucky’s life or to stop you from becoming a murderer,
“You’ve worked so hard. Been… unmeasurably brave, done so much.” Peggy’s eyes glistened with the warmth of a thousand setting suns. “I couldn’t be prouder.”
Sam didn’t ask, nor did he further say-
“I do my best, boss.” He was in bed. Sitting up, though he didn’t remember that – white covers half thrown off, heels kicking lightly over the heated floorboards. He stilled them with a jerk, blinking again against the bright sunlight streaming through the ceiling-to-floor windows.
“I don’t think you know how much. I don’t think anyone does.” Rhodey didn’t seem angry though. His tone was calm, no vindictive bite to the consonants as they left his lips. Unwavering, like stating facts of life. “You never actually were on a team, not even in school. Skipped through grades too fast, and even if the other kids invited you-you were too young to do well, and you hate being bad at things. Never even played a team sport. Too busy, too proud.”
And then Clint’s anger seemed to drain- his shoulders falling down and tone curiously listless. “I’m a simple guy, Steve. I don’t do large, philosophical debates. People point, I shoot. That’s how it’s always been.” A careless kick, and a stone skipped from the ground to land with a quiet plop in the middle of the stream. “But as a guy who’s never been good at anything but killing- lemme tell you this. Wars can come to us, and we can fight to end them.”
Huh. Tony stilled the spinning with the press of a heel to the cold concrete, feeling the words carefully in his mouth. “Well you’d be flying into combat with me… in this hypothetical. So yes. Technically.”
Clint closed his eyes.
He didn’t know how long he’d been walking for – it would have been all too natural to try and fire the thrusters, but something whispering at the back of his mind stoppered that impulse. Instead, he fell to instinct and kept walking, flex-release-clank accompanying him down uncountable blocks: 17th, 18th, 19th streets, down and down till Seventh Avenue. Came to a lumbering stop, and if he raised his head and looked left, he could spot the…what used to be the Avengers Tower fifty metres away.
His brain impossibly persisted in this oxygen deprivation, running a million miles a minute.
. Several seconds passed in silence before he realised his eyes were fixed on the floor before he tore them away, knuckles coming up to rub roughly at the corners of their lids till they stung.
Steve tried to breathe past the sheer
“Sentiment.” The word tasted cold on his tongue, like something he’d heard before and chosen to suppress. “You made a judgement call. Not based on facts, or consequences, or morals. But because you… empathised.”
Still nothing. Fuck, he’d deployed a fix for one of her subroutines earlier – could that have had side effects? He’d need to boot up manually, check if all her nodes were still running.
But after four days, an email appeared in his inbox, seemingly out of nowhere though of course it had been borne on the invisible webs that the modern world had given birth to. And so the trickle began again- sometimes four of the recordings in a week, sometimes an entire fortnight passing before he’d see the sun of Siberia gleam on metal and Kevlar again. And as the weeks passed, it became increasingly clear- Tony was not doing this to mock Steve, or prove a point, or even attempt to change his mind. In fact, it seemed more likely that Tony had no idea that Steve was receiving any of these in the first place.
natural, and it fled just as quick as it had arrived; and Tony stopped trying to pretend that every inch of his skin wasn’t aching, that his eyelids weren’t dry and stretched thin, that his back didn’t hurt and breathing wasn’t hard, that Vision wasn’t cooped up in the kitchen at ‘home’ making one after the other paprika-filled dish for an absent Wanda, that Rhodey wasn’t striving to keep the pain out of his voice every time he spoke, that Pepper wasn’t
Steve raised his eyes from his foamy palms, blue irises flicking over to settle on Tony’s face. Tony’s lip curled upwards challengingly. “Millions of traits, and not a single common one between you and I? Mathematically impossible, I refuse to believe it.”
anymore.
“Ex-teammates.” Ross produced his smile again. Punching it off was sounding better and better by the minute. “And I’d remind you that said jerk kept your ass out of jail.”
All the Avengers are there, without exception, which makes Tony’s throat release with the relief and something coil tight in his belly with disappointment. They’re raucous and they’re mocking each other loudly, setting up the table; and in all the cacophony that comes with having these many superheroes in one room, Tony feels safe to notice that Steph’s changed out of her uniform, into a plain white t-shirt and black sweats. That she’s clearly cleaned his dried blood out of her fingernails, that the terrible wistfulness in her features is gone and she looks content to be sitting here, among her friends.
Tony pitched to the right, rolling over on his side and out from underneath the car; just as the Iron Man hauled the Ferrari up into the air by its trunk, front wheels barely keeping contact with the ground. Repulsors shot out the other glove, smoking a black patch onto the floor where Tony had just been.
overtook the audio, barely space for a breath between vicious blows- Steve stared, watching the armour wince and flinch and brace itself like it was a living thing, slowly crumpling in under the vibranium.
When he’d blinked the spots out of his eyes, the diner seemed faded – though still bathed in coloured light. Peggy had stopped smiling, though her eyes were still kind. “I wasn’t alone.”
The surreal part was that there were five strapping men on that stage, complete with high-waisted, pleated pants and suspenders, jitterbugging away. Beyond the platform, and the crowd of watchers awkwardly swaying or bobbing on the balls of their feet, a swing band was strumming out something lively. Looming over it all, stood a ten foot screen swaying gently in the wind, resplendent with the black and white forms of Fred and Ginger cutting a step.
“Trust me, I can whinge about it right now.” Tony’s mutter was lost somewhere in the pillow, till he lifted his chin with great effort and blearily cracked his eyelids open. “Who dares disturb the post-orgasmic slumber of a geriatric?”
“Tony.” Came the response, and Tony snapped his mouth shut immediately because that tone meant Rhodey was trying to
The ocean tossed in the distance, grey tides crashing into the surf, frothing white. Tom’s eyes were fixed somewhere in between, the horizon maybe-except the divide between sea and sky was difficult to find, when they both were tinged so hoary. “It isn’t me. It’s…a consciousness, maybe. The echo of a memory passed from man to child, generation to generation.”
Evidently not. For Sam smiled next to him, lips twisted, voice filled with a queer, bitter compunction. “Which one? The android or the cripple?”
It was beautiful.
“It was easier before, being unafraid.” Steve dipped his head, just enough for the sun to caress his cheek, illuminating tousled strands of hair. He looked like a man Tony had once opened his eyes to, one cloudless day in two thousand and twelve, smile strong and warm and hopeful, all at once.
His bark of a laugh was half surprise, half relief. Fuck, he’d forgotten how she used to ambush him like this.
Peter commenced tugging his sleeves back over his wrists, straightening them conscientiously, fingers lingering absently on the smoothed curve of the cufflinks. “Speaking of – did Nat say she was coming?”
“And loved your beauty with love false or true.”
“Aftershocks.” Rhodey corrected. “The big one hit an hour ago. The areas are ‘too remote’ for the armed forces to help, they say. Not immediately. So they’re sending us in.”
by how brain-devouringly boring clean up duty is.”
“Shut up and revel in the burn, you whippersnapper.” Peter snapped his mouth shut, and somehow, inexplicably, Tony found himself matching the little grin that sprung at the corners of his mouth. “Hitting as fast as you talk is what gets you on the-”
They seemed to finally come to a consensus. At first, what had just transpired wasn’t apparent-they seemed to just fall back into their natural rhythm. Except the rhythm seemed…stuttered somehow, Tony stepping on to his left foot and pausing too long before the hop, his partner following through too quickly on her right. They pressed close, chest-to-chest, and Tony grinned widely over his partner’s shoulder, like inviting the entire world into the joke.

“Same, except I’d be putting politicians out of business – which would make me the
No. By the time Steve received the one recording that started before Tony entered the BARF, instead of during- his motivations had become all too apparent. Watching the gritted teeth, the whitened complexion, the quickened breaths, the hand gripped over his chest and the muttered, “Fucking
to the barrier, he could grab a pass if he wanted, make eye contact-
“Do you think it should die?” Simple and direct. Tony didn’t speak, and Steve didn’t wait for an answer, lips flickering into something real. “Then it matters.”
? “My berries contain multitudes too.”
Sam didn’t move.
Tony’s lips quirked without his permission. Three strides and he was looming over the back of the chair his best friend was comfortably cossetted in, casting a shadow over his shoulder and the streamlined design that was emerging on the drafting pad. “You know, I never thought I’d say this to any man except Steve – but your cans are positively glorious, pooh bear.”
“I’m not your Captain any longer.” A sense memory, of the shield clattering against the floor, a long, long….not too long while ago.
He opened his lips to speak.
Steve shook the thought aside, with an errant jerk of the head. Dropped his eyes to the description.
“I’m not a shrink.”
No. No. This, he did know.
Something knocked gently into his ankle.
Memory-Tony’s mouth smoothed up in a smirk, comfortably cocky and friendly. “You’ve already expressed your heartbreak at my imminent departure-“
out of Steve’s lungs; his chest contracting rapidly and throat drying with a tightness that felt like someone had actually dealt him a blow in the gut. He blinked rapidly, swallowing again and again, but it was like breathing had quit on him and air was refusing to cooperate- he turned, but Sam was already sliding out of the seat and smiling, with that same caustic shame, “Catch ya later, Cap.”
Tony almost choked.
“Besides. Hadn’t you devised a method to synthesise it anyway?” T’Challa steepled his fingers over his chin- Tony hadn’t realised that was an actual thing people did before this moment. “Or is that just a myth your people made up to conflate your status even further?”
Steve felt the smile rise to his lips, slow and inexorable. His heart was pounding steadily in his chest.
They were literally knocking into each other now-Tony and his partner cutting off the other couple’s natural trajectories, oh-so-casually boxing them into the far corner, elbows and kicking heels just barely missing body parts. Or not-the blonde kicked out her leg with an amiable smile, rounded toe tip landing straight on the back of Tony’s thigh-he buckled with a swear, a yell from the crowd arcing up, “You go, Danvers!” The woman shrugged nonchalantly, red lips mouthing an, ‘oops’. Her partner switched his disapproving glare to her instead.
Steve stared at the bleak seascape, storm clouds buffeted along the sky by great winds. The sea was forever shifting, a gigantic mass of ripples, with white flecks in the distance. The moisture had soaked into his pants, clogged in the sand caking his thighs, wet the back of his shirt and dripped off the bridge of his nose. His throat was dry.
capital S, the modernist leanings he himself favoured in the scant décor were unmistakeable – “You had a haircut.”
, a plate sliding free. There wasn’t much to be seen in the near non-existent light, except the gleam of dark eyes.
“Tony.” He managed, after several more seconds. “Call me Tony.”
of the tech, though Tony wouldn’t be able to tell you the difference between those two things if he tried). Helen Cho was still overseeing tests on the tech to see if it was safe for prolonged use, it was technically still in beta. Vision…Vision was an option, but whether the workings of his head bore any similarity whatsoever with the human prefrontal cortex was entirely up in the air.
The tide crashed again. Steve could hear his words whipped around by the winds, quiet and hollow. “Was that…after my time?”
. This is one thing he finds himself strangely incapable of lamenting.
“Tony.”
Their laughter was too soft, too raspy to challenge the yawning silence of the Siberian wasteland. Yet they laughed- up and up at the sky, and Steve thought of the memory of Bucky’s hand too far for him to reach and slipping into the abyss, and felt no pain. It was like a man with a chronic illness had woken up one day to find his eyes unclouded, the fever gone, the thrice-damned pain banished as if it had never been there in the first place. It felt wonderful.

…wait a minute.
) to even consider.
“I almost don’t want to know what you said to Steve.” Those lips curved. “Or Tony.”
A very distant part of Tony’s head noted that Captain America was stumbling on his words – but he’d left Tony the shield, and maybe with it the eloquence. The artifice. Or maybe it was the other way round, and he’d taken the freedom to flounder instead – to trip over and pick himself back up, to let his voice thicken in powerless emotion.
Repulsors powering up, Tony took to the air and jetted over to the front-facing side of the café, landing on the pavement as noisily as possible. Two large strides and he kicked the door in, gaze automatically scouting the back entrance to check if Steve was glowering at him. In the very next second, he received facefuls of fire – which warmed his nose up slightly, because unlike Apple, his model upgrades actually improved the tech.
Emptied. Of rage and grief and panic and righteousness, till he could wash his face at the basin with the mirror, and watch something curiously akin to Tony’s defeated eyes stare back at him.
Maybe it wasn’t the injuries making his head feel scrambled through, turned inside out and reeling. It was like the shudders had started deep beneath the ground a long time ago, tectonic quakes that had somehow travelled into his body and made a home. He felt shaken up from the inside. Cracks running through the foundations, everything ill-fitting and displaced.
. For all that it had gotten dimmer, the world also seemed clearer at the edges. Like a hazy picture beginning to resolve, showing all its grainy details, cracks in the wall. Steve breathed in the stillness, breathed in the dust. “How’re the husband and kids, Peg?”
Clint let pushed out a particularly long exhale, and leaned back till he could feel the familiar granite of his countertop digging into his vertebrae. Natasha dropped down on the wooden chair three metres diagonally across from him, immediately propping a foot on the coffee table. Clint twitched.
Then Pepper becomes
Steve’s words drifted over, barely above a murmur – though his eyes were burnished bright. “So long.”
Stephanie had said.
Well, Stephanie certainly seems buoyed by that. “Poetry reminds me of…people.” She continues, flush persistent but with renewed determination. “It’s less the words and more of the overall… feel of it. Their ideology seems to match the person’s. I don’t know.”
Betrayal- something in Steve’s head repeated again, caught in infinite loops, wild and thrown-off. He fumbled the phone, it slipped past his sweaty fingers, catching the end of the bed and tumbling to the floor- “Fucking
Several metallic clanks, as Iron Man straightened and pushed himself off of the wall. Bucky was attempting to rise off the floor, inch by inch, metal hand still attached to his shoulder slipping a little in the blood that was starting to pool beneath him –
“Google,” FRIDAY continued on stiffly – bless her dear processors – “has mostly come back with a collection of clips from Swedish and Korean horror movies. Should I curate them into a list?”
He compares himself to one, sometimes, when he’s in the mood to be spectacularly cliché. Constantly on the road to burning up, burning out, a candle flame that flutters twice as much when closer to extinction except think magnesium powder and ten times the explosion. Helium and oxygen, burning and exploding over and over and over, till the star consumes itself from the inside-while people from several galaxies away gaze and admire and make wishes. Nova…then nothingness. A black hole that sucks everything bright away.
Tony’s eyes fluttered open.
wouldn’t be good enough. So he runs the numbers, again and again and again, and imagines a thousand different simulations, and cannot sleep for the thought of what he could have done differently. Because that’s better than the thought that he
His ears were pricked for the whine of repulsors, but they never came. The impact of boots on concrete rippled up from the floor through to his palms – then the Ferrari creaked around him, the back groaning slightly as if something had just sealed a grip on its undercarriage.
“I can’t, anymore. Trust.” Was it an assertion? A confession? All Steve knew was that it was hollow-a flat assembly of syllables and words thrown to the wilderness. He was vaguely aware of getting up to his feet, knees unstable, sides twanging in pain.
“We’re never going to get a better chance-the quakes would have thrown whatever operations are going on there in disarray too.” Rhodey wasn’t even looking at him. His jaw had been tight ever since they’d sat down. “You and…Vision can start the rescue efforts and I’ll-”
Tony blinked once, and blinked again, just to be sure, because- that was it? The king handing over the ‘rarest, most precious mineral’, with nary a question, forget the Spanish Inquisition that it deserved? “One more thing.”
Steve put his hand up.
Another pause, and Steve was getting tired and frustrated with the quiet; the quiet that interrupted even when he was with other people. Maybe they didn’t mean it to be so, but it weighed down on him, like he had wronged it somehow and the quiet was asking questions and it
“You may be a sellout,
It sliced through the air, cutting parallel to the floor and hitting straight across the centre of the reactor case-hard enough to take off human and armoured heads. It ricocheted cleanly off, shield flying several metres before landing with a clatter, edge shrieking against concrete loud enough to wake the dead.
Next to him though, Steph seems to be taking the interruption of her bagel meal very seriously. In fact…wait, are her teeth grinding?
And maybe that was easier to think, than-
Steve stole a deep breath from the air, filling his lungs with the scent of roasted coffee, and freshly baked bread. Sweat from passing joggers and a night spent partying, the lingering odour of alcohol, the pungent, chemical cloud of deodorant. Sun streaked bright across his cheek as he slowed at the intersection, waiting for the traffic lights. There was a girl waiting beside him, snapping gum from stark black lips; wearing a top that was tied around her neck by two flimsy strings, entirely backless. It was red.
It doesn’t get any better. Tony is still dazed a couple of days later, which is why he gets into a screaming match with Steph in the middle of Times Square during a battle. That’s right, screaming match with the woman who’d recited what may-or-may-not be love poetry at him. Because that’s just the way he
, Howard reminded him inside his head, and Tony could barely bite back a laugh.
The bristles had gone down just as quickly as they’d pricked up, strangely enough; Steve’s gaze darting to the side as he went on to needlessly clarify, “Retirement. Hate to break it to ya Tony, but there ain’t exactly farms in New York.”
He felt it, like clockwork; the smile breaking out on the other man’s face. The words were warm. “See, I never knew that about you.”
Tony has heard it all, the litany of it. Peggy, Bucky, Dum Dum, Brooklyn, the alley where I got my nose broken, the hospital where my mother brought me up…and he knows it’s a never ending one.
“I don’t know what you’re-“
Even if he was part of the collective this time.
he could hear Bucky chime in with a mock-aggravated sigh, affection shining through the words.
Tony stared at the smoking ruin, a steel base sliced in half, edges still glowing red… an arm fallen over on its side, clamp unmoving.
“FRIDAY?” The sleep dissipated from his eyes with every passing second of silence, unease squirming to life at the pit of his stomach. This was highly unusual. “Respond – passphrase seven-seven-mariner-earendil-six.”

Sublimate it, she said. Use it for better things.
T’Challa turned, head tilting just the slightest in question.
Silence never really fell, not with the ocean rumbling in the distance, but several seconds passed without words.
T’Challa didn’t blink. Tony should have felt unnerved, but didn’t. “I was under the impression that the Sokovia fiasco would have left too much of a bad taste for you to dabble in vibranium suits.”

What. What. Clint felt a familiar bloom of protective rage in his chest, though the target had never been Nat before. “Lagos was a clusterfuck and the casualties
A last burst of exhaled air, though the amusement in this didn’t seem as pure. Steve’s mouth curved to the side briefly, something almost like resignation flashing in his features. “Nice talk, Stark.”
Steve shook off the memory, heart thundering in his coiled up chest. Clint’s words were like a roar, building up in his ears, ringing in his drums, drowning out all other sounds. The quiet had never been louder. “I…he.” His tongue felt thick, and flubbery in his dried up mouth. “He wouldn’t have listened.”
? Judging by Steve’s sparkling countenance, that would be a yes. “And you use them as literal manifestations of your ability to annoy people to death.”
to so many things, like Pepper being essential for SI and Tony’s life and sanity in ways he’d never dream of betraying to her. And duralumin is hard yet lightweight, it builds the bodies of aircraft, and phrasing it like that seems easier than
A rustle.
He’d been expecting the clanks and clamour of battle. Blows and wounds and weapons held up in defence or powered up to attack. He was hardened now- by still simmering rage and the weight of knowing what was coming, ready for the black, horrible imaginings of Stark’s mind. Ready for whatever the man had left to aim at him.
Tony lifted his shoulders in a shrug. “Does it matter? You could probably quote them to me verbatim, and in psychological terms to boot.”
His feet were sticking out of the bedding.
“Shh, shh.” There was a presence at his side, a broad palm pressing at the back of his neck. He could feel cool clay at his lips, water attempting to seep through. The…glass? pot? …tilted against his mouth further, and he tried to gulp the liquid down, throat working uselessly. Some of it ran into his parched mouth, the rest down his chin, puddling in his neck. His entire torso was aching. Information was seeping through in increments.
“Isn’t the guy traditionally supposed to be the one sending the poetry?” He imparts this fatal blow, eyes twinkling behind glasses, and Tony snorts and fixes up his morning coffee.
“Ar.. armour override.” Tony said, as the Mark VII raised its head. “Six seven nine seven one one two.”
“I-I get it.” Tony echoed back, sounding…awed, maybe. He pulled back, hat crushed beyond repair in his flexing grip. There was a slight indent on his lower lip, that hadn’t been there before. Maybe Steve had left it there. Tony’s tongue darted out unconsciously, tracing over the mark as if in hunt for an elusive taste.
soft and squishy, green or not; but that wasn’t the important bit here. “Four hundred and sixteen? Isn’t that the longest we’ve gone so far?”
Something that might’ve trundled out, curious about all the noise and eager to investigate. Something that would’ve wandered right up to the Mark VII, treads bumping unevenly on the glass-strewn floor, thinking it was a friend and–
Steve uncurled his hand, where crushed black plastic was sitting, smoking wires peeking through the gaps, where a mouse had once been. Chest still thundering, he slipped his fingers into his right pocket and pried the phone out, eyes darting in a distracted manner over the caller ID flashing onscreen- just as his heart stopped.
Steve puffed a soft laugh, warm vibrations tingling against the skin of Tony’s back. Tony shivered pleasantly, voice lilting up in question, “What?”
Steve tilted his head just a fraction to the side – Tony had no idea where he’d picked it up from but it was endearing as
be the one to call.”
“You’re dead.” Steve rasps out, Tony’s face shuttering in confusion. And there’s nothing anyone can do about it. “You’re dead.”
Awareness sparked dimly in his mind, which was still lumbering somewhere in the realm of the subconscious. His legs felt overheated, entangled as they were in the blankets- but kicking them off seemed too much effort. He’d drooled on his pillow- there was a conspicuous damp spot and his lips were parted and sticky with it. From somewhere, he mustered the wherewithal to at least close his mouth, shifted his cheek away from the patch of drool and lay unmoving- waiting for sleep to reclaim him.
It seemed to help though, something in Steve’s shoulders seeming to screw loose, eyes skittering over Tony’s face like he hadn’t seen it in a while. Which was ridiculous, because Tony was on
"Morning." Steve returns the greeting, not caring about morning breath and pulling Tony in for a kiss after.
No one had really said anything, both completely unsure of what to say; Steve most of all. Just a few hours ago he was fully ready to ask Tony out on a date and now he's learning all about this other part of the man's life that he had no clue about.
"We know you did, Pete. But all you can do right now is relax and get some rest so you can feel better, and all Papa and I can do right now is help you get better and promise that we will take you later." Tony says, gently easing Peter back down in bed and brushing some of his curls out of his eyes.
"Tony," Steve calls out to get the man's attention, slowly lowering down on one knee when the scientist turned around to face him.
A couple of weeks ago, Steve had begun to realize how ran ragged he and Tony were getting - between Steve's commissions and horribly uncompliant customers, Tony's thousands of meetings coming in one after another, and Peter refusing to sleep during the night in his own bed - and came to the conclusion that a vacation desperately needed to get added to the agenda.
The small boy just nodded in return and slowly closed his eyes, falling asleep almost as quickly as he had woken up.
“I thought you were asking someone else out. I was really mopey all day because of it; not going to lie.”
"What?"
Except, he wasn't. He didn't come back tomorrow or the next day, or even the day after that.
He had just got done working with one of the most difficult customers he’s had in a really long time; with said customer hounding Steve about doing a completely different art commission than what they had agreed upon originally, only to get widely upset when Steve told them it was going to cost more if he were to do so.
"So, it's just thirty dollars for you," Tony says, once again just trying to rush things right along.
"Deal." Tony agrees, instantly passing up Pete in exchange. "Although, fair warning, he hasn't eaten in a bit so he may not stay content for very long," Tony warns once Sarah had a firm grip on the babe.
It was the second most beautiful sight he's ever seen, and he was fully ready to paint it and begin to add waterfalls to his commission 'can do' list. The first most beautiful sight he's ever seen was standing next to him with Peter sitting on his shoulders, both of them staring at the giant waterfall in awe.
Once Steve had the money he handed Tony Peter's bowl of soup and bag of popcorn and the two of them made their way into the living room; Steve slowly tagging along with food for him and Tony.
Everything about the bar and about Tony seemed to intrigue Steve, and he couldn't resist coming back for more.
"And that's what I'm here for. To help you and Tony out. And to also get my own fill of baby cuddles in. If anything I'm just bribing you both with food so I can get Peter all to myself." Sarah continues to tease, smiling even more to herself when she could physically see the tension begin to bleed out of her son.
Steve didn’t even know how long he was there, doing CPR on this random child, all he could focus on was counting to thirty as he did compressions, giving two breaths, and continuing that whole process once more.
Instantly a bunch of stars and constellations began to flood the tent, Peter gasping at the sight before him. His eyes were moving a mile a minute as he tried to take the whole roof of the tent in all at once.
"Ten dollars please," Steve says, holding his hand out for Peter to place the bills in.
Steve gasps, "A ticket? Wow, I wonder what for!" Steve pretends to ponder before looking back at his son. "Wanna go find out?" Steve asks, making Peter nod his head excitedly; previous bad mood forgotten completely.
"Steve?" Tony repeated back dumbly, not quite being able to believe it.
“Alright, what can I get you?” The bartender says, pulling Steve’s attention off the surroundings all around him.
"Well, hello young man, what would you like to eat today?" Steve asks once they walked up to the cardboard stand that they had made, a fake menu stapled to the side of it.
”Uh-huh. And you’re sure that’s all it is? Because the two of you are now acting like you drank three pots of expresso without me knowing.” Tony says, his voice laced with suspicion.
When Steve woke up, it was slow, and for once he actually felt well-rested. Steve gently peeled his eyes open and looked around the one-roomed cabin, smiling when he saw his boyfriend still sleeping in his arms.
"I want you to! I want you and Daddy to be together like how Ned's Mommy and Daddy are together." Peter answers, pausing a bit after. Steve, recognizing Peter's thinking face - it was hard not to when it was almost identical to Tony's - allowed the brief quiet to settle upon them so the toddler could gather the rest of his thoughts together.
"It's half-past eight," Steve informs, a fond smile forming on his face when Tony rolled onto his back to stretch and rub at his eyes in the same way a familiar four-year-old would.
Shrugging, Tony began moving some of the pieces around so that there was a checkmate was in place and smiled when it seemed to scratch the itching sensation in his brain.
Almost as if Tony was wishing magic into the air, a knock on the front door could be heard throughout the whole house.
"I know it might have been an invasion of privacy, but there was one day a few weeks ago that I had come in here with the courage to finally ask you out face to face. Of course, Rhodes was in here instead of you, so I couldn't actually ask you out. I had tried to walk out of the bakery in hopes that he wouldn’t see me, but that didn’t quite work out and he caught me,” Steve rambles on and on, Tony listening and trying to take it all in.
"Always."
"Does that mean you'll also be my Daddy?" Peter voices, stopping Steve's heart in his chest.
Once they were arm and arm, Steve couldn’t help but place a gentle kiss on the side of Tony’s head before beginning to walk out of the bakery.
“Can do.” The bartender agrees before walking away to get that. That was when something behind the bar caught Steve’s attention.
The game was lasting forever.
excited! Daddy, are we there yet?" Peter once again questions, thankfully distracting Tony enough to give Steve a bit of breathing room.
"Sorry, we got a bit distracted." Steve apologizes, making sure to give a half-truth. Tony always knew when he was lying and, even though he technically was lying by keeping secrets, it made him feel slightly better and made him seem not so obvious this way.
"Hey, Pete, what do you say you and I begin cooking breakfast up while your Daddy goes take  shower?" Steve asks once Tony's stomach settled down, giving Peter a wink when the boy gave him an incurring look to let him know it had to do with their secret plan.
They both have been running themselves ragged while they tried to get used to being new parents. Although, neither one of them would change any of it for the world.
On it was just a plain grilled cheese with some tomato soup, and while Peter was thankful for it, he was still too upset to do much else other than to begin eating.
Whatever possessed him to agree on taking the night shift for the next couple of weeks alone he'll never know. All he does know is that he was completely and utterly bored.
"Steve, do you think Daddy is gone?" Peter whispers after a few moments of silence.
"Exactly like that." Tony agrees, pulling Peter into his arms and snuggling up with the young boy for a bit.
Tony stared at the board longer than needed, just to make sure there wasn't a move that he accidentally missed somehow. He even went so far as to check the picture on his phone; he suggested a while ago that the both of them start taking pictures of their moves just in case someone messed with the board so they could move everything back to how it was before.
Or, at least, that's what was supposed to be happening. But, turns out that the four-year-old is just as excited - if not more so - as Steve is about the proposal and can't stop asking to see the ring.
Tony stared a bit more curiously at the board, wondering why anyone would abandon a game after only the first move when he saw a small slip of paper underneath the board.
Tony and Steve both planted a kiss on Peter's forehead and stayed perched on the young boy's bed until they were both sure he was completely asleep. Although, that didn't take long since Peter had exhausted himself from being so upset.
"But-But-But, then we- we were going to go see the penguins, and after we were supposed to go to the building with the stars." Peter cries, only managing to make his stuffed-up nose even worse.
"I know," Steve replies, once again digging around in his pants pockets for something.
Plus - not that this was his motivation - it earned Steve a lot of brownie points that Tony promised to cash in once they were back home and weren't sleeping two feet away from Peter.
"I don't look like that. What makes you think I look like that?" Tony tries to deny, consciously schooling his expression in a neutral one.
That's what caused Tony to look down at the chessboard sitting on the coffee table, staring at what looked like an abandoned game. It had to abandon, there wasn't even a check or checkmate sitting there.
"Okay, so then why are you doing that here? You're still at the bakery, you do realize that right?"
It had been a week since the stranger had played him back in chess and Tony was beginning to get bummed out about it. So much so, that Peter even began noticing it whenever they saw each other in passing.
Peter slowly began to wake up a few hours later, still feeling miserable from both being sick and having to miss out on his field trip.
Tony truly was interesting, and Steve loved being able to talk to him in between other customers. And yet, every time Steve learned more information about Tony, the more he felt the bartender was a complete mystery.
He was no longer half-tempted when another thirty minutes passed and there was still no one in there. Huffing, Tony grabbed the mop and began to get to work.
Laying on the bed in the room was a tiny and frail little boy, who couldn’t have been much older than ten. The poor little guy was connected to so many different wires and machines and was pale as a ghost.
"That's pretty smart, though. And really creative, also." Steve compliments, only feeling slightly weird for kind of flirting at the moment.
Steve was actually a bit surprised when he managed to find the campground they were at. They had a bunch of one-roomed cabins to rent, it was extremely kid-friendly with a park and even a pool, and it was deep enough in the wilderness that there were so many beautiful places to go sightseeing at.
Tony knew it was a bit difficult to see the stars in New York other than a small little twinkle here and there, so he did everything he could to build his own mini planetarium for them.
It was getting a bit sad, honestly. And a bit frustrating, also.
"So what's the plan for today?" Tony asks once they pull away.
"I-I still don't understand." Tony dumbly replies.
"And what if I ask you to stay?" The bartender hesitantly asks.
There were a lot of unsaid's while they were talking, but Steve never pushed, feeling like it would be too far since he has only just now become a regular and has only now started to get to know the other man better.
“Oh, god, Pete. He-He’s not breathing, I don’t-” Tony begins to panic as he continued to look the young boy over, causing Steve’s instincts to kick in.
"Daddy will love it!" Peter agrees jumping up and down with excitement.
"Stay. Please."
"Now, this doesn't happen at a typical zoo, but at
"You mean
"Yeahh.
It honestly seemed cozy for a bar.
One of his favorite things was watching how much his regulars lived changed; from them coming in for their kid's first birthday party cake, to them coming in for the same kid's graduation cake. He loved it.
"Now, here you go, Pete, here's ten dollars so you can buy whatever you'd like to eat, okay?" Tony says before they walk into the kitchen, handing Peter a couple of dollars to make the experience more real.
"Well, with an attitude like that, Grandma may never leave." Sarah preens, laughing when she heard Steve make a slightly apprehensive noise as she walked in.
There, sitting on the roof, was a giant dome tent, big enough to practically fit all of the other Avengers along with them.
I meet him." Tony corrects the teen before beginning to walk out of the shop.
Knowing that he probably shouldn't read someone's personal note, Tony almost just went and threw it away, but his boredom and curiosity got the better of him and he opened it up anyway.
Sure enough, Steve was standing at the front desk with a wide smile on his face, looking as dashing as ever.
"He's been sick for as long I could remember. Has something to do with the way he was born. There were a lot of complications to get him here." Tony eventually speaks up, startling Steve a bit.
"Alright, then, let's go to our own personal star building," Tony says, allowing Steve to scoop Peter up before they began to make their way up to the roof.
Only thing was, every time he got his hopes up, the person he got his hopes up for wouldn't bring up the chess game. They would just order and then leave without so much as to a hint that they knew Tony.
"Steve! We're not at our picnic yet! You were supposed to wait." Peter admonishes, although there wasn't much heat behind it since even Peter could no longer hold in his happiness.
The whole time they were walking down the pathway to the falls, Steve couldn't get out of his head. A million different thoughts were racing through at the moment.
Once they finally managed to pull away again, Steve grabbed Peter and tugged him into their hug, causing the little boy to giggle.
"Because this whole pining thing you're doing isn't it," Peter says, getting an affronted squawk in return.
After staring at the previous photo on Tony's phone, it was confirmed that there wasn't a move made.
"Just like the ones in Peter Pan, Petey-Pie," Tony replies, causing Peter to gasp in return.
"So, when do you two plan on giving me another grandchild." Sarah jokes, watching as Tony scoffed and began eating with his free hand, Peter tucked firmly into his other arm.
“I’m sorry I freaked out last time. That’s not on you.”
“You know I can’t,” he said.
“He’s one of the cowherds,” said Arnie, and his voice wavered. “Is this… is this going to be a problem? I thought you were more open-minded than this.”
“I… I know I have been a terrible friend to you,” said Steve, carefully. “And I’m so sorry. But I really do care about you. I hope… I had hoped now that everything had settled down, you would… maybe, you could let me make up for that. Let me show you I care. Maybe… maybe we could try being friends again?”
“I can’t believe you would have so low of a self-esteem that you would jump to any other explanation than the simplest one! Did it not occur to you that Steve may simply like you?”
“Tony! Please!” cried out Steve, running after him. “Did you not want it? Did I force myself on you?”
“I’m real!” protested indignantly Jan. “And I can lead you to the person who was singing.”
“I’ll be right back,” he mutters.
And that was the problem, wasn’t it? Something had happened and he had
“Really? Are you so sure?” sneered Tony.
“I’m sorry,” he repeats, “I’ll try to keep still.”
“You want a drawing of you jerking off?” he laughs. “Should’ve known you were a narcissist.”
Tony calms down, eventually, and his eyes soften as he puts his hand back on Steve’s arm, squeezing it gently.
“Well, will you lead me to the tower, tomorrow morning?” asked Tony with a contrite smile.
Tony blinked, the dream peeling away. In truth, their shared house was crumbling, Pepper and Happy were having trouble with the glassmakers’ guild because their guildmates couldn’t bear the idea of a woman in the profession, and Tony and Rhodey did not own the Stark Forge. Tony didn’t have enough money to buy it back from Obadiah Stane’s dirty hands -that was the reason why he spent his summers wandering from village to village as a tinkerer, while Rhodey accompanied caravans-. And as for Steve…
“The basket is enchanted too?” frowned Tony.
Steve already knows that Tony will remain the star of his wet dreams for a long time. Just watching him stroking himself, laying with abandon on Steve’s bed, legs spread wide open around Steve’s hips, head fallen back, eyes closed and mouth opened, his chest hovering in time with his panting, the maroon shirt pooling on the bed and around his well-defined shoulders, the wrinkled collar framing his sweating neck and clavicles.
Butterhooves snorted at him, and since Tony wasn’t paying attention to his mount anymore, Dummy promptly started munching on a patch of clovers. Tony was about to yell at him, for he had told him many times that clover wasn’t good for his belly, when he froze. Since Butterhooves had stopped moving, she wasn’t making all that noise anymore, and so Tony could hear a faint sound coming from deep into the forest.
“Oh, I can see Justin,” says Ms Potts, looking over Steve’s shoulder. “We have to greet him, Tony.”
“Now you’re spoiling him,” laughed Steve, but he accepted the tinder and pushed it into the embers. Immediately, flames rose, licking avidly the treat, devouring it in seconds.
around here? Was he being contaminated by these people’s illnesses?
, craving for Steve inside of him.
“I could pay a room,” suggests Tony, glancing back at him.
Tony shrugged.
Steve’s jaw drops to the floor. This can’t be happening! He has to be dreaming! There’s no way a guy as gorgeous as Tony would want to hook up with him after a few words, nor want a skinny bean pole like Steve to top him!
Tony arches an eyebrow, again, and looks both mutinous and amused. In the end, he simply nods and smirks;
do this, Steve. I’m not coming back here. I’m not facing him
“It’s okay. We can wait. I don’t mind, Tony. As long as you’re safe. And I’ll watch out for any enemies. Your village will be safe.”
“Shh,” said Jan, and she pointed at the glade.
“All the guys that tried to hook up with you were hunks. I seriously don’t get why you wouldn’t jump on that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, breakfast is sacred. I felt bad, knowing you were out there with an empty stomach,” replies Steve, and Tony grins, amusement in his eyes.
“Hey Tony!” greets cheerfully Jan. “I’ve been looking for you all night!”
Steve swallows.
’), had never said anything about it to him. Certainly Tony had heard it as slurs around him?
“You’re such an idiot, Dummy! I swear, this is all your fault!”
It was Steve looking at Tony each day more and more adoringly. It was Tony longing for him ever since his singing pierced through his heart on that very first day in the dark woods. It was them engaging in fornication in a heartbeat, without  having to bargain. It was them kissing with their tongues intertwining, it was Tony craving for
“Go on! The sorcerer has left a while ago, you’re safe. You can call Steve!”
“How about we don’t talk about fucking anymore?”
Thus Tony started his day, getting downstairs for breakfast -dear God, Mrs Arbogast’s grilled bread, butter and jam were delicious-, then putting up his stuff next to the stables, where Mrs Arbogast had told him he wouldn’t be a bother. Villagers started coming by, bringing him all kind of utensils to fix, and Tony set up for work.
Thank you all for the kudos! I hope you'll enjoy this new chapter.
“We didn’t screw up! Fighting over the Accords didn’t-”
“Of course! Follow me!”
Tony’s eyebrow arches again. It’s quickly becoming a quirk of his that Steve is very fond of.
“It is.”
“Good,” smiles Steve. “I’ll be right back. Don’t flee.”
Steve’s nibble fingers were now untying his shirt and opening it, and Steve splayed a hand on Tony’s stomach, pushing him toward the bed. Tony sat, his back against the wall behind him, his heart hammering in his chest. Steve’s ears were reddening, a blush dusting his bony cheeks, and he put his hand on Tony’s stomach, again, mapping the muscles there with a feathered touch that lit sparks in Tony’s guts.
“It’s my first time coming here,” admits Tony. “A friend recommended the place to me. I can see why.”
Tony moved right back in, kissing him fully on the mouth, hands playing with Steve’s collar, and he answered against his lips;
“I’m sorry, I should’ve warned you before I started the game. There’s been talks about war. Everyone is on edge. I’m worried, Steve. I wanted to have you come live in the village with me, but now isn’t a good time anymore.”
“I’m not fleeing.”
It wasn’t the first time Tony had gotten off to a man’s hand. In his younger days, his puberty-blooming friends and he would sometimes experiment together, before Tony got so good at hooking up with girls. They’d trade hand jobs, and not look twice at what that was - a trade of sexual acts for their own selfish pleasure, nothing more-. Who the hand belonged to did not haunt their minds, nor did it make them crave for kisses and penetration.
“You talk to the fire,” deadpanned Tony.
to wanna force me to get along with him, or even just make me have to bear with his presence!”
It was love and lust united in a blaze Tony should only give to his future wife, feelings he should only ever give to a woman… Never a man.
“Oh, I love this song! Jim, you owed me a dance, didn’t you?”
Another shaky breath.
When he finally pulls out, he’s tired, but not that much. Tony turns in his embrace and presses a chaste kiss on the corner of his mouth, his hand holding on Steve’s. Steve’s other hand wraps around Tony’s slippery member, and strokes him, sweetly, tightly. Tony falls quiet, taking in deep breaths, eyes closing, hips undulating at the same pace as Steve’s hand. Steve wants to put his mouth back down on him, but, seeing how Tony’s leaking, he’s taken with an intense need of having him come all over himself.
“Colonel James Rhodes.”
“Full name?”
Some sexy times occur ;)
He glances at Steve’s suit, and Steve finds himself blushing harder. He knows his suit probably looks cheap next to all those expensive clothes.
“I’m not alone,” said Jan, though her smile was brittle. “I have friends among the fairies.”
What had he been thinking, drawing someone in such an intimate moment? He doubts Tony would ever want that drawing. Who would want a drawing of themselves jerking off and fingering themselves? What had Steve been thinking, seriously?
Tony’s cum has dried up on their skin. It should be gross and uncomfortable, but Steve doesn’t mind. Tony picks up his clothes.
“There’s light in your flat,” notices Tony as they get out of the car, and he looks hesitant.
“What? What is it? Do I smell?”
“Look. Wanda and her brother were very young and traumatized when they enrolled with Strucker. That’s why we decided to give them a chance, didn’t we? And then the kid died. So we took in Wanda, and gave her a new home, a new life with the Avengers. I stepped back. For personal reasons, sure, but not only. I wanted to give her space, because her trauma was linked to me, whether it was the bomb that took her family, or Ultron himself. I thought naively that she would be taken cared of. I didn’t really check on her because… well, having my mind played with wasn’t something I was recovering well from.”
“Good bye, Tony,” said Steve, watching him as Tony let himself slide down the braid.
Steve tried to shook the images of her out of his head. He didn’t manage to. His throat constricting, he managed to parrot his therapist;
“No! No way, I’m not letting you leave in this state!” protested Steve, trying to approach him again.
She looks him over appreciatively, and smiles wider, hands letting go of Steve so as to pat his golden suit’s sleeves.
Tony stepped back, schooling his snarling face into one of his impassive masks.
He carefully reaches for Tony’s chest. He hadn’t noticed the scars the first time, probably because of the shirt at first, and then because he had taken Tony from behind. However, he had drawn them, though it was only when he had worked over the drawing again that he had noticed. Now, he can see them, the long scar over his heart, and the little ones scattered around it. It looks awfully like scars from shrapnel. Bucky has the same ones, hell, Steve has some on his back too. He traces the long, rosy scar with his finger, gently.
Tony joined her to the counter as she pulled out a heavy book, opening it and searching for a pot of ink and a quill.
Tony and Steve meet :)
“Oh look at you, Little Iron Man, aren’t you more sensible now? You know there’s no escape. What, did you really think you could hunt me down?”
“Be my guest,” moans Steve, and then Tony pushes himself off him. Steve spreads his legs and Tony sits between them, lubes up his fingers and opens him up carefully, watching him all the while. It’s embarrassing and unnerving, and Steve hides his face with his arm as Tony draws out of him higher whines.
Tony nodded (lied), avoiding his eyes and focusing on the tray. Mrs Arbogast was spoiling him: there wasn’t only a bowl of stew there, but also bread, cheese, a small cup of warm honeyed wine, and a blueberry tartlet. His stomach decided then that Tony had wallowed in starvation and despair enough, and it loudly clamored its hunger. Arnie laughed. Shrugging, Tony dug in. Eating a warm meal did make him feel a little better.
Tony freed his wrists, and slipped his hands under Steve’s clothes, feeling with delight the bare skin of Steve’s jutting hips, then the small of his back, the firmness of his ass cheeks. He couldn’t help groping him, and Steve gasped, the sound going straight to Tony’s rapidly growing erection. Steve snaked his hands around his waist, and pressed himself against him, his own hardness fitting perfectly against Tony’s, his hands exploring Tony’s back and digging into his shoulder blades. He sucked on Tony’s tongue, swallowing his moans, and started a slow, sensuous swing, rocking against Tony in a way that made their erections press and slide together.
“Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, sugar, ah,” is moaning Tony, barely muffled by the pillow he’s burying his face into. Steve looks up and watches, mesmerized, the play of Tony’s muscular shoulders as he moves in time with Steve’s thrusts, arching his back and undulating his hips in a smooth, gracious move Steve had never seen before in any of his previous partners.
“Is it normal?” Tony asked, his voice quiet. “Here, is that considered normal? For a man to have another man as his partner?”
There was a sharp pain in Steve’s chest, and there were so many words he had wanted to say that he never got to, and that, he knew now, would only have hurt Tony if he had let them out.
Tony still has a defiant look on his face, but his stance relaxes slowly. He nods in salutation.
“You’ feeling better?” he asked as Tony slowly came back to his senses.
Tony moans, louder, and starts fucking his face, carefully, but so wantonly that Steve feels himself pushed closer and closer to his own release, and knows that he’s leaking. His hands force Tony’s hips down for a moment, just long enough to free his mouth and rasp;
He put the box on the table and opened it, revealing mouth-watering cookies inside. The pot was now steaming with  steam, so Tony took it out from the hearth and put it down on the table, and they sat down together.
on me,” retorted Steve, shaking his head. “I should’ve asked you clearly, not let you get swept in the mood. I should’ve noticed your mind hadn’t caught up with your heart yet. I’m sorry. I was careless and it hurt you.”
It’s perfect.
“What about your godmother?” asked Steve, sitting next to his lover. He was naked, safe for Tony’s cloak, and that was hilarious, so Tony couldn’t help giggling a little.
“Good evening!” called Tony as he entered.
“He’s got hired men in the city? Wait… you said his name is Schmidt, didn’t you? What’s his first name?”
“Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair to me!”
“Back then, when you said you could grant me a wish, you told me you could lead me to the mystery singer. And I took that literally. But that’s not what my wish was about, wasn’t it? If so, you would’ve disappeared as soon as I would’ve met Steve. But you’re still here. My wish… my wish is to be with Steve, isn’t it?”
“What? So back then, you knew I wasn’t a helpless young girl? And that I wasn’t afraid of you? Then you knew I was hunting you, didn’t you? Why did you come and talk with me then? I could have hurt you!”
He took a deep breath, and heard Tony do the same, probably trying to reign his anger in.
“Be my guest,” smirks Steve, arms linking around Tony’s shoulders. The silk of the maroon shirt is deliciously smooth under his skin, and he loves crumpling it, the creases adding to Tony’s sexual, mussed up look.
Tony waved it all away.
His tongue dug in easily, pressed inside of Tony, and Tony’s arms gave in at the shock of pleasure that coursed through his spine up to the bones of his arms. The only thing still holding his rear up was now the wolf-man, his hands gripping his hips with an implacable strength. The tongue delved in deeper, and Tony whined, bucking his pelvis back into the face of the man pleasuring him.
Joseph looked at the garden, and saw the most fresh and green rampions he had ever seen, its leaves shimmering silver under the light of the moon.
And Steve was a man.
“You tried to kill Bucky.”
“Yeah, I get you’re full of money, but I don’t want that,” says Steve, in his decisive voice, the one his friends jokingly called the Captain Tone.
He watches him wrapping his left hand around his hardening member, head falling back on the pillow with a deep sigh that makes Steve’s blood sing with arousal. He watches as Tony’s sex fully hardens in his own grip and flushes a darker color.
“Arnie, show Mr Stark to his room, will you?”
“You should go,” sighed Steve, looking bleak himself.
But Gorgeous, over there, has had those hunks lining up to try and get a piece of him, and he just throws them away like trash. This ass doesn’t know how lucky he is, or maybe he’s so arrogant that he has ridiculously high standards. That wouldn’t surprise Steve, coming from a rich-looking handsome guy.
“I don’t presume you would do that from the kindness of your heart?”
“But you… you know it wasn’t Bucky’s fault! You said so yourself! You even fought alongside Bucky! You… you even helped gathering evidence of his brainwashing for his trial! I don’t understand… Tony?”
Once upon a time, in a village near the forest, was a young man who was beloved by everyone. His real name was Tony, but he was more often called Little Iron Man, on account of his wonderful skills as a blacksmith and of his short height. He always had on a cloak with a hood, gold and fire-colored, which was given to him by Jan, the village dressmaker. She thought it would bring him good luck, for she had made it of a ray of sunshine -or so she said-. And as the good bubbly young girl was considered something of a fairy, everyone thought the hood rather enchanted too.
“I know what a het is, thank you very much. And I’ve noticed. I’m here on purpose.”
“Where are you going so early, Little Iron Man?”
. Now, it finally made sense to him why, among his friends, Tony had always been the most sought-out for sexual favors. He’d never been one to say no to a pretty face or a nice character, nor had he bothered to over-think the situation, so he had been easy to be with. There were only two times Tony could remember feeling unease, and it were occurrences he had deliberately tried to forget about; Tony had never much liked Tiberius Stone, though they were supposed to be childhood friends. Their fathers had been competitors, each of them running a forge, and so their competitive streak had been passed over to their sons. Tiberius and Tony hadn’t hated each other though, and they had ‘helped each other out’ a few times. It hadn’t been a big deal. Tony had done it all the time with his friends.
“Yes.”
It’s been a while since Steve has wanted to give a blowjob. He isn’t very fond of the idea, usually. But right now, he wants to, really wants to, and he shivers with lust and arousal as he wraps his lips around Tony’s erection, takes it in his mouth and starts bobbing his head up and down, hearing Tony’s breath hitch and morph into moans, feeling his legs shivering around his waist, his fingers burying into Steve’s hair and gently pulling on it. Steve lets him take control, lets him guide his head up and down. He takes hold of Tony’s hips and encourages him to move, too, to buck up into his mouth.
The bathroom door is open. The floor is wet and the mirror steamed up, but Tony isn’t there. He isn’t in the bedroom either. His coat and jacket are missing from beside Steve and Bucky’s coats. His shoes are missing too.
“Sorry, sorry!” said Tony, holding his hands up. “I heard you sing, earlier, and you had the voice of a woman. It was beautiful, really!”
“Like you don’t do repeats?”
“There isn’t, not even on the other side. Don’t move, Tony! Here comes the sorcerer!”
“I can’t. If I flee, Schmidt will go to my village and hurt the people. My parents. My friends. Everyone. No one deserves to suffer in his hands because of me. He’s a cruel and dangerous sorcerer. Which, again, makes me question why you’re here. Do you have a death wish?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Everything you’re willing to give, I want. Will you join me in bed?”
“Good night, Tony! If you need to get to the tower again, just call for me. I’ll be there.”
“We could be friends, yeah. In some alternate reality where he didn’t brutally murder my mom, we could. Please, please
“Let me get the Hell out of here, Steve!” screamed Tony, turning over and grabbing Steve by the shoulders, shaking him like a rag doll.
Steve stopped, realizing for the first time how severe was the grief Tony was holding in, and realizing how naive he had been to think that Tony acknowledging Bucky as a victim of Hydra as well as the tool of the murder rather than the murderer himself, that Tony acknowledging that would fix his pain. Somehow, Steve still believed in great tragedies and romances, stories like the one of El Cid, who killed doña Jimena’s father, and still got to get happily married to her. Either Jimena actually hadn’t loved her father at all, or the whole story was bullshit, realized Steve, because there was no way you could still love someone that much after they killed your beloved family. Forgiving was one thing, but loving?
Tony sobs quietly in pleasure, and Steve kisses his tears.
“I sing with my mind, not my body.”
“Enough, enough,” is gasping Tony, “I’m too close.”
“I just don’t like it,” smiles Steve, though inside he isn’t smiling, because he can’t help thinking of his drunk of a father.
She keeps parading him around, presenting him to so many people he can’t keep on, until she pushes him right into a circle of three persons; he recognizes Ms Potts, looking absolutely splendid in a golden dress that compliment her long, flaming hair set free on her naked shoulders. Next to her is a tall, imposing-looking colonel, his uniform pristine, the decorations shining on his chest, dark soul-searching eyes, high cheekbones and dark skin. The third man has his back to them, and is dressed in a …golden suit, which should look ridiculous but absolutely isn’t, and the suit hugs him in all the right places, and his nape is familiar, his black wavy hair so so familiar, and he turns around and smiles and God it’s Tony Stark, of course it’s Tony Stark.
He’s heading back to the city, chatting happily, his body swaying in time with Dummy’s lazy gait. Steve’s laugh comes from behind him, and when Tony turns, grinning, Steve is there, riding Butterhooves. He’s all smirking lips and fond azure eyes, his face flushed from the fresh air and the sun, his strong bony hands shaking delicately Butterhooves’ bridle. There she goes, starting a cheerful trot, and she passes by Tony who splutters indignantly and spurs on Dummy with his heels. Dummy snorts, and ignores him, and Steve is laughing, Butterhooves huffing with mischief.
“You mean, you’re one of those guys who have their balls removed?” gasped Tony, gaping at him.
This was real life indeed. A bright sun, just like in Wakanda, and all could Steve do, just like back there, was grieve his friendship with Tony, and grieve his unrequited love that would forever remain a dirty secret to carry to his tomb.
“You know it isn’t. Thanos…”
On Christmas Eve, Bucky and him invite their closest friends for dinner. There’s Natasha, who looks like an actress with her ethereal figure, perfect features and gorgeous red hair. She’s a friend from their short time in the army, and she nows work for the CIA, or the FBI, or maybe she’s a spy -she doesn’t really tell, and they never dared ask her, because behind her sweet smiles and doe eyes, she can be vicious and very scary-. She brings along her neighbor’s children, the twins Wanda and Pietro, because they deserve a happy Christmas despite their mother’s drinking. Steve relates to that all too much and is always happy to welcome them in his home.
It takes a while before they can catch their breath, and Steve is tempted to use his inhalator for a moment, but he’s lying spent in Tony’s arms and doesn’t have the strength to move.
Tony swatted his hands away and bolted up.
“Yeah? It’s still mainly your fault. I did a mistake in trying to keep you all away from the shit storm, but it doesn’t excuse you from having deliberately ignored politics and the real world.”
“Well, you’re the one who sticks to calling me a beast. I’m sure you could be more creative too,” grumbled Steve.
Not to mention that they were making quite a lot of noise, what with his working gear and scraps his second mule was carrying. Tony annoyingly looked over his shoulder when he felt her pull on her bridle, and groaned when he saw that she had slipped again.
“Seriously? I’m pretty sure your mirror praises you enough. Don’t need me to flatter you too. So, really, what’s your type? I know pretty much everybody here, we’re mostly regulars, so I could point you to someone.”
, have lied to anyone the way you did to me, nor would I have fuckin’ hit them in the face repetitively with a fuckin’ shield!”
Tony shivers as Steve runs his hands over his skin. Steve pauses, watches him. Tony’s on all fours just as he asked him, his head hanging down, forehead pressing against the pillow and damp hair sticking on his nape, sweat gathering in the small of his back, lube glistening and sliding down his spread thighs. He’s breathing loudly, he  must be thinking that Steve is too much of a tease.
“How do these look like a dress to you?! Of course I’m not a girl!”
“Okay, sure, whatever you want sugar,” Tony laughs, taking a condom from Steve. He rips the packet open, grinning; “Com’ere. I wanna blow you.”
“I understand,” he said again, his voice raw. “I understand when you say you were unwell and that you spiraled out of control. I even understand why you didn’t tell me about… about, you know... even if I wish you had told me, I understand how time stretches and blends into an unstoppable spinning top when your mind isn’t okay. And then… you think you have time, but before you realize it, it’s been months, it’s been years, and nothing’s changed, you’re still stuck in the mud trying to drag yourself out to sanity. So yeah, I wish you had told me, but I understand why you didn’t… What I don’t understand… what I really
Finally, they start shivering in the room, the sweat coating their bodies making them cold, so Steve carefully pulls out and frees them both from the soiled condoms. He reaches for tissues and wipes the lube leaking from Tony, making them both snicker like teenagers. Tony opens his arms for him again, and Steve settles against him, nestling his face in the space between his neck and his torso. He pulls the covers over the both of them, and they’re asleep in seconds.
“Tony, meet Toro,” said Steve, grinning. “Toro, thanks for waking up. You already saw Tony the other day, I noticed you spying on us.”
“Is it okay if I use the shower?” he asks quietly.
“Does your underwear match your suit? I’ve never seen golden underwear.”
A few beats.
“Isn’t this a sight,” rumbled the werewolf. “You’re all smooth. From your shins to your thighs, even right here,” he purred as he gave a long lick in the exposed cleft of Tony’s buttocks. “You were just craving for it, weren’t you, bitch? You want a cock up your ass so badly you’ve prepared yourself, all clean and smooth, all loose and soft.”
“Your place or mine?” he asks.
“You didn’t smell of bloodthirst,” smiled, shyly, Steve. “I was curious about you. And you didn’t hurt me.”
Fingers twirled Tony’s nipple one last time, making him gasp. Steve’s thumb slipped back into his mouth, sliding on his tongue, and Tony sucked it gently. Other fingers trailed down his stomach and he heard his belt unbuckling, felt his now uncomfortably tight pants finally open and free his erection, cold air hitting in for a second before light fingertips landed on his sensitive skin and trailed up his length, fingers slicking themselves on the tip with the first beads of his seed before wrapping firmly around his sex.
Immediately the golden rope fell down and Tony noted, a bit weirded out, that it was indeed made of blond hair. He started to climb up. To be honest, he almost gave up after the few first feet, for the climb was long and exhausting, but Jan kept needling him and making jabs at his pride, so in the end Tony climbed it all and finally reached the window, panting like a dying ox. A pair of strong, bony hands took hold of his, and he was pulled up into the tower.
named
Nat spots him.
“To my godmother Peggy,” replied curtly Tony, walking faster, but the werewolf matched his speed with ease.
“Maybe.”
“Tony, Tony, I didn’t… You know I fought you back because I couldn’t let you kill Bucky! I’ve never hated you. And I’m so sorry I had to disable the main reactor from the suit, knowing that it used to be life support for you, but I really had no other choice.”
Tony couldn’t tear his eyes off Steve’s azure ones.
He watches his cock going in and out of Tony as he thrusts into him, and picks up the pace once he feels Tony’s tightness giving in and relax. It’s easier to fuck him now, and he thrusts faster, deeper, trying different angles.
Hope you enjoyed! Kudos and comments are loved. Don't hesitate to tell if you've spotted some mistake in my English, or if I missed a tag. Next chapter in a few!
“Seems to me common sense hasn’t left you yet, then. There’s still hope for you,” he smirks, going for dry humor.
Then.
Steve’s fingers slip inside. He leans in, kisses Tony on the mouth, swallows his soft whine as he starts massaging his prostate.
She stopped, and waved him good-bye.
“What do you mean, ‘shielding us from stressful stuff’?”
and you have absolutely
Thor stirs and yawns.
“God, Tony, you came so hard, you were gorgeous,” he rasped, looking very proud of himself, and surging forward to kiss Tony lightly on the lips.
For Tony, who had been used by so many people, who had been left again and again, whose godfather had tried to kill him, whose longtime girlfriend had almost given up on them, whose teammates had stabbed in the back… those words would only hurt him further.
“Look, if you’re trying to get me to stay, don’t. I’m old and tired. I’m done with being Iron Man, it has nothing to do with leaving you all, though I can’t say I’m very sorry about that.”
“After Ultron… well, I needed time for myself, to deal with… everything. Barton retired, too, and Bruce had just…vanished. You and Nat were putting up a new team. Pepper and I were trying to be in a serious relationship. So I let the Iron Man job to War Machine, and you and I divided the leadership, remember? You were to lead the team, train it, go on missions, all the Avenging stuff, while I dealt with government goons, fund raising, media, damage control, and charity. Well, what I didn’t expect, was the amount of guilt and stress. We were receiving so much hate, you have no idea. Some of us were still fragile, still in grief, still mourning…”
Tony obeys. They’re still holding hands. Steve licks his nipple, presses a finger down his ass.
? Are you fuckin’ kidding me?” snapped Tony, his voice a ugly sneer.
Deep from its breast, the beast rumbled in a human-like voice;
Tony’s looking at him with eyes so bright, and Steve realizes that he’s on the verge of tears.
“Well, this is already ending in heartbreak,” said Steve. “Because I’m already gone for you.”
Tony looked at him, still rattled, as if suddenly scared by this show of trust, and then he reached out and embraced him tightly, burying his face in Steve’s chest.
“I figured,” whispers Steve.
“Oh, really? Hearing you all talk all the time about Ross, I’d thought it was an USA-only thing. Thank you for clearing that up for me, Rogers.”
He closes the wiki page, feeling sick. He had hoped to be at least a good memory. Now, he’s left wondering why Tony is even bothering with buying his art.
Tony is still looking at the paintings. It’s a bit strange that he’d stop in the middle of their heated kissing, only to look at Steve’s worthless work. Then he turns around and inhales deeply, eyes closed, and laughs. Steve stills, unsure of he’s being mocked -he isn’t-. Tony opens his eyes and sits down on the bed, grinning, and hooks his fingers in Steve’s waistband, pulling him toward him.
, used my shit as an excuse to ghost the people around me. And I would’ve never,
Tony tries pulling out of his embrace, but Steve holds him, and Tony, while stronger than him, doesn’t seem to have the heart to physically push him away.
The drawing is beautiful, though. And Steve feels his guts twisting and warming, feels himself hardening. He closes his eyes, trying to chase the image, but all it does is making the image come alive behind his eyelids, Tony’s scent -expensive cologne, iron and musk- filling up his nostrils, his throaty voice and moans echoing in his ears.
Times like these, thought glumly Tony as he stepped over stinging nettles and brambles, careful not to catch his long skirt with the barbs. He didn’t want to cross Jan, who had kindly tailored a female dress just for him. God, Tony loved her. She was his best female friend (Rhodey, the head of the militia, was his best male friend).
“Oh God, no!
As Tony buttoned back his shirt, Steve asked;
Tony’s hips bucked up. He moaned deeply, pushing into the slick, warm embrace of Steve’s hand. Steve moved to bestride him, his knees pressing against Tony’s hips. He freed his thumb from Tony’s mouth and embraced him, his arm wrapping securely around him, his hand splayed on the small of his back. Still gazing into Tony’s eyes, forehead against his, Steve smiled, gently and adoringly, whispering;
! My private parts are perfectly fine! Can’t you hear I have a deep voice when I speak?”
After a while, they finally calm down, and Steve stands to get the drawing. He can see how Tony fidgets, how he’s getting nervous. He probably doesn’t want to see the drawing at all. Steve offers it to him, and waits.
“That sounds lonely,” murmured Tony.
“Did you just come?” he murmurs.
He worked all day, and the day after. On the third day of his stay, he still hadn’t stopped thinking about Steve -especially since Steve’s mother, Mrs Rogers, had come by to bring him a caved-in cooking-pot. Tony was but a mere tinkerer -he was essential for the villagers, but it didn’t mean he was payed that much-. It meant that he couldn’t afford long breaks, especially since he was paying for a room and meals at the inn, as well as the stables and the food for his mules. However his desire to see Steve again was too strong, so he closed shop on midday, took Dummy out of the stables, and headed for the dark woods.
True to his word, Tony came back two days later. By then, he was nearly done with his tinkering, and had only a day left of work. He was planning to visit Steve one last time after his departure from the village. As he followed Jan through the woods, chatting happily with her, Dummy shook his long ears and straightened them, listening intently in front of him, and Tony and Jan fell silent as their ears picked on, too, the charming notes of Steve’s singing.
“Huh,” says Tony, and he looks down into his lap, where he’s been fidgeting and worrying his nails.
“Tony… you do know you smell of maleness, right?”
Steve kisses the top of his head and his arm tightens its hold around Tony’s waist as he guides him back to bed. They sit together.
Tony’s staring at him with wide eyes. Steve’s throat is hurting and all closed-up and there are traitorous tears spilling out of his eyes.
“That’s your excuse? Really? That’s all? ‘I was depressed, boohoo, I didn’t mean it’?
“How about you? I can’t lose you!” protested Tony, looking up.
“Hi, Mr Rogers,” says Ms Potts, holding her hand out for him to shake. He shakes it mechanically. He feels like his whole body is shaking. “Your paintings are making quite a hit. I’m very happy for you, and it’s going to be very good for the charity, too,” she says, her voice kind and comforting.
. Steve who had already so much on his plate, who had a life so pitiful… Steve who didn’t deserve to have Tony throw his insecurities and emotional turmoils at him, Steve who had been so gentle and loving to him only to have Tony push him away and treat him like his tormentor.
Another rustle, and then two luminescent eyes peered at him from the darkness, and Tony stopped, his fingers digging in the osier of his basket with a sharp snap. Smoothly, the leaves parted away in a whisper, letting the beast step out. It was a wolf so big its withers easily reached Tony’s waist. Powerful muscles rolled under the thick gray fur. The eyes, a piercing ice-blue, were shining with awareness. The wolf circled him, its tail slowly swishing from one side to another. Its chops curled up, revealing pointed, deadly fangs, its red tongue uncoiling from its mouth like one of Jan’s ribbons.
“Sorry, Bambi, I think I caught a cold,” lied Tony, rubbing his red eyes (it was a good thing the room was dark, so at least Mrs Arbogast wouldn’t see he had cried).
“Get off!” he cried out, trying to writhe out from under the morphing creature.
“Tony, you awake? I’ve got stew for you.”
Natasha studies him in silence, and then shrugs, turning away and heading back into the living-room;
And then a small brunette takes his arm and pulls him towards the balcony, grinning and eyes sparkling. Her fingers around his arm are small and delicate. She’s dressed with perfect taste, her clothes, golden charcoal, vapory and custom-made.
Steve pushes him and escapes from his embrace, quickly taking off his coat and pullover and hanging them. He takes Tony’s coat and jacket from him, hangs them both next to his. Bucky’s coat isn’t there, so Steve knows he has some time before Bucky comes home, which is good; quiet sex isn’t as fun.
“Yes, yes, please Steve, I want you, everything you want, I’ll give you.”
It works. Tony is finally fully relaxed, and he leans on his left elbow, supporting his chin in his palm, as he smirks back at Steve.
“Are you not coming for supper, then?” she inquired, gently.
“Well at least wear a sign or something, ‘cause they’re going to keep going for you and you’re obviously uncomfortable with it,” says Steve, fighting to keep the aggressiveness he feels out of his voice.
, and he doesn’t know what he’s saying, and all he can think of is the maroon silky thong that matched Tony’s shirt, and…
Steve grinned, and leaned in to peck his mouth, which never failed to make Tony blush, so Tony busied himself in unwrapping the cake, taking hold of the dagger so as to cut it into slices. Steve bunched up his skirt, uncovering his legs, and fingered his stockings once more.
Steve texts Peggy not to look for him, Tony calls his own chauffeur, and they find themselves sitting in the back of Tony’s expensive car in an awkward silence. Thankfully, the ride doesn’t last for too long.
Steve nodded. He wouldn’t deny it. He had to face the fact that he, Captain America, had acted like the bullies he had sworn to fight, and he had to make sure he would never do so again.
They’re all lying around in the couch and the bean bags, like a pile of  hamsters. Thor is snoring loudly, Jane snuggled against him. Darcy, Pietro and Bucky are yelling stuff. Nat has her feet on Maria’s lap, and Wanda is curled up in a bean bag, eyes glued to the television. Pietro is lying directly on the carpet, his back against Bucky and Darcy’s legs, and Darcy, while arguing with the two boys, is weaving thin braids into his hair. Sam isn’t there; he has probably left to join his family’s dinner.
“How do you want it?” asks Steve, pulling his fingers off and watching the lube drip down.
“Jan, Janet Van Dyne? I’m a designer, actually, I’m THE designer!”
scream and holler like a wolf in heat.”
prepared himself beforehand, and his muscles were all soft and yielding-, and Steve’s fingers easily found his pleasure spot -practice did make perfect, laughed inwardly Tony, thinking back of how long it had taken him the first time, nudging around while Tony was squirming around in discomfort-.
him! That’s
Tony writhed a little more, his heart thundering in his chest and warmth spreading through his guts. His fingers dug into the grass.
Tony waited for the Red Skull to climb down and leave, and when the sorcerer finally did and left the glade, disappearing into the dark forest, Tony went to the tower and called out, imitating the Red Skull’s voice and silly accent, and all the while feeling utterly stupid from doing so;
“Yeah. Um, I hope the smell of the paint is okay with you?”
“Don’t call him slutty,” snaps Steve, frowning.
But… once, Tiberius had pushed Tony’s hand away and asked him if he could ‘use his thighs’ instead. Tony had seen no reason not to, so he’d let him. Tiberius had pushed him against the mattress, his grip firmly maintaining Tony’s thighs closed, and he’d rutted into him, his erection sliding in the tight crease between Tony’s thighs. Tony could still remember how hot his own body felt, Tiberius’ puffs of warm breath on his nape, his groans, the strength of his masculine body pinning him down, the hardness of his sex sliding between Tony’s thighs, while at the same time teasing the crease of his arse on each slide, and then hitting dead on his scrotum. Tony had been aroused as Hell, painfully hard, and hadn’t been able to get himself off since he was being pinned on the mattress, and he had muffled his moans in his pillow. Eventually Tiberius had come all over him which had made Tony very angry, but not angry enough that he wouldn’t push Tiberius off so as to roll on his back and furiously get himself off. He had come hard, harder than ever maybe. He hadn’t questioned it. Any man with his balls being teased like that would get aroused, he had thought. It had been a perfectly normal physical reaction. He hadn’t been attracted to Tiberius, nor had he felt hot because of the situation rather than the stimuli -no.
(Even with a glimpse, it was easy to identify-the scene was from
“Cut the mood lighting.”
Natasha’s smile settled into the crinkles of her eyes, a colourless drop leaking out the side and vanishing into the curve of her cheek. Her voice was ever-so-slightly hoarse, and in that moment more tempting than any Black Widow act she’d ever put on. “You can keep this, if you want. Keep all of this.”
And Sam turned, because he’d done the best he could, and time was running out and Steve was in danger, and he could do nothing about either those things but Stark could and
. His expression didn’t change in the slightest.
His legs stopped. Steve didn’t know why, so he raised his head.
Steve could not move his fingers. They twitched a little, but stayed firmly wrapped around, entwined through the scratched-up, faded metal fingers of an Iron Man gauntlet.
the last link that Steve had left back to his world- but not once had Steve ever felt the deliberate urge to maim, or even blame. For that last battle…if nothing else, he himself had been at fault. He could accept that, and accept Tony’s reaction, and do the best he could to stop him from doing something that would hurt Tony almost as much as it would hurt him.
(Plus, there’s got to be a carbon dating joke he can make somewhere.)
“Which means its eight am, which is breakfast time for healthy people.” There were still scattered white bits though. That didn’t mean those parts were uncooked, were they? He seemed to recall having white eggs in the past that were fairly cooked. Still. A bit more frying probably wouldn’t hurt. “And before you ask- yes, I’ve finished all my work and am positively ravenous.”
Silence.
“You were.” The words came, quiet and certain. Tony stopped and looked at the teenager with the ducked head, face still ruddy with embarrassment but with a curious steadiness to the gaze that had convinced Tony in the first place, that very first time. Peter met his eyes like it was the last thing he wanted to do, but like he wouldn’t drop it for the world. “I don’t understand superhero politics, Mr. Stark. I don’t know what exactly was going on at Leipzig, but I knew that you needed to stop Captain America from leaving. Badly enough that you’d recruit a sixteen-year-old to help you.”
“Are you going to say anything?”
(Sometimes, when Steve jerked awake from sleep, it was like the hum had grown loud enough to bore through his skull; swarming through the passages of his brain like buzzing bees till it all exploded-blood and tissue smattering the walls).
The New York birds are cawing the place down, the streets are clogged and pollution hangs in the air like a cheerful fuck you to every fresh morning walk cliché he’s ever heard of. Still, they’ve got newly made bagels in their hand, the air is free of the stink of villainy, and he’s attempting to explain his fucked up thinking processes to another human being. Things can’t be that bad.
