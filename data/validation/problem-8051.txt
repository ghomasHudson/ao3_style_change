He had loved Tony Stark, the soldier thought, since the moment their lips met. He would love Tony Stark, the soldier knew it as a fact, until the day he died.
He wanted to hear it back.
And yet...
He had thought that maybe just Rhodey and Pepper would be his pack and he was content. Then Natasha came along and with her cunning smile and her mysterious ways, she wormed a way into his metal heart. She made a chink in his armor and Fury and Agent exploited it, bust it right open for the rest. His armor was in shambles after them. Then Bruce came along and then Thor and Clint and he never had a chance to say no.
God! Steve was so beautiful that Tony was sure that somewhere in the world, it should be a crime. Sometimes... - And only sometimes, mind you! - he would lose minutes on end just admiring the super-soldier. He'd stare, thoroughly entertained by his most mundane activities; his gentle smile and the enthusiastic brightness of his blue eyes; the way his tongue stuck out ever so slightly when he was concentrating too hard; how he lovingly stroked his finished sketches; how he'd blush when given a compliment… It was too beautiful for words.
He wanted Tony to stop making jokes about having sex with their friends. He wanted Tony to stop calling Bruce and Clint “the love of his life”. He wanted to be the only one that he called “beloved”. He wanted to be his one and only.
Tony was half passed out on the Captain’s lap, slipping channels on the television, trying to decide what they should watch as they nursed their food babies (his words, not Steve’s) and Steve was patting untamed hair, trying to get it just right.
“Come on, sweetheart.” Again, that hot tease. “I know you have it in you.” Warm lips ran down his spine and Steve clenched around those ember-like fingers as he all but screamed Tony's name. “Yes, sweetie. Come on. Don't you want me to fuck this sweet little hole? Don't you want my dick inside your pussy? Come on, sweetheart. I wanna hear ya.”
You see, though they slept together, they never actual slept. Whenever they were done making love, Tony would just… Leave. It hurt. Of course, it hurt but Steve thought he understood. The man was a genius, after all. And he had his own company. And he was a hero. There just weren’t so many hours in the day to do everything he had to do and be with the soldier. So he understood. He did. He just didn’t like it.

And while Baal failed them, God did not fail his messenger.
Tony Stark did not do heats. Never.
Not. One. Bit.
For all his genius, he just couldn’t explain it. Lying on his pillow, he pondered for minutes on end. Waiting and waiting and waiting for the explanation rise from mid-air. Lying, sleeping,
Like clockwork, they came every three months. Sometimes he shared them with Tony. Sometimes he had them alone. They always left him aching. They always left him feeling bad.
Looking at Tony, seeing him smile to the team and make his little jokes, Steve can’t think straight. Maybe. Maybe—It hurt, but maybe that was it, wasn’t it? May he did...  Misunderstand? He really didn’t comprehend this new world all too well. Was this… His fault? Did he read too much into it? It wasn't hard to fall in love with Tony Stark, after all.  It was easy like breathing.
It had been too much. He had been... too much. He had been too open, too vulnerable, too needy, too mad, too uncontrolled, too sad, too lonely-- too. Much. The climb and the fall had taken too much from him and he couldn't do it again. He didn't want to do it again.
(See the end of the chapter for
The fingers within him stilled. The air around them was hot and humid, filled with the sound of his pants and whines. Steve bit his lip again, trying not to move, to squirm, wanting só much that his bones ached.
It wasn't hard to fall in love with Tony Stark.
And in the middle of night, Tony’s fire burned him so intensely that when he left, Steve was only ash. He missed him. In his bed of cinders, he wondered if Tony missed him too.
dreaming… Mere acts that gave importance to the final outcome.
. He had had one when he presented and that had been... too much. It wasn't that his dad had been disappointed in an omega son - though he was -, nor was it how lonely and miserable he had felt when it had come and Tony had been alone - though he had been, desperately so -, or that people tried to use his status against him -though they did, even now -; it was just-- Too much.

to see his beautiful mate heavy with his pups.
He wasn’t the One.
The man was almost biblical in how amazingly attractive he could be. His smile was like the tower of fire that guided Moses beyond Egypt, through the sea and the desert, chasing away the shadows of doubt and loneliness that one could feel in this strange, strange new world. One could pass a lifetime trying to capture that smile and still fail. With his smile… He could make anyone happy. His eyes shined like the light the God Almighty himself, showing his brilliance to the entire world; his mind… What he could create…. It filled every hole that Time left behind with their incandescent glow, chasing away the darkness within. Those eyes, when they gazed at you, they made you feel like you were the only person that mattered in the whole world. Those beautiful brown eyes, flecked with pieces of gold, were one of the most beautiful things Steve had ever seen. It was inspiring, just to see him happy. He was beautiful in the way artists for the Renaissance thought angels would be. It kind of took your breath away. He was proud and fair like Solomon himself. And he knew it. He was funny and he was alive. He was just… He was perfect.
“Yes, my Bomb Pop?” Steve didn’t get the reference but he smiles anyway.
God was great. But, to Steve, Tony was even greater.
He’d still sigh touching the places where only Tony had touched before. His hands kept caressing each new patch of skin revealed as they undressed. Tony guided him to his bed and continued to touch him, running his hands up his abdomen, across his chest, tracing his broad shoulders and trim waist. He just couldn't let go. Steve didn't want him to. It soothed something inside him to have this, so slow and purposeful. It was his first time with anyone and Tony made him feel appreciated, wanted and even... Loved. He stole Steve's breath away with hard kisses and sure touches, pinning him down and riding him so sweet and tight. Their bodies moved like they were made for one another. Touching and kissing. Taking and giving. It felt so right. It was like… It was made to be. They made love many times after that one first glorious time, in so many ways it still got him dizzy just thinking about it and so many places that Steve is quite sure that somewhere in SHIELD there are tapes of them rutting against eachother in almost every office of theirs they have ever been. Tony was just… He was just too good. Too perfect. Steve loved him too much. He never wanted it to end.
It was so much more than he could've hoped or dreamed! He never noticed that there could've been more...
took Tony in all ways known to man before and after their fight and subsequent reconciliation. For hours on end, he had opened the omega's body with his cock again and again, pushing rivers of his seed into him with that sole dream in mind, going mad with the
There was a story he read once in Sunday School, about almost eighty years ago. About faith and flames. Steve thought of that story, now, while he knelt on cold concrete floors, half naked, as his hands were bound behind his back and his body glistened, wet and flushed, beneath the hands of his own personal god. Tony was kneeling behind him, his hot fingers pushing in and out of his hole, whispering the most filthy things against his ears as he stretched the soldier out.
The lack of momentum was even clearer now! He had woken up for some reason or another that he couldn't, and wouldn't even lose a breath to, remember and the warmth and comfort that he had come to grow accustomed was nowhere in the expected arms length. He was all alone on his side of the bed while his partner was on the other, peacefully asleep without a care in the world.
He didn't feel this way when he woke up alone. Or when JARVIS woke him up in the lab. But... Then again, it only worked when it was.... Simultaneous. If he woke up alone, the act returned to the mundane.
Steve was like a moth. He didn't mind burning.
Like an addict. He just needed a little more. Just a little more. To get him through the night.
Steve moaned as he was kissed again. Tony's hands ran over his nipples and he was set ablaze. "I'm charging ah! Extra, then" he said into the kiss.
"Get on your knees, sweetheart." The billionaire requested with his most seductive drawl. His hot lips pressed against the pulse point on the soldier's neck. "I want to see my goods."
So no, it wasn’t hard at all for Steve to love him just for that.
And all the dreams he had since had dwindled down to one. A very important one. It was just within his reach, just like the pack; just like the mate; just like the happiness...
“Oh shuuu, shuuu... Don't you worry, sweetness, I'm gonna fuck it soon enough. I'm gonna tear you open and reshape you. Nobody else will ever be able to satisfy you again. You're gonna have to make me your exclusive sugar daddy so you can cum.” Tony laughed at Steve's distressed moan. “You wanna cum, sweetheart? You want me to pound your tight, greedy hole till it's wrecked? Hm?” He nipped the back of the Captain's neck and Steve shuddered again. “I'm going to have you begging to come.”
He repeated a thousand times in his head, as if his thoughts could wake the other man.
He missed Tony. He missed his light and his smile and the way those eyes shined when Steve remembered a reference the inventor made. Like a moth to a flame, Steve greedily wanted that fire all to himself. He wanted to burn forever and never feel ice again.
And it hurt the soldier more than he could possibly say. In the aftermath of a joined rut of theirs, Steve would fall into what he liked to call a seasonal depression. He would look at Tony's unmarked neck and pain, white and hot, would fill his heart. Omegas tended to cling to their alphas after a heat, for love and protection. But not Tony. Tony was independent and free and lovely.
But when he made love to his omega, he dreamed about a heat they would never share. He dreamed about how Tony's sweet scent would be washed away of the bitterness of oil and burns and become ripe and delicious. He dreamed about mounting the hero, about tasting his overflowing juices and opening his quivering pussy with his hungry mouth. He moaned as he could almost feel Tony orgasm over and over as his slick dripped heavily from Steve's chin as his mouth worked ecstasy into him over and over.
Tony didn't want children. He had said so in passing and in jest many times in the past. He was uneasy with their friends rugrats even as he held them with the outmost care. He scoffed at the idea of being a parent. He took birth control pills and his heat suppressants dutifully and that was the end of that.
(For the rest of his life, he always thought through the cacophony of his body. His heart was drumming madly in his chest as he had to remind himself to breath normally and focus.)
Tony didn't have heats.
"Wait." Tony blinks, as if suddenly realizing what they're really talking about. "W-why? Do you want to?" Those beautiful eyes, so warm and bright, glaze over and that smile that was his… Well, it seemed frozen. "Go full on monogamy?" Is the whispered final response that escapes from his stiff lips.
Tony kisses him sweetly and combs his hair. “Still with me, darling?” He asked, so tender and worried that it warms Steve from head to toe.
And… You see… Though Steve loved Tony with all his might, they hadn’t actually had any conversations about what they were to one another. They had sex, they talked about the world, about life and their interests. They’d made fun of eachother and make silly jokes. Tony would come to his apartment in the Tower and eat dinner or lunch that Steve was preparing. Tony would present him with the XXI century’s idea of music and they’d watch movies together. But Tony would never stay. They never did say “I love you”. They did not sleep in the same bed. They had no label. And don’t get him wrong! Steve loved what they had. It made him… Alive. Alive in a way that he never thought he could again. But he wanted… More.
every time they
He hadn't meant to. Tony sure as hell hadn't known how to respond to his feelings. But he loved Tony Stark and not even heartbreak after heartbreak made that love smaller or weaker.
It would he lazy to say it was because Steve was an alpha... but he wanted it so much, it had to do at least a little bit with instinct.
So yeah...
Steve moaned something that resemble vaguely the other's name and the kiss became even deeper. He heard the ringing of metal in the distance. Cuffs bit into his naked wrists and they came apart.
And even if he dreamed about it from time to time -
The cold hand of worry and doubt began creeping up his chest as the inventor left the gauntlet he had been working on and asked J.A.R.V.I.S to monitor Steve more closely for the next three months and bring up every surveillance he had on his beloved.
un betaed
Steve waited until he was asleep before he clung to the omega and take long, ragged breaths of his scent to know that his omega was still his.
But how in the
Weeks pass and Tony never looks him in the eye again. Sure, he still respects him. Sure they still work together. But Tony isn’t there anymore. He looks his way. He talks at him. Never to him. They are colleagues and nothing more. And… It hurts. It hurts so much. Never to see those eyes or that smile aimed at him again. He misses him so much. But Steve guesses it was his fault. It wasn't hard to fall in love with Tony Stark. But he should have known better. Even if just his presence would make any sane person swoon. Tony is stiff near him and Steve feels guilty. They never said I love you. Tony made him no promises. They never even went on a date. This was his fault. It was all his fault. It wasn’t hard to see. What was hard, though, really, really hard, was to know that Tony Stark didn’t love him.
He took suppressants that blocked any trigger from a rut and so, even when he helped Steve out, he remained himself.
“See you in the morning, Tony …” Steve mumbled.
He fucked his own hand, locked away in his old room and bit white pillows as if they were Tony's slender, tanned neck. He growled and humped and panted as he said all the nasty, fantasies he had to the walls. His pregnant bitch. His beautiful whore. His Tony. He told the walls how much he loved him freely and with all the sap Tony teased him for. He buried his nose in the omega's clothes he managed to gather and rubbed himself raw thinking about the how that scent would change if Tony were pregnant. And when he did manage to fall asleep, he dreamed about Tony purring by his side, happy and loved and exhausted and sated, whispering again that he loved his alpha, that he couldn't wait to be pregnant.
He wanted to cuddle, to feel Tony’s body entwine with his own; the weight of him in the Captain’s arms. Safe in his arms. Protected in his arms. To smell his perfume the first thing in the morning, and see that drowsy smile that filled him with purpose and joy. He wanted to kiss Tony in public and hold his hand. He wanted to be able to present him as his sweetheart. He wanted to take him on a date. He wanted to dance with Tony and feel that same sync they had whn they made love guide their steps.
“Look at you...” The billionaire purred against the shell of his ear, the steam of his warm breath sending shivers down Steve's spine. He almost missed the words entirely, his heart was beating too fast for words. “Oh, sweetheart, you are worth every penny, aren't ya?” Steve moaned and then broke into half a sob as he tried to push himself against Tony. “Oh, sweetie... This perfect body of yours was made to be fucked. God, you are gobbling my fingers up. Such a greedy pussy you've got.” The wet squelch of lube completed the obscene symphony Tony was masterfully playing on his body.
He hadn't noticed it.
Their moans filled the night sky, some times high, others low, broken and shameless. There was nothing else in the world except each other and the darkness. The rich, heavy scent of sex, hot and musky. The tight heat of their bodies meeting and mingling. The loud slick sounds of their thrusts and the moans and groans between them.
He didn't like it.
So, one day, after an intense debate of what the proper toppings a pizza should have and gorging themselves in three different super-sized cheese filled New York giant pizzas, Steve decided to ask.
and Happy birthday to our baby Steve! The sexiest 98 year old around!
He dreamed of Tony round and pregnant. About his changing, growing body. He dreamed about taking care of his omega like he had done after Iron Man's rehab. He dreamed of walking hand in hand with him in department stores and having witty discussions about baby names and clothes. He dreamed about growing pains and long massages. He dreamed about breast milk and drinking it from Tony's growing tits as they made love.
It took them both quite a long time before to come down from their bliss. Steve is a pile of ash beneath Tony's gentle ministrations and he has little in him to protest when he feels the other pull away from him. He knows he'll be pulled right back into his embrace.
The Captain sighed and stretched his strong body before curling up against Tony’s, who, though he loathed to admit and would never do so unless under severe torture, did the same without even thinking twice, somehow touch starved even after hours of touching the man.
He got to his knees and looked up, expectantly. "Like this, mr Stark?" He smiled as Tony did, trying to be suave and charming when all he felt was excitment and need. They were on the roof of the building. So awfully exposed yet so comfortingly kept hidden. This was for them and only for them.
The worshipers of Baal took on the challenge and made it so. They prayed two days and two nights but Baal did not answer them.
It was a game they liked to play. Every once in a while, in a very dull and repetitive gala or similar social event that required them to ditch their battle armor and don suits, they'd... Play.
He was so happy to be able to love and to be loved by Tony. It was a dream. He was so very happy with their found family of friends. It was like home.
He had tried to bring them together, get them both fully bare, flushed cocks free and leaking, rubbing and rutting, kissing and --but Tony had other plans. He wasn't won by pleas or challenges and had been carefully and methodically unmaking for the last... Hour? Night? Millennium? Time seemed so... Meaningless when you burned in those arms.
He took rut suppressants in mission but nothing more. The serum that made him Captain America made him a perfect alpha. It also made immune to alcohol, aging and long working suppressants.
Even though he was content... that dream still burned incandescent inside him. It tore at his soul as he held Clint and Coulson's daughter in his arms or as he walked both his dogs, Gypsy and Danger, in Central Park, where families picnicked happily.
Days pass. Steve tries to talk to Tony again but he's always too busy to talk. He doesn't even stay in the Tower anymore. Or if he does, he leaves no sign of himself that Steve can hold onto. Steve feels like he's trying to track a ghost, feeling the walls for the warmth that came from Tony's particular brand of light.
After what seemed to be hours, at long last, the body on the other side of the bed moved to his side. There was a sigh and then the other was cuddling closer to Tony's chest and he found himself face to face with a sleepy smile from his bed partner.
Nothing had changed around him. His bed was still the same, as were his sheets and pillows… He had certainly not changed one bit. Still handsome as the devil, quick witted and playboy, billionaire, philantropist that made girls quiver and men huff in jealousy; Still the same good ol’ Tony Stark. So why did it persist to warm his heart every time
But Tony loved him. He had said so himself. And they had a family. Even if the Avengers would always be more Tony's family than Steve's, it was his family and that was enough.
"What?" Steve blinks, confused. No. No that doesn't seem right. He's seen people dating.  Feeling a hand clenching his chest, Steve clears his throat and hopes that Tony is just joking. "But I thought-- I thought we... Were..."
“Something happen…?” The soldier's weary voice broke the silence of the night with its care and… Love.
Tony’s reaction, however, is not at all what he expected.  "No one dates in the XXI century, Cap" Tony laughs slightly, leaning against Steve's lap.
- He didn't need them. Not really. He was
How else would he be able to justify that primal need to
But the thing was--
The soldier rubbed his sweaty brow against his lover's shoulder, eyes half open as his body refused to obey. Anyone from the event could come by, and see… And yet, he felt no shame. Everything... Every last resistance had been consumed by those flames. Steve’s face flushed as he pants and moans. He couldn't take it anymore. His own flesh is scorching now, infected by the fire that came from Tony. It seemed only to be still glued to his bones by sheer will power.
He always dreamed of things he could never have.
He wanted to say: “I love you”.
"I payed a pretty penny for your services tonight, sweetheart." Tony leered, his hands moving across the expanse of Steve's chest. "I expect to get my money's worth."
Tony Stark was a flame. His dark eyes had a fire that so little people possessed; a gleam that shone both in madness and allure. His skin was sun kissed, dark in that olive way that made you think of mediterreanian beaches in the summer; of the fullness of life and joy; of libertines and well, on the occasions that there was a lot of skin showing, of sex.
And Tony accepted him. Against all odds, Tony seemed to want Steve by his side! As a friend, by his side… Fighting the good fight against the evils that Steve thought to have killed over seventy years ago. And… As a lover, sharing his bed whenever Tony could spare a moment.
It got stronger now. More than ever. As they mended bridges past and rekindled their relationship. He wanted it in every story he heard about the subject. He needed it with every chance encounter on the street.
His body was so ready to receive, having been teased so long. The girth of Tony's cock was heaven sent and it scorched his skin when it finally fit between his ass. “Tony!” He moaned and those hands slide beneath his hips as the inventor thrust forward, pushing himself fully into Steve in one glorious go.
And then Steve came in like a sledgehammer. And then-- it was gone. Tony was a goner. Everything he thought he could never have because of his rules was right there. He had a pack; a real family he could love, and provide and protect. He had a
And then, when the rut left and Tony came back, he clung to him again and again. He kissed him deeply and thoroughly and Tony seemed so happy that it made the loneliness go away. Tony smiled at him and it made it all ok.
He kissed the almost sleeping soldier once more before relaxing, basking in the intimacy of the moment as Steve sighed again, holding him closer to his heart.
When he was a teen, he dreamed of love. He dreamed that one of the nights Bucky dragged him to dances, there would be his love, waiting for him. He dreamed that, on his way to work, he would bump into them on the trolley. He dreamed that in school, they'd sit together and smile at each other. He lay his head on his mother's lap as she talked about her time with dad and dreamed that one day, he would tell such a happy tale to his own children.
This was supposed to be a one shot but you people (you know who you are) are some smutty, lovely individuals that are to convincing for your own good. so here's your porn, you beautiful people.
That gave Tony pause.
It began, truly, on a Stark Ind. event. Familiar territory and fully discussed in previous days, nights and occasional afternoons. They played their respective parts in the party (Tony, the social butterfly; Steve, the polite soldier) until the playboy looked at him. And it was as if he had never seen him before. A look that weighed him, measured him and found him... Ideal. A look so heated and perfect that Steve felt himself warm even from a distance. The party melted away under that stare.
You beautiful people made me do it. You made me do it and I love you for it.
Tony sighd, smiling. Happy. “Good night, Cap.” He whispered, hugging his lover as tightly as he could.
Mated couples had their cycles sync. It was nature's way of making sure that the couple was always breeding-able together. In society, it meant that the couple was in love. It was a common trope in story telling that everyone loved to believe and it was said that if that sync was broken, your partner was unfaithful to you.
And now he had a dream. It was a recurring on that plagued him even in his waking hours. He tried not to think about it much, given the way his life was headed... but it wouldn't give way.
Steve moaned loudly as he felt the pads of those fingers caress and prod his sweet spot, his spine curving beautifully as he shuddered and panted against the solid heat that was Tony Stark's body. There bodies slided together in the most sinful way, like two flames becoming one, and Steve just wants more. Just... More. His blue eyes seemed sown shut as he tried to keep some semblance of the part he was playing but he couldn't find the strength anymore.
“Nah … Just thinking about something … ” Tony answered, shrugging as his hair was caressed by the super soldier. He smiled freely in the darkness, feeling sleep quickly returning with Steve's gentle touch, along with a strange sense of safety and ‘
It was so bizarre. Waking up had always been something so mundane. Like, a simple event passing through the daily routine that disappeared with the many other urgent issues to be resolved throughout the day. Superfluous, really. But now? Now waking up was a unique event, special and very scary. How could something that a mere month ago was like breathing - vital, but completely ignorable - could have changed so much?
“Aye-Aye, Captain …” He finally said, kissing the lips that had him hooked, closing his eyes. Steve chuckled, kissing his temple and like Archimedes himself, the answer came to him like lightning through his brain.
And then, like a silent bidder, Tony nodded. And Steve Rogers was bought.
The messenger ordered that his pile of wood be doused three times with water and then, and only then, did he pray.
. It was weird. He'd always thought that his story was gonna be a lonely one. But here was a twist.
Tony was his flame.
So he had ruts regularly.
was Tony going to get it?!
woke up with lazy arms around Tony's waist in the morning? Why?Hm?
. It felt like he was meant to be doing just that.
Steve doesn’t know what he did wrong. It wasn't hard to fall in love with Tony Stark. Tony smiled at the world and the world fell in love with him. It was inevitable.
"Yeah." He sighed, ever so satisfied, dark eyes gleaming with that alluring flame. Scalding hands touched his face. "I got to write your parents a thank you letter later, sweetheart." He said, running his fingers through Steve's hair. "Gotta thank them for the good job on this face." Tony pulled his head up by the hair. But, before he could protest... There was a filthy kiss next as those hands got busy and undressed the captain, lathering his flesh with their heat.
Stick around for the next chapters of our saga of tease and here's a small spoiler: Porn is coming. Yay!
Tony thought, breathless to that sweet face.
The twist was that, with all the chaos and madness and new leases of life, he had actually found
Ok, here's the thing: When he was a child, he had dreams. He had dreams that mommy and daddy wouldn't fight. He had dreams that dad would be proud of him. He had dreams about having a happy family. But the thing was... They were just dreams.
What he didn't know was that Tony recorded him in his ruts. He didn't know the recordings came with sound too.
He wasn’t special.
How did it go again? Once upon a time, a messenger of God confronted the worshipers of Baal who were leading Israel astray. He challenged them in the name of God, saying that Elohim was so powerful he could send fire from the sky and set ablaze the wettest wood.
“Well, you’re all tense…" Steve complained, cuddling closer. "Pretend it didn’t happen and go back to sleep. Pepper said she'd do unspeakable things to me with a rusty spoon if there were bags under your eyes.” Tony had to laugh softly and nod, not even fighting the urge anymore to snuggle against Steve because... because it felt
had sex? Or the clench in his heart as he saw beautiful families on the street, so happy and at peace?
But Tony went beyond just the simple platonic musings of thawed super soldier. Steve wanted to be in his life. After almost a century lost, a man has little to hold onto. It hurt to admit it but it was true. Whatever life he had, whatever dreams he had dreamed… They were gone. They died with him in the ice. Nothing was familiar to the Captain in this new world. Everything had changed too much. Everything, that is, except the name “Stark”. So… Steve held on to him. Like a drowning man holds on to a life preserver in the middle of a storm, praying to God that the waves would cease and the thunder would stop. Everything was so loud and so chaotic! It was a wonder to him that anything got done. So hot and confusing! He’d get lost on even concepts that were now norms. So he held on tight and tried his hardest to get to know this beautiful person that only knew of him, of Steve Rogers, because of a long dead friend. After all, without a safe haven, no ships can sail; no life can grow; no soldier can fight. If he was going to fight for something in this strange new world, it might as well be for this shining light that erased, even if for a while, his own darkness.
Maybe he burned too quick. He wasn’t as interesting to Tony as Tony was to him. He was just Captain America, collector’s item number one. An interesting bed fellow to talk about in the future. Or maybe… Maybe it never was meant to be? He had read in past of such loves. Passing things that change you and leave. Maybe that’s what he was. Maybe he was like a shooting star in Tony’s sky, bright and quickly forgotten. The thought hurt, though. He didn’t want that. He just—Well… Whatever it was, he’s been burned too deep. The mark of Stark is now forever engrained in his heart. It stings everytime he sees Tony with some new girl or boy, smiling that bright charming smile of his and looking at them like they were his number one gal. Ash bleeds out of his heart every night, alone in cold (so cold) sheets.
“It can be from the both of us,” Tony said, slyly watching his husband from the corner of his eyes. He couldn’t help but grin as he added, “It’ll be the first gift we give as a married couple so we can sign it together…you can even sign it as ‘Pops’.” Tony playfully bumped into Steve’s side as his super soldier blushed happily.
(See the end of the chapter for
In Steve’s mind, he saw a glimpse of the future Peter and Wade, standing together, hand-in-hand, gazing at each other with love. Steve never told his son what awaited him in his future, but Steve knew this had to be the beginning of it.
Between upchucks, Tony heard the plate and mug clink lightly as Steve set them on the counter next to the workbench. Seconds later, Steve’s warm hands were on him and he was making soothing noises. He rubbed his back and talked to him as such until he finished.
The second theory was what made him turn it off because it was that he was a wannabe celebrity. He said they purposely release his identity to get Peter thrown into the "it" scene. He said Peter wanted this and was enjoying it. He described Peter’s personality as being shallow and vain and started to cite examples and Peter turned off the video.
“Y-Y-You can’t do that,” Bucky gasped, his face growing pale.
Steve’s eyes widened, water dripped from his brow, and he gasped, “Once a year?
“I can’t think of one right now!” The imposter gasped.
“What happened?” Tony asked in a hushed whisper, his voice hollow.
“Yeah, but we know it can be more than a shield now. With our minds controlling it, it can be a shield, body armor, a weapon, or something as simple as an umbrella. The possibilities are endless and ‘Venom’ makes it sound more badass.”
When he was on the roof and his hands were empty he couldn’t help but remember the even more empty feeling in his hands when Tony had disappeared.
With a blank face, Tony stared at the spot on Steve’s arm he had just been touching a moment ago as his brain slowly processed Steve’s rejection.
Wade assured his boyfriend, “It’s alright. I’m ready, Peter.”
He was safe. Ross was gone.
He was running out of time.
Steve paused and saw a particular look come across Tony’s face but disappeared in a blink. Tony shrugged and said, “Then we will have to think of something else…”
Natasha mirrored his smirk and replied, “Exactly.” She leaned in and whispered, “Tony is Tony. He’s made a lot of stupid decisions in his life and he makes the stupid decision to not go for you…well then he’s just not worth it.”
When Wade entered the room, Venom reacted immediately by dragging itself away from the door and hissing at Wade like a serpent.
Tony looked down at Venom and gasped, “Peter’s alive in
“A nine?” Natasha scoffed.
“You’re safe now,” Steve promised and enveloped Peter in a tight hold.
Steve snorted again and leaned into Tony too.
“Good thing because you
Had she had those hopes they would have been dashed anyways because her teacher stated, “You will not graduate from the program until the time on this runs out. At the end, you will be expected to kill your soulmate to show your commitment to the cause. Is that understood?”
In his mind, they had already won. He already saw himself reclaiming the Tower and making love with Steve in their home. They’d be safe and happy.
Was it because of the whole identity reveal? Was that the stressor that had skewed Peter? Or was it something else?
Steve lifted his hips as Tony pulled off his clothing and kept his eyes locked with Tony’s to gather courage from him. He could not help but groan as his erection slid free. Tony’s eyes dropped to his crotch then returned to Steve’s gaze glazed with an added lust, he clearly like what he saw and Steve felt empowered by it. Tony slid Steve’s slacks and briefs down to knees and paused to kiss his inner thigh. His kisses continued downward until he reached the clothing around Steve’s knees. Once there, he slowly slid down the apparel, kissing him as he went. Steve trembled and felt mortified because he knew Tony could feel it. He flexed his fingers, not knowing what to do with them. He wanted to cover his crotch to hide his nakedness, he wanted to give into his secret wanton nature and touch himself as he watched Tony gradually strip him, and he wanted to touch Tony and make Tony feel just as turned on as Steve was. There was so much he wanted to do but he did not know how to act.
“I was just looking for a good photo for your Instagram,” Wade bashfully murmured.
“Alright, I give,” Sam said and the thrusters on his wings lessened their output. He landed on the ground and his thrusters totally turned off. He asked, “What the hell is Fuddy-Duddy?”
Peter jolted like he was shocked by something and then turned to Tony and sighed, “Hi, Dad.”
And everything he wanted to tell Tony would never be told.
Peter gasped, “I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to make it sound like you weren’t a part of my family! You’ve always been my family!
And, at that moment, he was so happy for him and Steve. He knew they were perfect for each other.
It was unusual to have an implant on the right arm, especially in the west but, in the Soviet Union, where some soul implants were obtained illegally, a good number were put on the wrong arm like it was on her mate.
Bucky suddenly looked nervous and he asked, “Do-Do you want me to again?”
“…Is this one of the Captain’s?” Coulson asked passively, lightly pulling the sketch closer with the tip of his finger. He kept his expression mildly interested to hide his true reaction to seeing one of Cap's originals.
Until I know if I will be writing one or two chapters, I cannot give you guys a proper chapter title!
“Tonight’s the night,” Cable stated and handed Steve the reactor.
“I think we need to add this to our training regimen,” she murmured jokingly and kissed him again. This time it was short and she broke it with a smile. She got to her feet and helped him up.
Pepper narrowed her eyes and stated, “But the press-.”
“To quote you, everything isn’t so ‘black and white’. Things could go out of control from no fault from you,” Steve replied just as stubbornly.
Finally, she gave in one morning over breakfast. The usual silence was too maddening and she broke it by mumbling, “Natasha.”
Peter had no idea what to say. He wanted to berate and apologize to Tony at the same time. The wounds were still too fresh for him to think rationally.
Just as he lightly bit down on Tony’s collarbone, Tony reached out and carded his fingers through Steve’s hair. Steve glanced up and met Tony’s gaze. Tony whispered, “I love you too, beloved.”
Natasha’s gaze spanned the room, taking in every single one of them. Bucky sat stiffly on the couch and Tony was suddenly very interested in his coffee. Steve glanced nervously at both men before turning to the assassin and saying, “Good morning, Natasha.”
“I had smothered it, pretended it was not there,” Steve whispered. “Recently, I finally let it die…”
“Hm? Oh, nothing,” Wade murmured noncommittally. He smiled warmly at Peter and gave Peter’s shoulders a squeeze as he said, “I was just thinking of the snuggle time I’ll be getting with my baby boy.”
The world seemed the same to Tony. Everything he remembered was still there…Even the old movies he had watched about the Commandos were the same. Steve and Peggy still shard their tragic romance and there wasn’t even the inkling that Steve once had a relationship with a man the last months of his life…
Tony lay pliant in his arms and watched Steve with a warm gaze, trying to outpour all the love he felt for him through his eyes alone. Steve smiled at him like he knew what Tony was doing and tucked himself right up to him. With their foreheads pressed together and their eyes locked, Tony whispered, “What are you thinking, beloved?”
“Maybe I should change too,” Steve soberly murmured as he deflected his gaze from Tony and looked down at himself. He was wearing the same clothes that he had worn to the zoo. It was a buttoned down blue shirt and khaki trousers. Maybe he should change into his formal army uniform or a suit like Tony.
“How about you do it, Shellhead,” Steve retorted and Tony threw back his head to laugh.
“…How many times do they have to comment on the ‘intimate’ scene?” Tony grumbled.
“Shut up,” Peter laughed, lightly shoving Wade as he slipped back into bed with him.
He dashed away before either of them could reply.
Tony’s thumbs caressed the insides of Steve’s wrists and whispered, “It has been over a year since we started dating but we’ve known each other much, much longer…” Steve nodded and tensed, preparing himself for bad news. Tony continued, “We have faced death countless times and have even gone through God awful periods when we thought the other was dead…” Steve nodded again, biting down on his lip. What horror was Tony building up to? Tony continued, “What I’m trying to say is we don’t know when we’re going to go…It could be tomorrow or it could be fifty years from now but…” Tony inhaled deeply and opened his hands. He gently pulled the box from Steve’s grasp and popped it open. Inside sat two silver rings.
But Steve
Mixed in with the Goblin’s laughter were Venom’s shrieks and a loud clanking sound, which reminded Steve of the kicking of a can down an alley. He could hear no one else. Where were the agents? But, most importantly, where was Tony?
He couldn’t rip off the butcher of a doctor operating on him.
He wished he could take it all back but a small part of him, the part of him that had dreamed up those scenarios with Bucky, was glad and it disgusted Steve all the more.
“To join the Black Widow Program, I must kill my soulmate,” she replied shortly and pressed the gun deeper into her soulmate’s chest. She ironically added, “Hence the ‘widow’ name of the program.”
“Yes,” Tony replied.
Tony had…nothing – no way to survive.
“You’re such a romantic,” Peter drawled sarcastically, wounding his arms behind Wade’s neck to draw him closer.
Steve stood and punctuated every word as he answered, “Tony. What. The. Hell??”
“Then we’ll just have to find a way to get Venom in there and then find a way to separate it from Peter,” Steve stated, his mind already calculating what would need to be done.
“He’s going to Malibu?” Tony whispered, his breath catching in his throat as he said it.
Steve stared dumbly at Bucky and Bucky stared back with wide eyes.
As soon as Bucky stepped out of the room, Tony said, “Jarvis, bring up a live video feed.” Holograms appeared in the middle of the table, above the flowers, showing Natasha standing at the elevator and Bucky cautiously approaching her.
It was left unlocked for them and he pulled it open with a grunt. The rest of the team watched, primed and ready to jump at a moment’s notice to help their friend.
“Hm?” Tony asked, finally breaking his gaze from Steve.
Around him, the Avengers held off the rest of the perpetrators, leaving them to spar only themselves. Not long after Thor dropped Peter off at Oscorp Tower, SHIELD joined the fight and the rest of the combatants were rounded up quickly with the exception of the Goblin.
“I don’t know…It must have just showed up because this is the first time I’m seeing it,” Tony murmured. Steve frowned at the mark and Tony grasped the hand tracing it with a chuckle. Tony kissed his fingers and pressed Steve’s hand over his reactor as he promised, “I’ll check on it first thing in the morning, I promise…”
But…that scent…
“What is it?” She called from inside. Steve and Tony paused at the bottom of the porch stairs and looked to the door as they heard May make her way to the front of the house as the old floor boards creaked beneath her tread.
And kudos for Future Tony for making it a reality.
Tony opened his eyes to Steve glaring at him. His grin grew larger and he said, “But Cap, it’s your theme song! I have my theme song on my phone!”
Steve groaned at Tony’s question and as he imagined the conversation between Clint and Natasha about their “bet.”
“Uncle Tony?” his son squeaked, stating “uncle” correctly for the first time in his life.
from my friends, is their trust and you broke that, Steve.”
From the corner of his eye, he saw Bucky remove the syringe from Tony’s neck. He kept the sharp point to the needle hovering ominously over his throat.
Wade’s heart all but burst from his chest.
He picked up his head and his super soldier smiled sweetly at him. Tony leaned in and kissed Steve gently.
Steve had to lay down and Tony worriedly hovered over him.
“Whoa whoa whoa, Ultra-Tampons, chill,” Wade said, coolly stepping between Peter and Ultron. “Me and my baby boy are madly in love and need to have contact every five hours or one of us will throw a tantrum. Probably me…and you’ve had him for over ten hours. I am going to start stomping my feet soon!”
“Oh, I love when you’re sassy,” Tony flirted. He skipped ahead and stepped in front of Steve, bringing them both to a stop. Tony grasped the lapel of his shirt and pulled him in until their chests bumped together. Tony continued with a coy smile, “I’ve been thinking…you and me get away. Out of New York and somewhere warm, on a beach, maybe a private island with just the two of us and no chance of vultures swooping in.”
“I feel like a stripper,” Peter stated looking down at himself.
“Dios Mio,” the woman gasped as she recognized him and nearly dropped her bag.
“Peter’s a smart boy,” May stated, tightening their clasped hands despite the tremor in hers. “If he’s outwitted this thing before then he can do it again. We just need to have faith in him.”
Venom made a noise that was a combination of a shriek and groan. It’s body –
With the smile brought forth from his laughter, Steve kissed him again and Tony stupidly had to blink back tears of joy. He was so happy to be here with Steve and knowing this was forever?...it choked him up.
Steve mentally smacked himself again. Peggy was already fishing for Tony’s last name. Why did Steve have to be friends with so many people who were intelligence gatherers?
Silence fell over them like a heavy shroud as they stared at one another.
Drinking a fresh cup of coffee, Steve watched them both discreetly through a gap in the curtains to the windows that looked into the infirmary.
“Nothing,” Tony moaned. They’d only known each other less than two years but his son already knew him too well. Peter knew something was bothering him. He explained, “It’s something I haven’t done just yet…”
“Today is the first day you meet me,” Cable acknowledged.
The shocked silence was broken when Eddie laughed ecstatically and rounded the counter, embracing Peter, gasping, “
“Tonight…” Steve began, his tongue feeling thick in his mouth. Tony side-glanced at him and his brows rose in question when Steve struggled to find his words. Blushing like a virgin he most definitely was not, Steve looked down at the basket of coals in his arms and murmured, “Tonight…why don’t we spend it in my room before...you know, I don’t have one anymore.”
He hung up and stared grimly at the news broadcast as they continued on the story.
“Friday, is that thing out of our atmosphere?” Tony asked.
Tony faced Steve with a groan. His chest collapsed against Steve’s legs and he dropped his face into Steve’s crotch. Steve hissed with indignation, “
“Captain Rogers,
Steve nodded and said, “We need to worry about making a good impression for ourselves anyways.”
Was the oven door was open?
“Duty calls,” Peter sighed heavily. “I’ll see you guys around!”
“Almost!” Tony stated, “It did not happen! And let’s not forget, you were the one to kiss me first—!”
He took off his suit, being careful not to wrinkle it more than it already was, when he saw something sticking out of his breast pocket. He pulled out the napkin and smiled at the scratchy phone number and doodle of a cartoonish Deadpool.
From the restaurant, they walked to the pier next, hand-in-hand, praising the good food and groaning over their full bellies
Tony flushed and looked away as he murmured, “It…It’s stupid.”
Peter fought its hold and fought to breathe but Venom was stronger. He could feel it fighting to break free and pummeled Peter’s body without a care. He could hear people trying to speak to him through the speakers, but their voices were muffled.
“J, get me Mark 15,” Tony commanded.
“Sir,” Jarvis stated in warning, stepping out of the shadows.
They were at war. Why would his country deploy half of its army for one measly soldier? This man didn’t know he was Captain America…right?
“The flowers are still sitting where I left them on the table,” Bucky stated morosely.
“His…spider-sense,” she explained. “He knew something bad was going to happen and instead of running away and saving himself, he ran to me and tried to save me.”
“The Dodgers aren’t here anymore, you know that…” Tony teased.
. He’s the reason I ended the affair. ”
“Sir has no meetings scheduled,” Jarvis replied.
He and Tony pretended nothing had happened between them but their talking was somewhat forced which made Steve even more uneasy. Was this going to destroy their friendship now?
“Guys, I am still here,” Rhodes groaned. “
Peter nodded and could not help but feel a pang of guilt in reference to Uncle Tony – to his “dad.” So much time had passed since he had adopted Peter and he had been calling him “Uncle” since then. As he made his way to the elevator, he thought of the role Uncle Tony had played in his life and how much it mirrored that of his pops.
The other was only a little taller than Peter, which was not saying much, and had a normal physique compared to his overly muscular companion, and had dark brown hair. As soon as Peter opened the door, he began to twitch and Twitchy became his nickname.
Tony laughed as Steve tripped over his words and silenced him with a kiss. Steve hesitated for a second but then relaxed and returned it, cupping Tony’s face as he did.
They were quick to add visiting the workshop to their routine but soon found themselves spending most of their time in Tony’s workshop. Peter was entranced by Tony as he worked. From the sparks that came off his blowtorch to the holograms that glowed with Tony’s specs, Peter could not stop watching. As soon as he woke, h's son began asking to go down there and, every time they left, he threw a tantrum.
his clone.”
Wade watched Banner as he sighed heavily, his exhaustion and worry was prevalent in the dark circles under his eyes and the pale parlor of his skin. It was late. Peter had gone down hours ago. Most people would be in bed at this hour...This time yesterday Peter had been sleeping peacefully in his arms. The thought did not sit well with Wade as his insides twisted unpleasantly.
Steve bit down on his lip at the sound and pumped more furiously to come faster. Tony moaned agreeably and started to rub more furiously at his shaft to come with him.
“What’s going through your mind, baby boy?” Wade moaned. He reached down and ran a thumb over Peter’s lips.
His legs shook and he fell to his knees. His anger gave way to despair again and he pressed his face into the coffin, begging, “Wake me up, Steve.
Tony grinned and flew to his son’s side. Peter was crouched over the side of a building, looking down to the street below. Tony disconnected from the comms and opened his face shield. Seeing this, Peter tapped his ear and turned off the communicator beneath his mask.
Peter looked at the bush with wide eyes and he whispered, “It’s awive?”
They all gathered around Fury and listened to his explanation on how he had survived using a serum developed to calm Bruce down when he Hulked. Coulson was vaguer, mumbling something about Tahiti but he mostly evaded the subject and Steve could see he was uncomfortable talking about it so he did not press.
– on the streets to give me a live view of the city to help in the search for him from here…” Tony whispered, “I wanted to be out there but I…I couldn’t leave you…”
Natasha forwent a greeting and asked, “Any luck on the Cap search?”
“No more on the east side,” Natasha stated.
For a moment, the life Steve had dreamed of flashed before his eyes. There would never be a picket fence at the Tower but, he had Tony and they could adopt kids if they wanted too. Steve wouldn’t mind making breakfast every morning for a tired, grumpy mate and a kid or two emulating their father’s grumpiness.
“I will never give into alien demands!”
“And Iron Man can fly and Pops does not have as awesome of uniform like me, right Petey?” Tony asked, kneeling next to the boys as Peter sat up.
“Call him Pops!” Tony interceded.
This was the moment of truth.
The most frightening part of the trial was also the most critical.
Iron Man was silent but he could imagine Tony laughing behind his mask. Steve knew him well enough that he probably looked up the term as soon as Bucky said it.
His fingers traced her jawline and then cupped her cheek. She leaned into his hold and placed her hand over his.
?” Steve gasped. Was he dreaming he was in some kind of sci-fi comic? What was going on??
Steve was tempted but he shook his head and said, “I’ve got the plan memorized, I can’t possibly memorize any more of it.”
But Wade's eyes flickered up and focused on the watch. He whispered, “That's the
“I need you to get me information on this man pronto.”
when Han and Leia meet Vader at a dinner table. It ended with Leia’s boyfriend being tortured…Not that his dad would do that…Vader and Tony’s motives were
How could he keep a straight face when his friends eventually began to joke about his father’s death?
The robot’s gaze finally broke away from Steve and looked to Bucky. Its color changed without warning and blended in with the light walls of the room. It stated, “The official title for this unit is Mark 15 but, with its stealth capabilities, I…My maker thought it appropriate to call me ‘Sneaky’.”
“No, Sir,” Jarvis replied. “I would never call my creator an idiot, no matter the varying levels of foolhardy he displays.” Tony rolled his eyes. Tony made his AI was too witty and sassy for his own good. Jarvis continued, “Sir, Master Rogers has returned.”
Yay! It's done!
What was Wade missing??
“Thanks to my blackout windows, they won’t see me or my ‘guest’ until we arrive,” Tony replied, wrapping an arm around Steve’s waist. Looking to Steve he asked, “Ready to go? Or should we do something cliché and have a fight, only to reunite at the fundraiser and slow dance to some 80s music?”
Coulson had seen him, himself. Captain Rogers may have been a little pale but he was breathing on his own and his mortal injuries were no longer life-threatening. Yet…
“I also see you in him, Captain,” Ben whispered. He looked up from the photo and said, “You said Hydra had succeeded?”
Believe it or not, I'm predicting two more chapters! I can't believe I'm almost done!! :O
“What else changed?” He gasped aloud. He looked between Steve, Bucky, and Jarvis and held Steve tightly as, with a bewildered voice, he repeated, “What else?”
Bucky smiled sadly at him and said, "Tomorrow. I had to wait to tell you till now so you wouldn't have a chance to stop me."
Bucky’s hand snapped around his hand like a bear trap.
“Or fall in love with you,” Tony countered.
“Yes,” Steve replied. He sat next to her and gently brushed hair out of Peter’s face. He asked Natasha, “Did he hurt you? He does not know his own strength yet…You’re actually the first person I let hold him since I got him.”
Bucky followed Steve’s gaze and rolled his eyes when he saw Tony. He grabbed Steve’s arm and marched him out of the cafeteria.
“You preformed beautifully,” he stated. “They don’t suspect a thing.”
“Battles are chaos! We all can’t follow your formulated plan. Our opponents won’t do it, so why should we!”
When Tony hit the second helicopter, he informed them, “That’s two.”
He collected Tony as close as he could to Steve’s broad chest and wrapped himself around his soulmate. The darkness would to go through him first if it wanted his soulmate.
“Come on, Pete, open up. Tony will never let me live it down if I break one of his doors.”
“I came over to see if you were okay, not to gush over my nose or Peter,” Logan grumbled.
Tony had mentioned Bruce staying at the Tower since the attack on New York but he did not know Clint was there or that the others frequented it as well. The billionaire had asked him to move in soon after the attack but Steve had declined, wanting to stay in Brooklyn. Tony pestered him for a few weeks about it but eventually gave up.
– fight him! Defeat Venom! Don’t die!”
form the Avengers after all.”
“I’m not letting you face those vultures alone,” Tony growled.
“You are not joining the Avengers until you are done with high school,” Tony deadpanned before their son could finish. By the tone of his voice, Steve bet Peter had already brought up this topic.
Steve and Tony traded sad glances as Bucky stared dejectedly down at his hands.
“I love both of you so much,” Tony confessed, voicing for the first time his affection for Peter.
Steve murmured, “We
“Tony…”
When they finally got to the mess hall, he easily spotted Bucky and the other Commandos sitting at one of the tables. Bucky also noted their entrance and waved to them. Gabe, Jim, Monty, and Jacques noted their presence upon Bucky's movement and they too waved and eyed Tony curiously.
UPDATE: Holy cow, the people have spoken! :o
“I have a very nice couch in my apartment,” Steve supplied.
Steve pushed himself up and met Tony square in the eye. Two could play at this teasing game and Steve was no longer the blushing virgin he was when he first met Tony.
Peter doubted there were any robotic aliens laying around that could do that. He just smiled and teased, “No special treatment for family.”
Or, in actuality…
He woke when the bus jolted to a stop and he sat up sharply, expecting another attack.
“It’s just the way you two are around each other. I can’t explain it but, even though I spent only a few minutes with you two, I felt a connection between you two that was deeper than friendship.”
“Hey….” Jake dragged out the greeting, the sound of the word rose in inflection and sounded more like a question than a greeting. Peter pressed his hand against the handprint scanner and a flash of blue light scanned his prints. It quickly chirped in confirmation, giving him the greenlight to go forward.
He sighs down at his phone if she’s pushing for an actual conversation its not just another update about SI, she wants to talk about something. Something he doesn’t want to talk about, because he doesn’t want to talk about anything much these days. He wonders if she’ll ask him to come home.
“I dunno, ask me when I’m not dying.” Tony gestures down to his abdomen, where his cut has reopened and is bleeding heavily.
He sits up dangling his feet over the edge of the bed, looking down at them. He doesn’t ask Jarvis to open the windows, he doesn’t want to see the world, or the beginning hints of sun and watch the birds fly by his widows. Mostly because he doesn’t want the world to be able to look back at him. Doesn’t want the heat of the sun to reach his skin, or the shadows of birds to paint his floors. He wants to forget the world exists and in turn, for it to forget him.
“Don’t die.” You add quickly. “It’s not part of the plan.”
That’s when they had started talking about Stark tower.
Tony’s eyes are already closing, he’s losing the battle to sleep. He licks his lips as his body rests heavier on the bed. “I’m not sure anymore.”
He doesn’t want to be the one to set them off balance.
Bucky thinks for a moment. “It sometimes locks up, won’t budge from whatever position I had it in. Other times it’s just dead weight. Occasionally there’s a sharp pain, gives me headaches.”
“Well now look what you did,” Bucky mutters under his breath, dropping the crust onto his plate.
He mentally chants to himself, he isn't fighting for Tony, he has a soul-bond to them both. It just hurts to consider, because if it were one, he is falling flat on his ass in second.
“Really? Why?”
“Killian called and told you this?” He asked, his heart speeding up.
“Mute!” Tony yells.
The glass in his window had broken and sprayed toward him giving stinging cuts to his face. The force of impact had sent them knocking forward. Howard's head hitting the steering wheel. Killing him almost instantly. The entire front of the car had been dented in. Bits and pieces of the engine had been sent flying into the car through the dash lodging them in Maria's neck and Tony's chest. He was impaled right down the middle by a large piece.
He realizes he’s spending too much time smelling Steve for it to not be weird, forcing himself to focus he realizes he, in turn, is being sniffed out, in an obvious way.
“I think dehydration is a more pressing concern.” Tony murmurs with a cough punctuating his sentence and scratching his dry throat.
“The ship?” Rocket asks, “What are we going to need that for?”
“We need to round everyone up. Then we can make a plan.”
It wasn’t until he was here, truly free of responsibilities and people, did he realize how exhausting it all was. Now all his time went into Stark industries projects. He dares say his company is doing better because he’s actually introducing new ideas and new items for them to sell and produce.
Tony thinks to himself. Suddenly he’s regretting calling her. He hadn’t realized Killian would be calling Pepper. God, once a week for six months? A part of Tony had hoped that Killian would give up, lose interest, get tired of waiting around. But if he’s continuing to be this persistent Tony doesn’t see him giving up anytime soon.
“Do you think that’s why he ran?” Steve questioned quietly.
Both Steve and Bucky get the sense that it’s probably time to go. Steve’s got a shift this afternoon anyway, then Bucky works the night shift. Despite them not wanting to go, there’s also the powerful urge not to overstay their welcome and possibly mess things up.
But there’s also the wound in his side. The fix he gave was temporary. It would stop the bleeding for now, but he couldn’t heal without medical attention. Which he didn’t have here. Moving around would only shorten the time it lasted.
“No. But he’s looking for me. If I go, he’ll find me.”
He was in excruciating pain for days after getting the serum. His mother cried every day, sure it might be his last. But one day, he woke up, the pain was gone, and for the first time in forever, he felt healthy.
“It’s not that- I know just a stupid fear okay? That everything is sort of going okay, but I can’t let it go. It’s all I can think about. That I don’t belong.”
There goes his plan to keep Killian out of his head because now he’s really thinking about it. Before he was worried about soulmates crashing in on his life and ruining things. But what if he ruined things between them? After so long together they’ve probably got a great balance and harmony. Tony knows when he’s got a habit it’s damn near impossible to break. He hates people in his space messing with his things, it just… it sets everything off balance.
“What? No, you knock.”
You’d met a man named Wong not long ago. Gave him word for word instructions from Stephen. He seemed hesitant to believe you until you mentioned someone named ‘Dormammu’ and his skepticism seemed to fade away.
“They are not coming for the food, Sir. It's just you trying to be nice. I believe no matter the food preference or intolerance they will understand the gesture.”
Also I feel like I cut the Loki and Thor time short, so if you guys want me to beef up or focus more on a specific ship just lemmie know, because I basically ship everyone with everyone, and want to make sure I incorporate them in here. That includes shipping the reader with anyone as well, but you should know I don't intend on focusing the reader with anyone specific or having the reader in a relationship because of the story-line I have in mind. But I plan to make lots of room for fluff, so just let me know lol.
There’s one hit, and he hears the chain snap, and the gust of air at the bag breaks open simultaneously. It flies a few feet before it lands, sliding across the floor, spilling sand all out onto the floor. He sighs, standing straight. He takes a moment to breathe; breathing is always important. Moving too quickly will only make it happen again.
“Hey,” Bucky says from the kitchen, drinking coffee. Steve trudges over, drinking some, not caring he probably going to sleep soon. Coffee doesn’t really affect him until his third or fourth cup. “You look beat, Brock give you hell?”
“Steve stayed behind to find Tony. We need to find Thor.” Bruce steps up. Shuri nods.
Here he was fighting his mind alone, and he was failing. It was easier to fight when he had Killian on his side. Not as his enemy. He nodded to himself, deciding finally to face the music. He stood, and unlocked the bathroom door. Steve had been sitting right next to it, eyes wide and face red.
Tony: You don’t have to be sorry. You didn’t do anything wrong. I just don’t do too well with people or physical exertion.
“Buck, I can’t just-”
“Want to know an interesting thing about this arm?” He lays his hand gently on the arm, fingers tracing the grooves. “These panels are designed for easy matinence. Cleaning, repairing, upgrading, the works. They pop out and right back in. With their simple design I could easily make new ones.” His fingers dig right around the one on the very tip of his shoulder, he lifts it, and then slides it out of place with two soft clicks. “On the sides of each panel are two little connectors, they control latching and the movement. That’s why your arm is so lifelike and fluid. They don’t need to be detached for cleaning or fixing it up, unless of course, they’re what’s causing the issue. Which I doubt.”
Stephen's voice filters through the sounds of fighting.
“That’s what happens when you have no routine. It sounds like you need some. Diet is tied to sleep patterns. If you sleep bad, you eat bad. You need to find balance. You’re already suffering for it.” He lifts a page on the clipboard resting in his lap. “Can I get a list of current medications and illnesses from you?”
“Yeah, can you order something? I don’t feel like cooking.” He sighs, dropping his head in his hands on the counter, already feeling winded, just walking from his room to his kitchen. Although, in his defense, it’s a rather large apartment.
He touches people all the time. It’s partly his job and part0ly because he’s a hands-on person, tactile, and touching is how you meet your soulmate, so many people are like him. When he feels the tingle in his palm spread out and then a shock of cold as if he’s dipped his hand in ice-cold water, he immediately knows it for what it is.
The insides of the panels have some rough and jagged edges. Nothing major, but Tony would feel better replacing them than to let them sit any longer. Still, it’s not important considering a little rust couldn’t be causing Bucky pain.
So sorry about that lol.
“J, what time is it?”
Acceptance, that’s what Killian said would help get rid of them forever. His medication a temporary fix. Was- was a temporary fix. He doesn’t have it anymore. He ran out of his last bottle and refilling it wasn’t an option. He couldn’t be found. He’d rather live in his personal hell than go back.
“I don’t know what your deal is, or what this is with the hulk. But you don’t have time for this. Y/n is waiting for us, everyone is waiting for us, For you. I know you fought the guy and lost, we all did. But you don’t see us hiding out. So, tell the hulk to nut up, and get out here or I’ll shoot you in the head and make him!”
“Not since college.” Tony shook his head. Stephen reached over and made a few notes before moving to take his pulse. Then his blood pressure, then his eye coordination and pupils. Then ears, inside his mouth, and along his neck.
It’s how they know you, and understand what you need. Bucky wants that, he wants his soulmate, he always has. He’s romanticized it, imagined it, thousands of ways, each and every one of them special and amazing.
won’t let him get the chance.”
Steve stands too. Not yet feeling the jealousy and insecurities wash away. “You talked to him more. Yesterday, you texted him.”
“We’ve lived together what? Ten years now?” Bucky asks, looking around at their cramped apartment.
“Not sure yet,” Natasha says. “But it seems we all have our own missions and parts to play.”
“Yes.” The AI replies. You begin rebandaging yourself.
“Why don’t you help me. Grab some of those shirts over there?” He points to a clothing rack just behind the kid. The kid hesitated then looked at you and Steve a moment before getting up and grabbing as many shirts as his arms could carry.
And without a peep from Tony. No sign of him in the media, he’s not going to company meetings. Nothing. Killian would almost be worried he was dead if he didn’t know for a fact Pepper was in contact with him. He overheard her end of a phone call to him once. He’d asked her multiple times to convince Tony to come back, and she said she would try, but has yielded no results.
Tony steps to the side and allows them in. They take their shoes off by the door and pass to the living room and set their things down on the coffee table. Tony let himself linger just a moment, looking at the two sets of shoes. They hadn’t done that last time. They hadn’t gotten comfortable.
“You were on the team!” Steve points out, voice a little more defensive than he intended.
“Thank you.” She smiles, but it quickly drops when she checks the time. “Oh Tony, I have to go, I’ve got a meeting.”
“Nah, I wouldn’t know what to say, besides, he’s asleep.”
“Now!” Rocket yells, and Valkyrie takes that as her cue over comms to bring the ship closer and start shooting with all she has to divide his attention a third time. Thanos only doubles his forcefield and Thor roars, collecting all the thunder he can muster and directing it at the titan, as Loki shoots his magic at him as well.
“What?” There’s a knock on the door and cuts off any reply Jarvis could have had. “Is it four already?” Tony asked.
There’s no way Tony’s not going to notice that, there’s no way he’s not going to question how in the hell Steve managed to do that with his fist. Dread and regret filled him. Fear that he’s ruined this for the both of them.
Yet none of them truly know anything about him.
Steve shakes his head, and starts drawing on the next free page. This seems like a good way to make the day pass. It’s the only thing keeping him patient enough to wait for tomorrow.
Tony only flinches at the sudden figure standing in front of him. Once he looks up and realizes it’s the guy at the counter, he breathes, relieved. “Uh, yeah, I’m good.” He nods quickly, looking down to the ground.
“You want me to what?”
There’s a knock at the door and Tony almost flinches. Almost. But he’s got this under control. He can be a functioning adult for one day. Or for at least a few hours while they are here.
Tony isn’t just complementing it because it’s Stark tech or even because Howard must have built it. The arm truly deserves the praise. Twenty years of use and the thing looks brand new. Not a scratch or mark on it. Now he’s already mentally making plans to go through the archives and take a look at what else Howard might have made that he doesn’t know about.
“I wouldn’t know. I met them a few hours ago.”
“No, that was Stephen.”
That’s the fairytale version that kids have.
He passed out from blood loss before the ambulance came and when he woke up in the hospital two days later he went numb at hearing Obie would be taking care of him until he turned eighteen and took over the company.
“He’s hurt, he needs a doctor.”
“I do. It’s a real upgrade.”
Steve already knows what he’s going to say. They’ve had this conversation a million times now. He’s going to tell Steve to take it easy, remember the breathing, and not to stress over a few bags. The thing is, Steve isn’t stressed over a few bags. He’s stressed because one day, it might not be a bag that gets sent flying. Actually, there is no one day. It’s already happened.
“I think I’m going to head home. Wanna come with? We could close up.”
could say to abate Steve’s fear. Steve saw Bucky on even ground. No, he’s not as strong as Steve but he is stronger than the average joe. They’ve had each other for forever. Bucky is his normal, and his constant. This is new. Tony is Steve’s new, he’s new for both of them.
“Yeah.” Tony didn't know where his phone was, which was often the case. Jarvis often acts as a phone, reading the messages and answering calls.
Tony dumps the bowl of cereal into the sink and pulls the door open.
Tony comes back into the room with a tablet and some kind of beeping bracelet. He’s got a phone pressed to his ear and he’s talking.
“I’ve waited this long for you, I can handle some more.”
No one can know.
“This feel’s so…”
“It was me, I hurt him.” He felt a ball build in his throat. “He was having a nightmare.” Steve remembered waking on the couch hearing Tony yell how he sounded as if someone was attacking him. “He was screaming for help.” He picked his eyes up from the floor. “I ran in there, and I tried to shake him awake. Next thing I know I could feel his wrist crunch in my hand.”
That’s what happens for the rest of the day. Except for the occasional panic attack about the fact that they both have the same soulmate and they are both going to see him tomorrow.   But they are fine. It only happens like once an hour every hour.
Why hasn’t anyone told him this? He doesn’t know.
He hadn’t expected to be so right about that.
“Yes.” His voice wavers slightly but it doesn’t seem to matter to either of them as they lean forward, their noses touch first, Tony juts out his chin just a little more and their lips press together. Tony’s skin tingles from his checks down to the base of his spine. It’s warm, and pleasant, everything a kiss should be. He’s missed this, and allows himself to sink into it. Bucky over him, comforting, warm, and he smells nice.
“He'll be back, shouldn't be more than twenty minutes.”
“Well excuse me if I’d like to know his name first. Or to at least try and get to know him.”
“Let me see your hands.” Tony scoots forward. Steve lifts his palms up. Both of them flawless, without a scar or mark on them. The metal arm coming back undamaged was believable, but his hand. That’s very strange. Tony chuckles. “So what are you? Superman?”
You nod, taking the moment to look at the kid. He can’t be over five, he’s got a small cut on his chin, and he’s covered in dirt. Other than that, he seems fine. You inspect his legs just to be sure and sigh soundlessly when you realize he’s got no shoes on. That’s going to make it harder for him to run if you need to. Which you’re pretty sure he’s going to need to at some point.
“Don’t- don’t panic. I’ll tell him it was me.” Bucky nods, already pulling the glove off his metal hand exposing it. It makes more sense anyway. Metal beats marble counter. Hopefully, he’s never actually punched a marble counter. But it’s better than trying to explain the science experiment.
But it’s fine. He won’t ruin this for Steve.
Shining the light down on it, you see the bleeding has started again. You groan, feeling helpless, you’ve got nothing to stop the bleeding and it’s not like you have time to patch yourself up. You’ll just have to ignore the pain for now and hope this will all be done with before you bleed out or get infected. You stand, straightening yourself out, about to begin walking again when you hear a low screech behind you.
“What?”
“Ten-twenty-three, Sir.”
“Fine.” Bucky sighs. “Let's just say we have equally awesome soulmates.”
“Dessert. Get dessert or something.”
“Did he say anything to you?” Steve asks.
Tony nods, feeling numb everywhere but in his wrist, he holds the injured limb out to Steve, and he winces. Skin now a dark purple.
“What if he doesn’t want us… me.”
“Yeah.” The man-Steve, nods. “He’s about an inch or two shorter than me. Black hair to his shoulders, grey-blue eyes, red soulmark on his hand. He said yours was down on your hip I think?”
“You are truly a bastard, Brother.” He says, the anger in his voice fails, and it all comes out in whispers. Then he’s dropping the ax and pulling Loki into a bone-crushing hug. Mostly serving to prove that this isn’t an illusion or figment of imagination. He doesn’t loosen his grip, not even when Loki grunts in pain. In Thor’s eyes it serves him right, pretending to die yet another time.
“So, you really can hear them,” Tony says after a few seconds and you nod.
He’s technically outranking most people in the gym. In fact, the only person who doesn’t have to answer to him, is Fury, which means of course, Fury is the only one Brock doesn’t act like a complete and total asshole towards.
“Thank you, Bruce.” He hung up the phone and turned back to Tony. “He’s calling. We just have to wait a bit.
“Yeah okay. Get soda.” He adds, almost bouncing from foot to foot.
“So why can you? Did something happen?”
“Okay, where’s my phone?”
Tony turns his face to press against the cool of the tile wall, helping with his headache. “I can’t.” He whispers. The idea of getting up, of leaving the bathroom. Facing the world, knowing he’d have to see a doctor… he couldn’t. Instead, he wanted to stay here and never leave.
“No Buck, that ridiculous. You and Tony are perfect for each other.”
Life was wrong. This life. Tony had another path, his parent’s had another path. Everything got screwed up, because of one day, one stupid road, his life was thrown off course, and he can never see himself getting back on track.
“It just sounds weird to commit to someone you’ve never seen or met.”
Bucky over to Stark Industries. His soulmate. They’d both learn who he is, Pepper would no doubt double back her instances he come back. Killian- he can’t even imagine what Killian would do when he heard the news.
I'm not happy with how this chapter turned out for some reason, it just feels dry or something idk. But it was a necessary evil because next chapter we fight the purple thumb. I don't know if i'll make it one large chapter or break it up into two, but the next chapter may end up being the last one.
“Do you wanna?” Tony asked, eyes squinted in disbelief.
Tony: Barely.
“Yeah sure. Let’s get Steve and you can help me grill Strange on the way.”
Also, just for the record- they totally jinxed it. Bad things happen in the next chapter!
“I’m not big on faith.” Tony sighs.
“That’s when I picked him up.” Valkyrie steps in. “I was looking for survivors when I saw him drifting. Somehow, he hadn’t frozen. I wonder if that’s an Asgardian thing or a Frost Giant thing. Either way, it took a while to heal him up, and by the time we did and managed to get to Earth, people were crumbling to dust.”
“You.” Thanos’ eyebrows furrow, his stance stiffens, he doesn’t seem so smug now. “How are you alive?”
Thanos steps back from their mirages and takes a deep breath. “Your tricks will not work on me.” He holds the gauntlet up and the reality stone brightens and a glow of red surrounds him.  Then it shoots out in all directions, destroying the illusion, and exposing Thor and Loki’s true location a few feet away to the left. Once they realize they’ve been found, they steady themselves weapons at the ready. Thanos smiles smugly at them.
“Well, that’s how things naturally go once you digest.”
Tony shoves the faucet off and throws his shirt back on. If noise wasn’t drowning out the voices then he needed to work. He reaches the workbench and clears off the table reaching for the new designs he’d sketched earlier.
“I personally like to think my drive to stay with you is stronger than whatever this was,” Steve replied. “…I think everything is going to be alright.”
Tony collapsed on the bed with a sigh and turned over to grin mischievously at Steve.
“Maybe you should try that next time…” Steve smartly suggested.
They were quick to change into their articles and join Coulson.
They had a message to make.
Tony stared at Steve with shock. He eventually managed to garble, “R-Really?”  Before his hopes were dashed, he asked, “Like fake couple or real couple?”
Steve and Tony shared a chuckle and bumped their heads together as they did. Their eyes met again and their laughing stopped. Steve lightly touched his forehead to Tony’s and whispered, “Hi.”
Steve rolled his eyes pressed a quick kiss on Tony’s face-shield before stepping back and putting on the rest of the uniform, saying, “These Sinister Six guys should be here soon.”
“Palladium…Palladium. Why do we keep mentioning it?” Howard asked, peering at Tony thoughtfully over Steve’s shoulder. “Where’s this reactor? Is it really
Bucky nodded to the supposed commands he was clearly eager to work with. He wobblily stepped out of the chamber and then fell forward. Tony went to catch him but, Jarvis must have taken the movement as a threat, and all the suits surged forward and pulled Tony away from Bucky.
“Ladies and gentlemen,” Marston said with a wily grin. “I give you, Captain Steven Rogers and the industrious Tony Stark!”
Peter glanced down at his glassware, feeling a wave of gratitude toward Eddie. He looked back to his friend and said, “I’m good, unless you need a break?”
But the wall was still there the next night and the night after that and…
Tony’s eyes were dark and glassy and their depths flickered like a candle when Steve’s eyes locked with his.
They were close and bordering on more than friends close, but they were not there yet. They enjoyed each other’s company and were still working on how they fit together. Tony hadn’t wanted to rush that, especially with how they started out.
Steve Rogers had a date with Tony Stark.
They ran into the courthouse just as quickly as they had run to the car. They expected to be late and that proceedings had started without them but Steve was surprised to see Marcel waiting for them outside the courtroom.
Clint was smiling as he slipped his phone out of his pocket, but that smile melted off his face as soon as he opened the message. It was replaced by a look of such horror, Tony’s stomach dropped and he didn’t even know what it was his friend saw.
When they all got up to go to the gym, Peter immediately latched himself onto Wade's arm and smiled happily at him.
Venom stiffly pushed himself up and cast his white gaze on the retreating form of the beast.
Tony grinned and stated, “Great, now for Project Two…”
“What? Oh course I do!”
He and Steve fell into each other as soon as the doors sealed and Happy raised the privacy screen between them.
Outside, he stepped into an alley to more discreetly change into his new shirt and then he gently placed the older shirt on top of a box someone was sleeping in. That person would put better use to the shirt than Steve would.
–!” He clutched the area he just tapped with a paling face.
Tony could die and it would destroy Steve if they were still estranged like this when it happened.
It’d been so long…too long.
Others guessed Pepper and Tony laughed aloud imagining the two together. Pepper was grounded whereas Steve was always in motion. It would never work!
the reactor. Steve gasped, “Is it even possible?”
“I’ll be sure to remember that next time you exhaustedly fuck me flat into the floor,” Tony replied dryly. Steve grinned and kept rubbing at his back and kneading the muscles. Tony leaned into the touch with a groan. His muscles were melting under Steve’s deft hands.
Tony couldn’t stop himself. He reached out and grasped Steve’s hand, curling his fingers into Steve’s. Steve’s hands were larger than his and warmer. The hold was so much more intimate than when they last touched to check if they were soulmates. He felt Steve hesitate for a moment and he stared at Tony as if he were trying to evaluate his actions. But, slowly but surely, he curled his fingers around Tony’s.
The smoke began to clear and he saw the majority of the agents were standing around Steve. Steve had his shield up and was looking to Tony. Several agents held tranquilizer guns, containing something most likely to knock Steve out.
Wade cared for his son deeply and Tony was finally noticing it.
Tony didn't like the power.
More patches were browning and Peter’s heart dropped. Their protoplasm was dying.
“To see you, Sir,” Jarvis replied. “He requested a meeting. When asked what the meeting was for, he said he merely wanted to speak with you. From there, security removed him and his companion.”
Bucky seemed a little stunned by Pepper. Receiving clothes and the news of a beach trip was a lot to pile on him all at once.
“…Gwen,” Peter whispered, his heart constricted when he voiced out her name. The day of their graduation felt like it was ages ago. He was so naïve back then…
“I do not want any more added to this memory, including seeing you two in your current states,” Peter retorted. His Spidey Sense barely flared and he hit the wall, making his dad snort.
“Miss Potts is coming down to the lab and the Colonel says it is a matter of national security that you tell him what you just did,” Jarvis relayed.
Steve grinned. He recognized this side of Tony. He only prattled on like this when he was nervous. Steve slowly stalked up to Tony and replied, “I am real. This is not a dream. And I am completely naked underneath this bathrobe.”
“You are supposed to stay in bed!” Bruce hissed and tossed the sheets back over him as his doctoring notions kicked in. He was worse than Pepper.
“No, wait,” Bruce stopped them. “You’ll crowd up my lab. Stay here. Jarvis will make sure you’re updated. I don’t want any distractions.”
this is why I never told you…”
They both stared at their respective drinks and shared silence for their lost loved ones.
“Four,” Steve corrected. “You were shot a fourth time, weren't you?”
Steve’s words tangled on his tongue as a redheaded woman strolled into the room, wearing a tight black body suit and carrying a long bag over her shoulder. Steve jumped out his and Tony’s embrace and the woman said, “Hello, Stark.”
“Does this mean everyone has to start addressing me as Time Lord?” Tony asked. He suddenly inhaled sharply and leapt to his feet. Pointing at Cable he gasped, “HOLY SHIT! You are the legit Terminator, aren’t you?! Did you have orders to come back in time to protect me??
Bruce scrutinized him with squinted eyes and asked, “What are you talking about?”
If it weren’t for Peter, Steve would have yelled obscenities at Jarvis and attempted to tear the door down. Instead, he held Peter close to his heart and listened to his breathing to reassure himself is son was still alive. Peter suffered from hiccups that shook his entire body and an endless amount of tears that did not stop flowing. Other than the hiccups, Peter did not make a noise. He simply held onto Steve’s dog-tags firmly and scrunched his eyes closed tightly, as if he was trying to avoid seeing a world without Tony in it.
After their food was gone, they remained seated and wound their arms around each other and relaxing into one another until Jarvis announced the VA rep’s arrival.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve inhaled a long, deep, calming breath and then replied, “I’m fine, Jarvis. It’s just a nightmare.”
“Dad…You-you know the media better than anyone. How’d you think they’d react to Wade? To us?”
“Don’t curse in front of him,” Steve stated with a heavy sigh. With Clint and Tony he knew he was going to be saying this a lot.
Steve ran his thumbs over Tony’s damp hip bones and Tony leaned heavily into his knees.
“Yes, perfect!” Steve snatched it and quickly gasped, “Thank you!” He ran before they could reply.
Clint, Laura, and their children were huddled together. Her partner was fretting over his family as they held one another. He continuously pressed a kiss onto Laura’s forehead and held both her and his children whenever they gave him the chance.
The metal doors to the elevator were closed so his eyes were met with his distorted reflection.
“Tony?” Steve sleepily murmured in response to his worried touch. He held the hand Tony had grasped him with and asked, “What’s wrong?”
“How is he??” Tony gasped, not getting the words out fast enough.
Wade smiled and murmured, “Don’t be a stranger, baby boy. I’ll get lonely.”
Steve handed him the coffee and his other hand slid from his stomach to hook onto his hip as soon as he was sitting upright. Steve murmured, “I love you too, Honey. Sleep well?”
Steve flinched again and bit down on his lips. He could not lie to Tony but he could not hurt him either...
“And I couldn’t give up the suit…It’s a part of me now,” Tony added, making Potts’ smile twitch.
Tony shook his head and pressed his fevered forehead against Steve’s arm as if hiding would solve the problem.
Venom was back in control and it focused its white eyes on its prey.
Steve wasn’t ready to say goodbye.
He was instantly reminded of crying into Sam’s shoulder over the man who currently held him and flushed.
A few minutes went by in a relaxed silence before Wade asked, “What scared you?”
Tony sat down on the bed and kicked off his shoes. Steve also toed off his shoes but never stopped staring down at Tony. He was mesmerized by the warmth of his gaze. Steve also felt like he was in a dream. This was too perfect.
It won't be as relaxing…but he could scrub Tony's back.
“Forget about themmmm,” Venom hissed and Peter forced himself to look away. Venom easily pushed the thoughts aside from Peters mind. Had Peter been in the right frame of mind, he would have been freaking out over Venom’s ability to sway him but Peter did not care, which was probably also caused by Venom.
He turned his hand beneath Wade’s and threaded his fingers between the rough fingers of the merc’s. In the darkness, he smiled widely to himself as that thrilling feeling shot up his spine again.
?” Steve implored.
“…What?” She and Gabe were staring at Tony with flabbergasted expressions.
Smirking, Wade dropped the knives and pulled Peter into his embrace to kiss him silent. Peter was fine. Wade had been overreacting as usual.
“So I guess that means I go first?” Steve reasoned with a smile.
with me.”
Tony threw back his head and laughed. Steve also grinned but it vanished with a whimper as Tony kept massaging the lube onto him from two fronts.
THEY FUCKING CUT OFF HIS ARM!
“Did you get her name? I want to buy her a new car and a night on the town,” Tony replied earnestly, already wondering if Jarvis got a shot of the person’s license plate.
Venom growled in the back of Steve’s mind and he sensed the symbiote’s skepticism.
Tony stared at the zeroes on his implant as he wracked his brain for possible solutions. When one came to him, his heart seized and he covered his implant, as if to hide his decision from Steve. He whispered, “Me.”
Happy opened the door for them and Peter stepped out first. Wade’s eyes were glued to his ass as the muscles flexed from the movement. His hands were itching to go back to squeezing it.
Next time, Ch. 5: The Show must Go On...
Bruce snickered and then replied, “It’s an article on terraforming and we were just debating the principle of the matter. But, soon we might be reading about you in here. Is what Tony said true? You’ve successfully constructed the bioshield?”
Peter slept with Steve like he did every night but…that night the bed felt empty and cold. Steve constantly felt himself reaching out for Tony, only to meet open air. In the few weeks Tony had shared his bed he had grown accustomed to it. His absence was like another nail in his coffin.
Tony grasped both sides of his face and drew him into a deep kiss, smothering his words. Steve groaned and fell into him. He ran his hands over his back and traced the familiar muscles. Tony pulled back slightly, keeping his hands on his face, and whispered into his lips, “I love you too you big lummox. God, I – I thought you were dead. When I heard you were on Air Force One, I thought you went down with the plane!” He kissed him again, his lips lingering longer. When he pulled back again, he ran his thumb over Steve’s bottom lip and whispered, “I thought losing Happy to a coma was bad but after saving everyone on that plane –
“Right back at you,” he replied, nodding to him and the doors sealed between them.
“The kind that’ll get you back on your feet,” Fury stated, slithering out of the shadows.
He was just using Peter as bait.
Natasha nodded and ran to her partner. Steve looked at Tony one more time then ran to his struggling teammate.
Bucky nodded again and flexed his new fingers. He murmured, “It…It almost reminds me of…my old arm…from before.”
“What’s wrong?” Uncle Bucky asked, looking up from his newspaper.
Steve sighed heavily but acquiesced and pushed himself to his feet. He asked, “If anything happens, please let me know?”
Tony closed the door to the fridge and stared at his hands as he tightly squeezed the handles and his knuckles turned white from the pressure. He breathed evenly to try and calm himself and then whispered, “I know what he did. I know
Just looking at him like this make his heart flutter.
Fucking Hydra.
Bucky nodded and Peter said, “Yah, I jusht asked Uncle Bucky a question…Are you a superhero too?” He added, directing the question to Bucky. Bucky flinched and replied, “Not really…”
Bucky frowned and grabbed Steve’s arm and admonished, “Hey! Don’t forget about my ticker! I got Grade A genes and a healthy appetite for the female body! Yet, I’m still never going to meet my perfect girl…” Bucky looked down, his face softening into a sadder expression to match his internal feelings, and whispered, “We were just dealt an unlucky hand in an unfair world, Stevie…There’s nothing wrong with me or you…Other than the fact that you can be irritating thorn in my side at times.”
Tony kept slyly glancing at the Winter Soldier as he did his research. Bucky was engrossed in the information. Last night he may have started only looking into it for the “mission,” but now there was a fire in his eyes, a need to
With his heartbreaking and his legs feeling weak, Steve swallowed down his scream of frustration. With a trembling voice, he whispered, “I love you too, love…”
Father Michael fiddled with his phone and eventually declared, “I can’t find anything solid. It’s all mostly conjecture…No one knows what’s happened to him…but that’s normal with celebrities. They’re usually quiet about their private lives…”
Steve shifted his stance slightly. The President of the United States was only a fallback?? It was incredulous. Steve asked, “And your primary target?”
“Since I thought the truth was out there, I took a chance and I asked him out. When he did not reply I immediately assumed the worst!” Tony chuckled, grasping Steve’s hand tighter.
Okay, maybe it wouldn’t be so bad mated to Cap.
Yet before the prosecutor could get out a single word, there was a rustling behind him and the entire courtroom became deathly silent. Steve turned back around, expecting he was going to have to calm Tony down again.
Steve nodded but the flush still lingered in his cheeks. Tony eyed Steve and an unease began to gurgle in his stomach. Steve was clearly unnerved by his minor advances. Last night he said he was fine with this but now that it was actually going into motion was he having second thoughts?
Tony didn’t want Steve to lose heart so he stated, “Don’t say that! Don’t give up!”
“Master Rogers seems to be having a panic attack but wishes to not bother you or the others until he settles it on his own.”
“H-Hello,” Steve was the first to speak and broke a silence that was beginning to grow oppressive.
“It is really him, Miss Potts. I scanned his facial features and compared him to the ones in the national database.”
She grabbed his arms and pulled back the loose sweater to check his skin for damage then tsked when she saw it had her emblem on it.
Bucky had heard stories about life or death situations where people had said their entire lives flashed before their eyes or everything seemed to move slower.
“Small caliber bullet. It breaks the spine but doesn’t kill. I found that out when I tried to kill your friend,” the Red Skull stated.
“I am not giving you a choice,” Steve retorted then left Coulson’s office without another word.
Natasha glanced at Steve and saw the man was purposely staring straight down at the paper to avoid having to look at Stark.
He was in complete darkness, laying on silky material, and enclosed within a tight space. It took him only a few seconds to realize it was a coffin.
,” Natasha growled.
moved out to Switzerland with no fuss.
Tony pulled him into an embrace one last time and Peter slipped away before he could get any more emotional.
“We need to talk,” Tony stated.
Tony sorted and his lips twitched into a small smile. He murmured, “I take after my mom.”
After Natasha guessed his sexuality, she sent Steve a number of articles and links to websites. All of these items confirmed that what he was experiencing was normal and he was not the only person who had such feelings toward people of the same sex. It was the most amazing thing Natasha could have given him. He had always hated that part of himself but, now, he realized he did not have to. He was not a freak, he was normal.
Since he’d arrived at the Tower, Steve had managed to make him eat some more food and Tony had destroyed Peter’s phone and given him a new one. Friday reassured him that all of his contacts were in it as well as all of his apps with all of his content properly saved. The only difference about this phone was that his number had changed and it had tougher security settings.
“Ignatiy?” She guessed another name.
“It’s nothing much,” Bucky murmured self-consciously.
He heard the whistle of his shield blasting through the air and he raise the fist with the wristband. Not a moment later did his shield slam onto his arm, locking in place. The rockets that brought it clipped off and Steve drew the shield in front of him.
Tony collapsed on top of Steve and they lay there panting lightly together. Steve’s heart beat frantically beneath his ear and it was like a resounding assertion of his being alive. Tony pressed his face deeper into Steve’s chest to feel his heartbeat better and remind himself he hadn’t lost his brave soldier yet.
but putty all the same.
Immediately, she berated herself. Schmidt must have seen through their rouse. He must have known they’d go for Steve! They should have taken it into account!! She so foolishly believed Stark's theory that Schmidt would want to go after him to humiliate Steve further! It was on point about that monster's power hungry personality...but he'd
Peter nodded but Tony countered, “But your supervisor would understand if you wanted to call out for the day.”
And then promptly came to a stop as he beheld the new image.
Steve stood off stage and his face was an adorable hue of fire engine red. He was currently wearing a white shirt and khakis and blood rushed into Tony’s cock as he remembered helping Steve strip out of his uniform.
“So it’s paperwork important,” Tony deduced. He nodded to himself and said, “Yeah, I’m not here.” He leaned back down and sought out the gear he was just working with. He mumbled to himself, “Is it weird that I miss the excitement from end of the world important?”
Ever since he discovered Natasha was his soulmate, he had been slowly recovering his memories. The only things he had remembered so far were kills. He’d teach Natasha how to shoot a long range target with a particular rifle and he’d remember killing someone with the same rifle later that night.
Coulson nodded and said, “Alright but we are going to need a report about what happened. We also need to know what you want your next steps to be with the media. The public is demanding answers and you will have to decide how much you are willing to share…”
“It’s already fucking changed! Tell us so we can prevent it from happening!” Bucky argued.
Bucky bent down and picked up his duffle bag. Steve made no move to stop him as he made his way to the door. The fervor to stop Bucky from leaving was gone. Steve no longer trusted himself with him.
He looked back to Tony’s big, hazel eyes and felt his heart pinch. He didn’t want to see upset in those eyes…Tony was young, too young to know the truth.
“When did you realize you were gay?” The reporter continued without pause.
“Do you think we have time for a quick fuck? Because, holy shit, my adrenaline is pumping with victory and I want to celebrate,” Tony gasped into Steve’s mouth.
“If you can get me the paperwork, I’d like to sign myself out,” Steve told the smaller man.
Tony ran to his side and gasped, “Christ, Steve, you’re riddled with holes!”
People were speaking quietly under their breath not too far away. Steve recognized it as Russian and relaxed.
Tony jerked back and broke away from the dream.
This was it. This was the plane Cap had crashed into the Atlantic to save New York. It was Cap’s tomb and inside were the remains of the legend himself.
Tony’s mouth was instantly drawn to Steve’s and he kissed him fully, cupping his jaw as he did. Steve inhaled sharply and Tony’s tongue automatically darted out for a quick taste.
“I can handle Kilian,” Steve interrupted him.
Ever since they’d learned of this alternative future, Bucky had been in full-on protector mode. He shadowed Steve with an unhappy frown and watched him like he was about to combust. Even now, he was looking at Steve like he might be struck down at any moment.
,” she implored.
Steve. He remembered you but still I held back my indignation. We were fighting Hydra, of course that would bring back memories of that period in his life. And when they wiped his mind again and he did not remember you it did not hurt as much.” Natasha paused and stopped her pacing. She gripped her side where she was scarred by Bucky’s bullet and whispered, “And when he saved you from drowning I felt some glimmer of hope that he might have remembered us both…Because that day he shot me, he also did not kill me. He might have remembered me back then too…
“No, he didn’t.” Bruce easily slid out of his weaker grasp and turned to his computer. He opened a tab on his computer to an article entitled: “Vigilante or Villain?”
Steve sat up sharply and called, “Bucky?!”
“You’re dating Deadpool?!” Tony exclaimed.
He dragged his feet over to his bed and pulled out his phone from his pocket. He kicked off his pants and drew off his shirt. He turned off the light and was settling under his covers as he called Wade.
“Waited so long,” Tony panted as Steve tentatively first touched him. He let out a hiss of repressed breath as Steve’s fingers slowly trailed down his shaft. Steve watched Tony’s face. He was enthralled by the lust and love that warred in his expressions. But, when Tony caught his eyes, he held his gaze and love burned through it all. So much so, Steve was positive his expression did the same thing because Tony chuckled and whispered, “You’re amazing.”
They did it. They came out. He had been waiting for this day for so long…it felt like a burden had been lifted from his shoulders and without it he felt like he could fly.
When the punching bag crumpled to the ground Steve growled with frustration and was tempted to stomp down on it.
But his conflicted heart made him bite down on his lips and the knife in his heart twisted more, making it near impossible to breathe, nonetheless reply.
Tony split away from Pepper’s side and came over to him.
Bucky turned back to the stove and Tony leaned against the counter to face Steve and share a smirk with his fiancé.
. It was...it was where his new family was...but he didn’t know how to tell Tony this without it sounding like he meant more.
Venom was safe.
Peter appeared at that moment and his son's eyes narrowed. He announced, “You don't have to put a hold on your life because of me.”
Howard's sincere words reminded Tony that his father had dedicated years of his life to find a cure for Tony and had even looked for Steve to put him to rest.
He tried to think of other things like his upcoming classes or where he should patrol tonight but his mind kept straying back to Tony Stark and Steve Rogers.
Encouraged, Steve became bolder with his mouth and opened his mouth wider to knead the muscles beneath the flesh with his lips and better taste him. Tony's skin had just a hint of the bitter aftershave he used that morning but underneath that he was salty goodness that filled his mouth and coated his tongue.
Marcel strode over to the juror box holding up the photo for all of them to see and asked, “And where was the sample on the dress?”
“No, sir.”
The last thing Steve saw before the darkness ate away at all of his vision was a sign, posted to one of the tents. The letters were blurred but, with it, he recognized the symbols. He had seen that lettering once before with the Howling Commandoes.
Tony was struggling not to laugh at the soldiers’ expressions.
“Shut the fuck up, Barton,” Tony growled.
“Hell yeah,” Tony replied and Steve laughed. He kissed Tony and Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s back. He closed his eyes and ignored the salty dampness coming from Steve.
He kissed Tony and whatever doubts he was feeling vanished with the way his soulmate kissed him. It was innately Steve but also so much more. Tony kissed back wound his arms behind Steve’s head and kissing him as hard and deeply as he could to show the man the true depth of his emotion.
“Okay?”
“Wow,” he whispered and reached out to touch the reflection. The suit was entirely black with a white spider emblem on the front and white eyes. He gasped, “This is so cool.”
Howard paused before they got any closer to the Command tent and turned to Steve with a grin. He sarcastically said, “It certainly is a little crazy to meet your son who has ten plus years on me and a cybernetic implant in his chest…but, I’m glad you guys told me in the end.
The Avengers murmured their confirmations then shouldered their away bags and slipped into the mansion. Steve made it over the threshold before Natasha got a hold of him and dragged him in the opposite direction the rest of the team was going.
The Hydra agents were quick to react however and they pulled out various weapons and fired in retaliation.
“How do we start…?” Peter murmured as soon as Wade latched onto the lube.
Tony picked up the abandoned Hulk toy and yelled, “Onward!”
Their team...no,
Tony returned to his side and Steve’s eyes snapped to him. Steve hissed, “Kill me or it
“I plead the fifth,” Peter retorted smartly. He turned to Wade and asked, “When are they going to get here?”
“Wade!” Peter gasped, pushing away from him. He gawked at Wade, shocked by his indifferent comment. This wasn’t some internet meme to leave a funny comment on. This was Peter’s father! He was a huge part of his life!
They didn’t say a word to each other the rest of the night.
“Hashtag Tacos?”
Steve embraced him in reply and Tony fell into his hold with a relieved sigh. He let his face shield up so he could press his face into Steve’s neck. His skin was damp with perspiration but Tony did not mind getting Steve’s sweat on him. Hell, he was more than happy to at this point.
Natasha tilted her head to the side and asked, “How are you, Peter? Did you get thinner?”
After that exchange, Tony acted like nothing ever happened and had even hopped into Steve’s bed their first night back in the Tower. He had not known Peter was in the bed with him but rolled with it. The three of them slept through the night with Peter nestled between them and Steve and Tony connected by their pressed foreheads and interlocked hands resting on Peter’s belly.
He would have never been able to picture what actually happened.
Tony woke under his touch. He scrunched his nose then beadily opened his eyes. His gaze did not seem to focus on him until he blinked a few times.
The robot owed them retribution but not now. No, right now it was going to help them find a way to save Peter.
Steve: "He was willing to do anything at this point to save Tony and Peter. Anything."
He brought in disgruntled officers to complain about him and the Avengers and civilians who felt like the Avengers could have done more to help them in the hour of need. Tony had called them crybabies and told Steve not to listen to anything they said because they were just whining. Steve tried…but he could not help but agree with the civilians… In certain instances, had they taken a different tactic, more property or lives could have been saved.
Steve woke slowly. He blinked open his eyes slowly and the world was blurred around him. He inhaled deeply and as he exhaled his breath shuddered as it struggled up his throat and then he coughed madly in its great expulsion.
