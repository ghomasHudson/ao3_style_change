Steve could feel his shoulders lose some of the tension coiled within them as his best friend of this century flew past the helicopter  in a red and golden blur. "Iron Man," he greeted, knowing the smile was audible through his voice. “Thanks for coming - the team is fairly low on numbers today, it seems.”
It was at that moment that the welcome tones of Iron Man came in through his comm unit unexpectedly making him jolt.
They collapsed. Some careening into the water, some slamming into the ground either side of Steve. The quiet whumphfs of impact seemed almost serene compared to the splashes of the ones landing in the water soaking Steve.
Peter leaned into his Pa, and pushed as much reassurance into his voice as he possibly could. “No, Pa. He really, really isn’t. He’s really, really good to me. And we’ve been uh…” and here he just
“Wha-?” Tony’s hand clenched and his forearm jerked in an aborted reaction to rub at his forehead, no doubt to soothe the ache that must be present from Steve’s blow. Or wipe away the dried blood that had formed winding trails down his cheek. The itchy sensation of dried blood always did drive the man nuts.
Tony was making even less sense than normal, he didn’t even seem to realise that his identity had been revealed, his gaze instead fixated on Steve, babbling complete and incomprehensible words.
Most days he hoped that he caught Tony’s eye back, but the man seemed to fall in and out of love so fast… it was hard to hope. He was sure he’d heard the man talk about a certain ‘Whitney Frost’ to his butler, Jarvis.
His fingers slowly curled into a fist, as his jaw clenched, uncaring of the fact he was now tugging Tony’s strands in a way that would have been painful if the man were conscious. His azure eyes narrowed, staring at the slackened features of the man, the villain, before him.
The Mansion had been fairly empty – Jan was in Italy showing her work at a Fashion Show, Hank had accompanied her along with Hawkeye who had both been keen to visit Rome for some time apparently. Although, judging from the smirks Clint had exchanged with Tony, it was far more likely that Hank had just wished to spend more time with Jan as opposed to any actual desire to site see. Don had had to leave early for a hospital shift. Steve wasn’t sure precisely where everyone else was; Vision was off somewhere trying to come to terms with the fact that he was created from the brain patterns and memories of Wonderman, while T’Challa had gone somewhere into the city. He had discussed it briefly, but Steve had been too distracted to take in the information.
With a mock stutter of breath in his voice, Steve began to pat Tony’s shoulder softly. “There, there, my dear Pumpkin. I know. I know, my heart. My Moon. It did have to happen at some point.”
Tony then promptly threw his head onto his husband’s shoulder and started to sob in the loudest, most dramatic fashion he could. “But… but Snoodles! How can I be calm when our dear little Pete-y Pie is growing up?!”
As he danced about, jumping or batting against the purposefully flailing limbs, he cast his gaze around attempting to help Iron Man spot the central part. It was not an easy task, it was easy to see that they came from the water, but they didn’t all seem to just appear from one spot which would have made the task that much easier.
Peter, eyes uncharacteristically directed away from his father and hands fiddling with his cutlery, swallowed in another display of nerves before speaking “I wanted to talk to you and Pa about something tonight. And I’m pretty sure you’ll be fine about it. I’m just...nervous? I think? It’s not anything bad! Well. I don’t think it’s bad. I really really don’t want you to think it’s bad. Can we just ...yanno...wait a bit until Pa’s back?”
Tony winced at that, he recognised that thought process. Jarvis had had it too. A complete inability to be able to communicate with anything else technological as he was so far above them. Tony himself sometimes found it lonely, having few people around of his calibre to talk to, but for Jarvis, and it sounded like this thing as well? Well, that was a different level.
“Greetings, Captain. We received reports a few hours ago ago of glowing lights under water just off the coast of Ocean City near Baltimore. Some local agents went to investigate but have not responded to attempted communications since their last response which was…” and here the man took what had to be a pause designed for dramatic effect to scan the papers resting next to him, “Shit. Fuck. That’s fucking huge. That’s aarrrrrrrgh.” The flat tone the words were spoken did nothing to deter from the feeling of horror within them, and the gaze Quartermain turned to Steve was heavy despite the attempted levity of his words. “We haven’t heard anything since.”
Steve grinned. An expression that clearly startled Tony according to the widening of his eyes. He knew the man would offer some bullshit excuse as that. He knew it! He knew that Tony didn’t have any further justification.
As soon as Steve started speaking in his hushed voice, Tony stilled. Every atom tuned in to listen to the man who was speaking as he tried to connect the clues through his painful and muzzy thoughts. It was obvious what the man was referring to. The wipe.
This silence that he currently bore. This was his current weapon. Tony hated silence - could never handle it. It reminded him too much of the silent disapproval that he grew up surrounded by. It made his mind go mad with information. He babbled. Talked to himself, or to anyone who cared to listen. He needed an outlet, an audience.
“I hope he’s alright,” Were Bruce’s slightly more concerned thoughts as he gave his glasses a quick polish.
When Tony came to he didn’t recognise remotely where he was, a sensation he was unfortunately far too familiar with. He was also in some considerable amount of pain. It did not take many movements for him to realise that he’d at least cracked some ribs as well as damaged the bones in his hands from where he must have been attempting to protect his face from being smashed into the pavement. In fact he was fairly certain that there wasn’t actually a single centimetre that wasn’t aching and throbbing in some way.
The whine of repulsors sounded out as Iron Man flew directly up, pirouetting to the side to dodge a loop that attempted to wind around his legs with the all the smooth grace of a cat. No mere tentacle could trap such a man.
the heat rushing into his cheeks. We’ve not been doing anything much really. He said that he knows that 16 is the age of consent, but that still felt pretty young, so we’ve just been, you know, kissing and that kind of thing and making sure we were both happy. I’m his first proper relationship too, and he’s… a little nervous about the way he looks? So we’re taking things slowly.”
Before Tony had a moment to react he was picked up by said tentacles and bashed hard once, twice, three times against the pavement and a nearby lamppost whilst screaming pedestrians ran away as fast as they could.
So it had been peaceful, a peace that Steve had sorely needed after the far too recent events with Dr. Faustus. Steve had been sitting in the kitchen, staring thoughtfully into his coffee as the butter on his sesame bagel slowly coagulated into a greasy, unappealing mess (and yes, if Clint had been there, then he would have accused Steve of brooding. But he wasn’t, so Steve had merely been staring thoughtfully.) Steve was finding the Faustus situation a lot more...unsettling than he was ready to admit to anyone, even himself. The turns his life had taken since he was pulled from the ocean by the Avengers… Even now, some days, he had to spend time when he first woke up figuring out if he was still dreaming, or if this was his life. Add Dr. Faustus’ manipulations on top of that? Well, Steve didn’t think he’d been imagining the increasingly concerned looks that Tony and Jan had been shooting his way. Tony had just begun talking about sending the team on an all-expenses-paid vacation prior to the whole Vision situation, and Steve was savvy enough to realise that it was primarily because their generous benefactor believed that he needed a break. Which was  clearly wrong. He was fine! He just needed to clear his thoughts, that was all.
As Rhodey’s voice trailed off, Steve could easily hear that there were things he wasn’t saying. His position as Tony’s best friend no doubt hard to pass on the other boy’s confidential information, but it was easy to see how concerned the boy was.
It was fairly shortly after that that a beautifully familiar round dish made its’ spinning way into the room. He managed to get out to Steve, gloriously golden Steve, to not hurt the AI, and then? Well. Steve said he passed out.
Much later, when this day was over, Steve would never be able to recall precisely what had happened.
Peter grinned slightly, shaking his head as he accepted the parchment and scrawled out a quick note. “He’s in the year above me and can indeed apparate. Though he hates it, so I’m sure he’ll appreciate the Portkey, Dad. Thanks for making one!” He picked up the quill that Tony had been using earlier and quickly scrawled out a note before attaching it to Butterfingers already waiting leg. He whispered into the owl’s ear then encouraged him to hop up onto his wrist where he provided a launching point. The whole family watched as Butterfingers bunched up his muscles and, with assistance from Peter, launched himself into the air with several graceful flaps. Peter swiftly ducked his head so as to not be knocked by the flapping wings, a movement that he was well accustomed to, and the family watched as the old owl spread his wings and flew off into the early evening sky.
“I didn’t feel like you deserved any of the top-shelf stuff, so a couple of bottles of Jim Beam ought to keep you happy, yes love?”
Steve laid a gloved hand on the cool shoulder, hoping to offer reassurance to the man within. It was unusual to hear the normally unflappable man sound so frustrated. “Steady, Shellhead. You’re not working alone on this. SHIELD is on it, and the others will be here soon. We have time.”
“Prof? How about Prof? Oh I know! Doc! Please please please please can we go with Doc? Why does no one call you that? You’ve got the doctorates! … Though I guess that would open you up to far many “What’s up, Doc?” jokes…Is that a bad thing, though? I really don’t think it is.”
Steve immediately turned around and jogged back downstairs leaving the two friends to it. He found his way to a kitchen, found a glass which he rinsed through a couple of times before filling with nice cold water which he brought back upstairs.
Or were those memories and thoughts a lie? Had they been placed into Steve’s mind just as his other memories had been deleted? As though he were some sort of...computer. Machine.
They started whaling around even faster than before, with six or seven aiming directly for Iron Man.
“Daaaaaaaaad!” Came the voice of their now 17-year old son as he pulled the door leading into the house closed behind him. “That is
Steve sat in his favourite armchair in his and Tony’s apartment, a cold cup of coffee between his clenched fingers, an unappealing skin already forming over the top. He had made it several hours previously and had not thought to take even a single sip. The thought of having anything in his mouth made him feel sick; the bitter taste would churn up the acrid feelings already strung tight within his belly. And he certainly didn’t need any extra caffeine - his skin was thrumming with tension and the want to
Steve could do nothing other than hurl himself at his belaboured friend, throwing them both out the way of the tentacles as they landed together on their feet, Iron Man stumbling as they landed..
“That actually isn’t important. I mean, the name’s Cremin. Cremin James. Do you see what I did there? I named myself in the way that James Bond, you know.” And here, the man actually tried to put on a Sean Connery accent. “The name’s Bond. James Bond. Because, you know, my name’s…James…”
Steve narrowed his eyes, trying to see through the chaos that was unravelling around him. Flashes of red followed by bullets of light as Iron Man fired at the never ending targets time and time again. Different shades of red as tentacles both large and small whipped through the air seemingly without reason other than to beat either of the two small humans attacking them.
“Shit!” came the succinct response, as Iron Man clearly tried to fight against the limbs circling around his shoulder and leg whilst another whirled around him threateningly, firmly placed between the flailing armour and Steve. The same blue-ish white-ish light as previously emitted from one of the tips that was close to the struggling figure scanned it’s way up and down the armoured frame and the beginnings of a scream came through the comms for a moment before they cut out leaving a chilling silence in its’ wake as Iron Man stopped all movement leaving him to slump in the grasp of the tentacles lifelessly. The tentacles grasping the still figure began to slowly move away from the frozen superhero.
This felt like the hardest part of what he had to do to ensure justice was served. Hurting a man when he was down? That was just wrong. But… once again, there was a reason for this.
One part of Steve knew he should be absolutely horrified at this blatant disregard for things that cost so much Steve still found it hard to comprehend. Yet, he could feel the way his eyes crinkled at corners as he shook his head in fond exasperation. The man would just not take the time to get changed post his meetings. Steve had lost count of the amount of times Stark had started rambling about some idea he had just had mid-whatever task he had been in the process of doing and dash off to his workshop in order to investigate the idea more thoroughly. It wasn’t really surprising that he forgot such things as changing his clothes.
In the days of the future, and that future’s future, the actions of this day will bear weight. This day will bring forth memories of hope, joy, sadness, fear, and yes, even grief. For certain individuals… this day, this day, my friend, changes their axis entirely.
His gaze drifted, unseeing, from his mug to the red of his boots, and he rubbed one hand against a toe absentmindedly to wipe a mark off it. He never thought he’d need to be suited up for a moment like this...
Limb after limb flew through the air towards the two heroes, causing them to jump apart to avoid being thwacked.
He could not see the shattered coffee cup, dark brown liquid dripping from the splintered shards which cut lightly into his face. Steve certainly wasn’t attempting to prevent the additional damage.
There was something almost artistic in the way that the splatters of Stark’s blood mingled in with the chilled liquid that Steve determined he would remember. Perhaps he would sketch it in the future. In the present? He certainly wasn’t going to clean up the grotesque combination. Let it set the scene for when Stark regained consciousness.
It turned out he really had been fairly broken. Who knew? Getting slammed into unmovable objects wasn’t good for you when you were a squishy human.
The murky waters made it near impossible to spot the fallen hero, everytime Steve turned around another tentacle obscured his vision. Where was the man?
Tony winced and let his eyes flutter closed for a moment. He did not have the faculties to deal with this. What was the expression the kids used these days? He was out of spoons, every fucking spoon. Serving spoon, pudding spoon… Even those shitty plastic diner spoons that were polluting the ocean. None left. All gone.
Several of the tentacles went still, with little frissions or blue light running up and down causing a juddering movement.
Peter, his cheeks now the colour of the bright red Gryffindor sweater that Wade was wearing (despite the fact that he wasn’t in Gryffindor), rolled his eyes and mirrored his father by burying his head in his boyfriend’s shoulder. “I hate you both.So much.” He muttered.
Tony said nothing as his head slowly slipped down until it was hiding in his hand. “Petey...please. How do you make him stop? And I appreciate the irony of
Anyway. Steve had been contemplating going out for a jog whilst drinking his morning coffee when a ruffled Tony had entered the kitchen. His attire made it obvious that he had not yet been to bed, despite the early hour. His thousands-of-dollars once white, crisp shirt was now wrinkled and covered with grease stains that would surely not come out. His sleeves were carelessly hoiked up to his elbows revealing an expanse of tanned skin that was only marked by similar stains to the man’s shirt. In one hand, his no doubt equally expensive jacket was scrunched carelessly, an improvement on him just leaving it forgotten on one workbench or another as so often happened to Steve’s occasional frustration.
Now, if Steve’s plans went as they ought, the deception would be in his court. Under his control. The way it always should have been. He never should have trusted the genius of many faces. The man had lied to them all from the beginning in those early years when he concealed his identity. All those years and years of friendship that slowly kindled into passion and love. How many times had Tony been untruthful because he believed he knew better. How many times had he believed his genius made him always correct.
The next twenty minutes or so of flight passed by rapidly as the pair discussed the scant information available from the briefing pack and tried to form some kind of plan beyond ‘go and have a look to see what’s there’
In so many ways, this was Steve’s favourite version of the business man stroke engineer. The man’s attractiveness was beyond question, and Steve found his gaze resting on the blue-eyed man far too frequently. He just had an inherent beauty within him that caught Steve’s eye, whether it was the way he moved with such rapid, unthinking, yet genuine, gestures as he threw his hands around to articulate one point or another.  His hands, those elegant digits, told such a story. The old, thick calluses marked him as a hard worker who didn’t rely on others to do the work for him. The oil embedded far too deeply under the beds of those manicured fingernails...The way he always seemed to be ahead of everyone else in the room.
His teammate’s name reverberated over and over again in his thoughts as he hunted under the water, the name itself unable to pass from his firmly clenched shut lips.
Steve narrowed his eyes as he observed a shiver dance its way up and down Tony’s spine. Perhaps the man was beginning to know fear, was beginning to realise that he hadn’t gotten away with his malevolent scheme this time. Perhaps he was only now sliding into that moment of pre-warning, of seeing how things were about to go. Perhaps he was finally registering the fury that Steve just knew was visible within his own eyes. Steve allowed a smirk to cross his lips at the dawning horror that was growing within Tony’s eyes. Those plump lips that Steve loved to kiss with such passion parted in speech but were only able to utter a “So”... before Steve cut in.
Peter and Tony both snickered, their faces creasing into the precise same expression, something that never failed to amuse Steve. He noticed that, as usual, Tony didn’t share a similar experience from his own youth. But Tony had had a less than ideal upbringing, despite the money that ‘Ye Greate and Wealthy House of Stark’ had been able to sling around without care. He rarely spoke about his parents when Peter was around, and, bless the boy, Peter was sensitive enough to not ask questions. He instead indulged in the love and adulation that Sarah, Steve’s own mother, bestowed on her favourite grandson.
Otherwise? There were astonishingly few marks on the skin to show the tale of this encounter. Had Steve done enough? The anger still curling in his belly said no. As his stare bore into the drunkard before him a plan slowly began to form.
Eventually, it was late enough to send Wade home. Peter had been yawning for a good half an hour and Tony was snuggled up practically in Steve’s lap, dark eyes barely focusing on the conversations carrying on above his head. DUM-E was curled up on his wizard’s backside, his white paw sticking out as he attempted to lick at it every now and again. That and battered said owner’s head frequently with his tail every time he got remotely excited by the sight of a moth or other flying insect.
Steve chose that moment to return, three mugs of hot chocolate born safely within his giant hands, and frowned as he caught the last of Tony’s words and picked up on the tension in Peter’s frame. “Something you want to tell us, Petey? I agree with Tony, by the way, just to make that clear. We love you, so so much.” He placed the mugs down on the table and sat himself down on Peter’s other side, hoping that his son felt supported and loved rather than hemmed in. He leaned in so that he bumped Peter’s shoulders lightly, but didn’t put an arm around him the way Tony already had. That may be a step too far and make the lad feel too pressured.
The thought again crossed his mind of what else he’d been lied to about. What other thoughts had been implanted. Was Stark really at the Stark International offices today as he’d stated that morning? Or had he been squirreled away with his co-conspirator, Richards, building more weapons to rail against some overblown cause.
“Hi Prof Stark-Rogers! How’s it hanging for a banging? Hi Prof Rogers-Stark! I come in peace, honest. Please don’t kill me for wanting to...you know… with your son? Don’t make it so that I’m coming in pieces… Your son loves me! Think of his pain!”
“Iron Man, what if they can extend? Like Mr. Fantastic.” There was a pregnant pause over the radio waves and Steve just knew that if the armoured figure hadn’t been in the middle of some daring pirouette dive thing that challenged the laws of gravity as Steve knew them whilst simultaneously dodging three limbs and two tips then he’d have probably been hitting his face with his gauntlet.
Steve continued to ignore his husband’s words, and just allowed his stare to remain steadily on the naked man. It was wonderful this way. He could see every flex of the muscle as Tony tested the hold the ropes held on him. He could see the controlled breaths Tony determinedly took as he struggled to maintain both the anxiety and anger that were warring within him clear as a picture across his bloody face. There was a wonderful imbalance between them that currently that Steve had never felt before. The feeling of being in his superhero costume just reminded him that he was on the side of Good. Lawfulness. Right.
I practised saying this so much! I just kind of have a friend. Who’s a boy. And he’s kind of a boyfriend. Sort of. I like him a lot. And we hold hands and stuff. And. Just. I
It was moments like this that Iron Man revealed himself to be just as whip smart as his employer, Stark. Steve had no idea how the other man was able to work out where this ‘central mass’ could be, surely the amount of variables and calculations could not be completed in those few seconds that the man had taken. But he had somehow done it. And had done it many times in the past with skills that quite took Steve’s breath away. “Deploy away, Shellhead, with extreme prejudice.”
Part of him wanted to careen to the floor vomiting until he could be certain that nothing alien resided inside him other than his own organs and skeleton. The... violation he felt. He couldn’t find words for it. Knowing that someone who purported to love him could then turn around and have a hand in orchestrating having his mind wiped. As simple as if his mind were a dirty plate requiring cleaning. Nausea curdled in his gut as the mental image of the group of them, the Illuminati, laughing with each other as they surrounded his prone figure. Laughed at his… stupidity. His naivety in trusting them. Any of them.
And Iron Man? He went with them, hurtling into the water without a sound of protest despite Steve’s horrified cries.
“You might need to work on it a bit,” grinned back Steve, glad that the ice appeared to have broken. “Anyway, Tony?”
As Iron Man engaged the enemy, Steve hopped back several paces to try and give himself some breathing room as well as an opportunity to evaluate the battle.
“We… We had to. There was no choice, Steve. You have to understand. You left us no choice! You just didn’t understand. The weapons were the only thin-”
And the onslaught began, limbs flying everywhere and anywhere as they tried to strike the two Avengers leaving cracks on the earth from the force of their hits each time they missed.
Steve brought it up with his friends, but no one seemed hugely concerned. “He probably has a stomach bug or something, You know, puking and shitting.” were Bucky’s charming words.
It adored to troll Clint and refused to toast his bread correctly, so was probably his favourite toaster yet.
Steve took a deep breath in, still relishing, even after all these years, the ease in which he could fully expand his rib cage, and exhaled. He strode his way to a chair with carefully measured steps, and placed himself lightly within it. He rested his elbows on his bent knees and, steepling his fingers together, rested his chin upon them. His gaze bored its way into his husband’s peacefully resting frame, searching for any of the deceit that its brain was so capable of.
His horrified words were interrupted by both his evil parents snickers of pure amusement. “I hate you. Both of you.” He muttered, hands covering his face in a vague attempt to regain some dignity. Both his parents, damn them, just laughed.
Now the amusement disappeared and concern was easily present. “I actually don’t know, man. He isn’t responding to texts or anything. Went off-grid on Saturday – we usually game online on Sundays. It’s not like him. I’m going round tonight after school to check on him as his bastard Dad’s out late at meetings every Wednesday.”
“We’ll sort it, Shellhead” his spare hand reached into the suit to wipe away the combination of tears mixed with blood from one filthy cheek with a sodden handkerchief he pulled from one of his pouches. “Rest now. We’ll sort it.” He didn’t know how, or when. He didn’t know what the future would entail. How the rest of the team would react to this news. How he would react to Iron Man’s identity. There were so many unknown variables.
Wade bounced over, bright smile wide spread over his lips. “Good evening! How are your holidays going? Man, Prof. Rogers-Stark, you look so much less imposing than you do at school! Tony, Dad. Can I call you Dad?”
to me. We could have come up with something… We would have. It’s what we do. We’re a team. I… I love you. Loved. I don’t even know! How can I love you after what you did?”
Steve, book held at an awkward angle to account for his husband’s lying all over him, nodded in an absent minded fashion. “You might have mentioned it once or twice,” he mumbled, more to show he was paying attention. “Bruce was not pleased. He wanted her in his classes. He said she showed aptitude in Transfigeration too, and was wasted just cooking things.”
A smirk danced across Steve’s lips as he seized the fear treading its way into his mind and batted it back, converting the emotion into anger. Anger, he could deal with anger.
And now? Two posteriors rested on it, one owner of said posterior leaning on the taller one next to him as its’ owner feverishly worked on his planning for the oncoming term.
Steve’s lip curled upwards in a light snarl as he cut through whatever drivel, whatever… bullshit the man before him was going on about.
Steve shot a glance towards his team-mate, concerned. It was so unlike Iron Man to be reacting like this. The man was always the epitome of control and dependable mixed up with the occasional sarcastic quip. “Steady, Shellhead.” he echoed his earlier comment, not knowing what else to say.
Tony’s tongue would loosen enough to give Steve his answers, and then they could go back to normal. Both their minds would be damaged. Both of them would be doubting their realities.
He traced his eyes over the handsome face, the gorgeous, muscled body hidden beneath those rumpled clothes, suit jacket already slung carelessly to the floor in an act that usually irritated Steve. Searching. Hunting for some indicator that this man, this stranger dressed up as his once adored husband was lying to him. Trying to pull even more wool over his eyes. This...This..
The villain cannot be allowed to live. He's broken out of five prisons in ten years, and each time, innocent people got in his way and ended up either injured or dead.
, and the man spins off into the darkness. She gags and drops to the floor, listing drunkenly on her feet before her body drops her on one knee. Panic hammers at her temples, and her head spins nauseatingly.
He stands for a long time in front of the armor, running his palm across shiny gold and gleaming red, trying to swallow past the lump of emotion solidified in his throat. “I am Iron Man,” he says softly, and it still rings true, because it always will as far as he’s concerned, but it doesn’t feel as solid as it used to.
A bullet whines off the forearm of her armor, scratching the paint and digging a furrow in the dirt. Toni makes an unimpressed noise and looks up The HUD tracks the target – the second guard, no doubt alerted to her presence by the utter ineptitude of the first guard. The targeting system calculates her angles, his cover. He’s speaking into his radio, voice high but steady, rattling off something that sounds like a warning in maybe Turkish. The rifle cracks again, and a bullet buries itself in the ground between her boots.
“Now?” This would be an excellent time for a sea monster to rise out of the Pacific or an invasion of aliens or a plague of rodents of unusual size for that matter. Unfortunately, no world-ending disaster or invasion of gigantic vermin to save her from being an adult. She takes a deep breath. “Yeah, okay,” she says, taking the plunge. “Let’s talk.”
“Sometimes,” he says, and she feels him kiss her forehead, a light pressure she barely senses. “Go back to sleep, Toni. I’ll be here when you wake up.”
“Jeez, yes mom,” Toni mutters. “You gonna watch me strip, or can I have some privacy? I mean, I literally just broke up with you, so you should totally give me my space now.”
The last dregs of the insane fury drain away, leaving a hollow, tired feeling behind. She links her fingers over his shoulder, sags a little while she has the time to close her eyes. “I’m so pissed at you,” she says, feels him go tense under her palms. “There are
She checks her flight plan, trajectory, calculates the distance and time it would take her to travel back to New York if he tells her to come home. “What happened?”
“You may think you were justified, and perhaps you were,” Natasha continues in that slow, deadly cadence, “but you did not have backup, you almost died, because you did not think of me, or Clint or JARVIS or Pepper or even yourself. In the future, you will remember you are not an independent operator. In the future, you will remember you have people who love you enough to march into hell. And this will not happen again. Nod if you understand what I'm saying.”
She is on her way to meet Clint at Miceli’s, and is running behind schedule. Her morning had been spent interviewing the final pool of applicants to fill out the administration staff, and her last interview – a woman named Virginia Potts, who goes by Pepper, whose personnel file she purloined from Stark Industries; seriously, the woman was wasted in the secretarial pool over there, MB from Harvard, years of management and retail experience at a variety of upscale chain stores, and they have her taking dictation and fetching coffee – ran overlong. But since she managed to grab Pepper as her Chief Operating Officer, she’s counting it as a solid win and an excellent excuse to present to Clint for her tardiness.
He’s just glad JARVIS’d been more than happy to help him make arrangements, because Bucky would otherwise still be helplessly scrolling through date idea websites, trying to figure out what to do.
Purifying fire flares around his fingers, his hand, screams in absolute fury as it boils from his body, and the vein flash-burns into ash and cosmic dust.
Gradually, she realizes that Clint has gone silent. She turns to look at him, and he is staring at her with naked fear. “What if she dies, Nat? What if we get there, and we’re too late? What if--”
Even after Toni waves their politely-tolerant soulmate off with a fond roll of her eyes and dramatic sigh, Bucky stays with her, letting his mind work at the thing niggling under his thoughts while he watches her from the corner of his eye. There is absolutely fuck all in her stance, expression, or way she’s moving to indicate anything’s wrong, but the feeling he’s just not seeing something refuses to go away.
Clint's head goes down, and the plastic of the water bottle crackles in his white-knuckled hand. He sucks in a single shuddering breath and lets it out in a rush. “Coming from you…” he says, and shakes his head.
He lurches to the side as the arm drops like a rock, off-balance and reeling. Another enemy steps into view, carrying something that looks like a rocket launcher but shoots out a bundle of wires and ropes and dancing sparks that hit him and wrap around him, tangling his arms and legs before washing his awareness away in sheets of snapping white pain.
For a long moment, all she can hear is the scream of the air over her suit, the faint hum of servos and repulsors, and her own harsh panting echoing inside the helmet.
He lets himself rise into the sky, until he can reach out and lay a hand on one of the cosmic-blue veins, and images of a very young, very small Steve flash past his closed eyelids. It would be tooth-rottingly adorable, if tiny Steve wasn't dressed in Junior Hydra clothing, helping his mother with her Nazi quilting bees. Instead of being charmed, Tony is horrified beyond all measure to see that broad, happy smile forming the words “Hail Hydra” without irony.
She turns to move back to the table, and an arm snags her around the waist, tugs her solidly into a chest. She may let out a high-pitched, undignified squeal, but she’ll deny it to the end of her days. She also definitely does not flail or slap at the arm, shrieking like a banshee.
The guard’s eyes are as round as dinner plates, flicking between her and somewhere behind her. Toni can take a pretty educated guess at what’s murdering the hamster on his wheel:
Tony turns around and there’s Steve, an arguably violent shade of red and his eyes looking everywhere but at Tony’s face, as anxious in appearance as that timid tone suggests.
Coulson’s smiling again, that fond, eye-crinkling smile. “I think they’re already yours, Toni, but I’ll take care of the official channels.”
“Don’t even,” Clint warns, voice a mumble in her shoulder, and the fingers threaded in her hair scratch at her scalp, light and gentle.
He’s on his hands and knees when she reaches him, head low and shaking back and forth. She grabs his nearest shoulder with her gauntleted hand and flips him onto his back. She throws a leg over his chest and fists her free hand in the hem of his torn undershirt, balling it up for leverage. Her eyes flick down as the cloth drags free of bloody skin, caught by a splash of color.
“Why would she?” Frigga asked wryly. “Godhood never comes before the Test of Virtue at twenty. She certainly won’t suspect it’s come for her now.”
In another life, Toni might like Sharon Carter. Under the bullshit SHIELD agent persona, she seems friendly and fun. In another life, Toni might even invite her out for drinks, get to know her, probably even take her to bed, because she's got that sense about her, the one Toni's practically attuned to, the one that says
Steve moves to her side, slings an arm around her shoulders and steps onto her boots. Her arm automatically moves around his waist. “You won’t,” he says, with perfect confidence that does weird, fluttery things to her stomach and throat. And then she feels the faint vibration of the static locks on the palm of his glove and the soles of his boots charge and connect, holding him more securely than Fort Knox against her. “Mostly,” he adds, “because you already thought of it.”
“Oh, I am,” he says cheerfully. “I’m so fucking angry, I want to track him down, slice off his cowardly fucking balls, and ram them down his goddamn throat. But I know you. You could have taken him apart if you wanted to. So I’m just a raging fucking tower of pissed off, but I’m taking your lead here.”
She fights through the pain, gets back to her feet and keeps going. Twenty feet. Behind her, she hears the ring of vibranium on tile, figures he must have just picked up the shield. Ten feet. She slams her palm on the biometric scanner, and the maintenance door opens. She darts inside and slams it closed just as his shadow falls over her.
Tony closes his eyes, hears the sickening impact of the arrow into the back of Banner’s skull again, heroically chokes back the urge to vomit. “No,” he says, strangled. “It wasn’t your fault.”
“All compliments of the world-renowned Black Widow Learn to Fight Before She Kills You training program,” she says lightly, and holds out her bounty for them to pick. “Free membership comes with employment. Also membership in the Hawkeye School of Shooting Stuff Til It Stops Moving.”
He stares ferociously up at her, prowling below like a goddamn predator. “I want to know why,” he snarls. “Why did she have to die? Was it because of me? Was that the only reason?”
“A handcuff knot,” she grumbles, and pulls her feet up to rub some heat back into the ice cubes she calls toes. “It doesn’t mean what you think it means, you inept
“Do it,” she says. Sees Coulson eying her. Will deal with that later. A holo screen appears, frozen on the image of a blonde woman with a bun and terribly tacky black glasses.
“I wouldn’t have cared,” Toni says, and he’s got just enough presence of mind to register that her breathing is sharp and shaky. “I wouldn’t have cared. Ninety-eight percent.”
Instead, they’ve decided on a game of “anything you can do, I can do better”. Clint is doing remarkably well, considering he is entirely unaugmented and competing with a supersoldier. She keeps an eye to the scoreboard which, for some ridiculous reason, both Clint and Bucky have insisted on running. She quirks an eyebrow as the numbers tick according to the arcane rules they established prior to heading in.
“As I recall,” Toni says primly, slips away from the circle of Bucky’s arms in a lingering fashion, and sets each hand on a hip, “you aren’t much better, despite the whole—” A hand lifts to wave vaguely at him. “—wholesome Captain America schtick. You are a filthy soul, Steven, and don’t pretend you’re not.”
She stares at him blankly for a long moment as her brain tries to process that information. “What? No. What?” Her brain catches up, and her stomach twists, and she’s pretty sure the shock has her face in a rictus of grossness. Oh god, can the floor just fucking open up and swallow her whole? “Oh god, no. No. Ew. Ew! Jesus, Rhodey, why would you ask that!”
Before he can hit the ground, she’s flying, parallel to the floor. She slams into him with the approximate force of a fully-loaded semi, and feels more than hears the explosion of breath as his body bows around the curve of her shoulder guard.
Toni’s breath catches, and her pulse flutters in her throat. She hadn’t doubted, not really, because he was more physically expressive than verbally, but it’s the first time he’s said it out loud. “Aw, Clint, I love you too,” she says. “If I’d known this is all it would take to get you to admit it, I’d have had myself kidnapped
Toni swears viciously under her breath, a steady stream of epithets in four languages -- none of them English -- and pulls the wheel hard to the right as the road takes a sharp curve. “Probably not, darling,” she says through gritted teeth. “Now would you be an absolute peach and
“This is the only self I’ve got! You can’t take it, fine! Don’t take it! Just run back to your fake soulmate already. You think you can fix me, make me better’n him.” He watches every flinch, every twitch, every blink, and something dark and twisted and knotted revels in the hurt and the pain he’s inflicting. “You’re too fucking stupid to realize that you can’t fix everything.  I don’t fuckin’ want you to fix me. It’s
For some reason, Hogan looks amused as he spares Steve a quick glance. “Yessir. I head up security at Stark Solutions now, but I started in the transportation department as a driver. Toni didn’t mention?”
to breathe. He closes his eyes as he gasps in a good, solid lungful of the Moon’s deadly atmosphere, and finds that interestingly (but not really surprisingly), his last thought is to wish Steve was here with him.
“Good,” he says, heartfelt, and kisses her neck, murmuring, “I’m sorry it got so fuckin’ out of hand, Toni.”
“It will. Just give it some time, Captain,” the nurse says, and jabs the needle into his shoulder. A quick press of the plunger, and she withdraws it again, swabbing over the spot with an alcohol wipe. “If I could give you a pill or a liquid, Captain, I would,” she adds, sticking a completely unnecessary bandage over the injection site. “But your metabolism burns so fast, it wouldn’t have time to leave your stomach before the effects were gone. Now, try to get some rest before your wife comes by. Clear your mind. Things will look easier soon.”
Steve’s a romantic at heart. He likes stories with happy endings. He likes grand gestures of affection. Poetry. Fanciness. It should be like a fairy tale, a feeling of belonging and completion, a drawing-together of what God has set down. Like it was with Bucky, all those years ago. And for a moment, he has hope. Hope that maybe the potential for bonding between them will be enough to get them through the horror, past the pain.
And then, they sent him after Toni, knowing who she was, twisting and manipulating and playing with his mind until he was driven to kill, driven to destroy, driven to completely
She closes her eyes, burrows back down under the blanket. “Fuck off, it’s too early. Why’m I in your lap?”
Toni stops, blinks, runs through her last few statements in her head. Closes her eyes. “Well, fuck.” Shoots a glare at Bucky. “He might not have noticed that if you didn’t bring it up, you know.”
“Understood. Would you like to warn sir and Clint about the start of your training program, Natasha?”
Obie’s old-school, though. Toni’s pretty sure that, if Obie and her father had had it their way, she would have gone to study liberal arts or music or philosophy or some other utterly pointless and boring waste of education. There was more than one reason she’d been glad to move to Boston at 15, even with Rhodey ostensibly paid to report her every twitch, sneeze and fart to Howard.
His whole life is here, exactly what Doctor Fennhoff told him was only a dream, a fantasy-world based on another man’s life. He wanders between the displays for he doesn't know how long, lost in memories he thought were illusions.
Also by popular demand, I will be writing an alternate take on this universe's soulmates thing. Y'all kinda like Clintashoni a bit, huh? :) It's a secondary priority right now, and I'm aiming for a 10k one-shot to explore what might have happened if Natasha took it on herself to challenge Fate for a ret-con of Toni's soulmarks. Look for it in the near future. :)
Tony's smile is so bright, it hurts his face. “Toucan play at this game,” he says. “But I find myself desperately egretting every life choice that led me to this moment.”
“But it’s really hard on us to see you like this,” Pepper says, still in that soft tone, and it sounds like she’s on the verge of tears on top of it. “Not to mention what it does to our stocks. I know you don’t really care about those, Toni, but I do. It’s why you hired me in the first place, to care about the things that you pathologically can’t find interest in. And I am very good at my job, Toni. Very good.”
Bucky’s grinning like an idiot, and a wave of aching need clenches a fist around his heart, strong and sudden. He sits in the pilot’s chair, closes his eyes, and tilts his head back to listen to their voices. Already the itch in his skin is receding, soothing away, fading to nothing, his restlessness calming with the voices of his soulmates in his ears.
“Steve, it’s 2012, not 1944,” Peggy says, quiet but firm, and pulls a small black device from her pocket. It clicks and beeps under her thumb, and she turns it towards him, showing photographs, changing them one by one with the push of a thumb. Him and Peggy, with dogs around their feet. Him, serious and sober, in the Captain America uniform with a red flower lapel pin and the rows of crosses in Arlington behind him. Picture after picture. Evidence of a life together. Wedding photos. Candid photos.
Steve, in an attempt to derail this conversation, decided it best to change the subject. “So, did you have a nice birthday then, Peter? How was Harley? Other than being impressed by your ability at doing spells outside of school.”
Some of the deep red tentacles somehow… detached? And started careening through the air at truly ridiculous speeds independently of the now slightly shorter tentacles they’d left behind. Steve could attest to how much they hurt when they snuck up behind and rammed him in the back. Bruises, thankfully, rather than broken bones. But it was just one more reason to try and find a way to wrap this up as fast as possible.
“Good,” Bucky says, firm and confident, but Toni can see the relief in his expression. “We’ll work it all out when it happens.” He pauses, and his mouth turns up in one corner, a lopsided boyish smirk that Toni dearly wishes he wore more often. “You think they’re gonna be a lady, huh? Why’s that?”
Frigga had been giving that some thought too, in the moments between consoling her distraught and confused children. “I will train her, far more gently than the Norns would. I have the gift of foresight and prophecy. I can show her how to control it.”
“Wasn’t it?” Pepper continues, relentless. “You’ve been nearly killed four times by my count in the last four months, and I know they weren’t in their right minds at the time, but they’re
Somewhere in there, he loses his pants as he pins her to the wall again, bending his head to suck hungrily at her breasts and neck. Her breath judders noisily, high and soft and keening. “James,” she breathes, and her nails rake up his back as her hips roll, sliding the soaking lips of her sex along his shaft.
He mentally navigates the labyrinthine circuits and pathways of the system as he carefully picks his way through the half-removed debris and scattered tools and equipment left behind by the absentee workers. All this needs to be the perfect setting for a horror movie is a big-chested blonde and some sparking, flickering lighting.
She smiles at him with dry, cracked lips, because he’s real, because he’s there, because he came for her. "Wheels’re up,” she croaks. “I want my fucking ice cream now."
“How long until Clint and Tash get here?” she asks, and if her voice is flat, well… she doesn’t have the energy to put into locating an appropriate tone either.
“Delete them all.” It’s out of his mouth before he can think about it, but once he does, he doesn’t take them back.
Steve’s grin is bright and sudden, and he slides his hand up over her shoulderplate to hook around the back of her neck. “You’re far too late for that,” he says. “I was on a USO tour, after all. I caught more than one eyeful of someone else’s fun along the way.”
“I thought Morgan was going to get the inheritance,” she says, and flinches back when he raises his hand again.
Rhodey is right on her ass when she exits the plane, and she scowls at him from under the hand shielding her eyes from the sun. “Problem, Colonel Rhodes?” she snaps.
He can’t even get the full sentence out before his instincts are screaming that it’s false. He closes his eyes, and the headache constantly lurking behind his eyes throbs forward. “I am the successor to….” The headache surges, the nausea churns, and he swallows hard. “My mother was Sarah Rogers. She died of breast--”
“Nah,” she says, waving a hand. She has to force the cheer, but not the underscore of tiredness. She has curated the hell out of her personal life in Malibu, she’s created a space where she can relax and build and argue with Pepper about business plans and chew out her overpaid chief engineer when he tells her a design simply can’t be done when her blueprints show
“I know,” Coulson says agreeably, “but I can personally vouch for their trustworthiness. I think you’ll like FitzSimmons. You have a lot in common.”
Clint doesn’t yell, or fist his hands or anything remotely threatening. He simply stands there, staring them both down with calm, hard eyes, and says, “I have officially given my last fuck where you two assholes are concerned. I’m very sorry you were mind-controlled. I’m sure it must have sucked Satan’s balls. But this is two for two, and Toni is on the edge of breaking something that can't be fixed. Girl's got a heart the size of the fucking moon, so she's not going to hold anyone but Hydra responsible for what happened.
Solid ground beneath her feet suddenly, the wooden floor of a dim room lit only by an oil lantern on a table beside a narrow bed with the silhouettes of two people lying curled together under the blankets. She doesn’t consciously move, but finds herself behind the bed anyway, looking down at the mattress. It takes her a few seconds to recognize Steve and Bucky, because Steve is so small he’s practically buried under Bucky, and Bucky… Her breath catches in her throat, because Bucky is much younger, with two flesh-and-bone arms, unlined and unwearied from his years with HYDRA.
“Alright, junior,” she says, eyeing the tracking data on the edges of the HUD. They’re right behind her, slightly below. “Let’s see how you handle this.” She decelerates abruptly, diving for a few hundred feet. As she sails past the formation, she rolls onto her back, bringing her arms up, palms out.
Bucky sighs, crouches beside her, tries a different tactic and reaches out to smooth a wayward lock of hair back behind her ear with his fingers. “Toni, c’mon. Talk to me. Tell me what’s going on.”
She leans on her fingertips on Howard’s desktop, like she’s looming over an invisible, cowering minion. She smooths her palms over the scarred cherry wood, sighs low and quiet through her nose, and sits down in Howard’s chair like she’s ascending a throne.
He glances back at the open door, through which Steve’s broad shoulders are just barely visible, hesitating. Maybe Steve is right, and he doesn’t have the capability yet to deal with all the shit that’s happened to him. Maybe he needs someone he can trust at his back, someone who can spot the things he’s missing.
“JARVIS will let me know,” Coulson says. Fuck, he must have heard everything. “I’ll handle it from here.”
The agent hurries away, and Steve flips through the screenshots on the tablet again, forehead furrowed in thought. In hindsight, he should have expected something like this to happen. Tony’s nothing if not resourceful, even when he has no resources to draw from.
“Yeah,” Toni whispers, swallows hard and her eyes crumple at the corners. “Yeah.” She reaches out for Natasha, who takes her hands and gently pulls her into a hug. Toni buries her face in the crook of Natasha’s neck, and her arms go around Natasha’s waist. She sighs, soft and deep, and Bucky watches the tension in her back and shoulders just dissolve away.
“Toni.” The word slips out automatically, and then he remembers. He throws himself away from her, scrambles off the bed and onto the floor. He presses his palms into his face, panic and fear and guilt punching him in the gut as she starts coughing and sucking in air. “Jesus, Toni. Jesus fucking Christ, I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”
Toni sits with her fingers steepled, elbows on the table and tips of her index and middle fingers pressing into the curve where her nose meets her forehead, breathing evenly. Around her, chaos reigns as Clint and Natasha -- mostly Clint -- rage at Coulson for the content of Morse’s message, while Bucky stalks like a caged lion.  Rhodey and Carol are equally as strident, throwing out plan after plan of attack, everything from surgical strikes to all-out assault aided by SEAL teams because it’s
There are days when Phil wishes he’d taken a different career track. It’s not that he has regrets, exactly, but sometimes he thinks it would be nice to not be the one left holding the bag when everything goes pear-shaped.
the fuck ahead,” Toni snarls. “You think I need Fury’s floating fortress of feds to keep SI going? Newsflash, sweetheart. My life would be a lot less fucking stressful without all the secret agents I have constantly crawling into my ass. I am the top name of my fucking industries, Carter. I don’t
Toni chokes. Flails. Reels. Sees stars. Clint, alarmed, thumps her on the back until she remembers how to breathe.
Tony closes his eyes for a moment, fights down the uncertainty and doubt, then sighs. “Making sure Kobik doesn’t start enlisting you all against your will,” he says quietly, and hears/feels/senses the semi-jovial mood in the army around him plummet into something darker and grimmer. “And making sure that Steve comes back to us, without all the crazy Nazi crap she stuffed in his head.”
Tony comes to with an awareness that’s as sudden as it is disconcerting. He is instantly awake and aware, which is more than a little unsettling when he finishes processing his surroundings and realizes he’s sprawled in the dust at the base of the Watcher’s Citadel with no memory of how he got there or
Toni doesn’t relinquish control easily, rails and rages against the necessity, mutinies when it’s wrested away, tests her limits even when she grudgingly submits to an authority figure. Mostly because authority figures are usually grade-A morons who she wouldn't trust to tie her shoes, let alone command her in battle. The kind of assholes who summoned her before a Congressional hearing, tried to take Iron Maiden away, let
“Totally valid,” she says honestly, and plops back down on the couch. She peels the lid off the container and flings it across the room before shoving the spoon in. “Jesus, now I really need the ice cream. Why the hell would you even ask something like that?”
She reaches up with arms that feel like lead, pulls his head down. Their noses touch, and it’s only then that she realizes that she’s not hallucinating him. She might be hallucinating the steady overhead beat of helicopter rotors, may be hallucinating Clint, cradling her head in his lap and stroking her forehead. But Rhodey is real, smells like jet fuel and smooth cologne, sun and wind and the laundry soap he’s been using since college.
“Aye, Iron Phoenix,” Thor calls over her shoulder, voice loud enough to carry over without the comms, as she sails past him with Mjolnir extended.
He tries to sit up, but the two do something with the poles, and shove him back down. Belatedly, he realizes they’re control nooses, and the nooses are around his throat. His thoughts are slow and hazy, sluggish. He’s been drugged enough that he’s not going to be able to fight his way free any time soon.
Fuck, he really should have tried harder to sleep. Hovering on the verge of homicide, he thinks, is not an appropriate mindset for watching one’s soulmate undergo some vaguely-explained medical procedure that’s supposed to cut her healing time to a bare fraction of what it would otherwise have taken. Bucky can smell the
“I adapted,” JARVIS says. Pauses. Deadpans, “I have added your technological distinctiveness to my own.”
“I think the worst damage I’ve ever seen Toni recover from,” Clint says unexpectedly, and Bucky starts enough that coffee sloshes over his hand, “has to be the shit she came back from Afghanistan with.” His head barely turns, eyes sliding over to Bucky briefly before returning to Toni, unconscious on the bed below them. “I thought she was fucking dead when we found her. She’s always been curvy, you know? Hips that…” His hands trace a shape in the air, outlining generous curves, then fall into his lap. “She never fell into that ideal weight bullshit. Never ordered salad when what she wanted was steak. Didn’t guilt herself when she wanted cheesecake or ice cream or donuts for breakfast. She didn’t have the habit of skipping meals for days at a time because
“Of course, Clint,” JARVIS says pleasantly. “Colonel Danvers’ permissions have been updated to reflect her temporary change in status to the Acting Head of the Avengers Initiative, in the absence of both Deputy Directory Stark and Deputy Director Barnes. Welcome, Deputy Director Danvers.”
A shiver jerks through his body, rocking him towards her. “Jesus Christ,” he says helplessly. “That’s really fuckin’ not fair.” With the movements of a man doing something against his better judgement, he slides under the covers and lays on his back, tense and staring at the ceiling.
After a warm bowl of chicken noodle soup and a hot shower, both of which occur with a supremely unamused supersoldier standing over her and glaring to ensure she behaves herself, Toni is dead on her feet. She hits the bed face-first with her hair still wet and the towel still around her body, and is asleep before she can finish bouncing.
Toni swims back to consciousness and immediately regrets it. The lights are dim, but still stab into her eyes like devil’s pitchforks, and her head has that tender feeling, like someone scooped out parts of her brain and overstuffed her skull with cotton. Her throat is screaming for water, and her mouth is dry and gummy, tongue thick and clumsy.
She sinks down to her knees beside him, telegraphing her movements. He tenses, but holds himself still. Her palm slides over his shoulders, slow and careful, stroke broadly down his spine, smooth back up. It feels solid and real, like an anchor in a shitstorm, and he slowly relaxes.
He scrolls through the messages, and each one he reads sinks needle claws into his chest. Message after message, full of old memories and blatant flirting, sexual innuendo and open invitations. There’s a dull roaring sound in his ears that reaches a painful pitch when he realizes that
Tony throws up his hands. “Fine. Whatever you say, Barton. Fair warning though. If I end up in a coma again, or worse, I’m haunting your ass for eternity.”
of all fucking people, something that was supposed to stop seizures, for chrissake. Stole the fucking arc reactor out of her fucking chest. That’s why she doesn’t like it when people hand her things. That’s when she lost the ability to trust people. I mean, kidnapped by terrorists, operated on without anaesthesia in a fucking germ-infested
She isn’t up there very long – or maybe she’s been up there for hours, she doesn’t know. She loses track of time easily when she’s absorbed in circuit diagrams and sketches of sleek housing components – when an itch starts on the right side of her chest. She absently scratches it, then goes back to drawing the delicate whorl of microcircuits intended to revolutionize the personal computing market.
“Nah,” he says, not sure if he actually does or not, but it’s a simple question and he’s determined to answer it himself. “I’m good with juice.”
The scuff of a foot on the floor has him spinning, snarling, attacking the newcomer, a blurry figure crouching over Stark. The crack of something hard and strong into his mouth sends him reeling back, skidding onto his backside, spitting blood from suddenly-split lips.
It’s always more difficult to engage in tactics in wide-open sky. Toni far prefers landscapes she can hide and maneuver around, use rocks and buildings, trees and water features, blind spots and straightaways to her advantage. Unfortunately, the city of Los Angeles (and New York, for that matter) frown on unnecessary dogfighting in the heart of downtown, so she makes do with what she has.
After a long moment of strained silence, broken only by the shuffle of Clint and Kate and Carol picking themselves up and moving to stand near Lehnsherr behind Tony, Peter Quill exhales shakily, manages to get himself back on his feet and squares his shoulders.
Steve rolls over, with a lazy smile, and reaches up her. She slaps her gauntlet against his glove, and the static locks adhere to each other. “I knew you’d catch me,” he says, and she pulls him flush against her, locking her arms around his waist, kicking her feet down and burning her jets for everything she has.
With the same kind of single-minded, sleeve-uprolling determination that got him from the rejection pile to supersoldier and decorated war hero, he marches back to his room immediately after leaving Toni nestled into her couch with every intention to sit down and work this problem until it’s done. The problem with that notion is, he still doesn’t know what the hell he needs to do.
“Eyes open,” he says into the comm, turning left and right and readying himself to move in any direction the second she reappears or one of his own turns on them. “Kobik’s here and in a snit. Watch your backs.”
"There's something else you can do for me," she says. "I'm... Carter might have been right, but I’ll cut you if you ever tell her that. I’m not stable right now. Can’t… I can’t trust myself. I need you to call it for me. I need an anchor. JARVIS will give you temporary overrides.”
Rhodey shrugs, a little helplessly. “I dunno,” he says. “I just thought it might by why you’re so goddamn weird about talking to me about this kinda stuff, stuff that obviously bothers you. Like, maybe you thought it was me, and you didn’t want to tell me or something.”
“Good morning, JARVIS,” she sings, throwing a fist of victory in the air. It might be a bit premature, but she can’t help it. Even if this is all JARVIS will ever be, she is
Steve tenses for just a second, but it’s there and gone in a flash. Toni smiles to herself; they’re both getting better at coping and adjusting. “You redesigned the whole thing,” he says, resuming his efforts to make her melt into a puddle inside the armor. “It’s different, the contours, the material. I can tell. Plus,” and she can hear the wry grin in his tone, “it helps that it’s painted with my mark.”
“Ah yes.” Her mouth twists. “How silly of me to forget.” She swivels the chair back, pulls her goggles back down and reignites the torch. “Let him in, I guess.”
It’s just her luck; all three of them are in the kitchen when she steps off the elevator. She falters for a moment as three sets of eyes turn to watch her, debates turning and fleeing, debates running down to get the care packages she put together for each one of them and bribe them into forgiveness. Only for a moment, though, because none of that is going to fix the damage she caused. So she squares her shoulders, hitches up her big girl pants, and walks forward into the zone of judgement.
The throbbing surges up to a tortuous rhythm, and he just barely manages to not double over in pain. Between the discordant thoughts battering at his mind and the strident voices battering at his ears, he can’t make out a single fucking thing anyone is saying.
James is on the floor, beat to shit and with torn-up clothes, trussed like a Christmas turkey, painted red-brown with dried blood, and laughing like a loon. There are ropes around his neck, tied to long poles held by two black-clad agents.
He pulls Lola into the empty spot marked with the SHIELD logo in the company parking lot. He exits and cranes his neck to stare up, up, up at the towering heights of the SI building.  Toni Stark is not likely to be anything but sour and surly this hour of the day. Phil debates whether or not to start revising the entire day’s plans, and makes a mental note to send Maria a memo strongly suggesting she take the recommended organizational courses at the Triskelion before she touches his schedule again.
“Cap is here!” she says urgently, and he follows her vigorous pointing with his eyes, locks onto the bright, gleaming vibranium shield.
Out of nowhere, a warm hand brushes her hair back, gathering it loosely at the nape of her neck. Another hand, warm, but unresisting, settles awkwardly between her shoulder blades. She glances up, and the Winter Soldier is kneeling beside her, looking vaguely shocked at himself. “What are you doing?” she asks scratchily.
Electricity sparks on either side, and his breathing picks up, harsh and fast, his body remembering the agony that comes from the device, even if his mind never retains it. Muted by the hiss of static and snap of lightning, the operators discuss the technical details, leaving him to sit in horrific anticipation of the moment fingers made of fire and torment reach into his head to dig out his memories.
Carol rises to her feet and clears her throat. “I've seen the footage,” she says, all firm and no-nonsense. “Stark’s telling the truth. Somehow or another, Kobik got it into her head that Hydra is what makes the world perfect, and God only knows how many people she's compromised in her pursuit of that reality.”
One hand rises, and she claws at her chest, above the horrible void where calming blue light should glow, and a nano veil comes off her skin, revealing the two stars, one on either side of the reactor dock’s empty ring. “I’m sorry,” she mumbles, so faintly Bucky’s not quite sure she talked at all, and her arm falls limply to her side again. “I’m so sorry. I’m sorry. Sorry. Sorr…”
“Nah.” She scratches her nose and slams down the faceplate again with a sigh. “Alright, which batch of idiots should we take out next, J? Floor number twenty six, or lucky number floor twenty seven?”
It’s listening to Carol try to justify it, try to tell him that Rhodey would consider it a worthy sacrifice, because they stopped the bad guy.
“Make a note of it, and run the data against the coding of the other suits,” she says. “I want to know if it’s a one-off, or if it’s something I’m going to have to worry about when I’m somewhere even more hostile than Swamp-Ass, Siberia. Like the bottom of the ocean. See if you can track down the cause of the error so I can eradicate it.”
Toni lets him interlock their fingers, and her palm is cool against his. “I am kinda hungry,” she says with a wry smile. “Breakfast was hours ago. Thanks, by the way. It was delicious.”
He’s not laughing in that worrisome way anymore, but still looks amused. “Hi Toni,” he says, as if he’s not covered head to toe in blood, listing on his feet, and a little hazy-eyed.
Abruptly, she turns and slams her hands onto the top of her work bench, the half-finished arm  rattling. Her shoulders hunch, heave with deep, shaky, angry breaths. Bucky stares at her back, mute and wretched. Shame and self-loathing make a sick swirl in his gut, and he wants nothing more than to find a dark hole to crawl in and die.
“Helen’s perfectly understanding about the demands on my time, because she has her own,” Pepper says evenly, and crosses her arms again. “And then there’s the added bonus of not having her beat the living hell out of me the first time we met.”
“Maybe,” Steve eventually concedes, and straightens up to turn and lean back against the rail, hands wrapped loosely around the top bar on either side of him. Tony’s breath catches just a little, because Steve’s eyes are shockingly blue, and the golden-orange-scarlet hues of the sun backlight him until his hair and shoulders are almost glowing. Steve smiles ruefully, with just a hint of embarrassed grimace. “Probably. Is that going to be a problem?”
She shrugs, doesn’t lose her smile. “You’re a grown-ass man, James,” she says easily. “You want to sit beside me, I’m seriously all for that, but nobody owns you anymore, so you sit wherever you want.” Her hand drifts along his back as she moves around him. “I’m going to go put on another pot of coffee. Do you want some?”
A Twitter feed blinks open, scrolling furiously with mentions and direct messages, retweeted photos of her in mid-roll, all streamlined and lethal and shiny. She snarls at JARVIS to kill the feed, kill all distractions, kill all noise, all sound. Feels her vision shift red and silver, narrow down. Heartbeat thudding in her chest, arc reactor bright and flaring. Pain and rage and fear and hate pound through the tight ball under her right collarbone, and she bares her teeth in response, anticipating death and destruction
For someone who got her family’s company out of weapons design as soon as she took it over, Toni’s got an awful lot of guns. Pistols and rifles of every stripe, every size, right from six-shooters all the way up to futuristic-looking weapons made of plastic and branded with the Stark Industries logo. And not just guns, either. Combat knives and throwing knives and darts. A miniature tower of ammo tins.
She has fractions of a second to judge the grip he has on her ankle, but her brain has always worked at light speed. She takes the risk, keeps turning into the spin. She gets her leg over his shoulder, her knee around the back of his neck just as he releases her trapped foot. Whips her now-free leg around, locks her ankles together under his chin, and throws her weight down over her shoulders, arms outstretched to break the fall.
likely. Sad facts that are only further reinforced when Carol sighs, sinks heavily into a chair and puts her face in both hands. “You’re right,” she says tiredly. “Elaborate ruses like this really aren’t your style.”
His face goes dark, changes, shifts. Darkness and unholy triumph flow across it. “It’s you,” he breathes. “Finally.”
She and Tony brawl it out instead, because he's not letting her touch Miles at all. Carol punches Tony into a coma, and Hank McCoy later states, at the Helicarrier Iliad, where Steve had him moved to life support machines, that if not for Tony's self-experimentation to keep himself alive at various points, Carol would have killed him.
After nearly eighteen hours of dreamless sleep, broken only twice to inhale a prodigious amount of breakfast food thoughtfully brought to her by Bucky -- who she is now one hundred and ten percent positive she doesn’t deserve in the slightest -- Toni is more or less herself again.
For some reason, Toni’s got an eyebrow up and a grin playing around the corners of her mouth. “Yeah,” she says, pushes herself off the window with her shoulder and moves to her chair to sit. “That’s one way to put it. You didn’t answer my question though. What do you want?”
“Of course, Director,” JARVIS says pleasantly. “They report they are happy to join you, and will arrive presently.” There’s a tiny hesitation before he says, “Shall I recall the quinjet, Director? Notify ma’am and the Captain to return?”
Toni glances his way, smiles warmly and reaches up to free one ear from the tiny earbud she tucked into it. “What’s up, James?” she says, and the niggling, wiggling thing in his thoughts abruptly grows and slaps him in the face when he realizes she’s neither sweating nor winded, and they’ve been running awhile.
, and a mix of surprise and worry washes from him. Then, his face stills, slides to neutrality, slides to something dark and watchful, and he nods once. “Understood. The rest?”
The door opens. Natasha is awake and alert, despite the hastily tied robe suggesting she'd been in bed thirty seconds ago. Clint shuffles behind her in sleep pants, hair stuck every which way, but just as alert, his eyes sliding between Bucky and Toni and back to Bucky again. No one says anything for a long moment, except for Natasha's raised eyebrow.
Carol, it should be noted, is given pretty much a blank check by the President to keep her Ultimates going in the aftermath of these events.
His skin smouldered and cracked, blackened as the fury of the star screamed around him, and she cried out in shock as it swept him away to roll, charred and dying, to a heap. She turned, as fear swelled, and she was surrounded by corpses, floating free in the weightlessness of space. She screamed again as she spun to flee, and came face to face with the golden eyes of Heimdall, bloody and dead and impaled.
His head is pounding, and his vision is going blurry again. “But…” He sounds lost and weak and confused, grits his teeth, forces himself to focus. “I remember it all. I am Captain America.”
The mech doesn’t kill him on power-up, and despite a few hair-raising moments of alarms and warnings flashing, it proves space worthy too, which is always a worry of his. After all the shit he’s been through, Tony Stark is not going to get taken out of the boss battle by something as pedestrian as vacuum exposure before the fight even starts. So it’s nice when his tech behaves and the seals hold as they should.
She triggers the helmet to fold back, and lies there breathing for a second, trying to get her heart rate back into a semblance of normal, staring at the ceiling overhead. That breaks through the haze of amusement, panic and excitement hammering through the soulmarks. Wait. Ceiling?
“No, ma’am,” JARVIS replies, and data scrolls across the edge of the HUD. Toni watches it for half a second; topographical data and government records on utilities in the area, JARVIS’s crunching the best angle of attack to shut down any hope those inside the base have of reaching outside assistance. Toni approves. “I am inside their systems. Deploying cyberwarfare suite and EMI packages. ...Communications capabilities are nullified, ma’am. They are unaware of my presence in their system.”
He doesn’t know where to look. Staring off into space just makes him want to slip into the Winter Soldier, let fresh rime crystallize his thoughts, and that’s a bad idea with Clint at the other end of the room, because if he goes sociopath, Clint
“Stark Tower is significantly larger than either the Manor or the Malibu mansion, ma’am,” JARVIS says, and Toni grins a little. He sounds offended. “Your estimated time frame did not take into account the complexity of the security systems, nor did it consider the number of individual work stations and access nodes that required additional installation of protocols to be compatible with my program.”
Clint side-eyes him again, and just laughs, humor tinged with bitterness. “Jesus fucking Christ, Barnes. Stop trying to understand what you clearly can’t wrap your head around. I don't need her mark on me to know with perfect fucking certainty that when the world is burning down, we'll be standing back-to-back fighting to the end. Just...” He sighs, and both the humor and the anger dissipate. “Just let it the fuck go already. I’m not a threat unless you make me one. You keep gnawing at it like this, and the only one you’re going to hurt is Toni.”
“Hi James.” Her vision is turning grey and fuzzy around the edges. It hurts to breathe. “I really am thrilled to finally meet you properly. But if it’s all the same to you, I think I’m going to pass out now.”
, he knows what he’s doing with his mouth. Toni’s used to people trying to speed through the kissing in order to get her clothes off, but Clint doesn’t seem like he’s in any rush whatsoever. It feels like natural progression to open her mouth, lick at his lip, invite his tongue. His hands don’t go anywhere, except to cup her jaw and rub his thumb along her cheekbone.
“My name is Steve Rogers. My birthday is July 4, 1987. I am a captain in the US Army. I am Captain America. I am the successor to Chester Phillips, the first Captain America. My mother was Sarah Rogers. She died of breast cancer four years ago. My soulmate is Peggy Carter Rogers, and we have been married for three years. I did not serve in World War II. I did not crash into an iceberg. I did not punch Hitler in the face. I was injured in a fight with the villain Iron Man, and suffered amnesia.”
“Shoot them in the face,” she says, turning her attention back to her paperwork. “I may not want to mass-produce weapons for the world at large, Obadiah, but I still own a
Bucky turns her around, sears her mouth with one final kiss, tips her head up with two fingers gently beneath her chin. “You don’t need an army,” he says softly, and his eyes are full of love and violence. “You got me. I’ll kill him for you.”
Steve’s never liked being sick, has to hate it now, since Erskine’s experiment was supposed to cure him of ever getting sick again. He should go in, sit with him while he’s awake and more-or-less lucid.
“We’re here,” comes a voice she’s only ever heard on the old news reels, and a cool hand touches her forehead as another one takes her hand. “We’re not going to let you disappear, Toni.”
It’s more difficult to pull himself away from the market than he anticipated. His fingers long for a sketch book and a quiet corner, long to capture on paper the family of five buying fruit, the couple arguing over lettuce, the dreamy-eyed reader with her hand propped on her chin and her eyes focused on her book, the clearly-bonded triad who can’t stop touching each other’s hands and arms and shoulders having lunch three tables down. It’s been a long,
Tony rolls over, flying with his back to the wind for a moment, and smirks at the Hawkeyes’ quinjet. Kate tips him a merry wave through the windshield, and he returns the salute. “I’m not going to try and micromanage,” Tony says, and hears someone, Quill maybe, snort across the comm channel in disbelief. “Shut it, Star-Lord,” he says. “I have no details as to what we’re walking into here. Flying into. Whatever. The entire Helicarrier crew and SHIELD staff might have been co-opted by Kobik. It might be just Cap on board who’s a secret Nazi.”
So sorry for the length of time it took to get this chapter out. Life got very busy out of the blue.
when he needs some goddamn quiet. Experience with Extremis and electronic white noise only goes so far in his self-taught psychic shielding, after all, and so many thoughts screaming at him in the awkward physical silence is giving him a migraine the size of Reed Richards' ego.
“Fitz,” Jemma says gently, framing his face in her palms and looking him in the eye with a soft, fond expression, “if you take away the uniforms, what’s the difference between us and the Avengers?”
He can’t remember the last time he woke slow and lazy, buried in pillows and puffy blankets, warm and comfortable and with the scent of a woman in his nose. He opens his eyes, blinking blearily, hand reaching out to curl around the curve of a warm, smooth thigh. Shapely, strong muscles under the skin, a distinctly feminine noise of pleasure accompanying the stroke of his fingers as he moves his hand down to the knee.
Steve slides the shield off his arm, inspecting the new straps carefully. They’re comfortable and nearly frictionless, but still offer a good grip for when he needs to fight with it. “You can’t just ask?” he asks absently, running his finger along one of the blue lines. Huh. Feels like leather, even though it clearly isn’t.
Christ, she’s going to end up killing him. He’s too raw, it’s been too long, and the damned bond between them is singing with a whole bunch of emotions he thought he’d long since lost. He forces himself to step back, take a deep breath, turn around, keep his goddamn hands to himself. There’s nothing gentle in him right now, no romance, nothing she deserves.
“It was bad enough enough when it was just Clint,” Pepper continues, as if Toni hadn't just spoken. “But at least I knew he had your back. Even Natasha, once she lost the distrust, that was fine too. But ever since Fury gave you those files of your father's two years ago, and you found your red star…” She lifts her hands in a defeated, helpless gesture. “It's been one mission after another. And yes, you found him, and I'm happy for you. I really am. But your heart stopped, Toni. And now this, with Steve? How much more are you going to take? How many more times are you going to halfway kill yourself before it's enough for you?”
until she can purge them from her thoughts. And that means she needs her retreat, her tree branches with its shield of leaves and twigs, with its cache of paper and colored pencils, and a few hours of quiet to spill them onto clean white pages.
The guard starts, and the rifle in his hand whips up. His head tilts towards the right, where he has a radio attached to the shoulder of his uniform, and his mouth is forming the first syllable of a warning.
But he has to do it, because he has Toni’s back, fuck his life. He’s her soulmate, all official and shit even, and he has to do it because she can’t. Toni is still out cold, drugged to the gills with heavy painkillers and serious sedatives, until Helen Cho can get her head out of her ass and fly out from California to fix Toni.
“I can do that too,” Steve says, and brushes his thumb across Tony’s cheek, just under his eye. “None of it matters. Not now, not anymore. I’m tired of what ifs and regrets. Aren’t you?”
“I’m sorry, Buck,” he mutters, jaw clenching with the effort to control his temper. No one at here is at fault, no one here deserves to be beaten to a pulp. He’s saving all that for Hydra. “I just can’t do this right now.”
” she sings along with the music playing on the internal speakers. The pulse above her right breast beats in time to the rhythm. She’s no Bruce Dickinson, but she’s got heart and gusto and absolutely no sense of shame. “
“Oh fuck, yes,” Bucky says as neutrally as he can, isn’t as successful as he wants to be. He zips his hoodie back up.
JARVIS’s reply is dry and amused. “A stunning achievement, madam. But if I may say, you are still short by five if you wish to match the Brave Little Tailor.”
“You assumed correctly,” Toni replies, still trying to process exactly how damaged her hand had to be to warrant that many nanites swarming around to repair things. “Six colonies. Fuck.” She shifts her head a little, scanning for any of the screen feeds she knows Helen’s got running, but the angle is completely wrong. “How’s it going?”
with shaking, slick-red fingers. The lock clicks open, she yanks at the handle, and throws herself through the door just as he reaches her.
“Please shut up,” Steve says again, and he realizes he’s begging, but anxiety’s churning up his stomach now, and in this moment, he doesn’t care. “Just leave it alone, Clint.”
The nurse hasn’t said anything since she told him his compliance is appreciated, and he started following her through the hall. She leads him to a door, tells him to open it, Doctor Fennhoff is waiting inside for him.
Her lips curve into a smile. “Good,” she says. “Tell them they have a mission: two enemy combatants in the training room. Proceed with caution, both are considered dangerous opponents. Take them alive, with minimal collateral damage. They are green in thirty seconds. Shift the hard-light scenario in fifteen.”
He adheres the ones he likes best to his wall, pulling blue sticky tack out of a package and carefully flattening it to hold the sketches up. His mother, Peggy. Bucky. Jim Morita, Dum Dum Duggan. Izzy Cohen. All the Howling Commandos. Erskine. Places, people, things. The way everything used to be, the only way it’s ever made sense to him.
He knows where she’s going, and sighs. “Not a thing,” he responds, and wraps his hands loosely around her wrists. “I know. Fine. You’re right, of course. It will be good for us to know.”
The arc reactor in her chest whines, spins up, flares bright. She bangs the emergency catch in her helmet with her chin, and the faceplate slides back, the sharp edge from the damaged rim scraping up into her hair, probably peeling layers of skin with it if the hoarse scream that wrenches loose from her throat is any indication.
This time, it isn’t the creation of frenzied days of nonstop coding, but the slow, careful labour of six months’ worth of filing paperwork, obtaining appropriate permits, interviewing potential employees and retrofitting an old lab complex in Culver City to bring it up to all applicable standards and codes. The dance to satisfy regulations is a pain in the ass, because the regulatory bodies that oversee biotech and biomedical companies all seem to have different ideas of what comprises safety, but with the help of JARVIS, it’s accomplished freakishly quickly. One by one, the EPA, the FDA, the USDA and the State of California send their inspectors to her facility and sign off. And then Star Solutions Inc. is open for business to produce biomedical and cutting-edge neuroengineering technology to the world.
He stares at the file folder, tapping his thumb against it now. The embossed Avengers symbol gleams at him under the overhead light, and he sighs faintly. However his path started, little Philip Coulson from Manitoc, Wisconson is now in charge of a team of the most powerful people in the world, and these are the decisions he is now responsible for making.
Fitz does so, then gives a thumbprint and voice recognition statement when prompted for those as well. The email opens to a few lines of text, and an attachment.
Clearly, the same thought never occurred to Kobik, who shoves the fridge off her with a wail of dismay.
While Jemma’s busy with her tablet, Fitz turns to butter his bagel. As he takes his first bite, Jemma says, puzzled, “JARVIS, what’s this block about? The one starting at three?”
From the other side, Steve’s hand slides over his, slots into the grooves between his knuckles, squeezes warm and fond, and red and gold and white and blue gleams through a breeze laced with ozone, coffee and the clean scent of sunlight on skin. “You’re not alone, Buck,” he says with the sort of effortless confidence that convinces men they can carry the moon if only Steve asks them to. “You’re never alone. We’re here, both of us.”
Her arms are trembling by the time she sets the hammer down, and her knees are threatening to give out. Sweat pours off her body, drenching her tank top and jeans, and her chest burns with the ache of pulled muscles.
“Yeah,” Clint says pensively, then catches Tony’s eye and gives him a very significant look. “You know you gotta take this to her now.”
“I do, goddammit. He’s the kinda guy I want to sit on the couch with and drink beer while you and Toni break some fucking heads with your thighs of death. She’s
He freezes mid-air as his name crackles through the comms. Kate's voice. He scans quickly until he spots her on the deck, waving up at him.
Pepper shoves another bottle of the world’s worst energy drinks into her hands after cracking the top. Toni makes a face, but doesn’t argue, because she’s still got a hollow, gnawing feeling in her stomach that she’d really like to not get worse. She drains it as quickly as she can, trying not to notice the taste and failing completely.
“I try not to dignify rich old farts with my attention, Trish, but you asked nicely, so just for you, yeah?” She makes a show of clearing her throat, until Pepper is hissing at her to get on with it. “I just have to say that it’s okay if you’re jealous that a hot, young, multiple-doctorate female CEO with, if I can be conceited here for
A hand grabs her shoulder. Adrenaline jumps. She hisses and slashes with the knife still in her hand, cuts in. The hand jerks away as the sharp tang of blood fills the air. Red Star is watching her, expressionless, his hand dripping blood onto the floor.
“Soulmate,” Toni mutters into her cup, swallows scalding caffeine so she doesn’t do something pointless like drive Morgan’s teeth down his throat. He has an excellent dentist, after all.
They’re doing this. Really, really doing this. And despite having been the driving force behind it all happening, Tony’s still finding it hard to believe that once again, superheroes and various powers are gathering to go to war against their own.
Toni grumbles, and Bucky’s smile grows painfully wide, eyes burn with a sudden prick of tears, and he laughs outright when Toni squawks indignantly.
But first, he has to beard the dragon in her den. With that cheerful thought, he adjusts his tie and steps into the gleaming, broad lobby of Stark Tower a moment after the uniformed doorman pulls the glass and chrome door open for him.
herself to go faster. The distance between them closes rapidly, and she stretches out a hand, brain crunching the shifting physics of how close this is really going to be. The ground’s getting awfully close. She’s not going to get him in time to get back into the sky. The best she can hope to do is snag him, slow their fall as much as she can, and then take the brunt of the rest herself. The armor should hold. She hopes.
The blanket is yanked away. Toni whines and scrabbles for it, but Natasha has her determined face on, and she keeps it from Toni’s fingers. “The first time you go to bed with your soulmate, Antonia,” she says, “you will not smell like you fell into a sewer. And there will be
“Good.” Natasha pulls her head down, kisses her forehead, presses her nose into Toni’s hair. “Я рада, что ты жива,” she breathes, then lets Toni's jaw go with an apologetic brush of her fingers. “Though Clint may still murder you. He's undecided.”
He catches her chin gently and turns her head towards him. Kisses her soft and sweet and tender. “So here’s the thing,” he says, and rests his forehead against hers. “I don’t own you, and I was an asshole to act like I do. So go on. Go where you feel safe, huh?”
“...if the terms of the budget and estimated dates by which we need the projects completed are acceptable,” Carter is saying, and hands over a sheaf of papers, “sign and initial where the tabs indicate.”
It’s a minor thing in the grand scheme, an insignificant detail that nevertheless does nothing but further convince Steve that Schmidt is completely unfit to lead a horse to a trough, let alone an organization of HYDRA’s scope into the bright and bold future.
I am never watching Star Wars with you again.” She closes her eyes, shakes her limbs loose, bounces back and forth between her feet. “Should it really be this hard?”
Tony blinks, blinks again, and then shakes his head sharply. “Clearly,” he says, combing through his neural pathways for his brain’s reboot button, “I wasn’t completely thorough when I burned the crazy out of your skull,” and Steve looms over him, smiling in that gorgeous
The color is wrong. Still blue, still beautiful, but instead of calming him like it normally does, the hue makes him tense. It nags at him, plucking at something in his somewhat hazy recollections of his return to consciousness.
“Mark III engaging a hostile on Level D,” Iron Man says, and there’s a strange whine and a glow from the palms. And then Steve is flying backwards, bent double from the impact of light that crashed into his stomach. He twists and lands on his feet, a spread hand keeping him balanced. Another whine builds, and he covers himself with the shield, hearing the ray ring and slide off the vibranium.
The aches of his various bumps and bruises are instantly forgotten. Right. This is why he’s here. How silly of him to forget.
“Yeah, I have something,” Peter Quill says, raising his hand from his spot by the window. He side-eyes Tony and raises a palm in skeptic question. “Are we actually buying this? Cap as a Hydra agent? Come on, I could think up a better ridiculous story after a night drinking with Thor. In Asgard.”
He leaps towards her, and she blasts upwards by pure rabbit instinct. “Jesus fucking Christ, Steve,” she says, her mouth still running, still on autopilot, because it’s either a steady stream of verbal diarrhea, or endless screaming. “We need to work on your concept of understanding what the fuck I’m saying. Lay off the 'roids, dude. They're obviously damaging your brain. I don’t care what they tell you or how pretty they smile. Hydra doctors are not your friends.”
His head swims. His vision doubles, blurs together, doubles again. He reaches out to swipe at the buttons, but they’re too far away and his fingers miss. His left knee gives out, then his right. He falls heavily to the floor, drowning in the air and fading out of consciousness again.
For once in her life, Toni decides to be fashionably early, arriving in the conference room with a fresh cup of coffee and her StarkPad at 9:20am, forty full minutes before Coulson’s meeting is supposed to begin. She wants to get some more work done, but can’t go to the workshop (because then she’ll never make the meeting at all) and the resident assassins are still digging into their toyboxes in the communal area, paying little attention to anything that wasn’t a method of messy death. She thinks it’s kinda cute how giddy they get over the Starktech she designs for them, but she simply can’t work with Clint squeeing every two seconds. There’s a reason he’s banned from her workshop when it's crunch time and she needs to focus.
As he steps back and nods, as Fennhoff enters a final command into the keyboard, half a second before his world washes white and clean with pain and fire, Steve screams in wordless, futile rage deep in the dark of his mind.
Now, she thinks, absently calling for JARVIS to give her a progress check on his hack, now she can sit and wait for actionable intelligence. She's done all she can to prepare.
When Toni wakes, she’s alone in the bed. She hazily blinks conscious, letting information coalesce from the sunlight streaming through the window, the soft warmth of her mattress, and the faint scent of Steve on the pillow under her head inform her of where she is. Normally, she wakes grumpy, snappish and growling at everyone and everything that gets between her and her morning cup of coffee… but this morning, she just stretches languorously, rolling like a cat under the covers, before sliding off the mattress and stretching again, toes to fingertips.
It is a smart call, probably the smartest call she’s made. But it still hurts something inside her, deep and sharp, to stand at the window ten minutes later, watch Rhodey and Carol shoot off in their armors, watch the quinjet carrying everyone else follow after.
“Winter is coming, and there must always be a Stark in Manhattan,” she says with a humorless little chuckle, and pushes the double doors open.
Tony jerks back into his own head with a sharp gasp, and freezes like a deer in headlights with every cell of his being yowling at him to
Frigga stopped, and Odin stopped with her. She turned to him and took his hands in hers, pressed her lips to his knuckles and smiled a trembling smile up at him. “No, my love.” Softly. So softly. “She saw the stones united.”
The man, Fitz, stops dead and goes pale. Toni’s seen enough cases of hero worship -- has suffered through one or two herself, has gone complete starry-eyed fangirl over Dr. Banner’s work in particle physics a few times -- to recognize it now. “Dr. Stark!
“Thou art only half human, Quill,” Thor murmurs, but her smile is broad and her eyes are sparkling. “Methinks thy otherworldly heritage wouldst grant thee some advantage in retaining what scant wits thou art gifted.”
“Huh,” is all Clint says, but he sits rather suddenly and heavily in the chair across from Tony, and holds out his hand, palm up, as he stares off into space. “Guess that would explain it. Shit, that would explain a
I am set to live in the most decadent lap of luxury I feel like for about a thousand years. So there’s the door, off you fuck, and enjoy trying to debug Hammertech operating systems every time you want to check the goddamn weather.”
“... Peggy?” Yes, he's certain that's her name, and her face lights up with relief. Things are coming back to him, sluggish and dim. “Peggy Carter. You're with Strategic Scientific Reserve. You oversaw the training for Project Rebirth. I remember--” He trails off, watching her face crumple again.
“He told me you loved me,” Tony says before he can think better of it, and Steve starts badly beside him. “Pod Person Rogers tried to twist the knife as deeply as he could get it, even though I couldn’t hear a damned thing he was saying. How you always held back because you loved me, even when we were trying to kill each other. How that made you weak, because you couldn’t do what needed to be done.”
There’s a little voice in the back of his head, though, reminding him that not only did he sign up for an experimental medical procedure, he also jumped out of planes often without a parachute, stole German tanks to run blockades, palled around with some of the craziest no-fear soldiers the US Army had to offer, and charged gungho into Axis-held territory without a second thought, so maybe he doesn’t have much room to talk.
rack, is richer than you. But it hurts, Donnie, it really hurts that you didn’t contract Stark Solutions to help with your unfortunate follicle condition. We have hair replacement treatments that are so thorough, no one will ever know the difference. Lesson learned, folks: never settle for second best.”
Bucky grins a little. He's of the same mind, now that he doesn't feel like he's walking through the world on a hair trigger at all times.  But Clint just rolls his eyes and jerks a thumb backwards over his shoulder. “I've also been told that Nat's a dangerous influence to anyone suffering delicacy of their mental state,” he adds. “And this is why. She enables me.”
He grins, goofily, and puts his second cup of coffee down to reply. It hits him then. That in something he is for Steve is in love.
Clint shrugs, and there’s no sympathy, empathy or pity anywhere in his eyes. “Buy her a really big gift, say you’re sorry, and suck it up, princess. We’re not getting anywhere with this if we don’t get her on board.”
Steve’s never really been comfortable with people, complete strangers, having their hands all over him, and a couple of the ladies working in the Fabrication department had been handsy, touching his arm and shoulders often enough that he’d started to think they were finding excuses. They hadn’t been anything but friendly and polite, but after almost an hour with them, he’d felt hounded and cornered.
“As would I, ma’am.” Anyone else would read the AI’s tones as his usual bland, slightly-pleasant manner of speaking, but Toni knows him almost better than she knows herself. Knows he is just as thoroughly upset at she is. “The Mark VII’s fabrication process will finish at approximately the same time as the diagnostic.”
Figures shimmer in the corner, gleaming from the backsplash of computer monitors and low-banked lanterns that are all her captors have given her for light, and she stretches out a hand to them, manages to get it halfway up before her strength is gone and it drops back to her side. “I wish you were here,” she rasps, coughs and chokes on the metallic tang of blood in the back of her throat. “I’ve lived a good life, for all that I’m not even thirty. I have good partners.”
“No,” she whimpered, and buried her face in her arms, running blindly now. “No, leave me alone! I don’t want to see this! I don’t want to see this!”
Toni laughs and lazily rolls into a climb, hitting the cloud ceiling at a dizzying speed. “Not letting me break up with my soulmates, huh?”
Eventually, the lawyer shows up with a briefcase and a legal aide carrying a filing box. Toni flings herself carelessly in a seat, already more than halfway caught up in making mental amendments for the new Star Solutions facilities opening next year in Oregon. She’s passed an envelope, and she absently tears it open with her thumb as she runs the cost projection for a new, state-of-the-art nanotech lab versus expanding her current Culver City location. She’s trying to decide if centralizing her most cutting-edge of research departments is the better option, or diversifying for better talent and data preservation, when Morgan shrieks.
Rhodes steps back, and Steve gets a good look at her for the first time since he tried to kill her. She’s pale, too pale, and the shadows under her eyes are as dark as fresh bruises. She’s smiling and happy, but Steve’s pretty sure it’s all for show. He’s never been much of an actor -- the dancing monkey routine for the war bonds tours proved that to just about everyone -- but he doesn’t have to be a great performer to recognize a complete fiction when he sees it. Just like he doesn't need the feeling of being overwhelmed and anxious fluttering through his chest like a dying hummingbird to know that Toni wants to be here as little as he does. Doesn’t need to put a hand on Bucky’s thigh to know that his soulmate is thrumming with tension because he feels it too.
He's kind of hoping they don't, because sooner or later, someone's going to start questioning his trustworthiness and are they
Even if it means Toni never speaks to him or trusts him again, he's going to take care of this shit once and for all. Because in the end, it's always been up to him to have her back, even when she thinks she doesn't need protection.
Across the room, Toni’s head lifts away from her conversation with the curly-haired kid and turn towards them. Maybe she’s drawn by the sudden surge in apprehension from them both, maybe she’s just looking around for Bucky or him. But it doesn’t really matter in the end why she looks at them, only that she does.
Learns, unsurprisingly, that he’s pretty much well head-over-fucking-heels in love with her. Thinks she loves him too. Hopes she does.
“‘Kay…” she breathes, and he loses contact with her as, with superhuman effort he wasn’t aware but is unsurprised to discover she possesses, heaves herself to her feet and staggers the remaining distance to her work table. “Pain in the ass hallucinations,” he hears her mumble over the click of an arc reactor sliding into place, and the workshop dims into faded blue static.
Toni has never been stupid. Her brain makes the leap effortlessly, and she knows that her father has stolen from her, has claimed her design as his own, rides the accolades and reaps the praise as if he earned it all himself. Toni learns her first lesson in ruthlessness that day, and learns for the first time what betrayal tastes like. At the tender age of four, she knows what it feels like to know that trust is foolhardy.
Even a thousand miles away, Natasha can feel Clint’s anger. Their bond has always been stronger for her than it has been for him, stronger and steadier than studies say bonds usually are. It was disquieting at first, in the early days, to feel someone else’s unchecked emotions, their raw pain and effervescent joy, sitting beneath her skin like a ball of electricity, but she’s come to appreciate it over their time together. Her life has been spent sussing out the deepest truths of her targets, keeping her own reactions under tight control. It’s comforting to know that there is one person she never has to
All three of them are digging through the trunks, pulling out armor and weapons and more weapons, when she makes her way back to sit and caffeinate. “Vultures,” she mumbles into her mug, and takes a noisy slurp.
he thinks as his back hits the wall next to the door leading into the building, Steve’s weight keeping him supported while his hands roam under Tony’s shirt.
Toni’s sitting cross-legged on the floor, surrounded by physical blueprints and holographic sketches, intently watching one screen that shows security footage of black-clad raiders, her hands buried in the blue-glowing guts of a 3D model of what looks like a turret.
glaring at her with folded arms and a stubborn set to his jaw, standing in the middle of her workshop and blocking all of her attempts to go around him to get back to her projects.
The pencil breaks against the door as it closes behind Clint, and Steve stares glumly at the broken pieces, scratching off another one on the tally in his head, listening to Clint’s mocking laugh fade away down the hall.
Because the answer, where he’s concerned, is always going to be the sudden whining shriek of repulsors blasting the back doors off the vehicle, and a
The fact that a very tall, very intimidating blonde woman woke him and Jemma at five and dragged them out of the building to go on a morning run without so much as a by-your-leave is a definite negative. Fitz likes Carol, but not before he’s even had a cup of coffee. He huffs and puffs along and just wants to collapse back into bed when he’s done, but once he’s had some water and caught his breath, he’s oddly invigorated.
“Roger that.” He takes a deep breath, shakes out his hands and shoulders. “Okay,” he says, mostly to himself, but since he forgot to turn off the comms, also to everyone else. “Here we go.”
“Stark… Toni…” Carter chokes out. “This is… symptoms of… soulbond psychosis... You can’t…You’re not...”
“It’s something you’ve needed for a long time,” Obadiah says, spinning the ring on his pinkie with his thumb. “Howie might have been too much of a pussy to discipline you, Toni, but I’m not your father. I’m not going to tolerate your smart mouth or your disrespect. You’re a Stark, and you will start acting like a Stark.” The corner of his mouth curls down, the Stane mark of dismissive disdain. “Or you’ll find your monthly allowance cut off pretty damn quick. Howie might have indulged you, Toni, but I’m not paying for your whoring yourself across the world.”
Clint lashes out with a kick, precise and vicious, hits the top of Bucky’s chair with enough force to knock it sideways and off-balance, and Bucky goes flailing out of his seat, spilling onto the floor in a sprawling tangle of limbs and a surprised grunt. Steve gets halfway off the bed, alarmed, and Clint cocks his arm back. Bucky has a split second to think
Dr. Fennhoff runs some tests, MRIs and CT scans and other procedures he doesn’t recognize and finds the slightest bit fantastic, like something out of a Wells novel. Peggy is there with him, holding his hand, smiling encouragingly, trying not to cry. He lets her hold his hand, even though his skin is crawling, because something is just not
“Red star,” is all she says, because Clint is one of the three people living who know what marks she bears and what they mean.
“Very good, ma’am,” JARVIS replies promptly. “Agent Coulson has requested a meeting to begin in approximately one hour. And I believe I have reached the final layer of encryption on SHIELD’s servers. I have isolated a series of servers in various Stark clusters, and will begin collating and compiling pertinent data for your convenience.”
Steve?” she yelps, waving her arms at him. Anger and indignation catch up to the surprise, fed by the steady pulse of amusement under the white star on her chest. “I wasn’t ready! You could have hurt me.”
and he should have had days. Weeks. Decades. Decades would be best. He’s had no time to test it, no time to walk it through its paces. It’s been slapped together as carefully as he had the chance to do, and in all likelihood will kill him when he powers it up.
“That's not really my problem. You say you can work with Stark? Be my guest. I wish you much joy in it. She wants a new liaison, you just volunteered.” Fury opens a desk drawer, pulls out a stack of file folders tied together, and drops them on his desk. “She’s all yours. Just don't come crying to me in a week's time if you can't stop her from taking over the whole damn world with her AIs.”
“Bring him home, Bucky,” she says quietly, even though she’s not on the comm and he can’t hear her. “Or you’re sleeping on the fucking couch until doomsday.”
“You scheduled a reminder to begin fabrication of the Mark VIII armor today, as well as implementing Project Rebound. The fabrication facilities at the Culver City installation have sent notification that Captain Rogers’ tactical uniform is complete, and request a fitting in order to attend to potential alterations before it is finalized. As well, Captain Rogers asked me to notify you that he left at seven for his morning run, and he estimates his return to be somewhere around eleven am, as he wishes to do some sketching at a location he discovered yesterday morning. He added that your breakfast is in the warmer, and the coffee is fresh-made.”
feels sorry for FitzSimmons, because the looks that cross Carol and Rhodey’s faces can only be described as “unholy glee”.
“And you want sympathy for your eye.” Nat’s voice is flat and Bucky can almost picture her, standing there with one eyebrow raised and her arms folded. “I don’t see why you should have it, honestly.”
She recognizes the song when the brief spike of panic ebbs, and then it’s just murder in her heart. “Seek & Destroy” is Rhodey’s song.
touch, this easy affection, from Steve. He slumps against Steve, and if he was the sort to burst into tears, he would, just from the sudden, sure knowledge that he’s not carrying everything on his own anymore, because Steve’s back where he should be.
“Even my arrogance won’t let me call myself the Messiah,” Toni murmurs, and her fingers are at his waist, tugging upwards on the hem of his shirt. He bends to let her strip it off him, hears it land somewhere off in the corner of the workshop. Her hands spread across his chest, and a muffled noise rumbles in her throat, strained and abrupt. “Fuck, James. Look at you. Jesus fucking
She hasn’t forged anything by hand since Afghanistan, when she built the Mark I armor from discarded scrap and scavenged missile housing. She hadn’t even allotted space for a smithy in the building’s plans. But money talks, and Stark money talks the loudest and when she felt the itch to put hammer to steel, to work out her aggravations in the clang and ring of metal on metal, she had a forge in a couple of hours.
“Yeah, that’s a no.” Fury sighs and spreads his fingertips on the desktop, leans forward on them. “Stark’s a wild card, Phil. She doesn’t take orders and she doesn’t recognize authority. Since Iron Maiden debuted, she’s been involved with at least thirteen incidents that have directly impacted covert SHIELD operations. Involving her when the secrets are this big is just asking for trouble.”
“Anyone have any brain bleach?” Peter Parker asks after a long, awkward silence. “Cos that’s an image I need to burn out of my head as soon as possible.”
“Amazing,” the other man says, walking forward to peer more closely at him. “He hasn’t aged at all.”
“We’re right here, Stevie,” Bucky’s voice murmurs in his ear, and a phantom touch brushes along his shoulder.
Steve sighs, and takes the half dozen or so paces to the ragged hole blown in the wall, the edges of which are melted and seared. Distantly, he can see daylight on the other end of the tunnel. He shakes his head, thinking that only Tony could manage this much destruction just after a months-long coma. He turns his attention to the tablet, swiping through the pages of information already collated. “How many bulkheads does this go through?”
“Ma’am…” Jesus fucking Christ, she really needs to look into toning down JARVIS’s ability to sound disapproving, because no one should be able to load that much guilt into a single word. “Withdrawing is the smartest—”
Toni slams her hands on the desk again, on her feet without being really conscious of standing. “If I hear the words ‘time-sensitive’ come out of your fucking mouth one more time, Carter,
“Toni,” Steve starts carefully, hands settled on her shoulders. “Of course I don’t mind company, but I didn’t think running was something you wanted to do.”
“Jesus fucking Christ, you gave me a heart attack!” She thuds her forehead into his chest, feeling silent laughter shake through his ribs. Her mouth curves up despite her racing pulse. “It's not funny, goddammit. I need to put a fucking bell on you.”
“No,” he says tightly, hands fisting at his sides as he spins on his heel and starts pacing back the way he came, even though it’s not doing a damn thing but feeding the restlessness. “Yes. I don’t know.”
The almost inaudible scuff of a footstep against the floor outside the door caught her attention, and she looked up to see her husband standing in the doorway, quiet and concerned. She straightened and, with one last lingering look at her children, turned to leave them to sleep once again.
“Okay,” he says, but keeps looking back over his shoulder at her, standing in the workshop doorway, as he walks down the hall.
“Sure,” Carol says easily, and her eyes finally leave Toni’s as she glances to Rhodey. “Let’s go. I want to get a burger before you start hoarding them all.” She shoots a look back at Toni. “See you upstairs?”
futures). This culminates in Bruce Banner being killed by Clint Barton, as Bruce had made Clint promise to kill him if he ever started turning into the Hulk again, and the stress of about a hundred people showing up on his front step with accusations and threats of incarceration kinda started triggering the Hulk. At the very end, with Carol definitely having lost her shit and Ulysses' visions growing even more preposterous, extreme, and frequent, Carol tries to arrest Miles Morales, who she believes is about to murder Captain America based on Ulysses' visions.
He’ll cut through a thousand flying suits of armor if he has to. Iron Man’s going to pay for what he’s done.
She doesn’t have her usual driver, because Marvin called in sick with a family emergency, but the fill-in her usual temp agency sent over seems to be at least minimally competent. The car is clean, at least, and he doesn’t try to ogle her much, despite being bent forward to fiddle with her stiletto heels, revealing an ample spill of cleavage in her red dress.
“You won’t,” a woman says in a voice as rich and as clear as a bell, and a slender hand emerges from the shadows of the lab to slide into his metal hand, palm turning up beneath his to link their fingers together in a hold stronger and more unbreakable than the bonds keeping him chained to the machine at his back. “You’re the most stubborn asshole I know, James. No matter how hard they try, you’re never going to forget us.”
He’s not about to go off the rails or anything, but he’s definitely not handling this well. He hasn’t slept in what feels like years, because he’s not used to sleeping alone anymore. He’s too used to sleeping beside Toni, wrapping around her skin and warmth and vanilla-metal-coffee scent. Too used to drifting off with his nose in her hair, too used to waking up with her legs around his hips. In the grand scheme of things, it hasn’t technically been that long, but subjectively it’s a goddamn eternity he can’t wait to be over.
Hot, boiling anger tries to rise, but he squashes it down without hesitation. Pulls a little bit on the Winter Soldier as he rubs her back gently, discipline and ice to temper raw aggression and fury. He bottles it all away, and puts it on the mental shelf labeled
“You’re distracted because you’re an idiot.” Natasha shakes her head, and her curls bounce around her face at the motion. “There’s a simple solution to all your problems, Steve. Just ask her out to dinner.”
Her captors have seen her soulmarks, seen them bright and vivid on her skin,  and are confident their clarity means they can treat her how they like and she’ll survive it all. But there’s illness raging in her, ravaging the little strength she has left, sapping everything but the desperate wish to die.
She groans and stretches as best she can, wincing with mingled discomfort and relief as her spine pops in several places. She grinds the heels of her hands into her eyes, craves a shower so badly she can practically feel the scalding water pounding on her tightly-wound shoulders, can smell the shampoo she is going to
Methodically, he pounds into the bag, every hit a precise blow, every muscle and tendon in perfect control. The bag rocks rhythmically on its chains, rattling softly as it moves back and forth, vague impressions of his fists leaving vague dents that shift as the bag does. If he pretends hard enough, he can almost see Dr. Fennhoff’s face silhouetted in the dull shine, and his hits get a little harder.
“You’re okay with the armor then?” she mumbles, head lolling down. “I wasn’t sure you would be after tearing apart so many of them.”
Toni’s the first to move. She takes a single, hesitant step towards him, lifting a hand to hold out towards him. And all of that might have saved the situation, if only he couldn’t see how badly her hand is trembling. If only he couldn’t feel her panic. If only he didn’t know that if she let her inner reaction come out of her mouth, she’d be screaming her head off in terror.
For someone who only two nights ago hadn’t known their routines, their walkthroughs, Steve’s picked it up quick. Toni’s shoulders loosen at his words, and she rolls them comfortably, settling into an easier stance. “Yeah,” she says with a tiny grin. “How about you? You with me?”
"G'night, Rhodey." She quells the guilt and tries to feel like she didn't just lie. It's a lost cause, because she's pretty sure she's never going to be ready. Because she's done her research and she has a pretty solid idea of what the white star edged in blue is supposed to mean.
“Thank you, JARVIS,” Carol says politely, then grins at Bucky, who just stares at her in complete non-comprehension. “We got together over the last few days,” she explains gently, “and figured that this would happen sooner or later. JARVIS has been monitoring the Malibu mansion and keeping us updated. Everything’s taken care of, Bucky. You can just go.”
Bucky paces restlessly beside her, because he’s figured out by now that she can’t see or hear him, and he snarls in frustrated helplessness. “Get up, Toni,” he says, skids to his knees beside her. Can’t stop himself for reaching out to touch her, try to shake her awake, try to bully and manhandle her back up. “Get the fuck off the floor already. You’re stronger than this. You don’t die here, not like this.”
Tony would hopefully brush over it, not wanting anyone to realise about the mindwipe. He’d insist on doing all the research himself. Maybe he’d even blame himself for a mistake with the mindwipe? That would be perfect.
He really wished that the rest of the team were there. Hawkeye would be exceedingly useful at watching everyone’s backs, whilst he was sure that Goliath and Iron Man would have come up with something to stop this tentacle...creature, whereas at the moment Iron Man and himself just barely had time to react to their movements, let alone plan some form of effective counter attack. The day had seemed like it was going so well to begin with…
Steve tightened his grip and Tony’s voice choked once more, thickened by tears. ‘Medic’ he mouthed at one of the lingering agents. This babbling sounded insane, but it sort of made sense. The similarity of colours, how familiar the movements had been, the challenge of the fight…
What if… What if he could manage to somehow convince Tony that someone was planting this vision into his brain? If Steve could keep Tony from being able to think… then he might just mean that Tony would forever more be doubting his own thoughts as to what actually occurred here. The lack of control, and certainty, could haunt his husband for years to come.
Steve watched dispassionately as Tony fell, eyes slipping closed. He could not see the table which impacted with his head as he slumped bonelessly to the ground. No one attempted to break his fall.
“Can I come?” the words burst out before Steve had even had a chance to think over his schedule. He was car-sharing with Bucky today… but the other boy could always pick him up later, right? He’d moan, but Bucky liked moaning. It made him happy.
The Iron Avenger kept his gaze fixated on Steve’s with a steadiness that was utterly foreign to to Tony Stark, but Steve very much associated with Iron Man, and it didn’t take the captain long to realise that Tony was trying to match breaths with him. Pulse hammering wildly in a visible throb at his throat as he swallowed once, twice, trying to calm himself down.
student, or indeed person, per say. He just talked a lot. And had very little shame. Or verbal filter. And no compunctions about irritating, well, anybody. He enjoyed making people look foolish, and had the brains and abilities to back up that enjoyment.
Could he call this guy kid? Oh why the hell not. Pepper probably wouldn’t get on his case for annoying someone who was kidnapping him, would she?
“...we had to, Steve.  You, y-you have to understand.  We tried to talk to you. There wasn’t another choice; they didn’t give me one! And you just didn’t listen! I didn’t know what else we could do.” Tony’s words were quiet, rich with sorrow and grief, echoing through the vibrating air, a slight slur audible to the rapidly swelling lip.
Normally, when Tony came in this exhausted, Steve would put his (usually empty by now) cup to one side, move any of the paperwork he had been doing off his lap, get up and go and take Tony’s coat before leading him to the sofa to relax while he made him a drink. Normally they’d kiss, a gentle kiss full of promise of what would occur later. Depending on Tony’s level of exhaustion he might give him a massage as they sat next to each other on the couch. Practically on each other. Sharing the same air, the same cushion. Everything.
As for the AI? Well… he couldn’t leave the poor little lonely soul. Not after that had called out to him quite the way it had . He couldn’t give it free rein, not the way Jarvis had, after all, it had already shown ever so slightly murderous tendencies and built itself a sort of body using tentacles. But he did install it in a toaster with very, very strict firewalls.
Tony didn’t want to know what expression his face had turned to to cause Wade to switch away from Pops so quickly. Or why the young man was suddenly backing away so that he was firmly sandwiched next to Peter. Though maybe that had been a tactical move judging from the cat got the cream smile on his son’s face.
Steve paused for barely a moment to throw his shield to one side before diving into the turbulent waters, not taking the time to consider whether the tentacle monster was alive or dead.
Chilled liquid spilled over his hands and he shot the newly cracked mug a glance, irritated. It had been some time since his emotions had been so out of control that he’d cracked or broken a mug. He knew his limits intimately these days. This lack of control was yet another symptom of the directionless anger roiling in his belly.
Something seemed to infuriate the tentacles, causing them to whip through the air at a much faster pace, more jagged than previously. Whereas previously they had mostly been keeping their distance after that initial attack, now they were most definitely not.
Rhodey knocked on a door with childish lettering made from elderly-looking robots proclaiming this to be ‘Tony’s Room’ and an even more elderly-looking scribbled handwritten note instructing all ‘Trespasirs’ to ‘KEEP OWT OR ELSE!’. Steve didn’t bother to hide the quick grin.
Steve carefully did not examine how this made him feel. Did that mean that this whole endeavour had been pointless? Would Tony learn anything from it? If Steve’s plan came to fruition, then he would at least experience the feelings of violation that Steve himself was feeling. Hopefully Tony would feel the way Steve felt when he first woke from his nightmare with all these new memories.
The thick metallic tubing, tentacles was the only suitable word to describe them really, which exited from the car?
As the pair conversed over him, Tony managed to extricate his hands and papers sufficiently so that he could carry on his planning. One hand absentmindedly fell to his son’s head and started petting his hair in a rhythmic fashion. It wasn’t quite as soft as it had been when he was a baby and they’d first fallen in love with him, but it was still ridiculously soft and fluffy. Just like a duck’s downy feathers - they’d called Peter ‘duck’ for years when he was a toddler. That had indeed been the boy’s first bout of accidental magic - transfiguring something, an egg? Into a duck.
Peter swiped at his eyes with his free hand, fiercely scrubbing away any tears before they could properly form. “I...I love you both too. Just… thank you? For, just for being you guys. I am so, so lucky.” He sniffed loudly, feeling his face heat up as he scrubbed at his face again.
“Good evening, Mr. Wilson.” Steve managed to get out after he and Tony had finished exchanging a horrified look between the pair of them.
The rest of the evening continued with banter passing cheerfully around between the four of them. Peter cheerfully set some
“Get back!” Quartermain shouted, taking control as some of the nearby agents stood stock still, almost hypnotised by the sudden appearance of the sinuous limbs. “Let Captain America and Iron Man manage this, this is above our paygrade!”
He was getting himself worked up. Calm. Calm now, soldier. The time for action was coming. This was a war, as vital as any other he’d fought in. One of the most important things he’d learnt over the years? The value of waiting.
With renewed determination, Steve threw his shield at the offending tentacle and watched with vicious pleasure as the disk cut through the limb causing the red tip to splash down into the water below where this latest creature had seemed to emerge from. “Tin-man, what’s your status?” Steve pressed, as he caught his shield on the rebound, looking around for his next move in this target rich environment.
“I… I trusted you. I loved you.” Steve’s words now were mere murmurs, whispers of sentiment swept away into the silence. “How could you do that to me? My mind. My thoughts. My memories. You stole them from me! Tore them from my mind. How could you. Why, God damn you, why?!”
“Hey!” came the instantaneous response, as Steve had known it would, “Why should I try and do them when, if I do it badly enough, I know you’ll take over and do it for me?”
Steve’s throat clamped shut, refusing to allow neither oxygen nor words to pass through it for one heart-stopping moment before his rational side kicked in.
It almost felt like they were being toyed with. A feeling that only got worse as Iron Man started being batted between two of the tentacles like some form of ball. A cat toy. Tentacle toy?
the cake and knocking it to the floor. Steve and Wade just exchanged a look and both rolled their eyes in fond amusement in the face of their partners’ irritation.
Stark, without pausing, nodded before hurrying back the way he came presumably to contact Iron Man, suit jacket dropped carelessly to the floor.
The kid. Cremin, to call him by his name, though maybe cretin would suit him better, seemed ridiculous. The fact that Tony was in this much pain from an encounter with him? It just added insult to injury, really.
The bench itself was worn, but not that tatty type of worn from being uncared for, that type of worn that demonstrates much usage and love over the years. Many feet had rested upon this bench with knees propping up hefty tomes as eyes devoured the treasured words within. This bench had felt the detritus from thousands of pencil shavings and particles of charcoal dust from drawings achieved upon it. And let’s not discuss the amount of coffee that had been spilt on it. The wood was littered with rings from mugs of past days filled to the brim with that life-giving elixir.
“He’s not… pushing you for anything, is he Pete?” came his Pa’s next question, a short while later. His furrowed brow indicated that he had been worrying over that thought quietly for some time. And it was that honest concern which broke the last bands of worry in Peter’s chest. That was his Pa. Always seeing the best in people until the possibility came that either he or his Dad were being hurt. Pa always says that they were both too soft and keen to please people, and always worried about them.
“And, I didn’t think of that...why?” Came the words, still frustrated but at least edged by a glimpse of self-deprecating humour. Iron Man paused for a moment as the plates residing in his shoulders retracted revealing glinting missiles beneath. “Shifting to armour piercing rounds for this hunk of squid, me thinks. If you’re right, then the central mass should be...there.”
The air seemed to crackle with the tension that laid between the pair of them as Steve’s steely glare bore into Tony’s bowed head.
As his gaze returned to his unconscious husband, the slight lightness that had coloured his thoughts danced away like dandelions in the wind.
Peter didn’t try and disguise the bark of laughter at Steve’s expression. “I’ll remember that trick, thanks Dad!” He determinedly ignored the exaggerated expression of betrayal his Pa sent him.
The pair did get Tony back to school for the following Monday. Then he relapsed again and nearly had to be admitted to hospital.
“I’d like to be!” was the instantaneous reply, as well as the first time that Steve stared directly, challengingly, into the other boy’s eyes.
Tony finally turned his gaze to Steve, and the moment that Steve’s mindset, and clothing, dawned on him was obvious to the soldier. Those exhaustion-glazed blue eyes roved over the tense muscles and the fixed, steely expression. The shoulders squared and readied for battle. Steve could almost see the supposed futurist’s mind ticking as it rewound over the past few moments as and the differences in Steve’s behaviour slowly dawned.
Instead, he opened his mouth. Peter, warned by some sixth sense of the incoming disaster, froze and reached his hand up to try and cover his boyfriend’s mouth.
The next thing he knew was Iron Man was standing beside him, one arm outstretched in that oh so familiar pose and firing at the thing that was tugging the dazed Steve towards the suddenly turbulent sounding waters edge. The familiar sound of a repulsor blast rang out, and the rope around Steve’s ankle slackened allowing him to scramble to his feet in time to regain his wits.
He pushed himself to his feet into a crouching position, resolve strengthened anew, with nary a creak of a joint to betray how long he’d been kneeling there stroking his husband’s motionless form. Without a sound, he began to undress the lax body, devoid of any joy or passion despite all previous associations with the act. Each move was perfunctory in nature, with no hint of emotion daring to cross his wooden expression. Steve determinedly shoved away thoughts of all the times he’d laughingly stripped this responsive body, playful words, kisses, being shared between the pair.
She inhales deeply, goes up on the balls of her feet, and presses a light, quick kiss to his lips. “I have absolutely no idea. I am literally humming with energy, and I have no clue how I’m gonna burn it off.”
There’s a rhythm to Clint’s marksmanship, the steady whisk of an arrow out of the quiver, the creak of the bowstring, the
this happened, but my data set is incomplete. I need my medical records, reports and readings from my stay here while I was out of it in order to piece together a more complete picture.” He tosses Steve one of his boyish grins, impish and hopeful. “So what do you say, Cap? Help a guy out?”
you should be if you end up with marks. That it means your souls are connected beyond the bounds of time and space, and…” She waggles her hand vaguely in the air. “… you know, metaphysical strings and quantum magic and fate equations. And I just want to know who decided that metaphysics was a valid
Bucky’s putting together a sandwich in the kitchen when his phone buzzes with the chime that means he has an incoming text message. He glances quizzically at the counter, where he left it when he decided to make himself something to eat. He pops a few cherry tomatoes in his mouth, and sets the container on the counter to scoop up his phone.
“Sorry,” he says, but doesn’t sound at all apologetic. And there’s nothing but fond amusement coming across their bond either.
Steve leans forward, all but off his chair, looking over the rail at Doctor Cho moving around Toni, ashen and still unconscious, adjusting leads and electrodes with delicate precision. His whole body is thrumming with tension, and a muscle in his jaw keeps jumping.
Toni drops the suitcase, and it lands with a dull thud, and Steve lets go of her as she collapses into Natasha’s arms, her own arms coming up to circle Natasha’s waist, burying her face in Natasha’s neck. “Okay,” she says, shaky and faint. “If it’s what you want.”
Steve’s other friends got in on the act too, and soon Tony had a solid friend base which did wonders for him. It wasn’t a smooth journey. There were screaming and shouting matches. There were threats of running away. There were bouts of crying so jagged that Steve feared Tony would rip apart beneath them.
Steve, shaking off his own stupour, echoed the agent’s words. “Move back, we’ll handle this. Set up a perimeter and keep the civilians away, now! Move it!” The agents, well trained in following instructions, immediately began moving in a coordinated fashion, escorting some of the more stubborn observers with varying degrees of patience as they went.
Steve followed Rhodey up the path and in through the unlocked door. Security much? “Tones?” shouted Rhodey as he toes off his shoes and jogged up the stairs to the right hand side of the door.
Once Iron Man was situated correctly, Steve began to kick as fiercely as he could whilst cradling his precious cargo. He didn’t think he needed to keep the man’s neck safe the way he would an unarmoured individual, but it surely couldn’t hurt. And it stopped him from thinking about how silent the comms were. Or how still the armour was.
Steve couldn’t have said how long passed while he knelt there, completely oblivious to the world that was bustling around them, as he stared steadily  into Tony’s eyes, trying his best to offer the grounding presence that was so obviously needed. His right hand, he noticed, had slipped down so that he was grasping the armour’s gauntlet, and neither man could have explained precisely when that had happened.
Tony clearly did not see the fist which came smashing into the right side of his face with a massive crack of something shattering beyond repair.
Iron Man’s voice caught his wandering attention, and he leapt to the side, tucking his entire body up behind the shield in a move as instinctive as breathing  as he dodged the tentacle that would have hit him a moment later. If he were someone else he would have no doubt sworn under his breath at the near miss, but, other than a grunt as he hit the ground, rolling as he did so, all he uttered was a quick “Thanks, Shellhead,” as he sprung back up to his feet batting at the tentacle with his shield once more which was making a renewed attack on him.
“Tony will be so mad with me when he knows I’ve told you that, and rightfully so…” Rhodey’s shoulders slumped slightly causing Steve to rest his hand on one broad muscle.
“Look out!” was all Steve could get out before three or four held the metallic figure firmly within their grasp, all of his limbs encircled by writhing tentacles that prevented him from moving an inch. “Iron Man!”
he knew the man he loved. He could tell what kind of day he had from the way he left the elevator. He’d had a good day when he left the lift before the doors had even finished opening, hands flying everywhere as his fast-paced footsteps strode around their shared living space, his mouth barely able to keep up with his thoughts that flew around his head. When he came in like this, he was tired down to his bones. He’d drop his briefcase the second he entered the room as though it was just too heavy to bear.
