The idea that she could be killed by this man bugged the crap out of Toni. Because this was not how she saw it. In her earlier days, she wished she would die after a good round of sex. Now, she wasn't so sure, but this wasn't it. Okay, Rollins probably wasn't going to kill her, considering he did go through all this stupid shit, but she refused to let him have any control over her. She was fucken Iron Man, and she was going to get out here, kicking ass on the way out. She wasn't some victim. "Asshole," she hissed. Her hand dropped from face and turned to him. Her eyes dropped to his guns again, running a few plans through her head.
"Fine," she said, annoyed; however, she couldn't keep her mind off Peggy and whether she should tell them were Steve was located. Maybe, he would want her to…Toni didn't know if he would, but her guilt was getting the best of her, and she wondered when she would snap. It would only be a matter of time before she did.
"I got you." The woman repeated, softly and warmly. "It's okay." For a few long seconds, the woman just held and rocked the genius, trying to calm her. "I got you."
between us. Nothing! There has never been anything between us."
Anyhow, I am again sorry for the long update. Also, I would like to say that it may seem like I am rushing through Iron Man 3, but I have a reason for that. I don't want to spend too much time on IRON Man 3. I just want to get past it.
"It seems like you do."
That was my problem, and for that I am sorry. But at least, I am done with that movie.
It was correct. Toni had made her choice, and she would be sticking with it, even if she wasn't hundred percent sure. "I wouldn't say it was me, who made it, Pepper. It was you. You made the choice. Don't put this on me."
Maya took another step closer, though she was already in Toni's personal space. "Then help me fix
"Wait, you're really leaving?" Toni asked surprised. She wasn't expecting him to leave so easy, and she kind of didn't want him to leave. She had been sitting in a room alone enough and she wanted something to do even if it was just staring at someone.
Tony waits until Natasha is gone and down the hall before he opens his eyes, and for a while, he just stares at the ceiling before he rolls toward the edge of the bed. It's like he's in a slow motion movie as he's moving ever so slowly. Every movement feels like there are needles stabbing him, and it's extremely painful. Sure, the nanos are working and healing him quite well, but there's only so much they can do. Like with most injuries, he needs to rest. He knows he needs to, but he can't sleep here. Not here, not where he used to sleep with his Brooklyn Boys. Not where he used to feel so L—No! He refuses to use that word, because it isn't that. It was never that, and now, this place is tainted. He can't sleep here anymore.
Tony looks over the blanket, trying to ignore Bucky who is
Toni let out a sigh as she patted Steve on the upper arm. "It's fine, Cap," she replied. She took a step away from him and toward Hill and Fury. "These two aren't anything I can't handle."
"Where are we?" Tony asked as she didn't recognize anything.
Covered in sweet, Toni awoke with a startle, bolting up in a wobbly cot, which shook beneath her weight. Her body trembled as if she was freezing, but she was burning up. An unnatural heat rushed through her, and she felt like she was on fire with flames licking her skin. With this heat, Toni thought she was going to die, and trying to cool down, she thrust the heavy blanket off as quickly as she could. However, she was still overheating even with the cold, bitter air.
The man stepped forward to grab Toni, but before he could reach her, the genius threw a punch at his nose. He stumbled back, trying to catch his balance, but Toni didn't let up. She dropped to the ground and kicked his feet out of his legs. For a second, he didn't move as if he was in disbelief. "Y-You," the man hissed from the ground.
"Miss," JARVIS called, breaking into her thoughts.
Why was the room spinning? Why couldn't she catch her breath? "I wouldn't do that." Toni briefly eyed the card that Wilson gave her, remember what he had said. She just needed to let it out. Just needed to talk about it. Would he pick up? Would he ever want to? She was a killer. "I just want this to stop."
Barnes glanced toward his best friend before turning back to Toni, who had turned away. She sensed a battle between the two starting and she wanted nothing to do with it, even if it was all about her. She turned and looked for a way out, but she saw none, even if she was very good at sneaking. However, she might be able to go out the front door without them noticing. "Hi," she waved, unsure what to say.
Pierce didn't look unhappy at the turn of events, but he didn't look please either. "It had to be done, and besides, it sends a message that Hydra does not fool around. That Senator was stupid."
She needed to get her mind off Barnes- the ever-present nightmare- or she would go crazy...if she wasn't already. She was hearing things, wasn't she? At times, it really did feel like she was crazy even if she denied it with every breath she breathed. She had to be with the amount of times she had seen or heard Barnes. Only insane person would see or hear a dead man.
No, there's not a tightening in his chest. Nope, it's all in his head; though if it isn't, he isn't sure which one he is jealous of… He likes the both of them, though he doubts any of them likes him. "No wonder if he does-"
Oh. No, no. I think he's trying to say 'I want my goddamn file,' Doll Face." Savin replied, his mocking tone changing. Putting on a fake Brooklyn accent, there was only person he was trying to mock Toni with.
Tony tilts his head and glances around the room, wondering why it's so silent. Where's the banter from the peanut gallery? He doesn't miss it, but it's weird. He scans the room, noticing it's just the three of them. The rest of the room had cleared out at some point, leaving them to talk it out. "Then why?"
"You really want to know, don't you?"
"Miss Stark," JARVIS called again, when she didn't answer. "Miss Stark," the AI repeated.
"Still wearing the pants in this relationship," Toni replied, smiling. She turned to the monitors and started to flip through the articles that JARVIS had pulled up.
He glanced over his shoulder to Potts who was standing in the doorway of Toni's personal lab. Being like a big sister to Toni, she was taking her disappearance hard, and it was clearly visible in her voice and appearance. She looked like she had been through hell and back.
The Super Soldier laughed as he pulled back. He could feel his heart flutter at the sound of her voice. She was still upset, but her mood was improving. But he wished he knew what had gotten her into this mood. "I got you."
That was her clue to go. "I'm going for a walk," Toni stated loudly as she walked to the closest. She grabbed Roger's coat and put it on. Barnes eyed her the whole time, knowing why she was leaving. She didn't want to be here for the argument that was about to happen.
In the next chapter, we get to see Toni is the hot state of California and we get to see if Hydra's plan works.
Hearing his harsh tone, it filled Ton with a few different emotions. One was anger, because no one was allowed to talk to her like that, like she was a child, and she was close to snapping on him for that. However, guilt and sadness also filled her, because she had brought this pain onto him. "Why w-"
However, as he thought of Loki, he couldn't get that look Loki gave Toni out of his mind. He kept seeing it as it reminded him as a lion hunting for its next meal. It was a clear sign that Loki wanted something from the brunette, and that comment about a magazine was proof enough. However, whatever it was, Steve wouldn't allow him to hurt his Toni… Wait, his? When did he start referring to Toni as his?
Home? To her, Steve was home, but she was here with him already. What was he talking about?
"If the shoes fit, wear it, Captain Asshole," Toni stated.
Biting down on her lip, she forced herself quiet—which was harder than it should've been-, as she turned her attention back to the issue at hand. Her anger flared as she remembered why. Yes, she knew that Clint had a point, a valid point; plus, she was really angry at herself. She was the ass seeing things. She knew she shouldn't take it out on everyone else, but she had no self-control in this sleepless state, not that she had any control period. "Well, don't miss," she replied, catching sight of Rhodes leaving with the President. She could rest slightly at accomplishing their main goal.
"We couldn't have known that. If that base was half as full as it could've been, we would've been screwed," Rogers argued.
Toni sighed deeply as she started to struggle in his arms again. "Let go," she uttered, unable to break his grip.
Kicking off the blanket, Toni shuffled herself to the railing and felt for the leveler to release it. After a few minutes of struggling, she felt the leveler and pushed it in. The railing fell, pulling her down with it. Pushing herself up a little, she stared at the heart monitor. Will these machine alarms go off if I pull these off my chest? If they did, her escape would be blown, but she had to risk it.
"You better be there when I wake up," Tony says, turning deadly serious. "…I hate cold beds." He pauses for a second, wondering if he can say it. "But if…if you aren't-"
*O*O*
Laying her down in the bed, he was a bit surprised that she hadn't awoke. Though he tried to be as gentle as he could, there was only so much he could do without disturbing her. While tugging off her pants, he could only do so much not to shake her too much. However, considering how tired she was, he could understand why she hadn't stir, though it scared him slightly. He couldn't help but wonder when the last time she had slept
Howard looked at her. "I didn't say it was."
Toni took a few deep breaths as she tried to calm herself. She was useless when she was like this, and she usually did very stupid things like going out into the woods alone. She may have been imagining things, but her stalker was back and he was after her again. She should tell someone, but if she did that, she wouldn't be able to find out what he wanted or who he was; plus, she wouldn't have another second to herself as Barnes and Rogers would never leave her side. Or she would be stuck in some lab with her father as if she was something that needed to be protected. She didn't need to be protected; she could protect herself.
"I th-"
He shook his head with a chuckling sigh. "Well, those times were fun, and… I can't believe I'm admitting that to my daughter," he said, still playing with his hands.
So that was how she ended up in her lab, which hadn't been repaired or touched since
to him. "40." She answered truthfully, or so she thought. She wasn't even sure she knew the real answer. She had truly lost track.
Toni turned over ever so slowly to him, and with a dead and sleepy look her in eyes, she forced them open. There was no doubt that she would remember this conversion in the morning. "I wanted
"Yea, I wouldn't want your germs."
The Professor, on the other hand, looked completely annoyed, though it looked like there was a hint of enjoyment under it. Even with his irritation, it was hard to take the man seriously as he was covered in rainbow paint from head to toe, much like the rest of the students and the classroom. "That was quite the show, Miss Stark."
"Hey," she said, as she entered. He looked up from what he was working on and smiled. The table in front of him was filled with regular 1940's guns and each looked different from the last. The table behind him was filled with stolen HYDRA weapons and they were glowing brightly.
After hearing what Jim wants, Tony knows he has to say no, even if the pilot fights him. He doesn't want—can't go to Movie Night, as there's no doubt that the Brooklyn Twins will be there, and he can't deal with them at the moment. His emotions are all over the place, and it's hard to think straight. "No," he says strongly without missing a beat.
"Steve…"
However, just as Steve didn't think could worse, Romanoff and Thor walked into the room, which caused the tension in the room to jump. At this rate, Steve would be surprised if a fight broke out, which wouldn't be any good. There was no doubt that a fight would take out half the ship and hurt a lot of people, Toni being one of them. That was something he wouldn't allow, even if she pissed him off.
Rogers blinked, trying to focus his thoughts, and turned completely to Barnes. "Yes." He paused "What about you? You ready to follow Captain America into the jaws of death?"
Back to the point, Toni had grown out of the world domination phase many years ago—too much work-, though some like Hawkass might think otherwise. Although…Maybe, it was Barton, who had the dream to take over the world and he was taking it on her. Projecting on her. It was
"Super Spies don't need a key," she muttered under her breath. If there weren't so many red flags, Toni would be overthinking the tone between Fury and Steve, but something was off. Fury didn't just randomly show up, unless he wanted to mess with your head; however, this wasn't one of those times. Seeing the warning flags, she could feel it in her bones, though that could be the lack of sleep. She
Toni had an urge to look up at him, but she forced herself to look at the shield. "Can we…go back to the tower… and watch a snappy Disney movie?" she asked, weakly. She wanted—needed something to take her mind off everything.
"Have you been talking to Vision lately?" he asks, his eye twitching. "Talking to him behind my back? I feel betrayed! Betrayed!" Though he knows that Vision wants to help, he detests the idea of Vision and FRIDAY talking—if that's the correct word for it. Tony isn't sure that he considers it talking if they're only transmitting information, but it's all the same to him. They're talking behind his back, and it pisses him off. He doesn't like when people talk behind his back unless it's to say how awesome he is.
"Miss Potts," Steve uttered, turning to her.
thoughts out of his head, and he will, even if he has to take a hammer to his face. He needs to move on,
He glanced at her. "Thanks, but I'm fine with everything. I don't need help with Agent Carter." He turned away quickly.
Toni wasn't sure if it matter anymore if they found the Commander, because she would be gone, always from her evil grasp. But, it did matter. She wouldn't feel safe until that Commander and her Stalker were caught. "Okay," she uttered, not sure if it was a good idea to keep recent activities of the stalker a secret. However, she wasn't sure if he was working with Loki, and if the Stalker was working with Loki, she couldn't tell any of them.
"Bucky," Steve says smiling. "Give him a second."
He looked at her. "You've faced a lot in your life, haven't you?"
with his nightmares.
*O*O*
"How are you functioning?" Bruce paused as he looked the dead tired Rogers over. "How did that mission go?"
"Ms. Robot!" The genius from the future felt her eye twitch as she turned toward the direction of the voice.
Steve said those words, Toni's chest tightened, and her cheeks reddened. She knew Steve noticed, as he smiled upon seeing her reactions. "I just…" She started but drifting off a few seconds. "I know. It's just…" She didn't like feeling weak, like she was going to fall apart at any second. That wasn't sexy.
"No, I'm good." Toni eyed Peggy as she stepped away. "What's going on? Where are we going?" she asked.
As good as that sounded, Steve didn't believe that was the case. Something felt off; maybe, it was the message that she left him earlier. It sounded like she had reached the end of her ropes and was ready to throw in the towel, which worried him more. That wasn't Toni, but she hadn't been herself in some time. She hadn't been sleeping, forcing herself to bed with sleeping pills, and now, she was blaming herself for everything. Even if she couldn't stop it, every death was her fault. Combining everything, it was a recipe for something horrible. "Let's search the surrounding area. She might still be here." He replied, not wanting to talk about what was going on in his head with Clint.
Skipping steps, Steve quickly made his way down to the labs with only one thought on his mind. The idea that the strong, stubborn, iron-willed genius whom he loved with all of his heart was hurting made him sick to his stomach, and he wanted to punch the man or thing that had done this to her. He wanted to destroy whatever had hurt, and he would do anything to protect her from getting hurt again.
However, it pulled at her heartbeat race at the same time, as Toni watched the head piece of her Mark 42 suit burn and melted (Yes, it was that hot). Though her suits were just metal, they were her babies—her greatest creations. They were what made her special, more than that spoiled rich bitch. They made her a hero (some might fight on the degree, but they could shut their face) and gave her meaning. It made her a better person. So, watching her suit, her baby, burn was a shot to the chest. It felt like someone had cut her open. It was like she was bleeding.
Maybe, it was the way he said it, but she believed him. Believed that he would do whatever it took to make her his. But why?
"Vibranium. It's stronger than steel and a third of the weight. It's completely vibration absorbent."
That struck Toni as odd, because she didn't understand why those names would mean nothing to her soon? Did he want her memory or something? However, what would her memories give him? Maybe, he wanted her brain? But she didn't understand that ether. She knew she should find out, but to be honest, she was too exhausted to care as she had already put too much thought into this game, and she just wanted to get home to her own bed. "What is it that you want? I'm tired of this game."
She thought, knowing he was already dead. There was nothing that she could do to change that, and she hated-
"Did you mean it? You didn't want me to save you?" she asked.
living here, even though he spent most nights here. Granted, she also didn't like that it placed her within spitting distance of Fury. She would rather be in New York, her city, in Stark Tower (Was she paying for it? Yup, then it was Stark Tower no matter what Barton called it) than here right now, but she was finally biting the bullet. Steve was here, and she wanted him, so here she was. Not knowing when it happened, he was
"Oh, it seems like we have our Captain back. Oh, Captain. Oh, Captain," Clint said, smiling.
are interested in our
Clint chuckled as he turned to the door. "I better leave you two idiots alone before I see something I don't want to see." When he stepped into the doorway, he paused and stared at the Super Soldier. "Don't you hurt her, Rogers," he threatened, his voice turning serious. "You'll find some arrows in some painful places, if you do. Painful
Steve didn't know if he wanted to look at these folders; it was one thing to
As time went on, she wasn't able to make sense of the rapidly coming images, which she couldn't stop or control. With small, shallow breaths, Toni felt like she was watching scenes from a movies, while having a drinking game. Nothing made sense to the Genius, and the growing headaches forced her to her knees. She could barely hear JARVIS speaking in her ear, saying something, but she couldn't make out any of it out. These bloody images were all she could think about, the only thing she could focus on.
"Rogers."
"Geez, you make me look like a bad guy. What's wrong with not wanting to answer questions?" She knew she should shut up, but it was hard letting someone else have the last word.
"So how many time have you seen the tie on Toni's door?" Clint asked, winking at the Good Captain.
Killian smiled as he turned from Toni and headed to the door. When he stepped pass Steve, he paused for a second and straightened out his suit jacket. He looked over at Steve and smiled. "Congratulations are in order, Captain Rogers, and don't worry I won't touch your
"Wait," Steve said suddenly as he stopped
"They'll just think you two are married," he chuckled.
He gave her a funny look. "So he is Rogers again?"
"P.S., the answer is still no, but you can so let me go," Toni said, eyeing the device in his hand. Then Toni wondered if she should let him know that she knew he was behind this. If she played dumb and not alert him that she knew, she might learn something. She might be able to trick him into giving her something that she could use.
The Genius laughed. "Oh, so are you saying you're not so
Steve looked at him with an eye brow raised. "Did something hit you in the head?" He paused as he thought about it. "Time travel? Have you fallen asleep reading a science fiction or something?"
The rebel in Toni stood there for a few seconds. She hated this following orders without question. She liked to question; she was a scientist. She didn't take anything at face value, which was another rule she lived by.
"I heard you, but you're not a very good actress," he replied, as he stood a few inches from her.
"I guess," he stated.
Toni let out a chuckle. "Which I will. Right, let's do this," she said, turning to the whiskey bottle. She knew it would be stupid to take another shoot, but she needed it.
All of the sudden, she felt a pair of eyes on her again, and she turned toward the window. There he was again, staring at her.
"Rumlow, he's seems interested in Stark."
"Please," she begged, crying into the person—the woman's chest.
her. He needed her for support, as she seemed to be the only thing in his life at the moment, which annoyed her slightly. Why was it her job to cheer him up? She barely knew him, really. She didn't know him in the future and she didn't know the past him either. So why did she try? She knew she didn't have to, but she didn't like him depressed and it wasn't because she cared (she refused to care). It was because he was annoying to be around when he was that.
Killian opened his month to respond, but the door to Pepper's office opened, stopping him. "I have to agree with that," a voice said from the door. The man's Brooklyn accent was strong and hard, almost striking. "You're lucky I don't hit you for touching my girl without her say so…well that is for any Dame."
Toni glanced toward Peggy before leaning back and looking up at the roof of the plane. "I will behave," she said as her
She turned to him slightly and Steve could almost feel her glare on him. "Captain," she replied curtly, her voice plain. She was clearly irritated.
"I would be," Dugan interrupted from across the plane. "She can be scary when she wants to be."
She had to get help and it was obvious that Jarvis wasn't going to. "S-stupid AI," she muttered. She tried to push herself up again, but she didn't make it. She fell harder again the cold ruff titles. She tried to look up at the moon, so she could focus, but when she looked up, everything started to spin. Her fuzzy vision had gotten worse. Black spots filled her vision. She started to shake as she felt the wind pick up. What happened to the walls? The walls should have provided some kind of protection. Maybe the Device did more damage to the building than she thought, and that frightened her. Her teammates were in the Tower, and she didn't want anything to happen to them.
Toni couldn't help but groan, as she could imagine how painful that was going to be. "Fine."
"Sark, that was uncalled for," Peggy snapped.
Toni turned him, eyeing him. Maybe, she should tell them where the plane went down. She could tell how much Steve meant to all of them. Maybe, Steve would be happier in this time with his friends and…Peggy. Maybe, that was why she was here in the first place. Maybe, it was fate's way of telling her that she should change the future. Maybe, it would be for the best. "He…was," she said, stumbling over the word was.
The Captain didn't look up, feeling useless. He wouldn't help but wonder if he was only good for war, for battles. It seemed like that was all he was good for. He went out on missions, and when he was finished, he went on more missions, while she was here alone. How could he expect to have a healthy relationship with the woman he loved? She couldn't sleep, and he knew it, but he wasn't there for her.
She hated that voice and Pepper knew it, which was why she used it often. It was why she could hardly say no to Pepper. "I'll be up in a few." Both of them knew what that meant: maybe in an hour, but Pepper wasn't going to call her out on it. Calling her out wouldn't help, and she did get Toni to agree, which meant she would be up at some point. She just didn't know when.
"The plan is still a go for Miss Stark. We just need to eliminate Fury and Rogers. I must say, I didn't expect Rogers to be such a pain in my side, but for our plans to work, he must be removed." Pierce's eyes fell to his tablet, giving the article a once over. "I don't give much attention to this crap, but it is informative." He stared hard at the words: Wedding of the Century. "Could give Hydra a run for our money, but they're wrong about that. That wedding is never going to happen, even if Hydra allowed it to happen. Rogers can't handle Stark to save his life."
"Why would he help us find Stark?" Steve countered staring down Barton, who was leaning against the door frame. He held his bow in front of him as if he had just gotten back from a battle and hadn't had the chance to disarm. "He has to be up to something."
"Good for her." That man could lie as easily as he can breathe. Though she knew to doubt everything he said, his lies blended so well with the truth that it was impossible to tell them apart. No lie detector could best him, even the ones that SHIELD had invented. Toni would be impressed if she didn't think ninjas were going to drop from the ceiling. She had to force herself to look at Fury instead of ceilings.
Okay, it really bugged Toni that she had no idea of where he knew her from. "Why would I change? I was and am still awesome," she replied, knowing full well that she wasn't awesome a few years ago- before she became Iron Man.
With a bit of hesitation, he wiped the tears from her eyes. "How often do you have nightmares?" he asked. He had a hand on her knee in a sign of support.
Tony isn't sure when he has fallen asleep, but when he comes too, there're two pairs of strong arms around, holding him tight. There's also a hand in his hair, combing through his hair, and neither of these large hands belong to Natasha. "Barnes, Rogers," he utters as he opens his eyes.
*O*O*
"I don't think she's going to stop calling you that, Colonel," Howard stated as he placed her device back into the metal suitcase. Both Toni, with a glare, and Phillips watched as he did this.
At first, the order annoyed Steve as he didn't need to be told that, but he knew he was being silly. Like him, everyone was worried about Toni, and it was understandable how protective they were being. It really was, but there was something inside of him that balked at the idea. He had no idea as to why, but what he did know was that he needed to get Toni to bed.
It was night and day as Harley's eyes widened. His fear disappeared as he realized Tony was referring to. Pausing his struggle, Harley quickly reached in his pocket and used the device that Toni gave him, which blasts Savin to the ground with ease. Seeing the man stung, the boy wasted no time and placed distance between them as he could.
"Toni," Steve called, hands at his side. He knew her mood swings and how nasty she could be when she hadn't been sleeping. He knew how cold she could be when she had a bad nightmare. This mood was a clear sign that she had a horrible one, and it didn't help his urge to pull her into his arms.
The terror and anxiety only grow in their voices, which only makes Tony worry though he has no idea why. Is his situation really that bad? Should he be concerned? Okay, he knows he should be, considering the amount of pain that he is in, but with the pain, it's hard to think. It's hard to understand the reality of situation. It's hard to worry about anything when he can no longer feel his body. And he knows he should be worry about the inability to feel his body…if he still has a body. Maybe, he is dead? He knows that's a bad sign, but he can't find it in himself to worry. He is just-
She struggled against him as anger filled her. She wanted to say something smart back but she didn't want to give him the pleasure, though it was so hard to remain silent; she did have a big mouth and all. So hard. Why was every man in this time a sexist pig? Even the criminals were sexist. Where were the nice, non-sexist people of the 1940's?
Pepper glared, because she wasn't treating Toni like child. She was treating her how she needed to be treated; she needed someone to watch her, to tell her to take care of herself. "What she needs is to get away, and stopping risking her life on a normal basis. She isn't a super anything." She couldn't take it anymore. What if Toni died? "What if she gets hurt and can't recover? She isn't an agent or a soldier. She can't handle it."
"Steve."
"Someone help, please!" he yelled. "Help!"
"Stupid," Tony utters as he gets to his numbed feet. He has been in the lab for so long that he forgets the last time he has been upstairs. He does know that he needs bath, if he's to judge from the smell coming off him. "I need to get out," he says, stepping away from his work. He needs to get his mind off Rogers, Barnes and his food, and get out. He needs a night out with some woman. A man would be a painful reminder of what he can never have.
"I don't want to know," he replied, sternly.
This isn't the only reason why he doesn't say those three little words to them, even if they're on the tip of his tongue, but it's a big reason. It doesn't matter how happy he is, as there'll always be this doubt inside of him. He knows he should tell someone, but again, he's afraid. Yes, he knows nothing will get better if he doesn't say what's on his mind, but what will happen if he does? He fears that he may say it and they won't say it back. If that happens, he
"Nothing can make that worse," Bruce said as he smiled from one of the sofas. There was a small first aid kit on the table in front of him.
At first, Toni wasn't sure he was speaking English, because that didn't make any sense. But once it clicked in her head, she was in complete shock. That couldn't have been true. She couldn't be pregnant, not with all the precautions she took. "Am not," she protested. What the hell was going on?
"I respect a lady's wishes," the doctor stated as he turned back to her. "You did ask me to leave. I will not impose myself on you."
Gabe turned to Dum Dum and said, "She's the one Barnes won't shut up about."
"Who's he," she asked, as she felt the top of the blade. She would be out in a matter of seconds; she had to hurry.
God, she loved this man. "Yes."
She was getting really sick of being treated like some weakling because she had a damn vagina. "Does this has to do with me being a fucken woman?" she demanded as she got into his face. "I thought you were different." She couldn't believe Barnes was a sexist pig like Phillips.
Toni stared for a few seconds, trying to read her face. "Besides the fact that we're so playing into the woman stereotype, I don't need a cupid. Why would I need a cupid?" In reality, her playing cupid may not be the best idea when they were in a war time; however, there wasn't anything else she could do besides fixing her device. She couldn't offer help without altering the future.
"Relax, Stark." Rumlow ordered, calmly though irritated.
"Are you just going to leave that there?" Trip asked, turning to the coat.
Natasha lets out a harsh sigh, clearly irritated. "If you want me to keep Barnes and Rogers out, you need to give me something more than that," she says, waving lazily at him.
"You only say that because it's your name, but if you were named anything else, I doubt so," she said, making a face at him. With a deep breath, she scanned the area once more, her eyes glaring at anything out of the normal. She wasn't looking for Rogers—believing he was in Mexico by now with his speed-, but she wasn't sure what she was looking for. Was she looking for
The Doctor looked up at her face and he could see the pain written on it. "Corporal, the shock has numbed your arm. You should gain the feeling back in your arm in a few hours. Do you want a sling?"
"Toni!" Peggy called as Toni turned and ran.
"Natasha," Steve said, giving her a look. Though he knew she wouldn't kill the reporter, he was slightly worried at what she might do to him. She had that protected look in her eyes.
All of the sudden, it hit her like a pound of bricks. "A bomb isn't a bomb when it's a misfire. This stuff doesn't always work, right, pal?" she replied, glaring at the computer screen. "It's faulty, but you found a buyer, didn't you? Sold it to the Mandarin. Got you." There was a small smile on her face as a plan popped into her head. It wasn't necessity a good plan, but it was a plan.
Rogers had never asked her to call him Steve, and she didn't know if she would be comfortable enough to call him that if he asked. Besides, they mostly just called each other by their last name and she was good with that as they weren't really friends. "Thanks, Steve."
"And you brought her here?" Barnes asked, still eyeing her.
"What mood?" he asks, feeling the pain in his body intensify. "This is the standard Stark mode."
His eyes softened. "Yes, Tones. I do," he said, no guilt or shame in his voice. "Is that so hard to understand? You're important to me, and I would and will do anything for you. I thought Steve would do the same, but I guess I'm wrong. He isn't here." There was a bitterness in his voice when he said Steve's name. "How can he just leave you like this? What the hell is wrong with him?"
Steve takes few deep breath. "No, Tony. It isn't that."
"In this case, I didn't wish to be," he said, eyeing her. "Are you okay?"
"No, answer?" she asked, after not hearing a reason. She stood still, frozen in her own thoughts, thinking if she should say what was on her mind. "Let me tell you something: I don't let people in, Rogers. I learned that the hard way, and I made a mistake in letting Barnes…and you in. So I'm correcting that."
"Ha Ha. I'm not kitten."
"The Red Skull. He was told you were be here by a strange third party and I was sent to collect you."
poster he was pointing too. She had seen that movie a hundred times; it had been one of her favorites growing up. "You want to see a romantic movie?" she asked. Most men would run from a lovely dovely movie. "It's a good movie. I had seen it quite a few times, but I'm not sure you will like it."
"You know you'll never get home without the power to create rifts through space and time, and your device does not have that." He paused. "No matter what you do, it will not have that power on its own. I can help you get that power."
"Yea, but I wasn't the center of attention of a crazy man," Barnes replied as they walked slowly.
The Good Captain could feel the Craze Genius' wandering eyes on him. She watched him like a hawk as he walked to one of her dressers and pulled out a shirt and pair of shorts. She watched as he set the items on the bed before he disappeared into her private bathroom. It was the only time he didn't feel her eyes on him, and it didn't last as he stepped out of the bathroom with a first aid kit in his hands.
Clint lowered himself to the ground and ran his fingers over the raised edges of the footprints. They may all have the same shoe, but each footprint was different. His heart skipped, counting the number of footprints he was seeing; Toni was outnumbered. He could make out her footprints clear as day, as hers were much smaller than the others. The other—four, if he was counting correctly—were larger, and they were clearing SHIELD agents—could they still be called SHIELD agents? They betrayed everything that SHIELD stood for, and he refused to think of them as agents. Pushing those thoughts away, he recognized the tread of the shoes for SHIELD standard issue combat boots. Toni was in trouble.
Though the pain lessened, she still felt like she was on fire, still felt like her skin was melting, but with Aldrich in front of her, the pain was at the back of her mind as he served as a good distraction. And her anger was strong. "You're something else," Toni muttered out, feeling her heart flip as she struggled with the whirling emotions in her head. She also tried to ignore the itch under the skin, not that she would be able to scratch it being tied to the bed. And she felt like she was itching everywhere.
"Who is she to you?" the Same Comrade from before asked. "I have never seen you act like that."
"The suit is on its way. Miss Stark will return shortly."
He turned back to her. "You're never going to like me, are you?" he asked.
"No, don't be sorry, Toni," Peggy stated. "There's only one person who should be sorry and that is Schmidt."
Toni glanced down at the envelope, which felt heavy in her hands. "Isn't the true," she said, smiling, as she tried to hide her rapidly beating heart.
However, she knew she couldn't stay here, where the culprit could get her too.
On the plus side, she hadn't seen her stalker since the night in the alley…though, it didn't mean he wasn't still following her. He could be and she might not be aware of it, which scared the shit out of her. As she took a deep breath, she told herself that she couldn't allow it to get to her. She had shit that she had to do and she couldn't waste time on feeling scared.
Taking a deep breath, Toni opened her eyes as if she had heard something. She scanned the dark room, trying to see if anything was out there, but she couldn't make anything out in the darkness. She closed her eyes and leaned her head back, thinking about a new Iron Man Design. It was the suit that kept her sane. She thought about all the ways she could improve it. And if she wanted a break from the Iron Man armor, her mind would wander to the unnamed device and ways that she could power it.
"I think you're smart enough to know who?" he stated.
"And are we going to sit around and do nothing as he tricks us?" Steve snapped. Clint eyed him but said nothing.
His name really did inspire people to follow him, didn't it? Steve wasn't sure how he felt about that at this moment. "Where can we get our hands on one of these things?"
"I try," he said. The whole in the floor had been repaired, making it look as nothing had happened and that stung a little as something had happened. They were missing a team member, and it wouldn't be the same until she returned.
"Care to talk about it?" Bruce asked, bring her out of thoughts. "I know I'm not the best, but I'll listen."
Steve's heart was pounding in his ears, breaking his cool. He failed Toni, failed her when she needed him the most. God, he didn't deserve her.
The Colonel's face crunched as he chuckled. "Wasn't talking to you, Stark. I was talking to the prettier Stark," he replied.
It had always annoyed her that she was treated differently than men. "Let me tell you, I hate when people treat me with kid gloves. I'm just as good as any guy." She fought the urge to hit him, which she couldn't do any ways.
*O*O*
He shook his head. "You wouldn't understand," he said as he pulled her away from her slowly. Her hand moved to his leg, which stopped him from pulling away.
"Not scared." Toni couldn't take her eyes off the spot and she knew she wasn't fooling anyone.
*O*O*
"This reactor," he started, using her word, "is very interesting. It's intergraded into your body. Why is that?" He learned forward in his chair. "When the doctors found that thing, you freaked out not letting them look at it. You had knocked out a few nurses, yelling at them not to touch it."
for an update on your status. Hours, Stark! We weren't even allowed to wait at your bedside with Romanoff standing guard? Do you fucken know how that feels?" He's shaking in anger as Tony remains quiet. "Damn it, Tony, answer me."
Toni did have a slight hangover but it wasn't anything that she hadn't deal with before. Seeing that man yesterday had scared her sober, but it gave her nightmares that kept her up for hours even with the alcohol. She knew she couldn't keep doing this as it would go crazy. It could also hurt the mission… Maybe, she shouldn't go, but she promised Salty that she would. He had done a lot for her, so she would do the same for him, even if it risked the future. I wonder how much of the future I have already messed up, she thought as she took a deep breath.
Clint glared. "You just like to bring up shit that she doesn't want to talk about, so yea, I blame you." He moved toward the door. The music was louder in the hall way.
In the past when she didn't want to be alone, the old Toni would go out to some random bar, get drunk, and pick up some random, hot (unless she had on her beer goggles on) guy with one thing in mind: Sex. Back then, it was the one thing that could make her feel anything. It was the one thing that distract her mind from the pain, and for those few hours, Toni was happy. However, it didn't last, and she ended feeling worse than she did before.
Leaning toward her, Barnes squeezed her knee. "Pick one of us."
"Hey, Toni," he stated with a smile. "How are you?"
"So this is a bachelor pad. That makes sense."
(See the end of the chapter for
Silence befell the labs after Bruce left, and neither one of them spoke for a few minutes. It wasn't until Steve shifted that Toni moved. Her glance turned cold as she pulled her arm from Steve, who release it without much of a fight. "If you don't mind, I'm going to go take a shower," she replied, turning from him.
Okay, this conversion was getting weirder and weirder with each passing second, and Toni was counting the seconds before she could put this man in her rearview mirror. She couldn't only take so much crazy, and Hawkeye had put her over the limit days ago.
Iron Man turned and stared at him. For a few long seconds, the genius didn't reply. "Looks who back," she said, as the suit opened up and Toni stepped put. The genius was soaked heat to toe and covered in mud. "Wasn't expecting you back so soon. What do I owe this pleasure to?" she asked, as she waved to him.
*O*O*
"Why would I believe you?" he hissed as he ripped up the card. "And why don't you just shut up? I had enough of your lies" Letting the pieces fall to the ground, he pulled out a knife from his belt. It was a long skinning combat knife with a blade perfect for cutting the muscle from the bone. With a cruel smile, his expression turned deadly, as he started to play with the blade between his fingers.
I love reviews. They are the food to my soul.
"Oh, you knew she's growing on you," Howard replied with a laugh.
Toni, who had forgotten about her chest piece in her confusion, looked down. She felt like an idiot. How could she forget about that? It was the keeping her alive. "My reactor," she muttered, closing her eyes. When she was in the empty lot, something she could tell from the photos, the reactor was fading in and out. Opening her eyes, she glanced down. It wasn't fading, but it wasn't as bright as it usually was. The Device must've drained it. I should've listen to JARVIS, she thought, feeling stupid. The Arc Reactor was barely visible through the hospital gown, and that wasn't a good sign.
So damn it, she was alive, which was what Steve and Pepper were holding on to. Which was why Pepper was rushing back, even when Steve told her she didn't have to, that she was safer at a distance. He told her that he was going to track Toni down, even if it killed him, but he understood Pepper's worry. He understood her drive. If it was him, he would drop—well, he did drop everything without a second thought.
Toni's nerves kept growing as she wanted to get this over with. She glanced toward Phillips for some kind of support, but his glances were only warning. "Peggy is so not my mother. Too classy for you." Her heartbeat was racing, putting yet another stain on her tired body.
"Toni," the voice called again, placing a gentle hand to her face.
Maybe, Bruce was right, but she refused to believe that.
She stepped away rather than fight with him, because it wasn't worth it. "Why thank you," she said instead. "I enjoy my mouth. Guys do as well." Toni intended for that to be dirty.
"I don't want to talk about it."
After that fight, Rogers (he was Rogers again to her) and Toni hadn't spoken in a few days. She knew Rogers wanted to talk to her as she caught him staring at her, but she wasn't going to make the first move. She refused to make the first move, because she was Toni Stark, damn it. People came to her, not the other way around. Besides, it would be best if they didn't make up. She didn't need him missing her.
Acting like an adult, she walked out of Barnes' bedroom and into the kitchen. Rogers, who was sitting at the table, looked up then looked back down quickly. He hadn't made eye contact for more than two second, which bothered her. He sat very still and positioned a newspaper in front of his face so she couldn't see his face. "Rogers, we need to get over this," she stated, deciding she would rather make up with him than suffer this awkwardness anymore.
*O*O*
"For once?" Toni responded, fighting to keep her eyes open. "I'm always bearable." Peggy snorted. "HEY, I am!" Sassy said something else, but the engineer couldn't make it out. Sleep had overcame her and she became dead to the world.
Unwilling to force her to remain in his arms, Steve's arms dropped to his side and allowed her to step away from himself. He hated to let her go, but he couldn't force her. It would just push her way, and he didn't want that. He had to let her think, and he could see how tired she was. He could see that something was wrong, even if she denied it. He could see that she was hurting. "Toni."
Steve watched as Tom was wheeled away by some male orderly, telling him that he needed to take some pills. It wasn't until the elderly man was gone that he spoke up. He didn't want to talk in front of him. "Toni Sark."
"I'm not going to let my best friend look for a pretty dame by himself," Barnes smiled as he zipped up his coat. "Let's go."
"You have a mouth." He took a deep breath. "So be it," he stated as he walked out of the door.
The Colonel looked at her as if trying to read her. "Why should I believe you?"
"I'm always right," he said, with a grin.
"Miss, may I remind you that you've been awake for nearly seventy-two hours." JARVIS said, snapping Toni back to reality.
"Doing what?" Barnes asked, still eyeing her. There was a question look in his eyes as he studied her. It was clear that his roommate didn't bring random women home with him.
Toni's patience had gone out the window, well if there was a window. "You just like to poke," she stated.
Tony feels like he has been punched in the stomach. How did he misread everything? How did he think that they didn't want him? Can't love him? "I thought you didn't want me. I thought I was just some-"
"You're alive! You…you came, you came back," Peggy cried before she turned to Toni. "Oh, Toni, he's back. He's back." Tears were running her face before turning back to Steve. "He's back."
go." Why was he bring this up now?
Tony is fully aware of what Steve is implying, and he's all for it, even if this wasn't the plan when Rhodes had pulled him out of his labs…Okay, maybe, this is too soon after everything that had happened. The Brooklyn Boys still abandoned him for a week, though he now understands why. Bucky's night terrors are nothing to joke about, and they need to be taken seriously, but Tony does to as well. However, they know this. They know everything.
"Мой гений."
want to talk about what happened. She wanted to move forward with her life and forgot it ever happened, though she doubt she could. Her nightmares were getting worse, and she doubt she would be able to hide them for long. She knew they would try to force her into talking to talk about it when she didn't want to. "Banner," she snapped. "Just check the reactor. Damn it."
hit the asshole who called her that. Salty was the exception to that rule though, as hitting him would land her in a cell. However, maybe she could glue him to a chair… That might still land her in a cell.
She took the bag from her back and set it on the table. After she packed up the unnamed device, she heard someone behind her. She internally cursed as she turned around; however, she cursed loudly when she saw a gun trained on her. After getting her annoyance and anger under control, she spoke, "Hello, Agent Carter. It has been a long time." She put on the biggest smile that she could muster.
She gasped at him, genuinely shock. "…How would you know? Been watching me, pervert?" she asked.
Even with everything going on, there was only one thought in Toni's head and it was 'oh crap.' This wasn't the first time she ran into one her super fans, but man, this person was one of the extreme—the mega crazy ones. Plus, he was giving her the
"Same here, buddy," Sam answered.

"Hey, I love that gene," a voice said from the doorway.
"Just being honest." Barton said with a shrug.
Colonel Phillips had them on the move again, and this time, Toni found herself in Italy. The camp was located on the edge of the woods, which would prove some coverage if there was an attack from the sky, and it would also make it easy to escape into the woods, which Toni had learned. Instead of her long walks through the camp, she would sneak pass the border of the camp and the guards. They had almost caught her the first few times, but she had learned their schedules and found a hole. It worried her slightly, but she didn't alert anyone to the security risk. It wasn't her place, and if she told them, it could ruin the time line.
As they walked, Toni kept noticing him glancing back at her. What's going on in that head of his? She asked herself. Was it because of the neighborhood they were walking into? It was bad. Was he embarrassed by where he lived? He shouldn't be. She already knew who he was and where he came from (not the whole story but still); he didn't need to worry about what she was thinking… But maybe he should, she thought, knowing how judgmental she was at times.
"Yeah, yeah, don't let it go to your head," she replied, waving him off. "I know I'm the prefect child."
She closed her eyes, but her grip did not loosen on the box. She didn't reply, hoping her silent would clue enough for him to leave her alone; however, Howard did not move from her side for what seemed like hours. He just sat there in silence next to her, staring at the rain, and it wasn't until the rain let up that Howard spoke again.
She shrugged before saying, "Funny things are."
"If a father cannot tease his daughter, what else is she good for?" He laughed as he allowed her to pull out of his arms. He met her glare as she stared at him with an intense look. "Plus, it's good for you. It helps build character and keep your high horse in check." Her glare only seem to intensify. "Okay, I will quit." Howard took a step back. "However, I wished we could've talked more. I would have liked to have known you better."
"Toni, please," he said, almost begging after a few long seconds of silent.
He smiled. "Looks who calling the kettle black," he replied as he crossed to the device on the table.
"What good would that do?" Agent Hill asked.
He glanced back at the door before he made his way over to the monitors. "You only got a seven or minutes at the best."
Erskine's eyes widened as he realized Phillips plan. "If she does try to break into Stark Industries, we will know the truth and will have grounds to hold her. If she doesn't, we'll know that she's not a threat."
For some time, Toni just watched him sleep, looking for any sort of movement or clue that he was going to wake up. She found herself wondering how long her father had been sleeping at her bed side. Had he been here the whole time that she had been out? He couldn't have been there the whole time, right? That was not the father she remembered growing up, but then again, she had been learning that since she arrived in this time. This was not her father.
Letting him do so, she smiled at him. "I should just stay out of the kitchen, right?"
It wasn't until a few seconds later that Rogers spoke. "I had some ideas about the uniform," he stated slowly, handing something to Howard.
"Peachy," she said as she mindlessly played with the dog tags around her neck. After the talk with her father and Peggy, she had decided to keep the tags. Her guilt was still there, but if neither Howard nor Peggy hated her, how could she blame herself? How could she hate herself? They were right. There was nothing she could have done, and she needed to believe that. She needed to let go all of this guilt as it as eating her alive.
She side-glanced at this chest, knowing to what he was referring to. He had probably seen
"What?" Clint says, innocently, as he puts on a goofy smile. "Just wait until Barnes see Stark cuddling with
Toni laughed at him. "Hey, are you insulting me now?" She asked. She loved how red he got. "Am I not good enough for you? Do you not find me attractive? Can I beat you?" She shook her fist at him.
Her eye twitched. "Enough Steve." She narrowed her eyes at him as he gazed her over again.
Chapter 13:
Toni didn't stop running, but she couldn't stop herself from looking back. She really wished she hadn't, as Barnes' eyes cut through her like she was butter. She thought his voice was bad enough, but it felt like she was looking at the devil himself. She could feel her panic take over, see his battered, broken form. It was a nightmare that she would never be able to rid herself of. Her very soul sobbed at the sight of him, and like that, all hope was gone.
She looked him over and he looked just as tired as she felt. "I'm fine," she said. "Besides, I think we have other things to do than talk about our feelings." There was some bitterness in her tone that she couldn't hold back. She didn't understand his need to talk about her emotions, which she didn't want to acknowledge.
"Unless, she changes her mind in a few seconds, which is highly likely. Miss has some stalkerish tendencies toward Captain Rogers. We are currently working on that," JARVIS said in her ear. It took in everything in the genius not to respond.
"Toni," he uttered again.
"No," he interrupted firmly. "No buts." He let out a soft sigh. "He would've never blamed you for his death. He would probably yell at me for letting you think that. He joined the army—much like everyone else—prepared to give up his life to serve his country. To save people. No one like war, but he thrived. So…" Steve drifted off, taking a deep breath. "He knew what he was doing when he picked up my shield. He knew he might not come back. He knew he could die, but that didn't matter. He did it to save me. So in reality, it is my fault, not yours."
"Crystal," she said, tensed. It came back at her like a ton of bricks. She remembered where she had seen him before: the hardware shop. Earlier Barnes and she had visited the shop, and she had thought that she was going crazy when she had spotted the same man outside looking at her. She had thought she was paranoid, but now, she knew she wasn't. "I'll be back. Have to use the little girl's room," she announced getting up. She didn't know why he was following her but she was going to find out.
Toni didn't think it was possible but Steve's face was red like a cherry and his mouth was moving a mile per second. "No…I-I'm…being….f-friendly…." There was a pause as he took a deep breath. "I just wanted to make sure you get home safe."
"Hey, I take insult to that," Toni mouthed out, bitterly.
Toni started to step to her father, and she could see everyone's shock around her. She could see the looks in their eyes telling her to stop. She would see their worries look, but she didn't let those looks get to her. "Howard," she yelled, feeling her exhaustion creep on her again. It felt like her energy start to disappear as the device powered up.
"Sark, look at me," Phillips ordered.
"G-go away," Toni hissed. She couldn't deal with him when she had an aching head. No, she couldn't deal with him at all.
Jim didn't respond at first, only letting out an angry grunt. It took the Colonel a few tries to get words out, and when he did, they were anything but friendly. "Does everything sound okay,
and the utter betrayal she felt, though Toni had no one to blame but herself. "It sounds like something you can and will turn into a weapon, like enhanced soldiers, private armies, and if you caught my press conference a few years ago, I do NOT make weapons."
(See the end of the chapter for
Though she would never admit it, there had been a couple times that she had been hungover or even dunk when she flew the Iron Man Suit. It wasn't because she meant too; it just happened, and it wasn't like anything was going to happen. She had JARVIS if something were. Future Rogers had been suspicious of her a few times, but he didn't accuse her of it. If he had, they would've been a fight, which was what he might've been trying to avoid. "No worries," she said as she waved it off. "What about that girl for you?" she asked, pointing toward a few woman on the other side of the bar. "They can't say no to a man in uniform."
Toni, in shock, brought her arm up to protect her face as a few fragment of glass flew at her, slicing her. It wasn't anything substantial, but the cuts bleed. The wave knocked her back a step, as she wasn't expecting it to be so strong, but it didn't knock her down like it did Howard, who landed a few feet from her. Slowly bringing down her arm, she turned to her father, who had a smile on his face.
Phillips took a deep breath as he stared at the typewriter. Normally, he would have someone else type it up as he spoke, but he couldn't, not with this one. He had to do this himself, because he was only person who knew the truth. However, he wasn't sure why he had to write it, since she knew this was going to happen. She had to have known that his forces would be taken, that his forces couldn't last against Hydra, so why did she go? Was the item she needed so important? It had to be if she needed it to get home, but why would she go on this one? Did she know something he didn't? If he thought about it, her just being here told him too much. They had to have won this war somehow.
He knew he was letting his emotions get the better of him. "Stop lying!" he replied, regretting his tone as soon as he spoke.
When Steve came to the next morning, he was alone in the bed, which didn't sit well with the Captain. With a cold bed, his first thought was that she went back to the lab to work herself death, which turned his stomach. Readying for a fight, there was no hesitation as he jumped out of bed and onto his feet. There was only one thought on his mind, and that was Toni's well-being. He had to find her, go to her, hold her; however, he didn't have to go far to find Toni, who was standing a few feet from him at her floor to ceiling window. With her arms wrapped around herself, she was staring out at the calm ocean.
"You're too perfect."
I think I should clarify something so no one is confused. The future isn't going as fast as the past is. So many months may have passed in the past, but in the present, it has only been a few weeks.
Phillips narrowed her eyes. "It never fails does it, Stark? No matter how worn out she is, she'll always call me that," he said to Howard, annoyance in his tone – but with fondness buried deep within his tone that Howard could barely detect unless he hadn't been looking for it. Or maybe he was biased, now that he knew she was his daughter (no matter how hard she tried to deny it) and thinking that everyone should love her.
After a few seconds of staring off at the wall, he rotated onto his back and stared up at the off-white ceiling. Sleep didn't come even though he was dead tired, and he didn't know how to deal with that. Like with alcohol, pills didn't work as his system just worked them out. He supposed he could just count sheep, but he got distracted after he reached 100. The only he could do was closed his eyes and hope sleep would come to him.
Howard took a deep breath. "That isn't it." He paused. "You're already hurt, and adding that core to your device won't be as simple as you think."
Barnes took a deep breath. "I'm not Steve." There was a half-smile. "If you want to go, then go. I won't stop you, but you don't have to."
"And we'll have the upper hand this time," Barnes added. He stepped away from Phillips and made his way toward Toni. "Besides, Toni has a mean right hook," he smiled as he put his hand on her shoulder and squeezed.
"Not the time. Not ever the time." Romanoff commented, giving him a nasty look. She flipped to her feet and turned to her next opponent.
"Just give up. No one will miss you.
I hope you enjoy this chapter. Haha.
Being annoying as ever, he pretended that she shot him in the heart. "You hurt me, Stark." He smiled at her. "I thought we could be friends." Her eye twitched. "But Thor can't give me what I want," he revealed.
Natasha smiles. "Not too hard to imagine. You aged well." Tony glares at her. "Well you do, and after Steve asked you out, we thought-"
For a while, Toni just watched him, seeing how much he enjoyed what he was doing. She could see the happiness in his eyes as he worked, and it hit her. For the longest time, she had thought that he had hidden in his labs to hide from her. She thought he couldn't stand to be around her after her mother's death, but as she watched him, she realized it wasn't that. He hid for the same reason that she hid. He hid in the labs as it was the only place that brought him peace, which was the same with her.
"Play date, Dear. I have to make sure all of your friends are clean." She could trust Sam…Well, maybe. He did pass the background that JARVIS ran on him, and Toni now knew where he shopped for his food. There was a small family own store down the street that he often went to. She also knew where he brought his clothes. Okay, she undoubtedly over stepped, but now, she knew he wasn't hiding something.
Toni took a deep breath, knowing she should let him leave. The Colonel, who knew what he was doing, probably sent him in to get her to speak, because Erskine had a friendly face. Though it wasn't often, the Captain in her time had only good thing to say about the Doctor. "Then you should let me go?" she asked.
He was sick of people telling him what to do. Why couldn't Fury just give him what he wanted without a lecture? Yes, he understood that he was only taunting himself, but he would be haunted even without the file. He couldn't even close his eyes without seeing the battlefield; he couldn't see anything but bloodshed. "I just need the file on Toni Sark. She worked closely with Howard Stark."
She never finished her sentence as Toni grabbed her from behind. After scuffling for a few minutes, they both ended on the ground. "Calm down," Toni whispered as she rolled on top. She had been trained to defend herself, but it was challenging with a broken arm.
Steve didn't like what he was feeling right now. His stomach twisting, it felt like he was abandoning Toni, though logically he knew that wasn't the case. He couldn't help Toni, until he figured out what the hell was happening. It was just that he wanted to hunt down the man that took Toni and kill him, but as Natasha had told him for the hundredth time, figuring this out was the key. This would stop whoever it was that attacked Fury and had their favorite genius. However, that didn't stop how he was feeling. "Take your feet off the dash. We're borrowing."
"We should wake her," he stated, eyeing the pained expression on her face.
Toni snorted as she folded her arms across her chest. "A warning would've been nice. What kind of team members are you?" she asked, pretending to be hurt. "Can't trust anyone, can I?" There was playfulness in her tone that wasn't here when they got off the elevator.
Peggy laughed. "Don't worry, Toni," she started as she stepped into the circle. "I won't let him go too crazy when you're born."
Without knowing where he lived (she knew it was somewhere in Brooklyn), she had no idea if they were close, which made the walk even more awkward. They had walked mostly in silence as she had no idea of what to say to him. She didn't want to insult him again, because it would happen again if she said something as Toni Stark was an asshole.
The handler glanced toward the image and cursed. "It's time for the chair," he replied, annoyed.
Until next time.
"Afraid of the big guy?" he asked. There was a hint of laugher in his anger that Steve wasn't expecting.
Author note:
As if she was standing too close to a firework that just went off, her ears were ringing from the gun shot. For a second, she wondered if she was death? Were gun shots always that loud? "I'm fine," she replied, though she doesn't have any reasons to believe that. In fact, it was probably the furthest thing from the truth. She really wasn't feeling anything at the moment…So, it was possible that she was shot. It would be odd if she wasn't shot. She was
After making sure they were alone, he spoke, "Stark, relax." He paused. "I take your relationship with your father was shitty?"
"You can study it later," Came Steve's bitter response.
Toni tightened her jaw as she watched him pick up the tool and play with it. It turned out that it wasn't just a scoop as he squeezed it. She wasn't sure if he was going to use it on her, but she didn't like how easily he flipped in his hands.
Still eyeing her, Bruce walked to her. "Sure, Toni."
just come out of a coma."
However, that isn't the only reason why he cares deeply for those two. He adores their laughs, the tones in their voices, and he finds himself doing things to make them smile and laugh without even realizing it. Stupid things. Really stupid things that he had never thought he would be doing. He, in fact, had made a rule way back when that when he started dating to never do these things, but here is he doing them… Maybe, that's what his father meant, but Tony doesn't want to look at it like that. He doesn't want to see it as them controlling him. He wants to see it something more, because it has to be if it makes him feel like
*O*O*
In anger, she slammed her fists down on his desk. "Listen to me! I need to go." She paused as she tried to read his face. "If you don't let me go, I'll go anyways. Nothing I tried with the device worked, and this is my last shot. If I don't get this, I won't be able to go home." She let out a weak chuckle. "Besides, I'm not supposed to be here, so who cares if I die?"
"Yes," she cheered as the handcuff fell from her hand. Giving standing another try, she pushed herself to her feet, and for a few seconds, she thought she was going to land back on her ass, but she didn't. She felt a breeze on her back as she walked toward the dresser. The thing turned out to be a pen, which could be helpful later if used correctly. "I have to do something about this gown thing."
Dugan and Jones laughed behind her, while Trip eyed the scene in front of him. Toni was now at a panel on the wall typing away at something.
Toni felt herself laugh. "I didn't do anything. If he's heartbroken, it's because of Agent Sassy Kissy Pants," she said.
"You were like this before he died," he said pushing her patience. Why couldn't he just let this go? Why couldn't he understand she didn't want to talk?
"Building," she corrects. "But close."
Struggling with the Mark 42, Toni's mind flashed back to the fight with Steve a few hours ago, just before her mansion was destroyed. They fought mostly about her recklessness and her inability to accept that something was wrong, not that he could do the same. However, she didn't want to accept that anything was wrong, even if she knew that something was. She wasn't sure she could acknowledge it as that meant she had to face it, and she didn't know how to handle that, which was why she turned to her suits. They were her much needed outlets and what was wrong with having something to focus on? Surely, it was better, right? Surely.
"I know." He took a deep breath and turned away.
Rogers looked at her with a smile. "You're something."
. In the beginning, Howard was everything a child could want in a parent. But years before his death, he had turned into something that a child would never want, and she was turning into that, which her father never wanted for her.
After making sure her back was dry, Steve shifted as he lowed himself back down to his knees. His pants were made for combat, and there wasn't much room in the groin area, which he was learning. No matter how much he shifted, he couldn't get comfortable. He wasn't sure if Toni noticed as her eyes were closed, and her breathing was soft. Her expression was relax.
Toni could feel Brock's eyes on her as he watched her hop over to the suit, trying not to put any weight on it. He must have thought she was funny, but he didn't laugh or crack a smile. She glanced at him one last time before he suddenly looked away. She wasn't sure what he was look at, but she wasn't sure that she cared enough to find out. She just wanted to get back to the tower, find Steve, change out of her wet clothes, and get off her sore ankle. Like her shoulder, her foot was throbbing. Even if she refused to admit, she was close to tears.
"Nothing." Toni eyed him. She held her breath as she watched his eyes drifted down to her chest. For a second, she thought he was looking at her boobs again, but he was looking at the spot where the reactor was located. "You're looking at my chest again and there's nothing to see. I'm not showing anything." Her shirt was hiding her chest.
*O*O*
"Stark already has a big ego as is," Natasha said as Steve stepped into the common room with Toni in his arms. "Carrying her around like that is only going to make it worse." The assassin's eyes wandered up and down Toni's form, studying every mark on her pale skin.
"You must think so as well, since I'm live," she replied. She wiggled her fingers trying to keep her hands from going numb. She could barely feel her feet as it was. "Or do you have crush on me?" she said with a wink. "That's so cute, though I would most likely break your heart, well if you have a heart."
She stopped suddenly and turned to him. "I, Toni Stark, do not get scared," she snapped rapidly. It took her a few seconds to realize what she had just said. Maybe, he won't notice, she prayed to herself, but she wasn't that lucky.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Where's that?" Steve asked; his heart picked up.
"Tony?"
"Toni," the CEO yelled, sounding annoyed.
"If this doesn't work? What else is there?" Steve asked. He closed his eyes as he tried to recall a memory of Toni. He couldn't remember anything past that one. He didn't even know if the memory doctor had brought her back. Would any of this be worth it?
Steve paused, closing his eyes, and took a deep breath. He was a gentleman, and he hated to see any dame in pain. Just by touching her, he could see that she was in extreme pain, and there was nothing he could've done for her a part from getting help.
?" she asked, playing along.
Barnes took a step toward her. "Why don't you tell me what you need and I'll get it for you?"
to be in her head. It just had to be, and if she thought it through, it made sense. You brain couldn't function without sleep, and she hadn't been sleeping. Anyone with half a brain could see that. Barton made comments about her sleeping habits all the time. With her lethargic brain playing tricks on her, there was no doubt that she was seeing things. "No."
"Again, Rogers. What do you think is happening between us? Sure, you're a fine example of an ass, and I wouldn't mind a roll in the hay with you, but you seem like the clingy type, which is so not my type."
"I will tomorrow."
Anyhow, I hope you like this chapter. With chapter, I was to make it through Iron Man 3. I don't want to rush or have the chapter feel like it is rushed, but I don't want to spend too long in Iron Man 3.
Why couldn't this kid just shut up? Did he not understand that she needed him to shut up? Why did he have to keep going on? "No," she replied, quickly. She couldn't have PTSD. She wasn't a soldier. She was an engineer, a mechanic. She didn't get PTSD. Starks didn't get PTSD, though it made sense…NO! She didn't have it, though she did wake in a cold sweat almost every night and saw blood every time she closed her eyes.
Sam leaned back into the tree. "There's nothing to be ashamed about. It doesn't make you weak."
"Thanks. Let me do something with this hair and we can go." He nodded as he went back to the table.
his hand on her shoulder. Yes, Toni most likely looked like a wet rat, but that didn't mean she was helpless… yes, her ankle was useless, but that was beside the point. She didn't need him to help her. "Nice to meet you, but my ride's here," she said, eyeing him. Being that it was past midnight, she didn't trust anyone. Only a crazy person was out at this time, but she wouldn't trust him at any point of the day.
Tony's back hurts like a bitch, and he's starting to regret rejoining the Avengers, though he should stop trying to quit being Iron Man as it never sticks. Ever. He keeps saying that he's done, but he's always putting the stupid suit back on. He's too old for this shit. Too damn old for it all.
*O*O*
Toni couldn't take it anymore. Why couldn't Peggy understand that she didn't want to talk? She wanted to be left alone. "I want to go home, okay? I don't want to be here anymore." She was sick of this time, and even if she would have to deal with all of the lectures from the Avengers, she wanted to be with them.
Toni let out a sigh, not used to Phillips calling her Stark in front of people; however, she rather enjoyed hearing it instead of Sark. She missed her last name, which had opened so many doors for her. "I don't want
Howard took a deep breath. "You're hurt. Take the rest of the day off. Put your sexy legs up. A Lady does not need to work this hard."
"Toni," Steve uttered, automatically taking a step to her. He scanned her over, looking for some kind of clue to what had happen between Pepper and her. However, he didn't notice anything but the change of clothes. She was dressed in an old, worn-out, oversized MIT sweat shirt that was a dress on her. She looked so small in it that he wondered if it was ready hers; however, even in the old, discolored item, Steve still found her attractive.
This was as far as their conversion went, but she seemed friendly enough to have a real conversion with. In another life, he might've flirted back or attempted to. He was a horrible flirt, even after the growth spurt and he just had to smile. He just rambled on, until someone stopped him in his tracks. Toni would just stare at him and let him go, only stopping him when she had a good laugh. She loved it when he rambled. She thought it was cute. "Have a good night," he added.
Toni let out a snort. "I don't-"
(See the end of the chapter for
Toni didn't respond as she was too busy trying to keep up with him. He was dragging her faster than she could keep up with, and she kept tripping over her own feet. He didn't say anything but she did catch him looking at her from the corner of his eyes and she could have sworn that he was laughing at her.
"I did my research," Toni said.
"We weren't, so drop it." Barton sounded annoyed. Barton and Banner were always coming to her defense as they seemed to understand her the best after Pepper and Rhodey.
With the sudden return of feeling to her body, Toni's brain was spinning, and she couldn't make out completely what he was saying. Was he even referring to her? She wasn't sure. She wasn't sure of anything besides her growing headache.
Her eye twitched, not liking the idea that someone was watching her. "Well then your men suck," she replied. "Didn't stop me from breaking into your company."
"We're getting along better, so there!" she yelled as she stuck her tongue at him.
Steve stared down at the half emptied bottle. To learn that Toni was captured tested him. Not only did it scare him, it angered him. How could she go with the 107 into the battlefield? How could she be that stupid? She must've known that she would be captured? Or did she do it knowing that he would save her? Did she have that much faith in him? Whatever the case, he didn't want to feel like that again, though it couldn't compare to how he felt when he saw her falling from the sky. "I don't know. Maybe, she was looking for a way back."
"You better believe it," she grinned.
"That's not the answer I wanted to hear."
"Let's get this under way!" Clint's yelled as he jumped over the back of one of the large sofas in the lunge. He landed heavily on the overstuff pillows. "I have places to be. People to see."
"The Colonel doesn't want you to be alone. And Carter and Rogers are worried about you…for good reason," Howard stated, kneeing in front of her. "You did
Bruce smiled, weakly. "You're never on the sidelines. Just taking a break like we all need to do."
She thought, wishing her suit was closer. Why didn't she build a portable device that would allow JARVIS to take over any building in a matter of seconds? "She should've done it sooner. Maybe, I should call her and give her a shoulder to celebrate on."
"You're no fun, Salty," she stated with a frown.
Steve chuckled. "Well, I guess there were a lot of soulless people in the 1940's."
"She did," he stated, still eyeing her from the corner of his eyes. "She knew you needed to talk and you wouldn't talk to her." He placed his hand on her shoulder, stopping her. She didn't fight him, but it was clear that she had no interest in talking. "You've been through a lot. You need to let it out."
"And you can't tell anyone, because you know they wouldn't understand," she said slowly. "So you hide it, because no one should be burdened with it. Besides who would want to know anyhow?" She glanced back to the box. She acted the way she did, not wanting anyone to see how broken she was. "Maybe, if I act happy, I would really be happy." She said, slowly and softly.
Shaking her head, Toni picked up her head, and with an unsteady hand, she tried Bruce. He would surely pick up? Right? They were science buddies! But, she had no luck and his phone went straight to voice mail. "Fuck."
Steve just grinned, as he placed another kiss to the top of her head. His lips lingered as he pulled her closer. "The floor more likely. I can do the floor. The floor isn't bad. Sometimes I like it better."
she protested in her mind as she turned from him.
"Better be careful, Stark. It might bite," she stated, noticing him reach a metal arm toward the core. Before continuing down the steps, she took a deep breath, and it wasn't until she was at the bottom of the stairs that she spoke again. "You might hurt yourself." She stood a good few feet back. There was no doubt that thing would bite if it was made from the Tesseract.
"I don't blame you for this?" She said, softly, as she waved her bruised wrist at him. With a light brown leather jacket, the wrist was hidden from prying eyes.
Though no matter the outcome, she wasn't any closer to getting home, because she needed more than one minute worth of power, and she had no idea of how to get that. Her father and the Colonel had supplied her with a power source, but it wasn't enough. She needed more. She was unsure of where to get that power.
There's no doubt to that, and Tony has chills thinking about it. He hates to see the damage those two can cause together. However, he can't be upstairs, not with Barnes and Rogers. "…I can't," he says slowly.
Fighting the soreness in her legs, Toni took off after him, but it was clear right away that she would never be able to keep up with him. As the distance between them grew, Toni was amazed at his speed, and she knew it was hopeless to keep chasing after him, not in her state, but she refused to give up. It wasn't in her DNA to give up. Her father would be kicking in his grave if she did. "Where's my suit?" she asked, glancing up toward the sky. There was nothing in the night sky—well anything that she could see, and the rain didn't help, pelting her in the eyes.
"Nothin'. I'm just a kid from Brooklyn," Steve replied with a smile.
There were a million things going through Toni's head, and JARVIS was the center of them. No one had any idea of how much the suit meant to the genius, even if they thought they did. No matter what they said, no one understood how much JARVIS meant to her—what he was to her, and there was no explaining it to it either. There weren't words to describe what or
Toni knew that was the norm for this time, but it annoyed her. "Oh, I see. So you can be-what do they call it now?-a Lounge Lizard or a horny dog, but I can't?"
Natasha was sitting at the communication station, typing away, but she was also keeping a close eye on the Captain. She hadn't spoken a word in the last hour or so, and it was clear that she wouldn't be saying anything soon, though she was interested in their conversion. Her eyes were flicking between Steve and the monitor even time he spoke.
"No," he growls. "If he needs a talking down, he can talk to his nurse,
"No," she snapped. Why were they pushing her? Why was it so important that she picked? Why couldn't she have both? Did she really want both? She wasn't sure. She really wasn't sure, but all she knew was that she wanted to get away, far away, as she didn't want to answer them. "Just shut up!"
For the next few minutes, Steve remained beside her until she was quiet. Bucky was the first one to leave, as this was not his area and he felt uncomfortable. After leaving her side, Steve lingered in the doorway watching her. He wanted to make sure she was okay, before he left her. After a few silent minutes, Steve exited the room even if he was still worried.
Clint pushed those thoughts aside, noticing blood in several places. Judging from the crash and the distance from Toni's prints, the blood was from one source, and considering how graceful the pursuer was, the blood was Toni's, which boiled Barton's insides. He had lived a long life, seen things that would make people shudder. He had done things to bloody his hands, things that he could never wash away. Did things that he was ashamed off, and because of that, he put up shields like most people do. Stark was known for that; Rogers was too, but he denied it more than anyone. That aside, he was fucken pissed. His shields be damned. There were only a small number of people that Barton would burn the world down for. He could count them on one hand: Nat, the first person he truly cared for; Laura, his
Rumlow looked back from the front seat. A smile on his face. "Rollins has Miss future Rogers. He's taking her to one of many the SHIELD Labs to fix up that suit of hers. She's safe, Big Guy. We wouldn't let anything happen to her."
From there, it seemed like everything kicked into hyper drive and that time was slipping away. Toni had been waiting for this moment for such a long time that she hadn't thought that she would see the day. However, now that it was here, it felt like a dream. Was this really happening? Was this all some kind of nightmare? If it was, she was going to shit herself and never going to watch TV before bed again.
"Toni."
"Is everything okay over here?" Barnes asked as he came running over from somewhere. He angrily eyed the unnamed solder.
Something in side of Toni was telling her that these two could be good friend if they kept in contact. Just listening to these two told her that much. Would it be too much if she set up play dates for these two? What? Steve needed some non-spy friends. But first, she needed to run a thorough background on this man, because he could
"O' really. Shit," he said. "That's my worst nightmare."
Toni turned toward Rogers, who was wearing a large smile. That smiled warmed her up, unlike what Barnes' smile did to her. Barnes made her feel hot, while Rogers made her feel safe, even if he couldn't really protect her at this time. She loved that feeling, but she didn't want to admit that. Shaking her head, she turned to the table. I wanted to avoid this, she thought to herself. She didn't want to get close enough to him to make an impression.
But with Barnes, it seems like he wants Tony to like him, though Tony has no idea why this is so important. Why does it matters? What does it change? What good does it do? Again, Tony isn't sure, but Barnes is, which is why he keeps coming down to the lab. He remembers the first time the former assassin came down to see him. He didn't say one single word the whole entire time. He just dropped the food off, stared at Tony for a few seconds like he had wanted to say something but couldn't, and left without a word.
"It's fine, Cap," she said, annoyed. He wasn't her parent, and he didn't need to treat her as a child.
Steve had no idea of what was going on or where the hell he was. First, he woke up in a fake room which couldn't hold a regular officer, let alone a super soldier. Second, the building that he was held in didn't look like any kind of building that he had ever seen. It was all futuristic. Thirdly, when he walked out of building and onto the streets, he had no idea of where he was. Sure, he recognized streets signs and he knew he was in New York, but this didn't look like the city he had grown up in. There were so many flashing lights and movie screens displaying ads at a rapid pace, which he didn't even think was possible. How was that possible?
Pepper crossed back to the closet and pulled an article of clothing off the hanger. She folded it as she walked back to the suitcase on the ground. "There's nothing to talk about," she replied, quickly. "We're leaving now. Do hear me, Toni?"
"That might be interesting to watch," Tony states as he straightens himself up. "Can I video type that?"
*O*O*
*O*O*
With a sigh, Toni took a deep breath as she picked up her head and rested it on her hands. She stared at the wall, trying to will herself to think of something else – something positive, or as positive as it got when the world was at war and Toni being suffocated with guilt over what she could have, should have done. Staring, her eyes had started to drift, but she was startled back awake as she heard someone behind her. She flinched stiffly, when she felt a hand on her shoulder, almost falling out of her chair. "Shit," she curse, trying to regain her balance.
Closing her eyes, she cleared her mind and focused on the task at hand. She needed to study Stark Industries for a way in. There were high fences around the complex and security guards that walked up and down the fence every few seconds. Though she couldn't tell from here, she knew there had to be cameras, so even if the guards missed something, the guys monitoring the cameras would not. There was only one way into the lot, and that was through a single check point. Each employee was required to have their badge before entering, and if the guards wanted to, they were able to search the vehicle without cause. They seemed to search them all though, but she spotted the one time the car was not. The guy who drove in must've been trusted.
Steve froze for a second before he turned around. His eyes widened at the sight of an elderly Gabe and Dum Dum in the doorway. For a second, he just stared at his former comrades, shock at their appearance. Even if he had seen them after he had awaken from the ice, it was still a sight to see. "Gabe, Dum Dum," he said, forcing a smile to his face. "When did you get here? How did you get here?" He asked as he stepped toward them.
"So you know about that, do you?" he said, letting out of Toni's face. He stepped back from her and crossed to the tool that Loki was playing with earlier.
"Toni," Steve suddenly uttered, breaking her out of her thoughts. "I got you," he said, pulling her into his arms. "I got you, and I'm not going anywhere." The genius nodded against his chest as she fisted his shirt, unwilling to let go. She needed him. She needed him to be her anchor. She needed it more than she needed air. "I got you, Toni. I got you."
*O*O*
"Is it fixable?" he asked, still eyeing Toni, who had rested her head on the table. I wonder what she's thinking about, he thought. She was probably thinking of a plan to escape but there was no way that she could. This facility was impossible to escape.
"Why you, bitch," he cursed as he got to his feet. "I'll teach you to-"
The image of Peggy and Rogers kissing replayed in her head, and Toni couldn't help but think they belonged together. It probably wouldn't happened if Toni didn't time traveled to the past. They probably would've done more than just kiss if she wasn't there. They might've been something, if she didn't ruin it, which was what she did. Toni always seemed to ruin something, just by looking at it.
"Not unbelievable," Maria Hill replied, stepping into the room. Like Natasha, a stoic expression rested on her face. "It was only going to be a matter of time before someone else made their own super soldier."
Without much thought, she swung her good arm, but he caught it easy and pinned it above her head. "It won't be that easy." There was a hint of laugher in his voice. "No lady can best me."
"Fury must've missed one," he said while huffing. Maybe, he did it on purpose, but why would he do that? Maybe, Fury knew how affected he would be by it; however, that didn't make sense. No one knew how he felt about her. No one besides Philips. If he did know, Steve didn't know what the reason would be, but he would ask the Director about it.
She didn't answer right away, only cuddling closer to Steve if that was possible. Even with his super strength, it was a struggle not to fall into bed with her, not that he didn't want to do. "I told JARVIS to take me home."
Until next time.
Toni thought she handled the Colonel well, and she knew she had annoyed him, which she smiled about. She didn't know if he would come back or if he would send someone else in. If Howard walked through the door and she had to speak to him, she didn't know if she could handle it without turning to violence. She didn't know if she would be angry or spineless, which was normal for her. He had a presence that could tear anyone one down. He wasn't always like that, she thought. It was a long time ago and it was hard to remember, but he was a nice loving father. She blamed the change on Maria's death.
"Yea, you have your own personal chief!" Wilson mocks.
Barton was looking between Rogers and Stark, eyeing the physical contact between the two. Even without the physical contact, it was clear to all that there had been a change between the two, and that picture of them kissing sealed it. "I don't know if I can handle those two together," he said, whispering to Banner in a chuckle.
Getting over the shook of Toni just walking away from him, it took Barnes a few seconds for him to catch up to her. "Geez, slow down," he stated, giving her a smile again. "You don't have to be so scared."
Why did they have to talk about
"Erskine's going to pick Steve Rogers for the Super Soldier Project," she revealed, not knowing what else she could do. She knew she was risking everything, but she needed him to believe her.
the AI was to her, as he was one of the few things that would always be there. JARVIS would be there for her no matter what she did or happened, and that couldn't be said about anyone else…well besides Jarvis, the namesake of the AI.
Toni was taken back as she had totally forgotten about him finding her. She thought she had been seeing things when she was found in that empty lot. "That was you? That must've been an ugly sight." Without thinking, she reached her hand to cut on her forehead. The good thing about being out for a week was that most of her nicks and scratches were healed. The slash on her forehead was mostly healed with a small band aid covering it.
"I've been worse," Tony says, cutting her off. He doesn't want or need to hear the list of his injuries from her, not that he doesn't believe her; he just doesn't want to think about it at the moment. He doesn't want to think or look at the heavy, thick, black boot on his foot, and he wants to pretend the cast on his arm isn't there. He wants to ignore his injuries completely. He just wants to go back… Besides, FRIDAY could and will scan him later to tell him the full extent of his injures. With his AI, he doesn't have to worry about someone over or under selling his injuries; plus, he just wants this conversion over with as soon as possible, as he doesn't want to be in this room with the Brooklyn Twins waiting on the other side of the door. He doesn't want their fake pity or worry, which is all it is. He doesn't want them to stay with him out of some kind of honor. He isn't a charity chase. "Just let me out of this hell hole."
Shaking his head, Bruce took a deep look at the video. JARVIS wasn't going to admit that there had been an issue with the footage; Toni must've programed some stubbornness into the AI. Bruce picked up the tablet and watched the footage again. He watched it a few times before he noticed the clock on the desk that Toni kept changing. "Why did she keep changing the clock?" he asked himself. Plus, it also wasn't jumping.
Vous êtes instruit, contrairement au reste de ces hommes : You're educated unlike the rest of these men.
*O*O*
"That or you had firsthand knowledge of the lab," Howard answered.
"Toni," Steve uttered, trying to control his blush. There was a soft warning on his voice.
However whenever he closed his eyes, the flashbacks came flooding.
Steve took a deep breath as he gave in and finally pulled her into his arms. "I won't let them do that," he said into her hair line, as he held her close. "I won't."
Steve let out a sigh from next to her as he eyed Romanoff manhandling the reporter. "You'll be deleting those photos," the assassin ordered. "Deleting them, now!"
The Super Soldier was still in his navy Captain America suit with his shield on his back. This uniform was one of the most comfortable that he ever wore, but he missed the red, white, and blue. He missed what it stood for. Sure, he still stood for the same thing, but it felt distance in this. He felt different. "I'm going to find Toni."
"She will be," another voice responded.
she thought to herself.
Dugan shook his head as he stepped away. "Not in public. People already think I'm a crazy old man, which I am, and many not believe it if they hear but they don't need to hear this," he said, leading Steve down a long hallway. It was a lengthy, painfully slow walk for both of them: for Dugan, his weak, old bones ached with each movement. His cane could barely support his weight, but he refused to sit.
The Colonel crossed to the files on the table and pretended, which Toni could tell even from a few feet away, to look through them. "I see you and Sergeant Barnes are getting along."
However, that good feeling didn't last long as she groaned, trying to open her eyes. It was too painful to move and her eye felt like it was fire. Her left side of her face where Skully had hit her felt huge and she could barely feel that side of her face. "Asshole," she muttered as she imagined what she looked like. She probably looked like a balloon and Peggy was probably going to mock her. She groaned in pain again as she tried to roll.
Steve gave her a confused look. "Toni, this isn't your home," he replied, pushing the hair out of her face.
When Carter and Phillips arrived at the labs, they found Dr. Erskine speaking with Howard Stark. Toni's device laid on the table opened with wires attached to it, and each wire was burnt. Tools were spread around table as Howard couldn't locate the tool he wanted. Erskine was staring at blueprints that Howard had drawn up, trying to figure out what the device was supposed to.
"I can feel your angst from-"
"My Mother, she…" he started slowly, pausing for a second. "I was a sappy child growing up. Always fantasizing as I was too sick or small to play with others. Everyone teased me, including Bucky, but he did playfully it and threatened everyone else who did."
The genius put the larger fatter one under her arm, trying to hide her chills, before she took the second. It was much thinner, and Toni thought for a second that it was empty. "What is this?" she asked, looking inside.
"Nope."
Toni smiled evilly, having a few ideas in mind. All of these ideas involved getting this man to smile, because damn, his smile was the answer to everything, and if anyone disagreed, she would slap them in the face. If she could stare in his eyes for the foreseeable future, Toni would be a happy woman. Looking into his eyes, she was filled with so many different emotions, and she could only see love in his eyes. No matter how many times she stared into his eyes, she couldn't get enough of that. "Now, Stevie. If you can't handle the crazy, you probably shouldn't be in the-"
"Well, have fun with that," she waved at him as she pushed off the wall.
*O*O*
Even worse, he expected her to have kids. Her children? One, she had no idea at all of what to do with them, and two, she would probably kill them on accident. How did one even feed a baby? Then there were diapers. Seriously, her with kids? Who the hell was her father kidding? Wait, her father didn't raise her as he left her to nanny, which was another sign that Toni would be a horrible parent. She was just like her father.
Pardon me for my French. I am not good at languages. Only took Spanish and I didn't do so well.
And, that was the scary part, not knowing if something was real. She couldn't trust herself, and she
"B…b-bit…" She could barely make out her own words.
She shook her head. "Toni, keep focus." Rogers had always said that she got distracted way too easily, and she would yell at him each time he said it, but now, she guessed he was right. She glanced around the room before rounding the corner, which brought the rest of the small apartment into view. To her joy, she didn't see anyone, which was weird. Why would anyone leave a stranger alone in their home? That was just stupid. "Idiots."
Bruce jolted up from his seat as he stared wide eye at Barton before he turned to the CEO. "What?!"
"Crap," Natasha cursed.
, and there wasn't anyone who could beat her on her best day, well besides herself. She could destroy herself in seconds, she was doing lately. "No, she isn't dead, and I'm not giving up on her."
Jim isn't one to back down even when he's facing two Super Soldiers. "No," he declares, strongly.
Steve flashed in her mind for a brief second, but that was all she needed. It kicked her back into the driver seat, back into action. With someone to fight for, she knew she had to get out of here or else. She needed to get away, but nothing was working: her body, her suit.
The Genius is happy, truly happy, and he's glad—for once—that Wanda forced him into something that he didn't want to do. He wouldn't be here with these men if it wasn't for her pushing. Yes, Steve, Bucky, and he have things to work out, but Tony has learned something this past week. He has learned that honest is the most important thing in this relationship, and if he wants this to work—which he does, he needs to be open and honest with his partners. He needs to tell them about his insecurities that his father had planted in his head. He needs to tell them what he's feeling.
And he's this close to saying those three words, even if their presence in his mind still scares the shit out of him. He doesn't know what stops him from saying the words, but he doesn't, even when they're smiling at him. He doesn't say anything as he looks between them. He can see—or thinks he sees- the fondness in their eyes, and though they don't say those words to him either, he wonders if that fondness in their eyes is love. He hopes so.
*O*O*
"I only threw the wrench at him," she paused, "though, I almost threw a screwdriver at him." Salty gave her a look at hearing that. "Don't look at me like that! He so deserved it. He's an ass. How can anyone stand him and that planet size ego," she explained, shaking her head.
"Keep dreaming," Toni yelled, kicking at the Commander, who only laughed.
Unmuting his comm, Tony says, "I got the Civilians in the building and an idea of how to shut these things down for good. Friday is sending it to you now. Vision should be able to disrupt the frequency, while rest of you take them out."
Though he hated how sexual this time was, he couldn't help but stare at the picture. Toni was breath taking; her body, including the reactor, was perfect. Although he cared for more than just the body, he found himself desiring to touch her; he closed his eyes for a few seconds as he tried to clear his mind. He just wished that everyone else couldn't or hadn't seen her so exposed. He knew it was a completely different time and sex wasn't a taboo, but still. He did
. She was far from perfect, but she cared while Maya felt nothing. "I'm telling you it isn't!" Toni snapped, struggling against the restraints "I'm on the street. I'm seeing it; people are going 'bang' and painting the walls. Maya, you're kidding yourself, like always."
She shuddered just thinking about it. "First of all, there's no way in hell that Thor will ever let you out of that cell. Two, I'm stuck in the past, and three, there's no way in hell that I would even consider sleeping with you, asshole. You are not worthy of this body."
Toni got down on her knees and opened the pack on her back. "If Stark's correct, it shouldn't take me too long," she replied as she pulled out some tools. With a screwdriver in her hand, she crawled under the control board and removed one of the hard panel coverings. She needed to get to the wires if she wanted to hack into the system. Unlike future technology, there was no USB ports that she could plug into. A minute later, she was able to find the two wires that she needed. After to exposing the wires, she took out the same device from before and popped open the top. She took out two wires and split them so she could connect the wires to the control panel. After assuring the connection, she watched the device lit up, but it beeped a few times as the device struggled to make it through the fire walls.
"JARVIS," she called, trying to force everything out of her mind.
that felt. Struggling to take a deep breath, she rejected the idea of the Tower as home. The Tower was where she lived, but when she thought of home, the tower wasn't it. The Tower felt empty. When JARVIS said the Tower, it felt like she was punched in the stomach, letting the air out of her. Surprising even her, she wanted to go nowhere else. "Take me to Steve, take me home."
"Again?" Steve uttered, softly, as he eyed her.
"Pep," she called, wrapping her arms around the CEO. "It's fine. I'm back."
"Geez, Stark only thinking about yourself."
*O*O*
"Don't hold your breath," Steve countered. It was true that he didn't see the world like Fury did. He saw the world as it should be. He saw the world as something that should be protected. Fury, on the other hand, saw it as broken, something that needed to be beaten into submission. He expected the worse, saw the worse. Steve understood the need to be ready, but he didn't want to see the world like that. He wanted to see it as good.
He smiled at her with an annoying grin. "We meet again." Toni raised her eyebrow. "I guess… the first time didn't count as you were unconscious."
"Oh, Stevie's in love," Clint mocked with a goofy smile on his face.
Just as he turns to go upstairs, he spots an empty plate on one of the work benches. His heart beats rapidly as his chest feels tighten at the sight of it. "He didn't come down today," he utters. The dish is from yesterday when Barnes came down with a plate of Chicken Penne. He isn't sure why it stings so much that he didn't come down today, but he knows it's for a best. He doesn't need to get attached to Barnes, not that he isn't already. That Stupid Soldier fought his way into his damn heart to join Rogers, and that annoys him. He isn't some teenager who falls in lo—nope not love. He does not love, but he isn't some person who falls for someone simply because he or she takes care of him.
"I'll leave you all be then," Steve stated. He was standing very stiff.
Toni glared. "Then why am I here? You should-"
Colonel Phillips didn't know what he thought about the woman with no last name, but he knew he didn't trust the shit she was spouting. There was something odd about that woman and he was going to find out what it was. He didn't know what he was going to do just yet as he didn't want to hurt her. It went against his core to interrogate a lady with force, and no matter how much Toni pissed him off, he wasn't going to.
Toni looked at him expecting some kind of anger, but there wasn't any. "Yes," she said, closing her eyes as she couldn't take looking at the Colonel. After a few seconds of silence, she added, "Going to yell at me? Calling me heartless? Can't be any worse than what I call myself. I'm a heartless bitch, I know."
please don't do this," she cried desperately, on the verge of hysteria.
"Save it, Rogers," Toni said, interrupting him. Of all the things she wanted to talk about, that kiss wasn't one of them. That was the last thing she wanted to talk about because it wasn't as if that kiss meant anything anyways. He was hurting and needed comfort, which Toni didn't blame him for. "It's fine. It meant nothing. I understand. Now that's over with, are we done?"
Toni squeezed her eyes shut and forced herself to take a deep breath. She knew she was completely exhausted but she needed to found some hidden energy. She needed to figure out what was going on and how to get out of here. "F-fuck," she cursed as her head fell to the side. She groaned lightly, grateful that the sun was no longer directly in her eyes.
There were too many people in her tower, and she didn't know how to deal with everyone at once, especially now. She should've listened to Steve, but she thought she could handle it. She thought she could handle her emotions, but she was wrong, and it annoyed her. It annoyed her how weak she was. Really, she couldn't handle her own emotions? What kind of person was that? She was Iron Man for crying loud.
Toni glanced to Steve for help, and their eyes met, but Steve didn't make any movement. He just smiled at her like the traitor that he was. If they're dating, then it was requirement for him to come to her aid whenever she needed it, and she needed it now. "I t-think I'll be the f-first one to die from hugs," she said. Her voice muffled in Pepper's chest.
*O*O*
"Pick what?" She asked, bolting up and out of Rogers' grip. She stared at the two of them, confused.
Steve didn't know what to say to that. How could that be true? Was it something to do with the Serum? He didn't know, but it all too much for him to take. He closed his eyes as he tried to block out the world around him. It had to be true, right? That was only one thing that could explain what was going on around him.
Toni gave him a look as she stepped away from the door. "You're just trying to keep me busy." She knew what he was doing and she didn't care for it. She wasn't a child who needed to be watched.
His hands ball at his side as he crosses to his suit, which opens for him automatically. "Oh, you don't?" he asks, his voice stained. He really, really wants her out of his head.
Rogers turned to her. "Sometimes the world needs a symbol," he stated. "I guess you wouldn't understand." He glared at her for a few seconds before turning away.
"You will thank me in the morning," he said, as he slid the shirt down and passed her head. He helped her put her arms in the sleeves as he pulled it down, grazing her chest. Toni groaned in respond as Steve continued to lower the shirt over her stomach. "Oh, you will," he said, turning his attention to her pants, still wet. He leaned forward, reaching for the top of her pants.
"Not a hard choice. I'm tired of not waking up to you, and we need each other. Plus, I'm thinking about the Avengers. I like the idea of us being separated from SHIELD. We can do more good. Help more people."
"What about the others? Are you planning a rescue mission?" Rogers asked.
She turned from him, staring down at her hands. "I hated you for that," she said, after a few deep breaths. "I hated you for being so damn perfect, and I hated that my father cared more for your legacy then his own daughter. When I was a child, it was all about the great Captain America, and I hated that. I hated you. I hated that I couldn't get my father's attention like a dead icon could. For that, I wanted to tear you down just to do it. I wanted to anger you, to bring you down to my level. I wanted you to feel what I felt."
After few long minutes of Toni trying to get the Howling Commandos and Trip to leave, they finally left, and for a while, she just watched as they walked away. She was annoyed at their slow pace, but she knew there was nothing that she could do and she was angry for nothing. Dugan and Jones were allowed to be slow in their old age, but it was painful to watch how slow they were, when she could remember them so young.
"Toni."
Cardiac arrest? Flat-lined? She died? "What?!" Toni didn't remember any of that.
"Never piss off the doctor. Never know what I might stick you with," Cho replies, as she scans him with one of her medical devices. "And it doesn't hurt that Natasha is standing guard. No one wants to piss her off. I mean no one… Are the rumors true about her?" she asks, giving him a look. She's being serious.
"How can you get sick of my face? And my face is not ugly. It's a face of a god," he joked, as he sat on the top of one of the lab tables. In his hands, he played with a metal, torture tool, which looked like some kind of scoop.
to keep busy," she replied. If she stopped, her guilt would come back in ten folds, and she couldn't handle that.
Shaking his head, he crossed to the mirror in the room and stared into it. He could see why everyone was worried about him; he looked like shit. He looked totally exhausted with those huge bags under his eyes; plus, he was still covered in mud and sweat. "Rogers, you look like shit," he told himself as he turned away from the mirror.
Toni glared at him, knowing that she wouldn't be able to last another round of torture. "It's not going to change anything. I will never help you, Skully," she said.
Toni let out a small laugh. Barnes knew how to make her laugh even if he was an unbearable flirt. "You're something else." She pushed him off and this time, he let go. "I'm going to go now."
"Sergeant Barnes sounds panicked. It might be wised to-"
Having been close with Peggy (close enough to call her Aunt Peg), Toni had met the famous Sharon on more than one occasion. Even when she wasn't there, Peggy could go on and on about her wonderful niece. Whenever Sharon was in town, she would tag along with Peggy, and to Toni's annoyance, this included visits to see Howard and her. Now, Peggy and Howard thought they could force them together, thinking it would be adorable if they were friends. However, they hated each other, seeing the other as a spoil brat who needed a good punch in the face. "What you are going here?"
Toni thought. She needed to get out, away from everything, but she knew she couldn't just leave. She had to get her reactor checked, because it might life and death if it malfunctioned.
"Won't be too hard, since she's already heading there. She just needs a push."
"I can agree with that," Bruce said, finally resting his arms on Natasha's legs.
Toni closed her eyes, no longer able to hear any more yelling; however, she knew it wasn't going to last once she entered the room. She wasn't sure what her reception will be, considering everything that had happened. One being: she had ejected Rhodes from the Suit. She was regretted it now. Her best friend, her oldest friend, could've been killed because she was being childish. She was being stupid and put him in danger for no reason. He could be injured, and it could be her fault. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Why had she been so stupid?
Toni took a deep breath. She could see that he was exhausted. "Why don't you go to bed in your room?" she asked as she reached to him to help him up. She had no idea how long he had been asleep at the bathroom door. If she wasn't annoyed at him for his gentlemen qualities, she would hug him or something. He was so cute and adorable at this size.
Steve shook his head. "Toni."
However, before anyone could speak, a sensor went off. On one of the monitor, they found the Tesseract and there was no time waste. There was no telling what they were planning. The monitor kept beeping and flashing, which Toni took as her clue. She jumped into action before anyone had a plan, which irritated Steve. Did she not think before she acted? Was she always this reckless and stupid? Did she think of anyone else but herself?
"Sorry, no peaches," he said.
JAVIS didn't answer right away. "Miss Stark is in need of Captain Rogers' presence, and as I am programed to serve her every need, I am retrieving him for her."
"Nope, I admit nothing," Toni said, quickly. "However, that's was why Fury never let me join his super-secret boy band." She said, still not looking up. She hadn't meant to tell Peggy the truth; it just came right out in her frustration.
Toni narrowed her eyes. "If was a bomb, I wouldn't just have got a broken arm." Though her memory of that night was hazy, she wouldn't describe it as an explosion. There wasn't a hole in the ground. There wasn't anything in pieces besides the pieces from her time. Everything just looked like it fell from a great height. Either way, how was she even alive? "And it wasn't like I did it on purpose," she stated. She didn't even know how she did it.
Exhaling, she forced herself to think about Steve and not her nightmares that plagued her. As she rounded a corner in the alley, she saw the asshole that was beating up Steve, and she saw red. He had Steve by the collar against the wall. "Hey, asshole, get your stinking hands off him," she demanded.
Her head bobbed back, resting against his shoulder. The fabric of his uniform rubbed against her face, itching, but she had no energy to adjust. It was a battle to keep her eyes open as the man held her tight. She kept telling herself that she had to stay awake that something was off about him. She had to figure out who this man was, but her brain didn't want to function.
She closed her eyes and held on to him. "I remember. You were my shrimp."
*O*O*
But she was Toni Fucking Stark, and there was no doubt that she could survive an apocalypse. She could just hover above them in her Iron Man Suit and killing them all from a safe distance. Besides, they couldn't get through her suit, even if they did get to her. And if by some change that they got into the tower—not possible in any reality-, JARVIS would cook their asses. No, really cook them. Granted, that wasn't a cookout that Toni wanted to be invited to, let alone smell.
"Manners? Who needs manners?" she asked cutting him off, as she pushed the plate away. The plate had been licked cleaned, no really licked clean. Toni didn't normally lick plates but the look on Salty's face was priceless and she would do it again just to see it. He stared at her, rubbing his forehead in disbelief. "All gone."
"I wasn't going to do anything," she replied, quickly. However, she could tell he was not buying it at all with that look of his. "I'm not." She wasn't sure yet if that was a lie or not.
Somehow, the man looked angrier, ready to burst. "People are concerned about you, Toni. I'm concerned about you," he said, loudly. Hurt tones found their way into his voice, mixing into his anger. "And you find this is a joke."
"Agent Carter co-ordinate with MI6," Colonel Phillips stated as he leaned over the table.
Toni walked into the apartment to find Rogers on the couch with a depressed look on his face. "You tried to enlist again, didn't you?" she asked as she took a seat next to him.
"Well, I'm always trouble."
At this point, Toni didn't care if she spilled the beans; she just wanted her to shut up. "The future."
relax. We're sending a mass murderer to try and save Stark," he explained, switching to Toni's last name. He didn't feel comfortable saying her first name in front Romanoff. Heck, he didn't feel comfortable saying in front of anyone; he himself could hear how emotional he was when he said her name, which was reason why he stuck to saying Stark. They didn't need to see how emotional he was.
"Why would I leave such a pretty dame alone?" he asked as he put an arm around her. "We could go out. Why would you want to be around a guy like that?"
Anyhow, back to the story on hand. I thought I would give you some warning for this chapter. Nothing to major, but there is some talk of suicide. Or rather, one character telling another character to kill herself. No is no attempt but I figure I give you guys the warming.
"Geez, Rogers," Clint uttered as he popped the bulb up in the air like a ball. "Can't say anything in front of Stark's white knight, can I?"
*O*O*
"Didn't know what we would find," he replied, as he looked up and glanced around. "Have to be ready for anything."
Toni's eyes widened at the sound of Steve's voice and the sound of him getting his ass beat. It pissed her the hell off that someone was beating up Steve, the Shrimp. Why would someone beat him up? He was small and not a threat in anyway. Using her anger, she looked forward and pushed herself forward. Her heat beat rapidly.
3) And poor Toni. Hydra is having their way with her away. How long do you think it will be before they break it?
