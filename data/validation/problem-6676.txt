“None of that,” Steve chastised. “Put on that cock ring before you start having a little too much fun with yourself.”
Tony heard the challenge in Steve’s suggestion, and Tony forced himself to loosen his grip. “This isn’t my first time shooting across the sky. Lead the way, Professor.”
“Steve?” Tony asked, not moving and voice so soft it was barely like he spoke at all, but it was enough to remind Steve where they were and why.
Steve slipped his hand into his pocket, making the vibrations stop. Tony gasped, both missing the sensation that had tortured him for hours and almost certain he wouldn’t be able to move a muscle for a long while. But then Steve leaned back from his cock, tongue coming out to lick his abused lips. Tony wanted to reach out, could see the bulge in Steve’s pants that begged for his attention.
Next to him, Tony stretched and groaned, sheets sliding down to his waist when he sat up and wiped his eyes with the side of his hand. “Good to not see you on the floor this morning.”
“Artificial knotting.” Tony walked away, towards the next bookshelf over. He slid his fingers and pulled out a book, tossed it over to Steve without warning. He caught it anyway and in his hand he read that it was a book about the exam. “Since you seem so interested,” Tony sneered.
“Fascinating,” Tony said, more focused on the pads and mats leaning against the wall than Anthony’s reply. His eye hit a bit of metal shining in the light and between two mats was the metal curve of a shield. It wasn’t painted but it had the same spherical indentions, the same star in the middle.
They’d gone to battle together before, Tony couldn’t even count how many times; but this was the first time they’d gone into battle since Bucky had kissed him. Smoke billowed overhead, the debris of the fight all around him, the stench of a charred car almost enough to derail him from his single-minded focus: he needed to find Bucky.
Bucky chuckled under his breath, soft and wistful. “Says the kid who used to freeze under a warm breeze.”
Later that afternoon, when he slid on the mask on in abandoned alley three blocks from Stark Tower, he thought of Coulson’s piercing gaze and felt a twinge of guilt from his theft. But none of it was enough to thwart his plan. He was going to find Tony again.
He hadn’t even made it back to his apartment and Tony had messaged him. Steve imagined him silently standing on the other side of the door, eye pressed to the peephole, watching Steve.
Space travel felt like being on a submarine. The only safe place was inside the ship, and sometimes inside felt less than friendly as well. Tony kept avoiding Steve's gaze, muttering under his breath, and using the suit to fly around the ship despite the gravity pressurizing.
Tony sighed, squeezing his eyes shut and taking a deep breath. Then another. Then another. Scenting Steve, Tony’s shoulders lost a bit of their strain. Before Steve’s eyes, Tony used his scent to calm down and he’d never purred before but the bubbling in his chest felt like the beginning of it. He cleared his throat and it brought Tony’s wide brown his to him. “Lose to me in chess?” Tony whispered.
The omega had wandered over to a window, looking at the suited mannequins and Steve could see his blank expression.
Steve dunked his head underwater and started to swim some laps, needing to clear his head. Between breaststrokes he heard a splash and knew it was Tony jumping into the pool. Out of the corner of his eye, Steve watched him join Thor and Clint in their game.
The alpha had a firm hold on his arm, though and by the time Steve thought of something to say, something involving the authorities and omegas' rights, the alpha was dragging the younger man down the street and out of sight.
“Right, yes,” he began, trying to find his words and push away the distracting sensation of his hard cock squeezed by the firm ring. With every shift on his seat the plug moved within him, and trying to pull up his latest creations was a feat he only managed to accomplish because this was not the first time they’d played this game. They both loved it, Steve at home, doing whatever domestic chore was on his to-do list today, all while sending Tony’s teasing images or erotic orders. His husband never lacked for imagination, and put his strategic and creative mind on ways to drive Tony insane.
“I’m bleeding from multiple places and if you make a loud noise, I’ll probably jump in the shower or attack you. But if you say so.” He turned his back back to Steve, but didn’t stop talking. “Hate helps me stay upright. Obadiah Stane betrayed me and my family. He told my mother he’d look out for me, he---” Tony broke off. “I’m going to break this fucking bond.”
“Well,” Tony leaned in close to Steve so the others couldn’t hear. “Pulling a Jimin doesn’t sound like getting kidnapped by shapeshifters, and none of them seem worried so--”
Or, they were all just fishing for intel and not showing their own hand. Steve disliked subterfuge, it was much easier to punch the enemy in front of you than play chess with them behind their back.
The clock on the far wall chimed three and they both stopped talking, hurrying to pick up the game. Stane would be back soon. Tony pushed in his chair, walking back to the chaise lounge with obvious discomfort. “Here,” Steve called, walking over to slide his arm around Tony’s waist and pull his arm over Steve’s shoulders. He helped him to chaise.
and then continued it when three more songs before the rest of the acts joined them for the final number. The earlier acts were taking the stage but BTS were sprawled over a pair of sofas and each other. It reminded Tony a bit of a pile of puppies that even Tony admitted looked adorable. It also helped with the security detail, because having them all in one place proved beneficial.
Steve was mumbling directions, instructions, and Tony took a step closer. He wondered what their diet was and if the shapeshifting happened amongst their own species, or maybe just around humans? He had so many--
Oh. Tony was being baited. He narrowed  his gaze, running a few quick calculations before picking up his phone and pressing the button that had FRIDAY shuffling around his schedule. “Make a left here.” Tony pointed at the Exit sign.
“So then how did it come to life--oh. My blood. I cut myself on it and it came to life right after it.”
It didn’t take long--the city wasn’t that large--before Tony heard a crash from the window at the far end of the hallway and a helmet came whizzing by, pulling the garland off the walls with the force of its speed. Steve reached out a hand and caught it easily, and an appreciative “damn” may have slipped out from under Tony’s breath, because Steve’s gaze flicked to him, one eyebrow raised before he slid on the helmet.
“It’s a long day. Only noon.” The tight pressure along the base of his cock centered Tony, his whole focus now on Steve, his cock under Steve’s control. “Think you can wait? Next call ends at two and I want to see you blissed out and begging, desperate to come.
Tony stayed with Steve as he stashed the shield in the closet the two K-pop stars had just occupied, doing a quick visual sweep of its empty interior. He looked at Tony from over his shoulder. “You don’t think….?”
SHIELD had set him up with an office when he first joined the organization. Steve found the sparse, white-walled space a general waste and had told Coulson as much; his place was on the field not in an office. But now, he was grateful. The office had a computer with a default password he’d never changed. It also connected directly to every file a Level 8 had access to. SHIELD had to have something on Stane, something they could use against him, something that he would want to keep private more than he wanted to keep Tony. Maybe if he willingly broke the bond--as much as blackmail was willing--Tony wouldn’t have to force a separation, they wouldn’t have to kill him.
Anthony rolled his eyes, and Tony chuckled at the familiar expression. “Let’s go find Professor Rogers.”
When Rhodey looked closer, he realized how much Tony had changed over the last few weeks; it must have had something to do with Steve. Tony had been less snappish, appeared better rested, better fed. He also looked two sheets to the wind, but not because of a morning cocktail.  Droopy and loose with pleasure--
Words kept coming out of Tony’s mouth, practiced and perfect, but he barely heard any of them. Instead he watched Steve fold his ankle over his leg, casual, but it allowed Tony to see so much more of him, his strong thighs stretching the fabric of his pants. His legs were spread wide enough that Tony could easily fill in the blanks, know intimately what was between Steve’s legs and how, if Steve did have plans, Tony might be able to watch their effects on Steve right there in the front row.
“That’s rich.” Tony’s words dripped with disdain, but Steve knew it wasn’t directed at him. “You’re the last person that needs to apologize for anything that’s going on back there.”
“Okay, Tony.” He leaned back on the bench, alone now, mind diving into all the things Tony might have planned. Kissing, touching, wherever and whenever. He wanted everything, everything Tony wanted.
The second Steve came through the door, he was all over Tony. Steve crowded him up against the wall, their feet tripping together. Tony felt hot breath against his neck and immediately spiraled down into the wonderful, hazy place where all that mattered was Steve.
Steve chuckled, dark and twisted with the thought of how he never knew of half the things his body would or could do since the serum. He shook his head. “Guess all that pleading and wishing and begging that went on inside my head caused something to change inside of me, something that allowed me to shoot up into the sky and save you.”
“I’m--” he cut himself off. Steve wasn’t doing this for himself, and he wasn’t going to argue against the position. “You’re right. He deserves better. I want to help. I told him, and now I’m showing him. He doesn’t need to take them, he can flush them down the toilet if he wants. But if he wants to take them, tell him that I can get him a pack for next month, or try to see if I can get a whole year's worth. If he wants. It’s available, now, with an alpha’s permission.”
“We’re going,” Tony said, pushing out of his seat in the middle of a duet. When Tony pulled him to his feet, the plug shifted again and Steve moaned, stopping mid-stride as he willed away his orgasm.
“It isn’t like that at all,” Anthony assured quickly; it was more than obvious that he didn’t want Professor Rogers thinking they were involved. After an awkward moment of silence, Anthony pulled out his wand and aimed it at Tony, who froze under it. Steve seemed surprised but not overly concerned.
His jaw dropped and Tony seemed to take it as excitement and not the frantic growing of panic souring his gut.
He promised he wouldn’t be rash. He promised Tony. So he counted the days, the minutes until it was Wednesday again.
He followed Tony’s instructions into the back room where a cage very similar to the one he’d seen in the other room sat at the side of the bed. Steve saw red and tore it apart without ever making a conscious decision to move across the room. This monster of a man, this hideous imposter of an alpha kept Tony confined, constrained. Tony, who sparked such light, who laughed and lit up a room without doing anything more than explaining something his genius created - - something majestic.
But when he looked up at Tony his book was promptly forgotten. The man dropped his jaw, looking just as surprised as Tony felt, to be face to face with the mirror image of himself.
“God, you’re so hot,” Tony kissed into his mouth, hand moving down Steve’s chest to slip under his pajama pants. “Want me to touch your cock?” he asked in a whisper, hand hovering over Steve’s length.
“What did you find out?” Tony asked, tone even, and Steve had to admire his bravery, throughout it all. Steve explained what Coulson said about illicit trade partners and suspicious activity around SI recently.
A day passed, then another, and Steve wasn’t going to make it. Next Wednesday was too far away. At night, Steve’s usual array of nightmares morphed, anxiety forcing them all to fixate on Stane. Stane shouting, Stane hitting him, Stane forcing his knot on Tony. He wasn’t going to be able to wait.
“Wanted a private show?” Tony was able to straighten after another deep breath and came around the podium to stand in front of Steve.
Tony pulled up next to him, wringing his hands as he watched Steve take in the room. He broke his hands apart and gestured towards the floor. “Personal artifacts of the Stark Family.”
“It could be,” Tony couldn't resist muttering under his breath, and he wished he had more self-control than he did when both of their accusatory glares pinned him to the spot. “Anyway! Yes, Anthony is right, I am a lost multiverse traveller, shot here through a soul piece and looking for something to shoot me back to my reality.”
Steve opened his mouth, then closed it again. He pressed his lips together, almost pointedly not looking towards the sky. When he finally spoke, it was tight, strained. “I guess there’s similarities and differences, between both worlds.”
He turned away, went to the sleeping clothes he’d used the evening before--the day had seemed impossibly long, and it was only the first--and the hardest part of this one wasn’t even over. Stepping behind a divider to change, he took a deep breath when he knew Tony couldn’t see him. Then he stepped back out to the hardest part: sharing a bed with Tony.
His bondmate would be there. Stane. Steve growled again. He hadn’t smelled him at first, the thick, citrusy smell of Tony’s slick overpowering the entire room. But near the hints of sourness was a thread of alpha, stifled by de-odorizer, but there. Tony would have had to react for Stane, during the exam, proof that he was fertile and suitable, and all sorts of archaic methods of alpha-based approval.
Tony’s face couldn’t hide his surprise, and Steve felt his wings shift behind him. It was starting to hit him that he had wings. He could
Tony’s head fell onto Steve’s shoulder as the ensemble sang on the stage below. “Yes, Steve. Please.”
The sun was starting to set when he finished the sketch. Looking at the building, he considered his chances but knew he was going to go inside anyway. He pulled the mask out of his bag and fixed it onto his face in the empty alley by the back door. The kitchen staff glanced his way but when it appeared like he knew where he was going, no one questioned him.
Tony pulled his t-shirt off, revealing smooth skin wrapped around tight muscle, and the web of scars that surrounded the arc reactor. Steve wanted to reach out and touch, but he wouldn’t. He wouldn’t touch, or move, or
“This is command to Galaxy9,” Operations said in Steve’s ear, and presumably Tony’s ear from the way that he also stopped talking. “T minus sixty seconds till take off.” Their eyes swung to one another, urgency underlining their glare this time.
Pepper wondered if Steve knew the responsibility behind the power he yielded. On the battlefield, yes, but what about off it…
Tony narrowed his eyes at Steve but Steve could see the amusement dancing at the corners of Tony’s mouth, at the way his hands had come over the back of the couch too, drawing lazy patterns up and down Steve’s chest, pulling the hem up to reveal a strip of his lower stomach, which Tony traced a finger over too. “I said, there’s been a mixup here.”
“But it could be anyone that they’d look at in the shapeshifters eyes, until they choose a new host,” Tony recalled from the briefing.
Tony sat up, leaning so that he could see James surface below. Water beaded over his face and chest, as he smiled up at Tony from under the bright afternoon sun. “Come on in,” he shouted.
Steve grinned apologetically and lifted his phone. “Looking for my sister’s work. Something Tower. Stork or--”
So did Stane. His hand shot out, fast and with a firm grip, based off the yelp Tony made, and before Steve could move to them, Stane whipped Tony behind his back and shouted at Steve, “You’re not supposed to be here!”
“....sure,” Tony replied. “In my world, my Steve uses it as a shield.” Tony may have imagined Professor Rogers’ breath catching at the word
“Steve!” Tony managed between laughs. “Stop!” He tried to push him away, down towards the foot of the bed–towards where he’d
Tony spun the ring between his fingers. The deep, dark garnet stone, framed in bright gold, glinted in the light. They were his colors, but they looked foreign on the jewelry. He focused on its engraving - a triangle, circle in the middle of it with a line cutting vertically through it, the top point to the center of the base. It was beautiful, even with the jagged crack someone stabbed into the very center of it.
Steve had drawn this fountain, back before the War. He slid his pencil around the outline of the figure, and sketched the statue’s eyes into familiar brown ones. He gripped the pencil tighter. It was easier to focus his strength on the fragile tool than let his mind wander. Everything came back to Tony.
Tony blindly reached for it on the bed, eyes never leaving Steve as he leaned against their bedroom wall, arms crossing over his chest and pulling the threadbared shirt over his biceps. Fuck, if his husband wasn’t beautiful. And also a fucking tease.
Steve smirked and tugged Tony back down into his arms. “I’m right where I want to be.” They had mission duties to deal with but that could wait for a moment, they had months after all. They could spend a little more time in this too small bed, together.
Steve let the declaration hang in the air, ripping the disinfectant wipe open and running it along the open flesh of his back. Tony hissed, and Steve paused, apologizing.
Another beat of silence. Tony turned his back to the books, so he faced the open, empty library that his mother had built. “Fertility. Arousal. Reactive and Active.”
Steve felt Tony’s heavy gaze on him but it was too easy to keep his on the objects in front of him, around him, hidden in little corners and crannies. All of it was his. Because someone thought them worth saving. He felt cold, definitely in shock, and though it registered that Steve just outed himself, he couldn’t quite feel any remorse.
Steve’s lips brushed across Tony’s hair, another bolt making him gasp against the dark strands. “We should go inside soon,” Steve whispered between breaking waves.
Behind them the crinkling sound of audio equipment being turned on morphed into the first notes of a familiar Christmas song. His big fan, Jungkook--the one making googly eyes and had arrived late (Tony tried to ignore his ironic similarities with the member)--raised a purple studded microphone and started the first lines of
By the time he'd changed, Tony was back in the Iron Man armor, flying low across the ship. Steve wondered if that was what he was using as a change of clothes, but pushed away the thoughts as soon as they turned to what he may be wearing under the armor.
“Stop,” Steve ordered when he was near the bed. “Unbuckle your pants and open them, but only far enough so you can get your hand in there. No need to undo all your hard work at getting presentable for the day.”
Coulson’s eyes narrowed. Steve knew the “modern world is very confusing” attitude would only work as a cover for so long, and he hoped he hadn’t passed its expiration date.
“Soon! Very--I can’t direct it though. I thought I’d be able to turn it away from him but I can’t touch it at all. I need a way--”
They all ate and Steve and Tony stood and kept watch, unable to pick up any of the Korean flying between them. Then, as one, they appeared to finish their meal and stood up, cleaning their area and walking towards the stage exit.
One line in, and Tony's eyelids dipped, a sweet smile softening his gaze. A beautiful sight that was enough to distract, usually would, but today Steve pushed through the words. “Well...you looked up at me, and your wrist, delicate and fine, twitched in the cuff; it stopped me in my tracks.”
The corpse continued to stare up to the ceiling. Steve knew he could’ve killed Stane easily, he could’ve kept this burden from Tony. But the man in his arms--his strength was evident in each long breath he took, with each rise and fall of his shoulders under Steve’s hold--completely alive. By killing Stane, Tony had reclaimed his life.
“Lucky for me, then.” He reached out for Tony, who managed to half-step, half-leap off the stage and into Steve’s arms. “Lead the way.”
For as long as Tony could remember, one thing remained the same: Tony Stark pushed buttons. Even in the middle of the boardroom, his focus collided with hundreds of different variables, he poked into every possible outcome. When they fought the super-villain of the week, he knew what to do. From board meetings to the battlefield, he constructed the plan.
“Someone pulled a Jimin,” the tall man with striking features teased, and the others laughed and started talking to each other in fast-paced Korean.
They navigated from the courtyard to a large field. “This is penance. Karma. For everyone I’ve ever sassed.”
After the ice one thing remained the same: Captain America gave the orders. In the middle of battle his world narrowed to a calm and controllable moment. When they fought the super-villain of the week, he knew what to do. He knew how to get his men in and out, how to minimize the damage. On the battlefield he gave the orders.
Bright, vibrant red shot across his sniper’s scope like a star hurtling through the sky, the only color in the night. The Soldier pulled his sniper away from the mission. He followed the red in his scope, watched, as it paused in the air, facing the Soldier. He couldn’t look away.
“So.” Tony clapped his hands together. “I guess the first thing I do is mount it--” he wiggled his eyebrows together “--isn’t that right?”
Namjoon crossed his arms over his chest, still seemingly determined. Jungkook on the other hand hissed out a breath and deflated back next to Jimin, breaking into a long tirade in Korean, before finally relenting. Jungkook then looked over at Tony with a shy sort of smile he’d recognized before on many fans' faces. “Go get them Iron Man.” Then he lifted his hand and imitated his gauntlet and the other members laughed and hit him on the shoulder and back, likely only embarrassing him further.
Tony pulled back, staying close but turning to look at Steve’s belongings. “I’m just trying to figure out how it even happened.”
. Brown eyes fixed on his face. “You make battle look good, Cap.” Tony’s smile sharpened, a mix of something affectionate and flirtatious.
Over the ocean, in the far off distance, lightning lit up a gray cloud. Tony shifted on the blanket next to Steve, not quite ready to go inside from their impromptu picnic just yet. The wind picked up and made him curl further into the warmth of Steve’s arm, where it was wrapped around Tony’s waist.
Happy needed JARVIS to start giving him some sort of secret warning signal or something, but at least today, Tony was distracted enough that he could slip out undetected.
The wind shifted when Anthony pulled up next to them wearing a wide smile and eyes just for Steve. They spent the afternoon criss-crossing on broomsticks across the sky.
There were a few people standing along the rim of the field, spectators - friends of the players, benefactors of the charity. No one would notice or care if Steve stood along the edge with them. Perfectly normal for him to keep a closer eye on his friend.
Tony’s focus swung to Steve, their eyes locked, silent confirmation that they were on the same page; perhaps this battle wasn’t over after all.
Bucky piled on another blanket, hoping that the weight of an additional quilt would go the extra mile, when it came to keeping his injured boyfriend still. Clint was not one for still. Yet here he was on the couch, injured from battle, arm unable to bend in his cast let alone pick up his faithful bow and arrows.
Steve immediately put up his hands and fell to his knees, attempting to appear as small and non-threatening as possible. “It’s me,” he whispered then tore off the mask he’d almost forgotten was still affixed to his face. He’d usually take it off, once he and Tony were somewhere private. Now, Tony flicked his gaze through his hanging fringe and stopped shaking at the sight of Steve, but didn’t move any closer.
A couple days later, Steve found Tony curled up, back to him, in their bed. The wooden box felt heavy in his hands as Steve kneed onto the mattress, dipping it with his weight. He caught sight of the tablet in Tony’s hands. “You’re awake?” he asked, and Tony unfurled, setting aside his book and sitting up. Steve could easily read the expectation on his face.
They joined the rest of the group, and Steve led them into the arena while Tony took the rear, scanning the crowd one last time before the thick doors did their best to keep out the fans' screaming out, and failing entirely. The group chatted amongst themselves for most of the walk though the man next to him, Taehyung, smiled and said, “Thank you. Iron Man is---whoa,” he broke off with a grin. Then he pointed at the man who’d come late wearing the sweatsuit. “Big fan of yours. The biggest.”
They decided to stick close to BTS even after the threat was assessed, as a precaution. Plus, having some of the best seats in the house, and a good vantage point of all stage entrances, made it worth the late night hours.
Steve padded into the kitchen, trailing Tony in his wake. Pepper knew immediately that something was...not off per se, but definitely shifted between the two.  They had clearly just been thoroughly enjoying themselves, but Tony enjoyed plenty of people, and Pepper very rarely saw him as open and vulnerable as
“Hey! It was my mission.” Steve turned his head and Tony’s face was right there, soft brown eyes lined with amusement, smile soft and tinted with an affection he’d never seen before.
“Crap, that’s Happy’s ringtone,” Tony sighed, splashing past Steve as he made his way to the stairs. Steve’s eye followed him, like they’d been doing the entire afternoon. It wasn’t until Tony burst out of the water that Steve realized he’d been holding his breath too.
He chuckled, and Tony closed his eyes, the sound rolling straight through his erection to land where the plug nailed his prostate. “I’m not going to take you here, Tony. As much as you’d like that."
Steve remained silent until he realized Tony was waiting for him to reply. “I do,” he admitted, face burning even though no one around them could overhear.
Tony took a deep breath, and assumed his best professional persona. The red light signifying he was live went on, and Tony put on a dazzling smile. He’d written this presentation recently, and was still working through a lot of the science, so he used these seminars to talk it out with other academics around the world, like one big brainstorming session. He was halfway through his introduction when the back door of the auditorium clicked open. It was hard to see past the stage lights, difficult to see anyone in the silhouette they cast overhead. But he knew those shoulders, the familiar stride breaking through the shadows: Steve was here.
. He may have whimpered again because Tony was spinning, brow furrowed and his eyes finally, finally lifting to meet Steve’s. They were hard, fixed and firmed, no light dancing in them any more, at least not now. Now there was steely determination, a resolution he’d made that he wasn’t going to be backing down. He looked powerful and empowered, but on the edges, in the corners of his eyes and the turn of his eyebrows there was the pain, the memory, a new sadness, a witness to things he had not seen before.
Steve was spiraling; he had to grip the railing when he stumbled into the elevator, and even that didn’t stop his knees from buckling. All Tony’s friends within the Tower, Ana and probably Mr. Jarvis, too, were gone. What did it mean?
Steve adjusted the strap of his bag over his shoulder, juggling the folders in one arm and his shield in the other. He turned to push the door to the locker room open with his hip, shuffling in awkwardly, so as not to drop any of his precarious collection of things. The room was filled with voices which was unusual. This locker room and the attached gym was for all the Ultimates, but Steve and Clint were the only ones who tended to use it.
He was trying to make Tony feel better, it was obvious and so like his Steve it made his chest ache. “Kinky,” he said offhand because it felt expected of him, easy, something to focus on instead of Steve lowering the stone on his desk. This was it, his final chance to get home. He took a deep breath. “When your blood hits the stone--What happened for me was that a beam, a portal, shot from the horcrux to me.”
Tony snorted. “It’s a bomb, well a series of bombs. Stane had me--I helped sometimes, it meant I could be in the workshop and…” Tony trailed off and Steve didn’t press him. He looked so exhausted, despite his earlier nap, completely folding in on himself. He should let the man rest, go back to his apartment for the night, but he also wanted to watch over Tony.
A whine spilled from Steve’s throat as he turned his head into Tony’s neck. “Jesus, Steve, you’re- fuck you’re hot like this. I thought we could make it till the end but- no, no, that won’t be happening.”
“Fuck, Steve,” Tony whispered, a hot hiss as he made his fingers stop moving. Steve held his breath, his entire being focused on the fingers and if, when, how they would move again. So when it was Tony’s hips that moved instead, dragging along Steve’s backside, he was woefully unprepared. That was his reasoning behind the desperate whimper that ripped from his throat at the first feel of Tony’s erection against his ass.
Steve yearned to learn the scent unaltered, to know how it felt to be the cause of it--He cut the thought off, guilt washing away all the intrigue, all the reactive arousal. His body responded to the stimuli that was Tony, but the reality made him lock it down tight, deep inside himself. “Is there anything I can do?”
Tony closed his eyes and shook his head. Steve’s gaze fixed on the bits of moisture that wet the corners of his eyes, but by the time his eyelashes fluttered open again the tears were gone and the bright eyes he’d come to know were as dead as the ones he’d first seen on the sidewalk weeks ago. “It’s nothing. It’s normal. A medical exam, nothing really, routine.”
“Go eat,” Steve said because he knew the look of a leader who wasn’t going to relax until he knew his men were safe, and right now they were as safe as they could be. “We’re making sure no one comes in unless they’ve passed security screening, and you guys have a show to put on later. A show I’m sure you need energy for.”
Steve pointedly ignored Stane and spoke instead over his shoulder to Tony. “I’m going to disarm him but I’ll leave the rest up to you.”
There was another flash but Steve’s gaze was now on the obvious bulge in Tony's pants. “Look at me,” Tony whispered, and Steve's eyes flicked back up. “Fuck. You're pretty.” He took another photo before lowering the camera and staring at Steve. “I want to touch you.”
Footsteps shuffled forward, and Steve came to stand beside them both, where they were staring each other down. “Hey, so, do I get a say in this? Or is it a full-fledged Stark-off? Seems odd, considering
“Pants first,” Tony said, and they made their way slowly out into the hallway. Tony pointed to a room across the hall and they stumbled their way over. There was a fingerprint lock on the door, but Tony pressed his thumb to it. The doors slid open and the thick, alpha scent flew out. It was enough to make Tony whine and fall to his side, landing against the doorframe which he began to slide down. “I don’t know if I can--” he broke off, taking a shaky breath through his mouth.
There was a grunt through the comms, a flash and then the rip in space started to stitch itself back together again, with Tony stuck forever on the other side.
Steve, half dazed from arousal, followed Tony’s suggestion. As soon as their hands moved and their cocks dragged together for the first time, a whimper broke from his throat and his hand’s grip tightened automatically, making both Steve and Tony gasp in unison.
He tried to turn over, wanting more, but hands stilled his hips. “Stay,” Steve ordered, before spreading his ass to lick over the sensitive, puckered skin. Tony groaned, nuzzling his face into the pillow as Steve teased him with his tongue.
“You deserve to hear it nonetheless.” Steve stepped close, and Tony winced again, following it this time with a curse.
“Fuck!” Steve shouted into his empty apartment, clamping his fingers in his hair and pulling. Hard. He had not planned for that to go the way it had. For one thing, he’d thought he’d find Tony alone. Which was stupid.
It was Tony stumbling backwards with a whispered curse that startled Steve back into action. In two strides he was by Tony’s side and wrapping his arms around him. The blood soaked into the carpet; Steve clenched Tony tighter to his side and reached over to Stane's still body, feeling for a pulse.
The ride over the bridge was quiet and tense. It only got worse when their cook-turned-driver asked them where they were going once they got into Brooklyn. Steve wanted to get to the hotel as soon as possible, but he didn’t want the man to know where they were heading so he led him to a cross street near the hotel.
“Be careful with those–oh wait, can you even get drunk?” Tony asked, unfolding his blanket and sprawling out for a tan.
They pushed the hallway doors open and stepped into a large entryway where tour buses could unload into the arena; Tony heard the screaming before they even exited the last pair of doors between them and the outside.
The next two weeks felt like a dream. Every time Steve closed his eyes, he remembered the feel of Tony against him, the taste of him mixed with his honeyed scent, undeniable proof that Tony enjoyed this new aspect of their relationship just as much as Steve.
Steve had become used to Tony’s fabulous wealth, unaffected when Tony informed him of his latest trip around the world, or purchase of a legendary painting or artifact. The fact that he informed the team one Saturday morning that Prince Henry and his friends were going to use the grounds of the Compound for a charity polo match, left none of them batting an eye. It was completely and utterly ridiculous, but not unexpected.
Steve walked over to Tony, and sat down next to him. He took a deep breath. “What happened?” he couldn’t help but ask. Tony’s cheeks were flushed and his hair looked like it’d sweated then dried over again, like he’d recently been for a run, but it was more than obvious that wasn’t the case. “Are you hurt?”
“--always been ungrateful”-- a muffled shout and Steve was halfway down the hall and he ran so fast he barely heard every other word. “I had...for you Tony... my legacy….genius...heirs.”
But all Steve saw was the thin metal chain; twisted steel from the handlebar to Tony’s wrist. His tan skin was a stark contrast against the cuffs and Steve imagined his own wrist there, pressed between metal and Tony Stark’s suit. His cock shifted in his uniform and he had to get his thoughts under control or else his situation would soon be obvious.
He wanted to be rash. Never before did two weeks seem so much like a lifetime, every minute bringing him closer and reminding him how many more he had to suffer through. There were times he thought maybe he could sneak in, maybe it wouldn’t be such a bad thing if Stane turned the corner and came face to face with a nanomasked Steve. Some nights he played out the scenario, his dark and bloody fantasies a hidden secret between him and his bedroom ceiling.
“Is that all you’re going to say for the next four months?” Tony asked, the boots humming to life, lifting him off the spaceship floor. The rumble of the engines quickly overpowered the hum of the repulsors, and Steve’s attention swung and stuck to the window that aimed up into the sky--the sky he was about to shoot up into for the first time in his life. Tony hovered in the air at the rear of the cockpit. “Then take the damn chair.”
Steve clenched his jaw against Tony’s defense, turning back at the computer because he couldn’t give himself away--but apparently Coulson didn’t seem to have much of an appetite for Rumlow’s crass claims either. He curled his lip in disgust. “Stane is an idiot who doesn’t know what he has with Tony Stark.”
The omega needed help, and Steve wasn’t going to keep avenues of assistance away from him, even if it meant he was overstepping.
Tony felt the buzz under his skin, the arousal thrumming low, even as the plug stretched him wide. With every shift, he felt the suit brush against his cock, teases of fabric against bare skin. The plug allowed the seam of his pants to rub against his rim and Tony had never felt more taken care of. Steve leaned in again, another soft kiss then a wink, before he was ushering Tony out the door. “Wouldn’t want to miss your first conference call. Nine am, wasn’t it?”
The hallways were empty as they walked through them and when Tony commented on it, Anthony shook his head. “They’re all at Hogsmeade right now. Or outside in the Quidditch pitch--Steve sometimes holds practice matches over the weekends.”
Steve’s eyes shot back up to Tony’s. “I’m. I mean. Sorry. Of course. Sorry. The suppressants. I couldn’t not, is all. But I--” Steve abruptly stood, walking towards the pool and trying not to panic. Tony caught what he couldn’t hide, what was impossible to suppress: his reaction to Tony. He didn’t deserve another alpha sniffing at his heels, taking from him what he wasn’t offering.
“I think,” Steve began, swallowing when she took the bag and peeked inside. “I know it’s incredibly invasive, and really none of my business,” he started, faster than he could breathe, words stumbling over each other. This was the right thing to do; at least, he’d been so sure when he stood outside of the pharmacy. “He deserves the option,” Steve said, finality in his words, because of that fact he was absolutely sure.
“So you say,” Steve replied before sliding onto the broom in front of Tony. "First few rides we'll do in tandem. Now, up!” he shouted, before Tony really had a grip on what was happening. The ground under him slipped away as they hovered, just an inch, over the ground.
He squeezed Tony closer, and it made the man squeak, so Steve loosened his grip. The movement had been enough to break Tony’s thoughts, but instead of saying a word, Tony chose to hold Steve tighter and bury his head in his chest.
“How’d you end up?” Steve was looking at him now, the intensity of his gaze almost a physical weight.
“Maybe we should--” He was cut off by a sound even louder than the name chant had been, it was as if each and every fan leaned forward facing the same direction -- a line of cars had arrived -- and shrieked as loudly as possible.
The water was a lake, calm and still except for the group of cape-clad children playing along the shore of the far end. He’d focused on the capes, but his mind was still trying to process the sight of the castle behind the lake. It reached so high it blocked the sun and it seemed like it had more towers than he could count. Near the lake, he could see a hut surrounded by a pumpkin patch, and it was the sight of huge pumpkins in what was supposed to be midsummer that made Tony start to laugh uncontrollably.
God he hadn’t tasted enough of the man, hadn’t ended enough of their arguments with heated embraces–
Eyes shot open and the shapeshifters hand shot out, wrapping around Tony’s ankle. He was pulled off his feet, bracing for impact with the ground, when he felt arms catch his fall. Wrapping under Tony’s arm, Steve lifted him to his feet before rushing around Tony to sedate the shapeshifter yet again.
Stunned, Steve gasped and Tony leaned closer, swiping his tongue along Steve’s lips. Steve moaned, mouth opening to the first taste of Tony, the first feel of his eager arms coming around to pull Steve flush against him. Their scents rolled around them, heady in bright citrus and honeyed musk. Tony gasped against his lips and Steve never wanted the kiss to end, he ran his hands over Tony’s back, into his hair, back down over his neck, touching all the places he’d wanted to touch for so long, but felt so unsure, so unable to, because Tony wasn’t his and had shown no desire to be.
The thought seemed so ludicrous now, with Tony gripping tight into his hair and rolling his hips against Steve’s. Tony wanted him, it was clear as day in his scent, his rocking hips, his needy kisses. Steve broke away with a harsh breath when he felt the first hint of Tony’s hard cock against his thigh. “Tony,” he whispered between heaving breaths.
The car came to a stop and Steve didn’t wait for the driver, he threw open his door and beelined towards the elevators. He had exactly ten minutes until his briefing, and he intended to be there right on time.
“Don’t,” James growled the word under his breath. The sound rumbled from his chest to Clint’s, at all the places where they were pressed together. With James hovering over him, Clint knew it should feel threatening. James’ hold was tight on his waist, their thighs slotted together, James had him surrounded. The man had been trained for decades, honed to be dangerous; Clint couldn’t care less.
The only reason Tony woke was because a weight shifted on the bed. Steve. He felt a fingernail pick at something on his back. Steve’s come from earlier. The memory, the evidence of it - Tony warmed, stretching into the hand as it caressed his back. “Steve,” Tony purred.
The electricians and other NASA personnel had already taken the elevator down. The command center was ready for takeoff. All that remained was the fact that there were two men standing in the center of the spaceship primed for a solo mission.
“Me too,” Tony whispered back. “All the seasons greetings and adrenaline really inspired me. Along with your face.”
“You know you’re not supposed to speak in those meetings. You’re there to vote and be silent.” A pause and Steve had to slide out of the elevator before the doors shut in front of him. Moving with as softest steps possible, he heard the man continue. “Or maybe I’ll let the other shareholders shut you up in other ways.”
He pushed away from the door and went back to his apartment. Sitting on the couch, he stared at his hands and wondered what he would have done if Tony believed him about being Captain America. Would he come to believe him? He just blurted it out. The biggest secret of his life, and Steve just told a near stranger.
“I don’t think I’ll be as good as--” Tony gestured upward, wanting to keep the focus on Anthony, to see that focus play across Steve’s face.
“Can’t say I thought about much more than punching you in the face and updating that gorgeous Captain America suit of yours--” he turned his head and bit at Steve’s ear hard and fast, almost as if he just wanted to make Steve gasp again. “But then you bullied your way onto my mission, my bed, and now my arms. So I have to say, I’m paying attention now.”
Tony nodded. Once inside, the doors slid closed behind him, and Steve unclenched his teeth against a loud roar of anger. He didn’t even try to tamp it down; Tony was waiting outside and Tony wouldn’t see or smell the anger he soaked into Stane’s space.
He was perfunctory about it, not building to anything, just putting the plug in its place like Tony had his Windsor knot, his Adam's apple hitting it as he swallowed. One more push and it was inside, stretching him, the layer of lube Steve had applied doing little to ease the burn. Tony loved that burn, loved how even with his face pressed into the mattress and his hands spreading his ass apart, all he could focus on was the burn.
He felt sick as soon as his panic cleared. How could he have just left Tony there? He could hear Stane shouting at him, could see bruises, new, visible, bruises. And how the man spoke to Tony. All of it, every last word, drenched with hatred, with abuse. And Steve had left him there. Alone.
“You’re doing so well,” Tony murmured into Steve’s ear. “You look edible, all dressed up and shaking. I bet you’d let me unzip your pants right here and take care of you.”
“Can you hear me now?” Tony joked to himself, but he wasn’t by himself. Even across the universes, there was another him standing next to another Steve, well on their way to finding one another. He turned to face his Steve and smiled. He was home.
“Ah,” Steve replied, voice tight. “A model. That makes sen--Showing him around the grounds?” Steve--Professor Rogers, the
With the target obtained, Steve pivoted on his heel and began his retreat. Like before, no one noticed or cared about his presence. He slipped from R&D and back into the elevator, pressing the correct floor for his briefing this time. Glancing at his watch, he still had three minutes.
Tony’s breath hit his neck, a gasp of something - surprise? Desire? Before Steve could think more of it, Tony’s determined hands moved up, then pulled back so that only his fingertips remained, a light tease of a touch along the edges of both his nipples. It was all Steve needed to buck in Tony’s hold, his head rolling with the ripple of pleasure onto Tony’s shoulder. Tony pinched his fingers lightly and Steve shuddered again, melted completely in Tony’s arms.
Pushing open the first door he saw, Steve found himself in a long, white hallway. He picked a direction at random and started to walk until he came to a bank of elevators. As he waited for the doors to open, he considered everything he knew about Tony and skyscrapers. Generally, the residences were on the top floors and he wouldn’t be surprised if the sole omega heir to the Stark fortune was nestled away, in a safe, in the very core of the building.
Bucky shrugged, slid onto the couch next to Clint and tucked the blankets around them both. “Whatever you say, marshmallow. I know you like to be comfortable for movie night.”
A pretty girl in a black dress offered Steve a drink from a tray, but he refused, not willing to give up his one free hand. The metal wrapped in the embrace of his fingers was getting him drunker than any alcohol could.
“There’s a reason the shapeshifters targeted them,” Steve reminded. “Their influence is supposed to be unmatched.”
Steve laughed under his breath. “They know that already. We’re just here in case one of them gets attacked regardless.”
Even without the hordes of SHIELD agents, Steve still growled when Coulson knocked on the door. He was paralyzed by the thought of moving from Tony to go and open it. Tony--brave, beautiful, strong-- Tony, pulled away from Steve to go open it. Steve followed, unable to keep him out of arm's reach.
“I thought the stars hadn’t arrived yet,” Tony said to Steve, leaning close because he needed to ensure Steve heard him. It wasn’t at all because he wanted to stay close to him when had no excuse to, in this larger space.
“Close it.” How he managed the words, he hardly knew, since the feeling under his skin had started to build, coalesce, a pressure that felt like a sob but all encompassing.
, and then there was the sound of lips on skin and Steve was only so strong. He looked up just in time to see them come together, each pushing to control the kiss then relenting in turn. Tony pulled away first, breath hitched and his mouth wet and shining in the overhead office light. Steve could easily recall the taste of him, the feeling of being in the middle of their embrace.
The rage was back. Steve opened the laptop again, having to hold back from ripping it into two, useless, pieces, and started his search for an answer to that question.
“It seems”--Steve read, presumably completely unaware of Tony’s predicament--“that our resident shapeshifter gang has targeted them specifically.”
Steve arched into Tony, breath panting even as Tony pulled away, eyes narrowing as he waited for an answer.
good.” He ran a thumb against Tony’s pink cheek. “But a lot just got revealed, and I don’t want that to get swept away by the power of…”
It was like everyone in the stadium hushed to a quiet, his angelic voice ricocheting off the empty seats. Tony felt more than saw Steve slide up next to him as the rest of the members chimed in and the song continued. “They sure sound beautiful.”
Clint slunk into the dark kitchen, sock-covered feet silent on the tile floor. He tiptoed by the fridge, around the espresso maker, over to the bread basket that held Clint’s prize. Nat had brought them into the tower last night with strict orders to keep them untouched till morning.
They ushered him in and Coulson didn’t even blink at Stane’s corpse, instead he turned and greeted Tony with an outstretched hand. A pang shot through Steve when Tony stopped, flicking his gaze at Stane, the alpha that used to control who he met and associated with, now dead. Confusion, fear, hope, a countless number of emotions painted Tony’s expression, adrift for the first time without someone to tell him what to do.
Sitting across from him with a sporkful of vaguely curry flavored astronaut food frozen halfway to his mouth, Tony caught Steve watching him and narrowed his gaze. “What? I’d ask if there was food on my face but I’m pretty sure whatever this is would cause a mild burning and discomfort if it got anywhere near my ageless beauty. The days of experimental skincare practices is far behind me, well, not far far but far--”
Steve walked around the side of the floor. Most workstations were empty but a few had people working in them. No one seemed to care about Steve though, barely looking up as he passed by. The mannequins holding the masks were, thankfully, unmanned. It’d been a while since he performed any sleight of hand, but he was confident no one noticed when he slipped one into his bag.
“Not a problem,” Professor Rogers said, sending him a Steve Rogers watt smile. “I’ll be right back.”
Steve kissed his head then lifted his Switch so they both could see. “And look.” Steve pointed to his house in the game. “When I sell more fruit or bugs or fish, I can pay off my loan, and then Nook adds a room to my house.”
Before he could even get a word out, Anthony cut him off. “The reason Tony can’t bleed on it himself is because there's already two of him here! So it’s easy to conclude what might happen if
Tony felt his cheeks heat at the thought, at how wrong it was. Pressing his lips together, he willed back his smirk as he handed Steve the drink with a wink. The drink Steve had ordered him to make.
A few more vigorous laps cleared his mind, for the most part, and he wanted to join the others, so he pushed off the edge and made for the group. When his foot hit the shallower floor, Tony’s cell phone started ringing.
Tony floated, even as Steve pulled away, his hands running up Tony’s back to stroke through his hair. “Hey,” he heard Steve whisper, turning his head to see him crouching by the bedside table. The leather cuffs were in his hand, a questioning eyebrow raised. The words from earlier circled in Tony’s mind and he could easily read the question on Steve’s face.
Tony’s hands had been resting in his lap and they clenched at that news. “So it wasn’t that he didn’t tell me, it was that he didn’t even know. After all that time. After all this.” He looked up at Howard’s collection. “I don’t know which one’s worse.”
The orchestra crescendoed into the middle of the first act, and Tony shifted in his seat in the front row of his box at the Met. Every movement pressed the plug into a new angle, and he floated between pleasure and overstimulation as the opera faded into the background. The fact that at any moment anyone could turn them a passing gaze only amplified Tony’s problem.
Steve pulled back, just far enough to blow cool air over the damp kiss marks. “No,” he said, considering. “I don’t think you’ve properly repaid me.”
Thank you so much for coming along on this journey with Tony, and thank you so much ferret for betaing along the way.
That was what finally made Professor Rogers’ gaze whip away from Tony’s for the first time since his face was revealed. Tony watched Steve’s pale face turn a deep shade of red, sputtering as he tried to find his words. “What are you--What did you say? I can’t--I’m not--We’re not--” His eyes widened in panic.
They gazed back over at the portal where Anthony and Steve were still standing, now looking incredibly uncomfortable while also shooting each other side long glances.
“You’re doing so well,” Steve murmured into Tony’s ear. “You look stunning, all dolled up and shaking. I bet you want me to unzip your pants right here and take care of you."
He rolled the metal sphere Tony had given him around in his palm. His hot skin had warmed it to body temperature. It was all he could think about, despite the press of the party around him, the music, the laughter.
Steve smiled. “Well, of course I am. We have the brilliant mind of not one but two Starks behind us.”
Now, Tony dragged his finger along the smooth sides of the gem stone then moved to trace over the laceration. The roughened stone scratched the pad of his thumb. It had a hum of residual energy, yet every scan he ran proved this observation incorrect. Another drag of his finger and this time it caught against his skin, poking quick and sharp, and a drop of blood beaded on his thumbpad.
” Steve asked, eyes still fixed on their counterparts. “Also, hi, wow, what a surprise! I mean, I’m sorry, where are my manners? It's a pleasure to meet you, if not a bit surprising. ”
Tony heard their front door open and he stepped away from the mirror. He listened to the sounds of footsteps, imagined their path to their bedroom. And when Steve appeared in the doorway in the clothes he’d worn to sleep, soft gray sweatpants and a tight white t-shirt, he looked like he was ready to roll back in bed. But Tony could see the intent in his eyes, the way they purposely dragged over the toys on the bed then back at Tony, whose hand still lingered on his tie. He dropped it to his side and waited.
After a moment, Tony broke away with a gasp. “Use that big hand to wrap around us both.” He shifted, bringing his cock and Steve’s hand closer to where Tony’s hand wrapped around Steve.
He had to turn away from Steve before he did something stupid, like kiss him right here in the arena cafeteria, or link their arms together. Instead he looked over at the members. “I like the one that liked me a lot the best.”
“Irrelevant,” the other him snapped, sounding as expertly dismissive as Tony himself managed. He pointed to Tony’s hand. “The ring. How did it come to be in your possession? I had the honor of examining it and two other horcruxes a few years ago...”
Two weeks into the unrelenting summer heat, Tony invited them to the pool. It was a foregone conclusion before he even finished the question--anything to rinse away the persistent layer of sweat that stuck his t-shirt to his chest.
They reached the small dormitory made for one and stopped at the edge of the capsule. It was round with a mattress on the bottom, crisp linen sheets and a single pillow, large enough that one person could comfortably sleep in it, even sit up. But with two people... “This is where you say, ‘looks better than wartime conditions’ with a comforting smile.”
“Lower your hand once the ring is in place then turn around and pull your pants over that plump ass of yours, so I can do the finishing touches for us. If you’re already whimpering from this alone, I don’t think I can trust you once you put those greedy fingers of yours anywhere near your prostate.”
“That they were in there fooling around?” Tony smirked. “That’s exactly what I think.” He stepped closer to Steve, so he could see the inside of the closet (with the perk of standing closer to Steve) and assessed, “It looks big enough. Maybe we should give it a go?” he joked, because they were on duty and there were seven other people in the room.
That one made Steve lift his eyebrow in amusement, gaze still firmly fixed on his paperwork. “Is that so?”
Rhodey had the fleeting worry that if this went south--he hadn’t seen Tony look this happy in a long while--but he tried to push his worries away. Tony would do what Tony wanted to do, and obsessing over what might happen would be a waste of time. Besides, Rogers was a good man, and Rhodey was pretty sure he could trust him. He was happy for his friend, because he hadn’t seen him look that content in a long time…if ever.
Bucky turned the page, watching over the book as Tony traced a finger along the petal, smiling for a moment. Then he looked over at the living room.
Tony remained silent in front of him, but eventually he brought his gaze up, met Steve’s for a brief instant, before returning back to his broken and bloody hands.
“This was even better than it sounded,” James said between sips, as they walked around the port side.
From deep in his throat, Steve roared; his eyes blurred and he kicked off the back of the elevator and sprinted down the hallway. There was no question as to where Tony was being held. He knew. His scent, his heart, his mind, it was all linked to Tony. At the end of the hall, the door was double enforced and tripled locked but it didn’t stand a chance against Steve. Not now, not when he was seething and single minded. It crashed open, right off the hinges.
He stood there for a while admiring the way the water rolled over Tony’s shoulders as he swam laps down the pool. They were high above the streets and it almost looked like he was swimming over the city itself. When he reached the opposite end of the pool he turned and did a back stroke down the other end. Steve couldn’t look away from his abs, torso, chest, way more skin than he was expecting or prepared for. He had not worn enough scent blocker.
Anthony walked over to the wall and pulled two brooms off their hooks. He handed the longer of the two to Steve and kept the other one for himself, then they headed outside. They walked a bit away from the hut, heading for the forest that surrounded the grounds. A large field appeared before they met the treeline, it was next to an even larger field that was surrounded by stadium seating and had goal posts at either end. The field was empty, a wide open space that must be used for training.
“Yeah?” Steve asked, and wanted to kick himself to stop his heart from racing as Tony moved closer to him on the bench.
“Horcrux.” Anthony must have seen the confusion on his face. “It held a piece of a man’s soul. A horrible, evil man,” he clarified simply, but the words left a heavy weight on his shoulders, sunk him down so he perched on one of the desks across from Tony.
No, breaking down doors and carrying off Tony wasn’t how he was going to be able to work this. He had to be quiet. He dropped his gaze from the tower to the alley that wrapped around the northern side of it. If only he could see him, talk to him, if he knew that Steve was able to keep him safe then maybe he could help turn the sour twist of his scent from its rancid state to something lighter. All he had to do was say the word.
Light fingers danced down Steve’s side, then tucked up under his shirt. The cotton t-shirt and gym shorts he wore suddenly seemed naked and exposed as he blushed under the gaze he knew he was subject to.
“--the deal was set! Fifty thousand units for three mill.” A pause, then the man turned red. “No! Do you know who I am? I may be one member of the board but the rest of the Stark Industries execs will toe whatever line
Bucky reached for the TV remote. “A flightless bird, huh? I guess for the time being I should call you penguin.”
Tony cut off his thoughts because he hadn’t lost anyone yet. He scanned every street, looking the the familiar shoulder length hair, the stride he’d be able to place anywhere.
Anthony exhaled through his teeth. “Ha! This is so, very me. You sure you weren’t just avoiding the chance we'd say no?”
Steve followed up several floors, until he got to one he hadn’t been to before. It looked more like the hallway of a hotel than an office building. The scent of Tony was almost as strong as when he was right in front of him.
Forcing his eyes open, he could tell right away he was in a forest. The trees were thick and varied, beech, oak, pine, and sycamore all around him. As he looked around, he realized he sat towards the edge of the forest, a large field peeking ahead of him between the trees. The wind picked up, a piercing shriek that Tony realized wasn’t the wind at all but a scream coming from above him. He shuffled to his feet, moving towards the sound instead of away like he could hear Steve in his mind ordering him to do so. But this wasn’t the battlefield--at least, he didn’t think it was...he crouched low as he got to the treeline, wishing desperately he had more in his possession than just a ring. Maybe if he focused on working on the nano-suit instead of tinkering with magic artifacts.
Steve growled, and Tony mewled, skittering across the room. Steve clamped down on his throat, trying to control his natural response to Tony’s words. “No.”
Tony paused against Bucky’s neck, turned his head to look at Steve with pupils blown, eyes full of wanting, and it was like they were designed to teeter him over the edge right into madness, if not distraction.  A growl formed in his chest and he pushed his paperwork away, the desk chair flying into the wall behind him, when he quickly stood and came around the desk.
Since it seemed in both his reality and his own hallucinations there were no threats, Tony started to walk along the treeline. He let the shouting fade behind him, heading towards the sound of splashing water. Maybe he could follow a river to something that made any sort of sense.
Steve followed the order without hesitation. It felt like forever since Tony’s last order, his last touch. He had no idea what Tony had planned, but his uncertainty gave way to excitement.
Tony took one last deep sip of his coffee, before shifting his weight and swinging his plush office chair towards his computer monitor. The StarkChat they used for meetings had a preview of his face before he joined, and Tony used the reflection to fix his tie and check for any stray lovebites on his neck that he may have missed.
Steve turned on his heel and froze. Tony stood by the bench, waving his tie expressively in one hand. And he was completely naked.
Tony sucked hard, swirling his tongue against the head, swallowing down as much as he could. Steve bucked forward relentlessly, barely letting Tony gasp in a breath between unforgiving thrusts.
“Rumlow, how good to see you,” Coulson greeted, sounding anything but. He didn’t drop his gaze from Steve.
“It means he’s running late,” Namjoon explained before walking over with a few members to go say hi to a couple fans.
Under his eye, Tony stretched his fingers then curled them into a fist so that the tendons of his forearm shifted the muscle, the carpals twisting against the restraint of the cuff. The movement shot to his cock and Steve had to tear his eyes away, trying to shove these thoughts back where they belonged, but now Tony had noticed and Steve wasn’t sure what that meant. All he could do was turn and walk into the Quinjet, selecting a seat far from Tony.
Steve worried at his lip, wondering if he had imagined the growing tension from earlier, until Tony settled back into his chair, monologue over, and held Steve’s gaze in silence for a moment. “I need you to do exactly as I tell you.”
Tony parted for him, tongue coming out to swipe at Steve’s lips before he could even get his bearings around the taste of Tony. It didn’t take long before Steve wanted more than what the over-the-shoulder kissing was allowing him to have. He growled in frustration then rolled in their confined capsule, until he was on his back and able to pull Tony on top of him.
They were still crouched in the remnants of the cage, Tony shaking again, completely naked in front of him. Steve whipped off his jacket and held it out towards Tony, but Tony didn’t move to take it. He just stayed frozen; the only movement he was made a continuous tremble.
He looked down at the piece of paper, blew away the bits of lead that sprinkled across the page of his completed design.
Steve roared, kicking the door open and trampled over where it fell in the hallway. Stane stood in the center of the room, twisting away from the bed to see who had just interrupted his tirade. It pained Steve to move his focus from his intended target, but he needed to find Tony, see with his own eyes that he was okay, even more. His gaze dropped to the bed. Tony lay back on his elbows, frozen where Stane loomed over him. His eyes were wide and scared and around one of them formed a ring of reddened purple. The first signs of a black eye.
But how was Steve supposed to explain that looking had become admiring, had become desiring? That even in this clunky, unflattering space suit, Tony was still the only thing in the room Steve wanted to look at? He didn't have words for any of it, but he also couldn't let Tony go without something.
Under the cover of darkness, he pulled out the bag of desserts, and slid his hand in. But before his fingers could wrap around one of the mini pies, a knife went soaring through the air and slammed into the drywall over his shoulder.
With no other plan in mind, he broke from the trees and headed for the castle. No one stopped him, though the kids on the other side of the lake looked up at him, waved, then returned to their game. He waved back, his hand feeling as surreal and confused as the rest of him. The castle only grew as he approached, and he lifted his head as its foreboding stone cut off the sky. The doors were nearly three stories high, but Tony pushed them open easily, far easier than he expected.
Tony lowered his helmet, shaking his head with relieved laughter, hands coming up to frame James’ face. “Yeah. I’m going to need to kiss you. Hard.”
Steve followed up at SHIELD while Tony did his best to try and reach the Jarvises. Once, halfway through the week, Tony received an email from his Stark Industries inbox. A board member looking for him; Tony threw the phone across the hotel room and did not reply.  It felt like Stane’s spies were everywhere, even if only that one person had contacted Tony directly.
Steve was writing a reply asking Tony how he was today, when a series of messages came in back to back.
“Maybe they’re late? Though--” Steve’s eyes scanned the crowds for possible threats. “I thought they were all supposed to arrive together. We’ll ask the others when they finish greeting their fans.”
The lead slashed across the page, ringing in his ears. They could have talked more then, set boundaries to separate their play.
Tony and Steve walked through a hallway so narrow, they had to brush against each other as they made their way through the garland lined backstage of the arena. They looked over the sheet of paper SHIELD had given them with the information for their mission. “I still don’t understand why SHIELD is protecting pop stars,” Tony grumbled
“You weren’t joking,” Tony whispered, backing away, taking his warmth and his scent with him even as it tinged and soured with fear and confusion. “You. Alive....but, how?”
It wasn’t until the second act that Steve realized Tony hadn’t been entirely forthcoming about the toy.
“It’s supposed to be my chair, anyway!” Steve shouted as he stumbled through another rattle of the engines and made his way to the seat.
Tony nodded, and without any finesse or care, Steve advanced, lightning quick, snapping Stane’s wrist until the gun fell into Steve’s waiting hand. Stane’s face turned red with pain, grunting and hissing every vile word he could seemingly think of. “You think he wants you, boy?” Stane snapped at Tony. “You think he cares about you? He’s using you, just like I used you, just like anyone who's ever met you has ever done, will ever do. Because no one cares about you. They just care about what you can give them, what they can take from you. You’re--”
The world appeared in black and white. The dark shadows of the New York City skyline a stark silhouette against the vibrant white of the moon. The Soldier had a mission, and with a single minded focus he prowled through the alley, silently hooking his metal hand around the ladder of a fire escape that hung over his head.
Tony moved immediately, his hand rougher than Steve had expected, larger too and absolutely perfect as it made a few slow strokes up and down Steve’s cock. Tony caught his eye, and Steve kept their gazes locked until he closed his palm perfectly around the tip of Steve’s cock and he had to close his eyes from the pleasure.
To say the man was in a grumpy mood was an understatement, Clint glared at him from under his mountain of blankets. “I have a broken arm, not a fever.”
Out of nowhere, Tony groaned and Steve felt his pulse ramp up, already in tune with Tony’s frustrations and desires.
“Tony, I’m Captain America.” Crap. He hadn’t meant to say that, but the thought of lying...Silence rang out over the chess table until Tony blurted out a bark of laughter.
He was beautiful and serious and commanding and Steve’s stomach swooped as the rest of the world fell away to leave only Tony in sharp focus. The tension returned, tenfold, all wound through Steve’s nerves until it pulled him taut.
Once before he had felt this urge, when Bucky had retold his Hydra ordeal to the Howling Commandos. Straps had held him down to the table, unable to move. And Steve imagined himself captive, held in that that position on the table. Helpless. He pictured Bucky leaning over him, tightening the straps. Blood had thrummed through his body then, just as it did now.
Tony took a step forward and then another, into Steve’s space. The shield was at their sides, creating an enclosed place, just for them. “I didn’t see the point of fighting him before you. But now I want to. I’ve thought about it, Steve, and I--” Tony cut himself off and with a curse, he lifted onto the tips of his toes and kissed Steve.
“I’d apologize”--Steve bit his lip, just briefly, then continued even as his cheeks pinkened--“but I find I kinda like the thought of distracting you.”
“Among other things. Another SHIELD Agent joined the conversation, mentioning something called Jericho. It was in the files too.”
They’d been playing the game in companionable silence for some time when Tony, hand hovering over his rook, looked up to Steve. “They put me on prenatals.”
"Sorry," Steve muttered. "Didn't sleep well last night." Steve brushed past him and dumped his stuff on the bench, not turning around until both Clint and Tony were dressed and gone, laughing and talking as they pushed out of the locker room.
Tony hummed and told Steve how beautiful he looked, and it made him want to look at Tony, touch Tony. As soon as he had the thought his hands moved, curling around Tony’s cock and cutting off his compliments midway through. “Oh god, Steve, yes, that feels so good. Your hands are so big, fuck.” Steve’s hips jerked in Tony’s hand at his words. The way he felt under Tony’s touch made it hard to focus on Tony’s own cock, but Steve followed the pace that Tony set and soon they were both gasping and moaning, air turning hot and heavy in the capsule as they kissed.
“No. If I’d known this last time,” he began, tone firm, shaking his head at Steve. “Tony may be willing to risk that you could be sent back to his world, but I’m not--”
Steve stretched out on the floor, nestling his bare skin against the plush rug. He still tingled from head to toe after three mind-blowing orgasms. Every time his eyes caught sight of Tony’s hand for the next week, he was going to have to push away an erection. Those talented hands; Steve wondered if he’d be able to handle the feel of Tony’s mouth or his ass, when even the thought of them made Steve’s spent cock twitch inside his briefs.
“Tony!” Anthony hissed, but the Steve on the other side of the portal just laughed and shifted closer to Anthony.
Folding the sketch around the phone, Steve left the gift in the corner of the hallway, near the part that smelled the most of Tony. Then he turned around and left.
The screens lit up with Steve's face, eyes narrowed and mouth partly open, caught mid-sentence. He could see the amusement in his eyes, warring with exasperation. Was this how Tony saw him?
Tony looked at Jungkook, the man in the bucket hat that was leaning in close to the one he’d arrived with, Jimin. Jungkook looked to be in his early 20s, which meant he'd had Iron Man in his life for nearly a decade now. God, Tony was getting old. But it was nice to know that he was still a hero to this young man, that his reach had made it across oceans and languages. As he walked them further into the arena, he realized that this K-pop group had done the same; they had connected cultures, many of them. Their influence was unique, and he was starting to better understand why the shapeshifters targeted them specifically.
Coulson nodded and kept walking down the hall. He knew, and he was going to let Steve keep it. But one thing was for certain, he couldn’t swipe any more R&D from SHIELD.
No. He’d told a friend. Someone that he wanted to help and that was helping him. Steve wasn’t so oblivious that he hadn’t noticed the positive effects Tony had on him. After waking up in this century with everyone he knew from back then, a stranger now decades older; it was as if he was floating alone, a man out of time. But then Tony. The draw of him, yearning to get to know him, the will to help him, all of it was something that tethered him to the here and now. And Tony didn’t even know.
Tony floated in absolute nothingness before slamming into a force field, then he bounced again and again, and again, before landing on rough ground, grass under his hands and a tree trunk colliding with the back of his head. “Fuck!” Tony groaned, multi-colored sparks lighting the back of his eyelids. He felt underwater, wrong-side-right, disorientated, even the air tasted different when he finally managed a breath.
Tony barked out a laugh. “It’s definitely closer. Now get on and let me lather you in sunscreen. Complimentary piña coladas at lunch.”
Steve nodded and tried not to move an inch of his body. Tony, on the other hand, came alive, shifting and dragging his hips along Steve as he moved into a sitting position. “Look, if you’re unable to even sleep next to me because you’re so, I don’t know,
They’d been flirting for months and went on one maybe-coffee-date where, after, Steve had linked their arms together like they were in grade school. Now, a week later, the slight curve of Steve’s mouth and the way he sometimes brushed his bottom lip with his tongue when he was unsure or about to speak, had become a full time distraction.
Everything was white for a moment, his hearing fogged, eyes closed, and then the sound of clapping broke through and he rolled his head up to glare at Steve in the front row, who was giving him a standing ovation. The vibrations had not ceased.
Tony chuckled under his breath, and Steve flushed but challenge still sparked in his gaze. “I wasn’t the only one who walked by the door, was I?”
Above Steve the day was bright, the sky blue. It reminded him of one of their last Wednesdays at the tower when Tony had convinced Steve to join him in the balcony pool. They’d grown so reckless, curious arms sliding against slick, wet skin. Tony’s contagious laugh had warmed Steve long after he’d left the sunshine. He turned the corner, and his nostalgia fueled grin slipped from his face as he skidded to a stop--day bright, sky blue, just like the first time he’d laid his eye on Tony. Exactly like that day when everything stuttered to a halt at the first sign of Obadiah Stane.
The tests were their only task for the day. The spaceship contained only the lab, the dorm, a sanitation room and the cockpit. They hovered in the area between rooms, Steve with his feet shuffling on the ground and Tony still floating in the air.
Steve may have said something that sounded like, “The best gift I could ask for,” but it was swept up into their first kiss.
“I’ve never been one for doing what I should,” Steve mumbled under his breath. Tony either didn’t hear or pretended not to. Instead he walked towards the penthouse, his scent wafting passed Steve, the twist of soured distress returning, horribly, under the citrusy smells. Steve had put that there, in a way. Though he knew it had more to do with Stane, more to do with this hell of a situation he yearned to break Tony free of. When he reached the door to the penthouse, Tony looked back at him from over his shoulder. “Chess?” he asked with a wane smile.
“My mother,” Tony supplied. “She put it together. Used every allowance Howard gave her, all of it went to this.”
“Come here, Professor.” Tony led him over to the stacked mats, pulling them apart to reveal the unpainted shield.
Steve didn’t say anything, kept grinning like a loon at Anthony, and Tony really should be going soon but he really had zero intention or interest in breaking those two apart right now.
He let Tony get into the capsule first. It seemed as if the other man had no qualms or hesitations when it came to sharing such a small space, just nestled up by the wall on his side in a moderately successful attempt at giving Steve some room. The sleep pants clung to his hips and his shirt rode up enough to drive Steve’s focus to the line, but not so high that Tony seemed to notice it.
Tony heard Steve moan, then the hand on his jaw clenched, the gentle fingers turning harsh as they pried his jaw open. Before he had time to suck in a full breath, Steve’s hips pressed forward and Tony’s mouth filled with his hard cock.
“We’ll find a way to reach them. It’ll be okay. For now--” Steve reached onto the ground and lifted the mask. Steve stepped close, into Tony’s personal space, and lifted it to his face. Tony didn’t flinch this time, but he did hold his breath as he raised his chin to signal for Steve to slip on the mask. They were so close, and Steve wanted to wrap him close, keep him safe in his arms and bring the world around him down in flames. He wanted to kill Obadiah Stane slowly, let him watch the pain Steve could inflict, one bruise for every one he’d ever painted on Tony’s skin. Make him bleed for every drop he’d made Tony spill.
Steve smelled it before the library doors opened. The honey scent from last time had twisted into a citrusy spice. In the center of the room, Tony laid on a chaise lounge, a blanket pulled up and over his shoulders.
Steve shaded in the shadows as he thought of Tony’s lips. He hadn’t expected the man to stop by the door on his way out, and thank Steve for the kiss.
In the end, the truth revealed itself. As soon as the shapeshifters were knocked unconscious--three by Cap’s shield and one by the force of Tony’s gauntlet--the four shapeshifters reverted back to their actual form: bluish skin with a row of yellow horns along their foreheads. Steve pulled a phone out of his back pocket, presumably contacting SHIELD, and Tony took a step closer, unable to contain his curiosity. It wasn’t everyday he came face to face with an extraterrestrial that wasn’t Thor.
Steve didn’t need to hide anymore; they’d been caught. And now it was time for Stane to know who he was dealing with. He let his scent ooze into the room. Let him feel as violated as he made Tony, let him feel like his territory had been breached, and know that Tony was gone because of it.
Darkness, just the light from the hallway behind Steve shined through the door frame; all he could see were shadows. He could still smell Tony and now he could hear him, whispering and sniffling and shouting, but not coming any nearer. Steve fumbled for a light, knocked his knee into a chair before he found it, pulling the string of a standing lamp which cast the room into a low light.
“So, what do you think?” Tony asked, because why else would Steve have followed him here if not to talk tactics?
Clint tried to bolt out from under James, but his thighs tightened and held Clint in place. Determined fingers dug in at the exact right places and a bubble formed in his chest, building as he twisted into the sensitive skin until he could barely manage between laughs: “Don’t you dare!”
Tony nodded, holding up a thumbs up. “I’m going to sleep, and then maybe devour a cheeseburger or five. Supplies was code for cheeseburgers, yeah?”
“He saw,” Tony barely managed through a raspy breath.  “The footage from the Tower security. He watched it all. Figured out our pattern. The mask didn’t matter.”
Tony slid his hands out from under Steve’s then placed them over his, trading places. He gripped tightly. “Okay.” Tony nodded, the corners of his lips starting to flick up into a smile. “After all, how can I say no to the Star Spangled Man with a Plan?”
“I know, Steve,” Chef Ana finally broke in, bringing a hand up to rub his shoulder. “I’ll make sure he knows.”
Somewhere along the songs they’d turned to face one another, the darkness allowing Tony to be bold, he wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck.
Tony’s hand roamed to the back of Steve’s neck during the kiss and when they pulled apart, Steve wanted to drop his head into the steady weight of Tony’s grip. He knew the man had begun speaking and Steve gathered himself enough to listen through the haze of Tony’s taste, and touch and scent. “I’d like to be able to kiss you whenever I want,” Tony said, voice rough.
The first thing Steve thought of when he woke was of the ring of purple bruises around Tony’s neck. Maybe he’d been dreaming about injured skin, about Tony; it made sense, considering how often the man was on his mind in the days since he’d first seen him on the street.
There weren’t many things about Tony that left Steve off kilter, but seeing him in polo gear was one of them.
“Cause he’s you, Anthony.” Steve smiled, it was small but evidently satisfied that Anthony’s eyebrows flew up in surprise. “And as infuriating as you may be, I care about you.”
Steve knocked their shoulders together as the man walked away. “Can’t let anyone gush about anyone other than you?”
Tony did, moving to wrap a hand around Steve’s waist and, after he was securely standing on Tony’s boots, the repulsors shot off the concrete. They were close to the tower, and he didn’t have to focus on the hold, knowing Tony had him, he could pay attention instead to the way the armor felt under his hands, the strength of it, the way that it made Tony strong. There was something about this man,
By the time he finished sorting out his clothes, Steve was in their living room, grabbing leftovers out of the fridge and putting them into Tony’s briefcase. As Tony walked towards the door, Steve met him, handing him the briefcase with a peck on the lips, the domestic scene a complete foil to the erotic display from a few minutes ago.
Steve was supposed to be finding what passed for a first aid kit in their hotel room, but instead he’d frozen at the sight of Tony, the bare expanse of his back, beautiful olive skin marred by the gut-wrenching marks, still fresh and bloody. Back in that dark, horrible room, with that revolting cage, Tony had hid them. Through the frantic run to Stane’s room, Tony had been by his side and he’d barely had time to fully see.
Steve swallowed, teeth clenching at the truth of it. He didn’t know what to say, because, if bound, an alpha and omega couldn’t bring charges against each other; the law viewed them as one. Steve wanted to tear their bond apart, even if it was an intangible connection of saliva and hormones. The phone in his hand buzzed again.
“Have you--” he moaned as Tony chose that moment to roll his hips. “Gah--Can’t think when you do that.” Tony’s chuckle was deep and satisfied, and went straight to Steve’s cock. “Didn’t think you thought about this at all,” Steve managed.
He had told Clint, he wasn’t ticklish but he had to find out for himself. Maybe he should try his feet or behind the knees. He tilted his head, James’ silent but his hands still wandering. Up, up, up, to his sides and Clint tensed, realizing what was about to happen.
“Don’t make me physically remove you.” Steve’s fists clenched at his sides, he wanted to shake this man far more often than he should.
It was cute. But they didn’t have time to play “You’re My Idol,” and Steve was pushing open the door already, looking over his shoulder at the seven young men.
Anthony shushed him from between his teeth, which swung Professor Rogers’ suspicious gaze onto him. “Are you two...together?”
Steve’s attention was still on the floor of the hut, but he finally looked up when no one said anything after a moment. Steve tried to catch Anthony’s eye first, a tense pull across his forehead as if he was willing Anthony to look at him. It didn’t take long for Anthony to cave and when he did Steve’s face softened and he stepped closer. Tony knew, if this had been his Steve, he’d be reaching for Tony’s hands right now. This Steve bumped his shoulders against Anthony’s. “We all know that I’m going to help him.”
There were so many of them in the field, he didn’t think whoever tended it would mind if one or two were missing.
Tony smirked. “Yeah, that. So it’s okay if you can’t like, you know, tell me about your life. Or don’t want to. Like, I get it. You might have a life, a family, or like a super secret job, or something. I don’t know what I’m saying, but I do know that I’m saying that you don't need to say anything--”
“I’m fine, really,” Tony whispered but he didn’t move away, instead Steve could’ve sworn he shuffled closer.
Steve wondered if the cage was new, if things had been this bad before. A hot roar of guilt didn’t break free--this wasn’t about him or his guilt or his anger--but how could he have never asked? He saw, he guessed, he objected and planned with Tony. But he never knew for sure.
Tony’s hand began moving without a second thought, his hand hardwired to listen to Steve’s voice when he dropped it rough and deep.
“When have you ever listened to straws when it yielded an outcome you didn’t like?” Tony asked, landing next to the pilot chair and lowering his visor, he lifted his eyebrow at Steve.
He heard the rustling of his cape, not wanting to take his eyes off his ticket home. “This metal circle?”
Stane growled. “You’d really let me shoot you for this used up, mouthy, piece of ass? He probably charmed you with promises of riches and his wet cunt, but look what he’ll go and do as soon as he gets a chance. He’ll run.”
Tony obeyed, lifting the lid of the box until he could see inside. On a satin, plush pillow sat the design Steve had sketched and the collar rested softly on top of it.
Steve flushed, but did. Tony wanted him to come, wanted to give him pleasure and it looked so beautiful through the camera. Steve took one last photo, before letting it fall to the side. One more turn of Tony’s hand and they both fell over the edge.
“Nevermind.” He nodded towards Steve. “He’s got enough stubborn in him to take on two of us, anyway.”
“Can’t we just tell them not to make eye contact with anyone but each other?” Tony asked Steve as he looked over the group, Jimin and Jungkook were already looking into each other’s eyes. “Looks like those two are ahead of the game.”
Tony smirked and shook his hand. “That wasn’t what I brought you down here for, though. It was just along the way. Just here,” Tony said.
They quietly walked around the corner of the green room, their reflections the only ones along the row of vanity mirrors. To the left was a closet with a closed door. There was a soft bang then shuffling from inside. Tony tried to think if the blueprints he saw had any air vents that led from the hallway to this closet, but the reason they’d chosen this green room for the group was because of its security--the shuffling stopped, a few hushed laughs and the door swung open.
“I hear Hawkeye--” Namjoon’s face lit up and Tony cut him off not wanting to hear anyone geek out about Clint right now, or ever.
They stood by the stage as the members walked through their songs. There were a lot of open vantage points, and it made Tony consider putting on the Iron Man armor, so that he could fly around during the show like he was part of the special effects, but that wasn’t in the cards, and ultimately unnecessary since the shapeshifter had to be close enough to make eye contact with a member of the group. He and Steve had to be vigilant and ensure that no one got close enough to look a member in the eye.
“Anthony?” Steve laughed, surprised. “Of course not, he’s been flying since he was a child. Oh!” Steve blushed, looking embarrassed. “I forgot you aren’t from around here.”
“Truer words,” Tony agreed.  He walked over to the desk where Steve had placed the stone, crouching so he was eye level. “When I bled on it, it didn’t open the portal immediately. I think it’d be best if you drop a bead on it and leave the hut right after. Both of you.”
“Help people? You think so?” Steve asked with a cream-caught-the-canary smile. “That’s quite a change in tune, Professor.”
“For us, too.” Tony gestured towards the bed, where his Steve had the sheet pulled up. He probably wasn’t wearing any pants either.
“Stay,” Tony said, pulling the blanket around himself as he nodded towards the space next to him that he’d been laying on. “Sit. I can’t do much today, but Obie’s gone and it’d be nice to have some company.”
“What?” Steve stuttered, hips jerking forward under the onslaught of stimulation. Tony pushed him back onto the seat.
It was the two missing members--Jimin and Jungkook. They appeared completely normal, happy even. The taller one, Jungkook, froze right in front of them, eyes glued on Tony, wide and full of fanboy. Jimin laughed, said something in Korean that sounded endearing though Tony had no idea what, but it made Jungkook blush and swat a hand at Jimin.
who Tony was. “Can you help us out in the alley?” Steve muttered quickly then moved Tony out the door, the pale-faced man following.
He had no idea who the pair were but he knew enough to know that he could find them on the internet. He knew the omega’s name was Tony and that the alpha was on the board of a company named Stark Industries. A company he wasn’t completely unfamiliar with, but by no means knew the inner workings of. With a couple strokes of the keyboard, he discovered there were seven people on the board and each one had a corresponding photo.
With only a tiniest reference to the man, Steve’s face broke into a bright smile. “Don’t tell him I told you this, because he already teases me about it, but his turns are even smoother than mine, you should see--There. How he leaned into the arc of the curve. When we get up there, that’s what we’re going to try to do.”
Tony shook his head. “He’s found me before--” Tony’s arm fell over the edge of the sofa and he knocked the floor with his knuckles. “I trusted the wrong person back then. He told his father where we were and that was enough…”
Steve shifted towards him, put his hands over Tony’s. “I can get you out. My apartment, or SHIELD, or a hotel, anywhere. I can keep you safe.”
Through the black night he climbed, silent in his movements even as the wind picked up. He made it to top, turned immediately into position on his perch. There was a man that HYDRA deemed needed a bullet in their head. The Soldier looked through the scope of his sniper, scanning over the building across the street, the white light windows each their own flicker of life, easily discarded when the Soldier determined they were not his mark.
He scrolled through the years, the decades, of documents and found nothing of use, but the search results seemed endless. Frustrated, Steve tried not to squeeze the mouse too hard. A knock on his door made him loosen his fingers before he left any lasting damage. “Come in,” he said, retracting his fingers from the mouse.
Between panting breaths, Steve’s hand reached into the dip of the bed, feeling for Tony’s cock as he thrusted it against the sheets. The hand closed into a fist around the base.
These Thursday mornings had become the longest day in Steve's week. It was the day after his every-other-Wednesday visit, and the day furthest from seeing Tony again. Still, the man completely occupied his thoughts. At SHIELD, Coulson had to call him twice before he was able to hear him and turn around.
The sun had set by the time Steve returned to the hotel. He thought about going to his apartment and calling Tony from there, but every stranger he passed, from the SHIELD offices to Brooklyn, he eyed with suspicion. There was the SHIELD driver who asked him too many questions when he dropped him off. There was the couple loitering with a cigarette outside the hotel, the concierge with a too friendly smile. All of them, at least in Steve’s mind, knew where Tony was, knew how to access him, knew how to get information back to Stane.
Steve smirked over his shoulder and kicked off. The broom pointed toward the clouds and they were off. Tony’s stomach dropped as they shot up, the wind hitting his face an entirely new sensation. But flying, he knew, and the joy of it built until he bellowed out a shout.
Tony's shoulders shook, and Steve growled low and angry before breaking off into a whimper. “I should’ve come sooner,” was all he said before he was in front of the cage, ripping the side wall straight off and reaching a hand out for Tony.
. But then (and now, he reminded himself) Steve had loved their time together too much to think straight. He wanted Tony all the time, in any way Tony chose to give himself. So he had kept falling into the pleasures of Tony, of him and Tony together, without seeing the risks.
It was the hum of a note ringing through the penthouse, long after the piano key was played, that slipped into Tony’s sleep and pulled him awake. He hadn’t woken to the sounds of his mother’s piano in far longer than he could remember. He stretched to the sounds of it, the silk sheets running over his naked legs.
He nudged until Steve tipped onto the rug, removing his own pants before standing with one leg on either side of Steve's, to take another series of photos. Then he slid down to straddle him. “I'm going to pull you out, and wrap my hand around our cocks. Do you want that?
Tony guided him around the couch that was pushed back to expose the large area rug. He took the camera from Steve and gave his shirt a gentle tug. Steve pulled it off and tossed it aside, warming under Tony's appreciative gaze.
The words caught in his ear. He’d heard them before, back in the 40s, in hushed tones, usually to describe an illegal abortion. Steve’s face must have displayed some of his horror because the woman smiled indulgently. “It won’t hurt your omega. We have plenty to choose from, from condoms--both for you or them--along with implants and suppressants.”
Steve had never seen a polo match before. When he came downstairs with a tray of refreshments, he stopped short when he saw Tony astride a horse. He was laughing at something another player had said, but everything around Tony seemed blurred to Steve.
“Think he’s learned his lesson, yet?” Tony asked, biting a line of kisses down Bucky’s throat as he kept his gaze seared on Steve. Steve’s body inflamed, breaking out into goosebumps.
Tony looked away, bit his lip. Steve could help, in so many ways, ways Tony didn’t even know. A new guilt slammed into Steve. In all this focus on Tony, on protecting him from Stane and providing him with friendship, Steve had failed to mention one important detail.
Steve wrapped his arm around Tony’s side, tugging him into a hug. “Look at that, our mothers make some beautiful music together.”
Tony's manic mouth started to move a mile a minute drawing Steve's gaze back up. “I had this thought, I honestly don’t know how I didn’t have it before, but it’s all I need to fix the cycling issue and even, dare I say, stop that pesky little short that happens if I go for a run and then touch metal while simultaneously running the microwave.” Tony tipped his chair back and tapped the fingers of one hand on the arc reactor, while the other held up the carefully shaped ring from the workbench. “Just a small addition to the casing. It’s genius, if I do say so myself, which I do, almost daily.”
Steve pressed his lips back against a smile. He had noticed Tony back on earth--his style, his air, the way he drew everyone’s attention when he walked into a room, and the fact that once he had their attention he did nothing but dazzle and impress them. Except, Steve had started to wonder, somewhere between the itch under his skin and the taste of Tony’s kiss, if maybe it wasn’t everyone that noticed Tony, maybe that was a sign of how he’d felt about Tony all along. But it took putting them into each other’s arms to make him realize how deep his interest went.
The citrus scent flooded the room as Tony sat up, his legs parting, then closing, then parting again like he couldn’t sit in one place, discomfort causing him to constantly move, shift, relieve pressure from his behind.
A warm weight under Steve’s arm shifted closer, back fitting against Steve’s chest and waist dragging against Steve’s hips. His body reacted, blood beginning to flow south and brain ticking to life--Steve jolted up and off the bed, tripping out of the exit of the capsule and hitting the spaceship floor hard.
“Probably about as much as you ever listened,” Steve shot back but it was interrupted halfway through with a yawn. In front of the pilot chair there was a deck of buttons and screens of information. One listed the countdown till “night time”.
“Tony.” Steve breathed and reveled in the feel of Tony’s hold moving along with his inhale, arms tightening around Steve’s chest as it expanded with it.
Steve’s thumb ran across Tony’s lips, then parted them and slid inside. The soft pad skated along the sharp edge of his teeth and then over the flat of his tongue. Tony opened eagerly, letting Steve push his thumb in, then wrapped his lips around it, sucking, showing him how good it would be.
Steve didn’t seem amused, instead he leaned in and ran a finger down Tony’s cheek, hooking it under his chin, lifting so Tony met his gaze. “What do you say, Tony?”
that Tony was currently in distress. He played out the worst scenarios as he ran down the hall. If Tony had taken on Stane, face-to-face, and lost--There was nothing Steve put past that vile excuse for an alpha. He’d forced his marks on Tony, violated him, trapped him, subjugated him. He had no idea what Stane would do to Tony once he rebelled.
He went to sleep that night only after tossing and turning for hours, the scent of Tony fixed fully in his head, evolving from scared, distressed and sour, to citrus mixed with honey. His hand wandered as he drifted off, wrapping around his cock on its own at the memory of happy, flooding slick wafting off of Tony as he sat on the chaise lounge. The memory of walking over to him, of leaning in and absorbing that smell, to bending over and kissing him--
“You're mine,” he spoke low into the space between them. “And I’m yours.” Tony pressed his lips together and nodded, eyes torn between Steve and the collar. “Hand it to me.”
When Steve slid back in less than an hour later, Tony was still asleep, so he left the cheeseburgers on the table by the door and slipped back out, fixing the Do Not Disturb sign on the doorknob. Adrenaline surged through him every time he thought of Stane, and he used it to propel him forward and move his feet towards the subway. The packed platform bustled around him, but Steve could only focus on the decision before him. One direction led to Stane--his hands felt the phantom urge of strangling around Stane’s neck, the tendons snapping under the force of his strength...It’d be so easy. The other direction led to SHIELD, intel and planning, time to strategize with Tony.
Steve, not Canada, so keep up.” Tony winked, then made the ferret dance some more, its slender body like jello wrapped in fur. Steve wasn’t even certain how they ended up here. There was a call to the Avengers PR line, an agreement that a Canadian zoo is a perfectly reasonable place to hold a meet-and-greet and Steve really had no one else to blame but himself, for ending up face-to-face with a domesticated polecat and a grinning Stark.
He blamed it on the van; the hippie stereotype so attached to its owners did its best to rub against Bucky’s rougher edges. Bucky hadn’t wanted the van in the first place, but when you’re only offered one getaway car, you take it, even when that car is a 1965 Volkswagen van.
Steve sat at the edge of the capsule and looked over a Tony from over his shoulder. “You’re the stowaway here, Stark.” With a deep breath, he lay down, his entire left side pressed into Tony’s right. His feet hung out of the edge of the capsule, knocking against Tony’s. He stared at the ceiling as the weight next to him shifted onto its side, facing the wall and Steve was able to settle into the extra space Tony had created.
And not just his chest. Tony was as affected as the rest of them by the summer heat. It was hard not to notice when he waltzed through the poolhouse, drink in hand, and somehow managed to disrobe into just a speedo without spilling a drop. A bead of sweat rolled down his back, twisting between the muscles. It looked like something out of a painting, the sun catching the glow of it as he led them outside.
“Quick study, Cap.” Tony grinned, enjoying Steve’s narrowed gaze. “I mean, Professor.” Tony ignored what the honorific elicited in the naughtier sides of his mind and made himself focus. “I’d hoped there’d be something around here that belonged to my world, to create a link. And there was.”
Tony looked passed Stane towards Steve, cheeks wet with tears but once he focused on Steve his eyes blazed to life. Stane turned his back on Tony, so he could face Steve. “You,” Stane growled, stepping closer and knocking his chin back as he surveyed Steve through the most superior gaze.
Happy heard the elevator doors open and looked up to see Tony and Steve amble in, still in pajamas, clinging to each other. Well, shit. He wasn’t expecting that. Not the two of them together, and not this early in the morning.
Every night, Tony had let him leave. But tonight when Steve pushed off from the couch, Tony’s hand wrapped around his wrist and he tugged him back to the sofa.
Tony hummed an affirmative sound, sliding his hand over Steve’s desk as he walked over to Bucky, his fingers a tease of dexterity. The moment Tony was within reach, Bucky’s arms came around him, a familiar sight, but that familiarity did little to ease the simmer of heat their embrace sparked under Steve’s skin. He swung his gaze back to his paperwork.
“Professor Stark,” a voice greeted from the hut Tony had barely registered as they were passing by. A very familiar voice. He turned, and Steve stepped out into the sun. He was wearing a billowy cotton shirt with tight pants that reminded Tony of breeches. He had on thigh pads, arm pads, and held a helmet under his arm. With cheeks flushed red and hair damp, it was more than obvious he’d been playing some sort of sport. He looked gorgeous. Tony felt his mouth go dry. “Rare to see you out here,” he observed without hostility, only neutral curiosity, though Tony thought he saw animosity flicker when his gaze trailed over to Tony. “And your….friend?”
Steve chuckled, low and fond. “Figured that out, maybe, from the dissertation you just delivered on my behalf. Which, thank you for. I do appreciate you defending my--if not my honor, then my existence?”
“I’m not in the business of raiding private citizens,” Steve replied, even though he’d like nothing more than to raid Stane’s apartments--not for tech, but to make him pay for what he did to Tony. These two, though, did not need to know that. He tried to lead the conversations into the things he did need to know. “Stane seems to be running that company with a singular direction.”
“Always putting on a show,” Steve mumbled under his breath, barely loud enough for Tony to hear it, but he did it with affection laced between the words.
The armor hummed as Tony spun and flew away, leaving Steve alone with his thoughts, which he very much did not want to be. Back in the cockpit, Steve kept his focus on the vastness of space. Thankfully, Tony found a similar and, unusual for him, sense of silence. The power of the endless universe did wonders for shutting up arguably the best rambler Steve had ever met.
It was like time froze while his mind ramped up to triple speed. He’d hit his head, the students waving at him, the hum of the ring in his hands. Magic. Concussion. Disturbingly familiar disturbed eyes, wide and piercing with shock and question.
“Yeah,” Tony agreed from the other side of the desk. A two-on-one assault. “We’re just protecting you from yourself.”
Silence fell and neither of them said goodnight, just let the day fall away and sleep overtake them.
Something twisted in Steve’s stomach when he typed Tony’s name next to Obadiah Stane’s but he needed to do it to get his search results. The twisting stopped like the precipice of a roller coaster and dropped when the webpage loaded.
“You’ll see.” That didn’t sound too ominous, and Steve let most of his major concerns fall away. Tony seemed well enough, healthy, and happy to be sharing this surprise with Steve. He was practically bouncing next to him, bumping their arms, and mixing their scents together. Steve had wondered once if Stane ever smelled him in the apartment, but Tony assured him he thoroughly cleaned himself and Mr. Jarvis descented the rooms they were in before Stane returned home. There was a pang in Steve's chest at that, at the thought of their mixed scent being covered by cleaning supplies, but he understood. Still, it meant that Steve cherished their scents freely mixing, in the stolen moments that they had together.
He’d preprogrammed his own number, and a few Omega Advocacy and Abuse hotline numbers. It was a blanket assumption, but Steve had seen enough to feel certain. He could count the bruises on Tony’s skin and the visible ones were half a dozen. He didn’t even want to think what sort of pain Stane could inflict to the sensitive skin hidden from Steve's gaze by clothing.
Steve couldn’t help himself, he tilted his head down for a quick, heated kiss before forcing himself to pull away. “A collar.” He undid the buckle, holding the blue leather braided around a thin chain out for Tony to see. “I designed this for you to help ground you, so I can keep you safe. I did some research and well... When the collar is on that means that you can float, drift. I can protect you; and when it is off, you remain in control. Would you like that?”
Steve had assured him, but what if Tony didn’t want to disrupt the balance that had formed? What if Tony had been worried asking would change things between them? Steve knew how fast he went down, saw the haze in eyes and the slack in his smile. The warmth he radiated that burned the cold out of Steve’s deepest corners. Tony was bright and bold and breathtaking. Tony was his.
“Tony, I--” Steve broke off with a groan. “Sitting through that debriefing was torture; knowing you were here, waiting for me, covered in my come and tied to our bed--Fuck, I’m not going to last long. Tony, so good,” he moaned, and then he was coming thick beads of come down his throat. Tony held Steve’s cock in his mouth, sucking lightly as he nursed the final drop, until Steve pulled out and wiped his spent cock along Tony’s lips.
The van had been doing its best, not stuttering against the accelerator as much as Bucky had expected. Slow and steady.
Anthony smirked, it looked to Tony like he was gathering his bearings from Steve’s confession. He sighed through the smirk. “Someone’s got to defend it, since you seem keen on throwing it away.” He knocked their shoulders together like Steve had before, and didn’t move away. Instead he looked at Tony, expression serious. “How sure are you about this?”
“He does his best to stay on the legal side of the line in the sand,” Rumlow replied to his phone screen.
Coulson fixed him a stare, a beat of silence filling Steve’s office. “He likes to trade with nefarious actors.”
God, this was awkward, but if he stood up and left now, it would draw everyone’s attention to him. Someone might ask him what was wrong and that was not a conversation he wanted to have.
Obadiah Stane was mere floors above him, so accessible yet completely untouchable because as much as he wanted to save Tony, he hadn’t been asked to fight this fight. All he could do were little things. Little things like slide the pharmacy bag from his coat pocket and hand it over to Chef Ana.
But instead, Steve zipped Tony back up and slid into the spot next to him. Tony knew he looked like Steve had just rocked his world, and Steve seemed more than satisfied by it. “What do you say, Tony?” Steve asked, voice taking on a low edge.
The match came to an end and Steve followed Tony with his gaze and then his feet into the stables. Steve made it in time to watch Tony dismount, leg swinging over the horse and sliding off with ease. The riding crop was still in his hand.
Steve reached out, a gentle finger against Tony’s chin. “But you’re not, though. Even when it would be so understandable if you were. It was inhumane how he treated you. But here you are, strong and whole.”
Somewhere in the floors far above him, Steve was sitting in their living room or laying in their bed or getting off in the bathtub, finger pressed on the vibrators’ controls as he thought about Tony. The unrelenting vibrations kept him hard and on the edge. His pants kept his arousal hidden, but he still stayed behind his desk, even though he usually tried to leave his office as quickly as possible, eager to be back in R&D, or with Steve.
“So I bullied my way into your bed?” Tony hummed. “Sounds like me.” He laughed and Steve was struck at how much he’d always loved his laugh, even when he wanted to punch him in the face. And right now punching was far from his mind. Tony’s laugh morphed into a smile, into a bit bottom lip, into his tongue coming out to wet the bitten skin. Steve knew he was staring, knew he wanted to do more than stare. “What are you going to do with me?” Tony whispered.
“Wanted to be the one giving you a gift for a change,” Tony said, his voice small, unsure, but hinting towards proud. “Look!” Tony rushed over to a cloth-covered object and pulled down the fabric. It was the chamber he never thought he’d see again, the one he stepped into small and came out of as Captain America.
Namjoon nodded again, this time looking a bit more at ease, maybe even relieved. “I’ve always wanted to meet you. We all have. We just…”
Steve stood, wiping his palms on the pants he’d been wearing for over twenty-four hours. Instead of answering Tony, he moved towards the cupboard near the bed. There were plastic sealed bags full of white fabric and Steve grabbed one at random, hoping it was something to wear and not a spare blanket. Without turning back towards Tony, he left the small dormitory and walked towards the even smaller bathroom.
“And here I thought you were just upset this latest mission came delivered on old-fashioned paper instead of email.”
Steve shifted from foot to foot, knew his face resembled a deer caught by surprise. “I’m looking for, um, something to help an omega. My, um, omega. We want to, uh, not have to worry, right now at least, um...”
Tony obeyed. He tasted a swipe of precome along his tongue and then Steve was pushing further into his mouth. Above him, tension drained out of Steve with each thrust. The angle was tough but it only made Tony want to try harder, to twist his tongue along the tip of Tony’s cock, to relax his jaw so the next stroke hit the back of his throat.
With the three of them in the alley, the man started to look around, back over his shoulder, concerned, suspicious. Tony slipped off the mask.
The penthouse was empty when the elevator opened onto it. This was only the second time he’d been here, and was still awed by its immense open floor plan. It smelled only of Tony because Stane summoned him to
Tony gestured for them to come over, watched his Steve’s face flash with surprise when he took them in.
Steve’s fingers didn’t even falter when he noticed Tony, he just moved over on the bench to give Tony room to slide down next to him. He played the final notes of the song, letting his finger linger on the last one, as he turned to give Tony a small smile. “My mother taught me that song.”
Silence filled the hotel room. Steve knew that good and well, but he wasn’t going to talk Tony into causing more pain to fall on himself. Not for Stane.
He heard the sounds of the armor behind him, probably Tony realizing the same thing: there was only one sleeping capsule.
He hit the highest floor he didn’t need a special key code for and waited, not letting the doubt or the what-the-hell was he doing seep in, and when he failed at that, reminding himself that he’d done far worse for far less important reasons. The doors slid open and revealed a sea of offices. On either side of the elevator bank were glass walls and doors, with the company running at full speed behind them.
“But it belongs to your world. And now it’s back. And I'm here too” The conclusion left him with an intense chill of fear. “With no idea how to return.”
Then he reached floor ninety and the doors opened to two voices that sounded very much like they were trying to be quiet but failing miserably.
The final chapter! Thank you so much to everyone who liked, commented, bookmarked and loved on this fic. It has been an absolute joy to share it with you. Thank you so much for reading! Come say hi over on
Tony turned his head to take in the white sky, another snow storm just beginning to drop its first flakes over the balcony. “We can come back whenever you two want,” Tony told the sky, breath airy like he was making a confession. “I liked bringing you out here.”
are a few of my favorite things. Don’t worry, Steve,” he turned back to face the sky, still making his way through the chocolate piece. “We’ll be back soon.”
He tried to infuse the sour scent into his memory, punched the pillow when he remembered Tony’s fearful retellings. How small and young he sounded, when he mentioned Stane wanting to fill him with pups. Steve growled into his pillow and turned back onto his back, fists clenched on his side and wishing more than anything he could punch them into Stane’s jaw over, and over, and over.
Tony chuckled and the sound warmed Steve, made him feel like maybe Tony didn’t mind him watching. Tony reached through the supplies on the wall for a brush and began stroking it along his horse’s side before looking over his shoulder at Steve and winking. “You should join us next time, bet you’d look even better.”
Tony shot him a half-smile. “Been hard to sleep since you ran out here to find a cure for my, what did I call it? Narcoleptic subspace.” He smiled and Steve met it with a smile of his own and then Tony’s eyes fell to the box in his hands.
Steve stood in front of the skyscraper and tilted his head up so he could see the top of it, barely visible on the cloudy day.
The mission was over. That usually meant they went their separate ways, decompressing before regrouping, but the Iron Man armor had been distracting during the battle and seemed to be after, as well. Steve had always found it impressive, but now, when he looked at it, he imagined the long hours Tony had put into making it, and it made him want to catalogue every detail himself.
Steve tried to focus on the conversation around him but his own mind tormented him. It was a charity benefit, he should be schmoozing. But all he could do was slide his thumb along its smooth, metal surface, feeling the tiniest of edges where the colors changed.
Tony pulled back, stepping away, expression shuttering and closing down in front of Steve. “You shouldn’t.”
“None of that made any sort of sense.” Tony turned his head into Steve’s neck. “But feel free to keep talking.” Tony bit at Steve’s collarbone and Steve shivered as he played. Tony chuckled, pulling back again just long enough to say, “Yeah. I think I found my staycation activity.”
Steve shook his head before replying, as if he had to physically remove the thoughts Tony had placed there. Tony smirked and made a crude gesture with his hand wrapped around the broomstick until Steve cracked a smile. “Just as inappropriate, too,” Steve noted.
With the lights down low, Jungkook blaring a solo ballad and Steve next to him, it almost felt like a date. Tony wanted to make it one. Linking their arms, he smiled when Steve looked down at him, eyes soft. He appeared to want to make it a date as well.
“Look at you,” Steve said, mostly because he couldn’t stop staring, now that he started. “The way your armor molds around you. I could watch you all day.” He couldn’t resist, not when Tony’s eyes were darkening with want. He ran his hand around to grip the back of his neck, right where the collar would rest, only now his finger could trace along the edge of the armor. Tony took in a shaky breath.
Tony took a deep breath and wished desperately for his armor, but at least this area was even more isolated. He walked down the hallway until it broke off with one path continuing straight and the other going left, he turned the corner left and slammed right into another caped individual, this one an adult, who had been more focused on the book in his hands than his own path.
. She shot Rhodey a look, pressing her lips together. Steve appeared to barely be aware of them, just as consumed by Tony. It was nice to see them both so relaxed.
Steve jerked at the thought--no, jerked at so suddenly having the thought--because the thought itself sounded kinda nice actually. The subject of his thoughts huddled even closer to him, probably out of concern from the sharp movement Steve had just made. Now Tony’s legs were pressed along the back of Steve’s as he pushed up, presumably trying to catch Steve’s eye. Steve clenched his eyes closed.
Tony’s heart raced as the pieces of the Iron Man armor formed around his skin. By the time they reached the end of the hallway, he was completely suited up. Next to him, Steve remained in his street clothes but his shield had miraculously appeared from a side hall closet.
He leaned back and Tony slipped his hand into his pocket and the vibration stopped. Steve gasped, somehow missing the sensation that had tortured him for hours. But then Tony was lifting off from his cock. His tongue licked at his lips as he watched Steve, catching a drop of come that he had missed. Steve followed his tongue, eyes glued on his abused lips. He wanted to reach out, could see the bulge in Tony’s pants.
As he walked, he thought he heard all sorts of sounds: the faint trotting of horse hooves, the scattering of spider legs against leaves, trees moving without wind as if they were in the middle of a conversation. A chill ran down his spine, feeling eyes from every direction pinned on him, but every time he looked over his shoulder, he was alone.
The day passed in tedium, again. Steve spent countless hours watching the universe out the window. The quiet turned from tense to calm somewhere after their afternoon meal but by dinner, Steve was back to fretting.
Natasha smiled and gently slipped her arm in Bruce’s. “You’re gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys,” She laughed and led him through the halls.
Tony shook under Steve, his hole tightening as tight as it had been when the Alpha originally pierced his cock into the omega. The spasms around his member became unpredictable and it became more difficult for Steve to maintain the harsh pace he had been spurred on to create. Long fingers moved from Tony’s lower stomach and up to his chest to squeeze a pec until the fingers became far more interested in the nipples. Sweat covered the omega’s body and spread itself across every point of contact they shared unfortunately for the Alpha who had yet to perspire from their activities.
Steve wasn’t sure how to feel about Tony Stark, right off the bat the omega made him feel uncomfortable speaking about sexuality so openly. Which was fine, Steve was okay with the progress, but it would take him longer than seven months to feel comfortable speaking that way about himself. The other part of Steve felt so much like a mindless Alpha with how intoxicating Tony’s scent was. The Alpha had only been this incensed by Bucky’s scent; it was an extremely alarming experience.
Tony finally gained the energy to dress back appropriately, walnut eyes assessing Steve far too closely for the Alpha to be comfortable. The super soldier hadn’t expected to lose any part of his mind and control, especially not to the point of taking and bruising an omega he barely knew for fifteen minutes. And the majority of those minutes had been spent fucking. Tony was relaxed against the door, still humming happily through the final ripples of pleasure. Once those far too intelligent eyes met Steve’s again, the Alpha dropped his eyes to the floor. A nervous tongue licked lips, smacked them together in an endeavor to think of anything to stay that made him feel better about completely indulging himself when he should have just removed himself from the situation.
But that wasn’t so easy and when Steve entered the lab Bruce choked a bit at the smell. The Alpha thought it was a little dramatic when the omega covered his nose and mouth, which only furthered Steve's thought when Tony just laughed. Tony was far too pleased with himself and the thorough scenting he had done to the Alpha, a large teasing smile plastered on his thin face. Steve felt slightly better when he noticed the pink tint to the sun-kissed skin until azure eyes shifted to a third person in the room that he hadn’t noticed before. Agent Coulson, who successfully pretended as though he couldn’t smell anything.
smelling Tony Stark. The walnut-haired man turned to face the new arrivals with arms out wide in greeting when dark chocolate eyes landed upon Bruce and Natasha, apparently, he already knew them. When those eyes realized there was a third observer at the edge of the lab his arms dropped along with his mouth.
Tony cleared his throat. Steve lifted his eyebrows in lieu of his eyes as he pressed the A button to plant the peach in the hole he’d dug. “There. What was it you said?”
He heard Tony smile. There was another rustle and Tony bent over him, their chests nearly touching, then the barest brush of Tony's lips against his. Tony spoke so quietly a non-superhero wouldn’t have heard a word.
Tony’s eyes were wide with fear when they swung towards Steve. He froze, then took one small step towards the corner of the hallway. Not towards his alpha, Steve noticed.
The cage was barely big enough for a large dog. Crouched low, Tony's shoulders brushed the crisscrossing metal that formed the top. He was naked and filthy, caked with dirt and blood and in the corner of the cage was the source of most of the foul smell that filled the room.
Anthony dropped his wand and stepped back, tilting his head in assessment. “Rather dashing, actually.”
Tony’s hands were scattered at first, flitting from place to place - hip, to shoulder, then back down to squeeze his thigh. The frantic petting began to calm, hands sliding slower and with more purpose. They caressed over the jut of his hip bone, along the side of his ribs and up to his chest.
He had to tell him the truth. “Tony…” They continued down the aisle, the entire floor of the tower, no walls or rooms or hallways, was jam packed with so much stuff it pulled Steve’s attention. “Wow.”
Tony spun the ring on the desk closest to him. “It’s weird hearing that accent out of my own mouth.”
pilot chair, scooting past Tony who balked at being nudged. It was months that they were going to be in space together. He ran down the long belly of the ship and hoped what he suspected was wrong, but as he turned to the one cabin he knew it was true.
The Jingle Bell Concert included many acts, but BTS was the grand finale. They started their set with
Bucky hummed as Tony’s mouth trailed from his lips over his neck, his dark gaze falling over Tony’s shoulder, fixing on Steve. “Yup. He’s choosing paperwork over us–” Bucky broke off with a moan. “Guess he doesn’t want us after all.”
A plan formed. Steve walked into the alley, pulling out his phone and keeping his focus on the screen as he approached the wait staff. He stopped near them, eyes on the phone, pressing buttons and sighing loudly.
Tony could do whatever he wanted--but Steve still gasped when what the man chose to do was paste his chest and thighs along Steve's back, bringing his hips right back to where they were when this whole mess had started. His forehead fell to the nape of Steve's neck and stayed there as his hands started to move up along Steve’s abdomen, dragging the sleepshirt up with them. “Let me know if I should stop,” Tony whispered into his neck.
Immediately drawing Tony’s attention by humming to himself, Steve traced his finger over the words on the paper as he leaned even closer to Tony. Tony had to hold his breath or else he’d be distracted by the sandalwood scent of Steve’s shampoo. They kept passing by doors that presumably led to private dressing rooms, and if he inhaled enough of Steve’s scent, he was going to want to throw him into one of those empty rooms, or at least find some hanging mistletoe, instead of focusing on their mission.
They turned the corner and Steve was face to face with a clothes rack full of his past: his Captain America cowl, his army uniform, his USO costume. His stuff was everywhere, boxes and bags of it, tucked away under his hanging clothes.
A jolt of surprise shot through Tony, for the fact that he hadn’t considered the option, and because Steve obviously felt some level of comfort with his suits enough to suggest it. Tony tried not to consider how hot he found that prospect.
“I liked kissing you,” Tony continued, and it took every ounce of courage Steve possessed to lift his eyes from his sketchbook to meet Tony’s clear and close and searching gaze. “Can I kiss you again?”
The elevator chimed. “...they’ll be upset anyway. I sent a goat instead of Iron Man,” Tony tucked his phone under his ear and headed for the kitchen. “I don’t care, I’m here in New York and-- Oh, Steve! You opened it. Pepper, I have to go.”
Tony looked over his shoulder and winked. Anthony winked back. Steve cleared his throat and blushed. “I--I can show you around,” he stammered. “If you’d like.”
A door opened midway down the alley. A man and woman dressed in catering attire pulled out their newfangled vape pens, standing on the stairs, door wide open.
Water fell down Tony in streams, torrents slicing from his hair over his face and neck. When he stepped onto the top step, he shook his head, a small smile accompanying the movement. The water continued its journey down, and Steve watched as it slid through the thin layer of Tony's chest hair, so different from Steve’s own. He found himself absentmindedly brushing his hand over his own chest under the surface, mimicking the trail of droplets.
Steve wanted to touch him, had wanted to for what seemed like hours. So he pulled off his gloves and closed one hand around his cheek, the other fell to his hand. Steve knew this armor, had watched Tony endlessly work on it with his own two hands, every plate of metal beat into his own design, hardening the torso strong enough to stop a laser. Steve’s hand pulled from Tony’s to run along the hard metal, to grip at the side of his neck. Tony took a stumbling step forward.
Tony sucked in a quick breath. “I saw you watching me all day.” He dove in and kissed Steve again, making it so that he didn’t have to reply, but his words still shook Steve. Part of him wanted to pull away and duck his head in Tony’s neck but instead he parted his lips and let Tony deepen their kiss.
Steve took a deep breath, the citrusy smell waffling between too sour and Tony’s normal honey-sweet, but tinting with a new, heavier musk. Just the one breath made him lightheaded, and he took the invitation to stand up and look around the books as an escape. Over the last couple months of visiting Tony, he’d never been in the library before. The shelves were endless and, it seemed, categorized by genre. He was in military history, both ancient eastern and western accounts side by side. “This is...wow.”
It was his mother’s diary, sitting uninspired on a shelf in the corner that broke him. A strangled noise broke from his throat. He staggered, Tony’s arm shooting around his waist to settle him. With his closeness came his scent and a deep breath did just as much to settle him as the arm. “Steve, what is it?” Tony asked, obviously worried.
Happy slid down on the couch, wishing he could ask JARVIS to teleport him anywhere else. Why hadn’t he gone down to the SI mess hall for lunch instead of the Avengers Tower kitchen?
Steve knew something was wrong the moment he entered the tower. For one, no one replied to his secret knock. After repeating it for the third time, he switched to normal knocking, which was finally answered by a harangued-looking sous chef Steve had never seen before. The mask affixed to Steve's face bore a new identity than the last time he’d come, which was the usual course of events, along with the secret knock and his well-known accomplices. None of the faces in the kitchen looked familiar.
“Oh, not aimed at you dear, you’re here doing it right, asking questions and seeking help. Only way to do what you’re doing better, would be if you’d brought in your lovely omega with you.”
Tony’s whole body tensed. The plug was designed to be unforgiving, able to shift inside Tony until the vibration rested directly on his prostate. It was a feature that made his cock twitch in the middle of the workshop all throughout the crafting process, and now the sensation was far better than anything he’d imagined. He gripped Steve’s arm. Remembering the dark glint in Steve’s eye when he slid the dark blue plug inside him--Steve loved this. Tony clenched, desperate, turning into a needy mess for Steve.
“Oh, Steve!” Tony greeted with surprise, cheeks flushed with exertion. He unbuckled the helmet and slipped it from his head, running his fingers through his wet curls. “You see me out there?”
On its shelves weren’t towels and sheets or clothes, but instead an array of sex toys--dildos and cock rings, some items Steve didn’t even known the name of. On the top shelf was a pile of lingerie, different colors and fabrics, and Steve’s mind unhelpfully put Tony in each of them, providing a perverse display of Tony being forced by Stane to show them off. He growled again, and this time Tony’s sharp inhale came from closer behind him.
“Lock the door,” Steve ordered. “And don’t let anyone in, even us unless they say the codeword, um, Gimbap. Got it?”
“--Stane thinks, at least. Whether the move to expand SI’s trade partners beyond our traditional allies is patriotic or not, it isn’t something I imagine is debated in the top floors of Stark Tower much.”
There was a long, tense moment where Steve was reminded of all the other tense moments between them, the ones that made his jaw clench with anger and frustration. But one thing had been certain: he was not going to let Tony Stark die. “I needed to catch you.”
Tony whined, nodding, and then Steve pulled out and came. Hot spurts landed across Tony’s hole, against the small of his back. Steve slumped onto his back, his rough hand reaching around, and Tony came to the feeling of Steve’s hand and his body rubbing his come into Tony’s skin.
It was a simple, mindless command. All the Avengers were in the common floor, setting the table for dinner. Natasha placed the silverware while Bruce handed Clint some bread rolls. Steve was ordered to the bar by Tony, and he followed the command automatically. It wasn’t until his hand curled around the whiskey, that he had the sense to blush at his eager reaction.
Tony removed the armor and slipped back into his plastic packaged sleeping clothes for the meal, and the itch under Steve’s skin sprung to life again. It was like Tony was a beacon for his attention, and Steve had no choice but to follow its call and gape at him.
Steve shuffled over to the couch, sitting on the edge as far from the bed as he could manage. Ever since he discovered Tony locked in the cage, he’d been running on adrenaline and fury. To have Tony turn away from his scent, so shortly after they’d come together...but it was neither of their faults. It was Stane’s.
Steve started to thrust into the air above his hips now, spurred on by the way Tony’s neck smelled and how he tasted when Steve let his tongue run against his pulse.
Steve saw red; he’d heard enough from Obadiah Stane. He stepped forward and grabbed Tony around the waist, pulling him back to his side. Stane sputtered, momentarily confused then he shuffled quickly to his feet, wide eyes crazed with panic. Stane pushed back his suit jacket and slid a gun from a holster on his belt.
“No,” Tony replied, closing his fist around the ring and watching the man wearing his face, this other version of him that went by Anthony, keep his gaze on Tony’s hand before his eyes shuddered closed. Tony continued, “But I’m starting to gather that this ring is more than it appears. A Horca--Horcru--”
Steve growled, low and deep in his chest. He’d heard of the medical exams, it was such a normal part of the omega life that he’d never really thought much of it, until now, like many things that had to do with Tony. Back in the forties, there were clinics in every city, it must be the same now. Though he couldn’t imagine Tony going to a public clinic. Steve's eyes shot to the chaise lounge and a mental image followed, one of Tony laid out on it, a doctor with a gloved hand opening him up, checking his slick glands and milking his prostate till completion.
James’ fingers kept their unrelenting tickling, both of them laughing as James leaned in close breath brushing against Clint’s ear. “Oh, I dare.”
A one-way bond was enough to tie an omega and all his assets to an alpha for the rest of their lives. There were some protections in place if another alpha was to touch the omega, but for his own alpha? There was little legal recourse.
“Of course he’s al--You’re not supposed to be here. Who do you think you are? What is it to you? He’s fine. Get out.”
I hope you enjoyed this chapter and thank you so much for reading. Sending you all a big, virtual hug.
Behind them the crowd that had been singing songs in various languages, picked up the names on the paper like they were all reading them in unison from over Steve and Tony’s shoulders. Steve’s blue gaze met Tony’s, pinched with confusion. The roar of names turned deafening until they ended with, “Jeon Jungkook,” and then there was a loud, boisterous scream that sounded almost near able to break the sound barrier and at once they started rocking the light sticks they all seemed to be carrying back and forth.
Tony pushed to his feet and looked towards his gauntlet, pressing a few unresponsive buttons before shaking his head. “For now, maybe you can give me a ride back to the helicarrier?”
He stopped in his tracks, would’ve dropped his grocery bags if they weren’t clinging over his shoulder. The alpha was on the phone and had stopped as well, pacing and yelling into the speaker, bits of angry spittle catching Steve’s eye. The omega’s bond bite looked fresh and infected. There was no partner bite on the alpha’s neck.
Tony did as he was told, pulling his belt open, unzipping his pants and sliding his cock out. It was already half hard in his hand from Steve’s orders and growing steadily under Steve’s gaze, every moment he was on display only making him harder.
Tony ran his hands up Steve’s legs, his cock twitching at the groan it pulled from Steve. Steve tipped forward until his forehead pressed against the wall, body angled over Tony.
. This incredible man that had stopped an invasion with a suit of his own creation and unparalleled genius alone belonged to Steve, and the truth of that was enough to catch his breath. There was blood on Tony’s armor but none of it was his own, Steve had made sure of that. Because as much as Tony could face down an army, Steve would shield him from the brunt of its force. Steve could protect him.
Steve barely looked like he could get past the fact that there were two Tonys, let alone grasp that there was something that connected their worlds in his flying equipment hut. He kept flicking his gaze between the two of them and Tony would have given up a significant part of his very large fortune to read this Steve’s mind right now. With his brow furrowing and his neck flushing red, Tony wondered if the thoughts were turning to the many,
Steve did. His breath caught in his throat until he felt Tony pull back his waistband. With his face pressed into the rug, he felt Tony’s hand brush against his bare ass. “So, very pretty. I want to paint this ass red one day. Would you like that?”
Tony’s day wound down, but Steve had kept winding him up for the entire afternoon. The vibrations from the ring and plug keeping him on edge. His last obligation of the day was a virtual webinar, live streamed from the SI auditorium into the screens at laboratories and universities all over the world. A few local, interested parties might show up to see it live, but it was never very many. Still, Tony took his place behind the podium and waited for the hour to strike five.
“I have to go,” Steve whispered, and before Tony could react, teeth bit into the ample cheek of his ass, and Steve contradicted his own words by sliding a well-lubed finger into his ass and saying, “Put on your collar.”
He followed it down the white-walled hallway. There were doors shut along each side and Steve found himself testing each doorknob, but all of them were locked and empty. Eventually, the scent started to fade and Steve pivoted on his heel and pushed open the door next to a stairwell sign. Walking up, the door to the next floor required a keycard, but Steve easily pushed it open and repeated his search on that floor, and the next one, and the one above that, every one was empty but the scent grew.
The wind hit his face like a slap but it didn’t take long, only a few strong beats of his wings, and he was under Tony, bracing for impact as the metal armor hit his arms.
Steve led the way into the kitchen, flicking his gaze over to meet Rhodey’s for a second. Rhodey swept his eyes over them again. Tony was never one to follow--Unless...were they…?
Tony looked down at his legs, took a step forward then another, hardly steady but still moving. “I think so. If any security guards see us, though. They won’t let me leave. Not anymore, with Ana and Jarvis gone--” Tony broke off, voice breaking.

The bell chimed as he pushed open the door to the pharmacy, later that afternoon. Behind the counter was an older beta, her gray hair tied back in a bun. “How can I help you, sir?”
When the moment softened and spread out but didn't break, Steve bent forward and pressed a kiss to the corner of Tony's mouth, enough cheek that they could write it off as friendship, enough lips that Tony could seize what Steve was offering but couldn't ask for out loud.
They didn’t have to wait long, as it seemed like the members were taking precautions and not interacting with anyone too long, or too closely. The sea of gazes moved along with the young men until they landed on Steve and Tony. It was only then that Tony heard whispers of people noticing them. Hummed recognition, a brief “Captain America and Iron Man,” but it was quickly disregarded as their Idols came nearer.
“Hello?” a hesitant voice broke in--Namjoon, Tony recalled. “Are you guys the shapeshifters? You’ve been out there for a while talking.”
, does not count as a luxury cruise.” Tony glared at James from over his sunglasses.  From the driver’s seat James shot him a raised eyebrow.
Tony had told Steve that the penthouse hadn’t changed much since his parents had been alive. He kept their family portrait hanging above the piano in the living room and Steve shuffled and turned away from Tony’s parents' posthumous gaze. He walked instead through the apartment to the large balcony with its attached swimming pool. Tony was in it, the sun shining bright overhead, and Steve forgot how to swallow.
Steve swallowed, answers to every unasked question flying around his mind but he could hardly manage to stammer out the one word reply. “SHIELD.”
“Is that what brought you here?” Anthony’s brow furrowed, so similar to his own when he was deep in thought. “The portal?”
Tony looked over the chess pieces, ignoring Steve’s hundredth offer of assistance. This time, his stomach churned because Tony didn’t know it all, the whole truth, and maybe he would want Captain America to tear down his alpha and help Tony break the bond he so obviously detested. Along his arms were bruises that Steve knew would match Stane’s fingerprints. The scent of slick surrounded them because, what? An induced heat or something similar. Tony writhing on the medical bed, strapped down and body wanting. At least, physically. Steve’s heart twisted, and it took Tony moving his bishop to a clever spot for Steve to snap back into the present. Tony was looking at him.
Steve made an offhand excuse about a special delivery then rushed through the room, pushing open the swinging silver door and moving into the hallway. Chef Ana’s office was across the hall, the door slightly ajar but the light off. He pushed the door open. It was entirely empty of all her personal items; all that remained was an empty desk and bookcase, a pile of folders and an office plant. Steve moved to the folders and pushed aside the top one, on the top of the second one was a postit with three words on it:
Tony laughed. “That sounds like a “you” job--Wait, date? Right. So we’re on the same page. I thought so too--Good.” Tony knew he was rambling, but happiness bubbling inside his chest tended to do that to him. Luckily, Steve looked endeared and before Tony could continue his ramble the solo broke into an upbeat dance number and both of them were pulled into the beat, moving and swaying to the bass.
“You’re insatiable.” Tony, sprawled out next to Steve, rested his chin on his palm as he turned onto his side. “I bet I can find a way to wear you out. Roll onto your stomach, let me see your ass for a moment.”
The man dropped them off at the curb and left with his new multi million dollar trinket, pulling away with a screech of his tires against the asphalt. Tony sat in the first armchair he saw while Steve went to inquire about vacancies. Luckily, no one asked questions, no one seemed to care. The benefits of New York City.
Tony shuffled up to his elbows. He could see through the open bedroom door, Steve in a robe sitting at his mother’s piano. Sun gleamed through the windows, casting a ray of gold over Steve’s hands as they danced over the keys. Tony grabbed the sheet, wrapping it around his body, walking into the living room.
Steve knew to avoid that floor at least, and hopefully his cover story would have legs, if he ran into someone else. The door led into a pantry and then the grand, stainless steel kitchen that serviced the entire tower. It was mostly empty, but there was a small staff on standby presumably for any meals that might come up.
Their counterparts flushed, and Tony laughed, extricating himself from Steve’s arms to walk back over to the portal. “I guess this is where we part.”
Anger balled Steve’s fists and the myths about alpha’s seeing red started to feel true because his clenched jaw was blurring everything, forcing it all into the exploding rage inside his mind, fixed on a singular person: Obadiah Stane.
Tony whimpered and obeyed, mattress shifting as it bore the weight of his palms. His cock bobbed out in front of him out of his open zipper, hovering over their comforter. His breath caught as Steve’s footsteps came closer. He couldn’t let it out again until Steve’s large hand pressed against his lower back, heat making its way through the layers of his suit to spark goosebumps along his spine. Steve lowered his hand, running its warmth with a familiar, possessive touch over his ass. One soft stroke slipped into the crease between his cheeks, and Tony did his best not to press back into Steve's palm, seeking more warmth and pressure. With Steve in this mood, he didn’t want to risk the man moving away entirely, just to tease him even more.
It was also undeniably clear that Steve had been underestimating the effort Tony put into his physique. His body was lean but sturdy, and his bare legs showed off thick cords of muscle sculpted from more than just piloting the suit. The arm Tony spun the tie around flexed as it bent, in a way that Tony's suit jackets and silk robes never highlighted. A flash of guilt heated in Steve's stomach when he thought about how easily he dismissed Tony as the weakest and softest of all of them. Tony's naked body, rippling with muscle, was clear evidence that it wasn't true.
“It’s not--You’re not the one who owes me that.” His words were harsher and harder--stronger--than Steve had hoped to hear.
Steve flicked his wand at the stone like it wasn’t a ticking time bomb. He caught Tony’s gaze and nodded reassuringly. “This is going to work, Tony.”
Steve’s hands flew to his fly, scrambling to get the zipper down, but when Tony tried to help, Steve pushed his hands away. He abandoned the fly half-way down to reach under his shirt and pull out his dog tags. He unhooked them from his neck and handed them to Tony, who wrapped the chain around his fingers and held them tight. Steve finally got his pants undone and pushed them down, rushed, wild.
Steve wanted to protest on his behalf, started to, because Steve had seen it all--the alpha stopping them to take his call, the omega waiting patiently by the window--their tardiness hadn’t been his fault, and even if it had.... But the look in Tony’s expression made it seem like he was used to being pinned with the blame, and with it-- By the sight of the bruises on his skin, Steve didn’t want to know what would happen next.
This time, he again smelled the lingering scent of Tony. It was almost stale, as if it’d been hours since he walked these halls, but the sour didn’t tinge as much, and there was no whiff of Obadiah Stane by his side. Alone, Tony’s scent lightened with tints of honey.
Within moments he was putting an arm around each of them and they were sinking into his touch. He took Bucky’s mouth as Tony’s lips found his neck. Steve’s eyes slid closed and after a moment Bucky pulled back and Tony was there, sliding his tongue into his mouth.
“Well, you did.” His focus drifted to Steve’s wings. “They’re beautiful.” Tony couldn’t keep the curiosity out of his gaze, and Steve knew one day soon Tony would have a lot of questions about his wings. But for now, Steve watched his expression ease as it floated from the wings to Steve’s face, the awe and surprise shifting to a soft affection. “Thank you for catching me.”
The force of Steve’s grip broke his mouse which thankfully made Rumlow shut his mouth before Steve’s fist had to do the job. Under his anger was one bright line of information: They didn’t know that Tony was missing, even if things were off at SI, even if the nanomask had turned up, they didn’t know it had anything to do with Tony.
The asphalt was hard underfoot as he ran, fast, down the street before taking off into the air, the suit forming around him, pressing into his bruised ribs.
He let out a heavy breath, and pinned Tony with a glare. "You think" - the camera flashed in a series of photos - "you know everything."
Tony laughed as he stood, walking over to the edge to peer over. “Don’t worry the stingrays are friendly!” he informed, before jumping into the water.
But he had, and he didn’t regret it. Especially now that Tony messaged him. His cheeks warmed as he walked and stared at the phone, completely focused on Tony’s pending reply. He barely stepped around a woman and a stroller, dipped to the nearest subway entrance and started down the stairs. He prayed he wouldn’t lose service.
Tony walked his hands up Steve’s chest, grabbing alternating fistfuls of t-shirt and sending Steve’s clothes into disarray, as he climbed steadily higher. Steve leaned into the pressure, feeling the searing heat of Tony’s bare chest against the now exposed skin of his stomach.
When Steve’s hand released his cock, the need was still there deep inside his groin, but it was easy to ignore, when Steve asked him to.
The inner foyer was empty, but there were signs of life coming from hallways and what appeared to be a great hall towards his left. Tony turned right, and found a narrow hallway with a small staircase that he took up to the second floor, halfway up it the staircase started to vibrate and move. Tony froze, hand gripping the railing hard until the stairs connected to another hallway and stopped moving entirely.
It wasn’t until the middle of the second act that Tony realized Steve hadn’t been entirely forthcoming with his plan, because he’d been waiting for what felt like hours, on edge and clenching, for vibrations that never came. Then a cellist led the strings into the next aria, and it happened, the plug jolted to life, as a smug smile crossed Steve’s face.
Tonight, the ship told them it was time for bed long before either of them started to yawn. The overhead lights dimmed in the hallway and turned off entirely in the commissary and cockpit.They both made their way slowly to the dormitory--the cubicle barely warranted the name--Iron Man armor falling away the closer they got. Steve watched as more and more of Tony was revealed and, compounded with the impending capsule sharing, ramped up the itch under his skin that had never really subsided. Tony was a spotlight that left as much as an impression in his eyes when he looked away as a blinding light, but instead of a dark circle imprinted over his gaze it was the strip of Tony’s abdomen, where his shirt lifted as the chest piece of his armor pulled away. Long flat lines of muscle that Steve was about to be lying next to.
He turned around to see that Tony had moved now and was standing in front of the cage with the sweater zipped up. It fell to the middle of his thighs, providing him with privacy and swallowing up his frame as he wrapped his arms around his waist. Steve felt a rush of warm relief, to see him standing, to see him clad in Steve’s clothes, to see his gaze raised enough to meet Steve's eye, even though it dropped away quickly. His legs were too thin, his collarbone sharp under the sweater.
Tony hummed in reply, for the first time all day wanting to hear the holiday carols instead of shut them out. Steve must have noticed a shift in him or had been similarly affected because his arm wrapped around Tony’s waist for the briefest of moments, squeezing them close as the song finished.
Maybe it was because he’d spent so much time behind the armor, or maybe it was because of their fight before their launch--along with every other fight they’d had up until that point, but Steve couldn’t help but face the undeniable truth that if it was any other member on their team, he wouldn’t be feeling so on edge. Only a sliver of space remained between them when Steve settled into the small sleeping compartment, and it was as if Tony had been waiting for him to lay down to curl off of the wall and into the unoccupied space, pressing right up against Steve.
Could he mean the nanomask? Steve didn’t let his eyes bug or hands shake even though he suddenly realized Coulson stood between him and the only exit. He tried to think of something other than the mask, something he’d read about in SHIELD’s files. “Jericho doesn’t seem like Howard--”
Tony sat in silence for a moment then shook his head. “I’m not leaving my family’s home. I can’t let him win that way.” Inside Steve roared, but he had to bite his tongue. He wanted to throw Tony over his shoulder and take him by force out of the tower. But he knew to do so would be against everything that mattered, would tear down the trust they’d built over these weeks, would ruin what they had built together in snuck away Wednesdays every other week and late at night text conversations. No. He was trapped here for as long as Tony was, but that didn’t mean they were helpless.
There was a briefcase Tony held sometimes. He used it when they assembled, or when he had a particularly precarious board meeting to attend. It contained the suit, iron man red, sleek as much as sturdy.
More than once, he considered picking up the phone and calling Fury, demanding that SHIELD intervene. And he would’ve, if not for a nagging feeling that Fury would be interested, more than interested, in adding the Stark omega to his collection of assets. A direct line to all that weaponry, to all the company’s connections--Steve didn’t trust him not to use it all to his advantage. Would Fury treat Tony better than Stane? Of that, Steve had no doubt. But Tony would still be under his control, and something about that stilled him before he made the call.
“Howard?” Steve easily recalled the man that made his shield. Tony nodded, presumably thinking that Steve only knew the man from the stories he’s told, maybe a webpage bio; Tony had no idea that he’d practically served with the man. His heart raced at the truth, the need to tell it to Tony, how anything he said right now would be a lie. His stomach clenched and he wanted to reach out and stop him as he walked away, down the main aisle.
“I need your mouth,” Steve hissed out, one elbow braced against the wall, head down. Tony tipped his chin up and met Steve’s fiery gaze. “Drop the tags if you need me to stop. I'll hear it.”
They came to a stop and Anthony swung his broom between his legs and took off like a rocket, up into the air, nearly vertical. It reminded Tony of when he blasted off with the Iron Man armor, leaving nothing but the kickback of air in his wake.
“Oh, it’s nothing. More often than not alphas come in without their omegas, and they submit prescriptions for much worse things for them than suppressants. The law, as they say, benefits the powerful.” The pharmacist sniffed, her cheeks pinkening as she changed the subject. “Anyway, you definitely don’t want to hear my opinion on Alpha Law, so let's get you sorted. How old is your omega?”
With arms back around Tony, his own voice muttered assurances Tony hadn’t asked for into the silent hotel room. Steve shifted them just enough so he could peer at Tony, whose wide eyes fixed on absolutely nothing. They’d won, but here was the cost of that victory right in front of Steve. Tony had killed a man. It was in self-defense and, in Steve’s opinion, more than justified. None of that meant Tony wouldn’t carry the memories of taking a life with him for the rest of his own.
One could argue, it was none of Steve’s business. The omega was obviously bonded to the alpha, even if the bond was one-way. That bite was all society needed to overlook the transgressions that Steve had witnessed on the sidewalk. But Steve wasn’t society, and waking up decades in the future, he’d been disappointed by what had changed and what had very much stayed the same.
The door slid shut. Steve’s stomach dropped and the floor started to rumble. Tony had the suit on entirely now, except the visor was left up, so he could glare at Steve, apparently. “You might as well take the pilot chair, since it's the
