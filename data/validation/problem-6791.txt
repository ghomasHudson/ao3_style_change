Because when they finally get to go home, he doubts the pain of it will go away. The flinches, the nightmares.
“I have heard many grand stories of your craftsmanship, Hephaestus.” Odin shook his hand. “It is a pleasure to finally meet you.”
They rise above each base with victories that should feel like a breath of fresh air, a break from the water their treading tirelessly to keep from drowning. Instead they just taste like ash. Bitter. Choking.
Everyone releases their tension at once when they get confirmation that it wasn’t real. Steve finally gets up and the recruits move to continue their exercises like nothing happened.
their relationship will never be the same, is a punch to the gut. He can’t breathe for a moment. Can’t think.
He wants to defend Steve and his usefulness, rant even. They should be grateful to have a man like Steve who fights with people who don’t believe in him, simply because he wants to defend those who need it and this is the only way to get there.
She clears her throat and then, because she’s Pepper, a woman every goddess he knows would envy, she sets her sights on bringing the asshole down. “I’ll start looking into the company. Whoever is doing this probably knows electronic filing would be caught fairly quickly. I can discretely check the physical ones we keep at our offices. There might be something there.”
- had a goddess named Athena independent of her, she decided to have another child (with another) as revenge. Zeus would surely pay attention to her then. After all, was that not the only thing that mattered?
Tony’s flight test yesterday was almost a complete success. There’s the icing problem, but it shouldn’t take more than a few tweaks to fix that.
They land in the woods about half a mile outside of the Hydra factory. Once Hephaestus finds Steve they move toward the building, silent other than the occasional break of a tree branch under their feet.
He’d been both beat and beat up by Hodge’s elbow on the obstacle course and placed last for push-ups, pull-ups, and sprints. But Steve hadn’t once wavered, not once complaining or falling out of line.
Hephaestus leaves a couple hours after Peggy leaves, once most of the room is too intoxicated to complain about his absence. Steve was, of course, the exception.
Some days, people from the other realms would travel to see what he made. The Asgardians in particular he remembers, because he gifted them something unintentionally (unwillingly). The hammer, Mjölnir.
It’s times like these that Tony wishes desperately for conversation, but he knows as well as the rest of them how that would be just asking to be compromised.
Even when he was a boy training with the other gods, he’d always preferred to stay in his workshop. At least there it was safe, free from pain and witnessing the destruction his weapons inflicted on others.
“Hephaestus, you must come quickly!” Ares rushed into the workshop. His appearance was not ruffled, like usual, but his eyes were startlingly bright.
“Then understand it somewhere else. If I read the posters right, you’ve got some place to be in a half-hour.”
He guesses it was true, but sometimes he really wishes he had the help. Memories of working himself into exhaustion and an aching feeling of loneliness creeps into Hephaestus’s mind.
The anticipated train arrives over the horizon, announcing its presence with an obnoxious, shrieking whistle. They jump into action at Falsworth’s signal and Steve is the first to attach his T-bar to the cable.
The first sound of a loud trumpet blows as Hephaestus watches the morning sun peak over the horizon.
With a final nod of derision, Hades flicks his wrist to reopen the door and snap the recorders back on. He leaves without another word.
(He doesn’t actually know what that looks like, but he heard Steve and some other soldiers talk about the 1932 film so he’s going to pretend it’s a valid claim.)
Hephaestus’s thoughts drift to Ares and Athena. They taught him so much, although their methods were often painful. He remembers once asking about taking a break to sleep.
If this is how the US treats their own soldiers, Hephaestus shudders to think about the internment camps for the citizens of this country.
“He’s the only one with the good kind of moxie.” Hephaestus hopes he can get through to Phillips. Because he just used
Tony heaves a dramatic sigh, but doesn’t argue. He hoists himself up onto the wooden beam next to Steve whose eyes gleam with humor. It’s stupid. It’s stupid and unfairly attractive.
As he follows Hades through the US camp, Hephaestus forces himself to look. For centuries he allowed himself to feed into destruction while being purposefully ignorant. He knew what happened on a surface level, but if Hephaestus ever wants to find peace within himself he'll need to face it directly. Face the direct effect of his own inventions.
Bucky doesn’t dare to step any closer from behind Steve. Shock renders both of them completely still. Tony, devastated at what Steve must think of him now, can feel his defenses flickering.
Bucky startles at his presence, but Hephaestus doesn’t look away from Schmidt. The latter tosses his mask away. The face wafts into the fire, consumed almost immediately.
“What? I… Sorry.” He blinks hard enough to make his eyes ache, then forces himself to look away from his past.
Today’s occasion, even if it’s technically for him, is going to be the same thing. That’s the way it has to be though if Tony wants to play the game.
Tony can tell the hinge will produce a horrific creak and quickly remedies it with a flick of his wrist. He doesn’t want to disturb the others and the rest they desperately need.
“It’s a valid question!” Rhodey attempts to defend himself. “Well, I mean, I’d be surprised if you know the actual date.”
Later that day, Hephaestus stands alone next to the furthest barracks. Artemis called the moon to gently settle over the sky a couple hours ago. The stars look stunningly bright without a such a heavy population of humanity.
) Questions upon questions build in his mind, but he forces himself to respond before the silence becomes too obvious. “You want me to look at it?”
Erskine smiles serenely at Phillips while Steve looks even more confused. Hodge, the sharp-elbowed bastard, peaks out from under the jeep, looking ashamed.
You would expect that it would be within the first seven thousand years of being alive that he would become bitter and distant, but in the short time he was human Tony Stark has been betrayed, manipulated, and kidnapped so many times that he’s developed a fucking complex.
“It’s swell. All the lights and get-up make a real show.” Steve lets his answer trail off and looks back at the stage. He looks like he wants to continue, but thinks better of it.
“Stevie wouldn’t stop talking about you, which would be enough, but you also got his six when I couldn’t. That’s something worth noting in my book.” Bucky takes a sip of his drink while an interesting dusting of red appears on Steve’s cheeks.
It should worry Tony how falling off the edge, releasing his already white-knuckled grip on that last sense of control, of sanity, isn’t anything more than an amusing thought.
The Colonel looks furious for a moment, and then he just deflates. Pepper’s resolve visibly breaks with it.
He got into SHIELD’s system almost immediately after stepping onto the Helicarrier. Tony is very aware he should really be joining the soirée in person, but he needed a chance to process the situation alone first.
The discussion with Hades was both unexpected and paradigm-shifting, yes, but it was also the cause of inspiration striking into his very being. Hephaestus came away with a vision so clear in his mind that he can’t stop working until it’s real. Until it’s tangible.
From the back of the Quinjet, Tony only half-heartedly pays attention to Romanoff and the conversation she has with Fury.
He looks down for a moment at his feet buried beneath the payment. His hand is shaking, but slowly he clenches his fist. Tony takes all of the pain and shoves it deep, deep down like he’d been trained to do for centuries on Olympus.
They quickly jog over to the tanks lined up outside the compound. More guards are around the other trucks, but thankfully they don’t notice them, too busy unloading shipments.
He doesn’t doubt that Loki has the ability to use the Tesseract, if not to its full potential, then much more than the humans that have been holding onto it for the last several decades.
Despite the lower stakes, it’s a virulent skirmish across the sky. Neither of them willing to back down.
He turned into a complete mess in front of Rhodey last night. An emotional outburst pathetic enough to earn decades of punishment from Athena and Ares.
“You really think so?” Blue eyes glance at him, and Hephaestus notices how the brightness returns to look even more stunning under the soft glow of a street lamp.
He pushes his only friend from MIT away because Tony is an undeserving man made of grief, cutting words, and alcohol. (
“Thoughts on the recruits? I know you’ll be turning in a formal assessment, but some general opinions would be appreciated.”
Hades shows up not long after the reactor is installed; neither comment on the absence of the battery, and Hephaestus follows the god of the dead up a wooden staircase. They emerge into what the younger god could only guess is a house (He’s studied architecture and buildings, but never this.)
Hephaestus lifts up his hand to watch a small flame he conjured dance on his palm, then between his fingers.
They all drop immediately, and an explosion just behind them rocks the ground. Tony’s ears ring from the blast. It takes longer than it should for his head to stop pounding and his vision to focus.
Standing at the same time, they make their way through the brush they were hiding in and onto the clear road. Forced into a run to catch up to the still moving truck, Steve and Hephaestus finally reach the bumper and hoist themselves through the curtains and into the bed.
Ichor is very different than blood in a lot of ways, but a major difference is that it requires different processes to move and work within the body. Hephaestus once found it immensely interesting how a little thing like ichor could change a man into a god.
“They’re claiming post-traumatic stress. Filing an injunction against you.” Obadiah pats his back with a sad smile. “They want to lock you out so they’re claiming you’re unfit to run the company.”
Howard, no Hades, (Hephaestus recognizes that darkness creeping back into his eyes) just looks at her for a short moment.
“One day however, Chaos begot the first gods into existence - Tartaros, Gaia, Erebos, and Night. They were the first beings in existence, and although a few more beings emerged, they were all responsible for a more primitive time.
Tony just manages a brief nod toward Loki. He commands his weaponry to detract with a quick thought and waits with baited breath at the sound of heavy boots on gravel.
“Don’t worry about it, happens all the time,” the voice has a distinctly casual accent to it, and slowly Hephaestus looks down into a pair of large blue eyes. It’s a young man, small and frail and stunning.
Maybe it's because Tony’s soul is whole again. And once upon at time in 1943 he appeared this way underneath his glamour and just didn't realize it.
So really, Tony can’t bring himself to be that upset with Bucky. He can respect a guy who also finds the aversion to homosexuality to be completely ridiculous.
Tony buries his face back into the man’s neck to hide the tears welling up in his eyes. Gods, what did he do to deserve Rhodey? “Thanks.”
Steve’s voice is soft now, as if trying to preserve the calm that settled over them. “Earlier today, I asked Dr. Erskine why he chose me.”
“All right. If you need me to pitch them something...” The concern in his tone isn’t fake, but the resigned trust is.
Literal translation: "Yeah, you should turn your tongue around in your mouth seven times before you speak. The outfit doesn’t make the monk." Essentially, you should think before you speak because appearances aren't everything.
Tony fights a smile and looks at him over his tinted sunglasses with a pointed look. “You sure you wanna know?”
“You are a disaster.” Tony shakes his head, but a fond smile sneaks onto his face. “Get away from the cars or you’ll be recycled into one.”
He remembers getting them the first time and the pain of war that flashed through his mind. There were several moments throughout his time with the Commandos that he unconsciously grasped at the metal until his hand stung.
Steve, who is an asshole, immediately catches his concern. A teasing grin creeps onto his face. “Aw, you worried about me?”
The impact sends him flying backward, and he can’t tell which way is up for a few disorienting seconds.
He curses himself for not catching the danger sooner. He knows it wouldn’t have done any good because of course, warning the others is out of the question. Especially if he wants to keep his more than human status a secret.
Steve beams. Before Hephaestus can recover his breath from the force of that smile Steve gives him a quick hug. The bastard keeps grinning and lets go to jog over to the entrance of the Electra. “You coming?”
The world knows that he’s Iron Man. With the responsibility and eyes on him right now, Tony can’t afford for them to question his capabilities any more than they already have.
With an early meeting time scheduled for the next day, Tony shifts his car into drive and peels off into the street.
Because it’s easy to get lost in the what-ifs, he knows that, but Steve can’t help but think about what went wrong. He can’t help but think about how he could have prevented such an unprecedented tragedy.
Years were spent sparring the god of war and goddess of wisdom, because Zeus began to notice the impeccable nature of his work.
That one word is all it takes to make Hephaestus's excitement, his small hope, more than a naïve fantasy. He picks up his previous thought process aloud. “Well, at its most basic, combustion engines are giant air pumps, pushing air in, mixing it with fuel and igniting it.”
It’s a slow, but peaceful couple hours. Usually Tony wouldn’t appreciate the time alone with only his thoughts. Oddly enough though, the walk calms them instead. Tony chooses not to question it.
Hephaestus just tried to stay away from Ladon, the hundred-headed dog that never sleeps. Hera got the beast to guard the tree from any mortals wishing to steal from her.
He hasn’t felt this good, this powerful since before. When his life was training, weapons, and only learning about life outside of Olympus from books and the stories others told.
Hands flip through the pages in a familiar way before opening on a drawing of a monkey on a unicycle. The animal wears a matching outfit to Steve’s and although Hephaestus knows he’s being shown the drawing to find the humor in it, he just feels sad.
Maria Stark looks at Howard, a disapproving frown on her lips. “Be nice dear, he’s been studying abroad.”
.”) looks shiny and grand, but Hephaestus could spot errors within the mechanisms immediately. He actually tried to tell Hades, but to his frustration only got waved off.
Moving quickly with heads ducked down, they manage to make their way through and onto the roof without any more problems. It doesn’t take long for Hephaestus to find a lock for one of the roof entrances.
Hermes doesn’t stop him and Tony just thanks his lucky stars he doesn’t have to deal with that today.
“It’s been hard getting used to drawing again, new hands and all, but I think I finally wouldn’t make my old art teacher cry if I showed this to her.”
He knows he'll have to produce a new glamour to keep up appearances, but it’s striking now to look at such a physical reminder of who is. Not Tony Stark, the mortal weapons manufacturer, or Hephaestus, Olympus's personal inventor, but a god who has been hidden among men.
Where his hair before was the color of umber, usually slicked back in a style that fit in with the other men of the 1940’s, now it's back to its natural black. Tousled in a way that leaves curls falling into his eyes.
Any other time it’d be easy to answer with a quick joke. Banter is imbedded into almost every conversation he has nowadays. Something about tonight though, is different.
Steve slides into the seat directly in front of him. “Oh. Okay. Uh, thanks.” He then raises a blonde eyebrow, “Special division huh?”
Phillips points to the rank insignia on his collar without looking up from his paper work. “You don’t get to give me orders,
He must've caught an expression on the boy’s face because he held his hand the whole way to the throne room.
“The Titans…” Tony trails off. “Being Tony Stark, hiding in plain sight, might be the only thing keeping me safe then.”
“You guys still don’t get it,” Tony says, his voice beginning to raise into a desperate crescendo. “I’ve been locked out my own company. There is nothing else. There’s no board meetings. There’s no benefit. There’s nothing to sign.” He takes a deep breath. “There’s the next mission and nothing else. There’s nothing except this.”
(Tony remembers France and the soldier no one noticed until Steve turned, eyes cold and vicious, to knock out the hidden enemy with a powerful swing of his shield.)
Hephaestus thinks it's because on the young man's pale, angular face, despite sporting a painful looking black eye, he keeps his chin tilted upward in challenge.
“Why do you not ask Hephaestus what he did today?” Hera spoke evenly. But daggered eyes were aimed at Zeus.
So, when Thor throws Mjölnir with violent intent, Tony takes a deep breath, then a gracious step to the right.
The entire hearing with the Senate Armed Services Committee is a sad attempt at getting him to hand over the armor.
Steve understandably startles at his suddenly serious tone. Something must be invading Tony’s expression, because Steve’s eyes suddenly turn very soft.
Slowly though, a sharp smile begins to grow on Pepper’s face. It turns into something very dangerous. “Now let’s go get this son of a bitch.”
Hephaestus thought that Athena just did not see the point in emotion at all. Her gaze was a piercing silver, calculating and cold. If he was with her for too long, Hephaestus could not help but shiver under it.
Because while she was the sun and the bringer of life, a star that has to burn out eventually or she’ll destroy that brightness forever, he was a constant. Crisp suits and supportive pats on the back.
“You had quite a fall there.” He smiles warily, “I did the best that I could, but I’m kinda in a tight spot right now.”
So Steve shouldn’t be doing this. But he’s Steve. And if Tony knows anything, it’s that Steve has a no sense of self-preservation or issues with attempting to offer comfort even if it ends with a punch in the face.
“Just a bastard nobody wants. I wonder how desperate Hades must have been to abandon you so quickly.”
(It’s safe to say that his tastes have changed a lot since that first time he tried the drink at Camp Lehigh. Tony chugs the stuff now like it’s liquid ambrosia.)
“Tony, I’d like you to meet Doctor Abraham Erskine.” Howard’s smile is wide and his eyes look much softer than they have all evening.
The GI’s are only at this camp to receive more orders before returning to the front. It should be a reprieve in theory, but the conditions look so horrible that he doubts that’s even possible. Soldiers seem to own almost no possessions and a lost limb revealing uncensored gore isn’t an uncommon sight.
It isn’t always so suffocating. Tony thinks it’s when the silence casts over them, thick and unyielding, that the ghosts threaten to take the soldiers down with them.
. And the more he thinks about it, the more he sees his mother doing nothing to stop his fa-Zeus’s rampage.
It’s only been within the last several days though, that he’s been coming to terms with what that means. It’s a name that carries so much pain and resentment.
Met with confusion, Hephaestus elaborates. He looks straight into Steve’s impossibly blue eyes and hopes the truth in his statement rings clear. “Steve, you’re already a hero.”
“I didn’t realize I was the subject of such intrigue.” Hephaestus jokes, hoping the nervousness in his voice isn’t audible.
He knows palladium works, but the side effects are severe. He stalled for a couple of hours, debating the reactor, but eventually gave in.
He hears himself say “Ma’am,” following Bucky’s lead, but his eyes are glued to the god disguised as Howard Stark.
Genuinely confused, Hephaestus looks at Steve, a crease between his brows. “What are you talking about?”
“I am more than just thinking about it.” Erskine looks at Phillips with a casual confidence, “He is the clear choice.”
Hades just smiles. “Came by to say I’ve got some equipment for you to try Captain. If you’ll come by tomorrow morning?”
Steve is buttoning fatigues over the Captain America costume. Hephaestus is studying the map, attempting to be of some use considering he’s supposed to be a Lieutenant.
So after the snap, Steve sat beside Vision’s body for a very long time. His throat was thick with blood and dry from the ash. He remembers choking on it, being suffocated by it. They had fought as hard as they could.
Tony makes a vague noise of affirmation and eyes his friend with blatant suspicion. It’s partly because of his presence, but mostly because of the chipper attitude.
The moment Rhodey grips his shoulder Tony deflates in relief. God or not, the trek through the desert was brutal. He walked through the sand for
Soft curls bounced, reflecting almost blue hues in black hair. Already sharp, sharp amber eyes snapped into focus.
“Ah, no matter.” Stane continues, as casual as if they were discussing the weather. “Meet me on the roof of the testing facility in half an hour and I’ll think about sparing your military boy and pretty assistant. I’m sure you know which one has the reactor.”
Hand repulsors and unibeam engaged, he fires at Thor with enough energy to return the favor and then some.
“Well, Phillips realized he wasn’t getting the army he was promised. It’s just me. From the way things sounded it was either this or being stuck in a lab.”
Tony can’t stand over half the people in the room most of the time. Not to mention, the Vanko situation really wasn’t that long ago.
He can only bring himself to nod before getting up to follow her out of the workshop and up the staircase.
The flight is long and the tarmac when they finally land reveals Happy and Pepper, whose normally flawless face is streaked with tears.
Steve, with a face serious enough to win any poker game says, “Sure. I’ve knocked out Adolf Hitler over 200 times.”
He flexes his hand and the armor beneath his skin seems to hum even louder. It isn’t logical. The suit is housed in his chest, but fuck, sometimes it feels like metal is imbedded into his very
However, the memory of that night slips through. Flashes of slightly chapped lips and calloused hands brushing his cheek.
Looking at Steve makes him want to believe he can be more than a creator of unprecedented destruction.
The pleasure of holding something he created in his palms. The soft glow of heated metal. The intricate beauty of magic and labor fitting together precisely and working in tandem.
“As soon as you’re done call me. I wish more than anything else that it didn’t have to be this way, but it does.” He tries his best to give her a reassuring smile. Tony doubts he succeeds, but Pepper nods anyway. “Rhodey, could you drive her?”
It was obvious from the start how physically different Zeus and Hephaestus were. The whispers grew louder, and the small boy shrank into his seat.
In that cave, among the heat and dust, in the endless glare of metal and terror, Tony took control of his own life for once. He chose to live and made a vow to Yinsen that he wouldn’t waste another second being indifferent to the suffering wrought by his own inventions.
“Don’t tell me you’re having second thoughts about your decision.” Pepper eyes him like she’s calculating how far she’d have to throw her stiletto for it to hit him.
Considering how conflicted they both look, he’d bet Jason’s Golden Fleece on this being about who to choose for the project.
Death isn't kind. Hephaestus knows that. He does not pretend to care, or pretend to distinguish. There is no difference to him in what he can and cannot take.
He firmly tells himself to focus and after a few seconds looks up. Steve’s eyes are still downcast. “Not that I don’t enjoy a good dancing monkey, but Steve?” He waits patiently until the other man looks up to catch his gaze.
Because that suit, even with all its flaws, is a way for him to directly destroy every weapon Stark Industries made without his powers.
Keeping the faceplate on once they got to the Helicarrier would be suspicious as fuck. He’d probably have SHIELD pouncing on him faster than you can say Fury.
How different are they? Truly? He knows he’s different from other Olympians because of his fire and forgery skills, but no one ever talked about the difference in physical strength between the immortal gods and man.
After so long, the only conclusion he’s come up with is that he needs to resign himself to Hades and his odd behavior.
The tense lines of their shoulders are at odds with the peaceful landscape around them though. Tony easily falls into formation with Steve leading the team through the forest. Guns drawn, their eyes scan for any sign of a potential attack.
bombard his mind. If he’s being honest, the cause of his worry isn’t the intrusion itself. Hades is Hades. His dramatics and unpredictability are nothing new. He’s worried because this time Hades wants to involve Steve.
He doesn’t know what Artemis is up to, but the moon is full for the second time in two days, reflecting off the layers of ice in a glow that makes the sky look more purple than its usual inky black. He can clearly see the brittle, naked limbs of a few trees that stretch high despite the unforgiving season.
“Hephaestus, have I not been the one telling you to enjoy food more? I only want what is best for you and your relationship with Zeus. Our father?”
It’s probably too much to hope that Tyche is on his side for this one, but he really has other things to worry about for the moment. Tony prays the goddess will give him a break.
“What do you want me to do? Build them their weapon?” Tony scoffs. “They’ll kill us either way. Not to mention, my own personal countdown. I’ll last until the end of the week.”
Tony leans forward and begins to wrap the whips around the armor in a messed up version of cat’s cradle. Step by agonizing step, he pulls.
. Not only did Hephaestus let a crazy, power-hungry mortal get away with the power source, he did something that should have been impossible for any mortal to survive.
The source of the alien power is in the facility. He doubts he has time to find it without revealing he’s not as mortal as he pretends to be.
The place is packed, Hephaestus suddenly notices. The brightly lit building is loud and its benches are almost completely filled.
"Buck and I," he nods to the military man Hephaestus noticed before, "agree the man is a complete character, but I don't know. I can't help but be grateful for the reminder of a future beyond war. Sometimes it's easy to believe that the fight will never end." Steve's eyes look pained as they continue to watch his friend, before he forces himself to turn away.
Tony puts down the Sten he was methodically cleaning when their voices carry over from the tree lining. The bickering and unrestrained laughter wash over him. Some would probably hate how the noise crashes and drowns out everything else, but Tony loves it. He loves getting carried away with it.
He could feel the Arc Reactor pressing painfully deep into chest from the moment he woke up. Tony assumed it was little more excruciating than usual just because of his disorientation and the sudden transfer of the thing into his body again. Which is another piece of the puzzle in all of this. The reactor must be attached to his soul.
Acting quickly, Hephaestus puts back on his shirt and stands from the small cot. When he’s positive the light isn’t visible and he looks otherwise decent, Hephaestus calls for the visitor to enter.
Other than his ongoing hunt for Stark Industries weapons, it isn’t until April that things start to get interesting.
A quick combing through his systems didn’t reveal much. The only thing that warranted suspicion was a cryptic message sent by Fury’s phone.
“Overnight.” Tony blinks. “The packet, Selvig’s notes, the extraction theory papers.” Tony pauses and gasps loudly.  “Am I the only one who did the reading?” He looks around, scandalized.
When Schmidt straightens up, a feeling of dread rushes through him. He can spot the smile on Schmidt’s face from where he’s standing.
Tony isn’t stupid enough to be caught off guard twice. Since the gala incident, Tony has implemented plenty of new upgrades and precautions to guarantee his suit won’t short out again.
If there’s one thing he’s learned in the last seven thousand years it’s that nothing important ever comes without a cost. A cost that for a while now, has been a “Hephaestus Original.”
He knows it doesn’t mean anything to him personally, but sudden flashes of bodies and blood and death invade his mind anyway.
It’s faint, coming from outside the concert hall, but it puts a chill through his bones all the same. He can sense there’s another Arc Reactor outside.
With his eyes and facial hair, he doesn’t look like First Lieutenant Antonius Collins or the god Hephaestus.
Phillips stares at Hephaestus. “You put a needle in that guy’s arm, it’s gonna come out the other side.”
But damn it, maybe they’d understand if they knew part of the horror he’s been through, and what made him make such a reckless decision in the first place.
Hephaestus lets out a surprised laugh and knows his wonder is blatantly obvious, but how could he expect to feel anything else? He's never thought about science and progress in that way before. Sure, it's something Hephaestus loves, but for the first time ever, the god feels a bit of pride in that.
“What, are we taking everybody?” One of the men say, clearly talking about the Asian man released from another cell.
But with the previous display of magic and obvious dismissal, he’s beginning to realize to what extent of trust Hades is expecting him to willingly give.
As predicted, a month passes in complete solitude before the machine is done. After, Hephaestus finds himself sitting alone for lunch. The rations have gotten worse if that was even possible, but he shovels it down anyway.
And what is he supposed to say to that? Damn it. “You know I’m allergic to emotions, buddy. Stop it.”
Hermes takes a second to follow Hephaestus’s rapidly shifting thought process before carefully replying, “Nothing. It’s true that the plan will be mutually beneficial, but not in the way you think.”
Less than twelve hours ago, in the middle of the shareholders meeting Tony was forced to attend, something in the atmosphere shifted. Something became off in a way that made his skin crawl.
The others have gone out to see if the local village will spare them some supplies (Read: liquor.) while Tony volunteered to stay and watch the temporary camp they made.
Of course the bastard doesn’t reply. All he gets is a suspiciously bland smile before the slick suited son of a bitch pushes past Hephaestus and into the room. He closes the door behind Hermes anyway (what else can he do?) and waits to hear what the fuck is going on.
Steve returns the grin and walks back over to take the empty seat next to Hephaestus. He would wonder why Steve is choosing these men, but from the easy camaraderie he saw between Bucky and the others, it’s likely because of a glowing review.
But then Hephaestus remembers that would support him as the volunteer. The volunteer for a man-made machine that likely won’t work correctly, considering the other technology he’s seen.
It doesn’t work, but then again, he knew it wouldn’t. That’s what happens when you’ve been put through the wringer emotionally.
Tony is more than practiced at doing his own makeup for press conferences, but Pepper insisted she do it herself.
“Hello. How can I help you?” A young woman stands with a polite expression on her face. Blonde, with sweet heart lips and clear blue eyes.
“I– ” Tony has to take a couple shaky inhales before his voice sounds somewhat close to normal again.
The workshop is cold, even with its regulated air system. Tony finds himself slumped on the concrete floor with his back against a beat up couch.
He grabs the bag strapped across his shoulder to pull out one of the two transponders he was fixing right before the flight.
He has no idea if the man is mortal or a god, but he watches him slowly walk closer to the bed from where he was standing across the room.
“I’ll take care of the rest of your identity, so you don’t need to worry about that.” Hades speaks without turning around, and gestures for him to walk faster.
Tony sits up slowly and runs a hand through his hair. The room spins for a moment before righting itself.
“I’ll start up the plane,” Hades says. He turns with a wink in Hephaestus’s direction and doesn’t turn around to see if the two other men follow.
Many of the gods (of course) thought them to be weak. Inferior. But he could not help but be curious.
The audience begins to whisper in excitement, and the other women on stage grin while taking off all of the wheels. “Yes, thanks Mandy.”
“Of course you are. I just worry that you’ll get caught up in your head. You have a tendency to get off task.”
Too slow and too fast at the same time. Tempestuous, loud, and too bright. Too fucking bright sometimes.
Jones attempts to defend himself. “Figured you’d need the help. Like you said, the thing wasn’t exactly an American Buick.”
Tony, let’s remember, has already been on edge for the last twelve fucking hours or so. Despite all of that, he refuses to admit any discomfort to a complete, more than untrustworthy stranger.
Hephaestus shakes his head and laughs. It’s one part disbelief and one part complete amusement in the face of this ridiculous, brave man. Bracing himself to follow, Hephaestus takes one last look at Hades. He doesn’t really know what to say to the man who is supposed to be his father.
“You know, the last time I was in Germany and saw a man standing above everybody else, we ended up disagreeing.”
“I was just thinking,” Rhodey puts down his drink. “Your birthday isn’t really on May twenty-ninth, but do you even know when it actually is? I can’t imagine gods having birthdays.”
Tony debates with himself for a moment. He really isn’t wanting to involve himself any further in SHIELD’s business.
Bucky and Steve stand on either side of Tony in defensive stances. They don’t have to know what’s happening to understand the threat in that statement.
The Titan’s smile only grows wider in response. “Your time will come. Tell me Hephaestus, do you believe you’re any stronger than when you began? Dependency will be your downfall.”
“Wow that’s…” Steve looks so genuinely awed that Hephaestus has to immediately break eye contact after sneaking a glance upward. “That’s amazing, Tony.”
“I’m looking forward to working with you.” Doctor Erskine says with a crisp, heavy accent, and holds out a calloused hand to shake. Howard had given him all the scientific research done so far for the war effort. It would be an understatement to say that Erskine's had the most potential.
Hades sighs. For a brief second something seems to crack and Hephaestus catches flashes of far too many emotions to differentiate. What he does recognize overall though, is the fear Hades is hiding underneath his usual stone-like neutrality.
“I knew it, but I didn’t want to believe it.” Tony chokes out an ugly laugh. “People like you are what I hate about the most about humanity.”
“That’s amazing, kid. Also nothing I could have thought up on my own.” It’s startling to realize that the words don’t sound malicious at all. Hades sounds
“Oh I’m sure you’re such a hot shot.” Morita lightly shoves Falsworth away, sarcasm heavy in his voice. The man in question rolls his eyes without a response, but he catches Tony’s eye and winks with conspiratorial smile.
It’s extremely disconcerting that he can’t get rid of it entirely, but considering his priorities at the moment, Tony is just grateful that it’s easier to ignore now.
Tony taps his fingers against the Arc Reactor in a vain attempt to get rid of his anxiety. Because what he just felt? That was an amount of power that he hasn’t come across since 1945.
After shrugging on all of his clothing and running a hand through his hair a couple of times, Hephaestus opens the door to make his way toward the mess hall.
“Neither did I.” Hephaestus shakes his head and gives a crooked smile. “The Fates are funny that way.”
Rhodey takes in Tony’s appearance, from the grease stained sweatpants to the bruises under eyes that are too ashamed to meet his.
Zeus believed that his son should be like Ares, or even Athena, goddess of wisdom and strategy. For they were warriors, and knew the importance of a fight.
“So young for such an unforgiving fall. Zeus can be so impulsive. He often doesn’t think about the consequences.”
Hephaestus felt very conflicted about dining with the gods of Olympus. Of course, he messed up when they were alone, and so company may be better. Attention could be diverted, nerves settled.
Instead, he swings both legs over the edge of his bed and shuffles over to the door. Aware that only Rhodey would be making him breakfast, but unable to believe it until he can physically see it.
It’s probably too much to ask for The Bride to totally disregard his unwillingness to show his face, but he hopes that she’ll write it off as paranoia or fear of the Asgardian.
With a few quick swipes of his phone and a little mental gymnastics, Tony takes over their screens completely.
They pull out old tricks, attempt to take hostages, but it doesn’t work. Because he’s something new. A revelation that is long awaited.
Hephaestus would be worried if it wasn’t for the set line of Steve’s jaw and tense shoulders. “Yes, sir. I do.”
Tony doesn’t usually enjoy the little reminders he gets day-to-day of the life he once had on Olympus, but the flame has never brought him anything but a feeling of warmth and home.
Asgardians were a peculiar race to Hephaestus. Them being mortal, but with longer lifespans and the reputation of real gods.
The man sighs. There’s something slightly condescending about the way he shakes his head. “Not behind closed doors, Tony. This was a board of directors meeting.”
Tony looks up to find veins of electricity running up and down what can only be described as a pair of whips. The crude harness is frightening in its unpredictable nature, causing surges of energy to pierce the ground at sudden, random intervals.
After his conversation with Hades, Hephaestus began working on the gaping hole in his chest and the contraption powering it. He knew he could make something better, and once an idea for a miniature Arc Reactor appeared, he set to work.
“Azzano? Bucky? The shield? Howard told me you made that all on your own so don’t even try to deny it.” Steve cuts Hephaestus off before he could interrupt. “From the moment we met you’ve done so many small things that meant so much and I just hope that you know how much I appreciate it.”
Before Steve can turn away, one of the men stop him with a hand on his arm. “Wait. You sure you know what you’re doing?”
Steve nods once and focuses back to the front, eyes trailing up at the map of Austria on the wall alongside aerial photos of a facility. The facility where the captured members of the 107th are being held. “What about the others? You’re planning a rescue mission?”
Tony then places his hands on Pepper’s shoulders. His grip gentle, but firm. “I hereby, irrevocably, appoint you Chairman and CEO of Stark Industries. Effective immediately.”
Hephaestus just manages to destroy everything one way or another. It doesn’t matter that Hades has proven capable of cleaning up after him.
A clicking sound echoes in the workshop and he turns his head to find Dum-E waving a screwdriver up and down.
Agent Carter however, apparently was only available for a quick conversation because Steve is alone when he opens the heavy metal door to the lab.
He briefly thinks of all of the awful things that would happen if the Fates decided to curse him for eternity.
Now, Tony’s never claimed patience as a strong suit, so with a little help from JARVIS and a quick bypassing of Stuttgart Museum’s security cameras, he pulls up a visual of the ground.
Zeus glared at Hera. The other gods whispered in excitement. And when he looked Ares was staring straight at his mother.
Literally translated as "It wasn’t the sea to drink, my friend," the metaphor implies that it’s not so bad or it’s not the end of the world.
The thought of what Hephaestus could make for Steve however, doesn’t vanish completely. (He blames his constant multiple trains of thought, not his
He walks forward to close the large gap between them and places a firm hand on the young Asgardian’s shoulder. Glamours ordered down, unnaturally cobalt eyes pierce into Thor’s normal blue. “Thor, I need you to swear on River Styx you won’t reveal my true identity.”
Hera never looked her son in the eyes, but right then she tilted her chin slightly, and flicked her deadly gaze over to him.
A Black Label whiskey with four ounces of grain alcohol sits unassumingly on the counter. It could be poured so smoothly into a crystal glass.
Tony only hopes that if Steve could see him now, he’d be proud of the suit and the decision he’s making to make things right. It may be out of guilt and tainted by the blood already on his hands, but better late than never.
“Captain. Lieutenant.” She greets them with a polite nod. And really, Carter looks devastating in red, skin positively radiant. Hephaestus can only spare a stray thought or two toward that however, because his mind is a stream of ‘
Hephaestus can't help shaking his head and letting out a strangled laugh. He cannot believe the irony or audacity the universe has to make such a sick fucking joke.
He ends up conversing with every one of his bots. Dum-E. Butterfingers. U. It’s more emotional than he’d admit, but fuck what else can he say? These were his kids in a way. Even if he created them before the memory dump.
Now as for Steve, Tony constantly has to remind himself not to fidget. It would probably be easier to control his nerves if it wasn’t for the fact that the man keeps
“One, you are a human. Do not get caught acting as anything else.” Hades sits down on a large couch and again gestures for him to follow suit.
“Do not spell at me.” Hephaestus curls his fist so hard that he almost draws ichor with his nails. He forces himself to take a breath before accidentally setting fire to the place.
Most think the element is the deadliest weapon of them all, simply because despite its warm appearance, it snarls and bites.
“And I have access to reports where the weapons were sold. I can look there.” Rhodey quickly adds, determined and sharing a small approving smile with Pepper.
“Sure. It’d take some time though if you don’t want a human detector and would prefer an actual machine.” He carefully sets the separate parts back onto the table.
“Hey.” Steve’s lips curl into a small, shy smile. He brings a hand up to rub at the back of his neck. “I’ve been meaning to talk to you. Do you have a second?”
He hears the wooden floor give a low creak of protest at the sudden shift of his body upwards. Elbows aching, Tony silently curses his vision and its frustrating inability to focus. His mind is too sharp too suddenly, and as always he has to fight to stabilize his rapid breath which manifest in clouds of sticky vapor.
Hephaestus narrows his eyes in blatant suspicion, but Hades returns his scrutiny with a wink before pivoting away.
Hephaestus blinks back tears, and breaks eye contact with the god of the dead. “What am I supposed to do then?”
Tony’s home will always be the forge. The heat of metal against calloused skin shaping it into something extraordinary.
Oh, he is sure there will be bugs planted on the premises, but nothing he can’t find and destroy later.
“General Colonel Phillips. This is the assistant I’ve been talking about, First Lieutenant Antonius Collins.”
Hephaestus shakes his head with an exasperated laugh and Steve only winks before running down the hall.
Tony grins. It’s really too bad he can’t tell Banner about how he solved that particular problem himself a long time ago. He’ll have to settle for befriending his new science bro instead. “Finally, someone who speaks English.”
He looks around and feels relief flush through him when he spots the other three. All of them made it. Thank the fucking gods.
“First Lieutenant Antonius Collins, but all that really matters right now is that I’m Tony, Steve’s friend.”
Gaia, Mother Earth, and her husband Ouranos, the god of the sky, had produced six children before Gaia gave birth to the Titans.
Because he’s never known a god or goddess to act so drastically for no reason, especially against another god.
Loki’s armor disappears along with his smile, but Tony doesn’t really see it. Because knowing that he’s only several steps away from a man he thought was escorted by Thanatos almost seventy years ago makes his usual commentary catch in his throat.
“Tony, what was your favorite thing to do as a kid? It’s been a few days and I still haven’t gotten your full story yet.”
“Likewise. I’ve read and heard about your work. It sounds like what you're doing will bring about a lot of change.”
Steve, seeing the shield he's referring to, briefly touches the old metal, now riddled with bullet holes. “It’s handier than you might think.”
Just as Hephaestus bends down behind Steve’s shield, the curtain opens. The guard peers inside, the red, white, and blue standing out among the supplies. Steve doesn’t wait. The shield springs out, smashing the man in the face. Once the guard drops, Steve and Hephaestus emerge from the truck.
“So what are you thinking? We could use two turbines, one on the exhaust side to collect exhaust energy and another on the intake side to pressurize air?” Hades tilts his head as if visualizing the way the attachment would work.
Steve doesn’t mind that inevitability, because every time he’s tried to sleep, every time he’s closed his eyes, the dust would be there. The death. The guilt.
When they can finally see the entrance, both crouch down to observe the guards patrolling the main gate.
Because he’s fourteen and far too old to need comfort, yet with sticky tears on his cheeks, a steady presence,
Hephaestus used fire as often as possible for his weapons now, because it helped him focus on the flame instead of the cold destruction he was molding.
He has the same stubborn tilt of his jaw, strong and sure presence. Donned in the Captain America suit, Steve looks as ridiculous and wonderful as always.
“Don’t I?” Schmidt swings, but Steve blocks it with his shield. His fist leaves a noticeable dent in the steel.
Hephaestus just needs to hope that everything Hades is doing is following the Fates, and not just done to accomplish his own personal agenda.
“Well if it isn’t ‘The Star Spangled Man with a Plan.’ What is your plan exactly?” Phillips sits at a desk signing papers. A Corporal produces faint taps beside him from their typing.
Because suddenly he’s four years old and building his first circuit board in the shadows of Howard’s lab. Discovered and punished with fists behind a closed door, but only after boasting to the world about a legacy.
He really needs to set a new protocol to prevent surprise visits. Especially if he wants to keep his less than normal abilities on the down low. Tony sends a note for JARVIS to remind him.
It’s almost ethereal looking. The room awash in a soft blue from the scattered moonlight seeping in. The abandoned building they found has shadows that loom, but it’s hard for Tony to think it looks intimidating with this familiar man in front of him.
Hephaestus watches the color fade from Steve’s face. The devastation is terrible. Steve turns with a lost look that Hephaestus can’t stand. He can only hope that his unwavering support and desire to help comes through in his answering gaze. His dedication to Steve should probably terrify him, but in that moment it doesn’t.
After his demonstration for an impenetrable armor (“It is for Achilles, the greatest warrior on Earth.” “Whatever, Ares.”) Odin had approached him alone.
But that didn't mean Zeus cared about the boy's birth. He made it abundantly clear from the start that he wouldn't even try.
After stretching his arms out like a cat, the god hauls himself out of bed and begins to change into the uniform he was given.
He told Hephaestus to be on his best behavior because they were all going to a feast as a family tonight. He told him to be careful. He reminded the boy not to ask silly questions in case father got mad.
Thor immediately goes on the offensive again, thrusting an arm out to summon Mjölnir for another attack.
So she looked at her son, “Hephaestus,” she had muttered, and saw pride for herself alone, because she was going to use him to gain her husband’s attention.
The distance between them couldn’t feel more apart, even knowing he’s only a few miles away. Tony’s never claimed he’s not a dramatic bitch, okay?
After maybe a little too much coffee and too little sleep, he had the idea to relaunch the Stark Expo his father created and then stopped sometime in the mid-seventies.
Only an hour later Hephaestus finds himself on the tarmac, about to board a silver Lookheed Electra. Hades vanished after his offer to help Steve and Hephaestus, only a quick command to get what they need before take-off. He and Steve had separated as well, each needing to go gather their respective things.
But on the other hand, Tony is not stupid. A secret spy message and the desperation required to get an unknown variable like Tony Stark involved is a recipe for a high priority situation.
This Howard is human and made of flaws taken out on a child that was desperate for love, for any type of attention.
Realizing that the Arc Reactor was built outside of his own creation was a bitter pill to swallow on its own, whatever the size, but to know that kind of power was in the hands of someone outside of his (sort of) family is another thing completely.
Steve stops walking to look at Hephaestus. It feels like his eyes cut through every lie. His eyes cut through everything and see
Steve catches Hephaestus’s eyes, stunned and confused. It takes a second for him to recover, but when he does Steve grins. “I’ll meet you in the clearing with anybody I find inside. Get out fast and give them hell.”
He doesn’t know how Steve found out about the assessment, but he can’t really bring himself to care. No matter how much he may hate the thought of putting Steve in danger, he doesn’t regret his decision.
Because he’s seen disgust on people’s faces when telling stories about men who act a little too much like women. A whole community who are shunned for wanting to express their gender or sexuality in a way that doesn’t fit within their views of society.
“I think she brought me back here. I just wish she left me a reason or a message before leaving. Maria Stark died, but if Persephone did this shouldn’t she be back now that I remember?”
“Yeah actually.” Steve laughs again, and even though it’s soft, it’s genuine this time. He nods his head over to the staircase and Hephaestus follows so they can both sit down.
They used to share a smoke when cigarettes were harder and harder to come by. Steve would lean in close and his mouth–
For a few minutes neither of them say anything. And gods Tony wants to be mad at him. He wants to feel anything else but the all-encompassing and immense gratefulness he feels for this man.
Steve had so much he wanted to say to Tony and yet his mind went frustratingly blank whenever they made even the briefest of eye contact.
Hephaestus can’t help the swell of outrage that overcomes him because of that statement. Steve didn’t sign up for this. And Erskine, that brilliant man who worked so hard on an unprecedented breakthrough, managing to impress the god of innovation himself, didn’t die for this.
As soon as it’s open, he calls for it to meet him midair. Tony’s leap lands him solidly on the platform.
Immediately Hephaestus attempts again to assess his body and mind. He pushes through the overall pain, frantically searching until he realizes that the greater burn is coming from his chest.
(He was a genius before, but now it’s almost insulting that the board doubts his ability to get their stock rising again.)
The sharp pain of familiarity slowly dulled the more time they spend together. It could be explained by exposure, but it helps that Agent Carter is almost nothing like Athena.
With directions to the lab from a secretary working near the front, Hephaestus makes his way through the halls and to Hades.
As soon as they’re alone, Tony turns back toward Maria. She isn’t there. He walks forward slowly. The seat is cold.
Resigning himself to the inevitable, Tony gathers the last wisps of his composure and starts walking to the designated room.
He wonders if Koios knows how close he is to death. Despite what was implied earlier, he doubts the Titan cares either way.
Because deep down Tony knows, no fool, no mortal, could truly harness the magnificent energy of the Tesseract. It would be so much easier if it was some mortal alone who didn’t know about the power they hold, about the way they are taunting the universe.
The admission makes something inside Hephaestus melt. He tightens his grip and allows himself to hold the embrace for a few more seconds before letting go.
Maybe he’ll reach a breaking point. Maybe that point is tonight, but Peter is dead. So is Pepper, Rhodey, Happy…
He doesn’t think he’s felt so certain about anything and honest to the river of Styx it feels amazing.
Rhodey staggers over to collapse in the nearest chair. “God, Tones. Please don’t tell me you’ve had that since Afghanistan.”
Ares walked closer to place a hand on the back of Hephaestus’s neck in a gesture that was supposed to convey comfort.
When he finally steps back into his temporary quarters, Hephaestus is both surprised and completely resigned to find Hades waiting for him.
(Tony could mourn the coherency he used to have before developing a coffee addiction, but deems it unimportant.)
He doesn’t know what he wants anymore. Someone else clearly wanted him here, but why the fuck should it matter to him?
“Hydra is still out there. When I was scouring the factory I found a map with the locations of the other bases. Where the bombs are going remains unknown, but with some help of course, I’ve been granted the privilege of lighting a fire under Johann Schmidt’s ass in the meantime.”
“And what are you? Captain America’s sidekick?” He doesn’t see who made the comment, but Hephaestus can’t help the laughter that spills out.
A boy standing at the front makes a comment, and not even a second later the woman drives a strong right hook into his face.
He hasn’t seen Hades yet, but it’s only a matter of time. Furthermore, Hephaestus knows Hades will only confirm what he’s already been thinking. Steve is a distraction and if they’re really being honest, Hephaestus doesn’t deserve someone like him anyway.
Tony can’t lie with empty reassurances. JARVIS is one of the most beautiful things he’s ever created. Fiercely intelligent enough to know that the hole in his chest is deadly. Besides, he owes him more than that. JARVIS is his confidant, the one who has stayed despite everything.
They both voice their agreements and Phillips continues, “Doc has the final decision, but I want second opinions.
It’s always shudder inducing to think about how many connections Hades has, not only directly to the Fates, but the other whisperings of the universe.
The identification tags burn in his hand, but he quickly pulls the necklace over his head and around his neck. He tucks the plates under his shirt.
He can’t help the power that thrums through his veins though, his ichor feels like it’s burning, so close to one of the few things that fuel him. He hasn’t felt like this since before he fell. It’s amazing and completely terrifying.
Tony’s never done this before, but he has a feeling that being able to connect to not only machinery, but technology will help him find as many Stark Industries weapons as possible.
Tony clenches his jaw. His temper flares and the building creaks dangerously in response. He forces himself to breathe.
They work together well, Steve quickly taking down any scouts he detects with his enhanced hearing and Hephaestus taking down each listening device with a subtle flick of his hand, although the former man remains unaware of Hephaestus’s actions.
A woman he wrongly assumes is looking for the playboy side of his persona serves him a damn subpoena.
Suddenly there’s the bang of a door opening and more guards are heard outside. Both men turn toward the sound.  Steve gestures for Hephaestus to stand behind him. Reluctantly, he complies.
) of Vibranium is carefully molded into a blunt-edged disc with the capability to harm, but only to serve its base purpose. To protect.
But his vision catches on the woman sitting in front of the piano composed of ebony and ivory. She looks so painfully familiar to the woman he only saw in brief emotions and flashes of a stranger’s memories.
He never resented his mother for her departure, but he was impossibly grateful for the man who he silently declared his surrogate father because his own was too much of a violent drunk to care about anyone but himself.
Tony had hoped that the Tesseract was lost with time, but he’s never been that lucky. Fury had actually put the cursed thing in the file. Tony was just hanging onto that last thread of denial.
Armed with one gun, the older man stands between Pepper and Rhodey. Both of their hands have been cuffed to a steel bar, and silenced with rope tied brutally tight around their heads.
Never did Hephaestus think that he would have his own chance to make observations about Earth and humans.
It was somewhat difficult at first to believe that this was same man who blushed pink at compliments and believed in the future. Believed in hope.
“He was right to banish you though.” Tony shakes his head. “Fighting with the side of humanity that believes mass genocide is the answer.”
Tony tries not to dwell on it for the moment and instead continues on with as much dignity and authority as possible. He’ll need it for the first part of his plan.
He instead tells himself to breathe for a second, and does not even attempt to heal himself magically.
about Steve, okay?) Really, it’s impractical to expect that it would disappear, but it’s easier to focus.
He truly realizes for the first time how frustrating it must be to have to go through him for CEO approval when she’s the one doing all of the work.
Because call him cynical, but the tabloids will always bring up the worst things about him, true or not.
After a time, Kronos, the youngest of the Titan children, replaced Ouranos as the leader of the immortal gods. Kronos and his wife, Rheia, eventually had several children. However, like his father, Kronos was frightened them. Each time Rheia gave birth, Kronos swallowed the infant whole.”
He also unsurprisingly decided to stay at the bar for Bucky. Steve attempted to give him an apologetic look for it (being a fucking gorgeous idiot), but Hephaestus quickly cut him off with a firm shake of the head and reassurance that was softer than he intended.
He ignores the looks his friends, including Happy, are giving him and just gets ready to compose his mask for the public.
Tony lets out a shaky breath and pulls himself back up straight. He rolls his shoulders and then his head in an attempt to get out the aches and pains from being on the floor for so long.
The voices of Allied soldiers, slurred from the consumption of too much liquor,  join together in a song with lyrics that are impossible to understand, but feel like companionship all the same. For a few minutes, the three men just listen.
So maybe the thought of drifting off, forgetting, and taking a break for even a second tempted him more than he’d ever admit…
Hephaestus doesn’t know how it happened, but by some unspoken agreement Steve continued to sit with him in the chow hall.
She seems to understand him on a level he can’t comprehend yet because knowing all of that, she is the one to place a wrench in his hands. The one that gifts him with the ability to quiet his mind for a few seconds.
So Tony sees himself growing up in a life full of heartache and learning and a desperation to understand.
Ares had brushed his soft hair from his forehead and promised to tell the story once he had lain down.
“You both deserve to be happy. So a word of advice, pal? Don’t be an idiot. You might regret not takin’ the chance.”
He clears his throat and continues. “There's been speculation that I was involved in the events that occurred–”
as incentive for Hephaestus to follow. He doesn’t know if Carter is following, but he’ll be damned if he’ll let Steve barrel into Colonel Phillips’s tent alone.
“Well gentleman,” the General looks toward the training grounds, “we have only a week to pick our guy for the job. The drill sergeants are gonna do their best to whip the boys into shape, and I want you both to keep an eye out on the best candidate.”
He tries not to take over the whole thing immediately, but his patience runs out when they try to use Rhodey against him.
“I’m from Fresno, Ace.” Hephaestus holds back a snort at the reaction from that blunt statement. He understands fear, but fuck if it doesn’t make him angry when people generalize an entire country or race. Not everyone from Japan agreed with the bombing of Pearl Harbor. From what he’s seen, the United States has done some fucked up things too. No one has room to talk.
“Exactly. There’s one more component to this that I think will be the key factor, but you’ll have to give me a little time to make sure it’s possible.”
When Ares finally strode out of the room Hephaestus let out a breath he hadn’t been aware of holding.
Maybe if he sees enough of it, he’ll get desensitized and be able to work again without hating himself afterward.
Tony doesn’t want any member of SHIELD to believe that just because his late father was interested, doesn’t mean they can get their grubby little paws all over his stuff.
It wasn’t really on his agenda this morning so Pepper might be a little peeved, but Tony finds himself driving up to Disney Concert Hall anyway, armor case in the trunk.
Steve’s polite smile doesn’t falter, but Hephaestus has to hold back a snort at how absurdly understated that is.
Because in the end, he could return to his tools, his magic, his workshop, and just breathe for a while.
“A device would be preferable.” Hades nods his head, seeming to make up his mind about something. “We’ll be stationed in Italy for a while under different orders. That should give you enough time to get the parts you need and build something that works.”
He decides he’s been enough of a cock tease and smirks, swirling his glass. “Using the modern calendar system, I was born on the fourth of April,” Tony says.
I'd been working on this chapter to post it earlier, but then life happened. Endgame happened. :P I saw it on the night it premiered and my dudes, it was a wild fucking ride and that's all I'm gonna say about it. Anyway! This is the end of act one! AH! I hope you're as excited as I am for the wildness to come. Tony fucking Stark is about to arrive.
“Thanks, J.” He replies aloud automatically, but then Tony blinks, registering what was actually said.
“Yeah.” Steve smiles like Hephaestus isn’t the worst person, god, he’s ever met and Hephaestus doesn’t really understand it, but oh it’s so much harder to keep his resolve when those blue eyes look at him like that.
The location of the power source scorched into his mind, Hephaestus sprints through the Hydra factory.  The bombs beginning to go off on the ground floor shake the building.
Side by side, they take out the wardens patrolling. Hephaestus doesn’t like the amount of noise they’re creating, but he took out the cameras as soon as they entered the hall so he hopes the gods have mercy and backup doesn’t arrive.
Surely, there’s something more important that Hades would want him to focus on? It’s hard to believe that Hades is okay with Hephaestus running off to oblige his strong feelings about a mortal.
Hephaestus looks up and comes face to face with two men clad in black gear and masks. The Hydra insignia is blood red on their right shoulders.
“That would be good, but I think there’s a way to simplify it even more.” Hephaestus pauses for a moment to calculate the maintenance and overall output. “If we have a single unit that accounts for exhaust pressure on the front we could have it so that each time a pulse of exhaust pressure hits a membrane from the back the rushing displacement of air on the front sucks in more and pushes it into an air box."
Tony doesn’t know if that’s better or worse than not knowing what the man is thinking, but he consciously chooses to be positive for once and have faith.
Right now though Hephaestus must follow Hades and Steve for the mission. It doesn’t matter if the new protective side of him is elated that he gets to help Steve.
It’s important to remember that one night with a heart to heart doesn’t change the months Hades spent being vague and acting as one of the most enigmatic beings Hephaestus has ever met.
The agent backs up against the wall. His face is covered, but Tony can tell he’s afraid by the way his hands, held up in surrender, shake. He’s not proud of how smug that makes him feel. Although it’s easier to acknowledge that than his headache.
Looking back, it was ironic how he had given into the god of war’s demands, when all he wanted to do was create, not destroy.
Other than the punch straight to the nose he saw on his first day here, Hephaestus has gotten to know her through several hours in the practice field. He didn’t realize he was signing up for so much commitment when he volunteered his services out of a need to
“As serious as a heart attack.” The joke, as bad as it is, successfully pulls her out of the shock in favor of a reprimanding look.
Apparently satisfied, in one swift movement the agent turns toward the elevator. “I’ll leave you to look that over.”
“I liked to build things. Create. I don’t know it hasn’t really changed.” Hephaestus fidgets with his paper napkin by tearing a corner into tiny pieces.
Steve is scowling from the end of the catwalk, helpless, but the three men flinch as another explosion rocks the facility.
He knew he saw a fierceness in Steven Grant Rogers from the moment they met. It was in the tilt of his chin, the way his face morphed into bold conviction when he stepped into a recruitment office for the sixth time.
Tony sits and grabs a slice of inferior pizza to give his hands something to do. “What happened at the meeting?”
Curious now, but still cautious, Hephaestus slowly walks forward to find Hades underneath a motorcycle of all things. Feeling confusion among the multitude of other conflicting emotions, Hephaestus shuffles forward as asked. He kneels down when beckoned even closer and Hades huffs in irritation before tugging on his son’s sleeve so he topples down beside him.
How could he not? All the magic he has comes from the pure energy of ichor. Every pump of his heart acted as a pulse of power, one that would cause his magic to thrum to life with potential.
What he will question however, is the figure he sees standing under the awning once he circles back around. Those broad shoulders and absurd waistline do not belong there.
It was nice though, having the time and space to let fire dance upon his skin once again. He was actually doing something. Something worth
It’s an even stranger sight than before, if he’s being honest. Hephaestus wonders once again how much Hades knows about science and engineering.
The walk from the car to inside the building predictably consists of too many high pitched squeals and camera flashes. He stalks past most of it without a glance, although he does speak to Obadiah for one uncomfortable moment if only to keep up appearances.
First Tony plays the part, agreeing to build the weapon and giving them a complete list of what he needs. They threaten Yinsen and Tony claims his usefulness as an assistant, his confidence slightly faltering in the face of desperation.
“Ladies and gentleman, Mr. Howard Stark!” This time a woman makes the announcement from center stage and Hephaestus can spot the bulky microphone she used to project her voice.
Phillips nods right in a silent request for a walk away from potential listeners. Hephaestus complies.
With Rheia's help, Zeus was able to grow up to be a strong and powerful young god. When he was ready to avenge his siblings, Zeus snuck into Kronos's home and pretended to be a servant. When Kronos called for a drink, he brought him one laced with poison instead. Kronos became violently ill and vomited up each of the children he had swallowed, who were now fully-grown gods.
He is struck sometimes by the bond he’s managed to form with these men in such a short amount of time. Because throughout all of the terror, the death, they’ve managed to form a friendship.
Hephaestus just tries his best not to stare at the fitted cut of his uniform. Because honestly, how the fuck is a suit that tight within regulation?
Even with a crazed smile on his face and a watchful double conjured near the back, it’s the unnatural smoothness to main Loki’s gestures that makes all of Tony’s muscles tense.
Well, not problem solving exactly, because that’s Athena. She would make him do weapons resistance training for several days straight if she ever heard him say otherwise.
Because that’s what she was, wasn’t she? Like him. Creation embodied, only instead of metal and machines, she was fresh fields and a brook in the meadows.
(And if there’s also a slightly smaller armor nicknamed Rescue hidden in the back of his closet at the end of it, that’s his business. All right?)
“I hate when you guys team up on me.” Tony attempts to joke, but his voice is weak. “You know, this is completely unfair and unfounded.”
Pepper steps forward and reads, her brow furrowing more and more as each second passes. “We cancelled every military contract.”
He has a goal and he owes it to the lives of the people he’s killed to do his damn best in making things right.
Hephaestus doesn’t understand how such a short time, especially to a god thousands of years old, could wind him up so quickly. The nerves threaten to consume his every thought.
Bucky nods in approval and both men unanimously help Bucky swing first over the barrier to cross the gantry.
Then she laughs like someone told her the most brilliant joke, “Oh, silly me! Of course your uniform is right over there. I must apologize. I’ll be right back, gentlemen.”
Unlike most fighters however, who train to get past their instincts, Steve quickly suppresses it. Before the agent can recover from his shock, (Steve didn’t react at all to the punch that landed) the super-soldier kicks his stomach. One knock-out hit with the shield later and Steve tosses the unconscious agent out of the truck.
“Can you tell me where Hades is?” Koios hasn’t moved from his spot. He looks almost bored with the younger god’s attempts. “If you check I believe you’ll find he’s vanished without a trace.”
Because one minute he was gulping down stale coffee, pouring over profiles and reading about the more recent advancements in thermonuclear astrophysics, and the next both his internal and external systems were screaming.
Tony moves over to the lock chip that he made a couple days ago and palms it in his hand. He planned on finding a way to use it on his own, despite the problem of drawing immediate suspicion.
Granted, he does want to interrogate the fuck out of him, but he can’t say anything and Hermes knows that.
Because with all the chaos and confusion, the identity crisis and fucking kidnapping, this is the one thing he
Biting back his frustration and unwilling to waste any more time, Tony doesn’t bother turning around to respond. “Doesn’t matter. If he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract’s lost.”
Hera’s gardens, officially named The Garden of the Hesperides, were at the edge of Mount Olympus. It was a place only Hera was allowed to enter because of the powerful magic inside.
Tony activates full throttle in his repulsors and thanks the Fates he isn’t a mortal man who would die from too much G-Force.
“But what about my purpose?" Hephaestus asks. His frustration is beginning to leak into his words, but he doesn't stop. He can't. "It was my mistakes that caused me to defy the fucking Fates! I should be inventing the weapons Olympus needs. Distractions only keep me from going home.” What is Hades trying to say? He shouldn't be so forgiving with his actions. He's been careless. Selfish…
It shouldn’t be as shocking as it is. In those memories he didn’t look like he did when he was fighting with Steve. He looked like he did on Olympus. He looked like Hephaestus.
This infantry is clearly the workhorse of the military, not only battling the enemy troops to gain more territory, but doing physical labor back and forth to the front lines. They transport the food, clothing, weapons and medicine.
He is tall, lean, and very pale. Dark black hair curls messily around his ears and neck, and circles distinct enough to be bruises frame impossibly darker eyes. He has his facial hair groomed in an odd way he notes. Perhaps in a style that matches his grey button down and burgundy suspenders.
The original Avengers may be alive, but Tony has learned the hard way that they were never his friends. Steve was never his friend. No matter how much he wishes Steve-
“The more I think about it, the more it makes sense actually.” God of trade, thieves, roads, persuasion…
It’s a beautiful mass of chaos. Hephaestus can’t help the elation he feels, the happiness of freedom contagious.
Awareness doesn’t creep in slowly. There isn’t that blissful second of blank contentedness, where everything is still hazy and warm.
“The serum however, was not finished correctly, and according to the doctor, Schmidt became horribly disfigured. He was furious with the results, and so threw the man into a dungeon. This was when he was rescued. Now he’s agreed to actually help perfect his formula.”
He startles, standing tense with hands reflexively assuming a defensive position. Hephaestus barely stops himself from letting flames engulf his palms.
Hit suddenly with an idea, Tony reaches out to Howard’s old server and files. Maybe the man was just arrogant enough to leave something that could be useful.
He forces himself to order Mjölnir to stay, to be patient, but it still pains him more than anything to deny her. She is his long-lost creation, missed so desperately throughout their many centuries apart. Lost in an exchange of forced diplomacy.
founded Stark Industries in 1939. It was founded in response to the war effort mostly. I’m sorry, but it’s so much easier if I do this instead of having you waste time reading all you can about the war…”
His eyes, usually blood red, were not something that scared Hephaestus. But the deep rust they had turned made the boy tense.
Then through the murky shadows of the forest, Thor’s voice carries, jarringly soft, “The bearer of unwearied fire, flaming torrents bright.”
Before the end of Reveille, Hephaestus watches a crowd of men rush out of a building far across from him. They all look young, but the voice yelling after them doesn’t seem to care.
Sure, the thought of the death his own inventions would wrought makes him sick, but without a weapon, Steve can’t protect himself either. Oh the double edged sword…
At the presentation, Doctor Erskine found the last person he needed to find enough possible recruits for the program. They had moved everyone out last night, including him.
In his dream he remembers her staying by his bedside. Regaling him with tales of heroes and a new god that forged innovation with fire.
That’s not including how much it bothers Hephaestus to have information (very obviously) withheld from him. He knows this will likely become a constant as long as he’s on Earth.
Tony uses the few minutes he has left before his friends arrive to finish taking off the suit and splash cold water on his face.
Buried under all of the clothing, the god picks up a thin chain. Metal plates cling together once as he holds it up to the city’s lights.
Last he checked Medusa was still creeping around the Underworld with her frighteningly hideous Gorgon sisters.
And these young, foolish Asgardians are the reason why he’s endangering the people he’s come to really care about. To love.
Pepper probably won’t appreciate it later when they’re supposed to be celebrating Stark Tower’s debut as a solely renewable, self-sustained building.
Sweat beads, drips down his neck. Their time is up and the march of the approaching guards is a threat. An unfulfilled promise.
They all stand there, listening for what caught Steve’s attention. Tony reaches out to see if he can sense any machines nearby.
Considering there’s nothing more he can do at the moment, Tony continues to tell himself that working himself up is pointless.
He knows Apollo, god of the sun, music, and all things happy (The last one isn’t true. Hephaestus just thinks the younger deity was way too fucking chipper all the time.) is controlling the sun chariot currently making its way across the sky.
“Dr. Banner is only here to track the cube.” Fury interrupts. He strides into the room, tarnishing Tony’s already fragile good mood with every step he takes.  “I was hoping you might join him, Stark.”
Whatever the case, Tony has no way of getting any answers now. So he tries his best to focus on the possessions that were actually saved from what feels like both a lifetime and only a few weeks ago.
The emotional rollercoaster that is Bruce’s emotions makes Tony a bit concerned and amused. More so the latter when the poor man ends up replying with flushed cheeks and a dazed, “…Thanks.”
(He doesn’t have the heart to tell the bot he can’t actually get burned anymore. Besides, Dum-E will figure that out on his own eventually because despite what many may think, the little guy does actually learn and should be given the chance to.)
It probably means something that when particularly anxious, Hephaestus instinctually jumps at the chance to create solutions for problems (real or metaphorical) that are easily fixed with a tool or machine.
” thing for one, but he also doesn’t even know if Steve likes him in that way. He’s watched the guy interact with Bucky. Steve could just be a tactile person.
Now Tony doesn’t speak spy, but ‘Code: Gamma Alpha Gamma’ does not sound like something you’d send if there was free pizza in the breakroom.
Steve may be struggling, but Hephaestus knows that he hasn’t stopped either. “If the serum does what you say it’ll do, that won’t matter, will it?”
This whole thing is ridiculous, but when Hermes takes the other chair, Hephaestus just decides to sit on the edge of the cot and let the insanity run its course.
“Naïve? I was naïve before. I grew up in this. You said, ‘Here’s the line we don’t cross it. This is how we do business.’ Yet in the meantime you’re double-dealing under the table.”
But Jarvis helped him survive in the times where it was impossible to remember anything but the empty rooms and bottom of a bottle.
He wondered how they could evolve with such short lifespans, but summed it up to the gods’ involvement.
Tony scowls at the action and it deepens even further when Pepper hands it back to him without even looking.
It’s a feverish trance where all he sees are angles, flames licking up and down his arms, and the dangerous glint of metal as he molds it so precisely with hands that are steady and sure.
“You’re smart, boy.” He lifts his hand and studies it like a child would watch ants burn under a microscope. Amused and sick. “I know you can figure it out.”
He hesitates for a few seconds longer, internally debating, before sliding the chip on the desk, over to his friends. “I can’t do this alone. Please.”
And he wouldn’t prompt him to tell Pepper about this if he didn’t believe it was the right thing to do.
To his utter, tragically temporary relief, the man leaves quickly after that. Hephaestus can hear that the men have started up their terrible singing again.
Unable to think of anything in response to Hades and his statement (why does he want to say death sentence?), Hephaestus leaves the older god alone. He latches onto the motorcycle they were working on earlier and tries to focus on that instead.
“Thank you.” Tony successfully keeps his voice from wavering, but it’s still softer and more genuine than he’d like to admit.
Earth, a planet part of Yggdrasil (the world tree), held so much undiscovered potential, and therefore so much time from the gods. They had decided to make the planet unlike any other creation.
The other members of the infantry roll their eyes. Sergeant Timothy Dugan, known to some of the others just as “Dum Dum” for reasons none of the others are willing to divulge, shoves Jones away before taking a hearty and suspiciously petulant sip of his drink.
He turns away toward the control panel, but not before catching Thor’s adorably proud smile. The fucking golden retriever.
He has nowhere else to go, despite the vicious thoughts aimed at his desire to accept. Zeus’s voice echoes in his mind.
Rhodey shrugs. “Stane is an asshole.” He looks at the now still body with grimace, “We kinda already knew that.”
Earth isn’t actually aware of life outside of their own solar system, but he would hear gods (Ares) talk about visiting constantly.
The world is tinted purple through expensive lenses and Tony takes deep breaths to keep the nausea at bay.
. The one in the gun is just a derivative, but this has to have been around been around before he was even born.
“Don’t worry. Your pet soldier won’t remember a thing about today. I know concussions can make things rather
A quick glance around the workshop and Hades wills the door closed. Hephaestus can feel the power of the recording devices scattered around the room power down as well.
“Yeah.” He scrubs a hand over his face and tries to shake off the guilt that threatens to drown him.
A flame among the darkness, and what many had seen as a guiding light. Upon his birth she had looked upon him with warm eyes and a gentle smile. Held him close to her chest. If he could see her, he would have said that maybe she was truly happy, in that first moment he opened his eyes.
Hephaestus feels his eyes burning. For all his abilities it’s difficult to process the genuine conviction in that statement.
“You know what I wanna know?” He covers one eye and squints out the window for several long seconds. Tilts his head from side to side. Then far too innocently he looks back at Hill. “How does he even properly see?”
Both his friends still look baffled when Tony looks up from his thoughts. As is totally expected however, Pepper recovers first.
He looks up again when an older burly man makes his presence known. Walking right behind him is Howard, with his hands casually held behind his back.
The god of war, usually so harsh and violent, softly brushed through the disarrayed curls. Ares snapped his fingers so a small set of formal robes replaced the ones covered in grease.
Without shame, he looked the boy up and down. Observing. He never knew what his father was looking for.
After a second though, he shakes his head in resignation. “No hard feelings, kid. You didn’t know.” Tony subtly grimaces, “And before you ask, yes you can keep Mjölnir. For now.”
“And at the worst time, too. I just figured it all out.” Stane chuckles, as if Tony hadn’t said anything at all.
It’s obvious that Azzano left its mark on everyone that got captured, but not everyone was found on an operating table. Not everyone came back with a hauntingly blank look in their eyes that hasn’t gone away even with copious amounts of alcohol. Bucky looks around the room like he doesn’t recognize where they are and the people around them.
A stressful day and a half later finds Tony making his first public appearance since being kidnapped. He figures he needs the distraction.
As if reading his mind, Steve continues, “Because everything you’ve done makes me know one thing for sure.”
He takes it, because it’s Pepper, but he tries his best to make his displeasure known. Even if only Mrs. Agent can see it. “I don’t owe you people anything. Besides, official consulting hours are only between eight and five every other Tuesday.”
Music begins to play in time with the dancers gesturing toward Howard. The man walks with a slow, arrogant stride, and when he reaches the woman with the microphone, he pulls her in for a kiss.
That night, when he’s lying in his bed that’s far too big for just one person, Tony finds himself once again immensely grateful that he’s not completely alone in this.
“Tony.” Steve shakes his head with a sigh that sounds like something too close to fond, “One of the boys on our street spoke French and decided to teach us for fun. I’m a little rusty, but I can get by. My ma also taught me Gaelic, in case you don’t want any more surprises.”
Tony idly listens to the others discussing Loki and his resemblance to a bag of feral cats. The guy is not wrong, although he knows there’s a deeper story there. Tony refuses to believe otherwise considering the powers at play.
“Agent Coulson.” The bastard doesn’t seem the least bit concerned about Tony’s internal screaming. Figures.
It hurts too much to use his abilities now. It makes the ache in his chest and head almost unbearable in its intensity.
If having Steve’s back was possible while following the older god’s instructions well then, he just had to consider that a bonus.
“Besides, we’re your friends.” Rhodey walks over to Tony to place a gentle hand on his shoulder. “I think I can speak for both of us when I say we have your back no matter what.”
Tony ducks his head, eyes annoyingly bright. Once he gets it a little more under control he motions to his hand. “Well I owe you both an explanation, in the very least."
When he does open the door to step out, the frigid temperature isn’t a shock, but Tony will admit the calm startles him a bit. Without any wind or snow to add to the thick blanket already on the ground, the sight looks like something that belongs in a postcard.
“Uh huh. Shakespeare in the park?” Tony raises one hand up mockingly. “Doth mother know you weareth her drapes?”
Besides the presence of his mother, who is only there to hug him when the weather is warm, he finds another person who makes each memory seem a little less bleak.
He’d been somewhat confused, but just seeing this now, is it really so surprising that Hades is here?
“Right.” Tony stands up. The barstool screeches in protest, but he ignores it in favor of the flask on the counter.
But right now? As Tony goes through the maze of his house’s servers, the cameras and lights,  the security features and personal files, he feels settled. He feels like he’s where he belongs.
“I’m sure Hephaestus would love to gift the hammer to your son,” Ares said. He squeezed his shoulder a bit too tight. “The thing is replaceable to him anyways.”
The contact isn’t malicious or even moving at all. It’s just a hand. A firm and calloused hand with just enough weight on it to feel grounding rather than like a deliberate attempt to keep him in place.
“I wonder where he got that from,” Hera said lightly. She lifted a spoon to her lips, “You know those are not my genes.”
Tony doesn’t finish Steve’s thought. He hates himself a little for being selfish enough to not want to hear about it.
“It’ll be okay, Tony,” he says. His smile is gentle. “People are saying the war will be over in just a couple of months. And I think I actually believe them this time.”
Despite being temporarily distracted by Howard's shenanigans, Hephaestus continues pushing past people. They're beginning to turn around to leave, but Hephaestus doesn't notice until he gets tripped up suddenly by something.
The tales that explain where it all came from, who he has to thank for making Olympus, his home, a reality.
“I have the serum.” Steve says, and pulls himself up next to Tony. “Missing a couple hours of sleep won’t kill me.”
Tony takes his time in the shower and then sets himself to shaving. After setting the aftershave down on the counter, he grips the edge and leans forward.
Hephaestus internally laughs at the old man’s enthusiasm. That was the fastest meeting in his life, but definitely marks as one of the best.
The tension in her frame loosens, if only slightly. “Well unless it has anything to do with the company…”
. He feels lightheaded. Gods, Tony should have figured out how to fix the palladium poisoning his body before. He’s been so fucking
But Hephaestus was used to giving and never receiving anything back. Ares said that it was his duty to provide for the gods. If he had a gift, why not use it to protect his family?
Old men and strangers come up to shake his hand. They give apologies that are void of anything except for disinterested pity.
He shrugs, keeping in mind how harshly the new Privates are usually treated once entering the army. “I’m not into the whole scare tactic thing.”
“They did take a number of the men to isolation ward. I’m afraid we haven’t seen them since.” A man with an English accent says, sounding apologetic.
“During the investigation afterward, I met a man named Colonel Chester Phillips. I accepted his invitation to join America’s own military science division, the newly created Strategic Scientific Reserve.” Hades waves a hand casually, “You especially need to know that, because he’ll think you’re recruited as well.”
Tony doesn’t really understand it, yet he can’t help the relief that begins flood through him. Leave it to Rhodey to make him laugh at a time like this. “Out of everything that’s just happened, that’s what you focus on?”
He wants believe it’ll all be that easy, but before he can form a proper offensive, the Titan raises his arms. The cold eagerly listens.
right before Steve brings down the edge of his shield. Only this time he does die. He loses control of his body and Tony turns into dust upon contact. It burns and all Steve can do swear and sob and cry out apologies that will never be enough.
It occurs within a matter of moments, but Tony watches Bucky’s fall off the train as if it took place over the course of a lifetime. Each millisecond catalogues the shock, the pain, and finally the pure anguish.
“Strong like you?” Tony asks. “How did you get out of Tartarus then? Empty prayers don’t help in an escape.”
He can tell he still has a little time before the metal will actually kill him, but the threat is there and very imminent.
Jones watches their backs as Bucky, Steve, and Tony climb down the latter and into one of the train cars.
It was the closest to love he could be without feeling it. An obsession with a beautiful woman and the joy of a challenge to win her affections.
Seriously. It’s not the fucking time to reflect on his failures or the moral complexities of humanity that leave him so unbelievably frustrated and filled with a hatred that can’t be directed at anyone but himself.
Thor doesn’t appear to get the reference. Shame. “This is beyond you, metal man.” What does he think this is? A bad
“They’re thirty miles behind the lines. Through some of the most heavily fortified territory in Europe. We’d lose more men than we’d save. I don’t expect you to understand that, because you are a chorus girl.” Maybe Hades would forgive him if he caused one little accidental fire? Just one?
Hades doesn’t have the same reservations when Steve throws open the jump door, “Rogers, get back here. I’m taking you all the way in!”
With more care than he thought possible, Steve presses his lips gently across his cheek. He holds him like he’s something precious.
“Hephaestus.” Zeus nodded at his son from the center throne. The room felt impossibly magnificent and imposing.
Maybe he’s insane, but rebuilding what let him escape in the first place is all Tony can think of to really keep that promise.
He’s just naturally an engineer, in the most basic human terms, a scientist. A scientist that works with math and digs and digs until he can discover all of the variables.
Fighting the overwhelming drive wasn’t even an option. Instead, with Hades acting as an approving, silent vigil, Hephaestus embraces it.
Every day for the last year he’s had to live with the guilt of his abilities. The choice to hold himself back from helping even when someone could have died.
The goal so far, his priority, has always been to return to Olympus. He’s never thought anywhere else was where he belonged. How can a mortal man that he’s known for such a short amount of time make him question that?
“Fuck no,” Tony replies immediately, tone absolute. He points with his fork accusingly. “Rhodey is just being a mother hen about something else.”
Tony places the clothing down to be put back in storage, but he grips the tracker tightly. He’ll make a better one.
He still has so much to figure out about himself and what he’s destined to accomplish. What the difference is between what he wants to do and needs to do. It all still feels like a question impossible to answer.
The camp has gone to bed for the night. If he wasn’t a god used to going decades at a time without sleep, he’d probably be passed out as well. There are many perks that come with being immortal.
Noticing the keys attached to the fallen wardens belt, Steve quickly bends down to grab them and dangles them to show Hephaestus. He smiles at Steve’s success and quickly punches the warden one last time so they fall unconscious.
He shrugs. “I'm just not the hero type. Clearly. With this laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I've made, largely public…”
Steve doesn’t seem to hear him. “I don’t need the whole list. Just one name. Sergeant James Barnes from the 107th.”
Steve hesitates for a second before returning Howard’s smile. Hephaestus can only watch in silent despair as the two exchange a firm handshake. It’s clear that the god of the dead has plans and for all that his biological father has helped him thus far, Hephaestus isn’t naïve enough to believe there are no ulterior motives.
“Of course.” Hephaestus waves Steve over so they can both sit down. For some reason, Steve chooses to sit with him on the cot. Distractingly close.
He can’t stop listening though. News sources, podcasts, and documentary specials all clash together in a cacophony of horrific sound that only gets louder and louder and louder. It feels like there’s nothing else in the world people are talking about.
“Open a tab.” Dugan smiles unrepentantly. The others clearly agree with the demand if their laughs are anything to go by.
Tony didn’t even try to work on anything. Nine times out of ten burying himself in his workshop is what keeps the demons in his head at bay, but not this time.
Tony scoffs without thinking about it. He feels his lips move of its own accord. “This is why I love being home right before you leave town for Christmas.”
He jumps and barely restrains himself from knocking over the mug by his elbow. As he turns to her with a scowl, he has the layout of monitors he was working on go to screensaver.
Tony braces himself once the steps halt. Behind Koios stands a Hydra agent, much larger than any of the other men they’ve fought this far. He wouldn’t be surprised if his human appearance is also just a façade.
After a second, Steve shakes his head and stands. Tony follows his lead only a few seconds later, ignoring the ache of his protesting body. He knows he’s getting weaker, but he can’t afford to worry about it right now. He’ll handle it later.
He promises, even if it’s only to himself, that one day he’ll give each life the thought and respect they deserve.
"We haven't seen each other in so long! It's as if it was yesterday that poor Dum Dum lost all his precious cigarettes because of you."
The crowd cheers in relief, but it’s only a faint buzzing sound as Tony rips out the Arc Reactor and crushes it in one gauntleted fist.
“Just please,” he squeezes just a little more tightly, “no more pushing away. Pepper, Happy, and I have been so damn worried about you.”
He thinks about the innocent lives killed, not from his ignorance, but his deliberate choice to turn a blind eye, to stop caring.
“Vibranium,” Hephaestus says, “A metal that’s stronger than steel and a third of the weight. It actually absorbs kinetic energy so bullets feel like almost nothing.”
It works, sure, but it’s clear the German inventor had no idea what they were working with. One wrong move on their part and the whole thing would have exploded in their faces. Literally.
Ares did not reprimand Hephaestus for inventing and building like everyone else, although he did not encourage it.
“We’ll get another round.” Steve’s hand lands gently on his shoulder and Hephaestus startles. He barely stops himself from blurting out a confused ‘
Tony grits his teeth as his thrusters push Mach 4. Going as fast as he is, it won’t take long to arrive at the party Loki is hosting.
It was a heavy weight in his chest that never quite went away no matter how many punching bags he destroyed. Because just when the chasm between him and the world felt maybe bearable, HYDRA was found, and Bucky was kept alive in the worst way imaginable. Steve realized he just had to accept the heaviness that pressed on him, day after day because his life will always be war.
He calmly walked over to the pole and took out the pivot and lock pin. All the others could do was watch in shock as Steve patiently waited for it to fall then carefully took off the flag to give it to the drill sergeant.
“There are many things that are uncertain about the future. Things that I’ve heard that worry me a great deal.” Hades says, “I am glad however, that we can be certain about this.”
So Tony doesn’t feel inclined to share all the awful details, but that doesn’t mean he isn’t open to a question or two.
Perhaps he could explore the area? He’ll just go past the crowd, maybe find something to see nearby. He knows he wasn’t told to stay backstage directly, and he can keep himself out of trouble.
He looked defeated for saying those words, and Hephaestus was very surprised and now becoming panicked as well.
His visual systems are quick to spot the pair of Asgardians bickering on a ledge in the middle of the forest.
“It's like calisthenics.” Tony fumbles to explain. “You might have missed a couple things, you know, doing time as a Capsicle.”
Hephaestus keeps himself hidden one flight below the men. Schmidt and Steve slowly walk to meet on the catwalk. “So the old man managed it after all. Not quite an improvement, but impressive.”
Tony hates himself for even considering putting her in danger, but the numbers in his head aren’t lying. She has the greatest chance of getting it done safely.
Tony easily rips open the box, but his hands are gentle when they reach to remove the soft terry cloth.
The possibility of endangering more people terrifies him, but he doesn’t know if he can hurt them more than he probably already has by acting the way he did.
Headlights sweep the main road to their left. Three covered trucks escorted by a motorbike rumble past them toward the entrance. Before the last one makes it too far Steve nudges him with an elbow and nods over to the truck just a few feet away.
Because what he wanted was selfish. And really, he just wanted to end the constant cycle of hope and disappointment.
He just made Hephaestus promise to learn how to wield any weapons and armor he creates. Both thought it reasonable.
Suddenly desperate to keep the conversation going, he glances around for a new topic and spots a recruitment center coming up as they walk.
Operating under the assumption that the fight is over for now, he begins to track down the repressed furry (Why
None of the men seem to know what to say to that, but Steve is already distracted with which key goes to which lock. Hephaestus snatches the keys away and immediately finds the right one. He pulls Steve along to find the stairs for the floor below and pushes them back into his hands.
The tracker works like a charm. As much as his hands itch to improve the machine, he studies the location that appears on the small screen. Hades was right.
So Tony tries (mostly fails) to relax, and the rest of the car ride passes in a haze of grey buildings and controlled breaths.
Hey friends, so... it's been awhile. This is a bit personal, but I thought I'd share in case anyone cares about where I've been. This work means so fucking much to me and having feedback and support even after all this time means even more.
If he’s bothered by the order, Steve doesn’t show it. He straightens his shoulders and faces his men. This is the Captain that went to bat for their team when questioned about an integrated unit. The man that wouldn’t let anyone stop him from doing what was right.
“Rheia was distraught by the loss of her children, so she asked Gaia, her sister, for help. The next time Rhea gave birth, Gaia hid the infant, Zeus, deep in a cave. After, she gave Kronos a rock wrapped in baby blankets, which he swallowed immediately. He did not suspect anything was amiss.
Persephone only told the heroic parts, so he fills in the rest. He describes the way he almost let his unit die over and over again. The way Steve looked on the ground, pale and unmoving.
The tension from before doesn’t leave; however, with a task Hephaestus finds familiar and comforting his shoulders relax slightly. He allows himself to ignore the absurdity of the situation and studies the improvements already made. The numbers rush forward in excitement for a new project.
From the looks of it, Hades wants Hephaestus there for a reason. He can’t help but think about the fact that Hades wants Steve there for a reason as well. He forces himself to bat the anxiety away. It doesn’t really work.
It seems the universe has decided to cut him a break after all, because Steve stops suddenly, hand raised with a stiff gesture. There’s no hesitation in the group to follow their Captain’s command.
Hades just smiles. It doesn’t reach his eyes. “I don’t know enough yet to worry you unnecessarily.” He shakes his head. “All you need to worry about is joining those men. A warrior as clever as you having their backs is priceless.”
“Ladies and gentleman, what if I told you that in just a few short years, your automobile won’t even have to touch the ground at all?”
In a sea of profiles, ranging from big and green to a flashback from his time as Olympus’s pet engineer, a shock of familiar blond hair stands out.
He doesn’t want to identify the emotion that swells inside him. He doesn’t deserve to feel anything but happy for Steve who has managed to catch the attention of a woman as amazing as Peggy Carter.
Around the blue glow (A perfect match for his eyes, just like he fucking thought.) Tony finds the beginnings of his true poisoning. They expand outward, raised lines showing just where the palladium is spreading to infect the ichor in his veins.
“I fucked up.” Tony whispers miserably. “I know you don’t like it, but I can’t live like this. Those innocent people were killed because of
(He remembers Sunset Bain and her deceitfully kind words. Tiberius Stone and Rumiko making so many promises just to laugh and
The easy mood abruptly ends when Hephaestus hears shuffled footsteps behind him. He turns around to find Steve, posture as stiff as his new title, but of course, the blond man breaks the illusion by giving a sheepish smile.
The room is cut with shadows and it’s difficult to focus on the details on the curtains or the candles that light the hallway further down.
Hephaestus never really cared for them. Mostly because he didn’t care for the way his creations paved destruction wherever it was aimed.
Before Hephaestus can say anything else, Hades snaps his fingers and vanishes. The cold that crept into the room without him noticing gives way to a sudden wave of heat. He shivers at the change and rubs his arms.
“Well, besides punching Hitler in the jaw over a hundred times, I’m helping the war effort. At least, that’s what Senator Brandt says.” Steve looks down at his hands.
His plan was to go back to the makeshift workshop and start improving the tracker. He promised to find the source and
Zeus and his brothers and sisters united against Kronos and the other Titans, and a vicious battle swept the Earth and displaced the universe surrounding it.
“Captain,” he finally chokes out. The metallic echo of Tony's mask hides about ninety-five percent of the inflections in his voice, but that small five percent leaves Tony terrified.
They both stop only a couple steps to the right of Hephaestus, who is struggling not to laugh hysterically.
The change in atmosphere seems to help his head clear up a little. He needs it considering that a month of voluntary solitary confinement (other than the occasional visit from the god of the dead) is a bit much. Even for him.
So he finds himself being happily prodded while flipping through the newspaper someone left in the temporary green room.
Steve, who is everything he knows a hero should be, raises a hand. He’s breathtakingly brave because Tony can’t even find it in himself to speak and this man, fingertips shaking, brings a hand up to gently touch Tony’s face.
“Tony, the board has rights. We’ll fight them on it, of course.” Obadiah picks up the abandoned glass of scotch from the coffee table. “But my boy, they don’t believe this new direction is in the best interest of the company.”
Zeus’s eyes narrowed and he began to look mad. “Do not be a fool Hera, any son of mine must be strong.”
Hephaestus shakes his head slightly to come back to himself. He forces out a small laugh and tries to give a charming smile, “Well I’m Tony.”
Hephaestus’s eyes widen and he feels something far greater than he had ever seen on Olympus. Hades’s eyes hold dust and ashes, an end of all ends.
The table really was extraordinarily long even for the number of gods gathered, and Zeus took his place at the head with Hera to his right again. Hephaestus occupied the seat next to his mother, but could only stare at his plate.
The Hydra agents, who sadly do not find Hephaestus to be that funny, move to attack. Steve rushes forward. One of the agents gets a hit in first, but of course this is Steve’s first real fight. Super serum or not, everyone has the “flinch response.” Steve’s brain is probably screaming that he needs to get out or he’s going to die.
Why would he not be here? Was she not the perfect wife and woman? Was he that much of a fool to miss her giving birth to “his” son?
Surrounded by stiff suits and Pepper’s disapproval on the line, all Tony could do was nod along like nothing was amiss.
He’s never loved the cold before. Winter evades and melts off him, an opposite to his internal flame. Tonight however, he thinks he can understand just a little why some people enjoy the season. Its beauty is pretty undeniable.
But that brings up the question once again of why the fuck would she do something so nice for him in the first place?
Steve shakes his head in denial, but taking in a deep breath, bends the metal of the already broken barrier to make more room.
He realizes that he must be dreaming still, because he tries to speak but nothing comes out. He isn’t in control of this body.
Both men startle and turn around at the sound of a woman’s voice. Peggy Carter, like Hephaestus, is in uniform. She looks apologetic about interrupting, but steps forward anyway. Her face is surprisingly grim.
The thought is bitter more than anything. He’s sure this will be just as painfully long and full of meaningless death.
“Uh huh.” Fury meanders away from the window and around the couch. “Probably should have guessed that with the way you completely ignored the cover story we so graciously provided.”
It’s so much more difficult than you’d think to get out of a celebratory drink when a dozen other men are insisting on it. Especially when the men seem to be already drunk on their liberation from Hydra.
Against every instinct screaming that this is his last chance to back out, to remain in hiding, Tony squares his shoulders and flips the switch to open the ramp.
Tony barely remains standing when Vanko tries to throw him. He grits his teeth behind the mask, brought down to one knee, and keeps one arm raised as he grips the line.
Fighting with her on that just didn’t seem worth it. Not when he’d already put her through so much already.
Tony forces himself to grab the neckline of his worn t-shirt. He slowly pulls it over his head and easily tosses it onto the counter.
Hades only gives a smile that looks so, so sad. His face shows the centuries he’s seen even before Hephaestus was alive.
He would feel immense excitement to show his mother a new invention, and then a deep sorrow when she rejected to even see him at all.
Thank the fucking gods, their little group understands that, on a deep instinctual level. So they survive by shamelessly distracting one another.
He takes the stairs two at a time to the roof. When he busts open the door, Stane is standing right there with an easy smile.
“Don’t you mean where we’re landing?” Steve’s expression turns pinched at that, but Hephaestus ignores him.
“Okay.” She nods her head slowly before picking up his forgotten glass of champagne. “I’ll leave you to it. Just please promise me that you’ll take care of yourself?”
Ares ignored him. This was how he always acted when they were with anyone though. Hephaestus did not know why. He just knew not to question it because honestly, he was not good in many ways. He did not blame Ares. He understood.
From what he can tell the thing was actually defective. If it was working properly, they would have been blown up as soon as they were on top of it.
This is going to be a long night. And if there’s any occasion where he has the excuse to drink, it’s at his own birthday party.
Phillips looks at him for a moment. “Lieutenant, I’m glad to have you on board. It’ll be great to get an opinion from someone who’s not a complete egghead.”
he knows) if he truly wants to go back to Olympus, he’ll have to promise the one thing they’ve always wanted.
She looks just as beautiful as she did in his dream. But the quick look and smile she sends him is painfully empty.
That isn’t to say some freaking out wasn’t involved, but Tony has a feeling they just don’t truly grasp what his godhood means.
He would have driven himself into insanity if the older god hadn’t allowed him to access to a lab after their first conversation.
After a few painfully long moments of waiting for the explosion that will never come, Steve opens his eyes. He looks at the General, confused, until he sees the signs on the crates next to him. They read: M-56 TRAINING GRENADES - INERT.
energy, ripples through the Earth like an emergency flare begging for any good Samaritan’s attention.
Hephaestus knew all of this, even without ever seeing his father regularly. He didn’t need Ares to tell him.
Steve shakes his head slightly. “I don't remember it being ever that easy. This guy packs a wallop.”
Hephaestus takes a deep, shaky breath. A thought occurs to him that he wishes he didn’t have to voice aloud. “Even if we become sure we’re facing something that threatens our universe, I don’t think most of Olympus will listen to us.”
He can’t afford to slip up with his name. He would rather not find out what Hades would do if he revealed he wasn’t who he said he was.
Hephaestus can’t see his face, but the voice sends shivers down his spine. He’s never heard Steve sound that angry.
They leave together and all Tony can do is watch and hope he isn’t making one of the worst mistakes of his immortal life.
Most of it is useless and unclear, but the power source that’s been haunting him since 1943 sends shivers down his spine.
He smacks his lips in contentment before speaking. “I didn’t think you’d still be around, buttercup.”
“Two, I’m here in order to ensure certain events take place. So if I ask you to do something, I expect it to get done.” Hades pauses, “As my assistant, you’ll be working as an engineer, which from what I understand won’t be much of a change. The only difference though is that everyone will be thinking you’re my lackey, so you’ll have to dumb down the science and just follow my lead. Howard Stark is an industrial genius, multi-millionaire, inventor, and businessman. His specialty is weapons.”
“Sure, but First Lieutenant? That’s far more impressive. Really impressive. I actually thought that you might just be a recruiter.”
Because here’s the bottom line, once they became cemented as allies, Tony would have no choice but to disclose his identity to Thor.
He must be hallucinating, because the god of the dead actually slings his arm around Hermes’s shoulders good-naturedly. Like they’ve been pals for
There’s a chirp in response and Tony chokes out a laugh when the useless piece of junk gracelessly drops the blanket on his lap.
How can Hades expect him to choose if he hasn’t even been kept informed? It’s as he predicted and really, there’s no satisfaction in being right about that.
“Huh. That sounds utterly exhausting, darling.” His right-hand gestures flamboyantly, harmlessly. A well-practiced misdirection of a left-handed thief.
It would be so easy to let the anger consume him, too easy, but he has to remember that Thor has no idea who he is.
Despite the late hour, several people remain working in the large building designated as the Allied Headquarters for this base. It’s a constant movement brought about by desperation and a lack of choice. Understandably, sleep doesn’t seem so important when a war is raging.
Looking at Steve though, at this human who decided to become Hephaestus’s first friend despite everything, he knows one thing with a bone-deep certainty.
Steve was asked to go to a meeting with Carter and the others specializing in strategy so Hephaestus figured he’d have the chance to slip away.
There’s a part of him that resents his power like everything else that comes with being Hephaestus. But another part, the same part that was excited about just creating again, argues that he should just accept it and use it.
As much as his friends deserve to know the truth, Tony kept as many details to himself as possible. Not knowing may be the only thing keeping them safe if something were to happen in the future. He hates to think it’s a possibility, but he has to be realistic.
Wry, but willing to try again, Gaia and Ouranos produced twelve children, the Titans. They were as beautiful and wonderful as the first children had been hideous. Ouranos was so fond of them in fact, that he granted them power and control of many different aspects of the natural world.
The automatons. Creatures crafted out of metal and endowed with life by his own hands knowing full well they were going to manipulated into Ares’s design.
How dare he flaunt his ignorance, willfully brutalizing something he crafted for the sole purpose of creation?
The spontaneous long road trip in and of itself is annoying, but dealing with Senator Stern and his liberal use of a gavel is just horrendous. Not to mention Justin Hammer.
“No!” Tony forces the suit to go faster, but he knows he won’t get there in time to stop the devastation.
“My brother is a delight.” Hades gestures a sarcastic flourish, then rolls his eyes, “Please move on.”
The young god, now looking like the age of a human teenager, replied, “Do you think I’m not giving myself deadlines, Ares?”
Steve wanders over to a dartboard on the wall next to their table, casual and confident. It’s absurd how this is the same man who, just a few moments before, was bashful in the face of a simple compliment. He picks up a dart and weighs it before throwing a bullseye. Steve blinks in surprise, but attempts to school his expression.
After about an hour of explanations and the closest three bots can get to a hug, Tony sits up to make himself a smoothie.
Schmidt presses the button to close the elevator without a response. Hephaestus curses loudly. Sure he knows who has the power source, but he can’t do anything at the moment about the monster who fucking has it.
No one needs to say that the Axis powers have produced a threat far more terrifying than anyone can comprehend.
It’ll drain his energy for one thing, but for another he’ll end up going insane. (Can gods even go insane? Probably.)
It was very loud in the room, and normally he would be okay with that, but Hephaestus did not recognize any more than half of the gods here.
Shocked silence permeates the room until Bucky breaks it. He sounds hysterical. “You don’t have one of those, do you?”
He hasn’t seen Hermes in centuries. Maybe even a millennium. He’d always been the most elusive of his siblings (although now he knows they’re just cousins).
Steve deserves someone worthy of his kindness. Hephaestus shouldn’t delude himself into believing that's him.
“Dread Pirate Fury must rule the sky with an iron fist, huh? I wonder where old Nicky keep his doubloons – actually, now that I think about it, he seems more like a buried treasure guy. Imagine the sheer number of codes he’d use for his treasure map.”  Tony shudders dramatically.
They pause outside of the busy recruitment office. Both watching the steady current of people moving in and out.
his heart makes against his chest, but he really can’t because it feels like it’s trying to crawl its way out of his throat.
He holds out a hand and tries to make his smile reach his eyes. “It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner. You're work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled. Also, a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster.”
Some of the men laugh, but Dugan silences the group with a look. “I’d drive it in the hanger, boys. The man deserves the promotion if he got us all out of that hell.”
His reasons for witnessing the fighting firsthand aren’t entirely the same as before, although he knows they are still selfish.
So Tony steps out and embraces the cold. He lets himself admire the landscape as he begins to make his rounds around the perimeter.
He did say running before walking is necessary sometimes, but seriously he did not mean to imply live projectiles is the best way to learn defensive maneuvers.
The General just sighs in exasperation. “Do you know how long it took to set up this project? The groveling I had to do in front of Senator Brandt’s committee? They’ll think I’m cutting out paper dolls.”
Death may have been a constant all his life, but Steve couldn’t stand the idea of losing someone else he cares about. Zemo exposed what he had been denying all along. That he wasn’t a man that couldn’t live without war or a man that could live with war. He was just lost.
Hephaestus knows without a doubt what he’s been looking for is in the titanium box held by Zola himself.
“Before Olympus and at the beginning of time itself, there was only Chaos in the universe.” Ares began.
“I appreciated the help with the whole Stane debacle, but I’m really not interested in anything you’re selling.”
Once he makes it into the kitchen and the coffee is brewed, he gulps it down straight out of the carafe because a) he’s the only one there and b) it’s not like his tongue can get burned.
He nods, “Then you know that I must go.” He looks directly at Hephaestus, “I’m certain this will not be the last time we see each other.” He grins, and after they shake hands once more, the doctor is off.
“SHIELD was kind enough to write you a cover story.” She leans over to grab a thin stack of flashcards off the table. “So just read it word for word.”
(Although later, Hephaestus would realize that his mother’s silence had been much worse for him in the long run. That damn need for approval…)
“No! Not without you!” Bucky explodes. His hands slam the metal barrier and Hephaestus realizes what he has to do.
Ares and Athena probably just haven’t come to Earth yet to retrieve him because of business on Olympus and Zeus’s banishment, but if he could just get up there…
“You’d think I’d finally get the courage to come visit on an anniversary or something, but no. It’s a random fucking Tuesday in October. The twenty-fifth in fact, not that it matters.”
Before Thanos, before the sudden end and agonizing fight to bring back half the population, Steve thought he knew loss. Knew the suffocation of grief.
Steve is unfairly magnetic and no matter how much the practical side of his brain warns him against it, Hephaestus can’t stay away.
He thinks he saw Bucky tucked up in a corner somewhere, but inside the “Whip & Fiddle Pub,” (Honestly, whose idea was it to name the place that?) it’s too crowded to really tell.
“And not Hodge? Who passed every test we gave him? He’s big, he’s fast, and he takes orders. He’s a soldier!”
“Tony, who do you think locked you out?” Stane says, tone full of pity. “I was the one who filed the injunction against you.”
A loud bang resonates from behind the Titan. Before either of them can react, the door crumbles, flying off the hinges and nearly hitting Koios.
“You don’t like music?” Bucky asks. Hephaestus finally notices that he’s trying to flirt with the agent and failing spectacularly. He’d laugh at Bucky’s expense, but the reason for Carter’s cold shoulder makes something inside Hephaestus twist in pain.
It awed Hephaestus sometimes, whenever he would over hear gods speaking about it in passing conversations.
Hades voluntarily went to ground and it seems like his wife was left to pick up the pieces. The pieces being Tony and the fall that should have killed him.
It's so strange that he feels caught up now on the Earth’s politics. Particularly current events and World War II.
Hephaestus, despite living for thousands of years, thinks he’s finally beginning to understand what that means.
Jones, Barnes, and Tony, the three who plan to follow onto the train, tense in preparation. Steve doesn’t wait another second.
All jokes aside, Pepper and Rhodey have taken his god status extremely well. It constantly catches him off guard, just how accepting they’re both being, because he doesn’t think he’d be able to give himself the same courtesy.
“Yeah.” Tony tries to keep his voice carefully light and swings his legs idly. Bits of snow from the bottom of his boots fall.
It’s unimportant, a waste of valuable brain space, and has absolutely no precedence considering the context of the situation, yet Tony finds himself thinking it anyway.
Agent Carter looks like she tried to move for the bomb, but froze once Steve got there first. Everyone else, including Hodge, had scrambled away in panic.
And so Hephaestus, who still longed for anything even resembling affection, had tried to cling to Ares.
Tony doesn’t see the blood draining from Pepper’s face or the way Rhodey brings a shaky hand up to his mouth. He only sees the aftermath, when he gets the courage to look at their reactions after several minutes of heavy silence.
And his mother had told him that she was very disappointed and until he learned how to speak properly, she would not talk to him.
Tony rolls his eyes, but can’t quite help the small, fond smile that creeps onto his face as he watches the two men shove at each other playfully.
He knows mortals have short lives, but this war they are in now is ruthless and vicious. It lacks mercy and anything but blood and violence.
Following his instinct, Hephaestus ponders the intricacies of forced induction and quickly runs a few mental simulations of different variations.
Tony walks out and takes the podium. He glances at the reporters sitting in anticipating, tense silence. “Been a while since I was in front of you. I figure I'll stick to the cards this time.”
Tony tries to keep the disgust from invading his expression because as much as it is about greed, he understands that people’s jobs are on the line.
There’s a box of Ray’s pizza (Joe’s is objectively better. That should be strike fucking one. Jeez.) on the coffee table. Pepper sits down to work on the couch behind it.
They meet the standard three times a day. The most disorienting part is that he can’t remember having a schedule this strict before, about anything, let alone food.
He stayed with Tony as they both sat at his kitchen table. Silently supported him through the long-overdue sobs that wracked his body, unaware that he wasn’t just consumed by the blood of innocent civilians, but ice and glassy blue eyes.
“When did you learn French? You’ve been holding out on me, Rogers. I’m hurt, you’ve been going to secret rendezvous’ without me, haven’t you? Stev–”
His mind races. Simulates possible outcomes for different ways he could handle this and he just knows he has to create more stress lines in Pepper’s face.
He just knows, in a deep part of his consciousness that has not awakened yet, that she is giving him everything she can.
In technical terms, it’s a multi-isotope radio-decay cell. (A manipulation of the beta decay of Pd-107 ions as an electron source for the electron capture of Pd-103. This is so that in the end, it produces an electrical cell to generate an enormous voltage and current.)
He’d already been on edge for about a week for reasons he can’t quite place, so the information, as minimal as it is, feels almost like a relief.
He smirks, “I really did not have the time to think of anything else that could power your body temporarily besides a car battery.”
Hades left after they arrived so he could do Ruler-of-the-Underworld things. He’s completely on his own.
The more time that passes, the more each memory feels like it’s become cemented as his own. Tony can attest to the fact that it's fucking disconcerting.
He knows he can’t spend all his time trying to figure out why the older god uses magic for some things, and not for others.
(He got into the Pentagon when he was twelve with just a laptop and his need to prove himself among a bunch of high schoolers.)
He didn’t know Doctor Erskine for very long, but the man knew goodness when he saw it. Hephaestus could also respect a scientist that was capable of creating something like the serum in this unadvanced age. It turns out no meddling was required.
He quips a quick greeting to his favorite spy-assassin person before shooting forward straight at Loki.
Pepper stands up from the couch to leave. Tony watches her go before turning back toward the staircase.
Steve doesn’t respond with words. Schmidt stumbles back from the force of the punch and cups his jaw.
The crux of his problem is that without a heart to transfer that power all over his body, Hephaestus wouldn’t just lose his abilities as a god.
Putting aside his pride, Tony opens the tablet’s cover and begins to manually download the information into his database.
He hears the whirl of Butterfingers disconnecting from the charging station to clean up the mess he made and pats the bot’s strut absentmindedly.
His arm encased in a virtual skeleton of wires and metal, Tony clenches his fist. Two sets of boots with their circuits exposed sit on the table next to him.
“The only thing I can think of that holds that much value is his thunderbolt.” Hades swirls his glass.
He recognizes his dog tags immediately from the glint of monel. A lump to catches in his throat, but Tony picks up the M1940 chain until the notched metal clinks in the air.
And in the dark of a cold night, when he is alone with parents made of fake joy and a concern only for their reputation he remembers longing for the spring and her words.
“Oh Tony, you really think, just because you make something it belongs to you? The pieces of the suit you left behind will change the world. The Arc Reactor will create a new era of beautiful weapons to put the power back in the right hands.” Stane points to himself, “Our hands. You just keep things so close to your chest and Vanko, my very own guardian angel, figured out what was missing.”
There’s a brief pause where the men look at each other. When they make eye contact with him, because apparently they believe Hephaestus will actually be a member of this crazy team, Hephaestus merely smiles with a helpless gesture.
“Now that’s just rude.” Tony says automatically, before lifting his shirt to take subtle sniff of his body. He involuntarily gags a little.
“You should have stayed in the deepest pit of the Underworld. No one wants or needs you here. Least of all me.” Without taking his eyes off the Titan in front of him, Tony lets fire engulf his hands. It ignites up his arms, an element capable of burning down whole cities, fleets, and armies.
“Oh yes!” Erskine agrees. “Thank you, Mary.” He looks back at Howard and then to Hephaestus. He tries to school his face into an expression that seems apologetic, but fails completely.
– Tony heaves and gasps as his lungs burn. They only give him a brief second before shoving his head back into the bucket of water.
Internally yelling at himself to cool it, he curls his hands into fists (didn’t he just give himself a pep talk about blowing his cover?) before finally registering who’s actually in the room.
The man stares at him, and Hephaestus becomes more and more aware of the hidden power surrounding him.
Steve stares at the ceiling of the bedroom Queen Shuri has been letting him use for the past few weeks. They stayed in Wakanda because their technology is by far the best to work with if they want to track down Thanos, but the location also helps in hiding from a world that has turned into chaos in the wake of losing over half their population. It’s only a matter of time before questions are asked and blame is pointed toward those who swore to defend them.
“I have to go,” he offers Hephaestus a teasing smirk that is far more dark then was probably intended. “Try not to blow anything up.”
Normally Tony wouldn’t have given the group another thought, but the name brings up memories of hushed conversations between Howard Stark and other unknown people in the mansion’s study. He only ever caught snippets of the discussions, but they were enough to raise some red flags.
“I thought we were all on the same page.” Rhodey begins to pace around the room. “And now you’re going toe-to-toe with supervillains?! This is insane–”
He doesn’t understand why she leaves, but he knows when the cold sweeps through she can’t be there anymore to soothe away the pain with fresh daffodils and promises of sunshine.
“I’m going to tell you a story, baby boy.” His gaze falls to one of the cameras in the room and laughs without humor. “A story my mama once told me.”
He’s fighting his body to keep upright, but he can’t even bring himself to be upset at Hades for placing such vivid memories of this.
“Your father is flying us to the Bahamas for a little getaway.” Her smile looks brittle around the edges.
The long second hand of the antique clock taunts him. He wonders why he even kept the ugly thing and then immediately regrets the thought because it was his mother's.
Hephaestus loves his brother. They may not be related that way by blood anymore, but Ares wouldn’t care either way. They grew up together. Hephaestus has to focus because if he’s not going to Olympus to make Zeus proud, he’ll do it for Ares.
“Captain America’s sidekick!” with a slam of his recently emptied drink on the table, Dugan turns to Hephaestus with an accusatory finger. “Don’t think you’re off the hook for giving us that gas.”
He throws his arms out, eyes now filled with fire and rage, Tony ignores the two holes now gaping on each side of the train car. He stalks forward and projects flames without care or efficiency.
Hephaestus, now determined and his head buzzing with the possibilities, scrambles off the floor to grab a blank sheet of paper from one the desks. He snatches up a pencil and begins drawing what has become so clear in his head.
Hephaestus speaks with conviction, his belief in Steve clear and firm. “You are worth so much more than this.”
And his mother would ignore him again, like she did when he couldn’t find the right words and ended up stuttering like a baby right in front of his father. He had felt so
The Titan suddenly backhands Steve across the head. The man is rendered unconscious almost immediately.
The latter was more so because of his connection to metal working. The thing was archaic, a simple pulley system, and yet the recruits fell over themselves to climb the pole with the halfway point flag –
Their first children were monstrous and terrifying creatures, including three one-eyed Cyclops and three Hundred-Handed Giants. Uranus was frightened of the dreadful children he had produced, and he banished them to the deepest pit in the Underworld, Tartarus.
For a second Steve stiffens in the embrace and Hephaestus’s screams at himself internally for fucking everything up because despite how much he tries he never seems to
Hades doesn't try to cover it up when he catches Hephaestus looking. He just tilts his head slightly in a silent question.
The spark that constantly emitted around him has disappeared, leaving Artemis’s moon as the only source of light. “You,” the Asgardian pauses, reverent now, “you are the all-taming artist. Hephaestus.”
Tony shakes his head and then looks down at his hands. “Weapons I built are being used to kill innocent people.”
“Anthony Edward Stark, what the actual fuck were you thinking?” Rhodey sounds two decibels away from hysteria. There’s no question that they both figured it out.
innovation, the forge and the flame. Whether you're on Earth or on Olympus doesn't matter. Hephaestus, you haven't defied the Fates. You can't, really. And if you fail at a goal you set for yourself than remember that despite what others may preach, you’re not supposed to be perfect. We try our best with the domains we were given. That’s all we can do.”
Sunglasses hide his bloodshot eyes and the tears that trail down his face. The press swarm like maggots or vultures, shamelessly preying on the death of a millionaire and his son.
Phillips stares at Steve for a painfully long moment. When the Colonel finally gives a resigned sigh Hephaestus feels his shoulders drop slightly from released tension.
"This reminds people that one day it will though. Although I don't know if flying cars will quite make it there."
At the shout, Hephaestus shakes his head with a fond smile and follows. He wants to say he’s following Hades, but Hephaestus knows he’s really following Steve.
Visions pass far too quickly and he tries to hold onto what pleasant memories he can in the midst of rejection and loneliness.
Everything the General just said reminds Hephaestus of Ares and Zeus. His endless training until one of them felt satisfied.
Tony’s energy reserves have only recovered to about fifty percent, so he still doesn’t try to connect with the system like he wants. He does however, poke at his most advanced AI, who he feels metaphorically startles.
Because he also sees the winter. He sees the time of the year when death sweeps across the landscape and light is hidden. Because she becomes hidden as well.
Having previously cased for all of the exits, he rushes through the crowd to get to the side entrance.
Hephaestus forces his voice to be loud enough for all of the men to hear. “The tree line’s northwest, about 80 yards from the gate. From there, you just follow the creek bed.”
He always wondered what his brother actually did down there, but never dared to ask. All he knew was that when Ares was missing, it was likely he was on Earth. (“They
Tony sends Steve a lazy salute once they make their way across the room and Steve crouches down to settle next to Bucky and Morita. It’s both an acknowledgement and a good-night.
He towered over her, spitting vial insults at his wife like she was nothing more than a wicked disgrace.
Thankfully, he hasn’t had to yell like a drill sergeant. Just watching the sped up version of basic has been enough to bring back a plethora of awful memories, thank you very much.
“My sincerest apologies. I understand my regret will mean very little at this point, but mighty Hephaestus, please know I never intended to cross the most infamous inventor in the universe. Let alone with your own creation.”
“Hephaestus, we claim ourselves as gods because of the domains we’re responsible for and our immortality which was granted to maintain them. Too many believe being a god also means we are above those who are mortal. Above mistakes.”
, to take the power source tracker with him as Hephaestus was leaving the lab earlier today just confirms that.)
“Take this transponder. Activate it when you’re ready and the signal will lead Howard right to you. I have my own as well. Just in case.”
After a few close calls and a barrel roll or three Tony does successfully stop himself from being blown up.
He did this. He deserves to relive the most haunting memory of Tony mixed with his worst failure. Tony watching his parents be murdered. Tony looking so, so betrayed. Tony on the floor in Siberia, looking
“The mission was to retrieve him from the castle of Johann Schmidt, the head of Hitler's special weapons and science division, or HYDRA. You see, when Erskine refused to cooperate with the Nazis, he tried to escape with his family to Switzerland in 1935. But Hitler sent Schmidt after him, and forced Erskine to finish the formula.
Odin bowed his head slightly in gratitude, but was looking at Ares. “I thank you for such a kind gift.”
He can’t imagine what Steve had to go through since being recovered from the ice. It’s an awful curse.
His shoulders are broader again, although his facial structure looks eerily similar. How didn't he notice that before? Tony blames the military and their lack of mirrors.
So when the weight of the war bears down on them, when they are on their knees feeling like Atlas holding up the sky, they pull each other back up. They keep each other’s sanity.
Pepper doesn’t say anything, but a Gorgon’s piercing stare is less terrifying than the look she’s giving him.
But the boy learned to be grateful for the god of war’s tolerance of him. Because he knew how awful it was to want such a silly thing.
Because what terrifies him the most? Being directly responsible for someone else’s mind being wiped. Taken apart and put back together just because he couldn’t keep a simple,
Blow after blow the ice rains down on Tony. He tries to overwhelm it, but the fleet turns to snow and water mixed with slush.
Tony is so caught up in his spiraling thoughts that when a gentle hand lands on his shoulder he completely freezes.
He wants to stay in the room, grasp onto the physical reminder of his friends being alive, but keeping watch requires going outside and walking the perimeter.
It’s tentative at first, but as soon as he touches the system, Tony’s mind floods with data and numbers.
His focus is so intent that any feelings he has toward the Vibranium and what it is are pushed aside. He can only be sparked with even more joy at the fact that he gets to forge with a metal worthy of such an important task. A metal that he created and would never have expected to find on Earth.
He began presenting his inventions before the gods in the throne room, so they could properly gasp at his displays.
He could guess someone planted a memory, perhaps used coercion. Or maybe even say that Howard was just that much of an uncaring, oblivious asshole when it came to anything else besides work.
He doesn’t know if he’s ever felt this whole before. The acceptance to build this for Steve is an acceptance to give that man everything he can. Perhaps the decision was unintentional, but the ichor that usually calmly hummed in his veins feels like it’s scorching.
“Yeah, but I’ve got this to protect me.” He knocks on the Captain America shield and Hephaestus rolls his eyes. That thing is an eyesore at best. Steve continues, “Besides, where I’m landing, if anybody yells at me, I get to shoot them.”
Pushing down his excitement, Hephaestus reminds himself that the facts may not be unbiased or completely true.
Within the next breath, Koios attacks. Sharp ice descends on Tony from all directions. As a quick defense, he surrounds himself in a shield of fire.
Tony has to squint as he walks toward the smell because of the painfully pervasive sunlight. It comes with the territory of having floor-to-ceiling windows throughout his Malibu home; however, Tony refuses to blame anyone except Apollo for the annoyance.
After wandering for a while, he makes his way to the training yard. It’s fairly easy to find with all of the screaming.
“Three years ago Howard- or should I say ‘I’? I don’t want this to get too confusing for you-” Hephaestus gives him a look, “Ok right so,
Ares pushed him to continuously work, and the lack of rest made Hephaestus’s energy dangerously low, even for a god.
Jacques Dernier, who has eyes too full of mirth for a man that specialized in explosives for the French Resistance, laughs, '
because he’s about to give the performance of his life. And no Tony Stark performance would be complete without some electric guitar.
The snow crunches softly under his boots and the rock he’s sitting on is not the most comfortable thing, but the campfire roars up with a comforting steadiness.
For fuck’s sake, none of the gods care. He’ll admit that he was completely surprised to learn that most societies now actually did.
“Circle time, kiddos.” Hades claps his hands together. He plops down on one of the two chairs in the small room before gesturing for them to do the same.
Then Steve steps out, sweaty and twice his original size. Hephaestus has no time to fully process that before a loud bang explodes the room into chaos. It’s almost painful holding himself back from helping.
And because it’s in his nature to make things even worse, he naïvely assumes warning Steve would be the way to win back his trust. “There's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you.”
Of course Steve, who was previously content to just watch his unit be idiots for a while, speaks up for the first time. “Hey, Buck. I was just about to ask where you wandered off to.”
Everything Hephaestus has seen has been death and destruction and nothing else. The small moments of kindness he remembers are either gone or pushed away.
“Always.” Tony’s lips quirk upward slightly, and Pepper just shakes her head at him. She leaves the penthouse after pressing a gentle kiss on his cheek.
Bucky lets out a chuckle of his own. “Hell no. That little guy from Brooklyn who was too dumb to run away from a fight? I’m following him.”
When Steve finally picked himself up, he remembers looking at the ruins of what was once a beautiful country. No matter where he turned, all he could see was gut-wrenching. All he could see was death.
The weather is comfortable. August after all, is one of the cooler summer months for this region, full of gentle breezes and warm sunshine that cuts through the tall trees.
If Hephaestus didn’t know for a fact that the grenade was a dud, he probably would have revealed everything and razed the place to the ground. Consequences be damned.
Tony looks at his assistant. He remembers red eyes as she stood on the tarmac and glancing at her proud smile when he took to the podium for an announcement no one expected.
“So we’re running like hell and of course the first thing this guy does, crazy son of a bitch, is get in the half-track!” The words themselves may be judgmental, but Private Gabe Jones, recently freed POW from the 107th, sounds nothing less than kind and teasing.
Tony doesn’t believe him, but doesn’t have the energy to argue. There’s something more important anyway. “Someone’s been dealing under the table.”
There's no point, because Steve rewards him with a beaming smile that Hephaestus can't help but return.
A short roundabout the hallway and he finds himself entering just as the famously tempered Dr. Bruce Banner asks, “Iridium, what did they need the Iridium for?”
Just thinking about it makes Hephaestus’s hands slightly twitchy again, like with the automobile, but he can (will) control himself.
Tony hasn’t let himself think about Steve. He knows if he lets himself properly mourn he’ll break down completely.
All he can do now is wait and hope that getting his metaphorical hands on the larger database in his workshop will shed some light on the situation.
He makes conversation with them, uncaring if he comes off like an idiot. Ignoring that he’s trying to make them laugh, because he understands how priceless joy is to a soldier when every other part of war is so horrific.
He’s disgusted at himself for the satisfaction stirring in his belly from Steve’s rejection. He really does need to get his head on straight, damn it. At this point though, Hephaestus isn’t quite sure how.
“What happened to fighting the good fight? The war?” Hephaestus tries not to let his anger for others infect his tone.
A glint of red and blue metal. Then sparks of alien magic, pure unfiltered energy, explode off of a familiar shield.
Hades snaps his fingers and looks excited for a moment, “And with Doctor Abraham Erskine! He’s a man you’ll meet very soon. I met him at an international conference in Geneva, Switzerland several years ago. Brilliant man, but wasn’t working on our side until I participated in a rescue operation with SSR agent Peggy Carter. She’s also brilliant! A firecracker that one…” he trailed off, but quickly got back on topic.
“Are you?” Rhodey’s tone is soft, but it still sounds like an accusation. “Because from where I’m sitting you’ve been through and are currently going through a lot of shit. If you
Tony grins, moving his eyebrows in a way that's too ridiculous to be taken seriously. Let alone as something actually flirtatious.
Steve then looks down at his lap and smiles self-deprecatingly. “You just seem so confident all the time. Thought maybe talking to you might help calm me down a little.”
“Good job, boys.” Fortunately, Romanoff interrupts Tony’s panic over the comms. Only seconds later, a team of SHIELD operatives are deployed from the Quinjet to properly arrest Loki.
