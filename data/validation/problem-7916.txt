Steve shuts his eyes. “Yeah,” he nods. “Yeah, I did.”
Peter doesn’t look at him. “Why?” He asks, voice absent, distant.
“But you’re not making the decisions,” Ross sneers, “and isn’t that great?”
He thinks, Fury knows. They’ll all know, now. When he sits there, hands folded in front of him, slightly spaced out but giving that damn presentation his attention to the best of his ability. Prick still hard in his pants, legs spread beneath the table, not even allowed to wear underwear. He thinks, this is the punishment; still leaking, phantom hands on his skin, while Steve smirks, and they all know.
He’s just a dog, Tony, the first voice manages wearily. Why would HYDRA want him? As a matter of fact, why do they want you? You aren’t being held hostage, listen to what the doctor is telling you. You’re at a facility, you’re in the ward again. The doctor said Steve isn’t allowed to visit, and neither are any of the Avengers, because of what happened. Listen, Tony, listen to him or you’ll be sucked in here and never let out again.
Steve steps closer, takes Tony’s wrist in his. Examines his palms with gentle fingers. “You need bandages.” He says, lightly.
"I," Tony frowns "I hit my head."
"I think," Steve murmurs "you're really relaxed right now, aren't you?"
Jarvis says, Captain Rogers. He’s in the elevator. He’s brought a gift.
they seem to think,
“Ah,” the man says, regretfully, pulling back. “Am I stepping on toes?”
“You look — you look good, Tony.”
Steve and his thick wide fingers pressing bruises into his waist, the grip of his wrist holding back his head, easily powerful, completely in control. There’s an instinctual panic; Tony’s stupidly socked toes tighten on the rail, he makes a pathetic whimpering noise, but Steve doesn’t even break stride.
Steve wishes he could do that, that he could be so casual with his touches. But he knows that Natasha, for all the trouble she caused Tony, was always on his side. That she saw Tony’s view in a way that Steve never could. And so Tony doesn’t appear to mind so much when she holds the straw to his lips and lets him drink. She removes two candy bars from her pocket, and Steve recognises them as that high-calorie junk that they used to feed the undernourished children on his peace missions to Cambodia. Natasha leaves them surreptitiously on the bed and exits smoothly; Steve envies her this, her ability to interact with Tony and her freedom to come and go without fear of consequence.
Dread dropped into Tony's gut.
Peter felt his mouth open. "What? Why?"
"Meditate, usually."
Peter was glad that Tony guided him away. He wasn't sure if there was sound or not. Everything blurred. Then he relaxed when he found himself alone in a room with Tony.
Peter rolled his eyes. "Wasn't going to leave you."
"Hey, sit, sit down." Wong waved a hand and a chair appeared behind Strange.
Dr. Strange seemed convinced. "Give me a moment to wash up, I'll take that IV out. Then I'll woosh you back home." He handed the prescriptions to Vanessa and walked away.
Christine leaned back and looked between the two of them. "I don't think it's so complicated." Her lips quirked up in a soft smile. "Looks good on you..." She let out a breath. "You okay?"
"I feel great, Pep." Tony sighed and laughed. "Feel like I can breathe."
"Sl-owly." Maggie deadpanned.
Maggie sighed. "Do you know why I jumped on board with helping you on this as soon as Lizzy told me she got hurt?"
"Uh, hi." She held out her free, gloved hand. He held out his own hand and shook hers. She could tell, even under the sleeve that he was missing at least part of his other arm. "You talk about me?" She looked up at Strange.
The brick was free.
"Had a little anxiety." Peter said. "Not related to the baddie. Just a weird thing. I'm going to be fine." Peter promised. "Happy got me some water. I took the guy out real easy. He didn't know about me, just figured I was an intern at SI."
"Yeah, nope. Not gonna risk it."
"This doesn't make sense." Vanessa said, shaking her head as she held her phone to her ear.
Peter stayed outside of his school for a moment. They'd be upset if he had his phone out inside. "Thanks for checking on me."
Strange was at the doorway to her room with a bag in his hand. "Not sure if these can be salvaged, but your clothes." He put the bag down inside her door, but didn't cross the boundary.
"Yes, it is." Morita nodded in agreement.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Hawkeye, you copy?" Nat was saying.
Strange walked away, right up to a nurse like it was his hospital, not Cho's.
"Stephen, is she doing alright?"
"Alright. Deal. But you really have to start trying. No more faking your way through it."
"That's low, Lizzy."
"That is?"
Peter didn't stop crying the whole way to the tower.
His friend was dead...or was she?
Okay. Stay safe, Roo. Love you.
Maggie tried to smile, but wasn't sure it worked. She couldn't feel her face. She almost wanted to laugh. Would Wade sing the song if she hummed it? Could she hum? She wasn't sure her throat could make those noises right now.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Thanks," Peter reached into his wallet.
Ness pulled Maggie away. Wade followed Strange to the living room.
"How are you doing, kid?"
"That way." She pointed to the wall she kept looking at. "It's that way and it's...it's been all day. Like a volcano biding it's time till it erupts. I hate feeling this paranoid all the time."
Peter kept walking.
Even with his movements slowed, his perception of time far slower than hers, there was a smile quirking on Strange's lips. Shit, what was he planning?
Maggie waited. Strange returned, looking much more like a doctor than a wizard and he wrapped the curtain around her bed.
Vanessa took a shaky breath. "I...um... We didn't see so much of her, it was mostly Peter. They did hit her a lot. They hit her head against the wall more than once. I don't remember anything sharp being used... Um. I don't know a lot of this is new. She didn't look this bad in the last pictures we got."
"How did you know it was the heartbeat?"
Maggie stumbled upwards and pressed the card to the lock. The door beeped and clicked open. She turned the handle and pulled it open. Immediately she raised the brick in her defense.
Peter nodded. He had a sneaking suspicion that Maggie had a dark past, he wasn't going to take her need for personal space personally. He knew trauma and he knew it didn't always make sense. "We're getting there. Thanks again, by the way."
"Hurts."
Peter frowned. "I can't hide, Dad. He knows my name, he'll probably look after me, might even stalk me a little bit. It's for the best that I don't act weird or threatened."
"Alright, done."
"May?" He asked. Her head turned, as if she'd heard him.
Well, shit. No wonder the textures of people's skin were off. Holograms couldn't mimic textured skin no matter how much they LOOKED right.
"Seems to be going around." She frowned, then gave him a soft smile. "Hope you feel better." She finished stretching out, then switched legs.
"Not here, Ned." Peter shook his head. "Are you okay?"
"Not really. I'm dyslexic. My powers exacerbate it too. It's hard to focus on things. Math is easy. All the stuff with reading and writing is hard. My brain focuses more on the blank spaces than processing the letters."
Clint straightened up. "Ooh, can I help you ask?"
"I know that now." Peter nodded. "How is it that this disguise is so good? It's not one of your masks."
Peterman:
"I can't eat and fly. I'd hurl. Besides, Dad's making dinner, and that is not something I wanna spoil."
"OUR good kid. But, really, we're still on for tonight, right?"
"I'm okay. Had much worse."
"Don't know until you talk to her about it." Steve said. "That's how we started." He pointed to Tony. "Gotta talk about these things."
She didn't want to have to do that again...but she had to.
"I think I'll be okay." She nodded. "Can we take the subway?"
"Me neither." Clint agreed.
"Have you hit your head as well?" Strange asked, eyes narrowed.
Steve's face was firm, set in stone. "They can't keep him from us. We'll find him."
"Where's Wade?"
"Miscommunic-cation be'ween brain and-d body."
He could go find a hidden place and take them off for a few minutes. That helped. Then he'd be able to rub the actual part that hurt. "Thanks, bro. I'm okay though." He promised. He couldn't risk it. The world already knew the Stark-Roger's adopted son was named 'Peter' and if Peter got caught with his prosthetics off or even his prosthetics on show...there went the whole charade. And he wasn't ready for that.
"Sorry. Life is really crazy. I got distracted. But anyway, dad and pops are planning their wedding...well, actually, Zia Pepper is. She's a badass."
"The silver suit isn't the same. It isn't protected against those kinds of things. You can overload the power source if you hit him with lightning. Tell Thor to aim for the chestplate."
All things considered, Maggie didn't look bad. Strange had seen patients look much worse, but even he had to agree that looking at her made his stomach turn. Maybe it was because he knew her, he cared about her. No, he loved her, that was a more apt description.
"Thanks, Dr. Cho."
"Just one more minute, Karen."
Christine didn't know what that was about, she was just glad that the young girl was safe where no one could hurt her.
"Learned that one the hard way. Experience teaches pretty well." Maggie shrunk a little, glad she didn't seem to offend him. She remember the first time she thought a punch wouldn't have the same force when slowed down...that had been a painful mistake.
"Peter was pushed?"
"Nat!" Peter swung down to the woman.
“Give me a minute,” Tony finally manages, breathing deeply through his nose. “I need... a minute.”
“So people eat here,” Steve said incredulously. “And, and people sit here. For breakfast and lunch and things. You need to put pants on before you come in here.”
“You know. You, on top? You're going to have to take point on this, Captain,” Tony grins.
“Tony! Tony, what's wrong?” Steve demands, suddenly hovering over Tony on the bed. “Tell me!”
“Lock the doors, Jarvis!” Tony huffed, already winded. He followed Steve, turning the hallway corner just in time to see Steve rip the door to his room off its hinges.
“You can't... This is the kitchen,” Steve said sternly, gesturing to Tony with a wave of the hand.
Steve stops. Stops and stares at Tony, who hesitates in the face of Steve's obvious stare.
gets to come, spilling over Steve's hand and clenching up around Steve's dick.
ass?”
And the awe and pure want in that voice makes Tony bite the pillow and not say anything, because he wants Steve to have this. To really, really love his first time, despite all the mess they've made of it so far.
“Not joking, so not joking,” Tony assured him. “Really, Steve. Have you met me? Nothing sexual is ever offensive to me. And I mean, ever.”
“No, really, I want you to, just, uh, no teeth? It kinda hurts,” Steve says, and wow, the man is crimson all over with how hard he's blushing.
“Yes,” Steve says, blushing a little, still avoiding Tony's eyes. “Yeah, I do.”
“Well, it's not pliable either, so this is clearly not happening,” Tony sighs in frustration. “Jeez, and all I wanted today was a little sex.”
“You do? Wow, that's very human of you. Beach outing, everyone! We're going beaching!” Tony said with glee.
“Tony, are you okay?” Steve asks then, sudden concern in his voice.
“Well, Cap, you see, there's this thing I like to do occasionally. It's called being comfortable in my own home. My house, my rules. And I say, pants are entirely optional at all times. Especially team meetings,” Tony said, going to search for Pop Tarts or toast or some other edible thing.
It should not come as a surprise to anyone that Tony went pants-less in his own house. Considering all the press he'd gotten since he began dating, and all the attention he drew to himself with his lifestyle and his habits, everyone in the free world should know what kind of man he was. Compared to everything else about him that had made the headlines so far, going pants-less in his own home was nothing. It was outright polite, for Tony.
Steve looked at him with a dazed smile. “Really?”
Steve shuts him up with a kiss, and they start making out against the fridge, but then Steve pops wood again, and Tony admits he's too tired for a round two.
Steve blushes so hard it looks painful, then hangs his head. “Terrible. Really, really terrible at this.”
“Your other hand, Steve, Jesus, why would you need to rub extra spit into my sheets?”
“And here I thought we were being pretty, well, pretty normal for people having sex,” Steve says, grinning into his glass of milk.
“Check the downstairs living room!” Tony yelled after Bruce's retreating back. “Bolts should be there!”
“Oh, I do,” Tony confirms. “But, uh, I think I might need an ice pack. For my ass.”
“You wanna come back to my place? Uh, my room?” Tony asks, grinning up at Captain America. “I mean, since the elevator is right over there. And we're kinda in my house. Building. Whatever.”
Steve helps him get dressed, and they hobble down to the kitchen, Tony insisting he'll walk it off and Steve insisting they call a doctor. It turns out Tony is right, and after a while, his hip is just fine. But he still insists they stretch before getting into bedroom gymnastics next time.
Natasha came sashaying into the kitchen, those magnificent hips swinging. “Are we going to the beach? I love the beach.”
Tony tries again, careful to cover his teeth, and this time Steve starts moaning, so something must be going right. Tony remembers some of his own favourite blow jobs, and tries to do that thing that Tina used to do, cupping his balls and maybe rolling them a little.
“Speak for yourself, I think I'm doing pretty good with not dying from being impaled on your Kraken cock,” Tony huffs, then hesitates. “Should I... Should I spread my legs, maybe?”
Which makes even Steve's poor, bitten lip fail as a safety measure, and the super soldier comes, too, making this shocked, breathy noise as he bucks erratically into Tony.
“Sorry, Thor,” Steve said, his voice strangled, and bolted from the room.
Tony gaped. Oh. Oh!
Steve, not convinced, grabs Tony right back and strokes his dick a little. Tony bites his lip. “Well, why doesn't
“Natasha, you can't be okay with this. He's not wearing any pants!” Steve insisted.
“Tony, what's that on my leg?” Steve asks, sounding a little worried.
Steve stared at the scientist. “Because – because it's a kitchen! People eat here!”
Steve has been trying to get over his feelings because he knows Tony doesn't normally do relationships, and Tony has been very confused because he's never gotten hard over seeing a man naked before. But in the end, Tony being hard and gaping at Steve is just the push that the captain needs, and he kisses the shorter man for the first time. Then Tony gets this “Oh! Oh, I get it now!” expression on his face, and kisses him back.
Steve does, and they do. Steve is naked, Tony is naked, and Steve is kissing the other man. They're both on the bed, they're both lying down, and then they're suddenly both lying on their backs next to each other on the duvet.
“Tony!” Steve gasps, suddenly looking horrified. “I hurt you!”
Steve smiles bashfully. “But I'd still really like you to... to be on top, if that's okay.”
in his hip and everything hurts.
“Uh... I don't know,” Tony admits, not releasing Steve's dick. “I don't know how they... we... decide which one goes where.”
Steve struggles a little, turning the condom over, then grabs it and – puts his finger right through the thin rubber. It breaks. Steve gapes at Tony. “How did that happen?”
“And I like you, and we want to have sex and stuff. With each other,” Tony clarifies.
“I can't... get it in. Here, let me try with my fingers,” Tony suggests, and presses two fingers against Steve's entrance.
“No, no, Steve, it's fine, just,” Tony rambles, because this is starting to actually feel good now and they should both get to finish sometime this century. “Just, see, this one. Then touch me.”
Apparently, not everybody felt the same way about that.
“Really, Rodgers,” Tony said, then put a hand on Steve's shoulder. “Hey. I'm kinda frustrated over you, too, y'know? Those pecs. Those shoulders. That ass.”
He's still struggling with condoms.
And finally, Steve strokes Tony with a spit-slick hand, and the shorter man groans in pleasure and bucks up. Steve keeps up his steady, slow thrusts and bites his lip hard to stop from coming too soon. And Tony, finally,
“We were, but you're ninety and I'm about halfway there,” Tony says with a sleazy grin. “I mean, it's a miracle your heart didn't give out. Especially when the condom -”
Steve Rogers, on the other hand, has kissed two women before he went into the ice, and, well, exactly no women that counted since he came out. That is to say, he's not kissed anyone that he really wanted to kiss since Peggy. And, needless to say, he has slept with exactly zero women. But he was in the army, and he was friends with Bucky before the war. He's heard things. He knows things. Surely, some of the things he knows must be worth something. Even if his sexual orientation runs more along the lines of “hopeless romantic”.
Steve just kept reaching new levels of red-facedness. “Tony, please. Don't joke about this.”
“We're terrible at this,” he chuckles.
Steve nodded. “Yeah. But you don't, I mean, I think you don't play that field, and that's okay, and we can just forget about it, but I thought... Maybe you can start wearing pants around me. Please.”
“Actually...” Steve said, arms coming up around Tony. “I don't mind so much, if you're serious about the making out.”
“That sounds good,” Steve agrees cautiously.
“Tony!” Steve sputtered, outraged, as Tony wandered into the kitchen one morning in search of coffee. Well, technically it was early afternoon, but Tony was awake and working.
“No, Rogers, Jesus,” Tony gasps, offended. “I am not asking my AI to research gay sex for me, have some respect for the poor thing's nerves!”
“I'll show you some dirty movies,” Tony chuckles, then goes to sit up.
Tony gets back on the bed so fast he just about gives himself whiplash. Steve is struggling with a condom packet and Tony is shaking the lube bottle to get it ready, and then finally, the condom is out and in Steve's massive hands.
“Well, I know it's your house, Tony, and I'm very thankful to be living here,” Steve said quickly. He was looking very uncomfortable. “But... but you're not wearing any pants. That's just... rude.”
Steve smiles into the kiss and feels himself blush. This is great. Especially since, while he might not know what he's doing, Tony is an expert and so Steve should be able to just kick back and let himself be handled.
“Captain America is headed for his rooms, sir,” Jarvis said politely. “Shall I attempt to dissuade him from barricading himself within?”
Steve comes in his mouth, no warning or nothing. Just a huge spurt of viscous, bitter slime down Tony's throat. The engineer sputters, Steve moans, and things get messy for a little while. Tony runs to the bathroom to spit and rinse, and Steve desperately tries to get himself back under control.
“Yeah, okay,” Tony said, then took a deep breath. He really needed to start jogging or something. “So then why'd you run away? I mean, not like I wouldn't help you out with that.”
Just then, Clint dropped from the ceiling and reached around Tony to snag the last piece of toast before the engineer could help himself. “How did they come off?”
Tony breathes. Steve waits. And, after a minute, Tony exhales and notices that it doesn't hurt any more.
“Tony, please, can't you just put some pants on?” Steve said desperately.
“It's frustrating!” Steve snapped, shooting to his feet and beginning to pace the kitchen. “Honestly, Tony, not all of us are capable of ignoring half-naked people without getting a little hot and bothered!”
“See, Steve, nobody takes this seriously except you. It's just skin; not even that much of it. Also, it's my house. I can do what I want in my house, right?”
“Tony, where's the box of various nuts and bolts gone?” Bruce asked as he refilled his mug. “I need one that's slightly worn.”
Steve shook his head, still avoiding Tony's eyes. “About me. I was in the Army, Tony, do you really think I'd get flustered over seeing just any guy in his shorts? It's... It's you. Not the pants.”
Tony looked down himself. Thin long-sleeved shirt, charcoal boxer briefs, house slippers. He looked back at Steve. “Yeah? So?”
never done this before!” Steve says, then sits up. “Wait, Tony, what do you mean you've never done this before? You're... you're a playboy!”
“Well, how hard can it be?” Tony asks rhetorically, and reaches for the nightstand. “Maybe we should just start having sex and see what happens?”
Steve looked up at him without really raising his head, and Tony thought he'd never seen anyone more beautiful. “You... Really?”
“Ow! Motherfucker!”
“Bruce, back me up here,” Steve said. “Tony needs to wear pants in the kitchen.”
“Oh, uh, ow, I guess?” Tony breathes, shuffling a little on the sheets. It's uncomfortable. A little painful. But nothing like the stuff they experience in battle, so he doesn't say anything to Steve.
Tony stilled. This, he sensed, was a window of opportunity he should not ignore. “So you don't get flustered over people not wearing pants, in general. You're attracted to me.”
“No, please, Tony,” Steve said, looking anguished. “I'm sorry about what I said in the kitchen. I shouldn't have mentioned anything. Please just forget about it.”
Steve backs up a little, frowning. “Did I hurt you?”
“Yeah, but there's... Tony, I didn't think you'd be offended,” Steve said, looking at the floor. He was frowning. “I just didn't think you'd feel the same way.”
“That's good,” he murmurs, feeling Steve's fingers rubbing slowly over his ass. “Really good.”
Tony stares at him. Then he grabs Steve's dick and tugs on it a little, and Steve heaves for breath. “This, Rogers. This goes in my ass. I think. I mean, I've done anal before, only it was with a woman. The rules have to be the same, right? I mean, that part of our anatomy is pretty much the same.”
“I sleep naked, you're just lucky I put clothes on before I go downstairs to work,” Tony said. “What, it's not like you wouldn't see as much of me on the beach.”
They do start with that. And it turns out it's pretty easy to make them both come at the same time when they're face to face like that, both of them hands-on, so to speak. Then they shuffle into Tony's ensuite bathroom, both of them a little shy and slightly embarrassed, and clean off, and then back to the bed.
Steve made a strangled sound. “Nnngyes.”
“It's impractical, and cold,” Steve said pleadingly. “For you, I mean.”
So it's off with Tony's unused condom, Steve gets a towel and starts mopping up all the spilled lube, and Tony starts building a little pillow barrier across the bed.
“Definitely,” Steve agrees, then grabs a pillow. “And lift your hips.”
Steve's blush intensifies. “Well, sure, if you want. But, uh, the serum? I'm gonna be good to go again in... I guess, ten minutes.”
“Tony, we can't do this if it hurts,” Steve says, looking almost tearful. “We can do other things! Like earlier, we don't need to do this!”
“You wanna... maybe take a nap? Then we can, you know, when we wake up. Try again?” Tony suggests, and averts his eyes.
Steve frowns a little. “I still don't know what that means.”
“Yeah,” Tony breathes, and he matches Steve's movements. “Yeah, this is nice. We could start with this.”
Steve ducked his head again. “Well, the serum -”
An awkward silence falls over the bedroom. They're both still naked, and this is so incredibly awkward. Tony fidgets a little. Steve clears his throat and stares at Tony's chest, where the arc reactor glows cheerfully.
Maggie let out a quiet laugh.
Stane grabbed the badge (it took all of Peter's strength to not yank away from the sudden assult on his personal space) and looked at it. "This has access to the higher level labs. This is an Alpha badge. How'd you get THAT?"
"OH MY GAWD! STOP!"
Peter nodded and finished writing. It wasn't perfect, but it was as good as he knew how to write. "I think I've got it."
Christine just laughed.
"I ran the numbers. What Stane and his little scientists came up with, given the approximate size of the suit and the sound of the thrusters as well as joint movement..." Tony didn't have to keep going. He could tell it was going over Steve's head, but Peter was obviously taking in the numbers, the logic.
All the Avengers were working day and night to try to bring Peter and Maggie back. JARVIS was looking through everything. Wade had taken to the streets and was, in general, raining hell on everyone trying to find them.
He waited a second, then pushed them up.
"Caught him trying to break into a lab a few miles from here. May have pissed him off." Maggie shrugged, then winced in pain.
"Of course, sir."
"I wouldn't believe it, if you did."
"I wouldn't think that." Peter said. "I'd imagine you'd be bored." She was smart, he knew that. They talked about a lot of things, he could tell she was smart, clever at the very least.
"You fly in a tin can through the sky." Steve giggled. "What's the problem? This is nothing compared to how high you fly."
Maggie lifted it to him.
It took a few more minutes to get his breath back. "Sorry...sorry."
"Think it's about your parents? But who knows about that?"
"Um... Magic?" Vanessa said with a shrug, looking at Strange. "You'll have to ask him."
"Sir has been hard at work. He wanted your suit to run at its optimal capabilities and for you to have someone who could be devoted to looking out specifically for you."
"He okay?" Peter asked.
There was...one thing though they hadn't talked about.
The man started to fall.
"Okay, take it easy on the kid. Maybe let him win a game." Steve grinned.
"Strange, she just had major surgery. She needs to be in a hospital. With medicine and monitoring and people to help if shit hits the fan. You know that."
"No worries." Kate whispered. She kept her supported. "How did your dad get here so quick?" She asked idly.
"Better than you, Queens."
"No need." Steve promised. "How was school, bud?"
"Show Tony what's in the box."
Maggie giggled uncontrollably, then coughed.
Thor arrived with a bang. By bang, he arrived and slammed Tony so hard with his hammer that Tony was flung THROUGH a building. "This is fucking bullshit." Tony snapped. "Where is Captain Tight Pants when I need him?"
He needed to contact someone. Find a way to reach out to his real family without being seen. Hopefully find out that Maggie was safe and sound at her home, or maybe even Dr. Strange had come back from his fight and the two were studying magic or whatever. He hoped she was safe...that the screams hadn't been her...that the awful silence that had occurred wasn't...wasn't her death.
"Yes, Doctor." Nurse Joy called. A few moments later the curtain opened. Maggie looked better, cleaner, dressed in baggy scrubs instead of a gown. She was still pale though.
From the bed across the room. "Override, JARVIS." Peter said. "Code, Roo. He's okay. He's a friend."
"Taller buildings are easier to swing from. Physics and surface area, Dad." Peter chuckled, but held Tony a little tighter, hearing that Tony's heart was beating a little faster than normal.
Strange didn't even raise his voice, but somehow his tone lowered the boom. "I don't want to hear another word, young lady. If it were me in charge, you'd be grounded. No. You ARE grounded. As your doctor, I'm grounding you. No dance, no lifting, no sneezing, nothing. Not for at least four weeks. Any sort of stretching or training after three weeks will have to be monitored anyway. No nothing, Margaret. Got it?"
"Hello, boys. Could you give me directions to room one-thirty-eight?" Her accent was perfect Queens, like she'd live there her whole life.
"There's no argument. I win." Tony said, his head down as he texted.
"I need to see this video."
"Definitely fractured ribs." Karen said dryly.
"I like to think we have a understanding." Tony shrugged, then opened his arm. "Come here, Pete, family hug."
Maggie rolled her eyes. Then looked down. She moved on her lap and touched her empty left wrist. Her eyes looked hollow.
"She drowned with unnecessary pomp." She'd seen the paintings. How dramatic can a drowning be?
"You call Wong 'Beyoncé.' Don't even get started with me." Maggie said and made the mistake of looking down. Strange was removing a piece of gauze and it was soaked in blood. "Ugh."
"Slippery thing. Ouch." Clint looked at the wound and pulled the knife out. She'd aimed to cause pain, not to kill, she could have though. Easily. The artery was well within her reach, but she hadn't gone for it. Maybe she wasn't such a bad kid after all.
Peter's eyes met the watch on her arm. It was Maggie's watch. He knew her. "I'm safe, Karen."
It'd been three days. She hoped they were feeding Peter more than they were feeding her. She was hungry, she couldn't imagine how Peter would feel, though if they were giving him the same food they were giving her.
"And yours. You going to make time for training this weekend or are you going to be flying around the city with that spider-boy?"
"Is everything okay?"
"I'll check in in a bit, Peter. Let me know if you guys need anything." Nat nodded seriously.
Her left hand came free of the cuffs.
Peter frowned. "Sorry, Dr. Cho. I don't mean to be a problem."
Steve nodded. "Yeah, bub. I'm here. It's me."
"I'm sorry, I know that's a tough one. But we gotta know what your brain's doing. The eyes tell us a lot." Christine said, patting her shoulder.
"She got herself out..." Wade whispered in realization. "Don't envy that." His jaw tightened and he looked at Strange. "Any...other trauma? They...they threatened her w-with" Wade took a deep breath and clenched his fists in anger. "They threatened her with sexual assault. I...don't know if it was just to keep her scared or if they..."
"You called him?" Maggie asked. "Why?" Strange was busy, a lot. The universe wasn't small, and definitely needed protecting.
"Okay. I'll go find a nurse to help you. Then I'll be back, hopefully with some fluids and B- for you. Shout if you need me. Okay?"
"To be fair, it's the one class I really need help with." Peter shrugged. "Thanks, Papa."
There was a loud boom.
Peter fell to his knees. The piano music became somber, slower.
She pressed a button and her staff shrunk. Maggie put the folded staff in the holster on her back before her feet left the ground and she floated upwards. "I'm sure you can keep up."
"Yes."
"Yes, Captain." JARVIS responded.
Beck grinned. He was going to tear that kid apart when he found him. "Time to move, everyone."
"S-sir?"
Maggie looked down. "Yeah. Little rusty though. That's what happens when you get stabbed."
That was Steve's voice. Was his Papa actually there?
Wade's eyes softened. "Oh...sweetie... Why don't you go with Ness? She gives the best cuddles, you know?"
"And school?"
"Would you like to try working on it, working on making sure both work together instead of separately?"
"I'm So Happy I Could Die, this has been absolutely wonderful." Maggie pet the cloak a few more times and it flew off, returning to Stephen's shoulders.
It took a second to sink in. The Tony straightened. "JARVIS? I need you to get control of them."
"Six."
"It's Italian for aunt. I just can't... I can't say those words to other people...not after everything. It makes me feel a bit sick...like I'm betraying May or Ben. So, same meaning, different word, it feels better. Anyway. It's been cool. Pepper made them stop arguing about me. Zio Rhodey is gonna be Dad's best man and someone named Sam is Papa's. I haven't met him. Apparently they met in DC and have done some work together in the field. Papa say's he's cool."
"My brother, Sam."
"Totally incognito there." Maggie drawled.
Peter's eyes widened. "What? They closed...fifteen minutes ago."
"Sorry, Peter." JARVIS didn't sound apologetic.
"I know. You did so good, Margaret. You need to rest now, okay? You focus on healing. We'll keep you safe, promise. All you have to do is rest now."
"We can discuss it later though, if that's better."
The city was on fire. A giant monster of fire stood there. Portals and attacks did nothing to it. She focused. Knowing the fire monster wasn’t real.
"JARVIS, Frozen please." Steve agreed with Peter, knowing the agony that movie put Tony through.
"About fucking time." Vanessa hissed.
He tilted his head to the side. "You're hair's curly."
"You told me to go the other way and gave me food." Peter's eyes widened. "Thank you."
"Me and Papa chopped liver?" Tony asked.
"Yeah, unfortunately. Too many spaces to even think about protecting them all. Plus some things can naturally travel dimensions. I know a mutant who can do that, he takes no heed of doors, closed or otherwise." Strange said. "But being able to get in and out of dimensions is pretty important."
Peter went to the desk.
Peter just didn't want to deal with this anymore. Something had to give in all this craziness.
"That's what you're worried about? In your defense though, everyone thinks you're Natalie Portman now."
Peter took to changing shirts, leaving on the gray pants.
"Stark Tower not big enough for the three of us?" Tony asked jokingly. Then he squeezed tighter. "I get it, I do. There are good days and bad days and days where we just need to be alone. But space shouldn't include super suits, okay? You have to have your head in the game if you're going out there, okay?"
Clint's eyebrows pulled together. "What's up with you, Baby Elephant? You end up being collateral? Sorry, kiddo." He flopped onto the bed next to Peter carelessly.
"Hey, now, I need you to breathe. You're heart has been under enough stress lately. And let's not tear our IV's that are keeping you hydrated and full of antibiotics." Dr. Strange said, his voice calm, collected...very doctor-y.
"How about some breakfast? I'll whip something up before you head out." Steve offered.
Peter frowned and looked at his parents. They both looked tired, concerned. Waiting for a bad thing, the inevitability of it and knowing nothing could be done, was far worse than the bad thing happening. Once the craziness happened, you could actually do something about it...waiting was the worst. He leaned against his dad's side and looked out at the sunrise. Between the three of them and the rest of their super-powered family, he was sure they'd find a way.
"What can I do for you? I heard you had some sort of concern...?" Morita asked.
"There are things we're good at and things we aren't so good at. We know it, trust us. It's okay that you miss him, or if you think we're weirdos, because we are. You're pretty weird too." Vanessa said. "Our weird girl."
"Can Maggie go home too?"
Peter's heart cracked, tears ran down his eyes. "M-may?" What was that? What the fuck had that been? He covered his head and squeezed his eyes shut. He quickly climbed to the roof of the building and yanked his mask from his bag. He put it on quickly.
"Clint won't work. You need Thor. Lightning."
"I got it, sheesh." Maggie headed back down the stairs, part of her happy that the sorcerer showed concern for her. "Yo, Wong. Next time It's Britney, Bitch."
"I...I don't know. What if it ruins everything? So much is already so different. I don't want more stuff to be...you know?"
Peter hung up and smiled gently.
"Yeah, go wake up that mega nerd friend of yours and Happy." Tony patted his side. "We'll come up with something."
"Sophomore."
His own pain was dull. He thanked Cho for the super duper drugs, because he was not anywhere near pain anymore. Even when they put the brace around him, it hadn't even ached mildly.
"You two been here for how long?" Tony asked.
Even with the 'sleepy-tea' extended toward her, she didn't sense any danger. She was safe, even if every part of her didn't want to sleep near someone... especially a man. Too vulnerable. But this was Dr. Strange. She felt just as safe with him as she did Vanessa and Wade...maybe even more so, because Wade and Vanessa were far more likely to prank her or wake her up. "Um, sure." Maggie took the offered mug and took a sip. It tasted...kind of funny.
"Margaret. Margaret? Are you alright? Are you hurt?" That scream. It had to be one of pain. Of agony. He was worried that he might find blood pooling around her. But...there was none on her bed. He walked up to her and knelt down. "Margaret? Let me see. What happened?"
There was a shout and they both turned at the same time.
"Don't do that. I'll be good." Tony promised.
Maggie snorted. "I don't do drugs. Drugs are baaaad."
"We have to tell her guardians." Steve whispered. This wasn't good. It wasn't just Peter who was in harm's way...now a young girl was too. "Shit."
She made herself some eggs and toast and ate them, before downing her pills as quickly as she could. All her stitches hurt at the usually simple task. As she worked on the rest of her juice, she felt the familiar greeting of the cloak around her. "Hey, Cape-y." Sometimes she wished the sweet thing could talk back. She imagined the cape would be both sweet and sassy. "Good morning to you too."
Tony turned and looked at the doctor. "How do you know that? How can you tell from another dimension?"
"How fast can I get there?"
An apt description, Strange had to admit. "Yes. If you can focus and keep them from just happening, as they tend to do already."
"This is our party." Steve insisted.
"No, but she was close to you. Fishermen know to use the right bait." He picked up a scalpel. "Now, I'm going to need your help on this one. If I were going to cut off  something, what instrument would I start with? This is a very important choice, Peter. You're the one who's going to be feeling it, after all." He picked up a circular saw in his other hand. "How about a compare and contrast, huh? For scientific purposes. Oh, and feel free to be as loud as you like. You won't spike the audio levels for our recording, we set it up really well. What do you say, for science, Peter? Like old times?"
"Always." Wade promised, kissing her neck. Vanessa grabbed her bag and headed for the elevator. Wade patted Maggie's arm gently. "You stabbed Hawkeye right?"
The question was answered for him when he heard repulsors. Tony vaguely heard JARVIS call out a warning to him and all the other occupants. Tony ducked as the side of the building exploded.
"I've got standards." Peter muttered. Flash was a bully, but he wasn't a criminal.
Take care, everyone.
"Whenever Ned and I argue, we get to change the names in each others contacts. I changed all his contacts to JarJar once. It was cool." Peter held out his hand. "Come on, gimme."
"All three of us could." Tracy said. "Make a bit of a game out of it. It'll be good for Peter. He needs to learn some cool stuff. Maybe if he ends up liking coding we can finally keep him to ourselves." She winked. "But I'm totally going to win this game."
The video ended.
"Thanks." Peter whispered.
"Okay." Maggie agreed.
Maggie sat up straight. "You mean...like someone doesn't want to hurt him, but puts him in danger anyway? Like...bait?"
"Don' leave me."
Vanessa leaned forward and kissed her temple. "I'm sorry, sweetheart."
Tracy must've heard that comment, because she made a soft noise in protest and looked at them with wide eyes. "M-Mr. Stark...?" She gave Peter a 'what the fuck is up with him today' look.
"Show me what ya got."
"Got it."
"Hamlet's girl."
The nurse got on the loudspeaker.
"No. I've already done this in my own way. This'll be your time. Besides... I don't really want the attention their names might bring. My mom's death led to a...bit of a cold case. I don't want to have that attention. I've moved on."
She settled in and ate dinner. Weird things like this made the stark difference between her life...before, back when her Dad was alive, and this moment so different. When she was little, they always ate together, at a table...and TV was not even heard of during dinner. Weird rituals like always eating at the table were forgotten. She didn't turn Wade and Vanessa's life upside-down though. They'd given her a home and all the love and support she could ask for. And it was different, it wasn't wrong, just different.
There's going to be a few chapters of a bit more 'fluff' than usual. It's going to be a bit more character focused for a hot minute, but we'll get back around to it, promise.
Maggie laughed as they finished the episode and their dinner. "Took you long enough. Come to the dark side, we have psychological themes and interesting characters and really good looking food."
Vanessa knocked on the door. She hadn't been here before, but she already felt out of place. That feeling grew when a man in robes opened the door. "Are you Beyoncé?"
Dr. Strange looked up at the monster and huffed. This was bullshit. He sighed and revealed the time stone. He was going to undo all of the fire. Green glowed at his hands and he frowned. He felt a tug. That had been happening a lot lately. It seemed when he used the stone he could faintly feel Maggie's powers too. But this was enough.
Dr. Strange nodded. "How's Hamlet?"
Wade's blood boiled.
Vanessa washed half Maggie's hair under Strange's guidance. She'd helped Maggie in the bath, mostly the way a mother would make sure a child didn't drown on accident. But this was the first time they'd really gotten to wash her hair. Strange showed Vanessa how by cleaning the more damaged side, showing her how to keep it clean and mostly dry. It wasn't pretty. Vanessa tried not to show any reaction, but she hated seeing the line held shut by what looked like staples in Maggie's scalp...and the huge patch of Maggie's hair that was gone. Maggie'd always had such pretty, long hair. It looked so wrong for it to not be there.
"We'll be discussing that teacher too." Maggie could feel him turn. "Thank you, young lady."
Peter immediately agreed. He understood. She didn't want to use any of her powers. Normally they flew/swung to the tower. But she was saving her strength. He guessed so that she felt like she could fight if she had to. He didn't take it personally. Not at all. She had to do what she had to do to keep herself safe.
Flash grabbed Peter's shirt and looked like he was going to punch him.
"Okay." Maggie finished the long agonizing speech, then sighed. "That's a lot."
"Just want him to be better, you know?" Peter shrugged.
"We have a king, we can all fit on it. I just don't like how his neck's bent."
"What?" Vanessa asked.
"Sir is doing very well. They're setting his arm, currently. I am overseeing. If there are any updates, I'll share them." JARVIS responded.
"I've got a...different solution planned." Strange commented, standing up. "But... we're going to have to take the whole room."
Maggie bit her lip. "Okay." She understood protecting herself. Her dad would want her to protect herself. What disturbed her was how easy it had been to inflict pain so she could escape. Though...considering the situation, she'd hadn't had much time for moral dilemmas in the moment. She looked down at her watch. It ticked at a normal pace. Maybe her dad would be upset with her for how easy it had been. He'd been in lots of life-threatening situations in the force. People hated police, they'd tried to hurt or kill them any way they could.
"Hear me out, Tony. I don't like this situation any more than you do. Peter's on Stane's radar, that's bad. I think we all agree on that point. This isn't a debate about how much trouble we're in, we all know this situation isn't ideal." Steve said, his hands raised. "Peter's been through a shit ton. He should be able to keep his normalcy, especially since we don't know what Stane might do. Peter does have an element of surprise here, plus it isn't exactly feasible to snatch a kid from school, especially one with super powers. Plus, Peter's never really anywhere alone for long. School is only a couple more weeks. I bet that Stane will go for the plans first before trying to do anything to Peter. He might even just ASK Peter for help, people like Stane underestimate people like Peter."
"I'm going to win, so I get to choose. I would like to get Chinese. As much as you can get."
"I think we've left him Speechless."
It was just a vision though… He couldn’t hear her. And she understood. Strange was the best suited to find her and Peter. The bad guy had known that. The bad guy had planned.
"Yo, I'm talking to you. Trying to skip? Going to that fake ass internship or yours or going to see your pretend family?"
His heart leapt to his throat.
Maggie did. Dr. Strange hung up. "Wha-?" She sighed. Then a loop of golden light appeared and Strange stepped out.
"S'ven. Pin'y. Two more, 'aken." She jerked again, but Strange kept her in place. "'s on fire." Maggie's breath slowed. Her body stilled and relaxed deeper with sleep.
Peter:
"Yeah, kid, we are." Tony turned and kissed his temple. "We're going to be. We are literally a superfamily. We've got this."
"Hey, you wanna come visit the Tower?" Peter asked as he switched his shoes.
"Well, let's find a way to help you. Then we can go over any questions you have about the rest of it. Sound fair?"
"Let beauty come out of ashes."
"Oh, calculus."
"You have a big enough ego." Steve retorted.
"I didn't like it there. They were nice and I made friends but...it wasn't home. And I didn't feel like I fit fully. Besides, you seem to know more about...my kind of weird than they did. I know I'm not all mystical, but my powers, my mutation just meshes more with the mystical."
"Yeah. Sorry. Didn't realize I was that tired." She sighed and looked at the building. "But hey, it's not gonna collapse. Yay."
"Having a parent." Peter nodded. "You seem pretty chill with Dr. Strange though."
"What the fuck was that?"
"Sir, I've checked over a million times. No camera was functioning within a mile of that location for three hours. The car that took Peter could any one of thousands that passed through." JARVIS said.
He glanced at her, then her drink. "You're welcome. Saw you seemed to like them."
Maggie shrugged. "I'd rather not tonight. Thanks though. I'm going to...get some sleep. Is that okay?"
"Of course. It was explained to me." Thor nodded. "I do not understand the relevance."
"Thanks, Nat."
"Yeah." Peter nodded. He could do that. He could help Steve by getting him some food. And he'd get to come back and look after Tony after the ugly stuff was done. He could hear and sense far too much. "Need anything else?"
"That's got to be a lot to take in."
If you can spot the Cabin Pressure reference, you're my kind of person.
"Not yet. You'll be too dizzy. After you've rested a bit more. We'll work on that, I promise." He nodded. "I know you want to be on your feet and feel more like you, but we got to wait a little bit more, okay?"
"Dammit!" Stane snapped, tossing his helmet across the room.
(See the end of the chapter for
Maggie frowned. "What are you doing?"
"Mmhm."
"Now. It would make me feel better. Or are you going to make ME hobble over there to ask?"
"He has a different voice." Maggie said, her voice small.
Steve kissed Tony's temple. "I've been right where you are. It didn't bother you to look out for me and it doesn't bother me to look after you. Take the meds."
"Well, glad to know it's not you this time, Spiderman." Helen huffed. "Who's this?"
"He's just got a tough exterior. He doesn't normally open up for people. I didn't really get to know him for a few years, you know? He builds forts." Then Maggie burst into giggles. "Don't let him know I compared him to Graham."
"Hey...we're going to go get this figured out."
Maggie didn't respond.
"I'm well aware. Don't need a lecture from a kid."
"You heard it here, they're not friends, not enemies. Natalie Portman, you have some explaining to do. Anyone got a list of gymnasts going to the Olympics? And, most importantly, who won the dance off? No. Most importantly, is twerking a dance or not? Fight in the comments." The video ended.
Peter got into the elevator and headed up to the lab. On internship days Peter spent some time in the lower labs, but most of it in Tony's lab. They had to keep up appearances, after all. The SI employees knew about the contest, so it was expected that a teen show up to help every now and then. Peter'd even made a few friends. He didn't mind working in the lower labs. He preferred working with Tony, but since he was on bedrest, it really was for the better that Peter spend time in the lower labs, instead of being upstairs encouraging Tony to be on his feet when he should be resting. The doors opened up to one of the lower labs and Peter stepped in. "Hey, what're we doing...today?" Peter froze as his spidersense went off like crazy.
"Margaret?" Strange called out. There was no response. The apartment was empty. Good. He walked to her room and put the necklace down on her side table. He adjusted it twice, before he walked back into the living room and left through his portal.
"Mm-hm."
"That good, huh?" He laughed. "How about some lunch and we can work through some more Hamlet? I'll even quiz you."
Maggie opened her mouth, then closed it. "It's hard to explain. It's like a spotlight shines on people. Red means danger. And I can find the source of said danger with a different shade of red. It's kinda like a thread attaches between the two things. Like, if I was about to punch you, you and I'd both look red with a sort of rope tied between us. The colors are different slightly from victim to perp...and the level of danger too...I can see that."
"I sort of know her." Peter didn't know much about her at all. Except that apparently she'd been adopted by Deadpool and she spent her free time working in a food pantry giving food to the homeless. And Peter was pretty sure she had some sort of superpower, but he wasn't certain as to what it was. "But seriously, it's no big deal. We can do it in the summer performance. You and I worked really hard on this."
"Could have fooled me." Peter laughed and walked to the edge, jumping up onto the raised concrete that kept normal people from falling off. He looked down the side of Stark tower.
"I'm happy for you, bro." Ned said, patting him on the back.
"We're happy to help, what can I get you?"
Strange folded his arms over his chest.
The rest is a dumpster fire and by dumpster fire, I mean read the warnings.
"You look fine, kiddo. And you're going to do perfect. Remember, tonight, just an intern, okay?"
Peter laughed.
"Since joining my 'cult'? Yes."
"Don't wanna be alone."
"Oh, sorry, sir. This is Peter Parker. He won the competition for the internship program. He's a brilliant kid." Tracy grinned. "He helps out around here sometimes. Has a badge and everything." She pointed to the collar of Peter's shirt.
"I know, honey." Tony squeezed Steve's shoulder.
"I've got some cards for you. Should get you through the intro. Only vetted people got let in, questions should be pretty tame. This is yours though, you can leave at any time." Pepper said. "Oh, that won't do." She walked forward and pulled a thread from Steve's shirt and brushed dandruff from his shoulders. "Better."
"It's just... I... We..." Peter huffed.
Maggie nodded. "Mmhm." She sighed. "Anyway, wanted to say thanks. Even though you probably don't remember, I know you took a hit for me. I get all the stories now, about how much of a hero you are." She hopped down.
"I know...I've been through it too. Sometimes, I smell my mom's perfume and... It's okay, Peter. You're alright. I've got you."
"Well, we'd like to hear about this project."
"Why not?"
"You're not our boss, Stark." Clint teased over comms. "Captain tight-pants is our boss."
"Yeah. Have your suit?"
"I should have told you, I'm sorry, but I thought it was kinda weird...but also a bit necessary..." Strange started to ramble.
"I need some major help."
"It is. And that's why I miss it." It helped distract her from all the danger she could see. It never really went away, but some things helped her mind be a little less focused on it.
"My friend is in danger, this almost constant dull thrum of it. But I can't pin down the source. Normally I can follow the threads and find the danger. I can't find it. It's like the threat is invisible or...undefined. Then, last night, I had a nightmare and he...he was scared, but I couldn't see anything. I could tell he was in danger...but I couldn't SEE it. And it wasn't even bad danger...but he was really upset and I just want to help. There was nothing there for me to stop though."
"B-, bitches." Maggie grinned. "I aced my last finals, so yeah. It's over for me."
There was nothing working. Dr. Strange frowned. This thing didn't make sense. They couldn't hurt it. When he tried to use the time stone, but when he did, the beast froze, but still wasn't touchable. It made no sense. It was setting the whole city on fire, but was untouchable. It didn't appear stuck between dimensions like other beasts he'd fought, but somehow it was untouchable. How did that happen? What was this thing? It wasn't in any book. Nothing. He asked the others, no one else had seen anything like that. He just wanted this to be over.
"Yeah, this kind is a bit...extra." Maggie agreed. "Sorry, again. Just doing training is all."
"Papa still working on that thing with Zia Nat?" Peter asked, eating his snack.
Strange nodded. His mind racing. He'd never be able to unhear her screams. "That was..."
"Would you like to meet her?"
'Hell yes.' Vanessa answered before tossing the phone back to Wade. "We never let her live it down."
"Zia?" Ned asked.
"Incoming, sir." JARVIS warned.
"You're wrong, Peter! So wrong!"
"Let yourself be in the moment. If you believe it, they will too." She smiled. "You're going to be fine. I'll meet you out there. Just pretend it's you and me in a practice room. We practiced with the lighting during rehearsals, pretend it's rehearsal. You'll be fine."
"Invisible beasts somehow got into the city. I've popped them into the mirror dimension...but well... That appears to only be a temporary solution. Even that doesn't hold them long. Trying to figure out a legitimate one that doesn't involve casualties or...destroying the fabric of reality. Hard to do when they're invisible"
That she could do, right? She tried to make her fingers move. They didn't. She let out a whimper that hurt her raw throat.
There were literal pictures of his speech on his power cell. He'd literally been on the news. Peter rolled his eyes and collected his books so they wouldn't get soaked on the wet ground. God, his stubs hurt. He wondered if that part ever got better. It had been just over a year.
"Karen?" Steve asked.
"Mask has all the capabilities a phone would...and more, because I'll fully admit I'm extra." Tony said. "Don't want a kid running around without having some sort of safety net."
"Dr. Dad taking you?"
She saw so many futures though, when she closed her eyes. Fire and screaming.
"No, sir."
Happy nodded and focused intently on the road.
Peter barely managed to climb back down the building. But instantly he felt himself crushed against a warm chest in a hug. "I've got you."
(See the end of the chapter for
"She was taken...been missing for five days."
"If you ever want to try, there's some next to the cure for blindness."
"I'm not made of glass. Yeah, I've got weak spots. But I can joke around."
"Jus' this chap'er?"
"My 'alley' as you call it, is the Mystic Arts, a thing that you do not truly have access too." Dr. Strange led her to a seating area and offered her an armchair. He'd obviously been studying something, if the amount of books and used mugs were any indication.
"I know, kiddo. I'm sorry." Tony kissed his temple. "You're handling like a champ though."
"Not really. Managed to stop a few car accidents."
"Sorry..." She whispered. "I just..." Peter walked down the alleyway. Then his spidersense went off like crazy.
"Hey, bud." Steve wrapped his arms around him and picked him up. "I've got you."
"It's not pleasant, kid. But at least you don't look like topographical map of Utah." Wade commented lightly.
"I'll still be on Earth...this Earth, so there's that. And I'll come back... I just don't know when at this point. I gotta get my head balanced, new world order and all. That'll take time...just don't know how much. That's why I stalked you. I didn't want things to be weird when I left. I thought you hated me or something for... I dunno, n-not seeing it coming."
"Promise."
"But you already knew that, didn't you? You can't heal...can't withstand much. Itsy Bitsy knows that. And, frankly, he's a crafty little thing. Genius kid. Bright as all hell. I didn't want him to try to escape or end our fun prematurely. So... I'm going to make sure he knows his little friend is here. His poor little friend who can't heal or really even fight back against bigger, stronger people. Oh...that fun trick that you use to run away...the one where you turn back time? You've been locked in here for two hours...you can't go that far back, can you? Oooh, we were VERY careful to keep you unconscious for a good long while." He leaned forward. "You can't escape."
They danced together, fell apart and came back together. Three times they let go of each other's hands. Then the fourth time their hands parted. As Peter spun on his own, Maggie flicked her wrist, the top of her outfit folded down, revealing an all-black outfit and she collapsed on the ground, graceful and devastating.
Maggie ached everywhere. Her body was sore. She coughed and her ribs hurt. A strange man had kicked in her ribs when she tried not to scream. She leaned against the corner of the room and breathed heavily. She wanted to go home, to be with Wade and Ness and Dr. Strange. She hoped he was okay. Was he still fighting? Did he even know she'd been missing?
"Not a scratch. Just a bit tired...may have overdone it with that last one."
"Language." Tony said with a giggle. Steve elbowed him.
"Yes."
"Just shush." Nat huffed before hopping up onto the table. "Hey there, ребенок паук, no one's mad at you. I need you to breathe okay? Thor's just being a big idiot."
"Kamar-Taj." Maggie corrected.
"Cool." Maggie nodded. "Brooklyn's been quiet today. Thought I'd see if Queens needed help." She pulled her phone from her pocket.
Ned patted his shoulder. "Hey, you feeling alright?"
An explosion?
"No. Has to do with my internship. I'm...going to announce my project. I'm trying to figure out what I should wear."
"You're insane."
"Well, at least it's over."
"Skipping school and going to dance. Don't you have rules?"
"Thank you."
Strange shrugged. "Just a suggestion. I like Hamlet. And, as I said, it's easier when read aloud."
"That is something I can't tell you. But time is flexible. Which...explains a lot of the multiverse...trust me, I've been." He snorted and shook his head.
"Nope. I told her I wasn't feeling well."
"See what you started?" Wong glared at Strange.
Maggie turned red. "Stop that."
"Oh my God, make it stop."
"Sure." Peter hung up after a goodbye, then got up to change clothes.
She'll fit in fine. Loser Prime, I don't care. You're gonna look sus no matter what.
"It's just weird."
Her mind flashed again. This time to a place she didn’t recognize. But the window on the building was familiar. She mentally turned.
"You will never be alone, I promise."
The baddie actually looked confused for a moment. "Just shut up and put your hands up."
"He's not here." Maggie whispered.
Only problem...Nat was likely already there. And if Nat was there, so was Clint. And Thor...well, he could fly. Steve knew his odds of getting there before everyone turned on Tony was slim to none. But he had to try.
Tony nodded in agreement. "They probably aren't. That'd be too bold. I'd notice it."
"What?"
"Sorry." Happy nodded. "Wanna stop and get something to eat?"
"Well, Tony's a tough guy, I'm sure he'll wake up and be his usual snarky self." Nat gave him a warm smile.
Do you know your dad's number?
Steve snorted.
"You can try, but I'm not sure you're up to much fighting." He said. "Alright. Feel this?"
Strange raised his hands in surrender and watched. The food was eaten by the time the episode was over. Maggie didn't seem to notice when he shut it off. She was staring at the window. "Margaret?"
"None of that. You're not going anywhere." He pulled a needle from the case and put it in her neck with a painful prick and burning sensation.
Peter let go the instant he realized that his hands had found the small sliver of flesh between her gloves and sleeves. She, very obviously, didn't like to be touched, not skin-on-skin anyway. He tried to respect that. He hadn't meant to touch her skin. "Sorry."
"I'm surprised your school let you read it." Strange nodded. "Most don't assign it these days."
"I pack light." Maggie shrugged.
Maggie could see the slight smirk Wong shot toward her. "He lives for it." Maggie grinned, knowing Strange absolutely hated her and Wong's games.
Tony walked through a portal and the portal closed.
"Time isn't set in stone. Every choice causes a...uncountable number of possible futures. What you saw was a possibility, Margaret, not a solid truth."
"Hey, kid. What's up?"
Tony kissed his cheek gently.
Dun, dun, duuuuuunnnnn!
"See ya at dance."
'I've played video games against him. He cheats.'
"Nothing. Thought I heard something weird. Anyway, if he ever teaches you the portal thing, could you drop HIM for a while? It would be justified."
"It's okay, Margie. Get it out."
The lights in the coffee shop were dark. The place was empty, the walls torn open, getting renovated. Wade didn't even hesitate to break in. Sitting on the counter, in plain view, where Maggie would never forget it, was her phone. He could tell by the case. He'd teased her for wanting it, but got her the TARDIS case. He took a deep breath and turned the phone over. It rang in his hand. He grit his teeth and answered it. "Where is she?"
"Oh, as soon as evidence dropped against Obie, I had to be ready to snatch up what he stole from me. Thankfully, JARVIS never sleeps, unlike me."
"Yeah. Thanks. Normally, I could call Deadpool or Doctor Strange, but they're both out of town."
Maggie looked at her phone and laughed at a text she'd gotten. She rolled her eyes, sent back a single emoji, and then locked her phone. "You haven't seen Hannibal, obviously. You should look it up some time." She shrugged and swung her feet idly. "Was the food good?"
"Trust me, he isn't good. I know you don't like hurting people, but sometimes there's only one way to stop someon-"
The world was still crazy. To be fair though...the news was not being too difficult about HIM. They were on SI for the scandals. On Tony, questioning his playboy ways and if he'd always had a hidden son in his tower. Calling Steve an idiot or naïve for being with a liar.
"I don't know. It's my face. It usually has a look on it." She shrugged. "Okay, real question though."
The line clicked. There was the sound of utter chaos on the other side.
"Okay. I've got tracking on you at all times, so no worries. I'm not heading out of the city until you're clear anyway." Tony said.
"Okay. Want to rest, bud?"
"Five days..." Tony said, tears in his eyes.
Christine opened her mouth then closed it. "Is that...? Is that even possible?"
Dr. Strange took a deep slow breath. "Rest really is the best thing for her...but food is important. It'll raise her spirits to have real food, that's important too. Be gentle about waking her up. I'll get her something mild to eat."
"Nothing for today though?"
"Fair." Maggie nodded and went to the guest room and got Harry Potter. She sat at the bar as Strange filled the sink. "'Chapter Thirteen, Nicolas Flamel. Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again...'" She read while he worked. And at the end of the chapter (this time with fewer mistakes than usual) she took over the cleaning as Strange read.
"That good, huh?" Aaron laughed. "I've seen that look before on my own kids. Who pissed you off?"
"That's up for debate, but thanks for the positive judge of my character. No. I am helping because I know EXACTLY what this dance means. I know...at least part of your story, Peter. And I know it well because I have my own version."
"A little behind schedule." Peter frowned up at Quentin.
Grappling was not Peter's strong suit, but he fought with everything he had until Steve's hand got around his throat.
"Wherever you wanna go. I'm not feeling anything in particular."
Everything turned visible as Steve stepped around the corner with Clint and Nat.
Peter looked at Steve and his eyes narrowed slightly.
"No, thanks Peter." He kissed his temple. "See you in a bit. Actually...I'll have JARVIS tell you when he's in a normal room, okay?"
Her body jerked at once, jolted by something. She didn't open her eyes, but he could tell she'd woken up. Something had disturbed her. It couldn't have been a dream. Not that quickly. Her powers alerting her? The room was still empty. She started to relax. Her body almost seemed to find peace again.
"Sweet." Ned beamed. "And when you actually do get married, I best be your best boi. Not best man: best boi, specifically."
"Good." Steve smiled. "How about you get washed up? We'll have dinner in a little bit. I think Tony's finally got the bread where we need it."
Tony felt a hand land on his shoulder. He could tell it was Steve's.
"I think she saw his face. He was asking if she was responsive. If she remembered anything." Christine looked at her. "She saw whoever did this."
Steve nodded and went quiet, then glanced at Maggie. "Is she going to be okay?"
Ness moved to grab the blanket from the back of the sofa, but Strange already had it, his shaky hands unfolding it to wrap around her. Ness pulled it toward her to make sure Maggie's feet were covered too. She shared a small, knowing smile with Strange and loved when the man quickly looked away, embarrassed at being caught. Ness could see how close he was getting to Maggie. It had been changing for a while, but it seemed Strange too was starting to notice just how different it had become.
"Working on it." Karen said. "Connecting to JARVIS."
Maggie laughed then frowned.
Peter got into his car and closed the door. Immediately, he started to take off his prosthetics.
Peter found himself with his dad and papa in the elevator of the Tower.
"He's cheating!" Peter protested. "And then he uses his broken bones as protection against my wrath!"
Shit! Peter thought. He slowed down his workout. "Um, yeah. Dance has been great. It's always helped with the asthma. So it's been nice. Plus, Papa's been teaching me to fight, that's been exercise. Helps my lungs a lot." Peter said.
Vanessa found herself at the door and managed to keep her balance in her heels. She put her hand on the door. "Bye, Queen B."
Maggie nodded. She didn't think she'd be too afraid. Maybe a little. But if he was there, that would help her stay calmer.
Peter glared at him.
Peter's heart pounded, his chest felt tight.
Maggie opened her eyes and narrowed them on him. "Huh?"
Strange glowered at him. "You know what I mean. She really should be in school. That Wade Wilson lets her get away with far too much. She could make so much more progress with a little more structure, focus. Her symptoms would be manageable if she would just get her powers and mind in check, trained to work together."
Tony pointed to the holograph. "Pete and I finished this up the last few adjustments over the last week. Look at it. Isn't it gorgeous?"
"For what?" Wade asked.
All of this was being done by drones.
Maggie wanted to jolt away from the wall, ask him to uncuff her. But she pressed closer to the wall. Something wasn't right. This...wasn't right.
"Always." Tony added to Steve's words. "Now, let's go home and curl up somewhere and watch a movie, yeah?"
Maggie let out a quiet, breathy laugh. "I thin' I'll quit while 'm ahead."
"No." Steve answered.
"Cool." Nat said, dry sarcasm. Her phone rang. She picked it up. "Hey, Tony. How's Peter?"
-Soon, you'll know what it's like to be helpless. At the whims of someone else. Losing something you love might just help you understand how I felt. Talk to you soon.-
She's a kid. Clint realized. "Hey, hey, I'm not going to hurt you. Sh, sh." He promised, trying to sooth her. He let go of one of her arms to grab his cuffs. He wasn't going to hurt a kid, but this kid had powers unknown. And had managed to get away from him and Nat. They needed one less unknown on the field, especially with Iron Man on the loose.
"It's Peter! Our kid is in a thin, very thin layer of fabric standing on the edge of a building."
Peter sighed. He considered reaching out and patting her arm, but she was asleep. She liked to choose who could touch her, she couldn't do that while she was asleep. Instead he gave her a smile, even if she couldn't see it. "Tell her to call when she's up to it, okay?"
Wade let out a slow breath. "She's a kid."
"Why? I can' 'member."
"Rather not focus on that... She should be fine. I've fixed much worse."
"I'm just saying. She's a cutie and you're a cutie and you know. Dating wouldn't exactly be a bad thing for you, kid."
After practice, Peter went to go patrolling, but when he put on the mask, Karen greeted him.
Peter nodded, then jolted when he heard a scream.
"Jesus, kid. I'll get ahold of your parents. I'll be there soon. You go somewhere safe with Ned."
"I know a doctor who could help with that, no questions asked." Peter said.
"Is he gonna be okay, boss?" Happy asked, his voice concerned.
Maggie fidgeted as she put her retainers in the bag and bit her lip. She wanted to pace, but when she walked the stitches all over pulled at her movements. She tried to move as little as possible to avoid the discomfort. She needed something to do to distract her. Something. She picked up her phone and dialed her friend. It shifted to video chat. Immediately.
Take care.
"Thanks. But at least I'm not a radioactive freak."
"We're being followed." Peter commented.
"Multiversal and time-y whime-y interdimensional location services." Strange corrected.
"You and me both." Peter agreed.
Peter bobbed his head. He got an odd sense of dejavu when he webbed himself to both arms of the suit and flung himself upward, kicking the suit in the chest. It was just like the fight he'd had with Iron Man...what felt like ages ago. Except, there was no hero in this suit. This wasn't a good guy. This was properly a villain. Peter was properly in danger.
Good golly it's been a long time for this one. I'm sorry. I wish I could explain, but I really can't.
I'm still haven't become a doctor between the last few chapters. I did a bit of research. It's probably not all accurate, but hey, I tried. Okay? Let's all pretend.
Peter swung home with a smile. "Fri, can you let me in?" The window opened. Peter climbed in and ducked inside. "Brr, it's cold. Thanks, Fri."
"A friend who happens to be a girl." Happy nudged him with an elbow.
"Maggie, could use some help! Maybe DO come up here." Peter said as his body went through the side of the building. Everything hurt.
Neither Tony or Steve, who watched the whole video, made it to a garbage can or sink or bucket.
"Like this." Peter corrected, moving his papa's arms. "There."
The instant everything was finalized, Peter felt himself embraced by both of his parents. He hugged them back. "Glad you guys caught up with me."
"You found him." Strange called from the top of the stairs.
"Warm hands...soft hands. Ness's hands." Maggie muttered and relaxed a little, eyelids drooping a little. "No drones?"
"Jumping's part of the plan, Dad." Peter laughed.
"A little on that last one."
Maggie shook her head. "You, please."
"The others need a bit longer, unfortunately." Strange said. "This won't hurt, you'll only feel some tugging at most."
"Technically JARVIS did most of the work." Tony teased back. "I figure if push comes to shove we can blame him."
Steve rolled his eyes but yanked the smaller man against him and kissed him breathless.
"Not yet." She pushed off the door frame and pointed to a booth.
Peter nodded. "I'm glad she's okay."
"He's good though, right? Real good in the sack? Because the man's broken my bones. And if I gotta deal with broken bones, someone had better be getting boned real good."
"What is that?"
"Rest, kiddo."
He could tell by the way her face pinched that her throat hurt. "Want something for your throat?"
Vanessa looked up and felt her head tilting to the side. "You own sweatpants?"
"Yup." Maggie saluted him. "Stay safe."
"Keep us informed." Nat said. "About both of them. Clint likes the kid who stabbed him."
"You are blushing, can confirm." Steve nodded. "So, how was Maggie? She doing okay?"
Maggie, Reset, sat down on the AC unit. She looked down. "I have this ability. I have a danger sense, which wouldn't be useful on its own. But," she held up her hand, showing her watch. "I can...control time. Not much, I mean, not like Dr. Str-anyway. I can slow it down, speed it up. Even reset things. Most people don't notice. Their minds aren't quick enough, perceptive enough, smart enough, whatever it is... You noticed though. You had deja vu, I'm guessing?"
Steve snorted and shook his head. "I'd probably hurt your ribs. You boys get some rest, I'm here to look after you."
Maggie tried to pull on her powers. Tried to go back in time. She couldn't grasp it. She didn't even know which way was up. How was she supposed to use her powers if she could barely make her mind function?
"I'm aware."
"All done, no more needles to worry about for you." She promised. "We're going to get you going on these, then I'll come back and get a brace on you once you're not feeling too bad, okay?"
"Yes."
"Ignore it, Karen. I've almost got this wrapped up. I'll be home soon."
Maggie didn't answer, not unless a whimper counted.
"Yeah." Peter said, bouncing toward her, obviously done with his part. "Working on a special order. The guy's super tall and there was an overheating problem in the joint causing wear and tear. Our first fix took up too much power, so we're trying to re-work it."
"Right, you first." Helen said, walking up to Tony.
Steve asked. "Then why don't you step away from the edge of the building?"
He helped her stand and walk to the sink. She looked dizzy, but he left her to wash up and brush her teeth in private. He went to the living room and shut down all the lights, even unplugging the TV, so the small pinprick of light in the bottom corner wasn't on. The Cloak of Levitation floated around...looking concerned as it could. "She doesn't feel well."
Maggie seemed to think that over. "Sorry...been a rough week. I'm a little..."
At that Clint's eyes flashed with a little anger. "Yeah, that makes two of us. Where is he?"
"I'm fine. Some bruises...maybe fractured ribs."
"Yeah, right. It's on, Wong. See ya!" Maggie grabbed her bag and headed off to dance.
Maggie coughed. Maybe she did need a full mask like Mr. Stark had offered. The smoke was thick, choking her, maybe a full mask could filter some of it out, she wouldn't put it past Stark to be able to make something like that. She didn't need to ask if anyone was there. She knew two people were still in the building, she could see the danger lights around them, even through the flame. She just had to get up to them.
"I can speed people up and myself. I can get people out. You keep the street clear." Maggie protested.
"Hey, easy. Don't worry. It was probably a vision...just time floating in and out." Strange soothed as Vanessa wiped her tears. "You're going to be confused, it's okay, breathe. What was the question? That'll help us understand your answer."
"I'll try." Peter flushed lightly.
Dr. Cho walked away.
Peter couldn't stand watching needles get dropped in his own skin, let alone someone else's. Dr. Strange taped them down easily. "All done, Margaret. Model patient...though I'm used to unconscious ones, so you were a bit louder than most of my usual patients."
"I'm not sure I can pull off authoritarian. I just...no. Once I do that the knives come out, or claws or...I turn into Hugh Jackman or something. All claws." Wade said. "That's only for bad guys, not you, pipsqueak."
Stane traced the circular hole in the chestplate that Tony'd made. Stane had seen it, of course, when Tony'd first come home, the blue glow in his chest. Stane'd made the intuitive leap. The thing their suit was missing was the very thing Tony had implanted in his chest. The only problem was, Stane couldn't miniaturize the arc reactor, no matter how much time he spent or how many people he threw at the problem...he couldn't mimic Tony's work. But his suit was functional now. Though...to be fair, he did want the arc reactor. Taking it from Tony's chest wasn't an easy option. Tony kept his lab locked down. When he went out he was almost always with Steve Rogers or one of the other Avenging idiots.
Nat! Peter could stop this. He could fix this if he got to her. He could talk sense into Zia Nat. He had to.
"Mm-hm. Subtle. Don't just try to turn me. It's push and pull, not...I don't know 'yank and hope for the best'."
"No. He told me he was going to though. I suggested Friday and he said he'd do that and My Girl, Tarzan Music, and Guns N Roses. Though, I got to say, all but Friday are masterpieces, so you shouldn't be suffering too bad."
When he walked her out that night and watched her get into the taxi with Wade and Vanessa, he waved then paused. Something wet fell on his cheek. He looked up and more rain fell. When he looked back down, Maggie was looking out through the window, pointing at the droplets on it with an 'I told you so' look.
"Resting. What happened? You look pale."
Peter hid his hand under his cover. "It's not on you..." He promised.
Maggie nodded, her lip quivering.
"Um, in private." Vanessa tripped as she suddenly found herself in a different room. "Good lord, give a girl some warning before you woosh her away. I'm wearing heels for fuck's sake."
Maggie turned her head toward him, slowly, cautiously. Then pointed at Tony. "Asked me."
"There you are. I've been looking for you." Strange stepped into the room and looked from her, to her empty plate, and the dishes she'd stacked neatly in the sink. "You could have used my kitchen, that's what it's there for."
"Oh my God, you're the best."
"No, she guessed it." Peter defended her.
"I'm stronger."
"Accidents happen. It's okay." Her body was still glowing red, probably because the heat was still burning her skin. A cool cloth did sound nice. Maybe the shop sold merch. She could change her shirt in the bathroom. She started inside. The man held the door open. She headed for the counter.
"Let's get you upstairs, kid." Happy smiled, ruffling his hair once more. "So, who's your girlfriend and why haven't you told me about her?"
"I know, kid. It's okay. We're all going to be okay. I know things were messed up yesterday, but let's try to start over, yeah?" Tony offered.
The reporter's breath shook, but she slowly opened the box. She jumped back from the desk with a screech.
"Hey! I do that...sorta. I'm self-taught." Peter laughed happily. "Maybe we can do a trade. You teach me quickstep and I can help you with aerial."
"Excuse you!" Maggie elbowed him and rolled her eyes. "Ease off. Ness, can you call him off or something?"
"I can't know. I'm not a mind reader." Strange frowned. "Haven't finished that book yet, and don't want to test it without...well, knowing what I'm doing. Getting in someone's head is a risky business. But, well, you've met Xavier. Without training...there's complications. You could scramble someone's brains just trying to listen. Not going to risk it."
"You should see my version of Umbrella." Peter said with a chef's kiss.
Old phone who dis n00b?
"Wow," Maggie whispered, looking around the penthouse.
"Oh, just call me Vanessa or Nes, kiddo." She waved him off. "Thanks for helping her out. We all owe you guys one."
"You have NO idea." Peter led her into the building. Once in the elevator he sighed. "JARVIS, medbay, please."
Christine stepped around the bed and pulled Strange into a hug.
"Fair enough." Steve agreed.
Take care.
"Are you suggesting fondue?"
"Why didn't she fight or run away? She was fast, she could have gotten away, right?" Nat asked then frowned. "We can't know though...I mean she wasn't taken from here...they got her somewhere else."
"Margaret you need to-"
"Hey, Penis."
Maggie thought about it for a moment. "Okay."
On her right, Dr. Strange had his head against the bed next to her side. He was sound asleep, his hand in hers. Peter notice that Strange had put gloves on his own hands, since Maggie's hands were bare. Peter was pretty sure Maggie wasn't the only one who felt they were more than mentor-mentee. He smiled and then turned his head.
"Bank on Atlantic, right?" Peter asked. It was Brooklyn. But Spiderman wasn't just for Queens. He was on his way home from patrol, he could stand to go a little off course.
"Yeah."
"Bryan Adams, classic. Maybe you aren't so bad at this music thing." Strange said.
"This place is empty." Tony said, sticking close to Steve. "I can't hear anyone, can you?"
"If you take a kid and you're going to torture him...you need a place where he won't be heard or seen. He wouldn't have time to go very far. The recording...and..." Steve nodded to where Peter's pinky was. "Was given by hand. They're close. So where CAN'T we see that would be isolated enough for their purposes?"
Maggie's breath shook. She wasn't going to last much longer. Physically she wasn't good enough to fight both of them at once. She was sure her powers were the only thing keeping her alive or not in cuffs at this point. Clint let go of his bowstring. She heard it snap against his bracer.
"See you at dance?" Peter asked.
"Peter, this is likely a mutant with unknown powers. I'm sure I advise speaking with her alone. Would you like me to call for help?"
"Well, you have a dead child on your hands." Strange nodded when the man looked stricken. "Can take as little as thirty minutes, which is shorter that what that teacher made my daughter wait while she was crying in pain. Now, let me tell you about my daughter."
"I'm gonna learn how to handle all the weird." Maggie insisted, brushing herself off and standing. And she would, he knew it. She was already dealing with normal human threats and mutant threats. Someday she'd be good enough to deal with the mystical as well. He'd make sure she was ready for it.
Vanessa followed him through the portal.
"I know the feeling." Peter sighed.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Hey, Maggie." Wade said as Vanessa kissed her forehead. "Let me guess, 'I should see the other guy'?"
"Language." Steve said before he and Peter began to hum in time to the music.
That was the first time she'd heard her dad's voice in years. It was wonderful. It was awful.
"Damn."
"You're guessing correctly. I'll meet you downstairs, with something to drink."
"Time to die, little insect."
"Dr. Cho, you are wasted on the Avengers, brilliant mind like yours." Strange responded.
"Everyone is suddenly very interested in being my dance partner and my friend and my lab partner and...it feels so false. Like everyone's lying to me all the time." Peter shrugged. "It's a nightmare. It's almost like Beck. I never know what's real. I don't know if the person who helped pick up my bag on the train did it to be nice of if they just knew my face. It's really weird." He was putting in enough energy trying to get through school with all the fake and/or jealous people. Going to dance was just too much.
"Yes." Dr. Strange said, then he sighed and looked down at his hands. He sat in the chair opposite of her. "I'm not exactly good with expression."
Maggie laughed. "They are pretty nice. I'm not the only one who wears gloves all the time. A girl name Rouge at school wore them non-stop. She could kill people with a touch though...so, yeah. Not my best example." Maggie frowned.
"It's no more danger than I'd normally be in. Plus, if you add in combat to the energy equation, my prototype wouldn't be enough. Even if he tries the plans I put on file... it wouldn't be enough if he wanted to sustain combat and backup systems safely." Peter said. "He may just try to make something based off of my idea. He may not even need me. And he is an asshole, he might just ask and expect me to do whatever he wants, same as how he treats and uses everyone else."
"Yeah?" Ned asked, confused.
"Just...don't invite your dad. There's enough chaotic energy in here." Tony said gesturing around the room.
"It's like the TARDIS in here. How do you not get lost? It's a labyrinth and...bigger on the inside."
"Yeah." She answered.
"Yeah, he did." Strange said, stopping at his door. "We agree that 11 grew on us, right?"
Maggie almost felt her heart drop, but then she saw him shakily pulling a pan from the oven. She had a thing against store bought pot pies. She'd had one too many of them. But she wasn't sure Strange knew how to use the microwave that he had, which was kind of amazing. She really had missed home-cooked food. She was pretty sure she'd gained a few pounds since starting to come over more on the weekends. Real food was a lot more tempting than processed stuff. "Thanks."
Tony giggled. "Heard it? JARVIS has it in a lovely folder for me to watch whenever I want."
He looked down at the wooden floors. "Something wrong with them?"
"Christine?!"
"I don't forget."
"It's okay. It's not personal or anything. I know you won't hurt me and I know you're not...you know..."
"Honestly, one kid's enough, but now there's two. 'Cape-y,' I swear."
Faintly a muffled, metallic voice came back through the mask. "Peachy. Look after Underoos, won't you? He's being an idiot."
"No. They're bullying my kid. I don't like bullies."
"We're going to make it all better, okay?" Vanessa's voice didn't sound all that comforting. "Strange?!"
"Yeah 'wow.' The environmental impact alone would be nothing to shake a stick at. And the economic one... This could give lights to people who've never had them. Warmth to low-income housing and schools. Not to mention shelters across the world that need the lights on. Peter and I've discussed it. Once Obie...isn't in the way. We're giving away the first set off the production line. He's making sure every shelter in this city is sustainable for the year."
"Oh, well they smell nice."
Peter screamed. Her body deformed, blood surged through her torn clothes. Her head began to bleed. Her lips dripped with red.
"I'll continue to be a useless bump on a log."
"Sounds like me." He nodded.
Ned sat up straight. "What's up? Does it have to do with...you know?"
"Sorry, kid."
"Yeah." Maggie shifted, doing the same slow, grand move that she'd failed during her audition. Her body shook. In an instant, Peter's hands were on her ribs, his fingers sprawled on her back.
"Yes, Peter." Without another word, Peter got down to the first floor and walked out the front doors. Anger fueling his steps. He'd just been trying to help, to keep his dad healthy, to keep him out of trouble with Steve and Cho. And Tony'd snapped at him. He'd IGNORED their signal, the one sacred thing they'd created to keep Peter from getting too stressed. It hurt. What the fuck was up with his dad?
"So, what are you doing for Christmas?"
"Hm?" Maggie asked.
"Who are you?" Strange asked, gently setting Peter down in the available bed, standing between him and Christine. He knew Vanessa. But this woman was an unknown.
Tears ran down her face.
"You're an adult cuddling with another human being."
"Don't worry about it." She said softly, waving her hand. "I just want a nap. You good to take over?"
"Everything go alright today?" Vanessa asked from the sofa.
Tony sighed. "I don't like it either. I honestly want Peter to punch the kid too, but we can't do that." Tony frowned. "I think Peter shouldn't let that kid push him around, but...I don't see Peter changing that. And I don't see the school changing it when they haven't this long. We can't fight that without letting people know who Peter is."
Peter's eyes widened. He'd always thought there'd been some trauma in her life, likely some of a sexual nature too...but now he had proof. "I'm sorry. You're safe though."
The man looked down at the screen and his eyes widened. "This is...impressive. How? What even? How did he make this work?"
Maggie blushed and stood up. "Thanks." Then her head whirled.
Everything that they were doing was focused on the monster. But the monster didn’t exist. You couldn’t portal something that wasn’t there. Couldn’t speed it up or slow it down. Couldn’t cut it. Couldn’t whoosh it away.
She tried to focus, calm her mind. Nothing was coming up. No images, no feelings, no vibes. Just her and her thoughts. She knew nothing was going to come up today, she already had that feeling, but she'd try anyway.
"Margaret." He knelt in front of her and gently put a hand on her knee.
"Scared, why? They're medical professionals, let them do their jobs, Margaret. That's what they're here for."
"Sounds good to me." Peter grinned. "Can we have dinner too?"
Maggie snorted, then shook her head. "Can't say I do. I won't either. That shit requires good grades and someone who doesn't space out." She sat back down in her chair. "It's more than just Stane pulling strings. If only I could get a face. Sometimes I really feel useless. What good's this danger sense if my brain can't focus long enough to pinpoint the source, even with a 1 up mushroom?"
Thanks... Assholes.
Strange didn't like that. Not at all. "Stay back...she needs some space," Strange said. "Did you find Peter?"
"Can all of the come out now? I miss dance."
Steve couldn't close his eyes. He could only sit there and watch over his son. Steve couldn't think of anything that would convince him to leave Peter's side.
He smiled and pulled away from Steve, then turned to Tony, who looked a bit green. "Dad, you okay?"
Not-Wade was pissed.
"I'll let you know when I'm back. No one else will come close, okay?"
Warnings: death threats, kidnapping, non-con drug use. Nothing is awesome. Just trust me.
Her eyes snapped open. He was still right across from her, seated just like her. "Don't lie. You were giving me a lecture, about balance."
"Look at him go." Steve beamed proudly.
“Nothing at all,” Fury says, and he sounds – angry, for some reason. “I did the exact same thing you did, but got nothing.”
"High praise indeed. But that's not why you're here."
Tony, alive, rubbing his chest and grumbling,
“As a favour?”
“And how are we today, Mr Stark?”
Tony hears the words, it takes a while to understand their meaning. “I like…” he starts, confused. “I like – whatever you like,” he answers.
He listens to Ty talk, explaining financial projections and software compatibility and stuff that, in general, Tony already either knows or doesn’t matter, answering Fury’s questions. It’s hard to focus, he won’t deny. He thinks Steve’s eyes might be on him, but he ignores them. He’s not in the mood, and they haven’t even fucked since he accidentally punched him in bed, the bruise hastily concealed for this meeting.
"I'll try not to crash this time."
“It’s just – it’s just you don’t sound so enthusiastic.”
“You like working from home,” Steve says with a huff. “So would I if I lived in a house like yours.”
“To your long life,” Tony agrees, and decides he probably likes Pierce. He pushes, but know when to back off, and his scent is familiar, calm. He has no reason not to trust him, which as good a reason as any.
“I’m not attacking you,” Steve says, sounding strange. Gentle – that’s why, he sounds gentle. “I’m not accusing you of anything. I’m grateful. But I don’t want you hurt, not on my account, alright?”
“There’s a difference,” Tony tells him, and – if he hadn’t been aware of it – he wouldn’t have even noticed how willingly he responded to Fury’s question, easily, his brain
He chews his thumb. He’s twitching his leg, but he’s not aware of it until Steve asks him to stop. “Huh?”
“He won’t die, you know that, don’t you? Don’t listen to whatever that ass was saying, he’s just trying to cover his back. This happened on his watch, there’s no way he’ll get Secretary of State with this under his belt, not if Pierce has anything to do with it.”
“You die,” Tony says simply. “You die, and you join me.”
“It’s urgent,” Steve agrees. “Earth’s defence is our top-priority. If we start today – the more time we have, I reckon. Suit of armor around the world.”
“Finish the thought.”
Tony doesn’t even think he could make it up stairs like this. So he settles on the couch, blanket wrapped over his shoulders. He didn’t know it was possible to sleep this much, but it comes easy, and then he rests.
good. No doubt, SHIELD will get to see everyone’s little secrets, because no one reads the fine print. Ty gets the money, SHIELD gets – world domination, probably. Tony gets an irritating problem off his back, and enough to time to dig through Ty’s private computer and delete any copies he has of incriminating footage.
“Since the start. He was always very… touchy feely. After I went off my meds – when I got difficult. He got a bit more bold. I’m just saying, if it’s okay, I’d like to get a new one.”
“Hey,” Tony says, poking him slightly with his elbow. “I’ve been meaning to ask – no pressure, but what’s your number one fantasy, huh? Involving me, of course. And others! If that’s your thing,” he adds.
"Tell me about it." Steve mutters. "Those bandages are going to need changing."
“I don’t know. Sounds like he’s got something interesting.”
“When the scars heal over it’s beautiful,” she says, proudly “I’ve never managed to work on such a large scale before, humans usually die from the blood loss. But you? You’re a clean canvas.” She giggles, nudges him with her elbow as it they’re sharing a joke.
Pierce smiles. He lightly thumbs at a spot on Tony’s cheek, and then leans forward, conspiratorial. “And what about Fury?” He asks, cupping the back of Tony’s neck.
“Get off me,” Tony wheezes, “I’m going to fucking kill you.”
“I had some – informal dealings,” Tony relents, finally. “After my first, Mr Cain.”
Sarah looks pleased. “I guess you’ll have to check with Steve. I can call — “
They eat on the bed like teenagers at a sleepover. Not that Tony ever had any sleepovers. Or at least, any sleepovers that didn’t involve him getting fucked in return for material gain. They bitch about the vice-president and agree that he’s just waiting for one more scandal to seize the reigns, and they laugh about General Ross and pray that he’s one more heart attack away from dropping dead. “I don’t like Rumlow,” Tony says, poaching a fry, snapping it in half with his teeth.
Tony has one piece, lets it sit on his tongue, hides the rest carefully up his sleeve.
"Or," he says conversationally as he forces his length down Tony's throat "I could have you plugged. Plugged, and set to vibrate. What else do you love? God, those panties we saw last week. You'd be wearing them. Naked, apart from the plug and underwear, and I'd make you work like that. Answer calls like that. Imagine trying to keep a straight voice when someone's down the line. Imagine what I would do to you if you came without my permission."
“Then what?”
They’re united, and focused on a common goal, a common enemy. Steve and Tony hold what can only be called a healthy relationship.
Steve pushes the bridge between his thumb and finger against Tony’s throat, flattening his head against the locker, forcing him to submit. “Do you ever think,” Steve says quietly, voice light, “that life might be easier if you just do what you’re told?”
“Frowned upon,” Tony agrees, “but I’ve always been eccentric.”
He cracks open his eyes again, blinks into the blurry light. There is a fire, in a grate, and a blurry brown wooden mantlepiece surrounding it. An indistinct figure sits by his head, sits on the bed next to him, and Tony realises that it might not be Pepper.
“Also youngest
Tony licks his lips. “They’re tight,” he says, “they don’t hide anything.”
“I’m not cold,” he slurs, lying.
“I – you get what I mean, Tony.”
“My number one? Uh,” Tony feels him shake his head, exhale. “God, I don’t know, Tony. That’s a lot of pressure.”
“Could you — could you do me a favour?”
“You know, what you can do,” Pepper finishes. “I love him. God knows, I loved him. And he gave me Morgan, and – we were so happy,” she laughs, softly. “He chose me, this time. Because you both made choices. But maybe, in some other time – maybe, with different choices, it would go some different way.”
Steve jumps, flips forward, rolls on automatic, braced for an attack and that’s when he sees Gus’ body, lying on the ground, limbs splayed and faced down. He lifts his head, blinks hard, squints.
Tony smiles, tight. “Sure,” he says, “you’re alpha.”
They fall silent again. Steve wonders if Tony’s hands are cold, without gloves.
Okay, so the next one will definitely take longer I swear.
“Yeah,” he agrees. Packs away the memories, shuts the case.
“Alphas and omega. Some kind of medical testing facility. It was going well, fairly routine – anyway, one of the techs slipped some of the drug they were testing into the air supply. Next thing you know, every alpha on our team goes down.”
The familiarity she exudes now isn’t friendship, it’s politeness. There is nothing tying her to this team, nothing tying her to this building. Steve suspects that after this morning, they might never see each other again.
“I’m glad you agree. You’ll be a walking piece of art when I’m done with you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You want me to knot your ass? Come inside you like that?” Steve’s voice is hard, panting. Briefly, bizarrely, Tony thinks – that must be psychosomatic, right? There’s no way he’s out of breath.
Your father was is a very kind man. Which you don’t see. Which you will probably never see. He built weapons because he thought, at his very core, that he would be helping people. At the time, Tony, that was what life taught him. Maybe life will teach you something different. Your father saw war, and he acted accordingly. You fight a war with soldiers and those soldiers need weapons.
“You’re good with them,” a man says, approvingly. “All that choice, hmm? It’s just stopped you from doing what you love.”
he tells himself, rubbing the palms of his hands into his eyes,
“We’ll – live together?”
“Yeah you do.” Steve sighs. “Of course you do.” He pauses. “Was it – was it something we said? I didn’t mean – ”
“If you live, if you n’ Ant live, can you take my body back home?”
"Try not to."
“Not every friend has his ear the way you do. Pillow talk can be very persuasive.”
“You’re drooling,” he says, softly. He lifts the hand that had been balancing Tony’s thigh, drags his index finger through a line of saliva on his chin. He expects him to clear it off, but instead, he just smears it against his cheek.
“Sure.”
Tony ducks his head. "Sorry." He murmurs.
“It’s a good look for you.”
for this. You were
That you are. That you... are. That you are. Are you that? The words don't make sense. That. You. Are. Is he what? He doesn't even feel himself listing to the side until he hears Natasha curse.
“The Captain can be – old fashioned.”
He truly can’t recall how they got where they are now, wherever this place is. Dark, and musty. Smells like old leaves and leather. The bed is a cot, the mattress is thin. He smells: coffee, stew. Hears water boiling.
“Yeah, and what kind of life is that? If you’re going to just lock him up you might as well let him end it.”
“But Tony -” Steve began, just as Bruce walked into the room.
“Come on, I'll give you a hand,” the engineer says magnanimously. “How hard can it be? Not like I can sprain my wrist and my hip in one day, right?”
“Hurt me?” Tony snorts. “Steve, your ridiculously huge American super soldier dick -”
“No, not really,” Tony tries to reassure him, then hisses as Steve suddenly pulls out. “Ow, okay, now you hurt me!”
Steve blinked at him, suddenly hesitant. “I... I mean... It's... wrong?”
“I... I was gonna... I want to last longer,” Steve mutters, and trembles again.
Tony blushes. “Oh God, I'm sorry. Maybe this isn't the time to try my first ever blowjob.”
Then, finally, Steve moves in and begins pushing. And where Steve's super soldier American ass absolutely refused to be defiled by Tony, Tony's ass doesn't have much of a fight to put up against Steve's super soldier American dick.
“No, this should be more than just pretty good,” Steve gasps, and slowly pulls out of Tony. “I think you need to be on your back.”
“Well, maybe just a movie? Or, uh, a dirty picture or something?” Steve asks, rubbing at the back of his neck nervously. “I mean, just for a basic idea of what goes where.”
It takes a little more shuffling, but finally, Steve is back between Tony's legs, Tony is crunching as hard as he can to tilt his hips up for Steve, and then Steve pushes back inside him. Steve keeps his weight off Tony, leaning on one hand so he can use the other to grab Tony's dick and pull. It's a little dry but Tony moans with pleasure anyway.
Steve does.
Tony was still gaping at Steve. Steve, who was apparently sexually frustrated by the sight of him pants-less. Steve was just realising what he'd admitted, and was beginning to flush a magnificent brick red.
Tony is rubbered up and Steve is on his hands and knees – Tony wanted him to be on his back but Steve insists this will be easier. He'd had a medical exam just like this once, he explains. Tony isn't quite level with Steve where it really counts, though, so he grabs a pillow to kneel on. Then he gets the lube open.
Actually, it turns out he can. Tony groans. This is going to be so awkward!
Tony grinned. “What, not feel sexually frustrated?”
Steve holds impossibly still, the only movement he makes little tremors that Tony can feel in the steely abdomen pressed against his ass and back.
“Yeah, sorry, Thor,” Tony said, then put his mug down and flat-out ran after Steve. “Steve! Wait up, Steve!”
Tony tries not to laugh. “Super soldier strength? Don't worry about it, Cap, I've got more. Here, let me.”
“Fine, Steve-Tony, but your erection is weirdly big and apparently able to recur like, four times an hour. If it's going to feel like that every time, I might need local anaesthetics. Just saying.”
. What about you, you were in the army! Gay sex should be in your basic training!”
And with a shove, Steve is all the way inside him and Tony can't help but whimper a little. Wow, that's a lot of cock. A huge, pulsating, thrumming amount of cock that is making it impossible for Tony to even think, let alone speak. So he whimpers into the pillow.
The lube runs in little streaks down Steve's thighs, but finally, Tony is slick and ready to go, and he grabs his dick to hold it steady, and he pushes. Nothing happens, so he pushes again. His dick doesn't go anywhere. With a frown, Tony puts his back into it and shoves, but his dick only slips and skids between the perfect, American globes of Steve's ass until he's poking Steve in the balls with it.
“You wanna get naked?” Tony asks cheerfully, hopping around on one leg to get his shoe off.
“Hey, it happens,” Tony reassures him, a little hoarsely. “But, uh. I guess it's gonna have to be my dick in your ass, now. I mean, since you're... out for the count.”
If Tony Stark has a quantifiable sexual orientation, it could probably best be summarized as “voraciously heterosexual”. His exploits are legendary. He's fucked so many women he's lost count, especially because that whole two-at-a-time thing makes numbers a little hard. He's fucked every type of woman, in every conceivable position, and in every type of environment imaginable. He's tried toys, BDSM (not his cup of tea; he likes a little spanking but the degradation and pain is just a no-go), threesomes, orgies, quick and dirty, in front of people... Yeah. There's not much Tony Stark hasn't tried at least once.
“No, no,” Tony said, shaking his head vigorously. “You don't get to take that back. When you say frustrated, you mean sexually, right? Over me?”
"You're fine, Tony. I just want you to tell me: blindfold or no?"
“No,” Tony says, honestly. “Shut the door on your way in. Jarvis won’t lock me out.”
Nick is still at the table. His makeshift cot is empty. Maybe, it’s not just Tony that has to deal with insomnia.
“Steve.”
“And you?”
“Is it?”
“It’s not about God. Someone, just. Someone say something.”
Tony shivers. He doesn’t say anything, just lets it happen.
“Alright,” Fury pushes, “and, in your expert opinion, how could someone use this? What could they gain from using this on someone? On you, for instance?”
“Yeah. And I’m… working hard. There’s a lot to plan for.”
Tony doesn’t answer. He stands there, flat against the door, hand on the lock, breathing.
He hears, we’ve had him beat them. He hears, he knows how it works. We’ve used him a few times at other parties.
With Bucky’s ashes crumbled through his fingers, an old gun the only proof he ever existed at all, Steve wonders, what did it cost? That fight, Siberia, the shield through his chest. What did it matter, those petty things they did, when the world has turned to dust?
He hurts so bad, he wants to curl up and die.
His face looks bare without it. He looks – smaller, maybe. He already looks younger, after extremis, but this – he looks different. He brushes hair off of his shoulders, brushes round the back of his neck sparingly; his nape tingles, his fingers scratching at his scalp.
i know tony's an unreliable narrator. please keep that in mind -- he doesn't always interpret things the way they actually are, for lots of reasons. anyway, want to hear how you think their relationship is shaping up, specifically how steve feels about tony compared to how tony feels about steve. this stuff is practice for me idk i just really want to know if the things i'm trying to get across are........ coming across
“Happy?” Tony croaks, shutting his eyes as Steve pulls out, softened. His ass feels loose, wet, sloppy. He makes an effort to clench, hold in Steve’s spend as best he can – he can’t stop thinking about the damn cleaning crew who are going to have to clean up their fluids.
Steve holds up his hands. “I don’t know, Tony, that’s high praise coming from you. I mean,
"It really is. What shall we do next time?"
“Strange traded you for the stone, she said.”
“Thanks. I didn’t do it for you.”
"Still green, Sir."
Mr Cain wanted him to behave. Instead, he keeps his features calm, unperturbed. “What do you want to know?”
Blinks.
Tony smirks. He fishes it out. The photo ID for Steve is a picture from a textbook, his face grinning with red, chipmunked cheeks. About as far from the Steve Tony knows as he can get. “Hello?” He answers calmly, watching Ty’s eyes.
Richards screams when he drills the first burn against his brow. Steve covers his mouth with his hand. “You see,” he says, face screwed in concentration,  “you left burns all over my Tony. Do you remember that? You left them on his feet, you left them on his thighs. And he told me, you put them other places too, but then he got too upset, and he couldn’t finish.”
“I can’t believe it’s been three days. I can’t believe you’ve just – not told me. Or anyone. Is he pain? How bad?” Tony feels himself fretting, keeps him clamped down.
“There isn’t a cure,” Steve blurts “when we save Tony, he’s gonna run, he won’t, there isn’t a cure, there isn’t—”
