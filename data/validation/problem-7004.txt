Pepper and Tony were both screaming as Black Widow crossed the finish line two lengths in front of the next horse. Steve couldn’t stop the smile that spread across his face, thinking back to the last time he’d watched a race with Tony.
Pepper started to drift towards the stall, and Steve blocked her with his body. “I wouldn’t get too close to this one – she can be pretty feisty. But she’s in tip-top shape and ready for this race. If I were a betting man, I’d put money on her to win her race today. And then it will be on to bigger and better races for her.”
Not feeling up to talking to his Personal Assistant, he declined the call and closed his eyes again. Jesus he was hungover. The night before had been some charity or another – he couldn’t remember. He also couldn’t remember exactly where he was, or if he was alone. Tony considered opening his eyes again to check for a bed partner, but decided that would be too much work.
“Come on, Steve, loosen up a little. We’re going to the Kentucky Derby!” Bucky’s words slurred just a little, a testament to the number of drinks he had consumed since they got to the celebration. Steve toyed with the empty bottle in his hand, picking off bits of the label.
Nick stepped over to the wall behind Tony and switched on the lights, and then walked over to Howard’s desk, taking a seat in front of it and gesturing Tony over.
“Here she is right now,” Steve responded, seeing the line of jockeys making their way into the paddock. He gestured Widow’s jockey over, and then made introductions.
As they rounded the far turn, Steve saw Natasha drop lower over Widow’s neck, asking her to pick up the pace. They shot through a narrow opening between two horses, and then Natasha guided the filly over to the rail, asking her to squeeze between the rail and the third place horse. Steve again held his breath, worried that Widow would lose her focus on the race and focus instead on the horse practically touching her instead. But as though she had been doing it her whole life, Widow pushed through the opening without hesitating and was then in the clear, chasing down the dueling leaders.
“In a maiden race, you often have multiple horses that have never raced before. So it can be difficult to create a strategy when you don’t know the running styles of the horses you’re racing against. Plus, the horses are more likely to do something unexpected, like jump sideways when the gates open, or blow the turn and end up next to the grandstand instead of on the rail where you want them.”
“Alright,” Fury started. “The first thing you need to understand is that Stark Racing is a full service breeding and racing facility. Some farms only breed horses, and others only train horses. Stark Racing does both. While we don’t have a huge breeding program at this point, we do have one stallion and eleven broodmares. Seven of those broodmares are currently pregnant, set to foal any day now. On top of that, we have two foals already on the ground, plus nine yearlings, and dozens of two- and three-year olds.”
“One of those foals is now two years old, and is showing real promise. He’s the first Avenger offspring with the right bloodlines to win at a classic distance. All he needs is a chance.”
Pepper shook his hand once again, this time letting her hand linger in his for just a moment. “We’ll be there – won’t we Tony?”
“So I’m assuming there’s some sort of game plan,” Tony asked, interrupting Steve’s intense scrutiny of the filly. Steve looked over at him, allowing himself to really focus on the man for the first time that day. He looked good, in a suit and shades, his hair stylishly tousled.
Steve jerked his eyes away from Avenger to see Peggy Carter, Avenger’s jockey, standing next to him. He smiled at her, feeling the usual mix of admiration, adoration, and awkwardness bubbling under his skin. Peggy was everything he wanted to one day be. She was a successful jockey, second only to Ramon Dominguez in races won at Aqueduct during the current meet. She was incredibly skilled, with a reputation as a jockey who could finesse a difficult horse around the track. She was also gorgeous, forthright, and waiting for him to answer her.
Steve got up from his desk and walked out of his office and into the main barn aisle. Bucky followed, still loudly questioning Steve’s life choices. Steve looked around, taking in the sights and smells of Howling Commando Farm, where he and Bucky had both worked for the last decade. He could hear the horses in their stalls, munching on hay. He could see Dum Dum's big grey head hanging over the stall door, looking inquisitively their way. Yes, he loved it here. While HCF wasn’t a huge racing program like Stark Racing, it was a solid one.
Steve’s success had brought an increasing amount of nice horses his way, as well as several job offers from bigger race programs. He’d considered a few of them, but none had seemed quite right. And this offer definitely shouldn’t be the one he was seriously considering. And yet …
The filly turned and kicked the door of her stall, then stood with one hoof cocked, ready to strike out again.
“I’ve said for years that what we needed to do was breed Avenger to distance runners. I’ve had the bloodlines worked out on this plan, this Avenger Initiative, for years. Instead of pouring our money into horses that other people were breeding, we needed to focus on growing talent at home. And starting a few years ago Howard let me do just that, at least on a limited basis.
Sighing, Tony pushed himself out of bed as he called Pepper back, slowly making his way to the coffee machine he had spotted on the other side of the massive hotel room.
“With all the trick riding we have to do to stay on the young ones, I’m going to say it’s a little bit of both. Plus, this place is definitely fancy enough to be a castle. So the real question is, are you enjoying your tour so far, your majesty?” the man asked slyly, grinning in a way that invited Tony into the joke.
Steve smiled at the redhead in front of him, thinking that only Natasha would describe riding a tricky filly in a maiden race as “fun.” Unpredictable, frantic, scary – those were maybe some of the words other jockeys would have used. But not Natasha – she seemed to thrive on the difficult horses, and the challenging races.
“Already done. Dum Dum’s leg looks great, and he’s ready to be started back under tack and on limited turnout. The vet is pretty sure he’s going to heal up with no limitations. Who knows if he’s going to race again, but at least he’ll go on to have a good career off the track if he can’t. Now, stop changing the subject. Tell me about the phone call.”
Tony kept eye contact with the one large brown eye he could see as he moved within touching distance of the gleaming chestnut. He slowly raised one of his hands to stroke down the horse’s curved neck.
Steve looked over at the big bay, who was blowing in excitement at all of the hustle and bustle around him. Since the horses were normally exercised in the quiet of the morning, they always knew when it was race day. Instead of napping in their stalls, they were brought out before a crowd and paraded around before being asked to run longer and harder than they generally went in the mornings. Some horses reacted with trepidation to a change in their routine, and spooked at the loud noises and bright colors of a race day in full swing. So far, while Avenger was alert and on his toes, he wasn’t spooking or trying to bolt. His coat was dry and shining in the spring sunshine, while many of the other horses in the race had started to sweat with nerves. The four horse had already built a full lather of sweat, which was never a good sign – he was wasting his energy before the race even started.
Honestly, the last few hours weren’t overly clear in Tony’s mind. He remembered being at his dad’s party, bored and getting drunk. He remembered wandering around the room, hoping to find something (or someone) to occupy his time, and hearing a gorgeous brunette talking about a crush on him. And he remembered the thrill he felt when he realized that the person who had the crush on him was the same guy who not three hours before had been telling him he wasn’t worth anything. He’d decided to show Pint-size how wrong he was.
Avenger had run a brilliant race, hanging right off the lead until the final turn, and then blasting by the leader to win by eight lengths. Not only was Avenger now definitely qualified for the Derby, but by winning so decisively, he would likely be one of the favorites to win. By all accounts, Steve should be thrilled. In the past year he had gone from riding any rank nag that he could beg his way onto, to exercising a horse that was going to run in the most prestigious race in the country. He was going to Churchill Downs. He was going to see the twin spires up close, and be sharing the track with some of the biggest names in racing.
“You have a great horse there, Tony.” Steve held his hand out for Tony to shake. Tony grabbed it, but instead of shaking it, he pulled Steve in to him.
“Barton – do you have a minute?” Fury asked. “I have a meeting with breeding staff that starts in a few minutes, and I need to put in an appearance. Can you show Mr. Stark around until I get back?”
He was eyeing the rest of the horses in the paddock when he noticed Tony heading towards them with Ms. Potts beside him.
Tony’s phone started buzzing again, and he forced his eyes open. Pepper. Once more, Tony declined the call. There must be somewhere he was supposed to be, or something he was supposed to be doing. Whatever it was, he definitely wasn’t up for being scolded about it until he had about 10 cups of coffee in his system. Though based on how queasy he was feeling, he might be adding a little whiskey to the coffee.
Pepper shook her head, then ducked to the side to avoid the spray of a hose from a groom washing out water buckets.  “Tony, you’ve owned this racing operation for seven months, and you haven’t seen any of your horses run so far. Your father owned the farm for twenty years before that, and I don’t think you ever watched any of his horses run. In fact, you told me repeatedly what a waste of money and time the whole thing was. I’m fairly sure the phrase “rich men’s My Little Ponies” came up more than once.
Tony looked around for clues as he started the coffee. “Pepper, light of my life. I have absolutely no idea where I am – a hotel somewhere. I’m sure I’ll figure it out soon. So what did I miss? And just how much trouble am I in?”
“We’re not there yet, Rogers,” Phillips interrupted before Peggy could respond. “We have to make it through this race first, and god knows, anything can happen with horses.”
“This is a horse farm, not a spa. We have heat lamps in several of the barns, but very little of this place is heated. However, it is quite a bit warmer inside of the barns – the horses’ body heat raises the temperature a noticeable amount.”
“What the fuck is he doing here?” Bucky asked, his hand suddenly on Steve’s wrist like he needed to hold Steve back from – what? Running up and punching Tony in the face for not remembering him? Running up and begging Tony to remember him – the way Steve had always remembered, had held on to that memory in the twenty years since?
After racking his brain, Tony had placed the man as Steve’s friend from the post-race party so many years ago. Brady or Benji or something like that. Tony remembered bedroom eyes and a hilariously crude sense of humor. This man was still gorgeous and crude, but he was also angry and fiercely protective of Steve. And he was very clear that Tony was something that Steve needed to be protected from.
With dismay, Steve turned to follow Phillips into the grandstand. As he trudged behind the trainer and owners, he hoped that the Starks would continue to mostly ignore him. He would just stand quietly in the back of the box, and then escape as soon as it was reasonable to do so.
Indeed, the horses had all started to walk towards the other end of the paddock, where fans surrounded a big oval walkway. Steve waved to the groom walking Widow to start heading in that direction, and then started moving that way himself, a careful distance away from the filly. Tony, Pepper, and Bucky all followed, with Tony and Bucky seemingly in a staring contest with one another. Steve internally sighed, and turned his attention to Tony’s PA.
The paddock judge called for riders up, and Phillips gave Peggy a leg up into the saddle while Bucky continued to walk the horse forward. Avenger swiveled his ears back towards her, and Peggy talked to him in a low voice while she got her feet situated in her stirrups. The big thoroughbred arched his neck and began to jig a little with anticipation. He knew his job, and he was ready to run.
After Romanov had marched him into the living room, after Tony's miserably failed escape attempt, all eyes were on him. Tony prepared himself to look up, meeting the eyes of the others in a show of blatant defiance but quickly found himself looking away when he accidently met the eyes of this universe's Bruce, the man's calm brown eyes filled with tears of sadness and betrayal. No matter how different his universe's Bruce and this one's was, they looked the same and Tony hated seeing that look in his dear friend's eyes, aimed solely at Tony. Scowling at the floor to ceiling windows, Tony mentally screamed at himself, he shouldn't feel bad for trying to escape from a tower full of crazy and crazy powerful people that had imprisoned him.
Next was none other than Phil Coulson, in which Natasha and Clint rushed to, pounding on the surface of the glass to gain his attention.
Mechanically, Tony removed the metal plating that was just bellow the pad, fiddling with the wires and deciphering which ones went where. Soon everything fell away into muffled white noise as he yanked out the wires that would nullify the cages' defences and alerts that were all around it.
“Do you think Rogers will believe me if I said I got lost?” Tony pitifully joked after a few tense seconds of silence, a twitch of a smile on his lips as he side-eyed Romanov behind him.
"I'm fine." Tony nodded through his sore and scratchy throat, grimacing at the sound of it. "I'm fine." he stated again, more to himself that anyone else, before he used the surface of a table to pull himself up and steady himself.
When the shock wore off, Tony bit down hard on the invading appendage, making Rogers let out a grunt of pain and move back and leaving a trail of the dark Captain's blood on his lips. The smaller man tried to move back but was stopped by the bruising grip on his shoulder and the crazed look that Rogers had in his eyes as he smiled insanely at him. Tony felt all the blood drain from his face at the sight alone. The Captain shook his head, "Shouldn't have done that, Tones." he wagged his finger at the genius like he was a naughty child, looking far too please with himself.
"I could just slit your throat right now..." Rogers breathed almost lustfully, staring intently at Tony's neck, before he added the slightest bit of pressure and watched intently as a bead of life-blood shyly surfaced. He cupped his other hand around Tony's neck, his thumb sliding over the genius's Adam's-apple, as he leaned ever closer, brining his eyes up to penetrate into warm brown, "I've killed other's for less. I've killed children to discipline their parents, slaughtered men for getting my coffee wrong, obliterated families because I damn well felt like it, and tortured and killed the greatest world leaders for letting you die for them..."
Tony was in his own world and was trying hard to suppress his own tears of panic when the lower part of his face was clamped shut in a bruising grip, as they turned him over on the bed. Frightened, Tony could only breath hard through his nose as he tried to struggle, his restraints hindering most of his movement. He could only squirm before a hushed voice registered in his head, one that had Tony's eyes widening with shock and a dangerous amount of hope to suddenly flood his systems.
Some time during the fifth day (?), Tony was dragged out of the small dark, overheated room and was forced to stagger after a determined Thor, who had a firm grip on his arm, practically dragging him down the corridor. They didn't stop until they were outside of a large lab; a hazy look through the glass door showed that Bruce was in there, standing by a metal table, looking as equally determined as Thor.
His captors weren’t stupid, they were trained warriors and deadly spies that have killed and killed again, ruthless in getting exactly what they want and how they want it.
It was damn weird here. This world was mental, thrown into disarray and chaos through the decisions of a few. It scared Steve that he could have gone this way. This mental and deranged. All it would have taken was a little more force to his head when he crashed the plane in the Arctic and froze.
Jumping down flights of stairs, Tony focused on his breathing and the sounds around him, forcing himself to be as quiet but as fast as possible as he descended lower and lower down the building. When he got down to the fifth floor, Tony couldn’t suppress a winning grin as he found that he could barely hear the noises of battle and chaos, the air tasting all the more sweeter with every step he took— or that could just be Tony’s excited imagination.
In the distance, Tony could hear the sounds of fighting, guns raining down on both sides non-stop and a constant play of people screaming in terror and pain. With a sickening feeling in his gut, Tony turned from the screams of the helpless and dying as he ran, bear-foot, down the dimly lit hallway, not stopping or slowing down until he reached the stairs. For a split second, Tony contemplated taking the elevator but almost immediately decided against it when he found the stairway, not willing to risk running about and bumping into someone whilst looking for an alternate way down.
Staying still, Tony looked desperately into the cool blue of the eyes before him, attempting to portray all of his thoughts and exclamations of help into one stare alone.
Just when Tony thought that Rogers was just going to shut the door once again and walk off, he felt a pair of strong arms wrap themselves around him, careful of his healing arm, and gently press Tony into Steve's muscled chest, encouraging him to rest there. Fingers threading through his hair, accompanied by the soft voice of Rogers shushing him and telling him that everything was alright, that Tony had served his punishment well and that he was getting out of this god forsaken cell.
They really were going all out in the precaution area; on the trip from his ‘room’ to the kitchen, Tony had his hands shackled behind his back and Thor lug him over the his muscular shoulder on his way down. Even when they were fixing him to the chair, they had Steve do his arms and Clint do his legs at the same time, while Natasha had been staring him down, daring him to try and struggle against the two very-much-more-stronger-than-him men.
Tony’s smile was sad when he looked at his Science Bro, his voice was soft, “I’m sorry Brucie, I don’t belong here and god knows what’s happening with the longer I stay here: could be nothing, could be the end to all universes and dimensions of us and other worlds completely. You know how fragile this kind of thing is.”
But he froze when he realised what the Doctor had said. With wide eyes of shock, Tony slowly looked to this universe's Banner and couldn't help the stammer, "How- How do you know about... Af- Afghanistan?" In his head, his thoughts were in a whirl of chaotic rage and panic. How the hell did they know about his time in Afghanistan? Enough to know that he was in a cave while he was there and had been deprived of safe and sterilised medical equipment, apparently. Tony hadn't even told his team mates in his own universe, so how the hell did these people know?!
The cold floor of the ground floor, which was basically the reception area of the building, chilled Tony through to the bone as his bare-feet was forced to walk along the stone floors, making him shiver slightly. He got several stares from passer-bys and employees but they immediately averted their gazes when Tony attempted to meet their eyes, pleading desperation shining in his own, silently screaming for help.
This is a short story just a warning. It’s dark and a little weird… Don’t judge me!! This is something I wrote down before my exams started up and hadn’t had a chance to read through and edit a few obvious things but I’ve got a week off and can put a little time into finally getting this story up.
Thor, himself, had no pain of the mind or past. He was a Prince of Asgard and he’d been one for thousands of years, he had no idea why people had thought that a few weeks on Midgard without his powers would suddenly change many years of attitude. The only thing that he really regretted was the loss of his brother that day but that issue had been resolved after his first battle with his Midgardian comrades.
Each hit was like an extra crack to his already bruised ribs, one or two actually breaking from the force of it. By the time Rogers was finished, he had splatters of blood over his fists and was breathing heavily from his anger. Thor stood to the side, face expressionless as he looked upon the sight of his two bloodied team mates; Banner was no longer in the room. For a moment, there was only silence before Tony turned his head to the side and spat out some blood, ignoring the fact that most of the spit-out blood landed on his arm or chest instead of the plush sofa like he had intended it. He didn’t know what hurt worse, his neck and face or his ribs and lungs - arc reactor still heavy in his chest. Tony could only be grateful that Rogers didn’t accidentally hit in the centre of his chest, with that kind of force, he could have caused the reactor to crush his heart and lungs entirely…
"Lost?” Rogers chuckled, before he let his thumb trail down and rub over Tony's cheekbone, electing the genius to flinch and turn his head away from the offensive appendage. "We never loose, Tones. You only loose when you admit defeat and we all know that none of us are going to do that. What we are willing to do is go to drastic lengths to make something ours. By any force necessary." he stated. Though his last words sounded off to Tony, made fear fill up in his chest. It sounded like an apology.
Lazily, like he'd been doing it for years, Rogers tucked his head into Tony's shoulder, dragging his nose across the tanned, slightly dirtied, skin, inhaling softly, the flick of his heated tongue against the sensitive skin, getting Tony to squirm again, twisting in Steve's grip and muttering curses in different languages, demands for Steve to fuck off. The blonde soldier paid him no mind, the small flicks of his tongue becoming long licks from the base of Tony's neck, up to his ear, mapping out the expanse of his neck, his hand tickling over the surface of his chest, bushing over the small amount of muscle that the man had left and tracing the scarring with feather-light touches.
"Let me go, you bastard." Tony spat before he could stop himself, his face quickly loosing colour with the realisation at what he'd just said and the repercussions that could come to hand. He didn't want to go back into that dark room...
"I don't belong to anyone," Tony started off, his voice strained from the pain in his chest, "I'm gonna get out of here one way or another. Either I find a way to escape and create my own way home, or my team and friends back in my own universe will find a way to come and get me. Where they lack in savagery, like you, we make up for it in friends and allies. It's inevitable, and I can't wait to blast a hole through your stupid face when they finally do."
Suddenly, the hands moved away and Rogers' face was mere centimetres from his own, making his muscles tense and his breath freeze in his lungs. He could feel the dark Captain's unnatural body heat from where he was pinned. He was too close. Much too close for Tony's liking.
Disgust had Tony feeling the burn of bile rising in the back of his throat as he felt the invading tongue lapping at his gums. So much so that Tony clamped down, revelling in Rogers' muffled cry of pain.
After that, Tony had kept more to himself, not speaking up and not wanting to look at any of the dark Avengers but he knew that he was going to have to sooner or later if he ever wanted to escape.
What Tony desperately needed was an opportunity, an opportunity to escape, runaway, find a way back home, something.
Looking down at the dozing genius in his arms, Steve couldn't help a cruel smile flitting over his face, victorious and triumphant all in one. Steve knew that Tony was
Right then, the doors dinged open and Tony wiped all traces of his laugh off of his face because he knew that unlike his Steve, who would’ve given into Tony even if he just had watery eyes, this Steve Rogers— a darker more twisted man than the one Tony knew and befriended— would not give into a few tears and a mumbled apology. Tony had betrayed his budding trust by running away and trying to leave them all and no amount of pleading or begging will get Tony out of the unpredictable punishment that Rogers has conjured up in that homicidal brain of his.
Tony could only take a step back before he was being jumped by Thor. It was hardly a second later, Tony putting a few useless punches and kicks to the god’s face and a few shouted curses, and Thor was behind him putting Tony in a strong full nelson that he couldn’t break out of.
And five years later, Tony had been made the very apple of each of his teammates' eyes without even knowing it! Even Bucky considered Tony as a little brother (Cap, Nat and Buck more so than anyone else) of sort that he had to protect. But, for God's sake! He was a grown man and they treated him as if he were a child to be protected! It was sweet at times... But still damn annoying!
He wasn't privy to that first meeting between Peter and Tony, and that was at it should be. The two of them had acres of issues to hash out, and he'd probably only get in the way of that. Nobody ended up in medical, and while they both looked like they'd been crying they were also smiley and relaxed when they joined the rest of them at lunch. Since then Peter had been in and out with great frequency, and his Aunt May had even stopped by for dinner a few times.
"Nah. Not today. I'll finish this first. You're never going to really convert me, by the way. Especially since some of the shit you drink is just..." A shudder went through him, one that originated in his traumatized taste buds. "Whatever the hell you gave me last Saturday still haunts my dreams, Brucie. Why I still entrust you with selecting a morning blend for me to try I have no idea. I know I like to live life on the edge, but this is extreme even for me. Being Iron Man is less dangerous to my health - to my tongue, at least - and I'm pretty sure you could dump a ton of poison in any of this crap and I wouldn't be able to taste it. I'm leaving myself open to a lot of risk here, Brucie-bear. I hope you appreciate it."
"Uh... yeah. Definitely. Absolutely. You make the best plans, you strategist you. We will always go with your plans unless I come up with better ones. In this scenario though your idea blows mine out of the water. So... Fri?"
"I love you too." The smile he got for that could have blinded the damn sun. There were also more kisses that made the 'bots break out into their version of a cheer. This time they didn't stop making out until Dum-E grabbed his fire extinguisher and Butterfingers had a welder with U frantically trying to decide which of them to try and stop first. While maybe he was actually a little concerned with the mayhem that was possibly just around the corner mostly Steve was laughing too hard to keep his lips anywhere near Tony's.
The serious tone of his voice sent tingles of delight up Steve's spine, and if he'd been standing his knees probably would have gone a little weak. Christ, Tony was going to start hugging him. Tony was maybe going to
Your opinion of what is happening is also irrelevant. And wrong as well - your lover was brought through by Soul and had less distance to travel.
"If Tony makes it'n I don't... I want ya ta take him back to our world. Drag Harley'n Peter'n Rhodey'n... and all-a my people that make it. Take 'em back with ya and try ta keep 'em safe. Don't let them kill themselves tryin' ta 'fix' it. Just... just kidnap 'em ta give 'em a chance ta heal."
"It's not too much, Tony," she finally said. Her voice was warm and gentle, and her eyes were lit with understanding and love. "You've all been getting along so much better--"
"Maybe so, but you're her ma. Gotta have your help with the naming, don't I?" Tony's mouth dropped open even wider than his eyes and he seemed to sag a little harder against the wall. She whined quietly and nudged his hand until he looked down at her, hand moving to scratch behind her ears. To his eyes Tony looked overwhelmed and maybe a bit teary, like maybe he hadn't realized that if Tony's kids were his then his kids damn well were Tony's too. Robot, dog, Avenger... didn't matter. He liked that they were in taking care of them all together.
in a kiss after tugging the man down onto his lap. After a fight he always craved contact and intimacy; Steve curled into him like he always did, more than willing to provide. The Defenders greeted him and Steve replied without even trying to pull away to sit in his own chair. Tony would never get over the novelty of having a partner who let him indulge in sweet, mostly chaste public displays of affection.
"Since I get to hold you a lot sooner than I expected I'm okay with that." Tony briefly hid in his shoulder, which he suspected was done to hide a blush. He squeezed the man a bit tighter and ran his free hand down his back. Tony retaliated by squeezing his butt again - probably done to make him start blushing - then tipped his head back to look up at him.
It hurt too much, and Peter was pretty understanding of that. He brought the grandkids to visit them instead, along with his pretty wife who was just a little bit crazy in the best way. Harley never settled down the same way, not until Captain Katie Danvers blew onto the scene. Fresh from an encounter with Mar-Vell, she had more than enough sass and fire to capture Iron Maverick's heart; Steve maintained it was the fact that she could absolutely kick Harley's ass that had done his kid in. The pair were too busy serving justice in space to have kids, but they were both great at the roles of Fun Aunt and Cool Uncle whenever they were on Earth.
Loki looked uncomfortable with the praise, though he quickly hid that behind a bored expression. "It was nothing."
"Damn right ya do." The love and approval in Steve's voice warmed him better than scotch ever had. "Proud-a ya for knowin' that. Still would kill 'em for ya if ya wanted though."
"We're here to save you Tony. Why didn't you... I know we had our disagreements, but why didn't you tell me you were in trouble? I sent you that phone for a reason."
"Being helpful is overrated. Once ya stop it, you can start comin' into my workshop again." The slight Brooklyn lilt to the words would have made Steve hide a smile. He just rolled his eyes, wishing Harley would pick some other way to take after his da. "You ready ta go, or are you backing out?"
As he was turning around, however, he spotted something that had the potential to derail their whole night. Hell, it could ruin
of all people, he'd been worried. He had been so fucking afraid that he would be found lacking and that Steve would turn him away in favor of a different Tony Stark.
. The days when he sighed and lamented over how Tony never touched him were over, and he couldn't wait to tell Nat. Maybe he'd get a medovik cake for happy reasons, or maybe he could even talk her into making one of them Tula pryanik things she talked about but refused to spend the time baking.
"Oh. My. God. So that isn't just a rumor?" Peter just about knocked his dish over when he leaned forward in excitement, eyes dancing with delight. "It's a real thing? Helen Cho is... oh my God. She's a
"I'd be just as happy to cuddle the fuck out of Captain America. Now that I know you're not hug-averse, buckle up buttercup. We are now people who hug."
"You just invited a bunch of tree-rats to live with us," Tony breathed in his ear as Doreen thought hard about whether or not to tell them where she'd been staying before running away. "Tree-rats and a toddler."
U had no such compunctions. He zoomed over to Steve’s side of the bed, beeping and whistling in a shrill, almost desperate tone. Maybe he hated that his lover removed one arm from their comfortable snuggle, but he couldn’t begrudge U the comfort of physical touch from the man they had all missed so much. Steve draped one hand over the 'bot's main strut and didn't even flinch when U's claw landed heavily only an inch from his face.
But his warm, calloused hand was still on Steve's bare arm, so. It was absolutely a mark in the 'Win' column.
Mary Mother of God he hoped that if they could win the coming battle the same would be true for Tony. He had heard the yearning note in his fella's voice when they'd talked about the constellations in their respective worlds. He saw the way Tony would sometimes try to look up at them and ignore everything but their gentle twinkle; the look of peace mingled with wonder on his face during those precious moments was something to behold. He wanted that for Tony all the time, not just in the calm before the inevitable storm his mind brought crashing down on him.
Tony's mouth parted in a surprised gasp under his own, and he had less than a heartbeat to worry that maybe-- But then the genius surged against him, his arms going around Steve's neck. The kiss was clumsy, full of more desperation than he might have liked... but it was also perfect. It was him and Tony, both of them breathless and soon smiling too wide to keep going. Now he knew that Tony's lips were much softer than he would have expected and knew what that ridiculous goatee felt like tickling his skin. He knew how it felt to have Tony pressed tight against him; he knew what the genius' laugh tasted like.
The last thing he saw before the elevator doors closed was Captain America looking down at the floor, hands clenched into fists at his side. His jaw was tight with something that looked a lot like disappointment. He didn't even have a sketchbook, Tony realized suddenly. The guy definitely hadn't come up to the common floor to draw - he had wanted company. Before he could call out a second invitation, try to convince him to come along, the door slid shut.
"I’m right there with him," Steve murmured as the elevator doors slid open again, signalling their arrival to the common floor. He might have kept asking about Loki, Frigga and Odin... but he was distracted pretty damn quick by a guest he hadn't been aware the Avengers were hosting. The reveal soured his mood instantly, undoing all the good his workout with Thor had done.
Tony hadn't exactly cleared out a space for him in the workshop, not like the one Bruce had been given, but he still had an area that everyone considered his. It was pretty much the only clear patch of table space in the whole room. Sometimes he had to shove spare parts or schematics out of the way a little, and every once in a while there'd be a few mugs half-filled with sludge that had once been coffee. Whenever Tony noticed that he would hurry to clear it though, which was awful sweet of him.
"And you should make it all official and shit. So the Avengers stop pesterin' ya to come back and fight. I know ya don't want to and you shouldn't have to. Aunt Pep has got a great handle on SI, and I'm pretty sure she's gonna have Peter working there soon. He'd be a good person to leave SI to when she's ready ta step down."
"I'm not anymore and that's that. I like being Maverick - colors are more up my alley." Tony cooed at him for the answer, then tried to kiss him. Steve immediately planted a hand on his face and pushed him away. "Not in front of the papes!" he whispered, probably hoping I wouldn't hear. Tony pouted but settled quickly, one arm still wrapped around Steve.
debauchery," Tony muttered, eyes flicking to and away from Captain America's face. "This happened maybe fifteen years ago."
He hadn't known that, but now he did know the first kind of flower he was going to buy for the genius. Though he did sort of wonder why Tony knew about their meaning.
God, that sounded really fucking lonely. Maybe he didn't really understand the whole situation - he was mostly going on Fri's begrudging account of things - but he already wanted to take the kid home and feed him. Looked thinner than he probably should be after all. High metabolism because of superpowers had been a bitch for the army to manage. A kid whose family didn't seem real well off who was hiding his abilities probably didn't get anywhere close to eating enough calories in a day.
"I was!" STAR piped up, curling further into his throat. "I did. But then this guy showed up and said that he was here to see you and I said over my dead body and Fi-fi said--"
"Get me..." his voice sounded rusty and not his own. He licked his lips and swallowed a few times, staring into bright, concerned blue eyes. "Get me out of here."
"Steve's right, Miss Doreen. And Mr. Doctor Strange knows that - he was just trying to help." The man in question huffed loudly but also nodded his head. "And I'm sure he's sorry that he was rude to your friend." Steve hurried to start talking before Stephen could inform the poor kid that he wasn't sorry at all - none of them needed that fight.
"I'm not going to run again." Bucky's voice was stronger than he would have given the guy credit for, and he was still looking at Winter head on. Maybe there was more there than met the eye and he needed to stop judging situations he didn't know anything about. It was just... he looked at Bucky and saw exactly what he hadn't wanted for Winter. "You kept the name?"
"We've been upgrading," the little robot snarked, flying through the air between them to join their dance. "Let me try."
Between the hum of the lights, the vibrations running through the walls and floors and the continuous cycle of air through every room, Steve had a hard time finding any kind of peace at the compound. Tony didn't find it easy either; it had taken his and STAR's combined efforts to get his fella to sleep. Their girl had settled in on one of their pillows to guard Tony's sleep and keep an eye out for the Witch. He appreciated it, because otherwise his sweetheart would never sleep restfully. Even if Steve had remained in the room and on guard, STAR and her constant vigilance paired with the tricks Stephen had taught her were the only things allowing Tony to get any kind of rest.
“Nope.” Despite knowing it was a bad idea, Tony let himself lean harder against his friend. “I was kind of thinking Italian though, so maybe I’ll get some pasta.”
Loki lavished the pair of them with gifts and was teaching them all his favorite tricks. Tony still didn't trust the fucker, but he was so damn nice to the kids that it was hard not to like him a little. He almost saw what Other Tony saw in Lokes... not that he would ever admit it.
"Vacation." Steve agreed firmly. "We're takin' one with most-a the kids. Dunno if Harley or Peter'll wanna come. Laney's got school, so she probably wouldn't be allowed. Alicia's serious about education. Should I get Pegs ta start lookin' for a beach house?"
"If ya say what I think you're gonna say, you'll be grounded for a week. The plane's about ta land. Ya don't wanna be here'n neither do I. There's a few-a us that'd rather be pretty much anywhere else. But ya listen here," Steve didn't have to bend down to reach Harley's level, but he did lean forward and locked eyes with the teen. It was effective in that at least Harley stopped scowling and had a more serious look on his face. "This was an Avengers decision. We all got together'n voted. The three-a ya voted too, and when ya participated in that vote--"
"So given that... as much as ya don't wanna be here ta see them assholes come home, is there really anywhere else ya wanna be?"
He didn't even use anyone's real name when he did it, which had Steve gnashing his teeth in righteous anger long before Loki's staff had come into play. It was easy to reject every bit of good he could see in Tony - and Christ, there was so much of it if you knew how to look - and focus on that instead. He told himself that Tony was everything he hated about the future combined with everything he'd hated about his past, and Steve had tried so, so hard to hate him too.
So when Steve burst into the workshop, red-faced and with what looked like neon purple slime splashed over most of his clothes, Tony didn’t miss a beat. He didn’t waste time with questions or wondering - though he had a lot of the first for Clint later - and manfully kept in his laughter. In fact he didn’t even let Steve yell the way he clearly wanted to before butting right in.
Steve didn't bother to even pretend to be listening to the conversation going on as he wandered over to the fridge. He was thirsty, and the chance of nobody speaking to him was too high. If it happened he'd just get upset and have to go take it out on some poor canvas that didn't deserve to be treated so bad. The shrink who was sneaking around Fury to speak with him regularly would be proud of how self-aware he was becoming, even if she'd probably say his coping skills weren't exactly aces.
"The next... right. The next dog is going be named Nova, thank you very much. But for her... I like Primrose." Tony bit his lower lip, eyes meeting his fleetingly before going back to Primrose. His shoulders were suddenly hunched up defensively again, and Steve ached to go and wrap him up in a hug. "One of the meanings is 'I can't live without you'."
. He was almost giddy with the success of it, which was ridiculous of him. Maybe he would have felt worse about that if it wasn't the first time he had actually managed to make Cap laugh. Hell, he could count on his fingers the number of times he had even heard the sound before. It was a really, really big development... and he was terrified that if he stuck around he was going to find a way to ruin it. "You both make it so hard to leave--"
That laughter he'd been so damn proud of keeping under wraps exploded out of him, but thankfully Peter only pouted for a second before sheepishly joining in. Soon after that they were chatting with even more ease than he managed with Harley. Between updates on Tony and his halting attempts to describe the Cradle, he drew details of Peter's life out of the teen in return. Aunt May sounded like a firecracker, Ned like everything a best friend should be, and Liz as impossibly perfect as every first crush ever was. The kid was clearly a genius and he had a good life that had been made far too difficult by the super-secret he was carting around with him.
Those clever fingers dug into the perfect spot, and he couldn't help but moan and go boneless. Tony only laughed and kept his focus on that area, working it until the little knot of tension was gone. "So how about you call Miss Margaret and Shellhead and get them working on things? I'll talk to Pep, Rhodey and Carol and see what kinds of loose ends we need to tie up before we go. I don't want them calling us for every little thing, especially not at first. I don't mind if it's some kind of emergency, but--"
"Jan." The reprimand from Peggy was unexpected and harsh, but the other woman only grimaced before holding her tongue. "I'm sorry for intruding like this Steven. And to the rest of you as well - we have no intention of harming anyone, I promise you," she added to Tony, who of course still didn't lower his gauntlet. A brief smile tugged at her lips, the same fond exasperation on her face that anyone who loved a Tony Stark seemed to develop. "Or of snatching anyone away. We wouldn't have come at all, but--"
"And keep your snark to yourselves for just a little bit longer if you please. Okay. No offense, Tiny Adorable Steve, but we're gonna do ladies first on this one."
"Big mood, daaaa... Mister Stark. Tony." Peter bounded over with absolutely zero grace, practically falling against Harley when the other teen didn't move out of the doorway. "I definitely feel you on that one. But hey! My 'stuff' isn't bad. You both just have awful music taste. I'm only trying to help."
"Nope. Will have ta start talkin' to 'em more though. If I'd been keepin' in touch all along they wouldn't have come chargin' in the way they did. So I'm sorry for that. I know it caught ya off guard and got your brain thinkin' all kind-a crazy things."
“Aww, cookie crumble.” Steve turned bright red the way Tony had hoped he would, still not used to the affectionate nicknames he lavished on his friends. “I didn’t know you cared.” It was a lie, because of course Steve cared.
"Forget I asked. I'll have her show me the way. Steven? I'm very glad to see you again." Before he could answer she swept out of the room, already talking to FRIDAY to locate STAR.
Steve felt his brows raise as surprise registered. He never would have expected JARVIS to have an opinion on his clothes, let alone prefer a shirt that Clint had called 'bordering on criminally obscene'. It hadn't seen the light of day since that initial try, even if both Nat
Rogers was the first off the plane, and it was still so fucking hard to look at him. There was not a hint of remorse or hesitation on that All American face. The bastard was all smiles and ease, like this was always going to happen. Like he
"I ain't killing trees just because it's easier," Steve argued back. He was still at my feet cleaning up, so I could see the way the back of his neck went pink. I have to tell you that Maverick is in possession of a thick, wonderful Brooklyn accent. It was enough to make me swoon, especially with the way he was kneeling in front of me. Tony was watching me like he knew what I was thinking, and it was my turn to blush when he winked again.
He knew Captain America didn't like him very much, but he still felt for the guy. Captain America deserved better than squatting at SHIELD HQ.
a huge name here, pops." Tony's eyes flew up to Harley's, and his kid looked as serious as he ever had. Did that mean... did Harley want... "One of the best for robotics, actually. Jan and Shellhead said that if I'm lookin' for a school, that's the one I want. Said that for backups I should look at--"
"Liar. Peter checked in while you two were out. He and Harley should be home around dinner time. Rhodey's been showing them after battle protocol or something? Since they're big boys now."
"No, it's completely fair. They're always coming here for everything. Christmas, birthdays, even that wedding reception." Why, oh
Dum-E handed over his last pencil, and he broke out into a brilliant grin. "Thanks Dum-E! That was the fastest you ever got 'em back to me yet." The 'bot lifted up straight and made a cheerful little sound that never failed to lift Steve's spirits. "Yeah buddy - you did great. Always do. Wanna get your ball? I can prob'ly throw it a couple few times before Tony starts hollerin'."
"Thanks starry skies." He paused, taking a moment to wish all the interlopers would leave and give him a second with his daughter. "Thanks for taking them through the portal." She only sniffed and curled closer to Winter, who covered her with one large hand. It wasn't the time to try and talk it out, so he let her be and ambled to the kitchen table. "I still don't get why you all are here when you should be, you know, keeping your own planet safe."
Harley thought about uncle Rhodey and the way he had to do deep breathing exercises before he stepped into the War Machine armor. He knew that somewhere in the compound aunt Pep was pacing in her highest-heeled shoes and her sharpest business suit, so afraid of losing herself to her superhero identity the way so many of the ones she'd known had. In the gym Rogers would be decimating punching bag after punching bag, with Bucky sitting off to the side without his metal arm, watching on in thin-lipped silence. Aunt Carol was probably still awake and up in space, circling the earth and waiting for any sign that their intel was wrong and Thanos arrived sooner than expected. Harley knew that every Avenger had their hangups, that every single damn one of them struggled at least sometime with the things they did and the things they saw.
"Yup. Bought a building, hired some staff, the works. Those rats lived like goddamn kings for the rest of their lives. Shelter's still up and running, actually. They take in all the odd and weird kinds of pets that people get rid of or mistreat. Great place that he never tells anyone about. Won't let them list him as the founder, won't attach his name to it at all - he was always afraid the people who hate him would do something to the animals to get back at him. They send him pictures, I think, and he funds all their day to day operations as anonymous donor, but otherwise he keeps his distance."
That was sweet enough that it helped get his laughter down to giggles. When he felt Harley's sharp eyes on him though he sobered right up, meeting that gaze head-on. Tony had been talking about him to people, even this teenager who maybe wasn't blood but was still important to him. He wanted to make the best impression he possibly could on all of Tony's kids.
He couldn't hear what they were saying, but it looked like there was a short, passionate argument that glaive guy won. Spear chick nodded, looking up at glaive guy like he was her world, and it was almost enough to make him feel bad. Then he looked over to where Rescue was slowly climbing to her feet and that bit of empathy was lost.
"We can even work on that, if you want. Workshop design I mean. I'm thinking a floor or two away from this one--"
, and he had promised to bring some books and tech back from Asgard for Tony to study. Primers meant for children, he had cautioned with a twinkle of mirth in his eyes, because he didn't want to make Tony's poor mortal brain hurt too much.
This interview ended with a hug from Steve and a handshake from Tony. They both said they would try to schedule another sit-down soon, one where we wouldn't have to spend the first half an hour getting to know each other. Look forward to that, and don't forget to check out our website! There will be an extended list of some of Maverick's likes and dislikes - from this world and his own! - along with quite a few photos that didn't make it into this spread.
He was jolted out of his thoughts when the aircraft finally touched down. A growing unease began to overtake him as he watched the Rogues get closer and closer to invading his life all over again. It was easy to know that Rogers and his team wouldn't be allowed anywhere near him, but harder to feel like it was true in his heart and his gut. Harley moved to stand even closer so their sides were pressed together, and Kamala's arms were suddenly long enough to wrap around the both of them. Steve was still in front of him, and he noticed that several other Avengers had shifted slightly so they were between him and any threat the Rogues may present.
"She?" The little differences were fucking fascinating. He kind of wanted to sit down with Shellhead and make some kind of sprawling comparison chart to have around for giggles and reference.
For the first time, none of it seemed out of his reach. Steve loved him and he loved Steve - maybe 'deserving' wasn't part of it at all. Maybe it was just about letting himself reach for something that would make him happy. So he was going to try, and Howard Stark could go fuck himself. Captain America more than liked him, and that knowledge curled up inside his chest, warm and soft and bright. It left no room for Howard's bile, and for the first time since he was twelve the burn of whiskey and self-loathing was nowhere to be found.
"Excuse you," Tony himself interrupted while Dum-E whizzed away to find his ball. "I don't 'holler'. I try to direct my
"Tony!" He hoped the laughter in his voice would soften the interruption; sure enough Tony was grinning when he looked up. "Can it and let me talk a minute, will ya? I know she needs a name and I've been thinking of which one to give her. Just... I wanted to wait for you. Thought you might like a say in it."
“First of all, ya don’t need him that bad. There’s other people that’ll help ya. Has ta be. So start there. Second, even if ya did need him that ain’t no excuse for his behavior. Maybe I won’t kill him but we are gonna have some words.”
The silence that fell wasn't awkward, exactly, but it wasn't comfortable either. Peter was clearly gearing up to ask him something, but his eyes were also flicking constantly to the table next to them, where there was a group of kids pigging out with some very... interesting creations. Steve's simple vanilla bean yogurt and Peter's even smaller strawberry yogurt seemed plain and almost unappetizing in comparison. That was longing in Peter's eyes, and clearly the teen had chosen budget over anything else.
"I'm gonna sneak you in some coffee. It's the least I can do since you're so damn forlorn about not getting to go home right away." Suddenly Steve was leaning in, and then there was a pair of dry, chapped lips pressed against his temple. They stayed there several beats too long for it to be just a friend-thing, especially when Steve breathed in his can’t-shower-yet stink like it was the best perfume he'd ever smelled. "I'll be right back," he murmured against Tony's skin, and holy shit.
"Already landed. Don't think it's a dream." He looked over the room again, brain just a smidge more awake and aware after the partial meal. "They all look kinda mad. Don't think I'd dream 'em that way." Tony made a considering noise, then shrugged and went back to eating. The food was good, filling and he hadn't had to struggle through making it so Steve followed his example.
"I wanted to say... I uh. I heard about JARVIS. While I'm not surprised yours took up the mantle of hero, I'm sorry that you lost him because of it."
It only took a few quick strides to get around the bed and to his lover. Tony was so lost in misery and self-created angst to even notice his approach. That made it easy to sweep the man into his arms and hold on tightly while also tipping them over onto the bed. The move was unexpected enough that Tony broke into surprised laughter, and with warm affection running through him Steve followed suit. A few moments later they were snuggled together on top of the covers, facing each other and so close that their foreheads touched while they shared breath.
"Primrose it is. I'm prob'ly gonna call her Rosie a lot," he admitted with a grin. Tony rolled his eyes like he wasn't going to come up with a dozen nicknames of his own for their girl. Steve stuck his tongue out at the genius, then headed for the two of them. He went to his knees in front of Primrose and began to enthusiastically rub her ears. "You've got a name now sweetheart, yes you do. My little Primrose. Ya like that, huh?" It was hard to tell if the enthusiastic tail wagging was from the petting or the new name, but it didn't really matter. She was happy and that was all he cared about.
Not all of it, of course. The blatant rudeness and the catcalling he witnessed were two things he could do without for sure. He tried to step in where he could to change things when warranted. Sometimes it backfired, sometimes he could help out, and sometimes he very much wanted to get his shield and bash at some hard heads to try and get through to people. It was all too loud for his ears sometimes, and he didn't know why everyone had to be on their cell phones every minute of the damn day, but there were good things too.
was quick to give him a little squeeze and make a shushing sound. “I’ll never go back there without ya Tony. They all… everyone wants ta meet ya. I’ve been talkin’ ya up for so long most of them feel like they already know ya. So if I go ta visit then you’re comin’ with me.”
"I get it, Harls. I don't want my Tiny Adorable Steve to have a meltdown any more than you do, I promise."
And really, when he thought about the last couple weeks - Tony's oddness, his talk with Rhodey, his new love of outdoor jogging - Steve could very clearly see the hand of fate. He had been brought to this moment in time for a reason, and who was he to deny that? Who was he to walk away from a moment so clearly crafted just for him?
"Civics. I need a good civics lesson Fri, and not just focused on the good ol' USA. Gotta know 'bout the world stage too, 'cause otherwise I'm never gonna understand the big picture the Avengers were operating in. My friend Pegs used ta tell me all the time - ‘context is everything, Stevie’," he said, doing his best to speak with Peggy's posh accent. "’Without it you never know if you're stabbing the right person’."
"Will do Boss. I'll have him bring in some trays too since I anticipate you both eating breakfast in bed."
"Corvus Glaive is down, where do you want us Captain?" Peggy's cool report was being delivered to Captain
Jess was the one who moved to fill the gap, already bleeding from a head wound and scratches running down her chest. None of it slowed her down, so Tony was pretty sure that line would hold. And really, Wanda would rather die than let anyone else have Vision, so maybe it was for the best. The chick with the spear was the one who seemed most interested in obtaining the Space Stone, though glaive guy kept stepping in to fight at her side. Seemed personal more than anything, which they could use--
“Yes breathe. Please breathe. If Steve found me in here with you not breathing he’d fucking kill me.”
“Why can’t we have something simple?” Bruce’s quiet voice cut through the squabbling even if none of them worried he would go green at the smallest insult anymore. “I spent all day in my lab and my head hurts. “That diner a few blocks away has plenty of choices, and I really want one of their Reuben sandwiches and some french fries.” He turned his gaze to Tony, smile tired as he pulled off his glasses. “It’ll also get here the quickest,” he said while rubbing his eyes. “I just want to eat and then lay down.”
That thought was acknowledged for the warmth it gave him, then firmly set aside before it could bring him lower than the basement. It was more important to stay in the moment with Tony, Clint and Nat. Especially since now he could see they'd been playing one of the Call of Duty games. It was hard to keep an innocent look on his face but he did his damnedest. Everyone always forgot how good his spatial memory was, and Clint wouldn't know how well Steve knew all the maps until it was too late.
would never do something like that. I'm going to be very responsible with these babies. But you never know - I might lose some. If that were to, hypothetically speaking, happen and someone used those misplaced arrows for evil... well. I bet Hill would be pissed enough that they'd start searching the vents for me on the wrong assumption that I did it. It would be a great opportunity for someone - some arrow stealing, very naughty someone who is definitely not going to be me - to sneak into Fury's office through means other than the vents."
More than anything you have ever felt before, little Mechanic. But if you can bear it, if you make it through, then the threat of Thanos will be over. Your world and those you love will be safe, and I will never ask this of you again. It is your choice, however. We cannot force you.
scary. I mean, nobody else was... you were so cool, the way you were helping dad do the air support thing, you know? Like, you weren't scared at all I bet, and I wasn't really either. It was just... just different than I thought it would be. And I'm kind of lying, because I was super scared for most of the fight. I just. I guess I really like being a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Maybe I'm not cut out for this big league stuff. Nobody else--"
“Butterfingers! Watch your mouth! You see? That’s your influence, Steven. He learned all his bad habits from you.” Clint, practically howling with laughter now, just held on to Butterfingers’ struts as the ‘bot hauled him across the room to the couch. “Any other choice phrases you’d like to teach the boys?”
And anyway at least STAR hadn't abandoned him. She'd hopped off Steve's shoulder and was now settling on his, one tiny hand pressed reassuringly against his pulse point. "I won't let him hurt you," she whispered, easing the knot of tension lodged in his chest where Roger's shield had hit. "None of them will get close. And if that witch is here... Dr. Strange taught me some things and you have the amulet he sent for you. It's going to be okay Tony. I promise."
"I have analyzed the vessels, Colonel, but their exterior is uniform. The only weak point appears to be the door."
"Well that's that then. We didn't bring the whole team, before you get your panties in a bunch. It's us three, Miss Margaret, Natalia, Jan and Hank. Strange will be leaving soon, because using two Time Stones in the same fight is just asking for trouble and the only reason he came in the first place was to annoy Lokes here. Clint will be staying for a bit, then we'll swap him out for somebody else. Lots of the Defenders wanted to come," Tony told them with twinkling eyes. "We had to set up a rotation for one member of our little rescue team or there would have been a mutiny."
“Thinking is all I have left to me in the whole of this cruel world. You and everyone else have turned against me and taken away every interesting activity. Except Clint, but I'm only allowed to look at screens for… they upped it to what, half an hour at a time? I’m in the rest period from the DS And he took all the other fun stuff so it didn't get confiscated. I am suffering here, Steve, and none of you will let me go home.”
"You're ridiculous'n I love ya. Now. All we had for dinner was movie snacks. Do ya want me ta make somethin' more fillin'?"
"Apples?" It was tentative and hopeful, that small interruption, with the genius gripping his shirt even tighter.
"I am absolutely willing to fuck their shit up if you feel like you have to be the good guy here. No, really," Shellhead continued when Tony only gave a brief chuckle and a tired smile. "I will track their asses down wherever they are and give them the beatdown they deserve because I doubt Steve did. Bet he didn't even punch Rogers in the dick like he was supposed to."
"Why didn't you?" he asked, ignoring the way they were both dancing around actually saying the word love. For the moment, anyway. "I thought I messed things up. I know at medical I was a little intense--"
"The two-a ya need ta talk, that's what. It's gettin' ridiculous. Tony, I love ya and someday I'm gonna put a ring on your finger. Shellhead, you're my best friend'n I love ya like a brother. So the two-a ya not talkin' breaks my heart a little." He was laying it on thick, but it was for a good cause. Especially since the two men were now eyeing each other curiously instead of thinly veiled anxiety. "So me'n Fri here decided ta facilitate the conversation."
As Bruce was mulling the invitation over, Captain America wandered into the common kitchen. He was clearly fresh from the gym - so fresh he hadn't even showered yet, which shouldn't have been as attractive as it was. Tony thought a lot of that came from the way Cap was much more loose-limbed than usual. He looked almost happy, or at least his face wasn't as tight as it usually was. It was a good look on him, and the way he liked his shirts at least two sizes too small certainly didn't hurt.
Jan had captured both Peter and Harley's hearts, and they were huddled together showing off memes and cat pictures one last time before she went off to her own world. He had a feeling he was in for a world of begging in a day or two, and that it would continue until he caved and invited her for a visit. Both boys were starstruck, and she was certainly taking her sweet time in joining the other Defenders. She was absolutely going to be their new favorite aunt.
"We'll surface for your food probably. I missed your potato salad more than I missed you, to be honest." Loki came up behind Shellhead and slipped his arms around the man's waist. It was still really fucking weird to see a version of him cuddling up to the guy who had turned New York into a battleground in
"I know, sweetheart. I know I'm big and prob'ly scary looking. You take your time getting used to me, okay? Kid I sent off to get you a treat should be back soon, unless he ran off with the money I gave him. Never can tell, but you can hope, isn't that right sweetheart? Yeah, you just have to keep hoping. You're gonna be a beauty once I can get you home and taken care of. Always wanted a dog, you know? And Tony won't kick you out, I'm sure of it. Rescued a bunch of rats one time, ain't no way he'd make me put you back on the streets."
"You have to wake up," he whispered, and saw Helen's face melt into something awfully close to sympathy from the corner of his eye.
"It's fine. I'm gonna hop in the shower, so tell Clint he can come in and get her whenever so long as he doesn't go stealing any of my underwear again. It wasn't funny then and it won't be funny now. Underwear theft is
She evaded Captain Marvel's first strike only to have his ion beam skim over her left shoulder. As she tried to readjust her stance, head whipping towards him, Captain Marvel struck again. This time her fist collided right into spear chick's jaw and shoved her right into the ion beam that he'd never let up. Her shriek echoed over the battlefield and everything seemed to stop and go quiet for just a few heartbeats. He didn't feel anything but triumph as the ions ripped through her armor and then through flesh - he was pretty happy that most smells couldn't make it through the suit's air filtration system, because from Captain Marvel's wrinkled nose, spear chick was definitely smelling like barbecue.
"Did you smoke any strange roots or anything while you were in Wakanda?" Nat didn't give anything away, but Tony could read Rogers and Sam like a book. "Oh please. Where else could you have gone? It wasn't that hard to figure out. I am surprised T'Challa gave you an aircraft."
"Agent Carter?" Both Winter's voice and facial expression shifted just a little, a touch of warmth entering that cold facade. "She isn't so bad, even if she kept me locked up for so long." Natalia said something in Russian that set STAR to giggling while Winter growled back at her; thankfully the animosity seemed more playful than anything. "Ignore her. Natalia thinks since I once taught her knife work I won't stab her with one."
So he wasn't jealous that Shellhead had ended up with an amazing team. It just sharpened his own yearning to have the same, and God he hoped that they could build something like that with the next set of Avengers. If anyone could make that kind of team happen it was his platypus, and whatever Pepper thought he knew Rhodey would take the challenge and run with it. Probably would even enjoy it, because within the boundaries of the Accords he was going to have more freedom than the Air Force had ever given him.
"It's just... we barely got him ta accept I ain't a clone or somethin' like that. Still seems ta think I'm somehow trickin' Tony inta lovin' me--"
The only one who wasn't very happy about it all was Harley. The two teens were dancing around each other like dogs preparing to fight, and he had a feeling the results were going to be explosive. It reminded him of U's behavior right after STAR had been brought online, but he wasn't quite sure what to do about it. Tony was just as clueless, so for now they were just sitting back and hoping for the best.
Harley started laughing a beat after he did, probably at the mortified look on Tony's face. Soon enough even the genius succumbed however, until they were one laughing, hugging, crying mess. Of course his fella only laughed for as long as his broken-up body would let him. Then he descended into coughs and moans of pain, sending up enough red flags that Dum-E, U and STAR burst through the door in their usual dramatic fashion to check on him.
Rogers stared at him for a long second, then sneered and stormed out of the room. He left a smear of blood behind on the doorknob, which someone was bound to ask questions about. He looked to the knife that had caused the injury and hoped like hell that Rogers hadn't gone to the range. Heaven help the bastard if he provoked Winter while he had a gun in his hand. Hopefully Rogers had just run to Carol to complain about their presence and maybe demand she get rid of them.
"You let me help you then, remember? You asked for my help and I did it. I did everything you asked--"
It would run like a dream and be perfectly suited to the way he drove, Steve knew that much. If Tony had started and stopped several times he couldn't imagine how long he'd been working on the thing. So much work, sweat and probably even blood had gone into it, and he had started it even before he'd known how dizzy Steve was over him. He worked so hard, cared so deeply... and God he loved the man so much.
It helped, there in the almost-dark as he wrestled with his mind. Having Laney and Peter there with him, snoring quietly as they snuggled safely under the covers, kept his thoughts from turning too dark. He loved them as much as they loved him, something that he knew anchored him and kept him centered. And even though he'd made mistakes, even though he could have been
Thank Christ he froze instead of jumping, even if he'd done it with the water bottle at his mouth. He probably looked a damn fool but the genius didn't pull away - that was the important part. It was hard to try and keep his eyes from going wide while swallowing enough water to keep from choking
"Time out! No. Just... no. I trained that out of you, Steven. There is no 'the' - it's just Google."
"I ain't sure this is even dancin' at all. I think your game and your little sensor thing might be confused."
Tony didn't want that many souls on his conscience. His hands were bloody enough as it was. But if things didn't change and Carol didn't make the call... he would be the one to tell FRIDAY to do it. All he could do was pray he wouldn't have to.
"No! No no no. I don't want to hear this. I don't need to hear this and I don't want to. Neither of you has so much as kissed a girl. Or boy. Person of non-binary or indeterminate gender?" He'd never pressed either of them about their sexuality and wasn't willing to really hazard a guess either way. They knew he'd be fine with whatever way they chose to define themselves, and he had absolutely no interest in knowing the finer details of their love lives. That's what Steve was for. "Don't ruin this for me, my dearest of sons. Otherwise I will find another to leave my vast fortunes to."
Carol was the first to lower her arms, shoulders rolling back as she prepared herself for the meeting. Not that it was their first - she'd been the point of contact for all the meetings involving the Rogue's and the possibility of them coming back to the Avengers. There was still tension in her frame, and Rhodey was going to break his back again if he didn't loosen up and stand down at least a little.
that we're all afraid of a teammate gettin' hurt or killed, or that a bystander might pay the price for our mistakes. We're always afraid of what might happen if we aren't enough to stop the bad guy. And they don't get much badder than the guys we fought today. So yeah, Peter. I was scared and I'll bet my suit that everyone else was too."
There are a few other members who are considered an auxiliary to the team instead of being fully active members. While they will train with the New Avengers and be called up on if their specific skill sets will be helpful, they are not expected to join every battle. So far the list of these individuals includes:
They bickered about cleaning supplies while Steve finished cleaning up and I tried to blend in with the sofa I was sitting on. Steve seems to have a particular hatred of Swiffers, so I wisely kept my appreciation of them to myself. I have a feeling I would have been in for quite a lecture if I hadn't, and there were too many questions that needed to be asked first. Maybe it took me a little while to get my courage back since they are a fairly intimidating pair, but I got there eventually.
God, it was like watching Rose and Matthew find each other all over again. He wasn't sure if he hoped Peggy was smitten too or if he hoped Winter had just imprinted on her temporarily, like a murderous duckling.
Probably he wouldn't get to be Captain America, but lately he hadn't much wanted to be anyway. The shine had dulled since the moment he'd seen a shield just like his slice into the arc reactor.
weapons party'," he called out, noting that none of them seemed very regretful or impressed by him. "I would have suited up for the occasion. Right now you've got me at a disadvantage."
It all made him miss his own team with a fierce, unrelenting ache. He'd tried to hide it from Tony, but he was pretty sure his fella saw right through him. He was good enough not to say anything though, and he never brought up the way Steve had taken to turning the device Shellhead and Lokes had given to him over and over in his fingers before bed. He wanted to see them again, wanted to introduce them all to the family he and Tony had built... but he was afraid.
"I'm not talking about Loki, asshole." Steve just grinned at him, then pressed a light kiss to his jaw.
Though he did wish T'Challa and the Dora Milaje had chosen their building as well. Those dames had the best stories, and the King himself had the kind of wry humor that he appreciated very much.
"Spider-Man and Maverick are ready for new orders, Captain Marvel. Platypus, you wanna come help me blow shit up?"
They hadn't talked about it, but he knew Tony was dealing with something similar. Getting out of bed in the morning had them both grimacing and gingerly stretching their muscles. There were moments when Tony's gaze went unfocused, and then his lover would go silent and still for long periods of time. It was like he would get lost for a little while, and when he came back he was tactile and demanding,  like he needed Steve to prove that it was real. Tony also had headaches daily, and sometimes couldn't do much more than stumble from the bed to the couch to lay down there instead.
"Fuck. We talked about your idea of 'drastic action' and I thought we agreed that we were gonna put the kibosh on that until you were old enough to be held liable for your own messes?"
There's a brief period of time when Tony's personal space is being invaded by two people at a party that he is definitely not comfortable with. It doesn't become anything more/worse, but I wanted to let you all know just in case anyone finds such mentions triggering. It happens in the third section of this chapter if anyone needs to skip to the end of it or skim or whatever.
So honestly, until things sort of settle a little, I probably will not be in the right headspace to write the fight.
mind? The one that violated Tony? 'Cause I still don't get why she gets a pass." The mention of Wanda made him flinch back, and he gripped the amulet Steve had given to him through his shirt. It was supposed to stop anyone from invading his mind, was supposed to protect him... but he wasn't sure he wanted to test that. Probably he wouldn't have to though, not from the way Steve's hands were clenched at his sides.
So going to their world wouldn't be the end of his. It would make Steve happy, would make his kids and the New Avengers and the Defenders happy. Everyone would be thrilled and the adults would probably be making merry long into the night. He might even enjoy himself if he could just loosen the fuck up and get over his stupid fears. It was just that they felt like a team, like family. Tony was even pretty sure none of them would leave him to die in an icy bunker, which was new. New and
Life had other ideas though, because suddenly Tony's expression went pinched and unhappy. Another problem had sprung up and he resisted the urge to sigh. He was
It felt like family, the same way Rhodey, Pep and his boys made him feel. Best of all he was snuggled up to Steve while it was happening. The first time he yawned, the blond softie took his plate and set it aside before grabbing the afghan off the back of the couch and to wrap  around them both. He was warm and comfortable with his head tucked under Steve’s chin and his friend’s voices soothing him to sleep in the background.
the kid in his presence. On the other hand, that order had been given when he was still delirious with pain and reeling from betrayal. Maybe he hadn't reversed it, but Tony could be a stubborn asshole about stuff like that. And maybe Peter was convinced that he'd failed, but Tony was probably just as convinced that he'd been the one to fuck everything up.
It was enough to make him laugh, though it didn't last long. Laughing hurt, and it quickly trailed off into a wheezing groan.
So my brain has mostly been eaten by that monster, and I haven't had a lot of time to give to this. I have a lot of stories left in this universe, to be honest, but they will come very slowly and irregularly.
"I don't know. Fri would probably know if you're real or not, but I don't... I'm not ready for you to go yet. Besides, maybe I've slipped so far that I'd imagine her seeing you too. I'm not allowed to be that kind of delusional,
Captain America could make everything better. Tony could live with his hero sneering at him and making the same cruel remarks as his dad if it meant that Howard himself would be happier. He had still loved the man then, loved him with the uncomplicated fierceness of a child. All he had wanted was for his dad to be happy, because if Howard was happy... maybe someday Tony would show him a design and Howard would smile at him like he did in those old pictures.
"Not tonight. Sometimes after a big fight I... don't." He was exhausted physically, but his brain was still running in overdrive, still demanding he try and figure out how to be better next time. If he
Sam was the one who ended up putting a stop to things. Maybe Pepper thought Rogers had taken enough punishment or maybe she was ready for them all to leave and hopefully
. He'd kept that quiet and didn't think much about it, because that was even less of a possibility. Going to look for it would only end in him bloody and bruised in some back alley and Buck being ashamed of him. So there wasn't gonna be a fella or a dame, no kids or even a dog. It was gonna be him all alone at the end, and that was just the way things were. Hadn't stopped him from dreaming sometimes, but he'd never really expected it to change.
"Alas, I have oodles of work waiting for me. We're getting close to a couple major breakthroughs at SI." Usually that was all he would give, because he didn't think Cap would be interested. Bruce might be though, and he did still have Cap's full attention. "I've got a couple different solutions from R&D that I need to play with - and I'd still love for you to come play with me, Brucie - to see which has the most potential. Clean energy is only a few 'eureka' moments away and I didn't need a damned Tesseract to get there. Loki and Fury can both suck it." Tony was pretty sure that was another laugh Captain America was hiding behind one hand. It was pretty much the best day ever, and he definitely needed to get the fuck out of there. "Hope to see you in a couple hours Bruce. If you bring anything but coffee into my workshop I will have to ban you. Later Cap."
"You can't even get drunk. Why the hell would I give you any of my beer?"  Rhodes' shoulder bumped playfully into his while he entered, another small smile on his face. "Though I am willing to hand one over for your induction."
"I do. So let's get this show on the road. Will you go grab the present while I get the kids? Grab the gifts from the Avengers, Rhodey and Pep too please."
You were always meant to be mine. This was always meant to be; this fight, this moment. Your lover, your children... all of it has led you here. Even the Sacrifice of JARVIS was destined.
"I'm not sure I care what you think. No, wait - I am sure. And the answer is… I don't. Not even a little. Any other criticisms you'd like to deliver so I can file them under 'I don't give a flying fuck'?" Rogers knew he'd misstepped - Tony could read that in the brief grimace that crossed his face. Once he would have felt bad about it, would have hurried to either justify or change his behavior so the man wouldn’t do something horrifying like apologize. But that had been then, back when he had thought they were
At least Cap wasn't watching him with a dropped jaw and flushed cheeks anymore. Fuck, he had managed to embarrass Captain America. The Man With a Plan had just been forced to watch him shake his ass and whip hair that he didn't even have, and Howard's fucking ghost was going to break through the door at any second to murder him.
"I don't want to carry the guilt of keeping you away from them. I don't want to be that person." Tony looked so sincere, so heartbreakingly honest, that Steve went and fell in love with him all over again. It was sort of funny how often that happened.
Steve had gone to his old world a few dozen times and he had always, always come home. This wasn't like the land of the Fairies - they wouldn't be snatched away never to return. Probably. And Harley and Peter were really looking forward to the visit. He didn't want to disappoint them or give them a reason to tag-team him. They were a handful separately, but now that they'd decided they were siblings and should stick together? Chaos. Pure and utter chaos.
"Just to draw or maybe watch a movie." He could have done both those things in his own room, and Tony had a feeling Captain America was upset he was going to be left behind. Not like it was his fault - the man out of time had been invited along. It wasn't Tony's problem if he didn't want to come let loose because he had a stick up his ass or whatever his problem was. "Thanks for the invite, but you go ahead Clint. Have a fun time. You too, Tony."
A more controversial element is the inclusion of 'Junior Members'. Several teens have joined the superhero team, though Lt. Col. Rhodes has assured us that they will not be part of any major fight. These Junior Members will train with the New Avengers and may be called on to assist with minor altercations or be allowed to observe situations where no true threat is expected. To protect these assumed minors, their true names will not be made public, and they will only be known as their aliases. Those Junior Members are:
"It's the Infinity Stones. Gems. Whatever the fuck. They don't follow the rules of science or magic, so at least everyone on the GPS team is equally annoyed. The 'why' is because the Stones like my Tiny Adorable Steve, so they do what they do and make sure the timeline he lives in here is, as my little physicist states, 'synced up' with the timeline there. It will break your brain if you try to think about it, my bio-blossom. If you still want to help us puzzle it out you're more than welcome to come to the meetings. They involve lots of tears and screaming into the void."
"Any reason I'm not gettin' a real one?" Tony froze, and an apology was immediately on his tongue. Before he could actually say anything though, the genius was on the move. He just about died when Tony wrapped him up in a fierce hug, doing his damnedest
"Wouldn't dare, you'd disembowel me in a way so impressive Nat would be asking you for murder tips. Anyway. Now that you have stamped the plans with your seal of approval, I'm going to call my construction crew. I'm thinking we'll start with the common floor and the one where the gym will be so I can pitch those to the team and see what they think."
He mostly chalked it up to Steve not realizing that these days people wouldn’t just assume they were friends. It had been different back in the day, when as long as you weren’t kissing guys in front of anyone people were happy to assume men were only interested in women. Steve was just… just still not completely adjusted to modern culture.
. Even after she did everything she could to intimidate and terrify him every time he ventured to the compound. He could understand the way Rogers had picked Bucky over him even if it stung. Having Rogers pick
They had hoped... Strange had said that the two men had been... possessed or something by some of the Infinity Stones. The specifics were so shrouded in magical bullshit terminology that he got the gist of it while missing the finer points. When Tony woke up he would make Loki explain it to him.
"Fri says we're needed home ASAP," Tony told him without preamble once he was close enough. "She says it's nothing bad, but she won't give me details either. This better not be a dirty trick to get me to leave without Peter and Harley." He couldn't hear FRIDAY's answer since the nanotech she was using to communicate was linked directly to Tony, so he had to watch his lover and guess what it was. Didn't work so good, mostly because Tony refused to give anything away. "I mean it, young lady," Tony said after a while. "If there's nothing there I'm going to ground you."
Winter stared at him for long, silent moments, then turned his eyes to Natalia. He barked something that sounded harsh and unforgiving in Russian, but both deadly assassins had the ghost of a smile on their faces, so. Steve had no freaking clue. She answered in the same language, and boy he should have hopped on learning that one. French and German were swell, but he'd give his right eye to know what the two were saying to each other.
"If you were anyone else, Steven, I would rip your heart from your chest and present it to him on a platter. I'll give you the chance to
and rolled over to bury his face in Steve's pillow... only for his left shoulder to spasm painfully and begin to ache. He swore and shifted onto his back again, trying to figure out what the fuck he'd done to his arm.
This is so late getting up because I got huge news!! I for sure got a new full-time job, and it happens to be in an elementary school in the good ol' US of A - things here are Not Okay, but us common folk have to keep on trucking despite the shit show going on. The school year is about to start, and they hired us so late that we've been scrambling to get set up. For me that included buying new clothes, because I am no longer allowed to dress like a slob six days out of seven. Shopping is so fucking time consuming, omg.
"No," he whispered, flinching back from the green light sparking to life in one corner of the common room. Tony's attention was drawn to him immediately. Before he could even blink he'd been dragged into one of Tony's arms, the other outstretched and waiting for one of the gauntlets. "Tony--"
Not with the way his baby girl was already in the classic Iron Man pose - she was ready to take aim and fire. He had a feeling Steve was there too.
"Hello, little one." His voice was so close to being Bucky's while still being so different, and fuck he had to stop looking for things like that! It was just as bad as looking for Tony in Shellhead and vice versa. Somehow he thought Winter would be a lot less forgiving than either Stark was about it. "You're a pretty thing." There wasn't even a hint of Brooklyn in the words, but the Russian accent was... understandable, he guessed. Those uncompromising eyes flicked his way, and he offered another small smile. "You're Steve Rogers."
While Pep gave a 'sorry' full of laughter, Steve swayed gently into his side. Both things in combination killed that tiny kernel of genuine hurt he otherwise would have harbored and let fester
Tony also had the public mostly on his side for the first time in his adult life. The media too, except for the few outlets that would always hate him for his days of partying or his refusal to make weapons for the military anymore. His old Board of Directors, the one put together by Stane, had largely retired or revised their opinion of him. While he still hated going to those meetings, the fresh faces and more relaxed attitude meant he didn't actively avoid going to them either. The R&D department was rocking it, JARVIS had joined several online communities for the express purpose of trolling the members, and what happened in New York City largely had Congress backing the fuck off.
"Yeah yeah. You're a big ol' smarty pants, but you get that from your dad - me dad, not Tiny Adorable Dad - so I wouldn't be so smug about it. This is really killing my dramatic reveal, so fuck it. Just go ahead and take off your blindfolds."
The mere thought of that was almost intoxicating. He immediately abandoned Nat's comic and got out a fresh sheet of paper, one he fully intended to keep to himself. Tony had already gone back to his own work, so there was little chance of him snooping. JARVIS would be able to read it, but Steve was pretty sure the AI would keep it to himself. The next time Dum-E wheeled over, he didn't take the ball to throw again, but patted the 'bot on the claw instead.
“No. I can… Shellhead – my world’s Tony Stark – worked with that Loki ta find a way I could go back and visit.” Panic, dark and shameful and so heavy it could crush him with ease briefly choked him. His
"Hey there cutie. What's a girl like you during a place like this?" She lifted a paw and settled it on his knee, drawing out a soft chuckle. "What's her name?"
The world and the universe moved around them, bringing new friends and fresh grief. Family was found and sometimes lost, battles were fought and most of the time the Defenders were able to save the day. Tony fiddled with his robots and Steve puttered with his paints; they only donned their armor as a last resort. Things changed as much as they didn't, and they were happy more often than they weren't.
"Sir, Captain Rogers is demanding he and the rogue Avengers be allowed to come and, in his words, save you."
"No. I hate to disappoint you, but he can barely handle the notion that he's now a free man. Getting him to speak anything but Russian or German is a struggle on even his best days. He's still paranoid and volatile enough that he's staying in Hulk's playroom. Winter is... he may be coping well considering his condition, but I don't think throwing the life he used to have in his face would help him any."
But then, evil Jedi was the one Captain Marvel had been warned was the most dangerous of Thanos' remaining Children.
"He's better than he was," she told him quietly. Her gaze was on something he couldn't see a million miles away. "Natalia and I tracked him down, but we've done so before as well. Without Loki he would have slipped through our fingers again and be lost to the wind."
It would not be wise, and while we have as long as we need we do not have forever. Space and Time are near. No, they are--
"I'd hate you if I didn't love you so much. Please, please don't let them paint it red, white and blue. Please. If you do I'll never, ever, ever make you any upgrades ever again."
It took a few minutes before she stopped sniffing at the offering on the ground between them and actually ate it. The second went down the hatch faster, but she balked when he got his hand too close to her with the third piece. It was a slow, cautious dance the two of them were doing, but Steve was pretty sure it would be worth it.
somebody, somebody who would let her chat with squirrels and make sure she had more to wear than jeans that were more holes than fabric. Somebody to patch up all the little scratches she wore like badges of honor, and who would help her figure out if her ability began and ended with her ability to communicate. He and Tony had raised several kids who had turned out pretty damn well - there wasn't any reason that 'somebody' couldn't be the two of them, so long as Tony agreed.
. Either way, she didn't advance when Sam took a step forward, though Tony was pretty sure she'd be ready to throw down if needs be. He was ready for things to get even messier even if she'd relaxed, but to his surprise Steve wasn't quite as lost in fury as his actions suggested. Once Sam was almost in punching range himself, Steve got off Rogers in one fluid motion, and he didn't look back once while stalking back to Tony's side.
Steve was still in the shower when he ventured into the living area of their floor. Most of the Defenders were nowhere to be found, though there was a mystic cloak floating around and poking at their things. Lokes was indeed at the stove, still in his loose linen sleep clothes and his hair left loose. Shellhead was plastered against his back in only a pair of sleeping pants, because the two of them were disgustingly in love. Not that he had room to talk, not when he did the same thing to Steve, but still. He didn't really need the visual of another him cuddling up to
"You've still stuck it out with me for years - close to decades, actually. So clearly I'm not that terrible."
"Except apparently when you're sneaking your date into the tower. What are they going to think, huh?"
"The kids would love to have you there, Cap. You could put on the spangles and teach them life lessons," he would say while grinning. Steve strongly suspected Tony had found out about the PSA's Fury had forced him to record.
The compound was never really dark, not when parts of the facility ran 24/7 in an effort to support the New Avengers Initiative. In the aftermath of the battle with the Black Order that was doubly true. Even though it was well into the night, the grounds were still a hive of activity, enough light and noise going on in the courtyard that both trickled through the curtains that were supposed to cancel them out.
"There we go girl. One of your brothers is gonna come pick us up and after that we're gonna get you feeling so much better. That's right sweetheart... we're goin' home." The dog gave a sigh that - to his ears - sounded pretty damn happy. She pressed her head a little harder into his stomach and settled one paw on his leg, tail thumping away as he carefully scratched her side.
Despite that, he couldn't make his crush go away. So even now that his body felt more like 'Steve' than 'Captain America', even now that he could like another fella without ending up broken and bloody for it... well.
"Thanks Tony." He got another kiss to his cheek, this one a smacking smooch that was more playful than anything. "But know that ya really are settin' up a revolvin' door. They're all gonna show up whenever the hell they want now."
They'd had only a handful of encounters where things had gone even half as well. Tony should run away before he ruined it, but... he also never wanted it to end.
“I’m not hurting his anything. He and Clint just haven’t made up yet. Now get away from Steve before I have to hose you down, Dum-E. That stuff is… violently purple and I find it offensive.”
"And ya beat it all ta hell before ya left him bleedin' out, didn't ya? Put your shield through his heart hard enough ta make all that metal buckle. What the hell do ya think was under there, ya stupid fuck? That was flesh and blood underneath and ya left without even lookin' back. Not once - didn't even hesitate. Gotta say, if the Bucky I know is anythin' like the one ya had as a friend... he's gotta be awful ashamed-a ya, and your ma would tan your goddamned hide. Since she ain't here ta do it, I'm happy ta step in."
“No,” he says again, more calmly. “It— It’s good for me. The fighting. It helps keep my mind off things. And it’s never been a problem before. During the war, I mean. Hitler didn’t exactly leave room for sick days.”
The shirt slips through fingers gone suddenly lax. Extremis goes odd for a second, a torrent of hexadecimal numbers streaming across your mind, cataloguing every minute shift in shade and apparent hue as the fabric slithers and folds beneath the shadow of your hands.
Tony drags his hands through his hair and spins in place, a reeling circle of frustration. “Well, I would hope not, but then, I never imagined you’d be insane enough to come here in the first place, so clearly my judgement isn’t a reliable metric!”
Iron Man finishes and makes to pull back, but Steve’s fingers close over his wrist, and this time, Steve doesn’t let go.
“Serum,” Steve says simply. “Come on,” and he pulls on Iron Man’s arm until Iron Man climbs back into bed. Steve releases his wrist in favor of wrapping his entire arm around Iron Man’s waist. The metal is cool against his skin, but not unpleasantly so. He tugs, pulling Iron Man closer.
“I liked it,” Steve says again, because Iron Man sounds like he could use the reassurance. “Like it when you’re you, too. But it was… I think it helped, at least a little.” A memory pops into his head: Tony in the kitchen, eyes blue-rimmed with fatigue but still smiling, still so willing to give Steve his time, to help him makes sense of things. “Tony was telling me a few weeks ago, actually. About what it’s called, when something isn’t real but still works, even if you know about it. It’s like that, I think. You and Tony. The placebo effect.”
Rogers sits up a little straighter, plants his feet more firmly. Tony’s never really been one for the wheeling and dealing side of corporate life, but he knows enough to recognize the posture: the pleasantries are over. Now it’s time for business. Which is good, he reminds himself as something twists in his stomach. Which is what he
You are lying on your back in a bed three thousand miles away from your home. You are a fugitive, again, running down the hours on a ticking clock. Your brain is a weapon and you no longer hold the trigger. You are your only hope.
A memory: Steve’s arms folded, his mouth a thin and unrelenting line, his body angled away from you like you carried something contagious.
“Oh!” Tony laughed and ducked his head, looking uncharacteristically sheepish. “I may have… taken care of the problem. Pre-emptively, you understand.”
A reminder, though, that we are now no longer on regular updates. The next chapter will be up when it's done, and while I am working on it diligently, I cannot predict to any degree of certainty how soon that may be. Hopefully before the end of the month. Thanks as always for reading, and most especially to those who take the time to leave feedback! <3
And then his hand was sliding, tractionless, across the top of the wardrobe door, his foot kicking up from where it was braced at the bottom, the other crumpling beneath him, and he was falling, falling, god
He comes face to face with Tony only once since the beginning of his cycle, and then entirely by accident.
Tony’s face twists in concern. “You okay, Cap? You sound a little…” He sets his mug down on the counter and takes a few steps closer—too close by far. Steve is still as a statue, hardly daring to breathe.
Everything you’ve done across the years has led you to this point. But it wasn’t always fixed. It wasn’t always
The way Steve’s insides throb at the mere suggestion should more than answer the question, but Iron Man can’t know that, can he, so Steve wets his lips and breathes his answer into the dark.
Can’t deal with the way Rogers was looking at him. With the way the history between them rises up to choke him with every breath.
“How can you not be sure?” Steve’s voice cracked on the question. “Either you feel it, or you don’t.”
He takes another breath. “That’s what it’s like most of the time. But every three or four months… The feelings come back. All of them. More than is, uh, usual. For most people. It can be a little overwhelming.”
Except that he can’t help but notice, as the seconds drag on, just how quiet it is. No shifting sheets, no sounds of another person's breathing. No faucets running or movement from the bathroom. No footsteps.
Steve tells him to shut up. Which feels good, a little, though it doesn’t do much to soothe the chafed-skin burn where your recent quarrel has rubbed you raw.
Steve feels a brief pulse of guilt, followed an instant later by an even stronger pulse of… something else. He resists the urge to adjust his pants.
“Hey, shh. None of that—” and then there are two hands running up his thighs and rubbing at his hips—two warm,
“More,” is all Steve says. His tongue feels heavy in his mouth. The slow, crackling friction as Iron Man moves inside him blunts his wits, sets his nerves buzzing with energy. He’s so close to what he’s been seeking, close and getting closer by the moment. The image pushes its way to the forefront of his consciousness, a dark-haired figure leaning in over him, the clench and shift of his muscles as he moves. He thinks of hips pistoning, hard and fast and relentless, Tony using him to take what he needs—what they
Steve lets out a garbled noise of pain, tilting his head back, trying to follow the pressure. There is so little resistance left in him these days where Tony is concerned. He wonders if that’s what it means to be entirely—finally—obsolete. The past bowed and broken beneath the relentless demands of the future.
As he speaks, Steve can feel him moving, feel his weight shifting across the mattress and finally lifting entirely.
“Tony,” Rogers says, and there’s pain in his voice now. This is it. This is what he wanted to hear before, on the phone call, everything he wanted and everything Rogers refused to give him and now it’s too late, it’s all too fucking
“Okay,” he says, hardly aware of who he’s saying it to. It doesn’t matter. Either way he doesn’t have the will left in him to refuse.
“You know,” Iron Man says, and his voice might almost be called conversational if not for a certain hoarseness, “I was planning on asking for lube, but you don’t actually need it, do you?”
Now, he rolls his shoulders back as he settles more comfortably into the chair, feeling a hum of pleasurable anticipation.
And god, the confidence in his voice, the smug and unwavering certainty. You splay your fingers to keep them from balling into fists. Not even a shadow of a doubt, when he should be calling everything that’s ever between you into question. You want to take that terrible, suffocating faith and rip it to shreds, except you thought you’d already done that. Can’t he see you’re nothing,
“Oh,” he says, “yeah. I just… had a couple of ideas about some new training exercises I wanted to run by you.”
Beside her, Giant Man chokes on a mouthful of coffee. Tony gives him a half-ironic salute with his own coffee mug, and slides Steve a triumphant glance when Giant Man blushes even further.
— And sure, so maybe Tony had crossed his mind once or twice—purely by accident!—during one of his rare self-care sessions, but that was understandable, right? The man was practically synonymous with sex—he was almost more famous for it than he was for being Iron Man, and anyway Steve had always pictured him with women, so it wasn’t like—
Steve flaps his bound arms for a moment or two, struggling to regain his equilibrium, then slowly, agonizingly shuffles around on his knees. Tony half-guides, half-hauls him across the floor, stopping before the massive chrome and glass desk.
weren’t—” You rake your hands through your hair. “She was there, and everything was so— and I just—” It sounds like you’re making excuses, and you’re not, there are no excuses, you
“So, uh,” Iron Man says after a moment. “Not heat, but some kind of—of mating cycle? For lack of a better term?”
So here we are, aggressively canon-compliant up to the end of CACW and then to hell with canon, we’re gonna solve this shit.
So now your Argonauts, the one-and-a-quarter-billion dollar global defense system you’ve spent the past six weeks of your life perfecting, are on a rampage and you’re racing from hotspot to hotspot across the globe thinking you might actually be kind of a lousy futurist, because you really should have seen this coming.
You look back at her at that. “Then why—?” The thought crosses your mind that maybe this, in some convoluted way, was Maya’s revenge. For putting her away. For breaking her out again. Steve accused you, during your last fight, of playing god. You guess this is one way to pull down a god.
And just like that all your visions of the future go up in smoke. It is so strong, even now, even after everything: the drive that has propelled you through most of your adult life.
“Fools!” the villain screeches from where he hovers fifteen feet above a brightly lit billboard. “Do you think to stand against me? All shall fall before the might of Rostro the Puppeteer!”
It was just this way Tony had sometimes of needling a fellow, poking and prodding at his weak points, wriggling his way under Steve’s skin with a barbed quip—
he feels overloaded with pleasure. He’s moving faster now, driving himself down harder as some bright elsewhere looms on the horizon, great and golden and burning, and he’s running towards it or maybe he’s running away but either way it’s getting closer, closer, close—
“You can’t know that,” Steve argues as you step back, but he sounds, for the first time, uncertain. His eyes sweep restlessly back and forth across your face, like it’s a book he’s struggling to read.
.” Steve makes another grab and this time manages to secure Iron Man’s upper arm. His palms are slick with sweat but he just holds on all the tighter. Iron Man’s muscles bunch as he shifts forward and Steve whines as the image of Tony kneeling over him enters his mind, the way his biceps would shift and cord as he braced himself, driving into Steve hard and fast—
In a way, it’s an odd thing to fixate on. As if it matters who started it, as if it’s anything more than trivia. You still did what you did. There’s no chain of causality that could free you from that truth—no possible circumstance that could scrub away the stain.
“Oh,” Steve says around a pang of loss, “no, hey, you don’t have to—” He reaches out for Iron Man’s shoulder but, blind as he is, completely misjudges the distance and the resulting force of his own movement. Iron Man lets out an
Steve makes a throaty, desperate sound that might have been humiliating if he had enough brainpower left to process it. Then he’s rising on his knees, shoving his jeans down his hips, and Iron Man is helping him, bracing him as he sits back and kicks them the rest of the way off.
what I choose? What if I choose us?” His voice is fierce. “What if I choose working together and not letting it tear us apart, no matter what? What about that, Tony?”
He wonders if Rogers realizes just how manipulative he’s being—if he’s doing it on purpose, or if it just comes naturally to him, like breathing.
Wanted to get this one out for my birthday, in hopes that any comments and kudos might distract me from the chill hand of the reaper. Hope you all enjoyed the boinking and the cuddling and general softness. Next time, we have… not that. Whoooooo’s excited for actions to have consequences??? *jazz hands*
He cleans off his hands and reaches for his tablet. The video he opens is one he’s seen before. He was curious about the twenty-first century’s idea of a blue movie and spent a few instructive hours scrolling through sites with a surplus of Xs in the title. He’s never been a particularly good judge of what he’ll find arousing when the impulse returns, but he bookmarked this particular video anyway. There was something natural about it he failed to find in most of the others he’s seen. The two women featured seemed like they actually liked each other, like they were comfortable and having a good time. The blonde reminded him a little of Peggy. Not Peggy as he knew her, lean and toughened by war, but Peggy as she might have been in happier times. Less wary. Softer at the edges.
“Because I hope you know…” Iron Man shuffles his feet and clears his throat in a burst of static. “If you ever need to talk, I’m here. Doesn’t matter the reason.”
Steve’s nearly certain he’s got his own digs, but he doubts they’re all that convenient to Manhattan, judging by the frequency with which he sees his friend around the mansion.
next time: this story continues to earn its unofficial title, "Running With Boners," as Steve continues his trend of angstily popping chubs and then running away. also, there's like, plot development or w/e
Steve has a brief image of ruddy, irritated skin, striping down muscular shoulders, carving across a sharp-cut collarbone, girdling the waist below. Imagines fitting his lips to the weals, soothing the galled flesh with his tongue—the way Iron Man would gasp. Would moan. No one would have done that for him before…
Rogers’ eyes are clear and very, very blue as they hold his. “The Sons of the Great Bear have been carrying out attacks in Symkaria, Latveria, Sokovia—all of them signatory states. But Carnelia—Carnelia still hasn’t signed, has it? Nothing anyone could do. That must’ve been pretty galling.”
“Okay,” Iron Man says, and again, there’s that odd, rallying note to his voice, but this is hardly the time to think what that might mean. The mattress jostles under Iron Man’s weight as he moves. The hand on Steve’s knee slides down the slope of his thigh and back again, and then Iron Man is nudging his other knee aside and settling himself between them. Something cold and metal presses against his leg—Iron Man’s chestplate.
Iron Man gives an uneven laugh. “S-sure you do, tough guy.” His voice is strained. “But that’s no reason not to take it slow, at least to start. Easy does—
Iron Man immediately lifts his hands, and it’s all Steve can do not to whine at the loss of contact.
“So no,” Iron Man continues, voice low and almost in Steve’s ear. “I don’t mind if you’re thinking about Mr. Stark. And in all likelihood, neither would he.”
Despite yourself, you give a watery chuckle. Of course he’s still arguing. Stubborn to the last. You had a good run, didn’t you, while it lasted. There is sweetness here, even in the heart of pain, if you can find it—if you can learn how to grasp it.
A sudden, sharp burst of pressure on the left side of his face. Steve gasps wetly and blinks back startled tears.
After a moment, Iron Man says, gentle but firm, “You’re going to have to give me more than that, buddy.”
“You don’t actually believe that, do you?” Rogers asks abruptly. “About the leader being more important than their team?”
“Well, it’s not like it happened in a vacuum, did it?” you say, fighting to keep the tremors from your voice. “Things have been going downhill for months. You told me I was like a stranger to you, do you remember that? For god’s sake, you wouldn’t even
Steve lets out a hoarse laugh. It’s better than the alternative, which would be sobbing. “Yeah,” he says.
The word lances like a knife through your heart, but you force yourself to stop, to look up and meet his earnest blue gaze. You take a breath. Open your mouth, and tell him…
Steve shrugs. “Sometimes, if I got lucky, my leave would come up at the right time, but for the most part. It’s under control. I’m used to taking care of myself.”
—relief and joy writ plain on his face for anyone to read. And you remember the grief that welled in you then, tar-black and so thick you thought you could choke.
As for any remaining tension between them, well. He cares about Iron Man and values his friendship, and he knows—and whatever doubts he may have entertained before, the certainty of this thought shines like a beacon—he
Across from you, Steve sits like a statue. His face is blank; only by the minutest motions of his chest can you tell he’s even still breathing.
“Hey, easy there, fella.” Steve’s laughing, just a little. He can’t help it. It warms him, hearing how much Iron Man cares, how important Steve’s well-being is to him. How did Steve ever doubt him? How could he ever have imagined, even for a moment, that Iron Man would just… just
He imagines Tony gazing up at him, the dark wells of his eyes—imagines pushing him back, the slick pop as the seal of his mouth breaks loose from Steve’s skin—imagines Tony on his knees, supplicant, like a pilgrim seeking benediction, and no words at all on his lips because none are needed, it’s all there, in his eyes—
He’d fantasized about it sometimes, meeting Monaghan in the nebulous storybook future of “after the war.” A chance encounter in a New York street, and Steve would smile and say, “Let me buy you a drink,” and he’d explain, that it hadn’t been him, and maybe even—on his bolder nights—he might say, “I’m sorry that happened to you,” and then—
A tingle darts down Steve’s spine, radiating out across his shoulders, into his belly, down to his toes—nerves, shot through with no small amount of anticipation.
There are fingers dragging over his abused nipples, hands kneading his ass and jerking his cock—too many hands, there must be someone else here, and so it doesn’t surprise him at all when—
Steve wipes his forehead with the back of his hand. It comes away damp. “I’ll be sure to do that. I’ll, uh. Catch you later, then.”
“You reckless, self-righteous—” He takes in a breath. He won’t waste time trying to name all the things Steve Rogers is. There aren’t enough words to cover them anyway. “What the fuck were you thinking, coming here? Were you thinking at all? Is there a brain in that muscle-bound head of yours? How—”
And it’s fine, isn’t it, because Steve’s post-serum physiology has more than its fair share of quirks, and anyway this is
The helmeted head turns, fractionally, his way, and Steve realizes he’s been caught staring. He looks hastily away, staring down at the table. Soon. Soon this will all be over and he can apologize to Iron Man, to T—
