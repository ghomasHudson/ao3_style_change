"Negative. Russians know how to hold their liquor. Ever heard of Russian vodka? One shot of that and you'd be on your ass."
Rhodey sat down in the chair across from Tony. "Same as usual. More training. Thor is a different story, but Wanda's powers were created in a lab. By HYDRA. From a stone. And so were Vision's, but he's...a robot? I tell you man, when we were kids I never thought our world was gonna be this strange."
Tony hesitated. How was he supposed to tell this Natasha her cute little brother was an assassin from HYDRA who had tried to murder them and was currently AWOL? He decided not to mention it; some things she didn’t need to know. “Something like that,” he muttered instead.
"No. I just remember waking up in bed with Steve with flashes of memories from here. I don't know what I was doing here. This is...this is my workshop, yeah? Was I working on a project?"
“You both had shitty fathers. That’s something that connected my dads together, knowing they shared that kind of hurt and understood what it’s like to carry the scars of emotional abuse. My Steve didn’t judge my Tony for that. And trust me, my Steve is opinionated and stubborn and is
“Okay. So here’s the plan. Steve’s currently hitting him in the face with his shield. I’m gonna cut his hand off, and then he won’t have the gauntlet. Thor, can your hammer smash that gauntlet and the stone?”
"Yep," he said, pouring the mix into the pan. He turned to say good morning to his daughter. "What are you wearing?" he asked her. "Is that...do schools really let kids wear that?"
Thor opened his mouth to argue but the older Natasha deftly stepped in between them. “Okay boys, you can argue about this later. We need to focus on the mission at hand right now, and that’s stopping Thanos before he gets all these stones.”
She saw Steve grit his teeth as he tried to attack Thanos and was swatted out of the way, his back hitting the ground hard. He grunted in pain. Tony stuck his hand out to help Steve up, patting him on the back as he did so. “You okay, Cap?” he asked.
Steve nodded along with Clint and the older Natasha. Vision simply turned to Wanda, who let her crimson magic come out to play. Thor waved his hammer Mjolnir in the air, and then they were off to fight the alien.
The Incident: While making a weapons demonstration for the Jericho Missile in Afghanistan, Tony was blown up by his own weapons and held hostage by Afghan war criminals. His heart was kept alive by a battery and then later with the Arc Reactor, built by Tony himself. While held prisoner, he built his first Iron Man suit and escaped. He later discovered business partner and close family friend Obadiah Stane purposely set up his kidnapping and was trying to take over his company. He stole the Iron Man suit idea, tried to kill Tony, and was taken down in an epic fight that turned Tony into a hero instead of the Merchant of Death.
The Incident: She met Bucky Barnes, aka the Winter Soldier, when he was handed over from HYDRA to the Soviets during the Cold War. He helped train the girls in the Red Room and was tortured and his mind manipulated in the process. He and a young Natasha fell in love and were punished for it with sterilisation. After he completed his missions, they were going to put Bucky back on ice until he was needed again. His last act before being frozen was breaking Natasha out. She ran away, got married to a crime lord in order to survive, killed and stole her way through Russia and the US, an assassin for hire, until Agent Clint Barton, sent to kill her for her crimes, chose to take her in and make her an agent instead.
“Well, it came from her ancestors, and it was written down, but yes. Some still believe it’s true. But I’ve had these stones in my shop for years, and far as I know they don’t hold any real power.”
"Okay, well that answered my next question about whether or not you and Pepper were ever a thing in that other universe. You weren't, right?"
The tension between Steve and Tony dissolved then, and he focused back on Clint. "Uh, I think it was from an explosion? You don't really talk about it. It had something to do with your brother."
“They’re from a story my mother read to me when I was younger. They’re called infinity stones. Or sometimes infinity gems. They’re six stones that were created at the beginning of universe that hold immense power to whoever wields them all.”
The personality transplant jarred Tony, but he thought he liked it. Albeit, the fact Steve was so goddamned happy all the time would probably start to grate on his nerves before long, and then they would be back to bickering nonstop like they always did. But still, it was a vast improvement from the holier than thou version he currently had in his home world.
The older Natasha got up from the couch and walked towards the younger version of herself, inspecting her. “I don’t understand,” she said. “Tony, when you and Steve switched universes, the other version switched places with you. How come there are two of me in the same universe?”
Sidenote: the colours associated with the infinity gems/stones vary from comic to comic and are also different in the MCU. In the comics, it’s more common that the reality stone is yellow, however in MCU it’s the red stone (aka the Aether). This means that logically the reality stone should be the one in Knowhere with the Collector, but as I gave the reality stone to Tony & Co. and since at the time of writing this no one knew where the last stone was, I made the last stone be the one Thor gave to the Collector. And on a further note, I didn’t include Dr Strange or the Guardians in this story, so one of these stones is collected by the Avengers and another is collected by Thanos. So don’t hate me because details are inconsistent. Or that I use gem and stone interchangeably because I still have no conceivable idea why MCU felt the need to change it from gem to stone.
"I don't think there's anything left to really tell you all. Just that I really liked that world, and I really want to get back to it. I'm just not the kind of person who could handle living in a world full of superheroes, you know?"
“I want to rule,” he said, like it was simple and easy to follow. “I want to be their gods, and I want my daughters to be my side while I conquer.” He smiled at both of them. “My two girls, side by side. I thought I would never see the day.”
“The twins are dating Crystal Amaquelin and Victor Stone. Then there’s Wade Wilson and Frank Castle.”
“Yeah,” Tony told her. “FRIDAY detecting Thanos entering Earth’s atmosphere. No doubt he knows exactly where we are, so…fighting is going to happen. A lot of it. Do you still want to be patched into my HUD?”
He breathed a sigh of relief. "Good. Because I would hate for movies to be different. It would be tragic if
He braced himself and waited for this figure to make their way to him before sizing the figure up. Tony had to crane his neck upwards to take in the figure. He was a tall alien with purple skin and a weird, deformed looking chin. Tony wasn’t sure what race of alien this creature was supposed to be, or who this even was, and he was slightly terrified. He wasn’t like the other Tony, or the buff Steve he had encountered. He came from a world without magic and without superheroes or aliens or anything mystical whatsoever. He wasn’t sure how to process the idea that the multiverse really existed, and within this multiverse held millions of different universes where the mystical was a normal occurrence.
Thanos sighed. “I’m tired,” he stated. “I wish to retire, to raise my daughters in peace. If I acquire all of the gems, I can, with just the snap of my fingers, erase half the population of the multiverse, so that all of the world’s problems will be fixed in the blink of an eye.”
“Have you ever actually sat down with Steve and had a discussion about his issues with you? I mean, why do you
“Uh huh,” Natasha said, her voice shaky with uncertainty. “It’s what we had to do. It was self-defence. Pierce said stuff like this happens on missions all the time. We did nothing wrong.”
They rode towards the village until the sun rose again. Tony was almost falling asleep on top of Friday, but Steve was still wide awake.
“The message has been delivered,” she confirmed after a moment. “Bucky is currently in the elevator and will be with you in approximately thirty seconds.”
“That is true…” the riding instructor said. “Well, since this is your first time riding by yourself, we’ll go slow. Just watch me, and do everything I do. If you need help with anything, let me know, ok?” The prince nodded and the two men started in their way.
one Avenger with him at all times. Second, he stays on your floor for a month and sees a psychologist
Soon, the elevator stopped and the doors opened. When the two men exited, they saw Tony and another man standing in a room across the hall, deep in discussion. “Is that the doctor?” Bucky asked, whispering so that only Steve could hear him. The genius and the doctor both turned at the sound of the two super-soldiers approaching.
After the class, Tony still had a little time before lunch would be served at noon. He headed to the royal library, searching avidly for a book he read a few years before, about thermonuclear astrophysics. He stopped only when Jarvis called him to go to the dining hall, disappointed because he didn’t find the book he was looking for. It was partly his fault for never putting the books back in the right place. In the afternoon, Tony had more classes before going back to the library, continuing his search for his precious book, finally finding it in the kids’ section, for some reason. He read and studied until he realized it was too late to be in the library, and that Jarvis and Happy were probably looking for him.
“It’s ‘James Roger Stark, Junior’ now. ‘JR’, for short.” The boy grinned, then suddenly stopped as he looked over the genius’s shoulder. Tony turned and moved over slightly so he was shielding the little boy.
“Happy birthday, son,” the king said. Howard looked up from the document he had been reading on his Starkpad, turned off the device when he saw his son, and set it aside.
He lead the hybrid towards the water. The brunette purred when the warm water surrounded him and closed his eyes.
Steve helped him down, since America was such a large horse. Tony said a quiet “thanks”. The blond tied the horses to one of the fences so they couldn’t run away, despite being well-disciplined, but it was better to be safe than sorry. The prince reached out for his instructor’s hand, intertwining their fingers before the blonde could knock on the door. “Stevie, is that you?” A woman’s voice called from inside as soon as Steve knocked. It was possible to hear the sound of the door unlocking, what made the royal wonder how thin the walls were.
“Good morning, Your Highness! You are very lucky that I came in, instead of Jarvis or Their Majesties, otherwise there would be questions about your whereabouts. Now, what would you like to wear today, Prince Anthony?” The prince’s attendant crossed to the wardrobe.
“Hi! Everything’s all set for your lesson!” The riding instructor lead the prince to a wooden structure that was the shape and size of a pony, with a saddle and other equipment laying on the grass next to it. “You’re going to practice getting this horse ready to ride, then climb into the saddle. If that goes well, we’ll try doing the same thing on your horse.”
’ Bucky thought angrily as he walked into the workshop, then stopped. The genius was at his work table, with his arms folding on top, head resting on them, and fast asleep. In front of him was the prosthetic arm that he had been working on.
Bruce blinked and his eyes turned from their usual golden-brown color to green. “Give me a minute,” he growled before turning and walking away.
“Mmm...good morning,” the blond said, his voice thick with sleep. “Did you sleep well, after you came over last night? No nightmares?”
“You’re forgiven. But next time, ask before you try to fix anything, ok? And maybe don’t give me anything dead as a present, yeah? And also stay away from my clothes, maybe?” He petted the super-soldier on the head before turning to the new arm. “We just have to figure out how the arm you have now was attached. Any chance they might have told you?”
Steve turned Tony toward him, wiped his tears away, and gave the other man a gentle hug. “It’s alright,” he said. “I’m glad you told me about this. The first thing we have to do is help you conquer your fear. Maybe if you know more about horses, you’ll stop being scared of them. Our lessons are supposed to be in the afternoons, but I want you to meet me here every morning, too, so we’ll have lessons twice a day. We won’t be riding at first. I’ll just be teaching you about horses. The different breeds, how to take care of them...that kind of thing. Then, once you’re more comfortable around them, we’ll go back to having lessons just in the afternoons so I can teach you how to ride. What do you say, my prince? Do we have a deal?”
The action made the prince wrinkle his nose and shuffle closer to his instructor, but he didn’t wake up. Steve chuckled. ‘
“Oh, for fuck’s sake…” Steve took a deep breath to calm down. “Tony. Listen to me. I’m right here. I would never let anything bad happen to you. Do you trust me?”
“Horses aren’t like dogs. They don’t understand words like ‘stay’,” the riding instructor said. “The next step is grooming her, and making sure she doesn’t have any sores or anything like that. If she does, she isn’t fit for riding. You need to wait until her sores have healed before you saddle her. That’s really important, so you have to do it before every ride, and you can’t ever skip it. Understand?”
Steve stood up and quickly blocked the door before his friend could leave. “You lied to me!” the hybrid whispered angrily. “You said he wasn’t like the other doctors!
“Anthony, go get my son!” Bucky demanded. The billionaire looked between the two super-soldiers. Steve nodded, but internally he was shocked. He had never seen Bucky so protective of somebody that wasn’t him, nor automatically decide that that person was family! Not even Steve got the “family” title, and the two men had known each other almost since babyhood!
“Oh, please, call me Sarah,” she demanded. “Is Stevie doing well in the castle? At first I thought he wouldn’t  adapt very well, but now I see I was completely wrong.”
The genius stretched and yawned, then looked at his worktable. Still laying on the corner was the letter Bucky had written to him that morning. “F.R.I.D.A.Y., translate this for me.”
“Nice one, Rogers,” the business owner said sarcastically. “If he Hulks Out because of this, I’m blaming you,” he said, pointing at the captain.
As Steve and Tony were finishing the chores in the mid-afternoon, they heard a horse galloping toward them. Both men looked up to see a horse and rider quickly approaching Sarah’s home. As the rider got closer, the blond recognized the rider to be one of their neighbors from the farm next door, Peter Parker. The young boy, around ten years old, dismounted from his horse, then reached up and grabbed the box he had been holding as he rode.
” Natasha was shocked. “But she’s so…She has a reputation for sleeping around, then spreading vicious rumors about the men she’s with! Surely the prince knows that and has better judgement than to spend the night with her!”
“I don’t know, but…” The prince was cut off by the vibration of his communicator. He took a few deep breaths to calm down, then double-tapped the top of the device, and a hologram of his childhood friend, Virginia, who now worked as the Stark family reeve, appeared above the bracelet.
“He’s part human, and if you and your minions had any decency, you would treat him like one! I’m taking him somewhere where he’ll be safe and happy and loved.”
“I never said that. I just don’t think your son would like me in that way. We’ve only known each other a few days, and he’s already become my best friend, but I think he likes somebody else.”
“Yeah...that’s not how that works,” Steve said. “Come on, Buck.” He gently pushed his friend off of him. The hybrid retaliated by carefully sinking one of his canines, which was sharp like a cat’s, into the neck he had been hiding his face in, then letting go. He turned toward the doctor and waved back.
are who we turned to. After the check-up, could you see if you can do anything about his…” He sighed, and looked at Steve. “Maybe
He took off the hoodie he was wearing and wrapped it around the hybrid that was shaking from the cold and turned on the car’s heater. The first thing he did when they got inside the Tower was to shove Hydra’s former assassin inside the master bathroom on his private floor.
“I was just getting coffee ready. Sit down,” Sarah gestured to the table. Both of them sat and she carried two more plates to the living room, setting them down, one in front of each. She put a pastry in their plates. “You look so thin, Stevie! Eat something!”
“It’s a boy!” Tony greeted the super-soldier when he was inside with the kid. “Take JR for a minute. I want to get out of my suit.”
press the bit next to her teeth. Once she opens her mouth, slip the bit, and the treat, into her mouth.”
have him in a cell, in the basement. They didn’t see him as a little boy. They didn’t even think of him as
“It’s very nice to meet you, Tony,” she said. She stepped back from the doorway so both of them could pass. Steve whispered in his ear for him to take his shoes off before entering. The house was modest and beautiful. The wood was bare and a fifties-style television rested on the corner of what Tony assumed was a living room.
“Excuse my language,Your Highness, but that’s bullshit! I never heard him talking about anyone else ever since he met you and your, quote, ‘beautiful eyes and royal abs’.”
The former assassin woke up again a few hours later and looked to his left. Tony was there, sitting in a chair, and looking at his Starkpad, but he looked up after a few seconds, when he felt somebody watching him.
“You can’t remember how to write in English?” The younger man shook his head. “Oh, great!” the billionaire said, rolling his eyes. “Remind me to teach you again later, ok?”
“Oh, come on, Rogers! He was a brainwashed assassin for Hydra for seventy years! Who knows what he believes now?! We have to make sure his mind is
“Of course, Captain. Hello, Sergeant Barnes.” The man visibly flinched at his rank. “Welcome to Avengers Tower! My name is F.R.I.D.A.Y. I’m an A.I., an artificial intelligence, built by Tony Stark. I’m integrated in almost every room in the Tower, as well as Boss’s Iron Man suits. If you need assistance with anything, please feel free to ask me.” Bucky gave a closed-mouth smile and he nodded.
“Yeah, I see it, too!” The genius made a slight adjustment to get a better hold on the boy, then flew as fast as he could toward the jet. As they approached, a door on the jet opened, and Bucky was standing at the entrance, waiting to greet them.
“I pinky-promise I won’t let anyone get hurt or killed.” The super-soldier held up his pinky and wrapped it around the business owner’s. “Good night.”
“Yeah, I thought you looked tired when I first saw you this morning. Well, it’s almost time for lunch now, so why don’t we take a break, and go back to your lessons this afternoon?” The prince nodded and they parted ways for a few hours.
The blond shook his head and the stranger lifted their chin. “This is Bucky. Apparently Hydra gave him something when they kidnapped him so that he was able to survive the fall. They had him this whole time. They gave him a new arm to replace the one he lost when he fell, and gave him...well, not exactly the same serum that Dr. Erskine gave me...but as close as they could get, then wiped his memory and stuffed their Winter Soldier programming into him. And
As the two super-soldiers were leaving, the hybrid turned to face Bruce, grinned again, and waved, then he turned back to his friend. “Steve? Can we have tuna for dinner?” he asked in a whisper.
Tony looked at his instructor, trying to figure out if the blond was a man of his word, but nodded after a moment. “Yes, we do.”
“I’ll be right back.” He tapped on the notification, which made a second hologram appear, and immediately saw his mother’s face.
“That’s fine. Steve, make sure Bucky doesn’t have anything to eat or drink after midnight tonight, ok?” Steve nodded just as the hybrid was waking up.
“Tony, your father wants to see you. He’s in the library. I’m far too busy making sure this castle runs smoothly, and on schedule, to be the king’s messenger, but I was the first person he saw with a communicator. I’ll never understand why kings aren’t required to wear them like everybody else. I’m coming to get you. Stay where you are. There are some things I need to talk to you about on our way to the castle,” and without letting Tony answer, she ended the call with a “goodbye”.
“They aren’t feeding you properly in that damn castle, are they?” Sarah turned so her good eye faced Tony. “You’re the prince. You’ll be king one day. It’s your job to make sure everyone gets enough food.” Steve looked startled for a brief moment, before she responded, “Yes, I know he’s the prince. I’m not an idiot, Steven!”
Steve sighed in annoyance. “Come on, Stark. Answer your damn phone,” he muttered to himself, until finally the other man answered.
“How much will it cost me for you to leave us alone?” the business owner asked, before stepping into the room.
version of the same serum I got, then had his memory wiped and was forcibly turned into the Winter Soldier. Then they injected him with feline DNA to make him a better assassin for them. The DNA gave him cat ears and a tail, and changed his eyes to be more like a cat’s, so he’s more limber than I am, and has better eyesight and hearing.”
“We spoke this morning while he was getting ready to meet you. The nightmares, he mentioned you made them stop.”
“You’re right. It is late.” Sarah stood up and gathered all of her gifts. “You should just stay the night, then go home sometime tomorrow.”
“Do you have any plums?” he asked, knowing that they were his friend’s favorite. She guided him toward the plums, in-between peaches and apricots.
“Captain Rogers is on his way, and Doctor Banner will be at the workshop in a few minutes. He is in the middle of a time-sensitive experiment.”
Pepper noticed the prince return and stopped speaking. After Tony gave the riding instructor back his clothes, they left, and as they did Steve could hear her telling him that she was not aware of what the conversation was going to be about, but asked him to be careful because the king seemed to be enraged, getting a “when isn't he?” in response.
Bucky seemed sad for a second, almost depressed. Steve pulled him closer, wrapping his arms warmly around the soldier, in an attempt to comfort him.
“Hey, James,” the billionaire said when he saw Bucky, who had moved to sit at the kitchen table, but there was no response. “Why do I even bother?” he whispered to himself.
The next morning, as Steve was heading to the kitchen for breakfast with the other servant, he overheard Natasha, the queen’s lady’s maid, and Wanda, a scullery maid, gossiping.
Two hours later, the blond walked out of the Tower’s elevator and onto his floor. He was absolutely exhausted, not in the mood to deal with any arguing that had happened between Bucky and Tony, and hadn’t been able to get that little boy’s face out of his mind. He just didn’t understand how somebody, or several somebodies, could treat someone…
“Better?” The soldier nodded, closed his eyes, and let him wash his hair. After a few minutes, his hair was washed and the blond spoke again. “Oh! I found something for you. Let me go get it!” He reached up to the shelf next to the tub and pulled down a white cat.
They took everything of the wooden horse, brought it to the paddock, where Friday was waiting for them, and, after a “small” panic attack because of his fear, the prince was tasked with repeating the same process of saddling and bridling, but this time without help from his instructor. He was doing amazingly well, too! But as he went to get into the saddle, he slipped and fell. Thankfully, Steve was standing right next to him and was able to catch the royal before he could get hurt.
“No, you’re not,” the prince grumbled under his breath, but Steve ignored him and continued the lesson.
Tony’s father spoke for his wife. “As you know, in our kingdom, a prince is eligible to be king on his twenty-first birthday. Which means that you will be in line for the throne next year. As king, it will be your duty to journey to other kingdoms to forge alliances and aid them in times of war, as they will do for you. There will be times when you will be expected to ride a horse...without having a fit of terror, so we’ve hired an instructor by the name of Steve Rogers to teach you. He’ll be here soon. Go wait in the stables for him.” The king picked up his Starkpad and turned it back on, clearly dismissing his son.
The riding instructor felt Tony lean against him, and looked over to see the royal sleeping. Knowing that they’d have to leave soon to get to his mother’s house, he paid the bill for their drinks and picked up the disguised prince.
Steve watched his teammate for a few seconds before he realized what was going on. “Stark,” he said, slowly approaching the man. “Look at me. You need to breathe, Stark. In and out. In. Out. That’s right. Nice and slow. Good. In...out. You’ll be ok. Just concentrate on breathing. Good!” Eventually, the genius’s panic attack ended and his breathing was easier. “Better?” Tony nodded.
injected him with feline DNA to give him even more enhanced qualities. He’s more agile than me and has better hearing and eyesight. Unfortunately, there were things that they didn’t expect.” Bucky lowered his hood and took off his cap. Tony took a step back in shock. “Yeah. I was surprised, too. He went to the College to try to get his cat ears and tail removed, and his eyes fixed to look more human, but as soon as people saw him, they started screaming, so he ran here to hide, and I found him and called you right away.”
“I know you were, Buck. And Tony knows it, too. He’s just upset because attaching the elbow made the middle finger flip him off.” The captain paused, trying not to laugh out loud again. “Don’t worry. He’ll calm down in a little while, then you can go apologize to him. I know talking to people is scary, but I think you have to.”
’ he thought, happy that he had managed to stay awake all night and not dream about the past. Standing up from his chair, the prince stretched, then grabbed the empty mead pitcher and walked back to his room to get ready for his morning lessons with his very handsome riding instructor.
The next morning, Bucky was on the hard hospital mattress, the tv on the wall streamed some bad show, and his arm hurt from the IV poking it.
Bruce and his fellow doctors then started to dig the flesh to take all of the metal off. The sight made Tony cry, but the nurses only wiped his face and pretended that nothing happened.
’ “Ok, JR. You can open your eyes and stand up now. Take my hand. When the doors open up, walk as fast as you can, and don’t let go of my hand.” When the elevator stopped, he stepped out and was immediately stopped by two security guards.
take them out to the paddock to get some fresh air and exercise. Once they’re outside, we’ll have to muck out every stall,” the blond said.
“Hi, Pepper,” Tony greeted the former princess, who had chosen to give up her title and help his family after their former reeve passed away suddenly.
She wrote down that information on a notepad that she had taken out of her pants-pocket. “Thank you, Captain. May I ask why
“I’m sorry, Tony. I’m exhausted, I have a headache, and I have to get up early in the morning to do chores around the farm and in the house for my mom before we leave. I don’t want to fight with you. If you want to share the bed, that’s fine with me, but how would we do that?”
“I’ll be back as soon as I can with Buckitty Junior. While I’m gone, ask F.R.I.D.A.Y. to find someplace for him to sleep. We’ll also have to get a bed, clothes, toys, and anything else you think he’ll want or need. She can help with that, too.” The two super-soldiers nodded, and Tony left.
to give the order to shoot me. It isn’t safe for any of the Avengers. Clint still has that farm with his family, right?”
“Wanna choose, Buck?” he asked, but the soldier wasn’t listening. He was preoccupied, and looking at something else.
“Of course! I’m at the stables. I’m just finishing up the last of my chores for the night, but I’ll be done by the time you get here. If you want, we could go down to the village for a while. I was going to go there after this to see my mom. Why don’t you come with me?” Steve suggested. The prince nodded.
The feline ate his breakfast, sickly sweet pancakes, quickly and ran to the workshop, the door of which opened for him immediately. The room was deserted, except for one of Tony’s bots, who was out of its charger to greet anyone who walked in, and keep them company. He looked around, but couldn’t see the business owner. As he was about to leave, he caught sight of the project that the mechanic had been working on while the hybrid watched, and had left unfinished. It was a new mechanical arm to replace the one the super-soldier currently had, one that wasn’t responsible for so many murders. It wasn’t fancy in its design yet, but he
“He’s not an experiment!” the business owner argued. “He’s a little boy who is very sick and needs a doctor! It’s a basic human right!”
The blond man put his arm around Tony’s waist, with the prince’s arm around his neck, and started walking slowly back to the stable, promising that he would put Friday back in her stall and then help the brunet back to the castle. “Will you be ok by yourself for a few minutes while I take care of Friday?” He carefully helped the royal onto a crate so he could rest for a moment.
“It’s ok. I like it!” JR piped up, then coughed loudly. The billionaire turned around so his back was to the Director and bent down.
He took off the mask, hat, gloves, and scrubs, and sat down for a second, his heart beat too hard for him to listen to anything else, so he jumped a bit when Steve spoke, having not heard him approach.
“I will. Bye, Stark.” As she was hanging up, the mechanic could have sworn he heard Clint in the background, saying that the tacos were ready.
“I’ll let you know,” Peter screamed and jumped on the horse once again, pulling his hood over his head, and riding away as fast as he could.
As they took the equipment for the horses outside to clean, Steve thought. He showed the prince how to clean everything, and thought. They were both quiet as they got to work on their task, and he thought more. Suddenly, he couldn’t stand it anymore and had to ask the royal a question that had been bothering him for the last two days.
Bucky’s neck hurt, his skin was sticky, and the whole room felt a little too hot for his liking. He shifted to the side, snuggling closer to Steve. The night before, the captain had announced that he was going to bed, and the soldier had just...followed him into his bedroom.
I would like to thank hello-shellhead (hello-shellhead.tumblr.com) for granting me permission to use a drawing on their tumblr as inspiration for this fic.
speaking unless it was to confirm one of Hydra’s orders. If he spoke at any other time, he was punished.
“Thank you, dear. You know, every time Steve called me and talked for hours about how beautiful you are, I didn’t believe him.” Tony’s face turned red. “I can see why he’s so in love with you.”
"Oh. I should have contacted Mum to tell her I was safe. Damn. Alright. I’ll go see her first thing in the morning. Make the meeting after nine in the morning, please.” He came closer and whispered in her ear. “Get the kid some Stark tech, please. The communicator, a laptop, things like that."
“Thank you!” Tony said gratefully before taking the clothes from him going to the back of the stables to change. As soon as he was ready, he came back to see that Steve had moved three heavy bags over to a very large container that was on a raised platform. “What’s that?” he asked, as his instructor pulled out a pocket knife to cut open one of the bags, which looked like it was full of...seeds? Tony wasn’t sure.
“Well, do you want to try going back to sleep? I can sing to you, if you want,” the man suggested. The kid nodded and lied back down.
“They're dangerous at both ends and crafty in the middle. Why would I want anything with a mind of its own bobbing about between my legs?”
.” Tony activated his communicator bracelet, opening the camera mode. “Come closer.” Peter did and he took the picture, sending it to the child’s phone with an easy swiping motion.
“Tonight, after dinner. You and Prince T’Challa should be all set up by then.” Right at that moment, Jarvis came in to the room to announce that dinner was ready to be served.
“It’s time to go, JR! Do you trust me?” The boy nodded. “Good! I’m going to do something that might seem a little scary, but I promise it won’t hurt you, and I promise that it’s still me, ok?” JR nodded again. “Good boy. Now, right after I do the scary thing, I want you to put your arms around my neck and hold on as tight as you can. Got it?”
“Buckitty!” the billionaire muttered to himself. He quickly changed his shirt, then picked up the prosthetic arm, got in the elevator, and went to...have a little talk with Bucky.
Three days later, Steve was finally home. Well, back in New York, at least. But before he could really go home, he first had to have his debriefing with the new Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Thaddeus Ross. The general had taken over the position after Nick Fury was dismissed because he ignored an order from the World Security Council during the attack on New York by Loki and the Chitauri. As he stepped off the elevator and was about to make his way to the Director’s office, he was hit in his left hip by…
“Thank you, Jarvis!” Queen Peggy rose from her throne. “If Your Highnesses will please follow me?” The three royals walked out, but Tony was stopped before he could follow them.
“I’m going to the farmer’s market in Union Square. Wanna come with me?” the blond asked. The soldier’s cat ears perked up and he grinned happily, then stood up and ran to get dressed.
’ He looked down at his project and frowned. The elbow was fixed, but he saw the same problem he‘d had all day.
“Anthony, by the end of the evening, I expect you to ask for the princess’s hand in marriage,” his father commanded.
She gave him a warm smile. “Thank you. I was looking at your kingdom on the way to the castle, and there are some things that I would be interested in sharing with you. Areas of technology that I think you could improve on. When is the next time you’re available?”
Tony whimpered, still scared. “I don’t want to learn to ride, but my father says I have to if I’m going to be king. I’m just so afraid!” He started crying softly.
“Is everything alright? The anesthesiologist will come in a second,” he said before leaving. Steve nodded then comforted Bucky, petting his ears. A few minutes later, he was taken to the operating room, which had a theater for people to watch the procedure. Tony hands were shaking. He could feel Steve’s glare from the gallery.
Steve asked Bucky to cover up, not only because he was part-cat, but also because he didn’t want anyone recognizing them, although the little old lady from the fruit stand recognized him in the first few weeks, even with the baseball cap and hoodie on.
The following afternoon, Tony was standing outside of the stables, waiting for Steve to bring out a horse, and taking deep royal breaths trying to calm down his racing heart. “Calm down,” he said to himself. “You can do this. You are a Stark and Starks are made of iron. It’s just a horse. There’s nothing to be afraid of. So what if they’re huge...with long faces...and sharp teeth...and hooves that could step on you...and weigh enough to crush you… oh, God. No! Don’t think like that. Just breathe, Tony. Think about something else. Like...the periodic table.”
“Hello, Your Highness,” the riding instructor said, without any real enthusiasm. He almost sounded sad.
are Bucky-sitting.” Both men opened their mouths to argue. “That’s an order!” He moved the feline off his lap. “Now, if you will both excuse me, I have to go pack and make sure everything is ready to go. I’ll be back as soon as I can. Try not to kill each other while I’m gone.”
“Jotunheim. There will be a ball tonight. I want you to meet a potential queen for this kingdom,” Tony rolled his eyes at his father's words. “I already told you not to do that, Anthony. It’s disrespectful.” He still hadn’t looked up from his phone.
high up! “JR? Yeah. Hi. Yes, I told you to hold on as tight as you can, but I still need to be able to breathe. Loosen your death grip just a tiny bit, please. Thank you.”
“No, I’m fine. I’m just...I need your help, Tony. Please.” The billionaire paused in typing the code to get to his latest Iron Man suit. It was rare for Steve to use his first name, and if he was doing it now, then it was important.
“It’s a bath squirter. You squeeze its sides, then put it under the water and let go so that water gets sucked inside. Then pull it out of the water and squeeze the sides again so that it squirts out water. Wanna try, Buck?” The feline grinned and spent the next hour spraying Steve with water, giggling happily the whole time. Eventually the captain said that it was time to get out of the bathtub. He wrapped a towel around the hybrid’s waist, then picked up another towel to carefully dry his cat ears and tail.
“Steve?” He turned. The feline was looking at the sketchbook the captain had left open. “Is that me?”
’ Steve thought to himself before replying, “If May allows him. Ask her, Pete.” Steve shrugged and took the box the boy brought for Sarah. “We need to leave by four.”
Soon a letter slid under his elbow. Tony had no idea how to read the messy Russian that the super-soldier wrote.
Steve grabbed a shower cap with flowers all  over it and a pair of scissors. He placed the cap on Bucky’s head and carefully cut it so that it only covered his cat ears.
Bucky brought his tail in front of his body. He started wringing it, the way some people wring their hands when they’re nervous. “Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean, the last time I was around people, they started screaming. Or what if... What if this doctor is like the ones at Hydra?”
“It's alright. As you said, you didn’t know it was me. You can call me ‘Tony’, by the way.” The prince winked, then leaned in to whisper in the other man’s ear. “You know, just in case you feel like screaming it when you’re alone tonight.” He pulled back and smirked at the blond’s stunned expression. “I’ll see you later, Steve.” He threw the cigarette on the ground before stepping on it to put it out, and walked back to the castle like nothing had happened, leaving Steve speechless.
“Bye, Mistah Amewica!” the child called as he was taken away. The woman was about to follow them, but she was stopped by the super-soldier.
“So, a dog, then?” The genius had to take a deep breath to control his temper. “Why am I here, Rogers? You’re perfectly capable of taking the dog to the shelter on your own.”
lie to you! Think, Buck! In all the years you’ve known me, have I ever lied to you?” The other super-soldier shook his head. “Exactly. So, why would I start now?”
“Just some freak that we rescued when we were taking down A.I.M. I’m sorry you had to see him, Captain. We’ll make sure he doesn’t bother you again.” The captain had to take a deep breath to control his temper and not say something that he would (not) regret.
“Excellent! Your father and I are expecting guests, and we want you there to greet them. Come to the throne room as soon as you can,” the queen said.
“Well, he did fall. I was on my way home from my run, and I saw what looked like a cat dart into the alley, so I went to investigate.”
“It is not difficult at all, Your Highness,” Jarvis said, patiently. “It is just improper. You are a royal, and our superior. Calling you by a shortened version of your given name would be disrespectful, not only to you, but also to the King and Queen, who spent many months searching for a name befitting of their adopted son and heir, since your birth mother, Maria, died before she could name you.” Happy nodded, agreeing with Jarvis.
After carefully placing him on America’s back, Steve climbed onto the saddle, with the royal in front of him for safety, then reached over and grabbed Friday’s reins so that she would walk beside them as they rode, and they continued their journey.
The feline knew he wouldn’t be falling back asleep any time soon, so he decided to see where the mechanic spent most of his time. The elevator was fairly easy to use, but unfortunately his passcode, which was supposed to work on every door in the tower, did not work to open the workshop’s door. After several failed attempts, he decided to just tap on the glass doors until the genius let him in. Tony didn’t notice at first, the glass was soundproof after all. Just as he was about to go back to his room, the door unlocked, and the hybrid happily skipped over to the genius’s left side, but the other man
"The day he will make you smile Tony I will forgive him but do not except me to give him a chance like that. He left you to die and I will never get over that. You are the only family I have except for Rhodey. You are my brother Tony you have protected me and now its my turn and I will not let anyone harm you. You need to understand that. I will forgive Steve when he stops hurting you in your nightmares" Carol replied. Tony just hugged her thats all he needed a hug from her.
No matter how much he tried he knew he could not do anything right now. The thought of Steve coming back was too much. Natasha entered the room
"I know Friday I know" he said defeated. Friday was an A.I. but she knew that her boss would never give up this easily in the past.
"Dont you ever do that to me Stark. Just because I am a doctor does not mean you always end up in a hospital which is in your tower. If you wanted to see me should have messaged or emailed no need to be that dramatic" Stephen said.
"That thing can fly" Bucky said and Sam just starred with Scott trying to understand. Steve was a bit shocked.
"You know i just realised something Nat" Nat looked up to him and smiled. She was smart and she knew where this was going. "Life is too short to hold grudges you know. When I passed out and I thought this was it I was going to die. All I could see was his eyes his blue his and his face. That was the only thing I wanted to remember and I do not want to die like this" Tony finished.
"But didnt you want to be there because you were scared what I would do to Barnes?" Tony asked unsure of the reply.
"Eyes on me Barnes" Tony said and Bucky nodded. He was looking at Tony and he was smiling. Bucky could do this.
"I will always love you Tony and whenever you need me I will be here always. I heard a saying you know and I will hope it will come true. When you love something you let it go and if it comes back to you it was yours and if it doesnt it wasnt yours. Even if you do not come back to me I will still love you and wait for you everyday. In the meantime we can be team mates I hop and I will get you to trust me Tony I will do anything you want" Tony just looked at him and looked down. There was a part of him who wanted to go back to him but he knew he had to be better. He needs to look out for himself.
The day of Bruce's and Barnes evaluation was approaching. They could not delete the video from bunker because Ross had made several copies. They had no choice and as much as Tony wanted to be involved they tried to keep him out of it. Tony being Tony hacked the cameras to see what they were doing and later he was allowed in the discussions as everyone knew it was no use. They were working with Bruce at the moment and next was Barnes turn.
Tony was ready to leave. He wanted to be there on time or else he knew Stephen wont shut up about it. He thought how would Steve react to Stephen. Somewhere in his heart he was a bit excited to see how Steve and Stephen would react. Stephen was there helping him to heal after the whole Accords. But he saw Stephen only as a friend and he was very glad to have a friend like him in his life. But he knew there was nothing more as Tony was still in love with Steve.
"Mr Stark I am ready. Cooper is still sleeping. Last night he was very upset but he will be okay. Is it okay if he can stay here? Also, May called and said hi" Peter came rushing
It was evening and Tony was trying to decide what to wear for his date. He felt a bit nervous and he just couldn't decide what to wear. Whenever Steve use to plan dates in the past they use to be in a nice cozy setting or he use to cook for Tony. Steve told him they were going to go out but not out. That did not even make sense. Maybe he should cancel but he did not want too when he promised himself that he would try. Maybe he should call Rhodey. He video called Rhodey
"It is in the closet kiddo, I just need a small bag just for the night. You wait here I will go get it done"
"Tony..Carol she cares about you a lot, she did not have any family and you treated her like family, she is very protective of you and she is clearly not happy with all of them coming back. We both know she will do anything to protect you"
"Steve get up" Steve looked at Tonys eyes he said his name so softly. The brown eyes made contact with him and turned. Steve got up and sat on the chair.
"Hey Cap it wasnt your fault he is just a kid" Carol had said and everyone looked at her shocked. She was being nice to Steve?
"You guys have read the accords we sent through T'Challa I believe and these are the amended version you guys can read and sign them. If you have any problem the jet is still waiting and take you back" Pepper started in her CEO voice. She wanted to be done with this. Last 3 months was spent on these accords so these people can sign it. Tony, Nat, Pepper, Vision, Carol and Rhodey had spent too many hours fighting and holding meetings for up to 9 hours to get them sorted if they still have a problem she would not hesitate to send them back.
"I spoke about you being in the room with me for Bucky I know you were upset-" Tony was cut off by Steve.
"I am fine Steve. Thank you for staying and looking after me" Tony replied. He felt a bit hurt when Steve took his hand away as if he was caught up doing something bad. Tony missed Steve's hand in his.
Tony and Nat entered and everyone turned towards them. Steve saw how stressed both of them looked. Nat went to hug Bruce as soon as she entered. Something was really wrong Steve thought.
"Well last time he was there you did not do much good Steve. I wont harm Barnes if that is what you are trying to say" Tony replied.
After Rhodey's procedure everyone gathered in the common room including Clint. The tension was high. Steve started speaking "what happened tonight was no accident or coincident. Everyone getting attacked separately at an untimely hour shows that our enemy knows us well. They are keeping tabs on us and they know how to get to us. We all need to stick togetehr like we always do. Have each others back and look out for each other. We need to find out this person and deal with them. Look into the CCTV footage and see where these guys came from scan the number plates. Lets find these guys and teach them what happens when you mess with the avengers".
"Tony you have your watch right?" Steve whispered worried. He did not want Tony to go in there at all but he trusted Tony and he knew the genius would have a back up. Tony just nodded.
"I am sorry about what Clint said. I feel guilty about it and he was wrong I did not kick you out of my life I never will."
"Here Mr Stark" Vision gave him the glass. No one said anything. They probably heard me calling out for Steve he thought. He drank the water and just sat there. Natasha's gaze was set on him, he knew she wanted to ask more but was hesitant. He was a big boy he could do this. He cannot let anyone worry more, if Carol and Rhodey found out about how he was actually feeling they would kidnap him and take him to the Stark mansion probably.
Tony was in the wormhole, he saw what was right above them. All he could see was darkness. It was dark and suddenly he saw Steve dead laying there with the whole team. He ran towards Steve and held him. He looked around for others.
"I know Tony but you were his family as well and he did not even call once Tony I waited and waited what if Ross would have taken us. I told him after the whole Sokovia that he needs to put his family first. Nathaniel is 3 what am I suppose to tell him that his dad just took off because he got a phone call. I love him I really do but if he..."
"Yeah i attached some sensory system which will it feel like there is a flow of activity which will help the psychological neurons in you brain also I attached a system which will keep your hand warm like not always warm but will me the same as the rest of your body temperature and the metal is really light and i have weighed it accordingly to the weight of what a human arm is suppose to be" Tony just babbled like always. Peter listened to it and went over to entertain Dum-E and YOU.
"Lets go in the common room, I am sure everyone is there" Steve said and Tony just smiled. Steve knew Tony was still thinking about his nightmare but he knew taking him to the common room will help.
"Well I had a little help from Nat and Carol. I wanted to have this date with only me and you. Nat suggested about the roof and I just had a vision of what I wanted" Steve replied.
"Wanda I want you to travel with me to Kamer Taj. We are going to assess your capabilities and provide you a better control on your emotions. We have people like you who were given these gifts and they are doing really well. One of the avengers member can come with you and I will deliver weekly reports to Stark" Strange offered. The one member from Avengers would be Vision he remembered how Wanda wanted to improve because of him.
"Steve" He sighed. "I dont want to hurt you or fight with you but please. I am done. I cant do this. I am sorry for things as well. Here you go" He kept something on the table. Steve looked at it and his eyes turned wide.
"They are currently at a safe house Mr Barton as Ross turned to target your families as they were unprotected. Tony took care of it like everything else" Carol said
"Tony we all are happy if you are happy. We havent informed Pepper about you. You know how she gets. Do you think you can forget what happened in the past?" Nat asked
"I forgive you Cap is that what you want? Is that you want to hear so it could make you feel better?" Tony replied still not looking at him.
"I was being unreasonable Tony and you are the perfect person to be in there. I mean I will be there if you want me to be there but I know you can handle Bucky fine on your own and if it comes to stopping the winter soldier you will put him down" Steve replied and Tony just stood there still shocked.
"Steve we have to stop hurting. We need to stop hurting each other and ourselves. This way we wont go anywhere" Tony replied and Steve just nodded.
"Tony, why arent you ready yet. You know what time it is right? It is 8 am. Everyone is waiting upstairs and the jet is about to land in exactly one hour. Have you called Ross yet with the timings? He wanted update on the avengers and after signing the accords he wants a copy as well. Also, have you packed your stuff? should I call Happy to assist you? What-"
"He always carries this notebook, a guy like Ross would keep it near him and that is the only thing I remember he had in every meeting tucked in his pocket. I can review the security to confirm" Nat replied. She was sure she saw that notebook all the time.
"Do you-want to-I mean do you-Would you like to sleep I mean up to you what I wanted to ask you was that if you would-" Steve smiled he knew what Tony was asking and smiled.
"Give this lil munchkin to me and you go ahead" Tony took Nathaniel so Laura could hold Lila's hand who seemed nervous during the ride. Cooper was clearly sulking by now and Peter was with him. Laura walked in first. Friday must have alerted everyone else as everyone was in the lounge. Laura and Lila were followed by Tony and Nathaniel in his arms. Peter and Cooper were the last.
"Kid you stay here and prepare for the party with Clint and Laura. It is not mandatory for everyone to be there so you stay here and plan a big party and make sure to invite Potts-Hogan" Tony said. In reality he did not want Ross to see Peter and he wanted to keep the kid away. Clint had just wanted to spend more time with his kids and Tony understood. Peter just nodded.
"Cooper come here you have grown up so much" Clint said hugging Lila. Cooper refused to move and go near his dad. He just stood there with Peter.
"I will see when I am free so you can talk, right now I have work in the lab I will see you guys in the evening" Tony stated in a calm manner and rush towards the elevator.
"It was not your fault Barnes get that out of your head. Its all in the past okay? I hope I could have helped you more" Tony whispered.
"You just woke up Steve and you should rest" Rhodey argued. Surprisingly it was Carol who disagreed with Rhodey. She might have seen the how much Steve wanted to be there.
"He is outside" Nat whispered. Steve looked at her and nodded. Tony would visit him soon but he knew he must be really pissed if he wasn't here next to him or maybe he was expecting too much.
As soon as Steve left Stephen looked at Tony and nodded disapprovingly and Tony felt even more guilty. He knew Steve he knew how he would be sitting somewhere and thinking how he was wrong. Rogers was an idiot and he was even a bigger idiot but Steve was his idiot. Nat got up and nodded Tony to come outside and Tony followed. "I know I am wrong Nat you dont have to tell me that I already feel bad and I will go and apologise I was out of the line and I-" he was cut off by Nat "Tony I know you know that and I know you didnt mean to but right now Steve thinks that you still havent forgiven him. Whats wrong Tony?" Nat said. "Beside the obvious you mean?" and Nat just rolled her eyes, "Nat I am scared what if it was Steve and they killed him or someone else how am I suppose to protect you guys?" Tony said. "Together Tony, when we are together we are strong and we all have each others backs so go tell this to your boy and go and rest or whatever" Nat replied and left.
"Hi Tony we were wondering what will you like for dinner? I will be cooking tonight" Sam asked. Sam knew Tony was a good person at heart and after he knew what happened in Siberia he did not blame him at all. He knew anyone would have reacted that way. Somewhere he was disappointed in Steve but he knew the damaged had been done.
"Why dont you sleep Nat, sleep here or if you want you can sleep in the lab on the couch. I am sorry I know you dont want to-"
"Pete I am okay" Tony whispered. The kid was radiating anxiety and Tony thought how much his emotions affect everyone around him. Peter just nodded and sat with Cooper. Cooper just gave Tony the look 'I dont want to be here but now I am stuck' but Tony knew he had to do this. The kid looked up to him and if he ran away from his problem Cooper will do the same. He went to have a seat with Laura and Nat. Bruce had went to his room to get changed.
"What the hell vis announce yourself, heart patient here. One day I will have a heart attack because of you and yes I am staying" Vision just blinked
"Morning Shellhead. Don't ever scare me like that okay?" Nat whispered and moved closer to place a kiss on Tony's cheek.
Tony looked around and say Bruce. he just went and hugged his science bro. His person that what Bruce was to him. "Bruce" he whispered.
"Are you sure?" Clint asked. "I mean there can be other people who would do this kind of a thing or maybe a new villain we never run out of those" he added. "No, I think Tony is right Clint. It has to be him" Natasha replied. She knew the devil well and she knew how Ross likes to play. Steve and Tony were correct but what next. "He must have a trail" Stephen added. Steve looked up at him and nodded. He could hate the guy later right now what mattered was to be together and he was willing. "Stephen is right, he must have a record or trail of all his dirty work" Steve added. "So why don't we go and arrest the guy?" Wanda asked. "You can't arrest him till you have proof Wanda we need proper proof against him" Steve replied to her.
"Nat spoke to the WC they agreed to give us 2 more weeks due to Tony's health. Me, Nat and Rhodey will handle Ross with Pepper" Carol replied
"I cant decide what to wear, should I wear my suit or should I go casual I was thinking casual but not to casual because what if he is taking me to some fancy restaurant but who cares right? but I do not want to be over dressed you see what I-" Tony was cut off by Rhodey's laugh.
"Tony this is not some game to me and I would never leave you again. I mean it. I really appreciate what you did with the shield I really do but I am more than just a guy with shield. I cant use to the shield again Tony" Steve whispered the last part painfully. How could he make Tony understand this whole situation.
"Tony you have to understand please. I do not trust any of those people near you and if I have to I will get rid of them. I know you are upset and you think I am making you run just for a few days stay with us the mansion isnt that far away and we will train together. Peter is worried and I am as well. You almost died if I havent showed up in that bunker you would have been gone kay so yeah I will be angry. If I have to I will kill them"
"I may not like you Steve but my best friend still loves you for some reason and I do not want to upset him anymore. If I being nice you makes him happy I will do it. Consider this your chance you asked for" Carol replied. She knew how a week ago he was upset about the chat she had with Steve. If this brought happiness to Tony she would do it. She could see how much Steve cared for Tony. But she still had her doubts.
He was just going to dress casual. It was exactly 7 when Friday announced that Steve was waiting in his lounge. Tony felt excited and nervous he looked at the mirror and he prepared himself.
"I know I know" she said hugging him. Natasha Romanov was not a person who likes to hug but she knew Tony just needed someone right now. She was upset at Steve and angry at herself. If only Bruce was here she thought. She knew bruce and Tony had a bond which no one had but still Tony had her and she had him. She had seen him suffer too much, the council giving him shit and he taking blame for her. He was an idiot but she knew he still loved Steve.
"Okay. But call me if you get stuck in some mess" Pepper replied. As soon as they arrived Happy was there. Pepper said her Good byes and they were off. Tony and Nat went inside to see Ross.
Tony was pissed. No that word did not even describe what Tony felt. Steve went into the field with no shield and was nearly knocked out. Thank god Tony saw at the correct moment and jumped in front of him knowing his suit could take the blast from that robot. If he didn't-no he did not even want to think what would have happened. Steve was currently on the hospital floor. Tony brought him in and stayed with him till Steve stirred. Tony stayed outside his room he did not want to see him because he knew he would say things in anger which he wont mean. Currently Nat and Sam were inside. Bruce was still calming down, Peter was sleeping in his room and Carol and Rhodey went home. He just stood outside and the doctor came out.
"You will meet him soon. Discuss it with Wanda first" Tony said and joined everyone at the table. Tony was placed between Peter and Nat. Cooper was beside Peter and in between Peter and Sam. Bruce sat next to Nat. Laura, Clint, Bucky, Lila and Scott were in front of him. Steve was directly in front of him. Vision sat at the head of the table and everyone ate there meal.
"M-y po-ck-et" Tony tried to speak and Rhodey nodded. Rhodey reached out and saw an injection in the while Tony just nodded towards Bucky and Rhodey administrated it. Bucky stopped struggling. It was something Tony had kept with him if something went wrong. Bucky and Tony had a small chat.
"How dare you? How low can you get Clint. This man has protected your family while you just abandoned them. You went off with all of them when you promised me you would not. You know you had made quite a lot of enemies and people were after us. Tony has protected your kids and your wife while you were running around. He did your job. You should be thankful. Nathaniel doesnt remeber you because you werent there. His uncle Tony was. Lila is so sensitive and every time she asked for you Tony told them that you were working never once he told them the truth. Cooper is smart he knew. Stop blaming him for your failure. One more thing dont attack his personal life because I will fight for him Clint so dont your dare bring his past up" Laura shouted.
"I swear to god I will send you all to some college or probably soak you motherboards" You and Dum-E stopped fighting for a second and started again. Dum-E looked at Tony and beeped his Claw
"I know Stevie I know but that guy who is so genius is the most stupid person I have met when it comes to feeling" Bucky smiled. He knew and understood why Steve was so nervous and Tonys current health wasn't good. Bucky was scared as well he knew this Trial could go wrong but he had to try.
"Boss is alone and watching TV at the moment Captain" Friday replied. Finally Steve thought he will have a chance to speak to Tony. Friday had notified Tony already and Tony was waiting for Steve. Suddenly he saw sparks and Stephen was walking out of it.
"He was blackmailing us with the video. He wants Barnes to go to the Trial where they will use the words to see if the Winter Soldier is still there before clearing him up for the duty as well as Hulk to see his control towards citizens. The Accords protect all of you and your rights. However, if the video leaks out-" Tony sucked in a sharp breath of air and continued "they will have murder charges pressed against Steve and attempted murder on Barnes. He also knows that Natasha let you and bucky leave the airport and she is on the block as well. It is either Bruce and Barnes on the Trial or the video goes public" Tony sighed and sat down. He needed whiskey+coffee that would make him feel better. Everyone just stood quietly.
"If you want me to stay I will. I would do anything for you Tony, anything. Dont ever hurt yourself like that please" Steve asked and Tony just nodded and backed away slightly and Steve let him.
He promised himself to stay till Tony needed him and he will leave once Tony was healthy. He will inform Tony about this as he did not want Tony to think he left for other reasons. He needed to tell the team as well. If him being away from Tony meant Tony being healthy that is what he will do even if it kills him. For Tony he will do anything.
"No Clint he does not hate you, he just needs a but of time be patient with him he will come around" tony spoke.
Steve woke up in a weird setting. This was not his room and he was not in tower for sure. Did someone kidnapped him, all these thoughts were running his mind. He hated waking up to a setting like that. After waking up in Shield HQ this was the second time he felt like that and why was everything so hazy. Tony! he remembered. Tony he had to go to Tony. As soon as he started to sit up a hand came on him and before he can hurt the person he saw it was Carol.
"I am glad everything is working out Stephen. I do not know how many more of these can my heart take" Tony sighed.
"Yeah the Doc guy who was cuddling with you last night. Sorry i did not mean to disturb you. Tony you have enough people to look after you. I am not needed and I will be with you guys in the missions but I know my presence cause you pain and now you have found someone else I would not stand in the path of your happiness. I love you Tony and I-"Steve was cut off by pair of lips. Tony was kissing him holy shit. Steve was shocked but he realised what was going on. He kissed Tony back. His hands slowly made there way to Tony's back. Tony's lips were so soft and warm. He kissed Tony back with everything in him and they broke apart softly. They both had there eyes closed and just stood there with there foreheads touching.
this responsibility, but continued on nevertheless. If no one else was going to do it, Clint was damn sure going to stand up and do it. Even if he was just a dude who learned how to shoot an arrow by circus man who then tried to kill him and turned his brother against him. He would always make the decision to fight over everything else, and he hoped to all the possible gods that they recognised that.
Natasha grabbed the wrap form the medicine cabinet along with a packet of paracetamol. She wrapped up Karen's wrist as much as she could without hurting the girl. "You want painkillers?" she asked. "It'll help the swelling go down."
And well, then there's Matthew Murdock, son of boxer Battlin' Jack Murdock, murdered after a bad boxing match. He'd never met his mother and spent every year since he was 10 living in an orphanage run by nuns.
“I told him we had all the stones here on Earth, and we would fight him, take him out if he tried to get them. The dude
"See, that's the thing, Tony," Jane said, getting excited. "You don't know me in that world of yours, do you? The one where you're married to Steve?"
“Right, of course,” Tony said, “It’s nothing but a myth in this universe. But could it be real somewhere else in the multiverse, in another universe?”
“He does,” Vision informed her. “During our research of Thanos, I discovered he has two daughters, Nebula and Gamora. He must love them, want to protect him. If I can conjure a projection of them, have him believe they are really here, maybe we can make him hesitate. Or distract him long enough to find a way to retrieve the gauntlet from him.”
Tony gave her a weak, watery smile. "No," he said truthfully, not willing to elaborate. He turned away from Natasha and focused on meticulously washing the dishes he used to cook breakfast for them. He bit his lip the entire time to keep from having a panic attack or bursting into tears, whichever one threatened to come first. He wasn't sure he liked this reality. He missed his old one. He just wanted to find his way back.
"Oh, good, you're in the lab and you haven't screwed anything up today, like, I don't know, build a murdering psychopathic robot intent of taking over the earth."
“Oh. Okay, well, he’s not a bad guy here? I mean, magic doesn’t exist. Or, I thought it didn’t. Or…I don’t know how these things work. Science isn’t my strong suit.”
“Steve wants to use the time stone to go back to before Natasha died,” Tony said in resignation. “I don’t think it’s a good idea because it leaves so much room for error. We have Thanos under control now, but there’s no guarantee that we can do it again if we go back. Do we take that risk or not? We all have to decide.”
The vibe in the tower was awkward and tense. Natasha and Clint generally hung out separate from the others, trying not to be rude but really not wanting to interact with Natasha’s younger self in case there were major consequences to interacting with your alternate self. Vision and Wanda spent most of their time together, studying his stone. Steve had taken to spending most of his time in the gym, punching bags until his arms were shaking with exhaustion, or calling Sam up and going for a run until his legs were jello and he forgot the awful situation they were in. Tony spent most of his time in his own section of the lab or in the common room in a corner with the younger Natasha. He seemed to be spending all of his time with her and it had begun to irk Steve. Why was Tony spending so much time with someone who technically wasn’t his daughter instead of helping them understand the power of the gems?
The Incident: As he was about to receive the throne of Asgard, the Aesir's ultimate enemy the Jotunns attacked. He led a war against them that ravaged their city in Asgard. Thor was then banished from Asgard and sent to Earth without his powers in order to learn a lesson of grace and humility, so he would be worthy of the hammer Mjolnir again. This led to him discovering his brother Loki had set him up, determined to outshine his brother. It was also discovered Loki was adopted, the son of a Jotunn kidnapped when they were children for a war alliance. Loki let go of the Bifrost and fell to the abyss, leaving them all stranded on Asgard and mourning.
Natasha's phone buzzing woke her up the next morning at an ungodly hour. Her mouth felt like cotton balls and her head was just as fuzzy, but she answered it anyway. She didn't want it to wake Karen up. "'Lo?" she whispered.
“Um, Steve was born in the 1920s in that other universe, and met the other you during World War II, so you’re probably kind of…dead in his world,” Natasha helpfully supplied.
Clint hated taking his eyes off Natasha, even for a second, but he scrambled from his place in the rafters and made his way to the roof. He quickly texted Frank with the info and waited for Natasha and Wesley to leave the venue and get in their car.
Steve sighed. “Yeah, but his family’s not. This sounds like something that his family might have done. His father once stripped Thor of all his powers and sent him to Earth just to teach him a lesson. Maybe someone is trying to teach us a lesson.”
The wheels of Tony’s chair scraped against the floor of his lap as he turned around in it to face Steve. “Good idea, Capsicle. You wanna go to the library and research old books that might have information? Take the redhead with you. She likes research.”
The two were interrupted by a small body plopping itself down on Tony's chest. The wind was knocked out from him for a second before he got his breath back.
There was that choked laugh again, but this time no one stopped him. The others were too busy trying to absorb whatever Tony was trying to tell them.
“Which means you’re not gonna listen to anything I say and you’re gonna continue to suffer in silence.”
“We won’t let it come to that! Please, Nat, do this for me. It’s the only thing I’ll ever ask of you again. This is me cashing in the debt you owe me. Please.”
Or, maybe after the debacle with Ultron, S.H.I.E.L.D. (or what was left of it) had finally decided to take government action and seize all of his belongings so he couldn’t be a threat to society anymore. Damn Fury if he had anything to do with it. He was just about to call Nick and give him a piece of his mind when a girl walked in his lab.
As much as Steve was embarrassed by the fact he’d been listening in on Tony and Natasha’s conversation, he was also kind of glad. He had gotten a little bit on insight into Tony’s world. It wasn’t like Steve didn’t know that Tony had an inferiority complex in there somewhere, and he felt he had to make up for his lack of social interaction with money and cool inventions, but every time he thought he saw pieces of the vulnerable Tony, it was counteracted by Tony being arrogant, selfish, and generally unpleasant to be around.
Beyond annoyed. I had the entire chapter on here and then my laptop (which won't work unless it's plugged it because the battery is messed up) unplugged itself and turned off in the middle of me checking for typos or anything and conveniently all of the text was missing, so I had to redo all of it. Thank the gods I just had to copy and paste from Word, but all the minor edits I made are gone so I had to read through the entire chapter again and make the necessary edits again. Not cool.
you, as you said, you never said no to anything I asked you to do. I’ve conquered worlds before, and you even helped me. You stood by my side for years. Why is now any different, Nebula?”
“Tony? Tony, come back to us,” a soft female voice said. It sounded tinny and faraway from Tony, and he wasn’t sure if he was dreaming the voice or if it was real. “Tony? Are you with us?” the voice asked.
"Karen just needs a place to stay, is all. She doesn't want to stay with Foggy's family. They ask too many questions."
“Okay. But now the question is how to stop him from getting all the stones? He said he already had one. What’s to stop him from gaining all the others?” Tony asked.
It was like a tingling feeling and then it was like waking up from a fog, in a strange kitchen in a house he didn’t recognise instinctively, but still knew all the same. Steve stared at the yellow stone in his hand, and then shoved it into the front pocket of his jeans.
“Thank you for doing all the work for me, Stark. I knew you were a smart one, gathering all the stones for me. All I have to do is pick you ants off one by one and then…” Thanos snapped his fingers. “You’ll all dissipate into dust.”
After dropping the kids off at their respective schools, Tony dropped by Stark Industries headquarters to get a little work in. He stopped by Pepper Pott's office first to check in on his CEO and see what's new. "Hey Pep."
“He has,” Natasha said. They turned to look at her. “When I was talking to the other Tony, he said he’d slipped into the void after the Battle of New York and met someone. They’ve been in his head for years, scaring him enough that he felt he needed to build something to protect Earth, to defend it.”
“You’re in your lab, at home,” Natasha said, sitting down next to Tony. “I don’t know what suits you’re talking about or what FRIDAY is, but Pepper is at work, running your company.”
When they’d exhausted themselves with fighting and once Vision’s neurons were successfully uploaded and waiting to be re-inserted after the big showdown, there was nothing left to do but make Thanos come to him.
Steve looked at his husband with a bemused look. "Well, we definitely have a teenage daughter," he said.
on the TV. He turned the TV off and stared at the group as they slept, wondering how his slip up last night was going to affect everyone in the house.
"Good! Sounds great. We should have a movie marathon and eat lots of junk food! I need something to distract me from this world. I sure hope movies are the same.
Childhood: He lived as a very sick, very poor kid. His father entered the army during World War I and came back with PTSD. This led to drinking and violence, taken out on him and his mother. He shot himself when he realised the kind of person he was, leaving his mother to fend for both of them alone. She worked as a nurse, taking as many shifts as she could to support Steve and his medical needs, until she got sick and died. His best friend Bucky moved in with him and helped Steve take on jobs drawing, etc. for money.
This is a somewhat shorter section, but I make up for it hopefully later when it comes time to battle Thanos. Me, unlike the movies, actually tries to establish WHY Tony and Steve have tension surrounding them and what they can do to fix it an be friends like they are in the comics. I don't know why the movies did what they did, but whatever. I attempt to fix that, so this is kind of a scene that attempts to do that a little bit.
“Sup,” Tony said, lifting a hand to wave, but keeping his eyes on whatever he was working on. “Good to see you again.”
“Well, I’m happy she’s getting the help she needs. Fuck, I think we all need therapy after what we’ve all been through.”
“I really hope that things will go back to normal, but it’s not a guarantee. At the most, I can assure you you’ll be able to find your Steve again, and if things don’t go back to normal, you’ll have him as a crutch to lean on. I’m sure he’s a lot stronger and tougher than he looks, yeah? Get through this together; you owe each other that much.”
The two lapsed into silence for a minute, until Tony’s brain caught up with him. “I’m sorry, did you say
Natasha hugged Clint. His arms wrapped around her protectively, his chin resting against the top of her head. Her face was crushed against his chest and her eyes were closed, breathing deeply in, feeling safe in the arms of her best friend. “I love you, Clinton Barton, you know that?”
—Steve, of all people—and his two kids was the most awkward thing Tony had ever experienced. He didn’t know how the hell he survived it. He had gotten used to his version of Natasha, and it was less weird, but every time he saw tiny Bucky—just a baby, for Christ’s sake—all adorable, and not evil, and happy, he couldn’t stop thinking about the footage he’d seen in his universe of the man with long, greasy hair and a metal arm that went around killing things for sport.
Steve nodded. “Right. Home field advantage. It’s always easier fighting on your own turf. You have enough energy to control the stone on your own?”
“Regardless, you’re never going to get on the same level as Steve if you two don’t hash things out. You think he thinks he’s better than all of you, he probably assumes you think
"Of course I remember Jarvis! He was my butler growing up! When I went off to college I left him behind but I always kept in touch with his family. We get together every Christmas."
“No. But I do not believe you were doing it of your own free will. Your sceptre held one of the stones.”
After a few uncomfortable minutes, Loki gave him his answer. “Very well. I shall give you the stone. You are still not welcome in Jotunheim.”
“Guys!” Steve said, bursting into the common room with Natasha at his heels. “We know who the infinity gauntlet belongs to!”
He sighed. “I know. And your dad and I will help you deal with it. And then you’ll be grounded. For like, the rest of your life.”
Steve frowned. “You think Loki is behind this? But…this originated from my world. You told me that magic and superheroes aren’t real in this universe.”
Clint easily found his way up high and out of view of the charity goers, able to look over everything going on without a hitch. He had studied the blueprints of the venue beforehand, knowing exactly where all the air vents and rafters were to keep him out of view. Clint liked high places. Almost as much as he liked his bow. And Pietro’s stupid smirk and sexy accent, but that was beside the point. Clint was good at seeing things from a distance. His hearing was shit, but his eyes and his target were good. And that’s all that mattered tonight.
Tony nodded. “I’ve been working on rebuilding JARVIS ever since his code was used to create you. If I can plug you into the system and very delicately form a line by line copy of the code, not only can I rewire your code, but I can get JARVIS back up and running.” Tony frowned. “Not that I don’t love you, too, FRIDAY, but JARVIS was my first baby.”
Tony blinked, surprised at the revelation. "Oh, shit. Sorry, man. Does he still have a twin sister, Wanda?"
“So, the Titans are an offshoot race of the Eternals. I guess they had some kind of fight with the Kree race and split off from them, settled down on an exoplanet called Titan, hence the name. They were originally a peaceful race that prospered and were science based, and then the leader died. Then the planet started to go into a famine, and in order to save the planet, half of the population was exterminated. They prospered again, and that was that.”
“I need you to use the soul stone and get him into space where he can’t go anywhere while we call for backup.”
Clint shrugged. “Maybe. I’m leaving a lot of tonight’s mission up to Frank and Wade, though. They don’t have any problems getting their hands dirty.”
before, but when working on experiments I know how to handle things as slowly, delicately, and accurately as possible. This might take days of being out of commission while I work on your neurons, Vision. You’re gonna be offline for a while. That okay with you?”
Sometime after the debriefing and when they were all getting checked out at medical, Clint took a seat next to Natasha, who was getting stitches over a pretty bad wound on her forehead. He laced his fingers through hers and sat there until the S.H.I.E.L.D. doctor left them alone. They didn’t say a word to each other, but Natasha simply placed a hand on the side of Clint’s neck and pulled him into her chest. She understood. And that was all he needed in the world.
Pepper heaved a huge sigh. She sounded so tired, like she had been through his with him before many times over the years. "I swear to God if you created something else that's going to take over the world, or if you fucked with Steve or the rest of the Avengers again I will leave this tower, Tony, and I won't come back!"
"Okay," she said. "We don't know exactly what happened, why, and if we can reverse it, but this Tony is not our Tony, okay? After his fight with Pepper over Ultron, he went down to the lab and then never came back. And Thor got worried. So I went down to the lab to check on him and we found him passed out at his lab desk and I tried to wake him up and he started spouting on about this really vivid dream he'd had about being in another world. It was this world where he wasn't a superhero, but a regular guy married to Steve and they had two kids and everything was different. And when I started telling him about his life here, he remembered having a vivid dream in the other world of him being Iron Man and that Steve was Captain America and somehow he's shifting between alternate realities. It's not in his head, I've analysed the particles in the air and they're an element that's not from this world. I thought he was just going crazy from lack of sleep and stress or something, but it's real. This Tony is really from a world where he's married to Steve, and apparently Natasha, you're his daughter, and I didn't exist, and it's all really weird and we don't know how to get him back or if the other Tony is stuck in his place in the other world."
“I used a magic gem to transport myself into another universe in order to stop an alien named Thanos from destroying half the population.”
Wade spluttered. "Ex-squeeze me? I was educating your boyfriend in some very important, no girls allowed, business."
“Are all of his siblings evil? How did Thor turn into the golden retriever in an otherwise snakey family? Maybe
Tony ground his teeth. “Watch us,” he said, before taking a hold of Steve and flying them into the sky.
“Yeah, but it’s nothing we haven’t fought before, right? This dude is just another alien. All of us together can surely take down one Titan, don’t you think?”
“Okay. And Steve? Please don’t tell me he’s some obnoxious righteous patriotic motherfucker fighting for our country.”
“Well,” Steve said, lips pursed. “I don’t think you’re gay my universe, either. You’ve been dating Pepper for a long time.”
“Yeah, it wasn’t great waking up and finding out everyone I loved was either dead or so old it didn’t matter if they were alive anymore.”
“Yeah, fuck you,” Clint said, his voice devoid of any sort of emotion whatsoever. That Titan asshole had just murdered his friend. He didn’t really have anything else to live for at this point.
“I don’t know how the stone works. Do you think we can go to Loki’s magic shop and ask him about it? Maybe he’ll have a hint as to getting us home.”
Tony looked at all of their confused and shocked faces. "Well I couldn't live here not knowing all the differences, okay? I have files on all of you I stole from S.H.I.E.L.D. down in my lab."
The Incident: As a graduate student in college, Bruce was working on a project in his school's lab. He and other scientists were trying to recreate the effects of Project Rebirth using gamma radiation. Bruce volunteered to experiment on himself. The experiment backfired and an explosion rocked the lab. Bruce was then split into his human side and when he became angry, a green beast intent on death and destruction named Hulk formed. Hulk has limited intelligence, understanding, and verbal skills. He has been on the run ever since.
“No, that’s okay. I’ll climb down myself. Wanda, can you control him long enough for me to get him into space?”
“Yeah,” Natasha said. “But his dad never wanted him to box, so he doesn’t. It’s not like he really could, anyway. He’s blind.”
In fact, it was really awkward, and Tony knew from experience. Back in his first year at MIT and her first year at Harvard, they had gotten drunk one night and Pepper let it slip that she was a virgin. Tony had laughed at her because she was fretting about it and then had to explain that he thought it was awesome she was and that led to a whole discussion about how she just wanted to do it and get it over with and one thing led to another and...well, they didn't have sex because it was weird, but they fooled around a little and then it was just awkward because Tony was gay and hadn't fully realised it yet.
With hesitation, Karen peeled off her top. There were bruised littered on her ribs, her upper arms, her torso. Some were yellowed and fading, some were stark purple and fresh. Natasha vibrated with anger. No one should be able to fuck with her best friend. No one should be hit like that. No one deserved to be thrown around like that. She gingerly took Karen's wrist in hers, pressed softly on the skin. Karen hissed in pain, but she didn't move out of Nat's grip. Natasha very gently rolled the wrist around and felt the bones. "Well, it's not broken," she said. "Just a sprain. You want my ace bandage?"
“Why not? We have the time stone. We can go back in time and save her, and then use what we know to take Thanos down.”
They settled back down on her couch. She looked over Tony, noticing he looked a little bit older, but not by much. There were new creases in the corners of his eyes and his hair was more salt and pepper than it used to be, but it seemed like the same old Tony she knew and loved.
She inserted the key to her front door into the lock and flicked on the foyer lights, her hand going straight to her gun when she saw someone sitting on her couch.
Steve closed his eyes as a strange emotion Tony couldn’t place played on his face. “The universe demands balance,” he said.
Natasha laughed. “Yeah, but he’s not here, now is he?” She smirked. “You’re not really my dad, so I don’t think you can punish me either.”
Finally they were outside, entering one of Fisk’s endless supplies of limousines fitting for the occasion. Clint mentally jotted down the license plate in case something went wrong, and watched the car pull away and out onto the streets of Manhattan. He followed Natasha’s location on his bike, careful to keep a look out for the limo in the traffic while doing so. He followed them to an abandoned warehouse in Hell’s Kitchen. Probably one of the places they were manufacturing the drugs.
"Why am I drunk?" he repeated. "I thought you all were supposed to stop me if I wanted to drink. I can't end up like my father. I can't do that to my kids.”
Clint wasn’t a prayer at all, and didn’t really believe in any of the gods that others claimed to, but he sent a small little prayer to whatever deity might exist that they would work in their favour that day as he climbed to a tree and posed with his bow and arrow ready for firing. He wasn’t even sure how he got mixed in all this superhero bullshit. All Clint really wanted to do was chill on his couch in his apartment in his underwear, watch old cartoons, and drink coffee by the pot. But apparently the universe decided that wasn’t in the cards for him. As much as he wanted to be lazy, he couldn’t have abandoned Nat or Coulson at S.H.I.E.L.D. even if he’d tried. And then he couldn’t
Natasha took a long, deep breath. “Okay,” she said. “Okay. Let’s talk to Castle and Wade first. Are they still with Fisk?”
Tony Stark, in a fit of frustration, threw the keyboard against the wall. It smashed with a clacking sound as he fell into the chair in front of the computer. A simple, boring computer, with an actual screen, no JARVIS, and nothing cool to latch onto. He ran his fingers through his hair when he heard the door to his lab open with a whooshing sound.
"Karen, your dad's not supposed to hurt you. Like hell it's not a big deal. Now let me see what he did."
The Incident: He was selected by Abraham Erskine for Project Rebirth after witnessing a small and determined Steve try and fail to enter the army three times. Using unknown chemicals and formulas, small, sick, and skinny Steve was turned into a man with enhanced healing, strength, and durability. He then toured the US selling bail bonds during the war until he led a rescue mission in order to recover his friend Bucky's faction behind enemy lines. Him and his group of Howling Commandos continued to fight in the war against HYDRA and Red Skull until, in order to save the world, Steve flew a plane into the Atlantic and was frozen and missing for 70 years.
always coming to Tony, asking for him to fix their weapons or asking if he could make them new ones, and they didn’t even bat an eyelash at the amount of time, work, money, or resources it might cost Tony to do that. On top of being Iron Man, Tony also had his company to run, and wasn’t a full time superhero or agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. like the rest of them. He didn’t have an unlimited amount of time to spend with them. And yet, he always seemed to drop everything in order to please them. They said jump, Tony asked how high. And they never even thanked him.
"She's alive. She's part of our kids’ lives. Babysits Buck when we need her to. Comes to dinner once a month."
Tony cleared his throat and clapped his hand together. “So, shall we go visit Loki? See what he’s up to?”
There was a sharp sting on his cheek, like he’d been slapped. But it seemed faraway, numb, like it wasn’t really happening to him. “ANTHONY STARK!” a booming voice demanded. He knew that voice. It was Thor.
“He has two adopted daughters, sir,” Vision said. “We can send a message to them and they can inform us of how to keep him subdued.”
“My feelings for you haven’t changed, Natasha,” Matt told her. “But if anything like this happens again, I’m not going to stick around for it. I don’t want to be with someone like that.”
He wasn't too keen on telling the group about his other life on this other earth. But then again, maybe they wouldn't be interested in the specifics. Oh, who was he kidding. They were a group of superheroes, of course they were going to be curious. They always needed details after everything was said and done.
Childhood: Clint's parents ran a drug front from their farm in Iowa. When they got into a disagreement with local crime lords, they were murdered. Clint's father was extremely abusive and controlling. Clint and his brother were put into foster care, but ran away after a few homes and joined the circus. Clint then trained with circus archer Trickshot into becoming a master of archery, unable to miss a shot.
“Ah, I knew Legolas would pop up somewhere! He’s your best friend in my world, too. Kind of a package deal.”
Steve sighed. He didn’t want to watch a movie when he could be doing something useful. He didn’t really know what he could do that would be useful, but he was itching to do something. He’d been sitting still for too long. But Clint was right. Tony had taken Natasha on a tour of the tower in order to distract her while he waited. Thor was off to Asgard to search for the other stones. There was nothing to do but be useless.
“It could be true,” Natasha piped in. “When we were all on the Helicarrier and arguing with each other, that was the mind stone trying to control us. None of us were even touching it and it was still trying to influence us, just by being in the same room as it.”
“For if everything doesn’t go perfectly the second time and he gets away? Do you have another idea of how to stop him?”
Steve nodded and pulled the yellow stone out of his pocket. “Yeah, it’s this thing. I was in Tony’s lab, and I was searching through his things, and it was underneath some papers, and it fell to the ground, and I picked it up, and suddenly I was here, so….”
Pietro's girlfriend Crystal grew up with parents who were Wiccans, so everyone at school thought she worshipped the devil. She just had a thing for the elements, which made people look at her like she was crazy. Plus she was known to date around, which grated on Natasha's nerves every time she heard someone mutter 'slut' around her.
Needless to say, Natasha was thinking about all this, and (not) freaking out about her parents meeting Matt tonight. She really liked him, and she didn't want her parents to ruin the good thing she had going on. She knew they wouldn't really understand her friends or what they did in their spare time together. It's not like they were all innocent flowers, and she just didn't want her parents to worry, or worse, actually catch her after school activities.
She was clinging to him so tightly she didn’t notice that her Tony and the other world Tony had locked eyes. The other Tony saluted to her dad and her dad nodded and thanked the other Tony. He disappeared back to his world without another word.
Natasha held up her hand to show him the engagement ring she’d gotten when he proposed after her college graduation.
Clint watched from his perch, firing all his remaining arrows into Thanos, because that’s the only thing he really could do. They weren’t going to kill him, but at least he could make him feel a little bit of pain. He watched Steve unwaveringly keep smashing his shield into Thanos’s face over and over and over again. He watched Tony sitting on Thanos’s arm, trying not to fall off while also trying use an energy laser to sever the gauntleted hand off. He watched Thor grab Wanda and fly his hammer into the sky, getting her within reach of Thanos’s mind. Her scarlet magic rippled in the air, and Clint saw Thanos go completely still for a couple of seconds, and then slightly move, struggling against Wanda’s magic.
Tony nodded, sloppy and still drunk. "'M tired," he slurred. "If you don't believe me, just ask Jane and Thor. They'll know what I mean." And then Tony passed out again, leaving the Avengers confused and at a loss for words, desperately wanting to talk to Jane and Thor.
"Cool. Thanks." She took a sip of her orange juice and slid into the seat beside her little brother. "Hey, солнышко
Steve laughed. "We'll try not to. Tonight's a Friday. You think he can come over for dinner? I promise we'll leave you two alone if you want to hang out after dinner, but please. I would like to sit down and talk with him, to get to know him. No intimidation or tricks."
Matt shrugged. “I thought something happened to you when you didn’t show up for school after your mission.”
"I don't know,” Jane said. "You'll have to ask Tony when he's sober and willing to talk about it. This is as much as we know since finding him last night. We're gonna work on a way to send him back. I thought I would have an answer sooner so things would go back to normal, but as usual Tony can't keep his big mouth shut."
“Maybe,” she said. She spent a few more seconds analysing the stone with her magic before she dropped her hand and the red energy disappeared from the air. “I’m not sure the stones can be destroyed,” she told him.
“Maybe we can find a way to stop Thanos without destroying the stones,” he said quietly. “We can’t destroy Vision’s stones, and, to be honest, we need this one to send Natasha home to her world.”
Once he let go, she moved over to Steve and placed her hand on the stone. “Let’s do this,” she whispered, using hers and Steve’s energy combined. The stone glowed with the force of their thoughts, and they disappeared into the multiverse, leaving Tony and Peggy behind.
“Wait, but what happened after he sent Hela away?” The younger Natasha chimed in. “Did he keep trying to gain the stones and their power, or what?”
Frank Castle's family was slaughtered by the mob when he was a kid and grew up with a lot of anger issues. The entire school was afraid of him, except Natasha, who welcomed him into their group with open arms.
“Yep, still superheroing. Put a ring on Pepper’s finger, got married. Took this kid Peter under my wing, met the king of Wakanda, and hung out with some more aliens other than Thor.”
But there was no other explanation for why all of his stuff would be missing, why his lab looked like his lab, but didn’t have the same technology he’d become accustomed to. Really, what the hell was going on? Was he hallucinating? He’d had some to drink last night, but he didn’t think he’d drunk enough for this.
I swear I wrote this before I saw Endgame. Like I legit swear. I had this all written out and finished, minus the editing, when Endgame was released. So the fact that Natasha died in both is an extreme coincidence. At least I brought her back to life?
She dropped her keys on the table and set her bag down by the door and rushed into Tony’s waiting embrace. Hugging him felt just like it did when she was 17 years old.
I swear I wrote this before I saw Endgame. So the fact that I tied Natasha to the soul stone like in the movie is a complete coincidence. Also, you can thank me for NOT having Steve go back in time in order to be with Peggy and screwing up her whole damn future because...what even was that plot point?
“Because we would be using the stones for our own personal gain! If we do it once, what’s to stop us from continuing to do it? How does that make us any better than Thanos? I don’t want the power of these stones to consume us, Steve. I don’t want to rely on their power. We use it to stop him, and then we never use them again. That was the deal.”
The evening was going off without a hitch. He had his eyes on Natasha, he was texting back and forth with Frank about their progress. Everything was coming up cherries for them as the night droned on, and the crowd began to thin as the event was coming to an end. Natasha and Wesley were making their way towards the couches in the lobby, champagne flutes still in their hands.
Slowly, he began to see her coming towards him from the distance. As she approached, she didn’t speak, and Clint scanned her face trying to catch any flaw in her form, any suggestion that this wasn’t really her. He couldn’t find any.
“Well, I don’t want to risk any of us getting hurt or dying. Not on my watch. If some of us can use these stones, then we can defeat him, and then we can destroy the stones so no one is tempted to use their powers ever again.”
“Then he blackmailed you. You were vulnerable, brother. You had just fallen into the void after learning you were adopted. He manipulated you.”
Except that's not the sleep that Tony got. He tossed and turned, and when he finally did find his way into REM, it was fraught with nightmares about the world burning. There was chaos and smoke and he was left standing alone in the middle of a smouldering circle, watching the world fall away before his very eyes.
normal with his daughter. Yeah, Matt was a good guy. Her friends—the ones that he’d met—seemed nice, if a little…weird. But he wasn’t one to judge. Despite the fact that weren’t any obvious red flags, something still felt off to him.
"Wait, what do you mean, another consciousness?" Tony asked. His mind felt like it was wrapped in cotton. He couldn't think straight, couldn't remember what was going on or where he was supposed to be. His daughter was doing something dangerous tonight. Only he remembered that she wasn't his daughter, not really. He couldn't understand what was going in.
It's late again. I took care of my baby niece while her parents were on a weekend trip, and then I got sick. So, here you go.
Steve tensed slightly, and then tried to force himself to relax, as he saw Loki walk out from the back. This Loki wasn’t so different from his own: same long, greasy black hair, same facial expressions, same dark style of clothing. He didn’t look manic or evil the way he had during the Battle of New York, though. He just looked like one of those band members who played emo music that Wanda liked to torture everyone with loudly at four AM.
Tony's spatula went clacking onto the counter as it fell from his hand. He wasn't ready to face this voice, what this voice would do or say or act. He had to remind himself she wasn't his daughter in this universe. They probably didn't even like each other. She was a Russian spy, and a lot older than 17, and probably only mildly tolerated him.
Thor sighed. “No. I learned quite a few things about my father these past few days that I was not aware of.” There was a sad downturn of his mouth, as if Thor was emotionally tired and disappointed. The young Natasha had a feeling the Asgardian’s world had just been turned upside down yet again, and he wasn’t taking it very well. She reached out to Thor, giving him a hug, and invited him to sit down on the couch next to her.
You could have gotten away with everything I did without a slap on the wrist while I had to suffer in the dungeons of Asgard. Do you know what they did to me down there, brother? I only let you see what I wanted you to see. The truth was much grimmer.”
Once they reached the space, the other members looked back at them as the elevator dinged and they all stepped out.
Natasha’s resolve crumbled. “Yeah, that’s what I was coming down here to tell you earlier. But then you weren’t you.”
Thor relaxed. “Thank you, my friend,” he said, and went off in search of his mischievous younger brother.
He was helping Bucky with his homework when Natasha walked in the door, talking to someone on her cell phone. She waved to them and walked up the steps, her door slamming. A few minutes later Steve walked in the door and Bucky lost all his concentration, wrapping around his father like a starfish.
When Tony woke up, he knew something was different. Everything was different. His lab was different. It was the same in some ways, but…there was no FRIDAY. No Iron Man suits. Nothing familiar like that. He didn’t understand. Had Pepper purged everything after their fight? Tony knew she was still upset about him being Iron Man, but he didn’t think she would go this far. They talked last night. Hell, they had smoothed things over. It was fine.
Steve chose that moment to tune out of their conversation, and focus his attention onto Wanda. She was off to the side, studying the stone on the table with an intense expression. The tell-tale sign of her magic was visible by the red in the air. He got up from where he was sitting and went over to Wanda.
Tony looked hopelessly lost, sitting in the chair surrounded by the tools of his workshop. "You mean like science fiction stuff?"
Tony left the two of them at the dining room table with Steve's sketchbook and his charcoal pencils in order to call the pizza place. He ordered two larges, one with pepperoni, and one with veggies on it so they could seem like a healthy family, and watched his husband sketch the tree in their backyard, helping teach Bucky how to do the same. He watched them until the doorbell rang and he paid the pizza guy.
He thought about it for a while, none of the other Avengers pressuring him to make an announcement on his decision. Rather, they let him be, knowing the decision was weighing on him, and allowed him to fully think it all through.
The younger Natasha bit back a smile and fought off the urge to laugh. She and her Clint had a similar dynamic. But as much as their interaction amused her, she still felt a pang in her chest. She missed her best friend. And to be quite honest, she was super worried about him. What was she missing out in in her world? What was going to happen to Clint after they killed Wesley? Now that she knew Alexander Pierce wasn’t a good guy? Were all her friends in danger?
“FRIDAY, shut off all comms but mine and Natasha’s for a moment,” Tony said, and Clint was temporarily cut off from communicating with the rest of the team. If he had to guess, Tony was filling Natasha in on what had happened and what the new plan was without any distractions.
Tony waited a few minutes until the coast was clear and then made his way back to their house. None of this was making sense to him. What kind of fucked up shit was his daughter getting into? Who were these people she was after?
She smiled. “Yeah. Just got back from my first case as an agent. I’m brand spanking new around the office.”
“The doctor said he had some internal bleeding, but that’s under control,” Peggy told him. “His arm was badly crushed and there’s a chance of some brain swelling, both of which they're keeping an eye on. Only time will tell.”
“Yeah, about that…how are you here? Not that it’s not good to see you and the Capsicle again, but…this isn’t your world.”
Thor’s skin was vibrating, itching for the kind of fights he and the Warriors Three had been subject to in Asgard. He would not doubt relish in this fight, and then have a celebratory feast with the rest of his brothers in arms when they defeated the Mad Titan. Thor was eager to put this man in his place, torture him after all the torture he put his brother through. Loki had done a lot of bad things in his life, and Thor had forgiven him for a lot. It was a relief to know Loki had not willingly worked with Thanos that day during the Battle of Manhattan. That just meant all that misplaced anger and mistrust had to funnel itself somewhere, and Thor chose to use it to obliterate the man who had ensnared and mind controlled his little brother. He couldn’t wait to see Thanos go down.
“I guess. I’m happy things have worked out for both of us. For all of us,” she said, leaning against Tony and shutting her eyes.
Steve pretended to pay attention to the violent movie Clint had picked out that was playing on screen, but he found he couldn’t turn his mind off. He pretended to be tired, cleaned up the dishes, and then retreated to his room. His fingers itched at his side, pulsing against his leg. He was restless.
Thanos hummed again. “Titan was once a poor, starving planet that barely had enough money to feed all of its citizens. Thousands of people were begging for scraps, unable to fend for themselves or their family. In order to rectify this, half of Titan’s population was…sacrificed, so that it could once become rich and thriving.”
And if she really wanted to impress him, she would hide all her personal feelings and learn how to get the mission done. It’s what she was good for. And she was going to pull it off without a hitch.
That night in bed, after making out with his husband a bit, they turned out the lights. His arms around his husband's smaller body, listening to the slight wheeze in his chest, Tony Stark fell asleep, and had the best night's sleep he'd had in his whole life.
This one's a long one. Sorry, guys. But at least all the action and fighting is this one, so you all get to finally see the Avengers fight Thanos. Archive warning applies to this chapter, obviously, since there's fighting.
But however hard the Avengers tried to bring Thanos down, they couldn’t. They were attacking him on all sides—Thor bashing him in the skies with Mjolnir, Wanda attacking him with her magic, Natasha using her spider bites to shock him, Steve using his shield to break him down, Tony hitting him with his repulsor rays, Vision using the mind stone’s power, Clint firing all different kind of trick arrows at him from his perch in the tree—but nothing slowed Thanos down. Nothing was making him tired.
Foggy had texted her and said he was on his way to drop Matt off and there were knots in her stomach. She'd drank three cups of coffee and both her hands and her legs were shaking with her nerves. Tony was glancing at her, trying not to laugh, and Steve was trying to calm her down and tell her that it was going to be all right.
“I don’t think the reality stone works that way. So far I’ve only been able to use it to travel through and create different realities.”
“But how did Thanos get the gauntlet out of the weapons room? Do we think Loki is still helping him?”
"Your mind is essentially stuck in two worlds, Tony. Do you believe in alternate universes? Infinite realities?"
“He lost the arm and he lost some of his motor function that he’ll have to work out in physical therapy, but he’s got all of his memories and he’s kept his spirit. He kept asking where you were. Your boyfriend and Clint kept asking, too. Said it was urgent. Does this have to do with Fisk?”
to the fight? She still found that hard to believe. And hard to believe that he was so confident against all the odds. Sure, he had the gauntlet, but other than that and strength on his side, it looked like an easyish win for the Avengers. He had to have something up his sleeve.
Steve left Natasha at the kitchen island in order to open the door. When he came back, he was trailed by her friends.
He didn’t know who Wesley, Fisk, or Nobu were, or how his daughter and her friends had come in contact with him. And what was Natasha talking about, being trained to be an assassin? Since when? Where had their daughter been getting that kind of training? It didn’t make sense. She was 17 years old. Tony would have known…wouldn’t he?
"I need you to sign this paperwork real quick before the meeting with the new investors. Just sign here and here." She whipped the files out from under her arm and pointed to the signature line on the sheets of paper. She clicked a pen and handed it over to Tony, who didn't even know what was going on or what he was supposed to be signing.
“What the fuck,” Tony whispered. Steve could see his hands shaking. He didn’t know how to handle this.
He heard the click of a key sliding open the lock towards the front door of their house, and scrambled up from the kitchen table, terrified and feeling extremely out of place. This wasn’t his home. This wasn’t his world. He was not like the Steve of this world, he was just imposing into someone else’s life, and his heart was hammering in his throat like mad…
Thanos just simply grinned. “We meet again, little Stark. For the last time, hopefully. I will say a prayer for you and your fellow teammates when I’ve laid your entire world to waste.”
She nodded at Steve to follow her out of the lab, and he gladly did, happy to be doing something useful for once. Looking through old documents and books? That was something he knew how to do. He couldn’t wait to finally be a help in this situation.
"No, Loki gave me the day off. I don't work until Monday until 6:30. You going to be able to take me or do I need to ride the train?"
"Good day," he confirmed, shifting Bucky onto his right hip as he kissed Tony. "Pizza okay for dinner tonight?"
. Steve wasn’t the greatest at comforting people, but he tried anyway, if the situation called for it. He put a hand on Tony’s arm. “I’m so sorry, Tony,” he said. “But I think there’s a way I can help.”
Wanda's boyfriend, Victor Shade, was the newest member of their group. His parents were evil scientists intent on world domination, according to him, so he actually moved in with Erik. He was well-spoken and a perfect match for Wanda and nothing like his parents. Natasha had met his father once. He scared the shit out of her.
Tony took the elevator to his R&D workshop underground and started working on his father's project, the Arc Reactor. He was trying to create a self sustaining energy field that could run by itself for a year before running out of juice and needing to be recharged. He was so close to figuring out how to get it to work properly. He just needed to keep digging and find which element was the stabilising agent.
“Yes, I have the stones,” Thor confirmed. He took them out of his pocket and set them on the table in front of them. The three stones were coloured purple, green, and orange. “I do not know their powers, but your FRIDAY can tell us, can she not?”
Natasha nodded and rushed into her dad’s arms. He cradled the back of her head, clinging to her desperately, afraid to let go but afraid of what it would mean if he didn’t. “I love you,” he told her.
Before Tony could really catch his breath after Thanos’s super punch, the fist with the gauntlet slammed right into his jaw and he was back on the ground, struggling to get back up.
Tonight’s mission was finally becoming a reality. She was letting the others handle everything with Fisk. Her mission was just Wesley. She was supposed to seduce information out of him, or get him to trust her in some way. They needed unfettered access to where Fisk keeps all his information. She just needed a location, a password, and her hacking skills would do the rest of the work. Wesley wouldn’t even know what hit him.
When he got close enough, he saw Natasha wielding a bow and arrow and Clint guiding her on how to shoot it and hit the target, which had been set up a good distance away from the two. She shot her arrow at the target, almost making her mark, but slightly off. She and Clint kept working on their aim until it was nearly perfect every time. Matt just sat there calmly, listening to the hiss of the arrows in the air, not even looking the least bit bored. He blatantly wondered what blind people did for fun or how they staved off the boredom. Tony was forever bored.
Nervously, Peggy stood up from the chair she had been sitting in and smiled at Steve. “Hello,” she said in her post English accent. She had been living in America since she was a child, but that British accent had clung to her all these years. “You’re certainly not the Steve of this universe,” she chuckled.
Wanda was seething with anger, but was careful not to let her magic consume her before she could use it on the Titan. She wanted to punch a hole in his heart, rip it out with her bare hands like she had done with Ultron. She lost her family, her place in this world, and the only thing she had left to fight for was the others just like her, struggling and treading water in a world that was falling apart. She was just trying to make the world a little easier to exist in. And she would take all of that hurt and anger and confusion that had built up inside her over the years, and pour it into the fight with Thanos. That ugly bastard wouldn’t know what hit him.
“Super. So, who wants to control what stone? Can I keep control of the reality one? Is everyone cool with that?”
“Seems to me you’re using a stone without actually using it. If you’re telling me your chaos magic is going to eventually corrupt you—”
Aunt Peggy, who wasn't really her aunt, grew up with her dad. Her family practically adopted him after his mother died and they had been best friends ever since.
She took it gingerly, shaking his hand. “This is kind of weird,” she said. “You’re my dad…but you’re not. At least when I met the other Tony they looked a lot alike, but…”
“With the soul stone. We go back in time before Thor destroys that soul stone, and use it to go into the soul world, talk to Natasha, and see what she wants.”
"Yeah, about that," Clint said. "Do I exist in this other world of yours? I'm not some like, circus freak or some crazy assassin or something, am I?"
Childhood: Tony's childhood was very lonely. His mother was depressed and his father was an abusive alcoholic who would rather work than pay attention to his son. Tony grew up in the hands of their butler, Edwin Jarvis, until his death due to old age. Tony grew up self loathing, following in the footsteps of his father. He put an act on for the media of a self indulging asshole, but showed a story of hating himself and depression behind the curtains.
"No, friend Tony, you built your own tower," Thor said, grinning like a mad man. He had never seen someone build just a powerful building before with their own two hands and the help of some robots. He'd seen his mother and brother use magic to build things, sure. But that was magic. Tony used science and mechanics.
Clint almost said yes automatically. He wanted his Nat back, no doubt. But he thought Natasha should have a say in what happens. “Let’s ask Nat,” he said.
"I guess, dude. I guess anything's possible. Anyway, Pepper sent me down here. She wants to talk to you about something. Wouldn't tell me what."
“The purple stone holds the power to control space, while the green one is the soul stone, and the orange one controls time.”
It did indeed take days to complete the process, all the while the other Avengers continued to experiment with the stones. They learned how to bend perception, change harmful objects into less harmful ones, travel back in time when a simulation didn’t go as planned so they could do it over, and even travel through different rooms in the blink of an eye. If they could all use their gems seamlessly, they would be able to overpower and confuse Thanos long enough for Wanda to use her magic in order to destroy his power stone. At least, that was the plan. They had no way of knowing if they would actually succeed or not.
He ran towards the sound of their voices, trying to stay in the shadows in case he needed to bail Natasha out of a bad situation. He took a moment to assess the situation: Wesley, with a gun pointed at Natasha. Clint grabbed an arrow and drew his bow tight, waiting for their next moves, unafraid to strike Wesley if the moment called for it.
He furrowed his eyebrows in confusion when his eyes landed on Steve. Steve was...buff? "Hmm," he mused. "Steve?"
Natasha, meanwhile, was trying to sneak behind Thanos and try her signature move out on him. If she could get her thighs around him, choke him out before he did any more damage to him, and then that would be that. But the problem was Thanos was alien of great height. He was a lot bigger than a human. He was like all of the Avengers combined. In a word, massive. And Natasha couldn’t find a way to reach him or take him down without climbing the tree Clint was in and dropping right down on his shoulders. It was too risky, even for her. She was trained in hand to hand combat, thanks to Yasha and the Red Room, but it was hard to really take down someone who was easily five times your height and weight.
“See? And Vision’s had that stone in his head for a while and he hasn’t tried to mind control any of us and go rogue. At least, I don’t think so.”
Thor shrugged. “Because I believe you’re better than the chaos in your mind. I believe you’re more than the god of mischief. It’s a part of you, but I do not believe that’s all you are. There is good in you, and I do not believe you want to see the world burn, especially if there’s a chance Thanos could take away your life or the subjects you want to rule over.”
Thanos frowned, but didn’t push Thor any further. He was stronger than he’d ever been at this point, stronger than all of the Avengers combined, and he would take them down, no matter what. Being defeated wasn’t an option.
When he was done cooking, Tony placed two plates on the island and the two dug in. Tony debated while they ate about talking to Natasha, trying to sneakily figure out how to talk to her without revealing he was technically from another world. Or reality or mind set or whatever. He didn't want anyone other than Jane and Thor to know.
Thor patted Tony on the back. “Well, if you two are meant to be, surely the gods will smile upon you and make it so.”
Jane sighed, trying to figure out the best way to explain to Tony what was going on. She didn't know very much about the world he was stuck in, what kind of career Tony had. For all she knew, he wasn't a scientist there. He could run a car dealership, for all she knew. And it wasn't like magic was very easy to explain, anyway. Thor had tried, but sometimes she just couldn't wrap her mind around the concept.
